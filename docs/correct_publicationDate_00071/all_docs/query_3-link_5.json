        "text": "S. Delany\n\njust wanted to start by saying I'm new to this site and am really enjoying reading all the posts. I have a love of reading that goes back to childhood and enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, you name it.\n\nI found this site while researching a book I had read years ago but didn't remember the author, only had fond memories of characters and the name dhalgren. needless to say I found what I was looking for in the great resoure of the internet, and was able to find the book I was looking for in a second-hand bookstore and revisited the city of bellona. It was all I had remembered it to be.\n\nI am now curious to hear any comments on other works by Delany, they had quite a few of his books at the second-hand shop including Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand, and the Neveryon series. Any information you could give me would be welcomed, although I will probably buy them just based how much I enjoyed Dhalgren.\n\nAlso must say I have increased my reading list with all the postings on authors I haven't had the opportunity to experience yet. Thanks\n\nMy favourite Delany book is STARS I MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND , it's supposed to be the first installment in a diptych but we're still waiting for part two, 16 odd years on! Apparently he's been concentrating more and more on his academic interests.\n\nAnyway, STARS I MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND is a hugely satisfying albeit difficult read. His far-future human and alien cultures are brilliantly imagined.\n\nThis book is out of print, I think. But his better known books from the 60's and 70's can still be got, especially in the SF masterworks series.\n\nAnother less well known Delany book is THEY FLY AT CIRON a very vivid meditation on violence and sexuality, tending more towards Fantasy than SF. I enjoyed it alot.\n\nI found BABEL 17 as difficult to decipher in parts as the mysterious signals that are at the centre of the story. I also found it a bit pretentious and puerÂ¡le. And this was one book I really wanted to love!\n\nI haven't read DHALGREN yet, but apparently it sold around million copies in the States its day. Pretty widely read then.\n\nI would say Le Guin is more readable and, I have to say, ultimately a better writer (in my opinion) - if less radical than Delany. I think story telling and good writing almost always comes first with her whereas Delany has lots of political and literary axes to grind.\n\nIt is interesting to compare them though as they both began publishing around the same time (if I remember correctly, the same year in fact.. somewhere in the early 60's) and they were both part of a similar trend towards more literary and sociological concerns in SF.\n\nNova\n\nIt occurred to me that Nova hasn't been mentioned yet but this is also a great book. It's probably Delany's most \"ordinary\" sci-fi book and I think it's a good one to start with if you're new to Delany. One of Delany's strongest traits is the intimacy of his characters. Delany takes you into the the same room as his characters so you can se, hear and smell them as if you actually were present. Most other sci-fi writers describes characters from \"outside the story\" so to speak. Characters occur in the books as they occur in life when you meet them at town, on bars etc. One friend of mine said that Delany describes characters by means of their actions only but I'm not sure exactly what he meant by that. Look how sharply space captain Lorc von Ray and the Mouse are delineated in the narrative. Delany uses flashbacks in chapter 2 to give away information of what happened to von Ray and Prince (who were friends to begin with) at their childhood and how they became enemies. You will believe yourself to be von Ray when you read this chapter.\n\nI just finished The Jewels of Aptor. This is the review I posted at the internet book list and the internet book database of fiction:\n\nThis is a straightforward post-apocalyptic tale, a much easier read than The Einstein Intersection (the other Delany book I have read to date). It addresses familiar cold war era themes of the dangers and corrupting influence of the powers given man through scientific breakthroughs.\n\nCenturies after nuclear holocaust, mankind lives a primitive life, with high rates of small mutations. On another continent Aptor (presumably what's left of the USA), what is left of man is highly mutated, and a small group maintains scientific knowledge. At some point a set of three quasi-magical jewels were created, which serve as focus points for much of this knowledge, but the jewels always corrupt those who come to control them. Organized religion is a dominant force on this world; the leaders of the dominant religion have fallen prey to the corrupting lure of the jewels. The story follows a group of four men who have been sent to Aptor to unite the jewels and bring them back to the leaders of their religion.\n\nCharacterization is limited; we never really learn much about the motivations of the protagonist Geo and his companions, nor of the religious leaders who try to manipulate their actions. We do ultimately get a not entirely convincing explanation for the cruelty and manipulations of Jorrde, the closest thing we have in the book to a villain.\n\nIn the end, the jewels are thrown into the sea (where we know they will be hidden away for millennia while mankind has the chance to mature), when one of Geo's companions steals the jewels to gain their power for himself, but then commits an act of selfless sacrifice to save his compatriots.\n\nUltimately, The Jewels of Aptor is an optimistic book, with the naive and idealistic young granddaughter Argo bringing scientific knowledge back to the primitive world, and the temptation of the jewels removed.\n\nDelany is big on symbolism, and there are many parts of the book that feel deliberately unrealistic. Overall, I'd say this is worth your time, but it far from groundbreaking. I gave it a 7/10.\n\nDelany is a good writer but it's difficult to recommend him. He's what people call an \"acquired taste\". He's great on style and characters but his plotting is often obscure and almost impossible to follow.\n\nMaybe the best place to start is \"The Fall of the Towers\" omnibus. It's a collection of three short post apocalyptic \"adventure\" novels, originally published in the legendary pulp format Ace Double. You already see something of his original style but the plot is fairly straightforward and easy to follow.\n\nAnother recommended book is Nova, which is my favorite Delaney novel. It's also his only novel which I feel has a really strong plot.\n\nHis most famous novel Babel-17 has great ideas but is marred by a weak ending.\n\nAnd then of course there is \"Dhalgren\" which was nicknamed by a SF critic as \"the most famous SF novel nobody ever finished\". Have never read it so can't comment on that remark.\n\nYes he is gay. He talks about it in his auto-biography, and in one of the stories in Atlantis ..... He was married to a childhood friend and had a daughter, but they eventually divorced. He explained how they ended up married in the book, because he knew he preferred men even as a youngster.\n\nHis AB is fascinating and very well written. Although he is an academic and a professor, he didn't have a college degree when he started, don't know if he ever got one or not. He is incredibly well educated though from his travels and reading. He is usually at one of the cons I got to in the summer and he just blows everyone else away. Not that he is arrogant or bombastic, in fact he is funny, and very friendly. But he has so much information at his fingertips, and has such an erudite way of saying things. Many other authors who end up on panels with him can be found in the hall or the bar freaking out. Everyone else looks like so much chopped ham next to him.\n\nI've now read 3 Delaney books:\n\nNova (7/10)\n\nBabel-17 (8/10)\n\nEinstein Intersection (7/10)\n\nNone of them have blown me away I usually like books with lots of mythology references, like Wolfe and Zelazny, but Einstein Intersection was dissapointing.\n\nIt seemed like a standard 'mutants after the apocalypse story'. interesting mutants, but again some of them were very typical.The writing i liked, but the characters were flat and the plot boring. Also the inclusion of mythology was lazy - instead of building up resonances with archetypes, Delaney just told us who each of the characters represented. We are told Lobey is Orpheus, so off he goes to ressurect his girlfriend, except at no point did it seem he actually loved her. Some parts of the plot didn't really make any sense: We are told Lobey has to be taught hunting to go on his journey, but only gets one poor 'lesson'; and Kid Death is supposed to be the only one powerful enough to raise the dead, but by the end of the book Spider, Green-eye and Lobey all seem to have the ability?\n\nAlso in a review i read that humanity was supposed to have disapeared and been replaced by aliens? Apart from a few lines saying 'we are not human' I don't see how you can get this from the book. They weren't human because the had evolved, not because they were aliens It seemed like the reviewer knew it was a classic and academic, and was pulling things from the book that weren't there.\n\nI thought it had a lot of potential, but was too slight and didn't fulfil it - much the same asi thought about Nova.\n\nIs Dhalgren significantly better than the 3 i've read? Its the only one i still have on my to read list."
