        "text": "Just as fresh as my first reading 4+ decades ago\n\nI bought this novel by Sam Delany in the summer between high school and my first year in collage. I read it whenever I could. Lunch breaks, smoke breaks (though I didn't smoke) and even skipping TV shows to get to back to this book. It was finished in less than a week and I was hungry for more. Delany had woven a galaxy filled with places and characters that exploded with uniqueness and mystery. It ranted with adventure and revenge and it pulled itself together by way of the impossible. It had its quirky madmen, scholarly good guys, off the road vagabonds and beautiful mysterious ladies who could predict your future or call back your past. This novel was written before Star Wars was even conceived yet it had plug in technology, as seen in Matrix and Space travel as vast and exploratory as Dune. And because Delany had obviously done his science homework he took the time to fill in the blanks on how a thousand years of our future history produced the marvels spoken of in here. I've so admired this work that I've always kept a copy in my library. So, when I saw it in audible form I grab it without a second thought. What a treasure. And now my compliments to the narrator, Stefan Rudnicki, who gave every character their whole, unique and distinct personalities while living thru their experiences with familiarity and fervor. Bravo! - I've read a lot of Sci-Fi in the last 50 plus years and this one still stands out as one of the true BEST. Please, if you're a real sci-fi fan don't pass this one up. After all don't you wanna know how to dive into the heart of a star and come out alive? Ha!\n\nIntriguing narrative and excellent reading\n\nMost of the novel feels like a really long exposition. I kept waiting for the narrative to properly get going and suddenly it was all over. The experience made me think hard about what the point of the novel actually was and all the world building and the subtle commentary within. Don't worry, at the surface level it's not particularly difficult to follow the storyline. There are some sudden shifts but you should be alright if you pay attention to which chapter you are in.\n\nI will probably listen to it a few more times. The reader is excellent 👌."
