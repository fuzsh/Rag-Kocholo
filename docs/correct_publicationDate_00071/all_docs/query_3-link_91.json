        "text": "After his seventh novel, Empire Star (1966), Samuel R. Delany began publishing short fiction professionally with “The Star Pit.” It appeared in Worlds of Tomorrow and was turned into a popular two-hour radio play, broadcast annually over WBAI-FM for more than a decade. Two tales, “Aye, and Gomorrah” and “Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones,” won Nebula Awards as the best science fiction short stories, respectively, of 1967 and 1969. Aye, and Gomorrah: And Other Stories contains all the significant short science fiction and fantasy works that Delany published between 1965 and 1988, excepting only those tales in his Return to Nevèrÿon series. A native New Yorker, Delany teaches English and creative writing at Temple University in Philadelphia. In July of 2002, he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame."
