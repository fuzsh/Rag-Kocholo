        "text": "The private journals of renowned novelist and critic Samuel R. Delany\n\nFor fifty years Samuel Delany has cultivated a special relationship with language in works of fiction, criticism, and memoir that have garnered critical praise and legions of fans. The present volume – the first in a series – reveals a new dimension of his genius. In Search of Silence presents over a decade's worth of Delany's private journals, commencing in 1957 when he was still a student at the Bronx High School of Science, and ending in 1969 when he was living in San Francisco and on the verge of reconceiving the novel that would become Dhalgren.\n\nIn these pages, Delany muses on the writing of the stories that will establish him as a science fiction wunderkind, the early years of his marriage to the poet Marilyn Hacker, performances as a singer-songwriter during the heyday of the American folk revival, travels in Europe, experiences in a New York City commune, and much more – and crosses paths with artists working in many genres, including poets such as Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, and Marie Ponsot, and science fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, and Joanna Russ. Delany scholar Kenneth R. James presents the journal entries alongside generous samplings of story outlines, poetry, fragments of novels and essays that have never seen publication, and more; James also provides biographical synopses and an extensive set of endnotes to supply contextual information and connect journal material to Delany's published work.\n\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION\n\nBRONX SCIENCE AND OTHER NEW YORK SCENES\n\nNotebook 1 – January-February 1958\n\nNotebook 3 – January 1959\n\nNotebook 7 – 1959 [March-April 1959]\n\nNotebook 6 – 1959 [April 1959]\n\nNotebook 4 – April-May 1959\n\nNotebook 5 – 1959 [Summer-Autumn 1959]\n\nIN SEARCH OF SILENCE\n\nNotebook 2 – January 1959 [January-February 1960]\n\nNotebook 8 – March 1960\n\nNotebook 11 – Spring 1960 [Spring-Summer 1960]\n\nJOURNAUX D'ORPHÉE\n\nNotebook 12 – Inclusive to July 1960\n\nCITY COLLEGE\n\nNotebook 13 – September 1960\n\nNotebook 14 – Autumn 1960\n\nNotebook 9 – Winter 1960\n\nNotebook 10 – Spring 1960 [Spring 1961]\n\nNotebook 16 – Spring, Summer 1961\n\nNotebook 17 – Summer 1961\n\nMARRIED LIFE IN THE EAST VILLAGE\n\nNotebook 18 – August 1961\n\nNotebook 15 – September-October 1961 [October 1960 / September-October 1961]\n\nNotebook 19 – November 1961-June 1962\n\nNotebook 21 – Spring 1962 [January 1962]\n\nNotebook 20 – Spring 1962 [March 1962]\n\nTHE FALL OF THE TOWERS AND VOYAGE, ORESTES\n\nNotebook 22 – Summer 1962\n\nNotebook 23 – November 1962 [October-November 1962]\n\nNotebook 25 – Inclusive through March 1963 [Autumn 1962-Spring 1963]\n\nNotebook 24 – Inclusive to January-February 1963\n\nNotebook 75 – [Spring-Summer 1963]\n\nNotebook 68 – [October 1963]\n\nNotebook 71 – [Winter 1963]\n\nNotebook 92 – [Spring 1964]\n\nBABEL-17 AND BEYOND\n\nNotebook 26 – June-July 1964\n\nNotebook 27 – August 15, 1964\n\nNotebook 28 – September 1964-January 1965\n\nNotebook 87 – [Early Spring 1965]\n\nNotebook 82 – [Summer 1964-Spring 1965]\n\nNotebook 81 – [Late Spring 1965]\n\nNotebook 29 – June-July 1965\n\nTRAVELS IN EUROPE\n\nNotebook 67 – [Autumn 1965-Summer 1966]\n\nNotebook 96 – [Autumn 1965]\n\nNotebook 31 – March 1966 [February-March 1966]\n\nNotebook 30 – December 1965 [Spring 1966]\n\nCHANGING SCENES\n\nNotebook 80 – [Spring 1966]\n\nNotebook 91 – [Fall 1966]\n\nNotebook 83 – [December 1966-January 1967]\n\nNotebook 84 – [February-April 1967]\n\nNotebook 76 – [Spring-Summer 1967]\n\nNotebook 69 – [Summer 1967]\n\nPRISM, MIRROR, LENS AND OTHER PROJECTS\n\nNotebook 86 – [Summer 1967]\n\nNotebook 32 – July-October 1967\n\nNotebook 88 – [Autumn 1967]\n\nNotebook 33 – December 1967 [December 1967-January 1968]\n\nNotebook 35 – 1968 [Early Spring 1968]\n\nNotebook 77 – [Early Spring 1968]\n\nNotebook 85 – [Spring-Summer 1968]\n\nNotebook 90 – [Summer 1968]\n\nNotebook 78 – [Summer-Autumn 1968]\n\nNotebook 34 – August 1968 [August-September 1968]\n\nNotebook 79 – [Winter 1968]\n\nTO SAN FRANCISCO\n\nNotebook 36 – January-February 1969\n\nNotebook 37 – April 1969 [February-April 1969]\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nAppendix 1 – Notebook 89 [Winter 1957-January 1958]\n\nAppendix 2 – Notebook 1 – January-February 1958\n\nAppendix 3 – Three Short Works from 1959-60\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nNOTES\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n\"The simple fact is that I think Delany is one of the most important American writers, one who ought to be spoken of alongside any great American writer of the second half of the twentieth century ... the recent publication of volume one of Delany's Selected Journals in a gorgeous edition from Wesleyan University Press (brilliantly edited by Kenneth James) is monumental.\"\n\n~Matthew Cheney, The Mumpsimus\n\n\"\"A game changer for Delany studies reveal[s] how one of the most brilliant American science fiction writers of the time (and later a noted literary theorist) came of age.\"\"\n\n~M.J. Emery, Choice\n\n\"\"Delany himself, having become something of an icon in the urban literary universe.\"\"\n\n~Alan Contreras, The Gay & Lesbian Review\n\n\"\"Traversing Delany's youth, we see a precocious mind grappling with his own talent he lives on two registers, participating in the world and also observing it, living simultaneously as a kid in NYC and, 'a writer of genius'.\"\"\n\n~Robert Minto, New Republic\n\n\"\"In Delany, each work is in dialogue with the next, the fiction illuminating the nonfiction, which in turn re-illuminates the fiction. Delany's notebooks add a new voice to this dialogue.\"\"\n\n~Kenneth R. James, Tor\n\n\"\"The simple fact is that I think Delany is one of the most important American writers, one who ought to be spoken of alongside any great American writer of the second half of the twentieth century the recent publication of volume one of Delany's Selected Journals in a gorgeous edition from Wesleyan University Press (brilliantly edited by Kenneth James) is monumental.\"\"\n\n~Matthew Cheney, The Mumpsimus\n\n\"\"The first hardcover volume of Samuel Delany's journals, out now from Wesleyan University Press (covering the 1950s and 1960s) is both magisterial and inspirational—and boy, do we need the inspiration now. I am in awe of the work and scholarship involved. In collaboration with his remarkable subject, editor Kenneth James is doing an invaluable service to our field.\"\"\n\n~Andy Duncan, Nebula and World Fantasy Award-winning author of The Night Cache\n\n\"Mesmerizing . . . a true portrait of an artist as a young Black man . . . already visible in these pages are the wit, sensitivity, penetration, playfulness and the incandescent intelligence that will characterize Delany and his extraordinary work.\"\n\n~Junot Díaz, author of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\n\n\"This is a tremendously significant and vital addition to the oeuvre of Samuel Delany; it clarifies questions not only of the writer's process, but also his development—to see, in his juvenilia, traces that take full form in his novels—is literally breathtaking.\"\"\n\n~Matthew Cheney, author of Blood: Stories"
