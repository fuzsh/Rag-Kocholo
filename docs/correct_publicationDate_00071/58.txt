Signed, first edition of this novel from Samuel Delany, published at the age of 25, and nominated for the Hugo award the following year. The work was an important influence on the Cyberpunk genre of the coming decades, and combined themes of race, politics, and culture into a mythological space opera that was well ahead of its time.
