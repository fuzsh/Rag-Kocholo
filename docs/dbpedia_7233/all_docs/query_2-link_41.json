        "text": "Recent title sequences for high production value television serials are generally one of two kinds: either extremely minimal, appearing part way through the episode with credits dispersed through the show, or as an extended format of c. ninety seconds’ duration, at or near the start of the show. In a previous book chapter I presented analyses of examples of the latter, arguing that the sequences form an efficient part of the brand image for both the show and commissioning channel. In order to explore the extent to which such sequences are watched or skipped by viewers, and how such decisions are made I organised a series of preliminary focus groups in February 2012 with participants who identified themselves as regular viewers of television serials, the findings of which are presented here. Two forms of stimuli were used: a main title sequence and an end credit sequence from a serial where different music is selected for this sequence for each episode. Analysis of the discussions in...\n\nThis paper discusses the aesthetic mutations of serial title sequences in relation to the overall transformation of television and media culture. Intros of live-action series have changed significantly during 70 years of television history and used various approaches to serve as a figurehead for the series itself as well as the respective broadcasting channel. Even though most of the below-mentioned forms have been sustained throughout different periods and never completely vanished, there are some clear aesthetic trends which I seek to explore. Specific modes of representation have become representative for a certain television era or a specific business model among television providers. For instance, expositional intros, retelling the basic premise of the story through voice-over or song, have been widely applied to a variety of network TV series during “TV I” (50s to 70s; Rogers et al. 2002; Pearson 2011), and are only occasionally used in more recent shows. In contrast, opening titles that show a compilation of character shots to present the main cast and capture the series’ tone have been the dominant form of serial intros in “TV II” (70s to 90s, ibid.) and for most of “TV III” (90s to 2000s, ibid.), albeit being constantly shortened and accelerated in the last two decades. TV III saw the rise of more ‘artsy’ and (allegedly) cinematic title sequences, especially in premium-cable shows, featuring puzzling images or popular visuals, coming together as atmospheric collages that unfold the series’ settings and themes. This development specifically mirrored a growing divide between free-TV and pay-TV providers (including subscription-video-on-demand), ‘classical’ television series such as sitcoms, procedurals, and soap operas, and so-called prestige or ‘quality’ shows adopting blockbuster and art cinema aesthetics, respectively (i.e. Davison 2013; Picarelli 2013; Bednarek 2014; Fahlenbrach/Flückiger 2014; Re 2016). Most notably, the story- or character-centred intros, which are easily understood by both casual and regular viewers, have slowly been displaced by more abstract and enigmatic representations. These highly stylized, complex sequences address a more exclusive and dedicated fans audience. This is not merely an aesthetic evolution but a considerable shift in how various “televisions” (Lotz 2007) are received and re-evaluated. However, even more recently, numerous serial intros across all genres, television and streaming providers have been diminished to either very short title cards or simple title inserts during the opening scene. The continuous reduction and dissolution of the title sequence reaches a high point in today’s “TV IV” era (Jenner 2016; 2018). This might be related to the overall acceleration in media distribution and perception, with especially streaming providers favouring continuous, uninterrupted modes of viewing (e.g. binge-watching) and quashing seemingly ‘unnecessary’ interludes such as recaps, opening and end credits even more rigorously than TV channels before them (e.g. via autoplay and skip buttons). By examining their contrasting mind-sets, functions, and audience appeals, I will discuss the ever-changing representational aesthetics of the serial intro as indicators of significant shifts in television and media consumption culture.\n\nThis conference aims to explore and promote fresh and innovative approaches to the study of television serials. Increasingly, the television serial is the preeminent popular art form of our time. However, the television serial is still relatively understudied – particularly from perspectives that emphasize our cognitive, emotional, and aesthetic engagement with the form. Therefore, the conference will have two central foci. One focus of the conference will be on the analysis of specific narrative and stylistic features of the television serial. Here we envision papers from either a broadly poetic or aesthetic perspective. We are particularly interested in exploring how myriad elements of television programs interact and contribute to seriality. For instance, how do performance or sound design help shape seriality? We are also especially interested in understanding television serials' particular aesthetic effects and achievements. We welcome close analyses, case studies, or broader theoretical explorations of these issues as long as they are grounded in close attention to the form and style of particular television serials. The second focus of the conference will be on the methods and approaches that inform the study of television serials. Here, we envision conceptual, theoretical, and philosophical explorations of particular issues in the study of television serials (e.g. authorship over time; the focus of critical judgment in the context of seriality) and/or meta-theoretical discussions focusing on methodology more generally. In particular, we are interested in papers that assess the potential contributions of cognitive\n\nThe extensive changes affecting television highlight the importance of understanding how these changes might affect programming content. The use of music in evening drama is analyzed here with a view toward interpreting the place of music within several programs in relation to the larger changes affecting the medium. From this analysis, it seems clear that the use of composed music and popular songs is intended to act as a stylistically distinct feature of the overall experience and understanding of evening dramas to attract and hold the attention of viewers across multiple sites of consumption in an increasingly competitive entertainment market. An expansive use of the concept of televisual flow is employed to connect the aesthetic contours of the use of music in evening drama to the ways in which producers try to create and maintain connections with viewers whose viewing patterns and practices are changing rapidly and unpredictably. Keywords television industry, evening drama, televisual flow, popular music It doesn't take much effort to get a sense of the scope and scale of changes the medium of television is experiencing. Simply visit your nearest online or bricks-and-mortar tech retailer and try to adapt to the \"conversion to digital\"; you'll get the idea. The acronyms alone should suggest some serious instability in the ways we will be expected to consume what we are still referring to as television. There are new devices like dvrs and pvrs with all kinds of strange plugs and outlets such as hdmi, dvi, and S/PDIF. These\n\nOpening title sequences play an important role in understanding television series. They are “a film within a film” whose “very purpose is to serve a whole array of functions: copyright law, economics, certification of employment in the context of careers, movie title, entertainment, commercials, fashion, and art” (Stanitzek 45, 46). Opening title sequences are but one example of what Gérard Genette terms paratexts, which are secondary texts that influence the reading of the primary text, such as book covers, title pages, author names, interviews, ads, reviews, and public responses. Genette likened paratexts to thresholds or vestibules, in line with Jorge Luis Borges’ description of prefaces (Genette 261). In film and television, opening title and closing credit sequences often function as the equivalent to the covers of a book, marking its beginning and end. Yet those metaphors are inexact. Some films eliminate the opening titles entirely (e.g. Citizen Kane (1941), Star Wars (1977), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)). On television, title sequences are increasingly contained within the text after a cold open, yet still serve to mark its borders. Lost (2004-2010) and Heroes (2006-2010) popularized the practice of showing only the series’ title, highlighting this function (Gray 74). Yet borders do more than mark territory: they also guide travelers. Like other paratexts, opening title sequences “guide the reader’s attention, influence how a text is read, and communicate such information as to give a text its first contours, its manageable identity so to speak. And paratexts are important not only for the process of textual reception but also for text production; they function as indicators to be aimed for, as structures of literary expectations” (Stanitzek 32). They are a film within a film that is both about the narrative and an independent creation. Even Lost’s sparse title sequence tells a story about the series’ themes of mystery, displacement, trauma, and insight through the rich cult television history of the score’s glissando and its tonal destabilisation (van Elferen 254-258), the title’s swirl evoking the series’ iconic plane crash as it moves from background to fall offscreen in the foreground, and its letters that come into momentary focus before clarity is once again lost. Opening title sequences are a form of narration, a pleasure in their own right, a genre of short filmmaking, and a mark of authorship,1 but not that of the auteur—as “it is the work of specialists, title sequence designers, themselves readers foremost” creating with incomplete access to the series’ final form and contingent on network and creator approval (Stanitzek 48).\n\nTelevision aestheticians and cognitivists share an important endeavour. Both groups are driven to explore the compelling emotional, cognitive and aesthetic appeals of contemporary television serials. In other words, whether we take up a broadly aesthetic perspective or cognitive approach towards TV, we are engaged in an ongoing act of appreciative engagement. We share a mutual fascination with the televisual works that captivate us, and an urge to address our sense of their potential significance or moment. Our apparent commonalities, however, lead us not only in diverse directions, but often also into disagreements and mistrust. I write as someone committed to television aesthetics, who embraces the arrival of new perspectives, and recognises the usefulness of much cognitive work, but who nonetheless will admit to some uneasiness about the presumptions underlying cognitive science, and trepidation regarding its deployment within TV studies. This chapter is a preliminary foray into the two approaches side by side. But rather than comparing and contrasting, I aim to uncover something a little more nuanced and elusive: the distinctive sensibility of each perspective and the implicit values which inform it. The chapter proceeds by identifying some of the commonest notes of concord and discord between aesthetic and cognitive television scholars, uncovering differences of purpose, scope and values, in order to better appreciate the points of urgent distinction which separate the approaches, and to illuminate the hazards of speaking at cross purposes. So that I might grasp more positively the specific strengths and merits of each perspective, I briefly consider how a specific moment of television might seize the attention of its practitioners. I have chosen two moments drawn from recent US television series – The Closer (FOX, 2005-12) and Desperate Housewives (ABC, 2004-12) – that I argue are most sensitively and persuasively appreciated via cognitive and aesthetic perspectives respectively. My exploration of these two examples leads me, finally, to revisit this book’s core focus – the television serial – via a consideration of ‘moment’. The ‘sense of moment’ in this chapter’s title consciously denotes two meanings of the word. The first is more commonplace: a moment is a short time, an instant. The second refers to importance, weight, significance. What is the ‘moment’ of a particular fragment within a long-running serial? How do cognitive and aesthetic approaches weigh this moment? As we shall see, cognitivists and aestheticians take up subtly dissimilar stances in relation to seriality and moment(s), and in each approach, the two meanings of ‘moment’ are differently interconnected. Attending to these distinctions helps us uncover something of the sensibility of each perspective. And in keeping with the values and sensibility of a television aesthetician, I ultimately aver that it is television programmes themselves, or the unique particularities of selected moments within them, which will guide us – if we let them – to choose the most appropriate appreciative approach in each case.\n\nIn the era of TVIII, characterised by deregulation, multimedia conglomeration, expansion and increased competition, branding has emerged as a central industrial practice. Focusing on the case of HBO, a particularly successful brand in TVIII, this paper argues that branding can be understood not simply as a feature of television networks, but also as a characteristic of television programmes. It begins by examining how the network as brand is constructed and conveyed to the consumer through the use of logos, slogans and programmes. The role of programmes in the construction of brand identity is then complicated by examining the sale of programmes abroad, where programmes can be seen to contribute to the brand identity of more than one network. The paper then goes on to examine programme merchandising, an increasingly central strategy in TVIII. Through an analysis of different merchandising strategies the paper argues that programmes have come to act as brands in their own right, and demonstrates that the academic study of branding not only reveals the development of new industrial practices, but also offers a way of understanding the television programme and its consumption by viewers in a period when the texts of television are increasingly extended across a range of media platforms."
