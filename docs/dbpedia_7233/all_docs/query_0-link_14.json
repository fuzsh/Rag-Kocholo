        "text": "Stephen King’s Kingdom Hospital (television) Drama series on ABC, debuting on March 3, 2004, and ending July 15, 2004. A hospital built on the exact site of the Gates Falls Mills, where a mysterious fire killed scores of children laboring in the basement in 1869, seems to be haunted. Certain patients hear the tortured sounds of a little girl crying in the elevator shaft. The hospital staff, trained as rational scientists, dismiss the report of ghosts as foolish superstition, but do so at their own peril. Stars Andrew McCarthy (Dr. Hook), Bruce Davison (Dr. Stegman), Ed Begley, Jr. (Dr. Jesse James). Based on the Danish miniseries Riget. From Sony Pictures/Touchstone Television."
