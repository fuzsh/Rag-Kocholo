        "text": "To the average filmgoer under the age of 20, Bruce Davison is easily recognizable as X-Men's horribly misguided Senator Kelly. To film fans, however, he's an actor whose roles include the haunting lead in the original version of Willard, the father in Apt Pupil, and his Oscar-nominated part in Longtime Companion.\n\nHe reprises his role of Senator Kelly in X2 (well, technically, it's Mystique as Kelly... sayeth the geek) and also stars in the upcoming big screen version of John Grisham's Runaway Jury.\n\nMr. Davison recently took time to discuss his career to date with IGN FilmForce's Ken Plume...\n\nIGN FILMFORCE: Now, am I correct in understanding you're from Pennsylvania?\n\nBRUCE DAVISON: Yes, 1946.\n\nIGNFF: How would you describe yourself as a child?\n\nDAVISON: My mother and father divorced when I was three. I was raised by my mother and spent weekends with my dad, who was a draftsman for the Army Engineers. My mother was a secretary for John B. Kelly, who was Grace Kelly's dad, in Philadelphia – \"Kelly for Brickwork.\" I think he was the guy in the Young Philadelphians played by Brian Dennehy.\n\nIGNFF: Right...\n\nDAVISON: Among other things, she worked for other people as well. But I remember that growing up.\n\nIGNFF: How was your perception of living, essentially in a single parent household, at that time?\n\nDAVISON: Seemed normal to me – I didn't know any different. It was a different time, so I could walk myself to school. My mother and I would walk two blocks to the school, and then she'd get on the trolley car to go into Philadelphia. I basically would see her over there and I'd walk myself home. There was usually a little old lady watching Queen for a Day in my house, on TV. I'd go down and play in the basement. I thought that was sort of normal. My best friend, Billy Harrison, and I would play Flash Gordon and Ming the Merciless.\n\nIGNFF: Who would get to play Flash?\n\nDAVISON: I would of course play Flash. He was usually Professor Zarkov. He went to a Catholic school, so the Catholic kids that would beat us up on the way home from school would be the Clay People.\n\nIGNFF: So everything was well cast...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I was into casting at an early age.\n\nIGNFF: And always seeking the lead part.\n\nDAVISON: Yes, of course.\n\nIGNFF: Would you say that any of this was acted out within school? Did you participate in plays in school?\n\nDAVISON: No, no.\n\nIGNFF: Was it something that never even entered your mind?\n\nDAVISON: Not really. I just played... played with other kids.\n\nIGNFF: Would you say that you were a good student?\n\nDAVISON: I was a good bulls***ter. I spent my whole life figuring out how to get out of work. I would say I was intelligent, but intelligent in a very surreptitious, invisible way.\n\nIGNFF: So you were a planner more than an academic...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: When you talk about your high school years, what was your perception of what you'd be doing as a career? Was it anything that was pushed on you externally, from your parents?\n\nDAVISON: No. Actually, my mother remarried when I was 12, and my stepfather, basically, and my mother raised me through those years. In high school, I thought I was going to be an art major.\n\nIGNFF: What specifically about art appealed to you – besides it being the easiest way out of work?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I guess that was sort of it. I was always a visual person. I could see things visually. I had a harder time with numbers and logic, and I always had more of an artistic sensibility. So that I could do. And it was something that I really loved.\n\nIGNFF: Was it something that your parents supported?\n\nDAVISON: Up to an extent, and God bless them that they didn't, because they said, \"You can go to art school if you want, but here's what we want you to do. We think it's wiser for you, right now, to go to a liberal arts college and take a bachelor of arts, and then see what is in the world for yourself. Just get a B.A., which will have to give you a lot of other courses that you will need to take for living.\" And I did. When I went to Penn State, I got an elective of acting. But I skipped a part – I went to military school for a year in Miami, when I was 15.\n\nIGNFF: Your choice or your parents' choice?\n\nDAVISON: My choice.\n\nIGNFF: It seems kind of an odd choice for someone who is always looking for the path of least resistance.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, but I thought that was. I thought that was the path of least resistance. I had a friend who bulls***ted me, telling me, \"All the babes were there, it was warm all the time.\" I was in the gray, gray snow of Philadelphia through the winters and stuff, and my grandfather had just committed suicide, and I was really kind of freaked. So I just wanted to get away, and my stepfather had gone to Valley Forge, and he suggested that. I said, \"Well, I want to get away.\"\n\nIGNFF: You'd been sold on this beautiful picture of sun and babes.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, beautiful picture, the guy on the brochure – actually, I've written a screenplay about it. It's called Recall. I ended up down there in sort of a prison. Not really a prison, but it was barracks, and I didn't know that you saw the girls 100 yards away, water-skiing by, while you were in a flannel uniform with your head shaved, carrying a nine-pound rifle around.\n\nIGNFF: So if only you had been more keen on research...\n\nDAVISON: Yes. If I had been more keen on logic, and research, instead of following my gut, which has taken me off many a cliff in my life. But anyway, it was a real seminal time for me, and it really gave me a great shot at growing up in life and responsibility and the pain of the real world. All of that stuff.\n\nIGNFF: But not by choice.\n\nDAVISON: Well, it was my choice, but once I was in there I was stuck. I had to save face by living it out for the year. But I came back for my junior and senior year – that was tenth grade that I went there.\n\nIGNFF: Were your parents disappointed that you weren't going to stick with military school – or they understood the situation?\n\nDAVISON: I think my mother wasn't, my stepfather was... that I wasn't going to stick it out. But he didn't think it was much of a military school, having come from Valley Forge. He thought it was kind of a fleabag place.\n\nIGNFF: You got to look at girls across the water.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, and we actually went out with a couple... but you know, having a shaved head, being a 15-year-old boy – all I could do was have a boner from afar.\n\nIGNFF: It didn't exactly lend yourself to being suave.\n\nDAVISON: No, no it didn't.\n\nIGNFF: What would you say are the biggest positives that came out of that experience?\n\nDAVISON: A sense of the real world. A sense of the military ... I've been rewriting a screenplay for 20 years, Carroll O'Connor optioned it at one time, and turned it into I guess CPO Sharkey. But I'm sort of revisiting it now, and it's a great time because it was right at the time just before Vietnam, during the Bay of Pigs. Being able to revisit that, in the time we live in now, it still holds great resonance. That time really had great resonance for me. I can't remember a lot of high school, except girls and a few classes. But I can remember just about everything about the military school. There were fascinating people there.\n\nIGNFF: How so?\n\nDAVISON: Oh, I think Lieutenant Calley came out of there, and General Ramos, the butcher of Haiti – they all were my classmates.\n\nIGNFF: Well, that's some interesting classmates.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. A microcosm for what came next.\n\nIGNFF: So that school really forged an era.\n\nDAVISON: It really did, and my story is basically about the Cuban exiles coming into the school at the time when there was still great racism, and at the time it was just the beginning of the Civil Rights' Movement. It's a great melting pot, that school, for the good and evil that come to our country. A sense of responsibility... at the same time a sense of determination to follow through over the cliff.\n\nIGNFF: An American microcosm all within a military school setting.\n\nDAVISON: It's going under – it's about to be bulldozed into a retirement home. Duty, honor and country, these boys are just about ready to get on the boat for Vietnam. The first casualties are these boys who they take to the Bay of Pigs.\n\nIGNFF: The last class when that school had its luster, still?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it was still trying to find its way in, and then the Bay of Pigs. In fact, I have the sinking of the Rueben James ...that's the metaphor for the school.\n\nIGNFF: What's the status of the script at this time?\n\nDAVISON: It's in development, right now.\n\nIGNFF: When you mention it being rewritten over 20 years, what essentially are the rewrites that you keep revisiting?\n\nDAVISON: A through line for the characters that make the journey inevitable and choices made on everybody's part that follow that line, as opposed to the random. When I was younger, it was all about random moments, and now it's about looking back at it at a time – there's a deliberation in the plot that this is the inevitability of it. Just like George's war.\n\nIGNFF: So sort of brining the subtext of the vignettes to the fore?\n\nDAVISON: It gives characters a through line and an objective, all contributing to the story that unfolds, and conflict.\n\nIGNFF: Are you a character in the piece?\n\nDAVISON: I'm sort of an observer character, yeah. Observer character and a little romance going on. It never happened.\n\nIGNFF: Well, you have to editorialize somehow and at least make yourself look better in your own piece.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: How different would your high school years have been without that experience? Would you see yourself going in a different path?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, because Vietnam came next and I was lucky enough not to go. It really showed me the machine.\n\nIGNFF: So you were disenchanted with the process earlier than others might have been.\n\nDAVISON: I think I got aware of how this train can run off a cliff, if you don't get off.\n\nIGNFF: Did that factor into your decision to go to college at all?\n\nDAVISON: Not really. I don't think so. I think I still wanted to be an art major, and I wanted to be a marine biologist at one time, until I realized all the hard work and the coldness of the water that was involved in that. I'd been scuba diving in Florida, off the Florida Keys. But I ended up at Penn State, taking art as my major, and while I was there, I got involved in a theater appreciation course. And that was it... I'm head over heels now.\n\nIGNFF: What exactly about it appealed to you?\n\nDAVISON: It just was a duck to water. I ended up auditioning for things, and I got a play. I got the lead in a play in Penn State. Oh Dad, Poor Dad. From that it lead to summer stock, and from summer stock, it was just I was gaga. I was going. From there I ended up – my theater history graduate teacher student, a girl named Theresa Germanese, she basically said, \"You've got to get out of here. You've got to go to New York and be an actor. I'm kicking you out.\"\n\nIGNFF: Was it a difficult decision?\n\nDAVISON: Oh yeah. Well, part was difficult... I mean, she was older and I was a young kid and she really believed in me. She got me to apply for a school through the drama department – at Penn State at that time, it was a very close-knit family. You know, bickering and everything else, but there was still a real family. There was a guy named Walter H. Walters who was the head of the department, and he said, \"Yeah, you've got to go.\" Another one named Kelly Yeaton, who was really influential in my life. He was an improvisatory kind of guy that created a great gaming house kind of feel of life, and showed me the ropes in a very metaphysical kind of way. I also read something in college that really did it for me ... I had to get up in front of the class and read a passage about something about the theater, and I found this passage in a book somewhere, and it was a quote from Arthur Miller. It says – in fact, I have it; it's on my wall. Let me get it. Because it was really, really crucial in my finding something that I really had a passion for to do in my life. Everybody kept saying to me, my parents included, \"You've got to find something you really have a passion for, to make a living.\" But this is it: \"There's a certain immortality involved in theater not created by monuments and books, but through the knowledge the actor keeps to his dying day, that on a certain afternoon in an empty and dusty theater, he cast the shadow of a being that was not himself but the distillation of all he had ever observed. All the unsingable heart songs that the ordinary man may feel, but never utter, he gave voice to and by that, he somehow joined the ages.\" – Arthur Miller.\n\nIGNFF: So it was that idea of immortality?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, the idea of really creating something that stands for the ages.\n\nContinue on to the second installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison – in which Davison discusses going to acting school in the '60s, moving to New York, his first movie roles, and more.\n\n[This is the second installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison. To access the first installment, use the above navigation links.]\n\nIGNFF: It's interesting to contrast that with how you had just been within a sort of conformist military school and seeing what that was like – and then you have such a reaction to the idea of being unique for someone not yourself, but yet wholly created within yourself.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, and it was a good place to escape to, too, and I didn't have to be the ordinary man that didn't have a voice. I could be everybody.\n\nIGNFF: And anybody at any time.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I found out later anybody at any time that they'd ask you to be. They'd pay you for – or not. But that started the ride for me. So while I was at Penn State, it really became my passion in my life. I ended up, with the help of these people, and my girlfriend at the time, Theresa – I'd call her my mentor more than anything else. So, she kicked me out and sent me to NYU to the first of what I guess became Tisch school.\n\nIGNFF: So this would be the late '60s?\n\nDAVISON: Mid-'60s. This was Ted Hoffman... Robert Corrigan started the school of the arts over on the lower East Side, 2nd Avenue and 7th Street. It had some really interesting people in that first class – Barry Bostwick, Bud Cort, Jean Berlin, Mary Beth Hurt, Chris Guest.\n\nIGNFF: It certainly was a momentous time to be attending the school.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Melissa Manchester. It was right in the Saint Mark's Place era, just before... things, while I was there, turned kind of s***ty.\n\nIGNFF: Well, what was the culture shock like, moving up to the city at that time?\n\nDAVISON: It was a great birth for me. Bill Duke, you know, was there ... There was one black kid in my school, where I grew up in urban Pennsylvania, and Penn State was pretty white bread at that time, too, except for a few pockets of people. Suddenly I was in the city, and I was just sopping it all up like a sponge.\n\nIGNFF: Thrust into the melting pot.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: Was there any time when you were overwhelmed by it?\n\nDAVISON: Oh yeah. Well, after heading into – this is an interesting story. In the mid-'60s, there became a time... suddenly it was a real time, like it was in San Francisco at the time. It was a real light going on – and the hate and then the drugs started to take their toll. There was a thing called the groovy murders in the Lower East Side. Kids were killed, drugs started turning nasty, and things happened. Then Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were shot ... It was a powerful time, but it was like we lost our way in 1968. Things got really rough. That was when my career began. That's when I first did Lincoln Center. I was graduating, and while I was there, I had a teacher named Carl Weber who was the assistant to Bertolt Brecht, and he got me an audition at Lincoln Center. I ended up with the Lincoln Center Rep Company, playing Tiger at the Gates, and carrying a spear for King Lear ... I got to meet all kinds of people, and I was in the theater. I was in a real theater company with these giant, hallowed halls of Lincoln Center.\n\nIGNFF: Your first professional work?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. While I was in school – and it became a real football... got kicked around between the coup that was going on between the teachers, \"We feel we should keep our students here,\" or \"Our students should be out working,\" and I got caught in the middle of that, because I was the first one kind of out. Other people, like Liz Torres, got a job and said, \"I'm out of here,\" and left. Or Melissa Manchester started a singing career. They wanted to keep the students in there and keep them cocooned, but I sort of squirted out and then I was causing trouble in the school.\n\nIGNFF: Trouble how so?\n\nDAVISON: Well, they just didn't know what to do with a student who was at Lincoln Center appearing onstage at night, and not the greatest student. I remember Ted Hoffman saying, \"You're not a great student, you're a salable commodity right now. I hope someday you become an actor.\"\n\nIGNFF: How do you personally interpret a statement like that?\n\nDAVISON: \"F*** you! I'm a great actor, I may be a salable commodity, but you ain't seen nothing yet. Go f*** yourself.\" Which didn't ...\n\nIGNFF: Didn't endear yourself, I'm sure.\n\nDAVISON: No, he could handle it, Ted could, but some of the other teachers were very offended by my squirting out from their authority, their iron-fisted authority.\n\nIGNFF: At what point did you make the decision to leave that environment?\n\nDAVISON: I stayed. My parents had paid for it, and I remember a real turning point came at Penn State, when I was in summer stock up there. They asked me to come home, and \"What do you think you're doing, making $35 a week? You can't even eat on that. You're exhausted, you're doing lousy in your grades.\" And they said, \"Come home. Get a real job.\" I said, \"Nope, I've got to stay here.\" They said, \"Come home now, or we'll cut you off.\" I said, \"Okay, I guess you have to do that.\" There was a pause on the phone, and they said, \"Okay, if that's what you want to do, we'll support you.\" So I felt I owed it to them to graduate, because it meant a lot to them that I had a degree of some sort, which was now a B.S.A. at NYU after two years at Penn State and three at NYU. During the course of that time, during the summer, I got an agent from this gig that I had at Lincoln Center and I started going out on auditions.\n\nIGNFF: What was the theater scene like at that time?\n\nDAVISON: Well, Lincoln Center had a rep company – Jules Irving, Amy's dad, was running it with Herbert Blau by the time I had come in. But I was there and Elia Kazan had left, but I was there when Jules was running things, and then Amy when she was 11. I had become a part of that family, and it was great. I could come back, and during the course of that time I was out on auditions, and I realized that my school year was coming to an end, and I was really scared. I was living in an apartment, and I wanted to be independent, and my parents had sort of run out of money after four years of college.\n\nIGNFF: So they were ready for you to be independent as well.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Yeah, and I was living in the Lower East Side, it was an apartment that would get busted into every week. Really scared, wearing my seersucker suit and I was auditioning and I'd think, \"Gee, what a horrible life this is turning out to be.\" I remember walking into an audition, and this guy looked just like me – he had the same suit on, only he was in his 50s or 60s. He had white hair, and we were sitting on the bench together and he looked like me. He said, \"How you doing?\" I said, \"Fine.\" He said, \"Trying out for Broadway?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"I've been trying to get on Broadway for 43 years. I hope I do it someday.\" I remember walking down the subway, I was hot and sweaty, and my seersucker suit was sticking to me, and I thought, \"I'm in the wrong hole here.\"\n\nIGNFF: It's not exactly an encouraging moment.\n\nDAVISON: No, it wasn't, and my apartment had just gotten raided again, and I got cleaned out of everything I have with my door kicked in and a bowie knife that I had on the wall stabbed into my bed. I'm thinking, \"I'm glad I wasn't here.\" I thought, \"Oh God.\" I was really frightened and scared. Right at that time, when I was at my lowest, I went in and auditioned for Frank Perry. Last Summer came along, and that was my first part.\n\nIGNFF: Was there a point when you were at your lowest that you thought of just chucking it in and just walking away from it?\n\nDAVISON: Well, I didn't know what else to do.\n\nIGNFF: So, essentially – luckily for you – you had boxed yourself into a corner, as far as your skill set at that time.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, by that time, I was already f***ed – like I am now. I don't know how to do anything else. You know, Jack of all trades, master of none. I'm a great eye surgeon for two weeks, something like that.\n\nIGNFF: Or a politician.\n\nDAVISON: A politician, rat boy...\n\nIGNFF: Whatever the job dictates.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: It's interesting how when you talk about the rep company or about Penn State, that you keep bringing up the idea of family and establishing this sort of family atmosphere. Also, when you talk about seeing the guy who looked like you, 40 years later – the difference being now you are that guy and you have a career and you're not sitting there saying, \"I hope I make it to Broadway one day.\"\n\nDAVISON: No, it's a comforting feeling to have been accepted by my peers, and that didn't happen until 1990. That's a long time to pay. It was always a struggle before that. That's a whole other hour to get into that, I'm sure. After a long time, after Last Summer, which starred the four of us – Cathy Burns, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress of that year and lost to Goldie Hawn, Richard Thomas, Barbara Hershey and myself, made up this quartet. It was great – $300 a week! People that gave me what I needed. After Last Summer, Ted Mann called me to do Ahh Wilderness at the Ford Theater in Washington. I was really anxious to do that, but I got a call to go out to L.A. to audition for The Strawberry Statement – they were interested in me. So, I went to L.A.\n\nIGNFF: Was that a big decision for you to make that trip?\n\nDAVISON: Well, it was made for me by my agent at the time, Bruce Sivan. He said, \"Go out there, I'll give you $500. You can pay me back.\" And I did. I stayed with Hal Gefsky, who was the West Coast Representative of APA at the time. I went in and I didn't know anything about auditioning, except for what you do in New York, which is big and loud. I went in and it was a scene in which I come into the president's office and scream at the secretary. So I went into Irwin Winkler's office and knocked his pens all off his desk, so I had his attention, and just chewed him out. They gave me the part. I called up Ted Mann and I said, \"I'm sorry.\" He said, \"I'm sorry, too. Have a good career in Hollywood.\" So I got sucked into Pinocchio on Pleasure Island, turned into a jackass doing my six pictures as a young star. There's a story that I always tell, because it was also great advice that I didn't heed from Robert Aldridge when I was shooting Ulzana's Raid. It was about my fifth or sixth picture, and he said, \"Kid.\" I was pissed off that Timothy Bottoms had beat me out of The Paper Chase, or something. He said, \"Kid, you don't want to be a leading man. You be a leading man, you'll do six pictures, nobody'll ever hear from you again.\" He says, \"Be a character actor ... play supporting parts. You don't want to hear that, but it's the best advice you'll ever get.\" I didn't want to hear it. I was a star, I wanted to be that, but I got washed up. Richard Gere came along, and De Niro, and suddenly blondes were out and I went back to New York.\n\nIGNFF: Was it a difficult decision, to go back to New York?\n\nDAVISON: Well, I didn't get it right away. I had the drunken '70s to live through, the stoned '70s. I came out during the Manson years... in fact, my agent was at Sharon Tate's funeral when I arrived.\n\nIGNFF: Sort of a portent of things to come...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it was really Pinocchio at Pleasure Island. I turned into a raving jackass. It took me about five or six years, and then I ended up going back to New York, doing theater. I did The Elephant Man, and found my feet again, and then realized I was going to do supporting parts – 100 movies later, here I am.\n\nIGNFF: Was it a realization that felt comfortable when you were finally able to come to that?\n\nDAVISON: Not for a long time, because it was a young kid who had had everything and lost it – at least in my mind. I always worked, but you know, I would do a lot of s**t to pay the bills for things that I had purchased like houses and stuff. But in my mind, I wasn't in that position – I went back to New York and I would do independent films that nobody ever saw, like Short Eyes, which now finally people are finally seeing. Short Eyes, I think, is my finest work as a young man, but nobody saw it.\n\nIGNFF: It's a wonderful picture, and it's one of those things that gets rediscovered.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, that came after Willard. I was going back to New York.\n\nIGNFF: At that time, when you talk about the choices you made, what were the factors that lead to the choices you made? What was your decision making process for accepting a role at that time?\n\nDAVISON: Well it had less to do with career and more to do with, \"How can I live? How can I survive? How can I still be, if I call myself an artist in any way, how can I justify that?\" – because I'd made a real mess of that in Hollywood. The answer was theater, going back and doing stuff there. The film stuff that came out of New York.\n\nIGNFF: Were you the type of person who saw theater as an art and movies and TV as a bastardization of that art?\n\nDAVISON: Well, it wasn't so much that, because no, I did some good stuff on TV, because there was some good stuff being done. It wasn't a question of that – but I did a lot of crap, too. You know, weekly crap. I remember when I was doing Harry and the Hendersons as a TV series later, but that's another story. I remember a carpenter on the show, and he said, \"I like to make my furniture in my real work, but I like to find cabinet work. I watch you – you're damn good,\" He says. \"This must be like making crates for you.\" I've made a lot of crates.\n\nIGNFF: Was there a moment when you resigned yourself to the idea of being an actor and having to make a living meant that you have to make crates at the same time?\n\nDAVISON: There's a lot of different advice you would get from people. I'd have some friends that would never work – they were waiting for that one piece of art. They'd go all year, and nothing would happen.\n\nIGNFF: What lesson did that teach you – besides wanting to eat?\n\nDAVISON: That I'd go crazy waiting for the perfect role. Then there were people like Anthony Quinn who said, \"Do everything. Do everything. Everything that comes your way – do it. You don't know what's going to be good, you don't know what's going to be s**t. Do it.\" That was Anthony Quinn's career. He was a character actor, you know. Then I followed him in that respect.\n\nIGNFF: How important a role was economics in the decisions?\n\nDAVISON: Oh, God. It came and went. It came more when I got married and had a family, then it became more important to me to make that. But I don't know... that's sort of dead end, too. You can't do that. You just can't get caught up in stuff, which I spent a long time doing. I'm trying to free myself from that a bit now.\n\nIGNFF: How do you free yourself from that?\n\nDAVISON: Well, you know, got a house, got kids, and whatever life comes along now, there's enough there to take care of itself, and I don't need to keep building the house ... I can start to pursue my craft again, because I've gotten to a point in my life where I've got to really decide what I want and what I need. What that is, is to care about my work.\n\nIGNFF: Do you think you've reached a level of flexibility in your career where you can concentrate on other things?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I think I can now. But it's taken a little bit of time. Because after Longtime Companion, I got another rush – I got put in a higher class of possibilities. Some of which paid off, some of which didn't. But I had an opportunity to do it. I just had an opportunity to do a good role in a film playing with two of my heroes, Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman – The Runaway Jury, down in New Orleans. But I guess I'm getting way ahead of myself.\n\nContinue on to the third installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison – in which Davison discusses working on The Strawberry Statement, Willard, Longtime Companion, and more.\n\n[This is the third installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison. To access previous installments, use the above navigation links.]\n\nIGNFF: Speaking briefly about The Strawberry Statement – that had also reunited you with Bud Cort, right?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: Was it an odd thing to now be in a professional context.\n\nDAVISON: Jeannie Berlin... Jeannie played a small part in the film, too. It was amazing. I remember I fell in love with Kim Darby, and we were riding in the backseat. We were just in the beginning of our 20s, and she had just done True Grit, and we were sitting in the backseat, and the AD turned around, and he was just beaming. I said, \"What are you looking at?\" He said, \"I just love to see young people in the beginning of their prime – it's so wonderful.\" I thought, \"Jesus, is that what this is? I'm so in pain all the time. Why am I so insecure and unsure of myself?\"\n\nIGNFF: Where did your insecurities stem from – in craft, or in career?\n\nDAVISON: No, never in craft. I was always an arrogant asshole and thought I knew everything as a kid. It was as I got older that I realized I didn't know anything, and that I'd better pull my s**t together. I just thought I knew everything, that I was better than everyone – \"Oh, I can do better than that.\" I kind of remember with Robert Aldridge and Burt Lancaster, taking a page in the script that had been rewritten and throwing them. \"Yeah! This is s**t!\" Aldridge says to me, \"Kid, I'm glad I've got you now and not six pictures from now. You'd be f***ing impossible. You should direct your own movies. I mean that as a compliment.\"\n\nIGNFF: Was it career then that you were insecure with, or just as a person?\n\nDAVISON: Just as a person. I mean, I became an actor to be somebody else. So it was all about nothing in the center of the onion except this first act romance, which I was always really good at.\n\nIGNFF: So essentially a fear that you would be found out...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, the fraud that I really was.\n\nIGNFF: Following the chronology of your career in Hollywood – Willard was an interesting role.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, yeah. Really quite interesting.\n\nIGNFF: And it's become quite an iconic film.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Well, it was interesting, because I was coming off of Strawberry Statement and being this sort of romantic, leading boy-man, and I kissed that rat and it was over. I was creep-o for 10, 15 years.\n\nIGNFF: Did you realize that at the time?\n\nDAVISON: No.\n\nIGNFF: Did it seem like just another choice?\n\nDAVISON: No, it was a great script, and I wanted to play that part. It was a great part. I really wanted to explore the weirdness of it all.\n\nIGNFF: Did you regret it in hindsight, at the time?\n\nDAVISON: No. I've never managed to really regret any of it, finally now, looking back on it. At different times, you know, I would like to go back and have made different choices. I would have like to have worked with Sam Fuller and Dalton Trumbo when they asked me, but I didn't. I missed that opportunity and I'm sorry now and I didn't know any history. When I first came to town, I was dating a girl named Maggie Wellman, and her dad happened to be Wild Bill, William H., one of the founders of Hollywood. I got to meet him, and he was great. Especially stories and things that I would hear from him that would come out decades later. And also, how to have integrity in making films. I said, \"Why did you quit?\" He said, \"Television. Master shot, over the shoulder, over the shoulder, done by lunch. Move on. They've got to realize, follow the bouncing ball. The bouncing ball is the essence of your scene, whatever it is. I remember getting into this big fight with Zanuck over Ox-Bow Incident, where he wanted a close-up of Fonda with tears reading a letter, and I wanted the f***ing letter. It's about the letter. That cowboy hat's in front of his face, and Zanuck wanted Fonda to come back and do a close-up with tears. Fonda, bless his heart, didn't do it. That's what it is. Follow the bouncing ball.\" I've always thought of that when directing my own films.\n\nIGNFF: Sort of the difference between craft and commerce.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, if you can get away with it and get it done by lunch.\n\nIGNFF: So there'll always be commerce as a part of ...\n\nDAVISON: Well, it is. It's show business.\n\nIGNFF: Was it something that you realized at the time?\n\nDAVISON: I've always realized it ... I haven't realized how to do it very well ... At that time, I pissed off everybody.\n\nIGNFF: Was there any moment where you realized the impression you were making on people, or was it all after the fact when the damage had been done?\n\nDAVISON: Sometimes, it was a vague reference, but I didn't really have anybody that watched out for me very well when I got to Hollywood. I was a young kid, and I didn't take real good care of myself. I was always set up with some actress somewhere, usually living with one. Ended up with Sarah Miles on the beach in Malibu, which was the real kind of time I really crashed and burned. That was mid-'70s – '74, '75.\n\nIGNFF: So sort of as your perceived career at that time was crashing and burning.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I had just done Mame, and it was terrible. I went off to do some theater with Sarah in Chicago, and I ended up with her. She was sort of coming off her scandals. I thought, \"Oh, how delightful.\"\n\nIGNFF: So things really dovetailed poorly for you.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. The mid-'70s I could live without. Really, right up to 1980 was a pretty rough time for me. I was still doing a lot of pot, smoking and drinking and carrying on. The tail was growing, the ears were growing.\n\nIGNFF: Did it ever get worse than that?\n\nDAVISON: Well, there've been some hard times, you know. But not that I couldn't handle. I got to the point... I remember getting to the point where that was about it. I was doing a movie called The Last Survivors.\n\nIGNFF: Irony of ironies.\n\nDAVISON: Marty Sheen and a whole bunch of people remaking Abandon Ship, a TV movie. We were all wet and cold and I had fringe – I was the coke-addled rock star in the boat. Unfortunately, I was one of the last survivors. Didn't say anything, just rowed a lot. That was really a bad time. I was really scraping along there.\n\nIGNFF: At what point did you realize that you were at your lowest?\n\nDAVISON: Overlooking Malibu, old North Malibu road. I remember being up there at night, thinking, \"This is it. This is really bottom.\" But I had more bottom to go. I ended up in New York with a girl who woke up crying one morning and I didn't know why, and she said, \"You don't remember?\" And I didn't. And I just threw it all down the toilet. It was 1980, and that was it.\n\nIGNFF: Was it a difficult decision?\n\nDAVISON: It was difficult in the not going back to it, because I really wanted to get numb, and really wanted to go unconscious and really wanted to feel euphoric a little bit, but the euphoria time was over for me, for that.\n\nIGNFF: Did you have any support system around you at the time?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, then I went into AA. But, you know, you don't want to hear this. Every f***ing interview talks about this. Just figure, the '70s, I was just like everybody else. I went through all of that s**t and that's a boring cliché.\n\nIGNFF: How does it affect your career at that point? Did it more affect your choices, or how other people perceived you – despite what the choices were as far as casting agents or directors?\n\nDAVISON: I don't know. I seemed to bump along, and suddenly I was more tentative, more aware, and angry. Really pissed off.\n\nIGNFF: More at yourself, or at others?\n\nDAVISON: Everything. I was like a nerve end for a couple of years. But I kept working and doing stuff, and after that – let's see, 1980, 1981 – I did a lot of stuff in movies for TV and plays. Then I ended up doing Glass Menagerie with Jessica Tandy on Broadway, with Amanda Plummer and John Heard. That was a rough patch... my mother was dying at that time, too. So I'd go home and play Tom for real from Sunday night until Tuesday afternoon, then I'd come back and perform and I couldn't touch it. I couldn't get near to it until my mother died.\n\nIGNFF: Was it helpful at all having that particular role?\n\nDAVISON: No. Well, I guess it was helpful. It gave me a place to put my stuff, but I couldn't really touch it. I was just a zombie walking through this part, because I was living in it. It was just too close to me. I didn't know how to deal with the pain, because I was numb about the pain. The pain was home, the dam didn't break for me until she died. I was real good when I came back afterwards.\n\nIGNFF: When the dam broke, would you say that it was more than just a turning point for the performance itself? It seems like everything was sort of building up and culminating towards a point where you could feel again in any role. You talk about being a zombie, you essentially were a zombie in the '70s and then the dam broke when your mother had passed.\n\nDAVISON: You know, it was interesting because the life experience that a kid has really needs the maturity of pain. Really needs it. So, by the time I got to Longtime Companion, which came seven years later, I didn't have to do anything. I just relived that scene, that moment, because I relived that with my mother. She was hanging on and it was time to let her go. She in turn said, \"Do good work,\" she was ready to go but she wouldn't go. So, real easy to do. Was that hard? No, that was sort of easy. Hard is getting the big foot on the dam. Making something funny, and it's not.\n\nIGNFF: So would you say that Longtime Companion was a role that you couldn't have done during the '70s?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I didn't have the maturity. The younger guys, I was sort of Mary Worth in that part. The other guys were Campbell Scott, and Mary-Louise.\n\nIGNFF: Did you have any regrets that you weren't in that position, or were you satisfied and happy with it?\n\nDAVISON: You know, it's really interesting, because as you get older, you really have a sense – like I said, when I was that age, I was in a lot of pain, a lot of agony. But I got older, and put aside a lot of my more childish concerns. I feel better now than I've ever felt, really.\n\nIGNFF: As far as in all aspects of your life?\n\nDAVISON: Well, I certainly would like to be young, run 20 miles and be able to f*** 5 times a day, but you know, I don't do that anymore. I've sat in the third row at the Academy Awards and had my shot, and won 2 Golden Globes and Independent Spirit Awards, and a lot of L.A. Drama Critics awards, and been nominated for an Emmy for directing and for acting. It's all great. I don't have to prove so much anymore to myself that I can do it, that I'm up there with my peers. Even if I may not achieve major stardom, I'm a working actor who gets to do good stuff.\n\nIGNFF: What is it like getting that sort of recognition from your peers?\n\nDAVISON: It's great. You suddenly can let go of feeling that you haven't achieved something in your life and you can say, \"Okay, this is fine.\" Still doesn't fill the hole, but it's great and I know that I'm in a place where I can let go of false desires about how that could fix my life.\n\nIGNFF: How much of a construct in your life is that hole? Wholly within your own mind?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, yeah.\n\nIGNFF: It's kind of odd that the internal hole would be reactive to external recognition. At what point did you personally let it go? Was it Longtime Companion?\n\nDAVISON: It's interesting, not during the filming. During the filming, we were up there shooting the let go scene with the woman, and saying, \"We've got to get out of here.\" We've been telling everybody it's a murder mystery – not a movie about AIDS – and I remember Lindsey Law... us trying to get another grand off of him so we could pay somebody off so we could do our location. Making $500 a week on the picture. I never thought anybody'd ever see it. I just knew it was something I had to do. But while I was doing that, I looked down on the street and the whole of Riverside Drive was covered in snow, and it wasn't snow, because it was summer. But there were trucks and wagons and everything. I went down and saw my friend, Ron Silver – he was down there on the Blue Steel film, and I felt so envious. I thought, \"Wow, I wish we had this. I wish I was starring in a big movie.\" A year later, we're sitting at the awards and Ron was there for the movie about Claus von Bulow. I said, \"What happened to that picture?\" He said, \"Ah, it went belly-up right away.\" We're sitting at the awards and he's just smiling at me. He said, \"You were envious.\" That's when it all sort of came together for me, because here I was. You know, it was sort of a horse race, between me and Joe Pesci. I got the National Film Critics, he got the L.A. Film Critics, and the Academy Award. So it was sort of back and forth. It was quite a night. I remember tipping the limo guy, and I said, \"Ten bucks is all I've got.\" And he was crying. He was crying! He said, \"Thanks.\" I was standing in the parking lot and Gregory Peck puts his arm around my shoulder and says, \"I had to come here six times before I got mine. You'll be back.\" I said, \"You had a studio. But, thank you, Greg.\" I really appreciated that.\n\nIGNFF: At what point does that envy end? Does it ever end?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it ended for me. I think it really has, because I did the rubber chicken circuit for three, four months. The whole campaign and everything else. I went through it, and I met all these wonderful people ... With winning comes a lot more responsibilities, and it's harder to shop at the hardware store. I'm fine where I am. I feel good about that. But, at the same time, I always wish I had more opportunity so I could have better choices.\n\nIGNFF: When you talk about the \"campaign season\" for the Oscars, is it awkward to essentially be going around saying, for all intents and purposes, \"Pat me on the back. I'm better than the other guy...\"?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, you don't say that. What you say is, \"It's wonderful to be in a crowd of such astounding actors. It doesn't matter who wins, it's getting nominated.\"\n\nIGNFF: In some ways, even though it's a disappointment to lose, is it almost a relief that that sort of pressure is over?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it was a great relief. Once it happened, I felt this kind of peace. Once Joe Pesci won, I felt this great peace that, \"Okay, we're done for a while.\" But it was interesting, the next day, my agent was on the phone to the guy, I had a part that they were interested in me and suddenly they said, \"He was nominated for an Academy Award and he didn't win. The part goes to somebody who won.\"\n\nIGNFF: Now how do you deal with that?\n\nDAVISON: I deal with it as the reality of the business, and it's not as hurtful as it was that made me crazy when I was in my 20s. I already went through that in my late 20s. I got pretty washed up, it was over for me. I was sitting there, looking at the ocean, thinking, \"This is it. I'm done.\"\n\nIGNFF: So you realized it's not a reflection on the work, because 9 times out of 10 they didn't take the time to look at the work anyway.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I know that.\n\nContinue on to the fourth installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison – in which Davison discusses filming the Harry and the Hendersons TV series, being known as X-Men's Senator Kelly, working with Robert Altman, and more.\n\n[This is the fourth installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison. To access previous installments, use the above navigation links.]\n\nIGNFF: How did Longtime Companion and coming off an Oscar nomination lead to Harry and the Hendersons?\n\nDAVISON: I was already in it, before Longtime Companion had a distribution deal. I was already in it, and I was suddenly with the William Morris agency, who were begging me to leave after the first year. My friend, Steven Spielberg – who I grew up with – was in charge of it and I thought he'd have something to do with it, which he never did. I was in love with all my cast and crew and everybody was family. My leading guy that played Harry died. It was really interesting, because Kevin Peter Hall had AIDS and was in the hospital. I would say, \"I feel like such a fraud here, being well...\" and he said, \"You get to tell my story. I don't get that chance. That's your job.\" So that made it okay for me. Then when Tom Hanks the following year – I heard him say the same thing at the Golden Globes. I told him about Kevin, and he said, \"Thank you. Thank you for that, because it really made a difference.\" It's our job, to be the unsingable heart song the ordinary man may feel but never utter.\n\nIGNFF: Do you think that if you compared the mentality you had earlier in your career, when the ego was bigger, to the one you had as you got older and realized work and career – that the commitment was different? To actually be sticking through something because you had a family and other people depended on you as much as you depended on them?\n\nDAVISON: Right, well that changes everything you know. But, for that time, I don't think so. I always thought I was a New York actor and wanted to do whatever edgy stuff I could have a chance to do. Hence Short Cuts or Longtime Companion or whatever. I really always loved parts with characters in great journeys. Jeffrey Dahmer's dad I just got to do. Nobody saw that, but there's a great little scene in there – how did this guy survive having a monster for a son?\n\nIGNFF: Do you approach certain projects differently? Let's say, Harry and the Hendersons...\n\nDAVISON: I didn't want to leave, because if I left, everybody would be out of work. That's 100 people that depended on me staying there.\n\nIGNFF: But it also afforded you some possibilities like directing, right?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I got to direct. It paid nicely, there was that. But my main reason was that every single person, not nary a one, was a good soul. We had fights over scripts and things, but it was always fights with people you love.\n\nIGNFF: Again, it's interesting how you keep coming back to family.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I guess so. Always better. A big thing in my life.\n\nIGNFF: When you come off a series like that, what is the perception of others when you're trying to get roles?\n\nDAVISON: It's up to the casting director. If they're a kid, it's the last thing they saw. They never heard of Willard before the remake. They never heard of Short Eyes. They heard of Oz, but you know.\n\nIGNFF: \"You're that guy in X-Men.\"\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, that's who they all think of me as, Senator Kelly, this guy who melts. And that's kind of unfortunate.\n\nIGNFF: How is that balanced between, \"I actually have a large body of work besides this,\" to \"At least I'm recognized\"?\n\nDAVISON: Right. Well, if they look on the Internet, they could check me out.\n\nIGNFF: That would be research.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, if somebody is like that. But you never know what's on people's minds. I sat in an audition with David Carradine and Stacy Keach and Richard Masur and Joe Spano, and Ronnie Cox and Robert Gunton – all of us sitting in the room, waiting to do this audition. None of us got the job! Times are weird. I think David's going to have a good hit with Quentin's new movie coming out.\n\nIGNFF: Kill Bill, I think it is?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, the Charlie's Angels kind of on acid thing.\n\nIGNFF: Now, when you talk about your choices in the '90s, what was your determining factor? I mean, you were allowed a little more flexibility than you were in the '80s.\n\nDAVISON: Right. Well, I had the guts to go up to Bob Altman at a party. He'd always terrified me, and I was scared of him. Now, suddenly, I'm at a party and I'm an Oscar nominee and I go up to him and I say, \"I've been wanting to work with you for 25 years. I'll read the phone book – I'll do anything.\" And then the next day I get a call and my agents say, \"You know we've been trying to get you this interview with Bob Altman. We got it!\" Yeah, right... thanks, guys.\n\nIGNFF: \"Do you think you could bump us up to 11%?\"\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, let's bump this up – actually not, because it was Short Cuts, and everybody worked for – it was a big ensemble kind of deal, which everybody wanted the same thing. To work in a great film of Altman, which I think it's one of his best. People agree or disagree, but it's really structured. Unfortunately it's three and half hours long, but like he said, \"You know, you can't cut it. All this stuff is great, and it all has a story. Each one has a story.\" So I got to work with him. He called me up, he said, \"Jeff Daniels fell out, do you want to do this?\" I said, \"Yeah!\"\n\nIGNFF: What was it like working on an Altman set in his operating style?\n\nDAVISON: Well, I was terrified. I came in, I was the first one to shoot, and I was shooting with Jerry Dunphy doing commentary, and he wanted me to play one of the owners of the station that reads these things badly. So I figured, \"Oh Jesus Christ. Okay, I've got to read the news badly.' I figured I'd listen to these guys, like George Nicolah in which every word has the same emphasis as the next, and each word is as important, and everything. So I was doing that. I was looking at him, and he says, \"Okay, let's do the next one.\" Okay, so I do the next one bad, about Mother Theresa or something, and we do the next one. He says, \"Okay. That's it.\" I thought, \"Are you going to fire me?\" I said, \"Was that good?\" He says, \"I don't know, you're the actor. I hired you. Whatever you do, that's good.\"\n\nIGNFF: In your mind, how do you interpret that?\n\nDAVISON: I interpret that as I'm worth something. He wants me to contribute to his film. He wants me to be part of his ensemble. He wants me to come up with lines ... and we did. Andie MacDowell and I were doing a thing. She was looking at a thing, and I'm going off to work and there's five other characters around the pool, and she says, \"Well, I'm looking at catalogues here.\" And I said, \"Read me this thing. Okay, you want to buy some of bearded Irises.\" And I'm out the door, and I say, \"Okay, I'll see your bearded Iris when I get home tonight,\" which I thought was kind of funny. He said, \"Yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah – do that.\" Okay, and we're over in the corner of the frame, and we're in and we're out, but here's Robert Altman following the bouncing ball, which is introducing all of these characters. It was great, it was really wonderful. A part I don't know if I could do again, having a little boy.\n\nIGNFF: How so?\n\nDAVISON: Well, Andie MacDowell and I have a little boy that gets hit by a car, and he was in a coma, and we were waiting for him to come out.\n\nIGNFF: So as far as the emotional resonance ...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, and then he comes out, and dies. I just so couldn't go there again.\n\nIGNFF: How much does that affect you?\n\nDAVISON: Well, it depends on how deep you get into it.\n\nIGNFF: Do you tend to go deep?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I do. I had an acting teacher that said, \"You know, you can recall a wretched emotion, you can move the muscles of your eyes and learn how to do that, or you can hide an onion in your handkerchief.\" I always prefer the onion when I can get away with it. All the great moments – Stella is all onions, through the banister.\n\nIGNFF: Which do you prefer?\n\nDAVISON: The onion if I can get away with it. It's all wretched emotions, but at the same time, you never know. And the same thing in film – it's so difficult, because there are 50 guys are waiting around for you to cry, and they're looking at their watch. Yeah, you're really going to get there. So whatever works. But at the same time, I did this film, King Is Alive, and it was all handheld DVD improv and stuff. And, you know, you're shooting for an hour, and all that stuff gets real, because you've had 10 minutes to work yourself into it. I was working with a great actress, Janet McTeer, too.\n\nIGNFF: Do you find yourself more often than not, not able to resort to the onion?\n\nDAVISON: I'll do anything I can. I'll do anything I can. I won't tell you what it is. Whatever it is, I don't know. Sometimes it's different, sometimes it's real, sometimes it ain't.\n\nIGNFF: Do you ever find yourself where you can't find a touchstone?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, in Short Eyes. I remember sitting there, and I was banging my head against the wall. Robert M. Young, bless his heart, he's the greatest, he gave me a great moment. Norman Rene, in Longtime Companion, did the same thing. Robert Young looked at me and he said, \"You're not going to match, if you have a lump on your head.\" I said, \"It's a 15-minute monologue that stops this film dead. I've gotta tell my life story, and I've got to start hysterical, crying.\" He said, \"Listen, pal, you're there. Forget the stage directions, you're there. Roll it.\" We got it, it was one take – boom. That's all he needed to say, \"You're enough,\" and suddenly I was free, and I could just jump off the cliff.\n\nIGNFF: How much of that was due to where your head was at, at the time?\n\nDAVISON: Well, I was torn. I was in the tombs for two months, with real guys, with my pants down around my ankles, with real felons saying, \"I hope we get this shot before lunch, I'm getting f***ing horny.\" That's as real as we get. \"Did we wash out this toilet before we dunk his head in it?\"\n\nIGNFF: That's a union thing.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, that was a union thing, but it was an independent film, so f*** the union. The first director who was, bless his heart, incapable, was told by the cast that if he came back up there to direct, they'd kill him. So we got Bob Young, and he was wonderful. He was wonderful, he was patient with everybody. Most of the guys are dead now. One guy got murdered ... and another guy got a refrigerator dumped on him. Another guy got his head split open breaking into an apartment in White Plains. They're all gone. O.D.'ed\n\nIGNFF: It's a riveting film, to say the least.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, and those guys are all gone. I think Joe Carberry's still around, and Jose Perez is still around.\n\nIGNFF: Is it a film that you could do now?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, sure. If I were young enough, if I were younger. If I was a young guy, I mean, Clark Davis could be older, too, but he's got to be kind of young and sympathetic.\n\nIGNFF: Within the same parameters, could you do another film like it?\n\nDAVISON: Sure. I'm doing an independent Sundance film up in Washington State now, by this young girl, and it's another sort of freebie. It's a Sundance experimental film, but she's written it from her heart, and it's really an interesting, gripping story.\n\nIGNFF: Is there anything that you did earlier in your career that you think, \"I couldn't get to that place now\"?\n\nDAVISON: I don't think so. I think I could get to more places now. As a kid, I was trying, I was working. I remember Burt Lancaster, sitting out in the desert, saying, \"Son, come over here, sit by my rock. You're a hell of an actor, that goes without saying. But I would feel remiss if I didn't give you some advice. You don't use your rehearsal time. You try to give a performance for the soundman. And you give a performance for the man laying the marks. And you give a performance for the girl extras hanging over there. Comes time for your close-ups, you've shot your wad. You can't try to come all at once, you have to give a bit of it here, a bit of it in the thigh here – you build. Then you have a performance. You work with what you've got. I've got the baby blues, the pearly whites. I work with them.\" He was trying to calm me down, because I would think, \"Oh, I'm acting the f*** off the screen, man!\" We're standing there, I'm acting! I'm really acting! And he's just standing there. Then I look at the rushes, and there was this whippet bouncing around a bulldog. Burt's just grounded, Burt knows who he is. I don't have a f***ing clue who I am. I'm just ACTING!\n\nIGNFF: And you're not playing to the camera.\n\nDAVISON: No, I'm mad about that guy being killed! So I'm acting it! \"Just accept it as part of the desert. Like, hate the desert because there's no water in it.\" Who are you watching? You're watching Burt.\n\nIGNFF: So it's the difference between acting and being...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. But the advice he was giving me, it broke my heart when I read the book, because – and I used this quote for the girl who wrote the book about Burt – because it was another great moment in my life and I was arrogant and I thought I knew everything. But Burt was giving me heartwarming advice that he had won the hard way. Because when Burt Lancaster was a young kid, he was a trapeze artist, and he was all over, and everything was big, and everything was all over! Then as he got older and got working more, when he did The Train, he didn't have to do anything. He was just Burt. He had to win the Academy Award with Elmer Gantry first, before he could just be Burt.\n\nIGNFF: Before he had the confidence...\n\nDAVISON: To just stand there. That last moment in The Train, with his back ... with him and Paul Scofield – who I got to work with later when I did The Crucible – but, he didn't do anything. Just his back says everything.\n\nIGNFF: Was it difficult for you to take advice at that time?\n\nDAVISON: Probably so. It was difficult for me to take advice from anybody. I was an arrogant kid. And it's interesting, because I've given advice to kids now, I'm that age, and it's interesting to see that reflected. But they'll remember years later.\n\nIGNFF: So someone will be talking about the conversation they had with Bruce on the set of X-Men ...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I'm an old sage, you know ...\n\nIGNFF: But there is experience there, and mistakes that were made that hopefully other people won't.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Save yourself some wear and tear as a kid. I mean, that's the part I wish. I wish I didn't have to beat myself so much when I was so young and had a lot of things going for me.\n\nIGNFF: Is it difficult for you to see other actors, seemingly on that same path?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, sometimes.\n\nIGNFF: There have been actors that you've worked with that have gone astray in the interim...\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: Is it anything where you feel a sort of, \"Hey, listen, calm down a bit.\"\n\nDAVISON: Well, if I'm asked. But it's not my place to interfere. An actor telling another actor how to act when a director is directing a movie is a no-no. You don't do that. If I'm ever asked for advice or something, I will mention it. Actors have done that, and I don't think my advice is any more worthy than somebody else's. But I certainly make observances during the course of some films.\n\nContinue on to the fifth installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison – in which Davison discusses working with Bryan Singer, working with Dustin Hoffman & Gene Hackman on The Runaway Jury, and more.\n\n[This is the fifth installment of Ken Plume's interview with Bruce Davison. To access previous installments, use the above navigation links.]\n\nIGNFF: A bigger part I remember seeing you in in recent years was your role in Apt Pupil.\n\nDAVISON: Oh, was that a big part?\n\nIGNFF: Well, it was a noticeable part.\n\nDAVISON: Interesting. I did it because Brad Renfro wanted me to play his dad. I had worked with him in The Cure when he was 12. I said to Bryan (Singer) at one time, \"If you ever do something big, think of me.\" And guess what Bryan did?\n\nIGNFF: That wouldn't happen to be X-Men, would it?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, how about that for a standup guy?\n\nIGNFF: I can delicately ask this question – there's been a lot of reports about problems on the X2 set. There have been stories of a cast mutiny against Bryan and producer problems with him as well. What is your perception?\n\nDAVISON: Well, X2 I just have a little bit in, so I'm just up for a few days ... But my feeling about Bryan is this. Bryan is really a director. He's very good at getting the results that he wants. He has trouble communicating to actors sometimes. He doesn't quite know the delicacy of that instrument. Sometimes, and it really is, actors have a tendency – I always remember the quote from Hemingway about Scott Fitzgerald's talent. He said it's like the dust on the wings of a butterfly. You breathe on it too hard and you'll destroy it. And that's true. Now, also, you've got a lot of people that through X-Men and stuff are in a stronger position as actors, then when we did the first film. So, you know, there's all kinds of dynamics involved in it. I know Bryan works real hard to get that, to get a delicacy there, but it doesn't come easy to him. He's young and he's learning about that. But I've got to say this about Bryan Singer – he is a standup guy. I'll tell you a perfect example. On the film, I remember him standing up to the crew one time and saying, \"I'm sorry if I've offended anybody or if I've hurt anybody if I've had any kind of outburst, it's just that this film is so important to me and I just want it to be so good. And that's why we're all working together.\" And some old crew guy said, \"Oh, f*** you, Bryan. We love you! Let's go back to work.\" And that's it. Bryan is a good, standup guy, and I'd always work with him. We may have difficulty communicating the emotion of a scene sometime, but he'll eventually get it. He'll get the scene. It's just, you know, his ability sometimes – I would say that's the problem. I don't care who the actor is. An actor is a delicate, delicate instrument. You can tell Ian McKellen, you can rattle him – \"Oh, God! I've forgotten how to act!\"\n\nIGNFF: Had you heard any rumblings as far as X2 is concerned?\n\nDAVISON: No, I didn't hear any rumblings when I was up there. I was up there in June or July, and everybody was talking about how well things were going. So I'm not a party to any of it, really.\n\nIGNFF: How would you say working with Bryan on X-Men or X2 is different than when you worked with him on Apt Pupil?\n\nDAVISON: I found Bryan, when I worked with him, much more mellow, calmer. He's always involved in the specificity of the result. Something could be an inch off, and he'll see it and he'll want it changed and he'll want it fixed. Then you see the film and you get it, you know what that was all about. I had big fights with him, because I wanted to go down the drain. I wanted a shot at the drain. Let me just roll down the drain here. \"No, you can't. You have to die, or else the machine would work, and that defeats the whole purpose.\" And I would say, \"So what? So what if the machine works?\"\n\nIGNFF: But they still brought you back.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, after a fashion. I'm Mystique.\n\nIGNFF: But you're in the film.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah ... I'm thrilled to be in it! I'd like to have more to do.\n\nIGNFF: How do you feel about the sort of mainstream aspect of that – the action figures?\n\nDAVISON: The mainstream aspect of that? Well, if it's good. I'll tell you what's the mainstream aspect that will make it work or not, is if you care about the characters and it's not all special effects. That matters a lot to Bryan. It's got to be character-driven, and I think he's got a hold of a really good story to character drive this, that you'll care about the characters. You'll care about the bad guys, you'll care about the seemingly good guys, and that makes it work. It's like Willard. You've got to care about the characters, to make whatever you're doing – with rats, or special effects, or rocket ships – work. My leading saying, too – I wanted to do Lathe of Heaven for a long time, direct that as a film, and that kind of got away from me, and they remade it and it didn't work.\n\nIGNFF: That's putting it mildly.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it just didn't work. I kept trying to say that this is a comedy. If I directed this, it's got to be a comedy. This is funny stuff.\n\nIGNFF: You know, there's always a chance for another remake.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I got a letter from Ursula saying, \"We've got to make a film someday.\" I remember her not being able to make her Earthsea Trilogy because they couldn't come up with a good dragon. But now they've done that. This was back down when we made Lathe of Heaven originally.\n\nIGNFF: How would you have seen that process with today's technology being different?\n\nDAVISON: The Earthsea Trilogy or Lathe of Heaven? Well, you don't need special effects. That's why I wanted to do the original Lathe of Heaven. We came up with a – we had a Styrofoam alien that would look like s**t. I said, \"Well, let's smoke it up, backlight it, and I'll be a naked dream that comes through it, and I'll do the voice myself.\" We'd come up with stuff like that. Or Kevin. \"How can we cut 12 pages of dialogue, and me putting you out here?\" I said, \"Well, why don't you just reach in my pocket like you're taking something out, put it on my neck, and I'll be out.\" So we'd look across the table, \"Oh yes, science fiction's great.\" And that was on the fly. That was sort of Sam Fuller shooting Lathe of Heaven, which is how it should be done – if you care about the characters.\n\nIGNFF: Well, do you think that's one of the problems in today's special effects age?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. It's like when people discovered perspective in painting. Suddenly, it was about all these pillars and s**t that had perspective and who gave a f*** about the painting? Unless there was some engaging something to draw your eye, something to really engage you to captivate you, to be part of you.\n\nIGNFF: Especially when you see an entire film of perspective pillars like the Star Wars prequels.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. My son is taught by a woman who loves Star Wars, but she only teaches the fourth, fifth and sixth episodes. He comes home and he has all these test questions – he's in first grade – one of the questions is, \"In A New Hope, Obi-Wan Kenobi did something that was really Jedi. What was it?\" The answer is he has sacrificed himself. So he gets metaphysics and social consciousness and spelling and math all from Star Wars. He says it's not been the same since Joseph Campbell died.\n\nIGNFF: It's fascinating when you talk about that difference between character and pizzazz.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, it's got to be character.\n\nIGNFF: Function over form.\n\nDAVISON: Right.\n\nIGNFF: What was it like working on Runaway Jury?\n\nDAVISON: It was great. Oh, it was wonderful. I don't know how much I'm going to be in the film, because I'm the bad lawyer, but it was wonderful. We got to work on closing and opening our arguments, and working with Dustin is great. It's always a very interesting tennis match, but I love it. He says, \"Oh yeah! Do that! It's great, man! Do that!\" I do it, and you try to top that. It was great.\n\nIGNFF: And how often would you top Dustin?\n\nDAVISON: It was interesting, because there'd be a moment when he would start ad-libbing about the client or something, and I immediately would get up and object, outrageously ... So, I'd object, and he'd start screaming, and I'd start screaming and the director's just shaking his head in his hands. But, you know, then there's juice in the scene. Good stuff, you know. I don't know if any of it's going to be in the movie, he just may be running the camera with no film in it, but I sure had fun working with Dustin. Gene Hackman is just a rock. He's so intimidating and wonderful.\n\nIGNFF: I've never gotten a sense of what he's like off-camera.\n\nDAVISON: Well, that's tough. I really like him. I really like him. He's a solid guy, he's as solid as they get. I remember when I first saw him in college, he was in a movie called Lilith and he had one little scene, I think it was his first movie. I'm watching this love story, with Warren Beatty, and going on and on and suddenly – there's this guy on the screen, and he's just, \"Whoa!\" and then he's gone. It was like, \"Whoa!\" and Warren obviously got that, too, because he hired him as Buck for his greatest film.\n\nIGNFF: I think it's interesting that Gene always seems to be the leading character actor.\n\nDAVISON: I've always admired him. I have this baseball that I have signed by three people, and one more and I'll be retiring it. I have Paul Scofield, Dustin Hoffman, and Gene Hackman. Waiting for Robert Duvall, and then that'll be it, probably. They're my heroes as actors.\n\nIGNFF: What is the one through line?\n\nDAVISON: Power. I think power is the character actor. Great power in men, and depth of truth. I mean, you listen to Paul Scofield, and he's just – I mean, I remember his Lear, it just came from a volcano somewhere.\n\nIGNFF: When did he sign the ball?\n\nDAVISON: I think when we did The Crucible.\n\nIGNFF: What was the idea behind getting the baseball signed?\n\nDAVISON: Just an idea. I had the one from The X-Men, but it all washed off. I could've made a lot on eBay.\n\nIGNFF: That could have been college tuition there.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. Too late.\n\nIGNFF: Would you be supportive if your son were to pursue a career in acting?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, I don't think he's going to, but if he does, I think sure. He does pretty strange things to me, now. We'll be having a little laser fight, and he'll say, \"Daddy, if you kill me, I will become stronger than you can ever imagine.\" Or he'll be riding in the back of the car and suddenly I'll hear, \"In the mornin' I'm makin' waffles!\" I'll say, \"Oh, that's great.\" And he'll say, \"Stop listening to me.\" He doesn't want to, anytime you push it. He doesn't want to be on the set or anything.\n\nIGNFF: If there were one piece of advice that you could give him, what would it be?\n\nDAVISON: One piece of advice? Make sure you love it, and you can take rejection, because the rejection won't be about you, or your talent, or who you are, it'll be because they want somebody else for a part. I will tell him the story about Milton Katselas. This goes back into the depths, but I was hot and young, and I'd just done Ulzana's Raid. I really wanted to do this part in Report to the Commissioner. Carroll O'Connor introduced me to Mike Frankovich. \"Yeah, the kid's great. I want you to do the part. Let's just meet the director.\" So we met Milton Katselas, had lunch with him. I wait and everything, had a real nice lunch, Jack Gilardi was my agent at the time. I waited and waited, nothing happened. I was on a set one time, and he was shooting 40 Carats. I went over to talk to him, \"How are ya?\" Time passed. Time passed and Michael Moriarty did the part. Finally, in '78, I guess, we were doing Streamers, and Richard Thomas was in it, and he was an old friend, you know, from back in Last Summer, our first film together ... Anyways, I got in and I said, \"Oh f***. What am I doing here? Why do I even bother? I hate Milton Katselas for not seeing how brilliant I would have been in that, the f***ing idiot.\" Okay, all right. I do a reading, and I'm walking up the aisle, and Milton comes running up the aisle, puts his arm around my shoulder and says, \"Would you do this part? I've been wanting to work with you for seven years.\" I stopped, and I said, \"Then why didn't you hire me for Report to the Commissioner?\" He said, \"You weren't right for that part. You're right for this part.\"\n\nIGNFF: You can't argue with that.\n\nDAVISON: So I ended up getting an L.A. Drama Critic's award for it. It was great.\n\nIGNFF: So it all comes down to a matter of being in it for the long term.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, yeah. It's a river. Sometimes it's dry, sometimes it's raging. Sometimes there're fish, sometimes there ain't.\n\nIGNFF: But the key is sticking with it?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: Would you say that right now you're happy with where your career is at?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I could always be happier. I could always be a lot sadder, but you know, I'm happy. I still get work. Of course the business is getting really weird now, you know. Everything's shooting in Canada. Parts I'd play are being played by Canadians. If I listen to one more Canadian say, \"I've only done 26 parts this year, why don't I get a lead?\" I'll smack him! All those 26 parts could've been played by my buddy, who's losing his house.\n\nIGNFF: Do you see the tide shifting?\n\nDAVISON: I hope it shifts. I hope that somebody in the Republican administration realizes that it's a small business issue, that a film is a floating factory and that every town, whether it comes into Memphis, or Washington, whether it comes into Toledo or anything else, brings all this work to the dry cleaners, to the hotels, to the restaurants – to everybody else. It's not about \"you die in Hollywood and we don't care.\"\n\nIGNFF: Where are the lobbyists against runaway productions?\n\nDAVISON: I'm going to Washington with the Creative Coalition ... but they're all preoccupied with the war. That's what it's all about. We were in the White House when the speech was being written to address the union, and it was a pretty scary time. Nobody's really interested right now. This runaway production... I'm sorry to say X-Men, $250 million or whatever they had, shot in Vancouver. All 26 sound stages or sets that were built, you know? And thousands of Canadians working on that.\n\nIGNFF: And it's not like there aren't other facilities outside of Hollywood in the U.S. that aren't available if people want to shoot.\n\nDAVISON: Well, the tax. The dollar thing – Canadians give breaks in the tax dollar, they can't compete with that. We could if we had some sort of tax situation that could help domestic production. That's not giving the actors a break, that's giving the movies a break. That's keeping our heritage, keeping everything here. Everything looks Canadian. One more New Yorker comes up and says, \"Read all a-boot it ...\"\n\nIGNFF: \"Eh...\"\n\nDAVISON: \"Read all a-boot it, eh?\" My film, I had to shoot a film that was supposed to be in Florida, in Miami, shooting in Vancouver. Try to find some Canadian Cubans.\n\nIGNFF: And everything shot in Canada looks the same.\n\nDAVISON: Yeah. I had two f***ing palm trees – they're in every shot.\n\nIGNFF: Sad, but true. Do you see the situation changing in the near future?\n\nDAVISON: No. Not unless somebody gives us some tax incentives. Unless somebody really gets hot – I'll tell you who would be the perfect one to do it, is Fred Thompson. Fred Thompson can bridge the gap between the Republican administration and the film business.\n\nIGNFF: Has he been approached about it?\n\nDAVISON: Yeah, we've approached him. I don't know what's going to happen. I hopefully will see him in Washington DC, and a number of people will get to talk to him about it. Because, I'll tell you, the Republican administration, 85% of them are really amenable to this and want to do something about it. It's the factions on either end. It's the extremes on either end that keep this war going, this media war between Hollywood and Washington.\n\nIGNFF: It'd be nice to eventually see productions look different than they have for the past couple of years.\n\nDAVISON: Absolutely. You pay a third less, and you get a third less quality.\n\nIGNFF: That's the thing that no one seems to realize, it's that the same people in this small community are doing cinematography, working camera, working this, working that. It's no wonder it looks the same.\n\nDAVISON: Over and over. Yeah.\n\nIGNFF: It's still a small community, no matter what they do.\n\nDAVISON: Right. You've got Vancouver, and you've got Toronto.\n\nIGNFF: Like I said, it's not like there aren't facilities in the U.S. outside of Hollywood – like Wilmington ...\n\nDAVISON: Wilmington is great! Wilmington is in deep s**t. If you get the mayors of some of these cities to really lobby against, or find their Congressmen and really foot a bill, you know, we could really get something changed. Bring the arts back to this country... but it's gone. 10,000 jobs lost just in my industry. That's not to say how many are lost ... the billions of dollars that are lost every year to runaway production of the ripple production that has, through every community.\n\nIGNFF: Have you started a website with more information?\n\nDAVISON: I don't know. I'm just a new member now, I just started with the Creative Coalition.\n\nYou can find out more about the Creative Coalition here."
