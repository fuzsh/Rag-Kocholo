        "text": "The Sinner‘s Abby Miller is set to recur in the second season of Bravo’s Imposters, from Universal Cable Productions. In addition, Bruce Davison (The Fosters) is set for a guest-starring role.\n\nImposters follows a persona-shifting con artist, as beautiful as she is dangerous, and her three most recent victims. Robbed of both their money and their hearts, the trio teams up to chase the woman who has left them questioning everything they believed to be true. Along the way, they learn the art of the con themselves, becoming embroiled in a thrilling game of cat and mouse that includes the beautiful grifter, her mysterious boss and his deliciously psychotic henchman… as well as the FBI. Inbar Lavi, Rob Heaps, Parker Young, Marianne Rendón, Brian Benben and Stephen Bishop star.\n\nMiller will play Charlotte, an avid collector who gets drawn into a con. Davison will play Cy Roberts, a retired con man.\n\nMiller played the series regular role of Caitlin Sullivan on USA Network’s The Sinner, and recurred as Ellen May on Justified. Her other TV credits include Aquarius and The Magicians.\n\nDavison received a supporting actor Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe Award for Longtime Companion and a guest actor Emmy nom for Touched By An Angel. On the TV side, he most recently recurred as Stewart Adams on Freeform’s The Fosters."
