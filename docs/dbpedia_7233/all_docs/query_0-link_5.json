        "text": "Bullying, sarcastic and hateful, Stegman is Kindom Hospital's main human antagonist.\n\nStegman is the kind of arrogant and immoral physician who displays greater allegiance to his Jaguar than to the Hippocratic oath. But what is his connection to the hospital chief of staff, Dr. Jesse James?\n\nThe Academy Award-nominated Bruce Davison had several recent high-profile roles in blockbuster films. He has also portrayed Senator Kelly in both X-Men, and X2: X-Men United.\n\nA Philadelphia native, Davison attended Penn State, where he studied art before switching to theater. He received his training at New York University's School of the Arts and, at 21, launched a successful Broadway career. For his poignant portrayal of a man in a relationship devastated by AIDS in Longtime Companion, Davison was nominated for an Academy Award and received a Golden Globe Award, the New York Film Critics Award, the National Film Critics Award and the Independent Film Project's Spirit Award.\n\nDavison has had guest-starring turns on many series, including Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, Without a Trace, Enterprise and Touched by an Angel, for which he earned an Emmy Award nomination."
