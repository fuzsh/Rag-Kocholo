        "text": "Some things are hidden for a reason.\n\nFrom the Shadows, the new paranormal horror film from director Mike Sargent brings together - for the first time - horror titans, Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Bruce Davison (“Ozark,” Willard”), Tony-nominated and multiple Emmy Award winner Keith David (“Nope,” “The Thing”), along with Selena Anduze (“Wanda/Vision,” “Creepshow”). Following a national theatrical release, the new film will be available online on VUDU beginning October 6, it was announced today by producers Michael Alden, Ian Holt and Mike Kuciak of Alt-House Productions in partnership with PFG Films.\n\nAudiences can stream From the Shadows on Vudu by clicking HERE.\n\nCelebrate the upcoming Halloween season with the film Fears Magazine says is, “An old-school horror film that mixes smartphone footage, computer conference footage and traditional cinematic narrative to present a tale of spiritual academics.” Cinema Daily raves, “From the Shadows intertwines the horror genre with science fiction and expands on the perceptual power of the mind. A top-notch cast includes industry legends Keith David and Bruce Davison.”\n\nBased on the mystique and mystery of the Ancient Alien theory, From The Shadows begins when the enigmatic leader of the Hidden Wisdom cult, Dr. Joseph Cawl (Bruce Davison), and eighteen of his followers all die in a mysterious inferno. Five young survivors suspected of igniting the blaze contact paranormal researcher Amara Rowan (Selena Anduze) to help uncover the real cause of the fire. What they stumble upon is the truth behind the disappearance of Cawl's partner, Dr. Leonard Bertram (Keith David). What they don't realize is that the blast opened a portal to evil entities known as Shadow People** and to a deranged killer hell-bent on slaughtering them all.\n\nDirected by Mike Sargent, written by Mike Kuciak with story by Ian Holt (co-author, with Dacre Stoker, of the international bestseller, “Dracula the Un-Dead”, the official sequel to Bram Stoker's classic 1897 novel, “Dracula”), Mike Kuciak, and Mike Sargent. From The Shadows is produced by Michael Alden, Ian Holt and Mike Kuciak of Alt House Productions in partnership with PFG Films. Special Effects makeup is designed by Vincent J. Guastini, with sound design by Academy Award winner Cecelia Hall. The film's score is composed by horror legend, Alan Howarth, who along with partner John Carpenter, composed the scores to classics such as “Halloween,” “They Live,” “Prince Of Darkness,” and “Escape From New York.”\n\n“What intrigued me most about directing this film was the idea of fear of the unknown,” said Mike Sargent. “The idea that there is something malevolent waiting for us in the darkness that we can't see but we know is there. I also think we live in a world where we often wonder how people could commit some of the evil that they do. So, when you put this together with the ability to work with two icons like Keith David and Bruce Davison… It's literally a genre lover's dream come true.”\n\n“Horror is my first and greatest love,” said screenwriter Mike Kuciak. “With From the Shadows, we get the visceral horror thrill of a crazed man with a knife leaping up behind the characters, and we get something of a Lovecraftian element in the sense that two scientists and a journalist explore something they think is simple at the face of it, only to discover something cosmic and unknown at work. I think horror works best when it is, at its core, a human story.”\n\nIan Holt, who devised the story of the film, said, “We got the idea for the film from Erich Von Daniken and Giorgio Tsoukalos and their “Ancient Aliens” theories, which I've been a fan of since I saw the documentary \"Chariots Of The Gods\" as a kid. The theory goes that long ago, aliens came to earth to advance our civilization by passing along to us the secret dark powers of the universe. How scary would it be if a modern man rediscovered these ancient powers? We just knew that this scenario could make for one heck of an original and terrifying supernatural horror thriller, and that was the jumping off point for From the Shadows.”\n\nFrom The Shadows won the Best Feature Award at The Horrorween Festival, was a finalist at The Stranger Days Horror Festival, and is an official selection of the Phobia Film Festival in Missouri.\n\nIn addition to Vudu, the film can also be seen on Comcast, Charter, Directv, Cox Cable, Dish Network Altice, Uverse, Verizon Fios and Sling.\n\nBruce Davison\n\nExtremely winning and versatile, the award-worthy actor, now enjoying an over four decade career, has included everything from Shakespeare to Seinfeld.
