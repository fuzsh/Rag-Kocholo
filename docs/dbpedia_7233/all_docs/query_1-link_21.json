        "text": "Actors Lucas Bryant, Bruce Davison, and Michelle Hurd will be seen joining the cast of the family-centric comedy film 25 Miles to Normal.\n\nJoshua Brandon’s film has been acquired by Artist View Entertainment, and production will begin this month in Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri. Rachel Nichols, Ed Begley Jr., and Dee Wallace complete the ensemble cast, said The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n25 Miles to Normal is a story that revolves around a doctor (Bryant) and his estranged father (Davison) as they unwillingly agree to reunite with the rest of their family. Along with Peter Foldy’s Filmstreet Productions and B.L. Fleischer for RcR Cinema, Brandon will produce under the Spitfire Cinema label. “Josh is an incredible young filmmaker, and I’m thrilled to be partnering with him on this hilarious and heartfelt project,” Artist View president Scott J Jones said in a statement.\n\nBrandon, who worked with Bryant on the Syfy series Haven, shared, “This is a family story very dear to my heart, and I am beyond excited to see Lucas and Bruce in this dysfunctional father-son relationship. Lucas spoke the first words I ever had produced on Haven, and to be able to work with him again all these years later is a dream come true.”\n\nLucas Bryant is a Canadian-American actor, who is known for his works in Crazy Canucks, An American in Canada, and The Eleventh Hour. Bryant starred as Calvin Puddie in the TV movie Playing House based on the book by Patricia Pearson. Bryant had supporting roles in the movies A Very Merry Daughter of the Bride and The Vow. In 2010, Bryant landed a lead role as Nathan in Haven, a TV series based on Stephen King’s novel The Colorado Kid."
