With a 14-episode final season (two, seven-episode half-seasons) set to wrap things up, viewers are learning the name of another face joining the drama as the Byrdes climb to even greater heights- but will they come crashing down in a bloody ball of fire? Deadline Hollywood is reporting that Bruce Davison (X-Men, Longtime Companion) is joining the cast in the role of corrupt retired Illinois U.S. Senator Randall Schafer. Davison joins a recent slew of new additions to the final season's cast, which also includes Alfonso Herrera (The Exorcist, El baile de los 41) and Adam Rothenberg (The Serpent, Ripper Street) joining as series regulars, while Felix Solis (Ten Days in the Valley, Charmed) and Damian Young (The Trial of Chicago 7, Homeland) have been upped to series regulars. Additionally, Bruno Bichir (Narcos, The Bridge), CC Castillo (Outer Banks, True Detective), and Katrina Lenk (The Band's Visit, Tommy) have been cast in recurring roles.\n\nHerrera will play Javi Elizonndro, a member of the Navarro family who walks a fine line between playing the obedient lieutenant and scheming to take over his uncle's cartel. Rothenberg's Mel Sattem is a cop who fell from grace who now works as a P.I. He enjoys the chase and won't rest until he unravels the truth. Solis plays Omar Navarro and Young portrays Jim Rettelsdorf. Bichir will recur as Navarro's Priest. Navarro's confessor and confidant, he works for the cartel because he deeply believes he belongs where God is needed most. Castillo's Sheriff Leigh Guerrero is a Missouri law enforcement officer who refuses to play on anyone's terms but her own. Lenk's Clare Shaw is the CEO of a leading biopharmaceutical company, whose judgment is corrupted as she learns the true cost of power. Davison's Randall Schafer is a powerful retired Illinois U.S. Senator who is accustomed to doing things his way. He is not always easy to win overâ€¦ but for the right price? He's willing to talk.\n\nTracing the Byrdes' rise and (possible) fall from their suburban life in Chicago to their deadly criminal enterprise life in the Ozarks, Marty and Wendy have gone from basic money-laundering to running a Mexican drug cartel's most profitable operations. But with the blood they've shed and the enemies they've made, is there any way this story can end well and not in a morgue? Joining Bateman and Linney are Julia Garner as Ruth Langmore, Sofia Hublitz as Charlotte Byrde, Skylar Gaertner as Jonah Bryde, Charlie Tahan as Ruth's cousin Wyatt Langmore, and Lisa Emery as local heroin distributor Darlene Snell. Created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, Ozark stems from Aggregate Films in association with Media Rights Capital. Bateman, Dubuque, Williams, and showrunner Mundy executive produce."
