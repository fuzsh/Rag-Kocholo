        "text": "\"THE LAST CALL\"\n\nAcademy Award Nominee BRUCE DAVISON, RACHEL TRUE, and Emmy Award Winner KEITH DAVID\n\nTo Star In The Supernatural/Sci Fi Thriller Feature Film\n\n(New York, NY, August 3, 2021) - Principal Photography on The Last Call commences August 9, 2021 in Morristown, NJ. The supernatural-psychological thriller stars Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Bruce Davison, Rachel True (\"The Craft\") and Tony Award nominated and multiple Emmy Award winner, Keith David.\n\nDirected by Mike Sargent and written by Mike Kuciak, the feature is being produced by Michael Alden, Ian Holt and Mike Kuciak of Alt House Productions in partnership with PFG Films. Special Effects Make-Up will be designed by the legendary Vincent J. Guastini. Sound Design is by Academy Award winning Sound Editor Cecelia Hall.\n\nAfter what appears to be a cult mass suicide, a documentary filmmaker, DR. AMARA ROWEN (True), is contacted by the surviving members of 'The Hidden Wisdom Cult' in the hope she will be able to uncover the truth. Unfortunately, Amara's connection with the group could unwittingly make her the next victim.\n\nFounded by respected physics professor DR. JOSEPH CAWL (Davison), Hidden Wisdom has gained tens of thousands of followers in dozens of countries with claims to be capable of supernatural power and the ability to cure seemingly incurable mental health difficulties.\n\nDR. LEONARD BERTRAM (David), Joseph's former colleague, is convinced that Joseph is actually evil and plans to use the power of Hidden Wisdom to change reality as a whole. But someone or some thing has decided that the only way to save the world is to cut out the cancer and kill the last survivors of Joseph's group. Amara and the survivors have to fight for their lives so this does not become for them...THE LAST CALL.\n\nBIOGRAPHIES\n\nBRUCE DAVISON\n\nBorn on June 28, 1946, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bruce developed a burgeoning interest in acting while majoring in art at Penn State and after accompanying a friend to a college theater audition.
