        "text": "BRUCE Davison is a convicted child abuser, who groomed and sexually abused his victim for six years.\n\nHere’s everything we know about the offender who appeared on Channel 4’s 24 Hours in Police Custody.\n\nWho is Bruce Davison from C4's 24 Hours in Police Custody?\n\nBruce Davison is a convicted child abuser.\n\nIn October 2016 Davison was convicted of targeting, grooming and sexually abusing a child.\n\nThe abuse took place from the time the boy was 7 years old, up until the age of 13.\n\nIn a statement read to Luton Crown Court, the victim described how the monster had destroyed his life: “I thought [it] was the norm, I didn’t know any better… I trusted him.\n\n“I thought he was my friend, but he abused my trust by taking advantage of me, my young age, my vulnerability, and took my innocence.\n\n“I feel robbed of my childhood and robbed by Davison, he took away my dignity and self-respect as a child and even as a teenager, because his abuse of me spanned so many years.”\n\nPraising the victim's strength and courage in coming forward, Bedfordshire Police’s Detective Constable Sharon Ellis said: \"I hope this sentence allows him to move forward with his life.\n\n“The sentencing for non-recent cases of abuse such as this shows that it does not matter how long ago abuse took place, if you do come forward then you will be treated fairly, you will be believed, and justice can be done.”\n\nWhat did Bruce Davison do?\n\nBruce Davison sexually abused a child.\n\nThe abuse started when the boy was seven years old and stopped when he was thirteen.\n\nIt took decades until the victim came forward and went to the police.\n\nI feel robbed of my childhood and robbed by Davison, he took away my dignity and self-respect as a child and even as a teenager, because his abuse of me spanned so many years.\n\nVictim at court\n\nDetective Constable Sharon Ellis informed his wife about his arrest.\n\nShe told her: \"A complaint has been made to the police, by someone who's known to you.\n\n\"That your husband has historically sexually abused them.\n\n“The reason for the arrest is to allow your husband the opportunity to give his version of events, his account as to what did or didn't happen.\"\n\nHow many years was Bruce Davison from 24 Hours in Police Custody sentenced to?\n\nDavison received two six-year sentences to be served concurrently.\n\nFollowing the case featuring on 24 Hours in Police Custody another victim came forward, with a jury at Luton Crown Court finding him guilty of indecent assault.\n\nThe victim was abused while working his Saturday job in Luton — where Davison worked — in the mid-1990s when he was about 13 years old.\n\nOver 20 years later the man walked into his dad’s house while the show was on, recognised his abuser Davison, and his father encouraged him to contact the police.\n\nJudge Steven Evans told Davison: \"You were in a position of power. I have read his victim personal statement. In short, your actions have had a lifelong impact on him.\n\n\"You have had a long-held sexual interest in young male children - you targeted him.\"\n\nDet Con Sharon Ellis, who led both investigations, said: \"It's something I had never come across before in my lengthy career.\n\n\"This episode gave this young man... the springboard to contact the police.\n\n\"It is never too late to anyone who has been a victim of non-recent sexual abuse to come forward.\"\n\nHe was sentenced to a further 15 months in prison.\n\nWhen is Bruce Davison on 24 Hours in Police Custody?\n\nThis case was first featured in the fifth series of the TV show in June 2017.\n\nA repeat of the episode is being shown on Channel 4 Seven at 2:15 am on Saturday July 6, 2024.\n\nHow to watch 24 Hours in Police Custody\n\n24 Hours in Police Custody: Their Time Will Come is available to watch on Thursday 4th, July, 2024 on Channel 4 at 9:45pm\n\nAlternatively, stream it on My4; C4’s view on demand service.\n\nAll you need is to create an account on their website and you can watch the show.\n\nThe episode featuring Bruce Davison will be available to watch on Channel 4 Seven on following days:"
