        "text": "As a Seinfeld fan, I was quite excited to meet Bruce Davison when he appeared at the Scarefest event in Lexington, Kentucky on September 15, 2013. Mr. Davison had portrayed the character Wyck Thayer in three episodes of the series. Wyck, referred to often as “Wink” by George Costanza, was the chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation, and as the leader he assumes that George had killed his own fiancee Susan. His part wasn’t exactly mammoth, but his part offered enough comical possibilities for George that he was definitely worth seeking out.\n\nBut unfortunately, he had no photos from Seinfeld. Being at a horror convention, he had concentrated more on bringing still photos from Willard, the 1971 horror film in which he played title character Willard Stiles, the trainer of rats who ultimately gets devoured by them. Ick. But not Wyck.\n\nDespite that, he was really fun to chat with, and consequently I had no problem laying down the $25 to get a nice signed photo from Willard. He offered free photos ops with both Carolyn and me as well.\n\nLooking over his list of film credits later, I understood why he didn’t think to being a Seinfeld photos. Granted the sitcom was huge, but Bruce Davison had appeared in a huge number of films and TV series since the early 1970’s and was still going strong today, so there was no way he could cover all the bases.\n\nIt was certainly cool to meet him, but longing for a signed Seinfeld still, all I could think was, “Rats!”\n\nCelebrity encounters from the 2013 Scarefest in Lexington will continue…"
