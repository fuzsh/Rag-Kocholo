        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\nBruce Davison (June 28, 1946, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S)\n\nTheatre actor Bruce Davison became a hot ticket on Broadway in the late 1960s and was tipped for glory. Combining the kind of raw activism associated with Robert Redford with a mode of flip cynicism similar to George Segal, Davison became one of the faces of the counterculture movement through his performances in Frank Perry's 'Last Summer' (1969), Stuart Hagmann's 'The Strawberry Statement' (1970), Jeffrey Young's 'Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me' (1971) and Daniel Mann's 'Willard' (1971). He has been called one of cinema's great misfits.\n\nBruce Davison & Sarah Miles\n\nCatherine Burns, Bruce Davison, Barbara Hershey, & Richard Thomas in 'Last Summer'\n\n+\n\nDon Johnson (December 15, 1949, Flat Creek, Missouri, U.S.)\n\nActor Don Johnson was an ideal screen counterpart for Bruce Davison during the counterculture boom. Johnson acted in Leonard Horn's 'The Magic Garden Of Stanley Sweetheart' (1970), Artemio Marquez's 'Lollipops & Roses' (1971), George Englund's 'Zachariah' (1971) and Ted Post's 'The Harrad Experiment' (1973). Filmmaker Sidney Lumet cited Johnson as an example of an actor who was underappreciated by certain critics who became fixated upon his impressive physique at the expense of giving fair evaluation of his acting work.\n\nRobin Mattson, Nick Nolte & Don Johnson\n\nNora Aunor, Don Johnson, Davy Jones, & Cocoy Laurel in 'Lollipops & Roses'\n\nPost by spiderwort on\n\nAm not familiar enough with Don Johnson to discuss him, but know Davison's work very well. He's a wonderful actor who was robbed of the Oscar he should have won for his brilliant work in Longtime Companion. That was a major disappointment. I also really liked him in his film debut, Last Summer. He never stops working -- non-stop from 1969 to today with hundreds of credits to his name, always outperforming everyone. You go, Bruce!"
