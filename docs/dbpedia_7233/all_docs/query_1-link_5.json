        "text": "Waste\n\nDetectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) report to Wheaton Memorial Hospital to investigate a rape victim. But the victim is Stephanie Rawley, a beautiful 28-year-old woman who has been in a coma for the past year, the result of a car accident. She is brought to the hospital with pneumonia and the doctors discover she is six weeks pregnant. The detectives start by investigating everyone at Mountcastle Rehabilitation Center, where she's been for the past year. The list of suspects includes her fiance David Anderson (Ian Kahn), who despite a restraining order from her parents Bob (Henry Woronicz) and Janice (JoBeth Williams) was found sleeping in her bed. They also extract DNA from basically all male employees who had any contact with the coma wing. They also question Dr. Mandell (Bruce Davison), her neurosurgeon, especially after he plots with another doctor to abort the fetus.\n\nIdentity Theft\n\nA confessed murderer, who was apprehended while Brenda was away on her honeymoon, gets details of the crime wrong during his allocution, causing Brenda to reopen the case. Brenda's investigation, however, is interrupted by a visit from her mother, Willie Ray (recurring guest star Frances Sternhagen), who hopes to pawn her troublesome niece, Charlie (recurring guest star Sosie Bacon - \"Loverboy\" and the real-life daughter of Kyra Sedgwick), off on Brenda and Fritz for the summer.\n\nThe Underground Job\n\nIn the aftermath of a deadly mine explosion, the team infiltrates the coal mines of West Virginia to put an end to the dangerous practices of the mineâs owner. But what the team digs up will threaten the livelihood of everyone in this tight-knit community."
