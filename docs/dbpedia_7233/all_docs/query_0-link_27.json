        "text": "BRUCE DAVISON GUEST STARS ON NBC'S \"LAW & ORDER: TBJ\"\n\nBRUCE DAVISON GUEST STARS ON NBC'S \"LAW & ORDER: TRIAL BY JURY,\" FRIDAY, MARCH 25TH, 10PM ET/PT\n\nCandice Bergen Also Guest Stars\n\nNEW YORK � March 24, 2005� Bruce Davison and Candice Bergen, in a cameo appearance, guest star as Defense Attorney Peter Betts and Judge Amanda Anderlee, respectively, on NBC's \"Law & Order: Trial By Jury,\" Friday, March 25th (10-11 p.m. ET/PT). Photos available at www.NBCUMV.com\n\nIn this week's episode, \"Baby Boom,\" Assistant District Attorneys Kibre (Bebe Neuwirth) and Gaffney (Amy Carlson) prosecute a young nanny Katie (guest star Elizabeth Moss) who is accused of murder for shaking an infant and bashing in her head -- but they run into a stone wall when the presiding Judge Patel (guest star Aasif Mandvi) intentionally blocks every move they make. After Kibre rejects Gaffney's desperate offer to resign to blunt the judge's irrational ire, they discover the tough defense attorney has coached his client well and intends to point the finger of murder elsewhere. Kirk Acevedo, Fred Dalton Thompson and Scott Cohen (\"NYPD Blue\") also star.\n\n\"Law & Order: Trial By Jury\" takes viewers through the legal process from arraignment to trial, told not only from the point-of-view of the prosecutors and police - but also from the perspective of defendants, defense attorneys, judges and jurors. From this omniscient perspective, viewers will be privy to ex-parte communications, intimate conversations between defendants and their attorneys, and a behind-the-scenes look at witness preparation and jury selection.\n\nCurrently, Bergen stars in \"Boston Legal,\" but audiences have known her for decades for critically acclaimed work in both film and television. Most prominently, she stared in \"Murphy Brown\" for 10 years, for which she received five Emmy's and two Golden Globes. Bergen also appeared in films \"Miss Congeniality,\" \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" \"Ghandi,\" \"Carnal Knowledge,\" and \"Starting Over,\" for which she received and Oscar nomination.\n\nDavison's resume comprises a long list of film and television credits. He was most recently seen in Stephen King's drama, \"Kingdom Hospital\" and has recurred in such shows as \"Seinfeld,\" \"Designing Women\" and \"Thirty Something.\" Film credits include \"Runaway Jury,\" \"Apt Pupil and \"Longtime Companion\" in which he was nominated for an Academy Award and Emmy, and won the Golden Globe.\n\n\"Law & Order: Trial By Jury\" is a Wolf Films production in association with NBC Universal Television Studio. Dick Wolf is creator and executive producer; Walon Green and Peter Jankowski are executive producers."
