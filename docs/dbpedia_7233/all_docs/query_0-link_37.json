        "text": "The Hybrid\n\nKlaus puts a plan in motion that will give him even more power, but even with the unwilling participation of werewolf Ray Sutton (recurring guest star David Gallagher), things donât go exactly as Klaus had planned. Damon and Alaric reluctantly go along with Elenaâs new strategy to find Stefan, leading Damon into a dangerous fight with an unexpected enemy. Jeremy turns to Matt for help as he continues to try to understand what the ghosts from his past want from him. Unaware that Caroline is in need of his help, Tyler faces an emotional confrontation with his mother (recurring guest star Susan Walters â One Tree Hill, Melrose Place).\n\nThe End of the Affair\n\nKlaus and Stefan arrive in Chicago, where Stefan is reunited with a vampire (recurring guest star Claire Holt â Pretty Little Liars, H20: Just Add Water), who hasnât really moved on from her interest in him decades earlier. In a flashback to Chicago in the 1920s, Stefan comes face to face with a shocking chapter from his wild past. After Damon gets a tip on Stefan and Klausâ whereabouts from an unexpected source, he and Elena follow their trail. Meanwhile, back in Mystic Falls, Tyler is concerned about Caroline and turns to Sheriff Forbes (recurring guest star Marguerite MacIntyre) for help.\n\nDisturbing Behavior\n\nStill in Chicago, Klaus uses Gloria (guest star Charmin Lee â Girlfriends, Supernatural), a witch he knew long ago, to help him track down missing information that will explain why his plan isnât working. Gloriaâs spells reveal intriguing glimpses of the truth, but she soon realizes she needs Stefanâs knowledge to complete the puzzle. When Stefan suddenly finds himself in danger, help comes from a surprising ally. Back in Mystic Falls, a frustrating new enemy pushes Damon over the brink and he lashes out in a way that will have lasting consequences. Caroline struggles with her own emotional issues, even as she tries to help Elena face her feelings. Jeremy makes a brief but disturbing breakthrough with one of his ghostly visitors, leaving him more confused than ever. Finally, Bonnie has a strange encounter that will affect everyone.\n\nThe Ties That Bind\n\nBonnie believes her recurring dreams about Klausâ coffins will tell her how he can be killed. The dreams also lead Bonnie to a reunion with her mother, Abby (recurring guest star Persia White â Girlfriends), whom Bonnie hasnât seen for 15 years. At Abbyâs remote farmhouse, Bonnie and Elena meet Jamie (guest star Robert Riâchard â One on One), the young man Abby took in years earlier. Bonnieâs sudden appearance catches Abby off guard, but she does her best to explain the past. Tyler turns to an unexpected ally in his quest to regain his free will. Damon is intrigued by Alaricâs new friend, Dr. Fell (recurring guest star Torrey DeVitto), and Klaus continues his bitter negotiations with Stefan over control of the coffins containing his family members."
