The celebs on this site are usually over listed by 1/2\" or more in My Opinion. Another one here.\n\nJug said on 1/May/19\n\nI actually think the full six feet in his prime.\n\nWorld Citizen said on 25/Dec/18\n\nLooks 177 178 cm in the pic.\n\njtm said on 15/Mar/18\n\nmaybe with that big hair he looks 6'0 lol.\n\nBobby said on 12/Mar/18\n\nThat makes him look 6ft though LOL.\n\nBlake said on 17/Feb/17\n\nRob, is he gaining an advantage by being closer to the camera?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI doubt much.\n\nS.J.H said on 2/Nov/16\n\nMake him bald and he'll look 5'9.5\n\nAza said on 23/Oct/16\n\nTake away the hair and he' s less than 5'10.5.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 6/Oct/16\n\nNowhere near 6ft1...even at peak\n\nMerky said on 20/Jul/16\n\nLooks under 5 foot 11 today.\n\nMr. R said on 10/Jun/07\n\nI saw Bruce at the Actor's Fund event of \"Casablanca\". He is 6'1\".\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think that would be unbelievable, he looks more under 6ft than over.\n\nrichinkle said on 9/Mar/07\n\nI don't think he's this tall. I'm watching Mame, and in a pool scene, 5'-7 1/2\" Lucille Ball in 2 1/2\" heels looks almost the same height as a barefoot Davison. He is at most an inch taller than she is in this scene, which would put him at 5'11 or 5'11 1/2\" at most. Ball is also about 62 years old, and may not be full height, although she still stands quite tall in this movie."
