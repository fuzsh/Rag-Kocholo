        "text": "MUMBAI: AXN has major plans up its sleeve in the coming months. A couple of days ago it rescheduled its primetime band which now starts at 8 pm instead of 10 pm.\n\nNow it has also announced a slew of new shows. One of them Kingdom Hospital will see the channel bring back the horror genre.\n\nUntil last year the channel had a horror slot every Thursday night. So the show which premieres in September will pick up the thread. The drama series has been produced by the master of horror Stephen King. In fact the idea of airing the show in India has been on the channels drawing board plans for quite a while.\n\nBased on the original series Kingdom by Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier, the creepy tale deals with a hospital with hidden secrets. It stars Bruce Davison X-Xen, X-Men 2 and Andrew McCarthy Weekend at Bernies, St Elmos Fire.\n\nThe hospital was built over an ancient graveyard. The doctors have put all their faith into science and technology and are dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or unseen powers until strange things go bump in the middle of the night as it were.\n\nFans of the reality genre will also get their kicks. This month the special seven episode Couples Fear Factor will air. Here couples face off against their worst fears and other conniving couples. The aim as is the case in The Amazing Race is to win the $1million prize. The channel will also have new seasons of Xena Warrior Princess which also airs in India on Star World. The channel will also showcase Canadas legal drama, The Associates\n\nThe fun continues in August which has been dubbed AXN Independence Month . Big thrills are in store every Sunday from 12 noon to 5 pm. The Thrills TV band will feature reality specials such as Worlds Most Shocking Moments Caught on Tape and When Animals Attack.\n\nThe channel is also looking to spice up its Hot N' Wild belt. It will air the 2-part Worlds Sexiest Commercials in this block. This will feature zany commercials that like the other content in the slot promise to titilate and tantalise the senses.\n\nNot satisfied? Then gouge on more late night escapism in the form of Bikini Destinations. This takes viewers on a weekly adventure to the hottest locations and greatest party destinations in the world. This too premieres in the Hot N Wild belt.\n\nNext month AXN will also introduce a reality show with a fresh concept. Next Action Star from Hollywood producer Joel Silver The Matrix, searches for an action hero and heroine.\n\nThe casting call sees 14 finalists fighting to stay on in the show. As is the case with other shows like Survivor each week a contestant gets eliminated. The winners will star in the action movie Bet your Life with Billy Zane Titanic."
