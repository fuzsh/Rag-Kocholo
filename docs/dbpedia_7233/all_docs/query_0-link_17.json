Baxley\n\nStudio: Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (Korea)\n\nRating: NR\n\nGenre: Drama/Fantasy(TV)\n\nAbout This DVD\n\nSoap opera meets THE SHINING in this star-studded miniseries that was nominated for two Emmy Awards; based on the Danish miniseries RIGET (KINGDOM), it is centered around the bizarre and preternatural Kingdom Hospital, where we meet a cast of peculiar characters inhabiting a quietly menacing setting.\n\nWhen Peter Rickman is hit by an inebriated driver, the last thing he sees before lapsing into unconsciousness is a vaguely human form who announces its mission to send Peter to rid the hospital of the evil that dwells there. Once inside the hospital's halls, Peter meets the hypochondriac, psychic Mrs. Druse, and Dr. Hook, the brilliant surgeon who lives in the basement; when patients and staff begin to hear the cries coming from the walls, this unlikely band of allies sets out to solve the mystery of the ghostly inhabitants of Kingdom Hospital."
