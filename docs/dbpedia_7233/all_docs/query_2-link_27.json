        "text": "Kid Riki (Mar. 2023)\n\nHi Melissa! After many years of searching, I finally found the title to this movie. \"Daddy, I Don't Like It Like This\" was broadcast back in July 1978 on CBS (I was a few years off the mark here) with Doug McKeon as Peter Agnelli, a shy and sensitive boy living in an abusive environment. Burt Young and Talia Shire (of Rocky fame) play his insufferable parents, Rocco and Carol Agnelli. The movie has been uploaded and is available for viewing on Youtube.\n\nCheyenna Skelton (Apr. 2023)\n\nI finally figured this out. I've been searching for the name of this movie for years too with no luck, but I was reading through all the synopsis in the database and came across \"Daddy, I Don't Like It Like This\", a CBS tv movie from 1978. I remembered the dad wearing boxing gloves, the little boy having light blonde hair and blue eyes. I remembered feeling more disturbed by it because when I was little I thought the boy looked so much like my brother. I seemed to recall that the father bullied the little boy a lot and wanted him to be tough, and of course I remembered the tragic ending. I watched this by myself as a child in a hotel room (always had insomnia) while my family was asleep sometime in the 80s, and I never forgot about the story, but I never knew the name of it until now. Unfortunately I can't find it anywhere to watch or buy.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nRobert Byers (Oct. 2021)\n\nI am seeking the name of a made-for-TV 70s movie (airplane crash, teen-age daughter).\n\nI distinctly recall a (possibly made-for-TV) movie having a scene in which a very proud teen-aged daughter of a man who often piloted a small aircraft was admiringly watching her father's airplane only to witness moments later the plane go out of control and crash. For some reason, I seem to recall the Nilsson song \"Without You\" playing either while the plane was going down, or immediately after it crashed.\n\nI always thought the daughter might have been Lisa Gerritsen (\"My World and Welcome To It\"), but her filmography does not include a movie that fits my description.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nGrace Collins (Aug. 2021)\n\nHi,\n\nI do a classic Hollywood podcast and I want to do a couple on these wonderful old 70's flicks. I've been looking for an expert that knows and loves these films to be a guest. If interested let me know..Thanks much!\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/true-stories-of-tinseltown/id1363744889\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nMichelle R (Mar. 2021)\n\nGood discussion - where do you go to expand your collection ? Have you tried 'TrueTvMovies? 'Loving the Classics'? 'Classic DVD World'? I don't want to be scammed.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nSharon Gari (Dec. 2020)\n\nI have been looking for this movie a long time. It was a made for TV movie (possibly LMN) about a woman who leaves her husband and kidnaps her young daughter and goes on the run for years with her. It takes place in the south. The woman cons and writes bad checks to survive and intermittantly actually works, but is eventually caught up with. Her daughter is sent back to her Grandma's house. Several years go by, the daughter is now grown and her Mom has been in prison but is finally released. She also has a terminal illness. In the end, Mom/Daughter have a good relationship. The title was like a children's poem. I think it was made in the late 70s. Mom was a blond, daugther was played by a famous child actress. I would love to see the movie again.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nglindathegood (Dec. 2020)\n\nHello, I am trying to find a 'Made for TV' film about a U.S. Ship that transported a number of WW2 refugees from possibly Portugal? I think is was primarily Jewish refugees. I remember a plot point being the birth on board causing trouble with 'allowed number of people, but by some chance an older person died, so the numbers would match. Does anyone know the name of this film and any other information about it? TYIA\n\nJR (Jul. 2021)\n\nSounds like Voyage of the Damned.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\ntamica jones (2020)\n\nnot sure if its a late 70's or 80's movie. but it was about 2 sisters who had to move with their drunk aunt after tragic accident with parents. They were poor one of the sisters would make her own clothes while the other one was simple didn't really care about her appearance but she liked to collect it was either glass bottles or tin cans cant really remember. Have been trying to find the name of this movie for years.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nCLMAZ (2020)\n\nMid-to-late 70s ('77-ish) made for tv, or B-movie. Couple moves to new location with contemporary decor. Executive and neglectful husband goes to work. Pretty and lonely wife meets elegant ghost and gets romantically involved. It's right here.... in the middle of my brain, but I can't pick it out. For some reason, I believe Mom wouldn't have wanted me to watch it.... she didn't like supernatural movies... so I must have been about 17, but I know it was on tv and couldn't be too erotic or violent.\n\nKim Sauln (2020)\n\nIt may be \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" ? Hope this helps.....\n\nMadeForTV (2020)\n\nI think that might be The Haunting Passion (1983) with Jane Seymour.\n\nProtect Blue Lives (2020)\n\nThe House On Greenapple Road - 1970\n\nCLMAZ (2020)\n\nOMG... For years, I believed I was the only person who ever saw this movie. I've been trying to find it on streaming. I've found it listed online, but not on any streaming services I use. I believe it starred Christopher George as the man whose wife vanishes from their house on Green Apple Road.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nHeidi Carder (2020)\n\nThere was a movie I saw as a kid in the late 70s/early 80s on one of those late night programs, perhaps during the La Bries late night shows. I remember there being this large manor, maybe some type of institute or a school, in the country with huge green lawns and trees - almost like an English countryside manor. There were a bunch of young 20-somethings and one of the girls was blind. I am not sure if any of the others were. She end up getting stalked by a man. For some reason she is alone in the place; I can't remember itf it was because the others had left or if they were also killed. It seems that it looked like the movie was a late 60s early 70s. Sorry I know not much to go on but it is just snippets of memory that have stuck with me since I was a little girl. Thanks!\n\nJR (Jul. 2021)\n\nSounds like See No Evil with Mia Farrow (1971-ish)\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nVernon Purvis (2020)\n\nI remember a \"After School Special\" type of show (but, I don't think it was an After School School). It was about a twelve year old boy. He hurt his leg while sliding into a base during a game of baseball. An x-ray showed it was bone cancer. At first, the doctor thought he could just remove and replace that section of bone and save the leg. Later, he determined it would cause nerve damage and that he will have to remove the leg (I thought as a kid, so what if you have a limp!). He had to come to terms with losing the leg.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nEbony Manley (2020)\n\nLooking for good 70's stalker Movies\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nwhoopdedoodoo (2020)\n\nLooking for a 70s movie that used to show on TV late at night in the 90s. It involved two very young people (young teens?) who fall in love and run off to try to be together, but can barely take care of themselves. It showed late at night on TV, and it was on the video shelf at my local video store. I don't remember what movie it was.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\njp (2020)\n\nLooking for 60s era movie where a man in a taxi (england)? keeps coming up short to pay for his ride. Taxi driver goes all over with him so he can borrow money. Once or twice he almost makes it but the meter clicks over.\n\nAlso looking for a 70s era movie or anthology episode where two male castaways find beautiful young woman castaway. One guy kills the other over the girl. The girl later dies. When the sole survivor is rescued the rescuers exhume the bodies. The girl's grave is empty. She did not exist.\n\nCLMAZ (2020)\n\nI don't know what it is, but I wish I did. Sounds cool. I love it when someone who is there, is not really there. And movies about pictures or paintings that change. So, good luck. Hope you find it. :D\n\nLesli Rarick (2020)\n\nStrangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter (1979) bette davis and gena rowlands. A+\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nFASTPONY0803 (2020)\n\nFound this and I'm going to give it a shot. I've had trouble finding a couple movies from the 70's. The first is a movie about a couple young guys in a hot rod that travel the roads looking for drag races from unsuspecting locals. They have a prototype intake manifold on their motor that they keep hidden. During the movie they run from the law and angry folks they cheated out of money. The other movie is a version of Robin Hood that had Robin join forces with the bandits in the forest to fight against the sheriff's men. Not an unusual plot but during the meeting of Robin and Lil John, Robin discovers that the staff's the men use are loaded with metal inside of the staff to re-enforce it's strength. That particular detail doesn't interest me much, but I'm using that as something that separates the movie from the other versions of Robin Hood.\n\njunekorobinson@gmail.com (Aug. 2022)\n\nThe first movie might be Two Lane Blacktop (1971).\n\nJuneko\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nAnna (2019)\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but I am looking for a TV movie or episode from 77/78/79. The only thing I can remember is small aliens crawling out of the TV and it scared my kid self to death. I can't find out what the name is or anything about it. Grateful to anyone who can help.\n\nJames Mcelroy (Apr. 2022)\n\nCould be Alien Lover 1975\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nJon Narob (2019)\n\nTrying to find the name of a movie that I think aired on a Friday on CBS in the spring of 1977. It involved two police officers who pretend to have been killed. Over the course of the film, they solve a crime only to really be killed at the conclusion. Any ideas?\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nKaletha Anderson (2019)\n\nI'm looking for a tv movie in the 70's or 80's about a black man and a white man. They were friends in the rural south. The black boy ran away after an incident that he thought he would be blamed for. He returned many years later as a sheriff, but never let on as to who he really was. Only an old aunt that lived in the black rural area of town knew who he was. His friend did not recognize him, but felt a sense of familiarity. As sheriff he had many racial problems, especially from a town bully named Foxy. Eventually, everything was cleared up and the sheriff let it be known who he was. As kids the white boy had a horse and before the black kid ran away he told his friend \"you must fed him a carrot everyday\" At the end he repeated the sentence while giving the horse a carrot, letting his idenity be known. His friend recognized him, they laughed and embraced.\n\nRandie Kirkley (2019)\n\nThis is Chiefs, based on the Stuart Woods book. It was a miniseries that aired in 1983. Billy Dee Williams and Stephen Collins were the friends.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nTheCat (2019)\n\nAn amazing list. I had to read through all of it looking for a film that I don't know the name of. Two young children, at the girl's Birthday party I believe. They get caught by a very religious mother who throws them both in the bath. The boy dies of pneumonia. I can't remember the name of the movie. It was in the 70's on TV. I remember it was a big beautiful house. lol\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nDarla Renner (2019)\n\nHi....,im looking for movie probably in the 70s about a girl and boy who are dating and his parents don't approve of her, they're wealthy and she isn't. They're in a crash and she s disfigured and the boys mom visits her and tells her she'll pay for the surgery but she had to agree to never see her son again......\n\nGodard (2019)\n\nYou are thinking of the 1979 feature film THE PROMISE starring Kathleen Quinlan and Stephen Collins.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promise_%281979_film%29\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nVictoria Soma (2019)\n\nHello, the movie I'm looking for is this: A blind girl lives in a mansion but her father hates her, because the mother died when she was born, and abuses her. A young man who escaped prition enters the commandment, meets her and falls in love, he murders the father and they flee to the countryside where they live in a store, I think. Some motorcyclists find them, beat the boy and she escapes, meets a woman in a cabin and she goes with the police. I do not remember the end very well, but it is not happy, I think it is from the end of the 70's early 80's, and I am sure that the title of the movie is the name of the girl, but I do not remember it. If you could help me it would be great. Thank you\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nDave E.

You can rent it on Prime Video.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nMichael Petronio (2019)\n\nNeed help trying to find a movie I saw as a kid.

I turned on the TV and watched a show, a movie I'm pretty sure, about a serial killer in Waikiki targeting young female tourists. Yeah, it was creepy! Any ideas?\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nsaturnia777 (2019)\n\nA movie I saw on TV in the mid to late 70's had a woman who was kidnapped and held hostage in a van with a bomb on it with a timer set to explode. I kind of remember the van being parked in a parking lot outside a baseball stadium (maybe?). Anyway, I think the guys that were holding her hostage changed their mind and were trying to rush back to get her out of the van before it exploded but they were too late and I think it exploded anyway. Sorry that's all I remember but it's driving me crazy trying to figure out what movie it was?! Thanks for any help!\n\nDavid Doepel (Sep. 2022)\n\nMight be \"Murder at the World Series\", 1977, with the Houston Astros. The hostages in the van were wives of real-life MLB players; they escape before the explosion, but the bad guys don't know that.

What caught my attention was a scene in which a young women or teenage girl was having a party at her house to presumably celebrate her birthday. During proceedings a bunch of thugs crash the party and assault the young lady. One of the thugs said \"SO THIS IS THE PARTY GIRL AH\" and then proceeded to rip the dress she was wearing. Just as things were getting hot an old man (possibly her father or grandfather) comes down stairs with a shotgun and threatened the thugs until they left. Unfortunately, not long after that my mother turned the TV off and I never ever saw anymore of it. I think the scene was probably too strong or explicit to have been in any U.S soap Opera at the time, so I can hopefully discount it from being in an old soap episode that will never be seen again.

As the saucer flies out of the solar system, the scientist watches the planets come up and the aliens tap into his brain to gather info on each planet, like mass, so they can properly use each planet's gravity to hurl them out of the solar system to catch the bad alien. I saw it as a teenager, and the name has eluded me ever since.\n\nmattmcirvin (2016)\n\nThat's \"Starship Invasions,\" a Canadian movie from 1977 with Christopher Lee (as the alien villain) and Robert Vaughn.\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nJay (2015)\n\nI am looking for a late 70's movie about a man who breaks out of prison and kidnaps the men who testified against him and had him sent to prison. He takes them out to the woods and leaves them there where they must survive on their own. One of the men was stripped to the waist and tied down to a rock under the hot sweltering sun. Dennis Weaver or Ronny Cox were in this movie. Does anyone remember this movie?\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nRenÈe K. Walker (2014)\n\nI am looking for a movie or mini-series from the 1970's that I think was part of the Sunday Night Movie type thing, but not positive. It was based on a true story about two sisters kidnapped from a Texas farm by Comanches. The sisters were rescued eventually, but one sister was traumatized and didn't do well. The other sister actually missed her Comanche family and no longer fit in with her White family. She returned to the tribe and lived with them and raised children staying with her husband until the Comanches were decimated by soldiers.\n\nMike P (2019)\n\nThe Searchers\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nRhonda Thompson (2014)\n\nim looking for a movie in the 70s about a young girl who retarded that a young couple is trying to adopt her\n\nReply this thread\n\n-----\n\nafroviking (2014)\n\nI am looking for a movie that I think was from either 60's, 70's or early 80's.

So he saw a movie instead where it's a teacher and there are a lot of flashbacks of her life and she's a prostitute, he's not sure if it's while she's a teacher still. The title is more than one word. He's even calling the friends he saw it with 40 years ago to try and figure it out and they don't remember the name either. Anyone know what this could be? He said it's the only movie he ever walked out on also (lol)\n\nBrooke (2014)\n\nWe figured it out....Searching for Mr. Goodbar\n\n-----\n\nMitch (2014)\n\nI am looking fo a 70's movie.

(All I really recall is an ethnically mixed group lounging around on a treehouse platform talking?) The group gets picked off one by one. The leader/psychologist falls for a young woman from a neighboring farm and at the end of the movie she asks him to read bible verses over the graves at the back of her family's home. She tells him that no matter what he hears, he mustn't stop reading and he mustn't turn around. Cue growling and howling as he reads in broad daylight. After he finishes, he turns and the family and their farmhouse is gone. The final scene as I recall it is him standing there shouting, \"Where is the house?!?\" Anyone else remember this?\n\nZona Gardner (2015)\n\nSounds like a Night Gallery episode w/ David Caradine and David mcCallan.\n\nTVDweeb (2014)\n\nThat's an episode of Night Gallery called The Phantom Farmhouse.

One day the doctors manage to wake him up and he has to learn everything like a baby, only he's a grown up man. He escapes the hospital and a woman has to go after him. I'm not sure this is the right plot, but I clearly remember a scene where he was in a train and sees a woman with an apple, and he behaves like a child saying \"apple\", scaring the woman. I've been looking for this film for years, but nobody seems to know about it.
