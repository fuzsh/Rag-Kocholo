I’ve always enjoyed movies, and I thought that some of my observations on films might be useful, at least to my students who took courses from me in modern culture. I had before me, also, the example of my colleague Harvie Conn, who reviewed movies for Christianity Today until the editors told him, “CT readers don’t go to movies.” (Evidently that has changed in the years since.)\n\nSo around 1992-93, I wrote up a number of reviews, with some introductory reflections on the medium. My main purpose was to use them in courses, but I also sent them around to publishers and to periodicals, in hope that I could perhaps moonlight somewhere as a reviewer, following Harvie. The responses were wholly negative. Publishers did not want to publish movie books, because they got out-of-date so fast. Periodical editors thought, well, that I should not give up my day job.\n\nHence the unmaking of a reviewer. But I have used these reviews and analytical pieces in other contexts, and the responses have not been totally negative. So I make them available now on the web. The reviews are still dated. Most are from around 1993, though I have added one or two in the years since. But with the increasing popularity of tape and DVD, there may still be interest in these particular films. More important, these reviews may be helpful to readers as they seek to evaluate more contemporary films.\n\nI should warn you that the reviews contain “spoilers.” That is, I have reviewed the films as one reviews classic literature, with freedom to describe the ending and relate that ending to the overall interpretation. If anyone cannot bear to know the endings in advance, I urge you to see the film before reading the review.\n\nAfter I go to a movie, I usually “debrief” myself, asking what the film was about, what I enjoyed, what I didn’t, etc. Sometimes my debriefing occurs in conversation with others, but often I simply sit down at the computer and type up my own review of the film, seeking to put into words my response to the experience.\n\nI have gathered some of my reviews together, with some introductory essays, to present to my students at Westminster Theological Seminary for our course called “The Modern Mind,” a critical survey of modern thought and culture. In order to teach such a course, one must have some source of regular first-hand exposure to cultural trends, and I have found that for myself films are the best means of gaining that exposure. Although I love music, I confess I find modern avant-garde music, both popular and “serious,” very hard to listen to. I have little taste for, or understanding of, modern art. Novels take too long to read; plays are too expensive. I used to watch a lot of TV but, well, we now have young children in the house, and I don’t want them to become “addicted.” I do read modern philosophy and theology, but I also need exposure to something more universally popular, to see how academic philosophical and religious ideas are reflected and anticipated in the general culture. For that purpose, film has become my medium of choice.\n\nMovie reviews are a dime a dozen; why do I add mine to the pile? Well, reviewers differ greatly in their emphasis. Most are concerned with aesthetic or technical matters, or with judgments of entertainment value. Christian reviewers tend to focus also on the moral tone of films, some actually counting the instances of sex, violence or foul language. A few reviewers offer unique perspectives. Jim Jordan, for example, brings to his reviews a rich background in literary symbolism, and he suggests patterns of symbolism in film that have subtle but profound bearing on the content of the film. All these approaches have their usefulness.\n\nI do not have Jordan’s sensitivity to symbolism. I do have thoughts about aesthetic, technical and entertainment values, which I will express from time to time in the reviews. I am obviously interested also in the moral aspects of film, though I have neither the head nor the heart for counting up dirty words.\n\nThough I have no degree in film or drama, I do have some knowledge of the history of film, having enjoyed movies and discussions of movies from childhood. I believe that my musical experience also gives me some appreciation for dramatic structure: ebb, flow and climax. But others certainly have stronger qualifications than mine for expressing opinions on these matters.\n\nWhat I do bring to the reviews is, in a word, theology. For theology is my main life work. It is Jordan’s too, and Harvie Conn’s. But perhaps because I am less knowledgeable than they about matters of cinematic detail, I tend to focus more than they on the larger picture. I see the “messages” of the films less in the context of film as such than in the context of the general culture and of those great cultural debates which are at bottom theological. My approach is to stand back from each film and ask, what is it trying to tell me? What is its world-view, its law, its gospel?\n\nThe world-view is the most important issue in film. That is the element that is most culturally influential (often in a destructive way), and it is often most central to the filmmaker’s purpose.\n\nOne of the old film moguls (Sam Goldwyn’s name comes to mind, but it may have been someone else) is often quoted as saying “If you want to send a message, call Western Union.” Many filmmakers have made this sort of claim, that their work has nothing to do with messages, with theology or philosophy, that it is nothing other than “art for art’s sake,” or, at least, “entertainment for entertainment’s sake.”\n\nI would not want to claim that art can be reduced to theology or philosophy. Art tends to be particular and concrete, while philosophy, and theology to a lesser extent, tend to be general and abstract. Art strives to entertain; theology and philosophy generally do not, although the difference here too is a matter of degree. (Plato, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard are entertaining in a way that Aristotle, Kant and Tillich are not. That fact is not irrelevant to the proper evaluation of their work.) Art does have dimensions that delight or disturb us, quite apart from any ideological content. Much of what art communicates is the ingeniousness of its own design: its colors, its musical harmonies, the juxtapositions of its scenes. In film, much of the product’s quality comes from the sheer interest of the camera angles, the harsh or soft focus, the direction of the light, the short pauses in the actors’ speech, the vast range of artistically formed detail.\n\nHaving said all of that, I must add that it is simply false to claim that art has nothing to do with “messages.” Indeed, we are living in a time in which the messages of art are becoming more and more explicit. Oliver Stone, for example, is quite explicit about the political content of his films. He is not at all embarrassed by claims that he has an axe to grind. So much the better. In the film community, directors and actors are praised on all sides for participating in films (even, often, mediocre films) that take “controversial” positions on moral/political issues. That is, they are praised when those controversial positions are the ones that are popular in the film community and in the national media.\n\nThe “art for art’s sake” rhetoric tends to appear when these controversial projects receive criticism from conservative or Christian viewers. To such criticism, the standard reply is, “Art is not philosophy and should not be judged as such. Art is above politics and religion. Art communicates only itself, not ideology.” But that reply is disingenuous. Everyone knows that it simply isn’t true.\n\nEven such concepts as beauty and form are not religiously neutral. What is beautiful to a non-Christian may very well be ugly to a Christian: homosexual romance, for instance, or the demonic simulations in Disney’s “Fantasia.” Some techniques, of course, like the use of hand-held cameras, can be used by Christians or non-Christians. A dim level of lighting in a scene does not necessarily distinguish Christian from non-Christian filmmaking. On the other hand, such dim lighting can be used to make a value judgment. A director’s choice to use dim lighting in a room for the scene of a meeting might in some contexts convey that director’s view that the characters at that meeting are fairly unsavory. That doesn’t mean that dim lighting always indicates the presence of evil; but granted other elements of the drama, it may indicate that. And of course Christians and non-Christians tend to disagree as to where evil is to be found.\n\nMessage, then, is not all there is to art, but it is an important element of it, one that is especially important to Christians who are concerned about the impact of films on their families and upon society. From one “perspective,” it is the whole: for when we ask about “message,” we are simply asking what the art as a whole is communicating to us. The message may not always be easily expressed in words, or in the terms of philosophy or theology. But attempting to express it in words is a worthy goal for a reviewer. Nor is the message of a film to be obtained in the same way we obtain the message of a philosophical treatise. Films, even Oliver Stone’s, do not simply teach or preach. But no one should have any objection to analysis of a director’s artistic decisions to see what they reveal about his vision of life.\n\nIt is usually not hard to answer the question, “What does the director want us to think (about the characters, the events, the setting, the atmosphere)?” It is usually pretty clear who are the basically sympathetic characters, who are the villains. In films as in real life there is, of course, moral ambiguity. There is good in the worst, bad in the best. But even to make such comments we must be able to use moral terms; we must be able to distinguish good from bad. The chief approach of my theological analysis of the films will be simply to ask “What does the film consider good, and what bad?”\n\nSo my reviews will basically try to sum up the “message” of each film: its ideology, its values, its world-view, its philosophy, its theology. I will comment on other elements of the film as they seem especially relevant to formulating that message. In the process I will try to observe proper distinctions between art and philosophy, especially to recognize the particularism of a film’s focus. But particularism is of no interest unless it is in some measure universal, unless it reminds its viewers of what they, too, have observed.\n\nSuch is the program underlying these reviews. I hope that readers and viewers will find them in some measure edifying. May God use them in some small or large way to strengthen the Christian presence in the contemporary world.\n\nOne word of warning: since these reviews attempt to be serious analysis rather than “viewing guides,” I will not avoid discussions of endings. Obviously, one could not meaningfully discuss “Hamlet” or “Death of a Salesman” without saying something about the endings of these dramas. The same is true about significant films. Those who can’t bear to know the ending of a film before seeing it should proceed with appropriate caution.\n\nMy thanks and appreciation go to those Christian authors who have entered this arena before me, who have endured the scorn of the world by developing a Christian interpretation of film and who have often endured the scorn of Christians because they have chosen to go to movies. Especially, I have learned from the contributions of Donald Drew, Harvie Conn, Jim Jordan, and Keith Billingsley. Much should be said also for the work of an observant Jew, Michael Medved, who has exposed the moral antagonism between Hollywood and “traditional American values.” Whether he recognizes it or not, those values he cherishes are, by and large, the values taught and advanced by the Christian gospel.\n\nSome Christians may wonder how a fellow believer can give any support to the film industry, notorious as it is for anti-Christian bias and moral relativism. I would note that there is also a view on the opposite extreme: some Christian critics of culture insist that all Christians have a responsibility to become culturally aware, to become knowledgeable about cultural trends in art, music, literature, film, drama and so on.\n\nI reject both of these extremes. A more balanced position, I think, is to recognize that Scripture tells us to be “in” the world, but not “of” the world. That means that we not only may, but should, be willing to live amid secular (=anti-Christian) influence without ourselves compromising the faith. In this respect, it doesn’t matter whether that secular influence comes from film, or from involvement in business, labor, neighborhood, politics, or whatever. Nor, within the general realm of media entertainment, does it matter whether we are talking about Beethoven or modern rock, Jane Austen or William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway or Jackie Collins, news or business magazines, TV or film, Disney films or films by Martin Scorsese. To avoid non-Christian influence altogether, we would have to live as hermits (assuming that we could even find some place in the world beyond the reach of modern communications and government). In all modern experience there is a heavy component of anti-Biblical teaching and influence. But complete isolation is not a live option for biblical Christians. Even the Christian hermits of the ancient and medieval periods justified their existence as a life of prayer, and thus a life which was, after all, in and for the world. How can we pray for a world we know nothing about? We must not seek to isolate ourselves from the world, but rather to be “salt” and “light” in our fallen culture, to carry out our Lord’s Great Commission.\n\nThat balance, of being “in” but not “of” the world, is sometimes difficult to maintain. One’s choices in this area should be based in part upon his or her own moral and spiritual maturity. Some people, especially children, or those young in the faith, or those with special problems like alcohol addiction or unusual susceptibility to sexual temptation, should limit their exposure to secular culture in appropriate ways. But at the same time they should be trained in Christian maturity, so that eventually they can enter more fully the secular arena, not fearing that they will be compromised by the culture, but expecting to influence the culture positively for Christ.\n\nI do not believe, with the Christian “culturalists,” that every Christian, or even every mature Christian, has an obligation to attend art exhibits, concerts, films, etc. Christians should seek to influence the world for Christ in some way: that is the Great Commission. But the precise way in which they reach out to the world may differ greatly from one believer to another. My brother-in-law is pastor of a church in the inner city of Philadelphia. He does not normally go to films, dramas, or art exhibits. But he is definitely “in” the world, the real world, and he ministers to it with all the strength God provides him. A knowledge of entertainment media would be of little use to him in his ministry, and I would be the last person to urge him to become “culturally aware.”\n\nYet there are others (such as myself, I believe) who are called of God to devote some of their energy to Christian culture-criticism. Many pastors, as well as youth workers, scholars, teachers, writers, parents and others are in this category. For them it is not wrong, I believe, within sensible limits, to expose themselves to modern film or other media. The apostle Paul said that he was not ignorant of Satan’s devices (2 Cor. 2:11). For that purpose, if for no other, we may be called to learn what filmmakers have to say to us.\n\nSome arguments used by Christians opposed to moderate attendance at films are as follows:\n\n(1) “Graphic acts of violence debase those who watch them, making the viewers more prone to violence.” On this proposition there is mixed statistical evidence. Some people, especially children, do seem to resort more quickly to violence, or imitation-violent play, as the result of viewing simulated violence on TV or film. I do advocate that parents limit and monitor the use of these media by their children. But I find it hard to believe that everyone should for this reason drastically curtail their film attendance. I have never myself (even in childhood, as best I can recall) felt the least bit inclined toward violence as the result of watching it on film. For the most part, viewing such violence increases my resolve toward finding non-violent solutions to problems. I think that many other people are similar to me in this respect.\n\nFurther, if we maintain a proper critical distance from the films we watch (a distance which is necessary for many other reasons), we can see that film violence is essentially choreography. No one really gets hurt. And for the most part in films, even today, unjustly violent people are not rewarded or glorified.\n\nIt is important to maintain perspective: lack of perspective is one of the most prevalent defects in Christian thought today, in my view. And the larger perspective is that violence is all around us, unavoidable. To avoid it entirely is to depart from the world. Indeed, Scripture itself contains descriptions of terrifying, even gory violence; just read the Book of Judges. Since Scripture includes such descriptions, we must assume that there are good reasons for it– reasons conducive to edification (2 Tim. 3:16, 17). It is not hard to imagine what those reasons might be. The violence of the wicked shows us what the Fall has done to us; and the violence of divine judgment summons us to repentance. On this basis we cannot deny that some exposure to depictions of violence can be edifying.\n\n(2) “Sexual scenes in movies excite impure lusts.” Again, I think this is true of some viewers, but not others. If sex scenes in films have that effect on you, then don’t go to films until God gives you a greater mastery over temptation. But I don’t think this is a problem for every Christian.\n\nBut some might go further and insist that, even for those who are not tempted toward sin by screen sex, it is wrong to view actors in the process of doing things which are sinful in themselves. (The same point has been made with regard to the use of unwholesome or blasphemous language in movie scripts.) I grant that some love scenes in the movies cross over that line of being “sinful in themselves.” True, screen sex is usually, for the actors and actresses involved, not very “sexy.” The filming of such scenes is done bit by bit, with all sorts of technical intrusions, and usually without actual genital contact. Still, if I were married to an actress who chose to engage publicly in deep kissing and simulated intercourse with a third party, I would consider myself to have been violated. In my view that is a scriptural view of the matter.\n\nSo some movie sex is certainly sinful in itself. And one cannot, certainly, justify watching sin for its own sake. I would not go to a film for the purpose of watching an actor and actress in a nude sex scene (thus I avoid “XXX” flicks), any more than I would take a walk in the park to spy on kids making love behind the bushes. On the other hand, I would not stay away from the park out of fear that I might happen to observe some illicit sex. Similarly, if film actors wish to commit sin before the camera, that is their responsibility. I don’t believe I commit sin when I, in the normal course of my cultural pursuits, observe what they, without consulting me, have chosen to do in public.\n\n(3) “Modern films promote, very effectively, a non-Christian philosophy of life.” This is true, and it is the most profound of all arguments against Christian attendance at films. Sex, foul language, and violence are incidental elements in film, but the non-Christian world- and life-view is often at its core. That world-view does more damage in society than any cinematic portrayals of sex, violence, and ungodly speech. Indeed, that world-view is what makes the sex, violence, and language in movies unwholesome, in contrast with biblical depictions of such things.\n\nBut again, perspective is in order. Non-Christian philosophy has dominated the arts and general culture for the last three centuries. To avoid exposure to non-Christian world-views and values, we would have to avoid exposure to Mozart and Beethoven, Emerson and Thoreau, Hume and Kant, Paine and Jefferson, D. W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin, and so on, not to mention Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Euripides, Cicero, and other ancients. We tend to discount older exponents of non-Christian values, viewing them with the halo that comes with long cultural acceptance. For that reason, these older thinkers are often more dangerous than those which are more contemporary and more obviously anti-Christian. Indeed, for similar reasons, we must beware of G-rated films as much as of R- and X-rated films. Yes, let us limit our exposure to all of these influences; but not to the extent of leaving the world, or to the extent of becoming ignorant of Satan’s devices.\n\n(4) “We should not give our money to an industry that encourages immorality and unbelief.” Scripture does not require believers to support only industries and institutions that are morally and religiously pure. Jesus taught his disciples to pay taxes to Caesar, taxes which supported the emperor cult, among other things. Paul taught the Corinthians to buy food in the market place without asking whether or not it had been offered to idols. Scripture is realistic enough to know that if we had to inquire about the religion or morals of every merchant before doing business with him, we could not buy at all.\n\nI do not think it is wrong for Christians to boycott industries which they believe are doing social and/or religious harm in the world. They are certainly free to withhold their economic support from those industries. On the other hand, I do not believe that Scripture @UN(requires) us to boycott such organizations. We really could not do that in every case without completely isolating ourselves from the world.\n\nI would conclude, therefore, that a moderate amount of movie-going is legitimate for most Christians. I don’t think we should be ashamed of that or even ashamed of enjoying it. Moderation, of course, requires careful thought about priorities. Even activities which are good in themselves can become wrong if they crowd out of our lives things which are more important. Each of us needs to do some self-examination in this area. Choices about exposure to entertainment and culture are not religiously neutral. But those who are conscientious about pleasing God and keeping his commandments need not feel guilty about moderate movie attendance.\n\nHarvie Conn has described film as a “cultural mirror,” a valuable reflection of contemporary attitudes, philosophies, values, lifestyles. Others, such as Michael Medved, have placed more emphasis on the idea of film as a former of culture.\n\nAs I see it, both emphases are true. The relation between film and culture is a chicken-and-egg relationship. Film is of course a product of culture, for the makers of films are people of their own time. On the other hand, within their own culture, filmmakers are often atypical. They tend to be more liberal politically, less inclined to practice religion, more open to radical social attitudes and movements, than the general population. Thus their films tend more often than not to support radicalism and to subvert traditional, especially Christian, values. When those filmmakers answer criticisms of the content of their films by saying “we are only reflecting the broader culture,” they are either being naive or dishonest. In the broader culture, there is far more interest in religion, far more family integrity, far more clean language and honest work than one would ever guess from films.\n\nIn any case, it is important when we go to the movies to take with us some understanding of what is happening in the general culture: both what is considered “traditional” and what is considered “avant-garde.”\n\nOne cannot adequately summarize the current cultural situation in a brief essay, but I will offer a summary here simply to show the reader where I am coming from in my reviews. As I see it, western culture has moved in the last three hundred years from a time of Christian dominance to a time of anti-Christian secular dominance. Even today, however, there is in western culture quite a bit of “borrowed Christian capital,” and, every now and then, Christian teaching is heard with respect.\n\nIt is possible to overestimate the role of secular liberalism in contemporary society. From the portrayals of the 1960s in popular media, especially film, one would get the impression that everybody in the United States was “dropping out,” taking drugs, protesting the war, supporting radical leftist causes. Perhaps that is what most filmmakers and their friends were doing. But most Americans were fed up with all the protests, drugs, and pompous young moralizers. They elected Richard Nixon president in 1968, and they overwhelmingly re-elected him in 1972, against George McGovern, who was the voice of the radical left. Arguably, the populace continued to move rightward through the 1970s, resulting in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. During the last thirty years, the only Democrats elected president were men who persuaded the electorate of their moderation. Overt liberals, McGovern, Mondale, and Dukakis were soundly defeated.\n\nLiberal ideas, therefore, are not nearly as pervasive within the general culture as they are in the press, educational and entertainment media. Still, they do leave their mark in important ways, largely because these media– together with the influence of government– have so much power.\n\nToday the focus of the liberal movement can be summarized by the term equality. That movement especially emphasizes, in a quasi-Marxist way, equality between men and women, between races, cultures, religions, between rich and poor.\n\nChristianity also endorses equality of all persons before divine and human law. God is no respecter of persons, and human law must not give preference to people based on wealth, gender or race. But the liberal consensus endorses unbiblical forms of equality: identical roles for men and women, abolishment of any “gaps” between rich and poor, elimination of any moral sanction against homosexuality. Ultimately, liberal equality amounts to moral relativism. But it is a moral relativism that becomes very dogmatic, very non-relativist, in asserting its own egalitarianism. Anyone who disagrees, who is not “politically correct,” must be smeared and ostracized from polite society.\n\nThe God of the Bible treats people equally in some respects, but, in other ways, he is the great divider. He separates the righteous from the wicked in his terrible judgments. He sets the non-relative moral boundaries for creatures by revealing forth his law. He has no interest in abolishing economic differences between people in this world. He establishes institutions of family, state and church, and gives different people different roles within these institutions: husband/wife/child, magistrate/citizen, elder/member.\n\nThe biblical God is able to make choices among people, because he is a person. One distinctive of personhood is rational choice. The problem with secular liberalism is that it has abandoned belief in the personal God of the Bible. In the secular view, the most ultimate features of the universe are impersonal, not personal. But an impersonal force cannot make choices. It must act on all other realities equally. An electrical current will shock anyone or anything that comes up against it. But a person can choose how he will respond to other persons and objects in its environment.\n\nRejection of the personal God of scripture inevitably brings universalism: either all are saved or all are lost. And it brings egalitarianism.\n\nThe moral relativist side of secular liberalism stems from the fact that, as Dostoyevsky noted, if God doesn’t exist, anything is permitted. But such universal permissiveness is a recipe for chaos, one which even secularists cannot easily accept. Thus they seek to replace God with another supposed absolute. (Scripture calls this process “idolatry.”) That absolute is, in most cases, their own autonomous moral judgment. Hence the “dogmatic” side of secularism. But when that dogmatism fails, when the secularists’ own judgment proves untrustworthy, then they revert to relativism: “Oh, well; nobody really knows.” Relativism and dogmatism: these are the Scylla and Charybdis of secular liberalism. Strictly these are inconsistent with one another. But they supplement and need one another. The secularist bounces back and forth from one to the other as on a pendulum.\n\nCornelius Van Til calls relativism and dogmatism by the terms “irrationalism” and “rationalism” respectively, thereby relating these themes to the traditional concerns of philosophical epistemology, theory of knowledge. Os Guinness in The Dust of Death describes them as “pessimism” and “optimism,” thus relating these motifs to practical attitudes. It is important, especially in the context of film, that we do not see these themes only as elements of a theoretical world-view or ethical system, but that we see them as attitudes which affect all areas of human life. For if someone has adopted a relativist ethic, that person will likely be in despair, “pessimism,” when it comes to making choices in any area of life. He has rejected God, the source of all meaning. What ground can he possibly have for optimism? On the other hand, he can become a dogmatic secularist instead of a relativist, even though these are two sides of the same coin. Then he may well be optimistic; but it will be a false hope.\n\nIn films, then, we must reckon with the presence both of moral relativism and of secular dogmatism. But we may also find in films traces, sometimes more than traces, of Christian ideas which, in spite of the present resistance both of the general culture and of the film industry, have managed to assert themselves. One will find large elements of Christian teaching and values in older stories set to modern films: Shakespeare plays, medieval legends, etc. And one will also find films of recent conception where Christian values are prominent. “Chariots of Fire,” “Tender Mercies,” and “A Trip to Bountiful” are recent films which, if not distinctively Christian in every way, nevertheless present distinctively Christian ideas in a favorable light. Sometimes, one finds Christian themes and symbolism in films, even films which are not in themselves supportive of Christian values. Christians should be ready to be surprised when they attend films, and not only negatively.\n\nSometimes it is easy to explain these authentically Christian elements of films, by the Christian convictions of a writer, director, or other member(s) of the filmmaking team. Other times it is not easy to explain. Sometimes it just seems as though the non-Christian filmmakers were unable to overcome the dramatic, intellectual, and moral force of the Christian revelation, and so, for once, they let it have its way.\n\nIn my reviews, as I try to bring out the “messages” of the filmmakers, I will be focusing on the themes of equality, relativism, and dogmatic idolatry. And I shall also bring out those elements in which I think God’s word has overcome cultural resistance to speak its cinematic piece.\n\nIn my discussion of film and culture, I identified the general thrust of modern secular liberalism and its antithesis with Christianity. My reviews will deal with those themes in general. Here I wish to be a bit more specific. What follows are certain questions that are always in my mind when I go to films. I would recommend that other Christian viewers ask the same questions. I will not go through this whole list in each review; I will only discuss the ones I think most important to the particular film.\n\n1. Who wrote the film? Who produced it? Who directed it? Do we know through the writings and previous work of these people anything about their philosophy of life? The previous works of actors are also important. Actors contribute much to the quality of a film, little to its fundamental conception. But actors do tend to sign on to projects with which they have some ideological affinity (assuming financial rewards are not otherwise determinative). Mel Gibson almost never takes on films with a heavy sexual element; Mickey Rourke almost always does. The presence of certain actors, granting that they sometimes go “against type,” can tell you something about the message of a film.\n\n2. Is it well-made, aesthetically? Are the production and acting values of high quality? These factors may have little to do with the “message.” But they do tend to determine the extent of the film’s cultural impact, and that is important for our purposes. If a film is well-made, it can have a large impact upon the culture for good or ill. (Of course some bad films also have a major impact!)\n\n3. Is it honest, true to its own position? This is another mark of “quality.” Generally speaking, an honest film, regardless of its point of view, will have a larger cultural impact than one which blunts its points.\n\n4. What kind of film is it? Fantasy? Biography? Realistic drama? Comedy? Obviously each film must be judged according to its purpose and genre. We don’t demand of a fantasy the kind of historical accuracy we demand of a supposedly literal biography.\n\n5. What is the world view of the film? Is it theistic or atheistic? Christian or non-Christian? If non-Christian, is its main thrust relativistic or dogmatic? How does it employ the theme of “equality?” Is there any role for providence, for God? Is the film pessimistic or optimistic? Does the action move in deterministic fashion, or is there a significant role for human choice?\n\n6. What is the plot? What problems do the characters face? Can these problems be correlated in some way with the Fall of mankind in Adam? Does the film in effect deny the Fall, or does it affirm it in some way?\n\n7. Are the problems soluble? If so, how? What methods are available to the characters so that they can find the answers they need?\n\n8. What is the moral stance of the film? Is the film relativistic, dogmatic, or both in some combination? What are its attitudes toward sex, family, human life, property, truth, heart-attitudes? What is the source of moral norms, if any? Does justice prevail?\n\n9. In comedy, what is it that is funny? What are the typical incongruities? Who is the butt of the jokes? (Christians? traditional values? the wicked? the righteous? God? Satan?) Is the humor anarchic? Is it rationality gone awry? Is it bitter or gentle? Does it rely on caricatures? If so, of whom?\n\n10. Are there allusions to historical events, literary works, other films, famous people, Scripture, etc. that would give us some idea where the filmmakers are coming from? We should remember, of course, that allusions may be negative, positive, ironic, or merely decorative. A biblical allusion does not necessarily indicate acceptance of biblical values.\n\n11. What are the chief images of the film? Is there anything interesting about the lighting, the camera angles, the sound, the timing which would reinforce a particular theme? Are there significant symbols?\n\n12. Are there any explicit religious themes? Christ-figures?1 Does the film express significant attitudes toward Christ, the clergy, or the church? Does it distort Christianity or present it at its worst? Or does it present it with some insight and/or sympathy? Does it recognize the element of personal piety in people’s lives?2 There are exceptions. If so, does it approve or disapprove of it? What about Satan, the demons, the occult? Does the film recognize their activity in some way? Is the devil taken seriously? If so, how is he dealt with? _\n\n1 Steven Spielberg’s “E. T.” is, I think, a genuine Christ figure: recall the themes of pre-existence, growth, teaching, miracle, healing, death, resurrection, ascension. Spielberg denied this parallel, but in my view it is objectively there, even if Spielberg was unconscious of it. The reason is that the human mind has a need for a gospel like that of the New Testament. Those who don’t accept that gospel often instinctively give to their idolatrous inventions powers parallel to those of Christ.\n\n2 The character of Frank Burns in the original M*A*S*H was a pious fellow who kneeled to pray at his bedside, to the scorn of his fellow soldiers. Eventually, it turned out that he was an adulterer and hypocrite. That is fairly typical of the way Hollywood portrays Christian piety.\n\nRed Garnett ……….

Written by John Lee Hancock. Photographed by Jack N. Green. Edited by Joel Cox. Music by Lennie Niehaus. Running time: 136 minutes. Classified: PG-13 (on appeal for violence, sexual content and language).\n\nSome critics have raved over this film, Clint Eastwood’s first directorial project since “Unforgiven.” Like the previous film, this one emphasizes moral ambiguity: the good in the worst of us and the bad in the best. I was not nearly as impressed with this effort, however.\n\nButch Haynes, played by Kevin Costner, is a fellow who has had a rotten childhood and has spent most of his recent years in jail. He breaks out of prison with a fellow inmate and (mainly because of his colleague’s wildness) winds up with an eight-year-old hostage. The boy’s mother is a Jehovah’s Witness, who has never permitted him to go trick or treating at Halloween time, or to celebrate Christmas, or to go to carnivals or fairs. He has never eaten cotton candy. He has understandably developed as a shy young man, not much at ease in public. His real father left the family years before.\n\nWhen Costner’s fellow escapee tries to molest the boy, Costner kills him and leaves his body in a cornfield. Then he and the boy drive away together, pursued by Texas Rangers headed by Clint Eastwood’s character, Red Garnett. Haynes becomes a surrogate father to “Buzz,” as he calls the boy. He teaches him by experience all the things from which his mother shielded him: guns, cars, sex, trick or treating.\n\nEastwood’s Garnett feels the guilt of having sent young Butch to a juvenile prison years ago, though he was quite warranted in doing that. Butch learned there how to be a criminal, and he was never able to be anything else.\n\nThe story climaxes as Haynes and Buzz receive hospitality at the home of a black farmer. The farmer slaps his own little boy around, and Haynes becomes so angry he nearly kills him. To stop him from doing this, Buzz shoots Haynes and runs away; but eventually the boy comes to recognize how much he loves his kidnapper. In time, Butch is killed by a dumb-but-imperious police sharpshooter who wrongly thinks Butch is armed. Buzz goes back to his Mom but, we imagine, will never be the same again.\n\nThere are routine plot elements here: jail break, abduction, car chases, detective work, growing friendship between kidnapper and victim. But the film plays down these elements in favor of the personal relationships. It is essentially about fathers (biological and surrogate) and sons: Haynes and his rotten father, Buzz and his, Haynes and Buzz, Garnett and Haynes, the black sharecropper and his boy. Cruelty to children is the one thing Haynes cannot abide. That is, we are told in effect, what provokes him to his most violent acts. But as a surrogate father to Buzz, he gains a certain nobility, according to the film.\n\nAs a Christian, however, I resisted the movie’s values. I will not comment on the theological differences between the Jehovah’s Witness cult and Christian orthodoxy, though there are many. Nor will I expound on the difference between the evident legalism of Buzz’s mother and the ethics of Scripture, though much could be said about that as well. Hollywood knows nothing of such distinctions. To this film, the Jehovah’s Witnesses are bad, not because they are heretical or legalistic, but because they stand for “straight” values, against the values of Hollywood and modern culture. On this score, I will have to side with the Witnesses. Buzz’s mother is trying hard to stand against the tide of decadence. For all her heresy and legalism, she is trying to shield her boy from the world. Haynes is trying, essentially, to undo that. The film sides with Haynes; I do not.\n\nThus for all the film’s attempts at moral profoundity (i.e. recognizing moral ambiguity), it mostly left me cold. Butch Haynes is a murderer and a thief. Is he to be excused because of his bad upbringing? Does he redeem himself by arousing Buzz’s selfish instincts? Not in my book. Of course it is hard not to sympathize with any character played by Kevin Costner. All his movements (in all of his films) proclaim that he is a nice guy. But the choice of Costner for this role is part of the film’s propaganda. It virtually commands us to sympathize with Haynes. Can we resist that command? Another reason not to leave your critical faculties at home when you go to the movies.\n\nThis is a Horton Foote script from a novel about a Presbyterian minister and his two sons living in Montana in the early twentieth century. Foote also wrote “Tender Mercies” and “A Trip to Bountiful,” two films praised in Christian circles for their sympathetic treatment of Christian convictions (a rare commodity in recent movies). Here, too, the religious family is viewed with sympathy. But in this film the father is a rather liberal pastor, or so his sermons would indicate. Although the pastor spoke with some eloquence about human life, I heard nothing in his preaching or elsewhere that reminded me of the biblical gospel. We should remember the argument of J. Gresham Machen that liberalism and Christianity are two different and antithetical religions.\n\nAt any rate, the pastor is also an expert fly fisherman, and, we are told in the introduction, in their family it was hard to draw the line between theology and fishing. He was a home schooler too. We see him telling his boys the nuances of writing. (“Now try it again, but make it half as long.”) And he taught them to fish.\n\nThe older son went to college and eventually became a professor of English. The younger stayed at home and become a newspaper reporter. As the current birth-order literature would lead you to believe, the younger son is somewhat less “responsible” than the older one. (I write as a first sibling.) He gets drunk a lot, gambles, goes out with a woman of the wrong race, eventually gets himself killed.\n\nBut shortly before his death, he goes fishing again, with his Dad and his older brother. As the older ones look on, in astonishment, he plays a fish with a skill that elicits from the script the language of divine inspiration. For the three, it is a moment of inexplicable beauty and wonder.\n\nThe mysticism of the moment stays with the older son, and at the end of the film, after many years have passed, he stands by the river and looks back on those times. He sees all the people, all the times and places coming together in a single flow, “and a river runs through it.”\n\nThe theology of the film, therefore, reveals itself as monistic: all is one. The brother is dead, but he is alive in memory. In his moment of glory, he ascended to a higher level of being, and in time all of us will be part of him and he part of us. The boy’s dissipation and death, in the final analysis, are of no consequence.\n\nWell, that’s what many people would like to believe today. It is very far from Christianity; in fact it is the very nemesis of Christianity, which maintains distinctions between God and man, between one human being and another, between good and evil, between fishing and theology, between death and life. Do we really want to believe that a life of dissipation can be atoned for by a skillful fishing performance? I realize that question rather trivializes the film which is in many ways beautiful and thoughtful. But let us not simply accept the mesmerizing effect which this film seeks to work on us. Let us ask what it is that we are being taught, and hear it, not as part of the “flow,” but with a Christian thoughtfulness which is not afraid to question such a seductive drama as this.\n\nMorticia ……….

Based on characters created by Charles Addams. Photographed by Donald Peterman. Edited by Arthur Schmidt. Music by Mark Shaiman. Running time: 88 minutes. Classified: PG-13 (for macabre humor).\n\nThis is a movie about murder and the occult, played not for horror, but for laughs. As a comedy, this is a corker. The script and sight gags are enormously funny. It moves fast, not making the mistake of many comedies which take forever to set up a gag only to have it fall flat. In this film, the punch lines are rapid in coming, often in only one word. Girl at summer camp to Wednesday Addams: “Why are you dressed like someone died?” Wednesday: “Wait.” Watch the scenes carefully for details, like the boiling, smoking witches’ brew in the drinks at the cocktail party.\n\nThe performances are great: Raul Julia as the new Fernando Lamas/ Ricardo Montalban/ Cesar Romero, the stereotypical Latin lover. Anjelica Huston as Morticia, communicating volumes with her eyebrows. The chemistry between them, especially their incredible dance number, transcended the genre. I especially enjoyed Christina Ricci, the young actress who played daughter Wednesday. She played the part so straight, so somber, that whenever she broke a smile it was hilarious.\n\nThe plot develops in three directions: (1) the Addams’ new baby and the comic-murderous sibling rivalry of his sister and brother, (2) the older kids’ experience at summer camp which leads to a flaming Armageddon, (3) uncle Fester (an unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd) marrying a “black widow,” a supposed governess who marries wealthy men and then disposes of them on her honeymoon. (Her disgruntlement over her failure to murder Fester is wonderful to behold.)\n\nChristians may well wonder whether it is legitimate for them to laugh at this sort of thing. After all, we take very seriously such things as mass murder and witchcraft.\n\nSome, too, have quoted Proverbs 14:9 in the translation “Fools make a mock at sin” to indicate that Christians should never laugh at anything evil. However, the NIV translation, “Fools mock at making amends for sin, but good will is found among the upright” is a legitimate possibility and seems to fit the context better. And can we forget entirely the jokes that Jesus tells about rich fools, those who strain at gnats, and the like?\n\nNow at one level, laughter about such things is not hard to justify. God laughs at the wicked (Psm. 2:7), and one “perspective” on Scripture is that God’s redemptive plan is a great joke upon the wicked. God’s wisdom, foolish to the world, makes the world look foolish (I Cor. 1, 2). But in this particular movie, the wicked win out. Indeed, the Addams monsters, murderers and ghouls attract most all of the audience’s sympathy. (The “straight” people in the film are hideously unattractive.) Should we be embarrassed about laughing, to say nothing of cheering them on?\n\nThe laughter here is based on the old premise, common to many New Yorker cartoonists, not only the late Charles Addams, that famous and infamous people must have some kind of ordinary home life: Napoleon taking out the garbage, etc. I remember one New Yorker cartoon in which a king in full regalia walks into a living room, throws his beautifully jeweled crown on a hat rack and says “honey, I’m home.” The ironic juxtaposition between his political dignity and his “typical” home life evokes laughter. The Addamses are like that: monsters, to be sure, but with “family values” that are in some ways “just like you and me.”\n\nBut Christians know better than most people that wickedness destroys “typical family life.” Most mass murderers are “loners,” as we are told over and over again in the press. Witches and ghouls are not usually “family” people. Going against God’s order in one area of life tends to produce dislocations in other areas, and the family is usually the first to undergo distortion. The family is a delicate institution. Its preservation requires close attention to God’s laws.\n\nSo the idea of murderers and witches having a typical American family life is all the more absurd to those who know Christ. We know it just can’t be so. Thus we can be amused at the fantasy. It is like a pig dancing the tango. It is funny, because it just doesn’t happen. When the older Addams kids try several times to kill their baby brother, we know perfectly well that no real family could survive the crisis. (It enhances my amusement to note that had the events of the film taken place in California, Child Protective Services would have torn the Addams Family apart ten minutes into the first reel.) That the family remains together and resolves the whole thing with some bizarre rationality and good feeling satirizes neatly not only the wicked, but also the psychiatric establishment, which mandates “acceptance” as therapy. When the Addams kids burn down their summer camp, evidently destroying the majority of kids and counselors in the process, we know that in the real world they would be sent to a juvenile detention facility. But there they are in the next scene, back at home again, having a great time.\n\nHumor is often based on discrepancy, and good humor reveals important discrepancies in the world. The largest discrepancy is between God’s created order (the family) and human sin (the Addams’ lifestyle). Humor which underscores that discrepancy says much that needs to be said in our time. “Addams Family Values,” though not informed by Scripture, recognizes the absurdity of family coexisting with monstrosity; therefore, in one sense, it is an edifying movie. I believe that God is pleased to see us laughing at it.\n\nBut not to see us cheering them on. Unfortunately, the great comedy in this movie is a kind of lure. It offers us scripturally proper laughter to guide us into scripturally improper attitudes. While a Christian would (or should) find the situation entirely ridiculous, the filmmakers actually seem to be taking it seriously, at a certain level. To them, the “ordinary home life” of the murderers, ghouls, and vampires is not just an ironic bit of nonsense. Rather, the Addamses seem to be a kind of symbol of all those groups in society which are misunderstood and oppressed. This is especially evident in the summer camp adventure. The camp establishment is a political liberal’s nightmare: rich WASP bigots who demand of everyone else happy, Disneyesque, smiling faces. Wednesday and Pugsley Addams, however, befriend Jews, blacks, and handicapped, and they come on with an “attitude.” Of course, according to the film, they are the only ones in camp with any brains at all. When the camp director puts on a maudlin Thanksgiving pageant, the Addams and their friends, forced to participate in Indian costume, turn it into a demonstration for Native American rights, and hence a massacre. The film seems to be saying that all the WASP campers deserve to die because they are not politically correct.\n\nThere is also at least a hint of support to animal rights. At the pageant, Pugsley comes on dressed as a turkey, singing “eat me,” “eat me.” Unlike Wednesday’s Indians, Pugsley is following the script of the WASP camp director, who hates all minorities and who, by writing this song, we gather, also oppresses the turkey population.\n\nSo, by analogy, the Addams are just another victim group. They are just like you and me, except that society has misunderstood them. Sure, the kids try several times to murder their baby brother; but underneath it all, their hearts are pure, because they defend Native American claims to the continent. Indeed: who do the “straights” think they are, telling other people what a “family” should be? Doesn’t any group which lives together in love, after a fashion, constitute a family? (Where have we heard that before?) Don’t the Addamses, after all, have “family values” in the best sense?\n\nI suppose the filmmakers could chide us at this point for taking it all too seriously. Perhaps they could even make a case that the movie is a satire on political correctness. Maybe so, to some extent. Indeed, I prefer to take it that way, for as such it makes better comedy. But there is no doubt that this film is on the side of the witches. In the best comedies, the major comic characters are never scum, never mere fools, though some of the supporting characters may be. In some way, the lead figures evoke the sympathy of the audience. Think of Chaplin, or Peter Sellers’ Inspector Clouseau, or Mickey Mouse. (There are exceptions, like Leslie Nielsen’s Frank Drebin in the “Naked Gun” series. But while that series is quite funny, most of us would not list it among the “great” comedies.) The filmmakers want us not only to laugh at the Addamses, indeed not only to love them, but also to admire them in some respects. But these are not, on the whole, candidates for Christian admiration. I admit that they do stand by their convictions and support their constituency, which they consider to be oppressed; but, after all, so did Hitler. So be careful. Do laugh, but don’t leave your critical faculties at the door.\n\nWritten and Directed by Woody Allen\n\nI saw Woody Allen’s Celebrity, a fairly dreary film at one level. It presented the usual Allen line about how all intellectual thought, social relationships, etc. is merely a quest by everybody to get the most fame, money, thrills, and sex. Kenneth Branagh plays Woody Allen (evidently Woody, the director, didn’t like Branagh’s attempt to mimic his director; but who other than a Woody-type could say the lines written by Woody, the writer?) and drifts from woman to woman, betraying and being betrayed, absurdly transparent in his motivations and silly in his flatteries and rationalizations.\n\nBut there is also the wife of the Branagh character, who he casts off at the beginning of the film and who goes searching for help of various kinds. There is the Roman Catholic Church, but the priests are as banal as the New York society, in their own way. She also goes to a famous makeover expert and eventually does get made over. One expects her to end in the same kind of despair as the Branagh character. But she fares better. The difference is grace.\n\nA man, played by Joe Mantegna, pops in on her makeover doctor’s office while she is making plans for the physical transformation. But Mantegna says she is fine as she is. In context, it seems like a boldface lie. She is not attractive at all. But as she gets involved with this man, we notice changes, and not only from the makeover.\n\nShe hesitates about marriage, at one point leaving Mantegna at the altar. For she is “waiting for the other shoe to drop.” This man seems all too perfect. He must be an axe murderer or something. But she talks to a fortune teller (!) who tells her simply to trust. She does, marries, and finds happiness. The Mantegna character seems in retrospect to be a Christ-surrogate. He demands nothing of her, changes her life by giving her undeserved respect and love.\n\nJesus does take us as we are, but he does not tell us we are perfectly ok, as we are. Rather, he shows us our sins and takes us through the path of repentance. There is no repentance in this film, but there is something like grace. But how can grace function without standards? That is an important theological question, and it is also a question in our interpersonal relationships.\n\nBut at least the film admits that we need help, and that help must be quite out of the ordinary if it is to meet our need. The movie begins and ends with a skywriter writing “HELP.” At the end, the Branagh character watches the writing (as part of a film) and sits dazed. Only his ex-wife has found the help for which the film cries to heaven.\n\nPink ………….. Jason London\n\nSimone ………… Joey Lauren Adams\n\nMichelle ………. Milla Jovovich\n\nPickford ………. Shawn Andrews\n\nSlater ………… Rory Cochrane\n\nMike ………….. Adam Goldberg\n\nGramercy presents a film written and directed by Richard Linklater. Produced by James Jacks, Sean Daniel and Richard Linklater. Photographed by Lee Daniel. Edited by Sandra Adair. Running time: 97 minutes. Classified: R (for pervasive, continuous teen drug and alcohol use and very strong language).\n\nThis film is a somewhat darker version of “American Graffiti,” set about ten years after that film, in 1975. Again, it is the last day of high school, and the kids are living it up before going on into the world or into the next year of school. As with “Graffiti,” there is a lot of cruising, drinking, sex. I don’t remember if the kids in “Graffiti” smoked pot, but these kids do. Also, as with “Graffiti,” there are many subplots that weave in and out of one another.\n\nPerhaps the most dominant one (among equals) is the story of the quarterback on next year’s (potentially powerhouse) football team. His coach, presented as fifty years behind the times, wants the whole team to sign a pledge that they won’t drink, smoke or use drugs all summer, for the sake of the team. The big moment, supposedly, is when the kid throws the pledge back in the coach’s face unsigned and tells him that although he’d like to play football, he will never sign such a document. The film sees this as his great rite of passage, the quarterback’s affirmation of autonomy.\n\nThe school has a tradition in which the seniors beat up on the incoming freshmen (girls on girls, boys on boys). There is a lot of supposed fun with the seniors chasing the frosh and the frosh getting even. As one who used to get beaten up by bigger kids when returning home from school, I didn’t find that whole theme very funny, but others might look at it differently. The “initiation” process, however, is for these kids another rite of passage. After the senior boys paddle the freshman boys within an inch of their lives, they introduce them to their world of booze, girls, pot, vandalism, cussing, etc.\n\nThe movie seems to be saying that this is the right world to be a part of. The adults who try to restrict access to it, especially the coach, are presented as demons and impossible reactionaries. The kids who join that society are simply doing what they must do, and nobody has a right to tell them otherwise. Indeed, the heroic thing is to defy or deceive the straight adults as much as possible.\n\nThere are no tragedies in this film. Nobody dies of an overdose or an auto crash. Indeed, there is very little plot. It’s just a slice of life, well-directed and convincing in its portrayals.\n\nBut the message of the film is appalling. Apparently it never occurs once to the filmmakers that the values of autonomy and peer-acceptance which they romanticize here are the values that have put our very civilization in jeopardy. Nor do they see anything wrong with the teen society which rationalizes drugs, drunkenness, fights, free sex, and hatred of the “straight” world. Many movies today have progressed beyond this moral viewpoint, though it was certainly the dominant one in the 1960s and ’70s. For it is now painfully evident that there is a huge downside to this kind of teen-age fun. But this film is quite complacent about its ’60s sensibility concerning the ’70s. Someone should tell the makers of this film that they are the ones who are reactionary. The only ones whose message will not fade with time are those who get their values from God’s Word.\n\nThis movie, starring Sylvester Stallone, is something more than its title (and the previews) suggest. It is certainly a very violent film, with Stallone and Wesley Snipes spilling blood and bodies all over the place. But it is also a rather tongue-in-cheek look at the possible outcomes of present-day trends.\n\nThe premise is that in the mid-90s, the level of violence in Los Angeles exceeds even the tolerance of laid-back Californians, and they succumb to the plans of a would-be Messiah named Cocteau. By the 2030s, he has set up a society where everybody’s whereabouts are known (by an electronic device surgically implanted in their hands) and where behavior is carefully monitored. There is no cholesterol, fat, meat, toxics, air pollution, noise pollution, smoking, guns. Because of AIDS and other diseases, there is no sex, at least no “exchange of bodily fluids.” I leave it to you to find out what Stallone and his pretty policewoman friend do on their first date.\n\nAnything “bad for you” is illegal. Bad language is forbidden: when someone utters profanity, a ticket comes out of a nearby machine removing a “credit.” There is, of course, no money; only electronic transactions of “credits” monitored by the government. Criminals are frozen and programmed (while frozen, I gather, though I find that hard to believe) via electrodes attached to the head, to learn new skills and habits. Everybody walks around with Polyannish dispositions, at least on the outside. This is the ultimate Nanny State.\n\nIts cultural barrenness is symbolized by its popular music, which consists of 1950s and 60s commercial jingles, believe it or not. And because of the “franchise wars,” all restaurants in the area are Taco Bells!\n\nUnderstandably, when Simon Phoenix, the Snipes character, escapes from his ice prison and runs around killing people, the police are quite incapable of dealing with him. They have never seen real violence, and they have no idea how to deal with anyone so barbaric. Thus they release the Stallone character, John Spartan, who apprehended Phoenix in the 1990s. Sly shows the wimpish police how to fight.\n\nIt turns out that Phoenix’s escape was actually arranged by Cocteau, who wants him to go underground and kill the leader of what he considers a rebellious group. Actually, the rebels are just plain folks, who treasure their freedoms and don’t want to live in Cocteau’s New Order. They like their guns and their junk food; they like to cuss. Unfortunately, they have a hard time getting food; most of the time they “have to” steal it from the world above. So they stage raids on the New Order from time to time. This irritates Cocteau no end, who sends Phoenix to dispose of them. Unfortunately for the plan, Phoenix kills Cocteau (among many others) and puts himself in control of things, briefly, until Stallone gets to him. How could Cocteau have been so stupid as to believe that he could control that mad dog Phoenix? Especially after he programmed Phoenix in his ice cube to be even badder than he was in 1995? But in this sort of movie, logic is a luxury.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of logic, whatever happened to the daughter that Spartan just had to find? After the beginning of the movie, we never hear of her again. Perhaps they decided to save her for Demolition Man II.\n\nThe chases and violence are rather long and tiresome. I don’t take them very seriously, for it is mostly choreography, but I suspect some people might be nauseated by it.\n\nWhat is interesting, of course, and often very funny, is the social satire. The movie takes as its targets, as few have, many liberal notions: “political correctness” and its attempts at thought control, extreme environmentalism, government activism, the tendency of liberal governments to “protect us from ourselves.” The film sides against all of this and in favor of the plain folks who love freedom.\n\nBut to my mind, the plain folks, though presented as much more attractive people, are not much better than the New Order gang. Their goal is autonomy. They don’t want to take orders from anybody, and the freedom they want is to shoot guns, cuss, smoke, listen to rock music, and steal. I think if I lived among them, I’d find the New Order rather attractive.\n\nSo the film presents two alternatives: extreme liberalism and secular libertarianism. More or less. The extreme “liberals” also prohibit abortion; but didn’t the filmmakers know that there is a vast difference between the anti-abortion mentality and the mindset that says “what’s bad for you is illegal?”\n\nAt the end, with Cocteau and Phoenix out of the picture, Stallone brings together representatives of the two groups and tells them to find a happy medium somewhere. But is that the answer for society? A happy medium between totalitarianism and anarchy? Those seem to be the alternatives apart from Christian standards. The film’s value is to make that plain.\n\nApart from biblical revelation, how can anyone determine where the prerogatives of government end and the rights of the individual begin? The difficulty of this question pressures secular political theorists toward the extremes of totalitarianism and anarchy. Scripture, however, places both government and the individual under God and establishes the limits for both. Without it, Stallone’s happy medium society seems destined to fall again into chaos or tyranny. And that will doubtless set the stage for the sequel.\n\nI went to see Diary of a Mad Black Woman which was a deeply Christian film. I wouldn’t have gotten that impression from any of the critics. It wasn’t real smoothly done, and I cringed at some things that the film seems to approve of. But on the whole, it was a memorable taste of African-American Christianity.\n\nThe heroine, played by Kimberly Elise, is treated very badly by her lawyer husband, kicked out of the house with nothing, watching her rival displace her. She is of course mad at the world, finds it difficult to trust anybody, especially men. But a man enters her life, a man who is so absolutely perfect that I cringed; but perhaps, on reflection, he is a Christ figure. He woos her with complete gentleness and understanding, and when they begin kissing and lying down together, there is no sex, only “intimacy.” At this point, she renounces her old life, allows her husband to take everything in the divorce settlement.\n\nBut then the husband is paralyzed by one of his clients, and the heroine goes back to him, torments him a bit (after his girlfriend has left him), but eventually nurtures him back to health. There’s a remarkable scene at a church service at which the husband puts his crutches down and another subplot is resolved. Everybody sings praise to Jesus, then goes to Grandma’s for dinner. (Grandma is a comic character, played by director Tyler Perry in drag.) Then the heroine presents divorce papers to her husband and runs to rejoin the Christ-figure suitor.\n\nTo a Christian, there should be problems with the film’s attitude toward divorce, and to some of the language. But the Lord’s name is used very often, not in vain. Everyone in the film (except the profane Grandma and her brother) profess to be Christians, and eventually everybody is reconciled as much as one can imagine.\n\nThis is a wonderful English film. The English often have a great facility for presenting accounts of the utterly unexpected, with total credibility. “Enchanted April” is a case in point.\n\nTwo women from dysfunctional marriages decide to go for a vacation together at an Italian villa. There they meet two more women: one gorgeous model, fleeing from her celebrity, and one cantankerous older woman who recalls her younger days among people of culture.\n\nEventually, the husbands of the first two women arrive, and we are prepared for the usual movie stuff: angry fighting between spouses and sexual games. Indeed, the film sets up the audience with all the premises of the sex farce: both men are attracted to the glamorous model, and there is much discussion about who will sleep where. We expect that there will be much farcical bumping around in the night, as the men go after the pretty woman.\n\nWhat happens, however, is entirely different, and shockingly wonderful. Both marriages are repaired, and the single women are reborn, so to speak. Through his wife’s assistance, one of the men makes a valuable business contact, in such a way that he comes to appreciate anew what his wife means to him. In the end, everyone is happy; all have learned to look at life differently. Nor does it happen in ways obviously “concocted” by maudlin filmmakers. Rather, the development is entirely credible in both script and performance.\n\nIt is not a Christian movie, particularly. But it honors a lot of things important to Christians: marriage, the beauties of creation, reconciliation, love, inter-generational compassion. It twists, perhaps even satirizes, the conventions of the Hollywood sex farce. One expects in movies to see the libertines laughing at the “straights.” Here it is the straights that get the last laugh.\n\nStarring Liam Neeson\n\nBased on the novel by Edith Wharton. Ethan is a sturdy, promising young New Englander, whose ambitions are thwarted by his mother’s sickness and death. After his mother dies, he marries a distant cousin who has been tending to his mother’s needs. She then becomes sickly herself and calls on another distant cousin to come and care for her. The second woman herself seems sickly at first, but eventually recovers and becomes strong and vivacious, enough to seduce Ethan while his wife is visiting a doctor in a distant town. Whether or not the wife knows of this, she sends the caretaker away on the basis of petty criticisms, intending to hire another caretaker. Ethan, very much in love, takes her to the train, trying to persuade her to leave with him for Florida, which stands for heaven in the movie’s symbolism. In the course of the afternoon, Ethan asks her to tell him her heart’s desire: it is to go sledriding down the tall mountain near the town. Ethan procures a sled, and they have a good time together until a terrible accident leaves Ethan with a lame leg and the girl– well, sickly. We see the old Ethan, now a recluse, doing manual labor to support the two sickly women who now live with him at home.\n\nIt’s all told very deadpan, but the ironies are great: a man frustrated by three sickly women. God conspires against him, or so it seems.\n\nLt. Charles Gatewood ……. Jason Patric\n\nBrig. Gen. George Crook …. Gene Hackman\n\nAl Sieber ……………… Robert Duvall\n\nGeronimo ………………. Wes Studi\n\nLt.

Classified: PG-13 (for frontier violence).\n\n“Geronimo” presents again the revisionist view of Native Americans seen earlier in such films as “Dances With Wolves,” “Last of the Mohicans.” All three of these films are beautifully directed and photographed, with sympathetic portrayals of the Indian point of view. Generally speaking I tend to be critical of “political correctness,” but I liked these films very much, and their presentation of the Indians’ case is really compelling, a needed balance to the “murderin’ redskins” stereotype.\n\n“Dances” did demonize whites, except for the lead character, played by Kevin Costner. (How did he get to be so wonderfully broad-minded after growing up in such a depraved culture?) It also demonized the Pawnee, because they helped the whites. But its portrayal of the Indians’ lives was superb. It was all done in the Sioux language, with subtitles, and that made it all the more effective. Graham Greene gave a marvelous performance as the main Indian character.\n\n“Mohicans” was actually somewhat biased toward the whites. Magua, the voice of Indian grievances, was presented (of course as James Fenimore Cooper did in the original volume) as somewhat unreasonable in his hatreds. But he did get to make his case, and allowing for exaggerations, it was cogent.\n\n“Geronimo” is also a most impressive film, with an excellent performance by Wes Studi as the title character. (He also played Magua in “Mohicans.”) The action takes place mostly among Monument-Valley-type buttes (like hundreds of other westerns, it seems), but in this picture, the buttes are often dwarfed by snow-capped Rockies. I thought at first that was a bit much, but the film seems to focus on the greatness of the land and the importance of a just distribution of it. Why, says Geronimo, do the whites have to haveall of it? Good question.\n\nHis argument essentially is that he is not a murderer, but a warrior. And that is simply true. There was a war between the whites and the Indians and, as it turned out, the whites won. We may think what we want about that, but we should set it in perspective. For thousands of years, nations have been conquering nations. It is not a pleasant experience, especially for the conquered, and we would often like to believe that we would never permit that sort of thing to happen today. But it is still happening in our own day, even in supposedly civilized Europe. The Indians may have a grievance, but no more than any other conquered people. And, to be fair, most all nations, including whites and Indians, have been both conquerors and conquered at some time in their history.\n\nThe history is, of course, more complicated than any of these films present. One gets the impression from them that the Indians held some legal title to all the land in North America, and the whites came in entirely against the will of the landowners. Actually, “land ownership” was not a big thing with Indians; on that account they are often praised. (One cannot, by the way, simultaneously praise the Indians for their lack of concern about land ownership and then turn around and say that their owners’ rights were violated.) And the coming of the whites was welcomed by some of the Indians. They were happy to enter into fur trades and the like, which supplied them with additional resources, not to mention the new technology of guns and horses. Indeed, the expansion of trade improved some Indians’ living standard considerably.\n\nOf course, some Indians resisted the whites from the start. But the continent was certainly big enough for both the immigrants and the earlier inhabitants (they were immigrants too) to live together in peace. Ultimately, however, that proved impossible. What should have happened? As a believer in relatively free immigration, I don’t believe the whites should simply have stayed out, or that the Indians should have kept them out. The best thing that could have happened (I say with hindsight) was a legal division of the continent some time early in the process, wherein one part of the continent would be developed as a part of western civilization, with Indians welcomed to be a part of that if they chose. The other part, perhaps the greater part of it, would be left to the Indians to observe their traditional way of life. The two nations would freely trade with one another. (I still wonder if it might be possible to give to the Indians some of the huge tracts of federal lands in the west– not as reservations, which are an atrocity, but as the Indians’ own sovereign territory.) Of course, that didn’t happen, and it couldn’t have, granted the events and the mentalities of the people involved.\n\n“Geronimo” is somewhat more balanced in its perspective than either of the other films I have mentioned. The warriors on both sides are simply that: men at war. They are neither glorified nor demonized, and the film makes it clear that neither side is monolithic in its attitudes. There are “hawks” and “doves” in both armies, some who are cruel, some who seek justice. There is little moralizing here, but the film ultimately sides with the Indians, I would say. The American soldiers aren’t bad people, except, perhaps, for General Miles who takes over the army late in the film. But the political situation takes on a life of its own, and it becomes impossible for the Indians even to save face, let alone to obtain justice.\n\nThere are some rather subtle religious themes in the picture. The exquisitely beautiful musical score, by Ry Cooder, is based on the “shape note” hymns of the nineteenth century, found in such volumes as “Sacred Harp” and “Southern Harmony.” You may recognize “Come, Ye Sinners, Poor and Wretched” and “Poor, Wayfaring Stranger.” This literature was largely Biblical, but with a tendency toward religious escapism: longing for heaven without much sense of anything to do on earth. It’s a bit hard to see why the film makes so much use of this music, except for period atmosphere. Certainly at least it conveys something of the harshness of life on both sides, the impossibility of any happiness this side of the grave. Perhaps there is also some subtle mockery of the irrelevance of the white men’s religion to the achievement of concrete justice.\n\nBoth Geronimo and Gatewood (the most sympathetic white soldier) believe in gods of love, they say. But for Geronimo, love for his people requires him to kill whites. Geronimo gives Gatewood a turquoise piece valuable (perhaps religiously?) to the Apache. Later, Gatewood gives Geronimo a cross, which he says has brought him good fortune. The cross doesn’t do much for Geronimo and his people. Perhaps the most significant religious event is that before three Indians are hanged, one of them tells onlookers in the Apache language not to believe anything that the white clergy say to them.\n\nThe film doesn’t show it, but I understand that late in life Geronimo became a Christian and reconciled himself to the US government, even riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s inaugural parade. It would have been interesting to see how all of that came about. Of course, focus on those events would probably have been inconsistent with the purposes of these filmmakers. They are not, of course, required to tell everything. But we should demur a bit from the viewpoint of a film in which the actual facts, even very interesting facts, are omitted because inconvenient to the film’s “message.”\n\nConfederate Cast:\n\nLongstreet ……………..

Running time: 4 hours and 18 minutes, including 20-minute intermission. Classified: PG.\n\nThis is a very informative film about the pivotal battle in the Civil War. It is a drama, but it also has all the elements of a good documentary. It is as if we were looking over the shoulders of those planning and executing the strategy. I grew up in Pennsylvania and have visited the battlefield several times, but I never before knew what actually went on. Now I feel that I do have a general idea of that, and it is quite a story. It is a fit subject for documentary, and for drama too.\n\nThe pivotal dramatic point was the overconfidence of General Lee and its genesis: bad intelligence, then desperation, then a mystical faith. Lee had come to Pennsylvania fresh from some major victories, hoping to wrap up the war in a few days. Ironically, July 4 was approaching. Lee sensed the irony: maybe he could achieve southern independence that very day. He hoped to destroy the Army of the Potomac, headed by the ineffectual General Meade, and then march triumphant into Washington, offering peace to President Lincoln.\n\nBut various problems developed. General J. E. B. Stuart, charged with tracking the union armies with his cavalry, somehow got lost for some days and didn’t accomplish his task. (If the movie told me why, I missed it.) The south had to fight, therefore, without their usual knowledge of the enemy’s positions and strength. Then another general failed to obey orders given him to take a small hill which would have given Lee the advantage of position. Eventually the union army took over that hill and defeated the southern soldiers who tried to take it from them. After this, ammunition and supplies were very low. Lee’s troops had to either fight or retreat. Lee saw a retreat as a betrayal of the brave men who had given their lives to get this far, and his past victories gave him the confidence that his men could win another battle, even against substantial odds. With the aforementioned mystical faith, Lee sent his troops on a suicidal march for a mile across an open field in the face of union guns. The defeat was devastating, and Lee was humiliated, but hoped to fight another day.\n\nThis is not a preachy film. However, it does take some dramatic license, speculating about attitudes and conversations among characters. As such, it certainly does more than simply narrate the facts; it has a point of view. There are a lot of conversations about the Meaning of Life and Death.\n\nThe southerners, the philosophical ones, anyway, seem to be Bible-believing Christians for the most part. We get the impression that some of their problems are caused by an inordinate faith in God, or at least a proud confidence that God was on their side. The northerners are also Christians, but they seem more modern somehow. The Chamberlain character, played by Jeff Daniels, is a Professor of Rhetoric and Theology at Bowdoin College. He is the real hero of the movie, incredibly courageous, resourceful, eloquent, wise, compassionate. The theology of the northern soldiers is mainly a theology of racial equality, presented in such terms as to suggest the “political correctness” movement of the 1990s. Indeed, Chamberlain is a real sensitive 1990s male who can nevertheless fight with the best of them when he must.\n\nIn the end, Lee (in his disappointment, to be sure) sounds less like a Christian than like a nihilist: he observes that it really doesn’t matter who wins or loses, that we all play out our roles in life, but without hope that it will make much difference. I doubt if the historical Lee was that close in his philosophy to modern existentialism.\n\nSo there are hints of modern ideologies, both equality and nihilism, without much reflection on the consistency between these two ideas.\n\nIn general, however, the movie is a learning experience. There is some graphic violence, but that isn’t overdone considering the subject matter of the movie. Four hours is a bit much, but I found the time spent well worth-while.\n\nDaniel ………… Michael J.

Photographed by Gabriel Beristain. Edited by Tony Lombardo. Music by Randy Edelman. Running time: 113 minutes. Classified: PG-13 (for language).\n\nThis film is not a great one, by any means, but there are a few good laughs in it. The idea is that rich Uncle Joe, played by Kirk Douglas, has a horrid family of people who are totally devoted to inheriting his vast wealth, no matter what it takes. The skull-duggery is sometimes funny, most often tedious. When filmmakers ask the audience to spend a couple hours watching thoroughly unpleasant people, they should really give us more in return than they give us here. Scheming can be fun, in a film like “The Sting;” but in this one it is heavy-handed and boring.\n\nThe one interesting thing about the movie is its exploration of the concept of greed. Daniel, played by Michael J. Fox is, at the beginning of the film, the one uncorrupted relative. His father had walked out on Uncle Joe years ago, motivated by disgust at the other relatives’ behavior and some measure of liberal aversion to the very idea of wealth. Danny is a professional bowler who chokes in the big games and is ready to throw his career overboard anyway when his relatives try to bring him into their plans regarding Uncle Joe. They figure that Joe always liked Danny as a boy (though he now hates his other relatives for obvious reasons), and that if he left his money to Danny they could make deals with Danny on the side.\n\nDanny starts out, however, as a marvel of integrity, vowing not to let himself be sold out to greed. He manfully resists some opportunities to ingratiate himself for financial reward. Eventually, however, he begins to crack. For various reasons, it appears that Joe wants to dispose of his assets before he dies. In time, Danny comes to feel that it is in Uncle Joe’s best interest to leave the money to him rather than to the other family members, since they would simply dump Joe in a nursing home and forget about him. So Danny schemes like the rest of them, on one occasion transparently and shamefully, to get the money.\n\nThe question arises, to what extent are Danny’s actions motivated by real love for Uncle Joe, and to what extent by greed? What the film seems to tell us (mostly through the sayings of Danny’s all-wise girl friend) is that in the final analysis the motive is greed, though from seeing Danny’s actions I would not have been so sure. At any rate, at the end, Danny’s true (ungreedy) colors shine through.\n\nThe film does present, if it doesn’t always understand, the fact that people’s motives are usually mixed. Even the horrible relatives can plead some measure of altruism as they state their own cases. Danny undoubtedly has good and bad in his intentions. And Uncle Joe’s young British “nurse,” who spends most of her time nearly nude, is the butt (ahem) of much the family’s hatred, but in the end she has the integrity to leave (or at least so it seems) rather than sleep with Joe. After all of this, one wonders why the film seems so sure about the moral judgments it does make.\n\nThe other question: have the people been corrupted by the quest for money, or has the quest been corrupted by the people involved? The film leaves the question open, but the plot seems to lead us to the conclusion that both are true.\n\nChristians can raise issues here about original sin. The quest for moral purity in a sinful world, apart from divine grace, is so futile. The love of money, too, is a root of all kinds of evil. Who among us can claim to be free from covetousness? The film seems to be saying that all of us are greedy at heart. Whether intentionally or not, they have hit a biblical principle. Would that they had seen the biblical solution. The heart is deceitful and desperately wicked; but Jesus can cleanse it through his blood.\n\nTess Carlisle ……… Shirley MacLaine\n\nDoug Chesnic ……….

Edited by Sidney Levin. Music by Michael Convertino. Running time: 98 minutes. Classified: PG-13 (for some language).\n\nThis film is enormously satisfying as entertainment. Shirley MacLaine gives a wonderful performance here, I think the best in a fine career. I am not wild about her occult philosophizing, any more than I am enthusiastic about Jane Fonda’s politics; but both ladies are very substantial actresses. MacLaine here provides a funny, yet realistic portrait of a woman who is both difficult and likeable, nasty yet surprisingly loving, apparently irrational, yet supremely rational in the context of the plot. All these paradoxes require a performance of great nuance, and MacLaine provides it here.\n\nNicholas Cage also gives what may be his most impressive performance to date. In the past, he has played a lot of Wild and Crazy men. Here, for most of the film, his emotions are tightly under control as he portrays an uptight, by-the-book secret service agent. But it is evident that he could explode at any moment, as he does at a few crucial points, especially once late in the film.\n\nThe script is beautifully written, and the humor is constant, though not the slightest bit heavy-handed. Tiny bits of uneasiness in the characters for reasons known to the audience produced much laughter. The film is remarkably balanced in its comedy. It has a keen eye for the ridiculous elements in various government procedures, but in the end it respects, even vindicates them. It satirizes the uptightness of the secret service, but it also shows that in one agent there is a lot going on below the surface. Except for the villains of the piece, every character, no matter how silly at moments, comes out lovable in the end.\n\nCage plays Doug Chesnic, assigned by the secret service to guard Tess Carlisle, a former first lady, played by MacLaine. Tess gives Doug quite a hard time, requiring him to run trivial errands, rebelling at petty rules, sneaking away from her protectors, insulting Doug in various ways, often hitting him hard with true but unwelcome insights about himself. But when he seeks a new assignment, she calls the president, who then calls Doug and tells him to stay with her and shape up. The Clinton-like president’s annoyance at having to play peacemaker between these two is hilarious.\n\nWhen all the truth is out on the table, Tess’s eccentricities make perfect sense, her maternal love for Doug becomes patent, and he breaks through all sorts of standard procedures in order to save her life.\n\nThere is no God in this movie, no reference to religion, no obvious theological theme, except, perhaps, the effect of approaching death on behavior. Therefore, it was a real challenge for this highly theological reviewer to come up with anything interesting to say. But after some reflection, it is evident to me that there is a very profound theological dimension here, doubtless quite contrary to the intentions of the filmmakers.\n\nCornelius Van Til taught that all non-Christian thinkers fall into a kind of dialectic between rationalism (= “my mind is the final standard of truth”) and irrationalism (=”there is no ultimate truth”). These positions are formally contradictory; yet naturalist thinkers need to appeal to both of them, and they tend to hold them in tension. I have argued that the same pattern can be seen in non-Christian political theory: a dialectic between totalitarianism (= rationalism: society must be totally under control of the rational elite) and anarchy (=irrationalism: nobody has the wisdom to govern, so there should be no government at all). Without appeal to divine revelation, non-Christian political thought and practice vacillates constantly between these two extremes. Believers in scripture know that God requires both authority and freedom in society, and they know in general where those lines are to be drawn. Unbelievers do not, so they vacillate from a belief in total control to advocacy of total freedom.\n\nNow if ever a film demonstrated the totalitarian/anarchic dialectic, it is this one. The secret service people are totalitarians for the most part. The film ridicules their blind, unsmiling commitment to total control. Tess is the anarchist, the free spirit, wanting no restraint at all, manipulating events humorously and successfully (for the most part) to control her controllers. But she knows (at the end, more than ever) she must have some protection, and Doug comes to understand her need for freedom. The film notes insightfully that total control is impossible and that anarchy leads to disaster. But the balance between the two is just as mysterious at the end as it is in the beginning. I gather that the film wants to say that love is the answer, but it is too smart to state such a truism explicitly. What emerges is a kind of accommodation, but how can there be any stable accommodation between anarchy and totalitarianism?\n\nAt the end of the film, when an officious hospital orderly requires Tess to exit in a wheelchair and she demurs, Doug solves the problem with a twofold exhortation. To the orderly: “are the rules really that sacred?” and to Tess, “get in that wheelchair!” Very funny, but also an excellent illustration of the tension which is the main theme of the film. He is saying that rules aren’t really sacred, but we absolutely must accommodate ourselves to them.\n\nThe relation between Tess and Doug hits home, because it is essentially the relation between government and all of us. We love our country and appreciate its protections, but most of our concrete experiences with it are exasperating.\n\nWere Tess and Doug Christians, their relationship would have been very different. Love would have been an important part of it, no doubt, and that would have gone a long way toward reconciling their divergent interests, as in this film. But Christians also acknowledge rules, rules which are “sacred,” and among which love is the chief. A Christian Tess would not have run away without protection, and a Secret Service organized on Christian principles would have been more flexible, knowing that they are servants: servants of God and of God’s people (Matt. 20:26).\n\nThe same benefits, and more, might be expected from a really Christian government.\n\nAs for the theme of the approach of death: Tess has a brain tumor. Her odd behavior, wanting to play golf and have a picnic by the lake in the dead of winter, turns out in the end to result from a desire to have a few of her old enjoyments one more time before the end. One can hardly blame her, but it is a bit sad that these things are so important to her, and God’s heaven so unimportant, as she approaches the end. The meaning of her life is personal freedom, anarchic freedom, which the film itself regards as ultimately disappointing. This movie comedy presents her as finally triumphant and happy, but a more careful look at the story offers for our meditation a sense of tragedy.\n\nLe Ly ……………….

Debbie Reynolds\n\nWarner Bros. presents a film written and directed by Oliver Stone. Produced by Stone, Arnon Milchan, Robert Kline and A. Kitman Ho. Based on the books “When Heaven and Earth Changed Places” by Le Ly Hayslip with Jay Wurts and “Child of War, Woman of Peace” by Le Ly Hayslip with James Hayslip. Photographed by Robert Richardson. Edited by David Brenner and Sally Menke. Music by Kitaro. Running time: 138 minutes. Classified: R (for violence, language and sexuality).\n\nThis is the third of Oliver Stone’s movies about the Viet Nam war and its aftermath, the others being “Platoon” and “Born on the Fourth of July.” This one is a true story, though I assume certain liberties have been taken, of a Vietnamese woman. During her childhood, the French destroy her village. Then in her teen years, the Viet Cong come, demanding the loyalty of the villagers, torturing and raping any (including Le Ly, on the basis of a mistake) who appear to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Then came the Americans, who transform everything. Now Viet Nam is a bog of prostitution, cigarettes, drugs, corruption, suspicions, hatreds. Le Ly is forced to go to the city and work for a Vietnamese man who fathers her first son to the angry response of his wife. Le Ly is reduced to begging and selling goods to soldiers in the streets.\n\nAt this point, Steve Butler appears, a Marine officer who seems to genuinely love and understand her. He makes her his wife, and the family flees Viet Nam with the American pullout, settling in San Diego, at first with Butler’s family. Steve cannot make it financially, and his bitterness turns to viciousness and eventual suicide. In the course of events, Le Ly learns that his work in Viet Nam was to assassinate Vietnamese who collaborated with the Cong. What the film tells us is that he was in effect a serial killer, who after the war is wracked with guilt over it.\n\nLe Ly herself prospers in the US. She visits her family in Viet Nam, and encounters more bitterness: family members resent her wealth while they have so little. But there is reconciliation.\n\nOliver Stone is, of course, one of the most deeply ideological of directors, and in many ways he expresses here his loathing for American values and culture. To his credit, he does not glamorize the Viet Cong: they are brutal. But their brutality is the brutality of self-defense, we are told, the brutality made necessary by people who want the freedom to govern themselves. The Americans are the real wreckers of the peaceful culture. Butler seems to typify the whole American war effort: sheer murder under the guise of nation-building.\n\nAlso, in America, we see scenes of huge refrigerators and supermarket shelves filled with all sorts of food, to the amazement of Le Ly. And we see shovels of it being emptied into the sink disposal unit, after mass quantities have been conspicuously consumed by Steve’s fat female relatives.\n\nNevertheless, Stone does not hide the fact that Le Ly does eventually find happiness in America and through her prosperity is able to help the poor of her own country, doubtless far more than if she had stayed there. Nor does he hide the fact that the Communist rule puts Le Ly’s family into a state of constant poverty and suffering. Yet it is not clear how these inconvenient facts have modified Stone’s value judgments.\n\nIt is a very beautiful movie. Hiep Thi Le and Tommy Lee Jones give wonderful performances, as do the others in the cast. Stone’s critiques of American materialism are certainly not entirely wrong, though they come across to me as rather heavy-handed.\n\nThe film has a deeply Buddhist sensibility. Repentance and reconciliation inhibit bad karma. But is that not, in the end, a form of selfishness just as much as that which Stone has been quick to condemn in the American culture? Would that Christ had "
