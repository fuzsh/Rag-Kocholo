        "text": "Excellence in Broadcasting\n\nWhen Brian learns that Rush Limbaugh (guest-voicing as himself) is going to be at the Quahog Mall for a book-signing, he decides to go down there and give him a piece of his left-wing mind. But when Rush unexpectedly comes to Brianâs rescue, Brian has a political change of heart.\n\nWaste\n\nDetectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) report to Wheaton Memorial Hospital to investigate a rape victim. But the victim is Stephanie Rawley, a beautiful 28-year-old woman who has been in a coma for the past year, the result of a car accident. She is brought to the hospital with pneumonia and the doctors discover she is six weeks pregnant. The detectives start by investigating everyone at Mountcastle Rehabilitation Center, where she's been for the past year. The list of suspects includes her fiance David Anderson (Ian Kahn), who despite a restraining order from her parents Bob (Henry Woronicz) and Janice (JoBeth Williams) was found sleeping in her bed. They also extract DNA from basically all male employees who had any contact with the coma wing. They also question Dr. Mandell (Bruce Davison), her neurosurgeon, especially after he plots with another doctor to abort the fetus."
