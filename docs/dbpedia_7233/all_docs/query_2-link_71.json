Jeffrey Combs (Star Trek), Bruce Davison (X-Men), and DJ Qualls (The Man in the High Castle) have also joined the series. In addition, the title, writer, and director of the 12th and final segment was finally revealed.\n\nKid Cudi and Combs will star in the episode \"Bad Wolf Down,\" while Davison will star in \"Night of the Paw\" and Big Boi stars in \"The Man in the Suitcase.\" DJ Qualls stars in previously-unannounced segment \"The Finger,\" written by David J. Schow and directed by showrunner/executive producer Greg Nicotero (The Walking Dead).\n\nAt the end of last month, it was announced that David Arquette (Scream, Ready to Rumble), Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica, Lucifer), and Dana Gould (The Simpsons, Stan Against Evil) were set to join the anthology series. In early April, Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog, Swamp Thing), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), and Tobin Bell (Saw franchise) would headline \"Gray Matter\" for the horror anthology. Later that same month, horror icon Tom Savini revealed he was directing the Joe Hill-penned segment \"By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain.\"\n\n\"Part of what makes Creepshow fun is getting a chance to work with some terrific actors who also love the genre. It adds that level of excitement when we get to share our collective love for horror in this fashion. David and I have worked together before and Dana Gould might be my equal in terms of all things horror. Then bring Tricia into the mix and Creepshow just shines. Getting to watch her exude power, grace and intensity in a story I wrote can't be matched.\"\n\n– Greg Nicotero\n\nHere's a look at the 12 confirmed segments for the 6-episode season of Creepshow, along with the writer/director teams:\n\n\"All Hallows Eve\"\n\nWritten by: Bruce Jones / Directed by: John Harrison\n\nEven then they're a little too old, this group of friends still want to trick-or-treat but getting candy isn't all they are looking for.\n\n\"Bad Wolf Down\"\n\nWritten & Directed by: Rob Schrab\n\nA group of American soldiers, trapped behind enemy lines during World War II, finds an unconventional way to even the odds.\n\n\"By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain\"\n\nStory by: Joe Hill, adapted by Jason Ciaramella / Directed by: Tom Savini\n\nHer dad died looking for the monster living at the bottom of Lake Champlain, and now, will she?\n\n\"The Companion\"\n\nStory by: Joe R.
