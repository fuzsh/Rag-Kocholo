        "text": "Real world article\n\n(written from a production point of view)\n\nBruce Davison (born 28 June 1946; age 78) is an Academy Award-nominated American actor who played Jareth in the Star Trek: Voyager third season episode \"Remember\" and Menos in the Star Trek: Enterprise second season episode \"The Seventh\". His boots from the latter appearance were sold off on the It's A Wrap! sale and auction on eBay. [1]\n\nDavison first gained attention for playing the title role in Willard (1971), and has since become known for his roles in such films as X-Men, Short Cuts, and Longtime Companion (for which he received an Academy Award nomination). He is also known for his regular and recurring roles in such television series as Hunter, Harry and the Hendersons, The Practice, Cold Case, and the 2008 version of Knight Rider. In addition to his Oscar nomination, he is the recipient of such accolades as two Golden Globes, an Independent Spirit Award, and an Emmy Award nomination.\n\nEarly life and career[]\n\nborn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Davison began acting in the 1960s. He first gained recognition for his role in Last Summer (1969), which marked his film debut. He followed this with The Strawberry Statement (1970, with Star Trek: The Original Series guest actress Kim Darby), and the following year, he starred in Willard.\n\nDavison continued to act steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, appearing on both film and television and amassing some 60 credits in the process. Among his most notable films during this time period were Ulzana's Raid (1972), Mame (1974, starring Lucille Ball and featuring Barbara Bosson), Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976), Crimes of Passion (1984), Spies Like Us (1985, co-starring Bernie Casey), and The Misfit Brigade (1987, with Keith Szarabajka). Also during this time, he made appearances on such popular TV shows as Marcus Welby, M.D., Police Story, The Waltons, Lou Grant, V, and Murder, She Wrote (in an episode with Ed Lauter and John McLiam).\n\nIn 1980, Davison starred as John Merrick in the Broadway production of The Elephant Man, taking over the role from Philip Anglim. That same year, Davison gained much acclaim for his lead role as George Orr in The Lathe of Heaven, where he starred along with Kevin Conway (who also participated in Broadway's The Elephant Man). He can also be seen in the 1986 episode \"Boo\" of the Steven Spielberg series Amazing Stories alongside Robert Picardo.\n\nDuring the 1985-1986 TV season, Davison was a regular on NBC's Hunter, in which he played Captain Wyler. James Whitmore, Jr., was also a regular on this series at the time. Davison made several return appearances to the show in later seasons.\n\n1990s[]\n\nDavison received an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of a gay man whose lover is dying of AIDS in Longtime Companion (1990).

In 2002, Davison appeared in the pilot episode of Without a Trace, on which Enrique Murciano is a regular. That same year, Davison was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for directing the children's movie Off Season. He also starred in the movie.\n\nDavison and Ed Begley, Jr. were among those who starred in Kingdom Hospital, which aired in early 2004.

He even appeared on Ronald D. Moore's Battlestar Galactica, which aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nDavison had a supporting role in the 2008 TV movie The Librarian: The Curse of the Judas Chalice, directed by Jonathan Frakes.
