Jones said in a statement.\n\nAdded Brandon, who worked with Bryant on the Syfy series Haven: “This is a family story very dear to my heart, and I am beyond excited to see Lucas and Bruce in this dysfunctional father-son relationship. Lucas spoke the first words I ever had produced on Haven, and to be able to work with him again all these years later is a dream come true.”\n\nIn addition to starring in Haven, Bryant had a recurring role on ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Davison is an Oscar-nominated actor who played Senator Robert Kelly in the X-Men film franchise and recently recurred on 1923.
