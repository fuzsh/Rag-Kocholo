        "text": "Lucas Bryant, Bruce Davison and Michelle Hurd will lead the ensemble cast for the family-centric comedy feature 25 Miles to Normal.\n\nArtist View Entertainment has acquired writer-director Joshua Brandon’s movie, which begins shooting this month in Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri. Rachel Nichols, Ed Begley Jr. and Dee Wallace round out the ensemble cast.\n\n25 Miles to Normal focuses on a doctor (Bryant) and his estranged father (Davison), who reluctantly agree to reunite with the rest of the family.\n\nBrandon will produce through his Spitfire Cinema banner, alongside B.L. Fleischer for RcR Cinema and Peter Foldy’s Filmstreet Productions. Ricki Maslar is casting the feature.\n\n“Josh is an incredible young filmmaker, and I’m thrilled to be partnering with him on this hilarious and heartfelt project,” Artist View president Scott J. Jones said in a statement.\n\nAdded Brandon, who worked with Bryant on the Syfy series Haven: “This is a family story very dear to my heart, and I am beyond excited to see Lucas and Bruce in this dysfunctional father-son relationship. Lucas spoke the first words I ever had produced on Haven, and to be able to work with him again all these years later is a dream come true.”\n\nIn addition to starring in Haven, Bryant had a recurring role on ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Davison is an Oscar-nominated actor who played Senator Robert Kelly in the X-Men film franchise and recently recurred on 1923. Hurd is known for starring on Star Trek: Picard and Blindspot.\n\nBrandon is represented by Rothman Brecher Ehrich Livingston. Bryant is repped by Realm Talent and Oscars Abrams Zimel & Associates. Davison is repped by Talent Works and Chris Roe Management. Hurd is repped by IAG and TMT Management Group."
