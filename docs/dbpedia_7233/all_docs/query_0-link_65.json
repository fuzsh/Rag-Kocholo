        "text": "AXN has given its Indian primetime programming schedule a new look starting July 5. The new programme schedule will see a shift in the AXN Prime Zone - featuring the latest multi-award winning drama series like CSI, 24 and Alias - from 10 pm to 8 pm, and the introduction of a movie belt on Mondays and Tuesdays at 10 pm.\n\nAXN said, the programming content will remain largely unchanged; the new-look primetime schedule will provide a solid three-way fit between AXN, its viewers who will now be able to enjoy action-adventure programming at times that are most suited to their lifestyles, and advertisers who will be able to send their messages directly to their desired target audience.\n\nThe action-adventure channel, which is distributed by The One Alliance into almost 2 crore homes across India, recently soared to the very top of the ratings ladder amongst all English entertainment channels during the day and also during primetime. Not only was it a hit amongst all adults aged 15-44 in the AB socio-economic strata, it was also the leading channel with women in India aged 15-44 (AB class), topping all English GE (including music and infotainment) and movie channels. (source: TAM).\n\nAXN will be launching new titles every month. In July, the fifth and latest season of the Emmy-award winning The Amazing Race will take off, and will feature a pitstop in Kolkata. Also premiering in July are the special 7-episode Couples Fear Factor, where couples face off against their worst fears and other conniving couples in the bid to win the whopping $1million grand prize, and brand new seasons of Xena Warrior Princess starring Lucy Lawless, and Canada's top legal drama, The Associates. The ever-popular Hot N' Wild belt will premiere the 2-part World's Sexiest Commercials featuring some of the most titillating and tantalizing television ads ever to be made.\n\nIn August, AXN will bring viewers Next Action Star, a brand new reality series produced by top Hollywood producer Joel Silver (The Matrix, Gothika, Swordfish, Lethal Weapon) that searches for an action hero and heroine. Featuring a casting call which sees 14 finalists fighting to stay on in the show despite weekly eliminations, the series' winners will star in action movie - Bet Your Life - starring Billy Zane, and also produced by Joel Silver. More late night escapism is guaranteed with Bikini Destinations, which takes viewers on a weekly adventure to the hottest locations and greatest party destinations in the world, premiering in the Hot N' Wild belt. B!G Thrills TV - featuring some of the most unbelievable and edge-of-your-seat reality specials such as World's Most Shocking Moments Caught on Tape and When Animals Attack - will be AXN's Independence month offering every Sunday from 12 noon-5 pm. Pitch Black, the precursor to the soon-to-be-released The Chronicles of Riddick starring Vin Diesel, also premieres this August, giving viewers a look at the movie which shot the action star to fame."
