        "text": "An investigation of sensible and latent heat fluxes and their relation to synoptic weather events was performed using hourly meteorological measurements from National Data Buoy Center buoy 45003, located in northern Lake Huron, during April-November of 1984. Two temporal heat flux regimes were found to exist over Lake Huron. The first period extended from April through July and was characterized by periods of modest negative (downward) heat fluxes. The second regime was marked by periods of large positive (upward) heat fluxes and occurred from August through November. This later period accounted for 95%-100% of both the total positive sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, a comparison of the seasonal evolution of sensible and latent heat fluxes showed the transition from the negative to the positive flux regime occurred 10-20 days earlier for latent heat flux than for sensible heat flux. A notable, statistically significant increase of the surface heat flux variability from the negative to positive flux regimes with a general decrease in the near-surface atmospheric stability during the positive flux regime was found. During both flux regimes, the magnitude of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes remained coupled to transient synoptic-scale weather events. On average, the occurrences of minimum (maximum) heat fluxes preceded time periods of low (high) sea level pressure by 0-3 h during the negative flux regime. For the positive flux regime, maximum (minimum) surface heat fluxes followed the passage of low (high) pressure by approximately 24 h. In addition, maximum (minimum) sensible and latent heat fluxes preceded synoptic high (low) pressure by approximately 16 h. Typical synoptic surface weather patterns were identified for both significant positive and negative heat flux events, time periods when the atmosphere-lake heat exchange was maximized.\n\nThis study provides the first long-term climatological analysis of lake-effect precipitation events that de- veloped in relation to a small lake (having a surface area of #1500 km2). The frequency and environmental conditions favorable for Lake Champlain lake-effect precipitation were examined for the nine winters (October-March) from 1997/98 through 2005/06. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from Burlington, Vermont, were used to identify 67 lake-effect events. Events occurred as 1) well-defined, isolated lake-effect bands over and downwind of the lake, independent of larger-scale precipitating systems (LC events), 2) quasi-stationary lake-effect bands over the lake embedded within extensive regional pre- cipitation from a synoptic weather system (SYNOP events), or 3) a transition from SYNOP and LC lake- effect precipitation. The LC events were found to occur under either a northerly or a southerly wind regime. An examination of the characteristics of these lake-effect events provides several unique findings that are useful for comparison with known lake-effect environments for larger lakes. January was the most active month with an average of nearly four lake-effect events per winter, and approximately one of every four LC events occurred with southerly winds. Event initiation and dissipation occurred on a diurnal time scale with an average duration of 12.1 h. In general, Lake Champlain lake-effect events 1) typically yielded snowfall, with surface air temperatures rarely above 08C, 2) frequently had an overlake mesolow present with a sea level pressure departure of 3-5 hPa, 3) occurred in a very stable environment with a surface inversion frequently present outside the Lake Champlain Valley, and 4) averaged a surface lake-air temperature difference of 14.48C and a lake-850-hPa temperature difference of 18.28C. Lake Champlain lake-effect events occur within a limited range of wind and temperature conditions, thus providing events that are more sensitive to small changes in environmental conditions than are large-lake lake-effect events and offering a more responsive system for subsequent investigation of connections between mesoscale processes and cli- mate variability.\n\nThis study presents a climatological analysis of the frequency and characteristics of lake-effect precipitation events that were initiated or enhanced by lakes within the New York State (NYS) Finger Lakes region for the 11 winters (October-March) from 1995/96 through 2005/06. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from Binghamton, New York, were used to identify 125 lake-effect events. Events occurred as 1) a well-defined, isolated precipitation band over and downwind of a lake, 2) an enhancement of mesoscale lake-effect precipitation originating from Lake Ontario and extending southward over an individual Finger Lake, 3) a quasi-stationary mesoscale precipitation band positioned over a lake embedded within extensive regional precipitation from a synoptic weather system, or 4) a transition from one type to another. Results show that lake-effect precipitation routinely develops over lakes that are considerably smaller than lakes previously discussed as being associated with lake-effect precipitation, such as the Great Lakes. Lake-effect events occurred during each month (October-March) across the 11 winters studied and were identified in association with each of the six easternmost Finger Lakes examined in this study. The frequency of NYS Finger Lakes lake-effect events determined in the current investigation paired with subsequent analyses of the environmental conditions leading to these events will allow for 1) comparative analyses of necessary conditions for lake-effect development across a range of lake sizes (e.g., NYS Finger Lakes, Lake Champlain, Great Salt Lake, and Great Lakes) and 2) an informative examination of the connection between mesoscale processes and climate variability.\n\nLake-effect storms (LES) produce substantial snowfall in the vicinity of the downwind shores of the Great Lakes. These storms may take many forms; one type of LES event, lake to lake (L2L), occurs when LES clouds/snowbands develop over an upstream lake (e.g., Lake Huron), extend across an intervening landmass, and continue over a downstream lake (e.g., Lake Ontario). The current study examined LES snowfall in the vicinity of Lake Ontario and the atmospheric conditions during Lake Huron-to-Lake Ontario L2L days as compared with LES days on which an L2L connection was not present [i.e., only Lake Ontario (OLO)] for the cold seasons (October-March) from 2003/04 through 2013/14. Analyses of snowfall demonstrate that, on average, significantly greater LES snowfall totals occur downstream of Lake Ontario on L2L days than on OLO days. The difference in mean snowfall between L2L and OLO days approaches 200% in some areas near the Tug Hill Plateau and central New York State. Analyses of atmospheric conditions found more-favorable LES environments on L2L days relative to OLO days that included greater instability over the upwind lake, more near-surface moisture available, faster wind speeds, and larger surface heat fluxes over the upstream lake. Last, despite significant snowfalls on L2L days, their average contribution to the annual accumulated LES snowfall in the vicinity of Lake Ontario was found to be small (i.e., 25%-30%) because of the relatively infrequent occurrence of L2L days.\n\nResearch over the past several decades has indicated that snowfall has increased dramatically over portions of the past century across those areas of the Great Lakes region of North America that are subject to lake-effect snowfall. Within this study, time series of annual midwinter snowfall within lake-effect areas show evidence of a clear increase in both snowfall and snowfall frequency through a 40-yr period beginning in the early 1930s and ending in the early 1970s. The goal of the work presented here is to determine to what extent the apparent increases in lake-effect snowfall actually modified the winter hydroclimate of the areas. Simple hydroclimatic analysis of midwinter precipitation to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario for the period of significant snowfall increases suggests that the changes were a product of 1) a shift toward more precipitation events that were snowfall rather than rainfall, 2) an associated decrease in midwinter rainfall, 3) an increase in the intensity of individual snowfall events, and 4) an increase in the snowfall/snow water equivalence ratio. The balance was a small increase in total precipitation confined to areas in close proximity to the lakes across northeastern Ohio and western New York, while areas outside the regions generally experienced an overall decrease in midwinter precipitation. While the cause(s) of the snowfall trends remains elusive, the results of the work presented here suggest that no great long-term regional change occurred in the true wintertime seasonal hydroclimate of the lake-effect areas. Rather, much of the touted snowfall increase simply came at the expense of rainfall events to produce only small changes in total precipitation over the time period of significant snowfall increase."
