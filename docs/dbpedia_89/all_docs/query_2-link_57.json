Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches in the most persistent lake snows. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph creating blowing and drifting snow.\"\n\n\"Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility,\" describes the weather service. \"Heavy snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities.\""
