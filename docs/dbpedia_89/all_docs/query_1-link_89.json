A significant higher number of injuries occur; seventy percent of which are the result of vehicle accidents. Just in Montana since 2000, 27 people have lost their lives in extreme winter weather conditions with many more injuries. Avalanches, automobile accidents and cold weather exposure are the main causes of winter weather related deaths in Montana. Livestock injuries and deaths can also be quite common during the more hazardous events. The following are some of the causes of both direct and indirect deaths and injuries in Montana as well as causes of damage:\n\nExtreme wind chill or extreme cold (within a home and outside)\n\nVehicle accidents\n\nAvalanches\n\nLeaving a shelter such as a home or vehicle\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning from an incorrectly set up generator or vehicle exhaust obstructed by snow\n\nCollapse of structures from heavy snow loading\n\nFallen tree branches due to heavy snow\n\nLivestock covered in snow over southeast Montana during the April 4, 2009 Winter Storm\n\nYou should take steps to prepare for winter storms before they strike instead of waiting until the storm arrives. Use the guidelines below to help you get started.\n\nShort You Tube Video \"Winter Weather Survival Kit\"\n\nShort You Tube Video \"Traveling in Montana in the Winter\"\n\nAt Home and Work\n\nThe primary concerns during a winter storm are loss of heat, power and telephone service and a shortage of supplies if storm conditions continue for more than a day. Have these items available:\n\nFlashlight and extra batteries\n\nBattery powered NOAA Weather Radio\n\nExtra food and water\n\nExtra medicine and baby items\n\nFirst-aid supplies\n\nEmergency heat source\n\nHeating fuel\n\nFire extinguisher\n\nSmoke alarm - Test once a month\n\nMake sure pets and livestock have plenty of food, water and shelter\n\nIn Vehicles\n\nPlan your travel and check the latest weather reports to avoid the storm.

Plan. Stay Informed.\n\nIf you are caught in a winter storm, follow these safety tips to help you stay safe:\n\nOutside\n\nFind Shelter: Try to stay dry. Cover all exposed body parts.\n\nIf No Shelter: Build a lean-to, windbreak or snow cave for protection from the wind. Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.\n\nStay Hydrated: Melt snow for drinking water. Avoid eating snow. Eating snow will lower your body temperature\n\nIn a Vehicle\n\nStay In Vehicle: You will become quickly disoriented in wind-driven snow and cold. Run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat. Open the window a little for fresh air to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Make sure the exhaust pipe is not blocked.\n\nBe Visible To Rescuers: Turn on the dome light at night when running the engine. Tie a colored cloth, preferably red, to your antenna or door. After snow stops falling, raise the hood to indicate you need help.\n\nExercise: From time to time, move arms, legs, fingers and toes vigorously to keep blood circulating and to keep warm.\n\nInside\n\nStay Inside: When using alternate heat from a fireplace, wood stove, space heater, etc., use fire safeguards and properly ventilate.\n\nNo Heat: Close off unneeded rooms. Cover windows at night. Eat and drink plenty. Food provides the body with energy for producing its own heat. Keep the body replenished with fluids to prevent dehydration. Wear layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing. Remove layers to avoid overheating, perspiration and subsequent chill.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nSome of the pages listed below are in a PDF format.
