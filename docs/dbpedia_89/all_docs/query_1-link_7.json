        "text": "Hazard Simplification is Coming Soon!\n\nWhat does this mean? On October 2, 2017, the National Weather Service will implement changes to our winter weather messaging. The primary goal of these changes is to better serve you, the customer. Please see the short video below for additional details.\n\nOverview of Winter Changes:\n\nThe NWS is striving to support a “Weather-Ready Nation” by ensuring you are aware of and prepared for the variety of weather- and water-based hazards we experience across the country every day. One factor in supporting this awareness and preparedness is to make sure our messaging is as clear and focused as possible.\n\nBased on initial feedback from core partners and the public, and with support from social and behavioral scientists, the NWS is implementing changes to more effectively communicate our hazard messages. To begin this process, modifications will be made to winter weather products. Here are the winter adjustments taking place this Fall:\n\nProduct Consolidation:\n\nConsolidate Lake Effect Snow Advisory and Freezing Rain Advisory into Winter Weather Advisory\n\nConsolidate Lake Effect Snow Watch and Blizzard Watch into Winter Storm Watch\n\nConsolidate Lake Effect Snow Warning into Winter Storm Warning (selected sites only)\n\nProduct Reformatting:\n\nReformat all winter products into a “What, Where, When, Additional Details, and Precautionary/Preparedness Actions” format.\n\nWhile the five consolidated products noted above will no longer be issued, the service will still be provided. Instead of issuing products specifically catered to lake effect snow, freezing rain, and blizzards (only in the case of watches for blizzards), the information will be provided in the \"what\" section of existing products.\n\nReformatting will bring a more clear and organized look and feel to the products. Critical decision-making details will be more readily available and easier to find with the new format mentioned above.\n\nSome graphics are included below to highlight changes and provide a few examples.\n\nGraphics Highlighting Winter Weather Product Adjustments:\n\nFor More Information:\n\nDownload this One Pager to Spread the Word\n\nDetailed Information on the Hazard Simplification Project\n\nLet's build a Weather-Ready Nation"
