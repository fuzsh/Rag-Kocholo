        "text": "DANGEROUS LAKE-EFFECT SNOWSTORM\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists are keeping an eye on a dangerous extended lake-effect snow event for areas around the Great Lakes through the weekend. AccuWeather accurately predicted that an area of low pressure brought the season's first accumulating snowfall to the Northeast Tuesday. That same storm will continue to bring heavy snowfall as it moves to the east. There is an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 16 inches.\n\nPersistent bands of lake-effect snow will produce several feet of snow in areas such as Buffalo, New York, where they could see up to 6 inches of snow by Sunday. Other areas that could see a couple of feet of snow include the Tug Hill plateau. There is an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 72 inches.\n\nThe heavy snow could cause buildings to be compromised due to the added weight. Power lines may also come tumbling down and cause some businesses and communities to lose power.\n\n>> FOLLOW US on LinkedIn for essential weather updates that could impact your business.\n\nBusinesses in these areas should keep an eye on the storm and should:\n\nBe prepared for business interruptions due to extended power outages.\n\nExpect ground logistics disruption from drifting snow, downed trees, and power outages due to road closures.\n\nPrioritize cold weather concerns for outdoor workers.\n\nProtect your business and team members by making the best weather-impacted decisions with AccuWeather's Snow Warning Service, backed by forecasts and warnings with Superior Accuracy™.
