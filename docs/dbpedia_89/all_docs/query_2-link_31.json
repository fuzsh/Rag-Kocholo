        "text": "It's been a slow start to the season for snow lovers, but Monday will bring heavy lake effect snow to parts of West Michigan.\n\nA Winter Storm Warning has been issued for Van Buren, Allegan, Berrien and Cass counties from 4 a.m. Monday morning until 4 a.m. Tuesday morning. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Muskegon, Oceana, and Ottawa counties for the same period.\n\nWind gusts will pick up from the northwest early Monday morning. This will bring snow showers areawide for the morning commute.\n\nLake effect snow bands, some intense, will develop on Monday afternoon and will be confined to areas west of U.S. 131.\n\nSlick travel is possible for the Monday morning commute, but conditions are more likely to deteriorate Monday afternoon and evening.\n\nAreas west of U.S. 131 will see the worst impacts from snow and reduced visibility. Up to 5\" to 8\" of snow is expected across portions of Van Buren, Berrien, and Cass counties. In Allegan County, accumulations up to about 5\" are possible.\n\nLocally higher amounts are expected, especially in western Allegan, Van Buren, Berrien, and Cass counties. Heavy snow bands could dump close to a foot of snow for a few localized spots.\n\nRegardless of how much snow falls, gusty winds will cause blowing and drifting snow, significantly reducing visibility at times. Wind gusts of 35-50 mph are possible at times, the highest likely right along the lakeshore.\n\nThe combination of gusty winds and heavy snow could create whiteout conditions. Scattered power outages are also possible as a result of strong winds.\n\nLake effect will slowly taper off by early Tuesday morning, and by that point conditions should improve considerably. Warmer temperatures return through the end of the week, which will melt snow quickly in the coming days.\n\nForecast:\n\nStay tuned to the News Channel 3 team of meteorologists on air and online for further updates."
