        "text": "Convective Weather Convective weather hazards include large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. WFOs should include Storm Prediction Center Categorical Convective Outlook information for Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 Risks (Slight, Moderate and High) of organized severe convective weather. WFOs may include information on strong (less than severe) convection. Winter Weather Winter weather hazards include wind chill, freezing fog, significant snow, freezing rain, sleet, or a mixture of these weather phenomena. Non-Precipitation Non-precipitation weather hazards include strong winds, excessive heat, extreme cold, blowing dust/sand, freezing temperatures during the growing season, and dense fog. Fire-Weather Fire weather hazards include extremely dry conditions, strong gusty winds, and dry thunderstorms. While mentioning active Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings for Days 1 and 2, SPC Fire Weather Outlooks (Day 1 and Day 2) may also be incorporated. Flooding Any and all flood hazards (coastal marine, inland, river) are incorporated including those impacts associated with a tropical cyclone. WFOs may include information on small stream flood situations and life threatening flood prone areas. Marine Marine hazards include high winds, high seas, high surf, rip-currents, coastal flooding, and waterspouts. High risk of rip-currents and accompanying information can be included in the Day 1 portion of the HWO. Marine hazards that do not directly affect the coastline (i.e., Small Craft Advisories), may be omitted from the HWO. Tropical Day 1 Tropical Cyclone Watches and Warnings issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) will be headlined, though users will be strongly urged to consult Hurricane Local Statements to obtain detailed information concerning potential hazards such as strong winds, storm surge, and excessive rainfall. Days 2 through 7 will be consistent with official guidance and products issued by the NHC/WPC. WFOs will not reference tropical cyclone activity beyond the time period addressed by official tropical cyclone products (currently 5 days). Developing Hazardous Convective Weather WFOs may issue SPSs to heighten public awareness about ongoing or imminent hazardous convective weather expected to continue/dissipate, or expand/decrease in geographical coverage within the next hour or two. Sub-Severe Thunderstorms WFOs should issue an SPS for strong thunderstorms that approach, or are expected to approach, severe convective criteria. General criteria for a sub-severe thunderstorm is considered to be one or a combination of the following events:\n\nSustained winds or gusts of 40 to 57 mph (lower values may be used at forecaster’s discretion)\n\nHail less than 1 inch in diameter\n\nFrequent to continuous lightning\n\nFunnel clouds not expected to become a tornado threat\n\nOther Short-Term Hazards WFOs may issue SPSs for high-impact events to supplement information contained in other hazardous weather products, providing high-resolution details when possible. Examples include but are not limited to:\n\n\"black ice\"\n\nshort-duration heavy snow bands\n\nlake-effect snow bands that briefly reduce visibility\n\nheavy rainfall that is not expected to cause flooding\n\nheat indices or wind chill near \"advisory\" level for an hour or two\n\nlocal areas of blowing dust where wind is below advisory criteria\n\nMajor Events Forecast to Occur Beyond 6 Hours WFOs may issue SPSs to heighten awareness of major events forecast to occur beyond 6 hours. Priority should be given to ongoing or imminent events such as those listed above. Outlook An outlook is used to indicate that a hazardous marine weather event may develop. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event. Marine outlooks are issued with a Hazardous Weather Outlook (HWO) and/or a Marine Weather Statement (MWS). Watch A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous marine weather event has increased, but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. Warning A warning is used when a hazardous marine weather event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability of occurrence. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or property. Advisory An advisory is used for less serious conditions that cause significant inconvenience and, if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property. Active Watches WFOs will issue updated WCNs to continue, cancel or extend in time or area portions of one or more active convective watches in their geographic area of responsibility New Watches WFOs will also issue updated WCNs to include new watches issued within their geographic area of responsibility while existing watches remain in effect Watch Extensions CONUS WFOs will collaborate with SPC and affected WFOs on counties, parishes, independent cities or marine zones added to the initial watch area, or extensions to the expiration time of the initial convective watch area Watch Replacements CONUS WFOs will collaborate with SPC and adjacent WFOs when counties, parishes, independent cities or marine zones are transferred from an existing convective watch to a new convective watch (e.g. watch replacement) Watch Editing Consistency WFOs will ensure modifications to the convective watch area are consistent with modifications made by adjacent WFOs WCN Issuance Times WCNs will be issued by H+55 so that changes will be reflected in the WOU issued by SPC after the top of the hour Watch Cancellation /Expiration The final WCN for a particular convective watch will cancel or allow expiration of all remaining counties, parishes, independent cities and/or marine zones in the watch for their geographic area of responsibility …HEADLINE(s)… …NEW INFORMATION… New and vital information specific to the segment. If present, New Information will always be the first section header. …PRECAUTIONARY /\n\n…PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS… The protective actions outlined in the overview block precautionary/preparedness actions section may be expanded upon here to provide further detail for a specific area of concern if necessary. This section will contain mainly significant protective actions issued by local and state officials. …PROBABILITY TROPICAL STORM /\n\nHURRICANE CONDITIONS… Information on probability of hurricane/typhoon/tropical storm conditions. …WINDS…or\n\n…WINDS AND SEAS… Information about the potential impacts of forecast winds such as the anticipated time of onset, approximate duration and cessation (in general terms, i.e., \"afternoon\") of tropical storm/hurricane/typhoon force winds, peak winds and gusts. Wind speed values will be expressed in appropriate ranges relative to the magnitude of the storm (40 to 50 mph instead of 45 mph). …STORM SURGE\n\nAND STORM TIDE… Information about the potential impacts of forecast storm surge and storm tide. This includes the anticipated time of onset, approximate duration and cessation (in general terms, i.e., \"afternoon\") of the storm surge and storm tide, as well as peak heights. Heights should be expressed in appropriate ranges relative to the magnitude of the surge and tide (8 to 12 feet above ground level). WFOs will reference storm surge and storm tide relative to height above ground level (inundation). WFOs may use other vertical datum references such as Mean Sea Level (MSL) and/or Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). …INLAND FLOODING… Highlight the threat of flash flooding and rapid inundation relative to the zone or zone group as a result of heavy rain. …TORNADOES… or\n\n…TORNADOES AND WATERSPOUTS… Highlight the threat of tornadoes or waterspouts relative to the zone or zone group. …OTHER… The section is optional. WFOs may address other hazards specific to their area for the event (e.g., rip currents, mudslides). Wind data If the observed peak gusts are greater than 33 knots, highest sustained surface wind speed (knots) and duration (1-, 2- 8-, or 10-minute average which ever applies), peak gust (knots), and date/times of occurrence in UTC are reported. All descriptions associated with the station making the observation will also be provided as either Official or Unofficial Observations. Wind speeds may be corrected based on instrument type and speed range if known. Any all all data should be included only when deemed reliable based on the particular facts and circumstances. Pressure data Lowest sea level pressure (millibars) and date/time of occurrence (UTC) are reported as well as any and all descriptive information concerning the sources. Storm total rainfall Amount (inches) and duration (dates) are reported from any and all locations where significant rainfall observations are available (typically 3-inches or more). Anything less is reported as a needed- or requested-basis. Inland flooding Date/times (UTC) and counties/parishes/independent cities of occurrence are reported, along with a brief worded summary, as appropriate. Maximum storm surge\n\nand storm tide Reports are made so in referencing storm tide to appropriate datums (North American Vertical Datum of 1988) understood by local authorities. Some areas may still be using the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) or Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). Storm tide is reported in feet above the datum, and storm surge/wind waves in feet above the normal, predicted (astronomical) tide level. Location and date/time (UTC) of occurrence is provided where possible. Storm surges greater than 1 foot are included, as well as storm-tides 1 foot or greater above the normal astronomical tide. Tides of 1 foot or greater above normal, with tides of less than 1 foot above normal are reported as needed or as requested. Extent of beach erosion as appropriate is included. The National Ocean Service’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (NOS CO-OPS) will provide a final report of storm surge and storm tide information from NOS tide gauges to WFOs within 4 days following the issuance of the final HLS. Tornadoes Times (UTC) and locations included, taken mainly from Local Storm Reports (LSRs) issued for the event, along with a brief description of damage, as appropriate. Storm impacts Including deaths, injuries, dollar damages, number of people evacuated, etc., per county/parish/independent city as reported by emergency management, trusted media sources, etc. Please note: For data in sections (A, land observations), (B, marine observations), (C, storm total rainfall), and (F, tornadoes), latitude and longitude should be included. Blizzard A blizzard means that the following conditions are expected to prevail for a period of 3 hours or longer: a). Sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles an hour or greater and b). considerable falling and/or blowing snow, i.e., frequently reducing visibility below 1/4 mile. Although there is no set temperature requirement for blizzard conditions, the life-threatening nature of the low temperatures in combination with the other hazardous conditions of wind, snow, and poor visibility increases dramatically when the temperature falls below 20°F. Snow Frozen precipitation in the form of (white or translucent) ice crystals that steadily falls for several hours or more. Qualifiers, such as occasional or intermittent, are used when a steady, prolonged (for several hours or more) fall is not expected. Blowing Snow Blowing snow is snow lifted from the surface of the earth by the wind to a height of 6 feet or more above the surface (higher than drifting snow), and blown about in such quantities that horizontal visibility is reduced to less than 7 statute miles. Blowing snow is usually accompanied by drifting snow. Drifting Snow Drifting snow is snow lifted from the surface of the earth by the wind to a height of less than 6 feet above the surface. Drifting snow may occur during or after a snowfall. Drifting snow is usually associated with blowing snow. Heavy Snow Heavy Snow generally means: Snowfall accumulating to 4 inches or more in depth in 12 hours or less; or Snowfall accumulating to 6 inches or more in depth in 24 hours or less. Snow Flurries Snow flurries are short duration (generally a few minutes) light snow showers with no measurable accumulation (trace category). Snow Showers Snow showers are brief periods of snowfall in which intensity can be varied and may change rapidly. Some accumulation is possible. A snow shower in which light snow falls for a few minutes is typically called a snow flurry. Snow Squalls Snow squalls are intense, but limited duration, periods of moderate to heavy snowfall, accompanied by strong, gusty surface winds and possibly lightning (generally moderate to heavy snow showers). Snow accumulation may be significant. Regional variation to this definition is expected. For example, close to the Great Lakes, snow squalls are usually locally intense, narrow bands of heavy snow that can extend over long distances, persist for many hours, and produce 6 inches or more of snow in 12 hours or less. Ice Storm An ice storm is used to describe occasions when damaging accumulations of ice are expected during freezing rain situations. Significant accumulations of ice pull down trees and utility lines resulting in loss of power and communication. These accumulations of ice make walking and driving extremely dangerous. Significant ice accumulations are usually accumulations of 0.25 inch (one quarter of an inch) or greater. Sleet Sleet is a type of precipitation consisting of transparent or translucent pellets of ice, 0.25 inch or less in diameter. These pellets of ice usually bounce when hitting hard ground and make a sound upon impact. Heavy Sleet Heavy sleet is a relatively rare event defined as an accumulation of ice pellets covering the ground to a depth of 1/2 inch or more. Freezing Rain or Drizzle Rain or drizzle that falls in liquid form but freezes upon impact with the ground or exposed objects. Small accumulations of ice can cause driving and walking difficulties while heavy accumulations produce extremely dangerous and damaging situations primarily by pulling down trees and utility lines. Wind Chill The Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) is the air temperature at which the heat transfer rate and skin temperature would be the same in the absence of wind. The WCT represents the temperature the body feels when it is exposed to wind and cold. Prolonged exposure can lead to frostbite and hypothermia."
