        "text": "WEATHER ALERT DAY: Winter storm to bring moderate to heavy snow to northwest Montana. Gusty winds and significant travel impacts can be expected.\n\nHigh pressure will trap the colder air in many valley locations today. Even though valley inversions will keep the warm-up slow, we will make it above zero with daytime highs warming into the single digits and teens. Overnight lows will fall into the single digits.\n\nOur next weather maker will arrive tonight. Widespread snow will develop across the area late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. The heaviest snow will fall along and north of I-90.\n\nWinter Storm Warnings have been issued. The Flathead and Mission Valleys are included in the warning for 8 to 14 inches of snow! West-central and southwest Montana valleys will see 1 to 4 inches, but there could be isolated higher amounts around Missoula and Butte if the storm tracks a little further south. Wind gusts 25-40 mph could result in blowing and drifting snow, increasing the likelihood of major travel impacts becoming possible. The forecast is likely to evolve as we approach this event, so continue to check for the latest updates.\n\nAnother arctic front will arrive Wednesday. This front will not be as cold as the last, but it could enhance snowfall and allow for areas of blowing and drifting snow. Overnight lows in northwest Montana could drop back below zero Thursday morning, but again it will be nowhere near as cold as it has been. Even if heavier snowfall accumulations do not occur in places like the Bitterroot Valley and southwest Montana, wet, slushy roads could quickly freeze as temperatures fall Thursday morning.\n\nHigh pressure will return for the end of the week. Weak disturbances will make their way through the ridge. Occasional snow showers will be possible this weekend. Temperatures will rise back into the 30s and 40s.\n\nFLOOD WARNING is in effect until 5 PM Tuesday for the Beaverhead River near Dillon in southwest Montana. Urban and small stream flooding caused by an ice jam in low-lying and poor drainage areas is expected.\n\nFLOOD ADVISORY is in effect until Noon Wednesday for the Beaverhead and Ruby Rivers in southwest Montana. Minor flooding caused by ice jams in low-lying and poor drainage areas.\n\nFLOOD ADVISORY is in effect until 11 AM Wednesday for the Gallatin River near Logan in southwest Montana. Minor flooding caused by ice jams in low-lying and poor drainage areas.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 5 AM Wednesday through 11 AM Thursday for the Kootenai/Cabinet Region. Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 8 and 16 inches, with 1 to 2 feet along Montana Highway 56 Bull Lake Road.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 5 AM Wednesday through 11 AM Thursday for the West Glacier Region. Heavy snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 2 feet.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 5 AM Wednesday through 11 AM Thursday for the Flathead/Mission Valleys. Heavy snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 8 and 14 inches.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 5 AM Wednesday through 11 AM Thursday for the Lower Clark Fork Region. Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 7 to 14 inches, with 1 to 2 feet along the Idaho Montana border, including Lookout Pass. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 5 AM Wednesday through 11 AM Thursday for the Butte/Blackfoot Region. Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations 6 to 10 inches for Highway 12 and 200 along the divide, with 3 to 7 inches elsewhere. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNING is in effect from 10 PM Tuesday through 10 AM Thursday for the Northern Clearwater Mountains. Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 2 feet. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\nWINTER STORM WATCH is in effect Wednesday Afternoon through Thursday Morning for the Missoula/Bitterroot Valleys and Bitterroot/Sapphire Mountains. Total snow accumulations between 3 and 7 inches will be possible in the lower elevations, excluding the Bitterroot Valley (1-3 inches). Total snow accumulations of 1 to 2 feet will be possible in the mountains. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.\n\nWINTER STORM WATCH is in effect Tuesday night through Thursday Morning for the Upper Blackfoot and MacDonald Pass, Gates of the Mountains, Big Belt, Bridger and Castle Mountains-Gallatin and Madison County Mountains and Centennial Mountains, including the following locations: Canyon Creek, Big Sky, Marysville, Targhee Pass, Raynolds Pass, Maudlow, MacDonald Pass, Lincoln, Deep Creek Pass, Craig, Battle Ridge Pass, Trident, West Yellowstone, Flesher Pass, Bozeman Pass, and Wolf Creek.
