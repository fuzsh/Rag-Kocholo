        "text": "Take a look at the winter weather across the U.S.\n\nA dangerous Arctic blast is hitting large swaths of the country, bringing heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions along with dangerous wind chills.\n\nSee some photos of wintry conditions across the U.S.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFlooding, high tides hit the Northeast\n\nand\n\nIn other parts of the U.S., if the problem wasn’t snow and wind, it was water: Record high tides hit the Northeast, flooding some homes in Maine and New Hampshire.\n\nThe coastal Northeast was pounded by 1 to 2 inches of rain in the morning, and a storm surge amplified what was already the month’s highest tide, National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Cempa said.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, a gauge recorded a 14.57-foot difference between high and average low tide, topping a prior record of 14.17 feet set in 1978.\n\nPhotos from Joshua Smick of Hampton, New Hampshire, showed rushing water on roads in the coastal town.\n\n“I’m 42 years old, and I don’t recall ever seeing anything like this in New England before,\" Smick told NBC News.\n\nFrigid but happy in Kansas City after a Chiefs playoff win\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — With frosty suites, a cracked helmet, a frozen mustache, it's hardly surprising that the Chiefs' 26-7 win over the Dolphins ranks as the fourth-coldest game in NFL history.\n\nAnd while minus 8 degrees (and minus 25 wind chill) was plenty cold for fans at Arrowhead Stadium tonight, the all-time coldest NFL game record was never at risk. That belongs to the 1967 NFL championship game: It was minus 13 when the Packers beat the Cowboys at Lambeau Field in the Ice Bowl. Wind made that day feel like minus 48 degrees\n\nSo until Kansas City knows who and where the Chiefs play next, Wednesday is the focus. That's the next time temps will climb above freezing.\n\nMillions under winter weather warnings, advisories\n\nAs of Saturday night, 45 million people in the United States were under a winter weather advisory, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA wind chill warning affected more than 30 million and a wind chill advisory was in place for another 63 million. A winter storm warning was in effect for 18 million.\n\nGreat Lakes region pummeled by snow\n\nCities along the Great Lakes and in the region continue to be affected by major snowstorms tonight and into tomorrow, with warnings from the National Weather Service that an additional 1-2 feet of snow will be dumped on some parts of the area through Monday.\n\nThe Weather Service said whiteout conditions are expected in the lake-effect snow bands as the arrival of cold air generates more heavy snow. Parts of western and southern New York State will see 12-24 more inches through Monday and parts of Michigan are expecting more than a foot.\n\nChicago has already seen 6.7 inches of snow, with other parts of Illinois recording more than 13 inches. The area is expecting another 1-2 inches tonight.\n\nMilwaukee has 10.1 inches of snow on the ground and nearby Waukesha, Wisconsin, is in 14-16 inches territory.\n\nBuffalo is expecting 8-12 inches of snow tonight and into Sunday before the Monday dump. Detroit only has a few inches right now, but will likely see more as the storm continues.\n\nBy 6 a.m., the Twin Cities were reporting around 2 inches of snowfall, but other areas of the state further south and areas near the border in Wisconsin are already seeing more than a foot.\n\nPossibility of snow squalls in New York City tomorrow\n\nNew York City could see snow squalls in addition to strong winds and cold temperatures tomorrow, the New York City Emergency Management Department said in a weather alert issued for Sunday.\n\nAn Arctic cold front will grace the area Sunday afternoon, bringing the potential for snow squalls, leading to low visibility, gusty winds and short periods of moderate to heavy snow.\n\nSqualls often last less than 30 minutes but can be intense, like a \"mini-blizzard,\" the weather alert said. City-dwellers should be prepared for a half inch of snow on the ground and 40-45 mph winds from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nRoads can get slippery during snow squalls, but because of mild temperatures in New York City, they shouldn't get icy.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said the city will be working to salt streets but asked New Yorkers to stay off the roads if there is a snow squall warning in their neighborhood.\n\nKansas City leads at half, but Miami winning the weather game\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Chiefs may be heading into the locker room with the lead — they're up 16-7 — but there's no doubt that Miami is sitting way prettier, the city of Miami that is.\n\nIt's 69 degrees in Miami, downright steamy when you compare it to what it feels like in Kansas City: 23 below.\n\nThat's weather cold enough to freeze your mustache, just ask Chiefs Coach Andy Reid.\n\nUnderground heating, sideline heaters and wet suits: How players are keeping warm at Arrowhead Stadium\n\nDespite patches of ice covering GEHA field at Arrowhead Stadium, the conditions in Kansas City appear worse than they actually are, with players telling NBC Sports' Kaylee Hartung that they were having no trouble during warm ups.\n\nThat's thanks to Arrowhead's underground heating system, comprised of boilers pumping heat into thousands of feet of pipes, which acts \"like a radiator to warm the grass and roots\" to keep the field from totally freezing over, Hartung said.\n\nEach player has a different strategy — the Dolphins’ Raheem Mostert is wearing a sleeveless wetsuit, Hartung reported. And each team's sideline has heated benches and heaters blowing air to keep players — like Tyreek Hill, who said he is wearing short sleeves because he didn't want to look \"soft\" — and coaches warm.\n\nWatch the full report on NBC Sports.\n\nNebraska governor declares state of emergency\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced a state of emergency, citing “very dangerous conditions.” Up to 2 feet of snow fell in some areas over the past week, and wind chills were well below zero.\n\n“This event is not going away tonight. It’s not going away tomorrow,” Pillen said at a news conference “It’s going to take a number of days.”\n\nAbout 1,700 miles of Nebraska highways were closed. State police assisted over 400 stranded motorists, said Col. John A. Bolduc, head of the Nebraska State Patrol.\n\nWind chill in the single digits in Portland, Oregon\n\nThe National Weather Service’s Portland, Oregon, office says wind chill temperatures in the metro area are in the single digits this afternoon.\n\n“Frost bite can occur within 30 minutes if you are not properly dressed,” it said on social media platform X.\n\nIt warned of multiple trees down in the area, and the Oregon Department of Transportation and the road services agency for Multnomah County, which includes Portland, both posted photos of massive trees or branches resting across roadways.\n\nWinds as powerful as 45 mph were expected in northwest Oregon and along the state’s central coast, the weather service said. Gusts of 50 mph were possible in the Puget Sound, it said. Snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches were expected in the Cascade foothills, federal forecasters said.\n\nWarm before the storm in North Texas\n\nDALLAS — It was nice and sunny earlier, just long enough to squeeze in a walk or bring the plants in before the weather dips below freezing until Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport hit 63 degrees today, but temperatures have been dropping rapidly, plunging to 31 degrees as of 6 p.m.\n\nWintry precipitation is expected to begin tomorrow afternoon. Dallas-Fort Worth is expected to see mostly sleet and freezing rain through Monday morning, but up to half an inch of snow is likely northeast of the metro area.\n\nKansas City fans — and Taylor, too — bundle up to root on Chiefs\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The city ready to host one of the coldest games in NFL history is bundled up.\n\nMany fans at Arrowhead Stadium for tonight's Kansas City Chiefs-Miami Dolphins playoff game spent part of the day doing a dress rehearsal.\n\nThey collected and tried on hats, blankets, base layers, battery-operated clothing and boots this afternoon so they would be as prepared as possible for the subzero temperature in the stands.\n\nThe Chiefs made some weather accommodations — allowing blankets, cardboard (to stand on) and portable chargers to power heated apparel; setting up warming stations; offering hot coffee and chocolate to designated drivers — but there is only so much you can do when the feels-like temperature is 24 below zero.\n\nAnd though she'll likely be watching the game in a heated suite, the Chiefs' most recognizable fan came dressed in winter gear, too.\n\nTaylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, arrived in a coat featuring her beau's name and number. (But if she's in the elements for any amount of time, she's gonna want to zip it up!)\n\nTravis Kelce is among a number of players who opted to wear only short sleeves for tonight's below-zero game.\n\nOthers included Dolphins star receiver Tyreek Hill and Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, who, despite adding a long sleeve under his jersey, rolled up one arm to expose his skin.\n\nMiss Swift is watching the game from above in her normal suite at Arrowhead Stadium, but the windows are a bit icier than usual.\n\nCameras caught her peering through steamy glass with icicles hanging just before kickoff — but she looked plenty warm inside.\n\nSeattle wind chill 'Cold enough to freeze your latte before you can Instagram it!'\n\nAs a new storm moved into the Pacific Northwest and California from the Pacific overnight, potent winds emerged and temperatures plunged to levels rarely experienced in this corner of the nation.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Seattle forecast a wind chill temperature — the feels-like temperature when strong wind is included as a factor — of minus 34 in the Cascade mountains south of Mount Rainier.\n\n\"Cold enough to freeze your latte before you can Instagram it!\" its account on social media platform X stated.\n\nThe White Pass resort 12 miles southeast of Mount Rainier National Park warned skiers and snowboarders to bring \"multiple layers of face protectors\" to fend off the cold blasts of wind, adding on Facebook, \"This storm has been relentless.\"\n\nAnything can be an ice rink\n\nThe weather in Vancouver, Canada, was cold enough to freeze water at a construction site, setting up a makeshift ice rink for one person.\n\nA video shared on X by user Pucks on Net showed a man skating and practicing his hockey moves on the ice.\n\nAn arctic outflow warning is in effect for Vancouver through Sunday, with wind chill values near minus 20 for the metro area.\n\nPortland officials investigating suspected hypothermia death\n\nAt least one person in Portland, Oregon, is believed to have died due to dangerously cold temperatures, officials said.\n\nThe person, who has not been identified, died today, the Multnomah County Medical Examiner’s Program said in a news release. The medical examiner's office is investigating it as a suspected hypothermia death.\n\n\"Investigators say confirmation will not be complete for several weeks to months,\" the office said. \"No other details are being released at this time.\"\n\nMore than 456K customers across U.S. without power\n\nand\n\nMore than 456,000 customers across the U.S. are without power. As of 4 p.m., Michigan had the highest number of outages with 155,054, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nOregon was at 126,435 and Wisconsin at 71,184 customers who are living without power.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, nearly 30,000 customers were in the dark. New York, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and New Hampshire also had significant outages.\n\nTravel ban issued in Erie County, New York\n\nTravel in Western New York is expected to be “impossible and dangerous” once the storm hits, Gov. Kathy Hochul said at a news briefing today, urging residents to stay home.\n\nIn Erie County, a full travel ban for passenger vehicles is in effect beginning at 9 p.m. ET. The ban will be reassessed Sunday at 6 a.m., the governor’s office said.\n\n“Forecasts predict the most dangerous winter storm conditions since the Christmas Blizzard of 2022,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Working closely with County and City leaders, we are instituting a 9:00 p.m. travel ban that takes effect tonight to keep motorists safe.”\n\nCommercial traffic is also banned on all state, county and local roads in Erie County and on the New York State Thruway. That ban will remain in effect indefinitely, according to the governor.\n\nThousands of flights canceled across U.S.\n\nand\n\nMore than 1,100 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. were canceled Saturday, according to FlightAware.\n\nDelays were even higher, totaling 3,564.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration urged travelers to check with their airline before heading to the airport.\n\n\"Storms throughout the U.S. continue to cause cancellations and delays tonight & tomorrow,\" the FAA said in a post on X.\n\nIowa State Patrol received calls for 86 crashes\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol received calls for 86 crashes between 12:30 a.m. Friday and 10 a.m. Saturday, the agency said in a post on X.\n\nDuring that same time period, there were 71 calls for property damage and 15 for personal injury.\n\nMore than 70 people evacuated after frozen sprinkler at Arizona assisted living facility causes water leak\n\nMore than 70 people at an assisted living facility in Arizona had to be evacuated after a water leak caused by a frozen sprinkler led to the collapse of drywall, officials said.\n\nThe leak happened on the third floor of Ativo Senior Living of Prescott Valley, Central Arizona Fire and Medical Authority said in a post on X. There was significant damage to all three floors of the facility.\n\nForty-two residents were displaced, according to the fire department. No one was injured, the fire department said.\n\nInsight Living, which is the owner and management company of the building, told Fox 10 Phoenix that the frozen sprinkler was caused by freezing temperatures.\n\nBuffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers game postponed\n\nThe Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers playoff game has been postponed until Monday at 4:30 p.m., New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\n“I’ve been in communication with @NFL commissioner Roger Goodell regarding the dangerous conditions in Buffalo this weekend,\" she said in a post on X.\n\n\"In consultation with our emergency response teams, @BuffaloBills leadership, and the NFL, the Bills game will be postponed to 4:30 pm Monday,” the governor said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n'Brutally cold' temperatures hit Billings, Montana, setting new record\n\nBillings, Montana, was hit with \"brutally cold\" temperatures with a drop to negative 25 degrees around midnight, breaking a daily record low set on Jan. 13, 1997, when it was negative 22 degrees, the National Weather Service in Billings said in a post on X.\n\nIt was also the first time since 1997 that the city set a daily record low in January, the weather agency said.\n\nBitter cold is also expected in the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area.
