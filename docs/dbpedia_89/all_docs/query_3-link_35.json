        "text": "Follow here for the latest weather updates.\n\nA relentless weather pattern that caused headaches for large portions of the United States this week will deliver blizzard conditions across the Midwest and Great Lakes on Friday and into the holiday weekend, while severe weather will again settle over the South and East, forecasters said.\n\n“Life-threatening winter weather is expected,” with heavy snow and white-out conditions Friday, followed by wind chills as low as minus 45 through early next week, wrote forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, where voters on Monday are going to participate in the presidential caucuses. Wind chills that extreme can lead to frostbite on exposed skin within minutes.\n\nNearly 30 million people, mostly in the Midwest and around the Great Lakes, were under a winter storm warning early Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Over three and a half million people in the region were under a blizzard warning. By early next week this Arctic outbreak will deliver below-average high temperatures and freezing low temperatures to every state across the contiguous United States.\n\nIn portions of Alabama and Mississippi, there was an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms, and the possibility of tornadoes, with the threat moving east by the evening."
