        "text": "As expected, after reaching the lower to middle 60s for much of our area during the day Wednesday, a strong cold front has already moved through our area and caused a very quick drop in temperatures.\n\nExpect numbers to fall below the freezing mark at or after 8:00 PM.\n\nWith some leftover moisture on the roads due to rain, a wintry mix and some leftover regular snow, untreated roads, sidewalks, driveways and parking lots may experience a flash freeze with a thin coating of black ice if not treated with salt.\n\nOn top of that, wind gusts will continue to be a problem through a good chunk of Wednesday night which gives a chance for additional localized power outages.\n\n.\n\nBe very aware of these fast-paced changes this evening!\n\nIt's part of the top three things I am watching:\n\nSince we have already talked about the whipping wind and the temperatures falling, let's move on to the second thing on the list which is lake effect snow.\n\nIt appears that well-connected lake effect snow bands off of Lake Superior, Lake Huron and/or Georgian Bay will hook up with the developing Lake Ontario snow bands and cause the threat for localized areas of heavy lake effect snow to develop especially after midnight and during the pre-dawn hours of Thursday and continue through the day Thursday before weakening.\n\nAs with any lake effect forecast situation, a small shift in the wind direction will cause a dramatic shift in the position and intensity of how much and where the lake effect snow will occur. Having said that, here is our forecast for total snowfall for Wednesday night through Thursday below. Keep in mind, that we might have to make changes to this forecast since the lake effect snow has not formed yet. This situation still has uncertainty so realize that the darker blue and white colors below may need to be shifted north or south slightly.\n\nTotal snow forecast through 7:00 PM Thursday for much of Upstate New York:\n\nTotal snow forecast through 7:00 PM Thursday for the immediate CNY area:\n\nThere are weather alerts in effect for both lake effect snow & wind:"
