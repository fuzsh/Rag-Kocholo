        "text": "A winter storm is expected to bring several inches of snow to most of Michigan this weekend.\n\nWinter storm watch alerts were issued Thursday for most of the state, outside of the Metro Detroit region. But Metro Detroit will also see measurable snow.\n\nUpdate --> Winter storm warning issued for 24 counties in Lower Michigan\n\nHere’s the snow forecast for each Michigan region:\n\nSnow in Metro Detroit\n\nHere’s the latest from 4Warn Weather’s Ashlee Baracy: The onset of the snowfall across Metro Detroit will be mid-afternoon on Friday. Precipitation will initially fall as snow, with rates as high as 1 inch per hour. Then, on Friday evening, the snow will change over to rain for portions of Metro Detroit and areas south as a brief pocket of warm air pushes in after sunset.\n\nThis rainy window appears to be limited, but it’s worth noting that there is still some uncertainty about how the rain/snow line will progress northward. Where that line falls and progresses will have a significant impact on snow totals in Metro Detroit.\n\nWe’ll be fine-tuning the forecast over the next 24-36 hours, as we get a better grasp of that brief pocket of warm air Friday night. With this said, it still is probable that Metro Detroit could receive 3-6 inches of snowfall as more snow builds in before sunrise on Saturday. (Areas closer to Monroe should see lesser amounts of snow because they’ll get a bit more rain.)\n\nNorthwest communities are more likely to see 6-8 inches of snow by Saturday, and the northern parts of the Thumb could be upward of 8 inches.\n\n---> More: Weekend winter storm breakdown: Snow totals, timing for Metro Detroit\n\nSnow in West Michigan\n\nHere’s the latest from NWS in Grand Rapids: Heavy snow and strong winds are expected for portions of Michigan starting Friday morning and continuing into Saturday.\n\nMain concerns are wind gusts of 30 to 45 mph paired with heavy snow causing blowing and drifting snow, whiteout conditions, power outages, and hazardous travel conditions.\n\nMost accumulations are during Friday afternoon and night with impacts to the evening commute likely.\n\nSnow in Northern Lower Michigan\n\nHere’s the latest from NWS in Gaylord: A high impact winter storm is expected Friday afternoon into Saturday across Michigan.\n\nGiven the high potential for accumulations of 12″ for some and wind gusts of 35-50+ mph, blizzard conditions will be possible across portions of northern Michigan Friday evening and Friday night.\n\nPotential significant blowing and drifting snow and near-zero visibilities at times may lead to dangerous travel conditions.\n\nSnow in Michigan Upper Peninsula\n\nHere’s the latest from NWS in Marquette: Another winter storm is tracking into the Great Lakes region on Friday and will bring accumulating heavy wet snow to Upper Michigan through Saturday.\n\nStrong northeast winds develop Friday night and gradually become northwesterly by Saturday night resulting in poor visibility and blowing snow."
