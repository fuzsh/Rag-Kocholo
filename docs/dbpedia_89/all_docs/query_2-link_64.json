        "text": "We will get to near freezing on Tuesday, hitting the low 30s alongside gusty SW winds. This will make it feel like the teens all day long, with thickening clouds.\n\nWINTER WEATHER ADVISORY has been issued for all of N.E.W. from midnight until 6pm Wednesday for 2-5\" of snow. The kicker, the strong winds gusting up to 40-50mph by Wednesday late morning and through the afternoon. This will blow and drift snow and create a slick and slippery commute for the both the morning and evening hours. Snow will wind down by 5pm, besides some lingering lake effect snow showers by the lake shore.\n\nTemps will drop back down into the teens & single digits for highs on Thursday/Friday.\n\nAnother mild day arrives Saturday, alongside light snow potential.\n\nThen the coldest arctic blast of the season spill in to kick off next week, frigid style."
