        "text": "More than 100 million people in the United States were under a wind chill warning or advisory on Sunday as an “Arctic blast” enveloped huge parts of the country, while the South was expected to get snow and the Northeast braced for blinding wind-driven squalls, forecasters said.\n\nThe National Weather Service reported wind chill readings on Sunday of 19 degrees below zero in Arkansas, 9 degrees below zero in Dallas and 60 degrees below zero in Montana. Rapid City, S.D., reached its previous record low of 23 degrees below zero, forecasters said. Low temperatures are expected to grip most of the country through the middle of the week.\n\n“These wind chills will pose a risk of frostbite on exposed skin and hypothermia,” the Weather Service said. “Have a cold survival kit if you must travel.”\n\nThe extreme weather has proved to be dangerous in other ways. Strong winds knocked a tree onto a home in northwest Lake Oswego, Ore., on Saturday morning, killing a man inside, said Sgt. Tom Harper, of the Lake Oswego Police Department. More than 100 trees fell in the area over the weekend, he said.\n\nAlso in Oregon, Portland Fire and Rescue struggled to reach the scene of an R.V. fire in the southeast part of the city because of road closures from fallen power lines and trees. The emergency vehicles had to move slowly because of slick roads, said Lt. Terry Foster, the fire inspector.\n\nAn open-flame stove was being used to heat the R.V., and a tree fell on it, starting the fire. One woman in her early 30s was killed, while three other people in the recreational vehicle managed to escape."
