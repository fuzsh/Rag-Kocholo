        "text": "TUG HILL, N.Y. — The Tug Hill region could get as much as nine inches of snow beginning early tomorrow, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA winter weather advisory will be in effect from 4 a.m. Monday to 4 a.m. Tuesday. Snow accumulations for Tug Hill and the rest of the Eastern Lake Ontario Region are expected to be between five and nine inches.\n\nIn addition, wind gusts could reach 35 mph, potentially producing blowing and drifting snow that could make travel “very difficult.”\n\nThe lake effect snow will fall in narrow bands, so travelers are advised to prepare for rapidly changing road conditions and visibility."
