        "text": "SEVERE THUNDERSTORM- a thunderstorm which produces at least one of the following:\n\nhail 1 inch or greater\n\nwinds greater than 58 mph\n\ndamage to trees, telephone/utility poles or any structure\n\ntornado\n\nSIGNIFICANT SEVERE- if any of the following hazards occurs:\n\nhail 2 inch or greater\n\nwinds of at least 75 mph\n\ntornado of at least EF-2 rating\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH - issued when severe thunderstorms are possible in and near the watch area. The watch is issued for a large area and is usually in effect for several hours.\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING - issued when severe weather is imminent or occurring and is usually in effect for about an hour.\n\nSEVERE WEATHER STATEMENT - provides follow up information on severe weather conditions (severe thunderstorm or tornadoes) which have occurred or are currently occurring.\n\nSPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT - provides additional information about expected or ongoing significant weather changes not covered in other statements. This would include non-severe convective, winter weather, and non-precipitation events.\n\nTORNADO - a funnel-shaped cloud extending downward from the base of a severe thunderstorm which is rapidly rotating and comes into contact with the ground or any objects on the ground.\n\nTORNADO WATCH - issued when severe thunderstorms may produce tornadoes and near the watch area. The watch is issued for a large area and is usually in effect for several hours.\n\nTORNADO WARNING - issued when a tornado is imminent or occurring and is usually in effect for 45 minutes or less.\n\nFUNNEL CLOUD - a funnel-shaped cloud extending downward from the base of a thunderstorm which is rapidly rotating and does NOT come into contact with the ground or objects on the ground.\n\nWATERSPOUT - A violently rotating column of air, usually a pendant to a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud, over a body of water with its circulation reaching the water. In the summer and spring, these phenomena are usually \"tornadoes over water\" that have been generated by thunderstorms. In the fall months, these most often begin as cold air funnels, being generated by a cold air mass passing over much warmer waters. Such waterspouts are generally much less intense than tornadoes and usually dissipate upon approaching shore.\n\nCOLD AIR FUNNEL - A funnel cloud or (rarely) a small, relatively weak tornado that can develop from a small shower or thunderstorm when the air aloft is unusually cold (hence the name). They are much less violent than other types of tornadoes.\n\nFLOOD WATCH (BE PREPARED) - issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.\n\nFLASH FLOOD WARNING (TAKE ACTION) - issued when flooding is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood prone area move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain.\n\nFLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY - issued for exceedingly rare situations when a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage from a flash floos is happening or will happen soon.\n\nFLOOD WARNING (TAKE ACTION) - issued when flooding is imminent or already happening.\n\nFLOOD ADVISORY (BE AWARE) - issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\n\nCATEGORIES:\n\nMINOR FLOODING - minimal or no property damage, but possibly some public threat or inconvenience.\n\nMODERATE FLOODING - some inundation of structures and roads near streams/rivers; some evacuations of people and/or transfer of property to higher ground elevations necessary.\n\nMAJOR FLOODING - extensive inundation of structures and roads; significant evacuations of people and/or transfer of property to higher elevations.\n\nHEAT INDEX (APPARENT TEMPERATURE) - what the temperature \"feels like\" to the human body based on both the air temperature and humidity. Calculator.\n\nHUMIDITY - the measured amount of moisture in the air.\n\nEXCESSIVE HEAT WATCH - issued when extremely dangerous heat conditions are possible.\n\nEXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING- issued when extremely dangerous heat conditions are expected. Specifically for heat indices of 105+ degrees for two or more hours for New York State, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\nHEAT ADVISORY - issued when dangerous heat conditions are expected.\n\nHeat Indices of 95 degrees or more for two or more consecutive hours for New York State excluding the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City & Long Island and for Vermont.\n\nHeat Indices of 95-99 degrees for 2 consecutive days or 100 to 104 degrees for any duration in New York State for the Lower Hudson Valley, New York City & Long Island and for Connecticut & Massachusetts.\n\nNWS HeatRisk - is an experimental color-numeric-based index that provides a forecast risk of heat-related impacts to occur over a 24-hour period. It takes into consideration:\n\nHow unusual the heat is for the time of the year\n\nThe duration of the heat including both daytime and nighttime temperatures\n\nIf those temperatures pose an elevated risk of heat-related impacts based on data from the CDC\n\nWET BULB GLOBAL TEMPERATURE (WBGT) - is a parameter that estimates the effect of temperature, relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation on humans. Itâ€™s a particularly effective indicator of heat stress for active populations such as outdoor workers and athletes.\n\nAIR QUALITY ALERT - is issued by individual states and your local NWS Forecast Office relays the information via the Air Quality Alert (AQA) product.\n\nAIR QUALITY FORECAST - NWS\n\nTROPICAL DEPRESSION - an organized area of low pressure where sustained surface winds are 38 mph or less.\n\nTROPICAL STORM - a strong area of low pressure associated with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph. It is at this point a tropical cyclone gets a name.\n\nHURRICANE - maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or greater. There are 5 categories of hurricanes.\n\nHURRICANE WATCH - Issued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are possible within the specified coastal area. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the hurricane watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds..\n\nHURRICANE WARNING - Issued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are forecast within the specified area. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the hurricane warning is issued 36 hours in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nTROPICAL STORM WATCH - Issued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are possible within the specified coastal area within 48 hours.\n\nTROPICAL STORM WARNING - Issued by the National Hurricane Center when sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph are forecast within the specified coastal area within 36 hours.\n\nHURRICANE LOCAL STATEMENT - issued by your local NWS Forecast Office. It contains a succinct overview of the tropical event and a generalized summary of potential impacts and preparedness information.\n\nTROPICAL CYCLONE LOCAL WATCH/WARNING PRODUCT - issued by your local NWS Forecast Office. It provides detailed meteorological, threat and impact information.\n\nSTORM SURGE is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides.\n\nSTORM SURGE WATCH: - Issued when there is potential of life-threatening inundation (3 ft or greater AGL) from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours, in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nSTORM SURGE WARNING: - Issued when there is danger of life-threatening inundation (3 ft or greater AGL) from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 36 hours, in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¹NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER - maintains a continuous watch on tropical cyclones over the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Pacific from 15 May through November 30 and prepares and distributes hurricane watches and warnings for the general public, and also prepares and distributes marine and military advisories for other users. During the \"off-season\" provides training for U.S. emergency managers and representatives from many other countries that are affected by tropical cyclones and conducts applied research to evaluate and improve hurricane forecasting techniques, and is involved in public awareness programs.\n\nWestern Atlantic Hurricane Tracking Chart - NHC"
