        "text": "Snowflakes are agglomerates of many snow crystals. Most snowflakes are less than one-half inch across. Under certain conditions, usually requiring near-freezing temperatures, light winds, and unstable, convective atmospheric conditions, much larger and irregular flakes close to two inches across in the longest dimension can form. No routine measure of snowflake dimensions are taken, so the exact answer is not known.\n\nSee also the NOAA Question of the Month: How do snow flakes form into so many uniquely different shapes?\n\nGenerally, snow and ice present us with a uniformly white face. This is because most all of the visible light striking the snow or ice surface is reflected back without any particular preference for a single color within the visible spectrum. The situation is different for that portion of the light which is not reflected but penetrates or is transmitted into the snow. As this light travels into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light. If the light is to travel over any distance it must survive many such scattering events, that is it must keep scattering and not be absorbed. The observer sees the light coming back from the near surface layers (mm to cm) after it has been scattered or bounced off other snow grains only a few times and it still appears white. However, the absorption is preferential. More red light is absorbed compared to blue.\n\nNot much more, but enough that over a considerable distance, say a meter or more, photons emerging from the snow layer tend to be made up of more blue light than red light. Typical examples are poking a hole in the snow and looking down into the hole to see blue light or the blue color associated with the depths of crevasses in glaciers. In each case the blue light is the product of a relatively long travel path through the snow or ice. So the spectral selection is related to absorption, and not reflection as is sometimes thought. In simplest of terms, think of the ice or snow layer as a filter. If it is only a centimeter thick, all the light makes it through, but if it is a meter thick, mostly blue light makes it through.\n\nSource: NSIDC researcher, Richard Armstrong.

Am. 73(12):1646-1652\n\nSnow forms when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing (0 Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit) and there is a minimum amount of moisture in the air. If the ground temperature is at or below freezing, of course the snow will reach the ground.\n\nHowever, the snow can still reach the ground when the ground temperature is above freezing if the conditions are just right. In this case, snowflakes will begin to melt as they reach this warmer temperature layer; the melting creates evaporative cooling which cools the air immediately around the snow flake.This cooling retards melting. As a general rule, though, snow will not form if the groud temperature is 5 degrees Celsius (41 deg Fahrenheit).\n\nFor a more detailed answer, see When is it too warm to snow?, Texas Climate Bulletin).\n\nSnow is not necessarily colder in deeper spots. The temperature at the surface of the snow is controlled by the air temperature. The colder the air above the colder will be the snow layers near the surface, say within the top 12 to 18 inches. The snow near the ground in deeper snowpacks however is warmer because it is close to the warm ground. The ground is warm because the heat stored in the ground over the summer is slow to leave the ground because snow is a good \"insulator,\" just like the insulation in the ceiling of your house, and thus slows the flow of heat from the warm ground to the cold air above.\n\nSnow is made of ice crystals. Ice crystals have six points. One snowflake can consist of multiple crystals. There are gaps between the points of a crystal that are empty, except for air. When snow falls to the ground, air is trapped inside of that layer of snow. You have probably noticed that when snow is stepped on, it gets compressed. The air gets pushed out of the snow. The sound you hear could be the sound of the ice crystals as they break. Try it with ice cubes. They make a crunching sound when they are broken.\n\nAlso, on a sunny day, the surface layer of snow can melt, due to thermal heating. When the sun goes down and temperatures drop, that top layer refreezes into a thin crust of ice. If you step on it, you are breaking that top crust, resulting in a \"crunching\" sound.\n\nThe crunching sound is less related to temperature and more related to the structure of the snow. The older the snow, the more compacted and icy it becomes.\n\nSource: NSIDC researcher, Richard Armstrong, April 2002"
