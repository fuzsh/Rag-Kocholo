        "text": "If a snow squall warning is issued for your area, avoid or delay motor travel until the squall passes through your location. There truly is no safe place on the highway during a snow squall. However if you are already in transit and cannot exit the road in time, reduce your speed, turn on your headlights and hazard lights and allow plenty of distance between you and the car in front of you. Itâ€™s also best not to slam on your brakes. With slick/icy roads, this could contribute to the loss of vehicle control and also increase the risk of a chain reaction crash.\n\nFollow weather.gov to get the latest forecasts and warnings before you start your car to travel. For tips on how to stay safe before, during and after a winter weather, bookmark our Winter Weather Safety page. Prior to traveling, take steps to prepare your vehicle and have an emergency kit for your car. Bottom line, follow weather.gov to get the latest warnings before you travel this winter."
