If a watch is issued for your area, you should pay special attention to future forecasts and statements, and begin to make safety preparations.\n\nWinter Storm Warning: Severe winter weather conditions are occurring or are imminent. Most warnings are issued for heavy snow and wind, but may also be issued for ice and sleet storms. If a warning is issued for your area you should take immediate action to ensure the appropriate safety precautions have been taken.\n\nBlizzard Warning: Visibilities are reduced to less than 1/4 mile for several hours due to falling and/or blowing snow, making travel virtually impossible. The wind will be at least 35 mph.\n\nSnow Squall Warning: An exceptionally rare warning that most typically applies to lake effect snow squalls, where visibility drops to near-zero. It is issued for one hour or less for a small area, and is relayed as a Wireless Emergency Alert.\n\nAdvisories: These are issued for conditions which warrant increased public awareness and moderately hamper travel, but where the weather is not severe enough to merit a warning.\n\nWind Chill: The cooling effect upon exposed skin, produced by the combination of temperature and wind. A copy of the Wind Chill Chart is available on our web site."
