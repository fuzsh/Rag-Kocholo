        "text": "***Updated by Meteorologist Peter Hall Tuesday morning***\n\nWith somewhat colder air pouring across Lake Ontario and Lake Erie on a west-southwesterly wind today through most of tonight, there will be localized heavier snow squalls that will develop east of both Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Each of these lakes will cause accumulating snow over portions of our area.\n\nIn advance of this, lake effect snow warnings have been issued for areas east of Lake Ontario in our local area.\n\nALake Effect Snow WARNINGis in effect for the following counties:\n\n--Jefferson and Lewis counties from 10 AM Tuesday until 7 AM Wednesday.\n\nA Winter Weather ADVISORY for lake effect snow is in effect for the following counties:\n\n--Northern Oneida & northern Herkimer counties from 10 AM Tuesday until 7 AM Wednesday.\n\nA lake effect snow warning means that periods of heavy lake effect snow will cause large travel problems across portions of these counties.\n\nThe winter weather advisory for lake effect snow means that accumulating snow is likely but are not expected to be extremely heavy. Still, you can find a large difference in snowfall amounts.\n\nHere is what to expect most often in these counties:\n\n--Near whiteout conditions may occur at times inside the heaviest snow squalls.\n\n--Travel will be heavily to potentially severely impacted in these areas.\n\n--Remember, that lake effect snow forecasts are extremely tricky with a high amount of variability of total snowfall even within the counties alerted.\n\n--Understand that exact snowfall forecast should be used as a guide of what is likely to happen across the area.\n\nWhile other central New York counties do not \"officially\" have a weather alert, there will be some localized areas of steadier snow showers and brief snow squalls at times. Parts of CNY will have some steadier snow showers off of Lake Erie cutting through the Route 20 and possibly Route 173 and Route 5 corridors late this afternoon through this evening before shifting through the central and southern tier overnight.\n\nIn addition, the Lake Ontario snow bands which will be east of Lake Ontario will shift south across the immediate Syracuse and CNY area around or just before the morning rush Wednesday. Even though there will not be a lot of accumulating snow with this feature as it passes through, a quick coating to an inch or two may happen in very short period of time when lots of people are on the road going to work. Therefore, you should be weather aware of this potential.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS:\n\n--As mentioned above, lake effect snow forecasts are extremely tricky with a high amount of variability of total snowfall even within the counties alerted.\n\n--Sometimes, the amount of snow can vary wildly within just a few miles of other areas of central New York.\n\n--Understand that exact snowfall forecast should be used as a guide of what is likely to happen across the area.\n\n--A small change in the wind directions can and will drastically alter the amount of snow any one spots will receive.\n\n--We may need to make adjustments to the snowfall forecasts above.\n\n--Stay tuned online and on-air for updates!\n\nForecast road impacts ahead:\n\nNew snow 4 AM Tuesday - 7 PM Wednesday across upstate NY:\n\nNew snow 4 AM Tuesday -7 PM Wednesday across the immediate CNY area:\n\nFull explanation of what to expect next here:\n\nFor Tuesday, there will be some occasional snow showers and flurries throughout the course of the day. During the morning, some steadier snow showers passing through will provide for the opportunity for a quick dusting to coating to an inch or so through mid-morning. Thereafter, the prevailing wind flow will be west-southwesterly. This will cause both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario to develop stronger lake effect snow especially later in the afternoon. While most of CNY will see mainly flurries, we need to be weather aware of a risk for some brief heavier snow squalls or steadier snow showers over portions of CNY around the Route 20 corridor (or possible Route 173/Route 5 corridors) from Lake Erie. This may be good enough for isolated 1-3\" amounts late this afternoon. Where this doesn't occur in CNY, expect only a fresh trace to 1 inch. Elsewhere, directly east of Lake Ontario, the strongest lake effect snow of the day will occur. Expect many spots to receive 1-3\" of snow with local amounts of 6\" possible by sunset."
