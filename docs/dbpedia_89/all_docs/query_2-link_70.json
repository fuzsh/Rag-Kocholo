        "text": "A winter season that's sputtered to a start is about to ramp up big time.\n\nA powerful storm will track right into Michigan Friday leading to several inches of a heavy, wet snow and powerful wind gusts.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a Winter Storm Warning for West Michigan counties, all but Branch, starting 10 a.m. Friday to 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe second phase includes lake effect snow from early Saturday morning right into Sunday.\n\nAnd, the third major weather story will be the arrival of arctic air Sunday and beyond. Wind chills are parked well below zero Sunday morning through the middle of next week.\n\nSnow starts Friday morning, Jan. 12, 2024, toward and just after daybreak. A quick accumulation of a concrete-like snow could look like 4-inches to 8-inches or more by sunset.\n\nThe ongoing forecast quirk is how much of a mix or plain rain infuses itself into the system late Friday and Friday evening.\n\nRight now, we believe locations near and south of I-94 and especially east or southeast of Kalamazoo are most likely to see rain.\n\nThis could be for a period of 3 to 4 hours, and obviously, would impact snowfall totals.\n\nEasterly and east-southeasterly winds may gust upwards of 45-50 mph Friday afternoon and evening.\n\nFor tree branches blanketed in heavy snow, the concern is strong winds could bring branches down and potentially into power lines.\n\nThere will be another bout of strong winds from late Friday night into Saturday morning.\n\nThese gusts, this time from the west, could also reach 50 mph.\n\nAt this point, the character of our snow transitions to light and fluffy with a tinier flake size, which means blowing, drifting, and very poor visibility.\n\nBlizzard-like conditions are definitely possible.\n\nFor this reason and overall road conditions, we're not recommending traveling Friday afternoon through Saturday.\n\nLake effect snow continues Sunday, Monday, and even Tuesday. Light to moderate, additional accumulations are likely. It's quite reasonable that one to two feet of snow are on the ground by early next week of many Michiganders."
