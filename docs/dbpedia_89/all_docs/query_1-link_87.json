There is the potential for strong winds, heavy rains, and possible flooding across regions of the Commonwealth,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\nDebby is expected to hit Virginia on Thursday or Friday, bringing with it potentially several inches of rain.\n\nWatch: Hampton Roads preparing for possible impacts from Debby\n\n'We always prepare in advance:' Hampton Roads preparing for possible impacts from Debby\n\nMost of the region should see 3” to 6” of rainfall with locally higher totals possible. Strong to severe storms are possible, mainly for Thursday and Friday. Winds will kick up Thursday and Friday but should remain below tropical storm strength, according to News 3 Meteorologist Myles Henderson.\n\nNorth Carolina officials are also preparing for Debby's impact — Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday night.\n\nWatch: NC Gov. Roy Cooper issues state of emergency ahead of Tropical Storm Debby\n\nNC Gov.

Plan in advance a route to a safe place, how you will stay in contact with family and friends, and what you will do in different situations.
