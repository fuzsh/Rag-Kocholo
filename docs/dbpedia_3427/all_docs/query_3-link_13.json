CLERMONT [en-BEAUVAISIS]\n\nLépinois suggests that, in the early 11th century, Clermont was a fief of the county of Beauvais . He points out that there was never a pagus of this name and also that the county does not correspond geographically with any of the local ecclesiastical jurisdictional entities. It is therefore difficult to define precisely the boundaries of the medieval county of Clermont. It appears that Clermont became a county unofficially when Renaud Seigneur de Clermont assumed the title count on his marriage to Adelais Ctss de Vermandois in 1103 and that the elevation in status was generally recognised. On the death in 1218 of Thibaut VI Comte de Blois, son of Catherine Ctss de Clermont, the county of Clermont [en-Beauvaisis] was sold to the French crown .\n\nA. ORIGINS\n\n1.RENAUD [I] (-before 1047). He is named in the charter of his son dated 25 Dec 1047 (see below). m ---. The name of Renauds wife is not known. Renaud & his wife had three children:\n\na)HUGUES [I] (-after 3 Mar 1057). \"Hugo\" donated property in \"villis Villana, Villereisium Curtis et Brochis\" to Saint-Médard de Soissons, for the souls of \"patris sui Rainoldi et fratris sui Alberti\", by charter dated 25 Dec 1047 . \" Hugonis pincernæ regum, Balduini fratris eiusdem Valterii pincernæ regis \" witnessed the charter dated 3 Mar 1057 under which Henri I King of France donated property to Notre-Dame de Soissons .\n\ni)GAUTHIER (-after 1069) . \" Hugonis pincernæ regum, Balduini fratris eiusdem Valterii pincernæ regis \" witnessed the charter dated 3 Mar 1057 under which Henri I King of France donated property to Notre-Dame de Soissons . \"Miles Gualterus filius Hugonis pincerne regis\" settled a dispute with Saint-Riquier concerning \"la terre de Feuquières-en-Vimeu\" by charter dated 29 Aug 1062 .\n\n- see below.\n\nii) [RENAUD [II] (-after 1058) . According to Depoin, Renaud was the son of Hugues pincerna, but he does not cite the corresponding primary source . His hypothesis may be based solely on the charter dated 1067 under which his son \"Hugues fils de Renaud\" consented to the donation of \"la moitié de la terre de Rungis\" by \"son cousin le chambrier Galeran\" to Paris Saint-Martin-des-Champs . \" Ragenaldi camerarii \" witnessed the charter dated 17 Apr 1048 under which Henri I King of France donated \"fiscum Uni-Gradus\" to Chartres Notre-Dame . \"Rainaldus senioris camerarius\" renounced rights relating to \"Villare\" in favour of Fécamp by undated charter, dated to before 1060, witnessed by \"Hugo filius meus cum uxore sua et uxor mea Ermentrudis \" .]\n\n- see below.\n\nb)ALBERT (-before 25 Dec 1047). \"Hugo\" donated property in \"villis Villana, Villereisium Curtis et Brochis\" to Saint-Médard de Soissons, for the souls of \"patris sui Rainoldi et fratris sui Alberti\", by charter dated 25 Dec 1047 .\n\nc)BAUDOUIN (-after 3 Mar 1057). \" Hugonis pincernæ regum, Balduini fratris eiusdem Valterii pincernæ regis \" witnessed the charter dated 3 Mar 1057 under which Henri I King of France donated property to Notre-Dame de Soissons .\n\nRENAUD [II], son of [HUGUES [I] & his wife ---] (-after 1058) . According to Depoin, Renaud was the son of Hugues pincerna, but he does not cite the corresponding primary source .

Joint holder of the castle of Creil: an undated charter names \"Hugo Rainaldi camerarii filius, regis beneficio Credulii dominus\" and \"[Galerannus] ipsi Hugoni et consanguinitate et eiusdem castelli participatione conjunctus\" . \"Hugo filius Reginaldi camerarii\" donated \"tributum navium per Cretellum transeuntium\" to Fécamp by undated charter, witnessed by \"Haimericus de Haurecey nepos Hugonis \" . \"Rainaldus senioris camerarius\" renounced rights relating to \"Villare\" in favour of Fécamp by undated charter, dated to before 1060, witnessed by \"Hugo filius meus cum uxore sua et uxor mea Ermentrudis \" . \"Hugues fils de Renaud\" consented to the donation of \"la moitié de la terre de Rungis\" by \"son cousin le chambrier Galeran\" to Paris Saint-Martin-des-Champs by charter dated 1067 . An undated charter records the grant of pasturage rights \"ad castrum Claromontis, Credulii, Gornaci, Lusarchiarum\" to Saint-Leu dEsserant by \"Hugo comes Cestrensis\" and \"Hugo Claromontensis et Margarita uxor eius\", later confirmed by \"Rainaldus comes\" with the consent of \"uxore eius Clementia et filiis eius Guidone et Rainaldo\" . Seigneur de Mouchy: \" Hugo de Montiaco\" witnessed the charter dated to [before 1092] under which \"Radulphus de Basincourt et Helvidis uxor eius \" donated property \"juxta Manusdivillam\" to Pontoise Saint Martin . Seigneur de Clermont: \"Hugo Clarimontis dns\" confirmed his donations to the church of Saint-Germer-de-Flay, with the consent of \"filiis meis Rainaldo et Guidone\", by charter dated to before Nov 1099 . m (before 1060) MARGUERITE de Ramerupt, daughter of HILDUIN [IV] de Montdidier et de Ramerupt Comte de Roucy & his wife Adelaide de Roucy. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Margareta\" as third daughter of Hilduin Comte de Roucy and names her husband \"comiti Hugonis de Claromonte Baluacensi\" . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"secundam filiam comitis Helduini de Rameruth dictam Margaretam\" as wife of \"Hugo comes de Claro-monte\" . Her marriage date is estimated from the undated charter, dated to before 1060, under which \"Rainaldus senioris camerarius\" renounced rights relating to \"Villare\" in favour of Fécamp, witnessed by \"Hugo filius meus cum uxore sua et uxor mea Ermentrudis \" . An undated charter records the grant of pasturage rights \"ad castrum Claromontis, Credulii, Gornaci, Lusarchiarum\" to Saint-Leu dEsserant by \"Hugo comes Cestrensis\" and \"Hugo Claromontensis et Margarita uxor eius\", later confirmed by \"Rainaldus comes\" with the consent of \"uxore eius Clementia et filiis eius Guidone et Rainaldo\" . Hugues & his wife had eight children:\n\na)RENAUD [III] de Clermont (-before 1162) . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Guido dictus Qui-non-dormit et Hugo Pauper et comes Rainaldus et sorores eorum\" as children of \"Hugo comes de Claro-monte\" and his wife Marguerite . He assumed the title Comte de Clermont [en-Beauvaisis] after his marriage.\n\n- see below.\n\nb)GUY de Clermont (-Rouen 1119). A manuscript entitled Genealogia regum Francorum tertiæ stirpis names \"Guido dictus qui non dormit et Hugo pauper et comes Rainaldus\" as the sons of \"Hugo comes de Claromonte\" and his wife \"filiam comitis Helduini de Rameruth Margaretam\" . \"Hugo Clarimontis dns\" confirmed his donations to the church of Saint-Germer-de-Flay, with the consent of \"filiis meis Rainaldo et Guidone\", by charter dated to before Nov 1099 . Orderic Vitalis records that \"Guido de Claromonte\" was captured at Rouen and died in jail .\n\nc)HUGUES de Clermont (-after 17 Nov 1099). A manuscript entitled Genealogia regum Francorum tertiæ stirpis names \"Guido dictus qui non dormit et Hugo pauper et comes Rainaldus\" as the sons of \"Hugo comes de Claromonte\" and his wife \"filiam comitis Helduini de Rameruth Margaretam\" .\n\nd)ERMENTRUDE de Clermont (-after 13 May 1106) . Orderic Vitalis records that Hugonis de Abrincis filio Ricardi cognomento Goz married Ermentrudem filiam Hugonis de Claromonte Belvacensi . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis refers to a sister of \"comes Rainaldus\" as husband of \"comiti Hugoni de Cestre\" . Ricardus Cestrensis comes et Ermentrudis comitissa mater eius confirmed donations to Abingdon by charter dated 13 May 1106 . m (before 1093) [as his second wife,] HUGUES d'Avranches Earl of Chester, son of RICHARD Le Goz & his wife --- ([1047]-St Werburg's Abbey, Chester 27 Jul 1101).\n\ne)ADELISA de Clermont . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis refers to a sister of \"comes Rainaldus\" as husband of \"Gillebertus, filius Richardi Anglici\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Giselbertus married filia comitis de Claromonte . \"Hadalaidis filia Hugonis de Claromonte uxor Gisleberti de Anglia\" founded an anniversary at Saint-Leu dEsserent, like the anniversaries of \"patris sui Hugonis et matris sue Margarite\", by undated charter . Her second marriage into the Montmorency family is confirmed by the charter dated under which Robert Bishop of Lincoln confirms previous donations to Thorney, including one by Adelidæ de Montemoraci of  terræ in Randa quas Turgisius tenuit et Toui prius dederat , which clearly refers back to the earlier undated charter under which Adeliz, uxor Gilberti filii Ricardi, et Gillebertus et Walterus et Baldewinus et Rohaisia pueri Gilberti donated property quod Tovi dedit et in Randa quas Turgisius tenebat to Thorney Monastery . The precise identity of Adelisas second husband has not yet been confirmed. According to Duchesne, Adelisas second husband was Hervé, son of Bouchard [III] Seigneur de Montmorency and his second wife, but he cites no primary source on which this statement is based . As noted below, the first marriage of Mathieu [I] de Montmorency, who would have been Hervés older half-brother born from their fathers first marriage, is dated to [1126]. This suggests the birth of Mathieu [I] in [1095/1105]. If that estimated date range is correct, any half-brothers born from his fathers second marriage would probably have been too young to have married Adelisa. In addition, given Adelisas prominent family background and first marriage, it is unlikely that her second husband would have been the younger son of the seigneur de Montmorency. As Adelisa had several children by her first husband, she would have been considerably older than her second husband if he had been a younger son of Bouchard [III]. A more likely case is that Adelisas second husband was Bouchard [III] himself, whose age and position would have been more appropriate for the marriage. This is supported by the Liber Vitæ of Thorney abbey which lists \" Gilebt fili[us] Ricardi Burchardus de Muntmorenci Aaliz uxor Gilbti filii Ricardi \", suggested by Keats-Rohan as Adelisa and her two husbands . m firstly [as his second wife,] GILBERT FitzRichard de Clare, son of RICHARD de Brionne Lord of Clare and Tonbridge [Normandy] & his wife Rohese Giffard (-1114 or 1117). m secondly (after [1114/17]) [as his third wife, BOUCHARD [III] Seigneur] de Montmorency, son of [HERVE Seigneur de Montmorency & his wife Agnes --- (-Jerusalem 2 Jan, after 1124)].\n\nf)MARGUERITE de Clermont (-[1136]) . \"Margarita de Gerboreio, filia Hugonis de Claromonte\", on her deathbed, summoned Gerardum maritum suum to donate property to Saint-Leu dEsserent, with the consent of \"Rainaldus comes frater domne Margarite et Petrus filius Gerardi et Beatrix uxor Oddonis de Angivillari\", by charter dated to [1136] . A charter which confirms donations to the abbey of Saint-Paul-en-Beauvaisis includes the donation of sextam partem decimæ de Curleio made by Margaretæ vicedominæ de Gerberedo . m GERARD de Gerberoy, son of --- (-after 1136).\n\ng)RICHILDE de Clermont . The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not been identified. Dame de Mouchy. Depoin states that the Histoire de Vézelay, by Hugues le Poitevin, names Dreux de Mello...et...Richeud, fille de Hugues de Mouchy, sur de Renaud II de Clermont et de Félicie reine dAragon as the parents of Guillaume abbé de Vézelay . However, the passage in question has not been found in the edition of the Histoire which was consulted during the preparation of the present document. A charter which confirms donations to the abbey of Saint-Paul-en-Beauvaisis includes the donation of medietatem altaris de Camberonne made by Richeldis de Merloto and of aliam medietatem by Berneri de Claromonte (the latter not yet having been identified, although his name and joint ownership of the property in question suggests a relationship between Richilde and the Clermont family) . m (before 1101) DREUX [I] Seigneur de Mello, son of GILBERT [I] de Mello & his wife --- (-after [1117/18]).\n\nh)BEATRIX de Clermont (-after 1110) . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis refers to a sister of \"comes Rainaldus\" as wife of \"Matheus comes de Bello-monte, de qua genuit alterum Matheum comitem et fratrem eius et filias\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to, but does not name, one of the sisters of \"comitem Rainaldum\" as \"comites Bellimonti\" . The primary source which confirms her name has not been identified. Dame de ½ Luzarches. m (before 1101) MATHIEU [I] Comte de Beaumont, son of IVES [II] Comte de Beaumont & his second wife Adelais --- (-1 Jan 1155).\n\nGAUTHIER, son of HUGUES [I] & his wife --- (-after 1069) . \" Hugonis pincernæ regum, Balduini fratris eiusdem Valterii pincernæ regis \" witnessed the charter dated 3 Mar 1057 under which Henri I King of France donated property to Notre-Dame de Soissons . \"Miles Gualterus filius Hugonis pincerne regis\" settled a dispute with Saint-Riquier concerning \"la terre de Feuquières-en-Vimeu\" by charter dated 29 Aug 1062 .\n\nm ---. The name of Gauthiers wife is not known.\n\nGauthier & his wife had five children:\n\n1.GALERAN (-1108 or after) . Philippe I King of France confirmed donations made to the abbey of Saint-Christophe en Halatte by miles...Walerannus...unacum fratribus suis...Waltero archidiacono et Hugone necnon Balduino atque Rainaldo, and by Walterus pater suus, by charter dated 30 Apr 1061 . Heddo Suessionensium episcopus et Elinandus Laudunensium præsul...Frollandus Silvanectensis episcopus, Gualerannus camerarius, Theobaldus de Crispiaco, Nivelo de Petræfonte subscribed the charter dated 27 May 1061 under which Philippe I King of France privileges to basilicam...martyris Adriani founded by Richardus Bistisiacensis castellanus miles [Béthisy], with the consent of uxore sua Millesinde et filiis and confirmed donations including by Hugo...Ricardi filius . \"Hugues fils de Renaud\" consented to the donation of \"la moitié de la terre de Rungis\" by \"son cousin le chambrier Galeran\" to Paris Saint-Martin-des-Champs by charter dated 1067 . m as her second husband, HAVISE [de Broyes, widow of RENAUD du Puy-du-Fou, daughter of HUGUES [I] \"Bardoul\" Seigneur de Broyes & his [first wife ---]]. A fragmentary chronicle of the dukes of Aquitaine records that \"Rainaldus de Podio-fagi, Trulli frater germanus cum Helvisa conjuge filiisque suis Hugone atque Willelmo\" donated property de Henssionensi to the abbey of Saint-Maixence . A fragmentary chronicle of the dukes of Aquitaine records that \"Helvisa\" was the daughter of Hugone nuncupato Bardulfo qui tenuit Puirium castrumque de Bellofonte et etiam de Novigento and that she married Valeranno Franciæ Camerario after the death of her first husband . However, it should be noted that this particular source appears not to be completely reliable. Until another source emerges which corroborates Havises origin and marriage, it is best to treat this information with some caution.\n\n2.GAUTHIER . Philippe I King of France confirmed donations made to the abbey of Saint-Christophe en Halatte by miles...Walerannus...unacum fratribus suis...Waltero archidiacono et Hugone necnon Balduino atque Rainaldo, and by Walterus pater suus, by charter dated 30 Apr 1061 .\n\n3.HUGUES . Philippe I King of France confirmed donations made to the abbey of Saint-Christophe en Halatte by miles...Walerannus...unacum fratribus suis...Waltero archidiacono et Hugone necnon Balduino atque Rainaldo, and by Walterus pater suus, by charter dated 30 Apr 1061 .\n\n4.BAUDOUIN . Philippe I King of France confirmed donations made to the abbey of Saint-Christophe en Halatte by miles...Walerannus...unacum fratribus suis...Waltero archidiacono et Hugone necnon Balduino atque Rainaldo, and by Walterus pater suus, by charter dated 30 Apr 1061 .\n\n5.RENAUD . Philippe I King of France confirmed donations made to the abbey of Saint-Christophe en Halatte by miles...Walerannus...unacum fratribus suis...Waltero archidiacono et Hugone necnon Balduino atque Rainaldo, and by Walterus pater suus, by charter dated 30 Apr 1061 .\n\nB. COMTES de CLERMONT[-en-BEAUVAISIS]\n\nRENAUD [III] de Clermont, son of HUGUES [II] de Creil & his wife Marguerite de Ramerupt (-[1152/53]) . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Guido dictus Qui-non-dormit et Hugo Pauper et comes Rainaldus et sorores eorum\" as children of \"Hugo comes de Claro-monte\" and his wife Marguerite . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"comitem Rainaldum\" as son of \"comiti Hugonis de Claromonte Baluacensi\" and his wife Marguerite . Albert of Aix names \" Reinoldus de civitate Belvatiæ \" among those who took part in the siege of Nikaia, dated to mid-1097 from the context . Albert of Aix records that \" Reinaldus de Belvacio \" fought against the Turks at Dorylæum (1 Jul 1097) . \"Hugo Clarimontis dns\" confirmed his donations to the church of Saint-Germer-de-Flay, with the consent of \"filiis meis Rainaldo et Guidone\", by charter dated to before Nov 1099 . He assumed the title Comte de Clermont [en-Beauvaisis] after his first marriage . [Radulfus Oysardi filius donated property at Creil to Saint-Leu dEsserent, and the nuns obtained the consent of \"comitem Rainaldum Claromontensem uxor eius Clementia, filia ipsius Margarita\", by charter dated to [1119] . The dating of this document is problematic: while the presence of Marguerite suggests that she was still unmarried, the date is inconsistent with the estimated birth date of Clémence. It should be noted that Mathon dates the consent given by Comte Renaud to [1153], although he does not state why he says this . If that dating is correct, the witness would have been Renauds daughter Marguerite by his second marriage, although it is unclear why she would have been singled out for giving consent without her brothers and sisters.] A charter dated 1144 confirmed a donation by \"Rainaldus Claromontensis comes\" to Saint-Leu dEsserent, with the consent of \"Clementia uxor prædicti comitis cum filio suo Guidone\" . An undated charter records the grant of pasturage rights \"ad castrum Claromontis, Credulii, Gornaci, Lusarchiarum\" to Saint-Leu dEsserant by \"Hugo comes Cestrensis\" and \"Hugo Claromontensis et Margarita uxor eius\", later confirmed by \"Rainaldus comes\" with the consent of \"uxore eius Clementia et filiis eius Guidone et Rainaldo\" . \"Rainaldus comes de Claromonte et Clemencia uxor eius et Widdo eorum filius\" confirmed donations to Saint-Leu dEsserant made by \"Albericus Paganus comites de Donno Martino pater suus Hugo de Claromonte et Margarita uxor eius et comites Cestrences Hugo et Richardus\", on the advice of \"uxoris meæ Adæ\", by charter dated 1152 . Louvet notes a donation to the priory of Gournay-sur-Aronde made by Rainal Comte de Clermont et Clemence sa femme which was confirmed and supplemented in 1165 by leurs enfans...Raoult Comte de Clermont, Simon, Gautier, Margueritte, Matilde et Comtesse . The charter dated 1153 which records the donation made by his wife and children suggests that Renaud was already dead at that time.\n\nm firstly (1103) ADELAIS Ctss de Vermandois, de Valois et de Crépy, widow of HUGUES de France Comte de Vermandois, daughter and heiress of HERIBERT [VI] Comte de Vermandois & his wife Adelais de Valois ([1065]-28 Sep [1120/24]). The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses names \"Odonem et Adelam sororem\" as the two children of \"comes Herbertus\", specifying that the husband of Adela was \"Hugoni le Magne\" and referring to her second husband \"comes de Claromonte\", specifying that her daughter by the latter married Charles Count of Flanders . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Adelidem comitissam Viromandensium, defuncto priore viro, scilicet Hugone Magno\" as wife of \"comes Rainaldus [de Claromonte]\" .\n\nm secondly ([1135]) [as her second husband,] CLEMENCE de Bar, [widow of --- Comte de Dammartin,] daughter of RENAUD I Comte de Bar & his wife Gisèle de Vaudémont ([1123/27]-after 20 Jan 1182). The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis records that \"comes Rainaldus [de Claromonte]\" married \"comitissam de Dammartin, filiam comitis Rainaldi de Monzuns\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to \"comites de Claromonte Belvacensi\" as descended from \"una sorore eiusdem comitis [=comes Barri iunior Raynaldus]\" . Her birth date range is estimated based on the date of her parents' marriage. Renauds second wife would presumably have held the title Ctss de Dammartin through an earlier marriage to a comte de Dammartin. If she had been the daughter of a comte de Dammartin, she would not have borne the comital title. [Radulfus Oysardi filius donated property at Creil to Saint-Leu dEsserent, and the nuns obtained the consent of \"comitem Rainaldum Claromontensem uxor eius Clementia, filia ipsius Margarita\", by charter dated to [1119] . The dating of this document is problematic: while the presence of Marguerite suggests that she was still unmarried, the date is inconsistent with the estimated birth date of Clémence. It should be noted that Mathon dates the consent given by Comte Renaud to [1153], although he does not state why he says this . If that dating is correct, the witness would have been Renauds daughter Marguerite by his second marriage, although it is unclear why she would have been singled out for giving consent without her brothers and sisters.] Louis VII King of France confirmed what episcopus Parisiensis et Guillelmus Lupus frater eius et comes Damni-Martini Renaudus cum uxore sua donated to Chaalis per concessum Adelizæ de Bulis et filiorum eius Lancelini...et fratrum suorum and the donation of land apud Hermenovillam et...moriens juxta Villam-novam made by Joscelinus de Damno-Martino, by charter dated 1138 . The property the subject of the first-named donation is not specified in the charter. However, a possibly linked charter dated to [1137] records that Willelmus Lupus Silvanectensis donated locum...in quo situm est cnobium...[et] usum totius Espioniæ et Beeley, with the support of uxore mea Adelvia, filioque meo majore...Guidone and sealed by fratris mei Stephani Parisiensis episc. . The charter dated 1138 also provides a possible indication of Clémences family origin: the joint donation suggests a joint interest in the property donated, and so a connection with the family of the bouteillers de Senlis (to which Guillaume le Loup and his brother Etienne Bishop of Paris belonged). A charter dated 1144 confirmed a donation by \"Rainaldus Claromontensis comes\" to Saint-Leu dEsserent, with the consent of \"Clementia uxor prædicti comitis cum filio suo Guidone\" . An undated charter records the grant of pasturage rights \"ad castrum Claromontis, Credulii, Gornaci, Lusarchiarum\" to Saint-Leu dEsserant by \"Hugo comes Cestrensis\" and \"Hugo Claromontensis et Margarita uxor eius\", later confirmed by \"Rainaldus comes\" with the consent of \"uxore eius Clementia et filiis eius Guidone et Rainaldo\" . \"Rainaldus comes de Claromonte et Clemencia uxor eius et Widdo eorum filius\" confirmed donations to Saint-Leu dEsserant made by \"Albericus Paganus comites de Donno Martino pater suus Hugo de Claromonte et Margarita uxor eius et comites Cestrences Hugo et Richardus\", on the advice of \"uxoris meæ Adæ\", by charter dated 1152 . Louvet notes a donation to the priory of Gournay-sur-Aronde made by Rainal Comte de Clermont et Clemence sa femme which was confirmed and supplemented in 1165 by leurs enfans...Raoult Comte de Clermont, Simon, Gautier, Margueritte, Matilde et Comtesse . Louis VII King of France confirmed an agreement between Eudes Prior of Saint-Denis and \"Donni Martini comitissam Clementiam\" who relinquished rights in Trenbleio by charter dated 1153 . Mathieu quotes a charter of Manassès Bishop of Meaux, dated to [1157], which records property first donated to Chaalis by Domnimartini comitissa Clementia, laudante viro suo Renaldo de Clarimonte as well as her donation of rights of way and use of wood in omnia terra belonging to consulatum Domnimartini . Clementia comitissa de Domno Martino cum liberis meis renounced rights over villa Trembliaco after disputes between the abbey of Saint-Denis and antecessores nostros comites de Dompno Martino, litigated before regis Ludovici, by undated charter (dated to [1153/62]), witnessed by Ansoldus de Claromonte et Petrus nepos eius, Galterus de Alneto... .

Duchesne states that Thibaut [III] de Nanteuil married Clemence veuve de Renaut Comte de Clairmont en Beauvoisin by whom he had three children, but does not cite the corresponding primary source . The primary source which confirms this third marriage has not been identified, and from a chronological point of view it appears unlikely to be correct particularly as she is supposed to have had children by her third husband.]\n\nComte Renaud & his first wife had two children:\n\n1.MARGUERITE de Clermont ([1104/05]-after 1145) . [Radulfus Oysardi filius donated property at Creil to Saint-Leu dEsserent, and the nuns obtained the consent of \"comitem Rainaldum Claromontensem uxor eius Clementia, filia ipsius Margarita\", by charter dated to [1119] . The dating of this document is problematic: while the presence of Marguerite suggests that she was still unmarried, the date is inconsistent with the estimated birth date of Clémence. It should be noted that Mathon dates the consent given by Comte Renaud to [1153], although he does not state why he says this . If that dating is correct, the witness would have been Renauds daughter Marguerite by his second marriage, although it is unclear why she would have been singled out for giving consent without her brothers and sisters.] The Vita Karoli Comitis Flandriæ names \"nobilem puellam Margaretam, Reinaldi comitis Clarmontensis filiam\" as wife of Count Charles, specifying that the marriage took place before his accession . The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses refers to (but does not name) the daughter of \"comes de Claromonte\" and his wife Adela, specifying that she married firstly Charles Count of Flanders, secondly \"Hugo Champdaveine comes Sancti Pauli\" by whom she had \"Radulfus Champdaveine et Guod Champdaveine\", and thirdly \"dominus Balduinus de Encra\" by whom she had \"domini Galteri de Helli\" . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis refers to, but does not name, the daughter of \"comes Rainaldus [de Claromonte]\" & his wife Adelaide as wife of \"comes Karolus Flandre\" . It is assumed that Marguerite was born soon after her parents' marriage as her mother was already nearly 40 years old at the time. m firstly (before Jul 1119) CARL of Denmark, son of KNUD II \"den Hellige/the Holy\" King of Denmark & his wife Adela de Flandre ([1084]-murdered Bruges 2 Mar 1127, bur Bruges, St Donatien, later Saint-Sauveur).

The presence of Guy, without his brothers, in the charter dated 1144 quoted below, suggests that he was his fathers oldest surviving son at the time. This suggestion appears corroborated by the order of the names of Renauds sons in the following source. The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Guidonem et Rainaldum et Hugonem archidiaconum Metensem et Galterum cum aliis utriusque sexus\" as children of \"comes Rainaldus [de Claromonte]\" and his wife \"comitissam de Dammartin, filiam comitis Rainaldi de Monzuns\" . A charter dated 1144 confirmed a donation by \"Rainaldus Claromontensis comes\" to Saint-Leu dEsserent, with the consent of \"Clementia uxor prædicti comitis cum filio suo Guidone\" .

It should be noted that the Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Guidonem et Rainaldum et Hugonem archidiaconum Metensem et Galterum cum aliis utriusque sexus\" as children of \"comes Rainaldus [de Claromonte]\" and his wife \"comitissam de Dammartin, filiam comitis Rainaldi de Monzuns\" but makes no mention of Raoul , although other sources quoted below confirm his parentage.

The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"comitissam Clarimontis Belvacensis et uxorem Symonis Clarimontis et Emiciam\" as the three daughters of \"Alaydis [filia comitem de Brana Robertum domnum]\" & her first husband , although it appears chronologically impossible for Alix, wife of Raoul Comte de Clermont, to have been the daughter of Valeran [III] by his second wife. The correct parentage of Alix and her sister Mathilde is confirmed by the charter dated 1153 which records that Galerannum de Britoglio donated property at Champmartin at Rueil-sur-Bèche to Froidmont abbey, with the consent of Hugone fratre suo...et Holdeburge uxore Galeranni, Aalsi et Mathilde filiabus eius .

If avunculus in this document can be interpreted in its strict sense of maternal uncle, Goberts mother would have been the sister of Simon [II] de Clermont. If this hypothesis is correct, a Papal dispensation would have been necessary (on the assumption that the paternal grandmother of Renaud [I] de Dargies, Jeanne [Beatrix], was the daughter of Simon [I] de Clermont as suggested below) as Renauds father would have been the first cousin to his wife. That appears to be rather close consanguinity for the grant of a dispensation. If, on the other hand, Jeanne [Beatrix] was the daughter of Amicie de Breteuil (another difficult problem which is discussed elsewhere in the present document) the relationship would be more remote. Another explanation of 9 Sep 1278 charter is that avunculus is used in a broad sense to describe Goberts blood relationship with Simon de Clermont. m [as his first wife,] RENAUD [I] Seigneur de Dargies, son of SIMON [I] Seigneur de Dargies & his wife Isabelle de Mello (-[19 Mar/Dec] 1269).]\n\n2.GUY . \"Dnus Symon de Alliaco\" donated property to Saint-Leu dEsserent, with the consent of \"Matildis uxor eius et filii eius Radulfus et Guido et Dnus Robertus de Bova\", by charter dated to before 1191, but received 1193, signed by \"Rodulfus comes de Claromonte \" .\n\n3.

Père Anselme records Ada as the daughter of Gilles de Mailly seigneur dAcheu et de Peronne de Rayneval, and in another place as the daughter of Gilles [IV] Seigneur de Mailly & his wife Marguerite de Friencourt (no sources cited) . The explanation for this confusion has not been found, although the dates attributed to the husband of Adas supposed half-sister [Isabelle] (follow Adas hyperlink) are consistent with both Isabelle and Ada being the daughters of Perronne. The dates of her mothers first husbands death and of Adas second marriage, as well as the chronology of Adas children by her second husband, suggest her own estimated birth date. Her family origin is indicated by the arms of [her grandson] Hector de Flavy, shown in the [1455] Armorial Le Breton, which shows Mailly alongside Raineval in the third row (on his mothers side) . Père Anselme records that Ada plaidoit en 1362 et 1363 with her second husband against the brothers of her first husband for her dower (no source citations) . She married thirdly (before 1 Nov 1391) as his second wife, Guy [II] de Laval Seigneur dAttichy et de Chantilly.

Père Anselme records her parentage and three marriages, the first as shown below, the second with Guy de Beaumont Seigneur de Brétigny and the third with Hector de Chartres Seigneur dOns-en-Bray (no source citations), this possible third marriage being chronologically inconsistent with Blanches [first] marriage as discussed above . A charter dated 25 Sep 1397 records that Flavy (Raoul sgr de) et de Basentin comme mary de madame Blanche de Néelle held la moitié de la terre dAcheu de labbaye de Corbie and that ladite dame devoit jouir après la vie de madame de Montigny et de madame Ade de Mailly dame dOffemont .

Secondary sources available online show that Blanche had numerous children by her [first] husband. The identity of her Anselme-proposed second husband has not been confirmed, but the accuracy of Anselmes suggestion must be doubtful the longer her [first] husband survived (the source which confirms his date of death has not been identified). Is it possible that Guy de Beaumont was in fact the first husband of [Blanche] de Nesle, wife of Hector de Chartres who is shown above? Checking this suggestion depends on finding a source which provides some chronological indications about the life of Guy de Beaumont. m (before 25 Sep 1397) RAOUL de Flavy Seigneur de Bazentin, son of PIERRE de Flavy & Marie de Montauban Dame de Bazentin.\n\nd)JEANNE de Nesle .

Père Anselme records her parentage and marriage without citing any sources on which this information is based .
