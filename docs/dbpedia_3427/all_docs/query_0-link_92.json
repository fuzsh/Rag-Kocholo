The Abbey Theatre remains an excellent venue for new Irish playwrights, such as Hugh Leonard with his comedy-drama Love in the Title, 1999.\n\nAn Irish repertory company founded in 1904 in a building donated by a wealthy theater enthusiast, Miss A. E. F. Hornimann. Inspired by nationalism amongst the Irish, playwrights William Butler Yeats (1865–1939), Augusta Gregory (1852– 1932), and John Millington Synge (1871–1909) created the Abbey Theatre. These poetic writers who wanted to give voice to the native spirit of Ireland, free from any political group both ideologically and ﬁnancially, free from the need for popular consensus and free from European inﬂuence. In their plays they utilized the language of the common people, realistic yet naturally poetic. Their actors were amateurs, with a very natural acting style derived from a cultural propensity toward dramatics, unspoiled by outside inﬂuence. William Fay and his brother Frank were among the ﬁnest of the actors in these early years. Other excellent actors during this time were Dudley Digges (1879–1947), Barry Fitzgerald (1888– 1961), J. A. O’Rourke, Marie NicShuibhlaigh (died in 1958), and two sisters, Marie O’Neill (1887– 1952) and Sara Allgood (1883–1950). From the late 1920s to the 1950s the Abbey Theatre became more conservative in its content, style, and form but remained popular with audiences. In 1951 the theater building was destroyed by a ﬁre, and the Abbey moved into the Queen’s Theatre. With government ﬁnancial assistance a new\n\nReferences: Fraizier, Adrian.

Bombay: Marg, 1982.\n\nAbsurdism France A post–World War II artistic movement that expressed the belief that truth is unknowable and the world irrational. The term was ﬁrst applied to the work of dramatist Albert Camus (1913– 1960) whose plays, such as Caligula written in 1938, dramatize the absurd condition of humankind. Primary writers of the absurdist viewpoint are Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), Eugène Ionesco (1912–1994), and Jean Genet (1910– 1\n\n2 Abua Masquerade 1986). This movement was labeled by Martin Esslin’s book The Theatre of the Absurd in 1961. Actors in these dramas are challenged to accept new paradigms of reality and progress logically from there in their building of a character. They are challenged to reach for their desires while maintaining or creating meaning around them. Absurd plays are not merely ridiculous or random, nor do the actors within them act as though they were. They are purposeful attempts to demonstrate absurdity in life as the playwright sees it. In plays by Ionesco, actors spout clichéd lines that espouse values received from the machine of society, lines that are ultimately meaningless. In his plays actors must reach for meaning for their characters given absurd limitations, as when a deaf-mute tells the audience the meaning of life in The Chairs, 1952. Through the actor’s effort the playwright’s purpose is realized, to demonstrate the theme of nothingness pervasive in the world. In Beckett’s play Happy Days, 1961, the female protagonist rambles on optimistically about petty details of her life while buried in sand to her waist. As the sand gradually increases she still refuses to be dismayed by her predicament. In all absurdist dramas actors are bringing to life the human struggle for meaning in a world seemingly void of it. See also Existentialism References: Coe, Richard. The Vision of Jean Genet.

The audience takes an active role in performances, with young and old singing, dancing, and drumming. Performers wear carved headpieces that cover the entire head. Cloth is sewn to the underside of the cap mask that drapes over the body of the performer. A loop of young palm fronds is hung around the neck and locust beans are tied round the ankles to supply rhythm. References: Ekwuema, Lazarus E.

Actors had to audition for a lifelong membership in this training group, organized to avoid the ﬁnancial pressure of commercial theater. At the Studio there developed a new distinctly American form of the Method, based on the teaching of the Russian Stanislavsky, an approach that arguably still remains the quintessential style of acting in America. Lee Strasberg, who had been one of the founding members of the Group Theater, began teaching at the Studio in 1949 and served as its director from 1951 until his death in 1982. He trained the best of American actors through the years, including Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Kim Stanley, James Dean, Anne Bancroft, Marilyn Monroe, Dustin Hoffman, Robert de Niro, Al Pacino, Shelley Winters, and Geraldine Page. Strasberg was a master at unleashing the expressiveness of actors. Some say the Method as he taught it was psychologically damaging for the actors themselves, since the work relied heavily upon the actor’s past experiences and dredging up old pain, but no one can argue with the results he got out of his actors. He nurtured a lot of talent for both stage and ﬁlm and created apt actors for the psychological dramas of the time, such as those by Tennessee Williams. Some praise the Actors Studio for its psychological realism, achieved through inward introspection, while others criticize it for being self-indulgent, characterized by actors so inwardly focused that all that results is slouching shoulders and inarticulate speech. Elia Kazan directed some outstanding ﬁlms, such as A Streetcar Named Desire, 1951, On the Waterfront, 1954, and East of Eden, 1955, showcasing the Method acting of the Actors Studio’s members. The Studio continues its tradition of training\n\nmany of the best actors in America. Since the late 1980s the Actors Studio has produced a television series featuring interviews with the leading actors of our time. References: Garﬁeld, David. The Actors Studio: A Player’s Place.

In Roman ancient drama, near the third century blood thirst had reached a peak such that gory death scenes were enacted in which a slave or condemned criminal was actually killed. Until the 1940s in Turkey Shiite Muslims enacted a Persian passion play that sometimes became so frenzied that performers would commit suicide. In Mexico the Aztec would costume a slave to represent the god Quetzalcoátl and actually sacriﬁce him on the ﬁnal day of the festival.

Adavus were originally called Karanas in the Natya Sastra, ancient sacred Hindu text on dramaturgy, which describes 108 dance units, giving directions for body positions, movements of feet and legs, and hand gestures. There are approximately 15 groups of Adavus, which are further broken down into types. References: Massey, Reginald, and Jamie Massey. Dances of India.

Her father, Jacob Adler, active in the Yiddish Theater, was known\n\n4 Aeschylus as the Jewish Henry Irving, and her mother, Sarah Adler, was also a great actress. Stella began acting as a child with her parents and toured England and the United States, even appearing on Broadway. Adler, a tall blonde with an attractive regal air, was one of the strongest performers at the Group Theater. Her best role was in Clifford Odet’s Awake and Sing! in 1935, as a downtrodden Depression-era housewife. In the same year she traveled with her husband, Harold Clurman, to Paris to meet with Stanislavsky. They studied with him for over a month and speciﬁcally discussed how the Method was being used in the United States and what problems the Group Theatre were facing. Adler differed with Lee Strasberg, who was very internal in his approach to the Method. Adler stressed the use of the imagination and transcending the actor’s limited life experience. She stressed thorough investigation into the play’s circumstances to ﬁnd guidance for the actor creating a role. In 1949 she created and directed the Stella Adler Conservatory in New York. In 1966 she began teaching at the Yale Drama School. References: Adler, Stella. Stella Adler on Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov.

The efforts and developments of earlier ancient playwrights were brought to near perfection in the dramatic works of Aeschylus. Focusing on cosmic conﬂicts, Aeschylus was representative of the world of early ﬁfth-century Greece, in which the primary concern of the society was the relationship of human beings with the gods. Since the characters of Aeschylus were types rather than full-ﬂedged individuals, they had only a limited number of salient traits. Aeschylus is credited with many important innovations that have inﬂuenced the development of Western theater. Thespis is believed to be the ﬁrst actor to separate himself from the chorus, thus creating dramatic confrontation. Aeschylus heightened the dramatic intensity even farther by introducing the second actor. He also gave more depth to minor characters, such as watchmen or slaves, than had been done before. Aeschylus in-\n\nAesop Italy Popular tragic actor of the ﬁrst century B.C. in Rome, born in Greece.

The northern part of Africa is much more Middle\n\nAfrica 5 Eastern, as it was a part of the Ottoman Empire, and accordingly it is primarily discussed under the heading Arab Theater; it is also much more European, because of its geographic proximity to Europe. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to innumerable African tribes and peoples and languages, evident from the fact that there are over a hundred distinct languages in Nigeria alone. By the late nineteenth century, this area was divided into spheres of inﬂuence by various European countries, primarily France, Great Britain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Spain, and Italy. In most of Africa independence movements had brought an end to European colonial rule by the 1960s. In South Africa, however, domination by the minority of European descent continued until 1994. Theatrical activity in Africa can be divided into three categories, precolonial indigenous performances, colonial performances, and postcolonial (often anticolonial) theater.These categories often overlap, since, for example, many indigenous performances continued to be performed even after colonization. Each period did however greatly affect mostly all theater during its time, whether that theater was a product of a previous period or a recent creation. Little is known of the theatrical performances of Black Africa prior to European inﬂuence, especially when one considers what richness must have existed, based on the scanty reports of early European missionaries and traders. African people did not record their scripts, as almost all theater was improvised, nor did they document their cultural history. What is known of this period is based primarily on reports by European missionaries and traders, or on the work of scholars who, either during or after colonial times, researched the ancient forms that were still intact (though most likely evolved to some degree). Though a homogeneous view of black African theater would be simplistic and inaccurate, some common trends do emerge from an overview of dramatic expression in Africa. African theater, the theater of Black Africans, has always served a higher purpose than mere entertainment or diversion. From its ritual roots through to its recent anticolonial expression of protest, African theater has accomplished an essential function in sustaining the community. In precolonial times this function took such shapes\n\nas ridding the village of evil for the new year, praising a mighty chief or hunter, or preparing warriors for battle. Theatrical conventions that prevailed during the precolonial period involved such an active relationship between audience and performer that the audience was an equal participant. The performing area was most often a clearing in the center of the village, or a clearing just outside the village if the preparations for a performance required secrecy. Customarily no setting was constructed to place the action of a performance in a different locale. Trance and spirit possession, usually involving masks, were often elements of performances. Performances were rooted in the community’s supernatural beliefs and were most often associated with festivals, rituals, and ceremonies. Performers were almost exclusively men, who were often part of a secret society that kept the details and mechanics of performances hidden from women and uninitiated males. Males performed all female roles, male roles, and the parts of animals and spirits. Female impersonation was a talent highly regarded by audiences, who delighted in witnessing a male imitate the stylized movements of a woman. One exception to the male-only rule is found in the Sande Masks of Sierra Leone, in which female initiates performed masked dances as part of their training to become adult women of the community. Indigenous African religion holds that the spirits can enter the human world through masks. The human masked performer, who is often in a trance or possessed, embodies the spirit, lending his human body for supernatural expression. Masked performances occurred and still occur throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Praisesinging, another common performance form, features one male who heaps praise upon a chief or hunter through poetry, song, and gestures. The Mai Komo of Nigeria and Niger, and the Imbongi of South Africa are two traditions of praisesingers. Numerous traditions of traveling performers thrive throughout Africa, from single performers, such as the ‘dan Kama, a juggler, dancer, and comic performer solely dedicated to praising food, to groups of traveling minstrels such as ‘yankama, who sometimes perform vulgar satires. Colonial theater consisted primarily of European colonizers performing classic texts from\n\n6 African American Theater their own cultural heritages. Since colonizers took control over schools for Black Africans, sometimes these productions were staged in schools by black students. The most famous school for theater was the Ecole William Ponty in Senegal. Many clubs and organizations, such as the Amicale in Niger, were organized by European administrators and a small African elite to present plays and even engage in competitions with neighboring colonies. Postcolonial theater in Africa began as a theater of protest, usually against the colonizing power from which the people sought independence. Once independence was gained for each country, political theater generally continued as a critical watchdog over emerging African governments. The prominent Nigerian playwright, Wole Soyinka, is probably the most eloquent of the individual political and social reformers who have spoken through their plays. Because the restrictive regime of apartheid continued for so long, oppressing the black Africans in South Africa until 1994, the theater of protest in that country is arguably the most vibrant and artistically elevated in all of Africa, perhaps in the world. As black Africans continue to search for their own theatrical traditions, apart from European colonial models, it seems that what thrive are improvised performances focused on some local concern that integrate comedy with seriousness and often music and dance with theatrical expression. This tendency is evident in the success of Wasan Kwaikwayo, Hausa plays from Niger, the Worker Plays of South Africa, and the Trios, concert parties including improvised comic skits of Ghana. Much of contemporary African theater is enriched by incorporating elements of traditional village theater such as masking and audience involvement. In general, theatrical scholarship on Africa disproportionately focuses on colonial theater and recent African literary forms that adhere to the Western model, in other words, on plays that are scripted and performed to a largely inert audience. The richness and variety of the interactive live performing arts of Africa created by black Africans is a treasure yet to be discovered by those outside the immediate communities that give birth to them. The absence of written texts in the\n\nAfrican languages certainly diminishes the inﬂuence of African theater, but it does not subtract anything from its true value. The indigenous theater of Africa stands as an excellent example of how theater can contribute to sustaining harmony, well-being, and vitality in a community.

Mister Brown, as he is most commonly known, also wrote the play The Drama of King Shotaway (1823), which is credited with being the ﬁrst black-authored drama in America. His African Company, which presented programs of classical and popular plays, music, ballet and opera through the early 1920s, was constantly harassed by white hoodlums and was eventually forced to close by the police, ostensibly for disturbance of the peace. After the Civil War (1861–1865) the highly trained Anna (1856–1930) and Emma (1858–1899) Hyers toured the country. Bob Cole (1868–1911) organized a stock company of African Americans\n\nAfrican Ballets 7 and a school for acting in 1887 in New York. After 1920 more opportunities to act in serious dramas arose, such as those enjoyed by Charles Gilpin (1878–1930), who in 1920 gained great acclaim for his performance in The Emperor Jones by Eugene O’Neill (1920) with the Provincetown Players. In 1943, Paul Robeson (1898–1976) played the title role in Shakespeare’s Othello, a role most often played by a white actor in blackface, in a recordbreaking run in New York. Other great African American actors to emerge were Richard Harrison (1864–1935), Ethel Waters (1900–1977), and Canada Lee (1907–1952). A more indigenous style of African American performing was copied and exaggerated by whites in blackface in the minstrel, a kind of show popular in the nineteenth century, and then copied again by African American minstrels, who began to imitate a white stereotype of themselves. Some leading black minstrels were Earnest Hogan (1865–1909) and Sam Lucas (1840–1916). African Americans also created many popular vaudeville troupes, including Sissieretta Jones’s Black Patti Troubadours and Gus Hill’s Smart Set (1902–1903). Seating was segregated at most of these events, and sometimes blacks were not allowed at all. Another popular form of theater that was relatively early to introduce African American performers into the mainstream was the musical.The ﬁrst black musical A Trip to Coontown, hit Broadway in 1898. A true African American theater, with African American actors performing scripts by African Americans for a majority African American audience began to materialize with successes such as the American Negro Theatre in the 1940s and 1950s and with successful individual actors, writers, and directors such as Alice Childress. Lorraine Hansberry’s (1930–1965) A Raisin in the Sun appeared on Broadway in 1956 with a nearly allblack cast. The play deals seriously with issues of identity, dreams and maintaining dignity for African Americans in a predominantly white society. Other important African American writers include James Baldwin (1924–1987), who wrote Blues for Mister Charlie, 1964, and Les Blancs (The Whites), which was ﬁrst produced in 1970, and Le Roi Jones, later Amiri Baraka, who wrote the revolutionary Dutchman, 1964, about a white woman seducing and killing an intellectual black man. Maya\n\nAngelou began her show business career as a nightclub singer and worked her way up to performing in Porgy and Bess (1954–1955) throughout Europe on a tour. On Broadway she portrayed a black dressmaker in Look Away (1973). For the theater she has written And Still I Rise (1979) and On a Southern Journey (1983). Ntozake Shange wrote the choreopoem, a poetic piece set to movement, for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf, 1976, in which she created a musical language and style of presentation true to the African American experience by breaking down the language of her oppressors and adding more movement, poetry, and rhythm. In 1963 Hazel Bryant (1939–1983) established the Afro American Total Theater in New York, later changed to the Richard Allen Center, where she produced a wide variety of productions, from gospel-style musicals to an allblack version of O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night (1981). She also served on the Black Theater Alliance (1969–1982), an umbrella group for struggling black theaters. Another important African American playwright is August Wilson, who wrote Fences, 1985, The Piano Lesson, 1987, and Two Trains Running, 1990. Suzan-Lori Parks’s play Venus (1996), directed by Richard Forman, at the Public Theater in New York focuses on how choice does not exist for those suffering sexism, racism, economic strife or physical threats. Actress Adina Porter excelled in her portrayal of Venus. See also Africa References: Fraden, Rena. Blueprints for a Black Federal Theatre, 1935–1939.

These perform-\n\n8 African Cinema ances, which are not, as the name implies, Western ballets, were popularized by students from secondary schools and by clubs such as Amicales. Ballets are inspired by indigenous cultural traditions, but are truly original creations, often choreographed with great care and attention to detail. Most ballets contain some dialogue, and many enact a story. Song and dance are the essential elements of ballet, which distinguishes them from Wasan Kwaikwayo, a popular form of improvised theater, in which song and dance may be present but are not necessary ingredients. Ballets preserve the cultural and artistic heritage of the black African people while allowing it to evolve. References: Beik, Janet. Hausa Theatre in Niger:A Contemporary Oral Art.

The ﬁrst work by a sub-Saharan African ﬁlmmaker occurred in Guinea in 1953 with the ﬁlm Mourani. The work of Ousmane Sembene of Senegal, the leading ﬁlmmaker of sub-Saharan Africa, had an international vision of his own country’s complexities. His ﬁlms bring out the ironies and difficulties of being a country in transition with sensitivity and humor. Most of the cinema outside of North Africa has emerged in France’s former colonies in West Africa, including Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Mali. Films are also being produced in East Africa, notably in Kenya and Tanzania. In southern Africa the British were not as active in supporting and encouraging film during colonial times as was France in West Africa. Thus, the history of film in the south has mostly been instances of Western directors using southern Africa for a location but bringing in their own actors and crews, doing little to develop the local talent. More recently, however, some local filmmakers have produced quality works to establish names for themselves, notably Michael\n\nHammon of South Africa and Godwin Mawuru of Zimbabwe.

Albania was declared a republic in 1920. After 1944 Albania was allied with the USSR, but broke with them in 1960 to form an alliance with China. In 1992 Albania became a non-Communist country. It is believed that a rich folk theater tradition that developed in the fourth century still ﬂavors performance styles today. Near the end of the nineteenth century the ﬁrst Albanian play was written and performed, The Wedding of Lunxheria (1874) by Koto Hoxhi (1824–1895). At this time many amateur theater clubs were formed. Through popular support, the theater ﬂourished after independence was achieved in 1912.The conservative government began to censor the theater by the 1930s.The ﬁrst professional theater was founded in Tirana in 1945. In 1989 this theater company ﬁnally became the National Theater. Major dramatic works from Europe were\n\nAllen, Woody 9 the most popular plays being produced in the 1940s and 1950s. Native scripts were encouraged by the state, which subsidized theater, in the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1990s over twenty professional theater groups existed, all receiving funding from the state. The National Theater continues to be the most important theater institution in Albania.

Following the war, audiences who had been exposed to high-quality French theater troupes grew tired of native forms. Western-style comedy created by two men became the mainstay of modern Algerian theater. Rashid Ksentini (1887–1944) wrote delightful comedies such as My Cousin from Istanbul, and a singer, Bashtarzi Muhi’l-Din, who turned actor and playwright in 1930, was the creator of Algerian musical theater. His career began by performing simple plays that featured popular Algerian songs. His later work developed far beyond that into comedy of manners, such as A Marriage by Telephone. He was head of the Arab theater performing in the Opera House at Algiers. In the 1950s Algerian theater was openly revolutionary in declaring the evils of the French colonists in plays such as Nahu an-Nour (Toward the Light) (1958). In 1958 the National Liberation Front Arts Company was started in exile in Tunisia, becoming the National Theater Company of Algeria upon its return in 1963. In 1987 a quarter-century of Algerian independence was celebrated with many new performances and visiting theater companies. In the 1990s a wide range of theater, from the National Theater to experimental groups, thrived. The Algerian National Institute of Cinema allowed for the production of many high-quality feature ﬁlms in the 1970s. Themes included liberation struggles, treatment of women, and the pressure of urban living.Two movies by ﬁlmmaker\n\nMuhammad Lakhdar Hamina, The Oracle Winds, 1966, and Chronicle of the Hot Years, 1975, were prize winners at the Cannes Film Festival in France.

To realize this desired alienation effect, Brecht had actors step out of character during a performance to directly address the audience. Other devices include the use of placards that announce the outcome of the scene to follow so that the audience does not get carried away by the suspense of the drama, characters speaking about themselves in the pasttense, and characters verbally explaining their stage directions.

For this ﬁlm,Allen was awarded Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture. (Kobol Collection/United Artists)\n\nand proliﬁc ﬁlmmakers. His character, seemingly on and off screen, is that of a nervous neurotic Jew obsessed with his mother and sexuality. His glasses and befuddled expression, his relentless examination of relationships with therapists, his thick New York accent, all contribute to make him a one-ofa-kind, irreplaceable icon of American culture. Writing comedy since his adolescence, Allen started performing his work in cafes in New York. His ﬁrst ﬁlm was What’s New, Pussycat? in 1965. By the 1970s Allen was most commonly writing, directing, and starring in all of his movies, including Sleeper, 1973. He gained acclaim with Annie Hall, 1977, co-starring Diane Keaton. Just as Allen’s character seemed the same in life as in his ﬁlms, so too, his romantic life most often included his present favorite female co-star. After Keaton came Mia Farrow, with whom he made the critically acclaimed Hannah and Her Sisters, 1986. Allen continued to grow and mature as a ﬁlmmaker with Crimes and\n\nMisdemeanors, 1989.

In their plays they tried to discover an acting style based in the character and rhythms of\n\nAncient Greek Theater 11 African Americans. Hiring both black and white actors, their ﬁrst production, in 1941, was Natural Man. Other successful shows were On Striver’s Row by Abram Hill and Philip Yordan’s Anna Lucasta, 1944, which transferred to Broadway, where it enjoyed over 957 performances. Outstanding actors to receive training and emerge from this company were Ruby Dee, Harry Belafonte, Alice Childress, and Sidney Poitier. The group toured the United States and Europe until it disbanded in 1953. It was not able to achieve all of its goals, but is still important historically as an inﬂuential model and the most successful sustained attempt of its time to create an African American theater.

Models for democracy, architecture, and drama from ancient Greece, especially Athens, still inﬂuence the world in the twenty-ﬁrst century. What we know of ancient Greek theater leads us to believe that the collaborative efforts of playwrights, musicians, actors, dancers, and costumers must have made for a spectacular experience. Witnessed from the enormous open-air stone amphitheaters, the Greek myths were brought to life by masked actors who could both utter eloquent speech and ﬂy into a furious rage. Neither the exact date of origin nor the inﬂuences and motivations are known for the Greek theater. Early inﬂuences could be ceremonies and major festivals from Egyptian civilization in the ﬁrst millennium B.C., such as those surrounding the Osiris myth. Homer created the Iliad and the Odyssey, the ﬁrst records of Greek mythology still extant today, and it is on these epics and others believed to be by Homer that the stories of ancient Greek theater, especially tragedy, are based. Dramatic impersonation developed from the dithyramb—a kind of hymn honoring the Greek god of wine, Dionysus—and was an act of worship performed at festivals for Dionysus, known as Dionysia. The most lavish of these festivals, the Athenian City Dionysia, hosted the ﬁrst dramatic competition, of which Thespis was the winner in 534 B.C. The highest level of playwriting was achieved in ﬁfth-century Athens, with works that are still considered to be among the greatest of Western dramatic literature. Greek theater continued to thrive through the fourth and third centuries, but the focus shifted from the playwrights to the actors. In 336 B.C. Alexander the Great came to\n\n12 Ancient Greek Theater\n\nMasks used in classical Greek drama, from a seventeenth-century work by Francesco de Ficoroni, Le Maschere Sceniche e ﬁgure comiche d’antichi romani. (The Art Archive/Casa Goldoni Museum Venice/Dagli Orti)\n\npower, the spread of Greek culture created by his conquests marked the beginning of Hellenistic theater; comedy was favored over tragedy, and actors, instead of playwrights, became the highlight of all theatrical events. In 146 B.C. the Romans took over mainland Greece, thus marking the ﬁnal decline of Greek theater and the renewed emergence of Roman theater. Ancient Greek theater was written in three distinguishable forms. Greek tragedy, in its most famous examples, centers around a protagonist engaged in a moral struggle of high consequence that leads to his or her ruin or extreme unhappiness. The great tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were all often winners of the dramatic contest at the City Dionysia. At the end of each day of competition at the City Dionysia, each playwright also performed one satyr play, which is an often obscene play of comic relief. These plays featured a chorus of men dressed as satyrs,\n\nfollowers of Dionysus who were half man and half beast. Greek comedy, the third dramatic form, originated perhaps from the padded dancers of the early sixth century B.C. According to Aristotle, in his dramatic treatise the Poetics, comedy featured men as worse than they are. Thus, the folly of human action is exposed, and human weakness is indulged for comic effect.The most acclaimed playwright from the period of Greek comedy known as Old Comedy is Aristophanes, whose political satire was as biting as it was clever. Menander was the best-known playwright of New Comedy, and he focused more on comical domestic situations. Greek dramas were performed by male actors exclusively. One of the most famed performers was Polus, who lived in the fourth century B.C. Aside from the actors who performed the main roles, other performers were the members of the Greek Chorus, which numbered from ﬁfteen to ﬁfty. Their chief function was to sing and dance the choral odes that divided the acts of a drama. Greek theaters were widely dispersed; they were built any place the Greeks colonized and developed a city-state—in present-day Turkey, Sicily, and even in the south of France. The audience, numbering up to 15,000, sat in rising rows forming a half circle around the performing area. Greek theaters were most often set in a natural amphitheater that was set into the steep sides of a hill. The acoustics were so remarkable in these outdoor theaters that the unampliﬁed human voice could be heard from the stage anywhere in the audience. Such theaters remain in Epidaurus and on the side of the Acropolis in Athens, though both are somewhat eroded and have been altered through the centuries. The orchestra is the circular playing area closest to the audience. This centerpiece was the main acting area and the area in which the chorus sang and danced. There were eisodoi or broad ramps leading to the orchestra from either side that were used by most of the audience when arriving and by the actors for most of their entrances and exits. On the far side of the orchestra was the skene, or scene house, which functioned as a background for the action of the play and a changing room for the actors. Various stage properties may have been used, such as chariots, altars, or statues. Two stage machines were utilized to great dramatic effect. The ﬁrst\n\nAncient Pantomime 13 was a low platform, the ekkyklema, upon which tableaus were exposed to reveal the results of the often violent acts that were committed offstage. The second was the crane used to ﬂy actors impersonating the Greek gods, making it possible to bring in a god to bring about a happy ending, whence the term deus ex machina, or “god from a machine.” See also Egypt References: Arnott, Peter D.

Originally from Sicily, mime developed as early as the ﬁfth or fourth century B.C. Plots for mime performances were short and often indecent stories or humorous burlesques taken from lower-class and urban life. Adultery was a popular subject. Mime was given its ﬁrst literary form by Decimus Laberius (106–43 B.C.); it was often performed during the intermission of more serious dramas. By the ﬁrst century B.C. mime was much more popular than masked dramas because Roman audiences liked to see the facial expressions of the performer and because it sketched ordinary life using current themes. In the later centuries of the Roman Empire, which lasted from 27 B.C to A.D. 476, mime reigned almost exclusively over the stage, and often it mocked the gods to the point of absurdity. With its overriding popularity, mime replaced the Atellana, a form of masked farce. The costume for mime performers was a motley dress of patched fabric with either no shoes or light sandals. Women found a rare opportunity to perform in mime, even though in the beginning\n\nit was conﬁned to male performers. Female mime artists who became famous include Cytheris, mistress of Mark Antony, who was known for her craft and artistry; and Theodora, ﬁrst mistress and then wife of the Byzantine emperor Justinian in the sixth century A.D. She was known for her sharp wit and shamelessness. On the day Caligula was murdered, the robber Laureolus was nailed to a cross in a mime performance and died before the eyes of the spectators. Also at this time female mime performers appeared topless on stage. Mime was the primary target of Christian teachers who were against what they considered degenerate forms of theater, because of the activities listed above and because Christian ceremonies and rites were sometimes ridiculed. Near the ﬁnal decline of the Empire, mime attempted to compete with the games in the amphitheater by appealing to the audience’s thirst for gore. References: Arnott, Peter D.

Pantomime developed partly from Mime, in which performers without masks dramatized short, usually humorous, skits, using only facial expressions, movement, and gestures. In pantomime solo actors performed a monologue or scene featuring Greek mythology from a Roman comedy or Roman tragedy. One actor performed many roles by changing masks while a chorus or one singer sang or spoke the story. Roman audiences grew tired of the endlessly repeated subjects of tragedy, but they still craved the art of acting, and pantomime was the form to satisfy that hunger. The form had great popular appeal in Rome, and the performers of it were nearly worshipped by their fans. Actors were handsome, well-built men whose movements\n\n14 Andreini, Isabella were expressive and ﬂowing. They used reﬁned gestures and were versatile enough to evoke a wide variety of moods and emotions. A good education and a knowledge of mythology were a must for performers. Graceful silk costumes that accented movement served as costumes for performers. The masks that were worn were similar to those worn in tragedy, except that those for pantomime had closed mouths. Pylades, who came to Rome from Greece in 20 B.C., introduced the tragic pantomime with stories taken from Greek mythology, and this type lived on through the rest of antiquity. In 22 B.C. Bathyllus introduced the comic pantomime, featuring such characters as Pan and Echo, or Satyr and Amor. This type did not last long. A chorus or solo performer in the background sang lyrics written by contemporary poets. These songs were usually a revamping of the words of the popular tragic scene that was being performed See also Livius Andronicus References: Beacham, Richard. The Roman Theatre and Its Audience.

Celebrated actress of the Gelosi company, she was considered to be the ﬁrst great professional actress of Western theater. As playwright, poet, and actress, she was honored in Italy and France by all social classes, including royalty. Her ﬁrst name became a stock character in the Innamorata category, since she created her own speciﬁc variation on the role. Isabella was highly regarded because of her talent and loveliness, even though before her eminence it was thought to be immoral and shameless for a woman to be in the theater. It was in the commedia that women assumed an important\n\nposition for the ﬁrst time in Western theater. When she died giving birth, the city of Lyon went into public mourning in her honor.

Ankai Nat is a beautiful synthesis of classical and folk theater traditions of the region. Lyrical plays, which describe the greatness of Krishna through episodes of his life, are written in the vernacular. Religious, social, and cultural community centers act as patrons for this form. They care for and train the performers. Each performance is viewed as an offering to Krishna. A performance begins with the Sutradhara, the narrator, entering wearing a white skirt and turban. He sings invocations while dancing. Then he introduces the story and the characters for the speciﬁc story being performed. Actors make dramatic entrances from behind a white curtain held by two people. When Krishna ﬁnally enters, the other performers shower him with ﬂowers. The Sutradhara stays on the stage commenting on the action throughout the show. Dancing and singing are stressed more than dialogue, and even the dialogue is delivered in a lyrical manner. Most action, including battle scenes, is choreographed as dance. The setting for performances is a rectangular prayer hall called a Namghar, which is attached to the area where images of the deities are kept in a temple. Actors perform facing a high pedestal, upon which are sacred Hindu texts. The outer walls of the hall are usually painted with different scenes of Krishna’s life. Krishna’s costume is a gold-embroidered velvet jacket.The actor portraying Krishna also wears a necklace of fragrant ﬂowers and carries a ﬂute in his hands. Some of the other characters are masked. Natural dyes from the area are used for makeup color. Color choice is symbolic of the\n\nApache Mountain Spirit Dance 15 inner nature of the dramatic character. For example, a demonic nature is indicated by black, brutality by red, and saintliness by white; light blue always indicates Krishna. References: Varadpande, Manohar Laxman. Krishna Theatre in India.

Antoine founded Théâtre Libre (Free Theater) in 1887, in opposition to what he saw as the shallowness of the Comédie Française and other respectable theaters of the time. He wrote a pamphlet, “The Théâtre Libre,” in 1890 that severely criticized the training of actors taught at the Conservatoire, the most prestigious training academy for actors in France, for the exaggerated enunciation and stock gestures they used. He wanted conversational tones in acting and genuine movements of the body in accord with the character’s desires and personality. He wanted his actors “to live” rather than “to act.” The core company of his Théâtre Libre consisted of amateur performers who by day worked as chemists, merchants, dressmakers, and so on. Still, these actors impressed the critics of their day with their arrestingly truthful acting, as brought out by Antoine. In 1906 he was appointed director of the Odéon Theatre. He produced the work of naturalist writers Emile Zola (1840–1902), Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910), August Strindberg (1849– 1912), and Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906). He developed a natural style of acting with his company, he and his actors drawing their inspiration from the essence of the play and real-life actions and reactions.

It is performed by four male dancers, dressed in elaborate headdresses and masks, and one clown. Headdresses extend over three feet high, fanning out in elaborate designs.

The purpose of the dance is to bring blessings or healing. Singers, drummers, and a presiding medicine man stand to one side of the designated dance area. A clown enters from the east, does funny bits, and then blesses each of the four cardinal directions while whirling a piece of wood on a thong to create the sound of the wind, which heralds the coming of the gaan. From the east again enter each of the four dancers, and they move around the central ﬁre in a snake-like formation. Their movements include lunges and twists that tip the headdresses back and forth. Then they suddenly stop and strike dramatic poses. During the dance the performers touch the person for whom the ceremony is being done, thereby throwing off that person’s sickness.\n\nema.

Arab theater also exists in non-Arab countries in which there is a sizable Arab minority, such as the Americas. The idea that there should be some indigenous style of theater that is uniquely expressive of the Arab people is only about a hundred years old. The birth of modern Arab theater was in 1848 in Syria, but it soon shifted to Egypt, where the best playwrights and actors immigrated in search of better conditions and a more tolerant political climate. Actors were amateurs, freely moving from one troupe to another. The most valued actors were those who could sing well, because the musical element in theater was predominant. Actresses began to appear on stage at the turn of the century where they were once restricted, but these women were, as a rule, Jews or Christians. It was not until World War I that Muslim women, some of whom came from good families, began appearing on stage to promote the emancipation of Muslim women. Egyptian theater troupes began touring throughout other Arabic-speaking lands in the nineteenth century, which did much to encourage and inﬂuence Arab Theater in those countries.

It is signiﬁcantly different from the Turkish Karagoz, another form of shadow puppet theater, in that in the Egyptian form there are no permanent characters and the plays and puppets are different. Performing in rowdy coffeehouses to uneducated villagers and children, the Muqaddam, or puppet master, performs written scripts using rawhide puppets to project shadows on a white screen so that only the shadows are visible to the audience. The dominant comedy in these plays is created by puns and obscenity. As the Muqaddam cannot move all the puppets himself, he often hires his students to be his assistants and even gives them scripts so that they can perform the lines for some of the lesser characters. On a simple stage white linen is hung up and a strong light set behind. Puppets are made of brightly painted transparent rawhide. They are 20–28 inches high with articulated limbs manipulated by long sticks attached to the ends. Extra\n\nholes are punched into the chest and stomach of puppets to bypass Islam’s opposition to representations of the human form. Puppet masters argue that these holes ensure the puppet’s lifelessness. Muhammad ibn Daniyal (1248–1311) wrote the ﬁrst plays known for this form; many playwrights followed him.The plays are often written in verse, so students generally adhere to the script when performing, since it is very difficult to improvise in verse. Only the experienced masters can improvise more into written texts. Texts performed in a crude sort of spoken Arabic are sung or spoken quite loudly to compete with the talking in the cafe.Three or four musicians playing tambourines, oboe, and drum, accompany the performance. Traditionally novices develop their skills under the supervision of a trained master. Novices not only learn how to manipulate puppets, recite, and sing from teachers, but also write down their versions of stories. In the twentieth century shadow puppet theaters were closed, but some performances in Cairo and Alexandria continue.

Attractive young women portray most roles. In Java the communication of the stories occurs through song and dance. The actors almost never speak. The stories have quickly moving plots that are drawn from romantic stories about lovers in Javanese legends from the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Stories are also drawn from the Panji tales, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana. In Bali this is the only form of theater in which a front curtain is used. Performances do not begin until midnight and continue into the early morning hours. Highly refined characters speak and sing in Kawi, the ancient Javanese language, which is translated into common Balinese by the clown characters, not without the clowns adding their own criticism and puns. There is an abundance of physical humor and verbal word play. References: Bandem, I Made. “Notes on the Development of the Arja Dance Drama.” Indonesia Circle 3 (March 1983): 28–32; Brandon, James.

In fact there was a great variety of peoples and tribes occupying the territory of present Argentina. Some of the main groups are the Diaguitas, Timbúes, Caingúas, Mocoretas, Charrúas and Agaces, many of which have now completely disappeared. Immigration from Europe starting in the mid-nineteenth century increased the population of Argentina dramatically, also causing the culture to be highly Eurocentric. The Argentine theater was for years the most hospitable and fruitful in South America, marred for a time by the oppressive dictatorship of Juan Domingo Perón, 1944–1955. Since Argentina came under Spanish rule in 1536, Spanish colonial theater of many forms was present, both secular elite forms and religious dramas. One of the ﬁrst known theatrical traditions native to Argentina and Uruguay was the Teatro Gaucho, highly popular at the end of the nineteenth century. Staged in circus arenas, complete with stampeding horses and elaborate ﬁght scenes, these plays brought to life the popular cowboy of South America, the gaucho. In 1910 a law was passed that gave a large portion of all royalties to playwrights. As a result many gifted writers were attracted to the theater, and often they doubled as managers. Leonidas Barletta, an author-manager of the early twentieth century, began the Teatro del Pueblo, a theater dedicated to offering quality entertainment to the working class at an affordable price. Also of the early and mid-twentieth century, the famous actress Lola Membrives reigned as Argentina’s leading star. Argentinean Jewish theater also flourished from 1900 to the 1940s. When the spark in Argentina’s theater began to dim in the 1940s, the baton was handed on to\n\nAristophanes 19 Chile, which was just beginning to foster a vigorous theater life. Decades of military regimes since Perón were hard on the arts, since any “leftist” expression was sternly censored. The remnants of the highly developed professional theater artists turned to producing highly metaphorical or allegorical scripted works that were critical of the government but adequately veiled to escape censorship. As political and social stability continues to increase in Argentina, the forecast for theater is improving. References: Barnard, Tim. Argentine Cinema.

One of the earliest ﬂowerings of Jewish culture in Argentina was the Yiddish theater, most popular 1900–1930, ﬁrst presented by foreign companies. Ironically, these tours were ﬁnanced by pimps trafficking Jewish women from Eastern Europe to Argentina for prostitution, strengthening the age-old association between prostitution and the theater. Foreign visits of prestigious European actors during this time fueled the excitement for local Yiddish theater to be produced by amateur actors and directors in the Jewish community. Popular Jewish theater began in Argentina in 1932 with a group initially named Prolet Bine (Proletarian Stage), who later changed their name to Idisches Folks Theater. Famous actors of this time include Berta and Pauline Singerman, Cipe Lincovsky, and Fanny Brener, many of whom moved from the theater to the cinema. By the 1930s Jew-\n\nish dramatists began writing in Spanish instead of Yiddish. After the 1940s Argentinean Jewish theater artists became part of their country’s mainstream, in their attempt to represent Jewish culture with eloquence to a largely anti-Semitic society.

Greece Popular ancient Greek comic playwright; only creator of Old Comedy whose works survive. Aristophanes was a master at mixing sophisticated wordplay with unsophisticated physical comedy. Highly satirical regarding political matters, he often focused his plays on an antiwar theme, ridiculing the pettiness of those who waged war. For most of his writing career Athens was at war with Sparta, its rival city-state. As a champion of the peace party, he tried to inﬂuence Athens to make peace, but the peace he so yearned for came too late; democracy had already fallen by the time the war was over. Aristophanes’ work was very inﬂuential in the development of Western comedy. In his last surviving play he almost completely does away with the Greek chorus, giving the play a distinctively modern feel. Many of the indecent jokes centered on the large phallus attached to the padded costumes worn by male characters. It is believed that in Aristophanes’ plays actors parodied famous characters wearing masks that were recognizable to the audience. Socrates, the great Greek philosopher satirized in The Clouds, is said to have stood up in the audience at a performance to allow the rest of the audience to see his resemblance to the masked actor portraying him. Aristophanes is believed to have written thirty plays, but only eleven survive, of which Lysistrata, written in 411, is the most famous. In Lysistrata the women go on a sex–strike, refusing to have sex with their husbands until peace is made with Sparta. His plays often took their name from the chorus, as in The Knights, The Wasps, and The Frogs. The public found his work amusing, but the leading people in society, whom he lampooned, never granted him the honorary status in society they bestowed upon the tragic poets. Indeed,\n\n20 Aristotle comic poets in general did not enjoy a high status in society. See also Greek Comedy References: Arnott, Peter D. The Ancient Greek and Roman Theatre.

Partnered with Brighella, Arlecchino and his mental shortcomings usually complicated the clever scheming of Brighella. Originally the role of Arlecchino was a peasant boy. He was usually the servant to Pantalone, the duped father or husband, Capitano, the Spanish braggart, or Dottore, the pedantic old scholar. Constantly in his hand, even when he was turning a somersault, was his Batocchino, known in English as a slapstick, made of two thin pieces of wood kept apart at the handle that when slapped together create a loud sound, whence the term slapstick comedy. Arlecchino had a slow mind but a quick and agile body. Plots were often complicated because of his misunderstandings in carrying out an order. His vocal delivery was coarse and guttural. His costume was made of colorful diamondshaped patchwork with a small black hat and a half mask made of black leather. The actors Tris-\n\ntano Martinelli (1557–1630) and Evaristo Gherardi (1663–1701) were largely responsible for creating this role.

Artaud was an idealist and an extremist who created a dissatisfaction with artiﬁce, mediocrity, and complacency in the theatrical experience. His many revolutionary essays on theater were collected in Le Théâtre et son Double (The Theatre and its Double) (1938). He began as an actor of the stage and screen, appearing in the ﬁlm Passion de Jeanne d’ Arc (The Passion of Joan of Arc) in 1922. In 1927 he founded the Théâtre Alfred Jarry to achieve the liberty he witnessed in other artistic mediums such as music and painting. For the most part, he chose surrealist dramas to produce there. Artaud was hugely inspired by the playwright, Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), especially his blasphemous comedy Ubu Roi. That play represented for Artaud the culmination of the forces that he hoped would bring about the end of the theater as it existed in France at that time. In 1931 Artaud witnessed a performance of dance from Bali, which greatly expanded his idea of what theater was capable of; he saw it as providing a trance-inducing initiation into an experience in which the elemental and essential nature of humankind could be explored. He often used terms of violence to describe these states, words such as crime, rape, cannibalism, and savage, but he seemed to be aiming at a sort of utopia of a theater in which primal urges were satisﬁed and fed. In this “theater of cruelty” he described the actor as an athlete of the heart who metaphorically raped the audience out of their apathy. Many prominent theater artists have been inﬂuenced by and have experimented with Artaud’s\n\nAustralia 21 theories, individuals such as Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, and Richard Schechner, and groups such as the Living Theater and the Open Theater.

Atellanae were originally improvised, but as these plays grew in popularity scripts were written. In 89 B.C. the genre was given literary form in Latin. The speech, style of humor, and costumes were all rustic, since scenes were set in small farm towns or villages. After the demise of the Roman Republic, during the empire that followed (27 B.C.–A.D. 476), Atellanae became more popular than full-length tragedies and comedies based on the Greek model. A predecessor to the later Italian commedia dell’ arte, the Atellana was based on stock characters— Pappus the grandfather, Maccus and Bucco the fools, and Manducus the greedy ogre. Since the actors wore masks, they sometimes dared to criticize those who took part in public affairs and even the emperor, which proved to be dangerous, since an actor who criticized Nero was banished\n\nfor life. Another actor who attacked Caligula, a Roman emperor who lived from 12 to 41 A.D., was burned to death in an amphitheater. References: Bieber, Margarete. The History of the Greek and Roman Theater.

The original inhabitants, now known as the aborigines, are believed to have arrived from Southeast Asia as much as 40,000 years ago. Aside from possible interaction with the people of New Guinea, the aborigine culture evolved in complete isolation until the ﬁrst European explorers were sighted in the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century the Dutch named this mammoth “discovery” New Holland, and in 1770 Captain James Cook explored Australia and later clamed it for Great Britain. Great Britain used Australia primarily as a penal colony until the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century. As British colonists settled in new areas, the aboriginal populations were displaced and sometimes exterminated. Since 1901 Australia has been a Commonwealth country of Great Britain. Other than the Australian aboriginal dancedramas, theater did not exist in Australia until European-style theater began in Sydney in 1833; it was a welcome diversion from horse racing, cockﬁghts, and other forms of gambling. Other colonial towns followed suit, presenting commercially viable popular entertainment. Theater managers would try a variety of combinations for an evening’s bill to please an audience. Often a program included one play in its entirety and the best-loved scenes of another. Local theater companies and an occasional touring company from Britain performed in the many theaters started by entrepreneurs, who built theater chains. The star system was in full force in Australia in the nineteenth century. Leading male and female actors were promoted more than the plays, and they dominated the company, choosing plays that would best show off their talents. These stars even commissioned the writing of plays to highlight themselves. In a specially tailored melodrama, All\n\n22 Australian Aboriginal Theater for Gold, Alfred Dampier and his two daughters, Lily and Rose, performed to tearful audiences until the girls were too old to carry off the parts. It was hardly a privileged minority that attended the theater."
