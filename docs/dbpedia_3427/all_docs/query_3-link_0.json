They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 8\n\nBasset Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nHenry Basset, who landed in Barbados in 1663 2\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Basset (post 1700) +\n\nRené Basset (1919-2021), French photographer who received the Niépce Prize in 1958\n\nAnne Charles Basset de Montaigu, French Divisional General during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1789 to 1815 9\n\nFrancis Basset (1715-1769), Cornish landowner and politician\n\nSarah Basset (d. 1730), slave and alleged witch in the British colony Bermuda in the West Indies\n\nFrances Basset (1781-1855), 2nd Baroness Basset, British peeress\n\nFrancis Basset FRS (1757-1835), 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset, an English nobleman and politician\n\nJohn Basset (1791-1843), English writer on Cornish mining\n\nDelfin Carbonell Basset (b. 1938), contemporary lexicographer\n\nBasset Maguire, American Botanist\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nhttp://www.journaldesfemmes.com/nom-de-famille/nom/\n\nFilby, P.
