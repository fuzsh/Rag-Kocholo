Nureyev’s fi nest daughter both on the racecourse and in the paddocks was the mighty Miesque. She produced the outstanding sire Kingmambo and the family has been carefully nurtured over the years by Stavros’s daughter Maria and granddaughter Electra. Recent Group 1-winning sisters Alpha Centauri, Alpine Star and Discoveries have Miesque as their third dam. The Niarchos family was recently honoured with the 2021 Longines and IFHA International award of merit for their lifelong contribution to racing. Peter Brant, White Birch Farm Peter Brant was the breeder of Michael Tabor’s Kentucky Derby winner Thunder Gulch and also bred and raced both his sire Gulch and dam Line of Thunder. He also owned the brilliant Triptych and was responsible for bringing legendary stallion Mr. Prospector to Claiborne Farm having begun his stud career in Florida. More recently he raced Sottsass and is now supporting him with a large number of top-notch mares. Brant is an accomplished polo player and was at one time the highest-ranked amateur player in the U.S.\n\nMaria Niarchos and Stavros Niarchos , pictured at the 1986 Epsom Derby\n\nPeter Brant , pictured with Michel Zerolo of Oceanic Bloodstock , yearling purchaser of Sottsass\n\n10\n\nThe Wertheimer Brothers The Wertheimer family have been breeding champions ever since Epinard was Champion 2-Year-Old in France back in 1922. Another homebred Lavandin won the Epsom Derby in 1956 and the family has been responsible for the development of a number of top stallions including Lyphard, Riverman and Green Dancer. More recent stars to grace the turf in the famous blue and white silks include the triple Breeders’ Cup Mile heroine Goldikova. The Yoshida Family The foundation of the Yoshida empire was laid by their grandfather, Zensuke, who ran a horse in the fi rst Japanese Derby, in 1932. His son, Zenya, added signi fi cantly to the legacy with his bargain-price purchase of the great American champion Sunday Silence in 1990. Zenya, who died in 1993, did not get to see Sunday Silence become the greatest stallion in Japanese history. His sons achieved that by embarking on a two-decade spending spree for the fi nest broodmares to breed to him and then to his sons. Sunday Silence’s son Deep Impact has been champion sire in Japan every year since 2012 and is sire of our own Saxon Warrior. Most recently, Northern Farm bred Japan’s two 2021 Breeders’ Cup winners - the fi rst in the country’s history. The Sangster Family The Sangster Family’s association with the Magnier family dates back to the early 1970s in the days of Green God and Deep Diver. When Castlehyde joined forces with Coolmore along with Vincent O’Brien and Robert Sangster in 1975, a major assault on the American yearling market was planned. Success was immediate with $200,000 purchase The Minstrel winning the Epsom Derby. In the 1980s, both Sadler’s Wells and Caerleon carried the famous Sangster colours before embarking on their hugely successful stud careers at Coolmore. In the latest season Luxembourg, bred by Ben Sangster, displayed his in fi nite potential on the racecourse while his yearling full-brother was the top-priced colt at Goffs realising €1.2 million.\n\nAlain and Gérard Wertheimer\n\nShunsuke Yoshida and father Katsumi Yoshida of Northern Farm who owned Deep Impact with Shadai Farm\n\nLucy and Ben Sangster\n\n11\n\n29/09/21\n\n“He’s the star of the show.
