He was introduced at court and became a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. Known for his wit and womanising, Raleigh was in and out of Elizabeth's favour. (According to a famous legend he once laid his plush and expensive cloak over a puddle so that the Queen's feet would not be dirtied; the legend has long been disputed, but might actually be true.) He organised expeditions to the new world, popularised tobacco, and wrote poetry. Raleigh was not a favourite of Elizabeth's successor, James I, who imprisoned him in the Tower of London and finally had him beheaded in 1618. A print copy of the history is held at the University of Michigan Library and an electronic copy may be accessed at: Google Books. Google has sponsored the digitisation of books from several major libraries. These books, on which copyright has expired are available for free educational and research use, both as individual books and as full collections to aid researchers."
