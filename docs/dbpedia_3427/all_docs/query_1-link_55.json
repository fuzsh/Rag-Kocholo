Einhard's Annales record that \"Brittaniæ Wihomarcus\" rebelled in 825 . The Gesta Francorum records that \"Wihomarcus, Brito\" treacherously made peace with the Vikings in 825 and was surrounded in his own home and killed by the men of Comte Lambert .\n\n1.MURMANUS, son of --- (-837). Regino records the death in 837 of \"Murmanus rex Brittonum\" .\n\nTwo possible siblings, parents untraced:\n\n1.NOMINOË (-[8 Jun/22 Aug] 851, bur Redon). Emperor Louis I \"le Pieux\" installed him as missus imperatoris in Brittania (sole ruler) in [831]. Duke of Brittany. Emperor Louis I confirmed the donation of \"fideli nostri Nominoë\" to the monastery \"Rotonensi S. Salvatoris in pago Broweroch\" by charter dated 834 . His forces defeated the Frankish army of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks at Redon 22 Nov 845, following their attack in retaliation for the murder of Renaud Comte de Nantes by Erispoë, Nominoë's son. The two sides made peace in 846 . The Chronicle of Adémar de Chabannes records that \"Nomenoius dux\" captured and destroyed \"Redonas civitatem et Nannetis\" before returning to Brittany, the event being dated from the context to the early 850s . \"Nominoio tyranno Britonum\" fought \"Lambertus comes et Warnarius frater eius\" in 850, and died \"851 indictione 14\" . The Annales Bertiniani record the death in 851 of \"Nomenogius Britto\" . The Annals of St Salvator Redon record that \"Nominoius princeps cum Erispoe filio\" were buried at the abbey of Redon . m ---. The name of Nominoë's wife is not known.

The Chronica Fontanellensis names \"Respogio filio Nomenoi, tyranno Brittonum\" . The Chronica Rainaldi records that \"Rainaldo comite Nannetensium\" was killed in 843 while fighting \"Herispoium, Noremoi filium at alios Britannos apud Metiacum\" . \"Erispoius provinciæ Brittaniæ princeps\" names \"genitoris mei Nominoe consobrini mei Salomonis filiique mei Conan episcoporumque\" in a charter dated 19 May [851/57] . He succeeded his father in 851 as Duke of Brittany. Although \"Respogius filius Nomenogii\" swore allegiance to Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks, he defeated the king's army at Jengland, on the river Vilaine, and was ceded Rennes, Nantes and the pays de Retz , although peace was agreed and confirmed by the betrothal of Erispoë's daughter to the king's son. The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Respogius dux Brittonum\" was killed in 857 by \"Salamone et Almaro Brittonibus\" . The Chronica Rainaldi records that \"Herispoius rex tyrannicus Britonum\" was killed in 857 by \"Salomone\" [his cousin] . m MARMOHEC, daughter of --- (-[856/57]). The Chronicle of Nantes records a donation by \"Herispogii\" for the soul of \"Marmohec coniugis nostræ\" dated 857 , which suggests that she was then deceased. No indication has been found that Marmohec was the mother of Erispoë's children who are shown below. Erispoë & [his wife] had three children:\n\ni) daughter . The Annales Bertiniani record the betrothal of \"Respogio Brittone filiam eius\" and \"Karlus rex filio suo Ludoico\" in early 856 . It is likely that the oldest daughter of Erispoë was betrothed to the Carolingian prince. It is not known whether this was the same person as his unnamed daughter who later married Gurwent (see below). Betrothed (Feb 856, contract broken end 857) to LOUIS, son of CHARLES II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks & his first wife Ermentrudis [d'Orléans] (1 Nov 846-Compiègne 10 Apr 879, bur Compiègne, église collégiale Saint-Corneille). His father awarded him the duchy of Mans and part of Neustria and arranged his betrothal in Feb 856, from which time he seems to have received the title king. He was expelled from Brittany after the rebellion which followed the murder of King Erispoë, and sought refuge with his father . He succeeded his father in 877 as LOUIS II \"le Bègue\" King of the West Franks.\n\nii) daughter . Her parentage is deduced from the Annales Mettenses which names \"Judicheil ex filia Heriospoii regis natus\" when recording that he ruled jointly with \"Alanus frater Pasquitani\" . Her marriage date is suggested on the assumption that she was the same daughter of Erispoe who was earlier betrothed to Louis, son of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks (see above), but this is not certain. m ([after 857]) GURWENT [Gurvand], son of --- (-877). Regino records that \"Pasquitano et Vurfando\" killed \"Salomon rex Brittonum\" in 874, specifying that they divided the kingdom between them although Pascwethen received the larger share . They were deposed in 876 and succeeded by Judicaël, Gurwent's son, and Alain Comte de Vannes who was Pascwethen's brother .\n\niii)CONAN (-after 857). \"Erispoius provinciæ Brittaniæ princeps\" names \"genitoris mei Nominoe consobrini mei Salomonis filiique mei Conan episcoporumque\" in a charter dated 19 May [851/57] . The Chronicle of Nantes records a donation by \"Herispogii\" for the soul of \"Marmohec coniugis nostræ\" dated 857 subscribed by \"Konani \", signing first in the list of subscriptions but without any indication of his relationship to the donor .\n\nb)PASTHENETEN .

The Chronicle of Nantes names \"Salomon nepos Nomenoii\" when recording that he murdered \"Herispogium regem cognatum suum\" . The Historia Brittania Armorica names \"Salomon nepos Nomenoii\" . The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Salomon Britto\" submitted to Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks and was granted a third of Brittany in 852 . Regino records the accession of \"Salomon dux\" on the death of \"Herispoius rex Brittonum\" . He murdered [his cousin] Duke Erispoe and succeeded in Nov 857 as Duke of Brittany. \"Salomon Brittania princeps\" donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 6 Mar 863 . Another charter dated [874] names \"Salomoni Brittanie duci\" . An opponent of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks, in 863 Salomon eventually swore allegiance to the king who granted him the land between the Mayenne and Sarthe rivers. However, he rebelled and defeated King Charles at Brissarthe in 866 helped by Viking allies, but was granted the county of Coutances (Cotentin and Avranchin) under the peace agreed subsequently. He styled himself king in charters . The Annales Bertiniani record the death in 874 of \"Salomon dux Brittonum\" . Regino records that \"Salomon rex Brittonum\" was killed by \"Pasquitano et Vurfando\", specifying that they thereupon divided the kingdom between them although Pascwethen received the larger share . The Chronica Rainaldi records that \"Salomon rex Britonum\" was killed \"874 IV Kal Jul\" by his followers . The Chronicle of Nantes records that \"Salomon rex Britanniæ\" was killed \"a Britannis suis\" . m GUENEBRET, daughter of ---. Pope Nicholas I addressed a letter to \"Salomone Britannorum rege eiusque conjuge Gyenebret\" dated \"7 Kal Jun Indictione XIII\" . No indication has been found that Guenebret was the mother of Salomon's children who are shown below. Duke Salomon & [his wife] had four children:\n\ni)PROSTLON (-before 8 Jan 876) . Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by the Annales Bertiniani which name \"Paswithen gener Salamonis\" when recording that he negotiated peace with Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks at Compiègne in early Aug 867 . \"Pacuueten princeps\" donated property to the abbey of Redon \"post mortem uxoris sue Prostlon\" by charter dated 8 Jan 876 . m PASCWETHEN [Pasquitan] Comte de Vannes, son of ---.\n\nii)RIVALLON (-after 17 Apr 869, maybe before 10 Feb 872). The Annals of St Salvator Redon name \"Rivallone filio Salamonis, Wincone fratre eius\" citing a donation of 868 . \"Salomon totius Britanniæ magneque parties Galliarum princeps\" donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 17 Apr 869, naming \"antecessores nostri Nominoe videlicet Erispoe\", witnessed by \"Riuuallon et Guegon filii supradicti Salamonis\" . \" Riuuelen comes, Pascuethen comes, Bran comes Jedecael princeps Poucher Moruuethen comes Riuallon et Guigon filii Salomonis \" witnessed the charter dated 9 Jul 871 relating to a dispute involving the abbey of Redon . If it is correct (as suggested below) that \"Vuicon filius Riuuilin\", who subscribed the charter dated 10 Feb 872 was the son of Duke Salamon's son Rivallon, the absence of Rivallon's name from the list of subscribers suggests that he may have died before that date. m ---. The name of Rivallon's wife is not known. Rivallon & his [wife] had [one possible child]:\n\n(a) [GUEGON [Wincon] (-after 10 Feb 872). \"Salomon rex Britannie\" donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 10 Feb 872, witnessed by \"Salamon rex Vuicon filius eius, Bran, Vuruuant, Vuicon filius Riuuilin \" . It is not certain Rivallon, father of the second named \"Vuicon\", was the same person as the grandson of Duke Salomon but this is a possibility.]\n\niii)GUEGON [Wincon] (-after 10 Feb 872). The Annals of St Salvator Redon name \"Rivallone filio Salamonis, Wincone fratre eius\" citing a donation of 868 . \"Salomon totius Britanniæ magneque parties Galliarum princeps\" donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 17 Apr 869, naming \"antecessores nostri Nominoe videlicet Erispoe\", witnessed by \"Riuuallon et Guegon filii supradicti Salamonis\" . \" Riuuelen comes, Pascuethen comes, Bran comes Jedecael princeps Poucher Moruuethen comes Riuallon et Guigon filii Salomonis \" witnessed the charter dated 9 Jul 871 relating to a dispute involving the abbey of Redon . \"Salomon rex Britannie\" donated property to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 10 Feb 872, witnessed by \"Salamon rex Vuicon filius eius, Bran, Vuruuant, Vuicon filius Riuuilin \" .\n\niv)ALBIGEON (-bur Redon).

Regino records that \"Pasquitano et Vurfando\" killed \"Salomon rex Brittonum\" in 874, specifying that they divided the kingdom between them although Pascwethen received the larger share . Duke of Brittany. They were deposed in 876 and succeeded by Judicaël, Gurwent's son, and Alain Comte de Vannes who was Pascwethen's brother . m ([after 857]) --- of Brittany, daughter of ERISPOË Duke of Brittany & his wife [Marmohec ---]. Her parentage is deduced from the Annales Mettenses which names \"Judicheil ex filia Heriospoii regis natus\" when recording that he ruled jointly with \"Alanus frater Pasquitani\" . Her marriage date is suggested on the assumption that she was the same daughter of Erispoe who was earlier betrothed to Louis, son of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks (see above), but this is not certain. Gurwent & his wife had [two] children:\n\na)JUDICAËL (-killed in battle [1 Aug/8 Nov] 888) . Comte [de Rennes]. Regino records that \"Iudicheil, ex filia Herispoii regis natus\" ruled Brittany jointly with \"Alanus frater Pasquitani\" after the death of Pascwethen in 876, and his death in battle against the Vikings . He succeeded his father in 876 as joint Duke of Brittany, ruling jointly with Alain Comte de Vannes. Regino records disputes between \"Alanum et Iudicheil duces Brittonium\" in 890 , which indicates that the date of his death recorded in the previous passage in the same source may not be accurate.\n\nb) [daughter . The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified. Borderie suggests that Judicael Comte de Rennes was the grandson of Duke Gurwent, but he does not cite any primary source which supports his reasoning . m BERENGER Comte, son of ---. 889/before 931.]\n\n[Three] siblings, parents not known:\n\n1.PASCWETHEN [Pasquitan] (-[876]) . Comte de Vannes. \"Pascuueten\" donated property \"de sua hereditate in Bene, quæ dicitur Rancaruuan\" to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 17 Jun 862 . \"Pascuueten comes provintie Brouueroch\" witnessed a charter dated 22 May 865 . The Annales Bertiniani name \"Paswithen gener Salamonis\" when recording that he negotiated peace with Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks at Compiègne in early Aug 867 . \" Riuuelen comes, Pascuethen comes, Bran comes Jedecael princeps Poucher Moruuethen comes Riuallon et Guigon filii Salomonis \" witnessed the charter dated 9 Jul 871 relating to a dispute involving the abbey of Redon . Regino records that \"Pasquitano et Vurfando\" killed \"Salomon rex Brittonum\" in 874, specifying that they divided the kingdom between them although Pascwethen received the larger share . He succeeded his father-in-law in 874 as joint Duke of Brittany, ruling jointly with Gurwent, son-in-law of Erispoë. He sought Viking help against his co-ruler, but they were both deposed in 876 and succeeded by Pascwethen's brother Alain Comte de Vannes and Judicaël, Gurwent's son . m PROSTLON, daughter of SALOMON Duke of Brittany & his wife [Guenebret] --- (-before 8 Jan 876). \"Pacuueten princeps\" donated property to the abbey of Redon \"post mortem uxoris sue Prostlon\" by charter dated 8 Jan 876 . Her parentage and marriage is confirmed by the Annales Bertiniani which name \"Paswithen gener Salamonis\" when recording that he negotiated peace with Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks at Compiègne in early Aug 867 .\n\n2.ALAIN (-907) . Regino records that \"Alanus frater Pasquitani\" succeeded his brother, jointly with \"Iudicheil, ex filia Herispoii regis natus\" . The Annales Mettenses names \"Judicheil ex filia Heriospoii regis natus\" when recording that he ruled jointly with \"Alanus frater Pasquitani\" . He succeeded his brother in [876] as ALAIN I \"le Grand\" joint Duke of Brittany, ruling jointly with Judicaël son of Duke Gurwent. Regino records disputes between \"Alanum et Iudicheil duces Brittonium\" in 890 and, in an earlier passage, that Duke Alain ruled solely after Judicaël died fighting the Vikings . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the Bretons defeated the Vikings at St Lo in 890 and \"drove them into a river and drowned many\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks granted \"terram maritimam ab Eptæ flumine usque ad Britannicos limites\" together with \"sua filia...Gisla\" to Rollo who renounced his campaigns, that the king added \"tota Britannia\" and that ipsius provinciæ principibus Berengerio atque Alanno swore allegiance to Rollo . The chronology of this passage appears incompatible with the death of Alain in 907. It appears that, after the death of Alain, power in Brittany was shared between the counts of Poher (Alain´s son-in-law), Vannes (Alain´s possible eldest son) and Cornouaïlle, and that none of them was acknowledged as overall ruler. It is likely that this situation persisted until the Viking invasion in 919 as no reference has been found to any overall Breton duke during that time in any of the primary sources so far consulted in the preparation of the present document. m [firstly] OREGUEN, daughter of ---. \"Alanus rex Brittaniæ\" donated property \"abbatial sancti Sergii in pago Andecavensi\" to \"Raino Andacavensis episcopus\" to \"episcopo Adalaldo archiepiscopo simulque Rainoni episcopo, fratri eiusdem\" by charter dated [5 Feb 897/26 Nov 903], subscribed by \"Orgaim uxoris suæ Vuereche filii Alani, Pascuiten fratris sui\" . [m secondly as her first husband, ---. \"Tanchi comes cum filiolum suum Derian, filium Alani\" shared property which they donated to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 27 Nov 910, \"Gurmahilon regnante Britanniam\" . This charter indicates that Tanguy was closely related to the family of Duke Alain. The use of the word \"filiolus\" suggests that Derien may have been Tanguy´s stepson. As Duke Alain´s other known children were adult by the late 9th century as shown by the various documents in which they are named, it is unlikely that their mother would have remarried after her husband´s death. The most likely explanation therefore is that Alain remarried after the death of his wife Oreguen, had a son by this second marriage, and that his widow married secondly Tanguy after her first husband died. This would explain the joint holding of property in which the other sons of Duke Alain are not stated to have held any interest.] Duke Alain I & his [first] wife had [six] children:\n\na) [RODALD (-after 30 Nov 909). The Chronicle of Nantes quotes a charter, dated to after 5 Feb 897, under which \"Alanus rex, summus Britonnum dux conjugis nostræ Ohurguen ac communis prolis\" donated property, signed by \"Rodaldi, Guerech, Pascultani, Budici\" . The charter does not specify the relationship between the donor and the four witnesses. However, other documents quoted below show that Guerec and Pascwethen were Alain´s sons. It therefore appears likely that Rodald and Budic were also his children. If this is correct, Rodald was presumably the oldest child as he is named first. The dating clause of a charter dated 30 Nov 909 refers to \"Rudalt comite post mortem patri sui\", referring to the county of Vannes . Comte de Vannes. It appears that, after the death of Alain, power in Brittany was shared between the counts of Poher (Alain´s son-in-law), Vannes (Alain´s possible eldest son) and Cornouaïlle and that none of these was acknowledged as overall ruler.]\n\nb)GUEREC [Werec/Vuerech] (-after [5 Feb 897/26 Nov 903]). \"Alanus rex Brittaniæ\" donated property \"abbatial sancti Sergii in pago Andecavensi\" to \"Raino Andacavensis episcopus\" to \"episcopo Adalaldo archiepiscopo simulque Rainoni episcopo, fratri eiusdem\" by charter dated [5 Feb 897/26 Nov 903], subscribed by \"Orgaim uxoris suæ Vuereche filii Alani, Pascuiten fratris sui\" . The Chronicle of Nantes quotes a charter, dated to after 5 Feb 897, under which \"Alanus rex, summus Britonnum dux conjugis nostræ Ohurguen ac communis prolis\" donated property, signed by \"Rodaldi, Guerech, Pascultani, Budici\" .\n\nc)PASCWETHEN (-after [5 Feb 897/26 Nov 903]). \"Alanus rex Brittaniæ\" donated property \"abbatial sancti Sergii in pago Andecavensi\" to \"Raino Andacavensis episcopus\" to \"episcopo Adalaldo archiepiscopo simulque Rainoni episcopo, fratri eiusdem\" by charter dated [5 Feb 897/26 Nov 903], subscribed by \"Orgaim uxoris suæ Vuereche filii Alani, Pascuiten fratris sui\". The Chronicle of Nantes quotes a charter, dated to after 5 Feb 897, under which \"Alanus rex, summus Britonnum dux conjugis nostræ Ohurguen ac communis prolis\" donated property, signed by \"Rodaldi, Guerech, Pascultani, Budici\" .\n\nd) [BUDIC (-after 5 Feb 897). \"Alan dux, filius eius Uueroc, Paxuueten, Budic \" witnessed a charter dated 15 Jan 895 which records that \"Keuric filiam\" joined the monks at Redon . The Chronicle of Nantes quotes a charter, dated to after 5 Feb 897, under which \"Alanus rex, summus Britonnum dux conjugis nostræ Ohurguen ac communis prolis\" donated property, signed by \"Rodaldi, Guerech, Pascultani, Budici\" . The charter does not specify the relationship between the donor and the four witnesses. However, other documents quoted above show that Guerec and Pascwethen were Alain´s sons. It therefore appears likely that Rodald and Budic were also his children. If this is correct, Budic was presumably the youngest of the named children as he is named last.]\n\ne) daughter . The Chronicle of Nantes records that the mother of \"filium suum [Mathuedoi] Alanum\" was \"filia Alani Magni Britonum ducis\" . m MATHEDOI [Matuedo] Comte de Poher, son of --- (-936) .\n\nAlain & his [second] wife had one child:\n\nf) [DERIEN (-after 27 Nov 910). \"Tanchi comes cum filiolum suum Derian, filium Alani\" shared property which they donated to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 27 Nov 910, \"Gurmahilon regnante Britanniam\" . It is not certain from this text that Derien was the son of Alain I Duke of Brittany, but it is a possibility.]\n\n3. [--- . Assuming that nepos in the source quoted below can be translated as nephew, one of Euens parents was the sibling of Alain I Duke of Brittany. This is only one possible explanation of the family relationship considering the flexibility with which nepos was used. m ---.] One child:\n\na)EUEN . \"Matuedoi comes\" confirmed a donation of property \"quod rex Alanus antea atque Euuen nepos eius Sancte Mariæ Bilique episcopo in monacho sempiterno dederat\" to the abbey of Redon by charter dated 25 Oct 913 . same person as ? EUEN . \"Comes Euuenus\" donated property to Landevenec by undated charter, dated to the mid-10th century . \"Euuenus comes qui dictus est Magnus\" donated property to Landevenec by charter dated 10 Apr 955 . An undated charter, dated to [945/52], records the death and burial of \"Budic comes\", witnessed by \"Alan dux Britanniæ Benedictus episcopus filius istius Budic Euhuarn vicecomes \" .\n\nB. DUKES of BRITTANY 938-952 (FAMILY of COMTES de POHER)\n\nALAIN de Poher, son of MATHEDOI [Matuedo] Comte de Poher & his wife --- de Bretagne (in Brittany [before 919]-952, bur Church of St Donatian and St Rogatian) . His parentage is confirmed by the Chronicle of Nantes which records that \"Mathuedoi comes de Poher\" fled \"ad regem Anglorum Adelstanum\" with \"filium suum Alanum\" . Taken to England by his father, he was baptised there, with Æthelstan King of Wessex acting as his godfather. As King Æthelstan succeeded to the throne in 924, it is likely that this baptism took place when Alain was already past infancy. It is probable that Alain was not younger than 15 years old, at the youngest, when he took part in the 931 uprising against the Danes in Brittany. If this is correct, he must have been born several years before his father's escape to England. He took part in a disastrous uprising against the Danes in Brittany in 931, and fled to England again. With the help of King Æthelstan, he re-established himself as Comte de Vannes et de Nantes in 936 , in effect succeeding as ALAIN II \"Barbetorte\" Duke of Brittany. Borderie dates the start of Duke Alain´s reign to 938 . The Chronicon Floriacensi records the death in 952 of \"Ugo Dux Burgundionum et Alanus Brittonum\" . The Chronicle of Nantes records the death of \"Alanus dux\" and his burial \"apud ecclesiam Sanctorum Donatiani et Rogatiani\" .\n\nm firstly (943) ROSCILLE d'Anjou, daughter of FOULQUES I \"le Roux\" Comte d'Anjou & his wife Roscille [de Loches] (-[943/49]). A document, allegedly from a \"Registre conservé à la Tour de Londres, composé par ordre de Foulque IV\", records that \"Comes Fulco et Tescendis comitissa\" [presumably referring to Comte Foulques I and his wife Roscille] had \"tres filios et Roscillam Alani comitis dicti de Barbatorta uxorem\", although this text does not form part of the surviving fragmentary history of the counts of Anjou which is attributed to Foulque IV \"Réchin\" Comte d´Anjou .\n\nm secondly (before [949/51]) as her first husband, --- de Blois, daughter of THIBAUT [I] \"l'Ancien\" Comte de Blois & his [second wife Richilde ---]. The Chronicle of Nantes records the marriage of \"Alanus dux\" and \"Theobaldum comitem Blesensem sorore sua\" . Although no date is known for this second marriage of Duke Alain, it is likely that his first wife died in 949 at the latest given the birth of his son by his second marriage and his own death in 952. Duke Alain's second wife married secondly, as his second wife, Foulques II Comte d'Anjou. The Chronicle of Nantes records the marriage of \"Theobaldus comes Blesensis sororem suam relictam Alani Barbætortæ ducis\" and \"Fulconi comiti Andegavensi\" .\n\nMistress (1): JUDITH, daughter of --- (-after 952). The Chronicle of Nantes names \"Alani Barbætortæ filios Hoel et Guerech progeniti ex nobili matre Judith\" when recording that they were installed as counts of Nantes . It is assumed that Judith married after the death of Duke Alain, as the Chronicle of Nantes names \"le Vicomte Hamon\", stating that he mourned the loss of \"ses frères Hoel et Guerech\" and sought the support of Foulques \"Nerra\" Comte d'Anjou to avenge their deaths, then being \"jouvenceau de l'aage de vingt ans\" .

[BRIEN [FitzCount] ([1090/1100]-after [1141/42]) . Domesday Descendants states that Brien was the illegitimate son of Alain IV Duke of Brittany , but the primary source which confirms that this is correct has not yet been identified. According to the Complete Peerage, Brien FitzCount was the son of Alain \"le Noir\" de Penthièvre Lord of Richmond (who died in 1146) and his wife Berthe daughter of Conan III Duke of Brittany , but this is impossible from a chronological point of view. He was raised by Henry I King of England . \" Brientio filio comitis \" witnessed the charter dated 1114 under which Henry I King of England granted the land of Roger de Worcester to Walter de Beauchamp . \" Brientio filio Comitis \" witnessed the charter dated 1126 under which Henry I King of England confirmed a donation to Worksop priory . The 1130 Pipe Roll records \"Brientio fil Com\" in Oxfordshire (three entries), Wiltshire (three entries), Hampshire, and Surrey (twice) . Lord of Wallingford, Berkshire de iure uxoris. The Gesta Stephani Regis records that \"Brianus filius Comitis\" who had \"Walengefordiam\" rebelled against King Stephen, dated to [1140/42] . The sources which relate Brien´s holding of the lordship of Abergavenny raise a difficult problem relating to his parentage. The Historia fundationis cum fundatoris genealogia of the priory of Abergavenny which records that Brientio filio comitis de Insula, nepoti suo de sorore sua Lucia inherited the castle of Abergavenny after the death of Hamelinus, frater Luciæ comitissæ de Insula without heirs . This is partially confirmed by the undated charter under which H. de Bellocampo confirmed donations to Abergavenny priory by antecessores mei Hamelinus de Balon et Brientius filius comitis . If this is correct, he was Brien, son of --- Comte de l´Isle & his wife Lucia. No trace has so far been found of the family of this alleged \"Comte de l´Isle\". The Complete Peerage takes the problem a stage further by suggesting that Brien was Lord of Abergavenny (from before 1119) maybe by right of his wife . No other source has been identified which corroborates any family relationship between Hamon de Ballon Lord of Abergavenny and either Brien or his wife. The account in the Historia (which is dated to the early 14th century) should presumably be dismissed as spurious. However, the problem remains of deciding whether Brien was in fact granted the lordship of Abergavenny by right of succession. Empress Matilda permitted \"Milon com Heref\" to hold the castle and honour of Abergavenny, from \"Bri fil com et Matild de Walengeford uxor sue\" by charter dated [Jul 1141/Dec 1142] . The Testa de Nevill includes a writ of King John dated 1212 which records that \"Briennius et Mathillis uxor eius\" retired to monasteries (\"reddiderunt se religioni\") during the reign of King Stephen and that Henri Duke of Normandy, son of Empress Matilda, acquired the honour of Wallingford . According to the Complete Peerage, he was ancestor of the lords of Bedale and Stapelton, and the Stapilton family, who became extinct in the male line in 1307 . According to Domesday Descendants, he left no issue , presumably based on the report in the Testa de Nevill that Brien left no heirs by his wife Matilda .] m MATILDA Lady of Wallingford, Berkshire, daughter of --- (-after [1150]). Empress Matilda permitted \"Milon com Heref\" to hold the castle and honour of Abergavenny, from \"Bri fil com et Matild de Walengeford uxor sue\" by charter dated [Jul 1141/Dec 1142] . Two possible origins are proposed for Matilda. The Testa de Nevill includes a writ of King John dated 1212 which records that \"Roberto Doilli filiam Mathillidem\" inherited the honour of Wallingford in Berkshire and married \"Milo Crispinus\", and after his death \"Briennio filio comitis\", adding that the latter had no heirs by her . If this is correct, she was MATILDA de Oilly, widow of MILES Crespin, daughter and heiress of ROBERT d'Oilly of Wallingford & his wife ---. According to the Complete Peerage, this inquisition in the Testa de Nevill, which appears to be the only surviving authority which supposedly confirms this second marriage, is \"of too late a date to be implicitly relied on\" . In any case, from a chronological point of view, its version of events is extremely improbable: Matilda de Oilly´s marriage to Milo Crispin is estimated to before Easter 1084 (based on the Chronicle of Abingdon names \"Milone de Walingaford cognomento Crispin\" among those who accompanied Henry, son of William I King of England, to Abingdon monastery to celebrate Easter 1084 ), while her supposed second husband Brien FitzCount was raised by Henry I King of England , presumably indicating his date of birth in the late 11th/early 12th century. Bracton notes a claim, dated 1225, by \"Henricus de Oilly\" against \"Willelmum Basset\" for \"feodum dim. militis in Hispedena\", the plaintiff claiming that it was held by \"Matillis de Oylli [ Briennius filius Comitis uxor sua] tempore H. Regis patris Imperatricis\" who died without heirs, inherited by \"Roberto de Oylli Henrici de Oylli patri istius Henrici\" . A second possible origin is proposed by Domesday Descendants, according to which Brien´s wife was the daughter of the older Matilda of Wallingford , therefore MATILDA Crespin, daughter of MILES Crispin Lord of Wallingford & his wife Matilda de Oilly Lady of Wallingford. This proposed solution appears to answer all the possible difficulties. The Testa de Nevill includes a writ of King John dated 1212 which records that \"Briennius et Mathillis uxor eius\" retired to monasteries (\"reddiderunt se religioni\") during the reign of King Stephen and that Henri Duke of Normandy, son of Empress Matilda, acquired the honour of Wallingford . Brien had [two possible children, maybe not by his known wife]:\n\na) [two sons . The Historia fundationis cum fundatoris genealogia of the priory of Abergavenny records that the two sons of Brien Lord of Abergavenny were lepers . If correct, this would explain why the lordship of Abergavenny was transferred away from Brien´s family. However, as discussed further above, the account in the Historia is dubious. As also noted above, the inquisition dated 1212 stated that Brien died without heirs by his wife Matilda de Wallingford, although if their sons were lepers they could have been disinherited.]\n\nE.

He seized the county of Nantes on the death in 1158 of Geoffroy Comte de Nantes, son of Henry II King of England. King Henry II deprived Duke Conan of the lordship of Richmond, but it was returned to him under the agreement reached in Sep 1158. \"Conan dux Britannie comes Richmundie\" confirmed the donation of Plubihan and Plougasnou to Saint-Georges de Rennes by charter to [1156/69], witnessed by \"Margarita comitissa, Willelmo filio Hamon, Alano de Rohan, Constancia sorore comitis \" .

As her mother gave birth to two children during her short third marriage, it is likely that Catherine was born towards the end of her mothers life, which may have ended in giving birth to Catherine. The primary source which confirms that this speculation is correct has not been identified. A charter dated 1212 records the dowry agreed between \"Alix filia comitis Britanniæ\" and \"Andreæ de Vitreio juveni\" for the latter´s marriage to \"Catherina sorore mea\" . A charter dated to [1213] records that comes Guido Britannie\" married \"Katherinam filiam suam\" to \"domine Andree de Vitriaco\" with \"in maritagium unam partem foreste Redonensis\" . m (1212) as his first wife, ANDRE [III] Seigneur de Vitré, son of ANDRE [II] Seigneur de Vitré & his [third] wife Eustachie --- (-Mansurah 8 Feb 1250).\n\nf) [MARGUERITE (-[1216/1220]) . The parentage of the first wife of Geoffroy [I] de Rohan is discussed more fully below. Her marriage is confirmed by the following document: \"Gaufredus vicecomes de Rohan\" confirmed donations to Bonrepos abbey made by avus meus Alanus vicecomes de Rohan et pater meus, for the salvation of Margaritæ uxoris meæ, with the consent of \"fratribus meis Oliverio et Alano\", by charter dated 1216 . The following charter appears to provide the only indication of Marguerites family origin: \"Petrus dux Britanniæ comes Richemundiæ\" confirmed, for the souls of nostræ et...Margaritæ sororis nostræ dicti Gaufridi quondam uxoris, that Alanus vicecomes de Rohan had donated revenue de Costeteia to Bonrepos for the soul of \"Gaufridi fratris sui\", by charter dated 1232 . If sororis in this document is read literally, she was the sister of Pierre de Dreux Duke of Brittany. Another possibility is that sororis should be interpreted as sister-in-law. This parentage was assumed to be correct by several 18th and 19th century secondary sources and is an attractive possibility considering Marguerites Breton marriage. The difficulty is that Constance, during her short third marriage, appears to have had insufficient time to have given birth to three children, although Léa Chaillou has suggested recently that Marguerite may have been twin with Catherine and that a difficult twin birth may explain Constances early death . m as his first wife, GEOFFROY [I] Vicomte de Rohan, son of ALAIN [IV] Vicomte de Rohan & his wife Mabile de Fougères (-15 Sep 1221).]\n\n2. [one or more] children . Margaret of Scotland confirmed a donation to Sawtry abbey, for the souls of mea et comiti Conani et puerorum et antecessores nostrorum by undated charter [dated to 1185/1201?], witnessed by [her son] Henry de Bohun . The text suggests that the children in question were born to Margarets first marriage and were probably deceased at the time.\n\nDuke Conan had [one [presumably illegitimate] child] by [an unknown mistress]:\n\n3. [GUILLAUME (-after [1199/1201]). The following two charters indicate a family relationship between Guillaume and the rulers of Brittany: Constantia comitis Conani filia ducissa Britannie, comitissa Richemundie granted a house at Nantes to Buzay abbey, for the souls of patris mei Comitis Conani et Comitis Gaufridi, quondam mariti mei, with the consent of Arturi filii mei, by charter dated to [1199/1201], witnessed by ...Willelmo clerico, fratre Comitisse... . Arturus dux Britannie...et Constancia domina et mater mea... confirmed donations to Saint-Julien-du-Pré made by Hugo comes et Berta Comitissa antecessores nostri by charter dated to [6 Apr 1199/Aug 1201], witnessed by ...Willelmo fratre Comitisse . It is assumed that Comitisse refers in both cases to Constance, although she is also named ducissa elsewhere in the first document. There are several possible explanations for the family relationship. (1) Guillaume was the illegitimate son of Duke Conan, the most likely possibility in view of his sisters succession to the duchy. (2) He was Duke Conans legitimate son, born after Constances betrothal to Geoffrey of England, whose succession rights would have imperilled King Henry IIs plan to control Brittany and were set aside by the king. If that is correct, it is surprising that his birth appears to have been ignored by contemporary chronicles, unless he was in some way disabled which might also explain his ecclesiastical career. (3) He was the son of Constances mother by her second marriage, although in that case his presence in charters in Brittany would be surprising as he would more likely have lived in England. No indication has been found of Guillaumes ecclesiastical position.]\n\nThe precise parentage of the following person, whose relationship with the dukes of Brittany is recorded as shown below, is uncertain.\n\n1.MARGUERITE (-[1216/1220]) . Her marriage is confirmed by the following document: \"Gaufredus vicecomes de Rohan\" confirmed donations to Bonrepos abbey made by avus meus Alanus vicecomes de Rohan et pater meus, for the salvation of Margaritæ uxoris meæ, with the consent of \"fratribus meis Oliverio et Alano\", by charter dated 1216 . The following charter appears to provide the only indication of Marguerites family origin: \"Petrus dux Britanniæ comes Richemundiæ\" confirmed, for the souls of nostræ et...Margaritæ sororis nostræ dicti Gaufridi quondam uxoris, that Alanus vicecomes de Rohan had donated revenue de Costeteia to Bonrepos for the soul of \"Gaufridi fratris sui\", by charter dated 1232 . Four possible parentages have been proposed. Firstly, if soror in this document is read literally, she was Marguerite de Dreux, daughter of Robert [II] Comte de Dreux et de Braine & his second wife Yolande de Coucy. No other record has been found which names one of Pierres sisters Marguerite, so this parentage is not impossible. It is true that the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers only to seven daughters of Pierres parents , but the omission of an eighth daughter is not impossible bearing in mind Alberics numerous inaccuracies. None of Pierres known sisters married Breton noblemen, but after his own marriage Pierre may have wanted to consolidate his position in Brittany by marrying an unmarried sister to a powerful local magnate. Secondly, sororis in the 1232 document could be interpreted as sister-in-law which, if correct, means that she was Marguerite de Thouars, daughter of Guy de Thouars & his second wife Constance Dss of Brittany. This parentage was assumed to be correct by several 18th and 19th century secondary sources and is an attractive possibility considering Marguerites Breton marriage. The difficulty is that Constance, during her short third marriage, appears to have had insufficient time to have given birth to three children, although Léa Chaillou has suggested recently that Marguerite may have been twin with Constances daughter Catherine and that a difficult twin birth may explain Constances early death . Thirdly, Europäische Stammtafeln shows Guy de Rohans first wife as Marguerite de Blundeville, daughter of Ranulf de Blundeville Earl of Chester & his first wife Constance de Bretagne . No other source has been found which discusses this possibility. It is assumed that it is speculative, based on the apparent chronological difficulty of Constance giving birth to three children by her third husband. This possibility appears unlikely to be correct as Marguerites hereditary claim to the duchy of Brittany which would have been senior to the wife of Pierre de Dreux, who was Constances oldest daughter by her third husband. While Marguerite may have been side-lined like Constances oldest daughter Eléonore, born from her mothers first marriage, it is probable that Marguerites Breton husband would have pressed such a claim to increase his power-base. Another problem is the Genealogia Comitum Richemundiæ which records that the second marriage of \"Constantia filia Conani\" and \"Ranulphus Comes Cestriæ\" was childless , although it is possible that this source omitted children who died young without children of their own. Fourthly, she could have been Marguerite de Blundeville, daughter of Ranulf de Blundeville Earl of Chester & his second wife Clémence de Fougères. This seems the least likely of the four possibilities as it would stretch the definition of soror in the 1232 document beyond what is probable. m as his first wife, GEOFFROY [I] Vicomte de Rohan, son of ALAIN [IV] Vicomte de Rohan & his wife Mabile de Fougères (-15 Sep 1221).]\n\nChapter 2. DUKES of BRITTANY 1213-1514 (DREUX-CAPET)\n\nPIERRE de Dreux, son of ROBERT [II] Comte de Dreux et de Braine & his second wife Yolande de Coucy ([1187]-at sea off Damietta end-May 1250, bur Braine, église abbatiale de Saint-Ived) .

He was created Earl of Richmond by Henry III King of England 16 Jan 1219 (confiscated Nov 1224, restored Oct 1229, confiscated again Jan 1235). Johannes comes Matisconensis names frater meus P. comes Britannie in a charter dated Aug 1234 . He surrendered the duchy of Brittany to his son in 1237, after which he is sometimes referred to as PIERRE de Braine. William of Tyre (Continuator) names \"Pierre de Drues cuens de Bretaigne\" among those who took part in the crusade from France which landed at Acre in 1239 . He accompanied King Louis IX on crusade in 1249 and was captured at Faraskur 6 Apr 1250, after being wounded at the battle of Mansurah.

The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"unam filiam Mabiliam\" as the child of \"Constantiam comitis Conani filia\" and her [third] husband \"Guido frater vicecomitem de Tuart\" .

Her marriage is confirmed by an epitaph at Villeneuve which records the burial of \"Nicolle, la mère monsour Olivier de Machecou\" , read together with the charter dated 10 Mar 1258 under which \"Jehan duc de Bretaigne conte de Richemont\" confirmed an agreement between \"Morice de Belle Ville, par raison de Jehanne sa femme, dame de la Roche sur Yon et de Luçon\" and \"Olivier nostre frère\" concerning \"la terre de Machecoul et de Saint Philbert\" .

The Annals of Dunstable record the betrothal of filiam comitis Britanniæ and rex Franciæ fratri suo minori, who received the county of Anjou, in 1227 . Her betrothal to Thibaut IV Comte de Champagne is confirmed by a letter from King Louis IX to Comte Thibaut, dated 1229, which states that the king had entendu que vous avez convenancé et promis à prendre à femme la fille du Comte Pierre de Bretaigne and forbade him from proceeding, adding la raison pourquoi vous savez bien (without providing any further explanation) . The 1229 date (cited by Lobineau) is presumably incorrect, assuming that the date of death of Comte Thibaut´s second wife is correctly reported as 11 Jul 1231 as shown above.
