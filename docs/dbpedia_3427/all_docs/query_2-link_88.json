Hee saies that his Merchants to whom his goodes were first consigned unto at St. Lucars were Peter le Farishe, Mons. Nicholas Blundell, and Lanfrancke David, which were Frenchmen. Hee saieth hee hadd goodes also consigned to Flemings. Hee confesseth hee heard of the embarque before, but would not beleeve it. Hee came from St. Lucars the 29th of August last, and sayes that the same Merchants to whom his goodes were consigned reladed him.

But before they would resolve, their Lordships required information from the Lord Carew and the Commissioners of the Navie, and willed mee also to attend them at Hampton Court tomorrow morning. In obedience to this order I have written to the Lord Carew to acquaint his Lordship with their pleasure and to desire him accordingly to send his advise. I have also required both the Commissioners of the Navie and the 26 officers of the Ordnance to meet this afternoone at the Tower to consider of this business, and of the overwaight of iron ordinance which was formerly referred unto them from the boord, and I doubt not but sume of them wil attend tomorrow at Hampton Court to give accompt of theis matters. For my excuse I must acquaint your Lordships and intreat you to certifie the Lords if they require it, that the examination of al the Bils of lading, letters of assignation, commissions, and writings, of al sort (which in bulk are more than a strong man can carie uppon his back) concerning the prise goods, is now my employment, and I have sent for men from divers parts and have kept some a week in my house to informe and assist mee in the discoverie of those things which may cleare his Majestes title and satisfie the world in our just and aqual proceedings; so as uppon this woork the answering of the clamors of the Ambassadors, the due and legal expedition in the Admiraltie cort, and which most importeth the speedie raising of monies by the sales of lawful prises do mainly depend. So as without verie great prejudice to his Majestes service I could not at this time intermit the attendance of this woorke.

Right honorable\n\nIt pleaseth you to require my present coming to Cort to attend the Committee appointed to speake with the States Ambassador about the ships and to settle a constant order to bee observed in al prises for the future. For the Ambassador [the Duke hath] given mee leave to tel you, that if the answer alreadie given him in writing and the resolution of the Lords at the last meeting at Hampton Cort, bee not a sufficient satisfaction at least to stay his clamor til hee seeth what the justice of the Admiraltie Cort wil produce: ther can bee nothing donne by the Lords at this time to quiet him without more prejudice to his Majeste and also to the Lord Admiral in his particular jurisdiction, then wil bee convenient, at least in his absence to be resolved uppon: and to change the ancient formes and proceedings of the Admiraltie Cort and settle a new frame in matters of reprisal without his presence and due consideration therof taken, I am confident neither your Lordship nor the boord wil thingk reasonable or just. And for the increasing of seamens wages the proposition being his own and hee giving way (as you know) to have it debated at the boord: it wil bee no less requisite that his Grace bee ther also when it shal bee considered of: and if al theis important matters must of necessitie 31 bee put of til his Graces return my present coming to Cort can have no other frute but the delaying of those businesses here, which I dare say are of so great importance that the satisfaction to bee given to the Ambassadors and the course to bee setled for reprisals wil much depend uppon it. For even the Judg himself knoweth not yet what ships are to bee detained or releast, nor what goods are prise or not prise til the bils and letters bee al examined and the state therof set down which is the tedious and difficult woorke which I have stil in hand, namely to peruse al the letters written in Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch, and English, and some in Arabeck, and to gather out of them what may discover the proprietie of everie peece of goods. Besids to survey al the bils of lading and to compare al the merchants marks, and by conference with merchants and factors to find out the colorers of the enemies parcels. I had perused (as I thought) so manie as were recovered before my last journey, but this day a new bundle is sent mee from the Tower, and if I finish this business by the end of this weeke I must woorke al the day and some part of the night: and yet al the day long some occasion or other for the Navie interrupt my indevors, so as I assure your Honor I need no other diversion, if possibly I may bee spared. Yet, if you command mee, I wil not faile to attend you on Saterday morning uppon your summons by the next post. The note for Proclamations I send your Honor hereinclosed which I had in purpose to have delivered to Mr. Atturney, if Sir Robt. Pye had not yesterday informed mee that hee is sick. Your Honor may bee pleased to consider whether the hast of theis proclamations may effect his recoverie or whether it bee not fitt that the Lord Keeper give direction therin to the Sollicitor of Kings Sergeants. I have alreadie sent to Plimouth to stay the Lion.ther, and to hasten away the prise and to restrain Mons. Soubizes companies from anie attempt to the offence of the French Vice Admiral. The fleet[6] (as you see) cometh scateringly 32 home and I know the Lords have given direction for the relief of the sick men and quartering the soldiers. But you see what the Mayor writeth to their Lordships, whose letter to them I send back hereinclosed: and further Sir Jeames Bagge writeth plainly that the gentlemen of those parts wil in no wise bee drawn to aine contribution or to anie engagement in matter of monie, and if monies bee not in some measure supplied the miserie and clamor that wil speedily follow wil bee no less dangerous then greevous to bee born. For God's sake (my good Lord) lett us first see how possibly wee can raise monies to discharge this unfortunate armie and fleet that cometh home, before there bee anie debate or mention of increasing more charge. The end of my attendance here is to hasten the raising of monies by sales of prise goods here which, til this woorke bee finished, can not possibly bee wel donne, and til monies bee made here, ther wil bee no possibilitie (for ought I understand) either to pay the fleet that cometh home [or] to sett forth those ships which are prepared to attend Captain Penington to Plimouth. This day the Masters of some of the merchants came to mee to protest that if monies were not presently supplied for victuals they could noe longer hold their companies together. My Lord Treasurer wil shortly sleep unquietly in his bed, and I pray God wil see not greater mischiefe follow. Pardon my boldness and retain him in your favour who is Your Lordships\n\nhumble servant\n\nJohn Coke.\n\nTottenham 1625\n\n14 December.\n\n—Sir John Coke to Lord Conway.\n\n[S. P. Dom. Charles I. xii. i.]\n\n1625, Dec. 17. Right honorable\n\nBy your servant I writt this morning to the Lord Admiral to give him notice of an advertisement I had, that nine Hamburghers 33 went passed by Dover towards Spaine laden with cordage and munition; and since, I have heard by Sir John Wolstenholm that out of the Sound about 20 ships are gone by the North of Irland with like lading for the enimie. I have withal written to Plimouth to Sir Jeams Bagge who hath charge of the Lion, that hee inquire the best hee can whether this contrarie wind hath not forced the 9 Hamburgers into sum port on that coast, and that, with the Lion and Swiftsure and such other ships as may ther bee found readie, hee take the best course hee can to intercept them. And for these Easterlings which are gone about Irland, that hee find means to advertise our fleet in their return, or to send woord into Irland, if anie of our fleet by the late easterly winds have been carried thither, that they do their best indevor to make stay of those provisions: and more uppon the sudden I knew not what to do But because it may happen that the Hamburgers are put in at the Cowes in the Wight, I thought fit to desire your Lordship to write to your Captans ther to do their indevor also: at least to advertise your Honor whether they were passed that way. I had formerly given warning of this fleet to the ships in the Downs, but they fownd it not for their ease to waigh anchor in fowle weather: I gave notice also to my Lord Duke, when hee was in Holland, that the States men of warre or some of his Graces fleet might give impediment to their passage. And to prevent this mischeif at least for the future I moved his Majeste and the Lords for letters to bee written to the King of Denmarck to stay al such ships at Elsenor and in the Elve; and his Majestes pleasure was that your Honor should take order in it as I formerly writt unto you, which I humbly leave to your care. More I heare that the Ambassadors stil press your Honors for the discharge of the ships and goods now at London, and suffer you not to give way to an ordinarie and judicial proceeding, which, if they prevaile in, you must make accompt that his Majeste and the Lord Admiral shal herafter make no benefit of the justest prises that shal bee taken; for some Ambassader wil bee engaged and those that are the Kings ministers, if they bee not permitted to have time for 34 a legal and just course, wil easily be discouraged from sifting and examining the pretences which are made and which require time to be discovered. In this respect I hope you have put of their further hearing til the Lord Admirals return: and I labor what I can to have things readie against that time, though in truth my continual diversions by the importunitie of those that are sent to call upon mee in theis business wil hardly give mee leave to disgest what I have gathered. His Giace sent mee woord this day that hee would bee at Cort this weeke that is coming. If your Lordship knows the day, I beseech you give mee notice, that I may not faile then to attend you. And in the meane time permit not the clamors of the Ambassadors so to govern our councels as to hinder the fitt and necessarie cautions in the course of our justice. And lastly lett mee put you in mind of the letter promised by the Lords to release the stay of the sales of prise goods which is not yet sent unto mee. And if the Lord Treasurer can find no monies in the Exchequer, and your Lordship wil suffer none to be raised by the sales what you wil do when the Fleet cometh home I know not; but that the Fleet now preparing hath been hindered alreadie and that much charge is increased by want of meanes to discharg and putt of the men aboord theis ships I can give a true accompt: and if you shal limit the sales to such goods (as I heare you intend) which are out of question, I know not what goods can bee sold, since ther is neither ship nor particular goods therin to which no man doth pretend. Good my Lord, bee a meanes to ad honor and strength to our judicial proceedings, as they do in al contries: and suffer us not to bee subject to the clamors and censures of strangers; but if you find either Judg or Minister do that which is unjust cawse him to bee ponished, but give time to know the truth. Ther bee matters of more consequence to bee now considered of, namly how to find meanes to support the great warre to which wee are ingaged, for, if wee proceed to woorke without meanes, and do not at this verie time consider and prepare for that which is to bee donne against the spring; wee shal but expose al our actions to the scorn of the 35 world, and shal draw uppon us more danger then is yet taken to hart. I wil do my best [to] make my Lord Admiral sensible therof at his return; and this is the cawse why I do not now wait uppon you, as also for that I rest assured you have put of the Ambassadors further answer til his Graces return.

S'il eust pleu aux dits Officiers 48 de se tenir à la Declaration la quelle Vostre Majesté a faicte par l'advis de son tres sage Conseil le xxviii de Decembre et l'executer selon la bonne et sincere intention de Vostre Majesté, je me fusse tres volontiers passe de donner a Vostre Majesté ceste peine, mais d'aultant que les procédures qu'ils tiennent vont tout au contraire de ce que tous les interessez se debvoient promettre de la dicte gratieuse declaration de Vostre Majeste et qu'elles nous vont plonger au fond des maulx, lesquels je luy ai aultrefois representez, je prie tres humblement Vostre Majesté; Sire, qu'il luy plaise de me permettre que je luy puisse succintement proposer ce que s'est passé en cet affaire, afin que Vostre Majesté aiant prinse cognoissance de l'estat d'iceluy, elle daigne d'y applicquer sa main Roiale pour nous soustenir que n'enfondrions plus profondement et de regler cet affaire une fois pour toutes de telle sorte que son service et l'execution de ses tres haults desseings puissent estre advancez, et sincerement et fidelement conservee la bonne amitie et correspondence entre Vostre Magesté et Messeigneurs les Estatz des Provinces Unies voz tres affectionez et plus asseurez alliez et amiis. Il y a plus de quattre mois, Sire, que ce malheureux saisissement de navires et biens des quels il s'agist s'est faict, dont les nouvelles vindrent au Pays Bas quasi en mesme temps que les Ambassadeurs des Estatz faisoient leur rapport de l'alliance conclue a Tydischfieldt,[8] les quelies nouvelles causerent de tres grandes alterations aux esprits des inhabitans, mesmes des Magistrats des villes, d'aultant plus grandes qu'ils ne s'attendoient à rein de semblable, ains s'estoient promis un singulier repos en l'amitie de Vostre Majesté et seurete en leur traficq, reglé par les articles de l'alliance nouvellement faicte au contraire des quels ils entendoient leurs navires et biens estre arrestez. J'ai commence' a demander restitution des biens appartenants aux inhabitans du Pays Bas et reparation des torts et domages par eux soufferts, au mois d'Octobre à Sarisbury et continue encores en la poursuite. A Hamptincour ai je remonstré à Vostre Majesté et à Messeignrs de son Conseil a diverses fois le præjudice 49 qui se faisoit par la detention des biens saisis aux haultes conceptions et desseings de Vostre Majesté et à l'amitie la quelle doibt estre soigneusement procurée et gardée entre Vostre Majesté et tous les aultres Roix Princes Estats et Republicques interessez en la grandeur d'Espaigne, et represente que les formalites des procedures præcipitées qu'on tenoit alors sur les diets biens en la Cour de l'Adimiraulté à Maidenhead estoit pour engendrer encores aultant de mescontentement que la realité du saisissement avoit faicte, avecq deduction en gros des mauvais traictements qu'ont receu les subjects des diets Seigneurs Estats et des desordres commis au diet saisissement; m'estant aussi advance de servir d'advis à Vostre Majesté qu'il eust été tres bon d'evoquer cet affaire au Conseil de Vostre Majesté comme un affaire d'Estat, et auquel de faict sont interessés quasi touts les Princes Estats et Republicques aboutissans a la mer depuis le golfe de Venise jusques au milieu de la mer Balthicque et par consequence tous les autres. Vostre Majesté et Messeignrs de son Conseil m'ont tousjours oui benignement (dont je les remercie) et m'a a esté souventesfois respondu gratieusement en general que Pintention de Vostre Majesté n'estoit que les subjects de Messeignrs les Estatz fussent aulcunement endommagez: mesmes il y a eu des Commissaires lesquels ont conferé aulcunes fois avecq moi sans que toutesfois grands effects s'en soient ensuivis, sinon que Messeignrs du Conseil ont ordonné le xiiij de Decembre que les Commissionaires des biens saisis n'eussent à vendre aulcuns biens reclamez par les subjects des Seigneurs Estats, ce que les diets Commissionaires s'estoient alors proposez de faire sojabz de pretextes assuz impertinents. Depuis il a pleu à vostre Majesté de faire la declaration de la quelie j'ai faict mention cy devant, portante que touts les biens des prinses qui feront trouvez appartenir aux subjects des Estats des Provinces Unies, pourveu que les diets biens ne soient fraudeleusement colorez de leurs noms, en cas qu'ils n'appartinssent aux subjects du Roy d'Espaigne, seront delivrez à ceulx tels qu'ils appartiendront. La dicte declaration a donnée une grande consolation aux poursuivants qui sont icy en grand nombre et a tres 50 grands frais et despens, et entre eulx des Maistres des navires et gens de marine qui abaient à la faim, eulx et leurs pouvres femmes et enfans. J'ai envoie la dicte declaration de Vostre Majesté au Pays Bas tout aussy tost que je Fai receue, et adjousté en mes lettres a mes Superieurs les tres sages considerations les quelles ont esmenes Vostre Majesté a la faire pour les asseurer de tant plus de la bonté et justice de Vostre Majesteé.

Also there is an arest made per these Dunkerk marctants, which are heare towne dwellers which doe alredye repent theyr bargin, for all the towne doth stand with our merchants against them, and doe apose against them, and withall have drawne a generall protest against them, and also the custom howse hath protested against them in the huyest degree, 64 afferminge howe they have nott onlye in a manner hindred the towne, butt that theye have spoilled and hindred the Kinge of a greate deale of monye which they should have received for the customs of mannye ships laden with goodes, so that they have[13] protested for great damage and interest; so that they have in a manner offered to withdraw theyr arest conditioned that the custom howse will withdraw theyr protest, butt that theye will nott yett doe by reasson of theyr great losse which they have sustained. Yesternight in sight of all the towne came over the Have-at-all of Dover, and carryed a waye 3 of theyr shipes out of the road, where there was one amongst them which had 9 peeces of ordinance, which hath mad a great stirr amongst them; also the frigetts. of Gravelin are everye morninge before the Harbar.

Mr. Deputee reported further that it pleased his Majestie to summon by an express messenger Mr. Governor and himself with some others of the Companie to attend him att Whitehall uppon Sunday last[1] in the morning, and for as much as Mr. Governor's health did not then permitt him, Mr. Deputie, accompanied with some of the Committees, went to Whitehall, where, uppon notice given to his Majestie of their beeing there, he sent for them in, and, commaunding the Chamber to be voyded of all other company, he tould them that he had understood from the Duke of Buckingham that the companie had before his going promised to grattifie him, the said Duke, 72 that promise also confirmed since att a Courte; he therefore advised them to do it now in his absence, and that in so doing the guift will come the more acceptably, because thereby it would appeere they had bene mindfull of him; he said further (and spake it cheerefully) that the grattifficacion to the Duke had bene staid untill the busines of Ormuz[2] were cleered; the King tould them their shippes were now come from thence, so as he doubted not but they would answere it well enough; and, therefore, now they might perfourme what they intended. Mr. Deputy made answeare that they their present were but a few, and could not do anie such thing alone; but he would moove it to the Company, and his Majestie should have an accompt thereof; the King willed him so to doe, and that in anie case they should send him their answere wheresoever he should be in progress. The Courte considered of the favours formerly done to the Companie by the said Lo: Admirall, and the continuall use they shall have of his favor; and that this business of Ormuz (how well soever to be answeared of the Companies parte) maie find a strong opposicion. Also, howsoever it had pleased the King formerly to saie that the Lo: Admirall should have nothing from the Companie for the busines with the Dutch,[3] yet it is both fitt to gratiffie him, and it appeares to be expected att their handes. It was also remembred that att such time as the rest of the Lordes were grattiffied, it was resolved to grattiffie him also, that the same resolucion had been confirmed att anoather Court, but no somme sett downe. It was therefore now propounded what somme wilbe fitt to be geven to the Lo: Admirall as well for his favors shewen the Companie in the last treaty with the Dutch as to sweeten him for their future occasions, and particularly for that of Ormuz. The 73 Courte with one consent agreed and ordered that he shall have two thousand poundes: and Mr. Deputie and Mr. Munnes were entreated to acquaint his Majestie with the Courtes resolucion.\n\n—Examinations in the Court of Admiralty about the taking of a Portuguese ship.\n\n[S.
