        "text": "Saddam Hussein: Captured\n\nHere at The Gallup Poll this week, our key job is the assessment of the impact of the dramatic capture of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein on American public opinion.\n\nThere has been no shortage of speculation on the issue, including, in particular, intense debate on the potential implications of the events in Iraq on the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Many observers have opined that Americans will now become more supportive of the war effort, that there will be a more positive evaluation of the way in which the United States and coalition forces have handled the war, that President Bush's standing (and re-election chances) will shoot up, and that Democratic front-runner Howard Dean may be hurt because of his strongly anti-war campaign stances.\n\nHowever, my review of our \"instant-reaction\" CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, conducted Sunday, suggests that the American public -- as is often the case in the wake of a major news event -- may not change its attitudes concerning both the war and the political landscape nearly as much as some have predicted as a result of Hussein's capture.\n\nClearly, the poll suggests that Americans consider the capture to be a significant event; more than 8 in 10 say it was a \"major achievement,\" while almost no one says that it was not an achievement at all. The poll also shows some increase in American confidence that positive outcomes may occur in the war -- including a 13-percentage-point increase in confidence that a democratic government will eventually be established in Iraq, a 13-percentage-point increase in confidence that weapons of mass destruction may eventually be found in Iraq, and a 12-percentage-point increase in confidence that attacks against U.S. troops may decrease.\n\nBush and others in the administration have cautioned the American public that Hussein's capture does not mean that all will be well in Iraq, and the American public has apparently taken heed. There is by no means a consensus, or even majority agreement, that the capture of the deposed Iraqi dictator means that the war is over, or that the military situation can be immediately turned over to the Iraqi army.\n\nFifty-eight percent of those interviewed on Sunday said that the capture does not mean that troops will be able to come home earlier than planned, and a substantial 67% of Americans believe that the capture will make no difference or only a minor difference in the number of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq. Just 2% of Americans believe that the capture will signal an end to combat deaths. (Similarly, 90% of those interviewed in an ABC/Washington Post poll on Sunday agree that big challenges to the United States in Iraq still lie ahead.)\n\nThere is also no indication that Hussein's capture has caused Americans who previously opposed the war to change their minds, particularly in the context of the situation in which support for the basic concept of U.S. intervention in Iraq had been on the rise before Hussein was captured. The percentage of Americans saying that the situation in Iraq was worth going to war over had been as low as 50% in September, but rose to 59% by Dec. 5-7. Sunday's poll shows that 62% now say the situation in Iraq was worth fighting over -- not a statistically significant change. It may well be that Americans, while granting the great symbolic importance of the capture of Hussein, had already factored his eventual capture or death into their thinking before, making his actual capture an anti-climax of sorts.\n\nImpact of the Capture on President Bush\n\nDespite all the discussion of the impact of Hussein's capture on opinion about the war, the most intense speculation has centered on its political implications.\n\nFirst and foremost, in some ways any positive impact that the capture has on Bush's election outlook will be just another bit of good news that the president has been enjoying of late. According to Gallup's Dec. 5-7 poll, Bush's job approval rating had risen to 55%. Over the weekend, a Dec. 11-14 Gallup Poll (most of which was conducted before news of the capture became public), showed the president's rating holding steady at 56%. The fact that three-quarters of the interviewing for this poll was conducted prior to the announcement of the capture on Sunday morning suggests that Bush was faring well even without the Hussein publicity.\n\nSo I certainly anticipate that Bush's job approval will remain relatively high (or even climb higher) in the next full poll conducted after the capture. The question of how long any possible rally effect will last is key, but will only be answered definitively with the passage of time.\n\nAt the same time, there are strong cautionary signs in the data that suggest at least the possibility that Hussein's capture will not be a major pivotal point in the campaign for the presidency. For example, Sunday's poll asked the public about the impact of the capture on their intention to vote for Bush. The results? Almost no one is willing to say that Hussein's capture will affect his or her vote. Forty-five percent of Americans say they were already planning to vote for Bush, 43% say they were not planning on voting for Bush and the capture did not change their opinion, and only 3% said that the capture has made them more likely to vote for Bush after having been predisposed to vote against him before the event.\n\nAs I've noted, at this point Bush is not desperately in need of a boost in his presidential campaign positioning. There are two major elements that will be most important in determining Bush's re-election chances -- the economy and the situation in Iraq. In both areas, the data are looking positive for Bush.\n\nIndeed, the Dec. 11-14 Gallup Poll shows an extraordinary increase in optimism about the direction of the economy, with 60% of Americans now saying that the economy is getting better, and only 32% saying it is getting worse. This is the most positive reading on this measure that we have seen since August 2000, at the tail end of the economic boom. Additionally, the percentage of Americans who say the economy is the most important problem facing the nation has gone down, an indicator that the economy is moving out of the public's consciousness as a major concern.\n\nImpact of the Capture on Howard Dean\n\nMany eyes are on the candidacy of Dean, the former governor of Vermont, whose campaign has been built to a significant degree around his criticisms of the war in Iraq. Dean was low-key in his reaction yesterday, saying, \"This is a great day for the Iraqi people, the U.S., and the international community,\" before going on to call for quick international cooperation in dealing with Iraq.\n\nDean's Democratic competitors, however, quickly sensed an opportunity to score points against Dean. Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who has been decidedly more hawkish on the war than Dean, was quoted on Sunday as saying: \"If Howard Dean had his way, Saddam Hussein would be in power today, not in prison.\"\n\nDean is receiving such attention because he has clearly moved to the front-runner position in the race for his party's nomination. Our Dec. 11-14 poll shows that Dean is getting 31% of the vote from registered Democrats, almost 20 points above his nearest Democratic rival. (Dean moved into clear front-runner position in our Dec. 5-7 poll, before the well-publicized endorsement of former Vice President Al Gore.)\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Dean can maintain his front-runner status, both nationally and in the key early caucus and primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa. Dean has his largest poll lead in New Hampshire, but the possible impact of the events in Iraq on Democratic support for his candidacy, if any, will more likely show up in Iowa and such critical Feb. 3 primary states as South Carolina than in New Hampshire (which is next door to Dean's home state of Vermont).\n\nWhat Should Happen to Saddam?\n\nFinally, there is the issue of what should happen to Hussein now that he has been captured. The precise details of his trial will be worked out and made public in the weeks to come, and it's quite likely that he will be tried by an Iraqi tribunal of some sort. But of the three choices we gave Americans in the Sunday poll, the plurality said that \"an international court, applying international laws and legal standards\" would be the best venue for Hussein's trial. Only a quarter of Americans opted for an \"Iraqi court with Iraqi judges and juries,\" and about the same percentage said they favor an American military tribunal.\n\nInterestingly, the poll suggests that Americans are no more anxious to have Hussein put to death than they would be for any convicted murderer in the United States. About 6 in 10 Americans opt for the death penalty for Hussein if he is convicted, while most of the rest would settle for life imprisonment with no opportunity for parole. That's little different from the results of this death penalty question when we last asked it in its usual generic sense last May."
