        "text": "In March 2003, I watched President George W. Bush give an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and his sons on television: Leave Iraq in 48 hours or the United States will commence military conflict.\n\nIn the months leading up to this moment the president had claimed that Saddam Hussein was in possession of weapons of mass destruction and was evading United Nations inspectors. Secretary of State Colin Powell had famously gone before the U.N. and provided evidence of Saddam’s secret weapons programs.\n\nAs a 15-year-old boy raised on first-person shooter video games, Tom Clancy novels and Rambo, this all seemed like the plot line to a great action movie. I thought war in Iraq would be a great adventure and America would surely prevail. We couldn’t let Saddam Hussein have weapons of mass destruction, now could we?\n\nShortly before American forces invaded Iraq, I was assigned to write an essay on my reactions to the impending war by a teacher at Apollo High School. I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to show off how much I knew about Iraq. I read news articles and listened to everything the president said. I knew all about Tomahawk cruise missiles, F/A-18 fighter jets and M1 Abrams tanks (mostly from PC games). I considered myself an authority on this subject.\n\nI don't remember exactly what grade I got, but I'm sure it was no better than a C. My writing was technically OK but my teacher thought my arguments were unsound. After all, they had more or less been lifted from Bush administration rhetoric and missile specs from Lockheed Martin's website.\n\nI was disappointed but at this point I was a mediocre student, so it didn't surprise me. What did was when my teacher pulled me aside to challenge me on the content of my essay. She grilled me on what I had written.\n\n\"People made similar arguments during the Vietnam War. Do you know how that turned out? War is never what people expect,\" she said. This is what made me listen because she belonged to the Vietnam War generation and was speaking to me from the heart.\n\nIt turned out that teacher was more right than I, and maybe even she, ever expected. The lesson she tried to impart to a jingoistic 15-year-old boy who thought war was an adventure is one our country needs to remember right now.\n\nSince America began the War on Terror, our country has watched as three presidents have lied about their wars. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, and we now know that American objectives in Afghanistan were in doubt at the highest levels.\n\nThese presidents have ordered troop surges, drone strikes and authorized torture and mass electronic surveillance. Meanwhile, Russia re-armed and North Korea developed nuclear weapons.\n\nCongress has not seriously taken up repealing or changing the original 2002 authorization to use military force that President Trump relied on to assassinate Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3.\n\nThis act of Congress, passed because of Bush’s lies about weapons of mass destruction over 18 years ago, was the legal basis for killing an official of the Iranian government. This is where we find ourselves in our second decade of war.\n\nThis past week we watched another president threatening to go to war in the Middle East with an impulsiveness and bluster not so different from a 15-year-old boy’s.\n\nPresident Trump’s failed “maximum pressure” campaign and the obvious mistake of pulling out of a working nuclear deal has left both America and Iran dangerously short on options. As I write this, American soldiers are deploying to the Middle East, no doubt ready to fight if the president gives the order.\n\nIf left unchecked by Congress and the American people, this president could lead us into a war with more potential for death and destruction than the last. America will be less safe than ever and many could die.\n\nThis time we must listen to what past generations of Americans have to tell us about war, and reflect on the lessons of our own recent history.\n\nNick Bovee-Gazett was born and raised in St. Cloud. He has a B.A. in political science from St. Cloud State University. He lives with his wife, two children and cat in Central Minnesota."
