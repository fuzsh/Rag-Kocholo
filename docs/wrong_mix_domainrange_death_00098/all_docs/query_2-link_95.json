        "text": "(Tikrit) Dec. 15, 2003 - A US commander says Saddam Hussein was captured outside Tikrit Saturday based on information from a member of a family \"close to him.\"\n\nMajor General Ray Odierno says his soldiers had questioned \"five to ten members\" of families close to Saddam over the past ten days. He told reporters in Tikrit that \"finally we got the ultimate information from one of these individuals.\"\n\nOdierno is the commander of the Army's Fourth Infantry Division, which found the former Iraqi leader hiding in a small underground crawl space at a farm near Tikrit.\n\nWith three words – \"We got him\" – Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III announced at a press briefing in Baghdad on Sunday that US forces had captured Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein near his hometown of Tikrit.\n\nSaddam was taken into custody at a small mud-walled compound outside the village of Adwar at 8:30pm December 13th.\n\nAbout 600 members of the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, along with special operations forces, launched Operation Red Dawn after receiving intelligence that Saddam was in the area, said Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of coalition forces in the country.\n\nBremer, the coalition administrator, said it was a \"great day\" in Iraq's history. \"For decades, hundreds of thousands of you suffered at the hands of this cruel man,\" he said. \"For decades, Saddam Hussein divided citizens against each other. For decades, he threatened and attacked your neighbors. Those days are over forever.\"\n\nSanchez described the operation that captured Saddam. The general said it was a cordon-and-search operation, and coalition forces sustained no casualties. In fact, he said, coalition forces never fired a shot.\n\n\"For the last several months, a combination of human intelligence tips, exceptional intelligence analytical efforts and detainee interrogations narrowed down the activities of Saddam Hussein,\" Sanchez said.\n\nSanchez said intelligence pointed to two likely spots where Saddam could be hiding. He said the Americans struck with lightning speed under cover of darkness. The troops initially did not find Saddam. \"As a result, the 1st Brigade Combat Team elected to cordon the area and conduct an extensive search,\" Sanchez said. \"Coalition forces subsequently found a suspicious location.\"\n\nAnother US source says information from Iraqi prisoners and other intelligence tips had led to increasingly precise information and that allowed CIA and military analysts to gradually narrow down the list of potential sites were Saddam was believed to be hiding.\n\nIn the search, U.S. forces discovered a \"spider hole.\" \"After uncovering the spider hole, a search was conducted and Saddam Hussein was found hiding at the bottom of the hole,\" Sanchez said. \"Saddam was captured without resistance.\"\n\nMajor General Ray Odierno says Saddam likely had been at the hut only a short time. New shirts, still unwrapped, were found in the bedroom. The small farm that hid Saddam Hussein was run-down, dirty and rustic with no bathroom and little food.\n\nReporters touring a small hut on the property found a small refrigerator with a few Bounty candy bars, some hot dogs and a can of 7-UP inside. Two more Mars bars were sitting above a makeshift stove. Dirty dishes were in the sink and dirty laundry on the bed. The only decoration in the small building was a poster of Noah's ark.\n\nSoldiers found few clothes: two T-shirts, some trousers and a black Arab robe, along with some black moccasins and a pair of slippers. Saddam himself had been found in a small room under the front yard, which was strewn with rotten fruit, garbage and empty bottles.\n\nCoalition forces moved the former Iraqi dictator to a secure area, and he has undergone medical tests and questioning. Bremer said Saddam was \"cooperative and talkative.\"\n\nCoalition forces also uncovered some weapons and $750,000 in $100 bills. Two other Iraqis were detained.\n\nSanchez called the capture of Saddam \"a defining moment in the new Iraq.\" He said the capture brings closure to the Iraqi people. \"Saddam Hussein will never return to a position of power from which he can punish, terrorize, intimidate or exploit the Iraqi people as he did for more than 35 years,\" the general said.\n\nPresident Bush got first word of the capture day at Camp David. After a raid by US forces on a farm near Saddam's hometown, Tikrit, Saddam was found hiding in a small hole under an outbuilding. But, it wasn't until Sunday morning that officials erased the last doubt as to the captive's identity.\n\nPress Secretary Scott McClellan says the seizure is \"good news for the Iraqi people\" because it shows the deposed dictator \"is not coming back.\" He says Bush was \"particularly moved\" by the cheers of Iraqis when US officials showed video of Saddam in captivity.\n\nUS officials say they still haven't decided what to do with Saddam Hussein now that he's been captured. One option is to put him before a special tribunal established in Iraq just days ago. It was designed to try top members of Saddam's regime for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nOne member of Iraq's Governing Council says Saddam should face a public trial, so the Iraqi people will know his crimes. Ahmad Chalabi tells a Pentagon-funded TV station that \"Saddam will be punished for those crimes.\"\n\nThe US commander in Iraq says the military is continuing to process Saddam at this point and that these issues will be resolved in the near future."
