        "text": "Saddam Hussein's execution has provoked mixed reactions around the world and focused attention on differing attitudes towards capital punishment.\n\nSwitzerland, like a number of other European countries, condemned the serious crimes committed by Saddam Hussein, but disapproved of the use of the death penalty, calling it “unjustifiable”.\n\nThe former Iraqi president, who was captured in December 2003 by American soldiers, was hanged at dawn on Saturday in northern Baghdad following his conviction by an Iraqi court for crimes against humanity.\n\nIn a statement, the Swiss foreign ministry reiterated its firm opposition to the death penalty.\n\n“For Switzerland the death penalty cannot be justified, even for the most serious of crimes. This fundamental position also applies for the case of Saddam Hussein,” it declared.\n\nIt added that Switzerland remains “extremely concerned” by the dramatic insecurity in Iraq and hopes that the Iraqis can “overcome past challenges” and find ways of “ensuring peaceful reconciliation and of building a democratic society”.\n\nMilestone\n\nIn a prepared statement, George Bush cautioned that Saddam’s execution would not stop the violence in Iraq but said it was “an important milestone on Iraq’s course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror”.\n\nThe office of the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, said Saddam’s execution was a “strong lesson” to ruthless leaders who commit crimes against their own people and called on Saddam’s Sunni Ba’athist followers to end their insurgency. Its neighbour Iran welcomed his execution as a “victory for the Iraqis”.\n\nBut for Bush’s allies in Europe, where the death penalty is outlawed, the execution made for uncomfortable viewing.\n\n“You don’t fight barbarism with acts that I deem as barbaric,” said Louis Michel, a member of the European Commission.\n\nAnti-death penalty\n\nWhile all European Union countries oppose the death penalty, key figures in the region were careful not to appear to be pardoning the dictator or criticising Iraqi and US policy.\n\n“The EU condemns the crimes committed by Saddam. The EU condemns also the death penalty,” said a spokesman for the bloc’s foreign policy chief Javier Solana.\n\nBritain, Washington’s closest ally in Iraq, said although it opposed capital punishment, it was Iraq’s sovereign right to apply the penalty.\n\nFrance, which opposed the US intervention in Iraq, avoided either condoning or criticising the hanging. In a statement, it “took note” of the execution but stressed its opposition to the death penalty.\n\n“The German government has always said that there are no doubts whatsoever about Saddam’s crimes. But we are opposed to the death penalty, no matter where it is used,” Berlin said.\n\nLondon-based rights group Amnesty International said the execution was wrong in principle and also because Saddam’s trial was flawed.\n\nArab world"
