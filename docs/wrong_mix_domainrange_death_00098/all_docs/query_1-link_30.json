        "text": "HANOVER, Germany -- Germany believes the rebuilding of Iraq must take place under a U.N. umbrella, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder says.\n\nHe was talking in Hanover at a joint news conference after talks on postwar plans for Iraq with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nSchroeder said humanitarian aid must be provided for the Iraqi people, and order had to be restored.\n\n\"And a third thing it is not a secret that Germany takes the view that the rebuilding of Iraq has to happen under the umbrella of the United Nations,\" he said.\n\nBlair said he wanted the U.N. to have a \"key role\" in organizing humanitarian relief for post-war Iraq, its political and economic reconstruction and its move towards democracy.\n\nBlair said that what was important now was to establish the principle of U.N. involvement. Details could be worked out later.\n\nBlair told the media briefing: \"In each of these areas, I think it is very clear and again here I believe that there is agreement, that in principle the United Nations must have a key role.\n\n\"I entirely agree with Chancellor Schroeder that the important thing is to agree the principle of that role and then discuss between us diplomatically the details of how that role may be fulfilled.\"\n\nBlair said the German Chancellor was a \"good friend\" and whatever the differences before the Iraq conflict \"the state of our bilateral relations is extremely strong.\"\n\nThe talks Tuesday were seen as an attempt to mend a rift between the two leaders, who have been at opposite ends of the debate over the U.S.-led war.\n\nBlair, who committed British troops to the war and has been the main supporter of the U.S. military action, was said to be seeking assurances from Schroeder that Germany will contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq.\n\nSchroeder has seen a rise in his popular support at home because of his outspoken criticism of the war against Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nHowever, that stance has caused concern among German companies who fear they will be miss out on lucrative contracts when rebuilding begins in Iraq. The issue has been aggravated by new signs that the German economy -- Europe's largest -- is continuing to falter.\n\nThis has increased pressure on Schroeder to ease tensions between Germany and pro-war factions -- in particular the United States and Britain.\n\nCompanies in France and Russia -- who also opposed the U.S. led war -- could face similar problems in landing contracts in Iraq.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
