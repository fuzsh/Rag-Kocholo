        "text": "Clutching a Quran, Saddam Hussein went to the gallows before sunrise today Baghdad time, executed by vengeful countrymen after a quarter-century of remorseless brutality that killed countless thousands and led Iraq into disastrous wars against the United States and Iran.\n\nIn Baghdad’s Shiite enclave of Sadr City, people danced in the streets while others fired guns in the air to celebrate the former dictator’s death. The government did not impose a round-the-clock curfew as it did last month when Saddam was convicted to thwart any surge in retaliatory violence.\n\nIt was a grim end for the 69-year-old leader who had vexed three U.S. presidents. Despite his ouster, Washington, its allies and the new Iraqi leaders remain mired in a fight to quell a stubborn insurgency by Saddam loyalists and a vicious sectarian conflict.\n\nPresident Bush called Saddam’s execution “the kind of justice he denied the victims of his brutal regime.”\n\nThe execution took place during the year’s deadliest month for U.S. troops, with the toll reaching 108.\n\nState-run Iraqiya television initially reported that Saddam’s half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, also were hanged. However, three officials later said only Saddam was executed.\n\n“We wanted him to be executed on a special day,” National Security adviser Mouwafak al-Rubaie told state-run Iraqiyah.\n\nSami al-Askari, the political adviser of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, told The Associated Press that Saddam struggled when he was taken from his cell in an American military prison but was composed in his last moments.\n\nHe said Saddam was clad completely in black, with a jacket, trousers, hat and shoes, rather than prison garb.\n\nShortly before the execution, Saddam’s hat was removed and Saddam was asked if he wanted to say something, al-Askari said.\n\n“No I don’t want to,” al-Askari, who was present at the execution, quoted Saddam as saying. Saddam repeated a prayer after a Sunni Muslim cleric who was present.\n\n“Saddam later was taken to the gallows and refused to have his head covered with a hood,” al-Askari said. “Before the rope was put around his neck, Saddam shouted: ‘God is great. The nation will be victorious and Palestine is Arab.’ ”\n\nHe said the government had not decided what to do with Saddam’s body.\n\nPhotographs and video footage were taken, al-Rubaie said.\n\n“He did not ask for anything. He was carrying a Quran and said: ‘I want this Quran to be given to this person,’ a man he called Bander,” he said. Al-Rubaie said he did not know who Bander was.\n\n“Saddam was treated with respect when he was alive and after his death,” al-Rubaie said. “Saddam’s execution was 100 percent Iraqi, and the American side did not interfere.”\n\nThe station earlier was airing national songs after the first announcement and had a tag on the screen that read “Saddam’s execution marks the end of a dark period of Iraq’s history.”\n\nThe execution came 56 days after a court convicted Saddam and sentenced him to death for his role in the killings of 148 Shiite Muslims from a town where assassins tried to kill the dictator in 1982. Iraq’s highest court rejected Saddam’s appeal Monday and ordered him executed within 30 days.\n\nA U.S. judge yesterday refused to stop Saddam’s execution, rejecting a last-minute court challenge.\n\nU.S. troops cheered as news of Saddam’s execution appeared on television at the mess hall at Forward Operating Base Loyalty in Baghdad. But some soldiers expressed doubt that Saddam’s death would be a significant turning point for Iraq.\n\n“First it was weapons of mass destruction. Then when there were none, it was that we had to find Saddam. We did that, but then it was that we had to put him on trial,” said Spc. Thomas Sheck, 25, of Philadelphia, who is on his second tour in Iraq. “So now, what will be the next story they tell us to keep us over here?”\n\nSgt. Elston Miramonte, 25, of Monticello, N.Y., said Saddam got what he deserved.\n\n“All the people that he killed, did they deserve to die? He had a fair trial, and it was time to execute him,” he said.\n\nThe execution was carried out around the start of Eid al-Adha, the Islamic world’s largest holiday, which marks the end of the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj. Many Muslims celebrate by sacrificing domestic animals, usually sheep.\n\nSunnis and Shiites throughout the world began observing the four-day holiday at dawn today, but Iraq’s Shiite community — the country’s majority — was due to start celebrating tomorrow.\n\nAl-Maliki had rejected calls that Saddam be spared, telling families of people killed during the dictator’s rule that would be an insult to the victims.\n\n“Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence,” al-Maliki’s office quoted him as saying during a meeting with relatives before the hanging.\n\nHuman Rights Watch criticized the execution, calling Saddam’s trial “deeply flawed.”\n\n“Saddam Hussein was responsible for massive human rights violations, but that can’t justify giving him the death penalty, which is a cruel and inhuman punishment,” said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch’s International Justice Program."
