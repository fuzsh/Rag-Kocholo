        "text": "The young military policeman sat watching as Saddam Hussein carefully began to eat his breakfast in sections, beginning with the omelet (which he’d reject and send back for a new one if it was “torn” in any way) before moving on to a sugary muffin.\n\nSpecialist Chris Tasker could hardly believe he was there, sitting across from the man, only a few years removed from a snowy morning at basic training when a drill sergeant had pulled the trainees inside to see the breaking news: Hussein had been captured. Tasker and the other recruits had let out a loud cheer. Some feared the war would be over before they even had a chance to deploy and put their training to use.\n\nNearly three years later, Tasker was one of about 140,000 troops deployed to Iraq. He was one of only 12, though, whose primary responsibility was guarding — really, caring for and living alongside — the former dictator in the months leading up to his execution.\n\nTasker noticed that Hussein had a sweet tooth. The young soldier had begun to pick up on his human idiosyncrasies — some trivial, some more revealing — and he wasn’t quite sure what to make of them. He supposed it made Hussein less intimidating, that he could yield to the siren call of a sugary muffin the way anyone else might.\n\nHussein then lit a cigar.\n\nHe seemed remarkably content, perhaps because for the first time in decades he was able to rest comfortably without fearing, as one of his young American minders put it, that “someone in his security detail would cut his head off in the middle of the night.”\n\nTasker watched as Hussein, clad in his dishdasha, walked over to his rickety exercise bike.\n\nTime to ride my pony, he said spiritedly.\n\nHis pony was in fact little more than “a crappy old bike like you’d find at Goodwill,” another of the guards recalled.\n\nHussein fixed his gaze on Tasker and flashed his devilish grin.\n\nHe patted one leg, said, “This leg gazelle,” and then patted the other one, saying, “This leg not gazelle.” He paused briefly, still smiling, and concluded, “Once I get stronger, and am a full gazelle, I am going to jump that fence outside and escape.”\n\nAs I spent two years working on my book about American guards assigned to care for Hussein, my mind kept circling back to just how peculiar their assignment was: to keep him as healthy and content as possible until it was time to hand him over to be killed. On an intellectual level, they knew that Hussein had been responsible for terrible bloodshed, but they had never seen Hussein commit these crimes. Instead of the “crazed madman” they had expected to encounter, “holding the bars of his cell and shouting, ‘Death to America!’ ” they came to know a kindly older man, whose company reminded a few of their own grandpas.\n\nTheir stories resonated with me. I never quite reconciled how, back in 2006, I could have cordial weekly meetings with a local Iraqi leader in the violent city of Hit — complete with chai tea and relaxed laughter — all the while aware of his links to the insurgency. Conversely, he knew that Americans had killed his brother in a firefight. And yet, there we were.\n\nI remember growing fixated on the most random things — how he hitched his pants up towards his belly the way my father sometimes does, the way he would pause after a bad joke, seemingly eager for approval. It was these peculiar idiosyncrasies that made him — that make all people — human. I wondered how it was that we could seemingly get along well in person, and yet return to our separate beds after those relaxed meetings, lay our heads on our pillows, and discover over the next morning’s coffee that our guys had killed some of their guys, or vice versa.\n\nThese thoughts were on my mind as I sat across from another one of the soldiers who had guarded Hussein. He was 10 years older now, and had carved out a comfortable life for himself and his young family. But he was still troubled by the execution. As we nursed our beers, this tough, tattooed veteran of numerous deployments could at once casually show me pictures of dead insurgents, half-joking, “You never forget your first,” and then grow emotional when remembering his time with Hussein and the ugly execution. His compartmentalization of these experiences is not as bizarre as it seems, but instead reveals how it is more difficult to play a role in the death of someone you have grown to know than to shoot at an anonymous enemy target.\n\nAnother of Hussein’s young guards, a broad-shouldered former linebacker from outside Cleveland, told me, “It didn’t really hit us until we had time to distance ourselves, but once the dust settles and you’re lying in your bed at night, your mind wanders, and you think: Did I really just do that? We’d gotten so close to him … .” At that point his voice trailed off. “I feel like I let him down,” he whispered.\n\nIn Norwegian author Geir Angell Øygarden’s book “Bagdad Indigo,” an American soldier says, “My enemy doesn’t have a face. He has, I guess, a target on him. I don’t see a human being. I can’t see a human being.” Military training necessarily conditions soldiers to see things this way.\n\nGetting to know the enemy subverts this process. Hussein’s interpreter, known as Joseph, said, “Will I miss Hussein the brutal dictator? Of course not. But will I miss sitting in the evening with him as a human being? Yes, I will.”\n\nIronically, Hussein seems to have been immune from this human resistance to killing, as he unflinchingly dispatched so many to violent ends. When he discovered that his two sons-in-law had defected to Jordan, he grew obsessed with punishing them. Foolishly choosing to return, they would quickly meet their end in a grisly shootout. When informed that the young men had been killed, Hussein reportedly shook his head and said, “I can’t think how they could have left Iraq, and I certainly don’t understand how they could have thought of returning.”\n\nIn fact, they had returned because he had invited them, assuring them they would be welcomed as family. They had trusted him, inexplicably confident that his familial affection would trump his anger. Like so many others who miscalculated Hussein, they were wrong, and would pay.\n\nIn perhaps the ultimate sleight of hand, Hussein appears to have had no conscience, but to have succeeded in getting others to examine theirs.\n\nWill Bardenwerper of Denver is the author of “The Prisoner in His Palace: Saddam Hussein, His American Guards, and What History Leaves Unsaid,” published this month by Scribner.
