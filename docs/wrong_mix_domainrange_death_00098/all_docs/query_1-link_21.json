        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Ambassador Paul Bremer interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thank you very much for coming to Charlottesville.\n\nBremer\n\nNice to be with you.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd for all of your labors in helping us with the briefing book and the timelines. We’re delighted to have you here. A couple of administrative chores—we already talked about the confidential nature of the proceedings before we got on tape. As an aid to the transcriber, though, we need to go around the room and introduce ourselves. I’m Russell Riley, chair of the Presidential Oral History Program.\n\nNelson\n\nI’m Michael Nelson. I teach at Rhodes College and I am a senior fellow here.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m Mel Leffler. I am a professor in the history department.\n\nPerry\n\nI’m Barbara Perry. I am a senior fellow in the Presidential Oral History Program here at the Miller Center.\n\nBremer\n\nI’m Paul Bremer.\n\nRiley\n\nOne additional preliminary note. Anybody who comes to the transcript in the future ought to use your book, My Year In Iraq, as an essential starting point. This is an extremely valuable piece of work about your time. As I noted to the group yesterday, it actually liberates us in some respects because we don’t feel compelled to try to dot every I and cross every T in the chronology. That allows us to bore down on some things as well.\n\nYou have a couple of interesting items on your résumé in advance of 2000. A lot of interesting things, but two that are particularly relevant to us. That is, the antiterrorism piece under the [Ronald] Reagan administration and then the Bipartisan National Commission on Terrorism, which I think must set the stage for some of what comes later. So I’d like to ask you a little bit about your experiences there, what you were learning in those experiences, and maybe how they bore on your experience in Iraq later.\n\nBremer\n\nThe Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism position at the State Department ironically was due to President George Herbert Walker Bush. There had been a bombing of first the Embassy and then the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. At the time I was already overseas as Ambassador to the Netherlands, but President Reagan asked then-Vice President Bush to chair an interagency organization to say we’re facing some kind of a new threat here and how should we organize the American government.\n\nBush’s recommendation was to create a senior executive level-two position at the State Department with interagency responsibility, Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism. It required legislation. George Shultz, who at that time was Secretary of State for whom I had worked before I went to the Netherlands, tried to recruit me for the job of Ambassador-at-Large.\n\nThat’s a long story, unrelated to this. In any case in the end I agreed and came back from the Netherlands to take that job. I didn’t seek it; in fact I was rather reluctant because my research had persuaded me that every State Department person who had been working on counterterrorism—the first one was established after the hijackings in 1969-1970—every one of them had not only not gone on to a good job in the State Department but had never gotten any other job in the State Department. So it did not look like a career-enhancing move to me to take this job. In any case, the Secretary and the President asked me.\n\nI did feel strongly then that we did face a threat for which the American government was not well organized, as Vice President Bush’s study had shown, and that it required something unique, which was the integration of the various parts of the national security apparatus to deal with the threat. Indeed, at the State Department I had a unique setup, something that had not happened at State before, and rarely since, which was an interagency office based in the State Department. I had representatives from the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency], Joint Chiefs of Staff, Special Forces, and so forth, all of them working for me directly at the State Department.\n\nSo the interagency experience and dealing with terrorism was an important one. I stayed engaged in wrestling with the problem of terrorism during the 1990s when I was out of government. I had retired and was working in the private sector, but I stayed engaged with various studies and in the end was asked by then Speaker of the House [Newton] Gingrich to chair the National Commission on Terrorism. It came into being after the attacks on two American embassies in East Africa in 1998. Congress now felt that we were not organized to deal with the new threat.\n\nSo I headed up the National Commission. What we found and what we reported was that we faced a new threat. It was not like the terrorism that I had been fighting in the ’80s, and I can go into more detail. In any case the new threat was Islamic fundamentalists and particularly al-Qaeda. We highlighted that threat in our study, which was delivered to President [William J.] Clinton and released to the public in June 2000.\n\nIt was borne in on us—we were ten, it was a bipartisan commission, five appointed by the Republicans, five by the Democrats—that this new threat was something serious and the American government was not organized to deal with it. Our findings were met with resounding silence in the political classes until 9/11. But it certainly was an important part of the background to me of the lead up to 9/11 and then the consequences of 9/11.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there acquaintances that you made in either of those two positions that continue into the period of 2003 and 2004?\n\nBremer\n\nWhen I had been Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, Rich Armitage had been the Assistant Secretary of Defense for—I think it was called ISA [International Security Affairs] at that time. I don’t remember exactly what it was. [Oliver] Buck Revell, who was subsequently more senior in the FBI, was there. Bill Webster was a friend and director of the FBI and then subsequently of the CIA. All of them eventually came back to play. Colin Powell became National Security Advisor while I was Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism.\n\nIn the Commission on Terrorism we interviewed all kinds of people, including George Tenet, who at that time was already head of the CIA. In establishing and setting up the Commission on Terrorism I had conversations with Don Rumsfeld, whom I had known from the [Gerald] Ford administration when I was [Henry] Kissinger’s chief of staff, because Rumsfeld had just chaired the commission on Missile Defense. I needed some guidance. He gave me some ideas about how to staff the operation and how to get the job done. One of my emphases as chairman of the national commission was I wanted us to have fully agreed findings if possible. I didn’t want to have everybody footnoting this part and that part. I talked to Don a bit about how to try and get a unanimous report, which we did with one minor footnote.\n\nI was involved a bit with Rumsfeld. I don’t remember whether I had any interaction with [Richard B.] Cheney. Cheney had been a classmate of mine at Yale, though. Like [Edward] Stettinius [Jr.] he didn’t make it the whole way through. The best thing that ever happened to him from a political point of view was getting expelled. He wasn’t going to get elected in Wyoming being a Yalie.\n\nLeffler\n\nLet me ask you; when you say your report was met with resounding silence, did you make any efforts to communicate your findings directly to the new people in the Bush administration?\n\nBremer\n\nNot immediately. They were obviously pretty busy the first few months. They had the U.S. P3 go down in China. They were pretty well tied up. I was frustrated, as were the other members of the commission. Ironically I had lunch on September 10, 2001, with Jane Harman, who was one of the leading Democrats on the commission and who was at that time out of Congress. We were both very frustrated, I even more than she because she was a Democrat. I didn’t feel that the Bush administration had really seized on our report. We didn’t expect an awful lot from the Clinton administration because we issued our report early June 2000 and they were in the middle of the election campaign. The administration at that point was winding down, although they did have the attack on the Cole on their watch.\n\nJane and I agreed on September 10th that we would seek a meeting with Cheney in the next couple of days to try to get some attention focused, and of course the next day was 9/11.\n\nLeffler\n\nIn that period from January to September did you yourself make any efforts to communicate this report, to invite a meeting with [Stephen J.] Hadley, with [Condoleezza] Rice, with Powell, with Armitage, with any of those people?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I think I may have had a conversation at some point in that period that I don’t remember with either [I. Lewis] Scooter Libby in the Vice President’s office or with Paul Wolfowitz, who may or may not by that time have been confirmed. I don’t remember the timeline. But no, I didn’t know Condi very well. She was in the first Bush administration, but I retired from the State Department about six months into the first Bush administration. I think I had met her, but she had been on Soviet matters, which wasn’t my area.\n\nLeffler\n\nNone of the people approached you, invited you, or anything of that sort?\n\nBremer\n\nNo.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo this says something about perceptions, threat perception. One might extrapolate from that that these folks were not putting terrorism high on their agenda during these first few months.\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t know. I don’t have any firsthand knowledge. I know that Richard Clarke has alleged that he tried to get attention.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBremer\n\nI have no firsthand knowledge of that.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you know Clarke?\n\nBremer\n\nYes, I knew Clarke. That’s a good point. Clarke, back in the Reagan years—I don’t remember if it was the first or the second administration—he was at State doing political-military matters. So I knew him from my Ambassador-at-Large Counterterrorism period as well.\n\nRiley\n\nWas he someone the commission had consulted?\n\nBremer\n\nYes, I think he testified before us. You’d have to look; I’m pretty sure he testified.\n\nRiley\n\nYou wouldn’t have had conversations with him about trying—\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t remember talking to him about it.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there, in the course of the commission, proceedings or reports? You said that the nature of the threat had changed. Was it your sense that the proximity of the threat or the magnitude of the threat had also grown and that—\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd a secondary question is about—we get from the later commission reports this phrase “hair on fire,” with people trying to figure out how can I from my own perception of the threat create a sense of alarm in others who are in responsible positions? Did you feel like you had your hair on fire at the time?\n\nBremer\n\nI’m not usually a hair-on-fire type of guy. I think, from the period roughly 15 months from when we reported until 9/11 it was more a sense of deep frustration. All ten of us felt that we had put our finger on a real threat and that neither administration, neither the Clinton nor the new Bush administration, had been seized with the matter. It wasn’t something people talked about. Bush at that time was still, as I recall, portraying himself as the education President. In fact he was sitting in a classroom when the 9/11 attack happened.\n\nI’ve been through a number of Presidential transitions in my time in the State Department and I knew there is always a cadence to a new administration. For the first six months a new administration is desperately busy trying to figure out what they’re trying to do, trying to get people confirmed, which is now more and more difficult. The President is trying to figure out who he can trust. The first crisis always brings out the strengths and weaknesses in your team, in the case of the P3 in China.\n\nSo I was frustrated, but I guess somewhat realistic that you can’t expect a new administration to tackle everything at once. There has to be a sense of priorities and it takes time to get there.\n\nLeffler\n\nOne of the interesting things about your report is the lack of focus on Iraq. You identify in your counterterrorism report key threats coming from Iran, Syria. You note with prescience the problems of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But it is remarkably silent about Iraqi links to terrorists in light of what would become the huge preoccupation of Iraqi links with terrorists during 2002 and 2003. I just invite you to comment on that. Did you not see what others saw? Do you think what others saw greatly exaggerated the issue, or what?\n\nBremer\n\nThe focus of our attention was on Islamic extremism. That was not the problem with Saddam [Hussein] then or afterward.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut the focus was on terrorism.\n\nBremer\n\nOur focus was on a new threat. We identified the new threat as Islamic extremism effectively coming from Sunnis like al-Qaeda and the Taliban. So it’s not surprising. I knew Iraq—I had been in charge of counterterrorism policy. Iraq had been designated a terrorist state by various American administrations for a long time. So it was no surprise that Iraq was a terrorist state. But it represented in many ways the old-style terrorism as we looked at it, not the new-style terrorism. So I don’t find the lack of focus on Iraq surprising given that the intellectual context we were looking at was a new kind of terrorism, which was not what Saddam was doing; he was an old kind of terrorist. He was basically a secularist. He wasn’t an Islamist.\n\nPerry\n\nI was just going to say you had hoped to meet with Vice President Cheney and then 9/11 happened before you could meet with him.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nPerry\n\nWhat would you have said to him?\n\nBremer\n\nI think Jane and I both felt that we needed to say, “You ought to go back and take another look at what we focused on—” which was if you looked at the pattern of what the new terrorists had said from really late 1988, 1989, but in the 1990s and what they had done, they were exemplifying a new kind of threat— “and you need to deal with it. You need to organize the government to deal with it. You need to put the intelligence assets on it” and so forth.\n\nHe might have said, “We’re doing all that.” I don’t know. Anyway, the meeting never happened, at least that meeting.\n\nNelson\n\nIt strikes me that you entered government and came in at a time when there had been a series of Presidents who entered office with a great deal of Washington experience.\n\nBremer\n\nWhen I went back into government, you mean. When I entered government it was 1966. You’re talking about when I came back into government?\n\nNelson\n\nWell, ’66, but also when you started working for Kissinger, Presidents were Washington figures. In [Richard M.] Nixon’s case, with a great deal of interest in foreign policy. Then the rest of your career with the exception of Bush 41, a series of people who became President coming out of state politics, domestic agendas first and foremost on their minds. I wonder, did you notice that it was more difficult over time to get Presidents to focus on foreign policy as a matter of choice?\n\nBremer\n\nI think one should be a bit careful in making a general statement like that. Gerald Ford was not a foreign policy President, although his instincts were pretty good. Reagan actually turned out to be an excellent foreign policy President. Although it may not have been his formation, he effectively brought down the Soviet Union. So I think one should be careful not to make too sweeping—it is certainly true of [Jimmy] Carter and Clinton that their focus was primarily domestic.\n\nNelson\n\nLet me clarify. All Presidents get interested in foreign policy because—\n\nBremer\n\nOf course, it’s there.\n\nNelson\n\nIt’s there, but not—you described George W. Bush as starting out with perhaps less interest in that, which is unsurprising given the fact that like Clinton, like Reagan, he had been elected primarily with domestic policy agendas.\n\nBremer\n\nJust to be precise, I didn’t say he had less interest. What I said was that my understanding from just reading the newspapers—I had not met him after all—was that he was styling himself as the education President in those first months. That was his focus.\n\nPerry\n\nAlong with—\n\nBremer\n\nIt would be fair to say he didn’t have a lot of experience in foreign policy. That is certainly the case. He had been the Governor of Texas.\n\nLeffler\n\nI want to change the topic a little bit and ask you about your background. One of the things that attracted me was the fact that you got your MBA [master of business administration degree] at Harvard in the mid-’60s. I ask you the following questions because a few years later George W. Bush got his MBA from Harvard, and there are a number of people who think that what Bush learned at Harvard about management and leadership would shape his style of decision making. I’m just curious, did you take any lessons away from your years at Harvard Business School that would shape the way you would orient yourself in the future, especially when you were in an executive decision-making place?\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo what did you learn there that shaped your style?\n\nBremer\n\nI have written and said that the Harvard business school uses the case method entirely. There are no lectures. To me the case method was the most exciting pedagogical experience I had in my educational career because it really forces you to think on your own. It forces you into an analytical taxonomy that requires you to identify a problem, identify alternative courses of action, evaluate the various courses of action, and make a decision or a recommendation depending on where you are. That is not a normal approach in foreign policy circles. The normal approach is more theoretical, more how do international relations work, what can we learn.\n\nSo to me it was, I think, in the end, actually quite helpful to my career in the Foreign Service because it gave me a way of—as it turned out, since I worked on the staff of Secretaries of State and Secretaries of State are not very interested in—neither are Presidents—in theoretical constructs; which are not very useful. In fact, I say to my friends who are teachers, in all the years having worked with eight Presidents and nine or ten Secretaries of State, I never once heard somebody walk into the Oval Office and say, “Mr. President, according to international theory,” What you do hear somebody say is, “Mr. President, you’ve got a problem and here’s a solution.” That’s what a President wants to hear, or a Secretary of State.\n\nThe approach, not so much a management approach as an intellectual approach to problem solving, is what I took away from business school. I think it helped because a lot of times when a Secretary of State calls a meeting he has a problem. He is not interested in somebody else coming in the room with another problem. What he needs is solutions. Or he needs a recommendation to give the President. If you can approach international relations or whatever that way, that can be helpful.\n\nLeffler\n\nWorking for Kissinger and Associates, whatever the firm was called throughout most of the ’90s, what issues did you focus on that you could extrapolate, and maybe the answer is none, to your subsequent issues that would challenge you in Iraq? Anything?\n\nBremer\n\nThat’s an interesting question. What we did at Kissinger Associates was basically help our clients, who were CEOs [chief executive officers] of large Fortune 100 companies, try to understand the political and economic dynamics of a place, usually a developing country, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Brazil, and what the implications of that were for their business decisions. That was the value-added that we brought.\n\nOn some occasions we would help them negotiate the investment they wanted to make. Those were more skills that drew on my foreign service. They were more backward-looking skills because those were the skills you have as a Foreign Service officer. “What is going on in this place and what does it mean for America and how do we get to success”—whatever that’s defined as. I don’t know whether it had any additional impact on my approach to subsequent matters.\n\nLeffler\n\nDid you do much in the ’90s in that capacity in Middle Eastern countries?\n\nBremer\n\nWe had a few clients interested, mostly in the Maghreb. We had a couple of cases in the Gulf states and India, but not in the Middle East itself, though I traveled a fair amount with Henry in the region on his travels to Egypt and Israel. Of course I’d been to all of those countries when I was his chief of staff on the shuttle diplomacy. Kissinger Associates didn’t have real business in the area except for the Maghreb, but that’s not the Middle East.\n\nLeffler\n\nSomewhere I read that you spent some time in Afghanistan, is that correct?\n\nBremer\n\nIt was my first Foreign Service assignment. I was there for two years.\n\nLeffler\n\nWhat years were those?\n\nBremer\n\nSixty-six to ’68. The King was still there.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat was that like, briefly?\n\nBremer\n\nIt was a lot of fun, actually. We were young and recently married.\n\nRiley\n\nYour wife went with you?\n\nBremer\n\nOh, sure, yes. It was more or less a safe place in those days. We enjoyed it a lot. It was very primitive.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo what did you know about Iraq? One of the standard criticisms of your approach or your year in Iraq was that you were appointed and you weren’t a person who had much knowledge of the country or the region. You’re aware of that.\n\nBremer\n\nI’ve heard it.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s probably in the briefing book.\n\nBremer\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo reflecting back, what did you know and what things did you not know that turned out to really be harmful to your experiences there?\n\nBremer\n\nFirst of all you can make an argument that it is an advantage not to know that much about it. I was not an Iraq expert. I did have Iraq experts on my staff, including Ryan Crocker, Hume Horan, John Sawers from Britain. I don’t take it as dispositive that it is important to have actual expertise in the country as long as you have people around you. I had lived in the region. I had traveled to virtually every country in the region except Iraq. I knew about Iraq and had studied Iraq as part of the counterterrorism battle in the 1980s and then to a lesser extent in the ’90s. Of course it would have been better if I had had more time to prepare.\n\nI did read as much Iraqi history as I could in the very brief time before I went, which was only a couple of weeks. Would it have mattered greatly if I had known more? Perhaps. You can almost always use more time to learn more about a place. I have never seen a convincing argument that my lack of deep Iraqi experience actually made a difference.\n\nThere are people who disagree with things we did, but there are always going to be people who disagree with things we did.\n\nRiley\n\nCan I ask you to elaborate on the point that you started with? You said that you could make an argument that an absence of expertise is neither an advantage nor disadvantage. What do you mean by that?\n\nBremer\n\nI’ll tell you what I mean by that. It’s interesting because it does come to George Bush a bit. I believed and have believed for a very long time that most people want to be free, that representative government is the best way to ensure people’s freedom and that any culture is capable of freedom. I point out that when I lived in Afghanistan in the 1960s people said, “The Afghans are completely incapable of anything other than a monarchy; the writ of Kabul has never reached south of Ghazni. These people can never be democratic.” They’re living under a constitution today. Yes, it is a messy place, but today Afghanistan has a representative government.\n\nWhen I was Henry’s chief of staff in the ’70s there was a lot of attention on Korea. “The Koreans are a patriarchal society, a hermit kingdom. They’ve been at it for 3,000 years. They’re never going to be a democracy.” Today Korea is a democracy. When I was working for Henry in the ’90s, Indonesia was the big subject. All the experts got it wrong again, arguing, “There were 13,000 islands, a complete mess. You’ve got Hindus and Muslims and Animists and God only knows. This place can only be run by a dictator like Suharto.” Well, today Indonesia is a large, thriving, Muslim democracy.\n\nIn every one of those cases the so-called experts, the people who knew about Afghanistan, who knew about Korea, who knew about Indonesia, were the ones who said they can never be democratic. So I think you can make an argument that sometimes being a so-called “expert” can get in the way of seeing the more fundamental truth; that people are capable of representative government, including the Iraqis.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m impressed by those comments. But Henry Kissinger, especially in the 1970s and ’80s, was not renowned for his belief in the potential of people to be democratic.\n\nBremer\n\n[mimics Kissinger’s voice] Well, I’m not Henry Kissinger. [laughter]\n\nLeffler\n\nDo you remember advocating this position? You tell us about cases that eventuated this way, but are there concrete examples you could illuminate in your own career in the 1970s and ’80s where you, on the record, promoted in an active way, efforts to promote democracy?\n\nBremer\n\nIn the ’70s I was strongly in favor—in the ’70s the question really was what do you do about basket three in the CSCE (Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe), the promotion of human rights more generally speaking.\n\nLeffler\n\nOnce again, I don’t remember Kissinger thinking—\n\nBremer\n\nNo, you’re right. I disagreed. I can’t say I predicted it would have the effect it did have in Czechoslovakia, but it turned out to be quite a powerful thing. Certainly in Afghanistan, where I had lived, I felt particularly during the ’80s that the Afghans deserved an opportunity to put together their own government and said so. I was not responsible for Afghan policy, so what I said was essentially irrelevant, that was not my writ.\n\nNelson\n\nI’d like to make an observation about a couple of things you said and then ask you to respond. Earlier you were talking about the valuelessness of international relations theory in terms of interacting with policymakers, sort of the case method, focus on the particular. But you just made an incredibly sweeping philosophical statement—\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\n—which President Bush often made, that all people want to be free. It is a statement about human nature and the best way of achieving that freedom is representative government, which is a sweeping statement about human society. So isn’t there a lot of theory underlying the sort of hard nuts and bolts decisions you’re making?\n\nBremer\n\nEvery pragmatic approach is going to be embedded in some kind of a philosophical approach. So whether you call it a theory or a philosophical approach you have an intellectual construct, which is in this case human nature suggests people want to be free, and experience, not theory, shows that representative government is the best way to enforce that freedom. I don’t think that’s a theory. That’s experience. I think that is demonstrable, starting with the American experience. So I don’t find a contradiction.\n\nThe case method approach then says OK, how do we advance that goal? People try to trap you into saying one approach has to fit everything. That’s not the way it works in foreign policy. We’re taking a different approach in Syria from the one we took in Libya. Do we care as much about Chad being democratic? Is that as important to America as Iran? No. So you have different approaches. But you can have, call it a theory, philosophic, whatever you want to call it, I call it factual evidence, that people will be better off if they have freedom.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you or were you approached by anybody in the Bush administration about taking the position when they transitioned in in 2001?\n\nBremer\n\nI think I referred earlier in response to something Mel asked. I did have conversations with Libby and Wolfowitz. I think with Libby before 9/11, sometime in that period, about whether I’d be interested to come back into government and I said, “Well, it depends on what there is.” Then after 9/11 again I talked, I think again to Libby and I know again to Wolfowitz, about the possibility of doing something. This was all before the Iraq invasion.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBremer\n\nThis is perhaps 2002. They talked about maybe CIA or something like that. It never got very concrete and I presume neither of them was authorized to offer anything anyway.\n\nRiley\n\nAt the top of CIA?\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nAs the director? OK. I was just going to ask. I think you made a brief reference to how you’d known Libby, but I’m not sure we know how you had known Wolfowitz.\n\nBremer\n\nPaul was policy director when Al [Alexander, Jr.] Haig was Secretary of State and I was Al’s chief of staff. So I knew him from 1981, ’82.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou knew Libby from where?\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t know when I met Scooter. He was around in the foreign policy crowd at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Institute of Mideast Studies. I don’t remember when I met Scooter. I do remember when I met Paul.\n\nRiley\n\nWhere were you on 9/11?\n\nBremer\n\nI was in an airplane trying to get to New York.\n\nRiley\n\nNo kidding.\n\nBremer\n\nFrom Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have any contacts with Washington officialdom in the immediate aftermath presumably in relation to the commission work?\n\nBremer\n\nYes. It is a bit of a cloud at this point, but I was running a business in New York for Marsh & McLennan and I had conversations with a lot of people in those days. I had a lot of press and a lot of conversations with people.\n\nNelson\n\nMore mundanely, how did you find out what happened, and how did you interpret what happened based on the work you had been doing on terrorism?\n\nBremer\n\nI had been working in New York for 12 years but living in Washington, so I commuted regularly. I don’t like New York. I was flying on the Delta shuttle that Tuesday morning, 7:30 or 8:30—I guess the 8:30 shuttle. Since I flew it regularly, I knew the pattern. I didn’t have to look up from my newspaper, I could tell they were circling over Philadelphia. It was a clear day over Philadelphia. There was a woman sitting next to me. I said, “I guess we’ve got a delay in LaGuardia or something.” The Captain came on and said, “A plane has hit the World Trade Center and we’re in a holding pattern.” I said to the lady, “That’s strange, because LaGuardia is closed.” The plane, I was thinking, it’s a Piper Cub, it goes in, why would you close LaGuardia, which is 12 miles away?\n\nIn those days there were phones on the airplanes still, so I got on the phone and called my assistant in New York to tell her it looked like we were going to be late. She happened to be looking downtown (Marsh & McLennan’s building was on 6th and 46th). She was looking downtown as we were talking and she said, “Oh, my God, another plane has hit the building,” or words to that effect. She was in tears. So I hung up and I said to the woman, “We’ve got a big problem. We’re not going anywhere near New York. This is a major terrorist attack.”\n\nThe captain then came on and said, “We’re running low on fuel so we’re going back to land in Baltimore.” Running low on fuel on the first flight of the day? [laughter] We got on the ground in Baltimore and the captain came on again and said, “The President has declared a national emergency. You can get your onward flights from the Delta people.” I ran into a friend of mine and told him there was no way we were going to get out on another plane. He and I literally commandeered a taxi at the airport to get us to Washington. I was doing press already on the way. As we were driving back to Washington he had CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] News on and Dan Rather said, “Oh, my God, there goes the second tower.” When we got near Washington, we could see the smoke rising off the Pentagon.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you say, “driving back to Washington,” to where in Washington?\n\nBremer\n\nTo home, Chevy Chase. You couldn’t get into the city at that point.\n\nRiley\n\nSo between that interval and April of 2003 you have a commission appointment that comes in, right? I don’t recall the sequence.\n\nBremer\n\nOh, the President’s Homeland Security Advisory Commission—I don’t remember when that was.\n\nPerry\n\nIt says June 2002.\n\nRiley\n\nSo that’s not a major item on your résumé?\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m just curious. I think Mike was trying to get at this. As the person who wrote one of the key—and by the way, I do think your report is a really good report, prescient in many ways—but as the author of this report after 9/11, no one calls you in to talk to you? That’s what you were trying to get at?\n\nNelson\n\nYes.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m just curious about that.\n\nPerry\n\nThe press was calling.\n\nLeffler\n\nThis is a guy who has really studied this problem. I don’t understand—\n\nBremer\n\nIt is possible somebody did, but I don’t remember. It was a very busy time. I don’t remember going into anybody’s office to talk about it. It’s possible somebody called me on the phone, but I just don’t remember. I think you’d probably have to say no. At least it didn’t make an impression on me.\n\nPerry\n\nSo what was your thought about the team, about the President himself? We haven’t talked about the election of 2000 and what your thoughts were now about President George W. Bush. Now, after 9/11 what is your thought about the President, the team he has assembled around him, particularly given the fact that people have not followed the recommendations of the commission or don’t seem to be interested from your perspective.\n\nBremer\n\nAt that point I wasn’t looking to point fingers at people. To me we had a major national crisis, and the question was how can the President lead us out. I just paid attention. I thought his speech to Congress was still one of the great Presidential speeches. I think it was September 20th or something like that. He had troops on the ground in Afghanistan right away. They took three weeks. To me, they were doing the right things. So it wasn’t a question of “well, we told you so.” That wasn’t the point. The point now was how do we go? I thought that he had shown decisive, bold leadership in that period.\n\nLeffler\n\nOne of the criticisms of course of the administration during late 2001, 2002, is that policymakers took their eyes off Afghanistan and started focusing on Iraq and they hadn’t really dealt effectively yet with al-Qaeda but were reconfiguring the focus toward Iraq. Did you at that time share that view, or do you remember yourself as yes, we really need to go after Saddam, that’s the next object here?\n\nBremer\n\nYou may be right. I don’t remember people saying that we weren’t focusing on Afghanistan in 2001 because we were focusing on Afghanistan in 2001.\n\nLeffler\n\nNo, I’m saying after December 2001—\n\nBremer\n\nIn other words, 2002?\n\nLeffler\n\nNo, after December 2001, Taliban are dispersed.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nSome are fleeing to Pakistan, a few going to Iran and elsewhere. There is a major criticism in the literature. Peter Berger and others have said one of the problems during this period of time, from late 2001 into 2002, was the refocusing and recalibration of attention toward Iraq rather than cleaning up the situation—\n\nBremer\n\nIt is easy in hindsight to make arguments like that. One of my favorite sayings in American history relates to a Virginian, Robert E. Lee, who after the Civil War was asked about the war and he said, “One of the things that amazed me was how all of the best Southern generals instead of leading troops during the war became professors.”\n\nI didn’t have a view one way or the other about whether we finished the job in Afghanistan. I certainly was sympathetic to the problem and the focus on Iraq because Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, had a WMD [weapons of mass destruction] capability. The real problem, as we had pointed out in the national commission, was you had terrorists who were, unlike the old ones, prepared to kill by the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, which was not the case of the terrorists we had faced in the ’80s. If they could get their hands on biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological weapons they had the capacity to carry out that kind of thing.\n\nAs we looked at the list of states that had relationships with terrorists, Iraq was the one, the only one at that time—actually Libya had used chemical weapons in Chad in 1986—but basically Iraq was the only one that had had and had used WMD. So to me it was an appropriate focus. Now whether you should have also focused more on Afghanistan—\n\nLeffler\n\nWhat does that mean? This is what I’m really trying to get at. Were you a proponent of going to war to promote regime change, or were you more focused on trying to get inspectors into Iraq to assess whether there were WMDs?\n\nBremer\n\nFirst the second, second the first. First continue the efforts through the UN [United Nations] to get inspectors in, but certainly at some point in 2002, midyear, I don’t know exactly when, it was pretty clear that was not going to work. Saddam had consistently violated at that point 16 UN resolutions. He had lied about his WMD. We found out about his whole biological program only when defectors told us about it.\n\nSo as 2002 went along—and again, I’m not familiar with the timeline of the Bush thinking on it because I was not in government—I was sympathetic to the idea that time was certainly running out on the effort to get more inspectors in and try to deal with it in a peaceful way. At a certain point you come to the end of the line where that isn’t going to work anymore. So by the end of 2002, as they started to move troops into the region, it seemed to me it was not likely that the negotiating tract was going to succeed. Moreover, it was clear that a similar policy of ritual condemnation, international “isolation” and tight sanctions had had virtually no success in stopping North Korea’s drive for nuclear weapons.\n\nRiley\n\nIn the course of 2002 are you being consulted by anybody in the administration on a formal or informal basis on this or on any other foreign policy issue?\n\nBremer\n\nI just don’t remember. Not intensely enough to make an impression.\n\nNelson\n\nThe sequence in Afghanistan after the Taliban was overthrown was not appointment of administrator but really quick transition to Afghan self-government, then the writing of the constitution. Did you think that was the right way to go at the time? When you eventually were an administrator in Iraq did you think the U.S. course of action in Afghanistan a valuable one in terms of lessons to be learned?\n\nBremer\n\nI have to search my memory a bit here. It struck me that the goal of what we were trying to do in Afghanistan was appropriate. That is to say, try to give them some kind of a political structure, a constitution or something, to build a political framework. It became—I have to go forward to when I was in Iraq. It seemed to me there was some press speculation that we should follow the same pattern in Iraq. Basically, they’re not comparable.\n\nFrom a structural point of view you had the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, which gave you a base that was intersectarian, although largely northern tribes. They were able to come together and agree as exiles to a new constitution relatively quickly. This option was forestalled in Iraq immediately by [Ali al-] Sistani and his fatwa that any sovereign Iraqi government had to be elected. So unless we were going to go directly against him—he represented the most important Shi’a voice—we weren’t going to be able to follow the Afghan model. If you looked at the country’s metrics, though, I didn’t spend a lot of time on this analysis at the time—I have since reflected on it—the metrics are actually more favorable in Iraq than they are in Afghanistan on every single measure. Iraq is more highly educated, it is more urbanized, has a deeper history of central rule, albeit not recently friendly central but at least central rule, which is not the case in Afghanistan, even under King Amanullah Khan. He didn’t really reach very far out. So I don’t think there really is much for the argument that the model in Afghanistan was applicable to Iraq, though I can’t say I spent a lot of time wrestling with that at the time.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut at the time in late 2002, early 2003, before you were approached for a position, I’m inferring, just from listening to you, correct me if I’m wrong, you weren’t really paying substantial attention to these issues. You’re an educated, well-informed guy reading the newspaper, talking to friends, but it’s not like you were really deeply immersed in Afghan or Iraq issues in 2002, early 2003.\n\nBremer\n\nCertainly not in 2002. By 2003 I was certainly paying attention to Iraq, just because it was of interest.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo let’s turn now to early 2003, before your appointment. Were you in contact with folks in the State Department on any regular or even irregular basis? Were you talking to Bill Burns? Armitage? Any of the key people there?\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t remember conversations with them. I know again I had a conversation with Wolfowitz, I think it is in my book, and I think I also had another one with Libby. That was in either January or February, somewhere in there, before the kinetic operation started. I don’t remember talking to anybody at State.\n\nRiley\n\nThe conversations with them in January, February were—\n\nBremer\n\nIt was again kind of vague early on: “There might be something for you in the administration.” I’m not sure Iraq came up that early. It came up again in March when the U.S. government got more serious about thinking about it.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember much of the conversations then about the initial approach on this appointment? You indicate in the book that it is Wolfowitz and—\n\nBremer\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRiley\n\nTelephone call, or—?\n\nBremer\n\nA couple of calls, and I had a meeting with Paul in his office at DoD [Department of Defense]. It must have been after March 19th that I met Wolfowitz. It could have been before they started the war. I just don’t know.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us about that.\n\nBremer\n\nAt that point it was more specific. It was talking about going over to Iraq and heading up whatever it was going to be. I don’t know if it even had a name at that point. They were thinking—It was a separate conversation with Libby too. They were thinking in terms of It’s 90 days, go over there for 90 days, sort the thing out.\n\nI said, “Ninety days? How is that going to work? If it develops, be in touch.” Then there was a subsequent conversation, which is referred to in the book, where Wolfowitz called me and said, “We’re now getting ready, thinking about—” again, I don’t know. I can’t remember. I think that must have been after the war started. He probably—and I’m now guessing—was putting together a list for Rumsfeld, putting together some names, “Would you be interested?” That’s when I had the conversation with my wife saying, “Look, it’s getting kind of serious now. I’m either going to say yes or no and I’ve got to know if you’ll go along with it.”\n\nLeffler\n\nDid you speak to other people about is this a job I should take? Were there people—\n\nBremer\n\nNo, because it was confidential. The next I heard, some Wednesday afternoon in April my office got a call from Rumsfeld’s office saying can you come see the Secretary tomorrow afternoon. That was the next thing I heard.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nBremer\n\nNow, Rumsfeld says in his book that Shultz gave him my name, which I didn’t know actually until I read Rumsfeld’s book. Anyway, that’s possible. Kissinger claims he gave Rumsfeld my name.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you wonder whether a position like this was necessary? There hadn’t been a comparable person since World War II.\n\nBremer\n\nSince [Lucius D.] Clay, yes. When the question was raised it was not clear to me—in fact, it hadn’t been decided by the UN—that we were going to be called the “occupying power.” So it wasn’t clear what the position was. It was sort of a Presidential Envoy. That told me something, because I’d been a Presidential Envoy. That’s what Ambassadors do. The “occupying” part came in later, when the UN passed the resolution formally designating us as the occupying power.\n\nSo it wasn’t in my mind, at least at the phase when I was deciding whether I would put my name into it, what exactly the title would be. I certainly didn’t know anything about the occupying power.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember your discussion with Rumsfeld?\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us what you can about that.\n\nBremer\n\nWe met alone.\n\nRiley\n\nIn his office?\n\nBremer\n\nIn his office at DoD. He had a list of names of people. I didn’t see it, but there were 15 or 20 names on there. He must have already done some checking, because the main thing I remember him saying, and again I wrote in the book, was he wondered how I got along with the other members of the national security team. I went through it in the book. Then he I guess said something about that.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you say? You mentioned earlier you didn’t really know Condi Rice.\n\nBremer\n\nShe was the only one I didn’t know, and the President. I had never met the President. I’d met the President on the Domestic Homeland Security Commission. That’s a lot of people sitting around a table. But I knew Colin from the time he was V Corps commander when I was Ambassador to the Netherlands. I also knew him as National Security Advisor. I had known him a long time.\n\nCheney had been a classmate at Yale. I didn’t know him there, but I knew him when he was Chief of Staff to Ford. Rumsfeld I had known as Secretary of Defense and then he came back as a Special Envoy under Reagan to deal with Saddam Hussein. I had met Condi. I didn’t really know her, and I had never met the President.\n\nRiley\n\nSteve Hadley.\n\nBremer\n\nTenet I knew. Hadley I knew as one of that crowd that moved around in foreign policy circles in Washington in the ’90s. I knew him, but not well.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo Secretary Rumsfeld, did he talk to you mostly about who you knew? Did he talk to you about what he wanted to accomplish, what he wanted you to accomplish? What he thought were the greatest challenges?\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t remember, frankly. There must have been some substantive conversation, but what I remembered distinctly was that he was going to run the traps with the other guys and then let me know. As I said, I got the impression he had made up his mind for whatever reason. I don’t know.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd at that meeting you said if you chose me I’ll take the job?\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nBy that time was it a well-defined position or was it still sort of nebulous as to exactly what—\n\nBremer\n\nIt was still nebulous, at least to me. As I wrote in the book, I was somewhat surprised to hear that Condi thought that Zal [Zalmay] Khalilzad would still be involved in some fashion, which as you know I took up with the President.\n\nRiley\n\nHe was the Presidential Envoy.\n\nBremer\n\nHe was a Presidential Envoy. As I said, all of my experience in the Foreign Service taught me unity of command. You don’t have two Ambassadors in a country at the same time. There is one Ambassador who represents the President and there are other people. So I’m trying to answer your question about was it nebulous. I thought that was a little bit nebulous and it needed sorting out.\n\nThe title—I have a vague memory that in meetings in Rumsfeld’s office after the President made the announcement there was some back-and-forth about what the other position was going to be called. Was I going to be an “administrator,” a “counselor”? The coalition, provisional authority—\n\nNelson\n\nNot Viceroy.\n\nBremer\n\nYes, what was my title going to be? I frankly was agnostic. They came up with “administrator.”\n\nNelson\n\nWhat was your relationship going to be with the operation Jay Garner was running over there?\n\nBremer\n\nIt was understood that Jay was going to leave. He was scheduled to leave, I think, June 15th. I don’t know if he had a contract. I don’t know what it was. I was told that he was planning to leave on June 15th; he told me he was planning to leave on June 15th. As I wrote in my book, my subsequent understanding was that they had always intended for there to be a shift, but I presume other members that you interview will tell you more about that. But there was always planned to be a shift.\n\nJay had been chosen because he had done such a good, tough job in the north during the period of the no-fly zone and he knew a lot of people up north. He was able to retire as a three-star. He was chosen I think largely because—and again, as you all know from your research—planning for the postconflict period, planners, like generals, plan for the last war. They had planned basically on the assumptions that they would face the same kinds of problems we faced in 1991. Humanitarian relief, large-scale—burning oil fields and all that. It was called ORHA [Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance]. That’s what they thought they were going to be facing, and therefore Jay was a logical choice in the run-up in January, February.\n\nIn any case, it was understood that Jay was planning to phase out by June 15th and then, as I wrote in the book, he was not well handled, I think, by the administration.\n\nLeffler\n\nWhen did you have that initial meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld? Do you remember the date? I’m not clear on that date.\n\nBremer\n\nIt was a Thursday in late April. You can find the date very quickly. Look at the President’s schedule on the Fridays because we went and saw the President the next day at ten o’clock or something. That’s when he offered me the job.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo it’s the very next day that you met with the President.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd then had lunch with him.\n\nBremer\n\nI had lunch a week or ten days later. The lunch was on May 6th. That I know for sure.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nBremer\n\nSo let’s do the math here. April has 30 days. You can figure it out.\n\nLeffler\n\nWe can figure it out. That first meeting with the President when he offers you the job is a short meeting, yes?\n\nBremer\n\nYes, it was short, 15, 20 minutes only.\n\nRiley\n\nSo there is still not a great deal of definition about the job description.\n\nBremer\n\nWell, I think there was description about part of it, which was Presidential Envoy. The title of CPA [Coalition Provisional Authority] at that point I don’t think had been decided, with me designated as “administrator.” There was still floating in the atmosphere this question about Zal Khalilzad. My position was clear; the question is what is the rest of it.\n\nRiley\n\nSo what were the main components of your job description then as you understood it as a Presidential Envoy, for those of us who don’t traffic in those terms all the time?\n\nBremer\n\nThe title itself doesn’t quite describe it in this case because it’s not a standard, bilateral diplomatic relationship. What I came to understand it to be—and I can’t tell you at which meeting because there was a pretty intensive two-week period—was helping the Iraqis get control of the country again. There were three aspects of that. Helping them get on a path toward better government; helping them get the economy back on its feet; and, though it wasn’t my responsibility, providing security. But that was certainly part of the overall strategy.\n\nMy focus in the discussions—the briefings before I went over there were largely on the political aspect, discussions about how long it was going to take. This 90-day thing that I had heard before had by then disappeared. I have my own view on how that happened, but anyway it happened. Most of the discussions were on the responsibility to get the Iraqi political process started, with the economy being the second.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo essentially you’re given the position in the last days of April. May 6th you have this lunch with the President. So you have about a week, at the most nine days, before you speak to the President. Flesh out what you were doing during those eight, nine days. Who did you go speak to? What were you learning? What were you reading? Tell us something beyond your book.\n\nBremer\n\nI should have brought, but I didn’t—I may have it on my computer. Somewhere there is a list of the meetings I had.\n\nLeffler\n\nDo you have any recollections of ones that stand out in your mind?\n\nBremer\n\nIt was just drinking from a fire hose.\n\nRiley\n\nIf you can send us that we’d be happy to use it as an appendix to this document. It would be very helpful.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat would be very useful.\n\nBremer\n\nI may have it and may be able to give it to Katrina [Kuhn]. I’m not sure I have it on this computer. I can’t remember which meetings stood out. I do know I met people from State, from CIA, from DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], obviously from the Pentagon, the military side, the civilian side. It was just a 24-hour-a-day thrash.\n\nLeffler\n\nDo you remember extrapolating any generalizations from that week? When you meet with President Bush and you talk about it on the 6th, one of your major preoccupations seems to be making sure you establish unity of command and your control of the situation. There isn’t a great deal of discussion, from what it seems, about substantive issues, so I’m wondering what you’re defining. Are these the issues you’re defining? One of the things that strikes the listener is that already at that point in time there is enormous preoccupation with security and with looting and with disorder, with instability. Yet you’re telling us that this was not primary consideration number one on your mind.\n\nBremer\n\nFirst of all, it wasn’t my responsibility. I was not in the military chain of command. I was not responsible—\n\nLeffler\n\nLet me pursue that, because that is a really interesting issue. As you read the literature on this, one of the interesting aspects is that when you arrive in Iraq, at least all the military folks with whom you deal think that you want to establish your authority. They all report to you. You’re the number one person. They all feel that you are asserting your responsibility and they also believe that you take actions that in some ways undercut their ability to establish security. So on the one hand you’re saying that’s not your preoccupation; on the other hand they say that you have established yourself as the head of command for all intents and purposes.\n\nBremer\n\nThat’s just nonsense. First of all, that’s the first I ever heard of it. They never bothered to tell me that when I was there.\n\nLeffler\n\nHave you read General [Ricardo] Sanchez’s memoir?\n\nBremer\n\nNo.\n\nLeffler\n\nI urge you to read it because you might want to write a rebuttal.\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t have to write any rebuttals. My record stands. A lot of people afterward have a lot of ideas about what they think and said. I was very clear. I’ve been an ambassador. The law establishes very clearly what the role of an ambassador is—Section 22, CFR something, something. It very clearly states that an ambassador has authority over all American citizens in the country except those military officers who are under direct command of a theater commander. I didn’t need any lesson from any generals to understand how it works.\n\nThe President asked me to write my instructions. I pulled out 22 CFR, which I had received as an ambassador when I went to the Netherlands, and basically that document, with a few modifications, described exactly what my responsibilities were and exactly limited where my authority ended, which was any military in the country under the command of a theater commander, which included every single military person who was under such a command. So there was never any question in my mind then or now that they did not work for me. If they thought they did that’s their problem, not mine.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us—again, this is a gloss on Mel’s question. You’re in this rush of meetings as you’re getting ready to go overseas, the development of the relationship with the Pentagon and your expectations about your communications channels back into Washington. I think part of what Mel is getting at is the sense of some dissonance between the expectations on the part of the White House and on the part of the Defense Department.\n\nLeffler\n\nThere are two different issues here. This is a very important one. One of course is lines of communication with Washington.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nThe other is interactions in the theater. But I think your query is extremely important, and one which, again, the memoirs are very complicated because there is just incredible disagreement.\n\nBremer\n\nLet me finish on the military side because I didn’t quite finish, in fairness to Mel.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBremer\n\nAs I said in the book, I think everybody in Washington and I realized that there was going to need to be coordination in the field between the political and the military. Since I was not in the chain of command as Clay had been and [Douglas] McArthur had been the last time we had done occupations. The problem had been finessed because basically it was the military guy in charge in Germany and a military guy in charge in Japan.\n\nWolfowitz signed an order—he was acting, I don’t know where Rumsfeld was— that established that the military in Iraq should pay attention to my desires as “commander’s intent.” In the military lexicon, commander’s intent means “it’s not an order but the commander would like this kind of thing to happen. See if you can make it happen.” So there was an instruction to the military, which was dealing with a difficult situation. They were operating in a highly political environment, to try to at least factor into their actions the direction the political leadership was giving to them. But anybody in the military who thought I was in the chain of command was not reading the law. That’s simply wrong, flat wrong. I understood that. I had been dealing with that issue for 30 years. It was no surprise to me.\n\nCommunications to Washington. The President—I can’t remember whether he used the words “Report to me through Don,” or exactly what the words were, but that was clear. The decision as you know had been made in January to put the responsibility for the post conflict, whatever it was going to be, in the Pentagon, not in the State Department. I actually think that was the right decision. Most of my State Department friends disagreed, but I think it was the right decision.\n\nIt was the right decision for two reasons. One of them goes right back to Mel’s point, which is that you had a civilian and a military chain of command in Iraq. If you put the civilian part in the State Department, then effectively when there were disagreements the only place in the chain of command where those two things could be adjudicated was the President, because he was the only one who stood on top of both of those chains of command. On the other hand, if you put past conflict responsibility in the Pentagon, at least in theory those two chains go through the Secretary of Defense. So the President is able to devolve authority down a level, which from a policy point of view is probably the right thing to do, and in effect that is how we had done it in Germany and Japan.\n\nSecondly, with the rather well-documented disagreements between Powell and Rumsfeld, if you had put the post conflict into State, which was not wildly enthusiastic about the whole process, of going into Iraq because all the experts there knew the Iraqis could never be democratic, you were going to exacerbate the internal personal differences. So I thought it was a good idea to put it in the Pentagon.\n\nThe President said, again, I can’t say if he used the words, “Report to me through Don, and of course you always have Condi as well.” She and Rumsfeld and Powell were at the meeting with the President where he offered me the job, I think. It may be that Powell was not there and Armitage was. Anyway, you can find out from the record. It will show. I don’t remember. But it was clear that I was to report through Rumsfeld.\n\nNelson\n\nHad the Khalilzad complication been sorted out?\n\nBremer\n\nAt our lunch I said to the President, “You can’t have two Presidential Envoys,” and he said, “I understand.” It got sorted out. Khalilzad was still in Iraq at that time. Eventually he left before I got there.\n\nLeffler\n\nJust to project ahead a little bit, but following up on this question, once you would get to Iraq, summarize for us over the first few months how often—you say your instructions were to report to the President through Rumsfeld. How often did you talk to Rumsfeld?\n\nBremer\n\nIn the first weeks, pretty much every day.\n\nLeffler\n\nDaily? For how long? I mean, on a typical day.\n\nBremer\n\nIt depends, 15 minutes, 45 minutes? Again, his records will show.\n\nLeffler\n\nDuring this time did you talk much to Rice?\n\nBremer\n\nNo. I think I might have a record of that, but I think I did not talk to her before we met with the President in Qatar, which was three weeks after I got to Iraq. She was with him; that was June 5th or 6th. I don’t think I spoke to her in those three weeks. I didn’t speak to her regularly until she set up her Iraq Support Group in October. She says, by the way, in her book that she had her first meetings, I just noticed that in this excerpt, in September. That’s news to me because the first I heard about it was in October, as I wrote in my book, when it was on the front page of the New York Times. I didn’t even know she had the group.\n\nRiley\n\nStay with your line of questions, but I owe our guest a break.\n\nBremer\n\nI’m OK. If someone else—\n\nRiley\n\nWe’re going to take 2-3 minutes here.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nRiley\n\nOK, we’re back.\n\nBremer\n\nI wanted to come back to Mel’s question about meetings. I do remember—I will get you a list, but it’s in the book. Again, the meeting I had with Jim Dobbins, an old friend from the Foreign Service who had just completed the draft of this Rand study on the need for more troops, which also addresses the question of security. Both the President and I have accounts of it in our books.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m following up on these questions with regard to communications between you and Baghdad and Washington policymakers. You said you had daily discussions with Rumsfeld. For the most part you did not speak to Rice at all for the first three months. Did you talk to people at the State Department on a regular basis, on an occasional basis?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, not at that point. I had people from the State Department who were on my staff, so I spoke to them all the time, Ryan Crocker especially, Hume Horan, Pat Kennedy. I did have email exchanges with Colin Powell before he came out to visit. To go back, I came back to Washington for consultations at the end of July and I met everybody then, including Powell and Rice and Tenet and the rest of them. Then Powell came out on a visit in September.\n\nBasically, the State Department communications were through people who were working with me in Iraq.\n\nLeffler\n\nI see. Rumsfeld says that you were very skillful at playing off top bureaucrats, including himself, in Washington. He writes in his memoir that you were not in frequent contact with him, that he often did not know what you were doing, that he was often caught by surprise. Should one take these generalizations—I could bring in the memoir and read you specific sentences. Take my word for it, that’s what he says.\n\nBremer\n\nI take your word for it.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd people who study this are a little perplexed by what seem to be diametrically opposed statements. Eventually we’ll get a record. We’ll be able to see every phone call, but it is going to take a long time.\n\nBremer\n\nIt’s hard to know why he would say that. The record is pretty clear. I don’t have, as he will have, because I didn’t have the staff to do it, a record of every phone call I made, although I have pretty good notes. He was kept regularly informed by phone, by telegram, by letter. I don’t know exactly what he was surprised about. I’d have to know what actually surprised him to know whether it was something I did without telling him.\n\nRiley\n\nThere is one episode, Mel, again we’ll sort of jump out of the chronology, but there was an article that you published either in the Washington Post—\n\nPerry: The op-ed.\n\nRiley\n\nSix or seven steps forward.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\nHe says he didn’t know about it, and even though he had just been with you, you didn’t tell him it was coming.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat’s just one example. That’s in September if I recall, September 8th or something like that.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nSo the floor is yours.\n\nBremer\n\nI know that this is an argument that [Douglas] Feith made in his book. I prepared in my timeline a very extensive list of the number of times—I counted them, I didn’t give you the full chronology—but there were at least 39 times between my arrival in Baghdad and the writing of this editorial that I informed the U.S. government explicitly of our process—in writing, on the phone, in letters to the President, in speeches both in Washington and Amman. I just found the other day, a New York Times op-ed which I published on July 13th, which repeated the process. In other words two months before. These communications explicitly laid out the entire process that we were following. So it’s hard for me to understand how anybody in a position of authority in Washington could say that they were surprised, frankly. If they were surprised, I really don’t understand how anybody could say that.\n\nLeffler\n\nLet me ask this question on communications. Did you speak to Doug Feith much on the phone?\n\nBremer\n\nNo. Rumsfeld wrote, I understand in his book—Feith asked—no, I guess it was in Feith’s book. Feith asked to be the guy on the other end of the phone and Rumsfeld said no. End of story.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo you didn’t speak to Feith. You didn’t speak to Wolfowitz much?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I spoke to him when he was acting, and of course he visited.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd you didn’t speak on any frequent basis to Armitage or to Powell or to Bill Burns? The people who were with you like Crocker, et cetera, may have been doing that.\n\nBremer\n\nI assumed they were; that’s their job.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut not you.\n\nBremer\n\nMy job was not to do interagency coordination, as I kept reminding people. We had our hands full doing what we were doing in Iraq. Since my channel of communication was to the Pentagon, to Rumsfeld, my assumption was that he, working with Rice or not, was going to take the responsibility of being sure the Treasury Department knew we were doing X and the Agriculture Department knew we were doing Y and Powell knew we were doing Z. That was not my job. Everybody—those offices, Treasury, State, Defense, CIA—they all had people in Baghdad. They were informed of what we were doing. I assumed they were communicating back to their head offices. That was not my job. I never saw interagency coordination as my job. Now, was it effective in Washington? That’s another question.\n\nLeffler\n\nActually, the larger point I think is not interagency coordination. No one expects you to be doing interagency coordination.\n\nBremer\n\nSome people apparently have.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat would be totally unreasonable.\n\nBremer\n\nI agree.\n\nLeffler\n\nHowever, the rationale for this course of questioning is one that perhaps you would have thought that these folks back in Washington had something to offer you, Powell or Armitage or Rice. But secondly and more importantly, because there seems to have been an absolutely basic philosophical difference between what Feith and Rumsfeld say they wanted to accomplish, and that is devolving authority quickly to the Iraqis, and your preoccupation with moving slowly and systematically to create a framework. Of course you justify your approach by saying, well, I told President Bush it was going to take me a long time to do this. This is a long process. It is going to take a while, and President Bush said, “Don’t worry. I’m going to stick with you.”\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nOn the other hand, you convey the sense that everybody agreed with this.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nYet Rumsfeld and Feith believe that you acted in great violation of the spirit of what they sought to accomplish.\n\nBremer\n\nWell, the policy I was carrying out was the policy of the President of the United States. It wasn’t my policy. It wasn’t something I made up. The President speaking, right here, Rumsfeld on the 9th of May says in his memo, “The transition from despotism to a democracy will not happen fast or easily. It cannot be rushed.” That’s Don Rumsfeld speaking on May 9th. Does that sound like a man in a hurry?\n\nThe President of the United States at the NSC meeting the same day says, “It will take a long time to reach our desired outlook, and the U.S. will take the time necessary to produce a credible political process.” That is quoted both in Feith’s book and mine. That was the President’s policy. Now I can go through the chronology.\n\nMy first letter to the President—all the letters I sent to the President were submitted through the Secretary of Defense. Is it likely that the Secretary of Defense would forward a letter from me to the President without reading it? My first letter on the 22nd of May said, “I have relaunched the political dialogue with the Iraqi leaders. My message is that full sovereignty under an Iraqi government can come after democratic elections which themselves must be based on a constitution agreed by all the people. This process will take time.” The President wrote back the next day and said, “I agree.”\n\nI can go through it. There are 39 separate times just from my unclassified records in which anybody in Washington who was reading the mail or the phone calls would have understood that the President’s policy was to put in place a process that would allow the Iraqis to reach democratic government and that that required a constitution which would be ratified by the Iraqi people and then sovereignty would end.\n\nOn July 4, 2003, I sent Rumsfeld the first version of the CPA’s strategic plan. It would not have been clearer about the planned political process. It said we would “encourage the Iraqis to write as quickly as possible a modern constitution…. The constitution will then be ratified, elections held for a sovereign Iraqi government at which point the coalition relinquishes sovereignty.” I knew Rumsfeld read the plan because on his web page he has posted a note he sent, with the plan, to Feith, saying it looked good to him. By the way, this strategic plan was hand delivered by Don to all 535 Members of Congress two weeks later, on July 23.\n\nI’m just going to read one more. On the 13th of July I wrote a memo to Rumsfeld conveying the names of the governing council and I outlined again, “The political process of getting a constitution followed by a referendum, then elections, will lead to the dissolution of the CPA.” I repeated these points in a New York Times editorial the same day. Does the Secretary of Defense read the New York Times? It is simply not credible for somebody to say they didn’t know what the process was, and in any case it wasn’t my process, it was the President’s process.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me try coming—\n\nBremer\n\nThere is a separate question. Why do they say they were surprised on September 8th? That’s a good question.\n\nRiley\n\nI wanted to come at this from a slightly different angle, that there was a not very fully developed planning process that Feith was running before you came into office. My understanding is that it was predicated on the notion that Mel articulated, trying to find a quick transfer of power to the Iraqis.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me put the question to you this way. Inevitably at some point you are required to confront the reality that there is a process that was going on when you came on board. How do you become cognizant of this process and momentum and what do you have to do, if anything, to alter the momentum that exists for that process once you come into your position?\n\nBremer\n\nI have to answer this two ways; what I knew then and what I have learned subsequently.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nBremer\n\nThat dichotomy between what the President said his policy was and what was going on on the ground became clear to me in two ways before I left. I think, again, they’re both in my book. One was just before I left, when Garner told the press he was going to put a government in place the next week, May 15th, which was to me a complete disconnect from everything I’d heard in Washington from Secretary Rumsfeld, from the President, from the Vice President, from the Secretary of State, who were all talking about taking the necessary time to get this thing right. Garner is telling the press he is going to appoint an interim government the next week. Something was amiss.\n\nSecondly, somewhere in that time frame, that same first week or so of May, I had my briefing, “in the tank,” from the Chiefs who showed me their plan to draw down—I think we had 180,000 American troops on the ground at that time—to 30,000 by September 1st, which also struck me—having read Dobbins’s paper—as disconnected from reality.\n\nMy interpretation of what happened—now I’m telling you what I’ve come to learn or think since then. Feith says in his book that the President in a meeting in March, the 14th, before the kinetic phase started, was presented with a “fast option” and a “slower option,” the fast option being the one I guess Feith was suggesting, involved handing over to Iraqis quickly, which explains why at some point I had heard this 90-day notion, though I didn’t know this at the time. There was an alternate process apparently, again, according to Feith, more supported by the State Department and CIA, that said, “No, it’s going to take longer. We have to take our time.”\n\nThe President, according to Feith, in that March meeting said he favored the short option. At some point, and you’ll have to ask the President, at the end of March or early April, in that time frame the President switched to the slower option. How he switched or why I don’t know. I never had a chance to ask him. At the time I didn’t realize there had been this struggle. I just knew something was screwed up because Garner and the Chiefs seemed to be working on a timetable inconsistent with the President’s.\n\nLeffler\n\nWhy do you say at that time he switched? On what evidence?\n\nBremer\n\nThe plain facts of life. On May 6th—\n\nLeffler\n\nOK, on May 6th.\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t know when it happened.\n\nLeffler\n\nOn May 6th when he is talking to you and you say to him—\n\nBremer\n\nCertainly not later than that time.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou say to him it is going to take time and he says yes.\n\nBremer\n\nYes, but—\n\nLeffler\n\nHow well developed is this thinking by President Bush?\n\nBremer\n\nYou will have to ask him because other people have told me that the analysis is right and that the switch came sometime around the fall of Baghdad, which was April 9. At that time I was not in government so you will have to ask other people.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nBremer\n\nIn any case, by the time I was in government the President was clearly on the “go-slower” option. Now, was that memorialized in some fashion with an NSDD [National Security Decision Directive]? Was it communicated to Garner and Khalilzad who were out still apparently pursuing the short option?\n\nRiley\n\nWas it communicated to Defense?\n\nBremer\n\nThese are good questions. As I say I only learned about this subsequently by reading Feith’s book, so I can’t say I knew it at the time. I knew something was amiss when I heard about Garner. I knew there was something wrong. I knew what the President’s policy was, and it wasn’t consistent with what Garner was saying. I couldn’t have been more meticulous in reporting through Rumsfeld back to Washington my understanding of what was needed, which was this process called the Seven Step Plan. The seven steps were outlined as early as my letter to the President, which I submitted to him through Rumsfeld, May 22nd.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd Rumsfeld never said to you on the phone or otherwise, “Jerry, this is going to take too long”?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, that’s the other point that I’ve made in my subsequently written op-eds. In this time frame from when I left, May 10th to September 8th, nobody in the administration—not the President, not Rumsfeld, not Powell, not Rice—nobody said, “Hey, you’re not following the right policy.” Nobody. There was virtual silence except that the President said he approved. So the only thing that I could assume as I beavered away out there, I was carrying out the President’s policy and there was agreement with it. Nobody ever said they objected until the op-ed came out. Now the question is why did they suddenly get their hair on fire? I don’t know. It is inexplicable to me.\n\nLeffler\n\nI just want to follow up on this. What makes you think that the President had a really clear policy, that this was something he had really thought through? It seems to me that just reading the materials that exist that one can see that when Rumsfeld talks to President Bush and he says. “We really need to get out of here as quickly as possible. We don’t want to get involved in nation building. Our military is stretched thin, Tommy doesn’t really want to do this to begin with,” and Bush seems to convey, “Sure, that’s right.”\n\nThen you go in and say to the President, “This is going to take a long time, Mr. President. We really need to work on this systematically,” and he says, “You’re right, Jerry. You have as long as you want.” Is there reason to think that President Bush really had a clear policy? That he had thought this through?\n\nBremer\n\nThe policy was absolutely clear to me, no question. I only subsequently have heard about the discussion that went before. So to me it was very clear. I didn’t ask to see a decision paper. I wasn’t looking for a 40-page memorandum on what it was going to take to do it in Iraq. I assumed that the National Security Council would have prepared the President and he would have made the decision.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me follow up, and forgive me, Mike, you had a question. The follow-up on this is, one might have expected you to get some incoming, if you will, from Feith’s operation or from someplace else about why things aren’t progressing more quickly.\n\nBremer\n\nI told you, I never heard from anybody until after September 8th, it was the first I heard that anybody in Washington had any concerns about what I had been reporting and saying publicly. I had said it to the Congress. I said it in my strategic plan to Rumsfeld in July. If people objected they never said anything. I can’t explain it.\n\nNelson\n\nThe report you got from Jim Dobbins seems to suggest you needed a lot more troops instead of a lot fewer.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you passed that information on to the President he said he was working on it.\n\nBremer\n\nRight. He said Colin Powell was working to line up additional allied troops. In the excerpt you gave me he was slightly more detailed than I had in my book. I didn’t know what he did. Apparently he did ask Rumsfeld about it.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you think might come of that? Did anything come of that?\n\nBremer\n\nYes, something did come of it. At that time we had—again, the record will show, maybe eight or ten other countries with troops on the ground. We eventually had 30 countries with troops on the ground. So at that time it was, at least to me, a reasonable answer to say what I wrote in my book, that Colin Powell is working on it, he is trying to get some more people in. That sounded reasonable. It made sense to try and get some other countries to come in there.\n\nNelson\n\nYou had, in terms of resources, five or six people whom you chose, roughly 400 or so who were already there whom you inherited, and then 170,000 or so troops on the ground. Did you want any of those numbers to change? Did you think any of those numbers needed to change in order for you to do the job effectively? Did you need more personal staff? Did you need more and better career staff? Did you need more and better troops, and did you expect to be able to get these things?\n\nBremer\n\nLet’s deal with them one at a time. On troops, I felt we needed more troops and we needed a different strategy, which I also wrote about. We needed basically a counterinsurgency strategy. That was consistent throughout my entire stay there and is pretty well documented.\n\nThere really was another CPA staff in addition to the American staff. There was staff from 25 other countries among the 3,000 people who eventually worked for me. We never were staffed beyond 56 percent of our requested staffing. So we never had adequate staff, at least as we defined it. Would it have made a difference? Yes, it would have helped to have had more staff. But the more important question was to have the right security in place.\n\nNelson\n\nWas there any chance at all given the political environment that the United States would be sending additional troops after winning the war?\n\nBremer\n\nIt depends on how you define winning the war.\n\nNelson\n\nWell, you know, “Mission accomplished.” To the American people there was a sense that we had won now and presumably the number of troops would start going down. Did you think politically you could undo that expectation?\n\nBremer\n\nMy view was that as a Presidential Envoy, I owed the President my unvarnished view of what was needed and he got it from me both in terms of the Iraqi political process and in terms of the number of troops. He was paid to make the decision of what the domestic political process could bear. He was facing reelection. It was up to him to make those judgments. I was obviously sensitive to the fact that he had to face those. My job was to give it to him straight. That’s what a good Ambassador does.\n\nLeffler\n\nHow often did you do that on the troop issue? You raised—\n\nBremer\n\nVery often. I raised it with Rumsfeld, I raised it with the President, raised it with Dr. Rice and Hadley, raised it again with the President, mentioned it to [Andrew] Card.\n\nNelson\n\nLet me frame the question this way. You were speaking to Rumsfeld every day.\n\nBremer\n\nYes, for at least the first couple of months.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo how many of those days would you say that you said, “Mr. Secretary, we really need more troops”?\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t know.\n\nLeffler\n\nGive me a sense. Was it something you would say to him daily?\n\nBremer\n\nNo.\n\nLeffler\n\nIt’s easy to say, “There is this quote, I brought it up,” just like Rumsfeld has selective quotes. I think what the historical record needs to show, since this has become such a big issue—\n\nBremer\n\nYou’re talking about troop strength?\n\nLeffler\n\nTroops and the security situation, because we need to shift to Iraq and get your impressions of what you were seeing there during this very period of time. How often did you say to Rumsfeld on the phone, speaking daily? Did you say to him once a week we need more troops?\n\nBremer\n\nI probably raised it more often with him in the September, October, November time frame than in the summer.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat’s what the record would indicate.\n\nBremer\n\nIn the summer, until the bombing started in early August, we didn’t really have what you would call an insurgency, at least we certainly didn’t see it. The shape was not there. I raised it frequently with him by the end of September. Again, it is in my book. When I was writing my book, the guy I was writing with, we were talking about this time frame, he said, “You already wrote that.” I said, “I know I already wrote it, but I said it to him again. It was the same discussion over and over in September and October.”\n\nWhen the military was facing the planning for the 15-brigade rotation they had them do in the spring of 2004, and they were talking about drawing down and trying to replace their troops with Iraqis, I have it I think only once in the book, but it literally came up—I wouldn’t say daily, but at least weekly—I mentioned it to the President when I saw him in late October. The military was essentially saying you can count these untrained Iraqis the same as the guys from the 101st or the 82nd, which in my view was a dangerous way to think about it. That came up over and over and over in September and October. How many times I don’t know.\n\nRiley\n\nJust for a point of clarification, it is clear for a first-time reader of your book that there is a great deal of attention to the troop rotation driving these decisions.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nMy question, as a matter of clarification—you were pushing before then not to preserve strength but to increase the base numbers of troops that were there. Is that correct?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I didn’t call for more troops until much later after I made the point to the President and Rumsfeld based on the Dobbins report that we didn’t have enough on the ground. I did then ask for MPs [military police] to secure—that’s in the book. [John] Abizaid sent, I don’t know, some MPs up there. Certainly by September I was trying to preserve the numbers. I also pushed for a more coherent counterinsurgency strategy. By the spring of ’04 I thought we needed more troops.\n\nNelson\n\nDid private companies, Blackwater and so on, make up much of the slack that you saw there? For a time there I think there were as many of them as—\n\nBremer\n\nNo. Well, I don’t know how many they had on the ground. In September I did authorize the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and the Ministry of Electricity to hire guards to guard their facilities because we didn’t have enough troops to guard pipelines and power lines. They weren’t private contractors. They basically went out and hired tribes to guard facilities. I don’t remember that the American contractor base was that big at this time. They were guarding me, Blackwater was, but I don’t remember great numbers of them. Maybe they were around.\n\nNelson\n\nA lot of them were handling logistics, the kitchen work—\n\nBremer\n\nKBR [Kellogg, Brown & Root], sure.\n\nNelson\n\nSo the soldiers who were there were all presumably free for the kind of duty one would want them to do.\n\nBremer\n\nYes, I’m sorry. I misunderstood. I thought you were talking about security. No, that’s true, KBR was there, no question about that. We tried to solve the infrastructure security problem by authorizing the ministries to go out and hire security forces, and they hired thousands of people.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me ask you to talk a little bit about your relationship with the military side of this, which is sort of woven in and out. You’ve got, as you already mentioned, a bit of a complication in the unity of command or the chain of command problem, because there are two of you.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us about your relationship then with the military side. When you get over in Iraq is it the way you expect it to look? How much of this is driven by your personal compatibility with the chief? Are their perceptions about military strength the same as yours?\n\nBremer\n\nWas it as I expected? Yes, I think the structure of it was basically as I expected. I arranged that Sanchez would have an office in the palace just down the corridor so that we had at least some connection. The first meeting I had every day was with Sanchez and the station chief and the military intelligence guys. Then he also came to the bigger staff meeting right afterward, so I saw Sanchez regularly.\n\nThere were some hiccups early on, with I think the Marines down south who wanted to hold an election in Najaf and the only candidate was the former Ba’athist governor. There were some problems with that and we had to sort that out. In fact we found in a number of places that the military had effectively reinstalled Ba’athist leaders in towns. I understood. I sympathized with them. You’re a captain, you come in with your unit. You’re in some town, the place is stabilized, and you say, “OK, we’ve got to get the water turned back on. We’ve got to get the power. Who the hell can do it?” Somebody steps forward and says, “I can get it done.” You say, “OK, you’re it, you’re the new mayor, get it done.”\n\nWell, the guy didn’t get it done, turns out to have been the guy who was there before. He’s the Ba’athist. So I can understand the problem, which led me to the view that you need to have what the State Department calls POLADS, political advisors, integrated into the military forces during the kinetic phase so you don’t make those kinds of mistakes. But apart from that, no. I know people have written a great deal about Sanchez and me. I’ve never understood it. I got along fine with Sanchez.\n\nI haven’t read his book. He may have a different view now. At the time and after we both left, he told me directly, personally, that he was not the source of all this blah, blah. It must have been our staffs. So I don’t know what he wrote later. I thought relations were more or less as I expected them to be and more or less satisfactory.\n\nRiley\n\nOn this question of troop strength, this is a shared opinion? Or does this become—\n\nBremer\n\nIn fairness to the President I’m glad you asked that because I should have continued the last thought. While I was of the view that we needed more troops, it is true that I never heard an American general ask for more troops. Rumsfeld always asked, “Do you need more troops?” and they said no. I’d heard the President a number of times—\n\nLeffler\n\nYou never heard General Sanchez ask for more troops?\n\nBremer\n\nNever. He wouldn’t have asked me, but I never heard him ask, in any meeting I was in where Rumsfeld asked him, “Do you have enough troops?” or where the President asked him, “Do you have enough troops?” All I ever heard generals say was, “We have enough troops to accomplish the mission.” It is an important thing they said, what is “the mission”? Then you come back to the question of the definition—\n\nLeffler\n\nJust so you’re informed, during this period of time, May, June, July, General Sanchez writes virtually every single day he was screeching for more troops. Every single day. Every single person he saw he was saying, “We need more troops.” Plus the fact there are technical issues here that he was very preoccupied about. This was not your fault—\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I know, he lost his corps command. The corps headquarters went home.\n\nLeffler\n\nNot only did the corps headquarters go home, but all strategic intelligence went home.\n\nBremer\n\nI know.\n\nLeffler\n\nAll the key intelligence staff went back to the United States. You knew these things were going on, right?\n\nBremer\n\nI did not know that he was asking for more troops. This is the first I heard.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou knew that he was losing absolutely critical staff.\n\nBremer\n\nI heard at some point, and I don’t remember when it was, that he had lost the corps command. The corps command had been taken out. I only subsequently heard that he had asked to get that fixed. I never heard that he asked for more troops. He never said anything to me about wanting more troops. But why would he? Who he would say it to was to the military chain of command. So all I’m saying is, to come back to the point about the President—who is after all who we are talking about—the President often asked, “Do you have enough troops?” Rumsfeld asked quite often do you have enough troops.\n\nNow, maybe they wouldn’t say they wanted more troops when I was in the room. In any case, I never heard a general ask for more troops. If you put yourself in the position of a President and he is asking do we need more troops and he is consistently being told by the military we have enough troops and over in the corner there is this retread diplomat standing there in his blue suit saying, “I think we need more troops,” who do you listen to?\n\nI can understand in a way the dilemma the President faced, which he faced really all the way up to the end of 2006. He was consistently being told you have enough troops and in fact he didn’t have enough troops. Nor did the military follow a proper counterinsurgency strategy.\n\nLeffler\n\nI think in some ways people studying this will be mystified. You come there, you’re in charge of the occupation. You have a general, now Sanchez, who is taking over. Certainly an overriding problem from Day One is security, disorder, looting, inadequate safeguard of ministries.\n\nBremer\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou and the general, both of whom respectively believe there are inadequate numbers of troops, did not, on the most important issue, talk to one another and say, “We need to do something together to bring this to the attention of the President.” How come you didn’t know that General Sanchez felt this way? We’ll ask him someday maybe how come he didn’t know you felt this way. Why didn’t you end up—\n\nBremer\n\nHe may have known I felt that way. I don’t know.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou and the military commander together address this issue in a way that would bring it to the President’s and the Secretary of Defense’s attention.\n\nBremer\n\nWell, the Secretary of Defense certainly knew about my view, and I assume he knew about Sanchez’s, but you’ll have to ask. If Sanchez was saying this—\n\nLeffler\n\nRumsfeld says he doesn’t know. He also says nobody—\n\nBremer\n\nIn his book he says, as I recall, that he was surprised that Sanchez was a) appointed and b) lost his corps command. So you’ll have to ask him. I assume Rumsfeld knew about both of us. It’s a question of what he did with that information. It’s a fair point. Certainly in retrospect it probably would have been better—I don’t know if it would have changed anything—if we had made a joint statement.\n\nWe were apparently both of the view, as you pointed out, that we didn’t have enough security on the ground, although at the time we’re talking about in May, June, we were really talking about street security because of the looting. We were not talking about an insurgency yet; we were talking about the looting. It’s a different point, and the ROE [rules of engagement]. I believe, as I said in my book, we had 40,000 troops on the ground in Baghdad—two full divisions. But they had no instructions to stop the looting. It wasn’t troop strength; it was a ROE problem.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat’s true. A great many people who write about the U.S. involvement in Iraq identify now—in fact, I think this would be a consensus statement. It’s not a uniform view, but it is a consensus view that essentially the initial occupation of Iraq was lost in April, May, June, and July of 2003 partly because of what you just say is looting, but a lot of people like Charles Duelfer, who was in Iraq at that time, writes very persuasively in his memoir that American authority was totally undercut during this period.\n\nBremer\n\nI agree with that. As you know I thought we should impose martial law. I agree with Charles.\n\nLeffler\n\nOne of the things that local commanders like Sanchez wanted to do, and you just referred to this, so I thought it was very interesting, was to use some of the local Ba’athite officials to restore order. They were doing that. You said to me give me precise examples. Sanchez says you specifically told him to get rid of these people; you cannot rely on them. That is one illumination of where—now, did you do that?\n\nBremer\n\nI don’t know. If he says I did I probably did. Sounds right.\n\nLeffler\n\nI don’t know, people write—Rumsfeld also says you didn’t talk to him every day.\n\nBremer\n\nWhat you quote Sanchez as saying is at least plausible to me. Yes, we were obviously trying to avoid the reestablishment of the Ba’athist secularite, Saddamist organization. So if somebody came to me and said he wanted to put some Ba’athists in charge of something I probably would have said no, bad idea. I don’t remember it, but it sounds plausible.\n\nNelson\n\nOn the rules of engagement question, when you found out that the military’s rules of engagement were not to shoot civilians even if they were looting, did you tell Rumsfeld—\n\nBremer\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\n—you need to get those orders changed?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I think the conversation I had, which is in the book—I don’t remember talking with Rumsfeld—was with Abizaid, who by that time I guess was still deputy. He was forward deployed, so he was in Qatar. He offered to send a couple of thousand MPs up to help with security. I don’t remember if I discussed it with Rumsfeld.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you think that was a response to the need you identified?\n\nBremer\n\nIt was at least an initial response, yes. The looting did in the end stop because all the buildings were burned down.\n\nRiley\n\nIn the book you mention on a couple of occasions your sense that there had been a missed deployment of intelligence personnel once it became fairly evident that the weapons of mass destruction business wasn’t going to play out the way I think most people had expected it to. Could you talk a little bit about that process? And were you under political duress from the White House or the Defense Department to keep pushing on this WMD issue?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, it’s interesting. I had almost no conversations at all about WMD with Washington. In Baghdad I did meet once a week with David Kay, who was at that time still heading up whatever it was called. He had a big group, 1,400 people or something working for him. I got a weekly update from him on what they had found in leads. Every now and then there would be a lead they had and they wanted some Iraqi politician to help them. I would help with that. And a couple of times an Iraqi would come to me with a WMD lead, which I’d pass on to David.\n\nBy the time of the bombing of the Jordanian Embassy on August 8th, at the latest anyway, it became clear to me that our intelligence effort was heavily weighted toward WMD, and without reducing that we also needed to build up some kind of a counterinsurgency, counterterrorist capability. I called George Tenet and said we’ve got to redo the intelligence footprint. They then did start to build up that side of the house. I was really not involved in the search for WMD other than getting briefed by David Kay every week.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it unusual for you to talk to Tenet?\n\nBremer\n\nNo. He may have been our first visitor to Baghdad. He came out quite early in my time there. I remember taking a helicopter tour with him of Baghdad. No, it wasn’t particularly unusual. It was a little unusual because he was on a beach somewhere in New Jersey so I had to get him off a beach to a secure phone for this early August call.\n\nRiley\n\nOn his trip over was the focus at that time mostly on WMD?\n\nBremer\n\nI think it probably was because I think the trip was quite early—maybe in early June or something. I don’t remember exactly. We met at the station and talked to his guys. He may have come another time too. But the focus early on in terms of what the station was doing was WMD.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you get a sense of frustration out of Washington about the inability to come up with WMDs?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I don’t remember anybody raising that.\n\nNelson\n\nIt was simply not your domain.\n\nBremer\n\nPeople understood that it was over there with the Agency. Kay in theory reported to me because he was a civilian under the 22 CFR, but it was basically keeping me informed.\n\nRiley\n\nBut at the point that you begin to sense that you need a reallocation do you get pushback on that, or is it sort of fatalistic?\n\nBremer\n\nNo, I think people recognized—by that time we’d had a number of incidents out in the west in Anbar province in Fallujah and in Haditha and we’d had the bombing of the Jordanian Embassy. It was beginning to be clear. There was no pushback, it was a question of just—and I never said I wanted to reduce the number looking for WMD. I just wanted to build up the other side, which they did.\n\nPerry\n\nCan I ask your impressions of President Bush? We haven’t really talked about that through this period. So you go from not really knowing him to having an intense lunch meeting with him at which time he tells you that we’re going to take the slow ap"
