Christopher Graham\n\nRemains found at mass gravesites, located near a farm on the outskirts of Al Mahawil, Iraq, May 7, 2003.\n\nThe cruelty of Saddam's regime is evident in its brutality toward Iraqi citizens. Mass grave sites across Iraq provide further evidence of Saddam's atrocities. Below, the Iraqi people share their stories of brutality, torture, fear, and death.\n\nFor more personal stories of life after Saddam, visit Liberation Update.\n\nFor more information on Coalition assistance to protect mass graves, click here.\n\n\"The prison was a terrible, miserable place. I saw my relatives being tortured. One time, they buried my uncle in the sand up to his neck and left him in the heat. It was awful to watch. But the worst day was when they came for my father. Even then, I knew I would never see him again. I could feel it.\"\n\n-- Khairiya Hatim, Iraqi town councilor who was imprisoned with her family because of their allegiance to a banned opposition party, Sunday Telegraph (London), September 28, 2003\n\n\"When Saddam Hussein's government went on an anti-inflation tear in 1992, it rounded up, tried and executed 42 food merchants in one day, including Tabra's father, the wealthy patriarch of a well-known trading family. 'Whenever there was a merchant, a famous name in any sector, the old regime tried to stop them,' Omar Tabra [Iraqi food merchant] said. 'They did it by killing.'\"\n\n-- Bill Glauber, Chicago Tribune, September 27, 2003\n\n\"Most afternoons, among the market stalls leading to the old city of Najaf young men set up TV sets in the street showing grotesque scenes of cruelty. Handcuffed prisoners are executed with sticks of dynamite shoved into their pockets. Screaming men plead for their lives as they are beaten by Saddam Hussein's secret police. Crimson fragments of bodies lie in the street, moments after a huge explosion, to the soundtrack of an Arab lament. The crowds gather round. People mutter and shake their heads. Then they queue to pay 1,000 Iraqi dinars (about 33p) [50 cents] for laser discs containing footage of the appalling scenes. These are the atrocity discs of Iraq, a booming mini-industry in a country still stricken by the consequences of the war. They are produced in home factories, with the simplest computer equipment.\"\n\n-- The London Times, September 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"The day after the liberation, my aunt put out a black banner--an Arab mourning ritual--with the names of all her relatives who had been murdered by the regime on it. And she looked down her street, and there were black banners on almost every house. On some houses it looks like a long shopping list. She said to her neighbour, 'You too?' Under Saddam it was a crime to mourn people killed by the regime--it made you seem suspicious too. Everyone was suffering terribly, but they were suffering alone. They just didn't know that everyone else was hating it too.\"\n\n-- Yasser Alaskary, co-founder of Iraqi Prospect Organisation, an Iraqi freedom group, The Independent (London), September 18, 2003\n\n------\n\nPhoto by Thomas Hartwell\n\nAweda Abed Al-Amer, 48, grieves over two members of her family found in a mass grave in Musayib, 75 KM SW of Baghdad. She lost 5 members of her family including her husband, son and 3 nephews after an uprising against the Iraqi government in 1991.The bodies wrapped in linen shrouds are being held in a makeshift morgue in a youth center for possible identification.\n\n\"Virtually every athlete at the club has physical or mental scars inflicted by Saddam Hussein's older son, Uday, who took control of Iraq's Olympic Committee in 1984 and began a terrifying campaign of torture and humiliation. Many fled the country, including Mr. [Ahmed] Samarrai....\n\n\"'The system of the regime started in primary school,' said Mr. Samarrai, who defected on a trip to Switzerland in 1983 and returned here after the war. 'It was exactly like the Nazis in the 30's.'...\n\n\"'Uday played hell with sports,' said Immanuel Baba Dano, a revered figure in Iraq who was coach of the national soccer team for most of the last three decades....\n\n\"Some athletes were humiliated, he said. Others were smeared with feces and jailed. Some were placed in a sarcophagus with nails pointed inward so that they would be punctured and suffocated, he said. At least a few were set in front of wild dogs to be torn to pieces. How many were executed is still not clear.\n\n\"'Nobody knew what was in his mind,' Mr. Dano said. 'But there was no pity.'\"\n\n-- The New York Times, August 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'We smelled something rotten, and when we breathed in, we couldn't breathe out. The sky was full of smoke, and someone said it was chemicals. People started crying and running toward the mountains. I was burning and I became blind, but someone led me out. After walking for two days, we reached Iran.' [Wais Abdel] Qadr was the only member of his family to survive the gassing of Halabja by the Iraqi military on March 16, 1988.\"\n\n-- The Washington Post, August 7, 2003\n\n------\n\nPhoto by Thomas Hartwell\n\nIraqis search for their relatives and friends among victims found in a mass grave in Musayib, 75 KM SW of Baghdad. The victims are thought to be from among some 2,000 persons reported missing after the 1991 uprising against the Iraqi government. The bodies wrapped in linen shrouds are being held in a makeshift morgue in a youth center.\n\n\"Freed in April after 13 years in prison, [Dr. Ibrahim] Basri [Saddam's former physician] is now reaching out to register and help as many victims of the regime as he can find. They stream to a clinic attached to his house, a sad collection of former political prisoners, relatives of the executed, and maimed men who cannot work because they lost an arm, an ear, or a foot to the torturer's knife. 'All the time in prison, I think, \"What can I do to help these people?\"' he said. ... 'For the first five years, he put me in a cell by myself, 2 meters by 2 1/2 meters, where I didn't know if it was day or night. I was so dirty with lice. There were cockroaches in my mouth at night. And they came to beat you in the morning and at night for nothing, nothing.' Once, he continued, the guards beat him in front of 300 inmates until they broke his legs. 'I never said, \"Mercy.\" I just said, \"Iraq.\"'\"\n\n-- The Boston Globe, August 7, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"The nightmares persist, even years later, as Ehab Al Deen cannot shake the memories of torment from his summer camp with 'Saddam's Lion Cubs.'\n\n\"Like thousands of Iraqi teens, Al Deen vividly recalls long marches in oppressive heat, being slapped by military trainers for not following orders and spending nights in fields listening to the howls of wolves.\n\n\"The camps culminated each August with a ceremony in which the youths were videotaped in the Iraqi fighter tradition of ripping a dog's flesh with their teeth.\n\n\"'The dogs were already dead,' said Al Deen, 18, who attended the camp in 1998 and still recalls the bitter taste. 'It was horrible.' ...\n\n\"They were mostly disenfranchised children from poor neighborhoods or sons of Baath Party members recruited by teachers during the school year. ...\n\n\"But once they arrived at the two military camps on the outskirts of Baghdad, the youths found hard work and mostly empty promises. ...\n\n\"'I was so scared,' said Al Deen, who was 13 when he went to the camp in 1998. 'We cried for hours.'\"\n\n-- Chicago Tribune, August 3, 2003\n\n------\n\nSally Hodgson - Department of State\n\nA sign of mourning posted recently outside a house in a neighborhood a few kilometers from a mass grave southeast of Basrah. The sign in Arabic reads: \"Matar Jaber Ali was killed by Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party in 1991.\" Matar's brothers put up the sign outside their house after they dug up a robe at the mass grave, which they believe their brother was wearing when he disappeared in 1991. Similar signs can be seen posted throughout southern Iraq, often with printed photos of people missing or killed by Saddam's brutal regime.\n\n\"The bodyguard says he was disgusted by Uday's activities-he points to a floor-to-ceiling cage in the corner of the club's kitchen where he says monkeys were kept for Uday because he liked to have the animals watch him when he was deflowering virgins. ... It was his to make the singers who entertained Uday at the Boat Club gulp down a liter and a half of a 'cocktail,' a combination of 90-proof alcohol often with some drugs thrown in. ...\n\n\"'I would line up all the entertainment against that wall,' the bodyguard said, pointing to the side of the garage. 'And I would take a stick. ... And I would say, \"Drink, drink, you have 10 minutes.\" If any of them didn't drink, I hit them with a stick.' ... Then, if the singers still refused, they were given a 'street beating,' meaning that their faces were untouched but they were pummeled until they could hardly stand up. ...\n\n\"'I always felt like I was the one who took the beatings because each shout of pain from the beaten person, I used to pray to God and ask God to punish me for what I was doing. But the person who took the beating did not know that if I didn't carry out the orders, I would take the same beating that he was getting.'\"\n\n-- Los Angeles Times, August 2, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Jailers often treated allegedly lagging players in ways certain to hurt, not improve, the athletes' performances on the field. After shaving their heads to humiliate them, athletes were hung upside down and the soles of their feet whipped. They were buried in hot sand up to their necks. Their fingers or ears were amputated. Electric shocks were applied to their skin. And, in the case of soccer players, they were forced to kick concrete balls.\"\n\n-- USA TODAY, July 30, 2003\n\n------\n\nPhoto by Thomas Hartwell\n\nIraqi workers dig for the remains of Iraqis from a mass grave in Musayib, 75 KM SW of Baghdad. The victims are thought to be from among some 2,000 persons reported missing after the 1991 uprising against the Iraqi government.\n\nAt only 22, Tareq, a defender, has been to prison five times. After a while, he recognized a pattern to the punishment. \"The first stage of the torture is the reception, when you are given a choice of which plastic cable you will be beaten with. Then you are beaten 15 to 20 times. The reception is over. In the next stage, you are thrown into knee-deep sewer water and told to swim,\" he says. Tareq was dragged bare-chested across hot asphalt. Made to run barefoot over broken glass and gravel. When it was time to leave, he says, \"The farewell party is a beating.\"\n\n-- USA TODAY, July 30, 2003\n\n------\n\nTareq recalls how his team was invited to pose for pictures with Uday. At 6-5, Tareq towered over Uday. \"The next day, I was taken and flogged 20 times\" for being taller, says Tareq, who plans to leave Iraq soon to play professionally in Germany or Scandinavia.\n\n-- USA TODAY, July 30, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Ahmad was Uday's chief executioner. Last week, as Iraqis celebrated the death of his former boss and his equally savage younger brother Qusay, he nervously revealed a hideous story. His instructions that day in 1999 were to arrest the two 19-year-olds on the campus of Baghdad's Academy of Fine Arts and deliver them at Radwaniyah. On arrival at the sprawling compound, he was directed to a farm where he found a large cage. Inside, two lions waited. They belonged to Uday. Guards took the two young men from the car and opened the cage door. One of the victims collapsed in terror as they were dragged, screaming and shouting, to meet their fate. Ahmad watched as the students frantically looked for a way of escape. There was none. The lions pounced. 'I saw the head of the first student literally come off his body with the first bite and then had to stand and watch the animals devour the two young men. By the time they were finished there was little left but for the bones and bits and pieces of unwanted flesh,' he recalled last week.\"\n\n-- Sunday Times, London, July 27, 2003\n\n------\n\nOne of the condemned women was pregnant. This presented a problem, said Ahmad, because under religious law a pregnant woman should at least be allowed to finish her term and deliver the baby before being executed. 'She was several months' pregnant,' he said. 'The doctor had verified it, she had said so and we could see her swollen stomach. She was taken in and out three times - everyone was unsure what to do with her.' Telephone calls were made to Uday by his representative. As they waited, the woman sobbed and begged for mercy for her unborn child. On the third telephone call the order was given to go ahead with her execution. 'At that the woman was beheaded - and knowing she was pregnant, I felt sick in the stomach and wished for Allah to open up the ground and swallow everyone there including myself,' said Ahmad.\n\n-- Sunday Times, London, July 27, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"They put me in a cell just 1m by 1.5m, painted completely red with no windows and lots of tiny stones on the floor and told me to count them. It did not matter what number you said it would be wrong. If I said 2000, they would say no, it's 2001 and beat me 10 times. Then they put me inside a circle and told me to run round and round for nine hours. After that they threw me on the hot pavement and a fat guard sat on my chest. Then they pulled me along by my ankles so that my back was streaming with blood.\n\n\"Another time they drew a bicycle on the wall and told me to ride it. They threw me in foul dirty water and said you must swim, then they kept pushing me under with a stick forcing me to drink.\n\n\"Once they told us we had to catch 10 flies during the night and 10 mosquitoes during the day or you would be tortured more. This was impossible so you had to catch the mosquitoes at night and hold them till daytime and vice versa with the flies. Then they would ask which is male and which is female. Whatever you said it would be vice versa.\"\n\n-- Sunday Times, London, July 27, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"I have never spoken of this before because I was afraid for my family,\" said Faig. \"But now they are gone, and we are finally free to speak of such things.\"\n\n-- Sunday Times, London, July 27, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"When I was in Iraq a doctor from Basra told me that, after being jailed by the police some years ago, he refused to tell his inquisitors whatever it was they wanted to hear. Instead of beating him, he told me, they brought in his 3-month-old daughter. The interrogator tore the screaming infant's eye out. When the desired answers were still not forthcoming, the questioner hurled the little girl against the concrete wall and smashed her skull.\"\n\n-- The New York Times, July 26, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"After games, they called me from Odai's office,\" Mahmod said. \"They would say: 'This player, this player, this player.' I would organize the players. They would sit in a room. Someone would come and take them, jail them.\"\n\n\"If he would find any small mistake, he would directly punish me,\" said Laith Hussein, captain since 1996 of the Iraqi national soccer team, recalling \"10 or 12\" times that he was jailed over the years.\n\n-- Los Angeles Times, July 25, 2003\n\n------\n\nIraqi exiles agreed that Uday Hussein, the eldest of five children, personified the government's random brutality. Human rights groups and Iraqi exiles accused him of routinely kidnapping women off the streets, raping and sometimes torturing them, and personally supervising the torture and humiliation of hundreds of prisoners. Such conduct earned him the title \"Abu Sarhan,\" the Arabic term for \"father of the wolf.\"\n\n-- The New York Times, July 23, 2003\n\n------\n\nPhoto by Thomas Hartwell\n\nIraqis search for their relatives and friends among victims found in a mass grave in Musayib, 75 KM SW of Baghdad. The victims are thought to be from among some 2,000 persons reported missing after the 1991 uprising against the Iraqi government. The bodies wrapped in linen shrouds are being held in a makeshift morgue in a youth center.\n\n\"I remember once I was in the disco in the Al-Mansour hotel,\" said a former air force engineer, who asked to remain anonymous. \"We were up there dancing with some Irish nurses. Then Qusay and his guys come in. I'm dancing with this nurse and suddenly Qusay is at my side. He just pulls back his jacket and shows me his gun. I said to the nurse, 'You can stay if you want but we're leaving.'\"\n\n-- Newsday (New York), July 23, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Contrary to what has been written, Uday was never married and he was obsessed with women. If he spotted a woman he fancied in the street or at a reception, he would send his henchmen to fetch her.\"\n\n-- Uday's former aide, Agence France Presse, July 22, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Prisoners were often eliminated with a bullet to the head, but one witness told the London-based human rights group Indict that inmates were sometimes murdered by being dropped into shredding machines. Some prisoners went in headfirst and died quickly, while others were put in feet first and died screaming. The witness said that on at least one occasion, Qusai supervised shredding-machine murders.\"\n\n-- Associated Press, July 22, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"In the last room, where she was held for several hours, the door was locked. At sunset two men entered. She recalled they said they had to take routine security precautions in advance of a meeting with Uday Hussein. They slipped a black hood over her head and tied her hands behind her back. The anxiety, which had mounted through the day, flared into terror. She was taken down to a lower level in an elevator and then along a passageway that seemed narrow because of the way the two men bumped against her. She was pushed into a room and tied, spread-eagle, to a bed.\n\n\"'All of this period, I didn't resist,' she said. 'But on the bed, I knew. I said, \"I am like your sister; please don't do this.\" I started to beg. They said if our sister married an Indian and started a network against the government, we would kill her. I kept praying, calling for Jesus and the Virgin Mary. I prayed to Muhammad. They damned them all.'\n\n\"'They raped me twice that first day,' she continued. 'I don't know the persons. Two of them. I couldn't see them. They kept raping for four days as well as I can remember. They took my honor.'\n\n\"Over the next seven months, Hanna said, she implicated people she had never heard of in a spy network she knew nothing about. She was routinely beaten and she said the Major, in a grotesque joke, kept three sticks on a wall hanging under the names Jesus, the prophet Muhammad and Imam Ali, whom Shiite Muslims believe is Muhammad's true heir. Whichever holy man a prisoner called out for determined which stick they were beaten with. The Major, she said, also routinely used electric shock and once set a police dog on her in a small room; the scar of the bite mark is still on her arm.\n\n\"One of his preferred forms of torture, she said, was to order the women to strip, then tie them to the tree trunk, and smear wet sugar on them so the dogs would terrorize them as they licked it off their bodies. Hanna also identified his superior at the academy.\"\n\n-- The Washington Post, July 21, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Saddam's troops and Fedayeen first stormed through the region in armed helicopters in 1991- the helicopters that Norman Schwarzkopf allowed him to keep. One man says his son was hung for belonging to a Shiite political group. Another man says his father and uncle were hung in front of him when he was a 15-year-old. Entire families were slaughtered.\"\n\n-- The Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'Among them here are children of ages less than three - what was their guilt that they should be murdered?' Mr Amin said. 'Just because they were Kurds? Among them are old women with no teeth. What harm could they do? Saddam Hussein was nothing but a dictator and a killer.'\n\n\"Sunni Arab villager Ali Ibrahim said his friend Khalil Eid, then a 14-year-old shepherd, was one of the few local people to have had first-hand experience of the massacre. 'One day he came to this place with his sheep and some army vehicles came, and they told him to go far away because there would be shooting practice here,' Mr Ibrahim said. 'He went far off into the desert but later he sneaked back and heard the sound of firing and people screaming.' After the forces had driven away he came and saw they had leveled the ground. It's a disaster. It's a crime that cannot be described.\"\n\n-- The Age (Melbourne), July 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'That's when I realized this was no ordinary execution,' said the officer, a retired colonel from the Iraqi 2nd Army Corps who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"'The government was using prisoners to test its chemical weapons.'\n\n\"'He didn't have a mark on him, nothing,' Al-Hamid recalled bitterly. 'We were told not to touch him. We were told to bury him as fast as possible.' As for the Iraqi army intelligence officer who claims to have witnessed the test gassing of hundreds of prisoners at an open-air site in the desert near Jalula, which is about 80 miles northeast of Baghdad and 20 miles from the Iranian border, he asserted that the bodies he saw also bore no marks. 'It was like they were asleep,' he said with lingering awe.\"\n\n-- Chicago Tribune, July 16, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'You see, sir,' said Karim Jasim, an excavator brushing dirt off a skeleton at the al-Musayyib mass grave near Kerbala, 'there are two Iraqis; one above the ground, and another beneath it.'\"\n\n-- The Observer (London), July 6, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'We'd raise their legs and place their feet into this sort of wooden frame and we would beat them on the soles of their feet,' said Abu Firaz, a former guard, describing one of the punishments for taking drugs, fighting or having gay sex.\"\n\n-- Newsday (New York), July 3, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"At the age of 21, he had spent 10 days in a torture cell. He says it's a hard thing to talk about, even now. When he does, he describes sadistic brutality with matter-of-fact detail. His tormentors did everything to stop him from sleeping so that he didn't know whether it was night or day. 'Then they take you,' he says. 'They put you flat on a table. Then they tie your legs and hands and they put you under a water tap. Then they let the water tap drip. You cannot move your head and they say you have to confess.' This went on for hour after hour before he passed out. 'One drop,' he says. 'But it's like a bomb.' 'The other one was that they bring in an animal,' he says, searching for the English word. 'Yes, a goat. They put a lot of salt on your feet and they bring in the goat to lick your feet.' The process, he says, induces uncontrollable laughing and crying at first and builds into a loss of control of the nervous system -- eventually a loss of consciousness.\"\n\n-- CanWest Interactive, June 29, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"You don't know, maybe it is your brother who is going to submit a report against you; maybe your cousin. You can't trust anybody. Even if you are alone in the toilet, you can't say anything.

At Basra Hospital, Razak's ears were sliced off without painkillers. He said he was thrown into jail with 750 men, all with bloody stumps where their ears had been.

They are still out there and we are still afraid.'\"\n\n-- Mutilation victim quoted in The Sunday Times (London), April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"After he arrived in Baghdad, he was placed in a darkened room with only a small red light, no bed. Guards would splash buckets of water through a small gap in the bottom of the door to put an inch or two of water on the floor so that he could not sleep. They gave him tea and a piece of bread for breakfast. Rice and a piece of bread for lunch. He went to the bathroom in his room, on the floor.\"\n\n-- The Baltimore Sun, April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"In a pile in one of the rooms used for torture were textbooks for children: a science book for third-graders, an agriculture book for sixth-graders. Whole families, including infants and toddlers, were held in this prison. This was a form of mercy, this keeping the families together.\"\n\n-- The Baltimore Sun, April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"In the night, they took me again to the room, and they made my body wet with water. I was naked,\" he recalls, and now is when he searches with his eyes for that spot. To cushion his words: They used clamps to connect electrical wire to his genitals and then they sent a current running through him.\n\n\"'My whole body shook,' he says. 'I was shouting to them, \"I will sign anything! Just stop this!\" I was shaking, shaking. I shook until I passed out.'\n\n'The guards shocked him in the same way every night for two weeks. When they feared he would die, they gave him a week off. Then back to the shocking. Always they beat him, sometimes on his back, sometimes on his legs and arms, often on the soles of his feet until they bled. The pattern continued for six months.\"\n\n-- The Baltimore Sun, April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"He described how, clad in black garb that covered all but his eyes, he had often meted out sentences in the street, in front of a victim's family and horrified onlookers. Guarded by armed colleagues, he used to tie up and blindfold the accused. One of his men held the detainee's head in a firm grip. Another forced open the mouth.\n\n\"Ali would then draw out a pair of pliers and a sharp knife. Gripping the tongue with pliers, he would slice it up with the knife, tossing severed pieces into the street. \"'Those punished were too terrified to move, even though they knew I was about to chop off their tongue,' said Ali in his matter-of-fact voice. 'They would just stand there, often praying and calling out for Saddam and Allah to spare them. By then it was too late.\n\n\"'I would read them out the verdict and cut off their tongue without any form of anaesthetic. There was always a lot of blood. Some offenders passed out. Others screamed in pain. They would then be given basic medical assistance in an ambulance which would always come with us on such punishment runs. Then they would be thrown in jail.'\"\n\n-- Fedayeen Saddam member interviewed in The Sunday Times (London), April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Ferass Adnan is a 23-year-old trader who speaks with difficulty these days now that part of his tongue is missing. Some months ago he got into a fight in a market in northern Baghdad and was overheard insulting Saddam as the 'son of a dog'. A policeman tried to arrest him, but Adnan fled.\n\n\"Within hours, Iraqi secret police agents arrived at Adnan's home and, failing to find him, took away his uncle, brother, and two cousins. They were thrown in jail and tortured with electric shocks.\n\n\"It was only a matter of days before the regime's ubiquitous security spies caught up with Adnan in the suburbs of Baghdad. He was jailed and then, on March 5, turned over to the specialists of Ali's punishment squad. Adnan was taken back to his father's home in north Baghdad, where his entire family was ordered to gather outside the local coffee house.\n\n\"'His hands were tied and his eyes blindfolded,' the young man's father, Adnan Duleimi, recalled last week. 'I had not seen my son since they had arrested him. I tried to pay for his release. I lost all my savings, handing everything I had to corrupt security officers who promised to help but only took my money. There was nothing I could do. I had to watch in silence as they took a knife to my son's tongue. Had I said a word we would all have been killed.'\"\n\n-- The Sunday Times (London), April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"One of Ali's fellow fedayeen lost his tongue simply for repeating how he had heard of a man who had accused Uday of bringing shame on the Iraqi people for dressing in multi-coloured shirts . which, according to the critic, made him look like a woman.\n\n\"'There was no mild form of criticism when it came to Saddam, Uday or the regime,' said Ali. 'Any critical comment, even to say that the president looked tired in a speech, was enough to risk having one's tongue cut off by us.'\"\n\n-- Interview with a member of the Fedayeen Saddam in The Sunday Times (London), April 20, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Former prisoners of ousted president Saddam Hussein's government are everywhere in Basra, standing on street corners waiting for water, rummaging through papers in the headquarters of the once feared secret police, sitting quietly at home on a hot afternoon. These are the tortures they describe, and more: a prisoner forced to sit on a heated metal stove, electric shocks applied to genitals, a small blade used to slash a prisoner's back. Even doctors became torturers; they cut off army deserters' ears. Servants of the system fell victim to it, too: police officers and prison guards arrested, tortured, then sent back to work. Torture was considered so routine that many former prisoners shrugged at first when asked about it. 'Of course, they tortured me. Beating people here is something regular,' said Maithem Naji.\"\n\n-- The Washington Post, April 19, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Anwar Abdul Qadir was there, too, looking. He has been missing his brother since 1991 as well, when the 17-year-old was taken from their home at 4 a.m. His uncle is also missing, and his cousin was executed in 1996. Altogether, he has six relatives who were arrested and whose whereabouts are unknown. 'I'm very lucky they just took five or six relatives,' he said, nodding in the direction of Abdul Wahab. 'Some people had five or six brothers taken.'\"\n\n-- The Washington Post, April 19, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"I saw thousands killed and buried in mass graves. Some were lined up and machine- gunned before being covered with sand. Others were just buried alive. Saddam had a programme of telling villagers (Kurds) they were being relocated south. We would take trucks that would normally hold 12 to 15 people and put in 200 with no water or ventilation. Many would die on the way. Survivors were driven to Al Anbar or Tharthar and buried alive in vast holes dug in the ground. I saw thousands of people . men, women and children . die this way.\"\n\n-- Defecting colonel in Iraqi internal security service, Evening Standard (London), April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'Adnan Agari, who never returned, was taken away with his brother Ghassan and his cousin Khatar. They were taken to Baghdad and tortured with electrified wire, Ghassan said. 'The screaming terrified me,' he recalled of the dark, poorly ventilated torture chamber. 'I was a boy then, 15. I have never heard anything like that before or since.'\"\n\n-- The New York Times, April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"There in the corridor were the punishment units where men were stuffed into windowless cinder block cells, one metre by 50cm. On the left was the yellow holding pen where prisoners fought to sleep next to the open pits that served as latrines, suffering the stench for a few inches more space.\"\n\n-- The Guardian (London), April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"At least three massacres on Saddam City's streets have occurred in the last 10 years, including 700 people gunned down during a 1998 Shiite demonstration, said Muhammad Qadim Saadoun, a former air force helicopter pilot whose 40-day political imprisonment ended last week with the U.S. entry into Baghdad.\n\n\"He said he was imprisoned repeatedly for refusing to fire on his fellow Shiites, who form the majority of the population but had long been subservient to Mr. Hussein's Sunni-dominated secular government.\n\n\"'You cannot imagine the horrible things they did to us,' Mr. Saadoun said. He was tortured while hanging upside down by his feet and pistol-whipped so hard he has lost some of his memory.\"\n\n-- The Dallas Morning News, April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Another former prisoner from Saddam City, Hussein Ali, said he was arrested for participating in the 1998 protest and imprisoned until late last year. During torture sessions, his fingernails were yanked off his fingers. He described his cell as 'a big hole with lots of insects and worms.'\"\n\n-- The Dallas Morning News, April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"For days now, scores of desperate Iraqis have turned up outside the state security complex here, searching for their missing loved ones, begging the American troops who guard its gates to help them find the relatives whom they believe to be trapped in a prison beneath the sprawling grounds.\n\n\"With the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, 30 years of buried history is slowly being resurrected. The Iraqis who appear each morning calling out names and dates of arrest are hoping that their missing brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles will be resurrected along with the past.\n\n\"They hold up one finger, two fingers, four fingers, trying to explain to the Americans how many relatives are supposedly in the jail. They throng the gates from dawn to dusk, holding up photos of their vanished loved ones and holding desperately onto hope.\"\n\n-- The New York Times, April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"One of the disappeared is the son of an old man named Kadem Agari Albadri. He lives in a walled-compound on Maarifa Street . the street of knowledge . landscaped with fuchsia trees and palms. His name appears in the book as a local teacher. His son Adnan is there, also: No. 32, arrested March 3, 1991. Suspect. Whereabouts unknown.\n\n\"... Much of his family and friends gathered today to hear him speak. They all brought faded pictures or names scribbled on scrap paper of sons and brothers who have disappeared. They need look no further than the book.\n\n\"'Before anything, I want to tell the people of America and Britain something,' Mr. Albadri said. 'There is nothing, nothing more terrible for a father and mother than to have their child taken from them. Not to know. Never to see his body. You cannot imagine. This is how we lived.'\"\n\n-- The New York Times, April 17, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"I was sitting outside my father's house in a village near Tikrit on Friday when two carloads of fedayeen stopped. They got out and began to beat me and accuse me of being a saboteur. Then they shot me in the leg. They took me to the police station and kept me for three nights, saying they would kill me. Then yesterday they just disappeared. And at 7am this morning (Monday) an American Marine came and let me out of my cell. I feel very lucky.\"\n\n-- Khalid Jauhr, an Iraqi Kurd, in the Daily Mail (London), April 15, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"When they came closer, I could see in the bus men, women and children with blindfolds over their eyes. I was very afraid and hid in a hole. It was mostly men. There were about eight children and ten women. They (Ba'ath Party forces) took them off the bus and led them over to the hole in groups. They sat or knelt and then they began to shoot them from very close, many shots. Some were just pushed in and then covered up with earth. There was no escape, it was done very quickly.\n\n\"I could not tell this secret because I knew it was dangerous knowledge that I should not hold, dangerous knowledge. But if the British Army want me to show them I will dig up the bodies myself, because I know they are there. I can never forget.\"\n\n-- Satar Al Khalid, a Bedouin, recalls an incident he saw near Ramallah, Iraq, in 1998, Daily Mail (London), April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'Me.' 'Me.' 'Me,' they murmured in response to the question: Whose father, brother, son had been executed by Saddam Hussein's government. Eleven hands in all, raised in the stagnant air inside the low mud-brick house of Sheik Kathem Al Wafi, signalling the death toll here.\n\n\"These men and their sheik, the elders of the Al Wafi tribe, are people of the Madan, the marsh Arabs who for five millennia lived in a vast area of wetlands that began about 50 miles north of Basra . lived, that is, until 1988, when Hussein's government began a systematic campaign of oppression, execution and internal exile against them.\"\n\n-- Newsday, April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"The few Iraqi men of Pumping Station No. 1 tried to protect it as if it were their own. In the end, they lost tools, spare parts and important records to gangs ransacking the oil complex. But they saved the new red fire engine; a quick-thinking operations manager drove it home.\n\n\"Over the weekend, the men sat silently, their faces clouded with doubt and fear, as an American oil engineer tried to convince them the station - and the oil flowing through it - really do belong to them and the Iraqi people.\n\n\"Under Saddam's regime, the workers said, the station was a place where they had to be careful in their work and careful what they said. On the payroll as a mechanic was a Baath Party official whose real job was to ensure loyalty to the Iraqi dictator.\n\n\"Any workers who complained 'would disappear in the night,' said Muslim Yehia, a technician. 'We don't know if they were killed or tortured or ran away.'\"\n\n-- USA Today, April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'Prisoners were taken to watch executions; anyone who cried was executed, too. Our hands were tied like this. First the left hand and then the foot. Then a black hood on my head, then they applied electricity.\"\n\n\"They had a game: They made people drink gasoline, then put them out in open ground and fire guns at them.\"\n\n-- Abdallah Ahmed, survivor of Abu GhraibPrison, on CBS Evening News, April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"'I was beaten, refrigerated naked and put underground for one year because I was a Shiite and Saddam is a Sunni,' said Ali Kaddam Kardom, 37. He said he was arrested in the central city of Karbala on March 10, 2000. He returned to the facility in Baghdad this weekend, he said, to help rescue any Iraqis who still might be imprisoned there.\"\n\n-- USA Today, April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"An Iraqi soldier, who according to the facility's records witnessed the beatings, said interrogators regularly used pliers to remove men's teeth, electric prods to shock men's genitals and drills to cut holes in their ankles.\n\n\"In one instance, the soldier recalled, he witnessed a Kuwaiti soldier, who had been captured during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, being forced to sit on a broken Pepsi bottle. The man was removed from the bottle only after it filled up with his blood, the soldier said. He said the man later died.\n\n\"'I have seen interrogators break the heads of men with baseball bats, pour salt into wounds and rape wives in front of their husbands,' said former Iraqi soldier Ali Iyad Kareen, 41. He then revealed dozens of Polaroid pictures of beaten and dead Iraqis from the directorate's files.\"\n\n-- USA Today, April 14, 2003\n\n------\n\n\"Saturday, former prisoners and Iraqi soldiers said they heard screams of 'help' from men who were still there. Several soldiers who tried to enter the underground prison through a manhole said they found the area flooded and doors locked. Kanan Alwan, 41, who worked in the facility's administrative office, said the intelligence officers of the facility programmed the prison's computers, which control the water flow, so that the water level"
