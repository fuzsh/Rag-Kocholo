        "text": "A Baghdad court Sunday sentenced in absentia the exiled daughter of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to seven years in prison for \"promoting\" her father's outlawed Baath party.\n\nThe party was dissolved and banned after Hussein was toppled during the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nAccording to the ruling, which AFP was able to review, Raghad Saddam Hussein was found guilty of the crime of \"promoting the activities of the banned Baath party,\" during television interviews she gave in 2021.\n\nIn Iraq today, anyone showing photos or slogans promoting the ousted regime can be subject to prosecution.\n\nThe ruling does not indicate the exact interviews over which she was convicted.\n\nBut in 2021, Hussein spoke on the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya channel about Iraq's conditions under her father's iron-fisted rule from 1979 to 2003.\n\n\"Many people told me that our period was indeed a time of glory, of pride,\" she told the Saudi channel. \"Of course, the country was stable and rich.\""
