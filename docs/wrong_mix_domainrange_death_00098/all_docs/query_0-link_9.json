        "text": "On Jan. 16, 1991, U.S. armed forces unleashed hell on Iraq. Officially it was designated Operation Desert Storm.\n\n\"Has it really been 25 years ago?\" asked Ilario Pantano, a former Marine and former New Hanover County sheriff's deputy who now serves as North Carolina's assistant secretary of veterans' affairs. \"A lot of us are looking and shaking our heads.\"\n\nIn August 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had ordered his army to invade the neighboring, oil-rich nation of Kuwait, claiming it as a province of Iraq. On Nov. 29, 1990, the United Nations Security Council gave Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait and empowered the United States and other member nations to use \"all means necessary\" to free Kuwait.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush activated thousands of the Army reservists, including the 650th Terminal Transportation Company of Wilmington.\n\nMore than 75,000 soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen stationed in North Carolina served during the Persian Gulf War, providing 40 percent of the combat power, according to a release from the the governorâ€™s office. Thousands of Marines from Camp Lejeune and soldiers from Fort Bragg rapidly deployed to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn Jan. 16 -- Jan. 17 in Baghdad -- U.S. and other Coalition forces launched the air war, flying more than 100,000 sorties and dropping 85,000 tons of bombs in the course of the war.\n\n\"Toward the end of the war, we were shipping out 500-pound bombs,\" recalled Mike McGillicuddy, then a Navy petty officer aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima. \"The aircraft carriers were running out.\n\nOn Feb. 24 -- after a brief, abortive Iraqi assault on the Saudi border town of Khafji -- Marines rolled across the border into Kuwait, with the mission of liberating Kuwait City.\n\nOne of them was Pantano, then a 19-year-old TOW gunner, manning an anti-tank gun on top of a Humvee.\n\nIt was a tense time, Pantano recalled. In 1991, Iraq had the fourth-largest army on the planet, heavily resupplied -- by the United States, no less -- after Saddam's eight-year war against Iran. Some experts were predicting \"Vietnam-level casualties,\" Pantano said.\n\nSaddam had used chemical weapons against Iraq, and military planners feared he'd do the same against attackers. Pantano and his comrades went into action swathed in anti-chemical suits in the desert heat.\n\n\"It was hot, hot and sandy,\" recalled Wilmington native Scott Wallace, an aviation electronics technician with the Navy at the time. \"I don't know why anyone would want to live there.\"\n\n\"Saddam had detonated some of the (Kuwaiti) oil fields,\" Pantano said. \"It looked like something biblical -- this big, vertical cloud in front of us, like a giant black curtain.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Saddam deployed other weapons against Coalition naval forces.\n\n\"I remember going up on deck one morning, and there was this whole fleet of ships around us,\" recalled McGillicuddy, now the commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2573. \"The next morning, there was nothing there, nothing. I asked what was going on. Somebody said, 'We're in the middle of a mine field.' \" Minesweepers escorted the Iwo Jima out of danger.\n\nWhile the Marines struck Kuwait, Army divisions launched an armored flanking attack to the west, inflicting heavy casualties.\n\nThis was a different kind of war, Pantano noted -- the first covered by 24-hour satellite television news.\n\nAmong those watching, on the sidelines, was Rob Cooley, now the proprietor of Apple Annie's bakery in Wilmington. A West Point graduate and a 30-year Army veteran, Cooley was assigned to the 25th Division in Hawaii in early 1991. He was assigned to a reserve force that was to be deployed if needed. But the ground war ended in just 100 hours, so Cooley stayed put.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Cooley said. \"Of course, it was an anxious time when your brothers-in-arms are in harm's way.\"\n\nSaddam's generals quickly sued for peace, and on Feb. 28, President Bush declared a cease-fire. The emir of Kuwait was restored, a battered Saddam was left with his pre-war borders, and U.S. forces withdrew from Iraq.\n\nIn all, 148 members of the U.S. miltiary were killed in action and another 467 wounded in action. Pantano credits the 45-day air war, which he believes saved U.S. lives and Iraqi civilian lives. He also credits U.S. commanders -- many of whom commanded companies and battalions in Vietnam -- who insisted on a well-defined mission and purpose.\n\nEveryone McGillicuddy served with in the war was \"first-rate,\" he said. He recalled one aircraft technician who stayed at his job without a break despite breaking a collarbone in an accident.\n\nOn Friday, Pantano presided at an assembly at the N.C. Museum of History in Raleigh, honoring Desert Storm veterans and families of the fallen.\n\nGov. Pat McCrory announced Friday that North Carolina is finally going to use $100,000 donated by the Kuwaiti government to help build something to honor the state's Persian Gulf War veterans and those who died in the conflict.\n\nThe donation would go to the state Museum of History to create a traveling exhibit about North Carolina's role in the war. The exhibit could be completed by late summer.\n\nMcCrory read a proclamation naming 17 North Carolina residents who died in the war.\n\nThe Kuwaiti government made the donation in 1996. Plans to erect a permanent memorial in downtown Raleigh stalled and the money was largely forgotten."
