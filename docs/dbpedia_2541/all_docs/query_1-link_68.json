        "text": "Gillette Stadium provides wheelchair and companion seating with enhanced sight lines on every level of the stadium and at all price points. Accessible seating options can be purchased by calling the Gillette Stadium Ticket Office at (508) 384-9191 when tickets go on sale to the public or during a presale if you have a valid presale code. For most events, accessible seating options can also be purchased directly through Ticketmaster.com by toggling the Accessibility button under the filter tool. A person with a disability or third party buying on his/her/their behalf are able to purchase as many tickets as allowed within the event ticket limit. We have very limited seating available for guests on the day of the event so please make sure you purchase accessible seating when you order tickets.\n\nPatrons who acquire valid tickets for Patriots, Revolution, and all other events/games at Gillette Stadium and need to be relocated to a designated wheelchair and companion seating area are required to exchange tickets through the Gillette Stadium Ticket Office by calling (508) 384-9191. Please be advised that such exchanges and relocations are subject to wheelchair & companion seat availability and are accommodated on a first-come, first-serve basis with a maximum of (1) accessible ticket and (1) companion ticket.\n\nEvery year, millions of fans throughout the country purchase counterfeit tickets that are not valid and will not allow entry into a venue. Gillette Stadium takes a proactive stance by educating the general public about counterfeit tickets.\n\nGillette Stadium, the New England Patriots, and the New England Revolution do not endorse or condone the reselling of tickets to any Gillette Stadium events. Any unlicensed person reselling tickets by any method, and any licensed person reselling tickets on an auction website or in violation or applicable law, is subject to loss of ticket privileges. Use of tickets for advertising and promotional purposes (including contests and sweepstakes) is prohibited. Gillette Stadium, the New England Patriots and the New England Revolution are not responsible for, and may not honor, tickets sold in violation of applicable law, or stolen, lost, or counterfeit tickets.\n\nWhere should I purchase tickets? Ticketmaster is the official ticket vendor for all Gillette Stadium events. All individual Patriots and Revolution game tickets are sold online through Ticketmaster or by calling Ticketmaster at (800) 745-3000. The Gillette Stadium Ticket Office does not conduct any sales over the phone. The Gillette Stadium Ticket Office does not sell tickets directly on the day of the general public sale. Any tickets remaining from the general public on-sale will be sold through Ticketmaster or in person at the Gillette Stadium Ticket Office during our normal business hours.\n\nList of Authorized Sites:\n\nTicketmaster\n\nNFL Ticket Exchange powered by Ticketmaster (for Patriots)\n\nFor more information on Patriots tickets, please visit https://www.patriots.com/tickets/nfl-ticketing-network.\n\nBuyer Beware: If you are not purchasing tickets through an authorized seller, make sure it’s from a website/person(s) you trust. Brokers create websites/URLs similar to authorized websites to make you feel as if you are purchasing from an authorized vendor. Do NOT post pictures of your tickets on social media. Brokers will use them to create counterfeit tickets. Make sure that you read the terms and conditions of each secondary market website prior to purchasing tickets. Many secondary market websites do NOT offer refunds for invalid tickets.\n\nHow to spot a counterfeit ticket All tickets purchased through secondary markets are at risk of being invalid counterfeit tickets. All secondary market vendors have produced invalid counterfeit tickets that have been rejected at our stadium. The Gillette Stadium Ticket Office is unable to confirm the validity of tickets prior to entry into the stadium on the specific event date.\n\nWhat happens if my ticket does not scan? If your ticket(s) do not scan at the gate, please see a customer service representative located at the Ticket Office. These representatives will be able to offer an explanation regarding your ticket(s). If your ticket(s) don’t scan and they are brought to our office, the invalid ticket(s) will be confiscated. A photo copy of the ticket(s) will be given to the guest for their records. On game day, the Gillette Stadium Ticket Office offers each guest the ability to file a police report with a police officer. If there are any tickets for sale, guests are welcome to enter the sales line for a chance to purchase valid tickets sold at face value. The Gillette Stadium Ticket Office does not provide any scan reports for any event at our stadium."
