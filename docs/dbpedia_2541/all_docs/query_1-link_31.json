        "text": "As South Dakota State University athletic teams prepare to move into a fully renovated First Bank & Trust Arena in the fall of 2024, procedures and policies regarding ticketing for Jackrabbit basketball season tickets are beginning to take shape.\n\nThe transition to First Bank & Trust Arena will bring about a reseating in which all season ticket holders, regardless of donation or priority ranking, must re-select their seats. In an effort to most fairly allocate tickets, every seat in the arena will be available to be selected in the reseating process.\n\nTo qualify for the reseat, deposits for 2024-25 basketball season tickets will begin to be collected in February 2024 and must be fully paid by May 28, 2024, with amounts to be determined by the type and number of tickets intended to be purchased. Season ticket holders committed for the 2024-25 season will be notified in July 2024 of their seat selection dates, which will be determined by priority points as of June 1, 2024. Selection dates are tentatively scheduled for August and September 2024.\n\nWhen completed, First Bank & Trust Arena will maintain its current capacity of about 5,000 despite featuring larger seats with more leg space. Every seat in the current Frost Arena is being replaced in the renovation process, with approximately 220 seats in sections 212 and 213 (see map) designated as Midco Club seats. Additional premium seating options include 11 suites and six loge boxes.\n\nTo help gauge interest in club seating options, fans are asked to fill out an online information form. More information and a list of frequently asked questions can be found at BackTheJacks.com.\n\nSeason ticket purchasers will be limited to eight season tickets selected during the new seating reallocation process, of which a maximum of four will be courtside, Midco Club and lower-level premium seats. Additional season tickets may be purchased, based on availability, after all season ticket holders have completed the seat selection process.\n\nOther enhancements featured in the project include the installation of new Daktronics videoboards, playing floor and audio system.\n\nFor more information on how to invest in this one-of-a-kind venue, contact the SDSU Athletic Development Office at (605) 697-7475.\n\nThe season ticket process for Jackrabbit volleyball and wrestling, as well as Junior Jacks membership information, will be announced in the coming months.\n\nSeason tickets for the upcoming 2023-24 basketball season are currently on sale through JackrabbitTickets.com.\n\nDue to the ongoing construction, fans are asked to select a price level and preferred section, in addition to special accommodations needed, with seats to be assigned at a later date based on availability. Ticket office staff will reach out to all purchasers to confirm details, including status of required Jackrabbit Club donations.\n\n-GoJacks.com-"
