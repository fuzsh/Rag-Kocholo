        "text": "A 1993 alum, Darren recalls fond memories of attending games at Frost Arena during his years as an undergrad and was compelled to elevate the student experience that will accompany the renovation.\n\n“My favorite Frost Arena memory from college was getting to the game as soon as the doors opened,” said Darren. “With general admission seats running all the way down to the floor, students could get courtside seats – but you had to get there early.”\n\nTo Brian (’90), the Hefty Student Deck also aligns with their company’s business values, as well as their respect for education and SDSU. “As an organization, we award over 100 scholarships each year and intend to grow that number substantially in the future. Helping students get a great education and enjoy the college experience at the same time is important to us…We also plan to have messaging in that area to help promote the value and importance of the American farmer.”"
