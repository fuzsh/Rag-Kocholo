        "text": "November 3, 2014\n\nFaster and more transparent booking system for The Trusts Arena ticket buyers\n\nPatrons of The Trusts Arena in Auckland now have access to a new faster and more transparent booking system with the appointment of local company Eventfinda as their Preferred Ticketing Provider.\n\nAccording to Eventfinda CEO James McGlinn his company’s cloud-based ticketing system is fast, easy, non-intrusive and there are no surprise fees added to ticket purchases.\n\n“This has been a problem with ‘drip-pricing’ ticketing models where extra costs are not included in the headline price. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has raised concerns across the Tasman with multi-national ticketing companies for just such a model.\n\n“With Eventfinda ticket-buyers know exactly what they are paying up front because we always provide immediate display of all ticket charges from the moment of selection,” McGlinn says.\n\nAs the the preferred ticketing supplier for The Trusts Arena, the Trusts Grandstand and the Douglas Track and Field, Eventfinda becomes the recommended ticketing option for music, sports, lifestyle and family events across the venues.\n\n“This appointment represents a step change in the way we do business. Ticketing at major venues is the future for Eventfinda – with this appointment we are able to demonstrate we can deliver an industry-leading ticketing experience for our venue clients and their hirers.\n\n“We are very proud to be The Trusts Arena’s chosen supplier and we look forward to providing exceptional service to The Trusts Arena clients, promoters and consumers with Eventfinda’s award-winning ticketing platform.\n\nThe Trusts Arena’s ticketing system is based on a multi-vendor ticketing model enabling promoters to choose between Eventfinda or one of the three larger ticketing companies.\n\n“The multi-vendor ticketing model provides clients and patrons with a choice of ticketing options to suit the event, but retains control over the all-important patron experience. This provides real competition in a market where multi-vendor ticketing is yet to be embraced by the wider industry,” says Blake.\n\nThe Eventfinda website is the country’s leading source for event and live entertainment information, serving more than one million visits a month and is a Top 20 ranked website (Nielsen NetRatings).\n\nEventfinda New Zealand is the exclusive supplier of event information to the largest media websites in the country including Yahoo, MSN, New Zealand Herald and Fairfax with a further 100+ syndication arrangements with other online media and print publications.\n\nAbout Eventfinda\n\nEventfinda is an integrated event ticketing and marketing platform. Eventfinda makes it easy for event promoters, organisers and venues to list their events, have that information distributed to a range of content partners and control their own ticket sales, reporting and validation using award-winning cloud-based tools. Eventfinda also operates in Australia, Singapore and Austria.\n\nAbout The Trusts Arena\n\nSince opening in 2004 The Trusts Arena has become a focal point for events and festivals in Auckland and has a reputation for delivering world class service and hospitality. As one of Auckland’s busiest indoor venues The Trusts Arena has cemented its place as Auckland’s arena alternative for a wide range of music and entertainment events.\n\nENDS"
