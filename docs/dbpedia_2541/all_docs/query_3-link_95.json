        "text": "November 14th 2023\n\nHighly Suspects' performance was phenomenal. It felt as if the band themselves were genuinely ecstatic to be there performing for us Kiwis. The concert perfectly balanced the vibes of an arena worthy show of musicians at the top of their game and the more intimate jam sessions of a group of mates just enjoying the music. The only thing that let the experience down was the disparity between the forms of audience appreciation. Due to the aforementioned duality of the performance, some audience members clearly came with the purpose of getting rowdy and to mosh while others wanted to chill and vibe and this led to an environment that was confrontational and a little unsafe at times. All that said I look forward to any future events Highly Suspect may bring to NZ I may just find a new vantage point to enjoy them at comfortable distance from the fray.\n\nFebruary 17th 2023\n\nSo while the last minute change of venue ment that all of a sudden the show was sold out and many people couldn't make it anymore because of the floods and damage caused by cyclone Gabriel the bands came out to a packed if not intimate venue of The POWERSTATION. It was great seeing Social Distortion play a set that started with a nice bit of high energy. It felt like they slowed down with some melodic tunes before ramping back up to some of their biggest hits. Being in the mosh pit and not being afraid of holding up my phone for photos and videos was a nice surprise. And while photos were taken most of the time everyone was watching the band and not a screen. It was great having Mike talk to the fans telling them that the venue was limited to a Decibel rating because people live around there. Someone should slip the DB guy a roofee and make more noise. He told us of as a youngster he had an active imagination and enjoyed learning something in skool. (Who knew punks payed attention in class) he had plenty to say throughout the night and while sight seeing was limited due to bad weather he got to go for a swim... although not at a beach. But in all honesty he said kiwis are resilient people. When bad religion came on the energy went wild. More pushing and shoving jumping and cheering the crowd loved the pace that was set. Jay early on mentions that he needs his pick a bit longer as a fan must have been asking for it. Again things calmed down for a bit but ramped up with smash hits. With bad religion we had a bit of banter on stage between the members and also a few nice things said about the people of NZ. They left the stage ten till eleven but left the blue lights on. Jay comes out after some cheering from the crowd and says to the other guys it's their fault (meaning us fans) Greg quips that we(the peoples) noticed that they missed one,Jay questioned one? But no-one engaged as they ripped out a couple more hits from the beginning. I love a punk show.\n\nWiebe"
