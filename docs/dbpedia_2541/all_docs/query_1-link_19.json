        "text": "Super Bowl 58 is upon us, promising a clash of titans on the gridiron at Allegiant Stadium. But just five miles away, another spectacle looms large: the Sphere.\n\nLas Vegas' newest marvel is more than just a venue; it's a technological behemoth pushing the boundaries of entertainment, with a capacity of 18,600 people and a 16K resolution wraparound interior LED screen.\n\nThe $2.3 billion venue's construction began in 2019, opening in September 29, 2023 with a show by the Irish rock band, U2. The Sphere is just off the Las Vegas Strip and east of the Venetian resort, spanning approximately 18 acres.\n\nHere's what you need to know about The Sphere in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Sphere Las Vegas capacity\n\nThe Sphere in Las Vegas boasts a truly staggering capacity, as the venue can comfortably accommodate 18,600 people, immersing them in the action thanks to a unique design that wraps the audience around two-thirds of the sphere, while the stage takes up the remainder.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Super Bowl 58 rooting guide for Big Ten teams: Chiefs, 49ers players who played in conference\n\nWith standing room utilized, the Sphere's capacity jumps to a whopping 20,000, making it one of the largest entertainment venues in the world.\n\nHow much did it it cost to build the Vegas Sphere?\n\nThe Vegas Sphere, with its dazzling LED exterior and immersive interior, comes with a hefty price tag. Originally estimated at $1.2 billion in 2019, the final construction cost ballooned to a staggering $2.3 billion, making it the most expensive entertainment venue ever built in Las Vegas.\n\nConstruction costs increased due to the global supply chain crisis and inflation surge of the past three years. Its massive price tag beat out the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium, which seats 65,000 people in an NFL setting.\n\nWhat is the Vegas Sphere used for?\n\nThe massive, immersive space primarily serves as a concert arena, showcasing musical acts with the help of its revolutionary 16K LED wrap-around screen and spatial sound system. Headliners U2, Phish, and Dead & Company are set to perform in the Sphere in 2024.\n\nThe Sphere is part of the Formula 1 Las Vegas Strip Circuit, and will play host to the 2024 NHL Entry draft from June 28th to 29th. UFC will also host an event on Mexican Independence day in September.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Even Chiefs players surprised Lions didn't make Super Bowl: 'They had a hell of a season'\n\nWho owns the Vegas Sphere?\n\nThe Vegas Sphere, previously known as the MSG Sphere, underwent a change in ownership in April 2023. It was originally part of Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE), but the company split into two entities. Sphere Entertainment Company, led by James Dolan, took over ownership of the venue, renaming it simply \"Sphere.\"\n\nThe land underneath both the Sphere and the Venetian Resort is owned by Vici Properties, a real estate investment trust. So, while Sphere Entertainment manages the operations and events within the venue, the land itself resides under different ownership.\n\nInside the Vegas Sphere\n\nIn a segment on NBC, NBC News' Gadi Schwartz was taken on a tour of the Sphere, and viewers can see a few shots inside the entertainment arena, which is unlike any other venue in the world.\n\n\"It's impossible to describe,\" James Dolan told Schwartz. \"It's like trying to explain what a peanut butter and jelly sandwich tastes like to somebody who's never tasted one.\""
