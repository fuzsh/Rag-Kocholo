        "text": "Acrisure Arena, the first large-scale arena to be constructed in the greater Palm Springs area, opened in Thousand Palms on Dec. 14, 2022 with a sold-out comedy show co-headlined by Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.\n\nThere were a few kinks that needed to be worked out — like the parking situation — as guests navigated the 300,000-square foot venue that sits on 43 acres of desert just off of the I-10 Freeway between Cook and Washington streets.\n\nHowever, the $300-plus million project, which is privately funded through the sports and live entertainment investment and development company Oak View Group, the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken and concert promoters Live Nation, had a pretty spectacular first-year run. The arena, that is also home to the American Hockey League’s Coachella Valley Firebirds team, hosted numerous hockey games and tournaments, college basketball games, a Los Angeles Lakers NBA preseason game, dozens of concerts and other live events within its inaugural year.\n\n“I think just the opening itself is a huge accomplishment,” John Page, senior vice president of Acrisure Arena, said during a recent phone interview. “Anytime you open a venue in a market that hasn’t had an arena or a professional hockey team … just watching the momentum build from the middle of December last year to present day, it’s an unbelievable story. The excitement, people’s affinity for the venue and really appreciating what they have here now so they don’t have to travel so far for entertainment, it’s exciting.”\n\nPage also added that thanks to so many new partnerships with concert and live event promoters, “We’re proving that if you build it, they will come,” he said. “That’s exactly what’s happened here.”\n\nIf we’re going by the numbers, Acrisure Arena is an 11,000-capacity, multi-purpose indoor arena that has, so far, seen more than 1 million guests walk through its doors. It’s hosted sold-out shows by the Eagles, Harry Styles, John Mayer, Lizzo, Paramore, Grupo Firme and is set to ring in the New Year with Los Angeles rock band Mötley Crüe on Dec. 31.\n\nTo date, Acrisure Arena has put on 54 concerts and events, selling more than 800,000 total tickets and grossing more than $50 million in ticket sales, according to Page and his team. The Coachella Valley Firebirds played 36 home games, which included 16 playoff games, and set a AHL playoff attendance record for the most fans to come out and support a single team in league history.\n\nAccording to the venue administration, they’ve sold 13,619 Tanners Burgers, 48,675 boxes of popcorn, 21,189 Shaq Big Chicken Sandwiches, 45,313 plates of nachos, 19,055 hot dogs, 40,523 BuzzBox premium cocktails, 240,493 cans of beer, 16,617 gallons of draft beer and 81,427 bottles of soda.\n\nA lot of that Page attributes to the building’s more grab-and-go style of concessions, which he said a few spots are currently being updated and tested to expedite the guest experience. Though alcohol sales have been steady, the venue also has an elevated non-acholic beverage program in partnership with Strand Together and the 1 Million Strong initiative.\n\n“We have a mocktail program that’s been really successful for people that have had challenges in their lives,” Page said. “And we’ve been promoting that so that they can have an opportunity to participate in the events and have a drink that doesn’t impact their sobriety. That’s been a real positive.”\n\nIn January, Acrisure Arena was trending thanks to mega pop star Harry Styles announcing he’d wrap up his Love On Tour run at the venue with two shows, including one on his 29th birthday on Feb. 1.\n\n“That was incredible, having Harry come out, particularly on his birthday, and doing that before the Grammys,” Page said of Styles’ shows, noting that it was a quick turnaround with only about four weeks in between the confirmation and showtime. “When we looked back at our data, it was amazing how many people came from all over the world to those shows. We had people from South America, Europe and across the United States, too.”\n\nHe also said Styles’ shows truly put the venue to the test as it was situated in the round.\n\n“It was an unbelievable first show with the center stage and almost 11,000 people,” he recalled. “It was a quick turn-and-burn for us.”\n\nTo honor its commitment to be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2025, the arena is continuing to take big steps to ensure sustainably.\n\n“One of the features of being in the desert is solar and as we look to build that out there’s been some supply-chain delays in transformers,” he noted. In the future, there will be a parking structure that will be topped with solar panels that will power the venue.\n\n“From our operating systems to our recycling programs, there’s a commitment from everybody to make sure we’re able to achieve those results at the end of the day,” he said.\n\nTo help with navigating a newer venue and with parking, he said they’ve been actively reaching out to ticketholders with the most up-to-date “know before you go” information to help make that process more seamless. They’ve also added off-site parking with shuttle services to and from the venue. Since temperatures can easily soar into the 100s in the spring and summer months, Page said they’re adding things like shade canopies and water misters to help make outdoor areas of the venue more comfortable for patrons and staff, as well as create areas that are more resistant to the sudden wind gusts and sand storms to which the area is prone.\n\nIn 2024, the venue has a packed first quarter, including shows by the Eagles with Steely Dan on The Long Goodbye Tour on Jan. 16; Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull & Ricky Martin’s The Trilogy Tour on Feb. 2; Gloria Trevi on Feb. 9; Marc Anthony’s Historia Tour on Feb. 14; Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts World Tour kick-off on Feb. 23; Madonna’s The Celebration Tour on March 13; Blake Shelton’s Back to the Honky Tonk Tour on March 22 and more.\n\nThey’re also bringing in the WWE Road to WrestleMania on March 2 and Professional Bull Riding on March 15-16 and there are dozens of Firebirds games starting on Dec. 13 when the team takes on the Abbotsford Canucks.\n\n“It’s all about the little success stories,” Page said of his most memorable moments of 2023. “It’s the joy that people have in their eyes and the excitement and intensity that’s pent up before the act goes on. That’s the incredible part about being in this business for so long is there’s an appreciation of that live event and to experience the joy when people are coming in with their families and friends and seeing what happens when the lights go down and the act goes on stage. There’s been so many positive events here to date and I’m looking forward to so many more in the future.”\n\nAcrisure Arena\n\nWhere: 75702 Varner Road, Thousand Palms\n\nContact: 888-695-8778 or acrisurearena.com"
