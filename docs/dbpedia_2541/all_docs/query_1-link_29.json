These dispensers use coreless paper rolls.\n\nWhere possible, we have replaced T12 fluorescent lights with T8 fluorescent lights, reducing electrical consumption in those lights by 34%. We have even begun implementing energy saving technology on our motors and cooling towers.\n\nAll of the cleaning products now being used at The Broadmoor World Arena meet and/or exceed Green Industry standards. They are all EPA, Green Seal and SEGC 114 certified.\n\nEven our newsletter has “gone green.” The Backstage Pass (official newsletter of The Broadmoor World Arena and Pikes Peak Center) is now exclusively sent via email. If you are interested in upcoming events, priority sale and meet and greet opportunities, please sign up for the newsletter.\n\nWe invite you to help us as we continue this important work.\n\nPlease take the opportunity to use the recycling bins.\n\nPlease tell an Arena staff person if you notice running water or leaking faucets.\n\nPlease share other environmentally friendly ideas with us by email."
