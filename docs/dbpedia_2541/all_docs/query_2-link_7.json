        "text": "More\n\nThe Trusts Stadium Arena has been the backdrop to some of the biggest events in New Zealand. Whether its 3,500 people for an eight course meal or 5,000 people to a concert, millions of Kiwi's have come from across New Zealand to watch some of the best entertainment this country seen. From MUSE to Indoor snowboarding, you name it, we've done it. With fixed and retractable seating, the arena accommodates upto 5,000 people for a range of events. The Arena can also operate in a smaller theatre format for that more intimate concert show by sectioning off areas to maintain intimacy. This flexibility provides a perfect performance space for smaller audiences. With our massive 4,900 Sqm floor and now greatly improved roof loading ability we can cater to an even wider range of shows. For every event held at The Trusts Stadium Arena it is possible to entertain in one of our Segregated Corporate Spaces - whether its for a pre-show drink or sophistiated meal get in touch with us and we will make it happen for you. . The Trusts Stadium Arena is located within easy distance from Auckland city, just 15 kilometres away and just off the Lincoln Road exit off the North Western Motorway. There is plenty of public parking on site; there are also over 2000 car parks located within easy walking distance and most of them are free. For many of our larger shows we also run shuttle buses which can collect you from major transport hubs prior to the show and deliver you back after the show."
