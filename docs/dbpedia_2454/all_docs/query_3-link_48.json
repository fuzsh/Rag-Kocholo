        "text": "Daddy would’ve been 90 today\n\nSteve Stockdale\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n7 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n--\n\nI’m not sure of the exact boundaries of the area, but they’re generally the southeastern states to include Texas in the west. That’s the area where, based on my experience, you’re more likely than not in the rural and smaller towns to hear boys and girls, women and men, refer to their father as, “Daddy.”\n\nRegardless of age. That’s what I called him when he was alive–Daddy–so I’ll do him the honor of not changing it when he can’t defend himself.\n\nSome things about my Daddy\n\nHe took a year off from college while I was being gestated to work for the Santa Fe railroad. Like his father-in-law.\n\nHe was a band director.\n\nHe played clarinet, but played drums in a swing combo to help pay his college tuition.\n\nHe was a ham radio operator — W5CHX. (Believe it or not, my sister bought this card on eBay. It documents my dad’s first ham radio contact in Mississippi in 1955 — see the line just about his name in lower right.)"
