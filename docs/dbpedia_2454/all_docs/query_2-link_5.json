Additionally each ambassador must participate in committees that align with the SPP’s business needs and public relations efforts.

These include:\n\nQuarterly High Achievement Awards. Each quarter, an “Ambassador of the Quarter” is recognized for achievements that go above and beyond the minimum requirements of the program.\n\nTeam Socials. To foster getting to know each other and increase trust building, ambassadors participate in quarterly get-togethers. These have included hikes, escape rooms, roller skating, and virtual game nights, to name a few.\n\nDean/Associate Dean Socials. Occasionally, ambassadors are given the opportunity to interact with the Dean and/or Associate Dean of the SPP through ambassador-only meetings.\n\nOther Information\n\nTeam Management\n\nAll ambassadors are supervised by a staff member, the Director of External Engagement, who is the founding director of the ambassador program.\n\nTwo student workers are delegated to lead two committees:\n\nA program manager (Chief or Vice Chief) leads the podcast committee.\n\nA program manager (Chief or Vice Chief) leads the events committee.\n\nProbationary Period\n\nAll newly appointed ambassadors undergo a probationary period during their first quarter of service.\n\nAmbassadors will undergo a performance appraisal at the conclusion of their probationary quarter as well as on an ongoing basis.\n\nAll ambassadors must furnish at least a 3.2 cumulative GPA by the end of their first quarter as an ambassador.\n\nDress Code\n\nBusiness professional is the default attire for ambassadors at ambassadorial functions involving special guests of the School, unless otherwise noted.

Doing so would be a conflict of interest (cf. how U.S. Ambassadors cannot concurrently serve as a U.S. Senator, as they serve in different branches of government).\n\nDismissal\n\nAmbassadors may be dismissed from the program due to unsatisfactory academic performance, lack of participation, lack of adherence to the program's shared values and/or policies and procedures, or any gross misconduct (e.g. plagiarism, breach of confidentiality, violence, sexual harassment, etc.), at the discretion of the Director of External Engagement and Leadership.\n\nStaff Supervisor:"
