        "text": "Audio articles on Wilson County News made possible by C Street Gift Shop in downtown Floresville!\n\nOn Sunday, June 16, 2024, the world of those who knew Stephanie Leann Seelk became quieter and much less bright with her untimely passing due to complications from diabetes.\n\nStephanie was blessed with a smile that would brighten a room, a laugh that was contagious, and the ability to find humor anywhere she went. She had a magnetic personality, and everyone wanted to be around her and be her friend, which came in handy in her career as an educator and school counselor.\n\nStephanie was the only child born to Willie F. Seelk and Sylvia Schubert Seelk on July 29, 1969. She was just shy of her 55th birthday when she left this world to be with her Savior.\n\nShe was preceded in death by both her parents and her grandparents.\n\nAlthough Stephanie was taken too soon from us, she lived a life well lived and was blessed with many friends along the way.\n\nStephanie believed in education, was a lifelong learner and educator/counselor for 33 years. Her life of education began at St. James Catholic School in Seguin, Texas, where she attended from kindergarten through eighth-grade. She attended high school in Stockdale where she became a Brahma and was active in many school organizations. After graduation from Stockdale High School, as the valedictorian, she enrolled and attended Texas A&M where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Education.\n\nHer first teaching job was at Pleasanton Junior High where she was a reading teacher for a few years until she earned her Master in School Counseling from Kingsville A&M University. Shortly after earning her degree, she was hired as a counselor at Pleasanton Junior High School, where she worked helping the youth for over 25 years.\n\nIn her 33 years at Pleasanton, she helped with many different organizations including cheerleading, student council, and honor society sponsor and serving as a leader and sponsor for many more including The Eagle Closet which she helped to manage and maintain. This was a project close to her heart because it helped children with their needs including clothing, shoes, school supplies, hygiene products, and food for home. During her years at Pleasanton Independent School District, she touched the lives of many students and developed many friendships along the way. She was truly a treasure to her Pleasanton Eagle family and will be missed greatly by her students and colleagues as well.\n\nHer influence has changed the lives of many and helped so many others along the way with her incredible listening, advising, guidance, and counseling skills. Her passion in life was helping others, especially the youth.\n\nShe chose to help the youth at her alma mater by being a founding member of the Stockdale ISD Education Foundation. The foundation raises money to help teachers enhance the learning of students. She was a hardworking board member that was in charge of evaluating the grants and most importantly preparing and helping to host the gala each year to raise the funds. Stephanie was looking forward to retiring after this coming school year so she could focus more on raising funds for the foundation.\n\nStephanie is survived by her uncle, Delton Seelk of Seguin, and first cousins Winn Lindsey and wife Angel of La Vernia and Karol Kennedy of McDade.\n\nBeing an only child and from a small family Stephanie chose to adopt several of her friends as her family, which she is survived by Beverly Hummel, her best friend for over 40 years, and her family including the Baker and the Johnson families. She was lovingly referred to and introduced as “my other daughter” by Beverly’s dad, Pete. Stephanie and Beverly met as freshmen in high school, were college roommates, confidantes, co-conspirators, and each other’s ride or die until the time of Stephanie’s death. They were constant companions and were always there for each other during the good times and hard times. When they were together laughter could always be heard! Many hours were spent at family gatherings playing spinner dominoes and various games throughout the years. After Stephanie’s parents’ death, she spent many holidays enjoying the food and festivities making Beverly’s family her own. They had planned on retiring together and traveling and building a house where they could grow old and take care of each other … being the crazy old women living on the hill.\n\nStephanie is also survived by Jay Martin, her friend, running buddy, and personal fix it man for over 30 years, and his whole Martin family. He was her almost every Friday night eating buddy, estate sale partner in crime, and traveling buddy, where casinos were their main target. Lady Luck was something they both seemed to have in common and they enjoyed traveling all over the South seeing which one “had the nicest bathrooms”. Over the years, she enjoyed watching his children grow and spending time at their house enjoying a night of good food cooked by Jay, games, and just hanging out. Jay was very good at taking care of her and was known to send home leftovers, so she didn’t have to cook. She loved going to the Martin’s family gatherings, holiday dinners, and getting to enjoy the tasty food especially LaDonna’s lemon meringue pie and dressing. But most importantly the visiting. She was considered as one of the Martins and was so happy to be part of their wonderful family.\n\nShe is also survived by Mary Howard of Pleasanton, her friend for 29 years. When asked how she became a Howard it was all Gracie’s fault and Stephanie was glad for it. She started by helping Gracie in middle school with tutoring and it bloomed into an instant friendship with her mother, Mary, who was also blessed with the best sense of humor. Laughter seemed to just flow from them when they were together. Stephanie and Mary had a great friendship and were there for each other through good times, bad times, and fun times. Stephanie and Mary both worked for the Pleasanton school district until Mary’s retirement. Then they had a standing date to eat together each week and catch up. It was a bright spot each week that Stephanie looked forward to. Through the years, they enjoyed traveling to many different places including California, Rockport, Canyon Lake, and most recently becoming cruisers, in the last two years. Where they got to experience the Bahamas and Mexico through their excursions. But most of all Stephanie enjoyed being included in their family celebrations.\n\nStephanie, who had no children of her own, claimed her “Framilies” — friends that became family — kids as “her kids’”. They include Brandi Baker Whitener and husband Cary of Kingsburry and children Kaseton and KayliJo, Charlee Baker of Sutherland Springs (both girls followed her example and became educators); Logan Baker of Sutherland Springs, currently at Texas A&M where he just ordered his Aggie ring (she was so proud of him being an Aggie); Chance Martin and wife Cheyanne of Weatherford and children Edward and Elliette; Skyler Martin Catiller and husband John of Seguin and children Payton, Piper and baby boy on the way; Gracie Littlefield of Pleasanton and son Philip; and Gregory Howard Jr. and wife Amy of Pleasanton and children Charlotte and Gregory III. She loved each and every one of her kids and enjoyed watching them as they grew up and became adults and parents. She was their bonus aunt and was their confidant and counselor whenever they needed advise along their journey in life. They will serve as her honorary pallbearers.\n\nStephanie loved having fun, spending time with friends and family, and traveling, which she learned from her parents who traveled every summer while she was growing up. She also had a flare for fashion and was always up to date on the latest fashion trends. She had a fondness for animal prints, turquoise, bling, and purses. She loved shopping and many shopping trips were enjoyed with her friends. She loved traveling and was excited when it involved the games of chance, which made her recently found love of going on cruises an excellent choice. These trips gave her so much joy and led to much laughter.\n\nHer laughter is something that will be missed by all. It was one of a kind and just made everyone around want to know the person with the contagious laughter and sparkling eyes. She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, July 13, at 10:30 a.m., in Stockdale Church of Christ in Stockdale.\n\nA private burial will follow at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, her loved ones ask that donations be sent to Stockdale ISD Education Foundation, P.O. Box 7, Stockdale, TX 78160 in memory of Stephanie Seelk or Pleasanton Junior High School, Eagle Closet/ Seelk, 1140 Jolly Street, Pleasanton, TX 78064."
