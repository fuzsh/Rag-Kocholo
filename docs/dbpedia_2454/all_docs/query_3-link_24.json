Everyone has so much fun and there is plenty of room to network and sell.”\n\n– Jake Stuebbe, VE Regional Director\n\n“The feeling of getting first place in our marketing plan competition at Bay Area was more than I could describe in words. Working hard for months, the looks on my team’s faces after getting called for our award made it all worth it. I love the Bay Area trade show and think that it provides an experience of a lifetime for all Virtual Enterprise students.”\n\n– Vance Carsso, Safe N’ Sound, Murrieta Valley"
