The campus was still in construction and she was located on California Avenue across from Cain Memorial Church. The college offices were on Chester and California at that time. She was the first African-American hired at California State College. All staff employees at that time moved to the new campus in August 1970.\n\nIn 1977, while employed at Cal State Bakersfield, Kathy was selected as an outstanding staff member. She was honored with a plaque for outstanding service to Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) in 2000, and received a plaque for outstanding service to students from the African-American Student Union and EOP in 2004. Kathy worked for the EOP Director, Mr. Lee Adams, for 26.5 years until his death in January 2000. She was reclassified to an Administrative Assistant Specialist in 1990 under Lee Adams. During the period of 2000-2004, she worked with Mr. Keith Powell, who became the EOP Director after Mr. Adams' demise. She continued her service in Educational Support Services until her retirement on December 31, 2004. Kathy's years of service at CSUB totaled 35 years. Since her retirement, she continues to stay active as she is a committee member of the Ernest W. Williams Scholarship Program at CSUB.\n\nDr. Janet Ford Shell was a founding staff member of California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB). In 1970 Dr. Shell began her tenure with the campus which was at that time named California State Bakersfield. Dr. Shell was temporarily assigned to a 'farm houseâ located near Ashe and Ming Avenue. With the combined staff from the California State University, Fresno Center and CSUB farm house location, she moved to the âfar, far out on the west end of townâ new main campus without running water or trees in August 1970. She served on several campus and state committees before leaving CSUB Library as Head of Circulation Services. She served as the Contract Administrator for the Kern County Public Works Department until 1989.

She is an active member of several community organizations, and ardent supporter and advocate for educational, youth and senior citizen programs.\n\nAs a founding staff member, Dorothy joined California State College in 1969 and was listed in the time capsule. She began her tenure working at an off-site facility â the old farm ranch house off Ashe Road (between Stockdale Highway and Ming Avenue) in the cataloging department, along with her Library Supervisor, Janice Kirkland. Dorothy was a very kind person who took time to feed the squirrels during her lunch.\n\nIn August of 1970, personnel from Fresno Library Center and the old ranch house site moved to campus near the dorms (Student Housing) without trees or running water. She took potty breaks by driving two â three miles to the Stockdale Inn on the corner of Stockdale Highway and New Stine Road (now a service station) or to the Mayfair Market on Sundale Avenue (now Kern High School District Administration Offices).\n\nIn 1970, she later moved into a new two-story Library Facility across from Dorothy Donahue Hall where the current School of Education Building resides.\n\nDr. Willis Hill was employed as a counselor in the University Counseling Center at California State University Bakersfield (CSUB). In addition to being a full time counselor, 1988-89, Dr. Hill was appointed as the first University Ombudsman. He worked with faculty, administrators and staff to resolve issues involving students. Hill says, âThe Ombudsman position was challenging but extremely rewardingâ. Hill said, âRecognition by students and the University community represented the highest acknowledgement.â At the 34th Annual Commencement of 2004, Hill was awarded Emeritus for his works. Hill is very thankful and appreciative of the faculty for their honor and recognition. He was one of the founding members along with Lee Adams, George Calhoun, William Perry and Charles Craig who initiated the Ernest W. Williams scholarship fund for African- American students.\n\nInformation was extracted from the CSUB Runner dated February 16, 1994, when interviewed by Staff Writer, Michael Benshoof. Headline reads: Willis Hill's Gentle Touch Brings Comfort to CSUB. No one would ever guess that Willis Hill is a man who appreciates conflict. The soft-spoken reserved Associate Director of Counseling and Ombudsman for CSUB actually enjoys going the extra mile and encouraging people is his favorite pastime. As friends and associates said about Hill âhe is the gentlest, kindest human being in the world.â But it's absolutely true,â insists fellow CSUB counselor, Bobbie George, a colleague of Hill's for over 20 years, âHe is just delightful.â\n\nIn 1961 William Perry came to Bakersfield from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to play football at Bakersfield Community College (BC). After graduating from BC in 1964, he attended Fresno Extension, which was located across from BC's campus. Also, in that year, he married long-time Bakersfield resident, Margo Malone. They have two sons, David and Kevin, both residents of Bakersfield.\n\nIn 1971, Bill Perry was offered a position at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB). His first assignment was Placement Counselor and he later became Director of Career Planning and Placement. During this time, he earned his MA in Education at CSUB and continued his education receiving his doctorate in Higher Education Administration at Brigham Young University in August 1977. At CSUB, he later became Associate Dean of Students and eventually Assistant Vice President for Student Life. His responsibilities included overseeing of Student Activities, Housing, Counseling, Children's Center, Career Planning and Placement and Advisor to Associated Students, Incorporated. He was one of the founding members along with George Calhoun, Willis Hill, Lee Adams and Charley Craig who initiated the Ernest W. Williams scholarship fund for African-American Students.\n\nDr. Ira Trail was the founding Dean of the Nursing Program in 1970/1971. The first president of California State College (which is what it was called back then), Paul Romberg, the first president sought out Dr. Trail. She had mixed feelings at first in starting the program. One of the many hats that she wore was the hiring of staff and faculty. Ira was instrumental in the naming of the Nursing Department, Paul Romberg. Dr. Stanley E. Clark, Director of Liberal Studies and Professor and Chair of Political Science at CSUB says, \"My memory of her was as a strong, intelligent woman with a good sense of humor. She was also very sensitive about race and ethnicity and the difficulties of using racially sensitive public policies to try to undo the injustices of the past. She clearly understood the need for what was then called affirmative action, but she also saw its limits.\" If she were alive today, she would undoubtedly be an articulate spokesperson for public policies to help young people rise in adverse circumstances, but she would also demand effort.\n\nDr. Stanley E. Clark spent a distinguished 44-plus year career here at California State University Bakersfield (CSUB). Dr. Clark joined the faculty as an associate professor of Political Science in 1972. His many leadership positions included serving as Acting Chair of Political Science (1976-1982); Chair of Political Science (1985-2001 & 2004-2006); Associate Dean of the School of Humanities & Social Sciences (2006-2010); and Director of Liberal Studies (2010-2016).\n\nWhile at CSUB, Dr. Stanley Clark was instrumental in building the pre-law concentration and program both in the Department of Political Science. He mentored countless students as they considered law school, spending many hours providing them with one-on-one advising, and helping them with their personal statements and applications. Dr. Clark treated the path to law school as a vocation and guided students though their discernment process. Dr. Clark's legacy also includes the founding of the Politics Research Center, which supports research and consulting to enhance student training, faculty teaching, and professional competence. Dr. Clark served as the director from 1996-2016. Dr. Clark developed and taught more than 30 different courses here at CSUB. Dr. Clark was also a founding member of the Earnest W. Williams Scholarship Committee and served on the committee for many years. Sadly, Dr. Clark passed away on April 12, 2018. His legacy will live on here at CSUB and in the hearts of countless students he mentored along the way.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the late Reverend Dr. Tyree Toliver championed the cause of equal access to education, employment, financial services and housing in southeast Bakersfield, one of California's poorest communities. He was a highly respected community and religious leader, a pioneer of the 1960s anti-discrimination, anti-segregation and anti-poverty movements at a time when racial struggle, overt discrimination and de facto segregation were a part of Bakersfield. As pastor of Saint John Missionary Baptist Church, the once largest African-American congregation in Bakersfield, he brought together a coalition of African-American, Latino, East Indian and Native American community organizers and residents to effect civil and social change.\n\nA staunch believer in excellence through education, Rev. Toliver led a grassroots effort in 1970 to establish a permanent library in southeast Bakersfield. The Holloway-Gonzales Library stands as a testament to his unwavering advocacy and leadership. Rev. Toliver led nonviolent marches against the discriminatory hiring practices of downtown Bakersfield retailers who refused to hire blacks, marching alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in an historic local march. He established the St. John Federal Credit Union in 1974, Kern County's first black-owned credit union. In 1983, he developed the St. John Manor Senior Housing Complex, HUD's first housing development project with an African-American organization in Kern County.\n\nThe opening of California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) in 1970 brought the promise of access to higher education to a community that had no university within a 100-mile radius. Rev. Toliver served two four-year terms on the President's Advisory Board under two CSUB presidents, voicing the need for inclusion and diversity in university admissions. He earned a bachelor's degree in theology from Conroe College, and a master's degree in Christian education and an honorary doctorate from St. John Theological Seminary. He served as pastor of St. John Missionary Baptist Church for 50 years until retiring in 2007. He passed away in June 2008.\n\nIn recognition of his distinguished leadership, his commitment to social justice and equal rights, and his service to California State University, Bakersfield, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and California State University, Bakersfield are proud to confer upon the late Dr. Reverend Tyree Toliver the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.\n\nJudy Fambrough-Billingsley was raised and educated in Bakersfield attending McKinley Elementary School, several years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling separate but equal unconstitutional in the Brown vs Board of Education of Topeka case. After attending Emerson Middle School she was one of the first five African American students to attend Garces Memorial High School and become their first African American Cheerleader. Her parents were lifetime members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) resulting in her involvement in the fight for freedom and justice. She served as President of the NAACP Youth Council and an active member of Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) participating in several sitins. An alumnus of California State University, Bakersfield she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, and a California Lifetime Teaching Credential. Twenty years teaching at West High School and Bakersfield High School she became Dean of Students at South High School after earning a Master's Degree in Education Administration from the University of La Verne. Advancing her career she moved to Sacramento serving as Vice Principal, Principal of Sacramento High School and other administrative positions while attending Harvard Leadership Training. After retiring she published the memoir, Too Brown To Keep: A Search For Love, Forgiveness, and Healing. The mother to two successful sons, two successful daughters-in-law, and âNanaâ to four grandsons and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Omega Omega Chapter of Bakersfield, Judy finds time to serve her church and community in many ways.\n\nFirst African American Miss Kern County 1970\n\nCarolyn Jeanie (Hodge) Hill is a product of Bakersfield, California. She attended the local schools, Potomac Elementary, Lincoln Junior High School and Bakersfield High School. She received her Bachelor's Degree in English Literature, from California State University Bakersfield. She is an accomplished writer, public speaker and owner of CJ Enterprises, Event Planning. Her community activism has spanned over 35 years collaborating with a variety of local churches, community groups and professional associations in an effort to focus on educational awareness, health and wellness, accessing college to scholarships and training in social and life skills for the African American youth in Kern County. In an effort to ensure the continued development of the social and life skills for African American youth, Jeanie developed curriculum and conducted etiquette and life skills classes in her home, escorted students on cultural field trips, introduced students to world cuisines and facilitated group discussions on different genres of literature of Black novelists, poets and authors.\n\nFeatured in a recently authored book by Dr. William Haynes entitled, âAfrican American Women Trailblazers; A Celebration of Africa's Gift to Kern County,â Jeanie's life's story is revealed in a snapshot of many âfirstsâ as an African American female in Kern County and the struggles that ensued along her journey: First African American Song Leader, BHS 1968; First African American âMiss Kern Countyâ 1970; First African American female Operations Manager, Bank of America 1985; First African American female Branch Manager, Bank of America 1994; and First African American female Executive in the Public Transportation System-Bakersfield. She considers the opportunity to have possibly opened a door, illuminated a path or cleared underbrush for other women to pass safely through the rough terrains of professions, business or life, both an honor and a blessing.\n\nJeanie's collaborations and community partnerships have included serving on the Boards of the Boys and Girls Club, the Michael Stewart Foundation and the Professional Women's Network of Kern County. Other past and current civic, cultural, professional and community alliances include the African American Network, Friendship House, the Black Infant Health Program, Ronald McDonald House, Bakersfield Museum of Arts, Black Chamber of Commerce, National Society of Human Resource Professionals, American Public Transportation Association, Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated-Kappa Omega Omega Chapter, and the Links Incorporated.\n\nJeanie currently resides in Bakersfield, California, with her husband of 45 years, Andrew L. Hill Sr. They have two sons, Anthony Jason Hill, a Software Engineer and wife, Andrew Lee Hill Jr., Special Education Teacher and wife, and five amazing, adorable grandchildren.\n\nQuote to remember: âRise to the highest part of yourself by speaking to others through a place of truth, peace and grace. Be positive and authentic. Don't be afraid to face your critics or get discouraged by the processÃ¢Â¦As sure as you live and breathe there will be critics but remember out of rejection comes direction and that momentary trouble it may cause is just a form of transportation to elevate you to where God intended you to be.â"
