        "text": "UNT Foundation Awards\n\nUNT Foundation Eminent Faculty Award\n\nAlicia Re Cruz\n\nAnthropology\n\nDr. Alicia Re Cruz is a scholar, professor, mentor, mother of three wonderful young Latino men, wife, daughter, and proud to intersect these roles “with her own accent.” Much of her professional life has been colored by her efforts in creating and being part of “communities”; this has been the survival strategy that she learned in El Puente de Vallecas, a low income barrio where she was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. Anthropology is her life’s work, profoundly inspired by Women’s and Gender Studies in nurturing the passion to learn from people, to work with people, to create a philosophy of “togetherness”. For her, it is the essential tool for social justice and equity.\n\nDr. Re Cruz received her BA degree in Geography and History, with a specialty in American Ethnology and Anthropology from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, and her MA and PhD in Anthropology from State University of New York at Albany in 1992. This same year she became the third faculty member of the Institute of Anthropology at UNT. Dr. Re Cruz became the Chair of the Department from 2007 to 2011.\n\nRead More\n\nUNT Foundation Faculty Leadership Award\n\nCorey Marks\n\nEnglish\n\nDr. Corey Marks, a University Distinguished Teaching Professor, has taught poetry at the University of North Texas since 2000, and he became Director of Creative Writing for the Department of English in 2005.

She also researches practices of feminist/activist-oriented pedagogy in addition to public enactments of grief. Suzanne has published analyses of gendered violence in Communication & Critical/Cultural Studies, Communication, Culture & Critique, Critical Studies in Media Communication, and Women’s Studies in Communication, in addition to chapters in Family Violence: Communication Processes and Mediated Boyhood: Boys, Teens, and Tweens in Popular Culture and Media. With funding from the Organization for Research on Women and Communication (ORWAC), she conducted (36) life history interviews with incarcerated women; the first article from this project was published in Text & Performance Quarterly. She is currently working on a book manuscript tentatively titled Storying Carceral Survival: Exploring Women's Pathways to Incarceration. For her work at the nexus of gendered violence and activism, she earned the National Communication Association’s (NCA’s) Critical & Cultural Studies Division’s 2016 Outstanding Scholar-Activist award.\n\nAt UNT, Suzanne teaches courses rooted in social justice and civic engagement including Gender & Communication, Social Movements & Resistance, Feminist Criticism, and Rhetoric & Popular Culture. In teaching the Gender & Communication course, Suzanne’s students coordinated 15 large-scale public outreach events known as the Gender Fair between 2009 and 2018. This day-long interactive event centers students as researchers, offering the opportunity to re-imagine the intersecting constraints of identity including gender, race, sexuality, ability, and class. This event has attracted 500-900 visitors at each of the (15) Gender Fairs.\n\nRead More\n\nUNT Foundation Outstanding Lecturer Award\n\nKaren Dorff\n\nDesign\n\nKaren Dorff is the coordinator of the Communication Design program, Graphic Design track and principal lecturer in UNT’s College of Visual Arts and Design.

When she's not working, Dr. Stockdale enjoys spending time with her family, taking photographs (especially with historical analogue cameras and film), playing with her dogs, traveling to new places, exploring cuisines, and enjoying the outdoors.\n\nUniversity Distinguished Teaching Professorship Award\n\nCarol Wickstrom\n\nTeacher Education and Administration\n\nDr. Carol Wickstrom joined the UNT faculty in 2000 after spending 20+ years as an elementary classroom teacher in Texas, Illinois, and Washington. Currently, she is a Professor in the Department of Teacher Education and Administration in the College of Education. During her time at UNT she has taught literacy courses to undergraduate and graduate students. Since 2003 Carol has been the Director of the North Star of Texas Writing Project, an affiliate of the National Writing Project. This is a vibrant network of teachers across the metroplex that provides professional development for teachers and administrators, as well as effective teaching in area classrooms. One of Carol’s guilty pleasures is to learn about the lives and successes of her former students. For example, she recently learned that one of her former first grade students (1979) taught middle school with one of her former UNT preservice teachers (2003). One of her former second grade students (1982) was a speech writer for Hillary Clinton. Several of her former students are published authors and one is an Associate Dean at a local university. Knowing that her teaching has influenced other’s lives brings her great satisfaction.\n\nJ.H.
