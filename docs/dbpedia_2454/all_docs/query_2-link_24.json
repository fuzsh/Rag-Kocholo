She was on a schedule and seemingly just delivered the info and moved on.. No time to question or discuss or understand this approach.i don't think I will return.\n\nStar\n\n1 out of 5 stars1 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 3/15/2024\n\nDr Ayad has no bed side manners. She showed to be bothered, upset, distant and lacked compassion. She only focused on herself, talked at me. She didn't take time to listen, did not believe my chronic pain and even stated it could be psychological. I was in tears during the visit and for the rest of the evening. I thought that as a woman and minority she would've been more understanding of how women are treated poorly in the medical system. I will never set foot in her office, I don't feel safe to go back. As an educator I know how important it is for human connection and kindness, and think Dr Ayad lacks both. This visit has been one of my worst visits yet.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 10/25/2023\n\nDr. Ingy Ayad was definitely very caring and patient. She listened to my concerns and offered some solutions and gave interest as to what I was saying. I really appreciated the fact that she would like to build more rapport for future visits. Choosing a new Doctor after so long is a little nerve racking and first impressions mean a lot. I was very happy with this visit.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 8/31/2023\n\nDr Ingy Ayad, to my opinion is the best Dr here in Kern County. I always recommend her when friends or family ask me for a physician Dr reference. She is always on the best look out for your health and care. Dr Ayad is always very knowledgeable and professional"
