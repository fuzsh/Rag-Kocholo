        "text": "In a recent conversation with Paper, I found it truly inspiring to hear about the impactful work Superintendent Kirk Shrum and educators in Visalia Unified School District are doing to foster connections that extend beyond the classroom for students. Their dedication to ensuring each student feels a part of something larger within their community is remarkable. 📚🤝 \"What research shows is that when students are connected to something beyond maybe just their academic class, they perform better, they feel better about themselves, and they have better attendance...if every student's connected to something meaningful, it's going to change their trajectory.\" 🔗 Watch his full interview and explore more insights from leading superintendents at leadership-voices.com.\n\n‼️ Update: Deadline to apply has been extended to January 22.‼️ Our LOCAL students have a chance to be in the National Civics Bee Do you know any 6, 7, or 8th grade students that live in Michigan?

He not only pushed my math abilities to new heights but also gave me the confidence to tutor fellow classmates who struggled with the concepts. 🧮 It was a lesson in leadership and empathy I carry with me to this day. 📚📜 But it wasn't just about academics; I learned about pride in my history and myself. The red, the green, and the black – symbols of heritage and unity that still resonate in my heart. ❤️💚🖤💪🏾 These personal experiences are a testament to the potential within our schools, no matter their ratings. 🎁 🌟 Many of my colleagues come from A-rated or private schools, but let's not overlook the schools like Marcus Garvey Elementary or the incredible kids who attend them. 🙌🏾 🌟📚 Let's talk 📣📣📣 What was your school rated? Is it indicative of the quality of education that you received? What is your opinion of the current rating system? #MarcusGarveyMemories #InvestInOurSchools #EducationMatters\n\nThis year at Oak National Academy, we’ve been releasing a brand new curriculum for secondary history with our expert partners Future Academies. With the curriculum nearly fully resourced, let’s explore the resource I’m MOST proud of…🥁 📌 The British Empire: how far was it transformed in the mid-nineteenth century? These new resources for secondary history teachers have been carefully planned and produced. Here are three reasons why I think they’re unmissable: With a clear focus and attention to detail, they tackle a subject that is sometimes dealt with superficially: the mid-nineteenth century British Empire. They deal with a difficult, yet fundamental issue in Britain’s past. Historians such as David Olusoga have warned school leaders about the danger of teaching a dishonest version of the past. These resources seek to do the opposite. The resources are shaped around an enquiry question investigating the extent of change to the British Empire during the nineteenth century. This provides a clear structure and guidance for pupils’ learning about this fascinating topic. But, don’t just listen to me. Check them out here: https://lnkd.in/etvUYTPk\n\nToday, the final books for my fall semester of 2024 came in the mail. This stack of books encompasses the Western Tradition, covering the ancient, modern, and Christian pillars of the west. My classes this upcoming semester will be conducted Socratic Seminar style, with close readings of these texts, engaging with the important questions that they produce. Yet, this type of education is not found just anywhere, in fact it’s quite rare to find in most colleges and universities today. Thankfully, the The Honors College of Belmont Abbey College provides this form of classical liberal arts education- the one that so many great thinkers, leaders, and teachers have been formed by. If you’re a student or a parent- consider coming to or sending your child to the Honors College at Belmont Abbey. It’s an education like no other that seeks to do what education should do- induce the human person to virtue and happiness."
