        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nPatient‐centred care (PCC) is growing in prominence. Balint first described PCC as “understanding the patient as a unique human being.”1 During the 20th century, PCC became a focus of healthcare systems with its promise to increase patient satisfaction and improve outcomes.2 A growing body of evidence has linked PCC practices with improvements in a variety of health conditions3, increased adherence4, decreased healthcare utilization5, better ratings of care6 and improved quality of care.7 By 2001, The Institute of Medicine identified PCC as a key aspect of high‐quality care.8 PCC is now ubiquitous internationally9 and extends beyond the provision of health care into medical education, law and quality improvement.10, 11 Moreover, PCC has increasingly become part of the research lexicon. A PubMed search (2016) for “PCC” produces over 20 000 results, with over 2000 publications annually.12, 13, 14\n\nWhile the term PCC has become pervasive, consensus is lacking on what constitutes PCC.15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Most providers, policymakers and researchers agree that PCC represents a shift from a traditional, paternalistic, provider‐driven and disease‐focused approach towards one that fully integrates the patient's perceptions, needs and experiences, into every phase of medical consultation, treatment and follow‐up.19 In their oft‐cited literature review, Mead and Bower describe PCC as encompassing five conceptual dimensions: the biopsychosocial perspective; patient‐as‐person; sharing power and responsibility; therapeutic alliance; and doctor‐as‐person.20\n\nPresently, there is limited research on hospital employee perceptions of PCC.21, 22, 23, 24, 25 To date, this research has been limited to studies with nurses or providers outside of the US23, 24 or focused on only a small subset of employee perceptions of patient‐centred care22, 25. As the research community continues to examine PCC15, 17, 18, healthcare systems are actively implementing initiatives.26, 27 Substantial efforts are underway, for example, to transform the US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) to a patient‐centred healthcare system. Several system‐wide policies are in place which emphasize the delivery of “personalized, proactive, and patient‐driven” care.28 To facilitate advancement of these PCC initiatives, VHA established the Office of PCC and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT), in 2010, to help facilities transform.29\n\nWhile researchers and policymakers may be invested in PCC, it is up to hospital employees to enact it in practice. Their conceptualizations of what constitutes PCC shape how initiatives are developed, implemented and enacted. Therefore, we sought to understand how hospital employees conceptualize PCC.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nTransforming care to being more patient‐centred is a complex task for healthcare organizations. We found that while the term “patient‐centered care” is expanding in use within the VHA, oftentimes the conceptualizations of employees are not fully congruent with the PCC constructs described in the literature. The VHA's explicit push for PCC by VHA's Office of Patient‐Centered Care and Cultural Transformation offers an ideal setting in which to examine employee conceptualizations of PCC.29 In the four medical centres in our study, many employees discussed PCC in terms that were consistent with Mead and Bower's core concepts (biopsychosocial perspective; patient‐as‐person; sharing power and responsibility; therapeutic alliance; and doctor‐as‐person). Employees also extended PCC beyond the patient‐provider dyad, yet, these were still consistent with the broader PCC literature.8, 17, 27, 34 This tells us that key PCC constructs are understood by those implementing PCC. The leadership, managers and front line staff we spoke with are trying to create a healthcare organization that subscribes to the ideals of PCC.\n\nWe found many employees' PCC conceptualizations extended beyond the traditional patient‐provider dyad, into the organization (See Figure ). As Scholl's recent review of patient‐centredness found, policy‐level conceptualizations are lacking in the literature.17 However, the policymakers and front line providers we spoke with were clearly thinking about systems‐level implications of PCC. Our participants broadened the traditional definition by describing PCC as a cultural shift, imbued into care practices and organizational initiatives. Implementing discrete PCC programmes may not be effective at culture change, without a system‐level, multipronged approach26.\n\nParticipants discussed how physical surroundings can make patients feel comfortable, which while not reflective of current PCC literature, is highly aligned with organizational trends.35, 36 Yet PCC transformation does not end with physical changes. Our participants explained that PCC could not be achieved with an attractive facility alone—a therapeutic alliance or power sharing must be present. If PCC is conceptualized solely as the patient's experience when he/she enters a healthcare facility, an organization may lose focus on other key PCC components.19\n\nAdditionally, some participants talked about PCC in terms that were vague, broad or encompassed essentially everything. Notably, the characterizations of PCC that were unaligned with the PCC literature were primarily from leadership. Leaderships' broad conceptualizations may reflect their broad view of the organization and the need to have an overarching vision that encompasses all aspects of the facility. Yet this view may serve to water down implementation of core components of PCC. These amorphous conceptualizations index an intent to be patient‐centred, but without clearer definition do not provide adequate, actionable scaffolding upon which to implement cultural transformation. A broader understanding of PCC constructs can contribute to cultural transformation, but it may also limit the ability of leadership and policymakers to ensure PCC‐related goals are being achieved. Attempts to expand PCC constructs beyond the clinical encounter and into the organization are important for true transformation; however, when the conceptualizations seek to encompass everything currently subsumed under patient care, what happens in practice may not resemble what leadership and policy‐makers seek to achieve.\n\nSome participants stated that PCC was what they had always done or was inherent to particular disciplines. These findings are consistent with others who found PCC politicized along disciplinary lines or perceived hierarchies in patient‐centredness.37, 38 Similarly, Gillespie et al21 found a tendency to re‐brand activities as patient‐centred, thereby negating the need to transform care. Where the problem lies is when some professionals misconceive PCC as something they have always done. In this instance, there are potential missed opportunities to understand how PCC may not in fact be what one has always done in their practice, or limited to specific roles. This viewpoint may limit these disciplines from re‐examining current practices or adopting new initiatives. When PCC is equated with a disciplinary approach, there is a risk of not making the cultural shift towards key aspects of PCC, such as sharing power, if there is the belief that the discipline is already patient‐centred. Engaging a range of employees is critical because hospitals are, by necessity, staffed with doctors, nurses, psychologists, pharmacists, managers, housekeeping and food service employees—all of whom interact with patients to some extent. Therefore, it is critical to have an organizational strategy, encouraging all employees to reflect on their own practice in relationship to the key components of PCC, as outlined by Mead and Bower, may facilitate greater insight and opportunity for growth39. PCC training could build on disciplinary principles aligned with PCC constructs, while providing clear examples of how PCC goes beyond current practice. Even brief trainings have been shown to be effective in enhancing PCC practice.40\n\nWe also found PCC being likened to good customer service. Linking PCC to customer service conflates the key differences between PCC and customer service oriented care.34 Epstein18, 19 cautions that PCC is more than just “giving patients what they want, when they want it.” And as Millenson notes, “what distinguishes patient‐centered care in its fullest sense from beneficence or better customer service is that it involves actions undertaken in collaboration with patients, not just on their behalf. It requires clinicians to appropriately share power even when that sharing feels uncomfortable.”34 Good customer service is important, but insufficient to truly providing PCC.\n\nThis study has limitations. Because the four VHA facilities identified key informants, we primarily spoke with employees directly involved in PCC, thus their conceptualizations of PCC might not be representative of employees less involved in PCC implementation. Additionally, the facilities in our study represent a subset of medical centres highly engaged in PCC; outside these centres, there is likely greater variation in how PCC is conceptualized. Further investigation is needed with other employees more removed from organizational change initiatives, yet still have frequent patient‐interactions, such as housekeeping or clerks. Finally, our data only represents how these employees perceive PCC. Observations of interactions between patients and healthcare employees are needed to determine what PCC looks like in practice. Future work should also address how patients understand patient‐centredness,41, 42 critical for shifting provider behaviours towards what patients want.\n\nNonetheless, our qualitative approach allows for an in‐depth examination of employee conceptualization of PCC in a large, integrated healthcare system. Our findings have important implications for other organizations trying to implement PCC transformation; broadening the definition of PCC beyond the clinical encounter to incorporate organizational elements is critical to culture change initiatives and implementation processes. We provide a caution, however, that when PCC is too broad, efforts may be watered down and true transformation hindered. Employees working in healthcare systems dedicated to PCC must have an appreciation of the model in order to align their efforts. Moreover, many organizations are trying to measure the impact of their PCC initiatives;5, 26, 43, 44 yet without clear definitions of PCC, they may not be measuring what they intend. Therefore, continuing to refine and expand upon models of PCC, such as Mead and Bowers', is essential to informing measurement.\n\nIn this paper, we focused on examining the perceptions of what constitutes PCC at the facility level because these conceptualizations shape how PCC initiatives are developed, implemented and enacted in a healthcare organization. Differing conceptualizations and scattered efforts will not serve to systematically advance PCC. In order to embed patient‐centredness in an organization's culture one needs to make it a systems property, which requires a clear understanding of the full range of factors that promote or impede PCC.45 As organizations move ahead with PCC implementation, they will need to consider if they are going to simply task specific disciplines with PCC practices or instead offer a more comprehensive, transformational organizational plan to infuse PCC throughout the facility. As Gillespie et al21 also note, there is a tendency to take the easy path and simply reframe existing work structures. Organizations that have succeeded in advancing PCC have adopted a comprehensive, organization‐wide approach linked to organizational strategy.46, 47 Communicating a strategic vision clearly and consistently to every member of the organization, with leadership engagement and support, is essential to developing an organizational approach to PCC.46, 47 Organizational change strategies that move beyond a shared vision, and engage staff and middle managers in developing work processes and interactions that implement that vision, are critical. It is the shared uptake of this vision that is most likely to result in synchronized efforts to transform the organizational culture to one where patients truly drive care."
