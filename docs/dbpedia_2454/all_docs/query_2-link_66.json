        "text": "Hall Ambulance announced today that its commercial for the Hall EMT Academy entitled, Don’t Just Watch the Action, won Gold in the category of Recruitment – Online in the 45th Annual Telly Awards. The Telly Awards honors excellence in video and television across all screens and is judged by leaders from video platforms, television, streaming networks, and production companies. According to the organization, this was a record-breaking year, with over 13,000 entries from across the globe being submitted by top video and content producers. Additional winners this year include Adobe, Calvin Klein, ESPN, NASA, and the LA Clippers (NBA).\n\n“The caliber of work this season truly has reflected the theme of going beyond the frame. Our industry is experimenting with new technologies like never before,” shares Telly Awards Managing Director Amanda Needham. “The Telly Awards is uniquely positioned to meet the industry where it’s actually making work, be that on television or TikTok.”\n\nThose involved in the production were surprised to hear they had won a Telly Award. “We are ecstatic to have had our work judged by industry leaders and to know that we used local talent to create a recruitment spot worthy of receiving an international Telly Award,” said Mark Corum, director of media services for Hall Ambulance. Corum wrote the script and served as producer, working with cinematographer Keaton Punch to bring his creative vision to reality. Amy Hall, a well-known audiobook narrator and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Hall, provided the voiceover. VP of Operations Myron Smith served as the talent and location scout, selecting actual Hall Ambulance employees to appear in the video, including the star, Vladimir Dragosavlevich, a real-life paramedic. The opening scene was filmed at the historic Fox Theater, and Smith worked with longtime vendor Dick Shepherd of H&S Bodyworks and Towing to stage the car crash scene.\n\nThe concept for the commercial follows the lead actor’s transmogrification from casual onlooker to becoming a Hall EMT Academy recruit and then a Hall EMT. The :30 spot opens with him watching an action movie when he is magically transformed into the scene of a car crash. He appears stunned as Paramedic Kevin Newsome dashes past him toward the patient and his EMT partner.\n\nInspired, we see our star in the next scene as a recruit listening to a lecture and then going through hands-on patient care scenarios at the Harvey L. Hall EMS Academy.\n\nIn the final scenes, we see that our star has graduated from the training and is starting his EMS career with Hall Ambulance as an emergency medical technician working alongside his partner, Paramedic Rod Castillo.\n\nSince last October, the spot has aired in local movie theaters, on ESPN+ during CSUB athletic events, and appeared online as part of the Hall EMT Academy’s marketing campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. The commercial has generated a lot of interest on YouTube, receiving over 431,000 views in seven months.\n\nWinners were chosen by The Telly Awards Judging Council which includes Nathalie Van Sasse Van Ysselt, VP of Design and Creative Services, MSG Sphere Studios; Barry Christie, Global Creative Lead, Meta Creative Shop; Farihah Zaman, Director, member of Brown Girl Doc Mafia; Aiden Darné, VP, Global Studio Lead Shutterstock; Malinda Wink, Executive Director Minderoo Pictures.\n\nThe commercial can be viewed at https://www.tellyawards.com/winners/2024/online/-recruitment\n\nThe full list of the 45th Annual Telly Awards winners can be found at https://www.tellyawards.com/winners\n\nNashville — The American Ambulance Association (AAA) has named Lavonne C. Hall, chairman of the board and chief administrative officer of Hall Ambulance, as a recipient of the Vanguard Award. The distinction honors women with at least 35 years of service who have blazed the trail for fellow female emergency medical services (EMS) professionals.\n\nThe presentation occurred last evening in Nashville at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center during the President’s Reception at the American Ambulance Association’s Annual Conference. “The Vanguard Awards pay tribute to the exceptional women who’ve torn down walls and laid the groundwork for those who follow,” AAA President Randy Strozyk remarked. “We’re honored to recognize and celebrate their contributions.”\n\nHall is one of 16 women from across the U.S. and the only one from California to be bestowed with the award this year. To be considered for nomination, the individual must have contributed to their organization, state ambulance association, AAA, other professional associations, and/or the EMS profession in an extraordinary way beyond faithful completion of job duties.\n\n“I am delighted and thankful to be receiving a Vanguard award,” a jubilant Hall remarked. “To be honored alongside women who have done incredible and inspiring work in EMS is humbling and a bit overwhelming. I have been lucky enough to have a career I love in an industry that still inspires me after 40 years. To be recognized for that career is icing on the cake.”\n\nIn reflection, Hall explains how she feels fortunate to have started her EMS career at a company that welcomed and valued the contributions of female employees. “I remember my first day at Hall Ambulance Service as a new EMT; I was assigned to ride along on a double paramedic ambulance; both paramedics were women,” said Hall. “I was so inspired by their professionalism and confidence. They made sure I felt welcome and needed as a woman in an industry that most positions had been held by men.”\n\nEver since, Hall has drawn from that feeling of inclusion. “Looking back, I realize what a luxury it was not to have to force myself into a space but to be welcomed into it. I have carried that feeling with me and tried to make everyone, but especially women, feel that a space was already carved out for them, and they were welcome in it,” Hall explained.\n\nHer first exposure to emergency medical services occurred at the age of five when the car she was riding in was struck by a train. After a hectic ride to the hospital in the back of an ambulance, she knew that was what she wanted to do when she grew up.\n\nShe got her EMT Certificate from Reedley College in 1983, moved to Bakersfield, California, and started what will be celebrated as a 40-year career this August (and counting) with Hall Ambulance.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, she, and Hall Ambulance Founder (and Bakersfield’s 25th and longest-serving mayor) Harvey L. Hall discovered they had a shared love of car racing, which would soon turn into romance. They became engaged in 1987 and married in July 1989.\n\nHall worked as an EMT until 1991 when she progressed in her career by becoming a paramedic. For the next eight years, she staffed an Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulance in a bustling 9-1-1 system, priding herself on delivering compassionate patient care.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2011, she was responsible for paramedic administrative support for the Company, which included providing daily support to the EMTs and paramedics, creating the daily shift schedule, assisting dispatch, and responding to mass casualty incidents.\n\nHer next challenge was taking over as Hall Commercial Vehicle Service’s (HCVS) shop owner in 2011. In this capacity, Hall oversaw the daily operations of HCVS, including the procurement of materials, supplies, and other essentials needed to maintain the Hall Ambulance fleet and external fleet accounts. She hired and trained managers, supervisors, and support staff and ensured that the preventative maintenance and repairs were completed at the desired level of expectation.\n\nIn 2018, her world turned upside down when suddenly, her husband was diagnosed with the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). As Mr. Hall’s illness progressed, he expressed a desire for her to serve as president and CEO of Hall Ambulance. Just two weeks and seven hours following diagnosis, he lost his battle with CJD on May 19 of that year.\n\nMrs. Hall suddenly found herself trying to come to grips with her husband’s sudden death, be there for her daughter and granddaughter, and take on the enormous task of leading a company with over 450 employees. Despite being enormous shoes to fill, she rose to the occasion, providing exemplary leadership and ensuring continuity in operations based on her husband’s ideals of care, compassion, and community. Working with the CFO, COO, and a dedicated leadership team, Hall led the Company through the opening of the Harvey L. Hall EMS Academy, Hall Ambulance’s 50th Anniversary, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the acquisition of another service area, increasing Hall Ambulance’s coverage area to 94% of the population in Kern County, California.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Hall announced that while remaining the sole owner of Hall Ambulance, she would reduce her daily involvement with the Company. As chairman of the board and chief administrative officer, Hall remains engaged in matters of significance and importance.\n\nFollowing her husband’s passing, she vowed to become an advocate to raise awareness and funds to support medical research on Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. She joined the board of the CJD Foundation, created the Harvey L. Hall Memorial Grant, and co-started Strides for CJD—Bakersfield, which has raised over $451,000 to support medical research and programs for the foundation over the past six years.\n\n2024 Vanguard Award Winners\n\nLisa Camp | EMS Chief, Friendswood EMS | Friendswood, TX\n\nJennie Collins | EMS Director, Dare County EMS | Manteo, North Carolina\n\nMichelle Golba-Norek | MICN, Director of EMS Education, HMH JFK EMS | New Jersey\n\nJacqueline Greenidge-Payne | Director, U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Health State Office of EMS | St. Croix, US Virgin Islands\n\nLavonne C.

Hall, Hall Ambulance Service, Inc. is the 9-1-1 paramedic provider for 94% of Kern County, California’s population, including Bakersfield, Arvin, Lamont, Frazier Park, Tehachapi, California City, Mojave, Rosamond, Boron, Taft, Shafter, Wasco, Delano, and surrounding communities.\n\nNow in its sixth year, Strides for CJD – Bakersfield has been selected as the CJD Foundation’s regional event for central and southern California families,\n\nfriends, and community members who would like to walk in honor or memory of a loved one affected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).\n\nCJD is a rare neurodegenerative disease that has no treatment or cure. Proceeds benefit the CJD Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, to provide family support, medical education, and research programs.\n\nThis year’s event will take place on Sunday, October 15, on the campus of California State University Bakersfield at the Harvey L. Hall Family Plaza, 9001 Stockdale Highway. Hall served four terms as the city of Bakersfield’s 25th mayor and was a respected pioneer of emergency medical services. He lost his battle with the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in May 2018, just two weeks and seven hours following diagnosis.\n\nOnsite registration opens at 9 a.m., and the leisure walk through the CSUB campus begins at 10 a.m. Additional activities are being planned and will be announced on the event’s Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Strides4CJDBakersfield.\n\nParticipants can register online by clicking on the Bakersfield event at www.strides4cjd.com, and walk as individuals or create or join a team named in tribute to a loved one affected by CJD. The early bird rate for an adult walker is $30 and $20 for youths through September 14. Those who register by August 23 will receive a free event t-shirt.\n\nStrides for CJD – B\n\nakersfield is seeking corporate sponsorships for its 2023 event, ranging from $250 to $20,000 for premier-level support. Hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and corporations should contact Mark Corum, co-captain at bakersfieldstrides@outlook.com, before July 30 to discuss and enjoy full sponsorship benefits.\n\nWhile CJD affects one in a million, you are not alone! Coming together with others who are going or have gone through the progression of the disease with a friend or family member can bring a sense of comfort, togetherness, and healing.\n\nStrides for CJD – Bakersfield is one of 22 events held in cities across the United States during the first two weekends of October. Funds raised through Strides for CJD have positively impacted the CJD Foundation’s ability to provide and support the following programs.\n\nHelpline and Support Groups: Helping families navigate their first days or weeks of diagnosis and caregiving.\n\nMedical Education: Connecting with medical education departments of hospitals around the US to offer medical lectures from CJD experts about diagnosis, caregiving, and other vital information.\n\nAdvocacy: One of the best ways to help advance prion disease research is to ensure that legislators are educated about prion disease/CJD, its impact on patient families, and what’s needed to study the disease and move towards a cure. The CJD Foundation has been working harder than ever to amplify the voices of patients and caregivers in Washington, DC, and to advocate for increased funding for CJD surveillance and\n\nresearch.\n\nResearch Grants: To date, the CJD Foundation has awarded 77 grants, totaling more than $4 million, to help support scientists who study prion disease. This year, for the first time, the CJD Foundation awarded a fellowship to an emerging scientist, in addition to awarding seven research grants.\n\nABOUT CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE\n\nAccording to the California Department of Public Health, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rare disease of the brain and nervous system in humans that is part of a group called prion diseases. In these diseases, prions (proteins that are naturally found in the body) change shape, build up in the brain, and destroy brain and nerve tissue, causing nervous system disorders. These disorders include rapid onset dementia, personality changes, memory problems, impaired vision, difficulty walking, moving, and speaking, all of which worsen over time and ultimately lead to death. There are different types of CJD based on how the disease is caused.\n\nCalifornia had 221 new CJD cases from 2013 to 2019, with 25 to 36 cases reported yearly. Of these cases, 172 (78%) were reported to have died with CJD.\n\nAbout 1 out of every 3 cases were reported in Los Angeles County (40 cases) and San Diego County (37 cases).\n\nA confirmed diagnosis can only be completed by examining brain tissue during an autopsy. There is no cure for CJD, and treatment is provided only to assist with ma\n\nnaging symptoms and to make the CJD patient more comfortable.\n\nABOUT THE CJD FOUNDATION\n\nThe CJD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that supports families affected by prion disease. Programs include research grants, a seven-day HelpLine, family support groups, medical education, and an annual conference for families and scientists. For more information, call 800-659-1991, visit www.CJDFoundation.org, or email help@cjdfoundation.org\n\nFriday, February 10, marks the 52nd Anniversary of Hall Ambulance Service, Inc., celebrated by the Company as Founder’s Day.\n\nThe prologue leading to the Hall Ambulance story began in 1960 when Harvey L. Hall was working as an orderly at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield. He ran into a friend working as an ambulance attendant who dared Hall to go on a ride along with him, citing they would have a good time running around with the red lights, sirens, and all that stuff.\n\nIn a 1991 article in The Bakersfield Californian, Mr. Hall reflected on that moment that would pave the way for a 58-year career in pre-hospital care. “I took him up on his dare,” Hall recalled. “To my surprise, the next morning, his boss called and asked me if I enjoyed the ride. I confessed that I had. He offered me a job. That’s what I have been doing ever since. That was September 1960.”\n\nWith 11 years of experience under his belt, Mr. Hall had developed a vision for the type of ambulance company he desired to build based on his ideals of care, compassion, and community. “I really felt there were things that could be done differently in this business. I wanted to create a company that could be more service-oriented, a company that would become an important part of the community,” he said.\n\nOn February 10, 1971, with a $15,000 bank loan, two ambulances, and a lot of enthusiasm, Hall Ambulance Service began answering the call from his residence, located at 1307 S. H Street serving as headquarters.\n\nUnder his tenure, referred to as the Founder’s Era (1971-2018), Mr. Hall grew his business based on building relationships with the local hospitals, public safety agencies, communities, and customers served (Mr. Hall didn’t call them patients). He was an innovator, always at the forefront of defining standards in patient care, including the implementation of paramedics in February 1975.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Hall became ill, and just two weeks and seven hours after being diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, his battle came to an end on May 19. His impact as a pioneer in pre-hospital care carries on. In 2020, the National EMS Museum and the California Ambulance Association named Harvey L. Hall as one of 17 native Californians responsible for shaping EMS in the United States.\n\nIn celebration of Founder’s Day, a handout was created providing an abbreviated biography of Harvey L. Hall and the Ambulance Company he Built. The document can be downloaded here. Founders Day Abbreviated Biography Final\n\nHall Ambulance has opened recruitment for Class 44 of the Hall EMT Academy, starting on May 16, 2023.
