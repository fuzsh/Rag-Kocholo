        "text": "Our campaign focuses on the priorities that are centrally important to CSUB - our students!\n\nThe priorities align with CSUB's strategic plan and vision. Our commitment is clear: we are investing in programs that develop our students into leaders who will shape the future - bold thinkers and problem solvers who are able to adapt to rapid change and address the complex issues facing our community and our world.\n\nStudent access and support\n\nCSUB serves a diverse region, and we recognize there is talent in every household, across all income levels. CSUB offers access and opportunity for students who otherwise would not be able to further their education. Many of CSUB's students are the first members of their families to attend college, changing the trajectory of their families' futures forever.\n\nBut we need your support to grow and continue providing educational opportunities to students in our region and help them succeed while in college.\n\nYour support of the campaign will:\n\nGrow the CSUB Fund, which allows university leadership the flexibility to quickly address unforeseen and immediate needs\n\nEnsure CSUB meets students' basic needs during unexpected catastrophic events, like homelessness or food insecurity\n\nInvest additional resources into services for underrepresented students, continuing to close the achievement gap\n\nStrengthen programs and activities that provide students with the support and resources they need to successfully navigate their path to graduation\n\nEngage students through wrap-around support services, meeting each student's unique needs\n\nScholar-Athlete Success, On and Off the Field\n\nBoth on the field and in the classroom, CSUB scholar-athletes are champions. These Roadrunners represent the university in our community and on the national stage. They tackle the rigors of practice, travel, competition and NCAA academic requirements while in school.\n\nWe are proud to have over 300 scholar-athletes representing 16 NCAA Division I sports. They have been recognized both athletically and academically. `Runner scholar-athletes have won seven conference championships, donated over 3,000 community service hours in one year, and achieved a GPA of 3.0 or higher in 10 consecutive semesters.\n\nYour support of the campaign will:\n\nIncrease scholarships for scholar-athletes through the Roadrunner Scholarship Fund\n\nGrow the Athletics Excellence Fund, which allocates resources for unfunded team projects and operations\n\nCSUB is committed to ensuring every student - regardless of socioeconomic background - receives a world-class education. The second priority for the campaign is academic excellence, which ensures that CSUB students receive the highest quality instruction across several majors and disciplines.\n\nStudent and faculty research\n\nCSUB's vibrant, multi-disciplinary research program is a magnet for brilliant students and faculty who collaborate with local industry partners to find innovative solutions for our region, nation and world. These partnerships create a supportive campus culture and can often be tied to higher graduation rates.\n\nWith support from donors like you, student researchers and faculty work to advance engineering, cancer research, education, energy, agriculture and earth science discoveries.\n\nYour support of the campaign will:\n\nExpand research opportunities for students by providing seed funding for innovative and collaborative research projects\n\nInvest in research technology and computing resources to ensure students are able work on cutting-edge projects that positively impact the community now and in the future\n\nSupport faculty as they sponsor and mentor student-led research projects, including rewarding researcher-student partnerships through a campus-wide recognition program\n\nEnsure underrepresented students have equitable hands-on educational opportunities\n\nAdvance faculty and staff success\n\nNearly 650 CSUB faculty members provide exceptional education and instruction in the classroom, through research and through the publication of important literature. They are recognized as expert sources of information in the media and community.\n\nBut even faculty and staff as exceptional as ours need ongoing professional development.\n\nYour support of the campaign will:\n\nIncrease student-centered tools and trainings for faculty and staff members, ensuring they are providing a world-class education to students\n\nFocus efforts on recruiting and retaining the best, brightest and most diverse faculty in the world\n\nIncrease endowed professorships, which are permanently-named positions dedicated for faculty with specific expertise\n\nSTEM initiatives\n\nSupporters like you ensure that CSUB continues to be an engine of social mobility for all graduates to become innovative scientists, engineers, teachers and researchers that directly transform our region and beyond.\n\nCSUB has a vision to close the achievement gap of all learners and focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Research shows that there is a shortage of STEM graduates in the nation. CSUB's culture of access and providing opportunity for underrepresented populations has led to over 2,100 diverse students majoring in STEM fields, making these academic programs among the most popular on campus.\n\nYour support of the campaign will:\n\nEnsure students benefit from mentorship and support programs linked to STEM careers\n\nIncrease high-tech experiences and undergraduate research opportunities for students studying STEM fields\n\nInvest in a world-class master's in nursing program filling a critical need in our community's workforce\n\nCreate a science building with state-of-the-art classroom space and laboratories that will enhance the student experience\n\nProvide funding for CSUB summer camps to focus on STEM education for interested high school students representing diverse life experiences\n\nIncrease funding for the Fab Lab, a community center with tools and technology that serves as both a learning and demonstration laboratory and is the first of its kind in the California State University system\n\nEnhance innovative centers where faculty and students engage with the community to solve regional problems with applied, high-impact research"
