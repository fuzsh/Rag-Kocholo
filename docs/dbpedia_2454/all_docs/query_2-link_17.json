The list is bound to include the Kor Memorial Scholarship (popular with those who speak Klingon), the Stuck at Prom Scholarship (Duck Tape) and, of course, the infamous duck calling scholarship (otherwise known as the Chick and Sophie Major Memorial Duck Calling Contest). In fact, these so-called wacky scholarships have become so well-known that they no longer qualify as ‘weird’ in my book. So, we scoured the Web looking for something truly new and unique; we wanted to find programs that require an unusual hobby, career or characteristic to add to our annual list. Here are the programs made our Truly Weird Scholarships List.\n\n1. Zombie Apocalypse Scholarship\n\nThere’s been so much media attention surrounding Zombies that not even a statement from the CDC has been able to assuage the masses. So, in that spirit, let’s assume zombies do exist and have overrun your high school or college campus. That’s the premise behind this wacky scholarship. Applicants must devise a plan on where to hide and which five items they would use to survive. The last man (or woman) standing will win a $2,000 scholarship for college. Deadline: October 31\n\n2. Eileen J. Garrett Scholarship\n\nThose who are eligible for this award already know what I’m about to write, but for everyone else, here are the basics of the award: college students who are currently studying any field in parapsychology (telepathy, reincarnation, near-death experiences, etc.) may be eligible to win this $3,000 scholarship. Now, if I could just get the theme song from Ghostbusters out of my head! Deadline: July 15\n\n3. Beans for Brains Scholarship\n\nDoes your grandmother knit or crochet? Better start spending some time with her because it could make you $3,200 richer! In fact, the Jimmy Beans Wool Store offers six scholarships that are available to U.S. or international college students who enjoy knitting as a hobby. Deadline: April 15\n\n4. ITSA Graduate Student Scholarship\n\nBet you can’t guess who this scholarship is for. Give up? It’s for thermal spray processing. What’s thermal spray processing? You got me, but if you’re pursuing a degree in it, you may be able to receive one of three $2,000 scholarships offered by the International Thermal Spray Association. Deadline: July 15\n\n5. Wholesale Halloween Costumes Scholarship\n\nEach month, the folks at Wholesale Halloween Costumes offers a fun and unusual contest for students seeking money for college. You could be asked to capture the Easter Bunny on film or write about the monster living under your bed! The winning entry will receive $500.Deadline: Varies\n\n6. National DHIA Scholarship Program\n\nIf you have a passion for cows, this may be the scholarship for you! Eligible applicants must be employees (or family members of employees) of a herd on a DHI (Dairy Herd Improvement) test or belong to a DHI affiliate. Applicants must also be high school seniors or college undergrads at the time of application. More than twenty $750 scholarships are awarded each year. Deadline: October 15\n\n7. Fifth Month Scholarship\n\nWe’ve seen some strange scholarships in our time, but this one takes the cake. Students, 13 years or older, must write a letter to the number 5. What? Clearly, this award is for people with a good imagination or a great sense of humor. In any case, it’s worth $1,500, so students should give it a try! Deadline: May 31\n\n8. NACIS Student Web Mapping Competition Award\n\nBelieve it or not, there are students still learning how to make maps! If you have completed a course in cartography (or are currently enrolled in one), plot a course to the North American Cartographic Information Society and apply for one of two $500 scholarships available. Deadline: September TBA\n\n9. Young Scholars Prize in Romani Studies\n\nDo you watch TLC’s My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding? Are you fascinated by the traveler lifestyle? Submit an unpublished essay on the gypsy culture and you could win $500 for college. International and U.S. undergraduate and graduate students may apply. Deadline: October TBA\n\n10. Flavor of the Month Scholarship\n\nMost scholarship programs ask about your grades, test scores and/or your income, but this program simply wants to know what flavor of ice cream best describes your personality. So, take a trip to your local ice cream parlor, sample a few scoops and submit your short essay soon because this $1,500 scholarship opportunity melts away on July 31.\n\nHispanic Scholarships - Minority Scholarships -Scholarships By ...\n\nhttps://www.scholarships.com/...scholarships/scholarships...scholarships/hispanic-scholarships/\n\n‎\n\nBelow are examples of Hispanic scholarships you may be interested in pursuing.\n\nFor additional information about scholarships based on ethnicity or other ...\n\n‎¡Adelante Fund Scholarships - ‎Catharine Lealtad Scholarships - ‎Telacu Scholarship\n\nWelcome to Hispanic Scholarship Fund | HSFhsf.net/\n\nHispanic Scholarship Fund is the number one resource for Hispanic and Latino\n\nscholarship programs.
