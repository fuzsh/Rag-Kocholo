        "text": "HISTORY OF OUR DISTRICT\n\nEstablished in 1875, the original district housed a mere 11 students in makeshift lean-to structures at various locations. Today, the student population numbers over 19,400, and pupils from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade receive instruction in the most modern of facilities.\n\nThe Panama-Buena Vista Union School District takes pride in its motto, \"Excellence in Education.\" The district employs a staff of dedicated, energetic, and highly qualified teachers who respect and enjoy working with students.\n\nBakersfield is ideally located in the southern portion of Central California. To the south is Los Angeles, a two-hour drive over a scenic mountain highway known as \"The Grapevine.\" Three hundred miles to the north is the \"Golden Gate City,\" San Francisco. Morro Bay and the beautiful Pacific coastline are a short two and one-half hour drive to the west. Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks are also within driving distance. The popular Lake Isabella recreational area is less than an hour's drive through the majestic Kern River Canyon. Just about every imaginable outdoor sport or recreational activity is available year round.\n\nThe Panama-Buena Vista Union School District is proud of its well-defined heritage which strongly correlates student assessment with classroom instruction.\n\nThe state adopted district curriculum is implemented by highly qualified teachers who receive professional development designed to enhance knowledge, skills, and attitudes to improve student achievement. Our mission is to provide quality learning opportunities for every student by supporting teachers through mentoring and high quality appropriate professional development. Curriculum specialists, principals, and categorical program specialists facilitate in-depth, structured and consistent support to all our teachers as they provide standards based instruction to educate our changing student population."
