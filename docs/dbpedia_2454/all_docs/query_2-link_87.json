Presenters: Dr Muavia Gallie (PhD) Dr Corvell Cranfield (PhD) EMU-SISOPEN High-Performance in High- Poverty Schools Project 5 KPAs of the School of Excellence Methodology (SEM) NPO-2019/247866/08\n\n2. Teaching with Poverty in Mind 2009 Six types of Poverty On the basis of social, economical and political aspects: 1. Absolute poverty. 2. Relative Poverty. 3. Situational Poverty. 4. Generational Poverty. 5. Rural Poverty. 6. Urban Poverty.\n\n3. 2. Teaching with Poverty in Mind 2009 Professional Development Questions: Chapter 1: Understanding the Nature of Poverty 1. You can use the study guide before or after you have read the book, or as you finish each chapter. The study questions provided are not meant to cover all aspects of the book but, rather, to address specific ideas that might warrant further reflection. 2. Most of the questions contained in this study guide are ones you can think about on your own, but you might consider pairing with a colleague or forming a study group with others who have read (or are reading) Teaching with Poverty in Mind. 3. Consider how Jensen's definition of poverty compares with versions that you see or hear at your own school. 4. Which of the six types of poverty (situational, generational, absolute, relative, urban, and rural) are most prevalent at your school? How might the book's definitions of these types of poverty change the way you think about or approach poverty at your school? 5. How can understanding the four primary risk factors caused by poverty (emotional and social challenges, acute and chronic stressors, cognitive lags, and health and safety issues) change perceptions of low-SES students in your school? 6. How does poverty affect students at your school? Discuss strategies that might help you ameliorate these challenges. Chapter 2: How Poverty Affects Behaviour and Academic Performance 1. In what ways are the emotional lives of low-SES kids different from those of kids who come from middle- or upper-income families? What behavioural manifestations of these differences do you observe in school? How will you and your colleagues need to change your own behaviour to succeed with these students? 2. How do the three strong \"relational\" forces that drive students' school behaviours play out at your school? What proactive strategies can you use to influence these domains? 3. How do acute and chronic stressors affect low-SES students' behaviour and academic performance at your school? What can you do at your school and in your classroom to alleviate the devastating effects of chronic stress in students? 4. We have learned that the correlations between socioeconomic status and cognitive development can be significant. What effects of poverty on cognitive development have you observed in your own school? Think of some ways you and your colleagues can build low- SES students' core skills, assess their greatest areas of need, and provide hope and support. 5. How have health and safety issues influenced low-SES students' academic achievement at your school? Brainstorm some ways your school can provide improved health services and an \"enrichment counter-attack\" to mitigate these effects. Chapter 3: Embracing the Mind-Set of Change 1. What do we mean when we say the brain has the capacity to change? Looking at the big picture, what are the implications of neural plasticity and gene expression for educators and students? 2. Identify several strategies you can use to increase fluid intelligence in your students. 3. Think of some specific strategies and activities you can use to strengthen the processes in your students' academic operating systems. 4. Does the \"enrichment mind-set\" prevail at your school? Is every staff member united in the belief that every kid can succeed? If not, what are some steps you can take to change your school's collective mind-set?\n\n4. Teaching with Poverty in Mind 2009 Chapter 4: Schoolwide Success Factors 1. Do you personally buy into the five factors in the SHARE model? 2. What, exactly, does \"support of the whole child\" mean? How well is your school meeting all students' needs? Which services and accommodations could your school add to help low-SES kids succeed? 3. With colleagues, assess which data your school most needs and discuss ways to gather them. 4. What role does accountability play in the SHARE model? To strengthen accountability, what changes might your school need to make? Which changes do you see as most essential? 5. What components of an enriched learning environment can your school incorporate into its culture? What obstacles might stand in the way? How can you reduce the impact of those obstacles? 6. Which common \"achievement killers\" has your school avoided, and which ones persist? 7. Which strategies for success have you found to work for you personally? What new ones can you add to your \"toolbox\"? Chapter 5: Classroom-Level Success Factors 1. In what ways do classroom-level success factors differ from schoolwide success factors? Which set do you have more influence over? 2. Do you agree or disagree with W. James Popham's assertion that \"the standard achievement test makers have no interest in selecting test items that will reflect effective instruction,\" and why? How accountable do you think you should be for low-SES students' achievement, and why? 3. What is the purpose of building hope in the classroom? How much or how little hope do you see in the students you work with? Think of some new strategies that you and your colleagues can use to build hope. 4. Why are arts, athletics, and advancement placement curriculum essential for high-poverty schools? What do you think about policies that encourage more \"drill and kill\" in math and reading at the expense of these options? Could your students succeed in an advanced curriculum if they had stronger academic operating systems? If so, how can you facilitate that change? 5. Many high-poverty schools that focus on the arts still have high achievement scores. How much art is offered at your school? How much should be offered, in your opinion? If you think your school needs to offer more art classes, how could that be facilitated? Would anything else need to be cut? 6. The better students' academic operating systems are, the better they'll be able to handle the challenges that school and life throw at them. What do you do—and what can you do—every day to strengthen each part of the operating system? 7. What is the role of engagement in the learning process? Why do you think so many educators struggle with this issue? What percentage of classroom time do your students spend actively participating in such engaging activities as writing, discussing, planning, and drawing? List several strategies that you can use in your own classroom. When will you implement these strategies? Chapter 6: Instructional Light and Magic 1. How can you adapt the steps in Mr. Hawkins's lesson plan to your own classroom? 2. How does Mr. Hawkins's lesson plan match up with the classroom-level SHARE factors described in Chapter 5? What did he do well? What improvements could he make? 3. Contrast Mr. Hawkins's teaching with the teaching in a typical secondary- level class. In your opinion, does his lesson plan contain too much non- academic time? Too much academic content? Or does it achieve a good middle ground? 4. Does your school expect all teachers to be excellent? How would you rate your own teaching? Has your personal assessment of your own teaching changed? 5. What steps do you plan to take to strengthen your own professional work? When will you begin those? To whom will you be accountable?\n\n5. More than 60% of South African children are poor • 7 July 2020 • More than six out of ten children (62,1%) are identified as multidimensionally poor, according to a report on Child Poverty in South Africa released by Statistics South Africa today. The report gives an in- depth analysis of the Living Conditions Survey that was conducted in 2015. Child poverty in South Africa is multi-sectoral, with the majority of children (0-17 years) suffering from multiple deprivations simultaneously. • Black African children (68,3%) show the highest percentage of multidimensional poverty as compared to their peers from other population groups. Multidimensional poverty is highly prevalent amongst double orphans (77,3%) and paternal orphans (75,0%) as opposed to non-orphans and maternal orphans. • The report shows that more than twice as many children living in rural areas (88,4%) face multidimensional poverty compared to children in urban areas (41,3%). The highest multidimensional poverty rates are found amongst children residing in Limpopo (82,8%) and Eastern Cape (78,7%). Gauteng and Western Cape, on the other hand, are best off with respectively 33,6% and 37,1% of children being multidimensionally poor. Those living in non-metropolitan municipalities (73,7%) indicate much higher multidimensional poverty rates than children in metropolitan municipalities (39,6%).\n\n6.

Selection & Admission 06 Sep 2018 Insider tips to get into some of SA’s top schools Elizabeth Mamacos To help you to have the best chance at being accepted at the school of your choice, we have spoken to principals and teachers at some of South Africa’s top schools, to get some ‘insider’ advice. Here’s what they had to share: 1. It's about the parent, not the child • Gavin Keller, principal of Sun Valley Primary School and CEO of Sun Valley Group of Schools, says he believes in taking the first 128 students who apply. “I don't believe in school readiness testing or interview testing,” he says. • Keller does, however, believe in parent testing. “What parents do with their child between conception and Grade R will determine the future of the child,” he told us. “So arrogant, pressurising, over-anxious, obnoxious, demanding, helicopter and snow-plough parents are not welcome at our school. The child remains the client.” 2. Good all-rounders, Old Boys and early applications • The admissions secretary at Bishops Diocesan College in Cape Town told us that the school favours applicants who have good all-round talents to contribute to the school, i.e. well academically, and a solid sporting and cultural CV. All applicants to Grade 8 are required to write an entrance exam early in their Grade 7 year. The exam is grounded in the Grade 6 and Grade 7 South African curriculum, and consists of two subjects: English and Maths. There is an English comprehension and essay paper, and a Maths multiple choice and long question paper. 3. Keen interest in the school and its education principals • Anne-Marié Winkelman, a kindergarten teacher at Michael Oak Waldorf School in Cape Town, shared her advice to parents with us. Waldorf schools do not have a principal, … so as a kindergarten teacher, Winkelman will often be the final decider. • Most Waldorf schools hold an annual fair, which offers prospective parents and students a chance to see the school in action and to mingle with parents and current students. It’s also a great opportunity to engage with teachers and make a good impression. 4. Close involvement and commitment to the school's ethos • Marc Loon, principal of Kairos School of Inquiry in Johannesburg, says that being a parent of the school implies parent involvement. “We are a school of only around 70 children, so close involvement with the teacher and the school is inevitable,” he explained to us. • “As part of our admissions process, we need parents to understand that we are quite a different sort of school, and this implies different expectations with regard to the curriculum, extra-murals, and the family’s experience of being part of the school.” 5. Get your paperwork in order • Debra Le Riche, admissions secretary at Rhenish Girl’s High School in Stellenbosch, told us that acceptances are based on criteria from academic, sport, culture, leadership and community service involvement. • “The earlier they hand in their applications, the better, especially hostel applications,” Le Riche says. Late applications are rarely considered and only with a valid reason.\n\n20. Cape Town - The Department of Basic Education (DBE) says it seems the secret in producing the best matric results in mathematics of highly celebrated provinces like the Western Cape, Gauteng and Free State, was to encourage very few pupils to take the subject. • This as maths participation in Grade 12 nationally has been declining - from 2018 to 2021 the number of pupils taking the subject dropped from 45.6% to 36.8%. • The DBE revealed this during a briefing to the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education about their plans to improve performance and participation in mathematics, science and technology (MST) subjects. • “About 36.8% learners are doing maths and the rest, 63%, are choosing maths literacy which is not going to assist us grow our economy. This is a challenge that we are working on. Provinces with lowest participants are Northern Cape that declined from 28.2 to 21.1% followed by North West 31.3% to 23.%. It is worth noting that the Western Cape is the third province declining from 30.4% to 26.3%, then Gauteng from 37.2% to 31.2% and Free State 39.0% to 36.4%. • “These last three provinces are always celebrated as producing good and the best but their secret is to get as little as possible number of pupils taking maths and encourage many to take maths literacy. As we celebrate them we must understand this. Then we get provinces like the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal where more than half the learners do maths however they are now also copying these three celebrated provinces having less learners to take maths so that their pass can also be good,” the DBE’s David Hlabane said. •CAPE TIMES Department of Basic Education claims provinces discourage pupils from doing maths Basic Education DeputyMinister ReginahMhaule. https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/department-of-basic-education-claims-provinces- discourage-pupils-from-doing-maths-156b9fc6-9f77-4a6c-bd7a-99b7cadab8fa.\n\n22. Equal Education calculates a throughput rate, which considers how many learners who were in Grade 2 in 2009, passed matric in 2019. This year the throughput rate was at 42%, quite a striking difference compared to the 81.3% (pass rate) the Department of Basic Education is presenting, writes Malin Steinsland 08 Jan 2020 OPINION: Why matric throughput rate is a better indicator of success Malin Steinsland\n\n23. Causes of High School Dropouts https://teens.lovetoknow.com/Causes_of_High_School_Dropouts Low-income families - Parents who work long hours or are uneducated themselves may be unavailable to make sure teens go to school or help them with homework. Kids in low-income families may also not have access to resources needed to complete work at home. 1. Academic under-achievement - Teens who aren't performing well academically may be unmotivated to work harder or may develop low self-esteem. 2. English as a second language - Kids who have trouble understanding teachers or whose teachers have trouble communicating with them may feel less confident in their ability to complete school. 3. Disabilities - Teens with physical or learning disabilities may not receive the help they need to give them confidence in their own abilities. 4. Social problems - Kids who are bullied or have trouble making friends may not want to stay in school. 5. Mental health concerns - Depression, anxiety and other mental health issues can make it difficult for kids to cope with a demanding school environment. 6. Drug and alcohol abuse - Teens under the influence aren't able to make sound decisions or function in a typical manner in public.\n\n25.
