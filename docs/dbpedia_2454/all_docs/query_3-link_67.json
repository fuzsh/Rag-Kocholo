        "text": "Shirley Ilean Watson Miller, was just 2 months shy of her 90th Birthday. Passed away December 5th, 2023.\n\nBorn on Friday, February 16th, 1934 in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was always our favorite Valentine.\n\nFather, William Ostler Watson, and Mother Leone Agnes Eatchel.\n\nBrothers, William (Bill) Eatchel, Dale Eatchel, Allen Ray, David Glen, Richard Lynn, and sister Velma Leone, and half sisters Dorothy Watson (Slater) and Hazel Watson.\n\nShirley grew up in South Salt Lake, Utah. She attended Blane school, and Granite High, and West High night school.\n\nShe Married David Stockdale Miller and they had 5 children. 4 girls and one fantastic, wonderful, gregarious boy! Oh wait I may have given away who is writing this. Ok, Ok, Vicky Lynn, Leslie Gean, Ilene Kay, David Watson, and Kristine Leone.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was a high priority in her life. Throughout her life she held and served with joy many church positions. She was an amazing primary teacher and Sunday school teacher throughout her life. She also held many leadership positions. She was Primary President twice and Relief society president twice. All while working at Miller’s Honey Co. and raising 5 children. She was busier then the Queen Bee in a hive.\n\nShe started working at Millers Honey at the age of 14 and worked there part time in the beginning. As she started raising us kids she then transitioned very early on to full time and continued to work there until she was 82 years old, only retiring due to a stroke at 82.\n\nAfter our fathers passing in 1985 when he was just 52, Shirley became president of Miller’s Honey and took over running the business. She had many positions in the honey industry while simultaneously running the company. And raising us! She was elected to the National Honey board and served there for 12 years. She was also on the Western States Honey Packers and Dealers board, and the National Honey Packers and Dealers, also helped run the Utah Beekeepers Association. She was a busy Bee!!! Ilene and David continue to run the company today as they have worked there many years.\n\nShirley traveled to many places as related to her business dealings. Almost all of the states in the US and also Hawaii, Canada and Australia, New Zealand, Rome, Italy, England and Mexico.\n\nShirley has touched and influenced countless hundreds of people in her life, in the church, and in the business world. She had many quotes that she would say. I call them Shirley-isms.\n\nShirley-ism “There are no boys or girls jobs. Just Jobs.”\n\nShirley-ism “Be accountable, responsible. Don’t tell me to “call you to remind you.” Who’s going to call me to remind you?” it’s your responsibility to remember your own things.”\n\nShirley-ism “learn it our way first. Then we can discuss your ideas. It’s likely we’ve tried and already made the mistakes your about to make. There's usually a reason we do things a particular way.”\n\nMiller-ism “There seems to be nothing more permanent then something temporary. Better to do it right the first time just in case.”\n\nShirley-ism When you move something clean under it or behind it. It ain't gonna clean it’s self!” Shirley-ism “Time is Money, never double-handle things.”\n\nShirley-ism from her dad. “If you use something put it back. Everything has a place. Put it in it’s place. Then when you need it you don’t wast time looking for it, you know where its going to be.”\n\nShirley-ism “If something explodes in the microwave, clean it up your mother doesn’t work here. LOL”\n\nAnd one last one shared by Shirley and Grandma Miller when talking to the employees. “If you can work and talk great. If not... just work.”\n\nAll of us that she touched will be forever in her debt for the things she has taught us. She will forever be on our minds and in our hearts.\n\nShirley is survived by her 5 children and in her words “OODLES” of grandchildren and great grand children.\n\nWe Love you mom, we will miss you deeply. Until we see you again. We love you.\n\nOur Special Valentine.\n\nPer Shirley’s request there will not be a funeral. There will be a prayer with immediate family at the mortuary. Then a dedication of the grave at the cemetery on Saturday Dec 9th."
