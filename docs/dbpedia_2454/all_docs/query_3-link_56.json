        "text": "“Hi Barbie!!” I flipped my ponytail over my shoulder and saw a gaggle of high-school-aged girls clad in hot pink smiling at me. I beamed back: “Hi Barbies!” It felt like a warm hug, a glittery pep talk in a club bathroom. The kind of moment we’ve all been missing these past few years. And I’m not alone, hundreds of thousands of people are saying HI BARBIE. So here are 5 things we can learn from the Barbie movie’s marketing. Just kidding, you know that’s not our vibe. But, yes, the marketing that went into the Barbie movie was brilliant. They deserve their flowers. (But give any of us $160 million, a beloved doll with a 70 year history, worldwide brand recognition, and Ryan Gosling— and it might just go okay!) But there’s more here than just a story about brand marketing. Something cool is happening this summer. The Barbie movie has made $780 million so far. 1.7 million tickets have been sold to the Women’s World Cup. The Eras tour is poised to be the highest-grossing tour in history, injecting millions into cities it lands in. It literally shook the earth. Beyonce’s Renaissance tour is revitalizing local economies and single-handedly creating a market for silver fringe. Someone on CNBC called it the she-conomy, and I gagged so hard you’d assume I saw a flat foot. When 52% of the population wants to consume something— that’s just the economy. Girls have always created outsized economic value compared to what they’re credited for— just Google how much money Twilight made. But so often the people making the art to sell to women and girls are also looking down their noses at the very people paying for it. And, let’s be honest, they’re often men. That content felt like a drawing, someone trying to understand and represent an experience they’d never had. But this time feels different. This time it feels like a mirror. The creators are reflecting real experiences back to us that we can look at and say: Yes, that’s how it feels. Women and feminine-presenting folks are hungry for collective experiences that allow us to reclaim girlhood as a celebration, feel connected to each other, and that give us an occasion to unabashedly dress like loofahs. We want things made just for us. Your customers want that, too. The best marketers are mirrors. We listen deeply to what our customers need, and think of them as individuals (and not as simply targets, or numbers, or sales). The best storytellers, artists, and marketers start at the same place— the people. So talk to your people, and reflect their experience back to them in your copy, your content, and your sales process. Then, find your own unique way to say: Hi Barbie!
