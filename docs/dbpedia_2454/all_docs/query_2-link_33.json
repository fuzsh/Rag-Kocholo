        "text": "Mark Duffel\n\nBaseball February 20, 2020\n\nBakersfield Home for Three with San Francisco\n\nFollow @CSUB_Baseball\n\nBakersfield, Calif. - Just two days after dropping a heart breaker to Loyola Marymount, on the road, the Roadrunners return to the friendly confines of Hardt Field to begin a three-game set with the University of San Francisco, Friday. First pitch for game one is scheduled for 6 p.m. The two teams will meet again on Saturday at 6 p.m., with Sunday's finale set for 12 noon. CSU Bakersfield slipped to 2-2 with the loss at LMU, while USF enters the weekend with a 1-3 record in the early going.\n\nThe `Runners have received great production from both their line up, but this weekend they'll look for more consistency in the timeliness of executing at the plate.\n\n\"We're having a lot of success getting guys on base, so we don't want to change too much as far as what we're doing offensively,\" said CSUB Head Coach Jeremy Beard. \"The timely hitting will come, we have too many good hitters so we just need to limit the strikeouts and try not to do too much at the plate.\"\n\nOffensively, Bakersfield is hitting .273 and averaging more than 14 baserunners per game through the first four games of the season. Freshman Jacen Roberson, junior Damian Henderson and senior Tyler Jorgensen are all hitting over .350 for the `Runners.\n\nRoberson opened the year hitting .636 in the series with Washington State, before he was held hitless against LMU on Wednesday. He did manage to reach base while leading off the first for the fourth consecutive game.\n\nHenderson and Jorgensen each posted multi-hit games against the Lions. Henderson was 3-for-5 with a double, while Jorgensen finished 2-for-5 with a two-bagger and a run batted in. Henderson has a base hit in all four games this season. Jorgensen has a hit in three-straight.\n\nOn the mound, the CSUB starters have been electric in the early going. Over the course of 20 innings pitched, Roadrunner starters have turned out a 0.90 earned run average, while limiting opposing hitters to a .143 batting average. Bakersfield starters will enter this weekend's series having not allowed an earned run over 17 consecutive innings pitched.\n\nSCOUTING THE DONS\n\nThe Dons bring a 1-3 record to Bakersfield, following a series sweep at the hands of CSU Northridge and a midweek win over UC Davis. USF swept CSU Bakersfield in San Francisco last season, with two of the wins coming by just one run.\n\nSan Francisco is hitting just .220 as a team through four games, with a pair of home runs and an on-base percentage of .320. The Dons are led by senior outfielder and lead-off hitter Tyler Villaroman who is hitting .471 with a home run, four stolen bases and five runs scored in the early going. Villaroman has yet to strikeout at the top of the USF line up.\n\nOn the mound, the Dons have allowed opposing hitters to put up a .282 average and reach base at a .364 clip. Opponents have dented the USF pitching staff for 10 extra-base hits over four games, resulting in a San Francisco ERA of 4.36.\n\n`RUNNER RECAP\n\nThe `Runners took two-of-three from visiting Washington State to close out the first weekend of play with a winning record for the first time since taking a series against CSUN in 2016.\n\nBakersfield dropped game one, after stranding ten men on base, but rebounded to win the final two games of the series. The `Runners out hit the Cougars in all three games and received excellent starting pitching and defense.\n\nCSUB starters combined to throw 14 innings and allow just five hits and two earned runs, while the defense made only one error and currently leads the WAC with a .992 fielding percentage.\n\nFreshman Jacen Roberson paced the offense with a monster debut against Washington State. Roberson hit .636 for the series and scored four times.\n\nCSUB dropped a midweek contest at LMU, when they allowed seven unearned runs in the eighth and fell 7-1. The loss spoiled an excellent start from Jaykob Acosta, who tossed 6.0 scoreless innings in his first career outing.\n\nHOME IS AT HARDT\n\nWith a series win over Washington State, the CSU Bakersfield baseball team has now won eight straight series played at Hardt Field. The `Runners won all six of their home series in 2019, before taking 2-of-3 from the visiting Cougars last weekend. CSUB has not lost a three or four game set at home since May 2-4 of 2018 when Grand Canyon needed extra innings in game three to take the series.\n\nON THE RIGHT FOOT\n\nThrough one turn in the rotation the CSUB starting pitchers have certainly started 2020 on the right foot. Roman Angelo, Ethan Skuija, Davonte Butler and freshman Jaykob Acosta have combined to throw 20.0 innings, allowing just 2 ER and nine hits, for a 0.90 earned run average and a .143 average against.\n\nButler and Acosta have tossed scoreless outings in each of the past two games for the Roadrunners. Butler allowed just two hits over five, while Acosta scattered four base hits in six innings of work.\n\nSkuija, a senior, surrendered just one unearned run over five innings while Angelo allowed just a pair of earned runs in four innings on opening day.\n\nAll told CSUB starters have now pitched 17.0 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run.\n\nTABLE SETTING\n\nJacen Roberson has reached base to lead off the first inning in all four games so far this season. He recorded hits to open the CSUB half of the first in all three games against Washington State and was hit by the second pitch of the game at LMU.\n\n'FOUR' CONSISTENCY'S SAKE\n\nFour Roadrunners have reached base in all four games this season, led by junior Damian Henderson who is currently riding a four-game hitting streak to open the year. After posting a single hit in each of the first three games, Henderson erupted for three at LMU. He nearly had a fourth, but his hard shot to deep right center was flagged down on the warning track.\n\nJacen Roberson, Tyler Jorgensen and Will Picketts have also reached in every game this season. Jorgensen is riding a three-game hitting streak at the moment, while Roberson had a three-game hit streak of his own snapped against LMU. Though he did reach base via an HBP.\n\nPicketts has hits in three of CSUB's four games this season, earning a walk in the fourth.\n\nDANIEL'S BIG DAY\n\nSenior Daniel Carrizosa bounced back to good health in a big way, when he made his season debut at LMU on Wednesday. Carrizosa finished the game 3-for-3 with a BB to reach base in all four of his plate appearances against the Lions.\n\nHOME COOKING\n\nWith the series win over the Cougars, CSUB moved its home series winning streak to eight. The `Runners won all six of their home series in 2019 and haven't lost a three or four game set in Bakersfield since dropping 2-of-3 to Grand Canyon on May 4-6 of 2018. The Antelopes needed extra-innings in an 8-5 rubber match victory to escape Hardt Field with the series win.\n\nWALK THIS WAY\n\nCSUB walked ten times in Sunday's finale with WSU, he most in a single game since Mar. 8 of 2018, in a game versus Fairleigh Dickinson (10 BB).\n\nUP TO SPEED\n\nFreshmen Jacen Roberson and Kobe Silva eached reached base on three occasions in the team's opening day contest with Washington State. In the process they became the first `Runner freshman to reach three times in their collegiate debuts since Jeremy Rodriguez did so in 2009. Rodriguez hit the trifecta while competing in the very first baseball game in school history - an 8-7 loss to Saint Louis.\n\nHOME FIELD ADVANTAGE\n\nCrowds of more than 600 fans enjoyed all three of CSUB's season opening contests with Washington State. The `Runners drew more than 600 fans on just two occasions in 2019. The Crowd was rewarded for their turnout as Bakersfield took two from the Cougars, including a walk-off win off the bat of senior Eric Charles on Saturday.\n\nJORGENSEN EARNS PRE-SEASON ACCOLADES\n\nSenior infielder Tyler Jorgensen has seen the pre-season accolades rolling in on his behalf. Jorgensen, a Second-Team All-WAC selection last season after hitting .375 in league play was selected by the conference's coaches as a First-Team Pre-Season selection this season.\n\nJorgensen was also honored as a Pre-Season All-Conference Selection by Perfect Game College and DI Baseball.\n\nHOME IS AT HARDT\n\nCSUB will play a grand total of 33 games at Hardt Field this season, including 15 against WAC opponents. The `Runners will play 10 of their first 11 games on campus, hosting series against Washington State, San Francisco and Holy Cross.\n\nLater in the season, Bakersfield will host future Big West opponents UC Riverside (3 Games), Cal Poly (1), UC Santa Barbara (1) and Hawaii (1). CSUB will also host single games with Pepperdine and Loyola-Marymount this season.\n\nPRE-SEASON WAC COACHES POLL\n\nThe Roadrunners were selected to finish sixth in the conferences pre-season poll as voted on by the league's head coaches.\n\nGrand Canyon was the WAC's pre-season favorite, garnering two first place votes and totaling 73 points. Three other teams received at least two votes to win the conference this season, while Sacramento State led the league with four first-place tallies.\n\n2020 Pre-Season Coaches Poll:\n\n1 Grand Canyon (2) 73\n\n2 Sacramento State (4) 71\n\n3 NM State (2) 66\n\n4 UT Rio Grande Valley (2) 55\n\nCalifornia Baptist 55\n\n6 CSU Bakersfield 39\n\n7 Seattle U 35\n\n8 Utah Valley 29\n\n9 Northern Colorado 18\n\n10 Chicago State 9\n\n`RUNNERS RECEIVING VOTES\n\nBakersfield grabbed seven points in the season opening USA Today Coaches Poll.
