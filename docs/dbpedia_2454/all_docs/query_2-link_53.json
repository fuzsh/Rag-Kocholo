We’re in a community where there are still a lot of spaces available and anytime that anyone who lives in Columbus is even thinking about looking for a new home, I immediately tell them my wonderful experience with Rockford Homes and what they have to offer.”\n\nBobby\n\n“We have special needs, in the fact that my mother-in-law lives with us, so we decided to build rather than purchase an existing home that we would have to compromise on. Building with Rockford Homes allowed us to get exactly what we want and within our budget. I would recommend Rockford to anyone that needed a home that fit their family, and because of their quality and willingness to work with you to achieve your dream home.”\n\nTheresa\n\n“I’ve had people say to me, “I’ve always wondered who lived up there on that hill, it’s just so impressive.” It’s a beautiful community. It’s kept up very nicely in both the summer and winter. When I think of Rockford Homes, I think of a place I’m very proud to live.”\n\nRuth\n\n“I refer my clients to Rockford Homes because I know I can trust them. When I refer them to Rockford Homes, I’m not concerned how the follow-up is going to be. I know there is integrity in everything they’re involved in. I don’t have to worry.”\n\nJerry\n\n“The quality was pretty well evident. You walk through, the trimming work was done correctly, the flooring was fantastic… you could just tell structurally, even going down into the basement and looking up at the floor joists and seeing how they were created, everything was well done. It’s a really quality product”\n\nTerry\n\n“The quality at Rockford Homes was really unparalleled to other homes that we went into. Small details in terms of flooring, molding, fixtures, and stonework, we were just really impressed with the quality and level of craftsmanship that went into building our home.”\n\nJenna\n\n“Every day I walk into my house, I look around and say to myself, “Wow, this is my dream house”. And I really mean that. This is where I’m going to retire. I can say this is going to be my final move, and I’m very happy with that knowing that I’m in a Rockford Home.”\n\nChris\n\nBe Proud of\n\nYour Home\n\nRockford knows that home is truly where the heart is – it’s where you’ll spend most of your time.
