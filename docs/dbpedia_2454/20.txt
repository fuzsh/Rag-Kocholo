Here's some tips on things to do now that you've graduated:

Independent Studies: Miss learning from Chilton? Want to be a life-long learner? Take one of my independent studies courses linked above. Better yet--stay in touch with me and we'll work through things together!

Recommended Reading: This link is some of my all-time favorite books. If you're looking for something to read and enjoy that I personally love...this list is for you!

Academic Writing: Students often contact me about writing in college. What I taught you in AP still applies. The most common requests are about demonstrative statements. All PowerPoints related to this subject are found linked above.
