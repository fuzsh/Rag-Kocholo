        "text": "\"I felt uneasy as (playing) a French Canadian\" - Joan Crawford on Rose-Marie\n\n\"Rose-Marie\" 1928\n\nCast: Joan Crawford (as Rose-Marie),James Murray,House Peters,Creighton Hale,Gibson Gowland,George Cooper,Lionel Belmore,William Orlamond,Polly Moran,Harry Gribbon,Gertrude Astor,Ralph Yearsley,Sven Hugo Borg,Lou Costello\n\nRelease date - February 11, 1928\n\nRunning time - 70 minutes (8 reels)\n\nDirector - Lucien Hubbard\n\nWriting Credits - Otto A. Harbach (play) and Lucien Hubbard\n\nProducer - Unknown\n\nCinematographer - John Arnold\n\nCostumes - David Cox\n\nStudio - MGM\n\nMovie Synopsis\n\nSergeant Malone (House Peters) and Etienne Doray (Creighton Hale) are both in love with Rose-Marie (Joan), however she only has eyes for Jim Kenyon (James Murray). When Jim (James Murray) is accused of murder, Rose-Marie (Joan) marries the influential Etienne (Creighton Hale) in order to save her man from the law. The real murderer, Black Bastien (Gibson Gowland) is being hunted by Sergeant Malone (House Peters), however in a chain of events, Malone (House Peters) is killed, Black (Gibson Gowland) is discovered to be the real murderer and Jim (James Murray) is set free.\n\nInteresting Trivia\n\nThis movie was actually destroyed when the remake was made in 1936 staring Jeanette MacDonald. MGM would destroy the original movies if a remake would come out of the same movie. \"Rose-Marie\" of 1928 did get good reviews in Photoplay and other publication at the time. It also made money at the box-office and proved Crawford could hold her own as a leading lady. This role also showed she could be more than just statuesque and patrician. The movie was dramatic and very suspenseful and that was unheard off for a silent musical comedy to evolve into. It's a shame that \"Rose-Marie\" was destroyed and there are probably no copies of this film that survived. The only glimpses we have are movie stills and photographs from this film. Joan's look was pretty comical with her wild frizzy hair, very wild eyes and thin lips. When you compare photos from \"Rose-Marie\" to \"Grand Hotel\", it is hard to believe it's the same woman.\n\nBased on the play Rose-Marie by Otto Harbach, Oscar, II Hammerstein, Rudolf Friml, Herbert Stothart (London, March 20, 1925).\n\nThere were two remakes of this original version, Rose-Marie (1936) and Rose-Marie (1954).\n\nBox Office Receipts - $972,000.\n\nInflation Value in 2007: $11,748,467.37\n\nPhotos\n\nClick on images below to see a larger view.\n\nMovie Posters/Lobby Cards etc...\n\nReviews\n\nJ. G. of the St. Paul Pioneer Press had this to say, \"Joan Crawford, one of the most admired of the new leading women, has the title role. This about the first time that she has been permitted to be anything but statuesque and patrician. She changes her character with a vengeance, flinging herself fiercely into the wildcat passions of the role of the French Canadian girl and also into the purring cuteness it calls for. She is pleasant to look at in both phases.\"\n\nPhotoplay (1928) said, \"Exciting fights and daring escapes. An excellent cast with Joan Crawford a charming Rose-Marie, the daughter of the northern icebound country, who warms the hearts of all the men around her...It's a little complicated but offers suspense.\"\n\nYour Email Address: How many starts would you give this film?
