Sam returns to his office, where a Captain Jacobi staggers in with a suitcase and dies. After finding the statue of the falcon inside, Sam hides it. He returns home to find Gutman, Cairo and Wilmer, a gunman, waiting for him. Because the police have given him twenty-four hours to clear himself, Sam insists that he will deliver the statue as soon as they agree on a fall guy. Reluctantly, Gutman agrees to deliver Wilmer to the police. Sam's secretary, Effie, brings the statue to his apartment, where they discover it is valueless. Wilmer kills Gutman and Cairo, and Sam accuses Ruth of killing Miles. Even though he has fallen in love with her, he turns her over to the police, and at her trial, she is identified by a Chinese eye witness. As his reward, Sam receives a political appointment.\n\nLess"
