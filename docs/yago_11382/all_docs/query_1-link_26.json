After studying percussion and music theory extensively throughout his education in Oak Park, IL, Jonathan spent his freshman year of college in 2002-2003 at Boston’s illustrious Berklee College of Music. He returned to Chicago to study jazz drumset with Paul Wertico at the Chicago College of Performing Arts, whereupon he graduated with a BA in Jazz Studies in 2005. Shortly thereafter, he founded the world-renowned progressive rock band District 97. Jonathan and his bandmates regularly record and tour the world. In 2016, Jonathan was named one of the Top 5 Prog Rock drummers in the Modern Drummer Magazine Reader's Poll.\n\nIn addition to his activities with District 97, Jonathan is one of Chicago’s busiest and most in-demand Modern and Ballet dance accompanists. He works regularly at Hyde Park School of Dance, Joffrey Ballet, Columbia College Chicago, Chicago Academy for the Arts, Intuit, and is thrilled to join HSDC for their Summer Intensives."
