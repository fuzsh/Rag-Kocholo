The film's press book gives the following information about the production: Isobel Field, Robert Louis Stevenson's stepdaughter, visited the set. A South Seas village was recreated on Santa Catalina Island, CA, for which Paramount imported tropical vegetation from Hawaii and tropical fish from Tahiti, and another village was built on the Paramount Ranch in Malibu, CA.

Robert leaves Attwater alone on the island to count his pearls, while he, Faith, and the remaining islanders set sail for home, fully provisioned.\n\nLess"
