        "text": "Description\n\nA rare letter from the first recipient of the Best Picture Academy Award for the classic film Wings\n\nTLS, one page, 7.25 x 10.25, personal letterhead, January 4, 1960. Hubbard writes, in full: “I hope you will find time in your busy day to give due consideration to a test made last week on your lot—of a young man named Chris Seitz, a product of your acting school. First, I think he is good and second he happens to be the grandson of the late George B. Seitz, director, and of myself. Just a fair toss—no more.” Mild corner creasing, some light toning and surface marks, an ink notation, and three binder holes along the left edge, otherwise fine condition. After winning the award for producing the 1927 Clara Bow film Wings, Hubbard went on to become president of Universal Pictures. This letter, regarding a casting call for his grandson, Chris Seitz (who would go on to star in the 80s series Thirty-Something and Fame), presents Hubbard in a most uncommon format. Accompanied by two unsigned photos.
