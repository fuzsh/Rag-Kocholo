        "text": "Cinematographer Brian Rigney Hubbard recently finished work on the musical feature Beau, a film adaptation of the musical of the same name. The feature involved the combined efforts of acting and craft talent from the worlds of Broadway and film.\n\nIt was directed by Josh Rhodes, written by Douglas Lyons, scored by Ethan Pakchar and produced by Hunter Arnold.\n\nRigney Hubbard, whose other credits include Dramaworld, Paint it Black and May in the Summer, spoke to us about the challenges of adapting a musical into a streamable cinematic format, while still letting the actors, musicians and dancers perform live and feel like they are on stage.\n\nLet’s find out more…\n\nWas this your first time shooting a musical? Can you talk about the particular challenges of a film like this?\n\nBeau was a completely new way of working for me. It was a combination of talent from Broadway and film. Instead of breaking scenes into separate setups and reconstituting the performance in the edit, we had to design a way that allowed the Broadway talent to do their thing and flow through the whole performance. We did this while filming with more cinematic angles than the traditional proscenium view from a Broadway theater seat. The solution was a merger of talent from theater and film.\n\nI think every scene should be covered in a way that allows the actors to flow through beats without interruption, but this was a whole other level in that it required the previsualization of thousands of shots. I came on almost a month before the filming and sat in on rehearsals.\n\nHow did working with the theater talent help with the film?\n\nThey knew their beats and choreography and could repeat complicated blocking. I was able to get a clear vision of where the camera had to be and when. So when the floodgates opened at the start of a performance, we were ready to cover several hundred shots, non-stop. It still wasn’t easy. Every run-through had about 400 shots that I had to call out, and cameras had to reposition without interrupting the performance.\n\nBy the third day, we had completed 1,200 shots. The entire feature-length project was completed in six days. Preproduction with the acting talent and the coordination between Adam Honoré (lighting designer), Paul dePoo (production designer), Christina See (gaffer), Mike Yurich (key grip) and me was a model UN of NYC entertainment unions. We came up with a method that was new to both teams…and the best of both.\n\nHow did you work with the director?\n\nDuring rehearsal, I would observe the work between Josh Rhodes and the actors, photographing them in the rehearsal room when they had figured out the blocking. The set was taped out on the floor. In theater, they rehearse on a tight schedule and move on to the next section, so they were great about checking in with me before moving on. This was my time to make suggestions from the camera department’s perspective. This was Josh’s first movie, so he was very open to suggestions on blocking. As Josh is also a choreographer, his adjustments were insightful and lightning-fast.\n\nOnce things were figured out, the scene would be documented with an overhead with all the camera positions and photo storyboards. Soon AD Genevieve Palmieri added to that a spread sheet of all the shots with camera positions relating to each camera position itemized. I would also include shots of frames and compositions for the camera operators to look for.\n\nWhen we filmed, I added a map of the stage gridded out like a chessboard which my dolly grips and cranes operators also had. I warned my key grip, Mike Yurich, and my crane tech, Sebastian Almeida, ahead of time that I was afraid the team would feel like we were playing Battleship, but they loved it. They said it was a fast way to be reminded of the move, and then they’d hear me telling the operator what to look for as they got the camera into the right place. Everyone was setting each other up for success.\n\nAll of this became a huge book that I called “Beau: The User Manual.” It was a massive undertaking, but it allowed us to communicate clearly with every department.\n\nCan you talk about the look, and what cameras and lighting were used?\n\nJosh gave me a lot of freedom in developing the look, but he was extremely clear about what mode we were in for each scene. The idea was that the main character, Ace, was returning to his hometown to play his new album after finding success in NYC. During the performance he is visited by ghosts of the past. So we had several distinct looks: a present-day rock performance, which included a distinct look for each song; Ace’s teen years in the early ‘90s; some further flashbacks to the ‘70s of his grandfather Beau; and a look for solo monologue sequences.\n\nFor each of these, I developed a distinct look. Then working with Adam Honoré and Christina See, we made these looks flow seamlessly during the performances.\n\nThe set built by Paul dePoo took over the entire inside of a warehouse in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and transformed it to a honky-tonk in Nashville. So for present day, we worked hard to feel like you were in a real place and not at a theater performance. Practicals became as important as stage lighting, and the audience was included in the color washes during performances. We worked with three Alexa Mini LFs and Cooke anamorphic lenses in a 2.39 composition. Our set was small, and ARRI’s Lynn Gustafson saved the day by updating us with the latest firmware that allowed us to get just a little bit wider in the sensor.\n\nThe 2.39 anamorphic composition echoes both the stage and the Western feel of this project, while also allowing us to hold multiple characters on the stage. It also allowed for natural lighting artifacts to come into the project. We accepted washes, flares and imperfections because they added to the natural feel of the set as a real place.\n\n“We filmed so much so fast without breaks in the performance, so I didn’t play with different LUTs throughout the project. Instead, I pretended I was on a single film stock and made a base LUT for the project with DIT Dave Satin. While filming, I was constantly on a headset with the operators, crane and dolly grips calling out the next shots and what to look for. Dave sat near me and warned me if levels needed adjustment, so we got a consistent look that protected the image for the looks we were going for.\n\nRemember, they all had “Beau: The User Manual,” so there was a clear vision of our end goal.\n\nHow did you work with the colorist? Was it all remote?\n\nFor this project, I worked with colorist Alex Berman over at Goldcrest in the West Village. This was our first time working together, and Beau is a labyrinth of time periods, flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks. Every new creative collaboration requires a dance in the beginning to understand one another, and Alex jumped right into my insanity, for which I am very grateful.\n\nBefore our session, I prepared looks for all the scenes, which he trusted, and we replicated on the DaVinci Resolve to make sure the looks helped position the viewer in the right time period. We then went back through and started the real color correction, and that’s when Alex could bring his expertise and suggestions. We got a mountain of very creative work done in a minuscule amount of time, but it would have never been possible if I hadn’t prepared and if Alex hadn’t trusted my concept. The director Josh was on a theater project, so he had to watch reels at the end of the day. He hadn’t done a color-correct before, but Josh was great about identifying what jumped out, saying how it felt as it was, and then describing how he needed it to feel. It was a great reminder that good direction is sometimes just about being in touch with your reactions to scenes and knowing where you need them to be."
