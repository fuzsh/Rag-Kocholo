Biography

Hart Massey is Notable.

Hart Almerrin Massey was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist born in Haldimand Township, Upper Canada (Ontario). He built the firm that became Massey-Harris, a farm equipment giant now known as Varity. The Massey Manufacturing Co. had been founded by his father, Daniel Massey. Hart became sole owner in 1855 and moved it from rural Newcastle to the city of Toronto.

He married Eliza Ann Phelps in 1847.[1] They had four sons—Charles Albert (1848–1884), Frederick Victor (1867–1890), Walter Edward Hart Massey (1864–1901) and Chester Daniel (1850–1926), who carried on the family business as well as its multiple cultural and charitable interests. Their only daughter Lillian Frances Treble (1854–1915) was a philanthropist and educator.

Hart Massey died in Toronto in 1896 and was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery.[2]

Massey Hall, 1910

Charitable gifts in his will led to the creation of the Massey Foundation; its first major project was the completion of a student centre for the University of Toronto, which was given the name Hart House. The foundation also contributed to Massey Hall, a cultural landmark in Toronto, and more recently endowed Massey College, also at U of T.
