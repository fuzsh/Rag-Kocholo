        "text": "Tanner Lavering\n\nCo-salutatorian\n\nFlorence-Carlton\n\nSo one day I was sitting in China Buffet, gorging on a variety of Asian dishes from orange chicken to pork fried rice, when I was given an epiphany in the form of a small strangely shaped cookie. In that moment I decided to base my speech to you, my fellow students, off the fortune cookies that sat before me that day. I figured I could give no better advice than advice straight from a cookie.\n\nChase Furlong\n\nCo-salutatorian\n\nLoyola Sacred Heart\n\nThe way I see it, everyone experiences high school in a different way. Some people regard it as the best time of their lives, others not so much ... Good memories aside, I am excited to be moving on.\n\nHollyn Wittmier\n\nCo-valedictorian\n\nValley Christian\n\nNone of us were born yesterday and all of you know that the life that we lead from here on out will test everything that we learned and let characterize us here. Within this next year especially, many will begin to change into the people that they will be for the rest of their lives. We've had protection and spiritual nurturing here but now, ready or not, we embark on a new journey away from the normality of safety that has surrounded our lives.\n\nBreanna Wight\n\nValedictorian\n\nDrummond\n\nAll of our experiences have prepared us for today, but they will now lie behind us. The future is still in that path ahead of us. What is most important is that right now we have it in us to be whatever we want to be. Now is the time that we need to step up and believe in ourselves and in what we can do and who we can be.\n\nBrooke Sauro\n\nValedictorian\n\nLoyola Sacred Heart\n\nOur class had our moments just as all families do. There was some drama, fighting and times when we simply could not tolerate each other. Regardless, I think we all can agree, our last months were ones of growth and healing. We came to realize that although we have our differences, we will always be there for each other. We will always respect and love one another. We are family.\n\nGeoffrey Glidewell\n\nCo-valedictorian\n\nValley Christian\n\nI know one of my classmates hates it when people say we are about to enter the \"real world. \" If we haven't entered the \"real world\" yet, he asks, then where have we been living for the past 18 years? But, what those people mean is that we are ending the time in our lives with these same restrictions. We can still take advice from others, but what our actions will be is determined by ourselves, not others. To put it simply, we have freedom.\n\nShawn Sacchi\n\nCo-valedictorian\n\nThompson Falls\n\nThroughout high school you learn a lot. You remember a little. You try a lot, and you regret some. People will tell you to have no regrets, but I will tell you this: Have no regrets of wasted opportunities. There is no sense regretting events that never took place. We have futures to look forward to. Instead, keep in hindsight the regrets of those opportunities taken because those are the regrets that help shape who you are, and who you will become.\n\nThomas Mitzel\n\nCo-salutatorian\n\nLoyola Sacred Heart\n\nYou always hear kids say how the teachers care about you and how they want you to succeed. But they prove it everyday they walk into the classroom. They come to teach you and make you better, and they expect you to come ready to learn. For that, I cannot thank them enough. These students and teachers created an environment where talk meant nothing, and action meant everything. It has made me grow as a student, friend, brother and son.\n\nJadi Curtis\n\nCo-salutatorian\n\nLoyola Sacred Heart\n\nI want all of my classmates to know that I have faith that each one of you will grow and flourish, and that I can't wait to see what great things you go on to accomplish. Never doubt your own potential for it may be more magnificent that even you understand.\n\nNatasha Wood\n\nCo-valedictorian\n\nThompson Falls\n\nNever let other people influence what you have your mind set upon. Never lower your standards or give up hope. Keep going for what it is that you want to accomplish. And never forget, \"Live the life you have imagined.\"\n\nJulian Thorne\n\nCo-salutatorian\n\nFlorence-Carlton\n\nSo don't worry our education isn't squandered. Sure we may not use algebra, but we've learned how to work through problems and to have logic be our guide. We may never have a need to write the ubiquitous five-paragraph essay but we know how to organize our thoughts and express ourselves intelligently. Perhaps most of all we have learned to communicate and interact with those around us.\n\nKatherine Hawkins\n\nCo-valedictorian\n\nValley Christian\n\nWe have been given talents we didn't deserve, abilities we didn't ask for, and when we have a successful career - a successful life - we shouldn't forget the one who brought us out of the slavery of sin into His wonderful light.
