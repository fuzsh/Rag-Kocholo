When a settlement was reached, at enormous cost to the estate, the brothers were jubilant.\"[1]\n\nUnder Hart Massey's continuing leadership, Massey merged with Harris & Son, Co. Ltd. of Brantford in 1891. On the death of Hart Massey in 1896, Chester's younger brother Walter became president of Massey-Harris, and Chester became treasurer. On Walter's death in 1901, Chester finally became president of the company.\n\nHe also served as president of a related company, Sawyer & Massey Co. Ltd. of Hamilton, and also as director of the Central Canada Loan & Savings Co., the National Trust Co., and the City Dairy Co. of Toronto, and was on the board of regents of Victoria University (Toronto).\n\nSources\n\n↑ Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. XIII\n\nWikipedia:Massey_family\n\nCommemorative Biographical Record of the County of York, J.
