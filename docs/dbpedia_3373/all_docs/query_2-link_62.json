        "text": "William Henry Lewis You and I have been taking our “walks,” as we’ve come to call our dialogues, since 1997. For as long as I’ve known you, you’ve been, in your words, “in a conversation about the humanity of Black people in the face of inhumanity.” And quite the conversation it’s been. Let’s start by talking about your most recent project, Black Mystery Month, which was first exhibited at Colgate University, a place where I used to teach. I want to start with that, because like all your work, it encapsulates so many things you do. We’ve been walking for a long time, I’ve witnessed your work for a long time. I think it’s important we get some other folks walking with us, because there are a lot of people who have not witnessed what you do, and the depth of what you accomplish. So, Black Mystery Month plays with the notion of “Black History Month.” Tell us about the creation story of this work, which uses archival photographs.\n\nBill GaskinsMan, thanks for taking the time to share this private walk in public. There’s a personal context I want to share in talking about this work. I’m the first-born son of William and Eleanor Gaskins of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where I grew up around Black people who all had jobs. And one of my jobs was to be informed. Really. I started reading early in my childhood. We had a set of the World Book Encyclopedia, and I had unlimited access to all those ideas, terms, dates, and hand-drawn illustrations that filled the pages. And I could watch as much televised news as I could as well. But the thing I had to do most was read the newspaper—aloud, in front of my mom, and I had to let her know that I understood what the words meant and what the story was about. My mother could be upset about a lot of things, but nothing upset her more than injustice in the world. And so my social consciousness started in the house, you know?\n\nAnd that was my first job—unpaid. Ironically, my first “paid” job was managing a newspaper route as a teenager. Reading papers meant that I started learning about what happens in the world at what I call the intersection of race and rights.\n\nSo the creation story of Black Mystery Month really begins with my reflections on a group of people among us who are totally blind to the humanity and personhood of Black people and disconnect Black people from thoughts or ideas that matter. Many of these people are the “authors of devastation,” as James Baldwin wrote, being only guilty of innocence—and with the power of public policy, picture making, and “official” knowledge production in their hands. And at this stage in the human story, more and more of these people are neither exclusively white nor exclusively male. For all their critical focus on us, we remain a mystery to them.\n\nWHL You probably know that Thomas Jefferson quote from Notes on the State of Virginia: “But never yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration; never see even an elementary trait, of painting or sculpture.” Jefferson clearly didn’t know the time, even as Benjamin Banneker built the first wooden clock in North America (1752), nor this artist and writer coming.\n\nBG The irony of that quote—and I mean bitter irony—is that Notes on the State of Virginia was published in 1788 in Philadelphia, and Thomas Jefferson Hospital, also in Philadelphia, is the hospital I was born in. Oh, and lest we forget the first volume of that series titled On the Inequality of Human Races that declared “the white race was the first of races in its capacity both to absorb and to create culture.”\n\nAnd consider the fact that right now, some 160 years after Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens formed the Confederate States of America for the right to maintain slavery, there’s more people who believe white supremacy is just some so-called “woke liberal lie,” or an upscale interior paint color, rather than a well-documented part of both the past and present story of the United States of America. Many of these people are college graduates who have been taught by previous generations of other college graduates with more in common with Thomas Jefferson in their thinking about the lives of Black men and women than with Dr. Anna Julia Cooper. This is why Dr. Carter G. Woodson proposed Negro History Week in 1926, and why I am producing Black Mystery Month now.\n\nWHL Tell me about the pivot you made in your work through the form and content of Black Mystery Month. When you first introduced me to the idea of this project I loved it. These are portraits—but a different kind for you. You’re making images that are at once descriptive and abstract. And hairstyling is clearly not the subject.\n\nBG In Black Mystery Month I use blurred photographs of Black people (and whites who thought about Black people as complex persons) from picture press archives and the public domain as the first layer of the images. I combine the archival photographs with custom laser-cut letterforms spelling the name of the person in the photograph. The typography appears backwards and in reverse—somewhat like the view through the ground glass of a large-format film camera. Each photograph is titled Blackboard, with a corresponding number rather than the name of the person. The unexpected form and content is to attract, arrest, and sustain the attention of the viewer on multiple levels.\n\nWHL So you’re clearly riffing on the Soul Train Scramble Board with these! People have to decode the letters that are literally on top of the portraits in the image.\n\nBG You got it, Hank. The Soul Train Scramble Board, both of which, to my surprise, are mysteries at a multicultural scale among the people who have seen the video and the images and with whom I shared the work. But in this case, any viewer challenged by the disorder of the typography can decode the text using either a mirror or the selfie mode of their phone camera with their back to the image on the wall.\n\nWHL And I think that speaks to what your work is always about—it’s more than an image; it’s image with words; it’s words messing with image where the reader or the viewer is meant to read themselves, as well as see what they’re viewing in the image. I’m expecting to see pictures of Black people in Black Mystery Month at Colgate. But one of the most prominent and key launching images for that exhibit is of a white man—Gerald Ford.\n\nBG That white man is prominent because former President Gerald Ford wrote a presidential declaration that officially recognized the importance of Black History Month into American life in 1976.\n\nWHL Wait. Gerald Ford is in the story of Black History Month? Of course, I knew about Woodson and Negro History Week. Again, through your work I’m learning something I didn’t know. But you’re always asking folks to think about what you, Bill, see, and what we see. I’m very moved by what that does.\n\nBG There’s a video component to the project titled Mystery Lessons that explores the tension and contention over Black Mystery Month in the United States. There is also a story that’s part of a public lecture which gives audiences more context for the project.\n\nWHL Your work and mission have always been about, as you say, “straightening things out.” Please tell the story.\n\nBG Now, if I tell you the story, neither you nor the readers of BOMB will come to my talk! But I’ll tell you a related story, not as good as in my talk, but you won’t forget it. I haven’t. I was at The Ohio State University as a graduate student in photography and cinema when a young woman who I’ll call Kellie directly confronted me about what she called “the myth” of pure racism in the world and who thought she had “pure reason” in her critique. (laughter) When I asked her to tell me what she meant, she said, “Racism is an excuse Black people use to explain their situation.” I replied, “If racism doesn’t explain the reality of Black people in the United States, why are there so few tenured African American faculty at The Ohio State University?” She said, “That’s easy to explain, there’s more whites in the population.” I said, “Okay. Then, if the preponderance of whites in the population explains their dominance in higher education, why are the majority of basketball players in the NBA Black?” And she actually paused to think before she answered and said, “Well, they’re better at that.”\n\nThis was a jaw-dropping moment for me. Really. She had gotten this far in one of the biggest universities with these fifteenth-century ideas about race and intellect because either no one challenged them or no one had challenged them successfully. Then I heard a voice in my head posing the question: What are you going to do about this?\n\nThere were also the predominantly white students I taught there who made clear they didn’t think my being Black makes me better at basketball, often telling me I needed to be an artist—but an artist in academia. So that experience at The Ohio State University and the examples of bell hooks and Marlon Riggs account in part for why I’m an artist in academia today. This is also why campuses, college museums, and university galleries will be the initial hosts for Black Mystery Month, so the Kellies of the world, her more teachable classmates, and others can engage with the work, with each other, with me, and with the research informing the work.\n\nThe maiden voyage, the proof-of-concept for this work was affirmed at Colgate University where, thanks to your introduction years ago, the Endowed Chair in the Arts and thought-leading artist and curator DeWitt Godfrey mounted the first exhibition of Black Mystery Month to a packed house in the gallery. I was in conversations with students, faculty, and staff and in the auditorium for the public talk.\n\nThe conceptual artist Luis Camnitzer said it well: “The museum is a school; the artist learns to communicate; the public learns to make connections.” The US has an estimated 680 university galleries and museums, which are schools within schools. They will become more important in higher education generally, and in art and design education specifically, as they face long-standing mandates for reinvention. I’m looking forward to making my classrooms bigger, by collaborating with as many of these schools as I can. Moving forward, Black Mystery Month will transition to other neighborhoods, beyond the ivory tower.\n\nWHL You’ve essentially been commissioned to teach—by students. Every one of your classes is a think tank. You’re the founding director of a graduate program to foster thought leaders and influencers working in photography and media. You have linked your mission as an artist to your agenda as an institution builder. Your colleagues tell you your program is one they wished they had. What is your mission, and what are your hopes for the next generation of image-makers and spectators?\n\nBG I want the next generation to produce informed visual, material, and media culture—works that act as social mirrors within and beyond fine art and do so at a high level. I want them to cultivate the skills, aptitudes, and literacies to be in conversations of their choice that matter. I want them to generate public conversations and arouse audiences to think deeper about what it means to live in this chapter of the human story—with and without cameras and software, and being smarter than the technology they use. I want them to be civic, relevant, and build fiscally solvent and creatively diversified practices through cultural and commercial economies funded by supportive communities of informed and inspired spectators. I’ve institutionalized a mission-driven curriculum, pedagogy, and wisdom, that provide skills, aptitudes, and literacies for the artist-as-thought-leader. For these wishes to become reality the next generation must be curious, courageous, committed, and creative; these are virtues that cannot be taught, they must be sought. This is the challenge.\n\nWHL I know that your studio is larger and deeper than a physical space, but talk about how your ideas inform and inspire your studio practice.\n\nBG Public images of Black people commonly appear through anthropology, journalism, and advertising. Most photographs are redundant, disposable, and ephemeral temporary images that are forgettable. How can I produce photographs and moving images that aren’t disposable, ephemeral, and forgettable? And how can those images be evergreen, not locked in one moment or in a movement? These are some fundamental questions that inform what I do at the level of concept, form, and content.\n\nI think anyone who identifies themselves as a photographer sees the world in “optical terms” (to quote Louis Draper), where the photograph is a lens-based image which functions as a visually sophisticated metaphor that can be a poem or a story. This is something quite challenging to do because it requires extraordinary attention and preoptical visual literacies.\n\nEvery photographer wants to have something in what I call the “book of human witness,” that grand anthology of images that is bigger than any one of our individual archives and consists of pictures that are part of our imaginations when photographs are thought about. Inspired by the work in the first Black Photographers Annual and other mid-twentieth-century Modernist photography, I spent years developing the ability to see the world on optical terms and spontaneously respond to isolated moments of life by taking photographs that would be part of that book of witness—or so I hoped. Eventually I worked to create photographs worthy of a book that I was the author of.\n\nWHL How did you pivot from taking lens-based images as metaphor to become, as you say, “a part of the conversation about the humanity of Black people”—particularly in the face of relentlessly inhumane visual depictions and treatment in the United States?\n\nBG Okay, here’s the history lesson. Aside from my obsession with the humanity of Black people expressed through visual, material, sonic, scholarly, and media culture and daily living, it was the intersectionality of Black Independent Cinema through Charles Burnett’s My Brother’s Wedding and Julie Dash’s Illusions and Toni Cade Bambara’s scriptwriting for W.E.B. Du Bois: A Biography in Four Voices. All that led me to ask: How can a photograph do the same thing that these films do—contribute to the conversation about Black people’s humanity in the face of inhumanity and especially highlight the joy part of our humanity?\n\nThe conceptual pivot came when I chose to merge my interests in photography, cinema, and nonfiction writing informed by American and African American Studies. That’s also when I understood I didn’t have to choose between my interests in African American Studies and my interest in photography and cinema, but I could merge the visual and liberal arts as a characteristic feature of my practice. And that merger would take my work beyond a formal compositional focus that might appeal to only a small group of connoisseurs exclusively focused on questions of art and on how photography “fit” as art.\n\nBecause photography is an interdisciplinary medium that requires an interdisciplinary approach to its production and reception, I understood: the more informed the concepts of my work are beyond photography (and cinema), the more informed the work process and outcome becomes. And the more informed the image-making becomes, the more informed the spectator becomes. The viewer, no matter what their racial identification is, sees something of themselves through these representations of Black people.\n\nGood and Bad Hair was the breakthrough, the pivot, but I didn’t want to repeat the subject matter going forward. In the work I did after that series, I’ve only sought to be in the conversation about the humanity of Black people in a way that is as interdisciplinary as my range of mediums and interests.\n\nWHL Now I got to straighten something out: I have to say for the record that a second edition of Good and Bad Hair is long overdue—with the proper amplification through the cultural marketing apparatus befitting the book’s form, content, and historical significance.\n\nBG There are not many books of photographs that are reprinted, especially by Black photographers. I very much appreciate that pitch, and the check will be in the mail! This is the last thing I’ll say about Good and Bad Hair. Any myths about photography being racially neutral were dismantled and obliterated by my experience of other people’s responses to viewing Tamara and Tireka, Easter Sunday, Baltimore, Maryland, 1994. It is the most published image from the sixty portraits in the book, and it has certainly been a touchstone for so many, so many Black folk who see it because they know those girls, right? But there were two instances, one involving white reception and the other one involving Black reception, where people were offended by this photograph. The photograph is in the collection of a university museum that will not be named. And like many university collections of art, they display work throughout the campus.\n\nSo Tamara and Tireka was embedded in an administrative office. The curator told me at one point, the people in the office asked that the photograph be removed. And the reason they gave was that the workers said the photograph was too intimidating. This pictorial representation of two confident Black girls looking the viewer straight in the eye was, I gather, karmically or cosmically, violating one of the Black codes of 1866 that said Black people could not look white people in the eye. That’s at the extreme of the white gaze, then at another extreme, there’s class issues among Black people that make the photograph of Tamara and Tireka uncomfortable for them. A Black woman viewer said that “They’re just hoochie girls, and that’s not their real hair.” And so I’ve heard it from both sides. What this says to me is if the mere representation of a Black body can cause this much fear and angst, there are still many people who have much work to do with and on themselves.\n\nWHL I’m glad you brought it back to this idea of how anyone can be engaged. This brings us to that wonderful community project you created, The Meaning of Hope, which needed the community of Detroit to be engaged and be a part. It linked cinema, written and spoken words, and how those words look on the screen, but it also included people’s faces and voices dramatizing the text of an obscure sermon by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a year before his assassination. You’ve always both spoken to and with communities through your work; that is a fundamental aspect of your practice. The Meaning of Hope is a moving image, a documentary, a crafted image, and a constructed conversation all in one. What I love about you as an artist is that you are also an analyst. In your projects, multiple conversations take place at the same time, which harks back to you growing up in the midst of conversations, in a tradition of simultaneous ideas.\n\nBG The Meaning of Hope was a collaboration with Wayne State University when I was Endowed Chair in the Visual Arts in their art and art history department. It involved a multi-ethnic, multi-generational group of thirty-four residents from the city of Detroit, most of whom didn’t know one another, nor myself. The youngest person was seven years old. The oldest person was the late Grace Lee Boggs who was approaching her ninety-eighth year. One of the residents in the film was Emile Crawley, a superb vocal actor, and a person of consequence who unexpectedly emerged as a sonic touchstone and presence throughout the film.\n\nThe project took place at a time when Detroit was perceived as a hopeless city that inspired what was termed “ruin porn”—art photographers embedded themselves to produce large-scale images of streets and buildings without people using Hopper-esque lighting for individual and institutional art collectors and curators.\n\nI wanted to create a counternarrative that would offer a human presence through cinema and more. The twenty-minute film introduced viewers to the thoughts of a selected group of people from across the city about a funda-mental human resource, hope.\n\nWHL How did you “construct” the conversation we’re seeing?\n\nBG The participants in the film were chosen from a portal on the Wayne State website, which they were drawn to following an interview with me about the project that aired on the Detroit Public radio station. Each participant answered four questions posted on the portal. What does hope mean to you? What are you hopeful about? What are you hopeless about? What do you hope for others and the world? The film was not scripted; with the exception of a few spontaneous and improvisational thoughts, and direction from me, each person performed their initial written responses before a camera in a studio. Also, everyone spoke lines from the text of the King sermon that were given to them on the spot. None of the people were in the same room with each other. The production was not linear. There was no storyboard guiding the production team. I only filmed each of the thirty-four participants and then created the final product a year later. The film begins and ends with a poem I wrote after my time in Detroit ended. Like so much about The Meaning of Hope, that poem was neither planned nor imagined at the project’s outset. Writing it, I drew from notebook entries l made in Detroit during my time there.\n\nWHL Talk about your use of music in The Meaning of Hope. It has such a quiet power.\n\nBG During preproduction meetings with the team at Wayne State, I was asked about music. I decided that I wanted a bass solo playing under the participants’ voices. Three people told me I needed to get the legendary Detroit bassist and composer Marion Hayden. She saw a rough cut of the film and then gave me a CD filled with about thirty-five different cuts of varying lengths, from thirty seconds to two minutes. It became my task to arrange these recordings into a score. I had to learn an audio editing program that enabled me to shorten or lengthen a musical phrase and to add other effects. I thoroughly enjoyed doing that work. The Meaning of Hope merged so much of what I engage with creatively—photography, cinema, poetry, written and spoken language, music, and the thoughts and ideas of people. Some cinematic experiences need to be seen in the presence of other human beings. For The Meaning of Hope I wanted an audience in a black box without mobile phones, all focused on the same thing at the same time and having an experience that can only happen collectively.\n\nWHL Not unlike folk tales being told and passed on.\n\nBG Exactly. So it was a powerful day seeing it screened in the Film Theatre of the Detroit Institute of Arts on a snowy February day that drew hundreds of people. The Meaning of Hope is not a film locked in time, it’s evergreen. It’s not about Detroit, it’s from Detroit. This film was made for them with them for then. Like a live performance. One woman in the audience told me, “You really got who we are.” This response underscores the fact that while The Meaning of Hope is not a documentary film in the least—everything in it is true.\n\nWHL Simon Ortiz has a great quote: “If it’s fiction, it better be true.” In fiction, you have to make sure it connects to people and the characters feel believable. Even though it’s fiction, we have to feel, see, and touch the humanity of the people in the narrative or within yourself.\n\nBG In the English language, and perhaps in other languages too, the words that signify human comprehension of an idea, a concept, a principle, a value, or another human being, are “I see.” So understanding is also optical for us, involving shape, or form, right? And because I believe understanding is optical, nothing will replace or supersede the power of the human witness—especially in a world of artificial reality. The search for the original, or the source of the artificial image will continue, as will the book of human witness."
