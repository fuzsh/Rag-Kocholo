        "text": "The National LGBTQ+ Bar Association’s annual Lavender Law® Career Fair is designed to achieve a sense of community and inclusion for LGBTQ+ candidates within the legal profession’s recruiting efforts. By participating in this career fair, candidates will talk directly to LGBTQ+ friendly recruiters from law firms, government agencies, LGBTQ+ rights groups, and corporate legal departments.\n\nIf your organization wishes to recruit at the Lavender Law® Career Fair, you must commit to be a sponsor.\n\nOnly law firms that have a nondiscrimination policy that includes sexual orientation and gender identity/expression are eligible to recruit at the Career Fair. Click here to see our 2023 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Index.\n\nThe Lavender Law® Conference and Career Fair actively seeks the involvement of individuals from every segment of the legal community and particularly welcomes the participation of people of color, transgender persons and persons with disabilities. Membership in the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association is open to all lawyers, legal professionals, law students and other individuals in the legal profession without regard to age, race, religion, gender, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\n\nIndividual Career Counseling\n\nThis program is designed to provide students with a safe, confidential space where they can ask questions about job search skills, being out on your resume, in interviews and in the workplace, and other related issues.\n\nIn conjunction with the Lavender Law® Career Fair, students will have the opportunity to meet virtually with legal career service professionals. These legal career counselors are qualified to provide students with advice on resume, cover letters, and interviewing. Further, these counselors all have significant workplace experience in various legal sectors, including LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, big firms, and the government.\n\nAlliant International Law School\n\nAmerican University Washington College of Law\n\nArizona State University School of Law\n\nBenjamin N.
