        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., and WEST RUPERT, Vt. — William H. Lewis, 76, passed away on Monday, Aug. 20, 2018 in Portland, Oregon at the Pease Hospital from the effects of a stroke which he suffered in 2010.\n\nHe was born in Cambridge, New York and raised in West Rupert, son of C.H. Lewis Jr. and Helen Shattuck Lewis. He attended Salem Washington Academy K-10 and graduated from Tilton School in New Hampshire in 1959. Will was a graduate of the University of Vermont in 1963. He was president of his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and the Interfraternity Council. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army through the ROTC program.\n\nHe married Patricia Baldwin Absten in 1964, and shortly thereafter was deployed to Vietnam where he honorably served as a member of the Night Hawks 20th ASTA detachment.\n\nHe lost his first wife to cancer. He later married Mary Florence Trohn in 1987, who predeceased him by five months. Also predeceasing him by a week was their dog, Sophie.\n\nBill was in national sales for Riegel Paper Co. for a short time and then the Boise-Cascade Corporation. Following his retirement from Boise-Cascade, he was a self-employed contractor in the paper business.\n\nDuring his early years, he enjoyed fishing trips to Canada with his family and later fishing trips to Alaska with co-workers.\n\nHe is survived by a brother, Donald Shattuck Lewis of West Rupert, a nephew, two nieces, three cousins and a neighbor and compassionate friend, Andres Frate.\n\nA private service will be held at the Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery at a later date.\n\nTo offer condolences to Will’s family, please visit www.gariepyfuneralhomes.com.\n\nArrangements are under the care of McClellan-Gariepy Funeral Home Inc., Salem."
