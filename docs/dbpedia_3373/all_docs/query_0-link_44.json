She learned to read and write while with the family, and wrote her first poem, “To the University of Cambridge, in New England,” at age fourteen. Her book of poetry, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, in 1773, brought her renown in the Colonies and in England, as she wrote about contemporary events and people, including George Washington (who invited her to meet after she sent him a poem about him). Her later poems were published in various newspapers and pamphlets, but they were never published in a second volume during her lifetime.\n\nNancy Gardner Prince (1799-1856)\n\nBorn in Newburyport, Nancy Gardner Prince grew up around Boston, marrying Nero Prince, a founding member of the Prince Hall Freemasons in Boston.
