        "text": "Valdas V. Adamkus\n\nCivil Engineering 1961, Hon. Ph.D. 1999\n\nValdas V. Adamkus (CE ’61, Hon. Ph.D. ’99), a Lithuanian immigrant, had a 27-year career with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, after which he returned to his homeland to serve as president for two terms [1998–2003, 2004–09]. Adamkus’s career with the EPA was capped by his appointment as administrator of EPA Region 5, responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution-control efforts in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1985 President Ronald Reagan presented him with the President’s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service.\n\nPhilip Danforth Armour Sr.\n\nFounders Group\n\nBusiness tycoon, captain of industry, philanthropist, the richest man in Chicago—all of these terms identify Philip Danforth Armour Sr. Inspired by minister Frank Wakely Gunsaulus’s vision of building a school to provide accessible higher education to all, Armour gave $1 million in 1890 to found Armour Institute, a predecessor of Illinois Tech. His initial gift multiplied several times over as he, his spouse, Malvina Belle Ogden, and their son J. Ogden each contributed to the growth and support of the college from their own personal wealth for the next 30 years.\n\nAlex D. Bailey\n\nFounders Group\n\nA graduate of Lewis Institute and a member of the Lewis Institute Board of Trustees, Alexander D. Bailey served as board chairman. In his professional life he was an executive within the Commonwealth Edison power plant system. In 1939 Bailey and Armour Institute of Technology board chairman James D. Cunningham announced the merger of the two institutes to form Illinois Institute of Technology. Following the merger, Bailey served on the Illinois Tech Board of Trustees until his death.\n\nJoseph M. Bailey\n\nFounders Group\n\nAlong with Thomas A. Moran, Joseph M. Bailey, a former chief justice of Illinois, co-founded the Chicago Evening Law Class, which later became the Chicago College of Law (the law department at Lake Forest University), with Bailey serving as dean from 1888 to 1895. Chicago College of Law later merged with Kent College of Law to form Chicago-Kent College of Law; in 1969 Chicago-Kent became Illinois Tech’s law school.\n\nAndrea Berry\n\nComputer Science 1984\n\nAndrea Berry, an Illinois Institute of Technology Life Trustee, is the senior vice president and general manager of the broadcast, TV, and film division for the Production Resource Group, where she manages global teams that create technology solutions for live television sports, entertainment, and news as well as scripted and unscripted projects for film and television. Inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame, Berry has served as an award-winning broadcast media executive for the FOX and CBS television networks. She is on the boards of the Sports Video Group and the DuSable Museum of African American History. Berry is a recipient of four Outstanding Technical Team Remote Emmy awards and was also recognized by the Alliance for Women in Media for STEM Leadership in Media. Berry received the Technology Leadership Award from Broadcasting & Cable magazine and the Women in Technology Leadership Award from TVNewsCheck, and she participates in many organizations advocating STEAM education and diversity.\n\nJulia A. Beveridge\n\nStaff Member\n\nFor more than three decades Julia A. Beveridge was involved with Armour Institute of Technology. She first benefited the institute through Plymouth Church and Armour Mission, where she taught practical skills to neighborhood children and served as librarian. Recruited by Philip Armour and Frank Gunsaulus to help staff Armour Institute of Technology from its inception, Beveridge served as registrar and assistant librarian, and then as librarian for the last 20 years until her death in 1919.\n\nDavid P. Boder\n\nProfessor and Chair, Department of Psychology 1927–1952 Illinois Tech and Lewis Institute\n\nDavid P. Boder was a former faculty member and head of the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at Chicago’s Lewis Institute (one of Illinois Tech’s predecessor colleges), and researcher of displaced persons later known as Holocaust survivors. In 1946 Boder traveled from Illinois Tech to Eastern Europe, taking with him a 50-pound wire recorder and 200 spools of carbon steel wire on which he recorded 119 interviews with individuals. These interviews provide the first and only known audio record of this important part of history. His 1949 book, I Did Not Interview the Dead, captures eight of these stories. Materials from Boder’s Voices of the Holocaust project were placed on permanent loan to the Illinois Holocaust Museum, which opened in Skokie in 2009, and the United States Holocaust Museum has since re-interviewed survivors.\n\nRobert “Pete” H. Bragg Jr.\n\nPhysics 1949, M.S. 1951, Ph.D. 1960\n\nRobert H. “Pete” Bragg II was an expert in X-ray crystallography and X-ray diffraction, and their applications to the structure and electronic properties of carbon materials. Bragg worked at Dover Electroplating Company, Portland Cement Association Research Laboratory, and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. In 1969 he accepted a full professorship and joint appointment in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was the only African American in his department until 1987. Bragg moved up the ranks in the military and served as a United States Army lieutenant in World War II. He was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship in 1992 to conduct research for one year at Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. A fellow of the National Society of Black Physicists, Bragg received the society’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015.\n\nRowine H. Brown Truitt\n\nLaw 1961\n\nA humanitarian in medicine and the law, Rowine H. Brown Truitt significantly advanced a humanitarian approach to medical treatment in hospitals and to the rule of law in society. As medical director and chief of staff at a major United States hospital (Cook County Hospital, now John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital)—the first woman to hold this position—she pioneered advances in medicine, law, and the interaction of the two, particularly in the area of child abuse.\n\nMarvin Camras\n\nElectrical Engineering 1940, M.S. 1942\n\nChicago native Marvin Camras created an innovative magnetic recording head during his undergraduate years that improved sound quality by impressing a recording symmetrically on a wire by the gap of air between the wire and the head. His research led to developments that underlie many modern recording and communication techniques. Camras received numerous awards for his work, most notably the 1990 National Medal of Technology and Innovation.\n\nGeorge N. Carman\n\nFounders Group\n\nGeorge N. Carman served as director of Lewis Institute from its founding. He was a leader in the field of higher education, pioneering the junior college system and school accreditation. Though the term was not then used, Lewis Institute was the first junior college in the United States. Carman also was one of the originators of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\n\nMartin Cooper\n\nElectrical Engineering 1950, M.S. 1957\n\nMartin “Marty” Cooper developed an early version of the mobile handheld cell phone in the 1960s in response to a Chicago police superintendent’s request for a device that would help keep officers connected while working their beats. Cooper, a senior engineer at Motorola, and his team outfitted the officers with a microphone and an antenna that they wore on their shoulders, using an early type of a cellular system. In the early 1970s, Cooper’s team developed not only the first handheld cell phone but also a system to support it. In 1973 Cooper placed the first mobile cell phone call—phoning his counterpart at Bell Labs, Joel Engel. Today Cooper is considered a global thought leader on personal communication devices, wireless technology, and spectrum use. He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the National Academy of Engineering Charles Stark Draper Prize and the Prince of Asturias Award for technical and scientific research. He is a fellow of the IEEE and the Radio Club of America, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nFrank A. Crossley\n\nChemical Engineering 1945, M.S. Metallurgical Engineering 1947, Ph.D. Metallurgical Engineering 1950\n\nFrank Crossley broke ground three times: He was the first African-American United States Navy officer, the first person to earn a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology, and the first person of African ancestry in the world to earn a Ph.D. in the field. His successes in the military led then President Harry S. Truman to issue an executive order in 1948 to desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces. Crossley went on to become a professor and department head of foundry engineering at Tennessee State University, and held research positions with IIT Research Institute, Aerojet TechSystems Company, and Lockheed Missile and Space Company, where he earned a patent for inventing a new class of titanium alloys. He eventually received a total of seven patents and authored more than 60 papers.\n\nJames D. Cunningham\n\nFounders Group\n\nOrphaned by the age of 13, James D. Cunningham was a successful Chicago businessman who achieved success in the classic American rags to riches story. In 1932 he accepted the chairmanship of the Armour Institute of Technology Board of Trustees. Seven years later Cunningham and Alexander D. Bailey, chairman of the Lewis Institute Board of Trustees, announced the merger of the two institutes to form Illinois Institute of Technology. Cunningham then accepted the board chairmanship of the newly created Illinois Tech, which he held until 1961.\n\nLee de Forest\n\nFaculty 1899-1901\n\nLee de Forest served as a faculty member at Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute during the turn of the twentieth century. During that time he conducted his first long-distance broadcasts from the roof of Main Building. He invented the Audion three-element vacuum tube; the resulting tube amplified electric signals and served as a fast-switching element that later would be used in digital electronics. De Forest also patented a method of recording sound on film that the movie industry would later adopt. He received an honorary Oscar, was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was inducted posthumously into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nLloyd H. Donnell\n\nFaculty 1939–1962\n\nA mechanical engineering faculty member from 1939–1962 and an internationally renowned expert in engineering mechanics, Lloyd H. Donnell is best known for formulating the Donnell equations, which simplify the equations for the design of thin-walled shells such as storage tanks, rockets, and submarine hulls. He was founding editor of Applied Mechanics Reviews, the bi-monthly magazine published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nMarshall D. Ewell\n\nFounders Group\n\nA respected lawyer, educator, and doctor, Marshall D. Ewell founded Kent College of Law, which merged with Chicago College of Law in 1900 to become Chicago-Kent College of Law. Chicago-Kent merged with Illinois Tech in 1969. He is credited with helping to move the study of law out of judges’ chambers and into the academic arena of university classrooms, thereby emphasizing the benefits of formal academic study as entry into the fields of law and public office.\n\nWilliam F. Finkl\n\nChemical Engineering 1918\n\nFormer chairman of A. Finkl & Sons Co. (now Finkl Steel), the steel company his grandfather founded in 1879, William F. Finkl introduced quality control into the steel industry. He invented numerous steel alloys, particularly those used in creating forging dies, and patented manufacturing processes for steel fabrication. Finkl was a member of the Illinois Tech Board of Trustees beginning in 1948. In 1980 Illinois Tech’s interactive television network was named in his honor.\n\nMax Frocht\n\nFaculty 1946–1960\n\nA Polish émigré, Max Frocht served on Illinois Tech’s mechanical engineering faculty from 1946–1960 and then directed the university’s Laboratory for Experimental Stress Analysis. His classic two-volume treatise on photoelasticity was translated into Russian, Spanish, and Chinese. The M. M. Frocht Award, created in his honor, is presented annually by the Society for Experimental Mechanics and recognizes “outstanding achievement as an educator in the field of experimental mechanics.”\n\nRobert W. Galvin\n\nBenefactor\n\nRobert W. Galvin transformed Motorola into a global leader in the manufacture and distribution of cellular phones and other telecommunications devices.
