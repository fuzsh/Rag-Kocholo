        "text": "Harvard Law School (colloquially, Harvard Law or HLS) is one of the professional graduate schools of Harvard University. Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard Law is considered one of the most prestigious law schools in the United States. It is the country's second-oldest law school, and the oldest in continuous operation. It is also home to the largest academic law library in the world. The school's frequent referencing in American culture has led the Wall Street Journal 's law blog to declare that there was \"no doubt...Harvard Law School holds a special place in our nation?s collective consciousness\". Harvard Law introduced what would become the standard first-year curriculum for American law schools - including classes in contracts, property, torts, criminal law, and civil procedure - in the 1870s, under Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell. At Harvard, Langdell also developed the case method of teaching law, which became the dominant model for U.S. law schools.\n\nContact information\n\nDeciding to attend law school requires a large financial investment with the goal of securing employment upon graduation.
