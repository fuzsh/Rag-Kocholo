        "text": "Ball received his bachelor`s degree in political science and his master`s degree in public policy from the University of Michigan. He was the first university graduate in his family. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he received his Juris Doctor in 2010. 2007: Julianne Malveaux, economist, author, and stock market columnist, was named president of Bennett College, the historically black college for women in Greensboro, North Carolina. 1886: Meharry Medical College founds a dental school. 2008: According to the U.S. Department of Education, blacks earned 142,420 four-year bachelor`s degrees from U.S. colleges and universities in 2006. The number of black licensees increased by more than 4 per cent compared to the previous year in 2005. In 2006, the number of African Americans earning a bachelor`s degree was the highest in the nation`s history.\n\nThis number was more than double the number of bachelor`s degrees obtained by blacks in 1990. In 1873 Greener accepted a position as professor of mental and moral philosophy at South Carolina College (later University of South Carolina), where he also attended classes in Latin, Greek, mathematics, and constitutional history. At the end of the Civil War, South Carolina was the first college in the South to admit black students. Greener, the school`s first African-American faculty member, gained a reputation as a brilliant scholar and teacher. In 1877, however, white conservatives regained power in South Carolina and closed the integrated college. When it reopened, it was an agricultural school for whites only. Greener and all the other faculty members who had taught the black students were fired. 1932: Samuel Milton Nabrit, former president of Texas Southern University, becomes the first black person to receive a doctorate in embryology. He is a graduate of Brown University. 2007: For the first time in the school`s 238-year history, Dartmouth College achieved its first triplets.\n\nThe three graduates are African-American sisters from San Diego, California. 1893 – Daniel Hale Williams, a graduate of Chicago Medical College (now Northwestern University Medical School), performs the world`s first successful open-heart surgery. 2008: New data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association shows that the graduation rate of black students has increased by one percentage point this year. This is the seventh consecutive year that we have seen a one-percentage-point increase in university graduation rates for Black men and women. 1872: John Henry Conyers becomes the first black student to enter the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. A year later, he resigned after difficulties at school. 1969: Major M.M. Adams, a professor of military science, is hired by the Citadel and becomes the first black faculty member.\n\nIn this video, Professors Annette Gordon-Reed `84, Kenneth Mack `91 and David Wilkins `80 of Harvard Law School, discuss four pioneering African Americans who became the first black graduates of Harvard Law School in the years immediately following the Emancipation Proclamation: George Lewis Ruffin in 1869, Archibald Grimke in 1874, Clement Morgan in 1893 and William Henry Lewis in 1895, all four having had successful careers as lawyers. Activists and agents of social change. Just as Greener was against Douglass, he was on Washington`s side of the growing division in the African-American world. On one side, there was the accommodating and therefore politically powerful and adequately funded booker T. Washington. [ref. needed] On the other side were Monroe Trotter, W.E.B. DuBois and their supporters, who insisted that they had constitutional rights and that those rights must be respected. [ref.\n\nneeded] This gave birth to the Niagara conferences and the NAACP. [ref. needed] Greener was so closely allied with Washington that Washington sent him to the Second Niagara Conference on explicit charges of espionage and reporting. 1982: The Reagan administration launches an unsuccessful attempt to grant tax-exempt status to segregated private schools, including Bob Jones University. 1956: The University of Florida School of Law is ordered to appoint Virgil Darnell Hawkins to the Florida ex rel. Control Council following a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. Hawkins withdrew his application as a condition under which Florida agreed to the integration of the law school."
