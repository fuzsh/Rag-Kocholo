        "text": "Decades before the creation of the Ivy League, its member schools led the way in the integration of college football. William Henry Lewis, born in Berkeley, Va., in 1868 to a pair of emancipated slaves, paved the way. At age 15, he enrolled in the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, an all-black school now known as Virginia State University. Lewis transferred to Amherst College (Mass.), where he joined William Tecumseh Sherman Jackson as the first African-Americans to play college football at a predominantly white college. Williams played three seasons at Amherst, serving as the team captain in 1891.\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst, Lewis attended Harvard Law School, and he served as the Crimson’s starting center for two seasons. He was named an All-American both years, becoming the first African-American to do so. He continued his devotion to the game of football as an assistant coach at Harvard, leading the team to a 114–15–5 record from 1895-1906. The Crimson claimed back-to-back national titles in 1898 and 1899.\n\nLewis embarked on his political career by successfully running for election to the Cambridge Common Council where he served from 1899-1902. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Lewis to become the first African-American Assistant U.S. Attorney. Lewis made headlines seven years later, when President William Howard Taft appointed Lewis as the first African-American U.S. Assistant Attorney General. In 1911, he became one of the first African-Americans to be admitted to the American Bar Association. Following Taft’s presidency, Lewis returned to Massachusetts to enter the private practice of law. He passed away in Boston in 1949 at the age of 80. Lewis was posthumously inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1980 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nShortly before William Lewis’ graduation from Harvard Law School, another racial pioneer of collegiate football entered the world as Frederick Douglass “Fritz” Pollard. Born in Chicago, Pollard attended Albert Grannis Lane Manual Training High School, also known as “Lane Tech,” and he then enrolled as a chemistry student at Brown University. Starring as a halfback for the Bears, Pollard led Brown to a 5-3-1 record in 1915 and an appearance in the second-ever Rose Bowl in his first season. The 1916 Brown squad, behind 12 total touchdowns from Pollard, became the first school to beat Harvard and Yale in the same season. In 1954, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter two seasons as the head football coach at Lincoln University (Pa.), Pollard became one of the first African-American players in the National Football League (then the American Professional Football Association) as a running back for the Akron Pros in 1920. He helped the team to an APFA championship, earning First Team All-League honors. The following year, he was named the coach of the Pros, accomplishing another milestone as the first black coach in the NFL, while continuing to star on the gridiron as well. Pollard and the other nine black players in the league at the time were removed from the league at the end of the 1926 season. He responded by attempting to start multiple all-black teams, before moving on to other ventures, including a talent agency, tax consulting and film and music production. Pollard was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005. He passed away in 1986 at the age of 92.\n\nJust a week after Fritz Pollard became the first African-American to play in the 1916 Rose Bowl, Jerome Heartwood \"Brud\" Holland, who would become the first African-American to play at Cornell University, was born in Auburn, N.Y. Starring as an end for the Big Red, Holland earned Consensus All-America honors in 1938, and the National Football Foundation inducted him into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1965. He also excelled in the Cornell classrooms as a straight-A student, which would set the stage for his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania and an enormously successful career.\n\nHe served as President of Delaware State College from 1953-60 and the Hampton Institute from 1960-70. In 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed Holland to become the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. The year 1972 proved to be a momentous one for Holland, who continued to blaze the trails for African-Americans as the first to sit on the board of the New York Stock Exchange, and he received the NCAA’s Theodore Roosevelt Award and the NFF Distinguished American Award. He passed away in 1985 at the age of 69 and posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
