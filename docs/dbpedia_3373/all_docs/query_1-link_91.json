        "text": "Biography\n\nCatherine’s (she/her) work focuses on issues of environmental law and policy, particularly environmental justice and American Indian nations’ rights. She has taught at University of Washington, University of Arizona, University of Oregon, Lewis & Clark, and Seattle University, where she was a Professor of Law and a Faculty Fellow with the Center for Indian Law & Policy. Her courses include Property, Natural Resources, Environmental Law, Environmental Justice, Indian Law & Natural Resources, and Advanced Indian Law in Practice: Restoration of the Elwha River.\n\nCatherine left academia for a period to work for the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission as a Habitat Policy Analyst. She has also served as a consultant for various environmental and intertribal organizations, including Earthjustice, the National Tribal Toxics Council, and the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), as well as for several individual tribes. Catherine is a Member Scholar with the Center for Progressive Reform, a non-profit research and advocacy organization that seeks to inform public policy for a healthy environment and a just society. She is a co-author of the textbook ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: LAW, POLICY & REGULATION (3rd ed., 2020), and the author of numerous articles and book chapters, including Exposed: Asking the Wrong Question in Risk Regulation (Arizona State Law Journal, 2016); Fishable Waters (American Indian Law Journal, 2013); No Mud Pies: Risk Avoidance as Risk Regulation (Vermont Law Review, 2007); and Mercury, Risk, and Justice (Environmental Law Reporter, 2004). Catherine was a Ford Foundation Fellow at Harvard Law School, and earned her J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nReflections on Teaching at Seattle University in 2023-24\n\nI’m thrilled to be part of a community that shares the conviction that law is a tool for social change. It will be a pleasure to rejoin SU’s talented and committed students, staff, and faculty to grapple with questions about how this tool might thoughtfully be wielded.\n\nIn my view, this is a crucial time for ensuring that environmental law and policy solutions are not only bold but just. I’m excited to work with the students at SU to ask how this can be done. SU stands apart because social justice is always a part of the conversation."
