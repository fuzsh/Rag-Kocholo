        "text": "John Lewis Invictus Academy, Home of the Royal Lions, is located in the heart of the historic Grove Park community in Atlanta, Georgia. When Atlanta Public Schools opened John Lewis Invictus Academy in the fall of 2017, the school welcomed approximately 300 students. Now, J.L.I.A. boasts a student population of over 850 middle school students. A Title I school, with a student body comprised of 95.4% African American, 4% Hispanic, 0.2% Multiracial, 0.4% White, and 100% free and reduced lunch, the faculty and staff are committed to providing quality, engaging, differentiated lessons. Our key foci are Climate and Culture, High-Quality Teaching, Literacy, and S.T.E.A.M.\n\nJohn Lewis Invictus Academy is a part of the Douglass Cluster; therefore, its signature focus is the S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) pathway. By exposing scholars to the tenets of a S.T.E.A.M. education, they can strengthen their critical thinking skills and engage in real-world scenarios as they work collaboratively to solve problems for their community by working with local businesses and post-secondary partnerships.\n\nJ.L.I.A. scholars will work across all disciplines to research, synthesize, envision, and execute PBL (project-based learning) tasks with a S.T.E.A.M. focus. These PBL experiences will exemplify their deep understanding of selected, high-interest topics as they strive to be productive, 21st-century learners who embody the five core competencies of Social Emotional Learning: Social Awareness, Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Relationship Skills, and Responsible Decision-Making. Additionally, they have resolved to show up for themselves, their families, and their community daily as they approach their studies with our core values of Perseverance | Respect | Integrity | Discipline | Excellenceâ€”P.R.I.D.E."
