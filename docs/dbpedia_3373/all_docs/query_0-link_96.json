        "text": "A Merrillville High School graduate is switching gears and heading back to school this fall.\n\nDavid Jonathan Lewis, a 2015 graduate and class president, will exchange his role as teacher back to student and start down the path of graduate school for a master’s in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. He also plans to enroll in Harvard Law School through a joint degree program.\n\nMr. Lewis hopes to use his higher education and experience to serve in a state government as a senator or representative in the near future. He desires to work on the Education Committee.\n\n“In doing this, I will play an important role in promoting community understanding of policies that support inclusiveness and civility among residents,” he said. “More specifically, I will focus on education and work to provide training on multicultural awareness and civil rights issues to support not only students, but also school personnel.”\n\nHe encourages anyone who is interested in following his journey to visit his website www.davidjlewis.org and subscribe.\n\n“As I transition into both graduate and law programs, I am looking for resources and support to aid me on my journey,” he said.\n\nThe MHS alumnus, who is currently teaching fourth grade reading in the Indianapolis schools, has some words of wisdom for this year’s graduating class.\n\n“This year as a teacher, I reminded my students daily that they are loved, mistakes are okay, and they can do anything they set their minds to,” he said. “Those affirmations did not only encourage my elementary students, but also motivated and reminded me of who I am daily and whose I am. That is my advice to you as a graduate of Merrillville High School.”\n\nAfter MHS graduation, Mr. Lewis immediately attended the University of Indianapolis for one academic year as an undergraduate political science major. He later transferred to IUPUI in the fall of 2016 to study public affairs through the O'Neill School of Public & Environmental Affairs program.\n\n“Because I was enrolled in dual credit courses at MHS, I finished my undergraduate program in three years total in 2018,” he said.\n\nHe said his experience at MHS was filled with opportunities to grow, not only academically, but also socially and spiritually.\n\n“Many of the faculty and staff members always challenged and encouraged me to work beyond my known abilities,” he said. “Administrators provided me with various opportunities to serve my community. There were countless safe spaces for me to create everlasting friendships with several of my peers.”\n\nSome of the teachers he said had the most impact on him included: Sra. Monica DaCosta Gomez, Mrs. Patti Tubbs-Clark, Mr. Mark Danielson, Ms. Teresa Proctor (retired), Mr. Dan Moslander, Mrs. Debbie Willison (retired), Mr. John Branda (retired), Ms. Sharon Row (retired), and Mrs. Alison Skertic.\n\nHe is still in touch with friends from his days at MHS: Marguerite Culbreath, elementary educator, and Reesie Woods, songwriter.\n\nAside from being class president for four years, Mr. Lewis’ high school years were filled with numerous activities, including the Band of Pirates drum major, 2013-15; captain of the Mock Trial Team, 2012-15; student government, Bible Club Leader, 2011-2015; freshman mentor; National Honor Society, 2014-15; and Merrillville Education Foundation Board Member, 2014-15.\n\nHe said Mr. Krutz’s advice is something every student should take into consideration."
