He was born on October 2,1949 in Florence, South Carolina and was the 2nd oldest child of his seven siblings.\n\nGrowing up, Nunk loved to work alongside his grandparents the late Moses “Bess” Muldrow and the late Creola Ashley Muldrow also known as “Grandma Weebie”. He and the older siblings worked in the fields, where they picked tobacco, cotton, peanuts, corn & other vegetables. He attended Savannah Grove Elementary and Wilson Middle & High Schools until he moved to Brooklyn, New York at the age of 17. Although he left Florence, he would return as often as he could to see family.\n\nIn Brooklyn, he attended John Jay High School. It was during this time, he met his neighborhood childhood sweetheart, Charlene Ketchmore. While in high school he also worked at May’s department store. Nate graduated from John Jay and was immediately drafted into the Unites States Army in 1969. He married Charlene in Dec of 1969 and during their 18-year union they had 3 daughters: Yvette, Elisha (Lisa) and Evonda.\n\nNate was sent to the Vietnam War and served his country from 1969 to 1972. In the Army, Nate was a member of the 7th Pysops (Psychological) Operations Battalion and valued his service commitment to his country. He received an Honorable discharge in 1972 and attained the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n\nAfter, Vietnam he returned to New York to be reunited with his family. He did odd jobs including driving taxi cabs until he was hired to work for the Unites States Postal Service later in 1972 as a TTO (tractor trailer operator). He delivered bulk mail throughout the city of New York’s main distribution centers. He worked for USPS until the mid-90’s and spent a few years at JFK airport in Security.\n\nDuring the 90’s he met Stephanie Elder who had a young son Craig. Their relationship blossomed into a loving marriage where they welcomed a baby girl, Kyra. Together they enjoyed traveling around New York; boat rides; trips to Atlantic City and playing cards with friends and family. They were blessed to enjoy a beautiful relationship for 15yrs until Stephanie’s death. After his wife’s death Nate and Kyra moved to Maryland to be closer to family that migrated from Brooklyn to Prince George’s County.\n\nTo know him, was to love him. No matter his approach or delivery, Nate was a fun loving and authentic father/father in-law, grandfather, husband, brother, uncle, son & friend. He was unapologetically Nate, in every way. He loved to have a good time and enjoyed being the center of attention. Often referred to as “The Mayor”, he commanded attention in every setting whether it was a field trip to the grocery store, the VA hospital or the local package store. He was well known and welcomed because he made people love him for who he was, no excuses. An outing with him was a guarantee for a memorable fun time. The way he died is just like he lived: he wrote his own rules, he fought authority, and he paved his own way. And if you said he couldn’t do it, he would make sure he could.\n\nNate loved sports and equally loved music and cooking. He often could be found watching his favorite New York teams and cooking dinner…sipping his “Santa Claus”, blasting the stereo, yelling at the TV and dancing while shaking his tambourine, all at once. Ciroc vodka and Corona beer companies are devastated by the loss of Nate. At least 3 times a month he would make an announcement “I’m making beans” which meant bring your Tupperware! He made the BEST pot of any beans and cornbread.\n\nNate took extreme pride in his four daughters and his grandchildren and loved attending their sporting events and other school activities. He also had a special relationship with his nephew Collin who often spent Sundays at Nate’s house on the grill yelling at the TV with him.\n\nOf all the people he touched, both willing and unwilling, his most proud achievement later in life was purchasing his first home at the age of 71.\n\nNate was preceded in death by his wife Stephanie Lewis; his father William Henry Lewis and by his brothers Edward (Vern) Lewis and Rudolph Lewis. He is survived by his Mother Mable Lee Lewis; his daughters Yvette Lewis; Elisha Jordan (Ka-El); Evonda Johnson (Lamar) and Kyra Lewis. His stepson: Craig Frazier (Cookie). Brother: Willie Lewis (Beth). Sisters: Gloria Duncan; Dorothy King Curry; Brenda Lewis and Marlene Nurse (Rian). Sister In-Laws: Michelle Gillead Lewis and Annette Lewis. Brother In-Law Collin King Sr. Grandchildren: Aniya Lewis; Taylor Johnson; Ellis Johnson; Ka-Lyn Jordan; London Jordan; Craig Frazier Jr.; Jalyn Frazier & Aria Frazier. A special nephew Collin King Jr; like a son in-law Robert Gibbs Jr. & like a grandson in-law Ernest Oshokoya. A host of nieces, nephews, great nieces; great nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins and friends.\n\nNate left this world on Sunday October 2, 2022, at the age of 73. Moses is said to have passed away on his 120th birthday. Chasidic masters in Judaism share that life is a mission God gives you that begins and ends on your birthday. Dying on your birthday therefore indicates you have completed your God-given earthly mission."
