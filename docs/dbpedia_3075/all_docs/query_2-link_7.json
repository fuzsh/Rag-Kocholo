        "text": "The Duke of Duval was a man also known as George Parr. For decades, he ran Duval County in place of John Cleary; after Cleary was murdered in 1907. He inherited the place from his father, also known as Archie Parr, who was the very first Duke of Duval. Parr was a traveling cowboy before he became a powerful politician and started running the county. Archie, his father, provided jobs, both existent and nonexistent, to unemployed civilians of Duval County. The “phantom” employees were paid whether they worked or not and they remained forever thankful to the Duke. George took over the role after it was passed on to him and grew the system of Boss Rule very much. He took over elections and approached as many funds as he needed to get what he wanted, whether it was for the county or for himself. Those who didn’t agree with his ways ended up suspiciously dead, which appeared to be a tradition in his family. Always willing to help the county run smoothly, he would take the place of sheriff or county judge when it was needed. He even got to hold public office after serving time for tax evasion in 1934, and was required to presidential pardon from Harry Truman in 1946.\n\nParis 1919 the six months that changed the world, is a novel written by Margaret McMillan that gives the reader an insight into the post war peace conferences that took place in Paris, France. The book is written so that McMillian is giving the reader the details and the reader must follow along with her. McMillan makes it a habit to often pull from sources and provide direct quotes that were spoken during the conference. The book’s main subject is of the peace conferences but it also tells of events that occurred before and after the war. Mcmillan is not stranger to writing as she has written many other historical novels and is highly decorated with awards presented to her for her writings. She serves as a historian as well a professor at\n\n“John Duke was a distinguished composer, pianist, and teacher of piano. He is best known for his art-songs in English, which were composed between 1920 and his death in 1984. His works also include solo instrumental pieces, instrumental and vocal chamber music, choral and symphonic works, and music for the stage. He composed two operas (\"Captain Lovelock,\" 1953; \"The Sire de Maletroit,\" 1958), an operetta (\"The Yankee Pedlar,\" 1962), a \"musical fantasy for children\" (\"The Cat That Walked Himself\": 1964), and music for numerous Smith College faculty shows and theatre department productions. He was born in Cumberland, Maryland, on July 30, 1899. He became interested in music through his mother, Matilda Hoffman Duke. At age 16 he won a three-year\n\nIt documented that New Orleans is the city that gave birth to Jazz. The deeper one dives into this there are more arguments that can claim one or the other city of its jazz origin. New Orleans traditions keep many of the early customs thriving and as a novice it would be hard to challenge this without being open minded to see what each city has own historical references. The city of New Orleans has a wide culture of all races and was a natural setting for the music of West Africa and Europe to converge. Storyville was a part of New Orleans where early jazz developed and continued to thrive until 1917. Depending on the point of view or where ones allegiance falls based on the style of music is preferred others say jazz came directly to Chicago’s 12th Street station from the Illinois Central Railroad with the slaves. Part of the mass movement of African Americans from South to North is what came to be called “The Great Migration” and musicians came north for the same others did the demand for factory jobs and decent money to support the craft. Chicago had major musical talent as well before Storyville closed and sheet music featuring the Pekin Theater dates from 1904. According to the Chicago defender, Erskine Tate played his violin in Chicago in 1910 and Wilbur Sweatman was in Chicago playing clarinet in 1906.\n\nThe Marquis de Lafayette is best remembered for the part he played in the American War of Independence. He contributed in helping the Americans gain free control over the colonies by breaking away from British home rule. For sixty years he fought with consistency and insight for political ideals and social reforms that have dominated the history of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Hence, Lafayette can be attributed to the spreading of liberty and freedom throughout America and France. Therefore, he is viewed as a symbol of liberalism in a once absolutist world.\n\nBy the late 1920’s Duke was performing in Broadway nightclubs and made hundreds of recordings with his bands, as well as preforming in films and on the radio. Duke’s fame rose to the rafters in the 1940’s when he composed several works including “Concerto for Cootie,” “Cotton Tail” and “Ko-Ko”. Duke’s most famous jazz tune was “Take the A Train”. It was Ellington’s sense of musical drama that people loved so much. Duke brought a level of style and sophistication to Jazz that it had not seen\n\nJazz is consider one of the most influential types of music an America History. Some of the greatest artist in the world have contribute to the success jazz have had not only on America History but throughout the world. This paper will explain the history of jazz, where it all came from and the effect it has had on the America Culture.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique art form know as Jazz, was able to thrive initially in New Orleans. The most celebrated part of New Orleans was known as Storyville because it was a melting pot for Jazz. Storyville was so celebrated because it was the only region in the city that had brothels and pubs that allowed African Americans. Unfortunately, in 1970, President Roosevelt shut down the district in fear of violence between the natives and sailors. This resulted in a dispersion of jazz. Many artists traveled directly to Chicago after the closing of Storyville to restart their music.\n\nAfrican Americans were responsible for bringing jazz music to Europe. Due to the fact that the people in Paris were far more excepting of colored people, many African American singer and dancers made their way to Paris to start their careers and a make a name for themselves. There are few cities in the world that are more associated with jazz than Paris (Pelzer). Most of the time, African American’s in Paris were just looked at by Parisians as entertainers (Stovall). These African American were objects of Parisian curiosity and fantasy, and the audiences were very much intrigued by the exoticism that went into so many performances. These foreign entertainers became the backbones of the Paris Jazz Age (Pelzer)."
