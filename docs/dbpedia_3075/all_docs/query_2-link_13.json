        "text": "AUTUMN IN NEW YORK\n\nlyrics by Vernon Duke\n\nAutumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?\n\nAutumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first knighting\n\nGlittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel\n\nThey’re making me feel, I’m home\n\nIts autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love\n\nAutumn in New York is often mingled with pain\n\nDreamers with empty hands, may sigh for exotic lands\n\nIt’s autumn in New York, its good to live it again\n\nAutumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown\n\nAutumn in New York, it lifts you up when you’re run down\n\nJaded roués and gay divorcées who lunch at the Ritz\n\nWill tell you that it’s divine\n\nThis autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair\n\nAutumn in New York, you’ll need no castle in Spain\n\nLovers that bless the dark on benches in Central Park\n\nGreet autumn in New York, its good to live it again\n\nABOUT THE SONG (from Wikipedia.org): Vernon Duke composed the jazz standard “Autumn in New York” for the Broadway musical Thumbs Up!, which opened on December 27, 1934. Over the years, a wide range of performers have recorded many version of the song, a favorite of jazz performers — including Chet Baker, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan, Louis Armstrong, and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER: Russian-born Vernon Duke (1903 – 1969) was an American composer/songwriter, who also wrote under his original name Vladimir Dukelsky. He is best known for “Taking a Chance on Love” with lyrics by Ted Fetter and John Latouche, “I Can’t Get Started” with lyrics by Ira Gershwin, and “April in Paris” with lyrics by E. Y. (“Yip”) Harburg (1932). He wrote the words and music for “Autumn in New York” (1934). Vernon collaborated with lyricists Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin, Ogden Nash, and others — and his works have been performed and recorded by Count Basie, Bunny Berigan, Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, the Modern Jazz Quartet, André Previn, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis, and many others.
