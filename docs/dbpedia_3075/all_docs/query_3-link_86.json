        "text": "Malibu Pier area in the 1950s\n\nIt was a multifarious delight to see My Hollywood praised in The New York Review of Books, in a wonderful piece by Anahid Nersessian, a professor of English at UCLA, that paired the collection with Adam Kirsch’s own loose (in all but the metrical sense) LA memoir-in-verse, The Discarded Life. Nersessian’s reading is generous and her phrasing is lapidary; she doesn’t groan at my rhymes and detects in my poems an “air of upbeat sorrow,” as well as “an émigré mood, defined by the conviction that things could always be worse.” How true, that last bit. And it gave me special pleasure to see the critic connect this mood to the work of the composer Vernon Duke, né Dukelsky, whose Russophone Angeleno poems I’ve been translating for some time. Not only does Nersessian mention the two I included in the book, “Farmers Market” and “Sunset Strip,” but she also (I could hardly believe my eyes!) quotes from this very blog:\n\nDuke is best known as a songwriter and lyricist who collaborated with Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg, but he also wrote poetry, including the archly titled The Sorrows of Elderly Werther, published in 1962. As Dralyuk explains elsewhere, “The Sorrows includes an entire sequence of poems dedicated to Los Angeles: portraits of a faded movie star on Sunset Blvd., a toothless beatnik in Venice Beach, an old heiress in Beverly Hills, etc.”\n\nThis unexpected appearance inspired me to translate another of Duke’s portraits, which is perhaps the most daring of all. Set in a Malibu bar, the poem depicts a conversation between two men — one older, the other younger — who, by night’s end, leave together. Is what we witness a prelude to an exchange of sexual favors for money? Part of a longstanding arrangement? Is the younger man a part-time “hustler” or a kept man? The questions are left open. I find the poem to be daring not only because it depicts a homosexual liaison, but because the speaker passes little to no judgment on what he sees. If anything, it’s the disparity in age and economic resources between the men that comes in for implicit critique; yet even this disparity is treated as a fact of life. On a humid, fragrant night in Malibu, one man gets what he needs, the other what he desires. Things could be worse.\n\nMalibu\n\nThe fireflies of countless cars\n\nsparkle and die out in a flash;\n\nexhausted fishermen have cleared\n\nthe ocean of its final fish.\n\nNow Malibu is humid, fragrant —\n\na plated slice of cantaloupe.\n\nThe night encloses in its coffin\n\nthe living corpse of daytime hope.\n\nThere’s precious little left for mortals:\n\nwhite snow over a mug of beer,\n\na curious, peculiar torpor,\n\nand waves, monotonous and drear.\n\nTwo at the bar — amid the hubbub,\n\nthey chat as if alone tonight;\n\nTheir trousers are as tight as rubber;\n\ntheir shirts are neat and gleaming white.\n\nOne’s past his prime — passed it by plenty.\n\nHe’s rich, if looks do not deceive.\n\nThe other’s huge, and maybe twenty.\n\nWrestler, perhaps? Soldier on leave?\n\nThe younger one is downing whiskey;\n\nthe older sips Crème de Banane.\n\nThe Californian fog, all frisky,\n\ntickles the eyes as it creeps in.\n\n“How’s tricks, my boy?” “Oh, I’ve been better.\n\nThere isn’t any work these days.\n\n“Yes, so I’ve read. Good luck, dear fellow.”\n\nA second round. “Oh, by the way…\n\nYou got a fiver you can spare?\n\nLandlady’s after me for rent…\n\nI’m waiting on a package there…”\n\nThe old man’s eyes turn sharp, like flint:\n\n“Five dollars isn’t nothing, friend.”\n\nHe pays the bill. “Let’s get some air.\n\nIt’s awful stuffy in this bar.”\n\nThen, slowly and without a care,\n\nthey make their exit, arm in arm.\n\nAnd now consider the fact that Duke’s book appeared in 1962, two years before Christopher Isherwood’s A Single Man, which also works up to a scene of flirtation between two men — one older, the other younger — on a beach in Los Angeles, though it is far more moving than this. Duke’s collection also appeared a year before John Rechy rocked the Anglophone literary establishment with his stream-of-consciousness novel of the hustling lifestyle, City of Night. That novel incorporates the 1959 LGBT uprising at Cooper Do-nuts in Downtown LA, which took place a full decade before Stonewall. Along with the 1967 uprising at The Black Cat Tavern on Sunset Blvd., which is still standing, and the 1968 protest at The Patch on PCH in Wilmington, the Cooper Do-nuts “riot” paved the way for the Pride movement on the West Coast. The people who frequented these establishments were fed up with constant police harassment, which targeted the patrons of other bars as well. Among those bars was Johnny Frenchman’s at 18756 Malibu Road, and I wonder whether that might not be the setting for Duke’s poem. Regardless of the exact location, the poem also reminds me of Charles Gullans’s sequence of SoCal bar poems, collected in Letter from Los Angeles (1990). Gullans, who was a professor of English at UCLA decades before Nersessian joined the department, wrote with disarming candor about the experience of being an older gay man in the land of eternal youth. In one such poem, he considers speaking to some handsome young people but reconsiders:\n\nBecause it is my past; and they are locked\n\nWithin a future I can never reach.\n\nWhat would I say to them or they to me?\n\nI have no wisdom that they need as yet.\n\nThough I am out of place by twenty years,\n\nThere is some pleasure in my sitting here,\n\nWatching the young and beautiful at play.\n\nGolden children, all the long afternoon,\n\nTill diamond chips sift down the evening sky.\n\nMalibu"
