I have a dear uncle who was like a father to me and about whom I can hardly bear to think because I have a horror that he may not have accepted Christ before he died, even though the Gospel had been clearly presented to him. Nevertheless, this is doctrine which needs to be expounded because we live in a day when almost everyone thinks they are going to heaven (or some alternative thereof) when they die. So we need to look at what the Bible says about life after death and the doctrine of eternal punishment or Hell.\n\nSolomon's words would be apropos as we ponder the sobering truths about the eternal destiny of all who reject the gift of eternal life and refuse to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ...\n\n\"The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, That one may avoid the snares of death.\" (Proverbs 14:27)\n\nJ I Packer on preaching hell - To announce the reality of hell is a testing and grueling task. The compassion and fellow-feeling that should mark all Christian communicators require us to do it, not with gloating and contempt, but with tears, if not in our eyes, then in our hearts. Any appearance of off-handness in our manner will surely discredit our matter, just because it discredits us as human beings. It is hard to take seriously a message from a messenger who does not appear to take it seriously himself, or at any rate not to feel about it as a good man should. R. W. Dale once said that D. L. Moody had a right to preach about hell because he so clearly did so from a weeping heart.\n\nTo quote Francis Chan \"As we roll up our sleeves and dig into the topic of hell, it’s important that you don’t distance what the Bible says from reality. In other words, don’t forget that the doctrine you are studying may be the destiny of many people. Hell should not be studied without tearful prayer. We must weep, pray, and fast over this issue, begging God to reveal to us through His Word the truth about hell. Because we can’t be wrong on this one.\" (Erasing Hell)\n\nWatch Francis Chan's video on Erasing Hell.\n\nOne of the primary goals of this study is to review the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ regarding eternal punishment for He spoke more about this sobering subject than anyone else in the Bible. Note however that there will no attempt to make this study an all inclusive discussion of Hell which is one reason a number of other resources are listed.\n\nAnd since Eternal Punishment is such a solemn subject, perhaps a bit of humor might be in order - A business was opening a new store, and a friend of the owner sent flowers for the occasion. The flowers arrived at the new business site, and the owner read the card, inscribed “Rest in Peace.” The angry owner called the florist to complain. After he told the florist of the obvious mistake and how angry he was, the florist said, “Sir, I’m really sorry for the mistake, but rather than getting angry, you should imagine this: Somewhere there is a funeral taking place today, and they have flowers with a note that reads, “Congratulations on your new location.”\n\nDIGRESSION ON \"ETERNAL\"\n\nTHE GREEK WORD AIONIOS\n\nADDENDUM: Since this article has generated negative critical feedback from universalists, those who hold to the unbiblical belief that every soul ever born will be saved and saved forever, I have been prompted to add a short note at the beginning because a universalist will not likely read the entire article. Much could be said, but the essence of the truth stands or falls on one word.\n\nWhat does the word eternal (aionios) mean as it is used in Scripture, NOT as it is used by secular writers, including ancient Greek writers? Thankfully, God's Spirit has used the word aionios numerous times so one may glean an excellent sense of what this word means in the Bible. Can you find Greek \"authorities\" who say aionios does not mean eternal? Absolutely, but every man that claims to be an \"authority\" on this word is also a sinner and his words are not inspired by God, and thus are fallible and subject to error (they are not inerrant)! Only God's Word is inspired by the Spirit of God (Who is the Spirit of Truth). Only God's Word is infallible. Only God's Word is inerrant. Therefore whatever God says on ANY subject is absolute truth, and takes absolute precedence over how the same word was used in the writings of fallen men. That said, here is what the GOD OF TRUTH SAYS about the crucial word ETERNAL (aionios) (And these are only a few examples to make the point).\n\nMatthew 25:41 (WORDS OF JESUS) “Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal (aionios) fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;\n\nCOMMENT - Jesus clearly states those on His left are to depart into the \"ETERNAL FIRE.\" So Jesus believes in an ETERNAL FIRE. Is that a fair statement based on His own declaration? Secondly, Jesus states this ETERNAL FIRE is a place which has been prepared for the DEVIL. So that begs a question -- If ETERNAL FIRE is not real, then will the devil be let out of that place at some point in the future? Clearly there is no Scripture that supports that premise. In fact John records the devil's fate in Revelation 20:10+ \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" How long will the devil be tormented according to John? These passages strongly support the premise that eternal fire will last forever, throughout eternity.\n\nMatthew 25:46 (WORDS OF JESUS) “These will go away into eternal (aionios) punishment, but the righteous into eternal (aionios) life.”\n\nCOMMENT - What is Jesus contrasting? Eternal punishment and eternal life. Correct? According to Jesus how long is life? Eternal. According to Jesus how long is punishment? Eternal. One can parse Jesus' words or attempt specious, clever word games, but His words are very simple and straightforward and clearly indicate that there are two states of every man ever born, either eternal punishment or eternal life. There is no middle ground. And if one argues that aionios does not mean \"eternal\" than they are painting themselves into a theological corner, because if eternal punishment is not forever, then eternal life is not forever and we are all in a hopeless situation!\n\nPaul uses aionos to describe the nature of God writing\n\nbut now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal (aionios) God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith. (Ro 16:26)\n\nCOMMENT - If aionios does not mean eternal, then one is forced to say from this passage that God will not exist forever, which of course is absolutely absurd. Aionios in this context clearly means eternal, everlasting, forever and ever. Amen!\n\nPaul again uses aionos in a description of one aspect of God writing\n\nWho (GOD) Alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, Whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal (aionios) dominion! Amen. (1 Ti 6:16)\n\nCOMMENT - Paul is blessing God and ascribing to Him eternal dominion. Dominion is kratos which refers to inherent strength which displays itself in the rule over others. It follows that if God's kratos is not eternal, at some point He will not have the strength to rule. Again this is clearly not true or otherwise we are all left without any hope of eternal life. Again, it is clear that aionios in this context means eternal, everlasting, forever, without end!\n\nThe writer of Hebrews uses aionos in a description of God the Spirit writing\n\nhow much more will the blood of Christ, Who through the eternal (aionios)Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Hebrews 9:14)\n\nCOMMENT - Once again, if one proposes that aionios does not mean eternal, then they are forced to conclude that the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, will not exist forever. Again such logic is not logic, but lies. Eternal means forever and ever. Amen.\n\nIf we let the Bible be our plumbline regarding the meaning of the Greek word aionios, then clearly the Biblical uses of this word indicates the meaning is forever, without end, eternal. And while it is not my favorite theological truth, it is clear from the Word of God that there will be eternal punishment for every soul that does not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ while they still have breath in their lungs and a beat in their heart. Do not believe the lie of Satan, \"You surely will not die.\" (Ge 3:4+)! Today is the acceptable time. Today is the day of salvation. (2 Cor 6:2) Believe the truth spoken by Jesus, Who Alone is the Way, the Truth and the Life (John 14:6) and Who Alone has the words of eternal (aionios) life (John 6:68)\n\nHere are a few of the blessed, hope filled words of Jesus regarding ETERNAL LIFE -\n\n“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal (aionios) life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. (John 5:24)\n\n“For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal (aionios) life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.” (John 6:40)\n\n“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal (aionios) life. (John 6:47)\n\n“This is eternal (aionios) life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom You have sent. (John 17:3)\n\nFinally, here is one example of the use of aionios in the Septuagint (Lxx), the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament and a version frequently quoted by the New Testament writers. The passage in question is Genesis 21:33 in which Abraham gives us another glorious Name for God.\n\nAbraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God (see study of El Olam: Everlasting God).\n\nCOMMENT - The Hebrew word for Everlasting is olam which is translated by aionios. Once again those who would seek to distort or pervert the Biblical meaning of aionios as meaning something other than eternal have a major problem! They have to directly refute the inspired Word from God Himself. He is saying that He is the Eternal God. There is simply no other way to interpret what He says about Himself. It follows that if \"eternal\" (aionios) does not mean eternal, then either God is confused or He is a liar, and of course He is neither (1 Cor 14:33, Nu 23:19, Titus 1:2+). He is the absolute Essence of Truth. Beloved, it could not be more clearly stated that God is eternal and hallelujah, those who are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ will experience eternal life with Him in His glorious presence. But tragically and sadly, those who refuse to believe in Jesus will experience eternal death and \"will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.\" (2 Th 1:9) Dear reader, if you have not yet placed your faith in the Messiah, the Lamb of God Who (Alone) takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29+), then do not put off this \"decision of a lifetime,\" one that will immediately result in your being rescued from the domain of darkness and transferred (Col 1:13+) from the prospect of eternal death to the hope and certainty of eternal life in Christ. May the Spirit of God draw you and grant you the grace to believe in Jesus Christ, \"the Everlasting (Hebrew = olam; Lxx = aionios) God, the LORD, the Creator (Heb 1:2+, Jn 1:3+, Col 1:16+) of the ends of the earth.\" (Isaiah 40:28) Amen\n\nHELL HAS FALLEN\n\nON \"HARD TIMES\"\n\nThe doctrine of eternal punishment, though unpopular and frightening, is part of the Apostles’ Creed which said that “He descended into hell [meaning Hades not Gehenna].”. Erwin Lutzer writes \"Hell disappeared. And no one noticed.” With that terse observation, American church historian Martin Marty summarized our attitude toward a vanishing doctrine that received careful attention in previous generations. If you are a churchgoer, ask yourself when you last heard an entire sermon or Sunday school lesson on the topic. An article in Newsweek said, “Today, hell is theology’s H-word, a subject too trite for serious scholarship.” Gordon Kaufman of Harvard Divinity School believes we have gone through a transformation of ideas, and he says, “I don’t think there can be any future for heaven and hell.”Admittedly, hell is an unpleasant topic. Unbelievers disbelieve in it; most Christians ignore it. Even the staunchly biblical diehards are often silent out of embarrassment. Hell, more than any doctrine of the Bible, seems to be out of step with our times. \" (Ibid)\n\nJohn Blanchard in his fascinating book Whatever Happened to Hell? writes \"Hell seems to have fallen on hard times. A poll taken in the United States in 1978 revealed that over seventy per cent of those interviewed said they believed in hell. Eleven years later a Newsweek survey, again taken in the United States, produced a figure of just fifty-eight per cent. A poll conducted in Australia in 1988 indicated that only thirty-nine per cent believed in hell, while in 1989 a Gallup Poll taken in Britain for the Sunday Telegraph revealed that no more than twenty-four per cent of those questioned did so.\"\n\nChristopher Morgan - If we believe the message sent by the contemporary media, the “new location” of everyone who dies is heaven. At first glance, popular polls seem to disagree with that conclusion, for they reveal that a large majority of Americans believe in the existence of hell. However, the same polls show that almost no one thinks that he or she is going there. Everyone hopes for heaven. (Hell Under Fire - see review from DTS)\n\nWhen the American church historian Martin Marty, a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School, was preparing a Harvard lecture on the subject, he consulted the indexes of several scholarly journals dating back over a period of a hundred years to 1889, and failed to find a single entry. His conclusion was that ‘Hell disappeared and no one noticed.’ (Cited in Newsweek, 27 March 1989.)\n\nAlbert Moehler - A fixture of Christian theology for over sixteen centuries, hell went away in a hurry. The abandonment of the traditional doctrine of hell came swiftly, with centuries of Christian conviction quickly swept away in a rush of modern thought and doctrinal transformation. Historian Martin Marty reduced the situation down to this: “Hell disappeared. No one noticed.”\"...The traditional doctrine of hell now bears the mark of odium theologium—a doctrine retained only by the most stalwart defenders of conservative theology, Catholic and Protestant. Its defenders are seemingly few. The doctrine is routinely dismissed as an embarrassing artifact from an ancient age—a reminder of Christianity’s rejected worldview. (From Chapter 1 of the book \"Hell Under Fire\" -- I suppose they intended a pun!)\n\nChristopher Morgan - On October 24, 2003, the Los Angeles Times ran an article called “Next Stop, the Pearly Gates or Hell?” It reported a survey conducted by the Barna Research Group. The September 2003 survey polled people from every state but Hawaii and Alaska to discover their beliefs about heaven and hell. The poll found that 76 percent of Americans believe in a heaven and that 71 percent believe in a hell. The results were a bit surprising: according to the poll, almost as many Americans said they believe in hell as in heaven. But more telling was the fact that, although more than seven out of ten Americans believe in some sort of hell, fewer than one out of a hundred think they have a good chance of going there! These findings are similar to those described in a 1991 cover story of U.S. News & World Report. Its 1990 poll found that 60 percent of Americans said they believed in some sort of hell, but that only 4 percent considered themselves to have a good chance of going there. What are we to make of this? Polls are difficult to analyze, but if these are accurate, more Americans believed in hell in 2003 than in 1990. Yet fewer of them believed that they themselves might go to hell. Evidently, most Americans conclude that God will punish at least some sinners, but few include themselves in that group. Maybe the idea is that hell exists only for extremely evil people—such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, serial killers, and serial rapists. (What is Hell? - Basics of the Faith)\n\nIn his sermon entitled A Forgotten Doctrine: The Wrath of God Ray Pritchard explains that \"Sometimes the title tells the whole story. My sermon today is about the wrath of God. It is truly a forgotten doctrine, even in the evangelical church. I'll dare say that many of you have never heard a sermon on God's wrath—that is, not a full sermon devoted to this one topic. The reasons for this apparent neglect are not hard to find. Most of us would rather hear about love and grace. I know I would rather preach about God's grace. After all, to speak of the wrath of God makes us appear narrow-minded, judgmental, and God help us, fundamentalist. In an enlightened community like Oak Park, those aren't popular adjectives. And on another level, God's wrath is difficult to comprehend, so in some ways, this is a doctrine that is easy to overlook. The thought that nice people we know might someday go to eternal hell is so overwhelming—and so disheartening—that we'd much rather not think about it at all.Many Christians feel as if they have to apologize for this doctrine. Some think it a blemish on God's character. Others think that God's wrath is inconsistent with his love. Perhaps if you brought a friend this morning, you feel you need to say a word of apology after the sermon is over. Please don't! There is no need to apologize for God's Word so long as it is fairly and graciously presented. And I intend to be both fair and gracious in what I have to say. Let us then consider the words of J. I. Packer: The fact is that the subject of divine wrath has become taboo in modern society, and Christians by and large have accepted the taboo and conditioned themselves never to raise the matter (Borrow Knowing God, p. 149).\"\n\nDavid Lodge postulates that \"At some point in the nineteen-sixties, Hell disappeared. No one could say for certain when this happened. First it was there, then it wasn’t. Different people became aware of the disappearance of Hell at different times. Some realized that they had been living for years as though Hell did not exist, without having consciously registered its disappearance. Others realized that they had been behaving, out of habit, as though Hell were still there, though in fact they had ceased to believe in its existence long ago.… On the whole, the disappearance of Hell was a great relief, though it brought new problems.\" ( Souls and Bodies)\n\nGordon Kaufman, a professor at Harvard Divinity School, says that hell has been in decline for 400 years and is now so diminished that the process is irreversible: ‘I don’t think there can be any future for hell.’\n\nAnother theologian says, ‘Talk of hell started to fall off in western countries about the same time science began to make an impact, about the late nineteenth century.’ (The Bulletin, 24 May 1988.)\n\nRichard Cavendish, author of Visions of Heaven and Hell, commented, ‘In our century there has been a kind of double development. We have created hells on earth on a bigger scale and perhaps of a more horrible kind than any previous century has done. Yet there has been a very general retreat from the idea of hell.’\n\nThe question arises as to why has hell suffered such a decline in \"popularity?\"\n\n(1) Of course, the most obvious answer is that hell is not a fun subject on which to preach or teach. The thought of someone we know undergoing eternal punishment is almost too much to bear.\n\nRick Holland - In Sunday sermons, preachers must not neglect preaching on the horrors of hell and the catastrophic consequence of rejecting Christ. When you abandon preaching on hell, you ignore the accent in the Epistles on the coming judgment, you will need to skip large portions of Jesus’ teaching in the Gospels, and you might as well rip Revelation out of your Bible. Some neglect to teach on hell, while others minimize the torments of hell. Underestimating the reality of hell leads to a belief in a kind of purgatory where a second chance after death is expected, thereby making people think that there is plenty of time to “get right with God.” Hell is physical pain, loneliness, darkness that accentuates fear, regret, separation from God, and the absence of a second chance. God sends us as His ambassadors to beg people to be reconciled to Him. Do not be misled; the reality of hell is essential to preaching the gospel message. (Quoted in Evangelism: How to Share the Gospel Faithfully).\n\n(2) Another answer is that some of the decline in preaching and teaching on hell reflects the horrible non-Biblical descriptions by some writers and preachers. For example, Venerable Bede described a man in hell with \"flames of fire gushed out from his ears and eyes and nostrils and at every pore.\" And so because of these type of non-Biblical descriptions of Hell, the tendency is to draw back from even bringing up the subject.\n\n(3) Attacks on the historic doctrine of hell that used to come from outside the church are now coming from within, from such well known evangelical theologians as Clark Pinnock, Philip Edgcombe Hughes,John Wenham, Basil Atkinson. In 1988, the prominent evangelical John Stott constructed an argument for annihilationism. (Richard Mayhue's rebuttal - Hell: Never, Forever, or Just for Awhile)\n\nIt is interesting that the secular world pays far more attention to hell than does the church! So while sermons and teaching on hell have declined over the past 100 years (see note below), the use of the word hell itself has significantly increased as shown below in the Google chart of the frequency of usage of hell over time. And keep in mind that the higher usages in the 1800's reflect a greater usage in a religious compared to our day. I was very surprised to see the rather striking increase in popularity of the word hell, but then I began to understand that clearly this reflects a major decline in the morals of Americans, so that hell is used glibly and tritely on shows and literature, and even by a President of the United States who sadly uses the word Hell with regularity and seemingly without a hint of compunction! (cf the effect of \"leaders\" in Jdg 5:2NLT-note) Woe!\n\nMacArthur adds that 'Unbelievers flippantly (idea of inappropriate levity) and frequently tell people to go to hell. Unbelievers don not seem to have any hesitation to talk about hell and to verbally threaten people with it, but on the other hand the church is reluctant to warn people NOT to go to hell! The church avoids hell ostensibly out of love, compassion, concern and a desire to be accepted by unbelievers. So while unbelievers frequently have the word hell on their lips, believers rarely have it on theirs, but it is the fearfulness and horror of hell that is exactly the point of its Biblical revelation. God's purpose in telling us about hell with such detail and repetition is to produce in sinners a sense of fear, terror, and even panic. In other words, the truth of hell is taught in Scripture to frighten and horrify unbelievers, so as to produce in them a fear of spending forever in hell (cf Jesus' words in Mt 10:28), a fear which in turn drives them in the direction of repentance and faith in the Gospel. (A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 2)\n\nHomer Simpson said, “I’m not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I’m going to hell?” (One wonders which church he is referring to as few churches preach on this topic!) See the Simpson's absurd trivialization of Hell where he says \"I'd sell my soul for a donut!\" Is it any wonder that our culture laughs away the doctrine of Hell as if it were a joke!\n\nJohn Lennon was sadly mistaken when he wrote a popular song in the 1970’s called \"Imagine\". What if the Biblical pictures of hell as a place of endless punishment and suffering are true? Sadly I don't think John Lennon has to imagine today!\n\nImagine there's no heaven\n\nIt's easy if you try\n\nNo hell below us\n\nAbove us only sky\n\nImagine all the people living for today.\n\nUSAGE OF THE WORD\n\n\"HELL\" OVER TIME\n\nOur society is now using the word \"Hell\" so frequently and flippantly that the majority of people (even believers) have in effect become \"desensitized\" to the true meaning of the word as used in the Bible! The subterfuge of Satan surely has some part in this \"cover up!\" This reminds me of Screwtape's advice to his protege \"Keep everything hazy in his mind now (in context this refers primarily to the church), and you will have all eternity wherein to amuse yourself by producing in him the peculiar kind of clarity which Hell affords.Keep everything hazy in his mind now, and you will have all eternity wherein to amuse yourself by producing in him the peculiar kind of clarity which Hell affords.\" Uncle Screwtape in letter 12 to Wormwood adds \"Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one — the gentle slope, soft underfoot without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts, Your affectionate uncle Screwtape .\" Uncle Screwtape goes on to tell Wormwood \"Your man may be untroubled about the Future, not because he is concerned with the Present, but because he has persuaded himself that the Future is going to be agreeable. (ED: SURVEYS CONFIRM MOST AMERICANS THINK THEY WILL GO TO HEAVEN WHEN THEY DIE WITH FEW THINKING THEY ARE DOOMED FOR ETERNAL PUNISHMENT! SADLY AND TRAGICALLY UNCLE SCREWTAPE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL!) As long as that is the real course of his tranquility, his tranquility will do us good, because it is only piling up more disappointment, and therefore more impatience, for him when his false hopes are dashed. If, on the other hand, he is aware that horrors may be in store for him (REFERRING TO HELL) and is praying for the virtues, wherewith to meet them, and meanwhile concerning himself with the Present because there, and there alone, all duty, all grace, all knowledge, and all pleasure dwell, his state is very undesirable and should be attacked at once. Here again, our Philological Arm has done good work; try the word “complacency” on him. But, of course, it is most likely that he is “living in the Present” for none of these reasons but simply because his health is good and he is enjoying his work. The phenomenon would then be merely natural. All the same, I should break it up if I were you. No natural phenomenon is really in our favour. And anyway, why should the creature be happy? Your affectionate uncle Screwtape (C S Lewis - Screwtape Letters or borrow book)\n\nI was shocked when I searched for \"Idioms of Hell\" and encountered over 100 common phrases that use the word Hell in essentially \"R rated\" idioms (click here at your own risk) which are now accepted as common parlance in our increasing amoral (\"ethically indifferent\") society. This proliferation of idioms undoubtedly contributes to the upward slope in the use of \"Hell\" in 2010 as depicted above.\n\nAn old Puritan writer had a good antidote for modern malaise concerning hell \"Meditate much on hell. Let us go into hell by contemplation that we may not go into hell by condemnation! (see complete devotional)\n\nIn his book The Doctrine of Eternal Punishment, Harry Buis writes \"That keen European thinker Berdyaev says, \"It is remarkable how little people think about hell or trouble about it. This is the most striking evidence of human frivolity.\" Schilder makes a similar and more detailed analysis of the situation when he says, \"What is hell? When you place this question before the modern cosmopolitan man of our day, who is satiated with hyper-culture, then his answer is ready: Hell is a figment of the imagination! Hell? Well, this shadowy frightfulness which is implied in the word, as man says, can't be anything other than a notion of founders of religions and of priests and lying prophets, wherewith they deceive the masses, and the world which wants to be deluded, in order to fill their empty pockets in this life with the preaching of the total emptying of the sinner in the hereafter...they tell you bluntly, that the world doesn't believe any more in hell.\" (Preface)\n\nTo summarize, this parable is about 2 men, a poor man who goes to heaven and a rich man who goes to hell. And note that most of the text in Lk 16:19-31 focuses on the fate of the rich man with only minimal attention being given to the poor man. Clearly, the purpose of this parable is to serve as a warning to the rich Pharisees and all of their ilk who also are deceived and hold the false belief that they are going to heaven when they die but instead will find themselves in hell! Jesus knows this is not a comfortable subject to address, but He also knows it is absolutely necessary so that men might understand the grave danger they are in when they reject Him and refuse to believe His Gospel. As horrible as this subject is to talk about, it is sorely needed that it might cause all readers to contemplate their eternal destiny and to repent and believe in Jesus while today is still called today (cf Heb 3:13). It is only fitting that the Lord Jesus Christ Who is the Judge of the living (born again believers) and the dead (unregenerate) (2 Ti 4:1), is the One Who to give this parable two men and two destinies.\n\nJesus employed the most graphic language to describe what hell is like: fire (Mt 5:22; Mt 18:9); eternal fire (Mt 18:8); destruction (Mt 7:13); away from his presence (Mt 7:23); thrown outside (Mt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30); blazing furnace (Mt 13:42); darkness (Mt 22:13; 25:30); eternal punishment (Mt 25:46); weeping and gnashing of teeth (Mt 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; 22:13; 24:51). Jesus twice used the word eternal (Mt 18:8; 25:46) to convey that the punishment of nonbelievers would continue forever.\n\nJohn MacArthur says that Luke 16:19-31 \"Could be called “The Great Reversal”, “A Reluctant Witness From Hell,” “How to Think You’re Going to Heaven and End Up In Hell.” Most people in the Western world who have had exposure to Christianity, think they are going to Heaven; and that is largely affirmed by clergymen and religious leaders. (A recent survey revealed that virtually all the people who believe in heaven also believe they will go there - Gallup poll survey, 10-13 May 2007) I’m quite sure that hell is populated mostly with people who are shocked to find themselves there. People typically answer the question, “Are you going to Heaven?” with, “Well, I’m a good person. I’m a religious person. I believe in God. I believe in Jesus. I’m going to Heaven. God certainly wouldn’t send me to hell.” Hell is full of surprised people. That’s really what this story is about—a rich man who was shocked to find himself in hell. Equally shocking to those who listened to the story was the idea that the poor man was in Heaven. This was contrary to all expectations.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nPie Chart surveys on \"Who Can Go to Heaven,\"\n\nAnother survey;\n\nSurvey of belief in God;\n\nHeaven and hell;\n\n2014 Pew poll on heaven/hell\n\nWhy is the idea of eternal damnation so repulsive to many people?\n\nMacArthur goes on to give a description of hell - To live life without this hope would make life excruciating and unbearable. But what if everything in your life was as bad as it could be. Take everything bad that has ever happened in your life, roll it all into one experience, and make it permanent. All the pain, all the disappointment, all the failure, all the hatred, all the bitterness, all the fear, all the anxiety, and experience that to the full, and then add the fact that you have no hope. It will never get better. Such knowledge would compound and exacerbate your suffering exponentially. If you were in the severest torture and the most profound, relentless torment physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally, and you were suffering in all those things at the same time and knew there would never be one moment of relief, and that nothing would ever change....I just described hell. It is the place of the most profound suffering, compounded infinitely by the realization that it lasts forever, and nothing will ever change. (A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 1)\n\nAs Rod Mattoon says Jesus' \"story provides great comfort for those who know Christ as their Savior. It should instill terror in your heart if you have never put your faith in Christ because it describes what will happen to you after your death.\"\n\nA recent survey revealed that virtually all the people who believe in heaven also believe they will go there (Gallup poll survey, 10-13 May 2007). Such was the case with the rich man in this story. Both to himself and to others, he would have seemed like a lock for heaven. The Jews believed that riches were a sure sign of God’s blessing. Therefore the more money a man had the greater his blessing from God. When Jesus said to the disciples, “How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!” (Mark 10:23), “the disciples were amazed at His words” (Mk 10:24). And when the Lord “answered again and said to them, ‘Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God’” (Mk 10:24-25) “they were even more astonished and said to Him, ‘Then who can be saved?’” (Mk 10:26), if not the rich. The disciples’ response reflected the common belief of the Jewish people—especially the money-loving (Luke 16:14) Pharisees to whom Jesus directed this story. The rich man symbolizes them, both in their love of money, and in their assumption that their wealth was a sign of God’s favor. Like him (vv. 27-30), the Pharisees demanded signs from Jesus before they would believe. And like him, they would one day be shocked to find themselves in hell. They are tragic examples of those who gained the world, but lost their souls (Mark 8:36). (See The MacArthur New Testament Commentary)\n\nGotquestions - The doctrine of eternal death is not a popular doctrine to teach or proclaim. To do so often opens one up to scorn and ridicule. However, we must not let that detract us from what the Bible so clearly teaches; namely, that due to our being born in sin and trespasses, we are under the just condemnation of God for our sin. If we do not embrace the saving message of Jesus Christ, we will perish in our sin and trespasses and be under God’s just judgment for our sin—eternal death. This is a sobering doctrine and requires the utmost care and compassion in its presentation. (What is Eternal Death?)\n\nTEACHINGS OF JESUS\n\nRELATED TO ETERNAL PUNISHMENT\n\nTimothy Phillips defines Hell as the \"Place of God's final retributive punishment. Scripture progressively develops this destiny of the wicked: the Old Testament outlines the framework, while the New Testament elaborates on it. Jesus, however, is most responsible for defining hell.\" (Hell)\n\nThe doctrine of eternal punishment in hell is not pleasant, but you cannot accept Jesus and reject hell, because He taught it so plainly and frequently. R. C. Sproul wrote (“Tabletalk [11/90]),\n\nThe fact is, however, that virtually every statement in the Bible concerning hell comes from the lips of Jesus Christ. We cannot take Jesus seriously without also taking seriously what He said regarding eternal punishment. There is very little about hell in the Old Testament, and very little in the epistles. It is almost as if God decided that a teaching this frightening would not be received from any lesser authority than that of His own Son.\n\nW.T.G. Shedd agrees that \"The strongest support of the doctrine of Endless Punishment is the teaching of Christ, the Redeemer of man. Though the doctrine is plainly taught in the Pauline Epistles (e.g., 2 Th 1:9), and other parts of Scripture, yet without the explicit and reiterated statements of God incarnate, it is doubtful whether so awful a truth would have had such a conspicuous place as it always has had in the creed of Christendom...The apostles enter far less into detailed description and are far less emphatic upon this solemn theme than their divine Lord and master. And well they might be. For as none but God has the right and would dare to sentence a soul to eternal misery for sin and as none but God has the right and would dare to execute the sentence, so none but God has the right and should presume to delineate the nature and consequences of this sentence. This is the reason why most of the awful imagery in which the sufferings of the lost are described is found in the discourses of our Lord and Savior. He took it upon himself to sound the note of warning. He, the Judge of quick (living) and dead, assumed the responsibility of teaching the doctrine of endless retribution: “I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: Fear him who after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.” “Nothing is more striking to me than our Lord’s own description of the judgment. It is so inexpressibly forcible, coming from his very own lips, as descriptive of what he himself would do” (Stanley, Life of Arnold 1.176). Christ could not have warned men so frequently and earnestly as He did against 'the fire that never shall be quenched,' and 'the worm that dieth not,' had He known that there is no future peril to fully correspond to them. That omniscient Being Who made the statements respecting the Day of Judgment, and the final sentence, that are recorded in Matthew 25:31-46, could neither have believed nor expected that all men without exception will eventually be holy and happy...Jesus Christ is the Person Who is responsible for the doctrine of Eternal Perdition. He is the Being with Whom all opponents of this theological tenet are in conflict. Neither the Christian church, nor the Christian ministry are the authors of it.\" (Dogmatic Theology - Biblical Argument)\n\nDorothy Sayers, gives us a necessary antidote to the tragic abandonment of truth about eternal punishment\n\nThere seems to be a kind of conspiracy, especially among middle-aged writers of vaguely liberal tendency, to forget, or to conceal, where the doctrine of Hell comes from. One finds frequent references to the \"cruel and abominable mediaeval doctrine of hell,\" or \"the childish and grotesque medieval imagery of physical fire and worms.\"...But the case is quite otherwise; let us face the facts. The doctrine of hell is not \" medieval\": it is Christ's. It is not a device of \"mediaeval priestcraft\" for frightening people into giving money to the church: it is Christ's deliberate judgment on sin. The imagery of the undying worm and the unquenchable fire derives, not from \"mediaeval superstition,\" but originally from the Prophet Isaiah, and it was Christ who emphatically used it. . . . It confronts us in the oldest and least \"edited\" of the gospels: it is explicit in many of the most familiar parables and implicit in many more: it bulks far larger in the teaching than one realizes, until one reads the Evangelists [gospels] through instead of picking out the most comfortable texts: one cannot get rid of it without tearing the New Testament to tatters. We cannot repudiate Hell without altogether repudiating Christ. (Borrow Dorothy Sayers, A Matter of Eternity, ed. Rosamond Kent Sprague [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1973], p. 86)\n\nAnd so to study the doctrine of eternal punishment we must listen carefully and prayerfully to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus spoke about Hell in the New Testament as though He actually believed that Hell was real! So let's look at passages from the lips of our Lord which speak of various aspects of eternal punishment\n\nMt 5:22-note “But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell (gehenna).\n\nMacArthur - To call a person a fool is the same as cursing him and murdering him, and to be guilty of that sin is to be worthy of the eternal punishment of fiery hell (gehenna).. (MacArthur New Testament Commentary – Matthew 1-7)\n\nNew American Commentary – Some have seen an increasing severity of judgment as Jesus progresses from the terms “judgment” to “the Sanhedrin” (the Jewish supreme court) to Gehenna (“fire of hell”)—a reference to the valley south of Jerusalem in which children were slaughtered in Old Testament times and traditionally associated with a perpetually burning garbage dump in later centuries. But given the close parallelism among the first clauses of each illustration, the entire sentences should probably be taken as largely synonymous. All three metaphorically refer to the danger of eternal judgment.\n\nSee John MacArthur's related sermons -\n\nMatthew 5:21-26: Who is a Murderer? - Study Guide - click dropdown\n\nMatthew 5:21-26: Who is a Murderer?\n\nMt 5:27-note “You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY’; 28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 “If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell (gehenna)..\n\nComment: Note that Jesus here speaks of the body going into hell, and of its condition there being so terrible that the loss of an eye or a hand for life would be far less severe!\n\nMacDonald: Are we to take Jesus' words literally? Was He actually advocating self-mutilation? The words are literal to this extent: if it were necessary to lose a member rather than one's soul, then we should gladly part with the member. Fortunately it is never necessary, since the Holy Spirit empowers the believer to live a holy life. However, there must be cooperation and rigid discipline on the believer's part.

No one could hear his yells for help. After digging for more than an hour to try to free his bleeding, shattered leg, he hit stone. He would bleed to death unless he did something drastic. Wyman made his decision. Using a wrench and the starter cord from his chain saw as a tourniquet, he cut off the flow of blood to his shin. Somehow he had the fortitude to amputate his own leg below the knee with his pocket knife. He crawled to his vehicle and drove to a farmer's home. The farmer got him the help that saved his life. Like Don Wyman, men who want to follow Christ face tough choices. We have sinful habits we want to keep as badly as our leg. We also have a Lord and Savior who calls us to repent. It takes strength to cut off our wickedness. —Craig Brian Larson\n\nKill The Spider! - We sometimes have mixed feelings about our sins. We are afraid of being hurt by them, and we want to be forgiven. But we aren't sure we want to be rid of them right now. A man told me he has a bad habit that is hindering his fellowship with God and hurting his Christian testimony. He says he prays that God will forgive him for his addiction—but he doesn't stop. He reminds me of the story about the man who often went forward at the end of church services to kneel and pray, \"Lord, take the cobwebs out of my life.\" One Sunday morning his pastor, tired of hearing the same old prayer, knelt beside him and cried out, \"Lord, kill the spider!\" Yes, sometimes it takes radical action to break a sinful habit. We need to do more than ask God for cleansing each time we succumb to temptation. We must take whatever steps are needed to get the cobwebs out of our life. We must confess our sin and determine to be done with it. Then we must feed our mind with God's Word and do all we can to stay away from the people and places that tempt us to sin. That's what Christ meant when He said, \"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out\" (Matthew 5:29).Kill the spider and you'll get rid of the cobwebs.\n\nSee John MacArthur's related sermons - Matthew 5:29-30: Man's Biggest Problem - Study Guide - click dropdown; Matthew 5:29-30: Man's Biggest Problem\n\nMatt. 7:21–23-note “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. 22 (note) “Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ 23 “And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.’\n\nFrancis Chan on Matthew 7 \"probably the scariest passage on hell in the entire Bible? The most horrific word in this passage isn’t hell; it isn’t fire, furnace, everlasting, gloom, darkness, worms, or torment. In fact, none of these words occur in this passage. The most frightening word is many. Jesus says, “Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ ” (Matt. 7:22). This is judgment day. This is the end. There are no second chances. This is the last peaceful breath that “many” will breathe before they spend the rest of their life in hell. Put yourself there for a second. Fast-forward your life to that day. Will you sound like the many who call out in desperation, “Lord, Lord, did I not___ and ___ and ___ in Your name?” How will Jesus respond to your laundry list of Christian activities—your Easter services, tithe, Bible studies, church potlucks, and summer-camp conversions? Are you sure you’re on the right side? What evidence do you have that you know Jesus? Please understand my heart. I believe I am asking these questions for the same reason that Jesus gives the warning. It’s the most loving thing I can do! “Many” will go to hell even though they thought they’d waltz into paradise. Jesus will say, “I never knew you; depart from me” (Matt. 7:23). (Erasing Hell)\n\nAlan Carr gives some statistics on how \"heavenly minded\" America is in his sermon (Not Everyone Gets to Go to Heaven) - You might not think it, but our world is very heavenly minded. That is a strange statement considering just how wretched and wicked our world is, but in a recent CNN poll, it was discovered that 81% of the people asked believed in a literal heaven where people lived with God after death. 81%! 61% of those polled said that they believed they would go to Heaven immediately when they died.

The false teaching of annihilationism is a fabrication of men who refuse to interpret literally the words of our Lord Jesus. That a soul would be completely obliterated in Gehenna, the Lake of Fire, would surely be the desire of any who end up in that horrible place. However the Greek verb Jesus uses for \"destroy\" is apollumi, which DOES NOT signify total annihilation! Instead it means not the loss of being (of one's soul), but the loss of well-being. J I Packer says it is \"the regular Greek word for wrecking and ruining something, so making it useless for its intended purpose.\" Apollumi means that the soul originally created in the image of God is subjected in essence to eternal ruin so that he or she can no longer serve the purpose for which they were created (Westminster Shorter Catechism = \"Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.\")! The body and soul of the damned still exists, but tragically, it is rendered eternally useless! Dear believer, if this doesn't break your heart, I don't know what will! The Gospel promises everlasting life for the one who believes. The failure to possess this life in Christ will result in utter ruin and eternal uselessness, but not cessation of existence! Dear reader, does not this grave (pun intended) truth impel you to want to share the eternally soul saving Gospel of Jesus Christ with EVERYONE you know, with everyone with whom providence brings you into contact! May God's Spirit take this tragic truth of an unbelieving soul's life outside of Christ and use it to embolden us, setting our hearts ablaze to passionately share Jesus with all who will listen. Amen.\n\nSee John MacArthur's related sermons -\n\nMatthew 10:26-31: The Hallmarks of Discipleship 1;\n\nMatthew 10:26-31: The Hallmarks of Discipleship 1 - click dropdown\n\nMt. 11:23 “And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day. 24 “Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.”\n\nComment: Jesus uses the term Hades which was familiar to the Jews. Passages like this one (exalted...descend) lead writers to suggest Heaven is above in the sky and Hell is below in the depths of the earth, but in reality the locations of both places are not known with absolute certainty. Notice the phrase \"it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you\" teaches there will be degrees of judgment in Hell. In determining the degree of punishment in hell, our Lord takes into account the words (Matt. 12:26, 37) and works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 20:11–15+; Rev 22:12) of sinners. The sin of the Pharisees was made greater by their contact with Christ (John 15:22). While the fact of judgment is determined by what we are, i.e., our nature, the degree of punishment is determined on the basis ’of true knowledge we have received and the quality of life that we live (Rom. 2:3–6). The scriptural teaching of degrees of punishment is a solid argument for eternal, conscious torment, According to Christ, some sinners will receive greater torment than others.\n\nSee John MacArthur's related sermon Matthew 11:16-24 Treating Christ with Criticism and Indifference\n\nMt 13:41–42 “The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, 42 and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nOn weeping and gnashing of teeth - See below\n\nMt 13:49–50 (Context Mt 13:47-48) “So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, 50 and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nOn weeping and gnashing of teeth - See below\n\nMacArthur - The parable of the dragnet is a frightening warning about what happens to the wicked when they are separated from the righteous in the last days. Here Jesus gives a vivid picture of judgment, a brief explanation of the principle of judgment, and a sobering warning about the peril of judgment....Hell is not merely the fate of forever reliving bad memories or of going out into nothingness, as many people believe and teach. Nor is it a place where sinners will continue their sinning, unrestrained and unrebuked. There will be no pleasure at all in hell, not even the perverted pleasure of sin-only its punishment.\n\nWhen an interviewer asked a young punk rock singer what she was looking forward to at the end of her career, she replied, “Death. I’m looking forward to death.” When asked why, she said, “I want to go to hell, because hell will be fun.”\n\nSuch deception is tragic beyond words. Nothing could less describe hell than fun. The human mind cannot begin to conceive of the eternal horror that is hell. Even the biblical figures related to hell are only suggestive, because the finite mind cannot comprehend infinite pain and torment any more than it can comprehend infinite joy and bliss. But from God’s Word we learn four basic truths about the furnace of fire that will help us to partially grasp its terror.\n\nFirst, hell is a place of constant torment, misery, pain. The torment is often described as darkness (Matt. 22:13), where no light can penetrate, and nothing can be seen. Throughout the numberless eons of eternity the damned will never again see light or anything that light illumines. Hell’s torment is also described as fire that will never go out and cannot be extinguished (Mark 9:43) and from which the damned will never find relief. Hell could not be other than a place where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nSecond, hell will involve the torment of both body and soul. Neither the soul nor the body is annihilated at death; nor will they ever be. When an unsaved person dies, his soul goes out from the presence of God into everlasting torment. At the resurrection of all the dead, the bodies of the unsaved will be raised, and those resurrected bodies will join the soul in hell’s torment (Matt. 10:28; cf. John 5:29; Acts 24:15; Rev. 20:11–15+). Just as believers will be fitted with resurrected bodies so they can enjoy the glories of heaven forever, unbelievers will be fitted with resurrected bodies so they can endure the torments of hell without being destroyed.\n\nJesus spoke of hell as a place “where their worm does not die” (Mark 9:44). When physical bodies are buried and begin to decay, the worms can attack them only as long as the flesh lasts. Once consumed, the body can experience no more harm. But the resurrected bodies of unbelievers will never be consumed, and the hellish “worms” that feed on them will themselves never die.\n\nThird, the torments of hell will be experienced in varying degrees. For everyone in hell the suffering will be intense and permanent, but some will experience greater torment than others. “Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses,” says the writer of Hebrews. “How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?” (Heb. 10:28–29). Those who willfully reject Jesus Christ and trample, as it were, on the sacrifice He made for them with His own blood will receive much greater punishment than those who had only the light of the Old Covenant. And on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the pagan cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodore than for the Jewish cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum-who not only had the light of the Old Covenant but the opportunity to see and hear the Son of God in person and to witness His miraculous works (Matt. 11:22–23).\n\nIn the parable of the slaves who awaited their master’s return from the wedding feast, Jesus explains that “that slave who knew his master’s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, shall receive many lashes, but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of flogging, will receive but few” (Luke 12:47–48). “Hell will have such severe degrees,” writes John Gerstner, “that a sinner, were he able, would give the whole world if his sins could be one less.”\n\nFourth, the torment of hell will be everlasting. Nothing will be so horrible about hell as its endlessness. Jesus uses the same word to describe the duration of hell as the duration of heaven: “These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life” (Matt. 25:46). People in hell will experience the total absence of hope.

The Father's wrath over the corruption of a believer would be worse!\n\nJohn MacArthur - Heavy millstone translates mulos onikos, which refers to the large upper millstone that was turned in a grinding process by a donkey and often weighed hundreds of pounds. The Romans sometimes practiced this form of execution by tying a heavy stone around a criminal's neck and dropping him overboard in deep water. Such a pagan form of execution was unimaginably horrible to Jews, perhaps in some respects more fearful even than crucifixion. Yet Jesus said that suffering such a terrifying death would be better than causing even one of His people to sin. (MacArthur New Testament Commentary – Matthew 16-23)\n\nSee also John MacArthur's sermon - Matthew 18:5-9 The Danger of Causing a Christian to Sin\n\nCBC on a heavy millstone - If receiving them hospitably is tantamount to receiving Jesus himself (Mt 10:40-41; John 13:20), causing them to sin is tantamount to rejecting Jesus himself, which brings consequences immeasurably more severe than drowning with a large millstone around one’s neck (cf. Josephus Antiquities 14.450). “Heavy millstone” is more literally “millstone for a donkey,” a large millstone turned by a donkey. This detail along with the stress on the depth of the sea vividly portrays the horrible consequences of causing a believer to fall into sin. To cause someone to fall into sin is to corrupt that person morally and spiritually and, as Mt 18:7-9 points out, to render him or her liable to eternal punishment (Mt 5:29-30; 17:27). (Cornerstone Biblical Commentary)\n\nMt 18:8-9 “If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. 9 “If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.\n\nSee Did Jesus mean we should literally pluck out our eyes and cut off our hands in Matthew 5:29-30 and 18:8-9?\n\nMt 22:13 “Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’\n\nOn weeping and gnashing of teeth - See below\n\nSee John MacArthur's sermon - Matthew 22:1-14 Responding To A Invitation\n\nGotquestions addresses the phrase the outer darkness - In the Parable of the Wedding Feast, Jesus tells of a “wedding crasher” of sorts: a man in the wedding hall was discovered to have entered the feast without authorization. Jesus says that the king, the master of the feast, issued a dire command concerning the interloper: “Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness” (ESV). Jesus uses the term “outer darkness” in the parable to describe a condition of great sorrow, loss and woe. It stands in vivid contrast to the brightly lit and joyous celebration attended by those who accepted the king’s invitation. Interpreting the wedding feast as heaven, the “outer darkness” must be the place of eternal punishment. Most Bible scholars agree that the phrase “outer darkness” refers to hell or, more properly, the lake of fire (Matthew 8:12; 13:42; 13:50; and 25:23). The outer darkness of Jesus’ parable is called “blackest darkness” in Jude 1:13. Again, a place of judgment is the obvious meaning, since it is reserved for “godless men” (Jude 1:4). Perhaps the place of judgment is pictured as “dark” because of the absence of God’s cheering presence. “When you hide your face, they are terrified” (Psalm 104:29). God is called “light” in 1 John 1:5, and if He withdraws His blessing, only darkness is left. Throughout the Scriptures light symbolizes God’s purity, holiness, and glory. Darkness is used as a symbol of moral depravity (Psalm 82:5; Proverbs 2:13; Romans 3:12). Darkness can also refer to trouble and affliction (Job 5:12; Proverbs 20:20; Isaiah 9:2) and to death and nothingness (1 Samuel 2:9; Ecclesiastes 11:8; Job 3:4-6). The outer darkness of judgment is accompanied by “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” The “weeping” describes an inner pain of the heart, mind, and soul. The word in the original denotes a bewailing or lamentation by beating the breast in an expression of immense sorrow. The “gnashing of teeth” describes an outward pain of the body. Taken together, the weeping and gnashing of teeth says hell is a place of indescribable spiritual agony and unending physical pain (see Luke 16:23-28). The outer darkness is a place of anguish, heartache, grief, and unspeakable suffering. Such will be the lot of all who reject Christ (John 3:18, 36). Christ is the Light of the World (John 8:12). When one rejects the Light, he will be cast into eternal darkness. Just like the man in the parable, the one who rejects Christ will lose his chance for joy, blessing and fellowship and will be left with nothing but darkness and eternal regret. (Gotquestions)\n\nMt. 23:15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell (gehenna) as yourselves.\n\nMacArthur: Of hell translates a Greek genitive that refers to belonging to or being characterized by Son of hell and thus referred to a person who was especially characterized by hellishness. Twice…a son hell would be person who was doubly hellish and doubly damned. Hell is from geenna, derived from the name of a valley just outside Jerusalem called Hinnom where refuse was burned. It was considered an accursed place because it was the site where ancient worshipers of the pagan deity Moloch offered their children as live burnt sacrifices, a hideous practice taken up even by some Israelites (see 2 Chr 28:3; Jer. 7:31). When King Josiah declared the place unclean (2 Ki 23:10), it became a garbage dump, and because flames and smoke arose from the valley continually, it also became a vivid picture of the eternal fires of hell. How grateful every believer should be that at some time in His life he was confronted by a spiritual door-opener rather than a spiritual door-closer, someone who shows the way to the kingdom rather than shuts people out of it. And how grateful every believer should be who has the opportunity to hear and study the Word of God in truth. Even a dull presentation of the true gospel is immeasurably superior to the most exciting presentation of a false gospel that damns to hell. As a citizen of God’s kingdom, every believer ought to be one who opens the door of the kingdom to others. (See Matthew 16-23 MacArthur New Testament Commentary)\n\nRobert Morey - In this passage Christ delivers one of the most scathing attacks on the Pharisees anywhere recorded in Scripture. In His attack, Christ used the rabbinic phrase “a son of Gehenna” to refer to their converts. According to A. T. Robertson, the phrase “son of hell” means “one fitted for and so destined for Gehenna.’” It is synonymous with the “son of perdition” (John 17:12). (Borrow a copy of Death and the Afterlife)\n\nSee also John MacArthur's sermon - Matthew 23:13-15 The Condemnation of False Spiritual Leaders 3\n\nMatt 23:33 (v32 = “Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers.) “You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell (gehenna) ?\n\nComment: What a horrible double metaphor - snakes and more snakes! I hate snakes! Note that Jesus' question is rhetorical, because the truth is that they could not escape eternal hell if they carried out the evil intent of their \"venomous\" hearts. Jesus’ epithets recall John the Baptist's description of them in Mt 3:7 where he urged repentance. The Lord had also used this title before (Matt 12:34), making it clear that nothing good could come out of their hearts. The sobering “judgment of hell” recalls Mt 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15. Paul writes \"But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS\" (Ro 2:5-6)\n\nNotice that the word sentence is the Greek word krisis (a decision, judgment, verdict, justice, court) which gives us our English word \"Crisis\" which is defined as a crucial stage or turning point in the course of something or \"an event that is expected to lead to an unstable and dangerous situation affecting an individual!\" Indeed, Jesus uses the language of the courtroom to describe the time of \"Crisis\" in every unbeliever's life. When an unrepentant, unregenerate person dies, they immediately find themselves consciously aware that they are in Hades, the temporary holding tank (where all unbelievers are today), a place of agony and torment with no hope of \"pardon.\" At the future Great White Throne judgment that comes immediately after the glorious 1000 year Millennial Reign of Christ, all occupants of Hades will be resurrected (the \"Second Resurrection\" - see also Births, Deaths, and Resurrections) and will stand bodily before the Lord Jesus Christ, the Judge of the living (quick) and the dead (Rev 20:11-13+). In that courtroom scene every man or woman who refused and rejected Christ's offer to be their Savior during their life on earth, will now be forced to acknowledge Him as their Judge! This is their time of \"Crisis\" for when the Lord Jesus Christ passes judgment based on their deeds (to determine the degree of their punishment), they are thrown alive into Hell (cf Rev 19:20-note), which is also known as Gehenna or the Lake of fire and which corresponds to the Second Death. Paul says \"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.\" (2 Th 1:9) The word eternal is aionos which means everlasting or forever with no second chance, no hope of reprieve or release or rest! A fate so horrible it is honestly difficult to even ponder because it is so disturbing to our senses! The word \"destruction\" is olethros which is derived from ollumi a verb meaning to destroy and the root of apollumi which as we have discussed means to destroy utterly and has to do with that which is ruined and is no longer usable for its intended purpose. Olethros then describes a state of utter and hopeless ruin and the end of all that gives worth to human existence! Do not confuse this with a state of annihilation and non-existence so that there is no longer an actual personal perception, for olethros signifies an unavoidable, very real experience of distress and torment! The destruction Paul warns about begins at the moment of \"Crisis,\" or final sentencing. This destruction will not be a loss of being but rather a loss of well-being. If these truths do not grip your heart and constrain you to be filled with the Spirit and to boldly, unashamedly tell your co-workers, friends and relatives about the Good News of Jesus Christ then I don't know what will stir your heart. In fact, if you have no desire to share the Good News, it might be possible that you yourself have never actually received the Good News. You may be deceived and still spiritually dead in your trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1-note) as are many today who call themselves \"Christians\" but \"live like the devil!\" Whether you are a possessor or professor of Jesus Christ, the truth on eternal punishment should cause a \"Crisis\" in your life! Redeem the time! Either repent and believe the Gospel or if you are a genuine follower of Jesus begin to actively, zealously share the Gospel with all who are around you who are only one heartbeat away from their ultimate \"Crisis!\"\n\nExpositor's Bible Commentary – The transition from the preceding verse (Mt 23:32) is clear: if the teachers of the law and Pharisees are filling up the measure of the sin of their forefathers, how can they possibly escape the condemnation of hell\n\nQuesnel - \"Before sinning, we ought to fear lest it be the filling up; after sinning, we should trust in a truly Christian hope that it is not, and repent. This is the only means to escape the damnation of hell; but how rare is this grace after a pharisaical life!\" (Pulpit Commentary).\n\nJohn Phillips Commentary – Note that He did not say there was no escape. There was a way of escape, but they would refuse that new and living way into the holiest through the blood of Jesus (Hebrews 10:19-20). How rare it is for a Pharisee of whatever persuasion to accept God's means of grace! The Lord was talking to men who refused the conditions of salvation. The great white throne judgment and the flames of eternal fire are the inevitable end of unrepentant behavior such as theirs.\n\nWhat the Bible Teaches - Heaven would not welcome one man walking a life of such blatant hypocrisy; the serpents would go the way of the serpent—\"that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan ... was cast into the lake of fire\" (Rev 20:2, 10).\n\nSee also John MacArthur's sermon - Matthew 23:16-33 The Condemnation of False Spiritual Leaders 4\n\nMt 25:30 “Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nJohn MacArthur - Outer darkness is a common New Testament description of hell. “God is light,” John declared, “and in Him there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5). Light signifies God’s presence, and darkness signifies his absence. Hell not only is eternal darkness but eternal torment. In that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, signifying the unrelieved agony of separated from God’s presence and goodness. (Matthew Commentary)\n\nThere is a time I know not when, a place I know not where,\n\nwhich marks the destiny of men to heaven or despair.\n\nThere is a line by us not seen which crosses every path,\n\nhe hidden boundary between God's patience and His wrath.\n\nTo cross that limit is to die, to die as if by stealth;\n\nit may not pale the beaming eye nor quench the glowing health.\n\nThe conscience may be still at ease, the spirit light and gay,\n\nthat which is pleasing still may please and care be thrust away.\n\nBut on that forehead God hath set indelibly a mark,\n\nby man unseen for man as yet is blind and in the dark.\n\nHow long may man go on in sin, how long will God forbear,\n\nwhere does hope end and where begin the confines of despair?\n\nOne answer from the sky is sent, ye who from God depart,\n\nwhile it is called `today' repent and harden not your heart.\n\nSee John MacArthur's study guide and sermon\n\nMatthew 25:20-30: Tragedy of Wasted Opportunity 2 - Study Guide - click dropdown\n\nMatthew 25:20-30: Tragedy of Wasted Opportunity 2\n\nMt. 25:31–33 “But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. 32 “All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; 33 and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.\n\nComment: This passage does not use the word hell but does set the context for the following verse Mt 25:41. Although we do not know at what precise time in history that event will occur (Matt. 24:36, 42, 44, 50), we know that He will appear \"immediately after the tribulation\" (Mt 24:29). This judgment of the Nations is a Gentile judgment also know as the judgment of the Sheep and Goats which will occur when Jesus returns as King of kings and Lord of lords and establishes His millennial kingdom. Those on His right will enter His kingdom, but those on His left will be sent away into eternal punishment. In the ancient Near East, as in much of that land still today, sheep and goats are frequently herded together. But sheep are docile, gentle creatures, whereas goats are unruly and rambunctious and can easily upset the sheep. Because they do not feed or rest well together, the shepherd often separates them for grazing and for sleeping at night.\n\nNotice the concept of separation in Mt 25:32 which recalls the effect of the first spiritual death of Adam which was to produce separation between God and man (cf Ge 3:7-10-note). Christ came to bridge that gap on the Cross. But for those who do not receive His gift of new life by grace through faith the Second Death will finalize forever the separation of God and man, Paul writing \"These (2 Th 1:8 \" those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus\") will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.\" (2 Th 1:9)\n\nMacArthur adds \"Apparently His judgment will be instantaneous, at the moment He appears, and when that occurs the opportunity for faith in Him will be past. As Jesus makes clear later in this passage, those who are alive on earth when He returns will include both saved and unsaved, represented by the sheep and the goats, respectively. Just as death immediately crystallizes eternity for unbelievers when they die, so will the second coming of Christ crystallize eternity for unbelievers who are then alive. They will be destroyed on the spot and ushered instantaneously into judgment and eternal punishment. But believers who are alive at the Lord's coming in glory will go directly into the earthly kingdom in their earthly bodies. There is no indication in Scripture that those saints will experience any sort of transformation at that time. But mingling with them and ruling over them will be the glorified saints of all ages who will then be reigning with Christ (Rev. 20:4). Although their bodies will be of vastly different orders, those two groups of saints will be able to communicate and interact with each other just as Jesus communicated and interacted with the disciples in His glorified body after the resurrection....Those who reject a literal Millennium must do one or more of three things. The first is to confuse Israel and the church, taking the church to be a spiritualized form of the ancient nation of Israel. In that case, the Old Testament curses were for literal Israel, being already fulfilled, and the promises of blessing to Israel would be fulfilled in the church, but in a spiritual, not literal, way. That kind of divided, inconsistent hermeneutics in unacceptable. The second is to make present or past what is clearly future, assuming that all the promises to the literal nation and people of Israel have already been fulfilled, making the earthly kingdom unnecessary. The third is to arbitrarily spiritualize certain Old Testament prophecies, taking predicted places, events, or persons as being merely symbols of spiritual ideas or truths instead of physical and historical realities.

Men chose the eternal fire of hell by rejecting Christ. A very bad choice which they will regret throughout eternity!\n\nMacArthur - Joining the unredeemable devil and his angels in the eternal fire of hell will be those human beings who refused to believe. It is just as obvious that Christ does not condemn these people because they failed to serve Him (Mt 25:42-43) as it is that He does not save the others because they did serve Him (Mt 25:34-35). These are accursed because they rejected Christ, just as those who enter the kingdom are righteous (Mt 25:37) because they accepted Him. Their rejection of Christ left them in a state where they were not able to do righteous deeds. Jesus is speaking of eternal separation from God and from His goodness, righteousness, truth, joy peace, and every other good thing. He is speaking of eternal association with the devil and his angels in the place of torment God prepared for them. He is speaking of eternal isolation, where there will be no fellowship, no consolation, and no encouragement. He is speaking of eternal duration and of eternal affliction, from which there will be no relief or respite. The evidence that those rejected people never belonged to Christ will be that they did not love and serve His people. (MacArthur New Testament Commentary – Matthew 24-28).\n\nMt 25:46 “These (the \"goats,\" those on Jesus' left) will go away into eternal (aionios) punishment (kolasis), but the righteous into eternal (aionios) life.”\n\nComment: We have already discussed the clear logic of Jesus' statement which teaches that if believers will be in heaven with God forever, the lost will be in hell with the devil forever. However they will have no fellowship with the devil and the devil is not the source of torment for John writes \"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" (Rev 20:10+)\n\nAs discussed above Daniel 12:2-note makes a very similar statement that speaks of two antithetical eternal destinies and the Septuagint version uses aionios twice just as in Mt 25:46 where eternal punishment \"balances\" eternal life.\n\n“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life (Lxx = zoen aionion), but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt (Lxx = aischunen aionion).\"\n\nDonald Barnhouse writes \"At all events the doctrine of conscious, eternal torment for impenitent men is clearly revealed in the Word of God. Whether we can defend it on philosophic grounds or not, it is our business to believe it; and to leave it to the clearer light of eternity to explain what we cannot now understand, realizing that God has infinitely wise reasons for doing things for which we in our ignorance can see no sufficient reason at all. It is the most ludicrous conceit for beings so limited and foolish as the wisest of men are, to attempt to dogmatize how a God of infinite wisdom must act. All we know as to how God will act is what God has seen fit to tell us.\" (Revelation)\n\nMatt. 26:24 “The Son of Man is to go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”\n\nComment: This is similar to Jesus' warning in Mt 18:6. Jesus the omniscient God knew the horror of the eternal punishment that awaited the one who betrayed Him. So horrible is this fate that it would have been better to not ever have been born. We cannot even imagine how horrible is this terrible fate.\n\nMark 9:43–48 “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell (gehenna)., into the unquenchable fire, 44 [where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.] 45 “If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell (gehenna)., 46 [where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.] 47 “If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell (gehenna)., 48 where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.\n\nComment: As noted above (see note on Gehenna) the garbage dump of Jerusalem was characterized by a perpetual fire and because of the garbage was a place where worms thrived. This picture would be well known to the hearers of Jesus' words and would help understand His quotation from the very last verse in Isaiah, Isaiah 66:24 (“Then they will go forth and look On the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm will not die And their fire will not be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind.”)\n\nRobert Morey - The intertestamental literature is clear that the Jews believed that the departed could feel what was happening to their dead body. Indeed, when the worms start gnawing on the body, “the worms are as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living” (Bab. Tal. Shah. 777, 778). (Borrow a copy of Death and the Afterlife)\n\nLutzer writes \"This picture of an unclean dump where fires and worms never die became to the Jewish mind an appropriate description of the ultimate fate of all idolaters. Thus the word became applied to the ultimate gehenna. The Jews taught, and Christ confirmed, that the wicked would suffer there forever. Body and soul would be in eternal torment.\" (Borrow One Minute After You Die)\n\nMark 8:36-37 “For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? “For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\n\nMacArthur: What’s your soul worth? It will live forever, you consciously will live forever, you’re going to live in hell forever in punishment, or in heaven forever in joy. How do you redeem your soul? By coming to Christ, denying yourself, taking up your cross, suffering as He requires for the glory that will be revealed in the future.

Satan is neither the one who sends people to hell, nor is he the ruler of hell. On the contrary he himself will in a sure future day be cast into hell (Rev. 20:10+), where he will be its most notorious prisoner for all eternity. Nowhere in Scripture is there a command to fear Satan....Here is another strong passage in our Lord’s teaching that refutes the false idea that there is no hell. To insist that hell is a reference to the grave only destroys the contrast here and makes nonsense out of the Lord’s statement. If there is no hell, then God would be unable to do anything to a person other than what men could do. Both could kill someone, who then would merely go out of existence. Jesus’ whole point is that God is to be feared because He alone has the authority to both kill sinners and after death cast them into eternal torment. (MacArthur New Testament Commentary – Luke 11-17)\n\nSee John MacArthur's sermon - Luke 12:1-7 A Certain Cure for Hypocrisy, Part 1\n\nLuke 12:9–10-note but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 10 “And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him.\n\nComment: Notice the parallel between deny Me/blasphemes against the Holy Spirit and the results of these actions - denied before the angels of God/it will not be forgiven him.\n\nJohn MacArthur - Those who fail to genuinely confess Christ as Lord will one day hear Him say, “I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness” (Matt. 7:23). The sure way to miss out on heaven is to deny Christ, as the scribes and Pharisees had done. But just as sure a way to gain hell is to make an insincere, superficial confession of Christ (Matt. 7:21-22). Heaven belongs only to those who honor the Father by truly honoring the Son....To blaspheme the Holy Spirit is to reject His testimony concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. The Spirit reveals the truth of salvation in Christ, and those who speak evil of that revelation, as the Pharisees had done (Luke 11:15), reject the testimony of the Holy Spirit to Christ (cf. John 15:26). Having cut themselves off from the only source of divine, saving truth, they cannot be saved.

These words refer to those whose lack of allegiance will be revealed under pressure. This will amount to apostasy (1 John 2:19). Most likely, this does not refer to an incident where lack of courage might cause a believer not to speak up, but rather to a person who totally rejects Christ and lives a life of denial. The astounding statement is that each person's standing before God is based on his or her relationship to Jesus Christ.

Most tragic, he shall be cut asunder, cut off from God's presence. The Lord will appoint the unfaithful steward his portion with the unbelievers. Why? Because he was not genuine. He was a hypocrite.\n\nJohn Phillips - This servant is no servant at all. Whatever profession of faith the man might have made is annulled by his behavior. The Lord numbers him among the unbelievers. Judas was just such a man. (Exploring the Gospel of Luke: An Expository Commentary)\n\nWhat the Bible teaches - Those who want to make this the punishment of a genuine believer who has been unfaithful apply the word figuratively to the cutting with a scourge. \"There is no example of the word being used of scourging\" (A. Plummer). Even if we could use a figurative meaning here, the problem would remain about the meaning of the words, \"appoint him his portion with the unbelievers\", which refers to punishment after death. To be cut in sunder is a violent death (1 Chron 20:3), and to be with the unbelievers forever is the correct portion for this false servant. (What the Bible teaches – Luke)\n\nESV Study Bible - place with the unbelievers —a metaphorical reference to the punishment that awaits the unbeliever at the return of Christ. The latter description (cf. Luke 13:27-28 and esp. the parallel in Matt. 24:51) indicates eternal judgment and separation from God (cf. Luke 8:13).\n\nPulpit Commentary - The expression is, however, used as simply implying that a terrible doom is surely reserved in the life to come for those who have so sadly misused their high opportunities and neglected their great responsibilities.\n\nLuke 13:22-30-note And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem. 23And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?” And He said to them, 24 \"Strive (present imperative - command to continually strive) to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

The word in the original denotes a bewailing or lamentation by beating the breast in an expression of immense sorrow. The “gnashing of teeth” describes an outward pain of the body. Taken together, the weeping and gnashing of teeth says hell is a place of indescribable spiritual agony and unending physical pain (see Luke 16:23-28-note).(For a full discussion see answer to the question What does the Bible mean when it refers to the gnashing of teeth?)\n\nJohn MacArthur on “weeping and gnashing of teeth” - The torment of hell will not be limited to the pain of punishment, but will include the remorse, shock, and surprise of those who ended up there despite thinking they were going to heaven. The more people in hell knew about the gospel, the more profound their remorse will be; their pain will be proportional to their level of rejection. And since their rejection will be eternal and incurable, so will their sin be and the judgment of that sin.

If hell did not consist of conscious suffering, it would be hard to see how it could in any meaningful sense be worse than death, be worse than earthly suffering, be filled with weeping and gnashing of teeth, or be a place of misery. These images communicate that people in hell will be aware that they are suffering just punishment. (What Is Hell?)\n\nLawrence Richards - This was why repentance and faith in Jesus are such urgent matters. Individuals who failed to turn to Him will be shut out of the future kingdom, where \"there will be weeping … and gnashing of teeth.\" (The 365 Day Devotional Commentary. Victor Books)\n\nSee Journal article on The Function of Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth in Matthew's Gospel - Zoltan L. Erdey and Kevin G. Smith\n\nBilly Graham - let me be as clear as possible: you don’t want to go to Hell. The Bible speaks of Hell as a place of “darkness [where] there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” Hell is a place of absolute loneliness and hopelessness. But the good news is that God doesn’t want you to go there! Jesus paid the price for your sins; He took upon Himself the death and Hell we deserve, through His death on the cross. Trust Jesus as your Lord and Savior, and thank Him that you will spend all eternity with Him in Heaven.\n\nLuke 16:22–23-see detailed discussion below “Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. 23 “In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.\n\nSee John MacArthur's sermons -\n\nLuke 16:19-31 A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 1\n\nLuke 16:19-31 A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 2\n\nLuke 16:19-31 A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 3\n\nLuke 16:19-31 A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 4\n\nLuke 16:19-31 A Testimony of One Surprised to be in Hell, Part 5\n\nJohn 5:28–29 “Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, 29 and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life (\"FIRST RESURRECTION\"), those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.\n\nComment: Unbelievers are currently inhabiting their intermediate abode of Hades, from which they will actually be \"released.\" This \"release\" corresponds to the \"Second Resurrection\" (see Births, Deaths, and Resurrections) at which time they will bodily stand before Jesus the Judge at the Great White Throne judgment and be cast into the Lake of fire, which is synonymous with gehenna and the Second Death. See Rev 20:11-15+. The annihilationists, such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who deny any future resurrection for the wicked are here clearly condemned.\n\nSee John MacArthur's sermons -\n\nJohn 5:25–29 The Dead Will Hear Christ\n\nJohn 5:25-29 The Two Resurrections\n\nJohn 8:21 Then He said again to them, “I go away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin (AND BY IMPLICATION BE SENT TO HELL); where I am going (HEAVEN), you cannot come.”\n\nSee John MacArthur's sermons -\n\nJohn 8:21-25 A Plan for Dying in Your Sins\n\nJohn 8:21-30 The Simple Gospel\n\nJohn 8:21-30 How to Die in Your Sins\n\nJohn 8:21-30 Four Ways to Miss Heaven\n\nAddendum: Robert Morey discusses how the Work of Christ helps understand eternal punishment:\n\nIt is at this point that the vicarious atonement of Christ is crucial to our understanding of divine punishment.\n\nFirst, the fact of the atonement reveals the necessity of divine punishment for sin.\n\nSecond, Christ took the punishment for sin which His people would have suffered.\n\nThird, the nature of Christ’s vicarious punishment will be a good indication of the nature of divine punishment of rebel sinners.\n\nChrist experienced divine punishment by\n\n(1) Alienation and separation from the person and gifts of God: “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” (Matt. 27:46).\n\n(2) Conscious pain, suffering, and misery from the alienation and suffering: “Surely our griefs He Himself bore, and our sorrows He carried; yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted…The Lord was pleased to crush Him, putting Him to grief…as a result of the anguish of His soul” (Isa. 53:4–11). “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer” (Luke 24:46). “Christ also suffered for you” (1 Pet. 2:21). “Christ has suffered in the flesh” (1 Pet. 4:1).\n\n(3) Death: “Christ Jesus died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (1 Cor. 15:3).\n\nHis death on the cross illustrates the separation of body and soul which takes place when death occurs. Thus, when He died, His body remained intact in the tomb while in His spirit or soul He went to Hades according to Peter in Acts 2:27 and in 1 Pet. 3:18–20. This is echoed in the Apostles’ Creed which said that “he descended into hell [Hades].”\n\nWe must pause at this point and emphasize that nonexistence was not the punishment inflicted on the body and soul of Christ. If the annihilationists were right, then Christ should have disintegrated on the cross and would have ceased to exist in body and soul. However, Christ’s body was not annihilated but intact in the tomb while His soul was conscious in Hades.\n\nSince the annihilationists believe that the body and soul of sinners pass into nonexistence either at death or the resurrection and that this is the nature of divine judgment, how do they explain the existence of Christ’s body in the tomb?\n\nThe Jehovah’s Witnesses state that Christ’s body probably dissolved into gases and ceased to exist. In order for Christ’s punishment to parallel the total destruction of body and soul which will happen to sinners, they feel that Christ must be totally destroyed in body and soul. Thus, they go on to deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ. "
