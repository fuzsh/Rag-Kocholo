        "text": "WHEN Vladimir Dukelsky came to America in 1921, the classically trained Russian composer began writing popular songs, and soon thereafter he met George Gershwin.\n\nGershwin, himself embarking upon a similar path of creative duality, advised Dukelsky to continue working on both concert and theater music, but urged him to come up with a more readily pronounceable name for his lighter efforts. Thus it was Vladimir Dukelsky who continued composing operas, ballets and symphonic works, but it was Vernon Duke who would go on to write such standards as ''April in Paris,'' ''I Can't Get Started With You'' and ''Autumn in New York.''\n\n''Far from being a boon,'' wrote Duke with the wit that so often surfaces in his music, ''my versatility has been infuriating to the critical boys, who seem to think there is something monstrous about a composer writing two different kinds of music under two different names. It annoys them not to be able to say that I go slumming when writing jazz, and it annoys them even more not to be able to classify me as an ambitious peasant, gazing at the musical Olympus behind a Lindy's herring.''\n\nAt 8:30 P.M. Saturday, the twin skills of the composer will be represented at the Westport Arts Center, with his widow, the soprano Kay McCracken Duke, singing some of the popular songs accompanied by the pianist Thomas Russell, and Natalie Ryshna Maynard playing five of Dukelsky's classical works for piano. Several friends and admirers will also perform and tell anecdotes about the composer. For reservations, call 227-8998 or 227-3345.\n\nSeveral American composers are in the spotlight this week: a wind ensemble called New Winds will perform at Wesleyan University, a three-day festival at the Hartt School will honor John Downey, and the Stamford Symphony will offer the premiere of Richard Danielpour's Symphony No. 3.\n\nThe Wesleyan programs, cosponsored by Real Art Ways, include a 4:30 P.M. Tuesday Arts Dialogue and an 8 P.M. Wednesday concert in Crowell Hall with original compositions as well as transcriptions of jazz pieces by Duke Ellington and Ornette Coleman. The players of New Winds, who describe themselves as an improvising wind ensemble, are the flutist Robert Dick, the clarinetist J. D. Parran and the saxophonist Ned Rothenberg, and all of them double on more arcane wind instruments like the shakuhachi and the ocarina (232-1006).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
