        "text": "Old Devil Moon\n\nFrom 'Any Old Time'\n\nBy Carmen McRae\n\nHere's one of two songs we'll hear that were written for Finian's Rainbow by Harburg and composer Burton Lane. Many jazz versions of this song exist, but this one features the great Carmen McRae (who shares a birthday with Harburg) playing it fast and loose. At one point toward the end of the song, she even sings, \"Why don'cha fade this mutha?\" Featured with McRae are Eric Gunnison (piano), Scott Colley (bass), John Collins (guitar) and Mark Pulice (drums).\n\nYip Harburg: A Lyricist For The Ages\n\n4:16\n\nApril in Paris\n\nFrom 'Messenger'\n\nBy Kurt Elling\n\nHarburg wrote this one with composer Vernon Duke for a 1932 Broadway show called Walk a Little Faster. Though perhaps the most famous version of \"April in Paris\" is the instrumental by Count Basie, vocalist Kurt Elling shows us that a great melody and beautiful lyric are timeless. In this 1997 arrangement, solos are provided by trumpeter Orbert Davis and Elling's longtime collaborator, pianist Laurence Hobgood.\n\nYip Harburg: A Lyricist For The Ages\n\n5:02\n\nThe Begat\n\nFrom 'Over the Rainbow: The Songs of E.Y. Yip Harburg'\n\nBy Susannah McCorkle\n\nWe're back to Finian's Rainbow for Susannah McCorkle's small-group arrangement of \"The Begat.\" Throughout his life, Harburg leaned far to the left politically and was blacklisted in Hollywood from the early '50s through the early '60s. But even back in 1947, when Finian's Rainbow hit Broadway, Harburg was slipping sociopolitical satire into his lyrics, often in witty, winning ways. \"The Begat\" is a great example of that, as well as a demonstration of his inventive way with rhymes.\n\nYip Harburg: A Lyricist For The Ages\n\n3:40\n\nBrother, Can You Spare A Dime?\n\nFrom 'Un \"Sung Stories\"'\n\nBy Phil Alvin\n\nYip Harburg and Jay Gorney wrote this classic for a 1931 musical called New Americana, but it soon became the theme of the Great Depression, thanks primarily to Bing Crosby's 1932 recording of the song. But great songs never get old and, at least in this case, many don't lose relevance. This wonderful 1986 version features vocalist/guitarist Phil Alvin, who had just disbanded his blues/rock/Americana band The Blasters. To accompany him on \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" he selected none other than pianist, composer and arranger Sun Ra and his Arkestra. In this song, artists from what would seem to be opposite corners of the American musical map come together to make powerful music.\n\nYip Harburg: A Lyricist For The Ages\n\n4:09\n\nOver The Rainbow\n\nFrom 'My One & Only Thrill'\n\nBy Melody Gardot\n\nThis song is Yip Harburg's greatest lyrical legacy, a perfect melding of words and music that has staked a claim for immortality. Though Judy Garland's version of \"Over the Rainbow\" is considered definitive, the song has been recorded by an amazing spectrum of musicians, from Frank Sinatra to Jeff Beck. To wrap up this list, here's Melody Gardot's Latin-flavored 2009 arrangement of one of popular music's loveliest and most touching songs.\n\nYip Harburg: A Lyricist For The Ages"
