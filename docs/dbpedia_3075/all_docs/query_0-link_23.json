        "text": "The cast of ''Babes in Arms'' had been assembled for the grand total of an hour before hearing five of the most frightening words in theater: ''We open in a week.''\n\nThe speaker was Kathleen Marshall, the director of the show and the artistic director of Encores series at City Center, which is presenting ''Babes in Arms'' this weekend. She was exaggerating just a tiny bit; the cast, crew and musicians had a whole 10 days to put together its production of the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical.\n\n''So here's the deal, guys,'' said Ms. Marshall, addressing the cast on Monday morning, Feb. 1. ''In a week you'll be down onstage on a set that isn't built, with blocking you don't know, saying lines you haven't learned for a big crowd of people.'' She paused to let the nervous laughter subside and added, ''So let's go.''\n\nThus began the sometimes mad, sometimes miraculous process of putting on a show Encores style. Ms. Marshall, along with the musical director, Rob Fisher, was about to turn a group of 32 actors, singers and dancers into an ensemble, and then turn that ensemble loose.\n\nEncores, in its sixth season, is a program devoted to concert performances of three rarely seen American musicals a year, each meticulously resuscitated from archival sources and staged for an ultra-limited run of five performances. Previous Encores seasons have included rarities like ''St. Louis Woman'' (1946) and ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1939).\n\n''Babes in Arms,'' which runs through Sunday, is this year's first production and will be followed by ''The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936,'' a musical revue with songs by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin, in late March, and ''Do Re Mi,'' with songs by Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, in May.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
