He founded the Society for Forgotten Music, and served as its president. His autobiography is \"Listen Here!\". Joining ASCAP in 1934, his chief musical collaborators included E.Y. Harburg, Ira Gershwin, Ogden Nash, Howard Dietz, and John Latouche. His other popular-song compositions include \"I Am Only Human After All\", \"Too Too Divine\", \"That's Life\", \"Speaking of Love\", \"So Nonchalant\", \"Water Under the Bridge\", \"I Like the Likes of You\", \"Suddenly\", \"What Is There to Say?\", \"Island in the West Indies\", \"Words Without Music\", \"Now\", \"Taking a Chance on Love\", \"Do What You Wanna Do\", \"Love Turned the Light Out\", \"Honey in the Honeycomb\", \"Cabin in the Sky\", \"We're Having a Baby\", \"Not a Care in the World\", \"Summer Is A-Comin' In\", \"The Love I Long For\", \"The Sea-Gull and the Ea-Gull\", \"Spring Again\", \"Roundabout\", \"Out of the Clear Blue Sky\", \"Just Like a Man\", \"That's What Makes Paris Paree\", \"London in July\", \"Good Little Girls\", \"You're Far from Wonderful\", and \"Madly in Love\"."
