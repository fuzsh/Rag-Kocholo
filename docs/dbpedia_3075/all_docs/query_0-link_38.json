        "text": "Treva, my writing partner, and I hooked up after I came back from a year in Europe (more of this later). In fact, over Christmas vacation we’d gone to Julius Monk’s new revue room (a boite, yes) to see a show called Take Five, which featured comic Ronny Graham, remembered from New Faces of ’52.\n\nThe room was in a cellar on 51st street and sixth avenue, it was called Julius Monk’s Downstairs Room; five performers and a spinet on a tiny stage in the basement, and they were funny. And just when you thought the comedy had reached a peak, the show delivered a ballad –which held you in suspension until you could begin laughing again, refreshed by the pause. Julius had re-packaged intimate revue. Ronny Graham came out with a joint and pretended to get stoned –marijuana was just gaining prominence (again) among ‘bopsters’ “-and don’t breathe in,” he wheezed, “it’s mine!” Jeanne Arnold sang about discovering love (or at least lust) in the supermarket:\n\nGRISTEDE’S\n\nWE MET AT GRISTEDE’S\n\nI WAS LOOKING FOR WHEATIES\n\nYOU WERE LOOKING FOR KIX\n\nAnd there was another Bart Howard ballad, Perfect Stranger. Treva and I were enchanted, dazzled. God, we thought, if we could only get a piece of our material into one of these shows, what a coup that would be! How hip would we be then?! We agonized and compared notes: which pieces would we select to present? We decided to go down to 51st street, talk to Mr. Monk and make an appointment to show him our numbers. We presented ourselves at the club one September evening and found Julius readily approachable. In fact, he played intermission piano at the spinet upstairs. As we came in the door, I recognized what he was playing, Rodgers & Hart’s Quiet Night. Portia Nelson sang it on my Goddard Lieberson recording of On Your Toes. Oh, God please let him grant us an appointment.It felt as if we were seeking an audience with the Pope.\n\nWe were only partially prepared for Julius’ rococo manner of speech. He was from Oxford, Mississippi, but seemed to believe he was from Oxford, England. We had heard some of his bizarre locutions: “Ladies and gentlemen,’ he would say, “Friars, Congregants and conceivably Elders. May ah direct yaw attention and applawse to our post-prandial prank, a prank for the shank, Take Fahve!” I waited till he was just getting up from the piano. “Mr Monk?” He turned towards me without a smile, but with eyebrows quizzically raised.He was attired in a navy pinstripe suit, very elegant. He was, we knew, currently modeling for Hathaway shirts. He sported a British Colonel’s mustache, graying, as was his hair. “Yes?” “I’m John Meyer and this is Treva Silverman. We’re writers, and we’ve written some numbers we’d like you to hear.” Now he smiled, displaying a set of uneven, yellowing teeth. “Well, how utterly charming, how positively Marie Antoinette of you.” I had no idea what he meant, but he was moving towards the head of the stairwell which led to the cellar. He stretched out his arm, inviting us to follow him. We did.\n\nIt was a real basement. As I recall, the floor was stone, painted gray-blue. A platform had been set at one end, with a curtain drawn around it in a semi-circle. I could see the spinet behind the scrim, set down center. There were perhaps twenty half-dollar sized tables placed before the platform; people were drinking, smoking, chatting away. It was intermission. Mr. Monk led us to the side of the stage. He pulled the scrim aside, creating an opening. “Well, mes enfants, the stage is yours.” Treva and I stared at each other in horror. Could he mean…could he possibly mean…? “You mean…now?” “Pourquoi pas?” said Mr. Monk with a wide smile. It never occurred to either of us to do anything but follow his request. This was the chance we’d prayed for: you had to grab your opportunities when they appeared. Who knew when Mr. Monk would be receptive again? We were twenty-one, we didn’t know enough to say No. But…there were people out there, the audience, we could see them just beyond the gossamer scrim. Wouldn’t they hear us? Nonetheless, we spread our music sheets out on the piano, on top of the show’s score. I went first. I was so nervous that even now, I can hardly remember what I played. A couple of my Pheasant Under Glass songs, probably, like Chewgum Smith and Santa Claus is Welching This Year and a ballad, Carousel. I was careful to keep my voice low, away from the paying customers. This did NOT help my performance.\n\nThen Treva went. As she was playing, I saw the some of the show’s cast standing to the side, listening. Gerry Matthews and Ceil Cabot. They were smiling to themselves. Did they think it strange that Mr. Monk was auditioning new material in the middle of their performance? Treva finished. The room’s ambient noise filtered back into our consciousness. We both looked at Mr. Monk. “Step into this area, won’t you, if it doesn’t strahk you as too much of a cul-de-sac”. Treva collected our music from the piano and together we followed Mr. Monk into a small area adjacent to the stage. “Well, children,’ Mr. Monk began, “you are both obviously extremely gifted. Permit me to express mah deepest gratitude for your visit, impromptu as it may have been. Ah’d be pleased if you could entertain the idea of coming to see me encore next year.”\n\nIn this manner, Julius gave us to understand that he didn’t want -couldn’t use- any of the songs he’d just heard. It has always been painful to me when my material is rejected, and my reaction to my humiliation is to scamper away immediately, to evade any sympathy and to stew in my own feelings of shame and disappointment. But I was with Treva. “Let’s go,” I whispered urgently. However, Mr. Monk was offering an invitation. “Would you enjoy staying and seeing our second act?” he queried. I didn’t wait for Treva (who would gladly have taken him up on it) to respond. “Thank you, Mr. Monk, some other time.’ I said, and headed for the stairwell.\n\nOnce outside on Sixth Avenue, I was overcome by a mix of anger and shame: I’d been forced to perform at a disadvantage, and then judged not good enough! “Jesus, how could he put us on the spot like that–?” “In front of everybody!” Treva cried. “Did you see the performers, trying to listen–?” “Oh, God. Let’s get out of here. Let’s go to…Reubens.” Reuben’s, the great sandwich joint, was on East 58th street, a ten minute walk.\n\nWe settled into our booth, and we each ordered sandwiches. Treva got The Dorothy Kilgallen and I went for The Joey Adams. “And I’ll have a Dewar’s and water.” said Treva. “Yeah, a drink, that’s a good idea. I’ll have a glass of Cotes-du-Rhone.” A moment passed. “Is that what your folks drink, Dewar’s?” “My sister, Corky. She graduated from rye and ginger. She said she’s getting to like the taste. Very grown up, she says. You know, I could tell he wasn’t responding. When you were doing the Santa Claus song–?” “Yeah?” “His eyes kind of, like, clouded over.” “And at one point I saw him put his head down.” “And at one point he scratched his knee.”\n\nI glanced down at the pile of music Treva had hurriedly snatched from Mr. Monk’s piano. “Treva” I said, “did you write a song called Perfect Stranger?”Treva shook her head. “Unh unh.” I picked up the sheet. The name on the song was Bart Howard, a name we both knew well enough, he’d written Walk-Up. Beneath it was a song called The Night the Hurricane Struck. By Bud McCreery. Oh, Jesus. It suddenly struck me– “Treva, when you grabbed our music from the piano—“\n\n“What?” “Didn’t it feel heavy to you? Heavier than usual?”\n\n“No. What is it?”\n\n“We’ve just walked off with the music for the second act of Mr. Monk’s show.” “Oh my god.” We broke into the kind of raucous laughter that starts big and gets bigger. “Oh my God, oh shit, Jesus Fucking Christ—“ I pounded the table. “And he wants us back next year!” “Oh, sure, next year we’ll take the piano!” The drinks came, but we were half-way to the door, leaving a bill on the table. Outside we hailed a cab and I had the agonizing duty of running into the club and throwing the music at the maitre d’: “I’m sorry, we ran off with this by mistake –it’s the music for the second act. Would you make sure Mr. Monk gets it? And tell him we’re sorry. Thank you, thank you so much.”\n\nMet a girl at a party. Dimly lit, but I could see she was gorgeous. Big eyes, a wide smile, a quietly feminine manner without a hint of flirtatiousness. She told me her name was Shari. Looked to be in her early twenties. I was maybe five years older, certainly louder and brasher than she, but I subdued myself, matching her attitude to speak with her. At the end of the evening, I asked her Would she go out with me the following Wednesday…and she said yes.\n\nShe lived at 300 West End Avenue (I still remember). She showed me around a spacious, pre-war apartment. I was amazed to see two gold records on the wall of the hall, and, next to the dining room, a fully equipped recording studio. “Yes,” she told me off-handedly, “my father’s.” She seemed dismissive of this, as if it embarrassed her to talk of it. Riding down in the elevator, I saw she was of mixed-race, reminiscent of a young Dorothy Dandridge, yet even more exotic and appealing, in her demure way. We went to the Village to see a movie in a revival, Judgment at Nuremberg. Not what you’d call a Date Movie. It was sombre and meaningful in the most Significant, Stanley Kramer way. Made me hesitant to put my arm around her shoulder. We sat there in strained silence, watching the film. The elephant in the room was How to initiate physical contact?\n\nAfterwards, we got on the subway and came straight back to West End avenue. Conversation now seemed a little forced, her manner towards me had grown slightly reserved. I was abandoning any hope of a goodnight kiss. I saw her downstairs to her elevator. “Would you like to come up?” she said. “Maybe my father’s home.” She seemed more welcoming, now that she was within her own precincts. Maybe there was still hope for that kiss. We rode the elevator up, emerged into the foyer. Voices were coming from the living room. She took me by the hand, pulled me into the living room, which was dominated by an L-shaped couch.\n\nSitting there with his wife, Julie, was Harry Belafonte. They were sitting with Marlon Brando. Brando rose. I saw he had a kid’s cap pistol in his hand. “Hi,” said Harry to the two of us. “Where’d you go?” “We went to the movies,” said Shari. “What’d you see?” “Judgment at Nuremberg.” This gave him pause. I felt an explanation was necessary. “It’s a revival,” I said, “we wanted to see it before it disappeared.” Introductions were made, I shook hands with the two men and made a slight bow to Mrs. Belafonte. I turned to Brando, whom I knew was appearing on TV the next night. I gestured to the cap pistol. “You getting ready for David Susskind?” I asked him. Brando didn’t smile, but he turned the pistol over in his hand.”I like to stay protected.” he said. I don’t remember much more, but it was an amazing capper to my date. And no, sadly, I never saw Shari again. I see by Wikipedia she’s having a nice career.\n\nI taught myself to play piano, hunt and peck style, like learning to type. I could hear sophisticated harmonies and my playing, though untutored, developed a kind of appealing sheen. I’d absorbed hundreds of tunes from composers like Harold Arlen and Vernon Duke, whose harmonic lexicon was irresistible. From time to time I’ll post some anecdotes about my musical adventures.\n\nI played and sang on a luxury train, the American-European Express. It ran from New York to Chicago every Wednesday and Saturday, an overnight hop. There was a Baldwin grand piano in the club car -plus a sound system, and as we glided out of the station at four pm, I’d play a cocktail set for an hour. I wore a tuxedo to add to the flavor, and the passengers would order a Champagne Kir and congratulate themselves on being affluent enough to afford this trip; it cost six hundred dollars, a hefty piece of change in 1980. My set finished at five-fifteen, as the crowd retired to their swank compartments to change for dinner in the elegant dining car. About quarter to five, a pair of young black guys swung through and slowed their momentum long enough to ask me a question: “You be here after dinner?” said the older one. “‘Cause we’ll be back, we’ll bring the horn, hang out and play a li’l with you.” “Oh I’ll be here,” I responded, “but as for playing, the management here is very particular about who they let make music in this car.” “Yeh, that’s all right, we’ll see you after dinner.” As they headed away I saw the younger one was dressed in shorts with white, knee-high socks. He looked no more than fifteen. Well, was I embarrassed. They came back after dinner for my ten o’clock set and the kid turned out to be…Wynton Marsalis! And yes, he brought his horn. “What you want to play?” he asked. I said, “D’you know Jeepers Creepers?” “Oh yeah -love that tune.” So I played an intro, and he jumped in after bar eight. Although it’s an up tune, I slowed it down a bit because his tone was so mellow I wanted to prolong his notes and bask in them. It was obvious (and he was just at the start of his career) this kid had something special. After Jeepers Creepers, I suggested (I Don’t Stand a) Ghost of a Chance With You, a ballad, because I was so entranced with his sound. He was unsure of the bridge: “Play that part again?” he asked me. He got up from the chair to my left and watched my fingers as I went through the progressions. “Yeah, all right, from the top.” We did the song once more and this time he got the melody. I was doing the vocals, to make a showpiece, a presentation out of the numbers. The crowd was increasing as word spread through the train that some extraordinary music was happening in the club car. People were jammed in, pressed against the walls, mesmerized. He played and played, and I joyously accompanied, something I’d become expert at doing, working with singers like Margaret Whiting and Judy Garland. Minutes later, it seemed, I glanced at my watch and it was one-forty-five in the morning. We’d been playing nearly four hours straight without a break. This guy didn’t want to do anything but make music, his passion simply poured out of his horn. One of the three times I’ve been in the presence of astonishing musical talent. The other two were Andre Previn…and Benny Goodman. TO BE CONTINUED. (and I’ll add a pic of the train in a few days) With thanks to my brother, Chris, for reminding me of this incident."
