        "text": "'The Duke's In Bed'\n\nThe Ellingtonians,\n\nas encountered by Steve Voce\n\nSTEVE VOCE writes about all the jazz eras from early New Orleans (he's just published a definitive piece on Johnny Dodds) to late Miles Davis (Miles gave him a drink out of his bottle of whiskey). But Duke Ellington and his music is at the heart of Steve's writings.\n\nSteve broadcast for BBC Radio for more than 50 years and for 35 of them presented his own 'Jazz Panorama' programme. During these broadcasts he would telephone jazz musicians in the United States and talk to them live on air for an hour at a time. Steve has been writing a monthly column in Jazz Journal for more than 50 years and keeps insisting to the Editor that it is time he was taken out and shot – so that his obituary could appear in The Independent newspaper, for whom he writes all the obituaries for jazz musicians. Oh, and he wrote a book on Woody Herman but, since a fortnight after publication everyone except his mother had forgotten about it, he fell back exhausted and decided never to write a book again.\n\nCarl Hällström recalled that Steve delighted the participants in a Duke Ellington conference in England with his \"THE DUKE'S IN BED\" presentation, a collection of anecdotes about various Ellingtonians. He asked Steve if he would allow his insightful writings to be \"web-published\" in Ellington on the Web, and Steve kindly agreed. We're grateful to The Independent and to Jazz Journal for permission to reproduce the pieces that appear here.\n\nThese articles are reproduced with Steve's permission and should not be reproduced without his express permission as copyright holder.\n\nEssays\n\nDUKE ELLINGTON\n\nA Cold from Little Eddie\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in March 1963\n\nadded 2011-07-24\n\nDuke Ellington, composer, pianist, band leader: born April 29, 1899, died May 24, 1974\n\nThe phone rang in Stanley Dance's home in Connecticut. The call was from London. \"This is Little Eddie. Just to let you know that we arrived all right..\"\n\nConsidering that they seem to live normally in a state of almost mindless fatigue, it is amazing that the Ellington band members manage to be so composed and sociable most of the time. Perhaps the most imperturbable of them all is baritone sax player Harry Carney. He has an elephantine memory that is almost supernatural. Standing outside the Empire in a Jacques Tati beret and overcoat, which made one wonder where he had left his motor bike, he recalled his first visit to Liverpool. 'In 1933 we stayed down that street. I think it was the second turning on the left, and their name was Jackson. I wonder if they still live there?'\n\nLater he was talking to clarinettist Jimmy Hamilton. 'I was thinking of phoning home today, but after that hotel bill last night, I can't afford it. Five quid just for bed and breakfast.'\n\n'You know why that is,' said Hamilton. 'They watch you come in through the door and they say \"This here is Harry Carney. He can pay! Jack up everything.\"'\n\nSinclair Traill, editor of Jazz Journal International, had come up to Liverpool to join me for Duke Ellington's Sunday night concert at The Empire. Jimmy took me upstairs to meet trumpeter Cootie Williams. 'Harry'll be on the phone now. Wherever we are he always calls home. If he was in Hell he'd be asking for a telephone.'\n\nClose up Cootie looks like a granite Red Indian, and his conversation, consisting mainly of grunted 'Yeah?' and 'No?' filled out the analogy. I left him cleaning his already gleaming horn, squeezed between the Rabbit and the Cat (Johnny Hodges and Cat Anderson) and went to join Sinclair in the Duke's room, which had been converted into a sanatorium - Duke had the most impressive cold that I had ever been close up to. The room was littered with Kleenex tissues and Duke was selecting his underwear for the concert from a caseful held out by his dresser.\n\n'Can you get me some fresh, unstrained grapefruit juice?' he asked me. 'A jugful?'\n\nThis presented rather a problem since the grapefruit trees in Liverpool have not even flowered yet, never mind borne fruit. However I managed to get a jugful of some kind of grapefruit juice (I suspect it was the bottled kind) and took it back to the dressing room like one of the three wise men. (Note added in 2000: the grapefruit juice resulted from a walk across Liverpool to the Adelphi Hotel. This was a Sunday and the city virtually shut down in those days of austerity. I had great difficulty in persuading the hotel people to lend me the jug. All pubs and any source of alcohol closed by 10 p.m. every night.).\n\nDuke sipped it. 'I think they strained it by mistake,' Sinclair offered.\n\n'They grow the grapefruit a bit sweet around here, too,' said Duke, sniffing the jug suspiciously.\n\nThe dressing room belonged during the week to Morecambe of Morecambe and Wise, who was appearing at the theatre in pantomime. Mr. Morecambe had left a pleasant note inviting Duke to help himself to a drink and to make use of the television set in the room. Duke switched on the television while the half bottle of gin on the table went round the room. The time was 7.30 p.m. and I realised with no little discomfort what was about to happen.\n\nAn unctuous and servile voice came out of the speaker: '.welcome you ladies and gentlemen once again to the Black and White Minstrel Show!'\n\nAnd there they were, capering about in their patchwork suits and gollywog make-up. This, I said to myself, is going to be one of those famous moments of truth. Duke and Strayhorn watched in baleful silence. Strayhorn took off his glasses, examined them, and put them back on. Suddenly the Minstrels went into 'Caravan', and George Chisholm came on.\n\n'Well produced show,' said Duke, and turned back to the problem of his underwear.\n\nA mother and daughter, whose interest in jazz must have been tenuous, suddenly appeared in the room. Apparently Duke had met them somewhere and promised them tickets for the show. All the seats were sold, so I gave them my tickets.\n\nThere followed a stormy tussle between Sinclair and the stage foreman, a belligerent and disenchanted person whom I learned to avoid years ago. His attitude was almost as cold as the stage of the theatre.\n\n'If you had wanted to borrow ten bucks and I had never met you before, these guys would show you right into my dressing room,' said Duke, 'but if you were someone important who had just come in to see the show before signing a contract or something, they'd practically come to blows keeping you out.\n\nOn stage the Ellingtonians were shivering behind the curtain. Johnny Hodges examined his alto and began calling for anti-freeze. We sat down on two stools just off-stage from the piano.\n\nDuke didn't appear backstage until the band crackled into 'A Train'. He walked briskly to the mike, did the 'we love you madly' bit, and walked briskly off-stage to our side.\n\n'Jesus!' he said. 'When they built this place they forgot to put the roof on.' He called out for spotlights to be placed to shine on the piano stool. Would someone mind going out there and breaking the ice between the piano keys?\n\nThe concert progressed more or less normally except that they left out 'Kinda Dukish' and 'Pretty and the Wolf' but added 'Mainstem'. The next day the Liverpool Daily Post said that 'Kinda Dukish' was one of the concert highlights. During the last tour the Liverpool Echo claimed that the trumpet solos of the alto saxophone player Johnny Hodges were very moving.\n\nThe big drawback about listening from the wings was that the normal bite of the sax section was a bit muffled. But this was more than compensated for the ability to hear the continuous battery of asides that goes on between the members of the band.\n\nAfter Hodges had blandly laid down three of his masterworks, he was in the process of sitting down again when Ellington called him out for another bow. While smirking politely at the audience Rabbit was muttering all the time to his boss. 'Lay off it, Dukie. Every time I bend down I can feel the ice cracking off the back of my pants.'\n\nAt the interval 'Dukie' hustled off to his room to change into ankle length underpants. The trumpet and trombone sections, who hadn't missed the goings on in the wings, gathered around Sinclair's chair, removed his flask, and emptied it. Sinclair stood in the middle in his overcoat, looking for all the world like some football coach with his team at half time. I almost expected him to produce a plate of sliced lemons from somewhere.\n\nThe teams changed ends and crashed into the second half with a heat that had obviously come from Sinclair's flask, now lying forlornly abandoned behind the piano stool.\n\n'Little Eddie', who kept bounding into the wings to give us a rundown on the state of the weather on-stage, had still not warmed up and was having constant trouble with his cold. The piano was by now full of abandoned Kleenex tissues.\n\n'Tell Stray to have my ugly pills ready when we come off,' he said as the last number approached.\n\n'Man,' said Jimmy Hamilton as they came off-stage, 'Will I be glad to get out of this freezing theatre and into that freezing coach where I can at least die in an undignified posture of my own choosing.' (The band was making the 200-mile trip back to London overnight).\n\nIn the Duke's room the Wardrobe Section were busily packing his clothes. Duke and Billy Strayhorn were discussing how best to reciprocate Mr Morecambe's gesture with the gin. The half-bottle was by now as empty as Sinclair's flask. With a little pressure Duke extracted the fact that Billy had a full bottle of gin in his bag.\n\n'This fellow has been very gracious to us,' said Duke. 'We should try to be even more gracious in return. I think you should leave the full bottle.'\n\n'Why not just refill the half from my bottle?' suggested Billy. 'There's going to come a moment of crisis on that train' (Stray and Duke were going back to London with Sinclair on the train) at about three o'clock in the morning when I'm going to need that gin.'\n\n'No,' insisted Duke. 'We must be more gracious than he. The gracious thing to do is to leave the full bottle.' (Duke doesn't drink these days).\n\n'Edward, you're being gracious as all hell with MY gin.' Stray jammed his hands in the pockets of his collarless George Melly-type corduroy suit and looked disconsolate. Harry Carney, who was going back on the coach and stood no chance with the gin either way, roared with laughter.\n\nWith Duke absorbed in his dressing, Billy cautiously refilled the half bottle and slipped his own bottle back into his bag.\n\nWe reached the Adelphi Hotel at eleven o'clock, and with customary British Railways grace (the hotel belonged to BR) the headwaiter refused to serve us. 'I have to have my staff in by seven in the morning, and I'm not keeping them back now for you.' In a second-class hotel they would have probably had the bouncer throw us out.\n\nDuke walked past as though he didn't know that the headwaiter was there (he probably didn't) and sat down at a table. Eventually a waiter arrived and Duke ordered soup, bacon and eggs 'with the eggs cooked easy', toast and 'as many kinds of jam as you've got.'\n\n'Give me my Ugly pill,' he said to Strayhorn, abandoning yet another tissue. Strayhorn produced two pills, one a murky white large enough to choke a big horse, the other (the Ugly pill) smaller and bright emerald green.\n\nDuke explained when I asked him that he had to take them to get any kind of relief from his cold, which was a really remarkable one. 'They put me in an ugly mood, and I get rude, very rude, to people I have no right to be rude to. I get very nasty, and really I shouldn't. I get very ugly.'\n\n'Come now Edward, you're not the monster you would have everyone believe you are,' said Billy.\n\n'I'm not a monster,' retorted Duke. 'You're the monster. You're a monster among monsters.'\n\n'I guess I must be a monster,' Billy agreed, 'because the king monster says I am.'\n\nEdward poked into the two plates of jam in front of him - one blackcurrant and one strawberry. He stopped a passing waitress: 'What other kinds of jam have you got? And bring me more milk and grapefruit juice.' She looked at him as though he was mad, but came back with raspberry jam, milk and grapefruit juice.\n\nBilly surveyed the remains of Duke's snack. 'The inside of your stomach will be like Chicago on St. Valentine's Day. Your germs will be tightening their hold.'\n\n'It couldn't be much tighter. These germs have got inside my lovely, lovely body and they reckon on staying there forever. They must like my piano playing.' Duke collected a huge supply of paper napkins, and I drove them to Lime Street Station. 'You should be wearing a coat,' Duke said to me at the station.\n\nI left them in the frozen station to face what transpired to be a night in a train without heat - too cold to stay in their sleepers, in fact. Three days later I had one of the most aggressive colds I have yet encountered. I took consolation in the thought that it had probably originally belonged to Little Eddie. I think I could do with some of those Ugly pills.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nLawrence For President\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in January 1963.\n\nadded 2011-08-15\n\nThis was in my column  And All That Jazz in the Jazz Journal of January 1963. Although obsessed with Dukes music since my father introduced me to it soon after I learned to walk, I wrote some foolish criticism of the maestro half a century ago when I suggested that he was wasting his time with plagiarizing the classics. I changed my mind soon after, and have indulged myself by not including those remarks here.\n\nLawrence For President\n\nThe big drawback about Duke Ellington's. orchestra is that, while it hasn't quite got everything, it has almost everything. In addition to being the man who has had the largest and most effective influence on jazz, Ellington has more top flight soloists than anyone has a right to. This means that to hear the various talents of an Ellington programme effectively one should attend at least half a dozen concerts each made up from entirely different material. Personally, I would welcome a concert featuring only the single talents of any one of the following with rhythm: Lawrence Brown, Cootie Williams, Johnny Hodges, Jimmy Hamilton or of course the Duke himself.\n\nWe have heard the band before and know what to expect in the way of material and solo numbers. However, Lawrence Brown and Cootie Williams have not visited us before, and it is to be hoped that they will be heavily featured.\n\nLawrence is one of the most exciting of contemporary musicians, and his smooth brilliance with the trombone marks him out as probably the best man playing the instrument to-day. He swings more than almost any other instrumenalist in jazz, as a cursory listening to any piece like The Tattooed Bride, Used To Be Duke,Duke's Blues or his own Caravan will confirm. I would heartily recommend you to get hold of his Clef LP \"Slide Trombone\" (Columbia 33CX 10046). I have found this storming set to be the most consistently popular album with both modernists and others who attend my jazz courses. I only wish that other volumes had been made using the same line-up.\n\nCootie is another outstanding soloist who has been disgracefully unrepresented on our record labels of late. This has been a great loss, for in such sessions as Jazztone's \"The Big Challenge\" (notable also for great Lawrence Brown) and Warner Bros.' \"Porgy And Bess Revisited\" he has combined his aggressive and biting style with colleague Rex Stewart to produce some of the most heated trumpet heard on record since his days with the Goodman band. Our friend Mr. Dance, who has lately built himself a house in the middle of the Ellington band, shares the general enthusiasm around here for Mr. Williams, and confirms that he is playing with the same colossal impact which has always typified his work.\n\nI have gone on about Jimmy Hamilton often enough in these columns. Suffice it to say that I hope we can hear some of that knocked out tenor as well as the most immaculate clarinet on the scene. Hodges and Carney are also modestly noted for being the best performers on their instruments. It may not be December, but by God it's Christmas when the Ellington band steps off that boat!\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nRex Riled Up\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in February 1963.\n\nadded 2011-08-15\n\nI have always regretted missing Rex Stewart's visit to London some years ago. Those 12\" 78s on French Blue Star give some idea of his great form at the time, to say nothing of the quartet of 10 titles on British Tempo. The other night, while helping the brewery share-holders out with George Webb and Pat Halcox, one of those tremendous dead-pan stories concerning the great cornettist came out of the Webb repertoire.\n\nGeorge was playing a club date with the Lyttelton band when Sinclair Traill suddenly appeared with Rex in tow. Rex had his horn with him and of course sat in with the band. Everyone was knocked out, particularly George, who hadn't played with an American \"name\" before.\n\nAfter a few numbers pianist Eddie Thompson came up to the side of the stand where George was playing and muttered something to the effect that it must be marvellous to play behind such a great soloist. George, always the gentleman, immediately got down and helped Eddie onto the piano stool (Eddie was blind). Rex turned and shouted some instructions to Eddie about the next number.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Eddie asked George. He said he was going to play `Indiana',\"said George.\n\nStewart beat the band in, and off they went into one of his weird half-valve features. After two choruses which were quite remarkable for their lack of co-ordination, Eddie bent to George : \"Are you sure he said `Indiana'?\" By this time both of them were quite lost.\n\nHalf a chorus later Rex turned round in mid solo, glared at Thompson, and shouted \"I said NO PIANNA!\"\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nDance of the Infidels\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in March 1964.\n\nadded 2011-08-16\n\n(I dont know what brought on my mistaken assessment of Afro Bossa. And its improved like a good wine over the years!)\n\nStanley Dance, midst a lot of strange Roman symbols which must have come off a doctor's prescription, takes a belt at all the little green men that come and run me off to strange places in little red vans (happens all the time) and my lamentable failure to choose the ten best Ellington records as the ten best records of last year.\n\nDoes my enthusiasm for Messrs. Kirk, Herman, Ledbetter, Mingus and Getz negate my membership of the mainstream club? It would seem so, for Stan invented the word and seems to have invented me out.\n\nIn fact I did, after much thought, include Afro Bossa in my ten favourites. It is a good LP, but not by any means as good as some of the Ellington output (remember Historically Speaking, Ellington Masterpieces, the Newport sets, Ellington Jazz Party, to say nothing of all the re-issues?). Judged by Ellington standards, I feel that Duke is (understandably) having a fallow period at the moment as a band-leader and, had I included re-issues in my selection, Afro-Bossa would have been one of the first to go.\n\nI prefer the best of Ellington to the best of anyone else and, in order to get this idea across, I am not prepared to say I prefer his inferior work to exciting and excellent sets as Herman 56 and the American Blues Festival.\n\nBut that won't stop me being at the front of the queue to get my tickets when Sir brings his Ellingtonians over here.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nLawrence Brown And The Plastic Tooth\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in April 1964\n\nadded 2011-08-16\n\nNormally my ventures outside of the immediate Liverpool area are confined to the annual holiday in North Wales and the odd frenzied week-end in London. However, during February last, in company with lovely Brian Moss of Billinge, Mike Flynn (Lancs. & West Cheshire Welhe Dancing Champion) and the noted atomic scientist and brains behind the Winscale disaster, Tony Hewitt, I discovered Manchester.\n\nWe made two visits, inside the week, firstly to give the Stanley Dance Foundation Jazz Lecture at the University Students' Union, and then of course to see the Duke, who for some unaccountable reason was not being presented in Liverpool.\n\nTicketless and unwanted, Brian Moss and I arrived at the Free Trade Hall an hour before the concert was due to start and began to disguise ourselves as ash-trays on the third row from the front.\n\nWe were busily sprinkling ash on our heads when Duke and Billy Stravhorn walked out to the piano. Duke, heavily muffled in overcoat, hat and scarf, sat down and began to play some variations on his introduction to \"E and D Blues\", stomping his foot and giving all appearances of enjoying himself. Stray joined in and the empty hall was filled for fifteen minutes with some of the most sparkling piano sounds I've heard for a long time. At one point two or three choruses of perfect ragtime emerged, polished enough to convince the oldest diehard.\n\nFinally abandoning the attempt at disguise, we tried bravado and walked through a flurry of autograph hunters to the artists' bar, where we found Lawrence Brown, who doesn't smoke or drink.\n\nLast time we encountered Lawrence he had lost his voice and was composed to expire during that famous winter. Then he had announced that he was all washed up as a trombonist. This time he had decided not to die, but to retire.\n\n\"The music scene is sick in the States. There are more good musicians out of work than ever before, and they've cut down on studio musicians until there's only a regular handful left. I wish I had something else I could do so I could get out of music altogether. Being with Duke is one of the best jobs, but you have to like travelling. I don't.\n\n\"When I was in the CBS studio I could be at home all the time, and you only worked a few hours a day for the basic pay. You could take night jobs and overtime rates started after only a couple of hours. But that's all gone now.\"\n\nTrying to cheer him up, I reminded him that at least he had his voice back so that he could play without any trouble.\n\n\"That's what you think. Last night I bit on a stale roll in a cafe and broke one of my front teeth - right behind my bottom lip. I had to go and have it drilled out and a plastic tooth screwed in temporarily. I haven't dared blow on it yet, but we'll know in half an hour.\"\n\nHe demonstrated this triumph, if an agonizing one, of dental engineering. From what I heard later, as with the missing voice, it made no difference whatsoever to what, for me, is the most gratifying sound in contemporary trombone.\n\n\"I don't have any feeling for this progressive sound in jazz. It leaves me cold, but then I suppose that's because it's another generation. In a few years someone will come along with something else and all these guys will be feeling like I feel now.\"\n\nIf anyone has progressed from Lawrence Brown, I'd like to hear him.\n\nBilly Strayhorn walked in to collect the Duke's pot of tea. Johnny Hodges said that nobody ever talked to him about anything except Charlie Parker and Sidney Bechet. So we talked about Stanley Dance.\n\n\"I think Stan will stay over there for life, now. He's got it made, what with his magazines and things.\" Mr. Hodges leaned on his drink.\n\n\"I hope you're right.\" I agreed. \"Much as I miss him, I've got a nice corner on the lecture thing over here.\"\n\nAfter renewing acquaintance with Jimmy Hamilton and Harry Carney (how does he remember everybody's name so precisely?) we went, by the kind machinations of Dougie Tobutt, the well-known broadcaster to some empty seats near the front, where we were joined by Danny Moss and Brian Prudence. (2011: I dont understand this reference. Dear old Dougie Tobutt was the tour manager and not a broadcaster. )\n\nThis was Ellington in excelcis and by far the best concert I have heard from him. Add the remarkable acoustic of the Free Trade Hall, and my cup was full.\n\nThe programming, omitting the vocalist and including magnificent lengthy works, with the emphasis as much on orchestration as on the soloists, recalled what one imagined the great band of the early Fifties sounded like.\n\nThe memory was heightened by the inclusion of Tone Parallel To Harlem, possibly one of the Duke's greatest works. The picture of Cootie, horn firmly pointed at the floor, poking out his notes with supreme disdain for microphones, will stay with me forever. The beautiful clarinet parts for Hamilton and Procope and Carney's unbelievable command of his horn (surely all the other baritone players are beginners?) help to emphasise that Ellington could never be ordinary.\n\nAs the fifteen-minute work crashed to its perfect conclusion in explosive applause I heard Danny Moss mutter \"Follow that, Bob Miller and the Millermen.\" I know how he felt.\n\nAfter the first house we hung around the auditorium trying to look as though we were supporting the roof, but the man came and threw us out before the second house began.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nRex For President\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in February, 1966\n\nadded 2011-08-19\n\nAs one who over the years has found that, no matter how far one moves away from it, one always returns eventually to mainstream as the most reliable and consistent form of jazz, it is not unnatural that the majority of my favourite musicians come into this category. It is in mainstream also that one has the best opportunity to test the lasting quality of a soloist's style. By virtue of the unturbulent nature of the music, most of the musicians develop their styles in a more coherent manner than elsewhere. To make a brief comparison, one might perhaps cite Stan Getz who, during the last two decades, has made two major changes in the direction of his playing, with Ben Webster, who has not found it necessary to interfere with the style he was using thirty years ago. Perhaps it is that a mainstreamer matures more quickly the painful manipulation undergone by some of the modernists (Coltrane and Rollins, for example) has sometimes resulted in the baby being dead at birth. Within the mainstream it is not satisfying to choose between favourites - who could, for example, choose one from Teagarden, Harris, Wells and Nanton to the exclusion of the others' - but there are musicians with particularly individual qualities which lift them out of the common run. The clear, unadulterated openness of Buck Clayton's work, perhaps unique in its order and precision of ideas, makes me think of Buck as my favourite. And then one will come across a masterpiece by Rex Stewart, basically so different, squeezing his material with all the muscle power of a boa constrictor and playing with what sounds like three hands and eight valves. Which leads me to my second subject.\n\nThe flow of cheap LPs continues unabated but, regrettably, some companies have used the inexpensive issues as an opportunity to unload a large quantity of junk upon an unsuspecting public. Again, some of the sleeves are misleading - for example the full face photograph of Duke taking up the entire cover of an album which contains only two tracks, and those mediocre, by one of the Duke's lesser bands. And the ever-reissued early works of Ray Charles, surely not meriting the obvious attraction which they must have to followers of Ray's current output.\n\nSo, it comes as a pleasure to be able to welcome an excellent and obscure album on Allegro ALL 77o. The pleasure is doubled by the fact that the fine little sextet is under the leadership of Rex Stewart, and the whole disc hides its light under a bushel with the off-putting title, The Golden Era Of Dixieland Jazz. Rex leads Buster Bailey, Vic Dickenson, Marty Napoleon, Milt Hinton and George Wettling through High Society, Yellow Dog Blues, South Rampart Street, Ja-Da, Jazz Me Blues, Marty's Blues, Weary Blues and Blues.\n\nThe music is of a high mainstream level, with good solos and well thought-out ensembles, giving an impression of good jazz played by great jazzmen, which is exactly what it is. I haven't heard Buster Bailey, one of the most accomplished jazz clarinettists, so well represented on any post-war album, and Dickenson also sounds very relaxed and at home in this group. His solo work on Ja-Da is of his best. But the record belongs to Rex, greatest cornettist in the world and probably the most consistently energetic and creative brass man that jazz has produced. His eccentric style is well displayed here, particularly on the magnificent blues solo on Yellow Dog, the nearest thing I have heard to his French recording of Mobile Bay - as far as I am concerned the greatest display of muted technique that I know of. This is certainly going to be a hard year for British trumpet men, with Rex, Bill Coleman, Buck Clayton and Red Allen all lined up for visits.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nOne Doesn't Snap One's Finger's On The Beat\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in April 1966\n\nadded 2011-08-19\n\nA hundred shillings for bed and breakfast!' The Ellingtonians were looking aghast at the bills which the Liverpool hotel had issued to them in advance. Lawrence Brown was fatalistic about the whole thing, and obviously regarded it as a mere extension of the ill-fortune which had made him a musician in the first place. I'm happy to report that he is still playing as well as ever, and still claiming loudly that his career is at an end, his lip is ruined, and that he could never play the trombone anyway. 'All the muted work has ruined my lip.'\n\n'A hundred shillings!' Sam Woodyard suggested that there had been some mistake. He hadn't wanted to buy the place, just to stay there for the night.\n\nI had just met Sinclair Traill from the London train, and quite by chance we encountered the band, which had just arrived. We joined the members who were taking afternoon tea in the lounge; Jimmy Hamilton, Johnny Hodges and Sam Woodyard. The next tables were occupied by Paul Gonsalves and the Duke himself. Paul stared in mute fascination at the Palm Court trio which was entertaining the waiters and those who waited. The conversation returned to the hotel bill. 'You pay more for the good service,' I suggested. We had already been sitting there for fifteen minutes and had not succeeded in having our order taken. Even Duke couldn't get a waiter.\n\nThe trio wailed away, and the waiters stayed away. 'That is one crazy double,' said Hodges, raising a cynical eyebrow at the gentleman who played clarinet and cello. After another ten minutes he got up and left, leaving me instructions to order a large gin and water for him, if finally a waiter was discovered. Jimmy Hamilton was hungry, and most of the band seemed to have been without food for some time. 'I'd like some sandwiches, chicken and ham, please.' A waiter had eventually arrived, looking startled. 'There's no sandwiches sir, only bridge rolls.' He suggested that they wait until six o'clock when dinner would be available. The first concert began at six-thirty. Finally it was agreed, after some discussion, that the waiter would arrange to have some sandwiches created.\n\nJohnny returned to the gin, and began telling us about his latest albums, including one with Earl Hines made on January 18. 'I guess I could make a living just doing albums and the occasional tour with someone like Wild Bill Davis. 'It takes about three days to make an album, and pays a couple of hundred dollars and royalties. If I worked on records for other leaders as well, I could do quite nicely. I just did an album with Lawrence Welk, you know. He asked me to join the band full-time, but it'd mean me living in Hollywood. Those guys have a nice job, mainly studio work, and three months off a year when you can do what you want. I could make my albums and maybe do a few club jobs and things. But I don't know, I've been with Duke a long time now....' Sinclair left to chat Duke up about playing Carolina Shout as a piano solo (Duke did at the first house, and Sinclair scored a lot of unlooked-for points by not being there). Johnny paid for his gin, and I paid for the two cups of tea and the coffee-'That'll be ten shillings, sir,' 'Like you were saying,' said Johnny, 'you pay more for the good service.' I noticed that no one left a tip.\n\nBand call was at five-thirty, so we left them to it, and went in search of food for ourselves. We arrived at the University just in time to be told by Johnny, with vindictive glee, that Duke had played Carolina Shout especially for Sinclair, and would doubtless be most offended that Sinclair wasn't there. A flushed Sinclair suggested that his absence should be kept a secret from the Duke.`Too late.' said Johnny with satisfied finality. 'I already told him!' 'Blast! And I thought that all we were missing was you playing that damned Magenta Haze nonsense.' I left them to score points off each other and went to introduce some of my friends to Harry Carney, who is the nicest person I know to introduce people to. I asked him about the long-note technique (he holds a note for a couple of minutes during his feature on Sophisticated Lady) and he confirmed that, like Roland Kirk, he inhales through his nose while actually playing the note.\n\n'It's a thing I've been doing for years. It's not new by any means. Buster Bailey used to do it on clarinet - you may have heard John Kirby's record of St. Louis Blues. He does it there. I don't think Barney Bigard ever developed it. He had a natural technique which helped him to hold long notes - on the 1938 New Black And Tan Fantasy he climbs up to a very high note behind Tricky Sam as Sam begins his solo, and holds the note throughout the solo. Then, at the end of Sam's bit, Barney still has enough breath to do one of his sweeping runs down. But I think it was just breath control.' (If you watch Carney on Sophisticated Lady you can see his cheeks empty and fill again during the note).\n\nSean Lewis of the Students' Entertainment Committee, who was the organiser of the concert, had frightened everyone to death by not sending out the complimentary tickets until a couple of days before the concert. However, he had very kindly given Eddie Lambert and me magnificent seats on the fourth row. This generous gesture was unfortunately spoiled by the fact that Jack McNamara had pinched my seat. Sinclair and I found spare seats in the direct line of fire from Harry's baritone, which transpired to be a distinct improvement.\n\nI only heard one concert (as I write this I should be attending two more in Manchester, but have unfortunately succumbed to horse-'flu, the disease to which we Northerners are so prone), but found it a huge improvement on the last tour. Regrettably Cootie Williams had been taken to a local hospital with severe haemerrhoids and his solos were very much missed. But the three-piece trumpet section filled out nicely, and I for one didn't miss the fourth horn here. Sinclair, who had heard Cootie earlier in the tour, said that he missed the fourth horn in the section. 'How in hell could you miss it when I didn't?' asked Russ Procope afterwards.\n\nMy good friend Eddie Lambert will be reviewing the concerts he heard elsewhere, so I will restrict myself to a few comments on the music. For me the best thing in the programme, and I hope that it will soon be recorded, was La Plus Belle Africaine, a long piece with the best solos of the night for me coming from Jimmy Hamilton and Harry Carney. As I mentioned before, we were sitting at the side of the band and in a position where we were bathed in the sound of Carney's baritone. There is no one in the world who can make the big sax respond so well, With that rich tone of his he is so far beyond reach of anyone else that one can't credit that he has actually been beaten on occasion by other baritone players in the popular polls. I don't know whether his solo on La Plus Belle was written for him or improvised, but it ranks with his best, being very strongly constructed and exquisitely played. Hamilton had one long solo here, a model of technical expertise and good jazz, but elsewhere, as usual, didn't have enough to do. While I thoroughly enjoyed all Gonsalves' solos, he did get more than his share, and I felt that a couple of his numbers could well have been given to Hamilton's tenor and clarinet instead. Other highlights came from the despondent Mr. Brown, some nice clarinet from Russ Procope, and there was a virtuoso evening from Cat Anderson, who triumphed both as a soloist and as a tower of strength in the section. His muted solos, 'Cootian' in concept, were perfectly orientated, and anyone who had thought of him as being lacking in taste was given a powerful awakening at this concert. Duke played Carolina Shout again for Sinclair and gave it a rough and striding treatment which brought back vivid memories of Fats and James P.\n\nWoodyard, with whom we had earlier given it one, was in effervescent mood and made frequent ecstatic comments throughout the show, obviously not realising that he was very close to a mike. At one point he sang a very convincing blues vocal behind one of Duke's solos which could well have been used as a feature.\n\nCarolina Shout had him laughing and shouting away merrily. As he told us afterwards, 'I love all that old-time whorehouse music!' Lawrence Brown showed what a poor job he makes of not being able to play with a mute by treading in Tricky's footsteps with much fire and bite. He also displayed the great damage which his lip has not sustained from not being able to play with a mute during various beautiful open solos, including a nice run out on Don't Get Around Much Any More as part of the Medley. The selection from Black, Brown And Beige seemed to have been re-worked slightly since the band's last visit, and was a successful editing of the original. The three-piece trumpet section did wonders with the finale.\n\nThe delightfully rejuvenated Medley and Black, Brown And Beige were a kind of bonus for a wildly enthusiastic and very youthful audience who had gone berserk when it seemed that the concert was likely to come to an end. Duke, bending to the microphone, bid them silence. The band have asked me to pass on a request to you, he said. May we please play you an encore?\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nMemoirs Of A Scaffolder's Knee-Wrencher\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in July 1966\n\nadded 2011-08-19\n\nSince I feel that neither Buck Clayton nor Rex Stewart were given anything like the space which they merited in the dailies, Sundays or jazz publications, the rest of this column is about them.\n\nRex is a deep personality, proud of his record in jam. but undervaluing his contribution to the music, nonetheless. Unlike most of the established greats, he has a profound interest in jazz. its backgrounds and developments, and he speaks with great vehemence and clarity on this subject. One of the things he most wanted to do while over here and one of the things which unfortunately no one asked him to do, was to give a talk on jazz. His articles in Down Beat and in this magazine have been excellent in the way in which they have compacted so much relevant information (which only Rex has) and the writing style has been so direct and coherent that I felt they must have been ghosted. In fact this is not the case and Rex writes all his own material.\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet him on three separate occasions and to spend several hours with him on each occasion. (Incidentally. a small, but important reflection on his character is the fact that he insists, on one occasion to the point of anger, in standing his round or on standing someone else's as well). Rex tells me that the Allegro Golden Era Of Dixieland was recorded in 1960 and that the bassist is Arvell Shaw. His playing was its own testimonial and I think that he displayed more variety of mood and dexterity than most of the visitors, weve had. The rumbustious half-valve features and the regrettably sparse appearance of the mutes established his claim in the development of the jazz trumpet (although he meticulously insists that he plays cornet, one feels that it would be incidental to such a great if he played) Burmese prayer horn.\n\nOne always thinks of Rex as having influenced people like Terry, Davis, Brown and Navarro and so on but, on hearing his lip-searing runs and entire application of energy to the horn, one realises that from the same fount have sprung Charlie Shavers, Cat Anderson, and, more obviously, Ray Nance and Taft Jordan.\n\nRoy Eldridge is regarded as the prime-mover reflected in Gillespie, in modern jazz trumpet. In fact Rex has influenced far more of the younger players, and to a greater degree. But in terms of the passing years his style requires no classification for, like so many of the great Ellingtonians, it is completely timeless.\n\nMeeting Rex gave me one of the greatest pleasures in my jazz experience, and I am looking forward with great enthusiasm to swapping tapes with him. I have already compiled one with many questions for him and hope, when the answers arrive, to write an article to complement the excellent piece by Bernard Houghton which appeared in our May issue.\n\nHere beginneth the campaign to get Rex back again next year. If readers would affirm their wish to see him again on a postcard to me I will see that their cards are put to best effect.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nHarold Shorty Baker remembered by Clark Terry\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in January 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-22\n\n(Shorty had died in New York on November 8, 1966. He was only 52.)\n\nEverybody loved Shorty, I can't start to tell you just how he will be missed around the New York scene. You see he was one of those real lovable guys; wherever Shorty was, there was laughter. He was always making jokes, even when things weren't at their best. He even made a joke when I went to see him in hospital. He had had that terrible operation, and his voice was husky and barely audible – you had to bend over to hear what he was saying. 'I'm going to beat this thing', he said. `I don't sound no worse than some of those old blues singers, now do I?'\n\nAnd he did beat it, you know. When everybody had given him up for dead, Shorty made it out of that hospital. All he wanted to do, was to play his horn again. When, just recently, he knew he wasn't ever going to be able to play again, then I think he kinda gave up. But not so long ago I was playing at Embers West and in he came and asked if he could sit in. Of course we were delighted and made room for him at once. He played that night with all his old fire and that beautiful pure tone, which was his alone. No one has ever achieved a tone like that - and I should know for he was my inspiration from the beginning. We came from the same town, St. Louis, and Shorty Baker was the man I always listened to, when he was back home in between going on the road with such bands as Fate Marable, Erskine Tate and Don Redman. He played with so many good bands, for he was an excellent section man, and they all loved having him around because as I said he was such a happy, humorous man. He was with Teddy Wilson when Teddy had that big band, he played with Andy Kirk, and of course married Andy's pianist, Mary Lou Williams, and I really can't count the times he was with Duke Ellington - he was always coming and going. Duke always welcomed him `home' when he returned to the band, because he was the perfect trumpeter to give the right expression to Duke's music. A lyrical player, you know, with the clearest tone imaginable and such impeccable taste. He was certainly one of the most popular players ever to play with the Ellington band; he always kept them in good humour.\n\nI remember once Duke's band was on one of those long, long road gigs. Up early every morning, get in that bus, travel hundreds of miles, play a dance or a concert, but mostly dances in those days, until the early hours and then drop into bed - which was often enough your seat on the bus. Musicians are apt to get a bit salty under these conditions - lack of sleep, lack of food and lack of everything else that makes life worth living. But not Shorty! He was always in there with a smile and a joke.\n\nI remember on this particular trip, we had been on a particularly tough stretch, the places we had played had been hundreds of miles apart. One night having slept in the bus, it was discovered that the food bought at our last stop had been left behind. Everyone was dragged. No breakfast and no chance of a stop  there was no time. `Never mind' smiled Shorty, 'now's the time to open up that parcel my mother sent me. That lovely fried chicken and those luscious devilled eggs - plenty for all!' It was all a gag of course, but Shorty was able to make everyone feel just that little bit better.\n\nPart of the reason for that personal tone of his was the fact that he always used a Hein mouthpiece. It was a very unusual mouthpiece, very deep and thin, maybe only an eighth of an inch in thickness. It was made in St. Louis and not everyone could play with one. Miles Davis had one, which he lost, and has never been able to replace. I used to have one too. Shorty always had his.\n\nSt. Louis, you know, is a town celebrated for trumpet players. Always has been from the start. Dewey Jackson, a wonderful player, whom I heard when I was a kid. Charlie Creath, the man they knew as 'The King of the Cornet', Levi Madison and Crack Stanley, two more great players. The brothers Wendell and Marvin Black, Joe Thomas and of course Miles Davis. All really great trumpet players. Well, some of them have gone now, some of the real good ones, but wherever they are I know they will welcome Shorty - because there was never a better trumpet player to come out of St. Louis, that city of trumpet players, than Harold 'Shorty' Baker.'\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nClark In The Dark: Night Fast Out Of Algeria\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in February 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-22\n\nHow dyou get Hawk to smile? the exasperated photographer asked Clark Terry. Ill make him smile. Said Clark. He walked over to where Hawk, looking sheepish and unhappy, stood with his arm awkwardly draped over the photographers friend. `Money, Hawk, said Clark, Big, big money. Hawks face lit up.\n\nClark had been telling us about that infamous Mingus session at the Town Hall which had been both a recording session and a concert and yet not really either. `I felt a fool because I was the only one in evening dress, I think Charlie was wearing jeans, because he hadnt known there would be an audience. Anyway, the whole thing fell apart musically as well, and finally Charlie called me down front and told me to play something. What shall I play: I asked, and he said I dont know, play anything. And thats why one track on the LP was called Clark In The Dark. I was, too.\n\nThis led to talk of big bands, and Dizzy Gillespie said how much hed like to have a large group again. If someone would only take the responsibilities of running it, theres nothing Id like better. Id love to tour England with a big band. Someone suggested that it would have to be an American band. Dont kid yourself, said Diz. You English undervalue your musicians more than anyone else. British musicians are as good as any in the world, and Id prefer to tour with an English group. If Mr Higgins thought it was a proposition, Mr Tobutt could certainly do the hard work.\n\nMeanwhile Hawk had finished being photographed and was talking about that excellent pianist, Eddie Costa. That kid would have been a great piano player if hed lived. He was kind of wild, but I always liked to work with him. He was killed in a car smash one night when he was coming home from someplace in the wrong direction from where he was supposed to have been. I made some records with him. (Costa plays notably on the deleted but worth looking for Coleman Hawkins and His Orchestra, a quintet session on Eros ERL 50024).\n\nClark Terry told its about the latest Terry-Brookmeyer album, which has Hank Jones on piano. We asked how the earlier albums were selling.\n\nHell, I dont know, and I dont care. We dont bother about royalties, we try to get as much as we can in a lump sum from the companies, and then they can keep the royalties. We want the money NOW!\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nBuck And Ben, The Powerhouse Men\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in March 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-22\n\nHearing Ben Webster on form, as we did during his recent tour of the north, is an extravagant and unique jazz experience. Ben's playing is so substantial that it is almost a food upon which one dines in splendid profusion. In this mood he disarms any criticism and displays such individual strength of character that he transcends any categorization. It is not possible to compare him with any other player since, although he might have much in common with, say, Hawk. The singular blending of Webster's component elements puts him out on his own. Whereas someone like Rollins or Coltrane might effect a purging of the listener's emotions, Ben adds to them and has a relaxing and at the same time stimulating effect. Webster is by nature an especially relaxed man, who always looks faintly surprised and who never seems to get particularly upset about anything.\n\nAfter Mike Davison had presented him at Liverpool University with Ronnie Scott and Stan Tracy, Ben had a couple of hours to kill before his train for London, so we took him to the Liverpool Press Club.\n\nBen has now settled in Amsterdam, having been a European for three years now. He has put on a little weight but exudes an air of great fitness, probably due to the fact that he doesn't get upset and knows how to enjoy life. The extra weight is credited to the exceptional cooking of Mrs. Hartlooper, Ben's land-lady. who makes a point of seeing that he eats plenty. There is little jazz in the city and neither Ben nor Don Byas, who also lives there with his family, work locally at all.\n\n`We're hoping that these two cats who work for Dutch radio are going to manage to start a jazz club, but apart from that, there's nothing like that, because it means you can come back off a tour, maybe with a bad hang-over, slink into Amsterdam and rest up and get well without any fuss.'\n\nThe Antibes Festival last summer seemed to have been a good place for acquiring hangovers. Ben played there with Duke, as did Ella and Ray Nance.\n\n'The trouble was that Duke wouldn't tell me what we were going to play. I kept asking him about it, but he just kept saving 'Don't worry, baby, you got it'. Hell, I was worried because I didn't know his book, and I'm rusty on a lot of the things we used to do. Anyway, eventually I said 'Own up, Guv'nor' and he said 'Oh it's just a few simple things, like A Train in waltz time.' So I told him hell, Duke, I can't even play the thing as it's written.'\n\nOne spectacular number from Antibes was High Passage, an up-tempo feature for the tenors of Ben, Paul Gonsalves and Jimmy Hamilton. 'We were supposed to take fours at the end, but we got mixed up, and every time I got to my turn it seemed like Ray just beat me to it.'\n\nSome of the concert was broadcast, including an extended All Too Soon featuring Ben with Lawrence Brown, and a hilarious and stomping It Don't Mean A Thing with Ray duetting with Ella and apparently at one point where she sings 'Rain, rain go away,' getting a little too close.\n\nBen, as is by now well known, is something of an expert on piano jazz, and a lot of his friends are pianists. 'Like Ralph Sutton. He lives up in the mountains behind San Francisco. You drive for miles up this narrow winding road. hoping to hell you don't slip over the edge, and then finally you get to this beautiful house of his. You sit out on the patio getting well on all that mountain air, and then Ralph's wife puts some Fats on the hi-fi (she knows I'm a sucker for that) and you sit in the sun listening to Fats. That's living!\n\n'The album I did with Art Tatum? Well, really I shouldn't have been on that album. Nobody should ever have recorded with Art because he did everything himself. He could say it all better than anyone that ever played with him, and there was so much inside him that he could never be an accompanist.\n\n'The best accompanying piano I ever had was Oscar Peterson. He's what we call a feeding pianist. He listens to the horn men and seems to know exactly what they're going to play and sets it up for them instinctively. I never saw anyone as keen on music as Oscar and Ray Brown. They were always working on something or going over something to make it better. I remember being on a JATP tour with them and, at every concert, when the curtains went down for the interval, they'd be there behind the curtain rehearsing something, right through till the concert began again. They'd be at it before the concert and after it as well. That was a great partnership. and I'm sorry it's broken up.\n\n'They were the easiest people to record with, too. I've been on some sessions where they've had to make up to a dozen takes of a number. But not with Oscar and Ray – one was near always enough. They'd be bent together over the piano whispering away together. and then Oscar'd say 'Okay, Frog. Let's make it.' We'd do it in one. All my sessions with Oscar were very happy ones.'\n\nIn unhurried fashion we trundled down to Lime Street Station for the 12.30 (Ronnie and the band had gone by road) and got Ben nicely settled into a sleeper.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nJaws And Frog And Things\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in June 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-22\n\nWe remember something from the mists of childhood about somebody getting brained with the jaw of an ass. And Jaws certainly blew that off everyone in sight.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that Lockjaw could ever have an off-night and, with due respect to the excellent tenors who shared the recent concert tour it's impossible to imagine a situation where Jaws could ever be carved. His playing sounds constantly inspired and one thought, at the Free Trade Hall concert, that his sound would have blistered the chrome off the mike. As far as his ballads were concerned, Moonlight In Vermont and On A Clear Day You Can See Forever, extended the great tradition of the tenor balladeers. Buck Clayton reckons that, for sheer playing, Budd Johnson can blow the jawbone of an ass off anything. In such a heady league it is invidious to prefer one man to another, but I'll take Jaws. Hearing him on the same programme as Ben Webster was another remarkable thing. Ben was Jaw's idol in the early days, and Jaws has in fact developed from the Webster of the Forties, his playing being characterised by the storming approach that Ben used then. But Frog, on the other hand, has mellowed over the years and he's developed his own bag in his own way. To hear his economic and yet lyrical style is a lesson in jazz. He showed his perfection in Perdido with Bud Freeman, with Ben playing the obligatto to Bud's statement of the theme. Once again we saw from Ben the micro-second timing which only the greatest jazz men have. Each note was of perfect duration and intonation.\n\nFreeman himself was better on this tour than at any time we have heard him, and his own high spot of the show was a fresh and rhapsodic workout on It's Wonderful, a lovely number which Hackett and Teagarden used to do. Bud was very convincing in the two and four tenor things, and the contrast of the various styles was particularly in his favour. His partnership with Webster was very satisfactory, and someone might one day make an LP of the two together. An LP of their conversation would be rewarding, because they fit each other perfectly from this angle, too. Ben never leads a conversation, he just provides the fill-ins, and I could have listened all night to the fascinating double concerto they built between them. Bud, still everyone's best friend and the greatest anglophile of all, thoroughly enjoyed this tour, and was relieved to be free of the 'guidance' of the previous one. (2011 -Guidance is presumably a reference to the way Earl Hines took to himself the leadership of the Jazz From A Swinging Era unit. This was a group of equals and some of the others, notably Roy Eldridge, were incandescent at the way Earl assumed on-stage authority over them. The only thing that stopped Roy leaving in mid-tour was the urging of Buck Clayton not to. Louis Armstrong had a similar experience with Hines. I dont give a damn, said Louis. Hines and his ego, ego, ego! If he wanted to go, the hell with him. Hes good, sure, but we dont need him.).\n\nEddie Miller delighted the audience with his spot, and lived up to the things we said about him in last month's column.\n\nPerhaps the happiest moment of the show was during the final blues with all the tenors up. This was a Jaws number and, at the end of the first chorus, all four stepped up simultaneously to take the first solo. The result was a quite remarkable and unintentional improvised ensemble that lasted for four bars before Jaws won and took the solo.\n\nAfterwards we went tip to the Club 43 with Lockjaw. Ben and Phil Seamen. The Club 43 Big Band, a new organisation, was playing some Basie-slanted music when we arrived and, although there is some polishing to be done, the band is well worth listening to and has a nice swing with it. Surprisingly Ernie Garside was in the trumpet section, and he proved to be quite good, although not yet quite up to the Conrad Gozzo standard. He took a solo that allows us to tell Dizzy that he can take it easy because he's got some time yet, but the whole thing was very promising.\n\nIn search of food, we found some tinned ravioli and canned Eric Scriven in the kitchen. 'Has it got meat in it?' asked Ben. and no one knew for sure whether he meant Eric or the ravioli. I assumed he meant the ravioli and said yes. 'Then I'll eat it.' Jaws wanted a brandy, but he had to have milk with it. Eric produced a brandy bottle full of milk. Funny chap. 'Back in the Forties, all the younger guys, including me, worshipped Ben,' Lockjaw sipped the brandy. 'No one else played like that, and we all wanted to pick up on it. We'd go to hear Ben every night with whichever band he was with. I always remember that in those clubs the musicians weren't supposed to drink on the stand. The manager would tell Ben no drinking, and Ben would be good as gold and say 'Yes, I quite understand,' and then, when the guy moved away, Ben got out the sneaky bottle from under his music stand.'\n\nBy now Ben's food was as hot as a Lee Konitz solo, but he carried on eating. When he'd finished he asked if there was a billiard table in the club. There wasn't. 'After tenor, I suppose my thing is pool. My uncle back in K.C. owned a poolroom and when I was just a kid he took me in there and left me with the best players for them to teach me the game.\n\n'Really I like billiards best, but I'm so lazy it's no good to me.' We couldn't follow the reasoning. and asked why. 'Well, with pool or snooker you've got lots of balls on the table and when you hit them into the pocket they stay there. With billiards every time you pot one you've got to walk round the table and pick it out and set it back on the cloth. Man, you can get tired that way.\n\n'Anyway, after a lot of lessons from those guys in K.C. I got to be pretty good, and I could beat most people. But it's a game where you have to concentrate very hard. Once you lose your concentration you should give up.\n\n'I met the Dutch champion in a bar in Amsterdam recently, and we had a few games. He beat me, only just, in the first two, and I knew I wasn't concentrating. So I said 'Right. This time I'm going to beat you', and we started off again. Sure enough I concentrated, and I got well ahead. One break was all I needed to win, and then he caught me with the oldest trick in the world. 'Let's leave the game for a minute and have a little taste.' So, always a friendly fellow, I said 'Okay,' and we had our taste. What he'd done was break my concentration, and sure enough we went back to the game and I missed the break, and he snuck up from behind and won.'\n\nThe next day we rang up Jack Higgins and suggested that, with Ben, Lockjaw and Buck in the country together,it would be a sin of omission not to make an LP. 'I've just this minute come off the phone to Fontana. We're making an album with Buck, Ben and Bill Coleman and the Welsh rhythm section.' Half a loaf is better than the jawbone of an ass ... (Unfortunately. due to his illness, Buck couldnt make the session and it went on without him).\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nRex Stewarts Death\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in October 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-22\n\nAlthough his visits to this country were rare and in fact he spent most of his time thousands of miles away from us, Rex Stewart was a very dear close friend of at least three of us at Jazz Journal. Consequently his death in this very sad year comes as more of a shock even than the loss of Ed Hall and Willie Smith.\n\nIn recent years, because he couldn't get the chance, Rex did not play as much as he would have liked to, and consequently his contributions in musical form were not by any means as great as they had been for the twenty years up to 1948. His tour here last year was not the success he so much wanted it to be, partly because of lack of practice, but also because he was so anxious that his concerts should be successful, that he built up a nervous tension which made it impossible for him to relax. He barely slept at all throughout the tour because he worried so much. Rex could not believe that most people were familiar with his classic recordings, and felt that he had to try to compete with modern jazzmen, and consequently he concentrated on the flashy and showy aspects of his work. Only under pressure would he bring forth that eloquent mute, and even then the results were not always what he or the audience would have wished.\n\nAt the Festival Hall concert that ended his tour I begged him, during the finale, to use the mute, knowing that a chorus of his pungent and penetrating blues style would knock the audience on its ear. He agreed half-heartedly, for by this time he was convinced that no one in England wanted to hear him play. It was a case, as far as he was concerned, of what the hell, anyway. Disastrously, when his chorus came, he blew a comic and pungent note through the mike, and repeated the process each four bars until his chorus finished- he had played nothing.\n\nHome again in the States, he became more philosophical, particularly since, with the tour and slightly more work at home, his lip was now in good shape. He badly wanted to come back here for another tour, this time with Humphrey Lyttelton, whom he admired greatly (he also at this time, wanted to set up a booking agency run by European and American musicians to ensure fair treatment and wages, and he had intended to approach Humph as a key man for such a project).\n\nIn his last year his letters revealed a deep melancholy. He felt again that, while he knew he was in good shape and had much to play, no one wanted to hear him. He was cheered momentarily by the chance, earlier this year, to play again with Barney Bigard but, having lost his job as a radio announcer last year - a job which he loved and valued, he turned to writing as his main support.\n\nRex, eccentric soloist, dependable sideman and, at times, creator of jazz masterpieces that will live as long as the music itself, had good human values. He was a man without pretence and, despite the fact that he lived for jazz and had given so much to it, a man who never overrated his own work.\n\nI will always remember his account of a long car journey with three other jazz musicians, including Buck Clayton. The other two men, often vain and always garrulous about their own achievements, talked throughout the journey of what they had done, what they were about to do and how they had just had personal triumphs with the audience they had just played to.\n\n'Buck and me,' wrote Rex, 'sat in the back and never said a word the whole trip. We just switched off our brains. I guess we don't have the star temperament.' Somewhere at his home in California there should be the manuscript of a near-completed book on his life in jazz. I hope that it can be found and published.\n\nI am sure that his close friends, Dickie Wells, Ben Webster, Buck Clayton, Duke Ellington, Hilton Jefferson, Coleman Hawkins and all the others, will find the news of Rex's death as hard to absorb as we do. Rex means 'King'. It sounds like a fair description.\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nFrog And Mumbles\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in December 1967\n\nadded 2011-08-21\n\nUnfortunately, due to time spent getting accustomed to the new drinking laws (the early signs of a pot which I had acquired are diminishing rapidly) I missed the week which the Maynard Ferguson band had at the Club 43. By all reports this was sensational, and far superior to the touring Ferguson group. Maynard, who is a member of the Bradford branch of the M.U. (wow!) is at present living at Ernie Garside's home and coaching the Club 43 big band as well as giving Ernie trumpet lessons.\n\nThey serve an excellent glass of shandy at the 43, so I went over one night to hear Ben Webster coasting easily through a couple of sets. During the Expo thing Ben and Budd Johnson were unfortunate enough to have their hotel rooms burgled - the burglar came back a second time when Ben was still in bed and was unsuccessfully pursued by a pyjama-clad Frog down the hotel corridors. Clark Terry, in another hotel, wasn't quite sure about his role in the Thelonious Monk Big Band, since Monk had unexpectedly brought Ray Copeland over. In the event both Clark and Phil Woods had one solo each &Ndash; since I had to miss the concert, this gave me a negative pleasure. (A note, posted in London, arrived the next day from Clark, addressed to Liverpool, England, and heavily marked \"AIR MAIL\"). Clark brought me test pressings of some of his recent sessions. One notably outrageous one being from a session in September last featuring him with an electric trumpet (accompaniment by Don Friedman, Ron Carter and Dave Bailey). Fearing the worst, we were delighted to find that this is the most innocuous of the electronic beasts, and one hears Clark's natural tone throughout. Added effects are in held notes and in a great extension of range into previously unheard depths. On sonic tracks the instrument gives the impression of a second horn playing just behind and below the first. Only someone like Clark could have carried off such an innovation without compromising, and his remarkable jazz abilities are all shown off on these tracks.\n\nElectric Mumbles has Terry conducting a verbal argument with his horn in an incredibly relaxed fashion, and bubbles with humour. His pungent blues singing seems to come so easily to him, and it is masterly in its inventiveness and hilarious in its sociological destruction. There's some nice piano on this track from Don Friedman. Take The A Train has even better singing, with Clark again conducting an argument between two people on a train. The other tracks are Secret Love, Grand Canyon Suite and two Terry originals, Take Me Back To Elkhart and Tee Pee Time, this latter for Tony Perry of Chicago, who is Clark's unofficial discographer. The album was produced for ABC Paramount by Bob Thiele and will be issued under the title 11), What's Happenin' - Clark Terry.\n\nOne or two American visitors hate been worried about the possibility of their work over-exposed in this country. Its a thought that should never be considered Terry's case and I hope that, like Buck Clayton, he will fall into the habit of visits. He is without doubt one of the most consistent and rewarding of to-day's jazz soloists.\n\nI mentioned the electrocuted Clark to Ben Webster.\n\nThe guy came to me about one of those things. He said it would suit my sound and Id be able to do a whole lot of things I can't do now, which was nice of him. I just said yeah, you think so? (Benny Carter always told me to tell an idiot just what he wants to hear).\n\n`But hell, man! You spend forty years just getting your own sound and then some guy invents a way to take it away and expects you. to jump at it.'\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nRexatious\n\nA THREE PART SUMMARY OF THE WORK OF REX STEWART\n\nPart 1 (by Steve Voce and, in part 1 only, Anne Judd)\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in February 1968\n\nadded 2011-08-23\n\nOver recent years the changes in jazz have accelerated at a previously unknown rate, partly due to the rapid emergence (and frequent subsequent rejection) of so many young musicians and, sadly, due to the fact that so many mature musicians of great stature have died. Of the eighteen established jazz musicians who died in 1967, none had made a greater contribution to jazz nor loved it more than Rex Stewart and yet, despite his lifelong devotion to the music, he died frustrated by it – a man taken for granted rather than neglected. No one realised with more urgency than he that part of the history of jazz is lost with each man who has played and developed the music, and, during his last years, he was successfully recapturing much of that history in his writings. He was a moody person who could change from anger to gaiety in a flash and who was, despite the pride he felt (modest in the light of his achievements) much subject to self-doubt. It was his intense sensitivity that supplied him with the roots of his musical brilliance. He was also the father of a trumpet style that occasionally raced away from him in its development and had a much more profound effect on trumpeters who came afterwards than is generally acknowledged.\n\nHe died of a sudden heart attack in the Los Angeles home of his closest friend Claire Gordon on September 7, 1967. His health had not been good, but his constitution, like his will to scuffle and keep going, appeared flexibly strong. The city had just suffered through an unparalleled heat wave with temperatures over 100, polluted air, the humidity absent one day then brutally tropical the next, and it seems likely that this climate brought on the heart attack. It had been a bad year all through for Rex. He suffered innumerable disappointments: an article on the old Savoy ballroom was rejected by the magazines; he wasn't getting the newspaper assignments he'd hoped for; he wasn't able to arrange the much-wanted European tour; the radio station he had broadcast for was sold, abandoning its all-jazz policy; a benefit concert he'd played was not booked on the college circuit as he'd hoped; a barbecue jam session in August failed to make money, and then his last two teeth gave out.\n\nRex was not a Christian, but something of a mystic (his grandmother was a full-blooded Delaware Indian, and he believed that he had inherited a sixth sense from her) and his will specified, in lieu of funeral services 'If a few of my friends wish to join my family in a few toasts to me on my continued journey, I direct expenses for such food and drink to be paid for by my estate. And please eat, drink and be merry because we shall be together again.' Much of Rex is revealed in these two sentences: the simple eloquence, the grand gesture modestly put, is obvious, but so also is the tentativeness 'If a few wish .' He once remarked 'I have to remember I was the third trumpeter in an important band, that's all.' Appropriately Rex's greatest achievements were with the Duke Ellington band over a period (1934-44) when Ellington was probably at the height of his powers. Consequently he is always thought of first as an Ellingtonian, remembered for classic performances like Morning Glory and his own Poor Bubber. But, had he never been an Ellingtonian, his work away from Duke, both before and after, is sufficient to mark him as one of the great individualists. He was, for instance, a member of the Fletcher and Horace Henderson bands for over four years at a time when Fletcher and Ellington dominated the big band field. It was here that he formed his life-long friendship with Coleman Hawkins and, although Rex was not the giant that Hawkins was, their partnership was to produce many memorable performances over the ensuing forty years. Although by no means complete, Stewart's work with Henderson is fairly well represented on five LPs - 'Smack' (Ace Of Hearts AH 41) and the four-volume 'A Study In Frustration' (CBS BPG 6201-4), all by the Henderson band. Four of the titles on AH 41 come from the 1926-7 period and, although Stewart had been a member of the hand by this time, he isn't present on these tracks. However, the remaining eight tracks from 1931 show him to good advantage and include the noted tribute to Beiderbecke with Stewart's re-creation of Bix's solo on Singin' The Blues. Taken at a rather more jaunty tempo than the original, Henderson's version opens with a neatly-scored chorus for the sax section which demonstrates just how mature and capable his writing was. The Beiderbecke-Trumbauer recording, admittedly with a smaller group, sounded very unprofessional by comparison. Rex enters next and it is at once obvious that he has learned the Beiderbecke solo. But here we get an immediate introduction to his methods. The end is more important than the means and the intensity with which he attacks the piece leaves little ragged edges so that, although he has copied Bix's solo more or less note for note, the faulty intonation is Rex's. This was an integral part of his playing throughout his life, and was characteristic in much the way that Harry Edison frequently plays flat and Charlie Parker frequently played sharp. Whether he had much to say or little, Rex always played with great energy, and the fact that he often pitched out of tune had little effect on the impact of what he played.\n\nThere are other differences, for Bix's lyricism was a delicate thing almost too fragile to be exposed whereas, even at his most poetic, Rex is a red-blooded soloist. His interpretation is not as poignant as Bix's, but is blended rather to suit the Henderson formula, at once rigid and yet pliable.\n\nOne of the classic versions of Sugarfoot Stomp, which Rex recorded several times, both with Henderson and under his own name, is also included in the Ace Of Hearts issue. The trumpet solo, a fiery and leaping outburst by Bobby Stark (incidentally, one of the finest of Henderson's soloists) leads into solos by Buster Bailey and a splendid passage from trombonist Benny Morton before Hawkins inevitably steals the record. Rex has to be content on this occasion to sit in the section, but is recompensed with a delightful duet-chorus with Morton on I'm Crazy 'Bout My Baby with both of them at their most elegant. Rex opens with a Bubber Miley-type growl which foreshadows his later proficiency with the style. His solo is delicate and, when he returns to follow Morton, one hears once again the Beiderbecke influence in his style (the trumpet behind the vocal is probably by Stark). There is a suitably pungent pair of muted interpolations from Stewart on Low Down On The Bayou, once again incidentally with remarkable trombone from Morton, while the moody House Of David Blues has him following Hawkins with great success in a passionate and Ellington-like chorus. Rex's half-valve methods are audible in his opening solo on Just Blues, his whole conception being typical of his unflagging success as a blues player throughout his career. Once again the track has good work from Hawkins and Morton. 'A Study In Frustration' is a much more exhaustive set, with Stewart's best work on the third and fourth volumes. Unfortunately the sound quality on some of the earliest items is not good (AH 41 has been fed through an echo chamber with surprisingly good results), notably on Freeze And Melt, which, apart from jaunty Stewart solos, has him sitting next to Cootie Williams in the trumpet section – and that was in April, 1929. Benny Carter's excellent arrangement was worthy of better hearing, but it is inevitable, one supposes, that some of these rare items have to be taken from worn copies of the originals. (Cootie, incidentally, has a flaring growl solo, most effective, on Raisin' The Roof which, like Freeze, comes from Volume 3). One of Stewart's most dexterous and inventive escapades up to this time was on the breakneck tempo version of Chinatown, a flag-waver from March 1930 which coupled his exuberance to a dazzling technique – undimmable even by the Hawkins solo which followed. Sugarfoot Stomp crops up again on Volume 3, this time in a March 1931 version with solos by Claude Jones, Stewart, Henderson, Benny Morton and Hawkins. This is a very good- re-arrangement, with greatly improved reed work. Rex successfully paraphrases the Oliver solo with a neatness and respect which still doesn't prevent a transformation to purest Stewart. This short passage shows him at his most controlled and sustained with, for once, a clearly pre-conceived idea of what he is about to play. On the next track, Clarinet Marmalade, he leads the saxes through a difficult bit of scoring and then takes a wildly involved solo of his own which happily comes off. Note here also the Russell Procope solo, so much in the Bigard mould, even as far back as 1931. Volume 4 is by far the best of the four records despite the fact that Stewart solos on only two tracks - two versions of Henderson's arrangement of King Porter Stomp, with Rex, Red Allen and Stark on the second. The first opens with a punching trumpet solo from Stark, comparing nicely with Stewart's more plaintive solo that comes later. Hawkins also plays well, but perhaps the best soloists are Sandy Williams and Jay C. Higginbotham on trombones. The other track featuring Rex pairs him with Hawkins for Underneath The Harlem Moon, a tour de force which also finds room for Higginbotham.\n\nAfter Henderson, Rex joined the Luis Russell Orchestra, by then much changed from the band of 1929-30 which had included Allen and Higginbotham, but still a very fine band. During Rex's stay his colleagues included Leonard Davis on trumpet, Jimmy Archey on trombone, Charlie Holmes on alto, Lee Blair on guitar and the ever-faithful Pops Foster on bass. As far as we know Stewart recorded no solos with the band, although I'm sure he would have found it impossible to resist joining the wonderful vocal choir from the band on the 1934 Ghost Of The Freaks. Should Chris Ellis succeed with his plans at Parlophone we might get a second volume of Luis Russell titles that includes the ones with Stewart present. The first titles recorded under Stewart's own name, probably in 1934, although some sources suggest 1935, were on Vocalion 2880, later issued here on Decca F 5458.. The band included George Stevenson on trombone, Rudy Powell on clarinet, Roger Ramirez on piano, Billy Taylor on bass and Jack Maisel on drums. Stingaree was the first of a long line of typically jaunty Stewart tunes and it is notable for both the good rhythm section and the careful support provided for the soloists by the rest of the front line. Rex has a free-wheeling and exuberant solo which shows a considerable development from his Henderson days. He goes with confident accuracy for a row of high notes at the end that must have represented quite a wide range for the day.\n\nBaby, Are You Satisfied? is a nostalgic and mournful melody played over a spoken opening conversation between Rex and probably Ramirez. Rex tries a couple of pungent blues solos before embarking on the vocal - his voice was much higher in those days than later. The singing has traces of Armstrong and is most effective. There is an excellent unidentified alto on these sides.\n\nStewart joined the Ellington band in late 1934, and his work from this period is well-represented on 'The Ellington Era Vol. 2', the very fine three-record boxed set (CBS 66302). The previous couple of years had seen a reorientation of Ellington's direction, and the band had taken on a more sophisticated mantle following the addition of Lawrence Brown, whose suave trombone was in direct contrast to the primitive genius of Joe Nanton, and the emergence of Juan Tizol as a strong influence on the writing for the band. Unhappily, Columbia did not consider the first group of titles which Rex recorded with the band as worthy of issue, but he was featured on Margie made at their next session in March 1935. At this session two sides were made by a sextet comprising Stewart, Harry Carney, Johnny Hodges (on soprano), Ellington and two bassists, Wellman Brand and Billy Taylor. The titles were Tough Truckin' and Indigo Echoes but to date we have not been able to hear them.\n\nA few days later, in April 1935, Duke recorded the remarkable Showboat Shuffle, which ranks with his various vivid 'train' numbers in its portrayal of a steamboat. Stewart was the main soloist, and he played with great confidence and mastery of his instrument, his timing of his first break being quite remarkable (this track is in the CBS set mentioned).\n\nDuke also found a place for Rex in his gentle Reminiscing In Tempo, with Rex at his most reflective in the fourth part (September, 1935). 'The half-valve touch comes back for Stewart's relaxed and beautifully constructed chorus on Kissing My Baby Good-night, which also has good work from Hodges, Bigard and vocalist Ivy Anderson.\n\nVolume 1 of `The Ellington Era', on long-deleted CBS issues comprised three records available separately, and included some of Stewart's best early work, notably the second album (CBS BPG 62179) including Merry-Go-Round and the timeless In A Jam, with Rex at his most joyously pungent. On Exposition Swing (from Volume 2) Rex comes in only for the release in the final chorus, but attacks it with such delirium that one feels he must explode. By now an established Ellingtonian, Rex was honoured by Duke with Rex's Concerto (Trumpet In Spades) in July 1936. This was a tour de force of dexterity, and while it has been fairly heavily clobbered by critics, its design is obviously to show off Stewart's technical abilities, and this it does superbly with its racing cornet, triple-tongue work and nicely timed breaks. The fact that it wasn't a jazz masterwork was incidental. In December 1936 Stewart made two more titles under his own name with Lawrence Brown, Carney, Hodges, Ellington, Billy Taylor, Sonny Greer and a non-Ellingtonian friend of Rex's, Ceele Burke on guitar. Issued on Vocalion 3810, the first title was a typically lively Stewart piece, Rexatious, and apart from first-class solos all round, it had Hodges on soprano and an incredibly close-to-Bigard clarinet solo from Carney (some people persist that it is Bigard, but Carney confirms that it is he). Although Carney's phrasing is almost indistinguishable from Bigard's, his tone is more reedy. By this stage, from his solo, it is obvious that Stewart had fully matured his style.\n\nLazy Man Shuffle, from the same session, is an effective slow piece again composed by Stewart, in the mournful groove which later produced such melancholy masterpieces as Poor Bubber. It makes good use of Ceele Burke's Hawaiian guitar and an attractive band sound, with Carney' outstanding on baritone and the leader half-valving through a tight mute.\n\nBarney Bigard used Rex, Tizol, Carney, Billy Taylor, Greer and of course Duke for an attractive session by his small group in April 1937. Three of the four titles found their way out on Parlophone 78s, Stewart having a searing solo climaxed by some excellent high-note work on Four And One Half Street. Demi-Tasse was written by Carney and is nicely-based on a baritone figure. Tizol, Bigard and Stewart split a chorus with Duke before Bigard opens up at his most lyrical and Rex plays one of his hustling releases towards the end. The final side, Jazz A La Carte opens with Stewart tightly-muted, driving over the band riffs before Barney lightly leads into one of Carney's most satisfying solos. Ellington catches the mood and strides out with a determined chorus before the little band riffs to the end of the record.\n\nStewart seemed to favour an added trumpet in his small group sessions of the 'thirties. On the July 7 1937 quartet of titles (Back Room Romp, Love In My Heart, Sugar Hill Shim Sham and Tea And Trumpets) for the Variety label he used Freddy Jenkins as well as Hodges, Carney, Ellington and company, and for a 1939 session he added Louis Bacon.\n\nBraggin' In Brass (available here at one time on ten inch HMV, DLP 1172) produced his next noted contribution to a full-band record. This was a racing and violent variation on Tiger Rag and Stewart, reversing his usual role, drains off the heat established by the frantic brass sections in the first choruses by switching to over-drive and playing the first part of his solo at half tempo. In this fairly long outing, he shows once again a remarkable poise and sense of timing. This was in March 1938, surely beginning a five-year period when he reached his greatest heights. He burrowed into a suppressed and muted solo, which made a fine opening to Dinah's In A Jam, notable also for Bigard riding a tide of riffs which would have been the envy of the most polished of the white swing bands.\n\n-Steve Voce and Anne Judd\n\nRexatious\n\nA THREE PART SUMMARY OF THE WORK OF REX STEWART\n\nPart 2 (by Steve Voce)\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in March 1968\n\nadded 2011-08-23\n\nBy the late 'thirties Rex Stewart had established himself as one of the classic big band soloists. He had come up in the shadow of King Oliver and Armstrong at his brilliant best. He had consolidated his original style whilst working alongside Coleman Hawkins, Jimmy Harrison, Benny Morton and other outstanding musicians of the era. Now, with Johnny Hodges, Barney Bigard, Harry Carney, Tricky Sam Nanton and the others, he had graduated to become an apparently inseparable part of the highest currency in jazz – the Ellington sound.\n\nIn such an ideal setting, he was able to expand his already mature style, with Ellington, as always, brilliantly able to provide the plot and the scenery for a major speech from one of his sidemen. Ellington never interfered with his soloists' characters - he catered for them. As a result almost all the key figures in the brass and reed sections developed into world-beaters. And it was in 1938 that Rex, Bigard, Nanton, Cootie Williams and Carney reached the plateau of greatness which was to produce the Ellington band of 1940, perhaps the most consistently great jazz organisation we shall ever hear.\n\nIt was a puzzling fact that Ellington, and all the stars in his band as well, did in that one year hit a peak, both as a unit and as individuals, that they were never able to climb again. Not only had Ellington apparently reached his utmost, but the individuals like Bigard, Webster, Hodges, Brown and Stewart all suffered slight decline in their work for the years after. Only Harry Carney, Sam Nanton and Jimmy Blanton remained as impervious soloists, and both Nanton and Blanton were to die within the few years that followed. Carney remains to this day one of the most stable and consistent jazz soloists - certainly the most complete baritone saxist that jazz has produced and, in his modest way, a major part of the music's history. The `stomp' philosophy found no part in the sophisticated make-up of Billy Strayhorn, Duke's alter ego, and it is conceivable that his brilliant innovations may have been unsettling to the older soloists. Certainly the effect that his scores for Hodges, plush and sometimes perhaps too rich, had on the Rabbit, are fairly obvious. On the other hand, his similar works for Ben Webster undoubtedly opened new doors as the old ones closed. Whatever the reasons may have been, Stewart's general work declined after, say, 1941. (a note in 2011  with the benefit of hearing the Treasury broadcasts from a few years later the suggestion of Rexs decline seems inaccurate). From then until his death, it was more a question of hit and miss, with the many triumphant hits being not quite matched by the near-misses and very definite misses.\n\nBut first, a look at the time when for more than three years, everything went right and Rex was a vital part of the most important orchestra in jazz.\n\nIn 1938 the Ellington band recorded the first of what were for Rex Stewart to be many versions of Boy Meets Horn, the definitive showcase for Stewart's pungent half-valve style. Like the earlier Trumpet In Spades it was a functional rather than an emotionally moving piece, but it did give a splendid demonstration of the eccentric dimension within which Stewart had developed his techniques. Those techniques were to reach over the next 30 years to provide new expression for thousands of trumpeters from Taft Jordan to Clark Terry and Clifford Brown, from Freddy Randall to Maynard Ferguson.\n\nThe now elusive but superb 'Ellington Sidemen' album (Philips BBL 7163) contains two of the three tracks recorded by Stewart's 52nd Street Stompers on March 20 1939 for Vocalion (the third was I'll Come Back For More) with the Ellington rhythm section plus Louis Bacon (tpt), Bigard (clt) and Tricky Sam on trombone. San Juan Hill, a typically atmospheric Stewart piece, opens with Rex half-valving over broken piano rhythms from Duke. With the intense introduction out of the way Stewart solos with a lyricism reminiscent of Bix, but with a more definite attack. Nanton is also featured to great effect, and the contrast is a potent one. Stewart introduces Bigard's flowing coda with a smeared half-valve phrase which shows him at his best. This and Fat Stuff Serenade, another of his cheerful little stomps, herald the expansive musician who was to work so sublimely with Bigard and Reinhardt later in the year, and the two tracks are as delightful as anything he ever recorded. Bigard is on devastating form before Stewart returns with a slightly muffled but penetrating final solo.\n\nEllington's band made its second trip to Europe in the spring of 1939, playing in Sweden, Denmark and France, omitting Britain only because of the Musician's Union ban on American musicians (partly imposed, rumour has it, because Cab Calloway had earlier graced our national anthem with a scat vocal). Just before the tour, on March 20, the band recorded Subtle Lament, with Rex featured in a simple bottom register solo (included on the deleted CBS BPG 62t8o along with Boy Meets Horn).\n\nIn Paris on April 5 of that year Rex Stewart and His Feetwarmers produced five of the most lasting classics in small group jazz. It appears that Rex and Django Reinhardt took to each other at once, and certainly the chamber jazz which made up the five titles recorded on that day shows Stewart, Bigard and Reinhardt at their best. Billy Taylor on bass completed the group (Greer had been supposed to play, but didn't turn up so happily it was decided to continue without a drummer). Montmartre, an excellent little tune, was completely typical of Stewart's more jaunty themes, and he and Reinhardt burrow right into it with the opening statement. Rex follows Reinhardt's solo, and it is particularly noticeable how the drive of the piece increases as Django drops back to rhythm playing. His explosive prodding of Rex and Barney has a powerful effect. Rex leans back against such attractive support and, once again, there are Bixian overtones to his solo. Low Cotton, although credited to Rex, sounds more like a Bigard composition, and Barney states the theme with a delicate lower register tone. Django throws out handfuls of perfectly-placed notes and then returns to give delicate support to the clarinet before embarking on a filigree single-note solo, made more atmospheric by the solitary bass backing. Rex again plays lyrical, well-lubricated phrases. The piece ends with Bigard laying delightful runs over Rex's lead. Billy Taylor wrote Finesse, a thoughtful piece which opens with a statement from Rex, toned up by some half-valve blues treatment. Bigard follows in the upper register at his most expansive, all the while over most sensitive backing from Reinhardt, who then, with Bigard switching briefly to drums, takes the record out with more pensive single-note guitar. I Know That You Know is a hustling and bustling stomp, smartly driven along by the guitar and with Bigard playing one of his greatest solos, racing backwards and forwards through the complete range of his instrument in a sparkling display that would cow any clarinettist in the world, then or now. Rex enters with a muffled and prodding urgency, soon involving himself in some complex valve work, ahead of its years in its accurate fluency. Solid Old Man returned to the slow mood which suited the quartet so well. Bigard plays drums again behind Reinhardt's opening statement, but picks up his clarinet hurriedly to join Rex in the theme statement. Stewart goes first with a deep and moving solo, graced by all his range of effects and yet remaining a simple blues assertion. Reinhardt also uses the bottom register and, sounds strangely reminiscent of Teddy Bunn. Bigard plays some heart-on-sleeve blues before the two horns, riding over powerful guitar chords, take the theme to its conclusion. The complete session is included on 'Django And His American Friends Vol. 2' (HMV CLP 1907) and is indispensable.\n\nThe highly significant switch by the Ellington band to Victor came in 1940 and the March 6 session in Chicago produced You, You Darlin', a vocal feature for Herb Jeffries, and three instrumentals, Jack The Bear, Ko-Ko and Morning Glory.Not a bad day's work. Morning Glory was all Stewart's and additionally was perhaps the finest showcase that Duke ever wrote for a trumpeter. It was also one of Ellington's most consummate uses of the three-minute form, being a perfect miniature concerto. The melody is a most satisfying and unusual one, opening with Ellington against muted brass over Blanton's bass. Stewart enters at his most lyrical and tidy, playing in the bottom of the middle register and producing a warm and mellow sound. The band backing is distant until a sonorous brass passage opens a delicate sax ensemble led by Hodges (the version on 'The Indispensable Ellington Vol. 1' on RCA RD-27258 has had echo added and the results are quite impressive). The brass heralds Rex's return, and he climbs higher over the band in a nostalgic and completely poetic manner, building to the coda over rising brass and reeds. The coda is a most delicate affair, thoroughly dependent on Rex's remarkable timing, although Ellington's device is quite simple. The final bar is subtly inconclusive and its simple grace reminds one of a much later coda, perhaps one of the most potent in all jazz, on Stan Getz's recording of Her, where a similar effect is held for a much greater time. Once again, timing rather than complexity is the key to its greatness.\n\nAt the March 15 session Rex had a tightly muted solo tucked into the rich ensemble that concluded the exotic Conga Brava (HMV DLP 1034) and then, on May 28, played one of his greatest choruses on what was one of Ellington's most effective mood performances of the era, Dusk (HMV 7EG 8153). His gentle way with the trumpet solo on this number is one of the jewels of his recorded work, and the whole piece, gilded by Ellington's rich piano, is quite masterful. The same date produced Portrait Of Bert Williams, another nostalgic classic with Rex cast in the main role, playing mournful and whimsical cornet in three chapters, spanning other fine solos from Bigard and Tricky Sam. The track is available on In A Mellotone (RCA RD-27134).\n\nHarlem Airshaft ('At His Very Best,' RCA RD27133) had Stewart in brassy high-note vein, tearing at his solo with some violence. It is interesting to compare this track with the more exhaustive version of the role interpreted later by Clark Terry. Rex returns towards the end for a suppressed muted solo that erupts beautifully into Bigard's final comment. The session, on July 22, this time in New York instead of Chicago, also produced At A Dixie Roadside Diner (HMV 7EG 8209) with Rex again featured along with Ivy Anderson, Bigard and Carney.\n\nBack to Chicago on September 5 for Five O'Clock Whistle (HMV 7EG 8239), opening dramatically with Rex suspending half valve notes over Ellington's piano and Blanton's bass. Rex and Hodges state the theme and Rex's second solo, clear and crisp, introduces Ivy Anderson's vocal. Stewart has a bit of a disaster towards the end of his solo during the vocal, but returns to join Ivy and take over a powerhouse coda with more success. The sleeve of RD-27133 credits the trumpet solo on Warm Valley (October 17) to Cootie, but, although it's a difficult case, the irresistible half-valve note towards the end surely reveals it to be Stewart?\n\n-Steve Voce\n\nRexatious\n\nA THREE PART SUMMARY OF THE WORK OF REX STEWART\n\nPart 3 (by Steve Voce)\n\nPublished in Jazz Journal in April 1968\n\nadded 2011-08-23\n\nOn 28th October, 1940, Ellington recorded the remarkable Across The Track Blues, a simple piece built on solos by Bigard, Stewart, Brown and Bigard, again over effective piano and bass. The band enters for the first time behind Stewart's cutting and pungent chorus, muted and plaintive, and Bigard leads the saxes in a beautifully scored chorus before Brown, his plush muted sound contrasting vividly with the previous Stewart chorus, takes over. Bigard, with a simple statement of basic bottom register notes, climbs finally to the upper register over a mocking chorus of muted trumpets and Ellington's piano returns the piece to its stark opening mood.\n\nStewart's last featured recordings for the year came at a session under his own name using Brown, Ben Webster, Carney and the rhythm section on November 2nd. These titles form part of 'Things Ain't What They Used To Be' (RCA RD-7829).\n\nLinger Awhile has Carney on alto and Rex in his most mellow mood. The music is of a very high level and has an excellent piano solo from Ellington and bustling Webster over a Sonny Greer back-beat. Rex comes back for another bite, this time with a Harmon mute, and again plays with great restraint and accuracy. Mobile Bay, the same piece that Cootie recorded a few years before as Mobile Blues, is Rex most of the way in a gutty blues that was to be done again in 1947 with such drama that it then became perhaps Rex's greatest recorded blues performance ever. The 1940 version remains very moving and extremely muscular, with gritty piano from Duke and a sensual chorus from Webster. Rex came back, tightly muted, to take the final chorus out.\n\nStewart's flair for original composition was shown at its greatest on the Hollywood session from 3rd .July, 1940, when Menelik (The Lion Of Judah) and Poor Bubber were recorded by his Ellington small group. These were both haunting themes, quite out of the run of orthodox Ellingtonian composition. Bubber is a sad portrait, with Rex growling gently over sombre riffs from Carney and Webster. After good solos by Webster and Brown, Rex comes shouting back using a shaking vibrato to good effect, and resolving neatly back into the theme. Menelik explodes like a box of fireworks with Stewart achieving what might almost be a contemporary avant garde effect with his extraordinary use of freak bass registers. Once again he appears from a barrage of brooding riffs to state the defiant theme, reflecting a gay confidence that the Lion (Haile Selassie, whom Stewart much admired) would triumph in the end. The freak bass notes return at the end, displaying the style that was later to enable him literally to talk through his instrument. The same session produced the punching Subtle Slough (Just Squeeze Me) and, backed superbly by Jimmy Blanton, Stewart's good form held out. Despite its front line (Stewart, Bigard and Lawrence Brown) the Rex Stewart Big Seven included Billy Kyle, Brick Fleagle, Wellman Brand and Dave Tough in a most un-Ellington sound. There were four tracks recorded on July 23 1940 for the HRS label, and they produced superb mainstream"
