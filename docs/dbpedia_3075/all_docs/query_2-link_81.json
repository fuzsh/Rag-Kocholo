        "text": "It required a trip to the Library of Congress (LOC) in Washington DC, along with lots of musical detective work, but I finally pieced together six songs from that famous songwriting team of Chopin-Gershwin.\n\nIn 1923, Ira Gershwin wrote the lyrics, while the Gershwins’ friend Bill Daly (William Merrigan Daly) helped Ira choose Chopin songs and simplify those melodies to be used in a Chopin Broadway musical.\n\nThe “European” Origins of the Chopin Show\n\nThe biggest obstacle in getting a sense of this Chopin show is that there is no script attached to it. It appears, according to a note on Ira’s personal stationery, that Gershwin and Daly were commissioned to write the Chopin songs by a “European” who claimed to have the rights to a book about Chopin’s life. After writing several songs, they learned that the show had already been produced in Scandinavia. The implication is that the Scandinavian production meant that the US production was off.\n\nWho was this mysterious “European”? And what was that “Scandinavian” production?\n\nTo find out, we work back from the 1928 Broadway musical about Chopin’s life called White Lilacs. There is a clue suggesting that Ira’s 1923 Chopin show songs were based on the same script that was eventually used to create White Lilacs. That clue: a distinctive similarity of characters.\n\nWe do know the names of some of the characters in Ira’s show:\n\nFrédéric Chopin\n\nGeorge Sand\n\nGaston\n\nDelfine\n\nDubusson\n\nWhite Lilacs, also features the characters Chopin and Sand (not surprising), but also Gaston (de Flavigny), Delfina (Potocka, Chopin’s student/friend/muse), and Dubuisson (Sand’s publisher). Significantly, another Chopin musical from the era, Jenő Faragó’s Chopin, performed in Budapest in 1926, has no such overlap of characters except for Chopin and Sand.\n\nWhite Lilacs and Ira’s Chopin show BOTH have Gaston and Delphine singing a duet as the second song of the show, thus proving, in my mind, that Ira’s show shares the same original book as White Lilacs did.\n\nWhite Lilacs was based on a musical by Sigurd Johannsen, and I posit that Johannsen is the “European” that contacted the songwriting team of Daly-Gershwin to make a U.S. Chopin show. If not Johannsen, it could possibly have been a producer connected to Johannsen’s show.\n\nThe “Scandinavian” show referenced in the note written on Ira’s stationery was Chopin, which premiered on March 17, 1923 at the Dagmarteatret in Copenhagen, Denmark. The book and lyrics were written by Sigurd Johannsen and Chopin’s music was arranged by Harry Schrey and Franz Doelle. Johannsen’s German words were translated into Danish by Johannes Dam. Whether a German version was ever produced, I haven’t been able to find out. Nor can I find any articles that discuss the show’s success or failure. I only have this online Danish theatrical database that gives just the basic facts about the production.\n\nIra’s Chopin Songs\n\n“Come Let Us Dance and Dream (Opening Number)”: Act I, #1. Sung by a Young Couple. Theme of the lyrics: Waltzing is awesome! Based on Chopin’s Minute Waltz in D-flat major (Op. 64, No. 1).\n\n“Someday You’ll Realize”: Act I, #2. Duet sung by Gaston and Delphine. Theme of the lyrics: Gaston’s love for Delphine and Delphine’s rejection of it. Verse based on Chopin’s Mazurka in A-flat major (Op. 50, No. 2).\n\n“Man, The Master”: Act I, #3. Sung by George Sand. Theme of the lyrics: Women’s rights and an end to men’s “tyranny.” Verse based on Chopin’s Mazurka in B minor (Op. 33, No. 4).\n\n“On the Wings of Romance”: Act I, #4. Duet sung by George Sand and Dubusson (Sand’s publisher) Theme of the lyrics: Dubusson’s love for Sand and Sand’s rejection of it. Verse based on Chopin’s “My Darling” (Op. 74, No. 12). Chorus based on Chopin’s Scherzo No. 2 in B-flat minor (Op. 31).\n\n“My All”: Act I, #5. Sung by Chopin and Sand. Theme of the lyrics: An expression of eternal devotion to their beloved. Based on Chopin’s Étude in E major “Tristesse (Sadness)” or “Farewell (L’Adieu),” (Op. 10, No. 3).\n\n“Bach, Beethoven, Chopin”: Possibly meant as a dance and to be sung as a sextette though no characters are specified. Ira Gershwin’s original theme may have been about dancing. Based on Chopin’s Étude in G-flat major (Op. 25, No. 9).\n\n“Bittersweet”: Presumed to be intended for Ira’s Chopin show. Theme of the lyrics: Acceptance of life’s bittersweetness. Intended singer and Chopin’s music unknown, though I chose Chopin’s Scherzo in B minor (Op. 20, No. 1) for the verse and his Prelude in A Major (Op. 28, No. 7) for the chorus which can be found in the PDF of the sheet music below. See Ira’s lyrics below.\n\nThe show opens with a “Young Couple” extolling the virtues of Chopin’s waltzes as they dance to his “Minute Waltz” (Op. 64, No. 1). This song was simply labeled “Opening Song,” but I gave it the more poetic title of “Come Let Us Dance and Dream” from Ira’s lyric. It is a little hard to tell if Ira meant to leave so much of Chopin’s melody without lyrics, but I think he did, since it allows for the dancing to take most of the spotlight.\n\nAnother addition I made was extending the eight short measures in the manuscript above which Ira barely got around to writing a lyric for. Ira began his lyrics with “Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, ‘Then?’ Meyerbeer.” Well that was enough for me to want to complete the song. Fortunately, the manuscript labels the tune as “Étude Op. 25 No. 9.” So I knew where to find the rest of the melody, and all I had to do was to finish Ira’s lyric. Since plenty of the songs were already about how wonderful waltzes are, I decided to take on another theme from the show: gender equality. While using Ira’s list of composers “Bach, Beethoven, Chopin” as my starting point, my lyric goes on to point out the tougher road to fame that has confronted female composers. If you don’t care for it, just consider it a dummy lyric until a better one comes along.\n\nThe LOC has complicated things by including stray material into their Chopin show collection. “Baby Me Blues” has music by Vincent Youmans and lyrics not meant for a period piece. “Honorable Moon” has music credited to Bill Daly. Daly does not take credit on any of the Chopin melodies that he wrote out. Plus, “Honorable Moon” is a comic number based on Madame Butterfly wherein the Japanese maiden pines for her American love to return, only to have multiple sailors come back to her . . . and to her multiple newborn children.\n\nAlso included in the LOC Chopin material is an Ira Gershwin lyric called “Bittersweet.” I tried to match Ira’s words to MANY Chopin melodies, and finally found two that seem workable. Chopin’s Prelude in A (Op. 28, No. 7) and the Scherzo in B minor (Op.20, No. 1) seem to parallel not only Ira’s line lengths, but also the rhyme scheme. I don’t know for sure that “Bittersweet” was intended for the Chopin show, but these are beautiful Chopin melodies that only took some minor editing to get the lyrics to synchronize with the tune.\n\nSo what is the point of all this? Why go to all the trouble of trying to make sense out of a partial musical abandoned 96 years ago?\n\nCuriosity mostly. Ira Gershwin wrote songs with some of the music world’s greats: George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Harold Arlen, Kurt Weill, Vincent Youmans, Vernon Duke, and Aaron Copland, for example. The fact that Ira wrote songs with a composer even more famous than those other collaborators and yet very few people knew what those song sounded like — I couldn’t let that stand, if I could help it.\n\nSo now that we have six songs by Fred and Ira, someone could go to the trouble of creating a Chopin show around the six songs. Chopin’s life story has made for compelling musicals and films in the past:\n\nOrefice‘s 1901 opera Chopin\n\nJenő Faragó’s 1926 musical Chopin with musical arrangements of Chopin by István Bartha\n\nThe 1928 movie La valse de l’adieu\n\nThe 1928 Broadway musical White Lilacs\n\nThe 1945 movie A Song to Remember\n\nThe 1991 movie Impromptu starring Hugh Grant as Chopin\n\nAnd seeing how Chopin’s story has changed little over the years, a new audience may be ready to hear his story.\n\nFor those interested in recreating this show, just find the White Lilacs script! Here are the settings for the acts as found in the 1928 playbill of White Lilacs, all taking place in France, 1840:\n\nACT I: The Fragonard Room in the Countess D’Agoult’s House, Paris.\n\nACT II: The Gardens at George Sand’s Villa on the Island of Majorca. A Month Later.\n\nACT III: Chopin’s Studio in Paris.\n\nIra’s Soon-to-Be Breakout Hit!?!\n\nBut there is another possible outcome from this research that would require less work than re-creating the entire Chopin show but would by very satisfying nonetheless: I could easily see Ira Gershwin charting with one of his Chopin songs, and the song with by far the biggest hit potential would have to be “My All. “\n\nHow could “My All” become a hit almost 100 years after it was written? Because it has repeatedly been a hit for decade after decade, and it’s about due for a comeback.\n\nChopin’s Étude in E major (Op. 10, No. 3), nicknamed “Tristesse,” has been the basis for multiple hits in multiple languages:\n\nJudith Dubeau’s French version “L’Ombre S’Enfuit”\n\nEdgardo Donato & Romeo Gavio’s Spanish version “La Melodía Del Corazón”\n\nSkip Downey’s awesome version made famous by Jo Stafford, “No Other Love”\n\nFinbar Wright’s version of “So Deep Is the Night”\n\nTrio Los Tres Diamantes’ Spanish version “Divina Ilusión”\n\nSarah Brightman’s French version “Dans la nuit”\n\nJerry Vale’s “This Day of Days”\n\nManca Izmajlova’s “Tristesse” in Polish I believe\n\nJosé Carreras’ Italian version “Tristesse”\n\nFuturama series finale (see video below).\n\nAnd the other half of the list of remakes can be found here.\n\nPlayed for sentimentality, Josh Groban or Michael Bublé could make “My All” a bestseller. Give it a heavy modern beat and any pop singer could ride Chopin’s touching melody to the top of the charts.\n\nSo be sure to tell the popstar in your life about this chance of a lifetime! I’ve given this project my all, now it’s up to the rest of you popstars!\n\nPDFs of the Sheet Music\n\nI didn’t create any SoundCloud music demos of these songs like I usually do, since it is all Chopin music, and you can easily hear all of Chopin’s music online. Plus, on YouTube it is played better than I could ever play. Search YouTube for “Chopin 10 3” for example, and you will get many versions of his Opus 10, Number 3.\n\nDownload the PDF of the simplified sheet music to all six songs from Ira Gershwin’s unproduced Chopin show here: Chopin Show songs\n\nDownload the PDF of the original music manuscripts and lyric sheets Ira Gershwin’s unproduced Chopin show here: Chopin Show by Ira Gershwin and Bill Daly\n\nLyrics to “Bittersweet” by Ira Gershwin\n\nVerse:\n\nLife as it goes is\n\nNo bed of red roses.\n\nBut troubles that happen along\n\nAlways depart, so\n\nDon’t take it tno heart so\n\nIf something has turned out all wrong.\n\nHappiness never is quite complete\n\nAll things are made up of bittersweet.\n\nChorus:\n\nBittersweet the days we spend;\n\nBittersweet until the end.\n\nEv’ry hope hides a fear;\n\nEv’ry smile knows a tear.\n\nWise the maiden who forgets\n\nWhen the bitter brings regrets.\n\nJust recall that one and all\n\nMust taste the bittersweet.\n\nThanks to Frédéric Chopin (Facebook alias), and Michael on my Gershwin 100 blog for all of their responses as I tried to identify which Chopin music was used in each song. It helped make a very confusing process a little easier."
