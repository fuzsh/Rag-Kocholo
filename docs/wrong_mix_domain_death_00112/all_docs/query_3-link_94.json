        "text": "Slavery could not exist without \"positive law\"—constitutions, statutes, and well-established customs and precedents that legitimated and protected the institution. Without positive law, citizens and judges in colonial and Revolutionary America would have to apply \"natural law\" to the subject of slavery.[1] Proponents of natural law theory believed there was a set of unchanging, unwritten moral principles that human beings could perceive by divine revelation or reason. They believed that the right to liberty was one of the most important principles of natural law. Seen in that light, slavery was a violation of natural law. How would colonial legislatures and courts deal with slavery?[2]\n\nThe first reported English decision on slavery did not occur until 1677 (Butts v. Penny). The King's Bench ruled that infidel or outsider status and sale by a merchant was grounds for enslavement. This justification for slavery had been known to Europeans and Africans for two centuries. After Butts v. Penny, the King’s Bench issued several contradictory rulings on the appropriate legal forms to recover enslaved property and whether \"as soon as a negro comes into England, he becomes free.\"[3]\n\nWith no definitive legal ruling, England's colonies drew on earlier customs and precedents to establish slavery into law. when their legislature passed a statute legalizing the institution in 1641.[4]\n\nEnslavement in Massachusetts began shortly after the Pequot War of 1637. In July, Governor John Winthrop recorded the price the Pequots paid for resisting White settlers from Massachusetts and Connecticut: \"We had now slain and taken, in all, some seven hundred. We sent fifteen of the boys and two women to Bermuda by Mr. [William] Pierce….\" Pierce ended up off-course and landed in Providence Isle, a Puritan colony in the Bahamas.[5]\n\nOn February 26, 1638, Winthrop noted what Massachusetts received in return for the enslaved Pequots: \"Mr. Pierce, in the Salem ship, the Desire, returned from the West Indies after seven months. He had been at Providence [Island], and bought some cotton, and tobacco, and negroes, etc.\"[6]\n\nWinthrop did not record who purchased the enslaved people, and it is open to debate. Authors John Gorham Palfrey and George H. Moore, writing a year apart, connected Samuel Maverick of Noddles Island [now East Boston] to the origin of slavery in Massachusetts in 1638. Their source was John Josselyn's Account of Two Voyages to New England. Palfrey merely wrote in a footnote: \"As early as the year 1638, there were two negro slaves in Massachusetts, held by Mr. Maverick.\" He did not state that Maverick bought them from the Desire.[7]\n\nMoore connected Maverick's enslaved people to the Desire based on an interpretation of Josselyn’s account of a disturbing encounter while visiting Maverick on October 2, 1639. Maverick’s \"Negro woman\" came to Josselyn's chamber window in hysterics. He could not understand her \"Countrey language\" but sensed her grief \"by her countenance and deportment.\" Seemingly moved by his belief that she had been a queen before enslavement, Josselyn \"repaired to my host to learn of him the cause, and resolved to intreat him on her behalf.\" He learned that Maverick \"was desirous to have a breed of negroes\" and when he could not persuade the woman \"to company\" with his enslaved man, he ordered the man \"to go to bed to her.\" The woman stopped the attempted rape by kicking the man out of bed.[8]\n\nMoore falsely charged Palfrey with writing that Maverick owned two enslaved persons before Winthrop's arrival in 1630, when \"the inference is irresistible from all authorities\" that he purchased them from the Desire in 1638. Moore cited no authorities but offered his own explanation: Maverick would not have waited ten years \"to improve his flock,\" and ten years of slavery \"would have made the negro-queen more familiar with the English language if not more compliant to the brutal customs of slavery.\"[9]\n\nThree years after their arrival, Massachusetts justified and legalized the enslavement of Africans, Native Americans, and mixed-race people in their Body of Liberties (1641):\n\nBond Slavery: \"There shall be never be any bond slavery…amongst us, unless it be lawful captives taken in just wars, and such strangers as willingly sell themselves or are sold to us….\"[10]\n\nBetween 1525-1866, 12.5 million Africans were forcibly transported from their homelands to fill labor demands in North American, South American, and Caribbean colonies (10.7 million survived the \"Middle Passage\" to the New World.). Europeans, followed by the English, traded guns, copper, iron, textiles, and other manufactured goods in West Africa in exchange for enslaved people, who were then exchanged in the colonies for a \"staple product,\" a raw commodity produced for export, the so-called \"Triangular Trade System.\"[11]\n\nVirginia and Maryland grew tobacco, the most valuable product in Britain’s mainland colonies. In the second half of the 1600s, South Carolina produced rice, and Pennsylvania became the \"bread colony,\" growing corn, wheat, rye, oats, and barley. With the exception of Pennsylvania, enslaved labor produced the most valuable commodities in the British Empire.[12]\n\nBoston merchants initially supplied the West Indies with salted fish to feed enslaved laborers and timber for buildings and fuel in exchange for sugar, molasses, or enslaved people. Soon, Boston dominated trade from communities throughout New England. Abundant timber supplies created a thriving shipbuilding industry, and ultimately the economic success of Massachusetts in the Trans-Atlantic economy came from the \"carrying trade.\" Headed to the West Indies, English and European ports, or Africa, their ships might carry New England produce, livestock, and lumber, Virginia tobacco, or commodities from Atlantic coastal ports.[13]\n\nEnslaved people were a labor source for Massachusetts, imported in small but steady numbers in the first half of the 1600s, but they were also trade commodities.[14] In 1644, Boston merchants began importing enslaved people directly from Africa to the West Indies, where they exchanged them for West Indian sugar and molasses, which would be distilled into rum (a major New England industry) to pay for more enslaved people--the Massachusetts version of \"Triangular Trade.\"[15]\n\nBetween 1630-1643, 15-20,000 English men and women migrated to New England. They fueled the economy, trading window glass, chimney backs, pots, kettles, and tools brought from England for milk, corn, livestock, and timber to build houses. Indentured servants provided labor. The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641 temporarily disrupted this flow of migration, and almost half of the settlers returned to England from 1641-1649.[16]\n\nIn August 1645, Emmanuel Downing, brother-in-law of Governor Winthrop, suggested a solution to the Massachusetts labor shortage. He encouraged Winthrop to wage war against the Narragansett Indians (a \"Just Warre\") in order to gain indigenous captives to exchange for enslaved Africans, who he referred to as \"Moores,\" \"for I do not see how we can thrive until we get into a stock of slaves sufficient to do all our business.\" English servants wanted the freedom \"to plant for themselves\" and \"we shall maintain 20 Moores cheaper than one English servant.\"[17]\n\nEnslaved Africans were not only agricultural workers but also domestic servants and unskilled labor both in rural towns and Boston. In September 1661, Boston selectmen reprimanded Thomas Deane for employing \"a Negro\" as a cooper \"contrary to ye orders of ye Town.\" They ordered him to stop, subject to a fine of 20 shillings per day. In 1661, they were protecting jobs of White artisans, but by the end of the 17th century, enslaved artisans became a valuable labor source. [18]\n\nThe Black enslaved community in Massachusetts was composed of descendants of the first Africans from the West Indies, supplemented by imported Africans via the West Indies and directly from Africa. They shared their enslaved status with Indigenous peoples and other people of color. In Boston, they lived among a community of other unfree people--indentured servants from England, Ireland, and Scotland, and apprentices.[19]\n\nFirst encounters of European and English explorers with Africans focused on differences in color, religion, and behavior. In 1554, Captain John Lok, author of \"Second Voyage to Guinea,\" concluded that Africans were \"a people of beastly living without a God, law, religion, or commonwealth.\"[20] Definitions of \"Black\" in the Oxford English Dictionary century before the 16th century included: \"dirty,\" \"sinister,\" \"foul,\" \"wicked,\" and \"malignant.\" [21]\n\nRacism certainly prepared Massachusetts Puritans to accept African enslavement, but the legal status of enslaved people in the 1600s was not clearly defined. Beyond enumerating who could be enslaved, The Body of Liberties gave no further details about the institution of slavery.[22] Without guidance from positive law, how would Puritan masters govern enslaved people?\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Definition of positive law: \"statutory man-made law, as compared to 'natural law,' which is purportedly based on universally accepted moral principles, 'God's law,' and/or derived from nature and reason. The term 'positive law' was first used by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651).\" Accessed 2020, https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1552.\n\n[2] Robert Cover, Justice Accused: Antislavery and the Judicial Process (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975), 1-35, discusses the dilemma of antislavery judges in the mid-19th century who had to decide if positive law outweighed natural law: “It is the story of earnest, well-meaning pillars of legal responsibility and of their collaboration in a system of oppression.” (p. 6) Judges could apply natural law “when no appropriate system of law provided an applicable rule for a given case.” (p.18) First, they would have to examine positive law (constitutions, statutes and “well-settled precedent”) that applied to a given case. Judges in 17th-century British and colonial courts had to use the same process.\n\n[3] William M.

This is the first recorded evidence of the arrival of enslaved people in Massachusetts. It was, however, a public undertaking, carried out by order of the colonial government of Massachusetts.
