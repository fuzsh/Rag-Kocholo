        "text": "City in Massachusetts, United States\n\nAgawam is a city[2] in Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 28,692 at the 2020 census.[3] Agawam sits on the western side of the Connecticut River, directly across from Springfield. It is considered part of the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is contiguous with the Knowledge Corridor area, the second-largest metropolitan area in New England. Agawam contains a subsection, Feeding Hills. The Six Flags New England amusement park is located in Agawam, on the banks of the Connecticut River.\n\nAgawam's ZIP code, 01001, is the lowest in the contiguous United States.\n\nThe Native American village originally sited on the west bank of the Connecticut River was known as Agawam, or Agawanus, Aggawom, Agawom, Onkowam, Igwam, and Auguam. It is variously speculated to mean \"unloading place\" and \"fishcuring place\", perhaps in reference to fish at Agawam Falls being unloaded from canoes for curing on the flats at the mouth of the Westfield River.[4]\n\nIpswich, Massachusetts, was also known as Agawam during much of the 17th century, after the English name for the Agawam tribe of Massachusetts, who were indigenous inhabitants of the area.[5]\n\nOn May 15, 1636, William Pynchon purchased land on both sides of the Connecticut River from the local Pocomtuc Indians known as Agawam, which included present-day Springfield, Chicopee, Longmeadow, and West Springfield, Massachusetts. The purchase price for the Agawam portion was 10 coats, 10 hoes, 10 hatchets, 10 knives, and 10 fathoms of wampum. Agawam and West Springfield separated from Springfield to become the parish of West Springfield in 1757; Agawam and West Springfield split in 1800. Agawam incorporated as a town on May 17, 1855.\n\nIn 1771, John Porter moved to Agawam and founded a gin distillery nine years later. After he died, his grandson, Harry, continued to work the business as the H. Porter Distilling Company. The plant was sold in 1917, and during Prohibition, the main products produced in the building were potato chips and cider. After the Volstead Act was repealed, the mill began producing gin again but closed permanently in 1938. The building, on Main Street near River Road, served as Agawam's Department of Public Works garage until it fell into disrepair.\n\nAgawam furnished 172 men who fought in the American Civil War, 22 of whom died in battle or of disease.\n\nThe original town hall, built in 1874 at the corner of Main and School Streets, housed the town government divisions as the current one does today, as well as the original town library located in the building's Tower Room. A small school building was located near the premises and held grades one through three. The building was demolished in 1938, and the property is now the site of Benjamin Phelps Elementary School.[4]\n\nThe Feeding Hills town hall, built in 1906, was almost identical to the Agawam town hall and was located at the corner of Springfield and South Westfield Streets. The building was demolished in 1950, and the Clifford M. Granger Elementary School opened in 1946 now occupies that land.[4]\n\nMay 29, 1930, and June 1, 1931, saw \"grand openings\" of Bowles Agawam Airport with the latter date including a visit from 100 biplanes of the United States Army Air Corps Eastern Air Arm.[6] A scheduled air service operated out of Bowles for approximately one year, before ending. The airport continued to operate as a civil airport until 1982. A pari-mutuel horse racing track, including grandstand and stables, was built adjacent to Bowles Airport. Seabiscuit won the Springfield Handicap at Agawam in track record time in October 1935.[7] The racetrack operated until pari-mutuel betting was outlawed by referendum in Hampden County in November 1938.[6] The airport also had plans in the early 1960s to become a commercial airport and host airlines for the city of Springfield, but plans were shelved. The airport and racetrack were demolished in the late 1980s and the area is now an industrial park.[4][6]\n\nAgawam is located at (42.071961, –72.644097).[8] The city borders West Springfield, Massachusetts, to the north, Southwick, Massachusetts, to the west, Longmeadow, Massachusetts, to the east, Springfield, Massachusetts, to the northeast, and Suffield, Connecticut, to the south. Westfield, Massachusetts, also borders to the northwest.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.2 square miles (63 km2) of which 23.2 square miles (60 km2) is land and 1 square mile (3 km2) (4.09%) is water.\n\nThe highest point in Agawam is the 640-foot (195 m)-tall Provin Mountain, a ridge that, along with the southern part of East Mountain, forms the western boundary of the city. Both are traversed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and are part of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border.\n\nAgawam has a subsection known as Feeding Hills that runs along the border of Southwick and Westfield, Massachusetts, and Suffield, Connecticut. Its border with Agawam was mainly determined by Line Street, and its ZIP code is 01030.\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%18601,698— 18702,001+17.8%18802,216+10.7%18902,352+6.1%19002,536+7.8%19103,501+38.1%19205,023+43.5%19307,095+41.3%19407,842+10.5%195010,166+29.6%196015,718+54.6%197021,717+38.2%198026,271+21.0%199027,323+4.0%200028,144+3.0%201028,438+1.0%202028,692+0.9%2022*28,393−1.0%* = population estimate.

Since May 1989 a mayor is the elected leader of the city. The current city council consists of eleven members elected at large by the voters and is the legislative branch of the town government.\n\nThe current mayor of Agawam is Christopher Johnson.[23]\n\nOn the state level, Agawam is represented in the Massachusetts Senate by John Velis, and in the Massachusetts House of Representatives by Nicholas Boldyga. Agawam is located in the Eighth Massachusetts Governor's Council district and is represented by Tara Jacobs.[24] On the federal level, Agawam is part of Massachusetts's 1st congressional district, represented by Richard Neal; it is represented in the United States Senate by Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nVoter Registration and Party Enrollment as of October 15, 2008[25] Party Number of Voters Percentage Democratic 6,259 30.88% Republican 3,161 15.60% Unaffiliated 10,697 52.78% Libertarian 152 0.75% Total 20,269 100%\n\nThe Agawam Police Department has about fifty full-time sworn law enforcement officers and about eight support personnel. The department is responsible for law enforcement at the Six Flags New England amusement park and the Feeding Hills district.[26]\n\nOn May 5, 2012, an Agawam officer shot a woman in the face when she answered her door. The city settled with her for $20,000.[27]\n\nIn early January 2017, the head of the Agawam Police Patrolman's Association was indicted on charges relating to stealing from the group.[28]\n\nIn mid-January 2017, three police officers were fired for beating a prisoner.

After a 1904 fire destroyed the Mittenague School and all the books in it, Fred P. Halladay donated land and buildings in North Agawam to use as a library. In 1925, Minerva Porter Davis donated a building in Agawam Center to serve as the library in that section of town, replacing the Agawam Town Hall rooms.[33] The Feeding Hills branch moved to a building across the street from the Feeding Hills town hall when that structure was removed to make way for Granger school.
