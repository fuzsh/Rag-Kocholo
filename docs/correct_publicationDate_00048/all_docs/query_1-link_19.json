        "text": "This is weird, and I don’t mean the sex scene late in the book. This feels like Frank Herbert being pushed to write more in the Dune universe after he ended his coda of God Emperor of Dune (which barely had narrative reason to exist itself) and having no idea where to take it next. It’s too familiar to what had come before in terms of worldbuilding while he searches desperately for some way to make the rules of the universe different at the same time. On top of all of that, it was intended as the first of a trilogy (he died before he could write the third entry), and so there’s far too much time with Frank Herbert characters (unemotional web-pullers and pullees) milling about for literally hundreds of pages before anything like a plot rears its head.\n\nIt’s been fifteen hundred years since the death of Leto II, the Tyrant, and the Bene Gesserit are…still one of the dominant forces in the universe (well, the central core without touching on those sent out during the Scattering which occurred after Leto’s death). 3500 years of being suppressed by the God Emperor, the diminishment of the need for Spice in the universe since the Ixians have developed space travel without Guild navigators, and the turning of Arrakis (now called Rakis) into a largely unimportant backwater ruled by a feckless class of priests descended from Leto’s elite bodyguards, the Fish Speakers.\n\nThis, right here, the continued dominance of the Bene Gesserit, is one of my issues with Herbert’s continuation of this story. It just kind of feels lazy, like he didn’t want to really challenge himself with delving into how the universe might have changed. There is some small mention of Houses re-asserting themselves in the literal millennia and a half, but they’re simply not part of the story, the larger political implications being between the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax, those who create gholas, reanimated dead people (not clones). These were the dominant factions below Leto II in the previous book, more than a thousand years prior, and they’re still there? Ugh, whatever. Moving on.\n\nSo, the story is about the Reverend Mother Taraza overlooking the raising of the latest iteration of the ghola Duncan Idaho while a special girl, Sheena, is discovered on Rakis who can command the giant sandworms through some kind of communication. To protect Idaho, Taraza brings Miles Teg, a 300 year old son of a Bene Gesserit and proven battle commander, to act as Idaho’s bodyguard and teacher. She also assigns her friend (?) Odrade to be the primary Bene Gesserit on the former planet of Geidi Prime, now called Gammu, to oversee Idaho at the same time.\n\nNow, my other major frustration with this book is that the first half of the book is just rather uninteresting conversation around what Idaho may mean, what the Bene Tleilax may have put into Idaho’s genetic code, what Sheena may mean, and what the Honored Matres, the Bene Gesserit-like females coming back from The Scattering, represent as a threat. Where Herbert tried to go different, which I give him some credit for, is in the changing of the center of power from the Spice to something else. What is that something else? Sex. The Honored Matres are so good at sex that they turn men into their slaves.\n\nSorry, but that’s just the stuff of terrible pulp, and it points to the idea that Herbert was something of a spent force while he was conceiving and writing this (he was also apparently dealing with his wife’s health crisis at the same time).\n\nSo, something of a plot manages to pop up about halfway through the book when the Honored Matres attack Gammu, sending Ordrade, Idaho, and Teg into hiding as they search for a way off the planet. The book kind of wallows in this for too long, I think, the hiding and movement from one place to another dominating the second half to surprisingly little effect. As I was reading it, I didn’t have that opinion, and then Herbert decides to completely skip over two major events, one about how Teg and his companions get off world, and the other so world-shattering for the universe of Dune that it makes no sense why it’s just handled with a handful of vague descriptions after the fact. He chose to spend over a hundred pages on how Teg, Duncan, and Odrade got from one part of Gammu to another, but he skips those two events completely?\n\nIt makes me feel like he was just speeding through the writing to get it done.\n\nSo, I’m actually less negative overall than my complaints seem to indicate. While I don’t think Herbert’s attempts at extending the universe are as interesting or successful as they could be, he did try to some degree. The change in central forces from the Spice to the Honored Matres’ physical abilities, which does stand as a counter to pre-established powers of the Bene Gesserit, is interesting even if I feel like it’s some kind of low form that Herbert just settled with. When the plot actually gets moving, it moves decently well. However, no character feels alive, just part of a web of conspiracy without any way out or even desire to do something other than play the part in the web. The focus on characters is simply too omnidirectional without providing us with a central character like Herbert had done in his first entry with Paul. It’s obvious that the central characters are supposed to be the Duncan ghola and Sheena, but they’re minor characters, at best.\n\nAnd it all feeds into this feeling that Herbert didn’t want to write the book at all, had little idea of where he wanted to take things, and really didn’t know how to write the first of a planned trilogy. In the end, this feels more like a prologue to a story that’s going to unfold rather than a story on its own. For what it actually is, it’s kind of dull but manages to accomplish what it needs, I assume. The table is set for the actual meal that, I hope, comes in Chapterhouse Dune."
