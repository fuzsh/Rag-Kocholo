        "text": "Given the recent blockbuster film adaptation of Dune, there’s been a resurgence of interest in Frank Herbert’s work. Dune is one of the best-selling science fiction novels of all time, but there are many other Frank Herbert books that deserve readers' attention.\n\nHerbert's writing career began after he graduated high school in 1939. He started out as a journalist writing for the Oregon Statesman newspaper. Later he attended the University of Washington, where he was one of two creative writing students who had sold pieces of their work for publication. The other student, Beverly Ann Stuart, went on to become his wife."
