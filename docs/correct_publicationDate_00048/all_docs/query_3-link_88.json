Sprouting from niche origins to a multi-billion dollar industry, sci-fi keeps most of us on the edge of our seats and presents us with an array of deep and possible future realities. Movies and arts in this genre can typically be traced back to books.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nâ\n\nThat's why in this article, we're going to be looking at the best sci fi writers of all time.

Whether you're looking these brilliant minds up for research or entertainment, stick around to find out more.Â\n\nâ\n\nSci-fi may explore far-out ideas that can be lofty and unrealistic, but many works dive deep into very important topics that are presented as \"fiction\" but ultimately comment on modern society and where it can genuinely be going. That's why we believe that our readers should read up on their sci-fi and get to know the best authors out there.\n\nâ\n\nWilliam Gibson\n\nWilliam Ford Gibson is considered the father of cyberpunk. Born on March 17, 1948, his debut novel, Neuromancer, is considered a modern science fiction trailblazer. He was one of the first sci fi writers to predict the importance of the internet and in fact shaped the evolution of the internet in the real world. Neuromancer as part of the Sprawl trilogy has inspired several musicians, artists, and movies including The Matrix.\n\nâ\n\nOver the past few decades, he has evolved as a writer to include elements of sociology and social commentary along with science fiction.

He won the Nebula and Hugo awards for the best novel as well as the Philip K Dick Award for the best paperback original for Neuromancer.\n\nâ\n\nThat made him the first to achieve a science-fiction triple crown.

Surprisingly, Jules Verne did not consider himself a science fiction writer, Â insisting that he did not make scientific predictions, rather he researched the science of his time extensively before creating stories based on it.\n\nâ\n\nStill, his influence on the genre is unmistakable. Several science fiction writers in the future as well as scientists themselves took inspiration from his works. Jules Verne is also credited with inspiring the steampunk genre which uses many elements from the 20th century.
