        "text": "Frank Herbert (1920-1986) was an American science fiction author who is best known for his novel \"Dune\" and its sequels. He was born in Tacoma, Washington, and grew up in various places in the Pacific Northwest. Herbert served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after the war, he worked as a journalist and photographer. Herbert began writing science fiction in the 1950s, and his first novel, \"The Dragon in the Sea,\" was published in 1956. However, it was \"Dune,\" published in 1965, that made him famous. \"Dune\" is set on a desert planet called Arrakis and follows the story of young nobleman Paul Atreides as he becomes embroiled in a struggle for control of the planet's valuable resource, a spice called melange. The novel won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1966, and it has become one of the best-selling science fiction novels of all time. Herbert went on to write five sequels to \"Dune,\" as well as numerous other novels and short stories. He was known for his complex, philosophical works that often explored themes of ecology, politics, and the human condition. Herbert passed away in 1986, but his legacy continues to influence science fiction and popular culture today."
