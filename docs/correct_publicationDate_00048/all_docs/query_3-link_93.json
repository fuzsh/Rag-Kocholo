        "text": "Among the archives in the Special Collections of Cal State Fullerton’s Pollak Library, the papers of Frank Herbert, author of the epic 1965 science fiction novel “Dune” have been the most popular, and now even more so since the newly released “Dune” movies.\n\nInterest in Herbert’s typewritten drafts, letters and forward-thinking ideas about the environment is surging once again.\n\nIn 1957, Herbert studied the shifting sands of the Oregon coast, a subject that fascinated him — they had been known “to swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways,” he wrote in a letter to his literary agent, pitching it as a magazine article. No editor wanted it, but those dunes later took shape as the landscapes of the planet Arrakis in “Dune.”\n\nThe story of “Dune” first appeared in the December 1963 edition of “Analog,” a science fiction journal, where it was printed in serial form. Copies of “Analog” can be found in the archival boxes at the library as well as correspondence Herbert had with his agent and writer friends, reviews of his books, notes, and heartfelt fan letters.\n\nLike most writers, Herbert had his share of rejection. The archival boxes of his papers in Pollak Library contain rejection letters Herbert received for “Dune” from publishers unwilling to bring it out as a book — there were 20 in total — with complaints that the novel was too long and the plot too complicated.\n\nTo date, the book has sold approximately 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nTeachers integrate Herbert’s archives in classroom studies, from literature to religion.\n\nThe rough manuscript pages for “Dune” — a story many students know only from the movies —reveal the workings of a writer’s imagination. They are filled with scribbled notes and edits.\n\n“It’s very cool,” said Lisa A. Mix, director of the Archives and Special Collections. “You can really get a sense of his process. You can see where he crossed things out and wrote things in. I tell students, ‘This is the primitive version of track change,’ ” she said.\n\nHerbert’s papers also offer a glimpse into the beginnings of the environmental movement in America. “Students are interested in the ‘Dune’ manuscript, but also Herbert’s research materials and notes in relation to the environment and climate change, and how those issues are portrayed in science fiction,” Mix said.\n\n“A professor in anthropology had his students work on an exhibit on the anthropology of religion. Some of the parts of the Herbert papers and ‘Dune’ were a part of that because Herbert invents several religions in ‘Dune,’ ” she said.\n\nThe Frank Herbert archives are part of a larger collection called the Willis McNelly Science Fiction Collection, Mix said.\n\n“Willis McNelly was a faculty member here at Cal State Fullerton in the Department of English,” she said. “In the 1960s, he was instrumental in getting science fiction recognized as literature. He was very active in both the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Writers of America.”\n\nIn 1967, McNelly was a speaker at the Science Fiction Writers of America meeting in Berkeley.\n\n“At that meeting, he met several science fiction writers, including Frank Herbert,” Mix said. “Because he was teaching science fiction as literature, he developed friendships and professional relationships with Frank Herbert, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick and other science fiction writers. He was very aware of the importance of these writers, preserving their manuscripts, as he put it, ‘not just keeping them in boxes in their garage,’ but having them preserved eventually in a library where scholars could come and do research on them.”\n\nHerbert donated original manuscripts and other papers to Cal State Fullerton in his lifetime, and after he died in 1986, his widow donated more. In 2015, Cal State University had a yearlong celebration of the 50th anniversary of the publication of “Dune” in which some of the archival material was included in displays.\n\nHerbert was born in Tacoma, Washington in 1920 and knew early on that he wanted to be a writer. He worked for several newspapers before eventually becoming a freelance writer.\n\nThe Pollak Library Special Collections also includes the Freedom Center, which consists of political literature and ephemera “from all aspects of all points on the political spectrum — from the Daughters of the Confederacy to the Bernie Sanders campaign,” Mix said.\n\nThere is also a large local history collection, much of it about the growth of the citrus industry in Orange County, as well as the university archives and an extensive map collection, which includes several showing California as an island.\n\nRelics in these collections tell stories of historic moments but also of how people were thinking at the time and shaped their history.\n\n“One thing I like about archives is that you can look at an issue from many sides, and you can find different documentation from different perspectives,” Mix said. “I find that very interesting.”"
