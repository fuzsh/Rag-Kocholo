        "text": "Back | Next\n\nContents\n\nThe Unpublished Short Stories of Frank Herbert\n\nEven the author of Duneâthe best-selling science fiction novel of all timeâhad trouble getting published. At first.\n\nFrank Herbert wanted to be a writer, and though today his name is practically synonymous with worldbuilding and epic science fiction, Herbert didnât start out with a particular genre in mind. He wrote mainstream stories, mysteries, thrillers, mensâ adventure pieces, humorous slice-of-life tales, and, yes, some science fiction.\n\nIn his early years, Herbert faced many rejections. His submissions came close-but-not-quite at magazine after magazine. Frank Herbert was an inspired writer with an unpredictable muse. He wrote what he wanted to write, about the characters and the situations that struck his fancy, paying very little attention to the market or the requirements of the magazines to which he submitted.\n\nAs a result, his stories were often the wrong lengthâtoo short to be released as a novel but too long for traditional periodicals. Magazines liked his work but could not use it. His agent also had a frustrating time finding a home for Herbertâs work.\n\nAnd yet he kept writing.\n\nFinally, in 1956, he found success, placing his novel The Dragon in the Sea with Doubleday, which received wide critical acclaim and made him a writer to watch.\n\nSo Herbert wrote another novelÂ â¦ which he couldnât get published. And another novel, and more short stories, and other novels. He kept trying, with his subjects wandering all over the map, until finally he wrote Dune, which was possibly the most unpublishable SF novel of all, rejected more than twenty times before it was finally released by a house that specialized in auto repair manuals.\n\nAnd eventually, that novel made him a world-famous author.\n\nIn Frank Herbertâs files, we found the completed and polished manuscripts for four novelsâHigh Opp, Angelsâ Fall, A Game of Authors, and A Thorn in the Bushâall of which have been released, as Herbert wrote them, from WordFire Press.\n\nWe also found the submission manuscripts for thirteen completed short stories, all of which failed to find a home in the magazines of the day. This volume collects all those previously unpublished stories, including the mystery/thrillers âThe Yellow Coat,â âThe Heatâs On,â âThe Wrong Cat,â and âThe Little Windowâ; humorous mainstream stories âThe Illegitimate Stage,â âWilfred,â and âThe Iron Maidenâ; serious mainstream stories âThe Cageâ and âA Lesson in Historyâ; South Sea adventure stories âPaulâs Friendâ and âThe Waters of Kan-Eâ; and science fiction tales âPublic Hearingâ and âThe Daddy Box.â\n\nReaders can now appreciate the writing of one of the fieldâs masters in a kaleidoscope of stories that have not previously seen print. Enjoy.\n\nâBrian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson"
