        "text": "When Tom Hardy played Heathcliff to Charlotte Riley’s Cathy in ITV's adaptation of Wuthering Heights in 2009, their passion continued off screen and the pair were soon engaged. Sadly, the actors’ love story seems to have come to no more of a happy ending than that of Emily Brontë’s characters.\n\nMandrake hears that the couple's wedding has been put on hold. It is said that Hardy, 35, who played Bane in the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, is being comforted by Noomi Rapace, the 33-year-old star of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nLast year, the Hammersmith-born Hardy told me that Riley, who starred in the Channel 4 series World Without End, was “a difficult woman to pin down” when it came to choosing a wedding date.\n\n“You’d have to ask Charlotte when we’re getting married,” he said. “She’s always so busy with work.”\n\nRiley, 31, who will appear opposite Tom Cruise in the big-budget film All You Need Is Kill, responded in January: “That’s not true at all. He’s a cheeky bugger. We are desperate to do it, but I’ll never have a celebrity wedding. It will be low key, with family and friends.”\n\nShe was nowhere to be seen last week when Hardy and Rapace attended a gala dinner hosted by Denise Rich for her Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation, at Battersea Power Station. The pair stayed close together throughout the evening and could be seen cuddling while the pop star Jessie J performed songs. They later left together.\n\nHardy is currently shooting the Hollywood thriller Animal Rescue with Noomi, who divorced her fellow Swedish actor Ola Rapace in 2011 after 10 years of marriage. She and Hardy are due to appear together again, in Sir Ridley Scott’s film Child 44.\n\nRiley shared a home in London with Hardy, who has a son Louis, aged four, from a relationship with Rachael Speed. He and Speed met when she was an assistant director on The Virgin Queen.\n\nHe was previously married to Sarah Ward, a producer, but the couple divorced in 2004 after five years of marriage when his drink and drugs problem spiralled out of control."
