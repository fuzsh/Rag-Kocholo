Her parents did not remain together, so she moved to Iceland with her mother and stepfather at the age of five. At the age of seven, she made her film debut in a role in the film \"In the Shadow of the Raven.\"\n\nEarly Career\n\nAfter her exposure to film as a child, Rapace decided to pursue a career in acting. At the age of 15, she enrolled in a theatre school in Stockholm. In 1996, she made her television debut as the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the soap series, \"Tre Kronor.\" She then continued her studies at the acting school Skara Skolscen from 1998 to 1999.

She won the Guldbagge Award, Sweden's top film award, and was also nominated for a BAFTA Award and a European Film Award. She subsequently appeared in \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\" and \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.\" The films were later recut into a six-part miniseries called \"Millennium,\" which aired in Sweden. Rapace received a nomination for the International Emmy Award for Best Actress. The film series later went on to be reshot and produced in Hollywood, starring actress Rooney Mara.\n\nOther Film Success\n\nFollowing the large success of the \"Millennium\" series, Rapace was able to launch her international career and begin taking English-speaking roles. She landed a role in Guy Ritchie's \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" in 2011. She was soon after cast in Ridley Scott's film \"Prometheus,\" which became a massive hit. In November 2012, she appeared in a music video for the Rolling Stones' song \"Doom and Gloom.\"\n\nIn 2013, she starred in the erotic thriller, \"Passion,\" along with Rachel McAdams, which was a remake of the French thriller, \"Love Crime.\" She also appeared in \"Dead Man Down\" with Isabelle Huppert and Colin Farrell. The following year, in 2014, she starred in another thriller called \"The Drop,\" along with Tom Hardy, Matthias Schoenaerts, and James Gandolfini.

She continued her work in thrillers in the film \"Bright\" and the spy thriller \"Unlocked\" alongside Michael Douglas, Orlando Bloom, Toni Collette, and John Malkovich. She then appeared in \"What Happened to Monday\" alongside Glenn Close and William Dafoe and the sci-fi thriller \"Rupture\" by director Steven Shainbert.\n\nIn May of 2015, she was cast to play famed opera singer Maria Callas in the biopic film directed by Niki Caro.

In 2020, she appeared in two films – \"The Secrets We Keep\" and \"Here Are the Young Men.\" In 2021, she appeared in the film \"The Trip\" and also \"Lamb,\" an Icelandic fantasy drama film by director Valdimar Johannson. The film was selected as the Icelandic entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards. The film received generally positive reviews and performed better in the United States than any other Icelandic film in history.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2001, Rapace married Swedish actress Ola Norell.
