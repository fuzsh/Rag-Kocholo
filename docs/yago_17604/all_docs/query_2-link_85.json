        "text": "Noomi Rapace has vowed to never get a tattoo because she would ''go crazy'' and ink her whole body.\n\nThe \"Girl With a Dragon Tattoo\" actress fears she would end up completely covered in body art if she got her first inking, but admits she did once try to tattoo herself but it ended in disaster before ''disappearing'' after a month.\n\nShe said: ''I know if I started, I would go crazy. I would end up covered top to toe. I never do things the middle way.\n\n''I tried to tattoo myself a couple of times. It just started to bleed a lot.\n\n''It was black and red and a mess, and then it disappeared about a month later. So no, I don't have any.''\n\nThe 34-year-old actress — who has 4-year-old son Lev with ex-husband Ola Rapace — also admits she doesn't do things in her career by half as she feels like ''a loser'' when she isn't working and loves being on a movie set.\n\nShe added to Metro newspaper: ''For me, work and life go together. I had 10 days off this summer, but I spent the time coming up withtwo ideas for films that are being written now.\n\n''I think my brain is just wired to work.\n\n''My heart is wherever I am — I've always been like that — and to be in the room with another actor, that's magic and pure joy for me.\n\n''I always do things 100 percent.''"
