        "text": "The official James Bond Twitter account announced today two additions to the cast of Skyfall, the 23rd James Bond film.\n\nFirst, they confirmed recent reports that British actress Helen McCrory -- perhaps best known to IGN readers for her role as Narcissa Malfoy in the Harry Potter films -- has been cast.\n\nThey also announced that Swedish actor Ola Rapace (Wallander) has been cast in the Sam Mendes-directed sequel. Neither actors' characters were revealed.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Ola Rapace is married to actress Noomi Rapace, who played the title role in the original The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and its two sequels. Bond star Daniel Craig stars in the forthcoming Hollywood retelling of the bestselling novel.\n\nSkyfall commenced filming today in London."
