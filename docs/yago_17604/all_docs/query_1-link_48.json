        "text": "It would be easy to be intimidated by Noomi Rapace. Striding into a members’ club in west London with her fantastical cheekbones and extraordinary brown leather jacket and trousers combo, she looks like an intergalactic hipster. The Swedish actress is known for her intense preparation, learning to kickbox and ride a motorbike for her title role as the cyber-heroine Lisbeth Salander in the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and delivering a real lamb on camera for the 2021 folk horror Lamb (“My hands were inside the sheep’s vagina.”).\n\nYet Rapace — pronounced rupp-ass — turns out to be lovely, arriving for lunch without a publicist, asking about my kids and high fiving me in her moments of delight, of which there are several."
