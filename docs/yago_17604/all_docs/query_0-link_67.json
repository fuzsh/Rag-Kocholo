        "text": "James Bond is back in action on the set of Skyfall, but the casting announcements have not ended. The film's official Twitter feed announced that Helen McCrory and Ola Rapace are now attached in undisclosed roles.\n\nMcCrory is well known to Harry Potter fans, she played Narcissa Malfoy in the franchise. She will be seen next in Martin Scorsese's Hugo. Rapace is best known in Swedish cinema and is the former husband of actress Noomi Rapace.\n\nThey join Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Dame Judi Dench, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw. Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost. Skyfall arrives in theaters on November 9, 2012."
