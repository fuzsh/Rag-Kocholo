        "text": "THE PERFORMER | Noomi Rapace\n\nTHE SHOW | Apple TV+’s Constellation\n\nTHE EPISODE | “The Left Hand of God” (Feb. 28, 2024)\n\nTHE PERFORMANCE | Ever since returning from her near-fatal mission aboard the ISS, astronaut Jo Ericsson had kept it together.\n\nHad being the operative word.\n\nAs Constellation reached the midpoint of its season, Jo uncovered more clues, of increasing size, that something is askew with the world she came home to. Rapace in turn brilliantly ratcheted up the magnitude of Jo’s confusion, bit by bit.\n\nBefore things got too incredible, Jo processed some “everyday” surprises — including Magnus’ disclosure that, having sensed before her mission that their marriage was kaput, he met, and kissed, someone. Jo at first uttered but one word (“What?”), but Rapace’s expression spoke volumes about how this woman who had left behind a great marriage had been wildly blindsided.\n\nThings were also relatable when Jo met with her shrink and recounted the incongruities before her. The family car is blue, not the red she remembers. The home has a piano, yet she doesn’t play. Oh, and she has been having visions (hallucinations?) of her dead colleague Paul. Rapace listed these plainly, but you could see in her eyes how the oddities were adding up for Jo.\n\nThen things got weird. Jo doubled over from a blinding pain when near the CAL. She saw janitors enter her office to pack it up, yet they didn’t acknowledge her. In the middle of speaking before Alice’s class, Jo called out the teacher for being Magnus’ fling. (“Is it you…?” she said to the back of the classroom. “It it her…?”) And then the accident an increasingly agitated Jo nearly got the family into on the drive home.\n\nWhen Jo discovered that night that Magnus had invited over her colleague/alleged paramour to discuss her dissociation, Rapace had us rapt as Jo struggled to make sense of it all, including Frederick’s own belief they were having an affair. “Honestly, I didn’t remember…. I don’t remember,” she insisted to Magnus. “Maybe this isn’t the same place I left?”\n\nCapping Rapace’s showcase was an intense sequence in which Jo listened to some tapes mysteriously mailed to her by someone in Denmark, proving that someone was able to hear her desperate hails from the ISS. Rapace had us on edge as Jo accused Magnus of being in on a scheme to keep her suppressed with anti-psychotics. “I knew you could all hear me when I was up there! You were going to leave me up there to die!” she bellowed, before accidentally knocking Magnus down, cracking his head on a rail of the piano.\n\nWhat is going on? We feel like we’re starting to put it together, and Rapace has us rooting for Jo to do same."
