        "text": "This article is updated frequently as titles leave and enter Max. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nHBO Max is now Max. Once upon a time, the streaming service was where you could stream blockbusters like Dune (Part One) and The Matrix Resurrections on the same day they landed in theaters, but that era long gone. These days, Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max is best understood as the streaming service with a dense catalog of classic films, pulling from generations of the Warner Bros. catalog, as well as hosting Criterion, TCM, and Studio Ghibli (at least for as long as the merged Warner Bros. Discovery holds onto its licensing deals).\n\nBut you’re not here to celebrate the size of Max’s library. You want help navigating it. The streaming giant’s deep, wide bench makes it perhaps the hardest service to pare down to 30 great films, but somehow we found a way. Our aim is to pull from a cross-section of what the service offers, including recent additions (this month look for Dune: Part Two and The Florida Project), enduring classics (Night of the Living Dead and Singin’ in the Rain), award winners (Spirited Away), under-the-radar gems (Funny Games), general Vulture favorites (Dune: Part Two), and even films that offer an offbeat story but can’t-miss performances from its stars (The Lighthouse).\n\nYou’ll find our selections organized into five genre categories — drama, action, horror, comedy, and family-friendly — and each week we cycle our recommendations, whether in response to changes in the Max library or just to keep things fresh. Just because a movie no longer appears on this list doesn’t mean it’s been removed from Max. We just want to give some other films a moment in the spotlight, starting with this week’s critic’s pick below. If there’s an under-appreciated movie on the service that you think we should consider for inclusion, please let us know at streamliner@vulture.com.\n\nThis Week’s Critic’s Pick\n\n*Where the Wild Things Are\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRuntime: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Spike Jonze\n\nIn 2009, Spike Jonze adapted the Maurice Sendak classic children’s story in a way that only he could. Max Records plays a boy who flees his trouble home to find an island of creatures known as the Wild Things, who make Max their king. A fascinating, beautiful film that works on multiple levels, this is one of the best movies of 2009, a flick that works differently but equally for parents and children.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Max’s catalogue to surface acclaimed, surprising, or otherwise noteworthy titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each, organizes them by category, then writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just Oscar winners or popcorn flicks: These films present interesting ideas, made an impact on cinema, and changed our culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nDrama\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRuntime: 2h 15m\n\nDirector: Ang Lee\n\nHeath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this romantic drama, one of the best films of the ‘00s. Adapted from the short story by Annie Proulx, Ang Lee’s film is tender and heartbreaking, the story of unaccepted love between two men in the American West. It features some of the career-best work from Ledger, Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, and Michelle Williams.\n\nCasablanca\n\nYear: 1942\n\nRuntime: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nOne of the most popular films of all time, Casablanca is now over eight decades old, but it’s still being watched somewhere every single day. Why has the story of Rick and Ilsa sustained as generations of other movies have come and gone? There’s something timeless in this tale of an ex-pat (Humphrey Bogart) who is asked to help the love of his life (Ingrid Bergman) escape the city of Casablanca during World War II. This is the first movie that so many people think of when they hear the phrase “classic cinema” for a reason.\n\nClèo From 5 to 7\n\nYear: 1962\n\nRuntime: 1h 29m\n\nDirector: Agnès Varda\n\nThe Queen of the French New Wave has a strong presence on Max because of her deep catalog in the streamer’s Criterion section, and you owe it to yourself to learn more about one of the most vital and important filmmakers of all time. This is probably her most popular film, the tale of a French singer who is awaiting test results that could confirm she has cancer. It’s a deeply powerful and philosophical character study, and the perfect gateway to discovering an essential filmmaker.\n\nDune: Parts One & Two\n\nYear: 2021, 2024\n\nRuntime: 2h 36m, 2h 46m\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nYou can now watch the entire Dune saga to date on Max, the exclusive home to the highest grossing film of 2024 so far. The second half of Villeneuve’s saga fulfills the promise of the first, turning the set-up of the 2021 film into a full-blooded action tale of a new messiah. Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya lead an all-star cast in a film that understands both scope and character. It may not play quite as well at home as it did in theaters, but it still rocks.\n\nIn the Mood for Love\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Wong Kar-wai\n\nOne of the best films ever made, Wong Kar-wai’s 2000 drama is the story of a man (Tony Leung) and a woman (Maggie Cheung) who form a delicate relationship of glances and brief touches but can never fulfill their obvious passion for one another. Set in 1962 Hong Kong, it is a gorgeous film, filled with color and music that tell the story as much as dialogue or action. Filled with longing, cultural imposition, and regret, In the Mood for Love captivates every time you see it. It’s like entering a dream.\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nIs this the best COVID lockdown movie? Sure, it came out the year before, but a lot of people watched it on streaming while they were going crazy with people with whom they were stuck. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are fearless in Robert Eggers’ black-and-white nightmare about two New England lighthouse keepers who learn that nothing is scarier than being trapped with someone unbearable. It’s a twisted gem.\n\nMelancholia\n\nYear: 2011\n\nRuntime: 2h 16m\n\nDirector: Lars von Trier\n\nOne of Lars von Trier’s best films is this 2011 sci-fi/drama starring Kirsten Dunst as a woman who becomes aware that the world is about to end. Von Trier has said the film is an allegory for his depression, something that can come out of nowhere like an apocalyptic event. It feels particularly appropriate for the mid-2020s too.\n\nMinari\n\nYear: 2021\n\nRuntime: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: Lee Isaac Chung\n\nWhat a delicate and beautiful movie this is. Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri star as a pair of South Korean immigrants who move to the heartland of America with their son (Alan Kim) and her mother (Youn Yuh-jung, who won the Oscar) in the 1980s. Semi-autobiographical, this is the kind of character-driven storytelling that we seem to be getting increasingly less from the movie machine.\n\nParasite\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 2h 12m\n\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\nRemember not that long ago before the world changed, and we could all rally around a South Korean film becoming the first foreign flick ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture? It really was a crazy time. Thanks to Hulu’s relationship with distributor Neon, the streamer was the only place you’ll find Bong Joon-ho’s hysterical and thrilling study of class conflict for a long time, but the beloved thriller has now dropped on Max too.\n\nRaging Bull\n\nYear: 1980\n\nRuntime: 2h 9m\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nAs the decade turned, one of the best American filmmakers reunited with his muse to deliver what is widely considered one of the best films of the 1980s, possibly the best. Much has been written about the physical transformation that would win Robert De Niro an Oscar for this film, but there’s more to this story of Jake LaMotta than just that. It’s an unforgettable character study of violence, rage, and self-destruction.\n\nUncut Gems\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 2h 16m\n\nDirectors: The Safdies\n\nAdam Sandler earned the best reviews of his career for this tense drama/thriller about a New York jeweler who has a little bit of a gambling problem. As he spirals the drain of life, he tries to sell a rare gem and make money on a Celtics playoff game. Vibrant and anxiety-inducing, it’s one of the best movies of the 2010s, a movie that now seems ahead of its time given the increasing gambling addiction in this country.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\n\nThe Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film is exclusively available on Max. Based on the novel of the same name by Martin Amis, it’s the story of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoss and his family, who live just outside the concentration camp. As they live and profit off horror, the sights and sounds of the Holocaust give the film a terrifying, unsettling foundation, reminding us how often true evil can be right next door.\n\nComedy\n\n*Amelie\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 2h 2m\n\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how much this Jean-Pierre Jeunet romantic comedy took over pop culture in 2001, becoming such an international hit that it grossed over $170 million worldwide and was nominated for Best Picture. The delightful Audrey Tautou stars as the title character, a waitress who works to better the lives of those around her but struggles to find her own happiness.\n\nBarbie\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nOne of the biggest films of 2023 has already landed on Max in the form or Greta Gerwig’s daring blockbuster, a comedy that works both as a reminder of the power imagination and the fight for equality. Anyone who thinks this movie is anti-male isn’t paying any attention. The theme of the movie is that no one — not even Barbie or Ken — should be defined by traditional roles. We should all be free to play however we want. It’s a wonderful film that will truly stand the test of time.\n\nLady Bird\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nThe Barbie director’s Best Picture nominee is one of the most personal and striking coming-of-age films in years. Saoirse Ronan stars as the titular character, a young Californian who longs for someplace cooler than her own hometown. It’s a heartfelt and very smart film, buoyed by great performances throughout, including Ronan, Tracy Letts, Timothee Chalamet, Lucas Hedges, Beanie Feldstein, and Laurie Metcalf, who was robbed of that Oscar.\n\nLegally Blonde\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic\n\nLong before she won an Oscar or worked magic with The Morning Show, Reese Witherspoon turned a ditzy blonde into a comedy star in this 2001 romantic comedy from director Robert Luketic. It could be stretching it to call this silly fluff “great” but what elevates the saga of Elle Woods from sorority queen to legal eagle is the total charm and commitment of Witherspoon herself. It’s one of her most likable and memorable performances.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nYear: 1952\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Stanley Done\n\nMovies don’t get more delightful than this beloved classic about backstage drama on the advent of the talkie. Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor are as charming as charming can be, and Singin’ in the Rain contains some of the best choreography of its era, and not just in the titular number. It’s joyous from front to back. Honestly, you have to be kind of a jerk not to like this movie.\n\nZola\n\nYear: 2020\n\nRuntime: 1h 26m\n\nDirector: Janicza Bravo\n\nThe best movie based on a Twitter thread. Aziah “Zola” King started a story on Twitter back in the days when it was still fun and good in 2015, recounting a tale too crazy not to be true. Taylour Paige, Riley Keough, and a stunningly great Colman Domingo star in the film version of that tale, the journey of a stripper and her friend to Tampa, where things go wrong in wild and unpredictable ways.\n\nAction\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 2h 1m\n\nDirector: Ang Lee\n\nOne of the most successful foreign language films of all time, Ang Lee’s 2000 wuxia epic was so popular that it landed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, along with nine other nominations (winning four). It’s a gorgeous epic based on the Chinese novel by Wang Dulu that stars the legendary Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and Chang Chen. It hasn’t aged a day in the over-two decades since its release.\n\n*Love Lies Bleeding\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 1h 44m\n\nDirector: Rose Glass\n\nOne of the best films of 2024 is already on Max. Get to it. Kristen Stewart continues her incredible career in this follow-up from Saint Maud director Rose Glass, a pulpy, sweaty, neo-noir about a gym manager whose life is changed when she meets a bodybuilder, played by Katy O’Brian. The pair unite to take on Stewart’s crime lord father, played unforgettably by Ed Harris. It’s an unpredictable genre hybrid that won’t be forgotten.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 2h 1m\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nHave you seen the Furiosa trailer?! It’s insane and easily one of the most anticipated films of 2024. Go back to its predecessor, one of the best action movies ever made. This sequel rocked the world when it was released in 2015 on its way to winning multiple Oscars and really setting a new bar for practical action effects. George Miller went into the desert and returned with one of the most ambitious, insane, downright impossible action epics ever made.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 2h 58m\n\nDirector: Peter Jackson\n\nThe Oscar-winning franchise by Peter Jackson bounces around the streaming services with alarming regularity, now finding its way to Max for an indeterminate amount of time. Watch the entire saga of Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gange, and the rest of the Fellowship while you can.\n\nRobocop\n\nYear: 1987\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Paul Verhoeven\n\nPeople like to point at ‘80s movies and say they were ahead of their time, but this may be most true about Paul Verhoeven’s 1987 masterpiece, a film that foretold how technology would impact law enforcement in ways that took decades to come true. A brilliant action satire, this is the story of a Detroit cop who is murdered and revived as the title character, a superhuman cyborg enforcer. It’s even more riveting and relevant almost four decades later. Note: Both original era sequels and the 2010s reboot are also on Max.\n\n*Unbreakable\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s best film remains this story of an unexpected hero, a man who gets into a car crash and discovers that he may not be like most ordinary men. Bruce Willis is great in the lead role, his stoicism balanced by a fun performance from Samuel L. Jackson as his worldly opposite. Follow it up with the sequel Glass, which isn’t currently streaming for subscribers anywhere but is widely available for rent or purchase.\n\nHorror\n\nCarrie\n\nYear: 1976\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Brian De Palma\n\nLong before Stephen King was an entire industry, he was the guy who wrote Carrie, a 1974 novel about a bullied teen girl who unleashes hell on her classmates. Every once in a while, there’s a perfect combination of source material and creatives, and that’s what happened when King, De Palma, and Sissy Spacek combined forces here. Horror movie history would be made. Note: The underrated Chloe Grace Moretz remake is also on Max.\n\nFunny Games\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Michel Haneke\n\nMichael Haneke is one of the most daring filmmakers alive, willing to shock viewers to make a point. Perhaps his most divisive film remains this 1997 shocker about a family who are essentially held hostage in their vacation home in Austria. Over the course of the day, the criminals basically torture this family, and through fourth-wall breaks, Haneke interrogates why people would even want to watch something like this, illuminating what art can reveal about the dark side of humanity.\n\nNight of the Living Dead\n\nYear: 1968\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nDirector: George A. Romero\n\nThe movie that changed it all. It’s really hard to overstate the impact that George A. Romero’s classic black-and-white masterpiece had on not only the zombie genre, but DIY microbudget horror filmmaking. So many people have been chasing that game-changing impact of Night of the Living Dead in the half-century since it came out, but it’s the original that’s passed the test of time.\n\nScream\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Wes Craven\n\nThe Ghostface killer came back in January 2022 with the release of Scream, the fifth film in this franchise and the first since the death of Wes Craven, and the fun continued with another sequel in 2023 (before the wheels came off in the pre-production of a seventh film). Even the makers of the new movies would suggest that fans go back and watch the original films to see how Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) got here. All four of the Craven films are available now on Max. The first movie is still a flat-out genre masterpiece.\n\nFor Kids and Family\n\nSpirited Away\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 2h 4m\n\nDirector: Hayao Miyazaki\n\nAlmost all of the Studio Ghibli films are on Max, the now exclusive home to them when it comes to streaming. The truth is that we could devote about 10 percent of this list to Hayao Miyazaki and his colleagues, but we’ll give up some that space and just point you here to the ranking of the entire output of the most important modern animation studio in the world. Start with Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Castle in the Sky. You won’t stop.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nYear: 1939\n\nRuntime: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of it? Seriously, what could possibly be written if you’re on the fence about The Wizard of Oz? Maybe you haven’t seen it since you were a little kid? Revisit the journey of Dorothy over the rainbow if that’s the case and appreciate this wonderful fantasy on a new level.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
