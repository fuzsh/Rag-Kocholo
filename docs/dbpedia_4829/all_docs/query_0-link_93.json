        "text": "There’s no denying that Disney makes excellent and memorable children’s movies (still crying over the ending of Toy Story 4), but I wholeheartedly believe that some of the most magical movies for kids were made during the ’80s.\n\nI say this because it’s absolutely true and also because I idealize my childhood—one where there were no scheduled playdates, MTV was everything, and nobody knew what gluten was. In fact, if you look closely, you’ll notice there’s one thing missing from most movies of this time: parents. Where are they? Living their lives, perhaps, but most importantly, giving their children space to have the individualistic experiences every child deserves.\n\nSelf-appointed 1980s pop culture expert Adam Garcia (aka my husband) also agrees with me. As he pointed out, “In the ’80s, helicopter parenting wasn’t a thing. Kids were free to take on adventures independent of their parents, and movies reflected that. Kids were the main characters of movies, and they were the ones saving the world—or the day—with their own grit and determination.”\n\nBelow, we’ve put together a non-definitive list of 40+ nostalgic movies from my childhood in which kids build upon their self-reliance, take on teamwork, and save the day.\n\nA note for parents: A PG rating in an ’80s movie may look more like a PG-13 rating by today’s standards when it comes to violence, language, thematic elements, and nudity (the PG-13 rating was introduced in 1984). If you’re concerned, we suggest watching it without your kids first.\n\n’80s Family Movies: Comedies\n\nHoney, I Shrunk The Kids (1989)\n\nRated: PG | Where to Watch: Disney+\n\nWhen a couple kids sneak into an inventor’s lab to retrieve their rogue baseball, his experimental shrink ray accidentally shrinks them to teeny-tiny size. When the inventor returns, he destroys the device and throws it in the trash in a fit of despair—throwing the kids out along with it. Now, the four children must survive the treacherous journey back to the house through a yard where sprinklers are more like rainstorms and worms are giant monsters.\n\nBig (1988)\n\nRated: PG | Where to Watch: Disney+\n\nWhen 13-year-old Josh Baskin makes a wish on a Zoltar machine at a fairground, he doesn’t expect his wish “to be big” to come true. In this hilarious and heartwarming film, a young Tom Hanks plays a teenager in a man’s body. With the help of his best friend, Billy, he discovers the reality of being a grown up—from working at a toy company to navigating the complexities of adult relationships.\n\nSixteen Candles (1984)\n\nRated: PG | Where to Watch: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV\n\nIn this beloved rom-com, angsty teenager Samantha is absolutely dreading her 16th birthday, as it’s being totally overshadowed by her sister’s wedding. Meanwhile, she’s also preoccupied with her crush on Jake—a cool, older boy who she’s scared will never notice her—and having to constantly blow off the affections of Ted, one of the nerdiest boys in school who seems to be the only person to take any interest in her. A note for parents: This movie includes high school drinking, brief nudity, and racial stereotyping.\n\nAdventures in Babysitting (1987)\n\nRated: PG-13 | Where to Watch: Disney+\n\nWhat should be a quiet night of babysitting turns into an unexpected adventure when high school senior and babysitter Chris Parker takes the Anderson kids into downtown Chicago to rescue her best friend who just ran away from home. A note for parents: There are quite a few swear words and scenes you might need to explain to younger kids, which explains the PG-13 rating.\n\nMore kid-friendly comedies from the ’80s:\n\nThe Adventures of Milo & Otis — G (1986)\n\nThe Muppets Take Manhattan — G (1984)\n\nGhostbusters — PG (1984)\n\nBeetlejuice — PG (1988)\n\nGirls Just Wanna Have Fun — PG (1985)\n\nHarry and the Hendersons — PG (1987)\n\nShort Circuit — PG (1986)\n\nTeen Wolf — PG (1985)\n\nBatteries Not Included — PG (1987)\n\nOne Crazy Summer — PG (1986)\n\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off — PG (1986)\n\nTroop Beverly Hills — PG (1989)\n\n’80s Family Movies: Animated Films\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nRated: G | Where to Watch: Disney+\n\nIn this beloved Disney classic, rebellious 16-year-old mermaid Ariel is fascinated with life on land.
