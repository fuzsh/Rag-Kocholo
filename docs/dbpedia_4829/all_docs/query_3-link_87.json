        "text": "Psychiatrist has a very brief role at the end. The film deals with adolescent mental illness and difficulties throughout, but it isn't the main theme, which is friendship.\n\nI liked it very much, although I wasn't convinced by Charlie's friends, who seem to demand a lot and give back very little.\n\nalthough this is a wonderful film, I can't help but get bored around half way through. I guess once you know what happens, it's not quite as enthralling at this point, but it does have longevity as I've enjoyed watching it many times.\n\nOk so I'm stretching the rules a little here, as there isn't a psychologist within sight...BUT...Robert Redford plays the part of someone who is sensitive to troubled souls. Without giving anything away, his empathy, patience, and willingness to listen are key.\n\nI think this film reminds us that you don't need a degree in Psychology to make a difference to someone simply by listening.\n\nSee episode 'NOEL' Season 2\n\nThis episode is all about a psychologist treating someone with PTSD.\n\nSee episode 'Night Five' Season 4\n\nThe president is suffering from insomnia.\n\nAnd if you haven't seen The West Wing before you REALLY SHOULD. Although there's quite a bit of American patriotism shoved in your face the dialogue is excellent... no, I'll go further... for a TV show it's outstanding, but hard to follow especially if you don't know much about US politics.\n\nI watched this a few years ago and had a sort of love/hate relationship with it. Gabriel Byrne acts the part of the psychologist very well (as do the other actors who play therapists) and generally the cases are interesting. Of course this is TV so it's all spiced up for more dramatic effect, but it feels convincing and definitely similar to real-life therapy.\n\nWhat I didn't enjoy was the arguing between the main therapist and his supervisor. I suppose it makes it more believable but watching people argue isn't really my idea of a swell evening.\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in therapy.\n\nI've now watched this several times and each time I've enjoyed it more. At first I found the plot difficult to follow, (which is I think the reason why I didn't love it to start with).\n\nThe psychoanalyst here is played exceptionally well. He plays a fascinating character who draws you in and leaves you thinking about after. His patient, also very well acted, is however a little pedestrian. Their relationship is described as 'deeply powerful' in the IMDB summary of the film, but I don't think I agree with this. I thought that the cultural barrier between them seemed too strong.\n\nDefinitely try this. I found it ultimately rewarding and made me go back and watch it again!\n\nWhat's the perfect revenge for an inept psychologist who overcharges?\n\nOne teenager's answer to this question is explored at the very start of 'Cruel Intentions' - a staple of the late 90s slew of vaguely amusing high school movies. It's about what could happen when parentally neglected, super rich adolescents have too much time on their hands...\n\nI make it sound awful, but actually it's quite fun and engrossing... that is, if you can sit through over an hour of adolescent angst."
