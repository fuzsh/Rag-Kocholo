        "text": "As an actor, director, and co-founder of the Sundance Film Festival, Charles Robert Redford—who celebrates his 87th birthday today—has left an indelible mark on American cinema. The archetypal leading man, Redford has appeared in political thrillers, crime capers, and romantic dramas over his 60-year career; in films about baseball, skiing, sailing, the rodeo, and several about journalism. And buttressing many of those performances are some wonderful leading ladies, from an adolescent Scarlett Johansson to the likes of Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood, and Meryl Streep—each of whom Redford worked with on multiple occasions.\n\nAcross the board, his costars have praised his integrity, his kindness, and his remarkable good looks, making the convincing case for Redford as a once-in-a-lifetime star. Here, we look back at some of the movies—and the women—that have helped shape his iconic filmography."
