        "text": "Hi, today I‚Äôm reviewing The Conversation from 1974.\n\nThis is an absolutely wonderful movie with Gene Hackman as the main character Harry Caul, a guy who is a surveillance expert, although there are some doubts raised as to his, what ‚Ä¶ capabilities? His shrewdness? In any event, he‚Äôs hired to investigate, to do surveillance on a couple of people, a couple who ‚Ä¶ the situation appears to be one thing and turns out to be another, to put it in a nutshell. And, yes, the story was inspired by, the character of Harry Caul himself was inspired by a surveillance expert who ended up being a consultant on the film.\n\nBut this is a very interesting study in the technology, number one, which is, it‚Äôs fascinating to compare now to then, and also the ethics behind all this, and how Caul deals with it himself and Caul as a character and what he represents in terms of what does this all mean?\n\nYeah, it‚Äôs very creepy the more you think about it. And it‚Äôs hard to know exactly who to trust in this movie and where they‚Äôre coming from at any given time. Yet at the same time, you can also look at Harry and say, geez, how could you let that guy do that to you? Slip you that pen and not think that he was pulling something on you there? I mean, I don‚Äôt want to get too much into the specifics, if you haven‚Äôt seen the movie.\n\nIt‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs one of those movies that will make you think afterward. If you see it, especially if you see it two or three times or as many times as I‚Äôve seen it. I don‚Äôt even know how many times I‚Äôve seen it, but I just saw it recently for a group discussion at the Anne Arundel County Library and did the worst of all possible jobs at being a moderator, I think. I don‚Äôt think I did a great job of introducing the film. That‚Äôs for darn sure. And I‚Äôm not doing a great job of reviewing it either, am I? I guess I am. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm giving you my honest opinion.\n\nI really enjoyed the movie. I thought it reflected the time so well. Things that I remember from then, and it also just made me think about the whole perception versus reality thing. And the other thing was, I wanted to say that Harrison Ford is so creepy in this movie. I mean, so creepy. That‚Äôs one of the things I remember most about it. And he‚Äôs great though. He‚Äôs great to look at. Oh, and he provided the actual cookies in one of the scenes that he‚Äôs in, apparently, from what I read. And, oh, Roger Ebert wrote an absolutely fantastic review that goes into all sorts of aspects of this movie. It is like my mind exploded after reading the review. I was just so taken with it.\n\nAnd then finally, one of the things that didn‚Äôt come up in our conversation was the two shots of Harry getting off of a city bus. I thought, now how did they get those shots? Did they have to arrange it with the city? Did they get a bus? Did they get one that was made up to look like a city bus? How did that work exactly? Did they have to get a permit? I guess that was a real street. Yes.\n\nSo I‚Äôm thinking all these things and wondering how they arranged that shot, those two shots. And it‚Äôs like just two little shots in the movie. So I‚Äôm obviously turning into a screenwriter, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Or I am a screenwriter, I guess I should say.\n\nI am a screenwriter. There, I said it. All right, that turned out to be a bit longer than I expected. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it. Take care. Be seeing you.\n\n*****\n\nDirected by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nScreenplay by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nProduced by Francis Ford Coppola\n\nPS: Among other things I failed to mention as I was rambling on about this film reviewed this are what a lonely protagonist Harry Caul is, as demonstrated by the distance he keeps from a woman he‚Äôs (maybe) in love with, even as he pretty much stalks her. I think her break up with him is part of what affects his judgment overall.\n\nGene Hackman puts in an amazing performance. So restrained, all the emotion running beneath a detached affect. The cast is all top-notch and mostly newcomers.\n\nHighly recommended viewing.\n\nPPS: Check out this quote from Roger Ebert!\n\n‚ÄúThe Conversation‚Äù comes from another time and place than today‚Äôs thrillers, which are so often simple-minded. This movie is a sadly observant character study, about a man who has removed himself from life, thinks he can observe it dispassionately at an electronic remove, and finds that all of his barriers are worthless.\n\nUm ‚Ä¶ ahem! üôÇ"
