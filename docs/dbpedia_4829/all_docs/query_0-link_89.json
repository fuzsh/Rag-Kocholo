        "text": "For years, my friend Mark has been urging me to see “Diva.” Unless he was severely mistaken, he wrote in an email, “you will love” it. Well, 41 years after its debut in France, “Diva” is back on a big screen — Film Forum’s — for a week, restored and ready to prove Mark right. I did love it. My fate was sealed the minute some poor lady stumbles off a train and staggers through the station in a snazzy shirt dress. She’s not wearing any shoes, and Chantal Deruaz, the actor playing her, musters what distress she can for the chase that ensues. It ends with her collapsed on a Paris street, because a puckish, punky blond — he looks a lot like Flea — has flung an object in her back, as one might a card in a magic show. Seems like an ice pick. But it’s an awl. An awl.\n\nHere’s instant evidence of this movie’s ravishing, style-soaked priorities. Now, some Hollywood type might’ve opted for a gun. But in the mondo chic of Jean-Jacques Beineix, the murder weapon is something you’d use for piercing leather. And the character dies in daylight, with only a whiff of drama. The soundtrack’s accordion, bass, drums and guitar give her a woozy rock ’n’ roll micro-funeral. This is about 12 minutes in, and I was already ecstatic. What actually got me, though, was this poor, glamorously doomed woman’s final act. She slips something into one of the mailbags on the protagonist’s motorbike.\n\nIn part, what’s so delightful about this moment is the blasé purpose with which it’s been planted. But it’s not until a few scenes later that a series of jump cuts and some expository dialogue reveal that this woman hasn’t left behind a bag of coke or some other murder weapon. It’s just … a cassette tape. And because this movie’s young protagonist, Jules (Frédéric Andréi), is so ardently consumed by his fandom for an American opera star, it takes more than half the film for him (and us) to find out what’s even on the tape. And the woman who dropped it into his mailbag had faith enough that the postal system would come through for her. That’s what I’d been missing out on all these years: a movie so supremely its own thing that it seems to be making itself up as it goes, operating at the height of Beineix’s — or really anybody’s — cinematic imagination, and with an oblong belief in the redemptive potential of bureaucracy.\n\nThe obsession story kicks off the movie. Jules parks his mail-mobile and heads into one of those run-down teatros whose shabbiness imparts a kind of glory, the sort of ruin whose functionality makes the present feel like the future. Indeed, Jules has come not only to watch his beloved soprano, Cynthia Hawkins (Wilhelmenia Fernandez), perform the big aria from Alfredo Catalani’s “La Wally,” but to surreptitiously record her performance. So you have this old-ass opera being mounted in an all-but-abandoned art palace, on the one hand; and this guy, on the other, using state of-the-art technology to purloin the singing. This scene, to me, is the invention of 1980s pop cinema.\n\nCHUCK KLOSTERMAN BLASTS OFF his new book, “The Nineties,” with an assertion that this invention happens with the opening title sequence of Paul Schrader’s “American Gigolo,” which opened in February of 1980. It’s a throwaway assertion that’s really stayed with me. I’m with him. It’s just that Schrader’s movie — its materialist flash; its assertion of consumer capitalism as the new carnality — is a bridge to the ’80s from the previous decade. “Diva” is the 1980s by Immaculate Conception. It feels like the 1970s were incinerated and a movie like this is what rose from their ashes, fully formed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
