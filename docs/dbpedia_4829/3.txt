This is an original, rolled, one-sheet movie poster from 1987 for Someone to Watch Over Me starring Tom Berenger, Mimi Rogers, Lorraine Bracco, Jerry Orbach, and John Rubinstein. Ridley Scott directed the crime thriller.

The international-style poster was printed in the United States for use in theaters outside the country and features different artwork from the U.S. one-sheet poster. It measures 27” x 41” and is in very good condition with some minor edge and surface wear from previous handling. Unlike most one-sheet posters from this period, it has never been folded.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you will receive and not a stock image).

This rare and collectible poster, printed in 1987 to promote the theatrical release of Someone to Watch Over Me, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
