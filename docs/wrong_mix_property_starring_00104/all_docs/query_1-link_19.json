        "text": "The Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) mass extinction profoundly altered vertebrate ecosystems and prompted the radiation of many extant clades [1, 2]. Sharks (Selachimorpha) were one of the few larger-bodied marine predators that survived the K-Pg event and are represented by an almost-continuous dental fossil record. However, the precise dynamics of their transition through this interval remain uncertain [3]. Here, we apply 2D geometric morphometrics to reconstruct global and regional dental morphospace variation among Lamniformes (Mackerel sharks) and Carcharhiniformes (Ground sharks). These clades are prevalent predators in today&#39;s oceans, and were geographically widespread during the late Cretaceous-early Palaeogene. Our results reveal a decoupling of morphological disparity and taxonomic richness. Indeed, shark disparity was nearly static across the K-Pg extinction, in contrast to abrupt declines among other higher-trophic-level marine predators [4, 5]. Nevertheless, specific p...\n\nSharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their fossil record is represented by an abundance of teeth, which traditionally formed the basis for reconstructing large-scale diversity changes among different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding patterns in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine the dental morphology of multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction — this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago.

This is in contrast to the conditions in the Cenozoic sand sharks and thus makes it possible to regard this as a valid genus. The evolution and systematics of Eostriatolamia are reconsidered, in particular, on the basis of statistical methods. The cluster and principal component analyses were used to process a large quantity of teeth from 17 samples from the Albian-Campanian. Six or ...\n\nEoptolamna eccentrolopha gen. et sp. nov. (Chondrichthyes, Lamniformes) from the near coastal upper Barremian Artoles Formation (Early Cretaceous) of Castellote (northwestern Spain) is described on the basis of about 50 isolated teeth. This taxon represents one of the earliest lamniform sharks known to date. We hypothesize that most pre-Aptian lamniforms belong to an ancient group characterized, amongst others, by a very weak gradient monognathic heterodont dental pattern, and by tearing-type dentition. There is a nutritive groove in the lingual root protuberance in juveniles of Eoptolamna, which persists in adults. A single pair of symphysial and a pair of upper intermediate teeth might have been present. Consequently, a new family, Eoptolamnidae, is introduced to include the new form, as well as Protolamna and probably Leptostyrax. The Eoptolamnidae represent an ancient family within Lamniformes. The origin of lamniform sharks remains, however, ambiguous despite recent advances. The new Spanish taxon is widespread in the Barremian of north-eastern Spain, and occurs in a wide range of facies from near-coastal to lake deposits. This lamniform also occurs in the Lower Cretaceous of northern Africa. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 154, 278–290.\n\nOne of the major appeals of investigating disparity dynamics in the fossil record, compared to traditional assessments of taxonomic richness, is predicated on the assumption that morphology is ecologically relevant. However, this assumption is rarely tested, largely because direct extant comparators are often difficult to identify, resulting in ambiguous and unconstrained links between morphology and ecology (ecomorphology). Here we adopt modern sharks (Selachimorpha) as a model to explore the ecological (dietary) and phylogenetic nature of dental variation. Based on a dietary dataset of 150 extant sharks, including information on the relative importance of different dietary components from gut contents (e.g., fish, cephalopods, and marine mammals) and a geometric morphometric analysis of dental shape (n=42; upper toothrow), we apply a series of multivariate and phylogenetic comparative approaches to test whether feeding ecology served as a primary driver of selachimorph dental morphology. Ordination of diets based on a correspondence analysis reveals major axes of variation related to molluscivory and zooplanktivory. Third and fourth axes partition diet in relation to the size of both the predator and prey (large vertebrates vs. small invertebrates). Correlation with shark size was robust even within a phylogenetic context (p<<0.05), indicating a role of body size in partitioning some shark diets. Over 95% of the morphometric variation could be explained in six (of 41) axes. Despite a strong phylogenetic signal in several of the dietary and morphometric axes, both standard and phylogenetic canonical correlation analyses recovered significant associations between diet and morphology. Broad teeth infer a dietary preference for large vertebrates, pointed and/or multicusped implicate zooplanktivory, and some feeding on cephalopods, and lower-crowned teeth indicate a predisposition towards harder food-types (e.g., molluscs and crustaceans). Pending further data collection, the recovery of such correlations question the long-held notion that sharks are feeding generalists and demonstrate that shark dental morphology is an indicator of diet, particularly when compared to body size. Phylogeny, although associated with all data-types, does not diminish the ecological signal thereby supporting the hypothesized causal relationship between feeding ecology and morphology, with major implications for reconstructing ecological diversity patterns across the 400 million years of shark evolution.\n\nRay-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) comprise nearly half of all modern vertebrate diversity, and are an ecologically and numerically dominant megafauna in most aquatic environments. Crown teleost fishes diversified relatively recently, during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene, although the exact timing and cause of their radiation and rise to ecological dominance is poorly constrained. Here we use microfossil teeth and shark dermal scales (ichthyoliths) preserved in deep-sea sediments to study the changes in the pelagic fish community in the latest Cretaceous and early Paleogene. We find that the Cretaceous−Paleogene (K/Pg) extinction event marked a profound change in the structure of ichthyolith communities around the globe: Whereas shark denticles outnumber ray-finned fish teeth in Cretaceous deep-sea sediments around the world, there is a dramatic increase in the proportion of ray-finned fish teeth to shark denticles in the Paleocene. There is also an increase in size and numerical abundance of ray-finned fish teeth at the boundary. These changes are sustained through at least the first 24 million years of the Cenozoic. This new fish community structure began at the K/Pg mass extinction, suggesting the extinction event played an important role in initiating the modern “age of fishes.”"
