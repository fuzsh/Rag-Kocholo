        "text": "GODZILLA\n\nReal Name: Godzilla, or possibly Gojira (see comments)\n\nIdentity/Class: Terrestrial dinosaur mutate (could also be a Deviant mutate)\n\nOccupation: Rampager\n\nGroup membership: None\n\nAffiliations: Betan, Devil Dinosaur of Dinosaur World, Godzilla Squad (\"Dum Dum\" Dugan, Tamara Hashioka, Dr. Gladstone Hawkins, Hugh Howards, Gabe Jones, Robert and Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi, Jimmy Woo), Hag of the Pits of Dinosaur World, Mole Man (Harvey Elder), Moon Boy of Dinosaur World, Red Ronin (operated by Rob Takiguchi)\n\nEnemies: Avengers (Ares, Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, Captain America/Steve Rogers, Iron Man/Tony Stark, Ms. Marvel/Carol Danvers, Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff, Sentry/Robert Reynolds, Thor/Odinson, Vision, Wasp/Janet Van Dyne, Wonder Man/Simon Williams, Yellowjacket/Hank Pym), Behemoth IV (S.H.I.E.L.D. anti-Godzilla Helicarrier), Beta Beast, Champions of LA (Angel/Warren Worthington III, Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, Hercules, Iceman/Robert Drake), Doctor Demonicus (Douglas Birely) and his Demon-Troops and mutates (Batragon, Centipoor, Ghilaron, Lepirax), Fantastic Four (Human Torch/Johnny Storm, Invisible Woman/Susan Richards, Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Thing/Ben Grimm), Bill Ford, Lizard Warriors of Dinosaur World, Mega-Monsters (Krollar, Rhiahn, Triax), S.H.I.E.L.D., \"Lefty\" Walsh, West Coast Avengers (Hawkeye/Clint Barton, Iron Man/Tony Stark, Mockingbird/Bobbi Barton, Tigra/Greer Nelson), Yetrigar, a legion of licensed Japanese monsters\n\nKnown Relatives: None known\n\nAliases: Gojira (See Comments), King of the Monsters\n\nBase of Operations: Monster Island, Pacific Ocean;\n\nformerly Tokyo, Japan;\n\nUSA;\n\nAtlantic Ocean;\n\nunnamed Pacific Island\n\nFirst Appearance: (motion picture) Godzilla, King Of The Monsters, 1954); (Marvel) Godzilla#1 (August, 1977)\n\nPowers/Abilities: Godzilla was over 100 feet tall and immensely strong (Class 100, enabling Godzilla to lift/press 100 tons) as well as extremely durable. He had a semi-prehensile tail, and had human-level dexterity in his hands and use of his arms. He was amphibious and could expel radioactive flame from his mouth at will (or possibly something in his breath would ignite with oxygen to create a similar effect). He demonstrated a near human-level of intelligence and understanding.\n\nHe was later mutated into a more amphibious form, and it is not certain how this affected his abilities. He has not been seen to use his radioactive flame in this form.\n\nHistory: Godzilla is believed to be a dinosaur who somehow survived in an inert form below the surface of the ocean until the modern era. He is believed to have been mutated by nuclear weapons testing. It is also possible that Godzilla is actually a mutate created by the Deviants of Lemuria, as many of the other giant monsters from his era have been found to be active over several of the last decades (For instance, the Deviants created a race of dinosaurs that dwell in Wakanda).\n\n(Godzilla#1-2 (fb) - BTS) - Whatever his origins, Godzilla was first seen when he surfaced off the coast of Japan in 1956, during nuclear testing. Dr. Yuriko Takaguchi was present during this test as a passive resistant and witnessed Godzilla's arrival. Godzilla rampaged through the city of Tokyo on more than one occasion. Other monsters, similarly revived by the nuclear testing, also surfaced and attacked Tokyo, and Godzilla fought several of these creatures.\n\n(Godzilla#1-5) - In the modern era, Godzilla surfaced off the coast of Alaska and began his trek across the USA. At first, Godzilla was somewhat disoriented; he rampaged across Alaska, ripping apart the Alaskan Pipeline. Soon after this, he settled down and would only rampage when provoked (kind of like a really, really big Hulk). He made his way through Seattle but was lured back out to sea by S.H.I.E.L.D.. He resurfaced off the California coastline and entered San Francisco, where both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Champions of Los Angeles tried to stop him, but both groups simply ended up getting in each others way, as Godzilla destroyed the Golden Gate Bridge and one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mini-Helicarriers (See Comments). Godzilla encountered the monster Batragon and followed him back to the Aleutian Islands, where he slew the monsters of Dr. Demonicus and helped S.H.I.E.L.D. foil his plot.\n\n(Godzilla#6-8) - S.H.I.E.L.D., under the guidance of Tamara Hashioka and Dr. Takiguchi, created the Behemoth Helicarrier, which succeeded in capturing Godzilla via a gas attack. To their dismay, S.H.I.E.L.D. proved unable to hold Godzilla, who escaped soon after reviving; Tamara Hashioka and Dr. Takiguchi directed the construction of the immense robot Red Ronin to subdue him. Takiguchi's grandson, Rob, felt an empathy for Godzilla and sought to prevent Godzilla from being injured. Rob caused the robot's controls to become linked to his brain patterns so that only he could operate it. Rob, within Red Ronin, got in the middle of a few battles between Godzilla and the Behemoth. Rob did succeed in driving Godzilla away from a San Diego missile base, where it was feared his nuclear breath might activate the warheads.\n\n(Godzilla#9-11) - After destroying the Hoover Dam, Godzilla was swept into Las Vegas. After that, he made his way into the Grand Canyon, where he was attacked by Yetrigar, a giant pre-human anthropoid of apparently similar origins. Rob/Red Ronin got in the middle of that battle as well, actually helping to defeat Yetrigar by causing an avalanche to bury him.\n\n(Godzilla#12-13) - Godzilla was then beamed to the moon by an alien race, the Betans, who were seeking allies to help them against the Warlords of Mega, another alien race and the Betans' long-time enemies. Godzilla, by slaying the monstrous Beta Beast, passed the Betans' test. In turn, Godzilla was sent back to Earth, where he and Red Ronin were attacked by the three Mega-Monsters. Red Ronin was decapitated by Krollar, but Godzilla managed to slay the Mega-Monsters on his own, possibly bringing an end to the long war between the Megans and Betans.\n\n(Godzilla#14-16) - Godzilla next wandered into cattle country, where he was blamed for the disappearance of the cattle of John Hawks' ranch. However, Godzilla sniffed out the missing cattle and led the ranchers who were attempting to subdue him to where the cattle had been hidden by Lefty Walsh and Bill Ford, the true culprits.\n\n(Godzilla#17-20) - The \"Godzilla Squad\" acquired a sample of the size-altering Pym Particles from their discoverer Hank Pym, then shrunk Godzilla down to one foot in height, and captured him. However, Rob sabotaged their efforts once again, and Godzilla broke out of his cage, escaping into the New York Harbor. Godzilla made his way through New York, getting bigger in the process. When Godzilla reached 20 feet in stature, the Godzilla Squad got the idea to send him back in time to when dinosaurs roamed the Earth via a time machine.\n\n(Godzilla#21-22) - Godzilla's radiation affected the time machine so that he was transported to the alternate dimension of Dinosaur World (Earth-78411) instead of the prehistoric past. While there, he became allied with Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy in defeating the Lizard Warriors, who sought to capture them. Godzilla's radiation caused a \"slingshot effect\" that returned him to Manhattan, just as he regained his full height.\n\n(Godzilla#23-24) - The heroes of New York gathered in an effort to drive off Godzilla but were unable to succeed. Finally, Rob Takiguchi, standing on top of the Behemoth Helicarrier, appealed to Godzilla to return to the ocean and leave America before someone was hurt or killed. Godzilla then wandered off into the ocean.\n\n(Iron Man I#193-194) - Later, Godzilla's old enemy, Dr. Demonicus, succeeded in getting the better of him. Demonicus mutated him into a more amphibious form and placed him under his mental control. Demonicus had made a new base on a Pacific island, and Godzilla smashed an Avengers Quinjet piloted by Tigra when it passed nearby--this drew the other West Coast Avengers to her aid. Although they were unable to injure Godzilla, Iron Man (Tony Stark in a version of armor similar to his Mark One armor) lifted Godzilla aloft and carried him away from the island until his jets gave out, dumping both Godzilla and the armor into the ocean.\n\n(Iron Man I#196) - Godzilla returned to Demonicus' lair, carrying with him the abandoned Mark One-type Iron Man armor.\n\n(Thing I#31) - During the production of \"Devil Dinosaur: The Movie\" on an unspecified Pacific Island, Godzilla showed up and wrecked the set. When he appeared again during a camera shoot, Trimble, the special effects man, used a robot version of Devil Dinosaur to try to stop him. While Godzilla easily overpowered the robot, it did give everyone time to clear the set. After having destroyed the robot, Godzilla backed up and headed back out to sea.\n\nThe Thing was on-set to visit his then romantic interest, Sharon Ventura, who was playing one of Moon Boy's \"Small Folk.\" However, he had gotten in trouble for interfering with the film before, so he stayed in his hut and read the paper when Godzilla attacked.\n\n(Mighty Avengers#1 (fb)-BTS) - At some point, Godzilla came to live on Monster Island and reverted back to an appearance more closely resembling his original, but retained the smaller size of his Demonicus-mutated form.\n\n(Mighty Avengers#1) - Godzilla was among the Mole Man's monsters sent to attack Manhattan in retaliation for the partial destruction of his home (in actuality, a side effect of a plot by Ultron).\n\nComments: Godzilla created by Tomoyuki Tanaka (producer), Ishiro Honda (director), and\n\nEiji Tsuburaya (Special Effects Director) for Toho Productions. Godzilla was temporarily licensed by Marvel and the Marvel version was adapted/fleshed out by Doug Moench and Herb Trimpe. Now they can't even mention him by name, kind of like Fu Manchu. Denny O'Neil and Luke McDonnell did the revamped version.\n\nCheck out the Map of Godzilla's path, by Lee Seitz: godzillamap.shtml\n\nGodzilla's Japanese name was Gojira, hence the word's inclusion under aliases.\n\nCaesar Godzillatron , however, is not sure if that name applies to the comics version of Godzilla: did they ever confirm that in the series?\n\nI know that in Japan in the real world, Godzilla is called Gojira, a combination of the Japanese words for gorilla and whale. When the first movie was released in Japan, they changed it to Godzilla. Ironically, the monster is known as Godzilla everywhere EXCEPT Japan.\n\nInteresting note: according to legend, they got the name Gojira from a huge man who worked in Toho's advertising department--Gojira was his nickname.\n\nMatt Comic207: I remember an article in which the original name of Gojira was actually *misspelled* as \"Godzilla\" when it arrived in America. Some producer must've had a bad copy of the translated script for some of Raymond Burr's scenes.\n\nHumorously enough, I learned this when Newsweek (?) interviewed Godzilla directly for \"Godzilla 1985\" (after being advised not to ask him about Jet Jaguar...very touchy subject). When the interviewer greeted, \"So, Godzilla...\", the big guy replied, \"Call me God.\"\n\nIf you watch the much-panned Roland Emmerich version of Godzilla, you can see that a Japanese man describes the monster as \"gojira.\" However, Harry Shearer's character mispronounces the name as \"Godzilla,\" in homage to the original mistake.\n\nRegarding whether or not Reality-616's Godzilla is also known as \"Gojira,\" in Uncanny X-Men I#181 (1984), Page 2, Panel 3, in the \"monsters book\" (which is apparently intended to be a \"real-life\" guide for Japanese monsters who can be found in Reality-616) belonging to the Japanese schoolchildren (Jiro, Akiro, Teruki, Eiko, \"and one other\"), a silhouette of Godzilla is identified as \"Gojira.\" So there's that, anyway.\n\n--Ronald Byrd\n\nCarycomix comments: Caesar Godzillatron is right. [Also, n]ot one of the Japanese characters from Marvel's \"Godzilla\" comic ever appeared in the original Toho movies. But... the cockroach people DID appear--if only in backlit silhouette--in [the movie] Godzilla on Monster Island (1972). Could they have been an offshoot of the Leviotes? (Cockroach Conspiracy, anybody?--Kyle)\n\nKyle comments: As explained in the letter column of Godzilla#12, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier that appeared in issues#1-3 and was destroyed by Godzilla in the latter of those issues was one of two mini-carriers, similar in appearance to the original Helicarrier but smaller in size. The other mini-carrier had been destroyed, also, in Captain America I#141.\n\nSnood comments: I wouldn't mind seeing an adventure with Godzilla meeting the Monster Hunters (Bloodstone, Dr. Druid, Hurricane, Namora, Zawadi) of the 1950s. I also wouldn't mind seeing him periodically encountered in the modern era. They just can't call him by name anymore.\n\nThe Godzilla series was kind of goofy, but it was a fun read. Give it a read if you can find it.\n\nThanks toPrime Eternal for pointing out the Thing issue, which I had missed.\n\nand to Kyle Smith, for Iron Man I#196...for shame...for shame...\n\nper Caesar Godzillatron : Toho Co. Ltd in Japan created him and still owns him, and are continuing his film series (as of February 2002, 25 have been produced [26 if you count that weak iguana in 1998] and have announced a 26th).\n\nCaesar also supplied the dates of creation and the creators.\n\nIn \"Marvel Monsters: From The Files Of Ulysses Bloodstone\" within the Red Ronin entry, Elsa Bloodstone made a small comment that they need a file on Godzilla.\n\n--Snood/Dragynwulf\n\nAt about the same time the original Godzilla film was made, the Human Torch (Jim Hammond) and Toro also battled a similar giant atomic bomb-mutated dinosaur: \"Pre-History\".\n\n--Ron Fredricks\n\nImproved main image by Ron Fredricks.\n\nGodzilla profile edited/updated by Kyle Sims\n\nimages: (without ads)\n\nGodzilla#1, Cover (main)\n\nIron Man I#193, p18, pan1 (mutated by Doctor Demonicus)\n\nThing I#31, p20, pan2 (head shot, mutated)\n\nMighty Avengers#1, p2, pan1 (vs. Avengers)\n\nUncanny X-Men I#181, p2, pan3 (comments, Gojira)\n\nAppearances:\n\nGodzilla#1 (August, 1977) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Jim Mooney (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#2 (September, 1977) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Frank Giacoia & George Tuska (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#3 (October, 1977) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Tony DeZuniga (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#4 (November, 1977) - Doug Moench (writer), Tom Sutton (pencils), Tony DeZuniga (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#5 (December, 1977) - Doug Moench (writer), Tom Sutton (pencils), Klaus Janson (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#6 (January, 1978) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (artist), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#7-11 (February-June, 1978) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Fred Kida (inks), Archie Goodwin (editor)\n\nGodzilla#12-13 (July-August, 1978) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Fred Kida (inks), Jim Shooter (editor)\n\nGodzilla#14 (September, 1978) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Dan Green (inks), Jim Shooter (editor)\n\nGodzilla#15-18 (October, 1978 - January, 1979) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Dan Green (inks), Bob Hall (editor)\n\nGodzilla#19 (February, 1979) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Dan Green (inks), Mary Jo Duffy (editor)\n\nGodzilla#20-21 (March-April, 1979) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Dan Green (inks), Al Milgrom (editor)\n\nGodzilla#22 (May, 1979) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Jack Abel (inks), Al Milgrom (editor)\n\nGodzilla#23-24 (June, 1979) - Doug Moench (writer), Herb Trimpe (pencils), Dan Green (inks), Al Milgrom (editor)\n\nIron Man I#193-194 (April-May, 1985) - Dennis O'Neil (writer), Luke McDonnell (pencils), Ian Akin & Brian Garvey (inks), Mark Gruenwald (editor)\n\nIron Man I#196 (July, 1985) - Dennis O'Neil (writer), Rich Buckler (pencils), Ian Akin & Brian Garvey (inks), Mark Gruenwald (editor)\n\nThing I#31 (January, 1986) - Mike Carlin (writer), Ron Wilson (pencils), Kim DeMulder (inks), Mark Gruenwald (editor)\n\nMighty Avengers#1 (May, 2007) - Brian Michael Bendis (writer), Frank Cho (artist), Tom Brevoort (editor)\n\nFirst Posted: 02/07/2002\n\nLast updated: 06/16/2022\n\nAny Additions/Corrections? please let me know.\n\nNon-Marvel Copyright info\n\nAll other characters mentioned or pictured are ™ and © 1941-2099 Marvel Characters, Inc.
