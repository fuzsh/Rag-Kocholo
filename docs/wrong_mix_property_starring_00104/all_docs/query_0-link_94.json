        "text": "No North American movie company is more closely linked to the Chinese film industry’s fortunes than Imax Corp. The Ontario-based giant-screen exhibitor has more than 700 Imax theaters in China — nearly half its global total of 1,500 — and the company has said it plans to add as many as 400 new theaters there over the next three years.\n\nSo when China’s movie industry roared back into growth mode last weekend during the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, Imax was among the big beneficiaries. The company had its strongest revenue weekend ever in China, pulling in $25 million in ticket sales over three days — a 45 percent gain over its prior record during Chinese New Year in 2019.\n\nSince then, Chinese tentpole Detective Chinatown 3 has climbed to more than $575 million in total revenue, followed closely by family comedy Hi, Mom with about $490 million. Overall, cinemas in China have brought in a record-smashing $1.2 billion (RMB7.8 billion) in just six days. With the pandemic under tight control in the country, the theatrical movie business has not just recovered in China — it has soared to new heights.\n\nSome analysts view China’s resurgence as a bullish indicator for the beleaguered theatrical business worldwide. Says Rance Pow, president of exhibition industry consultancy Artisan Gateway: “China’s theatrical sector rebound suggests the appeal of cinema is alive and well, and reason for optimism as the global industry is reignited with must-see blockbusters on tap in the coming months.”\n\nImax analyst Eric Wold of B. Riley Securities, meanwhile, reiterated his “buy” rating on the exhibitor’s stock, writing: “We see multiple positive takeaways from these results, including impressive pent-up moviegoing demand, the Imax format’s ability to gain share in a post-pandemic world and the benefit of holding films for the theatrical window vs. pivoting to a streaming platform.”\n\nShares of Imax have surged 10 percent on the New York Stock Exchange this week, hitting a 52-week high.\n\nWith many in Hollywood tracking China’s recovery and pondering what it might foretell for the U.S. movie business, The Hollywood Reporter connected with Imax’s longtime CEO Richard Gelfond to discuss how the company capitalizes on China’s unpredictable but hugely lucrative Lunar New Year holiday, the risks of Warner Bros.’ direct-to-streaming plans, whether Chinese moviegoers are becoming anti-American in their tastes, and why he’s “100 percent” confident U.S. moviegoers will be back at the multiplex in a big way soon.\n\nWhat were you expecting going into China’s Lunar New Year holiday, and what have been your observations and impressions as it’s unfolded?\n\nWe were expecting that this year’s holiday earnings would be approximately flat with the 2019 Chinese New Year — both for Imax and the whole industry. Our reasoning was that 2019 had been a record year. There wasn’t a Chinese New Year in 2020 at all because of the shutdown surrounding COVID-19. And now in 2021, there would be capacity limitations. In most of China, cinema seating capacity was limited to 75 percent, and in the Beijing region it was 50 percent.\n\nThen we also looked at the movies that were coming out. We were always quite optimistic about Detective Chinatown 3, but in 2019, there was the sci-fi movie The Wandering Earth, which was an-off-the-grid success for us. It was just very unexpected. So we thought that with the variety of movies, and all the circumstances, we would, as I said, come out about where we did in 2019.\n\nBut then we beat the 2019 opening weekend by 45 percent and looked at the full industry itself, which is now up by 33 percent! So I’ve been using the term “blown away” to describe our impression. We were really pleasantly caught off guard by how powerfully the holiday weekend opened.\n\nWhat lessons do you draw from China’s phenomenal theatrical market recovery for other territories that are going to be looking to stage their own comebacks as public health conditions improve — particularly North America? Can China tell us anything about how a recovery might unfold in the U.S.?\n\nI think China tells us 100 percent that when people feel comfortable going to the movies — when it’s safe and there are great movies available — they’re coming back. There’s no question in my mind. They’re coming back in big numbers, and they’re going to come back particularly to Imax, because when they can leave their home, they’re going to want to experience something that feels transporting and special.\n\nAnd by the way, we haven’t only seen this in China. We also saw it in Japan [when cinemas reopened there last year], with Demon Slayer becoming the number one movie in the history of Japan’s box office — and it was also the number one Japanese movie ever in Imax. We’ve seen it in Korea. We’ve seen it in Taiwan. There’s nothing unique to the Chinese people that suggests that their behavior is going to be different than anyone else.\n\nYou don’t give any credence to the theories that the pandemic has accelerated a fundamental and inevitable shift in how people consume screened entertainment?\n\nUnfortunately, some people who have benefited from the lockdown in the home have liked delivering a narrative that the world is changed forever. But I don’t think 100 years of culture, and 100 years of wanting to associate with other human beings and be with your family to experience a story in an exciting way, is changed by the ability to stream.\n\nIf you go back, there were much more serious threats to moviegoing than streaming. I mean, let’s start with the advent of television. As you probably know from studying history, when everyone in the world was getting a television in their living room for the very first time, people said, “Oh my God, that’s the end of the movie business.” But if television didn’t kill the movie business, certainly streaming is a much less significant threat.\n\nI’m going to paraphrase what someone else said, because I like it. “Everyone has a kitchen in their house, but we still go to restaurants.” The fact that they happen to have an ability to watch something in their living room doesn’t mean they’re going to stop going to movies. As a matter of fact, speaking personally, I can’t wait to get away. I mean, I really like a lot of streaming programs, nothing against them at all, but I can’t wait to get out of my house and get to a movie theater, especially an Imax theater, and see a great movie the way the directors wanted it to be seen.\n\nSorry, you can hear my passion in this, but I think there’s zero chance that this is the way audiences are going to prefer to see movies permanently. Now is not the time to be drawing conclusions. I mean, people are locked in their houses right now. They can’t go out. Of course they’re watching everything in their living room. They have zero choice.\n\nOnce they’re not locked in their houses, they’re going to have different choices. We’ve seen in every country where people have had that choice, they go back to the movies in huge numbers.\n\nThe situation is very fluid, but based on what you’re seeing now and what you’ve seen so far throughout the pandemic, when do you think North America is going to be in a position to begin to mount a recovery like China’s?\n\nThere are a couple of pieces to what China did that helped them get to this point. One is that they didn’t try and open it up in one day. For people seeing these big Chinese New Year numbers, maybe it appears like this happened suddenly, but that’s not how it unfolded. They prepared the market by running, for a little while, some older movies and some classic movies. Then they ran some smaller new movies, and they had certain capacity limitations. Then they eased the capacity limitations. So they kind of prepared the market and built confidence steadily. They took their time and did it in a systemic way.\n\nImax had an event about a month ago called CEO Forum where we invited CEOs of most of the major exhibitors in the world, who represent a significant majority of the global box office. We invited some of our colleagues from China to speak about how they reopened, and their message was very clear: You do it in a measured, systemic way rather than trying to do it all at once. That’s what I think we need to do.\n\nNow, with that said, as you know, in North America at least, a significant number of the screens are open, albeit with limitations on days of operation or capacity. So there is kind of a pre-reopening going on right now to some extent. We need to rebuild enthusiasm in a thoughtful, deliberate way.\n\nAnd what timeframe do you envisage?\n\nIn terms of a broader reopening, it obviously depends on the rate of vaccination and the progression of the pandemic. Internally, my own best guess would be in the May/June timeframe.\n\nI’d like to discuss a few more China-specific issues, because the Chinese New Year release window is so unique in various ways. One aspect is the volume of releases that open simultaneously, head to head, all in the same window. There were nine major movies released this year. That’s just amazing, and not something you would witness anywhere else in the world. Another issue is how unpredictable the outcome tends to be. There’s usually a strong frontrunner or two in the lead-up to release, but then once the movies hit the market, word of mouth takes over and there can be a pretty radical reshuffling. We’re seeing that to some extent this year with the way Hi, Mom has suddenly surged ahead of Detective Chinatown 3. How does that present challenges for a company like Imax, where you kind of have to pick your horse early? A lot of the regular Chinese exhibitors can shift their screen allocation between titles in real time, but you guys have to work ahead and select just a few titles to show in your format. How do you do it?\n\nThat’s a great question and one we’re dealing with in real time right now. Years ago, we only picked one film for Chinese New Year. So using your analogy, we had to bet it all on one horse. You may recall that Imax has a process, it’s called DMR, in which we take a movie and we convert it to an Imax movie. But it takes time and expense to do that, so generally, we have to pick which movie we’re going with well in advance.\n\nThree or four years ago, one movie broke out of Chinese New Year and it was the biggest film ever in China at that time and we had picked a different film. About a week into the New Year period, we spoke with the studio that had produced that movie and decided to convert it quickly; so in the back end of that period, we still did some pretty good business. But there’s no question that because of the difficulty of picking the big one we missed out on some box office.\n\nStarting with China’s National Day Holiday in October 2017, we decided that we had to go with a multi-film programming strategy, so that we could see how everything would play out as the period went on. That holiday we went with Never Say Die ($335 million) and The Foreigner ($81.2 million), two of the most highly anticipated films releasing over the two-week holiday. Since then, we have always selected two or three films for the big holidays.\n\nWhat we try to do is pick different movies from different genres, because you’re quite right about how people’s tastes change, but it seems to follow a pattern where they’ll shift from genre to genre in their preference. So we try to figure out what the most popular movies will be and then we vary the genres. That’s what we did in 2019. The Wandering Earth ($691 million) was not the original box-office leader, but it came on strong at the end. And fortunately, it was one of the three we had.\n\nAnd how did you approach this unique comeback year of 2021?\n\nThis year, we had been committed to Detective Chinatown 3 for a long time, because it was actually our 2020 pick, which got delayed because of the pandemic. And that particular movie was filmed with Imax cameras at Wanda Studios. So we had a lot invested in that movie, both from an aesthetic point of view, as well as from a psychological point of view, and we had very high expectations. So that became our cornerstone. Then we went with A Writer’s Odyssey and Nezha Reborn, the new animated version that came out, to kind of diversify genres.\n\nWe’re still analyzing the data right now. As you said, Detective Chinatown 3 came out of the gate really fast. We considered doing Hi, Mom as well. We knew that was going to be a big movie, but we weren’t sure that that particular genre would fit with the Imax experience, so that’s one reason we decided not to do it. But actually now we’re working on adjusting our programming a little bit to show more shows of A Writer’s Odyssey and less shows of Detective Chinatown 3 in order to try and anticipate where the public’s taste is going. There’s still time where if there’s a dark horse in the group that resonates, we still might be able to pivot to another movie.\n\nSo it’s something you really pay attention to. Since Chinese New Year is such a big part of the yearly box office, around 10 percent of the full total, you need to be very agile during this period. There’s almost as much art as science in trying to predict where consumer tastes are going to go.\n\nBecause of the pandemic and release delays, there was obviously a backlog of strong content ready to go for Chinese New Year. Looking ahead, how are you feeling about the rest of the year in China?\n\nI think we’re feeling very good about the rest of the year — but with the caveat that we still need Hollywood movies to be released to fill in the calendar. I know that we feel very good about the local-language films this year. And in fact, if you look at our performance in 2020, it was by far the best year we’d ever had for local-language films in China. I think it was a combination of the quality of the films going up, Imax playing more of them, and the public continuing to value local films.\n\nBut Hollywood films, or foreign films, have typically accounted for about 50 percent of the box office, so while we’re very enthusiastic about the local-language films and what their performance has been, you can’t predict the whole year’s results until you know the slate of Hollywood films coming out. And some of them, like Godzilla vs. Kong, which is coming out in March, we’re quite enthusiastic about. In fact, the final sequence of that film is shot in Hong Kong, so I think it will do very well in China.\n\nThere are other U.S. franchises scheduled, including the next title in the Fast & Furious franchise, Top Gun: Maverick with Tom Cruise, who typically plays well there; the Bond film No Time to Die, etc. It’s a slate that seems designed, in certain respects, for the Chinese market, but it’s hard to have absolute certainty as to when those will be dated because of how the pandemic is proceeding in other parts of the world.\n\nAs you mentioned, Hollywood content has been absent from the China market for an unprecedentedly long time. There are different views on how Hollywood product is regarded in China now. As you mentioned, there’s been a lot of audience enthusiasm for domestic Chinese-language filmmaking as they conquer new genres, and patriotically themed content has done particularly well. Meanwhile, even prior to the pandemic, Hollywood’s market share was slipping. Some people look at that and think it means the audience is turning away from Hollywood content — that they’re becoming much more interested in Chinese stories with uplifting Chinese themes than American-made movies. But then other people look at the long Hollywood absence and assume there has to be considerable pent-up demand for Hollywood franchise spectacle and visual effects on the big screen after all this time. Where do you fall on that?\n\nI definitely do not think it’s an either/or situation. If you look at box office in the United States, for example, you can love the Avengers franchise and you can also love the Mission Impossible franchise. It’s not a question of which one. I think it’s the same with Chinese-language movies versus Hollywood movies for most people in China. And the most recent experience with a Hollywood success in China was Avengers: Endgame, which was one of the largest successes in the history of China (it earned $629.1 million in China). And I know it seems like a long time because of the pandemic, but Avengers: Endgame was not ancient history. It was just a year and a half ago. I don’t think public tastes get wildly changed in a year and a half. If you told me it was 10 years or 20 years, there might be some truth to that, but people who lined up and paid premiums to see Avengers: Endgame aren’t disappearing for the Marvel releases this year.\n\nNow I’m sure one of the things that you could say, and it would make sense, is during the pandemic there hasn’t been a Hollywood full-on release in China, so we don’t know. And the U.S. releases that were there didn’t attract traditional numbers. But for me, there are two really good reasons for that. Number one is there hasn’t been a Hollywood film that’s been released globally like a normal Hollywood film. And particularly in China, when you look at films that break out and do very well, I think they play off the global premiere, the global red carpet events, the media, the paid marketing, all of which we put under the category buzz. There’s a lot of buzz that gets established that helps how things play out in China. We’ve yet to see a post-pandemic movie with that kind of buzz.\n\nAnd number two?\n\nThen the second thing is the piracy. Virtually every film that’s opened in China this year, whether it was the Disney film Mulan or Wonder Woman from Warner Brothers, they all came off of some kind of simultaneous online run, whether it was PVOD or a streaming run. The Imax office in China has said to me that there’s no question that massive piracy trampled down the box office of these movies.\n\nThis past weekend, Warner released Judas and the Black Messiah at midnight. People at Warners said that at 12:01 a.m. there were pirated versions available, and at something like 12:03 a.m. there were pirated versions with Spanish subtitles circulating in Latin America.\n\nRemember, these pirated copies aren’t ones where people went into a theater with an iPhone; they’re perfect digital copies, as good as the original. So in a place like China, where piracy is very common, you can’t overstate the impact of those kinds of releases. Frankly, I think once the pandemic subsides, the studios are going to go away from simultaneous streaming and Chinese releases because the piracy really plays a role in killing the Chinese box office.\n\nSo, again, going back into your question, I think once Hollywood returns to a normal distribution pattern with extensive marketing, red carpets, talk shows, social media and simultaneous theatrical releases in China — and a reassessment of how digital versions are released — the China box office for Hollywood will bounce back, especially for the popular franchises.\n\nGiven your points about piracy, I would assume you’re quite concerned about China earnings when you look at the 2021 Warner Brothers slate, which they will be releasing simultaneously over HBO Max — including Imax-friendly movies like Dune and Godzilla vs. Kong. Are you expecting they may do the China releases a couple of weeks ahead of the the rest of the world and HBO Max to mitigate piracy losses?\n\nI do think Warner has made rumblings, but no official announcement, that it’s going to release in China early. And I think if they did that, that would be a really good policy because I think even they recognize the impact of piracy.\n\nAnything you would like to add?\n\nThe only thing I would add is that people’s perceptions of the future are always wildly exaggerated by the present. I think when the pandemic started, nobody could imagine that it would last this long or change things this radically in such a short period of time. And I think the same thing is going to happen with reopening, which is what was demonstrated in China. Although it’s hard to see right now, once things turn, they’re going to turn very quickly, and I think the public is going to be surprised at how quickly people go back to the movies.\n\nInterview edited lightly for length and clarity.\n\nTrue Believer leads Marvel fans to places they might not expect.\n\nAbraham Riesman’s new biography of Stan Lee takes readers to Romania, the homeland of Lee’s ancestors, and to the small New York apartment of Lee’s brother, Larry Lieber, for an at times heartbreaking conversation. It offers new insights into the final years of Lee’s life, a tumultuous period that included accusations of elder abuse against the late legend’s daughter and others. And naturally, it explores Lee’s complicated relationship with collaborators such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko and goes deep on the creation of the Marvel Universe.\n\nEven before its publication this week, True Believer was sparking conversation, with some of Lee’s fans worrying it might paint a less-than-rosy picture of the late icon. Yet Riesman asks potential readers to dig in for themselves before making a judgment on the book.\n\n“This is not a book that is trying to tear anyone down,” Riesman tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It is a book that is trying to make us see more clearly an individual who was human like all the rest of us.”\n\nIndeed, True Believer paints a portrait of a man who was just as flawed as his heroes, and he emerges all the more human for it.\n\nWhile working as a reporter at Vulture, Riesman established himself as a must-read chronicler of the comic book industry with pieces on icons such as reclusive Spider-Man co-creator Ditko, an unvarnished look back at the groundbreaking Ultimate Marvel line of comics and a profile on Stan Lee. That widely read profile, published in 2016, ultimately led to an editor approaching Riesman after Lee’s 2018 death about potentially penning this biography.\n\nIn a conversation with THR, Riesman details the winding journey the biography took him on, and what he learned along the way.\n\nOne of the most striking things about this book is the time you spent with Stan’s younger brother, Larry Lieber, who worked for Stan and Marvel for years. How did that come about?\n\nI called him out of the blue. He picked up the phone and he started giving me interesting information just off the bat. We met up for lunch in the Upper East Side where he lived. And he talked for about three hours about his life. His life, not Stan’s life. I said, “Can I record this?” and he said, “Absolutely not,” because he’s planning to write a memoir. He told me this three-hour life story which is utterly fascinating and completely heartbreaking, and I was like, “You got to let me write this Larry.” I’ve asked him like five times, and he always refuses.\n\nSix weeks or so after Stan’s death, you make your way to Larry’s apartment for a proper interview, and the apartment is not what people might expect of Stan’s brother.\n\nI went to Larry’s apartment on the Upper East Side. It’s fascinating. Just the décor alone, it’s a shoebox. It’s a studio apartment that is really, really tiny. It’s not the life of a rich man, is what I’m trying to convey. A stark contrast to the lifestyle Stan led. Talking to Larry was one of the most thrilling journalistic experiences I’ve ever had. I will forever be indebted to him for the degree to which he was open and forthcoming with me, and the degree to which he felt comfortable telling me things he hadn’t told anyone before. The book would not be half the book it is if I had not been able to speak to Larry for this interview that ended up happening, where I went to his apartment and we talked for, I think, four hours. Then we had another interview, a follow interview, that was about an hour-and-a-half. So there’s a lot of tape logs of Larry. I hope I can get his permission, but some day I’d like to publish the full interview, because I feel like it’s a useful document for the history of comics.\n\nStan is not only a challenging character to unpack, but some of your sources are larger-than-life characters themselves who at times may tell tales that are hard to verify. How did you approach that?\n\nWithout commenting on anyone in particular, I would say this was a challenging book to write in so far as truth seemed to be bent by a lot of people I was speaking to. There were things that people said that you could just easily identify as being untrue. There were things that were so fantastical that you could hardly believe them and there was no way to actually prove that they happened or didn’t happen. It was a challenge and one that I took very seriously. The book is written in a way where I try to draw attention to the unreliability of everyone, not just particular people. The reader might think some of these folks are untrustworthy and others are trustworthy. Well, even the trustworthy people, quote unquote, may be misremembering something. Or talking about things that happened a long time ago.\n\nThe target demographic for this book will already know that Stan’s public persona was different than his private one. They will already know that there is debate over how much credit he deserves for his creations. Still, are you worried about pushback from readers who may not want to see Stan this way?\n\nPeople are very passionate about Stan, and I respect that. I understand that. I did not, in this book, set out to write a hatchet job, nor did I. I acknowledge a lot of things Stan did that were enormously successful and were a step forward for the industry, or society, or pop culture. That said, I also report on things that to the best of my knowledge are true, or at least I have evidence that other people have presented, that maybe will be difficult for some people to read or hear about. All I would ask is that people please try to pay attention to what I actually said rather than what they heard I said or what somebody characterized my words as being. And to understand that this is not a book that is trying to tear anyone down. It is a book that is trying to make us see more clearly an individual who was human like all the rest of us.\n\nIn a strange way, I came away liking Stan even more, because of that humanity.\n\nIf there is a moral to this book, it’s that there are no superheroes. We have this terrible tendency as humans, as Americans, as consumers, whatever, to take the things we like and the people we like, and … decide that they are more than human. We decide that the brand is something that is worth completely devoting your life to, or at least taking extremely seriously. The point is, fans are passionate, and I hope they understand that I tried my best.\n\nYou went deep on the last 20 years of Stan’s life — an era that to my knowledge has never been explored in this way before. Did you have a sense it would be such fertile ground?\n\nReporting the stuff that happened in the final 20 years of Stan’s life from 1998 to 2018, was stepping into uncharted territory. This really had not been written about at any length. You had the first Stan Lee biography by Tom Spurgeon and Jordan Raphael — The Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book, which was published in 2004 and therefore finished in 2003. It was a very good biography that was very critical, but very much incomplete when it comes to the full arc of Stan’s life. I decided, “Well, what if we focused on the stuff that no one ever wants to get into?” That was where I could feel myself getting into stuff that had not been discussed before, and that’s something that’s worth doing in and of itself, but also in terms of the content, you see a lot in those 20 years of not only seeing Stan’s character and seeing what he was like and the risks he was willing to take and what he was trying to achieve. You also get a sense of the kinds of relationships he had. You have the advent of home video, so you have a lot more evidence of what’s going on.\n\nAnd this is the era in which he became famous on a whole other level.\n\nIt’s the story of 20 years in which superhero movies go from Blade in 1998 up to in 2018, just a few months before Stan died, to Avengers: Infinity War. It’s this incredible journey and he was part of it. He’s a character, literally, or series of characters, in it. And it’s the story of how that brand acceleration happened and what Stan’s input was. That’s something that tells you a lot not just about him, but about the world he built, and therefore the world we all live in right now. Seeing how these movies learned from what Stan had come up with in the form of the interconnected Marvel Universe, that alone was something that in those last 20 years you see coming into major prominence. Even though Stan is not making those movies happen, to me what makes that situation interesting is he is watching from the outside, which is incredible to think about. Could you imagine somebody being basically barred from being a larger part of the franchise that at least they believe they created? And other people have credited him with creating? In any other industry that would be completely unacceptable. Then there’s the fact that a lot of interesting characters are in the final few years. It’s not that the years prior to that in Stan’s life were uninteresting – far from it – but that’s when a lot of the most colorful characters start to become prominent and well documented. I was hoping that people found it as interesting as I found it.\n\n***\n\nTrue Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee is available now from Crown Publishing, a division of Penguin Random House. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn Shatara Michelle Ford’s experimental thriller Test Pattern, light and dark are intertwined. The film is a staggeringly impressive debut, blending color, sound and story to create an intricate emotional tapestry.\n\nIt begins in the moment before a sexual assault occurs. We meet our main character as she is barely conscious, the glass of water in her hands tipping toward the floor. The screen glows red, letting us know that we are in for something ominous and violent. We see the perpetrator in the mirror as he gazes at his reflection before approaching his victim. This is the setup of a horror film: a defenseless woman, a man with dead eyes, a secluded location and no dialogue.\n\nBut then, right as he pulls her down to the bed, the scene cuts. Suddenly, we’re in a lively bar and our heroine is meeting her would-be boyfriend for the first time on the dance floor. The shift unsettles us, thrusting the story from a dire situation to a joyful one. This shift sets the tone for the rest of the film; Ford intends to keep us on our toes.\n\nTest Pattern tells the story of Renesha (Brittany S. Hall), a young Black woman living in Austin, Texas. She meets her white boyfriend Evan (Will Brill) at the aforementioned club and in the beginning, they have a quick, smooth romance. Evan is a tattoo artist and Renesha has a cushy corporate job that she hates. She lives in a fancy condo, dresses professionally and straightens her hair. Evan wears t-shirts, jeans and flip-flops. He’s entranced by her intelligence and beauty and she loves his playful, honest nature.\n\nThe scene where they have sex for the first time is sweet and tender. “I never want you to leave,” she tells him. His reply is simple: “I won’t.” And he doesn’t. Soon, Renesha leaves her corporate life behind and moves into a small blue house with Evan. He runs his tattoo parlor at home while she gets a new job at The Humane Society. Renesha starts wearing her hair natural, dressing differently and gets multiple tattoos. They adopt two dogs and a cat. It’s a picturesque relationship.\n\nBut then, Renesha goes out one night with her friend Amber (Gail Bean) and they run into a pair of pushy white men. Together, they ignore Renesha’s protests and pressure her into drinking more, staying out later and taking a weed gummy. By the end of the night, she can barely stand. As she tries to leave, one of the guys (Drew Fuller) intercepts her, driving her to the glowing red hotel room we see at the beginning of the film. Renesha is barely conscious when he rapes her, too tired to protest physically or verbally. Unlike many other filmmakers, Ford doesn’t linger on the specifics of the assault. She gives us just enough information to know that it happened without leering at Renesha’s body during the act. In the morning, the man drops her off in the middle of the street near her house. Once she goes home and tells Evan what happened, his reaction changes their relationship forever.\n\nEvery sexual assault survivor’s experience is different — there is no set way to respond to trauma. Some people want accountability from the abuser. Some people want to use their experience to raise awareness with initiatives like Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement. Sometimes, as we often see in cinema, the survivor wants only revenge. But Renesha wants none of those things. All she wants to do is go home, take a bath and go to bed.\n\nBut Evan, in a dark turn, doesn’t let her do that. What follows is a harrowing journey from hospital to hospital, in pursuit of a rape kit. This tense road trip reveals the flaws in both their relationship and the American healthcare system. The hospitals they go to aren’t equipped to administer the exam, prolonging Renesha’s sadness and anxiety. The longer they search for a hospital, the more things unravel, and Renesha begins to question what kind of man she’s been living with. In one unsettling flashback, she recalls a conversation where Evan talks about tattooing her as a form of branding. This causes us to look back and consider how much Renesha has changed — her hair, her job and especially her body. At the beginning of their relationship, she has one tattoo. In the present, she has many of them, all of which were designed and placed by Evan.\n\nTest Pattern’s quiet commentary on race is one of its biggest strengths. Ford wants us to think about white patriarchal control and the different ways that power dynamics can play out in interracial relationships. Throughout the film, Renesha keeps thinking back to her assault alongside memories of her time with Evan. She can’t help but draw parallels between her white boyfriend’s controlling behavior and the predatory white man who took control of her in a different, more violent way.\n\nLater, in a telling exchange, Renesha asks Evan why it’s so important to him that she get a rape kit. He replies with a question: “Don’t we need to find out what happened to you?” Her response is defiant: “I told you what happened to me.” Here, Ford reveals that this is not a journey for justice; this is the single-minded quest of a man who wants to re-establish control over his girlfriend’s body. Though she repeatedly asks him to take her home, he refuses to. He even reports the rape to the police without her consent. In the painful scene, she struggles to take the phone from his hands but fails. Evan keeps getting what he wants, making Renesha feel smaller in the process.\n\nHall and Brill are both superb in the film, creating a relationship onscreen that feels natural and realistically flawed. Brill has the difficult task of playing a man with shades of both kindness and menace, sometimes within the same scene. Evan’s need for power over Renesha flares up like an unrefined reflex too subtle for him to detect. And being a white man, he is able to assert that power and express his anger more freely than his Black partner.\n\nEven if Renesha wanted to behave like him — yelling in public and demanding to be heard — the fallout would be drastically different for her. Hall has the more challenging role, giving dimension and agency to a woman who has been pressured into passivity. She has an arresting screen presence, with expressive eyes that speak for Renesha when her mouth fails her. Both performances are more physical than verbal, bolstered by undeniable physical chemistry between the actors. The most telling moments are when the couple is sitting in silence, unable to articulate the temperature of their emotions.\n\nTest Pattern subverts our expectations by taking what would normally be a straightforward relationship drama and twisting it into something far more complex. The film is also one of the few sexual assault stories to center a Black woman, with her Blackness being central to her experience and the way she is treated by the people around her. It’s a romance, a sexual assault story and a thriller all in one, as tangled and blurred to us as it is in Renesha’s mind. The film moves backward and forward in time in a dark, foreboding dream space, mimicking the intrusive thoughts of a trauma survivor. This is not a movie about sexual assault as an abstract concept; it’s a movie about the reality of a sexual assault survivor’s experience. It’s a cinematic achievement.\n\nProduction companies: 120 E Films, IT WAS WRITTEN…\n\nDistribution: Kino Lorber\n\nCast: Brittany S.
