        "text": "Godzilla is a 1998 American monster film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. Produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Fried Films, and Independent Pictures, and distributed by TriStar Pictures, it is a reboot of Toho Co., Ltd.'s Godzilla franchise.[6] It is also the 23rd film in the franchise and the first Godzilla film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio.[a] The film stars Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner, and Harry Shearer. The film is dedicated to Tomoyuki Tanaka, the co-creator and producer of various Godzilla films, who died in April 1997. In the film, authorities investigate and battle a giant monster who migrates to New York City to nest its young.\n\ngodzilla 1998 download 720p 58\n\nDownload Zip › https://urluss.com/2zcAqC\n\nThe soundtrack featuring alternative rock music was released on May 19, 1998, by Epic Records.[47] It was a success on the music charts, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum on June 22, 1998. The original score was composed by David Arnold. The film's score was not released on CD until 9 years later, when it went on sale as a complete original film score in 2007 by La La Land Records. The album was supported by the single \"Come with Me\" performed by Sean Combs and Jimmy Page.\n\nOn November 3, 1998, the film was released on VHS and DVD in the United States. Special features for the DVD include; photo galleries, visual effects and special FX supervisor commentaries, the music video of \"Heroes\" by The Wallflowers, Behind the Scenes of Godzilla with Charles Caiman, theatrical trailers, a featurette, director/producer and cast biographies, a photo gallery, music video, and Godzilla Takes New York (before and after shots).[54] In 1999, Sony released a Widescreen edition VHS. The VHS earned $8.04 million from rentals during its first week in the United States, at the time making it the biggest video opening since Titanic.[55] The DVD sold over 400,000 units in the United States by the end of 1998.[56] It was also reported that NBC would pay around $25 million for the television broadcast rights in the United States.[11]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the film would need to gross $240 million domestically in order to be considered a success.[12] Godzilla was released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 1998, in a record 3,310 theaters.[4][62] Sony expected the film to gross $100 million during the film's opening weekend, which fell on Memorial Day weekend, expecting to set a new record for the holiday. Ultimately, it would only end up earning $12.5 million on opening day and grossing $44 million during its opening weekend.[10] The film grossed $55,726,951 over the four day holiday weekend, and $74.3 million in its first six days, falling below industry expectations.[4][12][63] Its six-day opening gross nevertheless came close to the $74.9 million Memorial Day weekend record previously set by Mission: Impossible in 1996, but fell below the $90 million record set by The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997.[63]\n\nInternationally, the film took in an additional $242.7 million in business, for a combined worldwide total of $379,014,294[4] (equivalent to $633 million adjusted for ticket inflation in 2013).[63] For 1998 as a whole, the film was the ninth highest-grossing film domestically[67] and the third highest-grossing film worldwide.[68] Despite performing below expectations domestically, Godzilla was a profitable worldwide success, grossing nearly three times its budget.[63] Sony stated that retail sales of consumer products generated $400 million; not only from the 1998 film but from the animated series and the Heisei Godzilla films that Sony acquired at the time.[69]\n\nKaneko pondered on the treatment the character was given by the studio, stating, \"It is interesting [that] the US version of Godzilla runs about trying to escape missiles... Americans seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms.\"[95] In 2004, Toho began trademarking future incarnations of TriStar's Godzilla as \"Zilla\" for future appearances. This decision was made by producer Shōgo Tomiyama and Godzilla: Final Wars director Ryuhei Kitamura because they felt Emmerich's film \"took the God out of Godzilla\" by portraying the character like a mere animal.[13] The name \"Zilla\" was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on counterfeit Godzilla products that use \"Zilla\" as a suffix.[96] The character has since appeared in other media as \"Zilla\".[97][98][99] Nicholas Raymond from Screen Rant described Toho's subsequent treatment of TriStar's Godzilla as \"a clear sign that Toho doesn't regard the 1998 Godzilla as the King of the Monsters. It would appear that to them, he's just a giant lizard.\"[93]\n\nTriStar planned to produce a Godzilla trilogy upon acquiring the Godzilla license in 1992. Emmerich had considered using the Monster Island concept from the Toho films with the intention of creating something wild, as well as including six or seven monsters, stating, \"We'll probably come up with other monsters because we don't want to tie ourselves too much to certain things\".[113] Prior to the 1998 film's release, Sony felt confident enough with the potential box office success that they paid Toho $5 million for sequel rights, which guaranteed them to produce a sequel within five years following the first film's release, so long as it was in active development.[12] Devlin had confirmed plans for a trilogy, stating, \"We have a Godzilla trilogy in mind. The second one is remarkably different from the first one, and if it's embraced, a third one would make a whole lot of sense. I don't see us doing more than three, but I would love to finish out telling the story.\"[114]\n\nEmmerich and Devlin commissioned a treatment by Tab Murphy titled Godzilla 2. The sequel would have involved the surviving offspring battling a giant insect in Sydney.[115] The studio abandoned sequel plans due to a lack of enthusiasm from fans, audiences, theater owners and licensees,[24] and Emmerich and Devlin left due to budget disputes. Devlin stated, \"They wanted to tailor it budget-wise, so it didn't make sense for us creatively.\"[116] Devlin stated that they left the film with an open-ending in case the success allowed them to return for sequels.[117] Despite Emmerich's comments that Sony was \"absolutely ready\" to produce a sequel, he later revealed that he advised the studio to not produce a sequel, stating, \"It's so strange because people expected it to be the biggest thing ever, then it only did well. They are disappointed, and you have to defend yourself\". Sony had considered a reboot with the new series disassociating itself from the 1998 film. However, TriStar let their remake/sequel rights expire on May 20, 2003.[12]\n\nAn animated series was produced as a sequel and aired on Fox Kids from 1998 to 2000. In the series, Dr. Tatopoulos accidentally discovers the egg that survived the aerial bombardment before it hatches, in a minor change from the ending in the 1998 film. The creature hatches after Nick Tatopoulos stumbles onto it and it assumes him to be its parent. Subsequently, Dr. Tatopoulos and his associates form a research team, investigating strange occurrences and defending mankind from dangerous mutations with the new Godzilla, which grew to full size in a few days, serving as humanity's protector from the new threats.[118]\n\nGODZILLA (GOD (ゴ)ZILLA (ジラ), Gojira) is a 1998 American giant monster film directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Dean Devlin with Emmerich based on a story by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Devlin, and Emmerich, with visual effects by Volker Engel. Funded by TriStar Pictures, Fried Films, and Independent Pictures and produced by Centropolis Entertainment, it is the first entirely Hollywood-produced Godzilla film as well as the 23rd Godzilla film overall. It stars Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, and Michael Lerner. The film was released to American theaters by TriStar on May 19, 1998, and to Japanese theaters by Toho on July 11, 1998.\n\nFollowing a lengthy development period which began in 1992, GODZILLA was released in 1998 to sizeable financial returns but a strongly negative response from critics and fans. TriStar had planned to produce a trilogy of Hollywood Godzilla films and began development on a sequel shortly after the first film's release alongside an animated series continuation. However, budgetary disputes led to the abandonment of the sequel and ultimately all plans for future Godzilla films from TriStar, with Toho bringing its own series out of retirement with Godzilla 2000: Millennium in 1999.\n\nCrushed cars were dotted around London as a part of a guerrilla advertising campaign. In the month or so before its release, ads on street corners made references to \"Godzilla\"'s size in comparison to whatever medium of advertising the advertisement was on. Examples: \"His foot is bigger than this bus,\" \"His head is bigger than this billboard,\" etc. Bits and pieces of different body parts of Godzilla were shown on TV commercials and posters, but never the entire body; this was to add a bit of mystery as to the design of the creature, ideally prompting people to see the film because that was the only way to see the whole creature. However, the toy line was released before the film and spoiled everything. Taco Bell had tie-ins such as cups and toys that promoted the film. The Taco Bell Chihuahua was also at the height of its popularity in Taco Bell's television commercials. During the summer of 1998, several commercials pairing Godzilla with the Taco Bell mascot were produced and aired, including one with the Chihuahua trying to catch Godzilla in a tiny box, whistling and calling, \"Here, lizard, lizard, lizard.\" When Godzilla appears, the Chihuahua says, \"Uh-oh. I think I need a bigger box.\"\n\nb9b4d2437c"
