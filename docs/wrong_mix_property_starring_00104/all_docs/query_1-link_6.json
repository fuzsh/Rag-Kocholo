My experience at University of Texas Press has been a pleasure from start to finish. Jim and former Assistant Editor Sarah McGavick, as well as Editing, Design & Production Manager Robert Kimzey and copy editor Jon Howard were highly professional, efficient, and responsive. I am also grateful for the efforts and professionalism of the two peer reviewers, whose detailed, constructive, and highly insightful comments helped me tremendously in the revising stage. I must also express my deep appreciation for the efforts of my research assistant Megan McSwain, who was invaluable in preparing the manuscript, and Susmita Das, for her vital work in the last stages of completion. The first kernels of the idea for this book came in an article published (in shorter and substantially different form) in Film History as “The ILM Version: Recent Digital Effects and the Aesthetics of 1970s Cinematography” (24:2, 2012), and I would like to thank John Belton for including me in that issue. This book has gone through a number of permutations before finding its final form. A great thanks to friends and colleagues who have read or commented on portions of this book in various iterations over the years. Most particular thanks to those who read an early version of the manuscript and provided advice in a deeply productive book conference: Lilya Kaganovsky, Derek Long, Jenny Oyallon-­Koloski, Dana Polan, Ariel Rogers, Robert Rushing, and Kristen Whissel; and thank you to Susan Koshy at the Unit for Criticism and Interpretation for organizing. My gratitude also goes to those who read earlier drafts and offered useful critique, including Paul Young and Bob Rehak. Invited talks and conferences provided important feedback. Thanks to Aaron Hunter and Martha Schearer, who invited me to the Women and New Hollywood Conference, Maynooth University, Ireland; Matthew Solomon, who asked me to speak at the\n\nvii\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Charles Acland at Concordia, and Eric Faden at Bucknell. Thanks as well to academic friends who offered support and encouragement and with whom I have talked through ideas: Emily Carman, Allyson Field, Doron Galili, Josh Gleich, Adam Hart, Matt Hauske, Maggie Hennefeld, Laura Horak, Gunnar Iverson, Andrew Johnston, Patrick Keating, Sarah Keller, Seth Kim, Alicia Kozma, Katharina Loew, Paul McEwan, Ross Melnick, Dan Morgan, Christina Petersen, Jennifer Peterson, Scott Richmond, Theresa Scandiffio, Ria Thanouli, Neil Verma, Allison Whitney, Mark Williams, and Josh Yumibe; and a special thanks to Anne Nesbit and Joel Westerdale, who suggested aspects of the title over spritzes at Pordenone. And finally, thanks to my effects subfield colleagues not already mentioned who have proven to be an especially collegial and generous bunch: Tanine Alison, Lisa Bode, Hye Jean Chung, Leon Gurevitch, Kartik Nair, Dan North, Lisa Purse, and Anu Thapa. I have received a great deal of institutional and collegial support from the University of Illinois at Urbana-­Champaign. First of all, I’d like to thank colleagues not already mentioned in the Department of Media and Cinema Studies, most especially Angela Aguayo, Anita Chan, Amanda Ciafone, and CL Cole. The completion of this book would have been significantly delayed without the support of the UIUC Center for Advanced Studies that made a necessary full-­year sabbatical possible. The campus Research Board funded vital research trips to archives, as did a fellowship from the Unit for Criticism and Interpretation. I am also proud to have been selected to be a College of Media Scholar. Outside of the University of Illinois, the Harry Ransom Center Thomas G. Smith Research Fellowship in the Humanities yielded a gold mine of important research documents. This book would truly not have been possible without the existence of research institutions and their dedicated staff, most especially the Margaret Herrick Library, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Media History Digital Library. Special thanks to the time, energy, and research leads given by my interview subjects: David Bossert, Michael Eisner, Jean Pierre Flayeux, Peter Kuran, Simon Marinof, and Jeff Okun. My parents, Ann and Jack Turnock, and my sisters, Jennifer Harding and Amy McMahon, and their families have always been supportive of my academic career and always help me to keep my work in perspective.\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAnd as always, I am most indebted to my husband, Jonathan Knipp, whose insights on and enthusiasm for all kinds of cinema from blockbusters to indie horror to international art cinema continue to animate my thinking and spark my imagination. Here’s to more decades ahead in front of the IMAX screen. I only wish we could bring Aldo.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nix\n\nIntroduction The ILM Version\n\nWITH 450 PEOPLE AND 180 HIGH-­POWERED WORKSTATIONS—MORE THAN ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION EXCEPT NASA—[GEORGE LUCAS’S] ILM IS BY FAR THE WORLD’S LARGEST EFFECTS HOUSE, DWARFING RIVALS. . . .

Because Disney’s market share accounted for nearly 40 percent of the North American box office (as of 2019 before disruptions caused by COVID-­19), its decisions—more than any other single studio—control much of the industry as a whole, including how movies look.1 Movies used to be live-­action by definition, and alternatives such as animation were considered exceptions. Since about 2002, when the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences introduced a Best Animated Feature category, the industry and its awards categories now define live-­action by whether it looks like it was captured profilm­ ically, meaning it happened physically in front of the camera.2 However, with categories seeming to merge in the wake of digital technologies, the industry finds the term “photoreal” useful in creating a distinction between live-­action and animation. As the Los Angeles Times reported: In marketing the film, Disney has carefully avoided defining “The Lion King” as either animated or live-­action, instead describing it as “photoreal.” For the purposes of the Academy Awards, however, the studio is expected to position the film as live-­action rather than animated.3\n\nLargely because animation (however sophisticated) is associated with children’s fare, live-­action is seen to appeal to a wider audience than animation and, perhaps, garner more prestigious awards. For this reason, most productions cling fast to the live-­action designation, no matter how intensive the computer-­generated imagery (CGI) is in the final film. As the (nearly) entirely CGI Lion King remake demonstrates, the term “live-­ action” is in fact a convenient industrial fiction, and it is a professionally agreed-­upon notion of a photoreal aesthetic that makes the discursive fiction possible.4 As a consequence of this industry self-­imagining, the aesthetic of photoreal digitally generated imagery governs nearly all contemporary filmmaking. It is the goal of this book to demonstrate how this nearly universal view of cinematic photorealism has developed. This aesthetic of cinematic photorealism is realized materially by the effects industry (in the industry, “effects” is often rendered as “FX” or “F/X”). Most theatrically released movies today, whether big budget\n\n2\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nor low, whether directed by Steven Spielberg, Kathryn Bigelow, Pedro Almodóvar, Zhang Yimou, or Greta Gerwig, employ sizable effects teams. Effects jobs are assigned to companies on a per-­shot basis, and the average feature-­length film comprises a total of about 3,000 shots. The most expensive blockbusters spend tens of millions of dollars contracting twenty-­plus independent effects companies from around the globe to complete about 2,500 effects shots. Films with no visible effects can nevertheless expect 400–1,000 shots to include effects work.5 Effects artists digitally create everything from vast levitating cities in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) for live actors to inhabit; to photorealistic, emoting animals in The Jungle Book (2016); to safely speeding cars for all the Fast and Furious movies. And beyond the highest-­budgeted films, effects artists also re-­create whole blocks of 1970s Mexico City in Roma (2018), add cheering crowds to Wembley Stadium in Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), and invisibly erase marks of contemporary Sunset Boulevard from Once Upon a Time. . . In Hollywood (2019). While touched by the hands of thousands of artists, all of this work is nevertheless expected to result in a commonly held notion of effects photorealism. The surprisingly consistent international style of effects realism that these companies adhere to—one that impacts the aesthetics of global art cinema and low-­ budget indies as much as superhero extravaganzas—is not a result of happenstance or coincidence. I contend that the industry-­leading effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM, originally formed by George Lucas in 1975 as Industrial Light and Magic) has rendered environments such as Mufasa’s kingdom, the Death Star in Star Wars, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry believable, no matter which effects company did the actual work. In fact, I did not expect to write a book focusing on ILM. Initially, I planned to track the development of digital effects aesthetics and the effects industry worldwide over the course of the 1990s to the 2010s. Given ILM’s longevity and association with so many blockbuster franchises, I assumed the company would take a privileged position among the many effects houses I was researching. The perception of ILM’s greatness, untouchability, and innovation, as suggested in the opening epigraphs attesting to ILM’s artistry, influence, technological supremacy, and economic dominance, all appear undisputed—not only in ILM’s own public relations rhetoric but also in that of its rivals, industry reporting, and even the moviegoing public at large. If a casual moviegoer can recognize the name of just one effects company, it is Industrial Introduction\n\n3\n\nLight & Magic. Although (as discussed in chapter 1) every report on the effects industry names ILM as the industry leader, there is not much hard financial data to back that up, especially given the famously unstable nature of the effects business. Lucasfilm, as a privately owned company throughout most of its history, was not required to release financial details.6 Whether or not we can determine ILM’s actual economic market dominance, my research has determined that ILM has traded in its perceived dominance to compel other companies to follow its lead. Likewise, academic histories of digital cinema are largely histories of ILM projects, from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to Jurassic Park (1993) to the Harry Potter franchise to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to the latter-­day Star Wars prequels, sequels, and spinoffs. The more I researched, the more a few things became clear. First, as the title of chapter 1 suggests, since ILM opened its doors to outside contracts in 1980, the global effects industry has been ILM “versus everybody else.” Despite its self-­promotion of this theme, ILM has not been a rebel upstart since its earliest days but has indeed earned its title as the “empire of effects.” Second, over decades, other prominent companies including Apogee, Boss, Digital Domain (DD), and Weta rose to compete with ILM but could not eclipse it, leading to ILM’s outsize influence over all aspects of the effects industry, including business practices, aesthetics, and technology. Third, an aesthetic history of cinematic effects since 1975 is an aesthetic history of ILM. Last, to my own surprise and most unexpectedly, I found that an aesthetic history of ILM was a history of cinematic realism since the 1980s—and not just in effects-­heavy mainstream cinema. What does it mean to place an effects company at the center of inquiry rather than as a postproduction afterthought? What are the industrial implications of being an empire of effects? Industrial histories of cinema have generally aimed for a macro focus (the studio system, media conglomeration) or micro focus (specific players’ or entities’ intersections within these larger forces). Cinema’s so-­called below-­the-­ line facilities (that is, postproduction and support industries—beyond sound) have rarely received more than a passing reference in the macro-­ view academic studies, and effects even less so.7 This book aims to be a study that finds a middle ground between macro and micro: to widen the scope of significant actors in the industry while contending that entities appearing to be on the margins are in fact exerting pressure on\n\n4\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nthe center. I also assert that media conglomerates control the media discourse about which actors are considered important or impactful to the broader industry. Industry-­wise, effects work is simultaneously essential to contemporary filmmaking and peripheral to it. It is to the industry’s broader advantage to keep below-­the-­line entities weak and dependent and to characterize them as outliers. That being said, as I will contend in chapter 3, the media have certainly been effective in furthering ILM’s own claims of dominance in the effects sector—but only within its specified realm. To put it another way, being the empire of effects is like installing all the public restrooms and plumbing in a skyscraper: the structure cannot do without such facilities, but the developer does not highlight them in the brochure. The study of special/visual effects (“VFX” is a common acronym referring to “visual effects”) as the intersection of aesthetics and industrial practice not only encourages but also requires a multifaceted methodology.8 It is a skilled art of aesthetic assumptions about professional standards crossed with expectations about imagery that is both realistic and spectacular. This mandates close formal analysis of sequences from illustrative films. Effects are produced through many ever-­evolving interlocking imaging technologies, each with its own configurations and lineages. Within overall film production, the postproduction field is part of what is considered to be global film’s postproduction industry, in which it occupies an important and yet marginal position. This activates a “production studies” approach emphasizing economic and industrial factors. The longtime fascination with effects work as illusion is also the center of a series of popular, professional, and academic discourses that explain and characterize this arcane world to interested moviegoers. These communications, from the industry leaders and practitioners as well as entertainment and professional publications, also necessitate careful parsing as well as fact-­checking. Above all, these facets have shifting histories to be described. In this way, effects studies’ complex web of aesthetic, technological, economic, and discursive analysis helps provide a model to describe moving images as art and technique—and also practice and discourse. I chose to focus on Industrial Light & Magic for several strategic and practical reasons (to be described below), and this book will discuss these facets within the specific example of ILM more or less in turn, chapter by chapter, organized by a loose historical through-­line. While this approach works especially well for describing\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ncinematic effects of various eras, it could also be useful for other highly technological arts of moving images, including animation, cinematography, editing, and sound, among others. Commonsense notions of realism as well as previous scholarship have promoted the aesthetic of realism on display in these effects-­heavy films as “perceptual realism,” roughly corresponding with a style that mimics “what the eye sees in real life.” Unexpectedly, my research found that it was not a reference to human biology that our commonly held notion of effects realism is derived. Instead, it was ILM in the late 1970s that promoted its in-­house style so effectively through its nearly half-­ century of industrial, cultural, and technological dominance that most moviegoers and even most scholars do not even recognize it as a style. The current ILM digital aesthetic is far from “naturally” derived; instead it consists of an idiosyncratic series of codes based on 1970s cinematography cuing materiality, immediacy, and authenticity. When The Walt Disney Company bought ILM in its acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012, ILM’s primary value came not in its decades of effects production, or even its impressive (and expensive) R&D, but the associative value that ILM’s style of realism had accrued. Consequently, “owning” a style of realism that appears nearly invisible means that entertainment conglomerates yield a culturally powerful rhetorical sway over what viewers accept not only as plausibly real but also as credibly true. Scholars such as Stanley Cavell, David Rodowick, and Laura Mulvey have historically understood cinematic realism primarily in relation to Bazinian philosophical ontology; put another way: What is the relationship of the cinematic image to lived human perception and experience?9 Instead, I recognize realism as stylized components of an industrial aesthetic with historical contours. This move allows us not only to observe realism as a stylization of camera reality but also to denaturalize it, draining it of much of its power to go by unobserved. Moreover, it helps us reframe debates about cinematic realism to ones that take into account the material conditions of contemporary digital filmmaking that acknowledge its multiplicity (many digitals rather than a singular “digital”) and without resorting to either utopian or dystopian rhetoric. Rather than take ILM’s industry standard as a given or its realist aesthetic as inevitable, this book delineates the ILM aesthetic’s historically identifiable roots, traceable to complex economic and industrial factors. The Empire of Effects tracks ILM from its work on the original Star Wars trilogy to its absorption into the Disney empire in 2012, with an empha-\n\n6\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nsis on the digital era of the 1990s to the 2010s. My historical research and visual analysis demonstrate that digital effects’ style of realism is far from impoverished, obvious, or juvenile, as Richard Maltby, David Cook, and Justin Wyatt have stated or implied.10 Neither, as Stephen Prince and Lev Manovich have claimed, is it a natural or inevitable reflection of human vision or technological progress.11 Far from simple mimicry of the natural world or camera reality, effects realism is a complex, historically specific style that has emerged largely from strategies ILM has deployed to maintain dominance in the effects industry. The ILM style over the years is associated most strongly with signature franchises such as the Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, and Transformers films, among others. While the ILM style has been flexible enough to also accommodate the striking but more eccentric effects for films such as Willow (1988), Death Becomes Her (1992), Forrest Gump (1994), Casper (1995), The Great Wall (2016), and Warcraft (2016), it is most strongly associated with the style that derived from 1970s photorealism. The various ideological implications of this style will be treated with more detail in later chapters. ILM’s CG effect aesthetic is based in the 1970s cinematographically inflected style associated with the New Hollywood auteurist movement. It highlights techniques that draw attention to the act of filming by impersonating the presence of a human-­operated camera. The style features unstabilized camera movement, haphazard framing, and abrupt changes of focus. Equally significant, the ILM aesthetic emphasizes the stylistic markers of that mode of filmmaking through the lighting aesthetic, with strong reliance on lens artifacts such as flares, intense backlighting, and highlighting of atmospherics such as dust and rain. Finally, these techniques are self-­consciously edited into spontaneous-­looking sequences that show off and conceal the effects object to best advantage. These techniques—mimicking tropes of 1970s cinematographic self-­reflexivity—paradoxically establish a discourse of visual integrity that allows the ILM aesthetic to be read as more truthful and more real than more animated-­looking digital styles.12 At the same time, through editing strategies controlling what we see or think we are seeing, the aesthetic has the added benefit (common to traditional studio-­era effects) of preventing the eye from scrutinizing the effects object or environment too carefully. Further, ILM’s association with the biggest film franchises of all time means its aesthetic has garnered the most public attention, and LucasIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfilm’s and ILM’s own public relations (PR) have taken advantage of that fact. Of course, it is expected that good PR bends facts to its company’s benefit. However, because the sheer amount of rhetoric about ILM is so pervasive, my research has determined that ILM’s often PR-­driven and misleading discourse consistently erases the innovations and contributions of equally innovative individuals and companies working on less prominent films. ILM’s PR campaign has successfully defined its version of effects realism as realism, more broadly bleeding into the aesthetics of non-­blockbuster global cinema, television, advertising, and other media.\n\nPrevious Scholarship Historically, we are several decades into the digital transition within the entertainment industries, and it is no longer sufficient to speak of “the digital” as if it is monolithic, interoperable, or untouched by historical change, as many canonical early treatments of cinematic digital technologies have, including those by Manovich, Rodowick, and Henry Jenkins. Rather than speak in ahistorical generalities about digital technology, The Empire of Effects uses primary-­source research to make broader theoretical arguments about the specific technologies and industries that surround the ILM aesthetic. The subfield of “effects studies” within cinema and media studies has been underrepresented in the academic scholarship. Similarly, software studies, media industry studies, and even studio histories have largely ignored effects work, despite its prominence in the most expensive and high-­profile output of the moving image entertainment industry. Academic publishing on effects has largely been concerned with the thematic reading of digital effects technology as a topos. Previous scholars in the 1990s and early 2000s such as Warren Buckland, Michele Pierson, and Geoff King theorized how spectacular effects sequences disrupt narrative with “non-­narrative” spectacle.13 Their scholarship was answered by a wave of important monographs by Kristen Whissel, Dan North, Lisa Bode, Lisa Purse, Aylish Wood, and Bob Rehak that argue for a need to recognize that effects sequences generate a discourse that can be read as directly related to the narrative thematics, subjected to allegorical readings or broader cultural discourses and anxieties.14 Certainly, this book takes part in identifying and analyzing effects as discourse. However, similar to my 2015 book, Plastic Reality: Special Effects, Technology, and the Emergence of 1970s Blockbuster Aesthetics, this book also examines\n\n8\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nthe extranarrative discourses created by the specific technologies and the structures of the industry that support them. In sum, the 2015 book argued that the contemporary aesthetic for digital effects is derived from a 1970s aesthetic. The Empire of Effects moves the argument of Plastic Reality into the blockbuster aesthetics of the digital era in order to explore this point thoroughly. There are excellent studies that fall primarily into “industrial studies” or “aesthetic studies,” but little scholarly work is concerned with giving equal weight to both. David Bordwell, Kristen Thompson, and Janet Staiger’s canonical The Classical Hollywood Cinema (1985) (as well as their individual works) tends to subsume both the industrial and aesthetic factors beneath the overarching goal to narrativize. Richard Maltby, Justin Wyatt, and J. D. Connor discuss Hollywood cinema through an industrial aesthetic, but like The Classical Hollywood Cinema, it is industrial factors that tend to explain the resultant aesthetic.15 Other excellent industrial studies have some issues in common with The Empire of Effects, but they have different concerns. Charles Acland’s American Blockbusters (2020) researches the origins of the term “blockbuster” and the role of what he calls the “technological tentpole” in organizing contemporary production, as well as the role of digital workers in bringing the bigness to these films.16 J. P. Telotte’s Mouse Machine (2008) concentrates on the historical role of technology in the Disney conglomerate.17 In my study, aesthetics and industrial factors play coequal roles. Scholars of race in science fiction such as LeiLani Nishime, Adilifu Nama, and Tanine Allison; queer Afrofuturism such as Kara Keeling; and trans* studies such as Eliza Steinbock and Cáel Keegan have brilliantly discussed effects allegorically to question the limit and value of realism to depict the field of alterity.18 In another vein, scholars of simulation and the posthuman (e.g., Lev Manovich, Sean Cubitt, Steven Shaviro, Judith Halberstam, and Shane Denson) have approached effects in terms of cinema’s non-­(and even anti-­) humanistic cyborg eye.19 While the overall project of these studies varies, I argue that characterization of digital effects as artifacts of the posthuman inadvertently devalues the labor context of the hundreds upon thousands of human workers who are the actual producers of these supposedly posthuman effects; such a characterization likewise overstates the role of the computer hardware and software in determining its aesthetic. The subfield of effects studies has recently seen brilliant work that brings effects into broader contexts. Ariel Rogers is concerned with Introduction\n\n9\n\nexamining how screen technologies display their technological innovation; Hye Jean Chung’s book approaches the global effects industry via Foucauldian case studies of specific films; and Bob Rehak is concerned with the relation of art design and effects, primarily within the Star Wars and Star Trek universes in a science fiction context. Essays by Leon Gurevitch and by Michael Curtin and John Vanderhoef address the industry context of global effects labor. The specific qualities of imaging software Autodesk Maya are the subject of Aylish Wood’s valuable study.20 Again, The Empire of Effects provides a model for how to speak to the development of the aesthetics of digital technology as it pertains to developments in the entertainment industry by particular actors. In that way, it explores the industrial role ILM has had in forming a culturally powerful aesthetic of realism. It is a model that incorporates production history and technical specificity as well as an analysis of historical aesthetics. When taking digital effects and their aesthetic as the primary subject matter, most scholarly treatments view the effects industry aesthetic as both natural and monolithic. Most influentially, Stephen Prince has coined the phrase “perceptual realism” in relation to effects aesthetics as a style of realism that takes physical reality as its aesthetic model.21 Moreover, Lev Manovich has identified a dominant visual style to simulated digital images that is consistent with millennia-­long approaches to mimesis following Renaissance image-­making.22 In both cases, instead of parsing special/visual effects’ constructed, historically based, and stylized aesthetic, Prince and Manovich accept the contemporary style of effects realism as natural, inevitable, or ahistorical, as it imitates “what the eye sees in real life” (or through a camera lens) or is congruent with humans’ urge toward mimesis.23 This naturalized approach to effects realism is the unstated reason that all outputs of special/visual effects as an industry are considered to be more or less the same. It provides a convenient and reductive reason why a varied and globalized industry would produce such consistent work, rather than asking how it materially came to be. Contrarily, I contend that, rather than a logical extension of either digital technology or human perception, there is nothing natural or inevitable about the digital realist aesthetic dominant across Hollywood blockbusters and others around the world designed for international distribution. Put simply, over its lifetime ILM has developed an international style and standard of effects realism, then ensures that other com-\n\n10\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\npanies and other filmmaking cultures must adopt it as well; we as viewers become habituated so that anything other than the expected ILM aesthetic seems “fake” or “bad.” Questions about the aesthetics of cinematic realism, especially in relation to digital technologies, are central to this book. As in my previous book, this study approaches visual aesthetics as inseparable from industrial production and historical scrutiny. In Plastic Reality, I addressed the history of the pivotal 1970s and 1980s in special effects production, asserting that the intensification of special effects practice in the late 1970s initiated a technological, aesthetic, and narrative upheaval in filmmaking that was as significant as the introduction of sound in the late 1920s, a claim that proposed an alternative periodization for cinema history beyond the classical/postclassical divide. Moreover, I argued then as now that aesthetics should be seen as a driver of change in cinema history, rather than simply its result. In Plastic Reality, I shifted the discussion of cinematic realism away from its traditional discussions based on (typically Bazinian) philosophies of cinema’s ontology to one instead based on material historical aesthetics. In other words, there is no transhistorical ultimate realism that effects aesthetics or cinema more broadly are evolving toward. Instead, different industrial and cultural historical contexts mold standards of realism at a given time. As discussed briefly in Plastic Reality, the ILM style of photorealism forms the aesthetic for 2020s digital blockbusters. For this reason, my characterization of 1970s photorealism as a style built by artists at a specific historical moment becomes particularly relevant here, especially as ILM disseminates its house style as a kind of open-­source software throughout the effects industry and then eventually becomes a unit of value to its Disney corporate owners. The crucial aspect that carries over to this book is the description of what I call “optical animation”—the “plastic reality” of the previous book—a specific style of photorealism developed at ILM in the 1970s to realize George Lucas’s goal that the original Star Wars (1977) movie, in his words, “be credible and totally fantastic at the same time.”24 His effects team created a composite mise-­ en-­scène that combined the New Hollywood cinematographic aesthetic with the flexibility of animation (often drawing from experimental animation) to create a historically determined style of photorealism that aligned with 1970s cinematographic styles. At ILM, this style of photorealism later became a reference style in the transition to digital technology, most especially under the effects supervision of longtime ILM Introduction\n\n11\n\nartist and supervisor Dennis Muren, and then became visual reference for ILM’s mature digital technologies. Also as discussed in Plastic Reality, most effects artists ascribe to an Arnheimian concept of realism, encapsulated as “if x existed in the world and then was photographed, how would that look?” Effects elements are generally designed to match or complement live-­action footage—the key difference from traditional animation—with the “real world” as only a base starting point. In my previous book, rather than consider “photo+realism” overly literally as an aesthetic simulating camera reality (that is, what an actual camera is able to capture), I considered the term “photorealism” much as it was initially conceptualized in art history. Art historical photorealism describes 2D artwork executed to mimic a photographic aesthetic. It is a loose movement that typically describes mid-­twentieth-­century painters and graphic artists such as Richard Estes, Chuck Close, and Ralph Goings, who created artworks with purposefully banal and quotidian subject matter, such as a diner still life with a napkin holder and ketchup bottle, presented with irregular framing recalling the look of unprofessional snapshot photography. These artworks used the perceptual cues of photography to create a tromp-­l’oeil effect of camera reality to comment on medium specificity and artistic significance. In other words, a print made to look like a photograph nevertheless retains aesthetic traces of its print-­based medium. It does not “become” a photograph because it looks like one. By contrast, cinematic photorealism in most cases works to suppress the recognition of the medium instability and erase the technique rather than comment on it. Moreover, cinematic photorealism as it pertains to effects photorealism is not a relation with a stable and consistent identity. In effects photorealism, rather than replicating what the eye or camera lens “really” sees, cinematic photorealism likewise builds, often from scratch, a stylized conception of how the camera lens, film stock, light patterns, movement, and so on have translated images into cinema, often taking significant liberties with camera reality to do so. Understanding photorealism in a way similar to the art historical precedent helps maintain a sensitivity to medium specificity while also understanding how the style can travel across media—and from optical technologies to digital ones—without changing its look very significantly. I agree with Lev Manovich that there has been a long enculturation to make viewers accept the image of photography and film as reality.25 Moreover, following Manovich’s influential claim, perhaps the 2019\n\n12\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nremake of The Lion King is just a recent assertion that the ontology of cinema more and more hews to animation rather than the profilmic. However, in the mature digital era when the technological line between effects work and animation has become so thin, it is exactly through this specific aesthetic of photorealism that the industry creates the (illusory) distinction between them. This is also the logic by which the producers of The Lion King can claim, and want to claim, that their movie is a live-­action remake of an animated film rather than another kind of animation. Previously, optical animation of the 1970s and 1980s gave live-­action the potential to be nearly as flexible as animation while still retaining the look of cinematography. However, in the digital era, to maintain the designation of live-­action, the result cannot be too evidently animated. As we shall see, directors such as Jon Favreau and effects artists such as Dennis Muren and many others frequently use the term “photorealism” to describe effects aesthetics to differentiate it both from “digital-­looking” CGI effects and mainstream animation aesthetics. Previously as well, the model for effects aesthetics was a fairly straightforward goal to match the look of contemporary cinematography. With digital technology, the model is still called “photorealism,” but what that is referring to is much more difficult to characterize. It is in part because the rhetoric used to discuss effects photorealism tends to use it interchangeably with related terms such as “credibility,” “authenticity,” “naturalism,” “convincingness,” and “seamlessness.” All these correspond to specific (though overlapping) aesthetic techniques. Describing in detail the aesthetic potential and limitations of the strategies that artists used to achieve a photoreal effect helps delineate the aesthetic ramifications of each human/technological assemblage of artist and machine.\n\nThe ILM Digital Aesthetic The consistent ILM realist aesthetic is organized around the production of the illusion that we are seeing “footage” of a profilmic event shot by a camera operated by a human cinematographer. However, the contours of that production have changed significantly since the 1970s. Even though digital technology certainly allows for greater plasticity, mutability, density, and dynamism within the individual frame and the composite mise-­en-­scène, the goal remains the same: appearing as if no postproduction technology was used at all. What ILM artists are resisting is what they frequently call the “digiIntroduction\n\n13\n\nFig. 0.01 The Revenant (2015): The ILM-­produced CGI bear demonstrates the company’s house style through backlighting, long-­take staging, and the misty atmospherics of a heavy tree cover.\n\ntal curse,” or an aesthetic that recalls animation over photography. Lev Manovich characterized 1990s CGI as “computer vision,” or the cyborg eye: a futuristic, smoothly executed hyperrealism, more perfect than human vision.26 I would add to that characterization of computer vision one that is algorithmically regular and smooth, as well as unmoored by gravity and abstractly “cute” in its undetailed form. Perhaps contradictorily, in the mature digital era ILM artists seek to create an optical look that cues human camera vision but by actually using computer vision: an optical cyborg eye. In other words, they want a computer-­ made version of the long-­standing, influential, and powerful version of the aesthetic ILM developed in the 1980s. While chapter 2 will provide more context and detail, taking a closer look now at a specific example provides an illustrative point of reference for ILM’s influential version of digital photorealism based on ILM’s 1970s cinematographic aesthetic. ILM’s work on the bear attack in The Revenant (2015), a much-­discussed sequence in a film nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects, demonstrates ILM’s notion of photorealism as credibly spectacular—and even better in that it appears in a movie not publicized as especially effects-­heavy.27 The Revenant (figure 0.01) is also an appropriate example of the way the movie’s themes on the rugged masculinist colonialist project chime with ILM’s unreflective embrace of the bias inherent in clinging to the 1970s New Hollywood style, which is still largely associated with white masculinist auteurist values. The sequence meets nearly all the expectations associated with the\n\n14\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nseamlessness of effects photorealism—in an almost literal way. About thirty-­six minutes into the film and about five and a half minutes long, the lengthy bear attack has only one visible edit, at about the five-­minute mark. In the basic sense, all the physical and zoological expectations of “bearness” are met: she moves with the assumed gravity of her extrapolated weight, how we would imagine a fierce bear defending her cub would instinctually act; her fur looks and moves like short, matted bear fur; and she always maintains the correct proportion in the frame. Gravity, logical movement, perspective, and texture are all basic expectations of effects realism. However, the sequence does not stop at the expected zoological naturalism. It is also evidently an effects spectacle. First of all, the sequence is timed, blocked, and staged like a sexual assault for maximum horrific tension. Not only is it presented virtuosically as largely a single take; we as viewers know without a shadow of a doubt that star Leonardo DiCaprio was never in such close proximity to any real attacking bear—and so logically the bear must be digitally generated. We as viewers hold our breath for the character Hugo Glass even as we know that the “real” DiCaprio was fine. The overall effect is so persuasive that we hardly ask ourselves how this convincing naturalism is achieved. In fact, the sequence is highly instructive in demonstrating the distinctive ILM aesthetic strategies at play through the three main cinematic aspects ILM manipulates to heighten the photorealism of the effects object in the shot: editing, camera movement, and lighting—specifically, strategic length of takes and careful blocking, haphazard-­looking movement, and obscuring lighting. First, the editing: although presented as mostly one take, the sequence is built using invisible digital edits and furthermore is organized into stages and rhythms. The sequence begins with a classic, sudden creature reveal: a closeup of Glass as he aims a rifle toward the foreground as the bear emerges from the shadowy underbrush in the background, advancing on him so quickly from behind that he does not have time to spin the gun around. We as viewers also only gradually realize what is happening. While the majority of the attack is presented as a single take, there are frequent invisible edits camouflaged by whip pans, the bear’s body, and even the bear fogging the camera lens with her snorting breath. The sequence exploits the visual credibility and spatial integrity associated with the long take in the way the bear is constantly in the frame and frequently very close to the camera, seeming to give us an unbroken look at her to visually test her “realness.” The camera distance Introduction\n\n15\n\nalso varies so the bear alternates being both close to the camera and also in a wider view in the background. The pacing of the sequence allows the chance for the bear to amble off to take care of her cubs while the camera stays on the injured Glass as he readies his gun, but when the bear returns to attack again, she mostly moves very quickly when her whole body is in frame, and when moving slowly she is either out of frame or in extreme close-­up. For contrast, we can recall how other films stage human/fierce animal interactions. For example, Bringing Up Baby (1938) puts its leopard in close proximity with stars Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant through elaborate mobile split screens. Other films stage animal attacks similar to that of the tiger face-­off in Gladiator (2000), where wide shots of the animal are interspersed with extreme close-­ups of the animal’s biting maw through rapid disorienting cuts, giving the sense of exciting action but not visual authenticity. Most do not dare use the long take, including the bear attack in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), which is very rapidly cut, about twenty seconds long, and with one good look at the full bear that lasts a few seconds. The Revenant bear’s long-­take presentation “proves” her credibility.28 As to the camera movement and framing in The Revenant, the wobbly frame and the constantly moving and reframing unstabilized camera gives the impression of a human camera operator filming an unpredictable event, rather than a smoothly planned elegant tableaux such as the leopard attack in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The Revenant scene appears as if it was shot by a foolheartedly brave (and coldly heartless) wildlife cameraperson. The movement varies from rapid whip pans when the bear is shaking her prey in her teeth to slowly tilting movements from Glass’s wincing face up to the bear as she pauses. However, when the bear is moving quickly, the camera is usually a beat or two behind the bear’s actions, suggesting an operator who does not know what the bear is going to do next but who wants to be sure everything gets filmed. Lastly, but crucially, is the lighting, which conceals as much if not more than it reveals. The heavy tree canopy provides a plausible reason for the overall dim lighting of the sequence, as well as a filter for the harder light shafts coming from between the backlit tree trunks. The drizzly, misty atmosphere puts damp particles in the air to soften the light further and delineate planes of action. The dim ambiance, backlighting, and what effects artists call “atmospherics” together causes\n\n16\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nviewers to think they are seeing more of the bear than they actually are. The bear is nearly constantly in frame, but what we see is largely backlit in silhouette. At the end of the sequence, after Glass stabs the bear, both she and Glass roll down a ravine away from the camera—the only wide shot in the sequence. Certainly, it was not wholly ILM’s creative decision to present the shot as a long take; neither was ILM entirely in charge of the pace and timing of the shot. Moreover, many of the aesthetic options must align with the look of rest of the film. Nevertheless, ILM was charged with putting across those filmic choices where it appeared that a real bear was mauling a real movie star. Through this visual analysis, we can see how the sequence’s photorealism comes not simply from a zoological or otherwise perceptual matching with reality. Instead, its sense of credibility, authenticity, naturalism, and seamlessness are all built up bit by bit through the specific aesthetic stylistic techniques its ILM artists deemed cinematically appropriate to the sequence. As a contrast to ILM-­produced effects sequences as in The Revenant, even when requisite time and money are spent on a mainstream would-­be blockbuster, narrow expectations of “good” live-­action effects can engender poor reception of a film’s effects aesthetic. Plenty of films including Geostorm (2017), The Meg (2018), and Greenland (2020) skate by with derivative and uninspired effects that are nevertheless within generally expected aesthetic parameters. We can see these basic parameters in works from filmmaking teams who are less interested in the effects process, do not have much clout over the production, or simply do not have high enough budgets. In those cases, many CGI-­heavy effects sequences gesture at an impoverished (or “cheap”) version of ILM’s style, but they also barely tweak established patterns. Other approaches, even in those produced by ILM, do not go by uncommented but are instead deemed “bad” effects, even though they are simply not in the expected version of the ILM photorealist style. We can see this demonstrated by the North American failure of the ILM-­led Warcraft, a film that appropriately took its design cues from the popular video game but whose effects were received by critics and audiences as “bad.” Indeed, Warcraft was laughed off the screen in North America by critics as “chintzy” and “soulless, incoherent, Renaissance Faire hooey,” and it was likewise rejected by audiences at the box office.29 Entertainment Weekly critic Chris Nashawaty said of the effects, “despite\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nFig. 0.02 Warcraft (2016): The Orcs here appropriately match the Warcraft video game characters but do not fulfill the audience’s aesthetics for photorealism.\n\nits massive budget, the special effects look cheap and cheesy,” which I would suggest is another way of saying not sufficiently photoreal and “too animated.” By way of example, in the first sequence of the film in which the orc lead characters are introduced, Durotan (Toby Kebbel) and Draka (Anna Galvin) engage in couples’ banter in a cozy fire-­lit room about the child in her very pregnant womb. The film’s opening shot fulfils audience effects expectations. Here, Durotan is shown in bust-­length close-­up. He is lightly backlit, but the scrupulous details of his face, hair, skin, tusks, and tribal ornaments make a strikingly photo­real impression of this computer-­generated humanoid creature. His skin tone has visible pores, color variety, texture, and warmth. Although he is mostly still during his voiceover, his eyes are alive—even moist-­looking—and his face moves with a subtlety that suggests thinking. The backlighting even shows a faint downy texture on his shoulders. This is the style of photorealism expected from ILM. However, it is the only shot of its kind in the film. When the next shot cuts to a close-­up of his waking wife, the detail is more amorphously sketched in (figure 0.02). Her eyes and mouth twitch naturalistically, but her untextured skin is only lightly detailed and synthetically smooth (in comparison to Durotan in the close-­ups that bookend this one). Her ornaments suggest bone and metal, but only by context. In the medium shot that follows, Draka is supine in the foreground, highlighting her pregnancy, while Durotan sits crouching in the background, reaching out to clasp her belly. While the initial close-­up of Durotan (no doubt the “hero shot” meant to impress in the trailer) was very intricately rendered for photorealistic effect (“if orcs existed and were then photographed”) this two-­shot reveals the\n\n18\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nmore consistent aesthetic of the movie, one of smooth animatedness to match the perceived expectations of the fan audience familiar with the lower-­resolution video game. Instead of humanlike textured skin with pores, veins, and color variation, Draka’s pregnant belly and Durotan’s upper torso have an overly even, Plasticine look. Much of the depiction of the orcs in the remainder of the film largely follows the ILM playbook: backlighting, atmospherics, unstable camera shots, and longish takes. Their movement is thoroughly naturalistic to their considerable bulk and exaggerated proportions in the expected standardized aesthetic parameters. However, the orcs retain their “animated” Plasticine sheen, like animated action figures or 3D-­printed objects. Why is this animated look evidently a problem for viewers? Perhaps the orcs’ evident animatedness pushes the live-­action object too much, as Sianne Ngai has contended in another context, toward the realm of the “cute.” According to Ngai: Cuteness is a response to the “unformed” look of infants, to the amorphous and blob-­like as opposed to the articulated or well defined. Indeed the more malleable or easily deformable the cute object appears the cuter it will seem.30\n\nIn this way, cuteness’s unformed, animated look can be seen as the opposite of the photoreal aesthetic, because cuteness is, to Ngai, visually “trivializing.” Certainly, for Warcraft, cuteness is a look that for most is at odds with the warrior culture depicted here, but generally speaking, animatedness and cuteness for effects artists evoke the risk of distancing—the dreaded “pulling the viewer out of the story.” It does so by calling attention to the movie-­made artificiality of character design when, ideally, characters should appear natural and seamless with their environment.31 This perceived trivialization likely connects to why effects artists constantly talk about avoiding the “digital curse” (animatedness) and why Disney feels the 2019 The Lion King and other “live-­action reboots” need to be classified as live-­action, not animation. The orc characters of Warcraft were designed and thoroughly rendered with as much defined detail and movement as, say, the Hulk or any character coming out of ILM’s workshop. However, the amorphous aesthetics matching the video game expected by the production leaned too far into animated cuteness rather than Revenant-­style photoreal environments. However, Warcraft hit big in China, where a broader effects realism expectation applies, one that is not so resistant to animatedness, as we shall see in chapter 4.32 Introduction\n\n19\n\nMethodology Researching a multibillion-­dollar corporation such as ILM within Lucas­ film is always a challenge, even more so now that it is owned by an even bigger conglomerate, The Walt Disney Company. It is difficult to separate public relations from reliable history, and academic accounts very rarely depart from the Lucasfilm/ILM company line. There is virtually no academic, unauthorized, primary-­source historical research on either Lucasfilm or ILM.33 The Star Wars films have been subject to academic fan studies and some limited industrial attention by academics. However, the majority of academic works considering ILM tend to cite Lucasfilm-­produced sources as fact or do not recognize that the information they are encountering is either PR or couched professional public rhetoric, as John Caldwell has described.34 There is a practical reason for this. Not surprisingly, there has been little upside for Lucasfilm to allow outside academic researchers into its archives, especially now that it is owned by Disney. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain reliable, non-ILM-authorized information about the company and its activities. Trade publications such as Variety and the Hollywood Reporter are useful for compiling the kind of material in chapter 1 regarding announcements of industrial and business dealings and partnerships, but they are likewise subject to the press release and publicity department information provided by Lucasfilm. Therefore, if an ILM spokesperson states on the record to Variety in 1989 that ILM had thirty-­five Silicon Graphics workstations, the publication generally takes it at face value. In most cases, reporters do not go to Marin County to see for themselves. When researching Hollywood special/visual effects, one inevitably encounters the long-­standing, fan-­targeted effects journal Cinefex, a subscription-­based quarterly that celebrated its fortieth anniversary in 2020 and published its final edition in 2021. Cinefex has played an important role to those hoping to join the effects industry as well as to scholars who are writing about it. To the scholar, Cinefex’s lengthy and highly detailed articles—typically on three to four movies per issue and that interview key personnel, collect “before and after” images, name the effects companies employed on the production, recount the technology in use, and regale the reader with production anecdotes—are valuable sources of basic information that is otherwise difficult to obtain. Since the 1980s, as the frequent tributes by aspiring filmmakers\n\n20\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nand effects artists within the pages attest, the Cinefex discourse has been absorbed into the artist’s image of the excitement and glamor of effects production. In this way Cinefex has enjoyed significant access to the practitioners who are happy to be part of the effects story of the films. However, as former Visual Effects Society president Jeff Okun has attested, Cinefex articles frequently present the effects production in idealized form. Using as an example of Okun’s own experience on Roland Emmerich’s Stargate (1994), he contended that the Cinefex article completely left out the details where he was fired and rehired several times over what he characterized as the director’s unreasonable demands.35 In other words, as detailed as these articles are, they are still choosing to leave out the less collegial or unpleasant aspects of the story. In this way, fan-­directed effects and science fiction–oriented publications such as Cinefex (1980–2021) and others, including Cinéfantastique (1967–2006 in its original incarnation) and Starlog (1976–2009), and prominent blogs such as ArtofVFX​.com and beforesandafters​.com, while thoroughly researched and not authored by Lucasfilm employees, are still limited to the information that the Lucasfilm/ILM interview subjects, press releases, and publicity departments provide. Moreover, although it goes largely unspoken, these sources are also constrained by the story the producers want told in exchange for continued access. That being said, publicly available entertainment journalism and the mainstream press provide more than just access to press releases and accounts of business dealings and industry analysis. They also provide a rich comparative accounting of what has been written about ILM in relation to other effects houses since the 1990s.36 Moreover, these sources provide a great deal of discourse to analyze, revealing the image that George Lucas, Lucasfilm, and ILM want to present of themselves as well as how the industry characterizes them. Despite these challenges, there are a few places where the researcher can find cracks in the façade. For example, there is one (and to my knowledge only one) readily available cache of ILM information outside of corporate hands: the former ILM general manager Thomas G. Smith’s papers at the Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin.37 Smith’s papers include effects storyboards, contracts, and publicity materials. But most relevant for this study are the Lucasfilm yearbooks, which cover 1982–1991 in the Ransom holdings.38 These yearbooks served several purposes for Lucasfilm employees, not unlike house organs during the studio era. The first is similar to Introduction\n\n21\n\nhigh-­school yearbooks, in that they were designed to forge a kind of corporate version of school spirit. Namely, yearbooks were distributed at the annual Fourth of July picnic: They feature snapshots of the intramural sports teams as well as dances, babies, pets, and candid poses; people even signed them like high-­school yearbooks. Also, like yearbooks, they include portrait photos of every Lucasfilm employee. Smith told me they were also used like school facebooks in the old, lowercase sense, so that people in various departments across Lucasfilm could look up colleagues in other divisions.39 They even frequently included personal information such as people’s occupational and educational history, romantic status, and astrological signs. In an interview with the author, Smith said they were only used in-­house and were not given to potential partners or investors.40 However, the yearbooks are not simply accounts of corporate culture where one can glimpse the Lucasfilm self-­image. For the researcher, while the yearbooks are hardly uncut raw data, they are a gold mine of minimally massaged information for internal use. Because every employee, division, and job title are included, one can track the configuration and transmutation of the Lucasfilm departments, job descriptions, and personnel over time. There are reports of what each department had accomplished that year, projects they worked on, and humorous accounts of what went wrong. Also, alongside the good times, one glimpses accounts of turmoil and rancor within the ranks. Finally, we can glean what the company’s priorities and emphases were by not only what is included but by what is left out. This material can be compared to press releases in the entertainment press and secondary sources such as the authorized Lucasfilm publications discussed in chapter 3. Perhaps not surprisingly, this information frequently conflicts with the corporate line, especially when one adds in other unpublished sources such as personal interviews and the less-­authorized discourses of former employees.41 As valuable as the unauthorized materials such as the yearbooks are, they are not the only sources on ILM available to the researcher. In addition, although effects practitioners are frequently limited by what they can discuss due to nondisclosure agreements and their companies’ policies, I was able to interview or access unpublished interviews with a great many effects artists, both retired and currently active. Through these various approaches, a less PR-­managed picture of ILM emerges. ILM’s dominance of the effects industry has asserted itself across\n\n22\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nseveral axes and across several decades. For that reason, concentrating on just one or even two aspects of ILM’s activities or a short time span would not sufficiently describe the scope of its control over the industry. My account of ILM’s business, aesthetic, cultural, and technological history over the span of the 1980s to the present day aims to create a historical amalgam that helps explain how and why ILM has been able to maintain such a sway over an entire sector of the entertainment industry for so long. For that reason, although there will be some overlap, the chapters alternate ILM’s aesthetic and industrial histories in roughly chronological order. Chapters 2, 4, and 5 provide a more interpretive approach: a historically contextualized aesthetic analysis based on a corpus of representative films. Chapters 1 and 3 include aesthetic analyses but are more empirical, concentrating on ILM’s industrial and technological history. Not unlike Tony Stark’s AI assistant Jarvis transforming into Vision, the ILM style has left ILM’s control and now has an independent life of its own. The ILM aesthetic is more prevalent than ever in the digital age and still represents the most culturally powerful model for effects aesthetics. One might imagine that ILM as an industrial entity would have become more powerful as a result of its partnership with Disney and the MCU. However, rather than presiding over the effects sector by leading its most prominent productions and demonstrating the state of the art with new “wows,” ILM, along with many other companies, is reduced to yet another contracted player producing the MCU’s version of nondescript grounded realism. Some practitioners have argued that the MCU version of the ILM style not only flattens it out to a featureless series of rules to follow but also guts the creative spark that kept ILM at the top of the effects business for four decades. The question remains: Is there room for the ILM aesthetic to continue to evolve? Or has Disney now fixed it in Jurassic Park–style amber (with DNA to be extracted for replication later on)? What is ILM within the Disney conglomeration?\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nONE\n\nILM Versus Everybody Else Effects Houses in the Digital Age\n\n[SPECIAL EFFECTS] IS NOT A BUSINESS THAT ANYBODY WHO WAS OUT TO MAKE MONEY WOULD GET INTO. —ILM FOUNDER GEORGE LUCAS\n\nTHE SPECIAL EFFECTS BUSINESS IS AN OXYMORON. —SCOTT ROSS, COFOUNDER OF DIGITAL DOMAIN AND LABOR ACTIVIST\n\nD\n\nue to special/visual effects’ ubiquity in nearly all high-­profile filmmaking today, it would be logical to assume that the effects business, under the direct conglomerate control of the studios, is a lucrative and stable one. However, as described in the introduction, this assumption is wrong. As George Lucas and Scott Ross (quoted just above) insist, one thing becomes abundantly clear when studying the recent Hollywood effects business: it is not an efficiently run, profit-­making venture. But if the effects business does not make money, how does it stay in business? It primarily sustains itself through an economic logic more in common with accounts of “labor of love” creative economies.1 More specifically, it does so largely through promoting the fantasy of working for an idolized cinematic visionary such as George Lucas and contributing to\n\n25\n\na Star Wars–size impact on the cultural landscape—the same fantasy that has driven the effects sector since the poststudio era. The effects business has always been difficult to square with recent depictions of “Hollywood in the New Millennium.” Tom Schatz has most influentially characterized the economic logic of the recent history of the movie industry around conglomeration, where large businesses become larger by acquiring competitors and working to create synergy across media by appealing to the largest audience possible.2 Toby Miller and colleagues have described a “global” Hollywood that uses coercive power as a content provider to force all markets to both adopt and adapt to Hollywood’s products and practices.3 However, an account of the effects industry cannot be neatly absorbed into these broader industry forces. It is exactly this labor-­of-­love economy that makes the effects industry different from other motion picture creative economies: It is not just that the effects business does not make money; it is minimally concerned with doing so. Much of the contemporary effects business still holds on to the 1970s ideals of creative labor out of which it emerged. Jeff Menne has described the broader Hollywood context for what he calls a “post-­Fordist” (a play on both the twentieth-­century system of mass production and the Classical Hollywood director John Ford) approach to industrial creative organization. In his formulation, 1970s self-­styled auteurs (e.g., Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola) charismatically led production teams willing to trade fair compensation and reasonable work hours for the feeling of the personal satisfaction in creating quality work.4 Menne convincingly contends that in these new poststudio production structures, the Classical Hollywood “genius of the system” is replaced or transmuted into an auteurist “economy of genius.”5 It is the effects industry version of this post-­Fordist creative economy that has made it an oxymoron: the romantic image as an artist’s dream job where working for an auteur trumps such trivialities as health insurance, overtime pay, and union membership. The effects business is able to function only because it exploits the 1970s economy of genius. To movie fans who eventually become effects workers, there is no more revered genius figure than George Lucas, the auteur who built his effects empire by cultivating an image of this idealized workplace. The smaller-­scale economy of genius, such as at Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic, has long relied on a workforce that sees the work as a passion project.6 Even more, the image of the effects industry as a desirable, creative, and fulfilling career for film professionals comes largely\n\n26\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nfrom a fantasy promoted by Industrial Light & Magic, whose production of documentaries, coffee-­table books, and other kinds of publicity still encourage thousands to jump into the effects business each year in the hope they might someday work on a movie such as Star Wars. The promise of artistic fulfilment is also the lifeblood of houses beyond ILM. And surprisingly, this romanticized notion of creative labor holds for those at the top of the sector as well as those entering it. Effects house Rhythm and Hues (R&H) founder John Hughes candidly states the unofficial credo of the effects artist: A vfx [visual effects] company is not a big moneymaking company. The margins are very, very, low. But we were never founded to make money. We’re not typical entrepreneurs. We’re here because this is what we love to do. As long as we’re not losing money, we’re ok.7\n\nThis idealization hits hard against the cold economics of media conglomerates that take advantage of this way of doing business. The truth is, most effects houses are losing money, at least most of the time. Nearly all effects artists toil in anonymity, lack union representation, work long hours with few benefits, and live a peripatetic lifestyle, moving from continent to continent to find work. As the quotes above and other professional rhetoric make clear, the consequences of the effects business’s labor of love is precarity.8 This comfort with low profit yield and high risks is the major reason the effects business is largely not owned and run directly by conglomerates. ILM has sidestepped these industry troubles by enjoying the financial patronage of its founder, Lucas, who long plowed Lucasfilm profits back into ILM. Until 2012, ILM was privately held by Lucasfilm and thus was not required to post earnings statements or satisfy outside investors. By all accounts, ILM is considered the effects company that everyone in the sector aspires to become.9 This has allowed for a more secure work environment, a more robust research and development program, and greater investment in technology than other companies could sustain. These advantages have meant that the rules of play for the effects sector, since ILM opened for outside business in 1980, can most accurately be described as “ILM versus everybody else.” ILM’s total dominance of the effects industry from the early 1980s through the 2010s cannot be understood without recognizing the complex economic and industrial context of the effects business. Moreover, one cannot grasp the business model of other rival top-­tier effects companies over that time, including ILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n27\n\nDigital Domain, Weta, and Sony Pictures Imageworks (Sony PI) and, later, Double Negative, Moving Picture Show, and Framestore (as well as a multitude of less prominent players) without a description of what ILM has represented to the industry, even if it has always been a superteam that, due to its built-­in advantages, lesser teams could not hope to surpass. Remarkably, as the labor of the effects artist has shifted from camera whizzes and handmade tinkerers to software gurus in front of monitors, the business model itself has not changed very much. However, the effects business’s shift into digital technologies throughout the 1990s challenged companies formed on the 1970s economy-­of-­genius model to adapt to conglomeration.\n\nThe Effects Industry Today: A Primer It is difficult to make money in the effects industry for several reasons, but mostly because of labor costs. Even though many effects workers are underpaid, the seemingly unending scrolls of contributors appearing in the movie credits attest to the huge roster of artists needed to complete a blockbuster film. The production companies they contract with are constantly trying to keep costs down, often insisting on flat-­fee structures (the project-­bid model) and undercutting per-­shot fees by contracting with lower-­cost startups. Also, effects companies are largely responsible for in-­house R&D and equipment costs. It may seem that the effects industry has much in common with other digital and e­ ffects-related industries. However, I will not be discussing related sectors such as physical effects, traditional makeup prostheses, 3D conversion, digital intermediate, and traditional animation—all of which require separate workforces, skill sets, and labor arrangements,10 though there is some overlap of activity and personnel. For example, although the 2019 Lion King remake and the Frozen films are both Disney productions, the artists who animate the motion-­capture lion (where the lion has to conform to photorealist standards) are nearly always an entirely different workforce (or occasionally a different division within the same company) than those who animate Elsa, Anna, and Olaf. In this book, I will more narrowly consider the impact of special/visual effects labor within traditional parameters. In other words, I will discuss the current iteration of the traditional special effects industry and specific skill sets. Although this has changed over the years, it remains surprisingly\n\n28\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nconsistent with earlier eras: various kinds of composite work in mattes, miniatures, effects animation, motion capture, and cleanup. The contemporary special/visual effects industry’s independently owned and operated houses provide an interesting problematic within models describing independent creative labor, which again has some issues in common with other areas (especially the video g ­ ame industry) but also a distinct history and configuration.11 First, the vast majority of effects houses are and have been independently owned and operated since the post-­Paramount decree in the 1950s.12 Thus, with a few exceptions, effects houses are not owned by the conglomerate studios that employ them. Though reductive, I am defining independence broadly here as “not conglomerate-­owned.” And to be clear, independence cannot in this case be characterized positively as a site of resistance to fight the forces of global conglomeration. The effects industry’s in-­between status—between artist and technician—combined with a failure to define itself is a major factor blocking it from possessing any kind of collectivization (which nearly all other production categories enjoy to some degree or another). Most contemporary effects workers do not belong to a union or a guild. Longtime effects artist and current labor advocate Scott Squires explained the lay of the land for effects workers circa 2010: By and large everyone working on a major motion picture are in a guild. The director, writers, actors, cinematographers, production designer, costume designer, sound recorder, stunts, special [physical] effects, grips, electricians, props, editors, make-­up artists, script supervisors, set decorators, scenic artists, hair stylists, their crews, etc. Even the producers have their own guild. Some of the animation companies (Disney, Dreamworks, Sony Animation) are covered by a guild. Visual effects is one of the few groups working in the film industry that are not unionized. These other guilds all get some type of profit sharing or residuals from the films they work on. Directors, writers and actors get checks based on the success of the film. Most of the below the line union workers get secondary sales (DVDs, etc.) residuals with the studios putting in a percentage into their health and welfare fund (MPI) to help offset health care costs.13\n\nAlthough guilds and unions are often discussed interchangeably, a guild, legally speaking, is a collective bargaining organization for independent contractors, whereas a union is a collective bargaining organization for employees. One entity, the Visual Effects Society (VES),\n\nILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n29\n\nappears to be an effects workers guild, but it is not. Founded in 1997, VES is a professional organization with no labor advocacy component. Its stated mission: The Visual Effects Society (VES) is a non-­profit professional, honorary society, dedicated to advancing the arts, sciences, and applications of visual effects and to improving the welfare of its members by providing professional enrichment and education, fostering community, and promoting industry recognition.14\n\nVES’s refusal to challenge and adequately address labor conditions has been a sticking point for many effects activists, including Squires and VFX Soldier blogger Daniel Lay. So, VES looks like a guild similar to the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), which it is modeled on, but is in fact merely an honorary professional society with minimal industry sway. How did all this come to pass? Why is the special/visual effects industry neither unionized nor under guild protection, thereby making its workers nearly unique as a labor category within Hollywood-­based film production? Put simply, the effects industry’s relationship with Hollywood has historically been “dependently independent.” It is a complicated story, so I will concentrate on what is relevant to the current situation.15 In the late 1910s and 1920s, patent-­holding effects artists such as Frank Williams (of the famed Williams Process, an early color differentiation composite process), for example, contracted their specialized techniques to the newly formed studios. At the same time, former “trickmen,” as they were called, joined with other camera talent such as cinematographers, helping form the ASC, and promoted themselves as masters of “special photographic effects” with skills ordinary cinematographers did not have.16 Many of these artists eventually landed steady work at the studios; many formed their own optical, title, and effects houses, which often did studio-­subcontracted optical shots, operating parallel to studios on a shot-­by-­shot basis, in a modestly profitable fashion.17 Fast-­forward to the 1970s, when the increase of companies inspired by Industrial Light & Magic popped up to compete for work on science-­fiction blockbusters. This is the era that intensified the project-­ bid system for contracting effects work; instead of a few composite shots here and there, companies were now bidding on providing all the effects for an entire film. The project-­bid model is what makes effects different from other independently contracted Hollywood creative labor. Most other Hollywood-­\n\n30\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nbased movie professionals are contracted for work on a specific project under a union-­or guild-­approved contract for a specific amount of time and should be paid when they go over that contracted time (even if lawsuits suggest this does not always happen). Through the long-­standing project-­bid model, a surplus of independent houses compete for jobs, often underbidding rivals to get them, and maintain razor-­thin profit margins. Houses are locked in to that price, no matter what the future holds (e.g., alterations, delays, or whatever else might affect final costs). A company can easily go bankrupt if the project folds or goes significantly over budget, since the effects company has to cover work already completed and/or budget overruns. This is what happened to Digital Domain, which worked on the now-mostly-forgotten Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), a film project that played a role in its bankruptcy.\n\nThe “Big Five” Effects Houses ILM did not create the conditions that keep the effects sector on the edge of insolvency. That blame can be placed squarely on the production entities working to keep effects costs down as the number of effects shots rose. ILM, the industry leader since the 1970s, even today is impacted by these historical industrial factors. However, ILM’s overwhelming economic and industrial advantages have contributed to the problems. ILM created an economic/aesthetic/ R&D model that the studios began to expect and forced all others to aspire to, but it was impossible to replicate. Moreover, ILM did not force its model on other companies through coercive business practices but instead through soft-­power initiatives. While many effects companies came and went over the decades, the sector’s top-­tier companies—those considered first for high-­profile blockbusters—from the early to mid-­1990s to the mid-­2010s remained consistent, though not exactly stable. In 2012, a crucial transition era saw an unprecedented amount of bankruptcies, acquisitions, and reformations. The trade rags and even nonspecialist publications such as Time identified the “Big Five” and the “Little Three” effects houses, all of which were mostly independently owned, California-­based, and Anglophone. The Big Five were, in order of their founding: Industrial Light & Magic (1978),18 owned by George Lucas’s corporate entity Lucasfilm in the Bay Area; Rhythm and Hues, founded by John Hughes and partners in 1987 in Los Angeles; Sony Pictures Imageworks, founded ILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n31\n\nin 1992 by Sony Studios (formerly Columbia-­Tristar) in Los Angeles; Digital Domain, founded in 1993 by James Cameron, Stan Winston, and Scott Ross in partnership with IBM in the Los Angeles area; and Weta, founded by the director Peter Jackson and partners in New Zealand as Weta Digital in 1992 (the only one not based in California).19 For most of their existences, ILM, R&H, DD, and Weta were independent companies. Sony Pictures Imageworks has always been and remains a subsidiary of the global Sony conglomerate. The Little Three—Double Negative (DNeg, 1998), The Moving Picture Company (MPC, 1987), and Framestore (1994)—are all London-­based companies, and were founded around the same time as the Big Five, but did not achieve top-­tier status until the 2010s. How we got to this configuration is a story of ambition and overreach. Rather than succumbing to the temptation to describe the effects business with the classic studio rhetoric, I will refer to the “top tier” of the effects industry rather than the “Big Five.” The handful of companies dominating the first three decades of digital effects production emerged out of different corporate contexts, all traceable to a template initially patterned after the 1970s and 1980s effects companies that grew out of the intensification of big effects films. Three of them (ILM, DD, and Weta), were formed by prominent filmmakers (George Lucas, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson, respectively) to exert greater control over the unruly effects work on their own projects. R&H arose from a commercial ad production company and was an early pioneer in computer-­ generated and computer-­assisted imagery. Sony Pictures Imageworks was designed by Sony Pictures to handle in-­house effects production and function as an R&D wing. This chapter provides an industrial and economic history to show how ILM was able to lord it over its rivals, both in perception and reality, until it was outmatched by an even bigger player. This chapter will follow ILM and its rivals on a historical trajectory from the early 1990s to 2014: 1991–1995: The Great Digital Expansion 1996–2000: The First Downturn 2001–2006: A Contradictory “Golden Age” 2007–2014: The Industry “on Fire”\n\nBefore the widespread adoption of digital effects, Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977) in the 1970s intensified the demand for elaborate effects\n\n32\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nprograms, contributing to the blockbusterization of the movie industry.20 Then, the 1980–1991 era represented a transition to an auteur-­ focused effects company different from the studio spinoffs characterizing the “effects/title/optical” companies that operated in Hollywood mid­century. Because I have established this history more thoroughly elsewhere, the discussion here will be brief.21 Already in the 1980s, the popular and industry press broadly recognized ILM as the effects industry’s undisputed leader, asserting that “ILM does more business than its five major competitors combined.”22 And even taking this rhetoric as hyperbole (which one frequently must when considering ILM press statements), until about 1991–1992, my research has established that ILM held the high end of the effects field largely to itself. Moreover, ILM in the 1980s had already begun to resemble less and less the “scrappy outsider” described in its self-­produced hagiography of the 1970s; it had already become an industry behemoth.23 However, that did not stop its PR machine from continuing to repeat and refine that rebel/outsider image for the next several decades.24 Inspired by the example of ILM’s work on Star Wars, the new style of effects house became the one-­stop shop, where a single company completed hundreds of effects shots for a film; at least, that was the aspirational model for effects production. The “five major competitors” were largely made up of companies founded by self-­styled “effects auteurs” to be much like ILM: Douglas Trumbull’s Future General, John Dykstra’s Apogee, Richard Edlund’s Boss, as well as Rob Blalack’s Praxis and the artist collective DreamQuest. Three of those five companies— Apogee, Praxis, and Boss—were founded by former prominent ILM artists, and Trumbull had an independent status as an effects auteur after well-­publicized work on 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). DreamQuest’s roster included a well-­respected group of effects artists that assembled largely on Douglas Trumbull–led effects projects such as Close Encounters and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).25 This initial set of rival companies was fairly frank about their lower status, even Dykstra’s Apogee, the industry’s recognized runner-­up. When asked in an interview “What kind of jobs did Apogee get in the 1980s?” former Apogee employee and later studio effects producer John Swallow replied frankly: “We got work that ILM didn’t get. . . . When they were full, we got more work.”26 Most worryingly, these companies did not have the Star Wars–size profits to sustain them during lean times given the slender profit margins of the project-­ ILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n33\n\nbid system.27 Those factors, along with corporate consolidation and the expense of the conversion to digital technology, caused all these early analog rivals to fold by the early to mid-­1990s.\n\n1991–1995: The Great Digital Expansion As elaborate effects programs and mounting effects shot counts became industry standard through the 1980s, the introduction of photoreal CGI sequences in the early 1990s demonstrated the audience attraction for a new “wow” factor. Two hugely successful ILM effects blockbusters were Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park, featuring showy displays of photoreal computer-­generated dinosaurs and cyborgs, and they captured the early 1990s public imagination, even though the films included only a small number of shots with CGI (about fifty to sixty each).28 After these hits, many productions were keen to include more extensive CGI effects sequences in their films, but the companies equipped with the technology and artists to provide them were very few and very expensive. This meant that, by 1991, a gap in the market had opened up. For the first time, several serious rivals with significant financial backing rose to challenge ILM, and those companies’ rhetoric proclaimed that such was their plan.29 ILM’s highly trained personnel were also a target. Many of the new companies, most aggressively Digital Domain and Sony Pictures Imageworks, poached executives and talent directly from ILM.30 The huge successes during this period also included Forrest Gump and Toy Story (1995, albeit in feature animation), films that expanded the industry’s notion of what was possible and foreshadowed the potential in different narrative contexts, from summer blockbusters to Oscar hopefuls. The audience attraction as well as the expense of digital conversion led to three important industrial trends in the early to mid-­1990s: director/effects house collaborations, studios’ move to in-­ house effects teams, and effects houses’ first round of attempts at media diversification. The first trend saw prominent directors establish their own effects companies to emulate ILM’s structural model. James Cameron’s Digital Domain, founded in a partnership with physical effects master Stan Winston and former ILM executive Scott Ross (as well as a 50 percent investment from the computing giant IBM), was designed to compete with ILM’s Lucasfilm bankroll. Cameron did not like relying on ILM for\n\n34\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nthe CGI effects in The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2. Owning the effects company seemed like the best way to control the effects on his productions. Weta Workshop was a New Zealand company that preexisted its partnership with Peter Jackson, but they formally collaborated in 1992 to make Jackson’s Heavenly Creatures (1994). Weta Workshop expanded to Weta Digital in 1992 and slowly gained prominence through the 1990s, culminating with the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the first of which was released in 2001. The second trend in the early 1990s saw the major studio and production facilities Warner Bros., Fox, Paramount, Disney, Sony, and also Dreamworks create or acquire in-­house effects teams. Like Cameron, it seemed logical that studios should want to directly own and control this increasingly central sector of the filmmaking process. Late in the period of digital expansion, the Hollywood Reporter put it skeptically: About [1994–1995], a theory rippled through studio exec suites that the pricey digital work beginning to creep into all aspects of movie production could be managed cost effectively by acquiring an ownership position in an effects vendor or even creating an elaborate on-­lot effects unit.31\n\nIn the mid-­1990s, a wave of studio acquisitions suggested a major shift in studio ownership of effects houses along the Sony PI model. Starting in 1993, Warner Brothers created Warner Digital, which grew to a staff of 300.32 Disney acquired prominent 1980s effects team DreamQuest Images in 1996.33 20th Century Fox combined two smaller effects houses, VIFX and Blue Sky animation, to create an in-­house effects team. Others did not buy effects houses outright but increased investment in companies. Dreamworks bought a 40 percent stake in the longtime house Pacific Data Images, and Digital Domain made a deal with MGM.34 As we shall see in the next period, the Hollywood Reporter’s skepticism was well founded. Studio ownership of effects houses proved to be short-­lived. Like Cameron, the studios underestimated the financial downside of owning and operating an effects house. The third trend saw effects companies attempting to diversify into other media and benefit from the belief that they were positioned to take advantage of an upcoming wave of digital convergence. While the dream of the earlier cycle of effects houses was to work only for feature effects blockbusters (again, like ILM), the newly digital sector’s tenuous profit margins meant they felt pressure from investors, shareholders, and/or corporate masters to create alternative, more consistent revenue ILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n35\n\nstreams. Rhythm and Hues, the smallest of the top tier, emerged from an early pioneer of diversified media content. R&H was an offshoot of the legendary 1970s–80s ad production and effects company Robert Abel and Associates, formed from Abel personnel shortly after the founder sold the company in 1987.35 R&H moved into digital effects out of TV ads, most prominently the digitally animated Coca-­Cola polar bear ads that debuted in 1993. Through this association, Rhythm and Hues created a niche in CGI animal effects that it occupied for decades. Again, the top-­tier companies—even ILM to a lesser degree—realized they could not exist on features alone. So once again, under the assumption that digital skills would cross over to other modes of production, they struggled to create revenue streams in other sectors such as TV ads and video games or branch out into the producer side, especially with feature animation. While it was a stated goal to be a one-­stop shop where any production could commission any kind of effects at any scale, the top tier’s distinct histories and backgrounds allowed for differentiation and specialization. Put simply, we can characterize the effects houses’ brand identities. ILM touted artisanal, handmade integrity and flawless magic from its “technical wizards.”36 Digital Domain promoted a forward-­thinking, sleek futurism with military efficiency37 and proclaimed itself the most digitally advanced of the effects houses. Weta publicized the wonder of its fantasy imagination, physical effects workshop, and outsider status in New Zealand.38 The Weta brand was ILM circa 1977—the lean, hungry young creative upstarts rooted in physical effects traditions but with a fresher approach. Rhythm & Hues marketed itself as technologically savvy, but with a freewheeling, hippie-­style eccentricity. R&H played up its sense of whimsy through its expertise in animal effects and the natural world, with strongly anthro-­and zoomorphic characterizations.39 Sony Pictures Imageworks, with the least specific image profile, is the most difficult to characterize. Sony PI did not have a Cameron or a Jackson as creative figurehead. What it did have above all else was its association with Sony. In other words, it boasted its well-­funded ability to do anything.40 All these companies wanted to be ILM. Sony PI emulated ILM in that it was backed by deep corporate pockets who saw the effects division as part of broader R&D interests. As of publication, Sony PI is still the only major effects company that was and is designed to be an in-­house effects team for a major studio. Sony bankrolled Sony PI so that it could potentially inform other areas of the\n\n36\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nelectronics giant’s divisions. In that way, like ILM, it was under less financial pressure than the other freestanding, independently held companies such as Rhythm & Hues and its smaller rivals, who had to hustle for steady work. This heavy investment from the Sony company should have meant fairly quick competitive parity with ILM. However, as both Sony PI and newcomer Digital Domain soon discovered, it was going to take more than money. Digital Domain cofounder James Cameron had worked with ILM on The Abyss and Terminator 2 and no doubt saw the advantage of shaping an effects team based on his own interests and aesthetic, rather than borrowing Lucas’s. Also, like Lucas, he wanted more intellectual property control over his creations, which applied to licensing and ancillary businesses. Rather than ILM’s rather quaint and artisanal adherence to optical approaches (even as it increasingly digitized), Cameron’s big promotional splash was to make ILM look outdated by plunging definitively into computer-­generated effects. As Cameron put it, in a bit of sloganeering: “It will all be done at a workstation. Your film will now be in the digital domain.”41 For financial partner IBM, like Sony, the advantage was that “IBM will also use the company as an R&D lab to develop software applications for other industries, ranging from medicine to construction, and even produce material for its long-­rumored digital network,”42 again following ILM, and in line with Sony PI. Variety described DD’s financial arrangement: The deal gives IBM a 50 percent equity stake in Digital Domain, the remainder evenly split among Cameron, Ross, and Winston. The ownership of new products would be decided case by case, with IBM getting first look.43\n\nWith an optimism that surely would make its founders laugh today, Variety reported: “Though Big Blue [IBM] doesn’t expect the new company to be profitable in the first year, a ‘very good’ rate of return is expected within three years.”44 Although the Wall Street Journal proclaimed in 1994 that “Industrial Light . . . is still the industry leader by far,”45 DD, in signature brash Cameron style, moved quickly and aggressively to take on ILM. The company’s quick ascent inspired intense industry resentment. As one anonymous rival put it, “[DD] didn’t work up from a small company paying dues, [but] stole everybody’s talent.”46 Although its first priority would be effects work for major motion pictures, DD expected to eventually develop “properties for other mediums, ranging from interactive ILM Versus Everybody Else\n\n37\n\nentertainment to videogames.” Speaking the corporate language of convergence, Cameron said: “Once digital, films can be turned into a pay-­per-­view movie, vidgame or interactive story. We intend on entering the interactive visual markets.”47 Digital Domain in its early days had broad-­reaching ambition for what it thought an effects house could do. However, these ambitious goals met with resistance from the corporate studios who wanted to keep expensive effects costs down and not share either profits or intellectual property, even in the face of Cameron’s considerable clout. Although geographically an outlier to the other 1990s houses based in California, Weta Digital was founded with many of the same goals as ILM and Digital Domain—that is, a workshop to support a filmmaker’s projects, in this case the New Zealand director Peter Jackson. However, while its influence over the industry has been substantial, Weta has existed on a smaller scale than its California-­based rivals. In this early stage, Weta was still working exclusively on Jackson projects such as Heavenly Creatures. Weta opened to outside (non-­Jackson) projects only in 2004, bolstered by a controversial labor and tax rebate agreement with the New Zealand government that allowed it to keep its prices lower than its US-­based competitors.48 In this way, Weta played an important role in what would characterize the next period: the increasing competition for international tax incentives to lure personnel and international productions to far-­flung parts of the world. In this earlier digital expansion period, while Weta was not yet as big as others in the top tier, it was making moves to become so. The last of Time magazine’s Big 5, Rhythm and Hues took a different trajectory. Although not founded by a powerful filmmaker or a large corporate entity, its roots, like ILM, were in hippie psychedelia and a strong self-­image as creative rebels.49 Several of its original personnel had been involved with the early wave of digital companies in the early 1980s, including the company Information International, Inc. (also known as Triple-­I). However, R&H early on built a niche by focusing on animals and creatures, both photorealistic and more whimsically stylized. Founded in 1987, R&H’s two big professional breakouts came in the mid-­1990s: the aforementioned animated Coca-­Cola polar bear ads (1993), and the talking farm animal feature film Babe (1995). Although not exclusively, its projects over the next twenty years strongly emphasized animals and digitally generated characters, including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), Babe: Pig in the City (1998), How the Grinch Stole\n\n38\n\nThe Empire of Effects\n\nChristmas (2000), Night at the Museum ("
