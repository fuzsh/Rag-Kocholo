        "text": "Godzilla 2000: Millennium (ゴジラ2000 ミレニアム Gojira Nisen: Mireniamu) is a 1999 Japanese science fiction kaiju film directed by Takao Okawara and written by Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura. It was the twenty-third film released in the Godzilla series, and is the only film to feature Orga. The film was released on December 11, 1999. Sony Pictures Entertainment's TriStar division, having the rights to the franchise at the time, released the film in the United States and Canada in August 2000 as Godzilla 2000; the last in the main Godzilla series to make a North American theatrical run until the Legendary Pictures remake. The film ignores continuity established by any previous films, aside from the original. The film was released on DVD by Sony Pictures on December 26, 2000, also under the title Godzilla 2000.\n\nPlot\n\nGodzilla is a literal force of nature to Japan (after the incident in 1954). After Y2K, the Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) functions independently to study the mutant dinosaur and predict his landfalls. Meanwhile, the scientists of Crisis Control Intelligence (CCI) find a sixty million year old UFO deep in the Japan Trench. As CCI attempts to raise the UFO to study it, it takes off into the sky on its own. Godzilla arrives and battles the Japan Self Defense Forces, now equipped with powerful Full Metal Missiles, but the UFO appears, searching for genetic information that only Godzilla possesses. It fights Godzilla to a standstill, driving the monster underwater, and then lands to replenish its solar power.\n\nYuji Shinoda, the founder of the GPN, discovers the secret to Godzilla's regenerative properties (named Organizer G1 in the Japanese version, but Regenerator G1 in the North American release), but so has the UFO. It frees itself from the JSDF's attempts to contain it, and heads for Shinjuku. After landing atop Tokyo Opera City Tower, it begins to drain all the files about Godzilla from Tokyo's master computers. CCI attempts to destroy the UFO using explosive charges, but Shinoda, attempting to find out more about the aliens, is nearly caught in the blast. He survives, and joins the rest of the cast on a nearby rooftop, watching the UFO. Almost in response, the UFO broadcasts its message of invasion and creating a new empire on earth, and Shinoda reveals that the aliens are after the regenerative properties contained inside Godzilla's DNA so that they may use it to re-form their bodies.\n\nGodzilla arrives and again battles the UFO. However, he is subdued by the UFO's assault, and it absorbs some of his DNA, which the aliens use to reform themselves outside the space ship as the gigantic Millennian. However, earth's atmosphere is different to the one the Millennian used to live in and so when it exposes itself to the atmosphere, it mutates into a horrible monster named Orga. Godzilla recovers and fights Orga, which calls on the UFO to aid it in battle, but Godzilla destroys it with a blast of his atomic ray. With the UFO decimated, Godzilla continues to strike the alien being, but the damage inflicted is quickly overcome by the creature's new healing factor, a trait the beast obtained from Godzilla's DNA. Eventually gaining the upper hand, Orga drains more of Godzilla's DNA, trying to convert itself into a Godzilla clone. Finally, Orga opens its mouth, intending to swallow Godzilla whole, but Godzilla tricks it by deliberately throwing his head into its throat. While Orga begins to transform, Godzilla unleashes his nuclear pulse, beheading Orga and blowing the alien to bits. Mitsuo Katagiri, head of CCI, dies when Godzilla partially destroys the roof of the building where he, Shinoda and the scientists were observing the battle. The remaining cast on the roof wonders why Godzilla protects them, even though he attacks them and they attack him. They eventually come up with, and agree on, the theory that perhaps \"there is a piece of Godzilla in all of us\" as Godzilla begins rampaging through Tokyo, but not end yet.\n\nOrga\n\nOrga (オルガ Oruga) is a Millenian that mutates after absorbing Godzilla's DNA. Orga is a hunch-backed monster with a thick, rubbery gray hide; most prominent are his massive three-clawed hands, which he uses to walk like a gorilla (though only in this movie; in all of his video game appearances, Orga walks normally). He has a short, thick tail and a short neck as well. His face has a square jaw with a prominent chin, lined with rows of serrated teeth. He can fire an energy wave from the hole in its left shoulder, and he is able to leap vast distances and heights. He also has an accelerated healing factor. Finally, Orga is able to absorb an opponent's DNA through his bite to gain their abilities and appearance; and can even detach his upper and lower jaws like a snake to unfold a hidden membrane in order to swallow an enemy whole and morph into it.\n\nCast\n\nGodzilla - Tsutomu Kitagawa\n\nYuji Shinoda - Takehiro Murata/Francois Chau\n\nYuki Ichinose - Naomi Nishida/Denise Iketani\n\nShiro Miyasaka - Shiro Sano/Jack Ong\n\nMitsuo Katagiri - Hiroshi Abe/Ron Yuan\n\nIo Shinoda - Mayu Suzuki /Rachel Crane\n\nOrga -Makoto Ito\n\nBox Office (Japan)\n\nGodzilla 2000 was produced on a budget of approximately $8,300,000. It opened in Japan on December 11, 1999 and grossed roughly $15,000,000 during its box office run, with approximately 2,000,000 admissions. The film was a moderate box office success, and was Japan's highest-grossing domestic release of the 1999 holiday season, partially due to the Y2K hype of the late 1990s.\n\nEnglish Versions\n\nThere were two English dubbed versions of this film. As is standard practice for Toho, the film was originally dubbed in Hong Kong for use in Toho's international version. A few lines from the international dub can be heard in the theatrical trailer for Sony's theatrical release, although the film was entirely re-dubbed by Asian-American voice actors (Schlesinger deliberately made this choice because he did not want the characters to sound like they were \"from Wisconsin.\"). Only one line from the international version (\"As long as the beer's cold, who cares?\") was used in the re-dubbed North American version. Toho apparently prefers the North American version so much that the international version has never been officially released anywhere in the world.\n\nTristar Pictures licensed Godzilla 2000 for theatrical distribution in North America. It would be the first and only Japanese Godzilla movie since Godzilla 1985 to be released in North American theaters. Mike Schlesinger, who supervised the North American release and adapted the script, said, \"It (Godzilla 2000) was such a spectacular success in Japan, we decided it was worth taking a shot, maybe the time was right for Godzilla to come back to theaters.\"[citation needed] Sony spent approximately $1,000,000 to re-edit and dub the movie in English, and an addition $10–12 million to market.\n\nAlterations\n\nThe English dubbed version of the film runs 99 minutes - eight minutes shorter in comparison to the 107-minute Japanese version. Most of these were minor edits done to improve the pacing, and the sound design of the movie was completely re-worked. J. Peter Robinson composed some new music meant to supplement Takayuki Hattori's music. The dubbing has a somewhat humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone to it, apparently in homage to Godzilla dubs of the 60s and 70s, with lines such as \"Great Caesar's Ghost!\", \"Bite me!\" and \"these missiles will go through Godzilla like crap through a goose!\". Some fans have criticized the English dubbed version of Godzilla 2000 for camping up what they perceive as a \"serious\" movie;[4] however, Toho and Takao Okawara approved all the changes to the film in advance, and various amusing sequences throughout the story (such as people comically surviving Godzilla's rampage early in the film) establish a light-hearted tone and make it evident that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. In an interview in Video Watchdog #71, Schlesinger noted that people in real life tend to speak humorously; he also felt that giving audiences some intentionally funny dialogue would make them less inclined to laugh at the monster scenes, which were supposed to be taken seriously. Originally, the film ended with the words \"The End?\" in cartoonish lettering, but Mike Schlesinger and Toho rejected that. \"The End?\" was removed from later home video and television releases. The ending was mistakenly retained for the out of print Spanish-subtitled VHS of the film.\n\nBox Office (US)\n\nTristar Pictures released Godzilla 2000 in 2,111 North American theatres on August 18, 2000. It grossed $4,407,720 ($2,087 per screen) in its opening weekend, on its way to a $10,037,390 final gross. Future Millennium Godzilla films would be released direct-to-DVD in North America.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nThe North American release of Godzilla 2000 met with mixed to positive critical reaction. It currently holds a rating of 57% at Rotten Tomatoes among all critics.\n\nBruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle said the film \"taps into a now-rare and innocent sense of wonder,\" and that \"its action scenes are well-conceived.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" grade, saying that Godzilla 2000 \"lands on an imaginative fault line somewhere between tackiness and awe.\" Jay Carr of the Boston Globe called Godzilla 2000 \"a ton of fun, and then some.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said \"it's great to have the big guy back.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews said the film \"uses the Godzilla formula effectively\" and \"represents solid, campy, escapist entertainment.\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide praised the film, saying that \"fans won't want to miss this addition to the canon.\"\n\nSusan Wloszczyna of USA Today said Godzilla 2000 \"may be dull, but the familiarity of it all makes it feel ceremonial, a reassuring ritual.\" David Edelstein of Slate said that he \"periodically tranced out,\" but added that \"it's fun to see\" and \"it still manages to dispel some of the lingering stink of Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake.\" Stephen Holden of the New York Times wasn't impressed, saying that \"only a die-hard fan of the long-running Japanese Godzilla series could love Godzilla 2000.\" Similarly, Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post remarked, \"Godzilla, go home.\"\n\nAmong kaiju-related websites, Stomp Tokyo said \"there are some pretty impressive special effects,\" and concluded that \"Godzilla 2000 delivers fairly well, if not spectacularly.\" Toho Kingdom criticized the Japanese version, saying \"it’s not hard to see why Godzilla 2000 was poorly received in Japan,\" but added that \"the US version ... is infinitely better than its poorly paced Japanese counterpart. In all, the US version made numerous badly needed cuts from the film to tighten it up.\"\n\nYonggary (Hangul: 용가리; RR: Yonggari) is a 1999 South Korean science fiction monster film directed by Shim Hyung-rae and is a reimagining of the character Yonggary, originating from the 1967 film Yongary: Monster from the Deep. Despite being a South Korean production, the film's principal cast consists of Western actors such as Harrison Young, Donna Phillipson, Richard B. Livingston, Briant Wells, Brad Sergi, Dan Cashman, and Bruce Cornwell.\n\nYonggary was released in South Korea on July 17, 1999 and was later re-released with an altered plot and updated special effects on January 20, 2001 as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition. The 2001 version was distributed in North America as Reptilian. The film was considered the most expensive South Korean film produced at the time of its release.\n\nHolly confronts Campbell about the mysterious deaths and quits after Campbell refuses to launch an investigation. Dr. Hughes manages to find Holly and reveals to her about the legend of Yonggary, the alien fossil, additional hieroglyphics, and that he has been held by the US government as a \"guest\" for the last two years. She dismisses his claims at first but comes around after he shows her classified data concerning the alien fossil.\n\nThey return to the dig site to stop Campbell but arrive too late when the alien ship sends one final beam that fully resurrects Yonggary, killing Campbell in the process. The alien ship dematerializes Yonggary and Holly and Dr. Hughes are taken into custody by Parker. Yonggary is then teleported right before them and manage to escape before a helicopter squadron engage Yonggary in battle, only to be defeated. The National Space Investigation Agency (NSIA) sends Stanley Mills to share information regarding the aliens with General Murdock and General Howell.\n\nMills explains that a paleontologist provided the NSIA with scientific evidence that an alien civilization visited the Earth 200 million years ago and that vital information in defeated the aliens was stolen. Mills vouches in capturing the aliens alive but General Howell wishes to destroy the aliens instead. Yonggary is then teleported to a city and proceeds to go on a rampage.\n\nDr. Hughes and Holly arrive at the UNDA base, only to be confronted by Mills, who reveals that Dr. Hughes was the paleontologist who shared his discoveries with the NSIA and later stole information from their lab. Dr. Hughes counters that he told the NSIA that the hieroglyphics were a warning and they chose to ignore them. Mills attempts to take the stolen data disc back from Dr. Hughes but fails and attempts to leave but is forced to stay by General Murdock.\n\nAs the UNDA continues fighting Yonggary, the President tells General Murdock that he will give them five hours to destroy Yonggary or a nuclear bomb will be dropped on the monster. Looking at all their limited options, General Murdock orders General Thomas to dispatch his experimental Project T Forces to attack Yonggary.\n\nDr. Hughes and Holly then decode the additional hieroglyphics and discover that the aliens are controlling Yonggary through a diamond shaped receptor on his forehead and that \"another great light will be sent to do battle\".

The film utilized 124 miniatures and the designers spent 6 months designing Yonggary. Sculptures of the monsters were made in 6 months which were then scanned to digital screens for 3D work. Suits were produced for the monsters but were replaced with Computer-generated imagery during post-production. The film was in production for 18 months and resulted in 45 minutes of computer graphics.\n\n2001 Upgrade Edition\n\nAfter the film's successful opening, the filmmakers decided to expand the film with additional CG effects, new sets, an expanded story and additional characters, and began reshooting in December 1999. This version would later be released in early 2001 as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition and as Reptilian for its North American home video release.\n\nMarketing\n\nIn 1998, a 2-minute preview titled \"Yonggary 1998\" was produced and shown at the Cannes Film Festival for potential international distributors, which generated interest from Warner Bros. and United International Pictures. Before entering production, the film already had prior sales of $2.72 million after signing nine contracts of copyrights with Germany, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, and others. Yonggary was given attention in magazines that were published during the festival.\n\nRelease\n\nTheatrical release\n\nYonggary was released in South Korea on July 17, 1999. The film opened at the Korean Culture Center in Seoul, the first time a film premiered at the center, and sold 120,000 admissions on its opening day and one million admissions during its opening weekend. The film was released in 85 theaters in South Korea, the highest number for any movie released in South Korea at the time. The film was considered the most expensive South Korean film produced at the time of its release.\n\nThe film was later re-released on January 20, 2001 with updated special effects and an altered story as Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition, however, the re-release was a critical and commercial flop.\n\nHome media\n\nThe 2001 version was released on DVD by Columbia Tristar on August 21, 2001 as Reptilian, marking the film's only home video release to date. Colombia TriStar later released the film on VHS on March 5, 2002.\n\nReception\n\nChuck Arrington from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the film's acting and dialogue, calling it \"painful\". But also wrote that the film was funny enough to merit renting it. StompTokyo.com gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's poor quality special effects, calling it \"cartoonish\".\n\nGamera 3: The Revenge of Iris (ガメラ3 邪神〈イリス〉覚醒 Gamera Surī Jyashin Irisu Kakusei) is a 1999 Japanese kaiju film directed and co-written by Shusuke Kaneko. The film is a sequel to Gamera 2: Attack of Legion and the eleventh feature film in the Gamera series, and the third film in the 1990s trilogy of Gamera films. The film stars Ayana Hirasaka (Ai Maeda), an emotionally troubled young girl who forms a psychic bond with a highly aggressive parasitic creature known as Iris that feeds upon her rage and hate for the giant fire-breathing turtle Gamera, who had unwittingly killed Hirsaka's parents. Gamera later defends Japan from a swarm of monsters called Gyaos after he is confronted by and battles Iris.\n\nGamera 3: The Revenge of Iris was shown at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival and received the Mainichi Film Concours award for Best Sound Recording in Japan. The film received positive reviews from film critics who praised its special effects with many praising it as one of the best in the Gamera film series.\n\nThe girl's classmate manages to free her from Iris' cocoon, but it leaves its lair and kills half of the village's populace, later growing into its adult form. The military attempts to destroy it, but fails.\n\n​Iris flies toward the city of Kyoto, where Ayana has been taken by Asakura and Kurata, with Asakura deliberately trying to use the girl to summon Iris. Iris is intercepted in mid-flight by Gamera, and the two engage in an aerial battle, but the Japanese army intervenes and knocks Gamera out of the sky with a tactical missile strike. Nagamine and Asagi, the girl once psychically linked with Gamera, retrieve Ayana and attempt unsuccessfully to get her out of Kyoto. Kurata expresses a belief that Iris had been deliberately created to defeat Gamera so that the Gyaos could wipe out modern humanity.\n\nThe two monsters meet and continue their fight, but Iris easily gains the upper hand, impaling Gamera and leaving it for dead. Iris then makes its way to the train station and absorbs Ayana, killing Asakura and Kurata in the process. From within Iris' body, Ayana experiences the creature's memories and realises that her hatred and bitterness motivated it. Just as she has her epiphany, Gamera plunges its hand deep into Iris' chest and wrenches the girl free, robbing Iris of its human merge. Miss Nagamine and Asagi, trapped within the train station's wreckage, watch helplessly as Iris impales Gamera's hand and begins to syphon its blood, creating fireballs with its tentacles. Gamera blasts off its injured hand, and absorbs Iris's fireballs, forming a fiery plasma fist, which it drives into Iris' wounded chest.\n\nIris explodes, blowing the roof off the crumbling train station. The comatose Ayana still clutched in its fist, Gamera sets the girl down where Nagamine and Asagi are hiding. The women are unable to revive her, but Gamera lets out a roar and Ayana awakens. Gamera leaves the girl wondering why it would save her life after all she had done. A swarm of Gyaos, thousands strong, begins to descend on Japan intent on destroying their greatest foe once and for all, while Gamera lets out a final roar of defiance as it stands its ground in the center of a blazing city.\n\nCast\n\nShinobu Nakayama as Mayumi Nagamine\n\nAi Maeda as Ayana Hirasaka\n\nAyako Fujitani as Asagi Kusanagi\n\nSenri Yamasaki as Mito Asakura\n\nToru Tezuka as Shinya Kurata\n\nTakasaki Nayami as GF Colonel Takoshi\n\nHakosaki Sato as GF General\n\nKenji Soto as Dr. Sato\n\nYukijirō Hotaru as Inspector Osako\n\nMasahiko Tsugawa as Commander in Chief of the Air Defence Command (Lieutenant General)\n\nHirofumi Fukuzawa as Gamera\n\nAkira Ohashi as Iris\n\nKei Horie as Shigeki Hinohara\n\nAki Maeda as Young Ayana\n\nYukie Nakama as Female Camper\n\nProduction\n\nMany members of the crew who worked on Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris had previous work in the Gamera film series. Director Shusuke Kaneko directed both Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995) and Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996). Gamera 3 marks the first Gamera film that Kaneko had screenwriting credits on as he co-wrote the film with Kazunori Ito who had previously written the previous two 1990s Gamera films. The music composer Kow Otani and special effects director Shinji Higuchi was also a regular with the series, previously working on both films.\n\nRelease\n\nGamera 3: The Revenge of Iris was released in Japan on March 3, 1999. The film grossed over $15 million on its release. The film had its North American premiere at G-Fest in 1999 and was also shown at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival. The film did not have a wide release in North America, and was released direct-to-video on DVD on June 10, 2003 by A.D.V. Films. The film was released on Blu-ray by Mill Creek Entertainment on September 27, 2011.\n\nGamera 3: The Revenge of Iris was followed up by Gamera the Brave directed by Ryuta Tasaki in 2006. The film's plot ignores the events of the three films directed by Kaneko.\n\nReception\n\nIn Japan, Gamera 3: The Revenge of Iris won the award for Best Sound Recording at the 54th Mainichi Film Concours ceremony.\n\nWestern reviewers praised the film as one of the best in the Gamera series commenting on the special effects in the film. Variety stated the film was \"somewhat more elaborate\" and \"grittier and hipper\" than Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995) and Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996) as well stating that the monster Gamera appeared \"more threatening\". Variety also described the special effects in the film as \"good by model/miniature/animated standards\" but felt that were not up to the standards of American special effects. The San Francisco Chronicle felt the film's plot was similar to an episode of The X-Files and praised the special effects in the film opining that \"The special effects are terrific, although the monsters still look like guys in rubber suits. Fans of the genre wouldn't have it any other way.\" Film critic Tom Mes referred to the film as the best Gamera film to date, opining that the film \"delivers everything a movie about huge, fighting, city-stomping monsters should have: excitement, slam-bang action sequences, beautifully designed creatures, and yes, even stunning special effects\" Time felt that the film was stronger than Gamera 2: Attack of Legion, stating the film is stronger \"because it has much less Gamera; there's only so much character richness, let alone fun, to be found in shell, teeth, eyes, claws, scales, etc. But the movie has thrills for those who need 'em. Toward the end, a young scientist faces Iris and his doom and, a moment before he dies, screams like a cheerleader at his own immolation: \"Oh boy, is this scary? Yes!\" I second that notion.\"\n\nMighty Joe Young is a 1998 American adventure film based on the 1949 film of the same name. It was directed by Ron Underwood and stars Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron. In the newer film's version, the ape is much larger than in the original. The film grossed $50.6 million in the United States against a production budget of $90 million.\n\nDuring a gala, Strasser's henchman, Garth, uses a poacher's noisemaker to scare Joe into a frenzy. Joe trashes the gala, with the intention of attacking Strasser, but is captured, and imprisoned in a concrete bunker.\n\nWhen Jill discovers that Joe may be euthanized, she accepts Strasser's offer. She and the refuge staff smuggle Joe out in a truck. Before their departure, Gregg has fallen in love with Jill and kisses her goodbye. On the way to the airport, Jill notices the half-glove covering Strasser's missing fingers and recognizes him. She fights Strasser and Garth, then jumps from the truck onto Hollywood Boulevard, leading to several automobile accidents. Joe sees her and tilts the truck over onto its side and flees.\n\nGregg discovers that Strasser is a poacher and goes after Jill and Joe. He finds Jill, who reveals to Gregg that Strasser killed her mother and now plans to kill Joe. They track Joe to a carnival where he is playfully wreaking havoc. Strasser arrives as well and attempts to shoot Jill, but Garth, appalled at Strasser's ruthlessness, turns against him and saves Jill, causing Strasser to misfire at a spotlight, starting a fire and causing the Ferris wheel to break down. After knocking Garth unconscious, Strasser attempts to kill Jill in person, but Joe sneaks up behind them and throws Strasser onto a power line over a transformer. Short two fingers on the hand holding the wire, Strasser loses his grip and falls onto the transformer, where he is electrocuted to death.\n\nLater, at the Santa Monica Pier, Joe attempts to save a child from atop the burning wheel, but the fire burns it down and Joe and the child fall to the ground, where Joe jumps off of the burning wheel, protecting the boy and knocking himself unconscious. Joe survives the fall and awakens and Jill mentions that they need to raise money to open a preserve for him. The young boy named Jason donates some change to Jill after hearing this, prompting the rest of the crowd to contribute.\n\nJoe is returned to Uganda where Jill and Gregg open the \"Joe Young Preserve.\" Finally free, Joe runs off into the jungle.\n\nCast\n\nBill Paxton as Professor Gregory \"Gregg\" O'Hara\n\nCharlize Theron as Jill Young\n\nJohn Alexander as Mighty Joe Young\n\nRade Šerbedžija as Andrei Strasser\n\nRegina King as Cecily Banks\n\nPeter Firth as Garth\n\nNaveen Andrews as Pindi\n\nDavid Paymer as Harry Ruben\n\nRobert Wisdom as Kweli\n\nChristian Clemenson as Jack\n\nGeoffrey Blake as Vern\n\nLawrence Pressman as Doctor Elliot Baker\n\nLinda Purl as Doctor Ruth Young\n\nMika Boorem as Young Jill Young\n\nCory Buck as Jason\n\nProduction\n\nCinematographer Donald Peterman suffered head injuries, a broken leg and broken ribs in a crane accident on the film set in 1997. His camera platform plummeted 18 feet (5.5 m) to the ground when the crane snapped. A cameraman was also injured in the accident.\n\nIn most of the film, Joe was portrayed by creature-suit performer John Alexander, who wore a radio-controlled animatronic gorilla mask and full body suit created by special makeup effects artist Rick Baker and his crew at Cinovation Studios. To achieve those scenes, Alexander often acted on miniature sets surrounded by blue screen; visual-effects house DreamQuest Images then composited him into footage shot earlier. Joe as an infant was performed by Verne Troyer. For certain scenes, the filmmakers used three full-sized animatronics (one in quadruped, one sitting down, and one in a dead position) also created by Baker's crew. For the digital Joe, visual-effects houses DreamQuest Images and Industrial Light & Magic worked on different scenes, using the same model provided by Baker. Many of these performances were achieved by key-frame animation, but to portray the digital Joe running and jumping, motion-capture data from an infant chimpanzee were used.\n\nReception\n\nThe film grossed $50.6 million against a production budget of $90 million. and holds a rating of 52% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews. The site's critical consensus is: \"Beguiling effects transcend a predictable plot.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying, \"Mighty Joe Young is an energetic, robust adventure tale: not too cynical, violent or fragmented for kids, not too tame for adults. After all the calculation behind \"Godzilla\" or \"Armageddon,\" it has a kind of innocence. It's not about a monster but about a very big, well-meaning gorilla that just wants to be left in peace.\" Despite giving the film positive reviews, he also pointed out that the romance scenes and villains were only average and by no means exceptional. Common Sense Media gave the film 4 stars and said, \"The 1949 RKO version of Mighty Joe Young is a tired monster film of the ape-runs-amuck variety that tried (unsuccessfully) to cash in on the popularity of King Kong. This Disney version has plenty more to offer a young audience. As Jill follows in her mom's footsteps, this environmentally-friendly story provides serious food for thought. It also provides plenty of comic relief. Joe is a feat of technical wizardry; he's so life-like that it's hard to believe he's a composite of animatronic and digital effects. Children will warm to him, especially since Joe is particularly sweet to kids. They will also enjoy Theron's and Paxton's engaging performances, and applaud (as an 8 year-old viewer did) when this couple inevitably gets together. If the climactic sequence is too intense for small children, it certainly ends happily. Mighty Joe Young turns out to be a heart-warming experience with an environmental message.\" Reelviews Movie Reviews gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and generally positive reviews: \"Although Joe's size makes him a monster, his disposition makes him cuddly. Despite not being daring in style or story, Mighty Joe Young is nevertheless a charming and enjoyable adventure, and a rare remake that's better than the original. It may not have the box office punch to exceed the $100 million mark, but it's good enough to entertain an audience.\" Colin Fraser of eFilm Critic gave it 3 stars, saying, \"Strictly for ten-year-olds, Mighty Joe Young has its ample heart in exactly the right place. After an opening sequence that will have kiddies reaching for Kleenex, the action soon picks up with many a thrill on the way. This is not Jurassic Park however and doesn't really deserve its Academy nomination for effects.\"\n\nAmong those who criticized the film included Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide, who gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and said, \"This is technology-driven spectacle: It's too shallow to really work for adults, but so slow and relentlessly serious that kids are bound to get restless. Joe himself is an amazing creation, less personable, to be sure, than the original lovelorn King Kong, but a far more fully realized character than any of the flesh and blood humans by whom he's surrounded.\" Paul Clinton of CNN gave it negative reviews, saying, \"Great scenery, cartoonish villains, huges leaps of suspended belief, and mouthwatering shots of Charlize Theron are in plentiful supply in \"Mighty Joe Young.\" And baby, can this boy travel. He goes from Africa to L.A. in just one dissolve. Then when he escapes he goes from Hollywood Boulevard, to the Los Angeles river, to the Pacific Palisades in seconds. If you're not familiar with L.A ... trust me ... couldn't happen.\" and \"The gorilla is pretty impressive and expressive, but overall it's much ado about -- not much. I have a feeling this film will be fairly low on the food chain of \"must see\" holiday films.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film generally unfavorable reviews, saying, \"Mighty Joe Young, directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own.\" Dustin Putman gave it 2 stars out of 4 and negative reviews, saying, \"Mighty Joe Young is an agreeable time-waster for older kids (it's much too violent for the youngest viewers) and perhaps some adults, but in a season when children could also choose to see the marvelous \"The Prince of Egypt,\" and adults could pick any number of far superior films, \"Mighty Joe Young\" simply pales in comparison. Although you could certainly do much worse, there is only one really distinctive quality about the film, and that is Charlize Theron's charismatic performance.\"\n\nMighty Joe Young also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects, losing to What Dreams May Come.\n\nRebirth of Mothra 3 (モスラ 3 キングギドラ来襲 Mosura Surī Kingu Gidora Raishū, released in Japan as Mothra 3: Invasion of King Ghidorah) is a 1998 Japanese tokusatsu kaiju film featuring Mothra, produced and distributed by Toho. The film is directed by Okihiro Yoneda and is the third and final film in the Rebirth of Mothra trilogy. The film was released in Japan on December 12, 1998.\n\nThankfully, at Moll and Lora's calling, Rainbow Mothra arrives and begins to battle King Ghidorah, but the three headed demon's ancient powers render all of Mothra's attacks useless and the King of Terror proceeds to easily dominate Rainbow Mothra, who only just escapes. Later, Moll and Lora encounter Ghidorah, who infects Lora with its evil by staring into Lora's eyes. Under Ghidorah's spell, Lora attacks Moll and attempts to drag them both into the dome. However, Fairy Mothra flies down towards the dome and saves Moll before she falls into it. Belvera, intrigued by Ghidorah's arrival, gets too close to the dome and is dragged inside with her pet henchmen, Garu-Garu, by little serpent beings. The monster then wreaks havoc in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Moll and Fairy Mothra encounter Shota, who discovered that his brother Shuehei and sister Tamako are among the many children trapped inside the dome. Moll tells Shota about Ghidorah's plan to use the children's life force to feed upon. She convinces him to accompany her and meet their only hope, the recovering Rainbow Mothra. Moll and Rainbow Mothra communicate telepathically, discussing their options. It is agreed that Rainbow Mothra cannot defeat Ghidorah in its current form and so it is decided that he must travel to a time when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth, and when the three-headed dragon had visited from space for the first time, then less powerful, to feed upon the Earth's life-force. Rainbow Mothra turns into AquaMothra and, with Moll giving the creature all of her powers, the massive insect turns into Light Speed Mothra and breaks through the boundaries of time and travel to confront Ghidorah, some 65 million years in the past. Moll gives Shota her sword and asks him to go inside the dome to find Lora, and to convince her to use her powers to help Mothra. After Shota reluctantly agrees, Moll languishes and, with her powers totally depleted from helping Mothra time-travel, falls into a state of suspended animation, her body taking on the appearance of frosted glass. Shota allows Ghidorah to capture him so he can find Lora in the dome. There, Lora encounters a worried Belvera, who tells her that Ghidorah plans to destroy the Earth. Lora takes the triangular unit that Belvera had and uses it to transform her sword. Still under Ghidorah's spell, the two fairies engage in a sword fight, with Belvera begging Lora to see reason and to work with her, but to no avail. Shota finds Lora, but she attacks him and attempts to stab him with her sword. Belvera warns Lora not to do it as Shota reminds her that she loves children deeply. Soon, Ghidorah's spell breaks and Lora falls into Shota's hands, her sword then combining with Moll's. Belvera finally realizes that the Alias triangle represents the three of them, uses the last remaining triangular unit to transform her sword, and then combines her sword with both Lora's and Moll's. Using the new superpower sword, she attempts to break open the dome as Lora recovers. Light Speed Mothra appears in the age of the dinosaurs and turns back into Rainbow Mothra. Another fight between her and Ghidorah takes place. After originally holding the advantage, Rainbow Mothra is badly wounded. The dome shakes violently and realizing that Rainbow Mothra is losing the battle, Shota asks Lora to use her powers to help the creature. As Lora sings, Rainbow Mothra energizes and manages to immobilize Ghidorah long enough to pick it up and drop it into a nearby volcano, but not before a severed piece of Ghidorah's tail burrows itself into the ground. The volcano erupts with Ghidorah in it, destroying the monster. Rainbow Mothra is hurled out of the exploding volcano, crashes to the ground and dies.\n\n​Back in the present time, Ghidorah and the dome disappear, freeing the children and the fairies. Shota reunites with Shuehei and Tamako and they join Belvera and Lora as they sadly kneel by the body of Moll, unsure of how they can save her. Back in the past, three Primitive Mothra larvae arrive and wrap the body of Rainbow Mothra in a time-capsule cocoon. Back in the present, Belvera expresses concern to Lora, noting that if Ghidorah is really destroyed, the current course of events would have changed. Suddenly, Ghidorah appears in the sky amidst a massive fireball. This is the other Ghidorah which grew from the severed tail of the creature killed by Rainbow Mothra in the past. The new Ghidorah starts to capture children again. Meanwhile, Belvera convinces Lora to join her in battle, and the two distracts Ghidorah with Fairy Mothra. Suddenly, the time-capsule cocoon explodes from a mountain and Rainbow Mothra emerges, this time as Armor Mothra, a formidable version with armour plating all over it. Another battle takes place, and this time, Ghidorah is no match for his opponent, who slices Ghidorah's wing off and then disintegrates the monster. Armor Mothra then communicates with Belvera and Lora, telling them to join their powers and, using the sword, to bring Moll back to life. The fairies do as they are told and, as a result, the sword vanishes and Moll revives, as Lora and Belvera smile. The touching reunion between the three sisters is short-lived, as Belvera calls for Garugaru and flies off. All the children are released once again and reunited with their parents. Shota, Shuehei, Tamako and their parents watch as Moll and Lora ride away with Fairy Mothra, and Armor Mothra, now transformed as Eternal Mothra, flies into the sunset.\n\nCast\n\nMoll - Megumi Kobayashi\n\nLora - Misato Tate\n\nBelvera - Aki Hano\n\nSchool Principal - Koichi Ueda\n\nShota Sonoda - Takuma Yoshizawa\n\nTamako Sonoda - Ayano Suzuki\n\nHome media releases\n\nBlu-ray Sony (Toho Godzilla Collection)\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1 (1080p) [AVC]\n\nSoundtrack(s): Japanese and English (DTS-HD 2.0 Stereo)\n\nSubtitles: English, English SDH and French\n\nExtras:\n\nTheatrical Trailer (1080i, 2:04)\n\nTeaser 1 (1080i, 0:23)\n\nTeaser 2 (1080i, 1:14)\n\nNotes: Comes with Rebirth of Mothra and Rebirth of Mothra II.
