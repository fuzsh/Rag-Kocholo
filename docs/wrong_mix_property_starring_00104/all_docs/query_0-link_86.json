        "text": "Gettin’ sloppy.\n\nI love the premise of giving 26 different filmmakers free reign to make a short film on a theme. Sign me up for more of that. That said, ABCs of Death 2 (2014) is quite a mixed bag…like a lot of anthology films. I get that it’s horror, but some tales were a bit too nasty for me. And the most creative and clever ones were merely a welcome reprieve at best. Each segment, for better or worse, left me pretty empty. When the tone is just shocking with little or no point of view, it can feel rather mean and pointless, but maybe some folks enjoy that.\n\nI guess this just isn’t for me. In my opinion, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was the more interesting anthology about death, and kinda said something about it beyond being merely horrible.\n\nFully Moon Features presents the direct-to-video Dark Angel: The Ascent (1994). A demoness (Veronica Maria Theresa Iscariot of Hell, played by Angela Featherstone) longs to be free and see the human world. Compelled to gaze upon sin and destroy it, she falls in love with a pure-hearted doctor and ultimately saves his soul and gains one for herself. It’s kinda like a sleazy Christian version of The Little Mermaid with bad acting. So it was pretty reasonably entertaining. Interesting portrayal of demons, actually. They’re like ignorant serfs.\n\nIn 1922, F.W. Murnau stole Bram Stoker’s Dracula concept without permission and made a vampire classic. In 1979, Werner Herzog remade Murnau’s movie with Klaus Kinski in the lead role. And in 1988, Kinski returned for one of the worst and most baffling sequels of all time. It’s Nosferatu in Venice!\n\nThe bat is back [*he never turns into a bat] and looking like a washed up rocker about ten seconds from death, and that’s not makeup this time; that’s just what Kinski looked like in 1988. I’ll give it props for the Venice setting, although they do manage to make perhaps the dreariest and worst postcard for the city ever. Christopher Plummer plays a vampire hunter and it feels like he’s sleepwalking through a script he knows is nonsensical. Donald Pleasence is eating something in almost every scene. And please give some credit to Anne Knecht who had to be naked and groped by Kinski in what was her only film role. She didn’t deserve that.\n\nThere’s not really much of a plot, and as baffling as it is, it’s not really consistently funny enough to be so-bad-it’s-good. It’s sort of a vibes movie, but the vibes are bad.\n\nAn infamously plagued production (in no small part due to Kinski being an insane diva, legend has it), and at turns directed by Augusto Caminito, Klaus Kinski, Luigi Cozzi, Mario Caiano, and Maurizio Lucidi, the whole film is a tepid, meandering mess with no horror and zero sex appeal.\n\nDirector duo Cameron and Colin Cairnes mix horror, humor, found footage, and 70s aesthetics in Late Night With the Devil (2023)…and it fails at acheiving any of it. It’s not funny or scary. The found footage conceit doesn’t really work, and is barely attempted despite being set on a talk show surrounded by cameras. They have 70s clothes, but it never convincingly feels 70s. There isn’t really any attempt at replicating 70s television camera angles or imperfections. Some questionable acting in there too. And the movie uses AI imagery in its interstitials. The whole thing feels cheap.\n\nLate Night With the Devil at least gives character actor David Dastmalchian a starring role, which is nice, but the script isn’t good enough to give him much to work with. I really liked the concept and what I think it wanted to be. It would have been great if it hit any of the marks it was aiming at.\n\nLulu Danger (Aubrey Plaza) is in a troubled marriage, but everything is about to change when a strange figure from her past re-emerges and a troubled loner takes a shine to her.\n\nJim Hosking (The Greasy Strangler) is an auteur of the grotesque. He’s like the offspring of the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! and Jared Hess. He’s evil Wes Anderson (with a dash of Harmony Korine). He’s like a candy-colored David Lynch SNL sketch. If any of that intrigues you, watch his stuff. But be warned. I have enjoyed some of his short films, but I do confess that his style can come off as a bit too willfully crass, disgusting, and repetitive for me. I do think he is doing everything that he sets out to do, and An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn (2018) boasts a fun cast (Aubrey Plaza, Jemaine Clement, Emil Hirsch, Matt Berry, and Craig Robinson), striking imagery, and a few laugh out loud bits. But I kinda step away from it all with a sense of “well, they certainly did a thing there, didn’t they?” Not my bag, I guess. Which is odd, because it feels like it should be.\n\nWell, I certainly wouldn’t have made a sequel to one of the most iconic, influential, and greatest horror films of all time, but Mike Flanagan (The Haunting of Hill House) would be one of the modern horror directors we’d trust to attempt it. Doctor Sleep (2019) is a sequel to The Shining, and it’s a pretty sleek and solid little flick with enough new stuff and good, heart-sinking Flanagan moments of terror. Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is all grown up and battling his demons by himself until he discovers a little girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran) with the same mysterious powers. Also there is a roving gang of soul-sucking vampires led by a tophat-wearing succubus (Rebecca Ferguson).\n\nThe push and pull between light and dark at the center of the film is excellent. A little girl’s destiny is in the balance and a lot of the heart of the story comes down to the choices Danny is willing to make. It doesn’t touch the Stanley Kubrick movie, but how could it? That’s really the only problem here. It feels a little too far away to be making a sequel now, and the nods to the original only remind us of a masterpiece. We got classic Stephen King imagery of your mind being a bunch of filing cabinets and a bit more astral projection and special effects, but I wish it didn’t feel the need to link itself to the 1980 film so much and just be it’s own standalone thing.\n\nDeadly Spawn (1983) cost $25,000 to make, which is $10,000 less than Basket Case (masterpiece). We love a good microbudget movie with vision that gets at least one thing really right. Directed by Douglas McKeown, the story concerns a young horror movie fan who has to face a toothsome extraterrestrial entity lurking in the basement. The movie is cheap and amateur, but the slimy puppets are great and that final shot is perfect.\n\nDelta Space Mission (1985) is a psychedelic science-fiction adventure from Romania. The style can be episodic and a bit amateurish (reminded me of the animations on old Sesame Street), and if you’re a fan of Fantastic Planet, Eastern European animation, or just real renegade art, it’s definitely worth a look. Maybe not my favorite animated sc-fi flick, but it’s got chutzpah.\n\nRalph Bakshi (audacious underground/adult animator) and Frank Frazetta (legendary pulp sci-fi illustrator) teamed up to make Fire and Ice (1983). The result was a super horny, very problematic, rotoscoped fantasy adventure that maybe doesn’t deliver narratively, but you gotta hand it to them: they know how to draw an ass.\n\nBakshi (Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic, Coonskin, American Pop, Cool World) is a filmmaker whose work I always admire and respect more than I enjoy. There are always things to like about his work, and his irreverence and audaciousness are truly inspirational. His films are always loud, messy, and real rough around the edges, but that’s sort of what we like about him, isn’t it? Fire and Ice is no exception, but it’s novelty lies in its attempt to realize a pulpy Frazetta fantasy world. The rotoscoping is pretty good, and they make the action more dynamic, but some of the troglodytic goon chases through the splashy, impressionistic backgrounds get a little repetitive. The characters (apart from the their designs and Susan Tyrrell’s voice) are not particularly interesting either. The plot is boring and, despite the limitless possibilities with animation, the world feels very limited and stagnant. Compared to any still painting done by Frazetta brimming with imagination and dynamic composition, this animated world feels very small and drab.\n\nYet I did like it. I’ll always admire Bakshi for trying things. It’s all barbarians and magic, but Fire and Ice is not like the more esoteric Wizards, and it’s not even really like his Lord of the Rings. It really does commit to the Frazetta-ness of everything, and at its best it can even feel reminiscent of Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal (although it doesn’t really come close to that masterpiece). There’s something just appealingly dirty and trashy about 80s fantasy, and if that grungy DIY aesthetic tickles your fancy, check out Bakshi’s Fire and Ice.\n\nTimothy Carey was a big, tall character actor with a powerful and insane energy. His performance in Kubrick’s Paths of Glory is a standout. The World’s Greatest Sinner (1962) is an oddball film he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in. He plays a disgruntled insurance salesman and atheist who believes he has had a profound revelation and becomes some sort of a rock-and-roll evangelist charlatan. He alienates himself from everybody as he rises to power and his egomania consumes him…until God shows up and kills him.\n\nCarey, whether he intended to or not, plays the main character like a drunk; slurring his words and leaning in too close to everybody. He looks like he smells. It’s a gross-feeling 60s low budget affair. I can’t quite determine if I liked it so much as I respected its unique, singular vision. For better or worse, you are in Carey’s brainspace for the duration of the picture. I also don’t know if Carey himself was religious or not, further complicating the ultimate message. Is it a subversive satire on humanity and society or is it just a weird, frustrated Chick Tract? I’m not sure, but either way I liked the Paul Frees narration.\n\nSteven Soderbergh’s The Informant! (2019) is a little film about Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), an employee at an agricultural corporation who becomes an FBI stool pigeon to take the company down. The problem? He’s a total dimwit who has actually been doing a lot of illegal shit himself the whole time. This is the kind of lowkey comedy that hits me just right. And I think Matt Damon doesn’t get enough credit for playing this type of character. He does comedy well and he plays a wide-eyed idiot superbly. Stop giving this man action and drama. He was born to play dumb.\n\nIt’s also got a who’s who of character actors in the cast from Melanie Lynsky and Scott Bakula to Tony Hale and Tom Smothers.\n\nEgosploitation movies are best when the ego behind the writing, directing, producing, starring, etc. are grade-A doofuses who have just the right combination of horniness, hubris, and embarrassing alpha-male insecurity. Meet Jack M. Sell, the broken mastermind behind Deadly Spygames (1989). Listen, you don’t care about the plot and I couldn’t explain it to you. If you like stuff like GetEven, Miami Connection, Twin Dragon Encounter, etc. do yourself a favor and watch Tippi Hedren pound her cinema legacy into the dirt.\n\nI’m a sucker for the apes. The 1968 original with Charlton Heston is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies. I like the sequels from the 70s, which are admittedly mostly bad. I can at least appreciate the makeup in the Tim Burton one. And I enjoyed the more recent Matt Reeves-helmed trilogy and was impressed that each film got better. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024) takes a standard hero’s journey plot and plugs it into the Apes universe, setting it several generations after the fall of humankind. Apes now have splintered into tribes and different cultures are developing in the post-apocalyptic world. The story might be a little more prosaic, but the apes look fantastic and it is a lot of fun. Like the previous three movies, I love the orangutan best. Raka (Peter Macon) rules.\n\nÁlex de la Iglesia (The last Circus) is a nasty and disturbing voice in cinema and Perdita Durango (1997) will make you feel like you need a shower afterward. Rosie Perez plays Perdita, a fiery outlaw who gets mixed up with Romeo (Javier Bardem), an amoral criminal who enjoys voodoo blood rituals and hauling fetuses across the Southwestern desert for cash. This movie is From Dusk Till Dawn on crack. And although it meanders a bit and lacks shape or satsifying arcs for its protagonists, it’s definitely an unforgettable experience (that needed more Rosie and Screamin’ Jay Hawkins). Bardem has made a living off playing big, scary dudes, but this might be his most terrifying performance ever. Also, James Gandolfini is in this.\n\nBruce Bickford’s Prometheus’ Garden (1988) is a hallucinatory claymation showcasing culture’s unyeilding tendency toward cycles of violence. It definitely captures the aesthetics of psychedelic drug use in a way that I’ve rarely seen. It’s mythical, hypnotic, and transfixing as only a surreal stop-motion short could deliver.\n\nGeorge Cukor’s The Women (1939) boasts a massive all-female cast (Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Mary Boland, Joan Fontaine, Lucille Watson, Marjorie Main, and more). It’s a catty, gossipy, tea-spilly melodrama jam-packed with more scandal and divorce than is perhaps typical of a Hays Code era flick. It also has a completely unrelated fashion show sequence shot in glorious Technicolor. As was tradition.\n\nWhile one might be tempted to think that a movie about women with zero men in it might be rather feminist and progressive, remember this is 1939. Temper your expectations accordingly. It’s got like 300 characters, all women, and still doesn’t pass the Bechdel test. Ultimately, the moral of the story is that love is complicated and sometimes you just gotta forgive your man for being a two-timing cad and a rake, and that maybe it’s your own damn fault he cheated on you and married another woman. Listen, you gotta give the movie props for being this cavalier about divorce and having this many dynamic and different female characters. It really does present a lot of different views and attitudes on romance, and the collisions of all the intersecting infidelity and backstabbery are undeniably fun. It’s a product of its time, but that’s kind of what makes it so special and unique.\n\nMy only real complaint with The Women would be the 2 hour 13 minute runtime. It’s also of that speed-talking style of dialogue that was in vogue at the time, making it hard to keep up with all the cheeky repartee. It’s definitely worth seeing, just for some of the fun drama and performances, as well as a glimpse into what was considered audacious back then.\n\nSusan Tyrrell is my queen. Ever since I saw her play the Queen of the Sixth Dimension in the Oingo Boingo movie, Forbidden Zone, she’s been it. Butcher Baker Nightmare Maker aka Night Warning (1982) is an exploitation slasher flick, but it’s got high melodrama, incest, forbidden gay love triangles, and gallons of milk. It’s funny too. Tyrrell is Cheryl Lynch, an overly protective aunt to Billy (Jimmy McNichol), who will do anything to keep him from going off to college and leaving her all alone. Bo Svenson is a gruff, bigoted detective and Marcia Lewis is the nosy neighbor with a heart of gold. The script is surprisingly progressive for the time and it boasts several twists we absolutely did not see coming. If nothing else, watch it for Susan Tyrrell’s unhinged performance. She’s like an evil Betty Boop, if that does anything for you.\n\nMusical biopics are played out and can be tedious. But what if you showed the birth of a whole musical movement from the point of view of a bit of a wanker? The great Steve Coogan portrays Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson in Michael Winterbottom’s 24 Hour Party People (2002), a daringly funny chronicling of the British punk scene. It’s a refreshing take on music history. While it lovingly recreates some iconic moments in punk, it plays them with a layer of humor without ever straying into parody (this is not Dewey Cox). Nobody plays this specific type of pathetic character better than Steve Coogan. He’s the best. A bleakly funny excursion into British music history.\n\nJust let George Miller do whatever weird thing he wants to. Whether it’s Babe: Pig in the City or Three Thousand Years of Longing, I just want to see all the wonderful worlds he and his teams cook up. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) – while not nearly as raw, rough, and high octane as Mad Max: Fury Road – is exactly what I expect to see when I go to a movie categorized as an action/adventure: cars and motorcycles exploding across a barren forever desert.\n\nAlyla Browne and Anya Taylor-Joy portray Imperator Furiosa (previously played by Charlize Theron), a kidnapped child forced to survive in a brutal post-apocalyptic hellscape. She spends years planning her escape and her revenge. The action is spectacularly choreographed and everything is grotesque and over-the-top (including Chris Hemsworth’s puddy nose) . It unfolds as a myth and we get a more in-depth look at how The Citadel (run by Immortan Joe and his warboys), Gastown, and the Bullet Farm fit into this crazy, sun-tortured world. It’s a lot of fun, but it does feel a bit more CGI-y than Fury Road. It’s brutal, but just a bit more clean and polished. And that greenscreeniness does deflate a lot of the danger. I’m sure a lot of the car stunts are real, but it just looks a bit more fake at times. The sky is a bit too perfect. The colors pop in an even more unnatural way. Oh, George, how you have spoiled us, and now we’re being nitpicky.\n\nIt’s worth it just for the world building (though I do prefer the sleeker, silent world building of Fury Road), bonkers action setpieces, and just to see Chris Hemsworth having a blast as a demented lunatic of the wasteland. I liked the History Man and Praetorian Jack too.\n\nMan, I gotta see Road Warrior again. It’s been too long.\n\nMartin Scorsese doesn’t get enough credit for comedy. While chiefly remembered as a sleek mobster crime drama, Goodfellas is a genuinely funny movie. After Hours (1985), however, is a straight comedy, although it may not feel like it. It’s the story of an office worker (Griffin Dunne) trying to get some tail out in NYC one night and having a hard time getting back home when it doesn’t work out. Like The Out-of-Towners, the humor comes from the increasingly ridiculous and frustrating complications that accumulate when trying to complete a seemingly simple task. The movie is also shot like a pschological horror film, and some of the turns are pretty dark. It sometimes feels like the first act of Beau Is Afraid. I’d seen After Hours a few times before, and it’s always a pleasure to return to it. It’s a solid grim comedy that showcases the seediness of New York at night and has a stacked cast of champs including Rosanna Arquette, Linda Fiorentino, Teri Garr, Catherine O’Hara, John Heard, Dick Miller, and Cheech & Chong.\n\nBilly Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard (1950) is a classic noir with hardboiled dialogue and is probably the best movie about Hollywood that Hollywood has ever made. William Holden is Joe, a broke and struggling screenwriter trying to eke out a living penning B-movies and finance men hot on his trail to repossess his car. Chance finds Joe stashing his wheels in an old, abandoned mansion…that turns out not to be so abandoned. It is the home of a delusional, aging movie star of the silent era, Norma Desmond (played hypnotically by Gloria Swanson). Desmond takes a shine to the writer and confines him to her crumbling palace.\n\nHonestly, it makes me hate other films that have tried to make the same thesis and failed. It touches upon so many seedy and weird things about Hollywood and movie culture so effortlessly, and all while essentially being one of those seedy and weird tales itself. Through this trashy melodrama of sex, murder, and madness, the effects of fame, the varying strata of stardom, and what happens when the starlight dims are all squarely in the spotlight where their flaws can no longer be hidden. The characters are all compelling (forgot to mention Nancy Olson as an aspiring screenwriter and especially Norma’s butler, Max, played by Austrian filmmaker Erich von Stroheim) and the dialogue crackles with irony and cheek. And we mustn’t forget the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography by John F. Seitz.\n\nIf you want a movie about how the limelight attracts its victims and slowly drains them, then watch Sunset Boulevard. Then maybe wash it down with David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive if you need more.\n\nEvery so often, film-folks on the internet share legendary interviews with director William Friedkin. He is a hilariously no-nonsense dude whose dismissive responses to questions he finds unworthy are legendary. I could listen to him talk about movies for hours. He also directed The Exorcist, The French Connection, and Sorcerer (1977), so he’s got the street cred for his “too world-weary for your bullshit” persona.\n\nBased on the Georges Arnaud novel, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Wages of Fear is a gritty 1953 thriller about four down-on-their-luck guys who have to drive big trucks full of highly explosive nitroglycerin through South American jungles to put out an oil fire. It’s a great film, but it doesn’t have a Tangerine Dream soundtrack.\n\nSorcerer is an even sweatier adaptation of the book. Starring Roy Scheider (Jaws), Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou, the movie plunges you into a cruel wilderness full of despicable men desperate to survive. It’s grim. It’s suspenseful. It’s so sweaty. It’s a methodical monster with hulking, unwieldy trucks making slow hairpin turns on muddy rainforest roads barely held together by rotting wood. In this jungle hell, perhaps our protagonists shall discover what it means to live. Sorcerer is a masterpiece and probably my favorite thing I’ve seen of Friedkin’s.\n\nAnd if you want a crappier version of this story, there’s always Vertical Limit from 2000.\n\nI love a good jungle movie and I loved Sorcerer, but Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo (1982) is one of my favorite films of all time. I re-watched it with some folks who had never seen it, and those fresh eyes really helped to underscore how insane of a cinematic undertaking this movie was. Watch this and then watch the documentary Burden of Dreams about the making of it. It was nuts, folks.\n\nLoosely inspired by true events, the story chronicles the mad ambitions of an Irish immigrant to Peru who loves the opera (played electrically by Klaus Kinski). And I don’t think you appreciate how much this guy loves the opera. He wants to build a grand opera house in the jungle. To raise funds for his project, he gets into the rubber business and, seeking to outflank the competition, hatches a cockamamie scheme to bypass a lengthy river by dragging a massive steamship over a mountain into the other river on the other side – a technical feat of engineering that would be daunting in any climate, let alone the Amazon. The movie spends a lot of time setting up the mad plot, but there are so many fun (and sweaty) characters punctuating each episode that it’s never boring. The movie keeps introducing new hitches and dilemmas and Kinski’s performance is so crazed (especially when subdued) that it’s no wonder the indigenous extras hated him and offered to kill him for Herzog. “It’s the jungle, bro. No one’s going to jail.”\n\nHerzog’s collaborations with Kinski were legendary and produced some true classics; Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Nosferatu the Vampire being among their most iconic. Fitzcarraldo, however, is the biggest, most sprawling, and most human of their collaborations, and, while not a comedy, it’s also probably their funniest.\n\nIs a wacky slapstick comedy titled Hundreds of Beavers (2023) actually better than Billy Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard, William Friedkin’s Sorcerer, and Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo? Well, probably no (I mean, obviously no. Definitely not), but I’m still in the afterglow of having seen something truly original and zany, and also would like to get more people to see this one. Perhaps I shall later come to my senses.\n\nOn an impressively minuscule budget of $150,000 and a crew in the single digits, Mike Cheslik and Ryland Brickson Cole Tews managed to produce one of the funniest and cartooniest action adventures in history. I was a big fan of their previous movie, Lake Michigan Monster ($7,000 budget), but Hundreds of Beavers is a pretty big step up in terms of sharpness, visual quality, and gag density. They figured out a couple things early on. If you shoot black-and-white and make it look old-timey, you can hide a lot of budget constraints while simultaneously garnering some cinematic legitimacy (looking at you, Guy Maddin). Additionally, you can sidestep realism while retaining verisimilitude if every aspect of the picture has a heightened artificiality (raising my glass to Karel Zeman). The last thing is sound. Stupendous sound design in this. Fun music too.\n\nThe thing about Lake Michigan Monster is that it’s pretty good and has some great jokes throughout, but the third act becomes a full-blown explosion of visual creativity. Hundreds of Beavers starts out at that level and only builds from there as it goes. And go it does. For almost two straight hours. Which, admittedly, can seem like a lot for something like this. I genuinely do think it’s a masterpiece, but a sleeker 90 minutes or less probably would sit better with the majority of audiences.\n\nLike the website says, this won’t be for everyone. But fans of silent comedy, Looney Tunes, and old school video games will undoubtedly enjoy this audaciously ambitious onslaught of inane cartoon logic and over-the-top extravaganza of insanity.\n\nRate this:\n\nCinema is dead probably. Look, I don’t know.\n\nI think YouTube or somewhere just played this one after we had watched another movie, and we let it. Deathmoon (1978) is a made-for-TV werewolf movie set in Hawaii. There’s not a whole lot to it, but the one novel aspect here is that it’s an anti-colonial curse.\n\nI really like Martin Short. Most of the time. Clifford (1994) is not one of those times. Short plays an old priest who tells the story of how he was an annoying little kid, and while it is amusing to see an obviously grown man pretending to be a child in a sea of adult actors who are going along with it, it’s way more unsettling and creepy than anything else. Clifford (the character) also veers between behaving like a small boy to behaving like a psychotically manipulative adult man. But maybe Clifford had to walk so MADtv’s Stuart could run.\n\nThe big pluses here are Charles Grodin (pulling a real Richard Dreyfuss in What About Bob? and managing to steal the show from a comedy icon by playing the straight man so well). The other big plus here is Dinosaur World. The whole movie Clifford wants to go to Dinosaur World, and, when they finally do, we get amazing matte paintings, elaborate whimsical sets, and impressive prehistoric animatronic monsters.\n\nUp and down, stem to stern, Anaconda (1997) is dumb. It’s a dumb movie. It’s one of those creature-features where the titular animal just wants to get you so bad. It will do anything to get you. It boasts some truly awful performances (Jennifer Lopez) and some truly bewildering performances (Jon Voight). It was hard for movies like this living in the shadow of Tremors and Jurassic Park.\n\nWe knew it would be bad (and probably much worse than we remembered it being from when we were kids), but it does have a few things going for it:\n\nAn actual animatronic giant snake (most of the time). This and Tobe Hooper’s Crocodile are terrible, but some of the last bastions of B-movie creature-features that have fun puppets on set. It adds weight and danger to what you’re looking at. If you’re a B-movie that only has weak CGI effects, don’t even waste my time.\n\nSome actual jungle locations and a cool boat. That’s nice. I like the boat.\n\nIce Cube. Say what you want, but he brings something grounding to this nonsense that really helps the whole thing go down smoother.\n\nAnd that’s what I’ll say. It’s dumb, but goes down smooth. One of the last classic watchable prestige B-pictures maybe. Well, that or Deep Blue Sea. But it is bad. I can’t in good conscience tell anyone to watch this.\n\nI really wanted to like Bruce Robinson’s How to Get Ahead in Advertising (1989). Robinson’s directorial debut (that also stars Richard E. Grant), Whitnail & I, is a boozy classic of British comedy. His next film was arguably more ambitious and zany, but it’s also rather grating.\n\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nA cynical ad executive grows a conscience…sort of. For a bit. Or at least he has a break with reality where feels he cannot, in good conscience, continue to peddle products that are probably bad. He goes from being mean and irritating to being mean and irritating. Then he grows, quite literally, a boil on his neck that sprouts a face and begins talking to him. This makes him mean and irritating. Eventually the boil – which is his more unscrupulous side – grows larger and more powerful, ultimately overtaking him and the ad exec ends up just a mean and irritating man. And that’s how you get a “head” in advertising.\n\nThe central theme is good, the Cronenbergian body horror is gross and inspired, and Richard E. Grant is throwing himself into this, but it’s all a bit just one note for me. And while I generally like a downer ending, this just felt unsatisfying. Like all that screaming and running around just for this? It’s worth checking out, and I’m sure a lot of folks out there will like it more than I did.\n\nI recalled liking Super Troopers. And I realized it’s the only Broken Lizard movie I’d ever seen. Sick on the couch and needing something brainless, I put on Club Dread (2004). It’s an early 2000s comedy that parodies the slasher genre. It’s got hot ladies and guys being dumb, as well as Bill Paxton as a washed-up Jimmy Buffet knockoff.\n\nIt’s not particularly cinematic. It’s not a good slasher flick. And it’s not that funny. However, it did grow on me. By the third act it actually starts to become pretty funny and gory. Why it didn’t lean into the humor and the horror before then is a bit of a mystery, perhaps the scariest mystery of all. It definitely needed more funny accents. Jay Chandrasekhar and Steve Lemme get to have some fun with their wacky characters. Share the love, ya know?\n\nA Private Function (1984) is a respectable British comedy about meat rationing in a small town during the postwar period. There’s an uptight inspector who is a stickler for the rules and an unlicensed pig being kept on a farm illegally for the political class. It’s all very dry and English, but it’s a veritable who’s who of legendary British actors. We got Dame Maggie Smith, Michael Palin, Denholm Elliott, Richard Griffiths, Bill Paterson, Jim Carter, Liz Smith, and Pete Postlethwaite all up in here.\n\nKen Russell tells the classic yarn of a cold and distant man who gets so obsessed with unraveling cosmic mysteries and touching God by doing shamanic drugs in a sensory deprivation tank to de-evolve himself into an early hominid, when the real meaning for living was the woman who loves you and has been there all along. We just gotta ignore the people he killed.\n\nAltered States (1980) is a bit of a mess, and the mechanics of what is literally happening in the universe of the movie are…silly. They’re very silly. It fastforwards through time like it’s nothing, so we never really get to sit with the characters for very long, and when we do they’re not very compelling. The movie is nuts. It has great visuals and wild psychedelic trip sequences. It’s got William Hurt, Blair Brown, Bob Balaban. The real star? Charles Haid as a foul-mouthed Southern scientist who absolutely has no time for any of your shit.\n\nAs you are well aware, Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic about the man who made the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer (2023) won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Score, Best Editing and Best Cinematography. It was pretty decent.\n\nYou ever watch a movie and think to yourself, “Gosh. I just don’t know if I’m Czech enough for this”?Vojtěch Jasný’s Cassandra Cat (1963) (aka When the Cat Comes, The Cat Who Wore Sunglasses, One Day a Cat, The Cat) is weird, even by Czech New Wave standards.\n\nA small town (with a few characters that have different views on society and what is best for human flourishing) gets visited by a traveling circus. The circus features a cat. The cat wears sunglasses. If the sunglasses are removed, anyone it looks at will change colors to reveal their true inner self.\n\nI’ll come clean and say a lot of the metaphors were lost on me, which I atribute to having not grown up in Soviet-controlled postwar Czechoslovakia. However, narrative enigmas aside, I enjoyed the fairytale feel and the look of it. I loved the magic show sequence, fourth-wall breaking, the textured imagery, unpredictable chaos, the colors, and the performance Oliva/the Magician (Jan Werich). I really just don’t know what to make of it.\n\nBrian Trenchard-Smith is my favorite Trailers from Hell guy. He’s always so eloquent and proper, regal even. He’s always wearing Hawaiian shirts. And I don’t even really like any of his movies. That is, until we saw Dead End Drive-In (1986), an Australian post-apocalyptic grunge fest (is there another kind?). It’s general chaos and lawlessness out there, but if you can make it to a movie, you might just get away from it all…until you realize you can never leave. It’s essentially a prison that the government feeds drugs and junk food to in order to reign in and contain some of that violent youthful rebelliousness. It’s grimy and punk and it actually has some things to say. It’s also got a really nice car stunt at the end.\n\nAdam Rifkin’s The Dark Backward (1991) is one weird, gross, messed up kind of movie that will forever be remembered, for me at least, as the most accurate depiction of entry level standup comedy and the movie that has Bill Paxton fondle and lick the corpse of a woman he finds in the garbage at the dump.\n\nMore Ken Russell! Twiggy stars in The Boy Friend (1971), a comedy about all the drama onstage and behind the scenes of a lavish stage production, and Russell’s tribute to Busby Berkeley musicals. It’s a sweeter, more tame film than Tommy or Liszomania, but apparently he did this right after The Devils (my personal favorite) to prove he wasn’t just some insane deviant. It’s very breezy and stylish. Each musical setpiece does something new and exciting. Welcome style over substance.\n\nWriter/director/producer/astrologer/star Craig Denney set out to make a name for himself in The Astrologer (1976), an incomprehensible pile of dogshit that is absolutely worth your time. We laughed a lot, just don’t ask us to recount the plot. Don’t even ask Craig Denney. You can’t. He died right after the movie came out. Or, perhaps more plausibly, as many claim, he faked his own death for reasons that will forever remain a mystery.\n\nIf you love it when a movie looks like it smells bad, you’ll love The Astrologer, not to be confused with The Astrologer (1975) which we accidentally watched a few lists back thinking it was this one. See? I told you I’d get to it.\n\nJohn Cassavetes’ Husbands (1970) can be a bit too meandering, improvised, and long at times, but at the end of the day, it’s a fairly unflinching portrait of a particular type of man, one that has perhaps evolved over time but exists nevertheless.\n\nJohn Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, and Peter Falk are MEN. They don’t cry! They get drunk and throw up! They’re rude to people! They beat their wives! They have repressed emotions! They are deeply insecure and afraid! They have intimacy issues! They can barely admit to themselves that they love each other! MEN!\n\nE. Elias Merhige’s Shadow of the Vampire (2000) is a criminally underseen gothic horror about the making of the infamous 1922 Nosferatu. It posits an alternative cinema history wherein legendary German director, F.W. Murnau (played here by John Malkovich), so intent on realism for his vampire movie, secretly hires a real vampire (played by Willem Dafoe absolutely chewing up every scene and clearly having a blast being weird and creepy). If you’re a Nosferatu fan (either the original 1922 Murnau version or the 1979 Werner Herzog version, or are just excited for the upcoming Robert Eggers one – that will also feature Dafoe, but as a vampire hunter), then you gotta check out this underrated oddity. I love it when a film recognizes the only way to sell its zany premise is let the weirdness have a layer of grim humor.\n\nThe movie itself is good, if a little cartoony (and Udo Kier and Eddie Izzard are fun additions to the cast), but the real reason to watch it is for Willem Dafoe’s unabashedly kooky performance as the bloodsucking immortal posing as obscure actor Max Schreck. I daresay Dafoe is even more captivating and fun to watch than the real Schreck and even Klaus Kinski. He really is one of the best actors working today, and I respect the hell out of him for taking weird roles like this.\n\nHarrison Ford’s innate charisma extends to a cop drama that morphs into a steamy Amish romance in Peter Weir’s Witness (1985). I had forgotten that it’s not really an action movie. Kid me remembered the intense ending, but adult me was digging all the sexual tension between Ford’s wounded cop and Kell McGillis’s thirsty Amish widower. Like a lot of folks, this was my introduction to Amish culture, and, while it’s pretty surface level (I mean we really only have this, Kingpin, and For Richer or Poorer), it highlights their pacifism and plain living. It’s a pretty solid drama with an absolutely terrible soundtrack.\n\nRewatched this banger, and The Fifth Element (1997) is still so breezily fun and good that it only rubs it in further that Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets isn’t. Luc Besson’s filmography is filled with arresting visual flair that is also unmistakably French. Like how you don’t get that feeling watching a Terry Gilliam film. Like how when you’re watching Alien Resurrection and someone says, “hey, you know the director is the Amélie guy”, and you’re like, “oh, well, now THAT explains a lot of what I’m seeing.”\n\nAnyway, the thing I’ve always loved about The Fifth Element was that, horny sci-fi hijinks aside, it’s just so odd. And silly. It’s having fun being silly at you. And it dishes out it’s silliness and its cavalcade of silly characters in carefully planned installments. The costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier really help define the movie’s unique tone. And you gotta love a montage of an interstellar cruiseship readying for takeoff intercut with Chris Tucker banging a stewardess set to space reggae. The French, man.\n\nNot that it’s saying much, but this is Milla Jovovich’s best movie, and Bruce Willis was always at his best when allowed to showcase his sense of humor. The whole cast is great. Don’t make me name them all. It’s a who’s who of supporting greats.\n\nWilliam Peter Blatty is most famous for writing the novel and screenplay of The Exorcist. He only directed two movies. The Exorcist III, which I loved, and The Ninth Configuration (1980), a truly beguilingly dark yet comic film about trauma and faith.\n\nA laconic marine psychaitrist (Stacy Keach) goes to a mysterious castle asylum in the foggy northwestern woods. It is a dysfunctional place populated by brilliant men who have all gone mad from the war. One patient (Scott Wilson), however, isn’t a soldier at all. He’s an astronaut that had a psychotic break moments before takeoff and had to be dragged from the rocket ship. From there we embark on a spiritual journey in and out of madness and reality, and confront the duplicitous duality of man: the good and evil that lurks within us all.\n\nThe setting is great. The cast is great (love me some Ed Flanders). It has a great bar fight. It’s a weird sort of movie that really doesn’t get made anymore. At least, not like this. It’s a hypnotic mystery that unravels very slowly, and it is steeped in some serious post Vietnam anti-war sentiment. This all adds to the flavor. Now, Blatty’s worldview might be a bit too inaccessibly Catholic for me at times, but he uses his religious framework to intelligently get at deeper truths about the human condition…or at least truths we all hope are true. I do think The Exorcist III is a lot more polished and relateable, but this is a worthwhile curio.\n\nAnd you know something? I even like Stacy Keach without a mustache.\n\nI liked Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part 2 (2024) a good deal better than the first one, although there were things in the first one I did really like. Villeneuve’s team can create some striking images and manufacture the feeling of immense scale, but there’s just something about Timothée Chalamet that really takes me out of things. Even more than Christopher Walken did for a lot of people in this. But hey, I’m mostly watching these things for Stellan Skarsgård, Javier Bardem, and Charlotte Rampling. Zendaya doing some good stuff in here too. If you can get into the slow pace and get sucked into the scope of the world building, there’s a lot to appreciate.\n\nThe Full Monty (1997) is a just a prime example of an efficient comedy executed well. Aided by a smart, funny script and a terrific cast (Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Barber), it hits every mark it sets out to hit. Six desperate and unemployed Sheffield steel workers come together to put on a striptease show in order to make enough money to solve their problems. Simple set up and pay off with just the right stakes, jabs at masculine insecurities, and hiccups along the way to make for a very enjoyable 90 minutes.\n\nR.I.P. Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom, Michael Clayton, Batman Begins, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Full Monty)\n\nPowell and Pressburger are glorious movie gods and A Matter of Life and Death (1946) proves it. So does The Red Shoes. And Black Narcissus. And The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. And if I cheat and sneak in The Thief of Bagdad, that too.\n\nA British airman (David Niven) gets shot down during WWII and his afterlife escort (Marius Goring) can’t find his soul in the thick English fog to ferry him to the next world. This causes problems upstairs. To make matters even more complicated, the airman has fallen in love! Now he’ll have to fight for his right to live in the high courts of the otherworld. Or maybe it’s all in his head.\n\nAs much as I may not buy the oh-so-crucial romance between David Niven and Kim Hunter (I dislike it, in fact), and as much as I find it weird that the survival of their relationship depends on a successful lobotomy (don’t enjoy that), I absolutely love the audacious look of this thing, the weird bureaucratic mechanics of the afterlife, Roger Livesey and Raymond Massey are great, and I LOVE the trial in the final act.\n\nThere’s something magical and refreshing about the progressive optimism embodied by certain films of this era that we’ve really lost as we’ve all become more cynical and jaded. I miss stories that believed in something real and hopeful and had the temerity to back it up. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington comes to mind, among others. It’s the difference in flavor between patriotism and jingoistic nationalism, I think. These films are patriotic. And they actually taste good for it.\n\nTo me, what makes A Matter of Life and Death work is not that the court case is about proving the love between a death-dodging Englishman and a woman from Boston; it’s that the trial puts modern (for the 40s) American culture on trial. It dares to challenge America’s angrier revolutionary past, and demands that it face how the very things it claimed to believe in all came true, and in ways that are better than it could have imagined (and in ways it cannot recognize or even really approve of). Sure, it sidesteps a slew of historical evils, but it does at least rub England’s face in its own stodgy history of imperialism and murder. Watching it now, I lament, because it seems that, for a time, we were maybe getting on the right path, albeit in fits and starts and with plenty of maturing still to do. But there was hope, and reason to hope, dammit.\n\nWatch this one. It’s a unique film that’s been copied enough by now. Fits nicely alongside films like The Devil and Daniel Webster, Heaven Can Wait, Defending Your Life, Wings of Desire, and maybe even Beetlejuice.\n\nWhat an absolute treat The Holdovers (2023) is. Directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Nebraska) and starring Paul Giamatti (in one of his best roles since Payne’s Sideways), Dominic Sessa, and Da’Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is My Name), the story concerns three lonely creatures stuck at a private high school over the Christmas break. This is a great example of an excellent script, stellar cast (and their chemistry), and rich locations and setting really elevating a simple premise and making it something special. The 70s aesthetic also gives it a lot of extra juice. It just looks so good. It pulls you into its cozy, misanthropic world and just lets a sweet dusting of snow settle on you while it makes you some hot tea with lemon. Highly recommend if you haven’t seen it yet.\n\nOK, Craig Denney was a curiosity for making The Astrologer. Shuny Bee is a legend for making Fight of Fury (2020). Once again, Bee is the writer/director/producer/editor/stunt coordinator/star. That’s exactly what you want for this kind of thing. I shan’t say too much, other than I absolutely loved it and cannot wait for the sequel.\n\nIshirō Honda’s original Godzilla (1954) remains a classic, and one of the best movies about the atomic bomb (sorry, Oppenheimer). The hand puppet closeups are little goofy, but the destruction is still visceral and shocking. And there’s just something extra haunting about Godzilla in black-and-white.\n\nThis movie frightened me as a kid (although the version I saw then had a disconnected Perry Mason spliced into it) because unlike Frankenstein or King Kong, which I loved, there was no identifying or humanizing with the monster. Godzilla was just a bastard. It was just a mindless force of destruction oblivious to the wanton carnage it wrought. Some of the scenes are still effectively frightening 70 years later.\n\nIt’s easy to take for granted Godzilla’s status in monster movie history. For the remainder of the Shōwa era of Godzilla, the movies get increasingly campy, silly, and geared toward children. There are a few bright spots (Mothra, I love you), but none of them try to be horror like the initial outing. The Heisei, Millennium, and Reiwa eras all kind of have their own vibe. But that first movie remains something unique and startling. Perhaps because it was less than a decade after the bombs were dropped. Perhaps because it was the first time cinema had seen a monster that large and unstoppable. 33 Japanese films later, the lizard stomps on.\n\nRate this:\n\nI’ll be the first to admit it: movies are subjective. It’s one of the few times you can legally say nobody’s opinion matters but yours. So if you hate what I have to say about the following movies, you are 100% right.\n\nThe first C.H.U.D., however low-brow a B-movie it may be, actually had C.H.U.D.s (cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers) in it and had real stakes, wet puppets, Daniel Stern, and a surprisingly compassionate look at homelessness.\n\nC.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D. (1989) strips the schlocky horror away to morph into a corny comedy about zombies that don’t even eat people. And the comedy, hoo boy, seems to have been calibrated to be the antithesis of everything I personally find funny. Opportunity after opportunity to be funny or scary or interesting just gets completely biffed in unyielding succession. It’s like a baby movie, but full of dead people and one F-bomb. I guess this one is for die-hard Gerrit Graham stans.\n\nIf the movie had drifted from its obnoxiously goofy tone for a second to let the characters actually grapple with the concept of death as it lay before them in all its absurdity and let the faintest flicker of horror enter, it might have salvaged a small portion of whatever this is. I have never encountered a film more incurious about what it means to be human.\n\nThere is a part in the theme song where they say “Bud the C.H.U.D.” I kinda liked that.\n\nWes Craven has made a lot of super iconic horror movies and The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is not one of them. Is the dubious presentation of Haitian voodoo? Is it the Bill Pullman of it all? Is it the general amorphousness of the plot and yucky sex scene with Cathy Tyson who frankly deserved better? There’s potential here. We got classic voodoo zombies. Sort of. It doesn’t really commit to that. Apart from a few cool dream sequences and some creepy imagery in the last five minutes, it’s mostly a dud. Unless Bill Pullman has some sort of hold over you.\n\nThe onyl real question most folks have surrounding the 5th Indiana Jones movie is: is it at least better than the 4th? That’s the starting point. And it’s not. Not really. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) has our hero dealing with age, which is appropriate and worth exploring. I’ll always love Harrison Ford and those first three movies, but everything about Dial of Destiny just looks like a videogame. This series can be silly, but it needs grit. Modern Hollywood blockbusters (especially from Disney) kind of all look the same, don’t they? Everything is weightless, cartoony, airbrushed, and ugly. There’s that glossy, overly color-corrected, hyper-CG, fakey-fake sheen to everything. Good movies with strong visuals and unique perspectives are still being made these days, but not at Disney. And you just know you won’t see anything good that cost $300 million. That pricetag usually means too many risk-averse, non-creative studio boys got their box-ticking fingerprints all over it.\n\nSpoiler alert: the ending does feature a fun concept (perhaps inspired by the classic Twilight Zone episode: The Odyssey of Flight 33), but it’s all too short and too late. I found myself asking, why not make the whole movie more like this? Ah well. Nostalgia is brain poison.\n\nSam Raimi (Army of Darkness, Darkman, Spider-Man) brings an extremely cartoony sensibility to a dreadfully miscast Sharon Stone-led western, The Quick and the Dead (1995). I can appreciate some of Raimi’s zany directorial flourishes here in this tonally goofy cowboy pastiche. Weird how serious most of the cast takes it when it’s filmed like an SNL spoof on Sergio Leone. The main problems for me are the shapeless script, boring cardboard characters, and complete lack of any tension (an impressive feat considering the whole movie is a series of shootouts between different guys). Gene Hackman is the only one bringing anything (young Leo too, I’ll add). It just don’t live up to its simple setup.\n\nIt was hard making a solid western during this time, and I like that people were still trying to make them. But Back to the Future III is a better western than The Quick and the Dead. I dunno man. Pop in Silverado if you want a lightweight throwback to classic cowboy movies.\n\nBrainstorm (1983), directed by Douglas Trumbull (Silent Running), is an…interesting sci-fi thriller. Some bold filming techniques and a solid look, but it takes more than half the runtime to get to the only real plot beat (which is launched by Louise Fletcher using some sci-fi contraption to record her death in VR as she is having a heart attack). Christopher Walken is losing control of his project, which is being commandeered and mass produced to hurt people for some reason, but he desperately wants to see that video. And, hey. I get that.\n\nWanting to find out what is recorded on VR when you die is such a cool sci-fi premise. And Brainstorm must know there’s no way that reveal (if revealed) could ever live up to the hype. Oh, you’re just gonna casually drop on your audience the pscyhedelic visions your brain produces as your soul leaves your body? You really gonna nail that in a satsifactory way? It’s all rather muddled, clunky, and the themes feel undercooked. The special effects are neat, but what they ultimately reveal is kind of cheesy. The movie has an awesome question, but doesn’t really provide a satisfying answer or show its math. Show me your work, cowards!\n\nThe legendary Godzilla director, Ishirō Honda, moves the plot into the distant future and throws as many kaiju as he can at the screen in Destroy All Monsters (1968). Shootin’ straight here: I love Godzilla (or perhaps I merely love the idea of Godzilla?), but I was never a big fan of the plots with aliens and outer space. Giant monsters on Earth are awesome. Don’t trivialize them with the addition of undercooked cosmic cultures. I also never liked the kidsier, goofy movies where Godzilla is essentially a good guy. I like Godzilla to be a bit of a bastard. One more beef: don’t tease Mothra and not let her metamorphosize. It’s maybe a forgettable entry in the series (even with all those monsters), but they do all gang up on King Ghidorah for one scene. That’s cool.\n\nMike Hodges’ Black Rainbow (1989) has a great name. Say it. “Black Rainbow“. Chills. Rosanna Arquette stars as a woman who travels from church to church peddling her skeptic father’s (Jason Robards) grift. They present her as a prophet who can see the future. It’s actually all just cold readings and chicanery, BUT… plot twist: maybe she’s actually psychic?! There are faster and more compelling ways to get to most of the important beats in this film, but I wasn’t upset. I just know I won’t remember much about it in 10 seconds.\n\nAnna May Wong (The Thief of Bagdad, Toll of the Sea, Shanghai Express) was the first Chinese-American actress, and Hollywood pretty much never gave her the respect she deserved. Daughter of the Dragon (1931) is one of the Fu Manchu sequels. Warner Oland, a Swedish-American actor who was inexplicably almost exclusively cast as Chinese, is the fiendish yellow menace: the evil Fu Manchu! It’s all incredibly racist. And he’s kind of a boring Fu. I liked Boris Karloff in the role better. But this Fu Manchu is dying maybe. So he is passing the torch to his daughter (Anna May Wong). She reportedly hated this type of dragon lady role, but she took what she could. The only other draw here is maybe Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa as a detective (to prove the movie isn’t racist because they got one positive Asian character), but sadly he’s not in it much and the movie is clearly uncomfortable with his heavy accent.\n\nElvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988) exists in the same universe as Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure. It’s not as well-oiled a machine. The jokes are mostly not funny, but they’re that familiar flavor of cheesy one-liner that corny horror movie hosts do. Which makes sense considering that’s Elvira’s origin story. Cassandra Peterson is charismatic and fun and, blasphemous as it may be, I believe funnier and more interesting than her Elvira character. It’s a vibe. And it’s got loads of cleavage for weird horndogs trapped in the 80s. Listen, you can enjoy this, but don’t do it so much we get a Svengoolie movie.\n\nRat (1998) is a simple documentary that is less actual information about rats and more cheeky pastiche of surly New Yorkers re-enacting their dramatic encounters.\n\nI liked the Harmontown podcast, so, naturally, I had to see Harmontown (2014). All’s I’ma say is: I love Spencer. I love Jeff. I enjoy Dan. I want to be their friends. How come Rob Schrab wasn’t in this?!?\n\nI hate clowns, an the Chiodo Brothers made them the scariest they’ve ever been. Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). Clearly made by special effects and prop guys (who absolutely BRING IT with the creative designs). It’s a bare bones B-movie plot with some uninteresting characters, but the rubbery, grotesque masks and puppetry are definitely worth it. The clowns themselves, and everything about their culture, is profoundly upsetting to me. And that’s what the movie wanted to do. Fun theme song too!\n\nThe appeal of the Shōwa era is its breezy silliness (1954 film excluded). Godzilla morphs from a near indestructible force of mindless destruction into being a benevolent savior to mankind. Godzilla vs Hedorah (1971) is more overtly environmental than other Godzillas. It’s still geared toward children, but Hedorah is a more unique monster than most (a walking – sometimes flying – mountain of sludge, born of human pollution). I’m a sucker for Mothra and Biollante, and Hedorah fits nicely alongside them as some of my favorite Godzilla foils.\n\nPlus, this movie is uncharacteristically funky. Love the animated interludes, that groovy intro, and swinging 70s musical number.\n\nTerror Train (1980). A teen slasher flick on a novelty train? Also magician David Copperfield (now on the Epstein list!) bein’ his creepy self in a weirdly large role? Jamie Lee Curtis?? Finally. A decent New Year’s Eve horror movie. It’s schlocky and silly, but we dug it.\n\nI saw Pixar’s Elemental (2023). Wow they mis-marketed this one. Legitimately pretty solid. Creative, clever, heartfelt, and gorgeously animated. Are we running out of metaphors for prejudice? Who knows, but it’s still an important message to be putting out into the world. Seriously, though. The animation is mesmerizing. I want to live in the Elemental city.\n\nAdmittedly, I have a hard time with a lot of westerns of a certain era. Specifically this one. There are a few gems in there, but it’s not my genre. And I am at peace with that.\n\nThat said, Joan Crawford is fantastic in Johnny Guitar (1954). Intimidating even in the brightest colored cowboy blouses you ever did see. Good tension and climax.\n\nThis one hard to score. It’s Adult Swim Yule Log aka The Fireplace (2022), directed by Casper Kelly (Too Many Cooks)! It’s if Adult Swim did a yule log thing. That’s all you gotta know. No spoilers. Just love. It was a delight and a surprise.\n\nGodzilla has been many things over the years: a metaphor for atomic bombs, a metaphor for natural disasters, but he’s never been a metaphor for survivor’s guilt. Godzilla Minus One (2023) is just a straight, honest monster movie with the right amounts of melodramatic cheese o keep it going when the monster is not decimating cities. This might be the scariest Godzilla has ever been. I may be partial to the weirdness of Shin Godzilla, but this was a refreshing return to normalcy. The postwar setting really helps sell it and make it feel new again.\n\nNot something you’d expect maybe, but my favorite thing in Godzilla this time was the tugboats. And the scientist guy: a real grade-A cutie.\n\nApparently, I’m not Dutch enough to, say, “get it”. Just like the Dutch. Always guarding their weird little Dutchisms. Anyway, I dug the hell out of Alex van Warmerdam’s Borgman (2013). It’s sort of like a slowburn home invasion movie. Weird little guy insinuates himself into a normal family’s lives and turns things upside-down (we talked about this before when I couldn’t shut up about The Shout). Although decidedly darker than your average What About Bob?, sucks you in with its macabre sense of humor and casual dream-logic. Big fan of Jan Bijvoet (Embrace of the Serpent) as the mysterious vagrant.\n\nI’ll tell you one thing: would not let that little freak into my home.\n\nFollowing an accidental murder, a woman flees to a tropical island in Safe in Hell (1931). Whirlwind opening, kinda slow and sweaty middle, and surprisingly tragic ending. Really well filmed and Dorothy Mackaill is great. I love me some pre-Code sleaze.\n\nIn an age of airbrushed supermodel actors, it’s kind of refreshing to see a movie where everyone is old, bloated, in visible pain, and just looks like shit. Martin Scorsese hasn’t really made a bad movie, in my opinion. Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) is about a lot of things, but perhaps the most glaring is the insidiousness and banality of evil and how fools often play a bigger part than they are capable of recognizing.\n\nI could compare this thematically to There Will Be Blood (which, as an exploration of the vile tycoons that stole the west, is a bit more my jam). I could quietly wish we had gotten a version of this story through more of an Osage lens. It will always be a little hard for white people to tell Native stories. And that’s kind of the indictment the movie levels at itself with its finale. But Scorsese has always been great at telling stories from the point of view of the villains. So we get the story of the murder of the Osage people through the eyes of the men responsible for it, both directly and complicitly.\n\nIt’s a grim portrait of “how the west was won”, but an important one to remember. And to remember that this shit is still going on today in the USA, Canada, Brazil, Isael, Saudi Arabia, and a million other places. So what do we do? We could probably stop killing indigenous people and taking their land. Ah, but then the worst people in the world wouldn’t keep getting richer. Surely, we could never allow that. The greedy wheels of global capitalism must continue to turn.\n\nNeed a down and dirty slasher flick for the holidays? Bob Clark’s Black Christmas (1974) has you covered. Creepy and Canadian. You will feel a shiver down your spine every time the phone rings. Absolutely obsessed with all the insane 70s sweater patterns, wallpaper, curtains, etc. Now is it technically better than Scorsese’s most recent and arguably more important film? I mean, probably not. No accounting for taste, I guess. I just know I’m more likely to watch this again someday.\n\nEvery time I catch a Federico Fellini film, I think, “Damn. I gotta see more of this guy.” Staunchly European, And the Ship Sails On (1983) collects a group of wealthy, eccentric characters and chucks them onto a huge ocean liner in 1914. What follows is a meandering series of vignettes loaded with playful wit, social commentary, and opera. Watching this, I couldn’t help but feel like Stanley Tucci was somewhat inspired by it for his own underseen cruiseship screwball comedy, The Impostors.\n\nWell, this one holds up pretty well. Almost directed by Re-Animator guy Stuart Gordon, Joe Johnston’s first directorial outing is a hot blast of tiny danger. It’s Disney’s Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989). I must have seen this a dozen times as a kid. Honestly, it’s kind of a brilliant idea. Renegade attic scientist (Rick Moranis at possibly his most loveable) invents a device that accidentally shrinks 4 kids who then have to trek across the backyard and try to get their parents’ attention. And, in the end, it’s all about making peace and becoming friends with the neighbors you never really gave the time to before. What this movie doesn’t get enough credit for is how gross it makes everything when you’re tiny. Floors? Cracky, dusty, strewn with rusted screws and miscellaneous detritus. Water? Dirty, dangerous, viscous, slimy, and will 1000% kill you. Bugs? Giant, throbbing units of alien muscle encased in hairy, damp exoskeletons. Grass? Jagged, wet, and covered in gross, prickly hairs. Insane that this movie launched a full-blown franchise – complete with two sequels (Honey, I Blew Up the Kid and Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves), a live-action TV series, and a theme park 4D ride (Honey, I Shrunk the Audience). It’s also just nice to see Matt Frewer (Max Headroom himself) in anything.\n\nGreat opening animation sequence reminiscent of Ren & Stimpy. They don’t do that anymore. And amazing practical effects (giant sets, puppets, stop-motion, forced perspectives, etc.). And all set to a manic score by James Horner aping Danny Elfman and jazzifying Raymond Scott’s Powerhouse (a Looney Tunes industrial staple cue thanks to Carl Stalling). I can’t imagine how awesome this must have been to see in theaters in 1989 with the first standalone Roger Rabbit short produced by Steven Spielberg, Tummy Trouble. Disney used to be way edgier. One more fun fact: this movie was filmed entirely in Mexico City, and you’d never know it.\n\n*Bonus points for girlfriend and I sharing possibly the nerdiest, nichiest jinx of all time when we both read Brian Yuzna’s name in the opening credits out loud and with equal measures of delight and incredulity.\n\nIf I were a demon, I would be so scared of George C. Scott yelling at me. William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist III (1990) is a chillingly cold and clinical police procedural featuring a depressed and cranky George C. Scott as an investigator who believes in nothing, and what may just be a demonic entity wreaking bloody havoc in a hospital. Blatty, author of The Exorcist, only directed two movies, and what a shame that is. I love the blunt yet artistic look of this film. It’s scary mostly in its emptiness. It shows very little, but it alludes to much. George gives a great performance, but Brad Dourif is having a blast chewing scenery as a damned soul sent to torment.\n\nHayao Miyazaki’s final film (for like the 4th time) is The Boy and the Heron (2023), a gloriously weird and magestically animated fantasy about a young boy coming to terms with grief and loss. This thing is overflowing with wonderfully imaginative imagery, and seemingly all guided by a mature and inquisitive hand. I love Miyazaki’s worlds. They operate on a logic just to the left of Wonderland. It’s a weirder world than we’re familiar with, and it’s always magical in a refreshingly original way. The Boy and the Heron has my favorite kind of Miyazaki magic. That kind of magic you find in My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke. The kind of undefined nature magic that lends more to feelings than to reason. It’s a gentle, righteous, and mystical magic that is governed by a kind of moral order. I liked being in that world, even if I didn’t fully understand it.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’ most recent film is Poor Things (2023), and it is very much my candy. I’m biased toward whimsy. Call it a weakness. You can’t hurt me. As strikingly beautiful and it is odd, it tells the story of Bella Baxter (played wonderfully by Emma Stone), a woman with the literal brain of a child coming of age in a world governed by the greedy whims of selfish and/or misguided men. It’s got mad science, sexual liberation, steampunk nonsense, and a hilarious performance by Mark Ruffalo. It’s also got amazing sound/music and Willem Dafoe. All the quirks of The Lobster and The Favourite are dialed up to 11. If that’s your jam, then perhaps we are indeed kindred spirits. The book, by Alasdair Gray, is also quite good. I loved it, but obviously, this won’t be for everyone, but then that is the name of this place.\n\nIt’s always exciting revisiting a classic. I had some memory of seeing this very long historical drama as a kid and being sucked into it. And it is a classic for a reason.\n\nArguably Miloš Forman’s grandest spectacle, easily Tom Hulce’s best performance, and F. Murray Abraham as one of the all time great movie villains, it’s Amadeus (1984)! The fictionalized biopic about Mozart from the point of view of a jealous rival composer has a great script by Peter Shaffer, but the oppulent production design (Karel Černý) and flamboyant costumes (Theodor Pištěk and Christian Thuri) are simply fantastic and wonderfully immersive. John Strauss coordinates the music as well, and it’s appropriately pretty much wall to wall Mozart bangers. Admittedly, I’m a sucker for stories that touch upon the messy complexities of faith and human frailty. Salieri (Abraham) believes he wants to be great to glorify his Creator, but he is inwardly cowed to discover his deepest desires and grandest ambitions were always only ever about himself. Stuffing those shameful revelations down, Salieri syphons all his jealousy into ruining Mozart, the basis for his ire. Salieri’s mania is always presented as relatable and understandable, even if his tactics are far from justifiable. It may not be historically accurate, but it is accurate to the human experience, which can sometimes make for a more enjoyable and piercing work.\n\nRate this:\n\nMovies movies movies. I’m not addicted. YOU’RE addicted.\n\nChuck Vincent’s Warrior Queen (1987) stars Sybil Danning as a noblewoman in ancient Pompeii wandering from one curtains and balsa wood set to another until Vesuvius erupts. What could have been (and should have been) a Titanic-esque ticking time bomb of Roman intrigue and feminism-tinged political drama building until historical inevitability, ultimately sidesteps all this potential for more lascivious ambitions. What’s a handier Deus ex machina than a volcano erupting? Give us tension. Give us prophecy. Instead, the film just sort drifts shapelessly between gratuitous rape scenes and pilfered footage from other movies. Also stars an especially yucky Donald Pleasence.\n\n🎃 A crazed cartoonist unleashes true evil when it turns out his inked artwork brings ghouls to life! It’s a premise that’s been done, but, as a cartoonist myself, it’s one I can get behind. Cellar Dweller (1987) squanders its concept, in part, by killing off reliable horror mainstay Jeffrey Combs in the first two minutes and leaving us with the much less engaging or likeable Debrah Farentino as the new plucky cartoonist. The monster is rather lazy and doesn’t do much beyond nonchalantly chewing. The art school setting could have been nice (Munsters star Yvonne De Carlo plays the cartoon-hating Mrs. Briggs, who runs the retreat). Alas, a mostly boring and witless nothing of a flick, but the fiery finale was so silly and incomprehensible that it became pretty funny.\n\nLeslie Nielsen’s entire career trajectory changed after 1980’s Airplane. The serious actor had amazing comedy chops. The Naked Gun series, would be his highlights. After that, you get weaker flicks like Wrongfully Accused, Dracula: Dead and Loving It, and Spy Hard (1996). I watched all these on TV as a kid because Leslie Nielsen’s deadpan idiot character was funny, even if the movies weren’t great. Spy Hard has a lot of gags, and maybe 10% of them work (and most of that is owed to Weird Al Yankovic’s Bond-style song at the start of the movie). I can handle bad jokes you can see coming a mile away and hot bimbos being hot, but to me it’s just depressing to see old guys like Andy Griffith, Charles Durning, and Barry Bostwick giving career-worst performances, and simply unable to rise to Nielsen’s comic level. Spy Hard is a weird hybrid of feeling lazy while also being exhausting for how much it throws at you (but ultimately unsatisfying with how little sticks). You’ll get your fix for Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, and Fabio cameos, I guess.\n\nThe plot to Xanadu (1980) is something. An artist (Michael Beck), whose job is to repaint existing posters exactly but bigger, gets fed up because he wants to be a real artist. He quits his job, but also hates making stuff by himself. But his lack of inspiration causes several muses to pop out of some graffiti (the main muse played by Olivia Newton-John). Instead of inspiring the artist, she just kind of rollerskates around, and he becomes obsessed with her and wants to bang her. Enter 68-year old Gene Kelly as some sort of retired clarinet millionaire. The artist tells him he should open the club he’s always wanted to, and they decide to make it an upsetting combination of a 1940s big band dance theater and 1980s rock and roll club. Still not sure where the muse fits into any of this. The club Gene Kelly opens at the end makes no sense and is scary actually.\n\nOh, and it’s also a musical. Written by Electric Light Orchestra. Don’t get too excited. There’s way more rollerskating than singing.\n\n🎃 Stephen King’s directorical outing owes a lot to his muse: cocaine. Maximum Overdrive (1986) asks us to imagine a world where cars come to life and want to kill us sometimes. OK. Done. What now? Well, now you have to contend with being stuck in a gas station with a completely devoid-of-charisma Emilio Estevez. But fret not! What Estevez lacks here in charisma, he more than makes up for in being sweaty. Maximum Overdrive has some fun car stuff at times, but is such an aggressively brainless movie that it’s actually impressive that it is watchable at all.\n\nWhat a weird movie. Fun and Fancy Free (1947) is an anthology with only two stories, and multiple narrators with multiple bookend schticks. It starts out as a tale told by Jiminy Cricket (who has apparently been alive since the 1880s when Pinocchio takes place). He tells the story of a circus bear named Bongo who returns to the forest. Not really into the story of Bongo or the apocryphal bear lore of romantic slapping, but it’s nicely animated and fine.\n\nThen it shifts narrator perspectives when Jiminy reads a little girl’s mail (illegal, by the way) and decides to secrety crash her party across the street (not cool, Jiminy). The party is creepy as hell. It’s a live action segment where radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his puppets, the snarky Charlie McCarthy and mentally challenged Mortimer Snerd, are entertaining the child actor Luana Patten. Jiminy Cricket doesn’t really do much beyond touch their food and listen to the story. Call the police, Jiminy. Luana was invited to a puppet man’s house at night without a legal guardian. This is not normal.\n\nMickey and the Beanstalk is far from my favorite Mickey cartoons, but it has a psychotically unhinged Donald Duck and that’s always funny. I also appreciate the grander scope of this tight adventure. Really not digging Walt Disney’s voicing of Mickey here. Missing that youthful spunk. I like the harp’s song and the vine growing sequence and Donald’s manic freakout where he tries to murder a cow with an axe. Good stuff.\n\nFor me the real irksome thing is the Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy stuff interrupting Mickey and the Beanstalk. I’ve never really liked Bergen and McCarthy (they ruin W.C. Fields’ You Can’t Cheat an Honest Man for me)\n\nHere’s where I had to do a bit of research. I remember watching the Mickey and the Beanstalk segment on a VHS taped off of TV as a kid. It was narrated not by Bergen, but by Sterling Holloway (Kaa, Winnie the Pooh, the Cheshire Cat, etc.). This version makes a few edits. I also recall another version narrated by Ludwig von Drake (maybe my favorite minor Disney character), which makes a few different edits. I like Holloway’s cozy read, and there’s something anachronistically charming about the von Drake stuff (animated and recorded a few decades after the original short). Then I discover there is yet ANOTHER version of the Mickey and the Beanstalk narration. With Shari Lewis and Lambchop! I guess they wanted to stick with the original ventriloquism vibe. I have not seen it, but would like to find it.\n\nMiracles (1989) is apparently Jackie Chan’s favorite film he’s done. And I can understand why. It’s got some great period costumes, gangster shootouts, excellently choreographed action fight scenes, and Anita Mui. But not enough. It’s more of a cheeky comedy melodrama than a straight action movie. I love a good Jackie Chan flick, and the fights that are present are great, but I guess we just weren’t in the mood for a farce. Give us more action. Or at least a few more songs.\n\n🎃 In The Addiction (1995) Abel Ferrara uses vampires as a metaphor for heroine addiction and also as a metaphor for losing faith in this slowburn drama that serves mainly as a place for Ferrara to plug in all of his favorite quotes and concepts from an Intro to Philosophy course. There’s some good stuff in here, but it’s weighed down by how overwrought and philosophically eloquent everyone is about everything at all times. Also, the constant images of real world death are a bit much. I get it. Mankind is the real vampire. Or something. Lily Taylor, as a grad student who is becoming a vampire (aka a heroine addict, aka an annoying 13 year old atheist), will be waxing philosophical and then BAM. We hard cut to piles of real corpses in Vietnam and Holocaust. And stay on them for a long time.\n\nPerhaps a bit too soaked in Catholic guilt for some, but I do sort of admire Ferrara working out his demons so nakedly. Also, nobody hams up a scene like Christopher Walken when he wants to.\n\nI love Bob Hoskins as well as peeks into Roma culture (although Emir Kusturica is the real filmmaker to check out for that). I watched The Raggedy Rawney (1988) because it’s one of the few movies Bob Hoskins directed. It’s a wartime drama about a young boy (Dexter Fletcher) who runs away from the army, poses as an insane witch woman (a “raggedy rawney”), and fenagles his way into a gypsy camp. I wish we got a little more more into the head of the titular character. He’s the character the movie keeps at the furthest distance. The drama is good, Bob Hoskins’ mustache is luscious, it’s got some solid actors doing good work (Zoë Wanamaker, Zoë Natheson, and Ian McNiece), and a moving finale.\n\nIt is sensitive mode Hoskins, and I wonder why he wanted to tell this particular story. It’s good, but don’t expect a Long Good Friday or Mona Lisa type of mad dog performance from the guy.\n\nSo much of 70s Australian cinema is just warning people not to go. “We’re weirdos here, mate. Real sickos,” they told us. Everthing’s dusty and hot and distant and the folks in the smaller towns, well, they’re all mad. The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) is an early Peter Weir movie about a small community with an economy that requires car accidents to function. It’s not as fast-paced or exciting as Mad Max or as intense as Wake In Fright, but it does operate on a similarly weird wavelength. Most of the runtime is about a car crash survivor being informally adopted by the mayor (John Meillon), which is not particularly interesting. It’s a slow wind up to the wild car finale.\n\n🎃 Slasher films full of too many hot, buxom, young, horny teens for ya? Dark Night of the Scarecrow (1981) has got you covered. This story’s murder victims are all fat, middle-aged, male farmers who hate people with mental struggles. For a TV movie in a genre loaded with stereotypical lackluster entries, this one is pretty solid. A basic setup, some great performances (Charles Durning, I’m lookin’ at you), and some creatively horrific deaths involving farm equipment. Admittedly, Darkman‘s Larry Drake appearing as a “Simple Jack” type threw me off, but I soon recovered.\n\nRyan’s Babe (2000) is what we wait for. It’s a classically bad movie that is just as puzzling as it is incompetant. I assume this is just how all Saskatoonians see the world. Anyway, it’s a must-watch and any description I could give won’t do it justice.\n\nNeil Breen is back, and we were lucky enough to finally see one in theaters! Cade: The Tortured Crossing (2023), shot completely on greenscreen, was a special treat, but perhaps a note of diminishing returns… And our first moments of doubt. But perhaps that doubt is more in ourselves than in Breen.\n\nIf, in years to come, it is revealed that Neil Breen, as a man, is a hoax – that the entity that is Breen is all merely an elaborate performance art piece and the films are just one of the many extensions of this performance dreamed up by a team of Breen engineers (Breengineers, if you will), but have taken a life of their own, perhaps even beyond their initial intentions – I would not be mad.\n\nWhether Breen is exactly who he appears to be, whether he is an avant-garde experiment, whether he is a flawed but ever evolving entrepreneur grasping vaguely at what people love about him and tapping into waves of self-awareness, I truly do not care. If it is a trick, it is a great one. If it is all real, as I continue to humbly suspect, perhaps an even greater one.\n\n🎃 Cults and murder and Halloween. It’s Jag Mundhra’s Hack-O-Lantern (1988)! A somewhat infamously bad movie with a title that says precious nothing. It’s dumb fun that, if you’re in the mood, will surely scratch a trashy Halloween-y itch or two.\n\nNow I am become old, the gets tired watching a superhero movie. I absolutely loved 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It was fresh and fast and so imaginative and gorgeous. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) is no less technically impressive and smart, but I feel like I aged 10 years watching it. It’s a great movie with loads of astounding visuals, dizzying action scenes, sharp wit, and a nice arc for Gwen Stacy’s character. But after a time, it was just too fast and furious for me and I needed a nap. Maybe it’s a masterpiece every bit as good as the previous film. All I know is I felt exhausted.\n\n🎃 The Black Cat (1934) marked the first (but not the last) time Universal monster icons Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff would star in a movie together. It was only natural for the studios to pit Dracula against Frankentstein (the two most popular horror movies of 1931). Lugosi is a Hungarian (how appropos) psychiatrist who survives a taxi wagon accident along with a newlywed couple and winds up at the futuristic mansion of the Satanist (Karloff) who killed his wife.\n\nExtremely, loosely “suggested by” Edgar Allen Poe, this classic horror melodrama is decent enough for the time, but suffers from a clinical location (gimme a spooky castle over this pristine, sterile house), a plodding plot, and the fact that Lugosi and Karloff, while amazing in their own rights, are kind of weird together. Their acting styles and powerful personas clash, and not in a way that services the story. Something just feels off about their chemistry. Still, I love both these men and it’s always fun seeing them.\n\n🎃 Teruo Ishii’s Horrors of Malformed Men (1969) is a bit of blur to me now. I was tripping balls on cold medicine at the time. But that actually seems like the perfect headspace to enter this strange Japanese horror movie. I knew nothing about it going in, except that the cover art intrigued me. Sometimes you gotta trust your instincts. Malformed Men has some trashy twists and turns and some weird, culty body-horror type surgeries, but it’s a gradual windup. You gotta be patient.\n\n🎃 We had a time trying to guess which character was played by actor/writer/director/producer James Bond III. Depending on who we thought at any given moment, it drastically altered the overall tone and flavor of where this weird story was coming from. About 35 minutes in we confirmed who James Bond III was. Def by Temptation (1990) is a moralistic urban horror about a succubus that tempts people astray. It’s hard to score this one exactly as it’s a bit scattershot, but we definitely liked a lot of individual scenes. And what is a good movie if not a collection of pretty good scenes?\n\n🎃 Romero meets the Ramones! Zombies are attacking and only Japanese rock group Guitar Wolf (…and overcoming transphobia) can the world be saved in Tetsuro Takeuchi’s Wild Zero (1999). It’s wild and wacky, and would make an excellent double-feature with 1998’s Bio-Zombie.\n\n🎃 Michael Tolkin’s The Rapture (1991) is a super weird movie that’s gonna be hard to dissect in a blurb. It takes a specific brand of American Christian eschatology and treats it completely soberly, crafting a psychological slow-burn horror flick through the lens of that theology. It’s about doubt and faith and fanaticism and probably a whole lot more. It’s low-key, but also harrowing. Tolkin said while inroducing the film for Trailers from Hell that people came away from the movie in 1991 either happy it portrayed religion as true or happy it portrayed it as false, or angry about either of those two reads. Essentially, interpretations are numerous.\n\nMimi Rogers plays Sharon, an atheist call center employee and swinger who finds God and embarks on an apocalyptic journey that challenges her new faith at every turn. It is a provocative film for a lot of reasons, and I definitely had a lot of feelings about it while it was unfolding. Having grown up with evangelicalism (and having been shown the pre-Left Behind series, Thief in the Night and its sequels), the movie truly felt like a sermon I had heard many times before – but it was different this time. It was not the fantastical Christian Twilight Zone-esque cautionary tale. At least, not exactly. Tolkin doesn’t believe any of this stuff. His rather matter-of-fact presentation of the events doesn’t pass judgement on any of the characters. It lets things happen and leaves the moral determinations and the reality of it all up to the audience.\n\nWeird this was even made. Also stars David Duchovny. Would pair well with Bill Paxton’s Frailty. True as it ever was, no one does Christian movies quite like a non-Christian.\n\nWhat a cozy, silly man Steve Martin is. LA Story (1991) is a very personal and gentle romantic comedy with touches of surreal humor and magical realism. A weatherman (Martin) starts to receive messages from a freeway billboard that helps him win the affections of an English journalist (Victoria Tennant). It’s sweet and is about fate and love and Los Angeles and, it would seem, one of the closer peeks into Steve Martin’s head.\n\n🎃 Finally saw David Cronenberg’s The Brood (1979). I don’t want to give much away, but I will say that, like a lot of early Cronenberg movies, it starts as a strange, slow quasi-mystery; depicts Canada as a perpetually slushy and overcast dystopic snowmare* [*nightmare but with snow]; and gets wildly, weirdly gross once you start figuring out what’s going on.\n\nFor me, what elevates this above Shivers and Rabid, is the star power of Oliver Reed. Cronenberg starts putting actors with more gravitas in his movies (Michael Ironside, James Woods, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Walken, Jeremy Irons, etc.), and, for me, it really adds to the film. I love Cronenberg’s bizarro body-horror concepts and themes on identity, but inserting a more captivating actor into the story really sucks you in more. What can I say? I’m an actor boy. The Brood does start slow and cryptic, but once you get to the third act, it’s pretty hard to say the ride wasn’t worth it.\n\n🎃 Thirteen Women (1932), directed by George Archainbaud, is an estrogen-fueled, pre-Code, proto-slasher flick and it rules. The sinister magic at work isn’t a masked killer with a knife, but merely the power of suggestion…which appears to work murderously well on the poor, horoscope-obsessed victims. Someone is killing women! And in surprisingly creative and grisly ways for a movie made in 1932.\n\nIt is a bit “has aged poorly” in a few key aspects. Myrna Loy plays an evil Indonesian swami who was the victim of cruel racism in her school days. Naturally, she’s a supervillain now. For some reason, Hollywood kept casting Myrna Loy as an Asian woman in this part of her career. Thank God she eventually moved from Fu Manchu to The Thin Man. She’s actually a much better comic actor than a dragon lady trope.\n\nThe movie does highlight a deep flaw within astrology (that I imagine even subscribers of would undoubtedly admit), and that is the pliable susceptibility of the mind. If you are looking for something, you will almost certainly find it, whether it is there or not. I’ve never seen astrology used as a murder weapon before, and it’s pretty intriguing how Thirteen Women employs it. Although, this is less of a Derren Brown exposé of superstition, and more a cheap, pulpy thriller. It even has a train in it.\n\nQuentin Tarantino, love him or hate him, hasn’t made a bad movie. Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) is a sharp homage to many of the movies that made him. Uma Thurman is the bride out for revenge, hacking her way through Vivica A. Fox, Chiaki Kuriyama, Lucy Liu, and every last member of the Crazy 88 to get to the man who done her wrong: Bill. It’s a fast, pulpy, hyper-violent revenge thriller streamlined to its essentials so that the movie can focus on delivering stylish visuals inspired by wild retro flicks. Cue the 5, 6, 7, 8’s!\n\nRoy Andersson’s Songs from the Second Floor (2000) is a Swedish tragicomedy played out in numerous vignettes that occasionally overlap. The humor is pitch black and quite haunting. It examines the cruelty and banality of modern life in Sweden, and how it is tainted by the crimes of the past and the uncertainty of the future, but all at an arm’s length, almost as if it all were being presented as an especially grim (and rather Scandinavian) Far Side cartoon. It marks the beginning of Andersson’s trilogy of similarly styled features which include You, the Living (2007) (which is quite good) and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence (2014) (I need to see it).\n\n🎃 I think I’m obsessed with David Robert Mitchell now. I absolutely loved the criminally underseen neo-noir Under the Silver Lake, and I was quite taken by his earlier horror film It Follows (2014) which I have now seen.\n\nFor a supernatural horror like this to work it needs: 1. an intriguing monster, 2. clear rules, 3. let the discovery of those rules unfold a bit like a mystery. Check, check, and check. I’m just a sucker for monsters and their rules. To make it great it needs: 1. clever concept couched in a topical metaphor, 2. great cinematography, 3. Disasterpeace does the soundtrack. Triple check again.\n\nApparently Mitchell is currently working on some sort of “dinosaur movie set in the 80s” starring Oscar Isaac and Anne Hathaway. Please, let this movie be made. I need this.\n\nWhile I really like Kill Bill Vol. 1, I love Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004). Uma’s back and going after Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and ultimately David Carradine. This sequel tones things down and slows things down and morphs into a very different kind of movie. While the first movie had a comically high body count, this time the Bride ultimately takes only one life. It’s a more pensive movie, with more consequences, more tragic backstory, and more lugubrious soliloquoys. I don’t know if anyone has ever had more fun telling a story than Tarantino. The inevitable violence is teased out, but has more power and weight to it. If Vol. 1 was an 70s exploitation movie steeped in old school Japanese revenge flicks (Lady Snowblood, for one) that would work just as well as a silent film, Vol. 2 is a talky, slowburn western peppered with nods to classic Chinese kung-fu. Together, they are a fantastic showcase of the power of various cinematic styles and how those styles inform the telling of a story, even one so simple as a basic revenge plot.\n\n🎃 Jerzy Skolimowski The Shout (1978) tickled me in ways that I find quite easy to pinpoint. Listen, my review of this is probably beyond rational. This a genre I love: weird guy insinuates himself into normal man’s life and cucks the bejeezus out of him – think Cul-de-sac, Bone, Borgman, What About Bob?, etc. And it’s from a time when cinematic protagonists had hyper specific, unusual jobs. In this case, John Hurt plays an experimental electronic composer. I love those details.\n\nA mysterious man (Alan Bates) claims to have learned dark Aboriginal magick. There is a scream that can be uttered that can kill a man. Is it true or merely the rich braggadocio of a lunatic? Or perhaps he is not insane, but merely exceptionally manipulative. Or again, is it real? What does he want?\n\nSkolimowski’s direction is bonkers from the start. Lots of bold and bizarre choices that suck you in and thrash you around. The sound design as well is very intentional and great. John Hurt and Susannah York are well cast, but the real reason this movie is so beguiling and strange is because of Alan Bates’ dangerous, unhinged performance. He keeps you on the edge of your seat and surprises you at every turn.\n\nHappy Halloween 🎃\n\nRate this:\n\nI watched movies again. Whatever it means to rank disparate films in order of how much one enjoyed it, I did it.\n\nThe Cannon Group is always a weirder production company than my dumb brain realizes. Anyways, Menahem Golan’s The Apple (1980) is one of the more out there musicals. Bold choice to retell the timeless story of wide-eyed innocents being corrupted by the allure of the entertainment industry and map it onto Christian Evangelical tribulation eschatology complete with a literal Deus Ex Machina and also have it totally suck ass. I will say, however, it was nice to finally see character actor Vladek Sheybal get a big role (he plays Mr. Boogalow aka the Devil). He’s pretty bad, but he’s having fun. I liked that. They even gave him some song numbers. He can’t sing either, but he’s having fun.\n\nWho doesn’t want to get lost in Richard E. Grant’s beautiful baby blues? Warlock (1989) is about wizards that travel to modern day to stop each other. It’s a mostly forgettable affair, and I have to put the blame on how small the adventure feels and the villain (a blonde ponytailed, barefoot man in a black romper who can fly). I need to watch Whitnail & I again to cleanse the palate.\n\nWatched schlockmeister Ted V. Mikels’ The Astro-Zombies (1968) out of a sick duty. We stumbled upon his 2004 sequel, Mark of the Astro-Zombies, by happenstance a couple years ago. It is also an extremely bad movie. Cheap, ugly, stupid, nonsensical, BUT we were overcome with fascination at the volume of old people in it. Turns out a lot of them had ties to Mikels from way back in the day. It is also the movie that introduced us to Tura Satana. She is marvelous trash and loving it. Best takeaway, by far. So we found the original Astro-Zombies and…not nearly enough Tura in it. She’s cool and mean, but most of the film is boring talking heads and an ancient John Carradine using a screwdriver and talking to a greasy Igor knockoff. Is it worth it? Not really, unless you’re a Tura or Mikels completist. Watch Russ Meyer’s Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! instead.\n\nI remembered disliking Legend (1985) when it was shown to me years ago. Fastforward to a couple weeks ago and I’m thinking how did I not like a weird Ridley Scott fantasy movie with a Tangerine Dream score, Rob Bottin makeup effects, and a horny Tim Curry in the best Devil suit ever constructed trying to seduce Mia Sara? And Tom Cruise is in it?\n\nGave it another shot. I think the problem is it is boring and rather unengaging. When you compare it to something like NeverEnding Story, it’s almost depressingly subdued and shapeless. It’s also clinically claustrophobic. Show me a sky. And not enough Tim Curry, who is absolutely the reason to watch it at all. He’s chewing scenery, loving being evil.\n\nNico Mastorakis’ Nightmare at Noon (1988) starts off pretty solid and engaging, but it makes a few cowardly choices along the way and loses steam once George Kennedy is out of the picture and the characters leave the town. If you wanted a bad version of Bucarau that will test your tolerance for Bo Hopkins and Wings Hauser, then give it a whirl.\n\nIs Demon Seed (1977), a hoakie sci-fi thriller about a robotic house that wants to shag Julie Christie, truly a better film than Legend or Nightmare at Noon? Who’s to say, but Demon Seed doesn’t have Wings Hauser or the perpetually wincing face of Bo Hopkins in it. Demon Seed is an impressively stupid movie about an evil AI that’s trying to Rosemary’s Baby up a human to live forever. When the evil computer is challenging people (albeit with embarrassingly simplistic reasoning skills) and using uniquely computer-y ways to disturb and kill people, it’s kind of cool. It doesn’t do that very much. Best things here were the folding metal shape monster (RIP Beef from Phantom of the Paradise) and the robot baby.\n\nListen, I love the body horror, wet puppets, and jittery stop-motion ghoulies. I even dig the flashback structure. Where this movie really rubs me the wrong way is the goofy comedy acting, which just didn’t work for me. Check out Metamorphosis: The Alien Factor (1990), but know it’s more comedy than horror.\n\nKate Bush is great and way better than this short film: The Line, the Cross and the Curve (1993). It features several of her songs, and a few of the numbers are filmed very entertainingly, but it’s not as good as a surreal Kate Bush musical should be. We watched this after seeing The Red Shoes (appearing later on this list), as it was a huge inspiration and one of her favorite movies.\n\nWhat’s this? An Italian Southern Gothic supernatural horror flick about a Louisiana house built on a portal to Hell directed by Lucio Fulci?? It’s The Beyond (1981), everybody. I couldn’t tell you much about the plot or the characters. Like a lot of films in this style, it’s more of an atmospheric pastiche of weird, brutal violence and some striking imagery. It held our interest and I liked the final shot quite a bit.\n\nBrad Bird is responsible for some of my favorite animated films. Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles. I had a few worries about Pixar’s superhero sequel, The Incredibles 2 (2018) going in. Hence why it’s taken so long to see it. Ultimately, it’s not bad. It sags a bit in the middle, but the story is good enough, there are some fresh ideas, and the animation is amazing to look at. Watching Mrs. Incredible hit the same exact story beats as Mr. Incredible did before this time around isn’t the most exciting. And Mr. Incredible being a tired, grouchy dad maybe isn’t as funny as it could be, but on the whole it’s nice to the see the family back together. That first movie is really hard to top, and this isn’t Toy Story 2.\n\nSometimes I respect a novel, ambitious mess more than a streamlined success. Underground animator Ralph Bakshi has a lot of those types of movies in his canon, and Wizards (1977) is weird even for him. It’s a fantasy set in the future, and it’s about the rise of fascism. An evil wizard utilizes old footage of Adolf Hitler (and there is a LOT of Nazi and WWII footage in what was allegedly Bakshi’s attempt at a family movie) to inspire his army of cybernetic goons to oppress the fairyfolk and dwarves of Montagar.\n\nIn addition to the Nazi stuff, it’s also a pretty violent and horny movie. The Frazetta-inspired, scantily clad queen of the fairies is perpetually nipping out. The good wizard’s mushroom tower house is unmistakably phallic. And it’s got war and guns and cartoon blood.\n\nThe movie is all over the place. The tone veers wildly from screwball sex comedy to serious warning about fascism and how easily it can take hold and be used to destroy peace. The quality of the animation shifts throughout the movie. Bakshi’s reliance on rotoscoping is not to everyone’s tastes. The still images and backgrounds are wonderful! And it does have that Bakshi grim satire. The ending, depending on your mood might strike you as stupid or anticlimactic. I actually weirdly think it’s hilarious and maybe even important or something. Like I said, it’s a mess, but I have to respect it.\n\nWes Anderson is a fascinating specimen. Each of his films becomes a litmus test for fans’ personal Rubicons of what they are willing to accept, as well as a confirmation for his detractors for why his style is so devoid of appeal. Maybe more than any other director. All this to say, I did not like Asteroid City (2023). But I know a lot of people who loved it. Classic Anderson play, right there.\n\nSet in a Cold War desert town, Asteroid City is pretty to look at (maybe even visually genius), but somehow even more scattered, plotless, and emotionally inert than usual. Confoundingly of all to me is how little a movie about a television show about a play so very little resembles either. It’s squarely the language of cinema, making the constant reminders that it’s a behind the scenes look at a theater production all the more bewildering. Is it about the military industrial complex in 1950s America? Not really. Is it about how science is deemed the playground of weird children? Maybe? Is it about dealing with death and loss? Not exactly. Is it about the storie"
