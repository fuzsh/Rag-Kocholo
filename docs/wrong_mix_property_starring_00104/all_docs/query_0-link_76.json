        "text": "Townsquare Media Tuscaloosa announced Friday that the local media company will host a free movie series that will take place in Government Plaza this summer.\n\nFree Movies Downtown at Sundown will be a six-week event where the Tuscaloosa community can gather in the plaza to enjoy a family-friendly film, free of charge. The event is supported by presenting sponsors Tuscaloosa Tourism and Sports, the City of Tuscaloosa, Pepsi and Bryant Bank.\n\nAccording to a Friday press release, the first-of-its-kind summer movie series also offers local eats from area food trucks. Attendees will be able to bring lawn chairs and blankets to the free event, and coolers that contain non-alcoholic beverages will be welcome.\n\nEach movie will start \"just after dusk\" so families can enjoy the film with a delicious local dinner and still get home by bedtime.\n\n“Life is finally returning to normal; we’re so excited to get out and have a good time,” said Meg Summers, TSM Tuscaloosa’s Director of Content. “I don’t believe this is something Tuscaloosa has ever done before, so we’re so happy to be kicking off a great community event.”\n\nThe series begins with a June 5 showing of the smash Disney hit “Frozen II.” Rumor has it, Elsa or Anna might even make an appearance at Government Plaza.\n\nFans of Disney princesses will not want to miss the following weekend’s movie. On June 12, “The Princess and the Frog” will be shown.\n\nFamilies and children are encouraged to dig their 2020 Halloween costumes out of storage and come to Government Plaza dressed up on June 19. The beloved “Hocus Pocus” will be the feature flick of the weekend, making good the Halloween we wish we could have had last year.\n\nAll Muggles are encouraged to come downtown on June 26 as they show “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” Disclaimer: all Hogwarts houses are welcome to be represented.\n\nDon’t stay home alone on Saturday, July 3, because Christmas in July is coming to Government Plaza. “Home Alone” will be the fifth film in the summer movie series, and while the event is free, you'll still be expected to “keep the change, ya filthy animal.”\n\nClosing out the series will be “Back to the Future,” a classic flick that will satisfy children and adults alike – and just might satisfy your urge to go back in time before masks, vaccines and toilet paper shortages. Hoverboard parking will be available on the fourth floor of the City of Tuscaloosa Intermodal Facility Deck.\n\n“This summer movie series is something for every family because it’s free and a great way for us to come out and be part of Tuscaloosa, love our community and see our neighbors again,” Summers added. “We’re so grateful to Tuscaloosa Tourism and Sports, the City of Tuscaloosa, Pepsi and Bryant Bank for making this fantastic series a reality.”\n\nIf you’re a business owner who is interested in supporting this great community event, reach out to Pete Mills at pete.mills@townsquaremedia.com.
