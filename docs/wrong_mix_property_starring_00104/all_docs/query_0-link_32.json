Four months after the theatrical release of Anastasia, Fox expanded its commitment to animation. Fox Family Films, one of four film divisions of Twentieth Century Fox, has been renamed Fox Animation Studios, to reflect the division's new plan to focus solely on animated feature films, including stop-motion, mixed media (live-action mix) and digital production. \"We have been and continue to be committed to animation for the long haul, and this expansion reflects the exciting potential that Anastasia has opened up for us,\" said Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman and CEO Bill Mechanic. Live-action projects which were in development by Fox Family Films are being shelved, put into turnaround or transferred to other Fox film divisions. Chris Melenandri will stay on as president of the renamed division, Kevin Bannerman has been upped from vice to senior vice president and Melissa Cobb will keep her post as vice president of production. While Fox Animation Studios' main production facility will remain in Phoenix, the division's Los Angeles office is likely to expand to accommodate more development personnel. Several animated projects are on the development slate, including Dark Town with Henry Selick, Chris Columbus and Sam Hamm, Santa Calls with Blue Sky|VIFX, and projects with Matt Groening (The Simpsons), Steve Oedekerk and Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Fox's second animated feature, Planet Ice (1999), is currently in production in Phoenix, under the direction of Art Vitello, and shortly, the studio is expected to announce the next project from Anastasia producer/directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman.\n\nHit Gets Hot For Production. London-based distributor HIT Entertainment has launched a production studio in Manchester called HOT Animation. The Â£2 million facility is being headed by producer Jackie Cockle, director Brian Little and cameraman Joe Dembinski, all formerly of Cosgrove Hall Films, which, until late 1997, produced the stop-motion animated series, Brambly Hedge for HIT. The studio has hired a staff of 20 people including animators Paul Couvele and George Laban, and will also utilize freelancers and trainees. HOT Animation will begin production on four new 30-minute episodes of Brambly Hedge in April and 13 ten-minute episodes of Bob the Builder, a new, stop-motion pre-school series, in July. HOT Animation will also be available for third-party production of stop-motion animation for television, commercials, and film. HIT, a publicly traded company, distributes programming to the BBC and broadcasters in more than 80 territories, and launched into home video distribution in September 1997. HIT's managing director Peter Orton said the launch into production represents a \"major breakthrough\" for the company, and will maximize revenue by ensuring control of rights and the entire production process.\n\nFestivals Form Alliance. While the growing number of animation events worldwide is resulting in increased competition for patronage and sponsorship funds, organizers of animation festivals in Canada, Holland and Switzerland have established an alliance to work collectively on selective programs, exhibitions and sponsorship proposals. The newly formalized partnership will combine resources of three festivals: the Ottawa International Animation Festival Animation Festival (OIAF),> the <Holland Animation Film Festival (HAFF)> and Fantoche. The festivals are co-producing an exhibition by Estonian animator Mati Kutt and a retrospective program of films by Russian animator Alexei Karaev, and in the future, plan to build a collective film archive and expand into distribution. OIAF director Chris Robinson said the group is open to expanding the alliance to include other festivals. \"The aim is the preservation, maintenance and strengthening of the promotion of independent animation and the artists,\" he said.\n\nAlliance Allies With Toymakers. Toronto-based media company Alliance Communications has formed partnerships with three companies: Irwin Toys, Fisher-Price and Sega of America, to develop animated titles based on toys and games. With fellow Canadian company Irwin Toy, Alliance will produce 26 episodes of the Pascal Morelli-designed The 108 Outlaws, aan animated, action/adventure television series combining mythology, Asian legends and medieval tales. A production partner for Outlaws has not yet been named. With U.S. company Fisher-Price (a subsidiary of Mattel), Alliance has already launched production on an animated direct-to-video and series pilot based on Fisher-Price's new Rescue Heroes toy line unveiled at Toyfair. Toronto-based Pictor Entertainment is producing the 2-D/3-D animation, slated for completion in June 1998. Alliance will also produce 13 half-hour episodes of BUG!, a series based on Sega of America's Saturn video game of the same name. The comedy series will consist of three computer-animated cartoon shorts per episode. BUG! will be Alliance's third computer animated series, following Reboot and Beast Wars which were co-produced with the Vancouver-based studio, Mainframe Entertainment. It has not been determined if Mainframe will be involved in the making of BUG!.\n\nFor more animation and toy news, see our review of the 1998 Toy Fair, in the March 1998 issue of Animation World Magazine.\n\nPeople\n\nSimpsons Voices Sound Off. A group of actors who voice characters on Fox's animated series, The Simpsons have collectively asked for a major salary increase for next season, inside sources say. The group, which includes Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer and Yeardly Smith, each earn less than $35,000 per episode, and are requesting more than $100,000 per episode, according to a report in Daily Variety (3/13/98). While Fox is in negotiations with the actors and is expected to compromise with some sort of pay increase, the change could set a precedent which will be hard for producers of other animated shows to match. The Simpsons is produced for Fox by North Hollywood-based Film Roman, Inc. and will begin its 10th season in fall 1998.\n\nMusical Chairs.

He was 65 years old. Seti worked in the New York commercial animation industry for over 35 years, founded two film graphics/animation companies, and taught animation in the 1980s and 90s. He is also a past president of the now defunct New York union, the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Guild. Seti emigrated to the U.S. from Egypt in the late 1940s and started his career in animation working for Film Graphics, a company run by Lee Blair, husband of Disney artist Mary Blair and brother of animation historian Preston Blair. He also worked for studios such as Trilogy Graphics, Nexus Productions, Laser East and Frame:Runner, and for Hal Seeger on a remake of the Fleischer Koko the Clown series, which aired on television in the late 1950s. In 1971 Seti founded Sunflower Films, which he ran until 1986, and in 1992 he founded Seti Video Communications, which produced commercials out of White Plains, New York. In the 1980s he offered animation classes at his studio in the evenings, which were frequented by advertising agency staffers. Up until late 1997, Seti was teaching advanced animation at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City. \"He was a bright and clever person,\" said colleague Howard Beckerman, who teaches a similar class at SVA. Animator Emily Hubley has taken over Seti's class at SVA.\n\nPlaces\n\n<Nicktoons New Studio Opens.> Check out our special report on the brand new Nicktoons Animation Studio in Burbank, California.\n\nCal Science Center Gets Animated.

The 15-minute animated sequence features the voice of Howard Hoffman as Walt.\n\nMarvel Mania Opens. After four years of planning and construction, the comic-themed restaurant Marvel Mania has opened at Universal City in Los Angeles-adjacent Universal City, California. The restaurant is filled with Marvel comics exhibits and interactive displays such as a 20 x 20 foot video screen running Marvel animation, synchronized to dining booths that vibrate with the animated scenes. Even the restrooms have animated characters projected on the mirrors, using a technology called Pepper's Ghost, created by the U.K.-based company of the same name. The restaurant also features a store and a permanent exhibit of Marvel artifacts including original art from Marvel comics dating back to 1939. If all that's not enough to draw a crowd, the menu featuring \"Mutant Chicken Wings,\" the \"Iron Man Burger\" and \"Chocolate Carnage\" should do the trick.\n\nFilms\n\nPentafour Producing Motion-Capture Feature. Pentafour, a Madras, India-based animation and effects company, has started production on what is being called the first animated motion-capture feature film, Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of the Mists. Working with Venice, California-based motion-capture company, House of Moves, Pentafour has begun shooting motion-capture data (optical technique) in Los Angeles which will be composited with computer-generated characters by artists in both the Los Angeles and Madras facilities.

Cartoon Network U.S. aired an eight-hour marathon program called \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons of All Time\" on March 14 and 15. The program includes interviews with Chuck Jones, Joe Barbera, June Foray, Charlie Adler, Maurice Noble and Leonard Maltin. While Cartoon Network programmers were inspired by Jerry Beck's book of the same name, for which more than 1,000 animation professionals were asked to pick the 50 greatest cartoons, the lineup of this program is different than the list in the book, in that it only includes films that Cartoon Network and parent company Time/Warner own or to which they have secured broadcast rights. Disney films included in the book, such as Skeleton Dance, The Band Concert and Steamboat Willie will not be featured, nor will certain \"politically incorrect\" Warner Bros. films be shown, such as Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, one of the \"Censored 11\" shorts which was included in the Beck's book. However, Cartoon Network's program does include some rarely seen gems. A complete list follows: What's Opera, Doc?

Burbank, California-based DIC Entertainment is launching a division to produce all new animated fare for direct-to-video release. The new \"video premiere\" division will be headed by Riley Katherine Ellis, who was most recently a producer of live-action for Caravan Pictures. DIC Entertainment, owned by the Walt Disney Company, will release its videos through Buena Vista, one of Disney's distribution divisions. A title based on the Madeline animated series is slated for release in spring 1999. A feature length animated Inspector Gadget video is also planned, to coincide with the future theatrical release of a Disney live-action feature based on the animated character. \"[Direct-to-video entertainment] is a new industry that I think will grow considerably,\" said Ellis, who has been getting her feet wet at DIC since mid-March. Though Ellis has no prior experience producing animation, she feels that her extensive live-action background will prove useful in developing compelling material for animation, and is looking to work with writers with experience writing for long-form projects as well as animated series.\n\nA Mighty Video at the Right Time.

This gives Mighty Kong ample time to cash in on what Warner Home Video's director of marketing Dan Capone calls, \"the impending `Monster Mania'\" which will emerge in the consumer marketplace. Mighty Kong runs 78 minutes and will be available June 16 for U.S. $19.94.\n\nFernGully 2 In A Store Near You.
