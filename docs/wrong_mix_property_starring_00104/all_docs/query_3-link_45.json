        "text": "FADE IN:\n\nEXT. SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN, DURING A RAINSTORM\n\nA FISHING TRAWLER is sailing along doing fishing trawler things.\n\nAL LEONG\n\nHi, audience! I'm legendary stuntman and \"Die Hard\" villain Al Leong. My presence is a sure signal of the high-octane thrills and inventiveness in store! Now to further showcase my talents by\n\nSuddenly a MYSTERIOUS GIANT SHAPE emerges from the ocean and MURDERS EVERYBODY!\n\nDEAD SAILORS\n\nOh hey, that was basically just a loud and hyper-edited version of the way the 1954 movie started. Maybe this will be a halfway faithful adaptation, surprisingly!\n\nDIRECTOR ROLAND EMMERICH\n\nWait, that was in the original? I'll be honest, I haven't seen it. Oh well, I'll just be sure to be extra careful to do nothing that even distantly resembles a Godzilla movie from here on out. Thanks, dead people!\n\nDEAD SAILORS\n\n(pout, postmortemly)\n\nEXT. CHERNOBYL\n\nScientist MATTHEW BRODERICK is studying a MUDDY PUDDLE OF WORMS in CHERNOBYL when he is approached by MILITARY GUY KEVIN DUNN.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nDr. Broderick, I hate to interrupt your worm experiments that a nobody American scientist is free to conduct independently inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which is a totally plausible concept, but the military needs your help!\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nI see. Incidentally, my character name is Dr. Tatopoulos.\n\n(holds for laughter)\n\n(keeps holding until it becomes clear that no laughter is forthcoming)\n\nOh wait, is that just a perfectly ordinary name that's easy to pronounce and not inherently funny at all? Damn, we've built like thirty jokes around that name. Anyway, lead me to the science.\n\nHe is flown to the SCIENCE, where he meets VICKI LEWIS.\n\nVICKI LEWIS\n\nHi, I'm another scientist who is here, I do literally nothing in this movie.\n\n(scopes out Matthew)\n\nBut holy shit, would you check out this eye candy! Hubba hubba, what a stud!\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\n(looks behind him to see who she's talking about)\n\nWhat, me? You do realize they wound up casting Matthew Broderick in this role, right? Pretty sure somebody forgot to delete that line from the script.\n\nVICKI LEWIS\n\nThat's not the only one, characters in this movie are going to be constantly swooning over and deferring to you as though you're, ah...\n\n(quickly googles \"1998 Sexiest Man Alive\")\n\n...Harrison Ford or something. Eh, enjoy the ride while it lasts, I guess?\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nListen up, you steely-eyed dreamboat! We've brought you here because there's been a bunch of boats being destroyed by some kind of monster as it swims across the ocean. It also got out of the ocean to stroll across the land for a few minutes, seemingly for the sole purpose of leaving a trail of giant footprints, you know how those fantasy monsters love to leave giant footprints.\n\nVICKI LEWIS\n\nI think it's some kind of prehistoric creature from the depths of the sea. Since this has always been Godzilla's backstory, it seems like the best way to proceed with-\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nFuck that mythology-respecting shit, I've got a better one: he's a mutant! I studied Chernobyl worms that mutated to be seventeen percent larger. My theory is that this thing's an iguana or something that got mutated by radiation to be the size of a skyscraper, and be bipedal, and breathe fire, and basically the radiation just zapped it into a monster, we're talking real Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shit here.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nIt's a nuclear mutant? Gosh, that's a concept that never occurred to us!\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nWait, it didn't? Then why the hell did you even bring me here? Nuclear mutants are my entire field of expertise, it's all I do.\n\nEXT. DOCK, NEW YORK CITY, DURING A RAINSTORM\n\nA FISHERMAN goes and casts a line into MANHATTAN'S HORRIBLY POLLUTED WATERS to try and catch some INEDIBLE FISH. Suddenly, his line starts SPOOLING OUT INCREDIBLY FAST and his rod is YANKED INTO THE WATER! Then a GIGANTIC SHAPE starts swimming towards the DOCK!\n\nFISHERMAN\n\nOH NO! When I cast my line twenty feet out into the water, it somehow snagged a monster that was swimming a hundred yards away! Then got pulled out to sea as said monster swam... towards me?\n\n(dock starts exploding under his feet)\n\nAH FUCK IT, IT'LL MAKE FOR A COOL TRAILER AT LEAST\n\n(flees)\n\nThen GODZILLA emerges from the water and we can finally see the new design for OH SWEET CHRIST WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT.\n\nGODZILLA\n\nWhat? Is it the massive chin that makes the rest of my head look comically small by comparison? It's the fingers, isn't it. You're suddenly realizing how ridiculous a T-rex would look with human-proportioned arms and super long fingers.\n\n(checks out reflection in side of skyscraper)\n\nOkay, yeah. Mistakes were made. Let's just try our best to work with what we've got.\n\nDIRECTOR ROLAND EMMERICH\n\nWhat are you talking about? Look how big you are! People loved Jurassic Park because of how big the dinosaurs were, I assume, and you're like WAY bigger, therefore better! Now go smash buildings for me, you beautiful giant skinny bobbleheaded freak!\n\nGODZILLA starts stomping his way through the city while SHITTING OUT ENTIRE BOATS every other block, how many fishing trawlers did this asshole gobble up anyway?!?\n\nINT. NEWSROOM WHERE A RAINSTORM IS HAPPENING INDOORS, JUST ASSUME ABSOLUTELY EVERY SCENE FROM HERE ON IN IS DRENCHED IN RAIN\n\nMARIA PITILLO is a JOURNALIST in a TV NEWSROOM, where the anchorman is HARRY SHEARER, and HANK AZARIA is a CAMERAMAN.\n\nHARRY SHEARER\n\nHey look everybody, this is what me and Hank's faces look like! Please remember us, we really need to build our profiles to shore up our careers for when The Simpsons ends.\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nThat's right, after ten seasons the show's starting to show real signs of decline, so one can only assume the gravy train's coming to an end soon. Not like we'll still be churning it out a quarter century from now, ha ha!\n\nHARRY SHEARER\n\n(sweating)\n\nHa ha ha, surely not...\n\nNANCY CARTWRIGHT\n\n(is also in this movie for some reason)\n\nHa ha ha please God\n\nGODZILLA passes the building!\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nHoly smokes, I better go out and film this!\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nYou mean from the side of the street, right? Where you'll be out of harm's way?\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nNo, from immediately in the monster's path where I could easily be stepped on! After all, when filming something the size of fifty elephants, you gotta go in for that closeup!\n\n(nearly gets smushed)\n\nWhew, that was close.\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE\n\nLORRY GOLDMAN brings the news to MAYOR MICHAEL LERNER.\n\nLORRY GOLDMAN\n\nMr. Mayor, there's some ridiculous-looking CGI beast aimlessly wandering the city like a lost tourist, causing lots of random property damage!\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nWell gee, I'd like to do something effectual about that, but unfortunately I'm dumb and fat and useless and also I suck, and did I mention I'm fat?\n\n(scarfs candy)\n\nYou'll note that I look exactly like film critic Roger Ebert, and you look like Gene Siskel, both of whom dunked on the director's previous movies, and my campaign poster has me giving a thumbs-up. Such a clever and sophisticated joke! Not at all the kind of burn a nine-year-old would think up!\n\nLORRY GOLDMAN\n\nBut wait, maybe it's TOO sophisticated and subtle! We should straight-up name these characters \"Mayor Ebert\" and \"Gene\", just in case there's some recent lobotomy patients in the audience who can't figure it out!!\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nOf course, if they want to take a swipe at the folks who think Roland Emmerich is a hack director, we really should have been called \"Mayor Every Major Film Critic\" and his sidekick \"Most of the Filmgoing Public As Well\".\n\nHe reconnoitres with KEVIN.\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nYou military types have to do something military to save my political caree- uh, I mean, the city! I don't know what to do, I am dumb as well as fat.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nWell we'd shoot the monster or blow it up or something, but erm, we lost it, it's disappeared.\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\n...Seriously? It gave you the slip? How the hell did it manage that, it's bigger than I am and look how FAT I am! Plus UGLY and STUPID with TERRIBLE OPINIONS.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nThis is a thing in Godzilla movies, remember? Sometimes the humans need time to do human things, so Godzilla has to just sort of go away for a while.\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nOh right, he just keeps going back into the ocean. I guess Manhattan is an island, so that's not such a hacky solution.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\n(twiddles thumbs awkwardly)\n\nYes, that would make sense... but instead he's hanging out in the sewer, is what we're saying.\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\n(stares, fatly)\n\nThe sewer. The creature with shoulders the width of an opera house. Is hiding in the sewer.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nWe address it! We explain that he's burrowing around down there like a gopher! Which is a comically idiotic visual, so please don't picture it, especially when we attempt to show it!\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nWHAT?! But that'd mean he'd be carving tunnels down there big enough to fly a jet plane through! He'd be swiss-cheesing the whole city, knocking out the foundations of buildings, shredding our power lines and phone lines and plumbing and turning us into a giant sinkhole!\n\n(looks to camera)\n\nI would just like to remind everybody that I am a big ugly stupidhead, and I wouldn't know a good alien movie if it bit me in my giant flabby ass. Durrr.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nLook, none of this makes sense, who cares, we're just making shit up off the top of our heads to join the action scenes together. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go ask our genius scientist to come up with a strategy that any fifth-grader could have figured out.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nLook, this thing is really just an animal. We should put out food to lure into stopping where we want it to, just like what Wile E. Coyote did with the Road Runner half the time!\n\nVICKI LEWIS\n\nNotice how that's something that I, the dinosaur expert, could have thought of and suggested, instead of \"the worm guy\"? I seriously don't know what I'm in this movie for.\n\nThey amass a GIANT TWENTY-FOOT-TALL PILE OF FISH in TIMES SQUARE. This is a LOT OF FISH, but since that's merely a PLAIN PROSAIC FACT of this scene it would add NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE for anybody to point this out, so NOBODY DOES. Then GODZILLA arrives and starts devouring the FISH.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nAll right, it worked! Now hurry up with the aerial bombardment!\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nWith the what now?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\n...You did set up an airstrike, right? We arranged a precise bullseye location for the target to be, and he came, and he's right here. You guys were prepared to bomb the entire location to smithereens and guarantee the monster is destroyed, surely?\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\n(scratches head)\n\nGee, that seems really obvious in hindsight. We're mostly gonna shoot it with guns.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nWow.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nAnd some rockets, for what that's worth! FIRE!\n\nThey fire BULLETS as well as ROCKETS at GODZILLA. But then DIRECTOR ROLAND EMMERICH notices the FLATIRON BUILDING and the CHRYSLER BUILDING.\n\nDIRECTOR ROLAND EMMERICH\n\nWait, are those FAMOUS FUCKING LANDMARKS?! Grrrr, I fucking HATE famous landmarks!!\n\n(scribbles into script)\n\nTAKE THAT, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!\n\nThe ROCKETS pause in midair, turn, then blow up the LANDMARKS, allowing GODZILLA to turn tail and run! Helicopters chase after him, firing their AUTO-CANNONS and strafing the fuck out of NUMEROUS APARTMENT BUILDINGS and let's hope all their tenants were able and willing to comply with the evacuation order, and didn't hunker down in their homes!\n\nHELICOPTER PILOT #1\n\nShit, he's gone around a corner! Better turn the corner as well and follow him. Damn, he's gone around ANOTHER corner! Better take that corner as well. Nuts, he's gone around ANOTHER corner! ...And so on, for waaay longer than you'd think.\n\nFollowing GODZILLA around like the fiftieth CORNER, the helicopters find a huge HOLE has been ripped straight through a SKYSCRAPER.\n\nHELICOPTER PILOT #1\n\nFuck, looks like Godzilla's tunnelled his way straight through this building! Even though he's twice as wide as this helicopter so I could easily fly through the hole and maintain pursuit, I think I'll just shoot into the hole and declare Mission Accomplished.\n\nSuddenly GODZILLA bursts out of the OPPOSITE BUILDING and SMASHES TWO HELICOPTERS!\n\nGODZILLA\n\nHa ha, yesss! I just did a lap of the block so I could pull off that cunning flanking manoeuvre, plus a fake scream as they fired at the wrong spot! Still \"just an animal\", though.\n\nAnother HELICOPTER flees wildly away pursued by GODZILLA hot on his heels!\n\nHELICOPTER PILOT #2\n\nI can't shake him! None of my veering side-to-side is working!! Goddammit if only I hadn't missed \"How to Fly Upwards\" Day in training--\n\n(looks around)\n\nOh hey, he's gone! I'm safe!\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\n(on radio)\n\nAre you sure that he isn't crouched down in the street ahead of you, waiting to jump up and bite?\n\nHELICOPTER PILOT #2\n\nOh please. The idea that a two-hundred-foot lizard monster could just sort of hunch a bit and I wouldn't be able to spot him is absolutely-\n\n(chomped)\n\nEXT. NON-CURRENTLY-BEING-STOMPED-BY-KAIJU AREA OF DOWNTOWN NEW YORK\n\nHaving an IDEA, MATTHEW runs into a CONVENIENCE STORE.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nOkay, just gotta loot myself a couple of-\n\nSTORE OWNER\n\nCan I help you, sir?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nWait, youâre open for business? While the cityâs been evacuated? Because of a kaiju attack?\n\nSTORE OWNER\n\nLook at the door, sir. Does the sign say âOpen all hours EXCEPT during the apocalypseâ? No it does not.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nWow. Manhattan shopkeepers donât fuck around.\n\nHe goes back with his purchases to his SCIENCE TENT, where he fiddles around with TEST TUBES for a while. MARIA shows up.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nMaria? What are you doing here?\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nOh it just so happens that I, your ambitious reporter ex who you haven't had contact with in years, thought that today, the day you become centre of the biggest news story of the century, would be a good day to come shoot the breeze. So, how've you been? Become privy to any classified military secrets lately?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nYeah, check it out: it turns out Godzilla's pregnant! I found this out by getting some Godzilla pee or something, and checking it with an ordinary convenience store pregnancy test! Which can be used to determine if a radioactive lizard mutant is carrying eggs, is what we're claiming!\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\n(surreptitiously scribbling notes)\n\nYou don't say. Hey, what's this videotape here, labeled \"CLASSIFIED FIRST GODZILLA SIGHTING TOP SECRET SSHHH\"?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nThat's basically an edited montage of the first few scenes of this movie. Which I've brought to this tent even though it contains zero information I don't already know. Hell, I was there for most of it.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nInteresting, interesting. Now HEY WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE?!\n\n(pockets tape)\n\n(looks at naked wrist)\n\nOh my, is that the time? I have to go, I'm late for my, uh... work... recital... appointment.\n\n(leaves)\n\nShe sprints off with the tape back to the NEWSROOM, where she hands it off to a PRODUCER.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nAwright, this could be a career-maker for me! As such, you'd think I'd stick around and shepherd it through to completion. Y'know, at least make sure the intro and graphics are right or something. But nope, just gonna wander off and assume this will all work out!\n\n(leaves)\n\nINT. BAR, AND NO WE'RE NOT GONNA CANCEL HAPPY HOUR JUST BECAUSE WE MIGHT ALL GET SQUISHED LIKE ANTS ANY MOMENT\n\nMARIA is waiting for her STORY to air, when suddenly it does except HARRY has taken over the story and is airing the VIDEOTAPE as his own!\n\nHARRY SHEARER\n\nThere you have it, an old man muttering \"Godzilla\" at a small flame. Of all the top-secret footage from that video, we decided to lead with that for some reason.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nThat jerk stole the video I rightly stole! And it's \"Gojira\", not \"Godzilla\", what an ignoramus.\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nActually while it's true that traditionally you would transcribe those phonemes into English as \"Gojira\", the fact is that Japanese has an entirely different set of consonants and linguistic rules, so there's no officially accurate way for a westerner to pronounce what that old man said. Technically speaking, \"Godzilla\" is just as acceptable an approximation.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nShut up, me smart and Harry dumb.\n\nINT. MILITARY MEETING\n\nMATTHEW is trying to convince the BIG BRASS about his NEST THEORY, when suddenly they also see the LEAK on the NEWS!\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nMATTHEW YOU FUCKING SMOULDERING HUNK IDIOT!! Since you're bad at secret-keeping, we have no choice but to assume you're also bad at science, and even though all your theories so far have been proven completely accurate we're gonna ignore that nest idea altogether!\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nI feel like I'm not responsible for the fact that a civilian was able to just wander into my tent. What, was I supposed to be in charge of security for some reason?\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nWell why not, you're bizarrely in charge of everything else, or at least you WERE! Now GET OUT!!\n\nThe MILITARY try the BIG PILE O'FISH plan again, but this time GODZILLA recognizes the assortment of TANKS and SOLDIERS as being OWIE GENERATORS and jumps in the RIVER instead!\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\nAttention submarines, fire all torpedoes! And remember if Godzilla comes at you, or directs any torpedoes at other submarines, the best evasive action is to remain completely still!\n\nDespite his best efforts GODZILLA is dealt at least a possible glancing blow that knocks him unconscious! Everyone's radar gleefully displays \"TARGET DESTROYED\" despite the lack of any data to support that conclusion.\n\nMILITARY\n\nHot dog, we killed him! And of course we'll want to immediately send personnel down there to examine the carcass and confirm the kill.\n\nSCIENTISTS\n\nWe also have a whole lot of reasons to go down and salvage that corpse, which is one of the biggest scientific finds of all time!\n\nJOURNALISTS\n\nAnd we are an entire third group of people who would have excellent motivation to get down there as quickly as possible and get photos of the monster's body!\n\nOne can only assume that all of their SUBMERSIBLES get into a PILEUP on their way down, and that's why nobody finds out that there is no GODZILLA CORPSE down there.\n\nEXT. STREET\n\nMATTHEW is being driven towards the corner of SHAME and IGNOMINY, when his driver turns out to be JEAN RENO!\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nOh hey! Still trying desperately to get that English-language career going, huh?\n\nJEAN RENO\n\nUgh, not after this thing. You know what my defining character trait is? FRENCH. I love croissants and hate American food and my assistants are called Jean-Luc and Jean-Claude and Jean-Pierre and Jean-Philippe AND YES MY ACTUAL NAME IS JEAN, THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT NOT A STEREOTYPE\n\n(takes deep breath)\n\nAnyway, we're the French secret service, and we believe your nest theory. Any idea how to locate the nest?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nWell obviously wherever it is, we'll have to destroy it. Or to put it another way, it's a location in a Roland Emmerich movie that's destined to be blown up. Therefore-\n\nJEAN RENO\n\n(slaps forehead)\n\nIt's a famous landmark, of course! To Madison Square Garden!\n\nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\nMATTHEW, JEAN, and JEAN'S DISPOSABLE GOONS arrive at MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, which has been largely DESTROYED, and is soon to be EVEN MORE DESTROYED, because the director has a SERIOUS PROBLEM with this sort of thing.\n\nJEAN RENO\n\nSacre bleu, Godzilla laid a giant pile of eggs in the middle of Madison Square Garden! Who does he think he is, the 2012 New York Rangers har har har?!?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nAnd there's like two hundred eggs, each of them like ten feet tall and five feet wide! Okay, where inside his body was Godzilla carrying all these? There's enough biomass here to make a whole extra half a Godzilla.\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\n(appearing)\n\nHey there! Me and Maria have been following you in our bright red TV van, and while you guys were using cheesy Elvis impersonations to sneak through military checkpoints, we just kinda went around them. What I'm saying is, the French secret service are incompetent bumblefucks.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nWe want to prove your nest theory to the world, to make up for my betraying you for a scoop! Is it weird I'm the only character in this whole movie to have even an inkling of personal growth?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nThis nest is the biggest scoop in the history of journalism. Your being here doesn't prove shit.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nNo really, I'm not thinking of my career anymore, I want to do the right thing and warn everyone about this imminent danger!\n\n(fixes hair)\n\nNow let's send an emergency broadcast beginning with a close-up of me introducing myself and my network, then you'll come in as a human interest angle, our connection will really resonate with viewers. We'll chat a bit, oh and if there's time we'll mention the horde of baby Godzillas about to ravage the city.\n\n(prepares Peabody acceptance speech)\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nWe really are lucky that Godzilla made his nest in a building with its own built-in TV broadcast studio. If he'd chosen MOMA we'd be SOOOOO fucked right now.\n\nThen the EGGS START HATCHING, and a bunch of MINI-GODZILLAS pop out!\n\nDIRECTOR ROLAND EMMERICH\n\nCheck it out, these are just like those raptors from Jurassic Park that everybody likes so much, but mine are way BIGGER! I already made a way better T-rex by making it heaps bigger, now I've outdone their raptors by making them bigger too! Why doesn't every director do this? It's easy as fuck.\n\nJEAN RENO\n\nWhile you contact the military, me and my team of four guys will hold back the entire giant swarm of Raptzillas! Those might seem like laughable odds but our special training will oh whoops my entire team got eaten in three seconds, my GOD we really do suck.\n\nBut then MATTHEW gets an email from KEVIN.\n\nKEVIN DUNN\n\n(in email)\n\nHey guys I saw the footage of the raptzillas that Maria and Hank just broadcast, we're gonna blow up MSG in six minutes. You need to GET OUT, and please note I took the time to format that last part with a larger font, red lettering, and a blinky effect, you actually would have had ten minutes to leave if I'd just sent as plain text.\n\nOur heroes RUN OUT of the building while occasionally LEANING TO ONE SIDE so that the F/X team can add a SNAPPING RAPTZILLA in the shot.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nRemember these creatures are puzzled and scared by basic hijinks and pratfalls! Use cheesy elevator gags, tip over basketball racks, smash gumball machines, drop chandeliers, don't hold back!\n\nThe non-expendable good guys escape, and the RAPTZILLAS get BLOWN UP. Then suddenly GODZILLA pops up out of nowhere, alive and well!\n\nGODZILLA\n\nBoing! Now that the nest subplot has been resolved, I just thought I'd pick this exact moment to conveniently reenter the story. I assume my offspring have finished choosing their souvenirs from the gift shop...\n\n(sees murdered babies)\n\nOH YOU DONE FUCKED UP NOW, DIIIEEE\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nShit! Run away!\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nRun away? On foot? From the monster that was outrunning helicopters earlier?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nIt's okay, for the next thirty seconds he'll be slower than a short human scientist all of a sudden! Then he'll upgrade to being slightly slower than a taxicab, assuming we find one!\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\n(shrugs)\n\nEh, at least I'm not in heels.\n\nThey all RUN until they find a TAXI and HIJACK IT, while GODZILLA gives chase! During this, they manage to contact KEVIN.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\n(on radio)\n\nKevin, I want to inform you where we'll be leading Godzilla, because to reiterate once again, in this movie the military are powerless to locate a kaiju that's currently mid-rampage. Be prepared to attack it at - uh...\n\n(turns to other people in car)\n\nWhat's a famous landmark we haven't destroyed yet?\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nI dunno. The Brooklyn Bridge?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nPerfect!\n\n(back on radio)\n\nKevin, focus absolutely everything on the Brooklyn Bridge, and pray that our route there is unobstructed! Do NOT make any contingency plans!\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nOoh ooh did someone remember to grab my audition tape, which has served its purpose of warning the military and now only helps my career goals?\n\nERNEST BORGNINE\n\n(driving cab)\n\nOh, that tape! Here it is!\n\nJEAN RENO\n\nYoink! Don't worry you can have this tape back, once I've edited out the bit about France doing the nuclear tests that caused Godzilla, which is on a totally different tape.\n\nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE\n\nThe HERO TAXI arrives at the BRIDGE but GODZILLA, having been too slow to catch it, has instead RACED AHEAD and BURSTS THROUGH THE BRIDGE directly in their path!\n\nGODZILLA\n\n(chomps taxi)\n\n(chews taxi)\n\n(does three rapid bites of taxi to create dental impression for mouthguard)\n\n(plays taxi like accordion)\n\n(ties taxi in knot)\n\n(makes origami crane out of taxi)\n\nJEAN RENO\n\n(steel shards and Godzilla teeth barely missing his face, repeatedly)\n\nWell this is another fine mess you've gotten us into, Matthew! Any more bright ideas?\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\nUh... punch it?\n\nThey HIT THE GAS and the TAXI roars out of GODZILLA'S MOUTH, BOUNCES on CONCRETE a few times, gets SLICED INTO NINE PIECES by RESIDENT EVIL LASERS, spontaneously DISSOLVES INTO COMPONENT ATOMS, and comes to a graceful stop on the other side of the bridge.\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nWhew, that was close.\n\nBut GODZILLA is CHARGING ACROSS the remaining bridge to come get them!!\n\nGODZILLA\n\n(annihilating bridge parts)\n\nHa, fuck you, steel beams! Cower as I tear through you like tissue paper!\n\n(tangled)\n\nOH NO STEEL CABLES, I AM RENDERED HELPLESS, WHATEVER SHALL I DO\n\nWith GODZILLA being forced to HOLD STILL for once in the movie, the MILITARY are able to shoot him with like FOUR MISSILES and he drops dead.\n\nMARIA PITILLO\n\nOh wow. So we really did make a Godzilla movie where the reason Godzilla can't be stopped is not because he's almost indestructible, but simply because we've been too incompetent to hit him until now. This is WEAK.\n\nMATTHEW BRODERICK\n\n(tearing up)\n\nLook at the poor guy, as the light dies in his eyes. Farewell, beautiful creature! Audience, aren't you sad that we'll no longer be animating the stupid-looking special effect? Boo hoo!\n\nWILLIAM ATHERTON\n\n(pushing through crowd)\n\nMaria! Future Mrs. Broderick! Now that it's all over, what are your feelings?\n\n(punched in nose)\n\n...Did you get that?\n\nMICHAEL LERNER\n\nEven though all I did was happen to be Mayor of New York while this shit went down, I'm now going to pretend I'm a hero and make this event my entire political identity, hoping it glosses over what a total garbage creepazoid I am! And since that's maybe too subtle I'm changing my name to Giuliani!\n\nHANK AZARIA\n\nI guess even a shitty movie with this many Simpsons actors in it can't help but predict SOMETHING.\n\nEXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\nMeanwhile, back at the smoking wreckage of MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, we find that a SINGLE EGG HAS SURVIVED, because when you're eliminating a threat that could WIPE OUT HUMANITY you obviously don't check that it worked. It HATCHES and a RAPTZILLA EMERGES!\n\nRAPTZILLA\n\nBwa ha ha, that's right, it's not over! This is just the start of a whole franchise of-\n\nAn avalanche of TERRIBLE REVIEWS, AUDIENCE REVULSION, FAN RAGE, BOX OFFICE FAILURE, POP CULTURAL IRRELEVANCE, GETTING REVENGE-KILLED IN THE TOHO MOVIES, and finally GETTING REBOOTED OUT OF EXISTENCE land on its head, killing it instantly.\n\nEND."
