        "text": "Music Worth Its Gold!\n\nOlympic Swimmer Gary Hall gets a little help from composer Alan Rubik\n\nIn Athens, Olympic Gold Medallist Gary Hall, Jr. repeated his gold-medal performance in the 50-meter freestyle. He and his coach Mike Bottom have been using \"CD2000: Music For Your Health\" by LA based composer Alan Roubik to prepare for competition, and have said that it has been an essential part of their training.\n\nGary has type-1 diabetes, and was told that he would never be able to swim competitively again after having become a four-time Olympic medallist. The news was devastating, but he overcame and has become a great champion and role model.\n\nThe composer met Olympic coach Bottom and Gold Medallist Hall sometime in 2001and had a chance to discuss his music with them over dinner.\n\n\"After only a couple of weeks of use at UC Berkley's training facilities, Mike informed me that Gary and other top ranked swimmers had been using the music regularly to better prepare for competition. Mike felt that the music definitely helped the swimmers to relax and get centered before practice,\" says Rubik. Utilizing Magnetic Resonance technology in determining the physiological impact of music, Rubik is able to create mathematically based formulas to compose, arrange and produce therapeutic music.

The new facility, located in Sax' newly adopted hometown of Ojai, 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles, utilizes unique design concepts in the layout and construction of the main studio.\n\n\"What's unique about the room is that there's no console in front of the listener,\" explains Sax, who still maintains his famed Mastering Lab facility in Los Angeles. \"There's no console between you and any of the speakers, including the rears. If you have anything between you and the speaker it's going to cause acoustic problems. You have to listen longer in surround. Psychologically it really helps you concentrate, as you're not looking at knobs and meters and all the stuff that might take you out of just listening.\"\n\nThe surround monitoring system, comprised of five ATC SCM150A loudspeakers and an ATC 15-inch subwoofer for the LFE channel, is installed in a decidedly unique front wall, reports Sax who became familiar with the ATC monitors while working with engineer James Guthrie over the years. \"For many years James brought in his own ATCs when he mastered at The Lab in Hollywood and I did my first surround sound project at his studio near Lake Tahoe. So instead of familiarity breeding contempt, it bred respect!\" ATC is distributed in the U.S. by the TransAudio Group www.transaudiogroup.com\n\nTransAudio Group To Distribute Mercury\n\nTransAudio Group, a leading professional audio distributor to the recording, live sound, and broadcast markets, has been appointed to handle all the sales, marketing, and distribution in the U.S.A. for Hayward, California-based, Mercury Recording Equipment Co. The custom manufacturing company was established by David Marquette of new, used, and vintage recording equipment specialists Marquette Audio Labs to recreate the sonic characteristics, performance, and features of some of the more sought after classic recording gear in brand new, handmade units.\n\nWith classic audio processors such as those originally made by Fairchild, Pultec, and Telefunken/Siemens now difficult to find, expensive to buy, and costly to maintain, Mercury Recording Equipment Co. is dedicated to bringing the sonic and aesthetic character of those devices to new generations through an expanding line of hand-crafted classic recreations. Incorporating similar circuitry, tubes, custom transformers, and design ideas to the originals, all Mercury Recording Equipment products are hand-wired using silver solder, are fully transformer balanced, and feature a distinctive vintage look with powder coating or baked enamel finish with engraved lettering.\n\nThe first units initially introduced by Mercury Recording Equipment, which have all recently been updated, include the Mercury 66, a variable bias-style all-tube, all-transformer compressor similar to the Fairchild 660, and the Mercury EQ-H and EQ-P all-tube, all-transformer equalizers, which pay tribute to early tube EQs such as those made by Pultec. The company has now turned its attention to recreating the classic Telefunken/Siemens studio microphone amplifier modules with the Mercury M72s and the newly introduced M76m.\n\nMarquette has teamed-up with two veteran engineers intimately familiar with vintage analog audio designs in order to produce brand new units that authentically replicate the features, appearance, layout, functionality, and build quality of these revered classics. David Bock, known not only for his great work with Soundelux Microphones, but also with in-studio maintenance of vintage audio gear, and John Hinson, an authority on Telefunken/Siemens modules, Urei/Universal Audio products and original \"Beatles\" Recording Equipment, have helped maintain the Mercury Recording Equipment Co. vision of building superior recording equipment with quality craftsmanship through to the finished product.\n\nTransAudio Group will be showcasing the complete line of Mercury Recording Equipment Co. products at the AES Convention in San Francisco in October at Booth #602. Unlike previous years in which the distributors products were each individually showcased under the Audio Underground banner, TransAudio Group and president, Brad Lunde, will feature the full line of brands in a single large booth featuring manufacturing company representatives and guest audio engineers.

The 6072A is the premiere tube used in Telefunken NA's line of new microphones which faithfully recreate the legendary vintage Telefunken sound.

For McLachlan's longstanding FOH engineer, Gary Stokes, capturing and relaying her voice in the most complimentary manner possible is the most important aspect of his job. According to Stokes, the crucial equipment for this task is the Neumann KMS150 hyper-cardioid microphone matched with True Systems microphone pre-amplifiers. Stokes incorporates 20 channels of True Systems mic pre-amplification into the McLachlan live rig. He utilizes a combination of multiple Precision 8 eight-channel units alongside the P2analog model for what he refers to as \"all the primary channels\" - vocals, acoustic guitars, and crucial drum inputs. Still, Stokes claims that his Neumann KMS150/True Systems combination is the centerpiece of a superior overall mix. \"I found that the True Systems pre-amp was by far the best sounding design in the style of present, in-your-face, clear amps. It provided lots of gain and gave me everything that you can get off of a mic capsule right where you need it. It was a clear winner for me. Because of that we decided to get some more units and use them elsewhere besides on Sarah's vocal,\" says Stokes.\n\nWireless With Heart\n\nSennheiser Mics For Usher, Heart and Wilson Phillips\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nHosted in Miami for the very first time, the 2004 VMAs presented a new challenge to Wireless First, the New York-based RF specialist company headed by Kevin Sanford, who brought in many channels of Sennheiser wireless equipment for the telecast.\n\n\"This year, MTV decided they wanted to do it in the round,\" reports televised awards show veteran, Sanford, who was in charge of all of the RF systems for the show, including wireless performance microphones and personal monitor systems, presenter microphones, and production intercom systems. \"I asked, 'What do you want us to cover?' The answer from MTV production was, 'Everything!'\" He continues, \"We had 24 channels of Sennheiser SKM5000 microphones inside the arena. Those were each fitted with the Neumann KK105-S capsule. We used all Sennheiser 3032-U dual true diversity receivers. We also supplied 12 channels of Evolution 300 Series personal monitor systems.\"\n\nUsher (pictured above) was one of the performers using the Sennheiser SKM5000-N with the Neumann KK105-S capsule. JET, who performed on the show and also took away the award for 'Best Rock Video' for their hit single, \"Are You Gonna Be My Girl,\" utilized most of their arsenal of Evolution Series mics. \"I managed to use our own e945 vocal mics while performing,\" reports the band's FOH engineer, Johnny Haskett. \"We let them put a another mic on the guitars, but we made sure there was an\n\ne609 Silver on there as well!\"\n\nWilson Phillips recently embarked on a promotional tour for the multi-platinum vocal trio's new album release, \"California,\" released at the end of May, and the first release from the band since \"Shadows and Light\" in 1992, includes covers of some of the Golden State's defining pop songs. For the live shows, EW Series vocal microphones demonstrated that the MD935 capsule on the SKM300-G2 handheld transmitter was the best match for the girls' voices. The girls were backed-up by L.A. band The Better Days, led by Carnie Wilson's husband, Rob Bonfiglio, while sister Wendy Wilson's husband, producer Dan Knutson, mixed front-of-house sound.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, legendary rock act Heart is on tour supporting a studio album of brand new material: the critically commended \"Jupiter's Darling\" CD release. For \"Jupiter's Darling\" tour Ann wields a Neumann KMS105/Sennheiser SKM5000-N combo wireless system while Nancy stayed with her longtime favorite, the Sennheiser 3072-U handheld wireless system.\n\nOther rock acts, such as Hoobastank and Yellowcard, who performed back-to-back with JET in a rock 'n roll medley, used only one RF mic. In contrast, notes Sanford, the hip-hop medley, featuring Lil Jon with his East Side Boyz, the Ying Yang Twins, Petey Pablo, and Terror Squad, used 14 RF mics.\n\nSanken On The Road\n\nPaul Baldwin travels all over the world working on such shows as the Superbowl, 60 Minutes, 20/20, 48 Hours, National Geographic, and Cops. One of his specialties is the \"sit-down\" interview and his microphones of choice are Sanken, in particular the new CS-1 short shotgun and the COS-11 lavalier. \"I often use both a lavalier on the speaker and a shotgun on a boom, just out of the shot,\" Baldwin explains. \"I put the lav on track one and the shotgun on track two so that the editor can choose which works best. For example, a woman who is softspoken might sound better with a boom, while someone with a loud voice would sound good with a lavalier.\"\n\nArtists In The House At Avatar\n\nOnce again Avatar was host to the stars...\n\nL-R: Usher, Paul Anthony (Full Force) at Avatar\n\nEdie Brickell recently in studio A (Neve 8068) recording with producer Charlie Sexton and engineer Brian Scheuble.

(NASDAQ: AVID) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Midiman, Inc., doing business as M-Audio  a leading provider of digital audio and MIDI solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals. At closing, Avid will pay approximately $80 million in cash, issue approximately 2 million shares of Avid common stock, and assume all outstanding M-Audio stock options. The deal also includes earn-out provisions, which would be payable to M-Audios equity holders based on the successful achievement of certain financial milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, M-Audio will become a business unit of Avids Digidesign audio division and market its line of computer audio peripherals, PCI sound cards, keyboard controllers and control surfaces, microphones, speakers, and distributed software and proprietary sound libraries alongside Digidesigns award-winning digital audio workstations for the professional and home/hobbyist markets.\n\n2004 marks Digidesigns 20th anniversary. In 1984, Digidesigns founders Evan Brooks and Peter Gotcher set out to expand the sounds of their drum machine and make enough money through the sales of drum sound replacement chips to finance their own recording dreams. The result was the founding of a company that revolutionized the way that audio was recorded, edited and mixed  first with Sound Designer, and then with the advent of Pro Tools® digital audio workstation technology. Today, Digidesign is the leader in digital audio recording, and Pro Tools has become the audio production standard for music and post professionals around the world. Digidesign provides the music, broadcast, multimedia and film industries with Oscar® and Grammy® award-winning software and hardware for audio creation, production, and distribution.\n\nMonét At Studio City Sound\n\nWith Scarlett Pomers, from the \"Reba\" television show on the WB network\n\nFourteen year old Monét Lerner, backed by her three piece powerhouse had three return appearances at the world-famous Whisky a GOGO (9/14, 23 and 10/20th coming up at 8:45pm!). \"She displays all of the talent and strength of a seasoned veteran\", says New Music Weekly magazine.

Photo by Eugene Wang. According to the composer, the film spans Kerry's entire life. \"I needed to prepare music that supported the images being seen on the screen and to engender a sense of patriotism and service. I used a 19-piece string orchestra, plus two woodwinds and a trumpet player; Firehouse Studios'\n\nspacious Studio 'A' was the perfect environment for the recordings,\" says composer Nathan Wang. Wang had only five days to prepare soundtrack music for the video documentary, and was working down to the wire. \"Because of last-minute edit changes, I did not receive a locked picture until late in the process; director James Moll was finalizing his vision until the last possible minute.\"\n\nAll tracks were recorded, edited and mixed using Firehouse's Digidesign Pro Tools digital audio workstations for instant replay and sample-accurate editing. \"I also brought in some pre-recorded French horn, bassoon and piano elements recorded on Pro Tools - these tracks were plug-and-play compatible with the live sessions.\"\n\nWang has composed music for several Jackie Chan movies, plus cartoons and animated series, including \"Bruno the Kid,\" \"Felix the Cat\" and DreamWorks'\n\n\"Toonsylvania,\" in addition to the Emmy-nominated \"American Family\" for PBS, starring Edward James Olmos. \"A Remarkable Promise\" aired in primetime on Thursday, July 29, 2004\n\nA Mercenary Having A Birthday!\n\nFletcher mixing four-inch 16-track with Longview Farm's Neve 8078; Mercenary today; Samara in MethLab; O' Mercy!\n\nMercenary Aydio has gone from a brokerage to a dealership, though manufacturing and product distribution and a custom repair shop to somehow land on its feet as a nearly functional \"dot com\" providing only new equipment to clients worldwide.

Capone, 38 died early on September 2nd when his Harley-Davidson collided with a car in the Van Nuys area of the city.\n\nThe president of the Latin Recording Academy, Gabriel Abaroa, released a statement in response to Capone's death, which occurred just hours after two albums he produced garnered awards. \"The Latin Recording Academy, Brazilian music and the world have lost a great music maker with the passing of multiple Latin Grammy-winning producer Tom Capone,\" Abaroa said.\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro resident was up for \"Producer of the Year\" and four other awards at the fifth annual Latin Grammys. Two albums he produced won Latin Grammys -- Maria Rita's self-titled debut in the Brazilian popular music category, and Skank's \"Cosmotron,\" which was named best Brazilian rock album.\n\nBut with five nominations for the fifth annual Latin Grammy Awards, the multitalented producer is not only the most nominated individual this year but also the most nominated Brazilian ever. But Capone is not just a producer and an engineer. He's also a musician and the director of A&R for Warner Music Brazil.\n\n\"I have total support from my boss, Claudio Conde, who allows me to produce some albums during the year,\" said the late producer.\n\nCapone got into music playing the guitar and producing for a band called Peter Perfeito in the 1980s. He later opened his own studio and began producing full time. When Warner Music Brazil asked him to be A&R director in 1998, he accepted on the condition that he be allowed to produce albums for other labels. The list of acts he has worked with includes Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento, Raimundos, Barao Vermelho, Nando Reis, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Lenine.\n\nBut the project that has thrust Capone's name into international consciousness is \"Maria Rita,\" the self-titled debut album by the daughter of singer Elis Regina (1945-82), a superstar of Brazilian popular music. Released in 2003 on Warner, it has sold 640,000 copies, according to the label. \"The main thing is Maria Rita's voice,\" Capone said. \"And we also have her totally intuitive and yet precise perception of the arrangements. Great parts of the repertoire, as well as the jazz trio ensemble, were taken from her live concerts.\"\n\nCapone is survived by his wife, musician Constanca Scofield, a month-old son and two other children from a previous marriage.\n\nHello Love Birds\n\nCongrats to Mr & Mrs Zinkhann!\n\nLA studio vets, Caroline Khesse (Roylatone, The Mix Room) and Chad Zinkhann (known for his tech work in some of LA's premiere studios), tied the knott last month! The newlyweds will move to Colorado. We wish them continued happiness and success. Rocky Mountain Pro Audio community should welcome this dynamic duo. Know any cool studios or producers in Colorado who could use help booking their studio or have production coordination or management needs, send an email to Caroline.\n\nHow can all this technology truly improve the human condition?\n\n\"In the same way that the arts do. It's a mechanism that allows us to observe ourselves, a reflection of our politics, our daily lives. It helps show us at our best and our worst, and pushes us to develop ourselves. Music has such power to make the best of life. The future lies in dealing with each other through knowledge and wisdom.\""
