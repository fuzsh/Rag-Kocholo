        "text": "Family & Children's Counseling Services is preparing to build a new multi-million-dollar headquarters facility on Main Street in Binghamton.\n\nAccording to the agency's original plan, a two-story 9,000-square-foor building is to be constructed at 259 Main Street.\n\nConstruction equipment arrived at the site of the project on Monday. A groundbreaking ceremony is to be held later this week.\n\nThe facility will be built on the site of an apartment house that was destroyed by a meth-related fire in February 2013.\n\nAt least 50 people were left homeless as a result of the blaze, which police investigators said was started by a 36-year-old man who was cooking methamphetamine in his girlfriend's apartment.\n\nThe counseling agency was founded as The Family & Children's Society in 1941.\n\nThe new building will be constructed just west of the existing Family & Children's building.\n\nWhen the expansion project was announced last May, the projected cost was $5 million. The total price tag for the project is expected to be higher, although agency officials were not available to discuss the anticipated cost.\n\nSome funding for the new facility is being provided by the state, county and city governments.\n\nContact WNBF News reporter Bob Joseph: bob@wnbf.com or (607) 545-2250.

In an age of flipping the script on societal norms, many of these actresses are using their voices and platforms to be advocates for those who are otherwise unheard."
