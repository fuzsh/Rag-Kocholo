        "text": "It finally happened. A whole freaking century of existence. People like Pat Powers, P. L. Travers, Ben Shapiro, and Bob Chapek tried to destroy it. Commercial failures like The Black Cauldron, Strange World, Home on the Range, and Treasure Planet caused them to stumble. We’ve seen them try to sell us terrible things like the second incarnation of Journey into Imagination, a Maui body suit, Mickey Mouse gas masks, and movies with premium access fees on Disney+. They’ve stayed abreast amid multiple controversies, like cast member pay, copyright law, working with China for the Mulan remake, and the accusations of being an anti-semite. And yet through it all, they’ve committed to making art (which is always up for debate), and they remain in business thanks to their unerring ability to touch our hearts. Disney has been happy to flash that magical three-digit number everywhere to impress its clientele, but arguably its true moment to celebrate was a short that premiered on ABC on October 15th, then on Disney+ the following day. That short was Once Upon a Studio.\n\nThe short starts with Mickey and Minnie Mouse hopping out of a framed photo and plan a group photo to celebrate the anniversary. Soon, 543 characters from various shorts and movies hop to life and gather outside the Roy O. Disney Animation Building.\n\nIt’s a great short. There’s a lot it does right. I’d hesitate to say it does anything wrong, but I do have some notes. But let’s talk about the good stuff.\n\nRobin Williams. In its number one selling point in their marketing hype, Disney shared with the public that a never-before-used archival recording of Robin Williams he did for Aladdin would be unearthed exclusively for this short. To the average Joe, this was incredible news. Robin passed in 2014, nine years ago, and our hearts have ached ever since. The Genie was one of his most career-defining roles, and no matter how hard others tried, no one could pull it off as well as he did. But there’s more to it than that. Jeffrey Katzenberg and Disney proper went out of their way to screw over the comedian during production, as the man had terms and conditions they didn’t feel like abiding by. The man recorded hours upon hours of gags and skits and jokes that didn’t get used in the final film, and when he died, it was revealed that Robin had one last “screw you” for the company: absolutely none of those recordings could be used without permission from his estate for 25 years after his death, in 2039. So clearly, they got the stamp of approval from Williams’ family and legal team, and we got to hear an original Robin joke from him.\n\nBut it gets better. Genie shares screen time with Olaf from Frozen. Olaf’s actor, Josh Gad, tweeted about the sensitivity of the situation, adding that he got into voice acting thanks to Robin. The man got to share screen time with his idol and said if he had any concern that this was not done above board, and with reverence, he would not have participated.\n\nBut it goes even deeper. Seconds before the Genie explodes onto the screen, the most surprising cameo (to me) was seeing Robin the lost boy. I’ve talked at length about this before, but as a recap: Robin Williams appeared alongside Walter Cronkite in a 1989 short film called Back to Neverland that played only at Disney-MGM Studios’ Magic of Disney Animation attraction through 2004. In that short, Robin tells Walter he loves Peter Pan, and thus, the legendary news anchor walks him through the process, making him a lost boy facing Captain Hook. The short was so influential that Williams’ vacation clothes – a loud, yellow Hawaiian shirt and a Goofy hat – were made an Easter egg in Aladdin‘s finale. And to see Robin, the lost boy, make a brief appearance, particularly alongside the Genie and one of Robin’s biggest fans was a hell of a treat.\n\nThe commitment to the original artistry. The loss of 2D animation has remained a difficult pain for many Disney fans. Aside from the smattering of animated projects like the three Goofy shorts from 2020, we haven’t seen a hand-drawn animated movie since 2011’s Winnie the Pooh. Once again, the animation team showed what they do best and made these characters look as good as they’ve ever been. From what I can see, Disney brought back various animators who were the original supervising animators of their respective characters like Will Finn (Iago and Cogsworth), Eric Goldberg (The Genie), James Baxter (Belle), Ruben Aquino (Ursula), Nik Ranieri (Hades, Kuzco, and Lumiere), Tony Bancroft (Pumbaa), and Alex Kuperschmidt (Stitch). Almost none of the characters looked off-model or even carelessly scrawled.\n\nIt’s worth drawing attention to how well the CGI characters like Antonio Madrigal, Sisu the dragon, Moana, Flash the Sloth, and Fix-it Felix interacted with their hand-drawn co-stars, but for me, one slightly imperceptible detail got me hella stoked. During the trailer released a month prior, I gawked at Colonel Hathi and Winnifred (‘Cause Jungle Book fans gotta stan) when I saw a flickering line down the front of Winnifred’s trunk. An animation error? Yes and no. To streamline the animation process, Disney developed the Xerox process, which allowed animators’ drawings to be copied straight to the animation cels. This meant they were charged with erasing as much of their construction lines as they could, but this left characters from 101 Dalmatians in 1961 to Oliver & Company in 1988 with a very scratchy texture and flickering lines. In the short proper, I saw this on Merlin, too. Really think about that level of dedication when it would have been SO MUCH EASIER to make all the 2D characters look like they were drawn the same. Particularly for an effect most people can’t identify or even see.\n\nThe voice cast. I’m always kind of mystified at how Disney regards their voice casts. On one hand, they do everything within their power to get back OG actors to reprise roles, whether it’s the latest Kingdom Hearts game, the newest ride at California Adventure, or latest spinoff in the franchise. And this short was no exception. It wasn’t just Robin Williams. I fully expected Bill Farmer (Goofy and Pluto), Josh Gad (Olaf), Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh), James Woods (Hades), Jodi Benson (Ariel), Scott Adsit (Baymax), Anika Noni-Rose (Tiana), Scott Weinger (Aladdin) and Auli’i Cravalho (Moana). I didn’t expect but am not at all surprised hearing the vast array of archival recordings I fully recognized from their original source material, such as Eric Blore (Mr. Toad), Jeremy Irons (Scar), Pat Carroll (Ursula), My Hero Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh, Kaa, Cheshire Cat), Dwayne Johnson (Maui), David Spade (Kuzco), Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan) Verna Felton (Flora), Billy Joel (Dodger) Barbara Luddy (Merriweather), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins).\n\nStill, many of their replacements were pretty good. Alan Tudyk’s King Candy made him perfect as the Mad Hatter. I’ve heard Bob Joles as Bagheera in The Jungle Book 2, and I think he did decent as Cogsworth. I miss Ed Gilbert, and while Jim Cummings wouldn’t have been my first choice as Baloo, I wasn’t able to tell right away. No one can replace Gilbert Gottfried, yet that was Piotr Mixhael as Iago. But the biggest surprises were the actors they DID bring aboard and the ones they chose to leave silent. For example, Nathan Lane has a ton of stage and screen credits, to the point where Timon from The Lion King is barely a blip on his resumé, but he calls Olaf “Frosty”. On the flip side, Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa) was not present, despite he’s front and center most every Lion King appearance, and his biggest screen credit is (Arguably) the naked guy on the subway in that one episode of Seinfeld. Corey Burton has voiced Captain Hook reliably since the eighties, and yet he’s silent here. Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jason Bateman are all busy actors, but they still took time out of their schedules to drop by for Anna, Elsa, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde. It was cool hearing Richard White again as Gaston. Little Ravi Cabot-Conyers reappeared as little Antonio Madrigal. I was shocked Tom Hulce returned as Quasinodo. Daisy Duck hardly had any screen time, much less with her official performer, Tress Macnielle. Regardless, what we did get was a treat for the ears.\n\nThe cameos I didn’t expect. Here’s what I’ve learned from what I call “Ain’t Disney Great” projects: with a catalog as vast and popular as Disney’s, whenever they want to put together a montage or group shot of a wide array of Disney animated characters, it’s expected they limit characters by most popular and little further. Mulan fans will rarely see more beyond Mulan and Mushu. 101 Dalmatians are almost wholly represented by Cruella DeVil, Pongo and Perdita. As a Jungle Book fan, I’m lucky I get King Louie, as most of the time, it’s just Baloo and Mowgli. If you love Emperor’s New Groove, Atlantis, The Rescuers, or Chicken Little, you’re just about guaranteed to be out of luck. But the stops were most certainly pulled out, drawing from literally all 62 animated features from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to November’s Wish. Not even including Mickey and pals, there were a surprising number of cameos from projects I didn’t even think they would acknowledge. I already mentioned Robin the lost boy. Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet? Cool. Art and Dot from 2021’s Us Again? Surprising. Susie the Little Blue Coupe? Startling. Lambert the Sheepish Lion? Nuts! And it didn’t stop there! The Reluctant Dragon! Pedro the Mail Plane! John Henry! Katrina van Tassel and Brom Bones! George from Paperman! Gopher from Winnie the Pooh! Nessie! John, Duke, Susie, and Joe from Fantasia 2000‘s Rhapsody in Blue sequence! Small One! Paul from Inner Workings! Wayne and Lanny from Prep and Landing! Slue Foot Sue! So many of these characters are hard to identify, even if you’re a hard-core Disnerd like me. And yet, here they are!\n\nOne set of characters I want to bring up is the cast of Tarzan. Tarzan, Terk, Tantor, Jane, Kala, Kerchack, and Clayton all appear in the final cast photo. Tarzan is still under copyright by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate. Thus, Disney refuses to do anything with them to avoid paying royalties. It would have been a pretty glaring oversight to not include them, sure, but it was super nice to see them once again.\n\nThat moment with Walt. The moment that certainly got everyone directly in the feels was right after Rapunzel conked Kaa on the head with her skillet. Mickey catches sight of a large photo of Walt Disney, and he looks on with heartfelt appreciation. What I liked about this moment most was how simple and quiet it was.\n\nIt would have been so damn easy to drop in an AI Walt spouting one of his oft-capitalized catchphrases, shaking hand with Mickey, but luckily, it was reeled in to just a momentary calm moment amid the insanity of the chaos. It was pretty reverent and respectful that way. Kudos.\n\nNow that we took care of all the cool stuff, I want to share my notes. Nothing bad, of course. Just bear with me, if you please.\n\nThe cameos that didn’t happen.\n\nBefore I start this entry, let me start by addressing two things. One, as I addressed in my Kingdom Hearts list, I understand I have an issue with never being satisfied with my Disney crossovers. Whether it’s House of Mouse, Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, or Once Upon a Time, after the thrill of seeing a huge Disney crossover, it wears off pretty quickly as I start to pick apart who was there and who wasn’t. I totally get that’s a flaw on my part and mine alone; this is just me warning you, dear reader. Second, I’m not going to be so pedantic as to say something like “Well, for Meet The Robinsons, they had Carl the Robot, Lewis, Wilbur, Bowler Hat Guy, and Lucille Krunklehorn…but where’s Francine? Uncle Art? Goob? Lefty the Octopus? ZERO OUT OF TEN!!” Of course not. That’d be pathetic. So as a rule, I allowed entries from projects that simply weren’t represented.\n\nRoger Rabbit\n\nThis was arguably the number one character I’ve heard people ask about. And given we saw animated characters from live-action/animated hybrid movies, to see the titular character from the gold standard of crossovers himself was surprising. That is, until you dig a little deeper.\n\nYou might have noticed no characters from literally any subsidiary of the company were involved. Despite the anniversary was for the company as a whole, they stuck to purely to Walt Disney Animation Studios. That means no Muppets, no Lucasfilm, no Marvel, and no Pixar. Who Framed Roger Rabbit was animated at Elstree Studios in LA, and later London, neither of which are WDAS. To top it off, the movie was a coproduction between Disney and Amblin Entertainment, and even then, under Touchstone Pictures. Even today, neither studio can seem to agree on who owns the rights. But it seems it’s already enough that old Roger wasn’t drawn anywhere near WDAS, thus excluding him entirely.\n\nGiselle\n\n2007’s Enchanted was also not animated by WDAS, but unlike Roger, it was released directly under the Walt Disney Pictures banner. Also, you might have noticed Giselle was never promoted to official Disney princess. This is because if you recall in the movie, Amy Adam’s doesn’t just play Giselle, she is Giselle: her animated self had to look like her. Because of this, if Disney wanted to make merchandise or further projects with her, they’d need to secure legal rights to Amy Adam’s face, which would be expensive and likely not worth it.\n\nJulius the Cat\n\nI knew they were going to do whatever they could to celebrate the antiquity of the studio, but I worried they weren’t going to go all the way back. As you might’ve guessed, the anniversary goes all the way back to 1923. Mickey didn’t star in Steamboat Willie until five years later. Oswald appeared in the short, but he only goes back to 1927. The oldest still-working Disney character is Pegleg Pete, who first popped in a 1925 Alice comedy. How could they fill in that 2-year gap? Well, the Alice Comedies may have starred a live-action girl, but she had a sidekick in most of them: a spunky cat named Julius who actually goes as far back as the old Laugh-O-Grams shorts back in Kansas City in 1922. It would have been great to solidly mark the full centennial, but even I couldn’t expect his showing up rationally. He’s the sidekick, not the star. He looks more like Felix the Cat. He’s too nondescript. Literally a whole gag segment would be devoted to just identifying who he is, since even the most seasoned Disney stans wouldn’t have been able to tell at first blush.\n\nMilton\n\nCharacters like John Henry, Lambert, Susie the Little Blue Coupe, Paul, Dot and Art, Nessie and George were all one-shot characters. But Milton appeared in three cartoons alongside Mickey’s pal Pluto. A relatively uninteresting character, Milton was a cat who provided some conflict as a sort of mischievous adult alley cat. Unlike Figaro, a kitten, the fights between them wouldn’t be ridiculously one-sided. Like I said, he only lasted three shorts (Plutopia, Cold Turkey, and Puss Café), but his impact has been pretty minimal. Still, it’s three times more than Lambert or Susie.\n\nOrtensia\n\nThis one is arguably my biggest nitpick. With Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy, all the princes and princesses, it just seemed like a jerk move to add Oswald, but not his girlfriend.\n\nProfessor Owl\n\nThis one is the one I acknowledge with the most sincerity. Sure, Professor Owl only cropped up in just two shorts: Adventures in Music: Melody and the Oscar-winning Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom, both in 1953. But he gained greater fame about 35 years later as one of the hosts in the wraparound segments on the Disney Sing-Along Songs videos. He got famous enough to even appear in the intro of House of Mouse in 2001, and not even in a subtle way, either.\n\nThe Br’ers.\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time I mentioned anything Song of the South related on this blog… Yeah, I’m doing it again. I’m completely aware Disney is trying HARD to wipe their hands clean of these guys, but it’s no use: you can shut down the rides, delete the songs, and fail to include them on the company’s biggest crossover ever. But at the end of the day, the movie exists, and it was a milestone in the early decades of the company’s history. To keep ignoring them and cramming them into the crawlspace under the stairs is not a viable long-term solution.\n\nThe jokes I would’ve written.\n\nI love writing fan fiction. I love writing a story and planning out how each character would react in a given situation based on what I understand about them. Because I love my Disney crossovers, the very idea of penning a special like this would have involved me disappearing for a whole weekend and coming back with 40 tomes of notes, jokes, suggestions, scribbles, pitches, on how to make a funny, dramatic, compelling saga involving characters from all 62+ films. But I get it: I’m certain the writers were similarly passionate, and probably a lot of stuff got cut simply for time or wanted greater focus on visuals rather than dialogue. And yet, I can’t help but expound upon the types of jokes I saw or come up with new ones. At the risk of being super insulting to the writers…\n\n1. There was that great scene where Rapunzel conks Kaa on the head when he hypnotizes Clarabelle. I’m not sure who suggested her, but because she’s a cow, why not see the aftermath? Rapunzel chuckles, swinging the skillet with gusto, only to find Calarabelle is gone. Where is she? Well, Alameda Slim from Home on the Range – who can hypnotize cows and only cows with a hypnotic yodel – is prancing down the hall, singing “Yodel-Adle-Eedle-Idle-oo”, with Calarabelle giddily dancing behind. Rapunzel huffs, chuckles, grips her pan tight, and follows.\n\n2. We saw Luisa from Encanto hoisting the Home on the Range cows, Cyril Proudbottom, Rutt and Tuke, and Small One on her shoulders in one shot. I can picture Tigger encouraging Eeyore to keep up, with the donkey sluggishly mumbling that he’s coming. Suddenly, he’s flung high up and onto Luisa’s shoulders. Luisa chuckles, telling Tigger that one day, there’ll be a donkey she won’t have to carry. Just then, Little Burrito – the flying donkey from The Three Caballeros – glides by, and they both laugh.\n\n3. After swiping Scrooge McDuck/Ebenezer Scrooge’s moneybags, Robin Hood and Little John stroll down the hall when LJ asks, “Hey Rob, ever get Deja vu?” After they pass by, Baloo asks his mancub buddy, “Hey Lil” Britches, ever get Deja vu?”\n\n4. After Wreck-it Ralph stumbles out the building, he narrowly avoids getting hit by several crumbling bricks. He looks up and sees Willie (Mickey and the Beanstalk), Gustav (The Brave Little Tailor), and Paul Bunyan are bored and waiting impatiently, with drumming fingers causing structural damage. Ralph, of course, shouts, “Hey! You’re gonna wreck it!”\n\n5. We saw Mr. Toad giddily taking Aladdin’s magic carpet for a whirl. Suppose he crashes carpet, and looks up to find…Vanellope von Schweetz’ car, the Lickety Split. Toad is enraptured with longing. Cut to Vanellope and Oliver & Company‘s Dodger enjoying some hot dogs from the cafeteria, skipping back to the car, only to find J. Thaddeus Toad has…eaten most of it.\n\n6. As Robin the lost boy flies along, he breezes by Captain Hook, upsetting his hat. He and Mr. Smee are strolling down the hallway when Smee anxiously reminds his boss that Mickey wants EVERYONE there. Hook casually assures his underling that he has officially gotten over his fear of “that infernal crocodile.” Louis from Princess and the Frog almost bumps into them, pleasantly greeting, “Hey, y’all!” This, of course, causes the pirate to wail in abject terror.\n\n7. Belle and the Beast share a tender moment in the hall when Rutt and Tuke, the moose from Brother Bear, wander by. Rutt asks if she’s the mermaid. Tuke answers, “Beauty, eh.” Rutt responds, “Beauty. So she’s the sleepy one, right?”\n\n8. Taran from The Black Cauldron boasts to prince Phillip and Hercules about his heroic deeds with his sword while Eilonwy looks on, rolling her eyes. A wild swing of his sword gets it caught in the door. Taran can’t budge it free, but Wart from Sword in the Stone jostles it free easily and politely hands it back. As Taran sheepishly chuckles, the other three laugh good-naturedly.\n\n9. The sprite from Fantasia 2000 and Isabela Madrigal are working together to grow some greenery and beautify the surrounding area for the photo. As Minnie drops by and compliments their work, she warns them to go easy on the vines. As Isabela asks why, Tarzan swings by, doing his trademark yell, and scatters the flowers everywhere. Upset at first, the girls laugh heartily instead.\n\nMake no mistake: I know these things are work. Writers and animators et al should be paid what they’re worth. I’m just some punk online armchair animating for something that was already pretty damn awesome to begin with. So I’m not just some whiny troll, just a fan with an ADHD-riddled brain that won’t quit his hyperfocused fandom of choice.\n\nWhat were the stakes, exactly?\n\nConflict makes for the best entertainment, as a conflict begs the question “How can this be solved,” whether it’s a problem or a genuine battle. The whole purpose of this short was not really to tell a story, but to showcase 543 animated characters. I’ve always been of the mindset that a story need only be as good as a vehicle to let characters be characters, and I still stand by that. But the only real conflict comes in late when Goofy accidentally breaks the camera, and everyone starts to leave as though there’s no options left anymore. With all the characters with various skills and powers in virtually every capacity, it seems kind of silly that characters, even ones as pessimistic as Grumpy and Eeyore, would just give up right away.\n\nSince they were doing this after hours, maybe they could have tried to keep things down to avoid being seen. Maybe the villains could’ve hijacked the plan to make it a villains photo shoot, thinking they were going to be left out of it, only for Mickey to remind them that this is for everyone. I dunno, that was just two ideas that I came up with off the top of my head. A broken camera wasn’t a terrible plot point, but I thought they could have made it a touch more engaging with a little something extra. That’s all.\n\nFor Burny.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch upon is this short was dedicated to Burny Mattinson. Martinson was the elderly gentlemen who bemused about if the walls at the studio could talk before he and the intern leave for the day. More importantly, Burny worked at the studio for 7 straight decades, from 1953, all the way until his death earlier this year, in February of 2023. It’s a powerful reminder of the legacy that this short represented.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was a great short and I was very happy to see so much representation of so many Disney characters, even if it wasn’t as much as I imagined it could be. But once again, I get it. That’s my hang-up and mine alone. This short was a great way of commemorating a century of Disney, and judging from the general public’s reaction to Disney in 2023, was by far the best yet.\n\nCongrats, Walt. You done good.\n\nBecause 100 just wasn’t enough. Let’s see what else you might not know about voice acting and working for Disney!\n\n1. Guido Luigi Emanuele Caselotti was an Italian immigrant and a singing instructor in Los Angeles when he got call from the Walt Disney studios in 1935. He was asked if he knew of any girls who could sing like a child. Just then, a girl’s voice on the line volunteered. His 18-year-old daughter, Adrianna, was listening in on the upstairs phone, and thus, she was cast as Disney’s first princess and the fairest one of all, Snow White.\n\n2. After a session of voicing Winnie the Pooh, Sterling Holloway was called on by Walt himself to see what he could do about a troublesome snake character in their upcoming Jungle Book adaptation. Holloway, the ninth in line to give it a whirl, came up with the idea to make a gag about his back pain, since…well, pythons are mostly spines. This clinched him the role of Kaa.\n\n3. If I had a nickel for every time Paul Reubens (AKA Pee-Wee Herman) voiced an AI unit piloting an alien spaceship in a Disney property, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice, right? (RX-24 in the original Star Tours attraction and Trimaxion in 1986’s Flight of the Navigator)\n\n4. Alan Young had co-written his own version of A Christmas Carol for Disneyland records, called An Adaptation of Dickens’ Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players, released in 1974. Young also played Ebenezer Scrooge as well as Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and Ghost of Christmas Past. Several years later, Young was called in by Disney to play Scrooge in an animated adaptation of that adaptation, and was surprised it was his own script. Young reprised the role of the greedy miser, and in 1987, with the premiere of DuckTales, Scrooge McDuck was his own character to voice right up through No, a Mickey Mouse cartoon that was released in 2016, the same year he passed away.\n\n5. Sherri Stoner has had a fairly active career as an actress before becoming a writer on Steven Spielberg’s Animaniacs. She was even the voice of Slappy the Squirrel. But before then, she was the live-action model for Ariel.\n\n6. Dallas McKennon was a very versatile character performer, often playing nutty characters, with his most famous performance as Cincinnatus in the Daniel Boone series in 1964. For animation, he was the original performer for Gumby and Pokey. But even if you aren’t familiar with his Disney roles like the fishing bear in Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) or the fox in Mary Poppins (1964), I guarantee you you’ve heard him before. You know that high-pitched, insane cackle the hyena in Lady and the Tramp (1955) lets out when Lady almost gets chomped on by an alligator? That laugh was used in a multitude of productions, such as the Crash Bandicoot video games (Ripper Roo), Tourist Trap (Closet mannequin), and Elf (Jack in the Box). But barring even all that, who do you think tells you to watch yer personal belongings on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad because it’s “the WILDEST RIDE in the WILDERNESS!”?\n\n7. Maurice Chevalier was a personal friend of Walt Disney. When he died in 1966, Chevalier came out of retirement to sing the theme song for The AristoCats (1970) to honor his friend.\n\n8. Disney tries as hard as they can to retain the same actors for repeat performances for consistency, unlike Warner Brothers, who regularly recast their Looney Tunes characters in most every new project. Characters like the princesses are the most reliable, and in Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), we saw the return of Jodi Benson (Ariel), Linda Larkin (Jasmine), Irene Bedard (Pocahontas), Ming-Na Wen (Mulan), Anika Noni-Rose (Tiana), Mandy Moore (Rapunzel), Kelly MacDonald (Merida), Kristen Bell (Anna), Idina Menzel (Elsa), and Auli’i Cravalho (Moana). Only Adrianna Caselotti (Snow White), Ilene Woods (Cinderella), and Mary Costa (Aurora) failed to return since they had since passed away.\n\n9. In Frozen II (2019), Josh Gad improvised the bit about looking for Samantha. A few weeks after its release, Gad posted a tweet announcing he finally found her… She was apparently a skipper on Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise.\n\n10. Walt Disney knew Phil Harris socially, and when Harris was asked to play Baloo in The Jungle Book (1967), Harris grew frustrated because the bear was written similarly to the Kipling version of Baloo: Gruff, no-nonsense, and serious. Harris left. About a week later, he was begged to return at Walt’s behest, but this time, Harris asked to read it like himself. This became the lackadaisical, freewheeling, carefree ursine we know and love today. A characterization so appealing he essentially reprised the role in to a T in the following two releases: Thomas O’Malley in The AristoCats (1970) and Little John in Robin Hood (1973).\n\n11. You might be familiar with character actor Jim Varney, whose best known performance is Ernest P. Worrell in the Ernest franchise (Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Scared Stupid, Ernest Saves Christmas, etc.) Not only was the Christmas movie filmed at Disney-MGM Studios, but he took on the Disney theme parks again in a 1989 made-for-television promotional special where Ernest takes the first test run plunge on Splash Mountain at Disneyland. In 1995, he joined the voice acting ranks as Woody’s pal Slinky Dog in Toy Story (1995) and Toy Story 2 (1999). In 2001’s Atlantis: the Lost Empire, Varney played Cookie, the crew’s cook, but he passed in 2000 before he could finish the role. His friend Blake Clark dubbed one line in Atlantis (“I ain’t so good at speechifyin'”), and actor Steve Barr has taken over the role for the plastic hound dog in subsequent Toy Story productions.\n\n12. Mary Wickes was a very busy comedienne in numerous sitcoms and plays thanks to her impeccable comedic timing, lanky build, and acerbic tone. She utilized these assets as the live action model for Cruella DeVil in 101 Dalmatians (1961), though the fashionista was voiced by Betty Lou Gerson, who did the opening narration for Cinderella in 1950. Mary returned to Disney for Sister Act (1992) and its sequel as Sister Mary Lazarus. But her final film role was that of Laverne the gargoyle in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Sadly, Wickes passed away before her work was completed, and Jane Withers filled in for her.\n\n13. Several famous faces were at Disneyland on opening day, August 17th, 1955. Aside from Ronald Reagan, Art Linkletter, Frank Sinatra, Fess Parker, and Buddy Ebsen, we saw Jerry Colonna (the March Hare in Alice in Wonderland) was riding a train, Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan) was riding a ship in Fantasyland, and Alan Young (Scrooge McDuck) just got off Peter Pan’s Flight. And no, Young wasn’t a time traveler (That we know of…) … he was renowned at the time for starring in Mr. Ed.\n\n14. Jim Cummings was working at a video store in Anaheim Hills when he handed off his demo tape to a friend. While Don Bluth Studios passed on it, a few weeks later, a phone call from the Disney Channel offered him his first acting roles as Q. T the Orangutan and Lionel the Lion in 1984’s Dumbo’s Circus TV show. Thus began a lifelong career of voicing a flurry of beloved Disney characters such as Darkwing Duck, Zummi Gummi, Pete, Winnie the Pooh, Ed the hyena, Scar (singing), Rasoul the palace guard, Hondo Ohnaka, chief Powhatan (Singing), Ray the firefly, Don Karnage, Fat Cat, Professor Nimnul, NegaDuck, Bonkers D. Bobcat, Lucky Piquel, Nessuss the Centaur, Kaa, Tigger, any many, many more.\n\n15. Only on two occasions has Donald’s nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie had separate voice actors. In 1997, the short-lived series Quack Pack had teenaged Huey, Dewey, and Louie voiced by Jeannie Elias, Pamela Adlon, and E. G. Daily, respectively. In the 2017 reboot of DuckTales, they were voiced by Danny Pudi (Huey), Ben Schwartz (Dewey), and Ben Moynihan (Louie). In most other projects, all three were voiced by either the OG Donald Duck, Clarence Nash, or Minnie Mouse’s Russi Taylor.\n\n16. In Mickey and the Beanstalk (1947), Willie the Giant almost smashes Mickey in his pocket when he gets waylaid by a sputtering, massively building, but ultimately anticlimactic sneeze. That was not just a gag: Billy Gilbert voiced Sneezy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), and before that, he was a vaudeville performer whose shtick was comical sneezes.\n\n17. Adam West will forever go down in history as Batman, the “Bright Knight” (as he called himself) of the 1960’s television series. Aside from his role as Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, most all of his roles in his later years reflected his heroic persona one way or another. In 2005’s Chicken Little, he played the movie version of the title character as gritty space hero, and in 2007’s Meet The Robinsons, he was Uncle Artie: the pizza delivery driver whom Lewis mistakes for a superhero. His most transparent parody role was in the Kim Possible episode “The Fearless Ferret”, where he played the grumpy Timothy North, a former superhero looking to train his protégé, Ron Stoppable, into being the next generation of his superhero mantle.\n\n18. Speaking of which, Will Friedle (The voice of Ron Stoppable) was the main character in Batman Beyond. In that show, Terry McGinnis (Friedle) is being trained as the next Batman while Bruce Wayne (Not West, but Kevin Conroy). It’s not hard to see that while Kim Possible‘s plot was not parodying the Batman Beyond premise, but the parallels are clearly there. Friedle later took on another animated superhero – for Marvel – as Peter Quill/Star-Lord in the 2015 Guardians of the Galaxy animated series on Disney XD.\n\n19. Speaking of Batman, let’s take a look and see where some of the Dark Knight’s performers have wound up at Disney. We already talked about West, so next is Michael Keaton, whom we’ve heard in Cars (2006) as Chick Hicks, and Toy Story 3 (2010) as Ken. Val Kilmer parodied his Goose character from Top Gun (1986) in Planes (2013) as Bravo. George Clooney’s only Disney role is in Brad Bird’s live-action film Tomorrowland (2016). Christian Bale has been Thomas in 1995’s Pocahontas and Howl in Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle (2004) in the English dub. Even Will Arnett (LEGO Batman) voiced Sweet Pete in 2022’s Chip n’ Dale Rescue Rangers movie. For both Ben Affleck, Robert Pattinson, and Kevin Conroy… I’m sorry, guys. I couldn’t find anything. But hey, it’s not who they are, but what they do that defines them.\n\n20. In The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), during the song “A Guy Like You,” the gargoyles give Quasimodo a powdered wig. This is most likely an homage to Tom Hulce’s other famous work, 1984’s Amadeus, where he played the impetuous and childish Mozart.\n\n21. Br’er Fox in Song of the South (1946) was clocked at snapping eight words a second from James Baskett. Since animation is typically done at 24 frames a second, that meant animator Ollie Johnston had to articulate his mouth on an average of three frames per word!\n\n22. In 2010, Disney released Epic Mickey, a game for the Nintendo Wii starring Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Despite all character dialogue reduced to mumbles, Oswald was given his first official voice to veteran voice actor Frank Welker. Frank’s other notable Disney roles are in Aladdin (1992) as Abu the monkey and the Cave of Wonders. Frank’s resume extends all the way back to the early sixties, with his most prominent credit being Fred Jones in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? in 1969…and is still Fred to this day. Since 2002, he’s also the voice of Hanna-Barbera’s beloved, gluttonous great dane, too!\n\n23. Ever wonder why Hudson (Up‘s Ed Asner) in Gargoyles was the only one of the Manhattan clan to have a Scottish accent, despite them all being Scottish? According to showrunner Greg Weisman, network executives worried the main characters having non-American accents would be alienating to American kids. In fact, you can see the mindset hard at work in the nineties, with shows like 101 Dalmatians: The Series and Jungle Cubs where the characters suffer a severe de-anglicization. Someone should call Ludo studios and let them know, or that Bluey show will never catch on.\n\n24. Mickey’s Christmas Carol (1983) was Wayne Allwine’s first time to shine as Mickey Mouse. However, Allwine also voiced the homeless man asking Scrooge for a penny at the opening scene, and both the grave digging weasels in the cemetery.\n\n25. Danny Elfman has written countless scores and songs over his career. He even wrote the songs in The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and was the singing voice of Jack Skellington, too.\n\n26. If Little Brother, Mulan’s dog, seems vaguely familiar, what with those black eyes, rounded, jagged teeth, oval-shaped head, and even raspy bark, you’re not going crazy. Chris Sanders was the head of story on Mulan (1998), and his style was influential on several designs. He would later go on to create Lilo & Stitch (2002), even voicing the irascible blue alien. So yeah… that includes the barking, too.\n\n27. We credit Walt as the first voice of Mickey Mouse, which lasted for about twenty years. But strictly speaking, he was also the first voice of Minnie, too. Steamboat Willie (1928) had him shouting, “Yoohoo!” and “Hey!” As well as the garbled chattering and laughter of the parrot.\n\n28. With Marina Sirtis, Jonathon Frakes, Michael Dorn, and Brent Spiner as regulars on Gargoyles, a lot of fans noticed a fair amount of casting on the series favoring actors from Star Trek: The Next Generation, though this was initially unintentional. There were attempts to request Patrick Stewart, but his fees were too high. There was momentary talk to just have Sirtis and Frakes coax him into joining, but the idea was nixed for being unfair.\n\n29. John Rhys-Davies is a beloved personality as Indiana Jones’ close friend and ally Sallah and the gruff Gimli in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. At Disney, he’s played fathers to both Aladdin (Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1997), and Mowgli (The Jungle Book 2 (2003).\n\n30. John Ratzenberger was Pixar’s lucky charm for several years, voicing numerous side and tertiary characters like Hamm the piggy bank, Mack the truck, the Abominable Snnowman, P. T. Flea, and many more. At the end of Cars (2006), a mid-credits scene shows Mack at a drive-in watching Toy Car Story, A Bug’s Life, and Monster Trucks, Inc. In all three scenes, Ratzenberger’s characters appear (All in car form, of course), leading him to notice the use and reuse of the actor, asking “What kind of a cut-rate production is this?” It’s also worth noting for this cute homage to him, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Dave Foley all reprised their roles in single lines each for this quick joke.\n\n31. Daisy Duck’s first appearance is recognized as Donna Duck in 1937’s Don Donald. In keeping with the internal logic consistent, she was voiced by Clarence Nash, just given a slightly higher pitched quacking voice. She became the Daisy we all know and love in her second appearance, 1940’s Mr. Duck Steps Out, but she still talked like her boyfriend. After three cartoons where she only had a cameo, her third true appearance was in Donald’s Crime (1945), where she was finally given a human-sounding voice.\n\n32. Andrew Stanton, who directed Finding Nemo (2003) also voiced Crush the sea turtle and the seagulls. So yes, every “Mine!” is that of the movie’s director.\n\n33. Maurice LaMarche seems to have a penchant for portraying villainous rodents. Since 1999, he’s sporadically voiced the revived character of Mortimer Mouse (A throwback to 1936’s Mickey’s Rival) and Mr. Big in Zootopia (2016). But LaMarche’s best-known character is Brain from the cartoon duo of Pinky & the Brain. LaMarche is also celebrated in the industry for his uncanny ability to do impressions of Orson Welles and Vincent Price. So if Disney ever decides to reboot The Great Mouse Detective (1986), they wouldn’t have to look too far for the perfect Ratigan.\n\n34. His partner-in-crime, Pinky, is voiced by Rob Paulsen, another widely-acclaimed voice actor. Also the voice of Yakko Warner, Carl Wheezer in Jimmy Neutron, Raphael in 1987’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Donatello in the 2012 revival, he’s had numerous stops over at Disney. In The Adventures of the Gummi Bears, he was the artistic Gusto Gummi. In Darkwing Duck, the nefarious Steelbeak. Hathi in Jungle Cubs. In Goof Troop and A Goofy Movie (1995), Max’s pal P.J. In Lilo & Stitch: the Series, the sandwich-loving Experiment 625, AKA Reuben. In Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), Troubador Turtle. In the DuckTales reboot, while he did not reprise his role of Steelbeak, he did play Gibbous, the agreeable moonlander who befriends Della Duck.\n\n35. Currently in the independent animation scene, Spindlehorse Studios is garnering a lot of attention thanks to Vivienne Medrano, creator of two adult animated projects, Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss. They have enough clout to get performers for the latter show, such as Richard Horvitz (The Angry Beavers, Invader Zim, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy), Mara Wilson (Mrs. Doubtfire, Matilda), Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead), and even Ke$ha. In season two, episode one, “The Circus,” we meet the fathers of Blitzo and Stolas: Cash Buckzo and Paimon. Both are terrible fathers, but Paimon is suspiciously draped in a cloak, wearing black, with pointed shoulders, living in a palace. Both were played Jonathan Freeman…Jafar in Aladdin (1992). Other Disney alumni in Hazbin Hotel include Stephanie Beatriz (Mirabel Madrigal in Encanto and Gosalyn in the DuckTales reboot) as Vaggie, Keith David (Dr. Facilier in Princess and the Frog and Goliath in Gargoyles) as Husk, Jeremy Jordan (Varian in Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure) as Lucifer, Kimiko Glen (Kiff in Kiff and Lena in the DuckTales reboot), as Niffty, and James Monroe Ingleheart (Lance Strongbow in Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure and Taurus Bulba in the DuckTales reboot) as Asmodeus and Zestial.\n\n36. Ming-Na Wen and Jodi Benson have one thing in common… Aside from being the voices of Disney princesses Mulan and Ariel. Both are the only original actors who had cameos in their respective live action remakes. Wen appears as “esteemed guest” near the film’s end, and Benson is the merchant who gives Ariel a fork. However, only James Earl Jones has the claim of actually reprising his role as Mufasa in The Lion King (2019).\n\n37. Mae Questal was one of the early voices for Betty Boop back throughout the thirties. She reprised the role in 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit when Eddie Valiant finds her as a cigarette girl at the Ink and Paint Club. You may even have seen her: her final role was as Aunt Bethany in National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989).\n\n38. Geoffrey Rush must’ve had a great 2003. In summer of that year, he kicked off his appearance in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as Hector Barbossa, and voiced Nigel, the friendly pelican in Pixar’s Finding Nemo.\n\n39. But then Idris Elba said, “Hold my Dole Whip.” Because his 2016 was even better. Starting Zootopia, he played Chief Bogo. Following that came the Jungle Book remake, where he flexed his intimidation game as Shere Khan. Later that summer, he appears in Finding Dory as Fluke, a sea lion who helps Marlin and Nemo find Dory… but not before telling Gerald to get off the rock.\n\n40. Verna Felton had a long and illustrious career at Disney studios, voicing such memorable characters as Aunt Sarah, Flora, the Queen of Hearts, and the Fairy Godmother. Strangely, her Disney career was bookended by elephants specifically. She started in 1941’s Dumbo as Matriarch, the lead elephant who looks down on our hero. Her last roles were Eloise in the 1960 short Goliath II and Winnifred, Colonel Hathi’s wife in The Jungle Book (1967).\n\n41. Before he became the elegant Captain Hook, Hans Conried made his debut with Disney in live action as the magic mirror in One Hour in Wonderland (1950). Another salaciously cruel cartoon villain of his is the fairly obscure 1977 featurette Halloween is Grinch Night, as – who else? – the Grinch!\n\n42. Disney will officially tell you the only time Pluto ever spoke was in The Moose Hunt (1931), where he says, “Kiss me!” While he does say that, not only is the context super messed up, but those aren’t even his only words in the cartoon. He also says, “Mammy!”, a reference to Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer (1927) and a very racist one at that. The other thing he says is just sputtering “the moo- the moo- the moo -…the moose!” But what’s wrong with ‘Kiss me’? Mickey throws a stick for Pluto to fetch, and Mickey then confuses Pluto’s silhouette for a moose…so he shoots him! Pluto plays dead while Mickey sobs uncontrollably, until he begs Pluto to say something, so the dog sits up and says, “Kiss me!” So yeah…Disney, I’d keep this one tucked away next to Song of the South.\n\n43. The DuckTales reboot was lousy with nods, cameos, and homages to the Disney Afternoon lineup. Both Jim Cummings and Bill Farmer returned to play their popular roles as Darkwing Duck and Goofy. One odd cameo came with the character Manny, the Headless Man-horse. An odd supernatural creature in the pilot, Manny was seen time and again up to the finale, where it was revealed he was a horseman of the apocalypse, and finally given a voice, supplied by Keith David. When his true power is unleashed, his giant bat wings pop out, and he bellows, “I live again!” as the Gargoyles overture plays. That’s right… Manny was their way of putting Goliath into the series, just in time for the show to end.\n\n44. In the Phineas and Ferb episode, “Night of the Living Pharmacists,” the writers spoofed the zombie horror genre by having Doofenshmirtz clones wander around Danville, making more clones just by touching the citizens and turning them. George A. Romero, director of the 1968 film, cameos as a reporter named Don Adaded (Get it? “Dawn a’ de dead?”) who looks just like Romero. To top it off, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost also appeared as animated versions of their characters, Shaun and Ed, from the 2004 film Shaun of the Dead.\n\n45. Why is Kaa (played by Scarlett Johansson) a female snake in The Jungle Book (2016)? Director Jon Favreau claimed it was because the 1967 movie was mostly cast with dudes. Darleen Carr (Shanti) only sings, Mowgli’s wolf mother, Raksha, never utters a sound, leaving only the aforementioned Verna Felton as Winnifred as a distinct female character. Talk about failing the Bechdel test!\n\n46. Owen Wilson was the original voice of Pacha in The Emperor’s New Groove (2000), and even recorded several lines for it. However, this was in the original version of Kingdom of the Sun, where Kuzco (then named Manko) pulled a Prince and the Pauper and switched places with Wilson’s Pacha.\n\n47. Rod Serling died in 1975, nearly twenty years before Walt Disney World’s The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror opened at Disney-MGM Studios. Mark Silverman is the attraction’s impeccable impressionist. To give you an idea how good he is, when Rod appears in the pre-show, it’s a green screened clip from the episode “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Rod originally turns says “Map of the United States,” but at the ride, the clip cuts away and he says “Maintenence service elevator”. Silverman’s work is so good you literally watched Rod speak and you wouldn’t have known the difference.\n\n48. One of Tony Anselmo’s first credits as Donald Duck was in 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The last time Mel Blanc played Daffy Duck, as well as a few other of his Looney Tunes characters, was in the same movie. Both men stood side by side while they recorded the dueling pianos scene.\n\n49. Bruce Reitherman was the son of Wolfgang Reitherman, one of Walt’s legendary Nine Old Men, a skilled animator and a director of such films as The Jungle Book (1967), where Bruce starred as Mowgli, the mancub. While Bruce hasn’t done much acting since then, he would later go on to become a nature documentarian and wildlife photographer.\n\n50. Mickey Mouse was completely off-limits to Francisco Angones and Matt Youngberg when working on DuckTales 2017, but they frequently pushed the envelope when it came to certain restrictions. In season two, Della and the kids find Donald stranded on a desert island – and in a memorable nod to Tom Hanks’ Castaway – with his only friend being a melon with a face carved on it. Because Chris Diamantopolous was already the voices of characters such as Drake Mallard and Storkules, it wasn’t hard to call him to use his Mickey Mouse voice for the melon, since he played Mickey in the Paul Rudish cartoons from 2013 to 2023. So it was as close to having Mickey on the show without actually having Mickey there.\n\n51. Dolores Madrigal has an idiosyncratic tic of giving a soft squeak that punctuates a lot of her lines in Encanto (2021). Several theories online has cropped up that it’s a Colombian trait to communicate, that it has ties to when they were first colonized, or that it’s a way of saying “Oops, I shouldn’t have heard that”. But while those might have a grain of truth here or there, her voice actor Adassa has stated on her Tiktok that it was simply a distinctive trait to make her unique among the film’s large cast, so she spent roughly 15 minutes just making various squeaks.\n\n52. Did you know Jackie Chan was in Mulan (1998)? Well… likely not the version you’ve seen. While Jurassic Park (1993) and Law and Order: SVU‘s B. D. Wong is the english voice of Shang, Chan was Shang in the Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese dub. In addition, Chan also sang the fan-favorite song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” in all for languages, complete with music videos starring… well, himself!\n\n53. Paul Frees, who is the Haunted Masion’s Ghost Host, the ghostly voice on Pirates of the Caribbean who warns, “Dead men tell no tales!”, and the original voice of Professor Ludwig Von Drake… was wounded in battle on Normandy on D-Day.\n\n54. Bowling for Soup is the pop rock band that is known for their hit song “1985” in 2004, but they also performed the theme to Phineas and Ferb, and the band even appear as themselves in animated form in the episode “Phineas and Ferb’s Quantum Boogaloo”, where they sang the second chorus of the theme. On top of that, band frontman Jaret Reddick had also appeared in a handful of episodes as Danny, the lead singer of the in-universe band, Love Händel.\n\n55. At the end of Aladdin (1992), the Genie wears a loud, yellow Hawaiian shirt and a Goofy hat. If you think this was just because Aladdin was a Disney movie, there’s actually more to it than that. In 1989, Disney-MGM Studios opened at Walt Disney World, and with it, the attraction The Magic of Disney Animation. The walk-through attraction allowed guests to explore a real animation studio after a pre-show starring the legendary journalist Walter Cronkite about the process. Co-hosting the show was a random guest he picked out, who was wearing a loud, yellow Hawaiian shirt and a Goofy hat: Robin Williams.\n\n56. Lilo & Stitch (2002) director Chris Sanders recalled how Daveigh Chase had a very deadpan, off-beat sense of humor about her, which was helpful for the quirky Lilo Pelekai. But Daveigh might have infiltrated your nightmares, too. The same year, Daveigh starred in the American remake of The Ring as Samara Morgan. Heck, she bridged Japan and American twice in 2002 by starring as Chihiro in Miyazaki’s Spirited Away. No wonder Stitch had his own series where he lived in Japan!\n\n57. In 2014, an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse called “Mickey’s Pirate Adventure” aired; a special musical episode where the sensational six rescue Goofy’s grandpappy, Captain Goof-Beard. The celebrity they got to voice him in the kid’s show was then-88-year-old Disney legend Dick van Dyke. And yes… he sang, too.\n\n58. Kevin McDonald is a Canadian comedian who gained notoriety in the sketch comedy s Kids in the Hall. In 2002, McDonald premiered in the cast of Lilo & Stitch as Agent Pleakley. The following year, on the series based on the Disney cartoon, in the episode “Fibber,” McDonald reunited with his peers Dave Foley (priest), Bruce McCulloch (Pixley), Mark McKinney (Bertley), and Scott Thompson (Pleakley’s mom), mostly cast as – who else? – Pleakley’s family.\n\n59. Mr. Weasley Wesley in Home on the Range (2004) is a caricature of his voice actor, Steve Buscemi.\n\n60. Pat Buttram has appeared in numerous projects over the years, but boomers might remember him best as Mr. Haney in Green Acres. The show’s co-star, Eva Gabor, would voice Duchess in The AristoCats (1970) and Miss Bianca in The Rescuers (1977) and its 1990 sequel. Buttram appeared in both films as Napoleon the farm dog, and Luke, respectively. Buttram also appeared as Robin Hood‘s Sheriff of Nottingham, The Fox and the Hound’s Chief, a bullet in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), and in his final film role, the attendant at Lester’s Possum Park in A Goofy Movie (1995), which premiered over a year after his passing.\n\n61. Composer Howard Ashman was unsatisfied with how Paige O’Hara was singing the song “Something There” from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Because he was sick and was coaching her over a teleconference call, he asked the staff to tell O’Hara, “Tell her she’s Streisand!”. As a result, O’Hara placed a strong inflection on the second syllable on the word “alarming,” akin to Barbara Streisand.\n\n62. The talking skull on Disneyland’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride that warned guests of the dangers ahead was originally voiced by Xavier “X” Atencio. He was an imagineer who worked on the attraction and even penned the songs “Yo ho, yo ho, A Pirates Life for Me” as well as “Grim Grinning Ghosts” over at the Haunted Mansion.\n\n63. Samuel E. Wright was the voice of Sebastian in The Little Mermaid (1989) as well as in the TV series, sequels, and video game projects. While it’s his highest-profile screen credit, he also was the original Mufasa in the Broadway production of The Lion King and even voiced the multi-ton, villainous iguanadon Kron in Dinosaur (2000)\n\n64. The Jim Henson sitcom Dinosaurs was a beloved staple of ABC’s TGIF primetime television block. Many beloved puppeteers of the Jim Henson company such as Elmo’s Kevin Clash and Kermit’s Steve Whitmire were part of the regular ensemble, but character actors like Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) and Tim Curry played various one-shot characters. One surprising regular was Christopher Meloni: AKA Law and Order: SVU‘s detective Elliot Stabler, who played Spike, Robbie’s ankylosaurus friend and a rebellious, anti-establishment punk. Geez, and you thought Ice-T had quite the trajectory.\n\n65. Sean Marshall starred in the 1978 animated featurette The Small One, arguably the most openly religious Christmas special Disney ever produced. Credited as simply “Boy”, the short (Directed by future Disney defector Don Bluth) features the boy bringing his elderly donkey, Small One, into town to sell, and (Spoilers) sells him to a man and his pregnant wife on their way to Bethlehem. Marshall gave up acting not long after, and he had already performed his highest-profile role already by starring in 1977’s Pete’s Dragon as the titular Pete.\n\n66. In determining if Tom Hanks was the best fit for the toy cowboy doll in Toy Story (1995) animators synced up some test animation with dialogue from Turner and Hooch (1989)\n\n67. Ron Perlman is credited as the voices of the Stabbington Brothers in Tangled (1950), who – while never named in the film – are unofficially named Sideburns and Patchy. However…have you noticed throughout the entire film, Patchy never speaks?\n\n68. In The Incredibles (2004), when Mr. Incredible struggles to remember Buddy’s name, he blurts out “Brody”. This is a nod to Jason Lee’s character in Mallrats (1995), who voiced Syndrome.\n\n69. In Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins (2000), the movie was intended as a full-length pilot to the TV show of the same name, which included having Patrick Warburton (Kronk from The Emperor’s New Groove (2000)) as Buzz Lightyear. However, after all the lines were recorded and the animation was completed, word came down from on high to swap Warburton with OG Buzz, Tim Allen. Unfortunately for Allen, this meant having to try to sync up his tone and affect to match the character onscreen, which clashed with Warburton’s more deadpan delivery. Nice work, pal.\n\n70. Bill Thompson played a slew of memorable Disney characters over the years including the White Rabbit and the Dodo in Alice in Wonderland (1951), Mr. Smee in Peter Pan (1953), Jock in Lady and the Tramp (1955), King Hubert in Sleeping Beauty (1959), and Uncle Waldo in The AristoCats (1970). In shorts, he voiced park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore and Professor Owl (In those Pre-Disney Sing Along days) However, his most popular character outside of Disney is MGM’s Droopy.\n\n71. Pixar director Brad Bird, who gave us The Incredibles (2004) and Ratatouille (2007), has had such a deep love and appreciation for Disney animation that in his directorial debut, 1999’s The Iron Giant (released by Warner Brothers), you can find two elderly railroad engineers, who are modeled after their voice performers, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston. Both were two of Walt’s remaining Nine Old Men and were renowned for their impeccable friendship. After transferring to Pixar, he did the same thing in The Incredibles. They are elderly gentlemen complimenting the heroes for doing it “Old school.”\n\n72. The legendary stage actor Nigel Hawthorne has been in two Disney animated features, 14 years apart. In 1985, he performed as Fflewdurr Fflam, the flustered minstrel, in The Black Cauldron. And in Tarzan (1999), he joined the cast as professor Archimedes Q. Porter, Jane’s father.\n\n73. Of the three actresses who voiced the three good fairies in Sleeping Beauty (1959), two of them had long-standing careers with Disney. We already talked about Flora, voiced by Verna Felton. Merriweather was voiced by Barbara Luddy, who voiced Lady (Lady and the Tramp (1955), Kanga in the original Winnie the Pooh shorts, and both Widow Rabbit and Little Sister in Robin Hood (1973). Barbara Jo Ellen’s only credits with Disney are the Scullery Maid in The Sword and the Stone (1963) and Goliath’s mother in Goliath II (1960).\n\n74. In Pixar’s Cars (2006), Lightning McQueen is sponsored by Rust-Eze Bumper Ointment, with Dusty and Rusty as owners of the brand. They frequently quip “Don’t drive like my brother! Don’t drive like MY brother!”. They were played by real-life brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, who cohosted a car repair show as Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers, on the NPR radio show Car Talk from 1977 to 2012. They even got to choose what cars they wanted to be in the movie. Though both characters reappeared in 2017’s Cars 3 , Tom passed away in 2014, thus, all of Rusty’s lines were unused archive recordings.\n\n75. The reason Jonathan Groff’s character Kristoff makes a voice for Sven in Frozen (2013) is because the writers wanted the two to play off each other, but worried a talking animal in the movie was a touch too fanciful in the semi-grounded universe they established in Arendelle. And as we all know, talking animals have no place in Disney movies.\n\n76. In Monsters, Inc. (2001), Sulley greets his colleague, Ted, a giant green monster who returns with a chicken cluck. According to director Pete Docter, the plan was to use the iconic Godzilla screech, but Toho refused to loan out the rights, so they purposely went in the opposite direction with a much less intimidating sound. In the credit’s outtakes, Ted is played by Toy Story‘s Rex, played the “inconceivably” hilarious Wallace Shawn.\n\n77. Mickey’s Delayed Date (1947) marked the last time Minnie Mouse spoke in a cartoon, unless you wish to count her singing as part of an ensemble with Donald and Goofy in Pluto’s Christmas Tree (1952). Even with Wayne Allwine was freshly cast as Mickey, Clarence Nash was on his final performance as Donald, and Goofy was briefly voiced by Hal Smith, Mickey’s Christmas Carol (1983) still left Minnie silent, as she hadn’t had a proper voice actor in years. It wasn’t until 1987 with the TV special DTV Doggone Valentine Russi Taylor took her first crack at Minnie, and incidentally, was also the first time Bill Farmer took on the role of Goofy. Also incidentally, her new dialogue was dubbed over a clip of Mickey’s Delayed Date.\n\n78. Lenny Weinrib was in 1971’s Bedknobs and Broomsticks as both King Leonidas and his Secretary Bird. A far more recognizable character of his is – love him or hate him – Scooby-Doo’s gutsy nephew, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo.\n\n79. Peggy Lee was the co-composer of Lady and the Tramp‘s (1955) music, as well as the voices of Darling, Peggy, and Si and Am (So yes, if you find the cats distasteful, you can totally put all the blame on her, I suppose.) However, one of Lee’s first hits is 1952’s “Why Don’t You Do Right?”, which you may recognize as Jessica Rabbit’s number in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\n80. J. Pat O’Malley was Disney’s go-to Brit, often doing multiple roles on one project. This kept him returning to the studio as Walt was a bit of an anglophile. Among his best-known roles are Cyril Proudbottom (The Wind in the Willows (1949)), the Tweedles, the Walrus, and the Carpenter (Alice in Wonderland (1951)), the Colonel and Jasper (101 Dalmatians (1961)), the pearly drummer (Mary Poppins (1964), Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the vulture (The Jungle Book (1967)), and Otto (Robin Hood (1973)).\n\n81. Walt Disney sent Bob and Dick Sherman to Las Vegas to recruit Louis Prima to be King Louie in The Jungle Book (1967). After Prima and his band mates listened to a rousing rendition of “I Wan’na be Like You,” he asked the composers, “You trying to make a monkey out of me?” Dick, ever the witty one, responded, “oh no! You’re an ape!” And he pointed to the band, saying,”They’re the monkeys!” This got such a laugh it practically sealed the deal on Prima being in the movie.\n\n82. George Carlin is one of the 20th century’s most culturally significant and provocative comedians, with “The Seven Dirty Words You Can’t Say on Television or Radio” being his most famous bit. His fans also recognize his work on the long-running series Thomas & Friends since 1984 as the narrator and/or the conductor. As if that weren’t hard enough to wrap your head around, in 2005, he voiced the Zugor in Tarzan II, and the following year, was Fillmore, the hippie van in Pixar’s Cars (2006).\n\n83. Tony Goldwyn, the voice of Tarzan in the 1999 movie, is the son of producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. His father, Samuel Goldwyn Sr., founded Goldwyn Pictures. In 1924, the studio merged with Metro Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Pictures to become Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Studios… better known as MGM, the studio that gave us Tom and Jerry, The Wizard of Oz (1939) Rocky, and James Bond.\n\n84. In 2020, in season 2, episode 5a of Amphibia, episode, “Swamp and Sensibility,” a frog named Crumpet presides over the Ribbiton polo game. While it’s obvious he’s a transparent riff on Kermit the Frog, what you may or may not have noticed is that his actor is Kermit’s official puppeteer and voice since 2017, Matt Vogel.\n\n85. Wart in The Sword in the Stone (1963) had three credited voice actors: Rickie Sorensen, Robert Reitherman, and Richard Reitherman. The last two were director Woolie Reitherman’s sons, and brothers Bruce Reitherman (Mowgli from The Jungle Book (1967)). Why so many? It should be obvious if you’ve watched the movie: their voices kept breaking as they went through puberty.\n\n86. The reason Phil Collins voiced Lucky the vulture in 2003’s The Jungle Book 2 was because he was already conveniently at the studio writing music for Brother Bear (2003). Besides… he’s kind of like a Beatle, right? I mean… he’s British and he sings…?\n\n87. George C. Scott was not in a great mood for one recording session of The Rescuers Down Under (1990) due to an injury. His character, Percival C. McLeach sang his twisted version of “The Crawdad Song,” but when it came time to sing his similarly morbid version of “Home on the Range,” he refused. This was recorded instead by Frank Welker, who was already doing all the snarls and hisses and whines of his pet goanna, Joanna.\n\n88. On The Great Movie Ride, the Disney-MGM Studios attraction that lasted from 1989 to 2017, featured a scene of Dorothy and her companions from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Her voice was supplied by Judy Garland’s daughter, Liza Minnelli.\n\n89. In Davy Crockett and the River Pirates (1956), Davy, Georgie, and Mike Fink meet a musician named Colonel Plug who signals the titular river pirates to attack boats with riches aboard. It’s not the first time he’s been so devious with his gift of music… Catlett was Honest John in Pinocchio (1940) 16 years earlier.\n\n90. Three years before he was cast as James Bond in Dr. No (1962), Sean Connery was cast as Michael MacBride in Disney’s Darby O’Gill and the Little People (1959), where he even sings one of the few songs in the film, “Pretty Irish Girl”. However, it’s fairly obvious in the film proper, he was dubbed over by an actual Irish singer, Brendan O’Dowda. But don’t despair, those of you who yearn to hear Connery’s silvery pipes! Recordings of him singing that song are out there if you know where to look!\n\n91. In Brad Bird’s three films, he cameos as a diminutive character. In 2007’s Ratatouille, he’s Ambrister, the man who tells Anton Ego about Gusteau’s being popular again. More famously, he plays Edna “No Capes” Mode in both Incredibles films.\n\n92. Remember at the end of Mary Poppins (1964), her parrot umbrella suddenly chastises her for being sentimental over the Banks children? Not only was the umbrella meant to be a recurring character before it was realized the effect would he too challenging, but he was voiced by David Thomlinson: George Banks himself.\n\n93. The only reason Jim Jordan (No, not that one. “Fibber McGee” Jim Jordan.) didn’t return as Orville the albatross in The Rescuers Down Under (1990) is because he passed away in 1988. This is what inspired to give him a brother named Wilbur because… you know, the Wright brothers?\n\n94. Tony Jay recorded all his lines as Monseiur D’arque in Beauty and the Beast (1991) during his audition. He later would go on to play Shere Khan in TaleSpin and The Jungle Book 2 (2003), Judge Claude Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), and the Magic Mirror from Snow White in various Disney projects.\n\n95. Walt’s nickname for Aurora’s actress, Mary Costa, was “Happy Bird” during the production of Sleeping Beauty (1959).\n\n96. Jimmy MacDonald, sound effects man of the Disney studio and then-voice of Mickey Mouse, provided the voices of Jaq and Gus in Cinderella (1950) a language dubbed “Mouse latin” by writer Winston Hibler.\n\n97. Paul Winchell often ad-libbed many of Tigger’s lines. One credited to him was during Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), where he spontaneously blurted out “T-T-F-N! Ta Ta For Now!”\n\n98. John Musker and Ron Clements have co-directed The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), Treasure Planet (2003), The Princess and the Frog (2009), and Moana (2016). In Aladdin, they cameo as the spectators commenting on Prince Achmed. In Hercules, they are the construction guys who young Herc almost knocks to the ground when pulling the cart into town. In Treasure Planet, they are the robot and alien on the ladder, giving Jim directions to the ship. Though they had cameos in the latter two (The Fenner brothers splattered with cake, tossing beads off a Mardi Gras float, and on a tapestry on Montonui.), on the other three, they provided their own voice work for the characters.\n\n99. Angela Lansbury came into LAX on an airplane that had a bomb threat. It was a long night – and it turned out to be a hoax – but when she arrived, she came in and recorded the movie version of “Beauty and the Beast” one take.\n\n100. Leonard Nimoy will always go down in history as Mr. Spock in the original Star Trek series, but he’s made some other contributions to the Mouse House. I’m 1987 he directed the film Three Men and a Baby, and just two year later, directed the Epcot attraction Body Wars. In 2001, he voiced King Kashekim Nedakh in Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\n\n200 is a lot… but I did it! There’s always lots more facts and anecdotes out there! Let me know what you think!\n\nDisney has given the public some of the greatest music in all of cinema, with some like “Chim Chim Cher-ee”, “When You Wish Upon a Star”, and “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” even getting acknowledged by the American Film Institute, and several more getting Academy Award wins and nominations. It doesn’t matter how much you despise “It’s a Small World” or “Let it Go”; the fact is there’s a handful of these tunes you love and you know it. Mountains of texts have been dedicated to analyzing how the genius of just Menken and Ashman and the Sherman Brothers made so many indelible songs that garnered such widespread praise and joy.\n\nBut of course, not every song is a winner. And as Disney closes in on their centennial celebration, they have to realize not every decision made was a good one or that some of them created issues downstream that were out of their control. I love exploring all facets of Disney, not to shame them, but to look at complicated topics to see how they came about and what their impact had: on Disney, on society, and beyond. Because this goes beyond just being songs for our kids.\n\n1. “Arabian Nights”\n\nAladdin is a beloved classic of the early Renaissance of the nineties, showcasing spectacular animation, great characters, and, of course, its spellbinding soundtrack. It was the last work between the astoundingly phemomenal team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. The two worked closely on The Little Mermaid, but during Beauty and the Beast, Ashman contracted AIDS and his health declined rapidly. He sadly passed before Beauty and the Beast was released, but by then, he had already submitted a pitch for a movie based off the “1,001 Arabian Nights”‘ story of Aladdin, and hoped to use the Genie as a fun sort of Cab Calloway figure. He had already submitted several songs, three of which made it into the final film: “Arabian Nights,” “Friend Like Me,” and “Prince Ali.”\n\n“Arabian Nights”, to refresh your memory, is the movie’s opening number, where a diminutive vendor plods through the desert on his camel, singing of the exotic aura of the Persian desert and its culture. Right away, it sets the tone and atmosphere, getting audiences intrigued with what mysteries lie in the dunes of Agrabah. Ashman even wrote several verses of it to bookend the multiple chapters of the movie, one of which was used to close out the saga’s trilogy at the end of Aladdin and the King of Thieves.\n\nHowever, no matter how funny, entertaining, or engaging Aladdin was, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee was unmoved. Founded in 1980, the organization works to mitigate racism against Americans who are from or descended from Arabian countries. This includes turning to pop culture depictions if they are seen as untoward to said marginalized group. Since Aladdin was well-advertised (Much to Robin Williams’ chagrin, might I add), they had their eye on it, and had some choice words with Disney. Among their primary complaints were the anglicization of Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan, while the villain and other tertiary characters were not only more ethnic-looking, but also nastier, too. To top it off, they were especially upset at the song “Arabian Nights”, since a lyric sang “Where they cut off your ear if they don’t like your face/it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.” As far as they were concerned, exaggerating the exotica with transgressive barbarism was only playing into white perceptions and only perpetuated a caricature of the peninsula as bloodthirsty and primitive. And it wasn’t funny.\n\nOf course, Disney was hesitant about making any changes – It was one of Howard Ashman’s last contributions and he’d been dead for almost three years, and he was extremely well-regarded by his colleagues – but changing the lyrics just seemed like the best possible move, even though the earliest cassette and CD soundtrack releases already included said lyrics. As a result, it did end up getting redubbed to “Where it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense/it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.” And all subsequent releases in theaters, home video, streaming, and soundtracks reflect the updated change.\n\nIt really comes down as a lesson in nuance when it comes to racist depictions. I’ve seen Mickey in Arabia from 1932, and it is overwhelmingly, uncomfortably, shockingly racist. By contrast, Aladdin is far less offensive, but it still falls prey to prejudiced behavior by playing up oversimplified caricatures. When those perceptions dehumanize and other marginalized groups, it can implicitly encourage hateful attitudes or worse, stochastic terrorism. A lot from some lyrics in a Disney cartoon? Sure. But the less Disney can do to play up negative stereotypes, the harder it becomes to normalize racism in our kids. I know it’s been an uphill battle for me and millennials like me to unlearn twenty-plus years of hateful prejudice under the guise of comedy. And I look forward to see how else we can grow and adapt and change.\n\n2. The Sweatbox\n\nBefore I begin, let me elaborate about the title of this movie. The term “sweatbox” dates back to the studio on Hyperion Avenue, where most of the classic shorts and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were made, before Walt used the box office revenue to build a brand new studio lot. The Sweatbox was a small room under a staircase that was dark and poorly ventilated, but Walt used it to screen test animation. Because this stuffy, southern California closet was often full of guys, with zero fans or air conditioning, often in the summer, AND it was where the animators would go to have the head honcho appraise their work…it wasn’t that you were sweating bullets in there so much as you would have been sweating freaking cannonballs.\n\nAnyway, most Disney fans are unfamiliar with Kingdom of the Sun: mostly because Disney never made and released it. It was Roger Allers’ next big project once he was fresh off the success of co-directing The Lion King. The story was basically The Prince and the Pauper with an Incan twist: Emperor Manko decides to trade places with the identical-looking llama herder Pacha. While Pacha falls in love with Manko’s fiancée, advisor Yzma turns Manko into a llama as part of her grander plan to destroy the sun, blaming it for her advanced age. (Yes, I’m sure you know EXACTLY where this is going, but please sit down and don’t get ahead of me, please!) Allers and his team went full steam ahead and put together numerous storyboards, concept art, test animation reels, and more, even getting the likes of Eartha Kitt as Yzma, David Spade as Manko, and Owen Wilson as Pacha to record the voices.\n\nAnother lesson Allers took was the lightning-in-a-bottle collaboration between singer/songwriter Sir Elton John and Disney on the soundtrack for The Lion King. In 1997, he hired 13-time Grammy Award singer Sting to pen and sing the film’s songs. But Sting was a package deal: his wife, Trudie Styler, is a film producer, director, and documentarian. She wanted to follow along and make a documentary on the process of making a Disney animated feature. Allers agreed, and work began.\n\nSting got to work right away writing music – six songs total – such as “Walk the Llama Llama,” a bouncy nonsense song about the fun attributes of the animal, “One Day She’ll Love Me,” a romantic ballad sung in duet as Pacha and Manko’s fiancée struggle to understand how they feel, and “Why Can’t a Human be More like a Rock?” A thoughtful dissection by a rock man named Huaca over humans’ fallibility. Once the songs, the storyboards, the concept art, and the test reels were done, they were sent to Peter Schneider and Thomas Schumacher, the head executives of Disney animation…and they had far too many complaints to salvage the project in any meaningful way. Allers took this arguably the hardest, resulting in him leaving the project, and being replaced by Mark Dindal, whose only directing credit so far was Warner Brothers’ Cats Don’t Dance. The film was in shambles, little was able to be saved, Sting was already on his next projects, a new director was in charge, and worse, the December 2000 release date was set in stone. Why? The McDonald’s Happy Meal promotional deal was in jeopardy and the restaurant corporation would impose heavy fines should the studio miss their deadline.\n\nSting was annoyed his effort on the music he wrote was completely scrapped. Annoyed a movie that was going to be a big, grand epic was reduced to a buddy comedy. Annoyed his plans post-movie were getting completely upended because the studio didn’t want to lose him. To boot, Sting was asked to write just two songs for the movie, now called The Emperor’s New Groove. “Perfect World” and “My Funny Friend and Me” were his final projects, the latter of which got an Oscar nomination. The CD soundtrack that was made available for public consumption included some of Sting’s earlier contributions, including “Walk the Llama Llama”, sung by the then-unknown group Rascal Flatts, and Yzma’s bombastic villain song, “Snuff Out the Light”.\n\nBut remember Trudie and her documentary? She finished it and captured it all. From the raw emotions to the fly-on-the-wall moments, the anxiety to the uncomfortable conversations, the candid interviews to playful energy, it was enough to compose a visceral feature she titled The Sweatbox. But because the film and footage was under Disney’s consent, when it was released to the Toronto Film Festival in 2002, it was edited by Disney. After all, unlike all the other “Behind-the-scenes” features Disney’s made over the years, it was arguably the most honest and not PR-friendly. Not detrimental or slanderous, mind you, it just shows that making an animated movie is not as whimsically effortless as they make it out to be. After a run in an LA theater for a “For Your Consideration” campaign and one more film festival in Orlando, the movie vanished off the face of the Earth until it was pirated and released online in 2012. The only other time it saw the light of day was a short clip that was part of The Emperor’s New Groove bonus features on the 2001 DVD.\n\nTo this day, Disney still owns the documentary and keeps it tucked deep in their proverbial vault, probably next to Song of the South. It’s doubtful it’ll ever be released with Disney’s blessing. And I doubt Sting would ever return to work for Mickey again now knowing how easily his time and efforts can be dismissed with just the say so of the right person.\n\n3. “Proud of Your Boy”\n\nI’ve talked before about how “Proud of Your Boy”, in my Top Ten Deleted Songs article, is in my top three favorite Disney songs of all time, and I stand by that. It’s a great song and it’s a damn shame it was removed from the film.\n\nDuring the original drafts of Aladdin, much like in the original story, Aladdin was living with his mother, and was more of a scrappy teenager. Because he and his mom were poor, she had to do whatever she could to support her and her son. But Aladdin, being a teenager, was confident he could always find ways to improve their situation faster and better than whatever his mother set out to do. Though I’m unaware of any specific scenes, it’s heavily implied through various storyboards that his mother would do an errand, Aladdin would assure her he could do it and improve their income, she trusted him to do it for her, and it would blow up in his face, leaving him ashamed and her disappointed. This, in turn, would lead to Aladdin meeting Jafar in disguise, who would lead him to the Genie, and thus Aladdin would use the Genie’s unlimited wishes to improve their societal standing. Though the lesson was still that Aladdin had to be true to himself, it was more about how he had gotten too big for his britches with his sudden good luck and how he had yet to mature because of it.\n\n“Proud of Your Boy” was written to have Aladdin having the genie of the ring (not the same character as the genie of lamp), and knowing its power will grant his mother everything she could ever want. But he is well aware of his failures and how often he’s failed her, despite his best efforts. For Aladdin, he’s screwed up so many times that he feels he has to make it up to her. What makes this song work so well is Aladdin understands his shortcomings, at least in a broad sense, and that he wants to do better and make her proud of him, hence the title. In the storyboard reel, it even ends with him slipping the ring on his sleeping mother’s finger and kissing her cheek while Abu sobs in the corner. I’d like to think we all go through a phase in our lives where all we want is our parents or loved ones to tell us they’re proud of us, because we do fail a lot growing up, whether by accident or by choice, and it can be crippling when we feel we let them down. They rely on us to demonstrate the good values they’ve taught us, and we can only hope to be the best people we can be. Sometimes we do fail and it feels like we’ve failed the world as a whole, and that anxiety and guilt manifests into a misery that feels impossible to overcome. So, I get it. I get feeling that way and how badly I want to do right by those who rely on me, yet feeling wholly inadequate to do so. That’s why it’s such a crying shame it was cut.\n\nAs you can tell, Aladdin’s mother didn’t make it to the final cut. To hear the directors tell it, as Princess Jasmine’s role expanded, the need to have Aladdin’s mother lessened. She ultimately became a cumbersome character in the overall narrative, and as Aladdin aged up, she was dropped altogether. It was by no means an easy decision, considering the staff loved the song and, for a while, considered even having Aladdin sing it to her in heaven. On top of that, it was yet another one of the late Howard Ashman’s songs. However, it was made as part of its Broadway soundtrack and has gained popularity since, helped by Clay Aiken for the movie’s 2004 DVD release.\n\nNow, you’re probably wondering how any of this is controversial. It isn’t. At all. But, uh…ever heard of the Proud Boys?\n\nI wish I were joking, but no. Gavin McInnes, the founder of the group, went to his daughter’s school music recital, where he heard it for the first time. While he hates the song for being “fake, humble, and self-serving”, he admitted he couldn’t get enough of it. But as far as he was concerned, the song was not about a child apologizing for messing up and promising to be a better person, but about apologizing for being a boy. Which, I gotta say, is bafflingly moronic. Aside from the fact that despite lyrically, you couldn’t really replace “boy” with “girl”, the song works with any gender. It has eff-all to do with whether or not Aladdin is a boy. But it does paint a larger picture when it comes to conservatism and their relationship with media: how prone they are to misinterpreting it, willfully or no.\n\nIn recent years, it’s become frighteningly common when a movie or TV show comes out and some conservative pundit screams in vitriolic outrage over it. Not just the usual “It’s woke, therefore it’s trash” drivel, but this bizarre pattern as if they are trying to wholly miss the point of something just to spark anger in others. I’ve heard suggestions that poor media literacy is considered part of the conservative mindset, and it does seem to be true. Transgender hatemonger Matt “Kiss my Ass” Walsh thinks Ariel should look skeletal and pale instead of like Halle Bailey. Failed screenwriter Ben Shapiro thinks Lil Nas X actually worships Satan, that “WAP”‘s playful depiction of female sexuality is medically unsound, and that not having zombies in the famous episode 3 of The Last of Us made it bad. Actor Rainn Wilson (Dwight Schrute from The Office) thought another episode of The Last of Us was an intentional move by Hollywood to vilify Christianity. So I guess it tracks that the founder of a far-right militia group that supports misogyny, fascism, white supremacy, and participated in the January 6th insurrection might also be vulnerable to misunderstanding a song to such an alarming degree. I guess there is a correlation after all.\n\n4. “The Orange Bird Song”\n\nFor those who’ve been to Walt Disney World racks upon racks of merchandise featuring this adorable little cherub:\n\nThis little guy is the Orange Bird, and he’s much older than you might think from his 2012 debut. The fact is, he was created back in the late sixties when Walt Disney World was being built. See, in search of capital to help build the park, the Florida Citrus Commission – the organization responsible for promoting Florida’s orange economy – volunteered to sponsor both the Sunshine Tree Terrace juice bar and the Tropical Serenade attraction (WDW’s version of the Enchanted Tiki Room.), but with one caveat: they wanted their own mascot with which to cross-promote. Bob Moore and Don McLaughlin co-created the Orange Bird character while Bob and Dick Sherman created the theme song “The Orange Bird Song”.\n\nThe Orange Bird was a spirited little guy who loved promoting a healthy lifestyle (often by drinking lots and lots of sugar-laden orange juice, but hey, there are worse vices) and was unable to speak: instead his thoughts would form into a visible thought bubble for others to see. The only other person who spoke for him was Anita Bryant: a former Miss Oklahoma pageant winner, model, and singer who was chosen to sing the bird’s theme song. She, the bird, and the song starred in numerous national commercials and print ads starting in 1977, promoting orange juice, and Orange Bird even got his own walk-around character in Adventureland. If things were any rosier, our little friend would have become a blood orange.\n\nOf course, it couldn’t last. A few years later, Bryant, whose biggest claim to fame so far was singing the Orange Bird jingle, got famous for another reason. She became one of the first politically motivated advocates for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that was growing in America at the time. She had been heavily influenced by her Christian upbringing in that homosexuality was akin to pedophilia, which – you guessed it – meant her platform was inflamed with “save the children” rhetoric She was one of the first to do so, long before our current political climate, and while the backlash wasn’t as strong as it is now, she did get a pie shoved in her face for it, once.\n\nEven in the early eighties, neither the Florida Citrus Commission nor Disney were interested in being associated with Bryant. Because of her known ties to oranges and orange juice, gay bars stopped serving it in their drinks. If you wanted a screwdriver, for example, tough luck. You could get yourself an Anita Bryant cocktail, though: vodka mixed with apple juice. By 1987, the contract was ending. Between the PR nightmare and the increasingly high cost for the sponsorship, the Commission was ready to part. Similarly, Disney had all but phased out the character by this point to avoid controversy.\n\nSo why did our little buddy fly home? Well, in 2004, Tokyo Disneyland (owned and operated not by Disney proper, but the Oriental Land Company does have access to just about anything they want) brought the character out for April 14th: Orange Day. The holiday is celebrated by couples giving each other oranges or orange-colored gifts…and let’s be honest, the Japanese populace loves cuteness. After all, characters like Chip and Dale, Stitch and his girlfriend Angel, and Duffy are all idolized over there, so our little avian guy exploded onto the scene. Eight years later, Disney in America tried again by making new merchandise with the Orange Bird, sans his song, and he’s become a beloved icon ever since.\n\nAnd Bryant? Yeah, she kinda lost her fame as a singer and model, but she faced a bit of karmic justice. Her controversial nature alienated a lot of sponsors and backers, resulting in her losing pretty much her entire career. In 1980, she divorced her husband (A quick sidenote: she cited he was abusive, which, given he outspokenly blames gay people for their divorce, I’m inclined to believe, so I’ll leave one token of sympathy for her on that front.), which caused her to be shunned by her fundamentalist Christian groups, where she bemoaned how unfair it was to be hated by the church by making her own choices (HMM…YA DON’T SAY.), and in 2021, her granddaughter announced she was marrying the woman of her dreams. Since then, she’s stayed pretty well out of the spotlight. And if she’s happier there, I guess everyone came out a winner there.\n\nPretty wild stories, huh? If you know any others, I’d like to hear what you have to offer!\n\nWhat do you know about the voices of some of Disney’s most beloved animated stars? Let’s see what you know!\n\n1. In The Great Mouse Detective (1986), when Basil and Olivia almost get seen by Basil’s upstairs neighbor, one Sherlock Holmes, we hear him and Watson conversing. It took some time and legal dealing, but that is the voice of the OG Sherlock of cinema, Basil Rathbone. Basil already had another Disney animation screen credit as the narrator for The Wind in the Willows (1949).\n\n2. We all love Kristen Bell as the playful yet pure-hearted princess Anna from Frozen (2013). However, she also has two whole words in Zootopia (2016) …as Priscilla. (“Yes…Flash?”)\n\n3. It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) (Distributed by United Artists) stars some of cinema’s greatest comedians, but Disney fans should keep an eye out for Stan Freberg (The beaver in Lady and the Tramp), Don Knotts (Mayor Turkey Lurkey in Chicken Little), Buddy Hackett (Scuttle from The Little Mermaid), Mickey Rooney (Tod from The Fox and the Hound), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck from Robin Hood), Nicodemus Stewart (Br’er Bear from Song of the South), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss from Robin Hood), and Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh, among many others).\n\n4. John Cleese was approached to play Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast (1991), but turned it down in favor of playing Cat R. Waul in An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991).\n\n5. Sir Patrick Stewart cites turning down the role of Jafar in Aladdin (1992) as one of his biggest career regrets, as he had obligations for Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time.\n\n6. Ed Wynn was unable to recreate the performance he did on a soundstage for the animators. Instead of using any soundbooth recordings, we can hear his lines as the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland (1951) has a slight reverb.\n\n7. Jeremy Irons blew out his vocal chords singing “Be Prepared” in The Lion King (1994) Jim Cummings, already voicing Ed the hyena, took over. Irons’ last line is “YOU WON’T GET A SNIFF OUT OF ME!”, and Cummings’ first is “Be prepared for the coup of the century”.\n\n8. Ben Wright had voiced Roger Radcliffe in 101 Dalmatians (1961) and Rama, Mowgli’s wolf father in The Jungle Book (1967). However, directors had no idea who he was when he was hired as Grimsby in The Little Mermaid (1989) and had to tell them.\n\n9. Though Sterling Holloway didn’t make his big debut with Disney until Dumbo (1941), a note by Walt Disney shows even during the development of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) he had his name next to Sleepy, indicating he knew of him and wanted to hire him even back then. However, the role instead went to Pinto Colvig, who also voiced Grumpy.\n\n10. Rosie O’Donnell was happy to voice Terk in Tarzan (1999), but only under one condition: she wanted her own song. As luck would have it, Phil Collins already wrote “Trashin’ the Camp” for her.\n\n11. There are numerous traditions in staging Peter Pan. Like the crocodile played by offstage ticking or Tinker Bell played by a spotlight. Obviously, neither of these were translated over to the 1953 Disney adaptation. But one that WAS kept was casting Hans Conried as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook.\n\n12. Chris Sanders, co-writer and co-director of Lilo and Stitch (2002) used to use his Stitch voice to call coworkers and antagonize them before it was used in the film.\n\n13. We know Stan “The Man” Lee had cameos in virtually every Marvel film right up through Avengers: Endgame (2019). But Stan not only had a voiceless cameo in Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018), but since Big Hero 6 (2014) was a Marvel property too, he makes an appearance – voice and all – as Fred’s dad in a post-credit scene. Stan even reprised the role in the subsequent TV series.\n\n14. The primary reason Goofy starred in his own series of “How-To” cartoons is because his original voice actor, story man Pinto Colvig, left the Disney studio in 1937, and the studio never found a good enough replacement. He would return in the forties and continued to voice Goofy until his passing in 1967.\n\n15. Kathryn Beaumont has her legacy secured as both Alice from Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Wendy Darling in Peter Pan (1953). But she wouldn’t let age stop her from reprising her role as Alice in 2002’s Kingdom Hearts.\n\n16. Lucille LaVerne provided the voice for the Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), including after her transformation into the old hag. All she had to do was take out her false teeth.\n\n17. Mel Blanc, the legendary man known for voicing most all of the Looney Tunes, has only three credits with Disney. One is a parrot and Uncle Orville on the Carousel of Progress (“No privacy at all around this place!”). The other is in Pinocchio (1940) as Gideon. Several lines were written for the character until it was decided to try and make Gideon popular like Dopey, hence his silence. All we hear of it now is a single hiccup. Interestingly, one of the last times Blanc ever voiced Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester was in his third Disney credit, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), which was one of his last projects before his death in 1990.\n\n18. In Enchanted (2007), a news reporter reporting on the incident in the pizza restaurant signs off as Mary Ilene Caselotti. This is an homage to Mary Costa (The voice of Aurora), Ilene Woods (The voice of Cinderella), and Adrianna Caselotti (The voice of Snow White).\n\n19. Bob Peterson, a Pixar story man and the voice of several characters for the studio (Such as Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo (2003) and Roz in Monsters, Inc. (2001)), was inspired by his time as a camp counselor when a child ran up to him and said “I just met you and I love you!”. He later used this greeting for Dug the dog in Up (2009)\n\n20. Are you a Seinfeld fan? Patton Oswalt (Remy in Ratatouille) is a video rental clerk in “The Couch”. Sarah Silverman (Vanellope in Wreck-it Ralph) appeared in “The Money” as Kramer’s girlfriend, Emily. James Hong (Chi Fu in Mulan) is the seating host in “The Chinese Restaurant”. Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa in The Lion King) is the naked guy in “The Subway”. Lee Arenberg (Pintel in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) is in “The Parking Space”. Bette Midler (Georgette in Oliver & Company) played herself in “The Understudy”. Brad Garrett (Gusteau in Ratatouille, Hook hand in Tangled, among others) played Tony, Jerry’s mechanic in “The Bottle Deposit”. Patrick Warburton (Kronk in The Emperor’s New Groove) plays Elaine’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, Puddy. Jerry Stiller (Uncle Max in The Lion King 1 1/2) played Frank Costanza. Estelle Harris (Mrs. Potato Head in the Toy Story franchise) is Estelle Costanza. Wayne Knight (Tantor in Tarzan, Zurg in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command) was Newman. Michael Richards appeared as a caveman in Epcot’s Universe of Energy (1996-2017). Jason Alexander played Hugo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Abis Mal in the Aladdin television series. Julia Louis-Dreyfus appeared in A Bug’s Life (1998) and Onward (2020) as well as MCU’s Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. But you know who has never appeared in a Disney production? Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n21. Song of the South (1946) gets a lot of flak for its racist depictions, and it’s not unwarranted. Regardless, James Baskett pulled his weight as not just Uncle Remus, but also the voice of Br’er Fox, and when Johnny Lee was away on a USO Tour, he voiced Br’er Rabbit in the “Laughin’ Place” segment, too. The man earned his honorary Oscar, but it’s no less cringey to know before this movie… he played a crow in Dumbo (1941)\n\n22. In Aladdin (1992), where the vendor in the opening tries to sell you his wares, it was a complete improv session for Robin Williams (Originally, the movie ended to reveal the vendor was really the Genie in human guise). Given a box of props, he went nuts with the materials given, in true Robin fashion. Animator Eric Goldberg recalled when he pulled out a bra and sold it as ” a double yamulkah” and “a double slingshot”, and how it wasn’t allowed to be in the movie, despite their best efforts.\n\n23. The Producers (2005) is a beloved Mel Brooks production, starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane. Both men headlined in The Lion King (1994) as adult Simba and Timon, respectively. Wouldn’t it be cool if Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa) was there, too? Actually, he was! As a bartender! Too bad his scene was cut in the theatrical version.\n\n24. Ever since Figment was returned to Epcot’s Journey Into Your Imagination in 2002, he’s been voiced by Dave Goelz, best known as the puppeteer and voice of The Muppet’s Great Gonzo (In the 1983 iteration, Figment was voiced by comedian Billy Barty). However, he’s not the only Muppet performer to have done a character voice for Disney. Frank Oz (Yoda, Miss Piggy, Grover, Fozzie, Bert, and many more) played Funguss, Randall’s assistant in Monsters, Inc. (2001)\n\n25. There’s only been a few times where the voice actors portray their animated counterparts apart from their animated appearances. One of the first is Kathryn Beaumont, who played Alice on television a few times, including 1950’s One Hour in Wonderland (Though if you want, you can count Sterling Holloway wearing a bow tie as the Cheshire Cat on The Fred Waring Show, too!). Scott Weinger famously wore Aladdin’s duds in the episode of Full House where the Tanner family goes to Walt Disney World. His opponent, Jonathan Freeman, the voice of Jafar, originated the role on Broadway when the show opened in 2014. And if that Moana live action remake goes through, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (Maui) and Auli’i Cravalho (Moana) will join the ranks.\n\n26. In Zootopia (2016), a panicked pig shopkeeper alerts Judy that Duke Weaselton just stole a bunch of flower bulbs. Hopps was voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and the pig is voiced by Josh Dallas; both of whom at the time were co-starring on ABC’s Once Upon a Time when the movie came out as Snow White/Mary Margaret and Prince Charming/David Nolan.\n\n27. On ABC’s Home Improvement, an episode called “I was a Teenage Taylor” provided a particularly snarky meta gag for those in the know. On Halloween, Randy (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) gives a kid in a spaceman costume one piece of candy, and a kid dressed as a lion seven. JTT played young Simba in The Lion King (1994), and his dad, played by Tim Allen, was Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story (1995)\n\n28. Three Disney princesses cameo in Enchanted (2007). Jodi Benson (Ariel) plays Sam, Robert’s secretary. Second is when Nathaniel catches a soap opera, the woman is played by Paige O’Hara, who played Belle in Beauty and the Beast (1991). Lastly, when Prince Edward stumbles onto an apartment where a pregnant woman with three kids grumbles, “You’re too late,” the actress is Judy Kuhn, the singing voice of Pocahontas.\n\n29. When Baloo tickles King Louie’s armpits to get him to drop his crumbling temple in The Jungle Book (1967), that’s not Louis Prima laughing. It’s a reused track of Br’er Rabbit’s laughter from Song of the South (1946). Specifically, when Br’er Bear shoves the beehive onto Br’er Fox’s head.\n\n30. Stephanie Beatriz was nine months pregnant while belting out her powerful number “Waiting on a Miracle” in Encanto (2021).\n\n31. Idina Menzel already made a name for herself on Broadway in Rent and Wicked, thanks to her renowned voice. When she transitioned to film, she wanted to be sure she could flex her acting chops first and foremost. Thus, one of her first onscreen roles was Nancy Tremaine in Enchanted (2007), where, despite it being a musical, she didn’t sing. And as we all know, she never sang for Disney ever.\n\n32.
