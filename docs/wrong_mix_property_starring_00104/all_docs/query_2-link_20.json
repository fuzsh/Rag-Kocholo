        "text": "Let’s Talk Turkey!\n\nMike Moon is the kind of well-informed enthusiast most of us run-of-the-mill types turn to when we want answers to the most basic of life’s conundrums involving all things anime, comic book or science-fiction/fantasy related.\n\nA prolific writer and illustrator, you can peruse Mike’s handiwork, stories and art along with those of guest contributors at his Catgirl Island Website (http://www.catgirlisland). Do your interests lie elsewhere? Then you don’t want to miss the latest action-adventure movie reviews, interviews and other fun stuff at The Mew: The Catgirl Critics’ Media Mewsings site (http://mewsings.wordpress.com).\n\nI met Mike a few years ago at the annual Animazement Convention in North Carolina. Consequently, I’ve been meaning to interview him ever since that first encounter (cue: John Williams’ score). After our second and third meetings at similar gatherings in and around town, I came away with the feeling that sooner or later our paths would cross again and that I simply had to get his views across in print.\n\nLuckily, the timing was right for us to exchange a few questions and answers. And here they are:\n\nJosmar Lopes—I’d like to extend a warm welcome to Mike Moon. Hiya, Mike! I want to introduce readers to your extensive knowledge and astute observations and opinions about the anime, science fiction, fantasy, action-adventure, you-name-it realms.\n\nMike Moon—This is so flattering and fun and I think you’ve greatly overrated my significance or knowledge, but I’ll be happy to answer your questions, and hopefully I won’t be too boring or rambling!\n\nJ.L.—Somehow, I doubt that’s possible. But first, let’s get a little background information and context. Where did you go to college?\n\nM.M.—You’re far too kind! I went to the University of Southern California (USC), Alamance Community College (ACC), and North Carolina State University (NCSU – twice); and while I was in high school, I got to study art at the North Carolina Governor’s School East at St. Andrew’s Presbyterian College in Laurinburg.\n\nJ.L.—What subject did you major in and why did you choose that particular field?\n\nM.M.—I was in cinema school at USC, because I was fascinated by how movies and TV shows were made, especially the design, animation and FX [portions], but I later realized that what I really wanted to study was art or design. While I was there in Los Angeles I got to meet my favorite designer Syd Mead, who inspired me to later get my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Industrial Design (formerly known as Product Design) at NCSU. In between those two degrees, to further improve my skills I got a Certificate in Computer Graphics at ACC, although these days I still use traditional media in addition to the digital tools!\n\nJ.L.—This may be a complicated subject to tackle in one shot, but how has your knowledge of design helped you in your anime and sci-fi interests?\n\nM.M.—What little I know of design has made me better appreciate my other hobbies and interests such as illustration, photography, cosplay, comics, animation, toys and collectibles. I pay more attention to how things are illustrated, designed, sculpted, molded, manufactured, assembled, stitched, painted, photographed, printed, or packaged! I scrutinize the intricacy of the sculpt, paint, seams and articulation of the action figures, dolls, prop and vehicle replicas, plushies; and I love to see the elaborate dioramas that are built for figures, dolls, miniatures and models.\n\nI’m fascinated when a movie or TV show (live action or animated) has enough talent, money, time, technology and desire to achieve extremely believable, realistic technical or historical accuracy in their sets, props, hair, make-up, costumes and FX in serving a good, believable story. I love to see lavish spectacle and amazing sets, mecha, etc., on screen when no expense is spared.\n\nOne of the many reasons that Star Trek – The Motion Picture is my favorite movie (Trek or otherwise) is because of its epic sense of realism – and that extends to the instrumentation, buttons, consoles and graphics of the sets. I think it’s the best that Star Trek has ever looked. It looks so futuristic, realistic and enormous, as if they actually built and filmed the starships and space stations in outer space. It’s not just a bunch of blinking lights, with decks that look like distilleries, torpedo rooms and turbo-lift shafts that make no sense, or the unfortunate attempts at humor when people hit their head on something, as in the later Trek movies. Of course, Star Treks II-VI do have some very thrilling, fun and dramatic scenes, but they don’t feel nearly as realistic, expensive or futuristic enough.\n\nHowever, ironically I’m also very forgiving of fan films or smaller budgeted professional productions, even if the budget and technology is not there yet, but if it’s clear that they have a lot of heart and care for their craft. I know what it’s like to be a designer having to work fast on a tight budget from being part of the stage crew in high school, my own amateur film-making, and as a design-school student. We would often search the recycle bins and junkyards for scraps and materials for things we might have to build!\n\nJ.L.—That’s all part of the fun, I’d gather.\n\nM.M.—Look at Doctor Who, for example, especially its first 30 years. Some folks were negatively critical of the sets, monsters and FX. I’ll agree that some of them could have looked nicer, but as I watch the DVDs’ documentaries, listen to the commentaries, and learn more of the challenges faced with such a fast schedule and small budget week after week, it only increases my admiration for the show. I think the whole cast and crew did an amazing, clever, ingenious job to tell entertaining stories about characters we care about amidst the wonders of the universe. That’s part of the reason the show has endured for 50 years.\n\nA lot of time, talent, ingenuity and money go into designing things for movies and TV shows, in hopes of creating believable characters and environments for the story. And yet it’s a shame when designers don’t get enough credit. The Oscars coverage spends more time on what actors are wearing to the show than the costumes or other things designed for the movies. Now I could ramble on about my favorite actors, but they get to appear on so many more magazine covers and TV shows throughout the year than, say, production designers, cinematographers or visual FX supervisors.\n\nIt seems like every other award recipient gets so little time to make their acceptance speeches, compared to the actors and singers. I could also ramble on about my favorite fashion, music and comedy, but I think the televised Oscars ceremony spends way too much time on song and dance numbers, and scripted comedy segments. There are already enough music awards shows as it is. I wish it was more about honoring the designers, engineers, scientists and technicians that make movies possible to begin with.\n\nJ.L.—Those are exactly the kinds of arguments worth spending time on! And I’m in total agreement with the faux glitz that passes for awards shows. Indeed, not enough time is given “on the air” to the technical/professional side of movie- or album-making. With that thought in mind, who have you and “The Ladies of The Mew” interviewed?\n\nM.M.—Oh gosh, a bunch a folks, real and fictional! The first guests of The Mew were several cast members of my webmaster Jamie’s web comic Clan of the Cats, in August 2007. Jamie would also contribute the occasional reviews, too. Then in October 2007 we interviewed two toy collectors, Power Rangers expert Pacozord and Actionfigurologist ob1. Gosh, some of those early Mews were rather lean compared to later years that sometimes got up to six times longer!\n\nFebruary 2008 was the 1st annual Mew Awards presentation. March 2008 was the special cosplay edition of The Mew, with artist/cosplayer guests Crissy Teverini, Hezachan, Misty Hopkins and Tonomurabix. May 2008 was the 1st Anniversary of The Mew, and the theme of that giant-sized edition was music, with vocalist Lisa Kyle, Klingon Karaoke-singer Capt. Keela sutai-Septaric, the band Three Quarter Ale, Pink Lady fan Jeff Branch, radio DJ and Animazement staffer Phil Lee, and Jamie’s chat about Beatlemania. The August 2008 Mew included the first of several music reviews over the years by our guest critic-friend Kaiser.\n\nOctober 2008 was another big month with several guests: author Marna Martin, Star Wars fan Tiawyn, Tari of Sharon Williams’s story “Osiris Rising,” blogger Sparky MacMillan, plush toy maker Igor 9, and Jeff Branch again. The November 2008 guests were Jennie Breeden who is the creator of the web comic The Devil’s Panties, and Niki Lemonade who is the creator of the web comic My Fake Heart! The December 2008 guests were artist Emathyst; artist, author and game designer Jamie Davenport; model and milliner Joei Reed; artist and cosplayer Sarah “Sakky” Hughes, comics writer/journalist Dan Johnson, and a special vignette about Sara “Glory” Baker.\n\nThen I started 2009 off with more of the cast of Clan of the Cats in January’s Mew! February 2009 was the 2nd annual Mew Awards, with an update on our prior guests; the March 2009 guest was Alexandra Wright of Jeff Branch’s story Dark Skin Red Blood; the May 2009 guest was author/artist Ursula Vernon, and our June 2009 guest was ghost investigator and professional costumer/performer Cheralyn Lambeth; the September 2009 guests were artists Rebecca Brogden and Alan Welch; the October 2009 guest was web comics author/artist Clint Hollingsworth. That November’s guests were A Girl and Her Fed’s creator Otter, and Corrine of Clan of the Cats!\n\nDecember’s guests were cousins Deborah and Devra Langsam, who were among the first pioneering Star Trek fans of the 1960’s. They were part of that famous campaign to save Star Trek from cancellation.\n\nJ.L.—I remember that campaign! I knew a guy who was so into Star Trek at the time, he even came to class sporting Mr. Spock’s haircut and a homemade pair of Vulcan ears.\n\nM.M.—Oh, Star Trek is probably my most knowledgeable topic. I love to study the history of the fandom. Deborah and Devra helped to publish the very first Star Trek fanzine, Spockanalia in 1967, and were part of the committee that launched the very first Star Trek Conventions in 1972! Of course, since then they’ve been up to a lot of other things: Devra Langdam has been a librarian, a publisher, an SCA member and a bookseller at various festivals, whilst Dr. Deborah Langsam has been a botany professor, a fiber artist and a chocolatier.\n\nJ.L.—A chocolatier…? I wouldn’t let her near Tribbles if I were you!\n\nM.M.—Well, not unless there was one of those Tribble-eatin’ Glomars patrolling nearby! Speaking of the cuisine, our guests for January 2010 included our friend Chef Ron who is quite the cook, and (Marvel Comics) Avengers expert Professor Van Plexico. That February’s Mew included the 3rd annual Mew Awards, the May guest was model/cosplayer Rainbow Fish aka Chainmail Chick; the July guest list featured comics artist/journalist Jim Amash and returning comics artist/author Andrew Pepoy! The August 2010 guests included artist/author Alexcia Reynolds and returning guest Sakky; and the September guest was journalist and book editor Eric Nolen-Weathington of TwoMorrows Publishing!\n\nThat brings us up to the October 2010 edition of The Mew, which included the Catgirls’ interviews with the members of Child-Eating Books Studio which was founded in 2007 by artists Lucy Kagan, Allison Kupatt, and sisters Natalia and Thais Lopes, who I believe you know!\n\nJ.L.—You bet I do! They’re my anime-loving daughters!\n\nM.M.—Like so many other folks, Natalia and Thais are far more active in fandom and cons these days than I am, and I’m sure they know a lot more about cosplay and the more recent anime, manga, visual and performing arts than I do! Oh, by the way, I should mention that The Catgirl Island Mewseum of Art is graced by a lot of lovely illustrations and photos from many of our great guests and other much appreciated artists! The Catgirl Island Public Library is also honored to have a few tales of the island by some guest authors too!\n\nThere were no guests for the January 2011 Mew, but in February many past guests were in attendance for the 4th annual Mew Awards, which would be much more elaborate from then on, and take much longer to write! So would the anniversary edition of The Mew every May, with a bit more plot elements being added from 2011 on. Artist Elisa Chong was our great guest for June 2011, but 2011 and 2012 were kind of sparse years for interviews. The Mew kept getting longer, though, but it was mostly comprised of discussions and reviews.\n\nOK, we’re up to 2012, and that February’s 5th annual Mew Awards and May’s 5th Anniversary Mew were even bigger than the previous year, with more characters, plot, and more of the past guests in attendance for both events. Performing artist and model Lady Violet Arcane was the August 2012 guest. Although he was not actually a guest of The Mew, I did enjoy a few phone conversations with AC Comics’ artist/writer/Editor in Chief Mark Heike, as part of my research for the September 2012 Mew’s Celebrity Catgirl Spotlight! That was another opportunity that I am very grateful for!\n\nAlmost done! There were a lot of past guests at the 6th annual Mew Awards in February 2013; cosplayers Rosemary Ward and Des, who I met at the G.I. Joe Collectors Convention, were the May 2013 guests; artist Lela Dowling was the June 2013, and it was so nice to see the entire Lopes family amongst the crowd gathered for the 7th annual Mew Awards in the February 2014 Mew! That’s pretty much all of the folks thus far who have been interviewed for The Mew, but that does not include all of the other wonderful guest artists and authors who have kindly contributed to the art and tales at Catgirl Island!\n\nJ.L.—That’s quite an impressive rundown, Mike! Moving right along, I understand you’ve talked to the great Syd Mead? What a thrill that must have been!\n\nM.M.—Oh yeah, I have been so fortunate and honored to have met and chatted with him several times over the past few decades! He’s my favorite designer and has been such a huge inspiration, ever since I got his Sentinel book, not long after my favorite movie Star Trek – The Motion Picture premiered. Since then my collection of Syd Mead stuff has grown quite a bit! The first time I met him was while I was in L.A. at USC. I spoke with him briefly by phone a couple of times, and he invited me to his house! That was in February of 1983 when I visited him for a few hours, and we chatted while he worked on a painting.\n\nThat was just several months after Blade Runner and Tron were in theaters. Meeting him was part of the reasons why I didn’t stay in film school at USC, and why I was inspired to later major in Industrial Design at NCSU. I even started using an Iwata HP-C airbrush loaded with Winsor-Newton Designer Gouache like he used, although I haven’t used either in years, especially in these digital days. I spoke to him a few more times, and then met him for the 2nd time when he gave a lecture and presentation at NCSU’s School of Design. I think that was in 2001… and the 3rd time I met him was again at NCSU several years later.\n\nJ.L.—Can you elaborate for us what the gist of your conversations with Mead were about? What subjects did you discuss and which films did Mead touch base with and describe?\n\nM.M.—When I met him the first time I think the conversation mainly pertained to his illustration tools and techniques, and his work on Star Trek, Blade Runner and Tron while I watched him work. The latter time when he was at NCSU was not long after Mission Impossible III and the publication of his Sentury 2 book. The main things I chatted with him about prior to this presentation were his anime work, such as Yamato 2520 and Turn a Gundam. It was also nice to chat with a few of my industrial design professors and the head of the department who it was great to see again.\n\nJ.L.—Not only can we tell that you’re a big sci-fi fan, but you’re a regular convention-goer as well. How did you first get involved in cons?\n\nM.M.—As for my first interest in cons, I loved going to fairs and festivals, hobby and collector shows, car shows, organized Halloween/costume activities, but as a kid all I knew about cons were what I’d read in magazines and books. But I guess the first actual convention that I attended was one in L.A. in 1983. It picked up for me in the mid-80s as a member of the Carolina Comic Book Club, when we made the trips to Heroes Con in Charlotte. Also about that time were other Star Trek, science fiction and comic book cons popping up in the state, ranging from the student and fan club to the corporate-sponsored events.\n\nIn the 90’s, I attended more ‘n’ more cons. including some in other nearby states, cosplayed more often, and sometimes had an artist’s table. The first actual anime-specific con I attended was Katsucon, along with fellow members of the Triangle Area Anime Society. That was also the first time I helped as a volunteer at a con. Later some of us at TAAS decided to start our own anime con here in North Carolina – and thus was launched Animazement! Since then I’ve been to cons, shows and festivals of all types, either as a volunteer, staffer, artist, dealer, guest or just a regular attendee. In the past few years I’ve attended some that are further out, in Cincinnatti, New Orleans and Indianapolis.\n\nJ.L.—Along those same lines, what attracted you to anime?\n\nM.M.—What initially attracted me to anime was the art style, and my own art style was definitely influenced by anime in the 70’s. Back then I collected the Shogun Warriors toys and watched Speed Racer, but it was Battle of the Planets in ‘78 and Star Blazers in ‘79 which totally hooked me. That was not just due to the character or mecha designs, but the storytelling, characters, serious plots and serialized stories – even when heavily edited for North American audiences.\n\nThat’s when I really started to actively search for more information about anime and stuff to collect, as If I didn’t already have enough hobbies! It was a great time for me to be a fan in that post-Star Wars era of the late 70’s, what with anime, Doctor Who, DVD, video games, the return of Star Trek, James Bond, other big SF and horror movies, plus the comics, toys and music of the time, but those would each be other big topics!\n\nAnother thing is that sadly for the longest time in the U.S. there has often been the attitude that animation (and comics) are just for kids, whereas animation in Japan is such a huge industry, like our own live-action TV and movie industry, of great diversity and genres, with shows intended for kids, teens, adults, men, women, family. Fortunately the attitudes in the U.S. have changed for the better in the past couple of decades.\n\nJ.L.—Do you have a particular favorite from among the thousands of anime out there?\n\nM.M.—OK, as for my favorite anime… oh, gosh, that could be a very long list of movies, TV series, OVA’s and music videos! I like so much of it from the past six decades, of almost every genre from science fiction, fantasy and horror to romantic comedy, sports and slice-of-life. Of course, there’s plenty that I do not like too, but let’s not go into that! There are so many anime authors, artists, directors, composers, voice actors and characters that I like!\n\nI’m a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki’s works, such as Spirited Away, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds, My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke and so forth! To this day, his 1979 movie The Castle of Cagliostro (starring Lupin the 3rd) is the first title that I would ever recommend to anyone who is curious about Japanese anime.\n\nJ.L.—Miyazaki-san is the King of Japanese anime! There’s no one better!\n\nM.M.—He’s my favorite director, of animation or otherwise! I’m a big fan of Space Battleship Yamato, which might be the most significant anime of all time. I especially like the Yamato movies such as Arrivederci Yamato, Be Forever Yamato, and Final Yamato which are such beautiful, dramatic, epic space operas. I also like Galaxy Express and other works by Leiji Matsumoto, and Mamoru Hosoda’s films, among them The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Summer Wars, and Wolf Children.\n\nI’m very fond of Rumiko Takahashi’s series such as Maison Ikkoku, and Urusei Yatsura’s Ranma 1/2. I like Kosuke Fujishima and Masamune Shirow’s works a lot, too. My favorite anime of the 80’s includes Ah! My Goddess, Akira, Area 88, Bubblegum Crisis, Dirty Pair, Gunbuster, Gundam, Kimagure Orange Road, Macross, Mysterious Cities of Gold, Patlabor, Silent Möbius, Transformers: The Movie, and Vampire Princess Miyu.\n\nAs for the 90’s, I’d say Battle Athletes, Blue Seed, Blue Submarine Number Six, Cowboy Bebop, Devil Hunter Yohko, Ghost Sweeper Mikami, Hyper Police, Idol Project, Nadia, Nuku Nuku, Tenchi, Weathering Continent… and I think Sailor Moon is probably the most important anime of the 90’s, because not only does it have such a good strong cast of heroines, but it is especially responsible for attracting many female fans in the U.S. – and nowadays anime fandom seems to be 50-50 male/female!\n\nJ.L.—I can vouch for that. My own daughters were lucky recipients of the anime boom.\n\nM.M.—I was so glad when anime, manga, games and related items finally became pretty much mainstream by the end of the 90’s, and thus much more accessible, affordable, influential and inspirational, with more ‘n’ more cons, clubs and web sites popping up everywhere. But that was 14 years ago and fandom has changed so much since then – for example, nowadays if you go to a con such as Animazement or Libraricon [in Fayetteville], the younger fans are representing non-anime stuff such as My Little Pony, Doctor Who, Homestuck, Marvel and DC, etc.\n\nI’m a pony fan too! It’s a great, positive, fun show for fans of all ages, ethnicities and genders. Kids today have grown up in a time where anime is as common here as anything else. But then, most anime fans have always been fans of other stuff too, such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, comics, games, rennfaires, the highland games, hockey, college basketball, fishing or whatever people are fans of. But I digress again!\n\nBack to favorite anime, some of my favorites of the 2000’s are Azumanga Daioh, Bamboo Blade, Daphne in the Brilliant Blue, Genshiken, Kami-Chu, K-ON, Maria Watches Over Us, Millennium Actress, Princess Nine, Strike Witches, and Magical Meow Meow Taruto. I definitely have to mention the TV series Aria, which is an adaptation of the Aqua and Aria manga by Kozue Amano – it’s my favorite Japanese anime TV series of the past 15 years. As for this current decade of the 2010’s, ah, I rather like Cat Planet Cuties, Girls & Panzer, Lagrange, Sound of the Sky, Spice and Wolf, and Taisho Baseball Girls. Some of my recent favorite manga are Sunshine Sketch, Geijutsuka Art Design Class, A Centaur’s Life and Omamori Himari.\n\nAs you may have noticed from Catgirl Island (www.catgirlisland.net) and The Mew, I’m rather fond of anime, manga and other artistry that feature catgirls, kitsune, faeries and mermaids, but I guess I’ve mentioned enough for now. Things like comics, manga, art and books would be other pretty big topics! I still have too way many hobbies!\n\nJ.L.—Speaking for myself, I first got into anime and sci-fi after catching the original run of Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy on our local New York TV station (Channel 5). After that, I remember seeing Gigantor, Kimba the White Lion, Super Car, Planet Patrol, Fireball XL5, 8Man, and the unavoidable Speed Racer. Do you remember the first anime you ever saw?\n\nM.M.—Oh yeah, in the late 60’s our kindergarten went to the movie theater to see Alakazam the Great. I was very young at the time, and didn’t realize it was Japanese animation, but I did notice the style was different from most of the American animated movies and cartoons I’d seen.\n\nJ.L.—When did you first start writing your blog?\n\nM.M.—Some friends and other artists thought I had a knack for critiques, and because I can be very thorough and fair in my opinions, my webmaster Jamie suggested that I write a review blog. I forget when I first started pondering and writing it, but it was in early 2007 when I determined the style, format, tone, schedule and policies for my blog, as an extension of Catgirl Island (which I created in 1998); and the Catgirl Critics’ Media Mewsings: The Mew “purremiered” in May 2007! It quickly evolved to be much lengthier, and to include the slice-of-life situations for more and more of my meta-fictional characters, their annual “awards,” the occasional guest contributions, and the interviews with artists, authors, performers, collectors and fans.\n\nJ.L.—Have you met many interesting folks thru convention going and/or blog writing? I know I have!\n\nM.M.—I was already so fortunate to meet lots of nice folks at the cons as a fellow fan, artist, dealer or staffer, but writing The Mew definitely helped lead to a lot of acquaintances and friendships. That includes a bunch of folks who I’ve never actually met, but whose work I greatly admire, whether they are famous or not yet famous!\n\nJ.L.—Do you have any boxed-set editions of your favorite films and/or anime series in your eclectic library or collection?\n\nM.M.—Oh yes, I have quite a few movie and TV boxed sets! I prefer it when the box is in the standard height case so that it will fit on the shelf with other DVDs, and I prefer it when the disks are secured in individual trays and not in a big stack. But I love it when a DVD includes special features such as audio commentaries, info texts, isolated music tracks, spoken language and subtitle options, storyboards, screenplays, image galleries, documentaries, publicity materials, different versions, any deleted scenes and outtakes, gag reels, booklets and so forth.\n\nSome of my favorites are the Star Trek – The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Alien, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator II, Dawn of the Dead, Die Hard, Pulp Fiction, and the extended Lord of the Rings sets. Unfortunately, it seems like standard DVDs too often these days have fewer and fewer extras, not like they used to, especially movies, compared to Blu-ray Disks. However, there are a lot of great deals on TV-show boxed sets, especially older shows, and you can get some of the no-frills sets for pretty low prices.\n\nDoctor Who DVDs have some great special features too. Japanese anime is so much more affordable now than it used to be, compared to back in the days of VHS, laser disks, and imports! One of the semi-annual topics of The Mew is the DVD Wish List. There are a lot of old-and-new foreign and domestic movies and TV shows that I’m still hoping to be commercially released or re-released here on Region 1 NTSC standard DVD, but every year I’m pleasantly surprised!\n\nJ.L.—Thanks so much, Mike, for your time, availability and “purrfectly” candid responses.\n\nM.M.—Oh, it was my pleasure, you’re welcome, and thank you sir! Perhaps later on down the road the Ladies of the Mew might wish to “intermew” you too!\n\nJ.L.—I look forward to it!\n\nCopyright © 2014 by Josmar F. Lopes\n\nAnyone who knows me knows that I’m a devoted fan of science-fiction movies. I also happen to love fantasy and horror flicks. The good ones, that is – not the schlock that nowadays passes for quality.\n\nA few years back, I decided to take this devotion a step further by compiling a list of my favorite (and not so favorite) features in each genre. Many of these films are in my personal collection; others I’ve been exposed to only in theaters or on TV. Still, I couldn’t wait to tell others how I felt about them; in other words, what I found fascinating and enlightening, dull and boring regarding, intriguing and diverting about each one. I needed to share my views with like-minded readers, to see if my thoughts made any sense.\n\nWell, here are those thoughts, updated and in semi-alphabetical order (for the most part). If there’s a favorite film out there I haven’t accounted for, feel free to put in a plug for it. As Robert De Niro once said to a clueless Jonathan Pryce, in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil: “We’re all in this together, kid.”\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nWe begin our list with Stanley Kubrick’s timeless visionary epic, a film that’s solemn and slow moving, stately and portentous to the ninth degree, but a bona fide sci-fi classic nonetheless. The elegance, serenity, majesty, and, above all, mystery of space travel are preserved here in all their widescreen splendor. Now tell me: has any sci-fi feature of the last 40 years been more fully realized on celluloid than Kubrick’s acclaimed masterpiece? The work that went into the final product is truly breathtaking. The story: highly evolved super-beings deposit their calling card on Earth (and on the Moon), in the form of a large, rectangular-shaped black monolith. With the object’s ability to implant suggestions into their brains, primitive man-apes are taught to use rudimentary weapons in order to gain dominance over their foes, as well as their harsh environment. The evolution of these man-apes into Homo sapiens leads to the next phase of development, with man literally branching out into new worlds — both physically and metaphysically — far beyond his own. But what does it all mean? The ambiguously written screenplay by director Kubrick and science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, after his short story “The Sentinel,” explores cosmic questions of the specie’s origins, its ultimate purpose, and inevitably, its fate. Keir Dullea is astronaut Dave Bowman, and Gary Lockwood his colleague Frank Poole, two of the dullest space travelers this side of Jupiter. It’s left to the HAL-9000 super-computer to supply the missing “human” element. With William Sylvester, Leonard Rossiter, Margaret Tyzack, and the flat, matter-of-fact speaking voice of Douglas Rain as HAL (no, it was not a takeoff on the acronym for IBM). Kubrick hired composer Alex North to do the background scoring, but went with a more eclectic, pre-recorded classical soundtrack instead (Richard Strauss’ Also Sprach Zarathustra and Johann Strauss, Jr.’s On the Beautiful Blue Danube, are among the orchestral delights) to serve as a commentary on the loneliness and mysticism of space exploration; he also trimmed his epic of about 20 minutes of redundant footage due to excess length. Despite the director’s penchant for authenticity, the scene of the scientists inspecting the monolith on the Moon drew criticism from, of all people, the original scenarist Clarke, who claimed the men were not bouncing around on the surface as they would normally be in life — so much for realia on the big screen. It’s on nearly everyone’s top-ten list of the best films ever made, and continues to exude a strong influence on modern movie-makers, to include Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and J.J. Abrams. Each successive generation finds new meaning in the work, and with reason. No matter how one feels about 2001: A Space Odyssey, it’s still the ultimate trip worth taking.\n\nAbbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)\n\nExemplary A & C comedy, with Universal Pictures reuniting several of its patented movie monsters for this engaging romp. Co-starring Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney, Jr., Lenore Aubert, Glenn Strange, Jane Randolph, Charles Bradstreet, Frank Ferguson, and the voice of Vincent Price. The plot involves Chick Young (Bud Abbott) and Wilbur Gray (Lou Costello) finding Count Dracula (Lugosi) and the Frankenstein monster (Strange) alive and well and living (?) in the state of Florida. Dracula is about to revive the monster for his own fiendish purposes. He enlists the aid of sexy scientist Sandra Mornay (Aubert) as an all-too willing accomplice in his scheme. Their plan: to put Wilbur’s brain in the monster’s body (yikes!). Before this nightmare can take place, Wilbur is rescued by his pal Chick and the always-nervous Lawrence Talbot (Chaney), who chooses that inopportune moment to transform into the Wolf Man. Oh, and there’s also a surprise “visit” by the Invisible Man (Price) at the end. Riotous farce with great FX for the period, amid the studio-bound sets. The boys share a fine rapport with their guests — in particular Lugosi, who was nearing the end of his black-caped career. It’s hard to tell if his pasty-faced countenance was due to makeup or his debilitating drug habit (well documented in Tim Burton’s equally worthy Ed Wood). Appropriately eerie score by Frank Skinner, reused innumerable times for Universal’s subsequent monster pix. Abbott and Costello regulars Bobby Barber and Joe Kirk appear in small bits. Directed by Charles Barton, who oversaw many of the boys’ Hollywood forays. Keep your ear cocked for Lou’s flubbing of a line (“I’m telling you , Abbott” instead of “Chick”) as they look for Dracula in the cellar.\n\nAlien (1979)\n\nRather loosely based on the hoary B-picture It! The Terror From Beyond Space, this outer-space horror show provides fine chest-bursting thrills and solid shock value for the buck — albeit in slow doses. It’s more than your average monster-on-board-a-spaceship epic: with its gleaming slickness, oozing drool, and, quite unexpectedly, acid for blood, the Alien takes on overtly sexual overtones. Penetration (in all its myriad forms) is taken to the ultimate extreme — but that’s the “point” of it. It’s what our unfriendly, neighborhood Alien represents: Ripley’s (and the crew’s) scariest and most nightmarish wet dream. There’s artistry afoot, though, with credit largely due director Ridley Scott for his fine sense of the subtle: few movie-makers of his stature (at the time) have used silence to such a tension-inducing degree. When the chills do come, they literally jump out at you. Swiss artist H.R. Giger’s horrific phallic symbol is so grotesque and so disgusting, it’s beautiful. The visual effects are by Carlo Rambaldi, who went on to work on the more benign E.T. The Extraterrestrial, and other features. The young Sigourney Weaver all but steals the show as Ripley (but do pull up those panties, dearie). Co-starring top-billed Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas, Ian Holm as the secretive science officer Ash, with Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, and John Hurt as Kane. The nerve-tingling atmosphere and claustrophobic sets became famous in their own right as the “wet subway” look — a big plus, as is the gigantic spacecraft Nostromo (the name taken from a Joseph Conrad novel) and the voiceless computer Mother (shades of Norman Bates in Psycho). Kudos to Jonesy the cat for some purrfectly good scenes. The score is by Jerry Goldsmith, with an added dose of Howard Hanson towards the end. No need to tell readers how influential this film has been; it spawned a whole industry of alien-type splatter movies, and (to date) three sequels, three derivatives, and one prequel. Time has softened many of its original gross-out effects, but be warned: there are many violent and disturbing scenes for the impressionable among us – including those “twitchy” androids out there (and you know who you are!).\n\nAliens (1986)\n\nOh my goodness! Instead of one horrific Alien to challenge the senses, now there’s a whole slew of them. This non-stop, slam-bang action-packed sequel is from director James Cameron (Terminator, Piranha II). It stars Sigourney Weaver repeating her Ripley role from Alien, along with new crew members Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton (hilarious), Carrie Henn, Jenette Goldstein, William Hope, and real-life drill instructor Al Matthews. One of the writers was noted action director Walter Hill, and the novice James Horner did the anvil-crunching score (with themes recycled from his earlier Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). In this one, the Aliens not only become Ripley’s worst nightmare, they’re now every audience member’s as well. As one of the space grunts Hudson so casually observes, it’s a “bug hunt.” That it is, but what a bug they hunt! Many small details pay homage to war films, in general, and the Vietnam War experience in particular. Case in point: the little phrases written on the space marines’ hardware and helmets (“Fly the Friendly Skies,” for one). Ripley’s mechanized battle with the gigantic Alien Queen becomes an elemental struggle for survival between two mothers defending their brood. It looks forward to a similar showdown in Cameron’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and backward to the classic fight with the giant spider in Jack Arnold’s The Incredible Shrinking Man. Not the best of the breed, by any means, but without a doubt the most pleasing to date. Followed by two inferior “sequels,” if that’s the proper term: Alien3 and Alien Resurrection.\n\nAltered States (1980)\n\nEccentric genius or certifiable madman? That’s the question to be asked, in this faithful film version of Paddy Chayefsky’s science fiction novel, one of British director Ken Russell’s least scandalous screen adaptations of a literary work. The film’s biggest mystery, however, is why author Chayefksy had his name removed from the credits; it follows the outline of his book almost to the letter. Oh well, egos… William Hurt, in his smash screen debut, plays a research scientist who experiments with mind-altering drugs and isolation tanks, which transform him into a primal man-ape — sort of the evolutionary process in reverse. Blair Adams is his concerned spouse, while Bob Balaban (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and Charles Haid (Hill Street Blues) go at each other’s throats as their loudmouth friends. The final denouement is a bit of a letdown, but then again so was the novel’s. Superior FX and excellent Rick Baker makeup make this modern-day Jekyll & Hyde story a rare example of intelligent science-fiction blended with horror elements that works on an intellectual, if not exactly visceral level. It refuses to condescend to its audience, treating the subject with utmost seriousness. The atonal score is by John Corigliano, his first for the movies. He went on to do several more, including Revolution and The Red Violin. Not for all tastes, and definitely not for the kiddies (there are some steamy sex scenes to watch out for), but an absorbing film experience all the same. A must in widescreen color.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979)\n\nHighly controversial since its premiere in the late seventies, Apocalypse Now is now considered a post-Vietnam War era classic. While not exactly that — Oliver Stone’s Platoon fits this bill better, we believe — there’s still no denying its intoxicating power and influence. It’s a downer of a movie, all right, yet it remains one of the most potent, dreamlike, and surreal war films ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola literally went mad trying to keep it all together; the almost insurmountable problems he and his cast and crew encountered (and tried to overcome) while filming on location in the Philippines are vividly captured in wife Eleanor’s award-winning documentary of the shoot, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse. The story, rather loosely based on Joseph Conrad’s dense novella Heart of Darkness, concerns the search for renegade megalomaniac Army Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has set himself up as a deity somewhere in the Cambodian jungle. Tightly wound Special Forces Captain Benjamin Willard, played by the young Martin Sheen, is sent upriver to seek out and destroy the mad colonel, and thus put an end to his charade. Only, which is the worst charade: what Kurtz is attempting to do, or what the U.S. Army hopes to accomplish by killing him? The question is put forth and answered, somewhat. Many penetrating and harrowing moments throughout. There are so many great things in it (the Air Cavalry’s charge to the strains of Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries”, the USO show in the middle of nowhere, the Do Lung Bridge sequence, the tiger “attack” in the dense wood), it’s almost a sin to bring up its myriad problems, the major one being the presence of an overweight (and unintelligible) Marlon Brando as the mysteriously cryptic Colonel Kurtz. Engulfed almost entirely in shadows, Brando’s rambling readings of his lines provoke more bewilderment than enlightenment. The other problem is the episodic nature of the plot. Still, there are some dynamic performances amid the chaos, especially from Sheen (who replaced Harvey Keitel, and had a near-fatal heart attack during mid-production), Robert Duvall as the surf-loving warmonger Colonel Kilgore, Dennis Hopper as the hyper-kinetic photojournalist, Frederic Forrest as Chef, young Laurence Fishburne (he was only fourteen) as Clean, Albert Hall as Chief, Joseph Bottoms as surfer dude Lance, and G.D. Spradlin and Harrison Ford in smaller roles. Coppola himself appears as the news reporter who tells Sheen to look away from the TV camera and go about his business while explosions resound all around him. Vittorio Storaro did the superb cinematography, and Walter Murch provided the enveloping soundscape — with a nod to Brazilian jazz percussionist Airto Moreira. Try to avoid the Redux version, which only pads the story unnecessarily. The original is the one to see.\n\nBatman Forever (1995)\n\nVal Kilmer took over the role of Gotham City’s brooding crime-fighter in this fairly successful if exceedingly loud third entry in the series. Here, millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne explores the dark night of his own soul, as he dates a nubile shrink (luscious Nicole Kidman), while battling two new super-villains: the riotous Riddler, played to rubber-faced perfection by the ultra-kinetic Jim Carrey; and the repulsive Two-Face, given a slightly lower-octane performance by Tommy Lee Jones. There’s too little of him and more than enough of Carrey to go around. Superb production values and spectacular action sequences galore, all enthusiastically staged in excruciating slow-motion by new helmsman Joel Schumacher. The music, by Elliot Goldenthal, is in the style of Danny Elfman’s earlier scores for the first two films, but with a nocturnal life of its own. Also in the cast are the irreplaceable Michael Gough as dedicated manservant Alfred, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, and Chris O’Donnell as Robin, the Boy Wonder. He and Kilmer share an interesting boy-man relationship, with more than a hint of homoerotic overtones. (Hmm… check out the nipples on that bat costume, fellas!) This version is certainly better than the previous ones, but there’s something unsettling about a hero who comes off as darker, and gloomier, than the foes he’s pursuing.\n\nBatman & Robin (1997)\n\nWith former ER regular (and gorgeous hunk) George Clooney as the third Batman, expectations ran high for the series. Unfortunately, it hit a brick wall with this over-complicated, over-produced effort, directed with sledgehammer subtlety by Joel Schumacher. Elliot Goldenthal wrote the thunderous music score. Where previously Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer played the Dark Knight as troubled and moody thirty-somethings (in that order), Clooney is a more mature, misty-eyed type, especially when fretting over the (supposedly) terminally-ill butler Alfred, played by straight-laced Michael Gough. Bruce Wayne’s relationship to Robin has become less crackling as well, though Chris O’Donnell is still winning in the part. He’s given a good deal of the grunt work in this version, along with Alicia Silverstone as a preppy California-style Batgirl. Dressed as a walking wedding cake and tossing off dry one-liners (“Niiiiiice”) at the drop of an icepick, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the villainous Mr. Freeze, who decides to wreak vengeance on the dynamic duo after the accidental death of his wife. He’s joined by the vampish Poison Ivy, languidly played by Uma Thurman in a raggedy Robin Hood outfit with leaves. Neither star can save this train wreck from the home-theater black hole, where it’ll probably serve as excellent surround-sound demo fodder. There are huge, ear-shattering explosions, but it’s all for naught. We learn more than we care to about Alfred’s early love life and precious little about anyone else. The whole thing is overlong by two-and-a-half hours. Former wrestler and ex-governor of Minnesota, Jesse “The Body” Ventura, appears in a bit part, if anyone’s interested…\n\nBlade Runner (1982)\n\nStunning production design and exemplary art direction. That’s Blade Runner for you, a film that’s been influencing the look of science-fiction fantasy films — and those with apocalyptic impulses — for more than a generation, to include the likes of cyberpunk (The Matrix series), anime (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Metropolis), and other forms of mass entertainment. The Warner’s Studio had a tough time figuring it all out, though. Initially, it marketed the feature as a combination murder mystery-cum-film noir detective story, with Harrison Ford’s monotonous voiceover as a perfunctory commentary on the action (or the lack of it). The redundant narration was later dropped, much to everyone’s relief, as were a few reshuffled scenes, for the re-released 1993 director’s cut. This is now the preferred way to see this mind-boggling sci-fi epic. Based on Philip K. Dick’s novella Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it’s set in a rain-drenched, futuristic Los Angeles in which, among other things, the denizens have adopted a newfangled street slang (anyone for Esperanto?). So-called “Replicants” from an off-world mining site have gone haywire (what else is new). They’ve returned to Earth to seek out their creator in order to prolong their shortened lives. For you see, they all have built-in four-year lifespans — and time is running out. Ford plays Rick Deckard, a kind of maverick bounty hunter who appears to be on the lam himself (he’s the Blade Runner of the title). But from what, we’re not exactly sure. He meets up with the Replicants, principally pleasure model Pris (a gymnastically inclined Daryl Hannah) and the philosophical Roy Batty (rugged Rutger Hauer). He then eliminates them. That’s the plot! Sean Young plays an android or clone (or something), with flavorful turns by William Sanderson, Joe Turkel as the thick-lensed creator, and Edward James Olmos, Joanna Cassidy, and Brion James. The highly regarded synthesizer score is by Greek New Age specialist Vangelis. Ridley Scott directed, and brilliantly, I might add. Needs repeat viewings to fully appreciate the incredible depth of detail that went into the making of it. The production was designed by Syd Mead, who also worked on Cameron’s Aliens and Disney’s Tron. Mesmerizing and hypnotic, to say the least. A highlight is Hauer’s poetic speech at the end, which succinctly summarizes his existential views of humanity. There are sly commentaries about who is more deserving of a chance at life, the Replicants or the humans, and what it is that makes us human. Overall, a fascinating, thought-provoking picture, with a well deserved cult following.\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)\n\nThe very conceit of inserting the name of its original author into the title might lead viewers to expect a more faithful rendering of this oft-filmed horror tale (which it is). Except that it, too, includes more than a few embellishments to Stoker’s Gothic romance (the prologue and battle with Moslem Turks for one, and Minna Harker’s attempted seduction of Van Helsing for another) that do not appear in the novel. No matter. English actor Gary Oldman is the long-lived, blood-sucking Count Dracula, here disguised as Romanian Prince Vlad. With his long hair parted down the middle, wistful expression, low-key delivery, and tinted blue eye-shades, he’s a dead ringer for Ozzy Osbourne! Anthony Hopkins is that old vampire slayer, Professor Van Helsing, playing him to the hysterical hilt as well as in a constant state of manic flux. Winona Ryder is Minna Harker, and she’s one of the best things in the picture. Her youthful radiance and dark good looks contrast markedly with that of her counterpart Lucy Westenra, played by sexy redhead Sadie Frost. Keanu Reeves strives mightily to maintain his British accent throughout, but manages only to imbue Jonathan Harker with a high degree of detachment, in addition to varying shades of hair color — an egregiously bogus performance. Another Brit, Richard E. Grant, is terrific (as always) in the smaller but no less showy part of Dr. Jack Seward, slightly expanded from the book. Bill Campbell is fine as the Texan Quincy Morris, as is Cary Elwes as Lucy’s betrothed, Lord Arthur Holmwood. Both characters are customarily eliminated in most versions of the story. Singer-actor Tom Waits plays an even loonier Mr. Renfield than Dwight Frye ever did: Waits takes the art of insect-eating to new heights (or depths, depending on one’s viewpoint), while longtime character actor Jay Robinson (The Robe) has a bit part as his boss. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who uses every conceivable film artifice imaginable to convey the story in purely cinematic terms. The screenplay is by James V. Hart. There are gorgeous color schemes and atmospheric set designs. It’s quite impressive, really — both aurally and visually — with excellent Foley effects, art direction, and costumes (by the late Eiko Ishioka). Hard to believe it was all filmed on a sound stage. The drama lacks thrust at key moments, and tends to drag a might before the wham-bam finale, done as a fast-paced horse chase. But the powerful, romantic score of Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, which alternates his orchestra with choral and percussive effects, aids immeasurably. Recommended, but with reservations.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977-80)\n\nTogether with Star Wars and Superman, this picture practically defined the term “blockbuster” at the box office in the late 1970s. Alien visitors are about to arrive on Earth. They advertise this fact by implanting sounds and images in the minds of everyday citizens of where they’ll be gathering (stop me if you’ve heard this before). We get to meet two of them up close and personal. They’re played by Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon, who typify your average middle-class folk dragged unwittingly into something a hell of a lot bigger than they (or we) could possibly imagine. This film brought all sorts of kudos to writer-director Steven Spielberg, who has never been satisfied with the end result. Spielberg was even compared to Stanley Kubrick for his visionary themes and technical precision (they later became fast friends, with Spielberg taking over the uncompleted A.I. Artificial Intelligence project from him). The compliments are somewhat exaggerated, but the film itself is quite impressive to look at. The brilliant FX are the work of Douglas Trumbull, who worked on 2001: A Space Odyssey a decade earlier, and the cinematography is by Vilmos Szigmond. The DVD/Blu-ray Disc releases incorporate all existing versions of the film, as well as additional deleted scenes, to form a more complete “Special Edition” of one of the best science-fiction fantasies of recent times. It’s far from perfect, however. There are some discernible lapses in the story line, especially concerning the Dreyfuss character, and the dialogue borders on incoherence (the dinner table sequences are especially trying). The added scenes do help to bring a clearer narrative focus to the whole, but the parts are still a bit fuzzy. It’s as if Spielberg were reluctant to spend time on the more down-to-earth aspects while itching to get on to the big finish. And what a finish it is! The appearance of the alien mother ship still takes one’s breath away with its awesome grandeur. John Williams’ powerful score figures prominently here; indeed, the film owes much of its success to his instantly recognizable main theme, which incorporates the Disney tune, “When You Wish Upon A Star,” towards the end. Speaking of that ending, the “Special Edition” takes the viewer inside the mother ship, but in truth it’s more buildup than actual payoff. Others in the cast are Terri Garr as Dreyfuss’ harried wife, Bob Balaban as an interpreter, French director François Truffaut as Lacombe (an offbeat bit of casting that works — why not a foreigner in charge? After all, he’s alien, too), little Cary Guffey (Dreyfuss’ real-life nephew) as Barry, and J. Patrick McNamara as the Project Leader. There are small roles for future stars Carl Weathers and Lance Henriksen. It’s more a case of show over substance, but what substance there is is choice!\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)\n\nScience fiction film noir, and one of the very best of its kind. An immediate movie classic, which, despite its Cold War origins, has not aged a single day since its premiere. An alien emissary from space comes to Earth bearing only goodwill. He also brings with him a dire warning, but his intentions are misunderstood by a paranoid society unwilling to listen or to compromise. Impatient with the usual authority figures, the gentlemanly alien Klaatu escapes his Washington, D.C., confinement to learn for himself what makes these mysterious Earth creatures tick. Michael Rennie is the cultivated (and veddy British) Klaatu. He’s joined by sympathetic office worker Patricia Neal as Helen Benson, Billy Gray (before his Father Knows Best period) as her inquisitive son Bobby, and soon-to-be popular sci-fi staple Hugh Marlowe (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) as Tom Stevens, who fingers the alien for capture by the U.S. Army (darn those pesky diamonds!). The film also features character actor Sam Jaffe (in a proto-Einstein hairdo) as the scholarly Professor Barnhardt, Frances Bavier (Aunt Bee in the Andy of Mayberry series), Olan Soulé, Carleton Young, Fay Roope, Freeman Luske, and real-life news personalities Drew Pearson and H.V. Kaltenborn. The role of the menacing robot Gort (a truly awesome creation) is played by seven-foot-four-inch Lock Martin, who was an usher at Grauman’s Chinese Theater. He had to wear two different metallic costumes, one for the front view and one for the back, due to a conspicuous, non-photogenic zipper running down the length of each costume. Former movie editor Robert Wise directed in clinical, almost documentary-style fashion, while Bernard Herrmann provided the spare, minimalist score. His use of the theremin (two were featured on the soundtrack) gained widespread exposure for this exotic-sounding instrument. Keep alert to the many Christian and allegorical references spread throughout the script, i.e., Klaatu’s “resurrection” near the end, and his earthly alias (“Mr. Carpenter,” get it?). The original short story, “Farewell to the Master,” by Harry Bates, was considerably altered for this movie adaptation. The basic plot line was semi-reworked as well for the 1999 animated feature The Iron Giant. Stay away from the Keanu Reeves remake, or face obliteration!\n\nDune (1984)\n\nThis long-awaited release of one of the seminal literary classics of science fiction gets a much-needed-yet-perplexing screen adaptation from director David Lynch. Even fans of Frank Herbert’s dense work were dismayed at the resultant mishmash of Middle Eastern philosophies, corporate greed, and sixties pro-environmental concerns. The plot revolves around the manufacture and exploitation of mélange, a kind of “spice” found only on the planet Arrakis (Iraq?), and much coveted throughout the universe for its miraculous “psychic” properties (mind expansion, outer space travel, good vibes, what-have-you). The film’s problem is the presence of too many underdeveloped characters and story lines in a two-hour-and-seventeen-minute time slot. It has little narrative clarity, with much of the dialogue spoken in endless onscreen voiceovers, a tiresome device more at home in the world of Shakespeare. Kenneth McMillan’s disgusting portrayal of the villainous Baron Harkonnen is a fierce presence throughout and spot-on casting, to boot, as is that of the young Kyle MacLachlan, in his movie debut, as the messianic Paul Atreides. The rest of the international cast, including Juergen Prochnow, Francesca Annis, Freddie Jones, Sian Phillips, Richard Jordan, and Max von Sydow, try mightily to overcome the pervasive dreariness of the surroundings, to little avail. Also left adrift are veterans Jose Ferrer and Dean Stockwell, newcomer Sean Young, Linda Hunt, and a pre-Next Generation Patrick Stewart as weapons master Gurney. As the Baron’s nefarious nephew Feyd, rock singer Sting has what amounts to a virtual walk-on (“I will kill him!”), but he’s top-billed all the same, a clear case of caveat emptor. The droning, moody background score is by American rock group Toto, with a brief assist from Brian Eno, who composed the Prophecy theme. Snore… The special effects are nothing to brag about and surprisingly sub-standard considering the funds that were poured into this mess. But at least the all-important giant worms are impressive. Indeed, the strangest effect of all comes from the weird apparition known as the Navigator, which resembles a free-floating epiglottis (I thought it looked more like a giant vagina, but that’s for my analyst to decide…). The film does retain a certain cult following. However, it’s hideous to look at and fairly incomprehensible to all but those intimately familiar with the novel. The DVD/Blu-ray editions feature an additional hour of footage used in the TV-showing of the story. It’s credited to the pseudonymous Allan Smithee. Good luck with that!\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nSensitive and scarred, the impressionable Edward (played by heartthrob Johnny Depp) is the scissor-handed Figaro for the laid-back California set (actually, Central Florida), in a beautifully crafted, sentimental, and mostly enjoyable film, despite some crude language and forced humor. It’s a modern parable of Tim Burton’s pet hang-ups of having grown up in middle-class suburbia. Depp has his best role ever as the misunderstood boy-monster, a walking textbook of physical deformities and psychological debilities, but with a cookie-cutter-shaped heart of gold. Winona Ryder is equally winning as his would-be girlfriend, the blonde cheerleader Jill. Dianne Wiest is wonderfully ditzy as the perky, never-say-die Avon lady, Alan Arkin is fine as the easygoing head of the household, and an all-but grown-up Anthony Michael Hall is cast (against type) as Ryder’s spoiled brat of a jock boyfriend. Cathy Baker (The Right Stuff) is a howl as Edward’s sex-starved next-door neighbor, who just adores Tom Jones, a recurring Burton motif (see Mars Attacks!). And horror-movie icon Vincent Price has a field day as Edward’s elderly inventor, who tries to teach him the finer points of table etiquette, while his half-formed hand twitches nervously nearby. In that, Edward’s a Quasimodo for the nineties, an atypical success story driven to fits of anger and violence by the very townspeople he earlier had befriended — fair-weather friends is more like it. It’s an allegory of our own equal fascination with, and fear of, anything different or abnormal. Danny Elfman’s lovely and evocative score, with celesta and boys choir in the foreground, is beautifully sung and played, a major factor in the movie’s long-term popularity and success. Worth comparing to Burton’s next opus, the Henry Selick-directed stop-motion feature The Nightmare Before Christmas, of which it shares a similar production design and art direction. It’s early Tim Burton at his emoting best.\n\nThe Exorcist (1973)\n\nTwo priests — one young, one old — are in the midst of performing the Roman Catholic rite of exorcism in a suburban Georgetown home. They repeat the phrase, “The power of Christ compels you!” ad nauseam, as they sprinkle holy water over the free-floating form of a twelve-year-old girl. The shocking events that follow are all part of director William Friedkin’s two-hour fright-fest The Exorcist, one of the most chilling examples of horror ever committed to film. Written by novelist William Peter Blatty, who adapted his own 1971 bestseller for the screen and worked as one of the producers, the movie begins, innocently enough, at an archeological site in Northern Iraq, where the elderly Father Lankester Merrin (a wizened Max von Sydow in makeup) suspects an old “enemy” has been let loose on the Earth in the form of an ancient relic. To his horror, Merrin realizes that sooner or later he will have to come to grips with this evil force, their final confrontation taking place in the climactic exorcism scene above. Back in Georgetown, a troubled priest named Father Damien Karras (a somber and dark visaged Jason Miller) is approached by Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a desperate actress and single mother whose daughter Regan (the fresh-faced Linda Blair) is experiencing, shall we say, dramatic physical and behavioral changes — an “extreme makeover” no child would want (and no mother could love). Chris begs the Father to perform an exorcism on the girl, but Karras has doubts about his own faith and worries if that’s the right thing to do. After seeing Regan “in the flesh,” he seeks the Church’s aid in combating the vile menace. That’s where Father Merrin comes in, the exorcist of the title. Demonic possession is the winner-take-all game here – and the devil plays for keeps. Regan’s transformation from a cute and playful youngster into a projectile vomiting, filthy-tongued monstrosity (“Your mother sucks cocks in hell”) serves as the special FX centerpiece to the drama. Filmed on location at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and at Fordham University in the Bronx, the lead actors underwent unbelievable pain and suffering to produce this masterpiece of the genre. Kudos to Mr. Friedkin (The French Connection) for getting his cast to undergo almost as much physical torture and discomfort as their fictional counterparts. The end result is gripping storytelling at its edge-of-the-seat finest. In addition to the superb technical aspects (by makeup man Dick Smith, and effects wizard Marcel Vercoutere), the sound plays an absolutely integral part in the overall production design, thanks to Gonzalo Gavira of El Topo fame. Featuring Lee J. Cobb as kindly Lieutenant Kinderman, Jack MacGowran as Burke Dennings, William O’Malley (an actual Jesuit priest, who served as technical adviser on the project) as Father Joe Dyer, and Rev. Tom Bermingham, another real-life priest, with Kitty Wynn, Titos Vandis, Peter Masterson, Barton Heyman, and Wallace Rooney. The electronically enhanced voice of the demon was mouthed by veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge. The urban legend that audience members had fainted and thrown up in theater aisles at the time of the film’s release is based on fact. We dare you to see it with the lights out! Go on!!!\n\nFantasia (1940)\n\nWalt Disney set about making this animated cartoon-cum-concert feature as a bold, innovative experiment. Audiences and critics alike were somewhat baffled by it, however, and never able to grasp the work for what it was: a highly stylized (and unique) interpretation of popular concert set pieces. Some expected a Silly Symphony-style entertainment, what with the insertion of Disney’s most famous creation, Mickey Mouse, into Paul Dukas’ “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” along with those tutu-wearing hippos and dancing ostriches from “The Dance of the Hours” sequence; they were put off by the artsy-fartsy pretensions of it all. Highbrow sensibilities aside, it was a radical new departure from the usual studio-crafted frivolity. Well-known composer, music critic, and radio raconteur Deems Taylor was selected as the narrator-host for the conception. He comes across as stiff and standoffish, but this was probably due more to his nervousness and unfamiliarity with the film medium. Leopold Stokowski conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra, and was a wise choice for the project, since he was a pioneer in the advancement of recorded sound. He helped shape the “Philadelphia Sound,” and was already an internationally recognized personality when Disney recruited him for the musical portions of the program. The majestic profile and baton-less conducting style were his trademarks, as well as the imperious presence — all in evidence in the finished work. He was also credited (erroneously it turns out, according to Neal Gabler) with giving the film its unusual title (“It’s a fan-ta-sia”). His influence can be felt in the orchestrations, especially the Bach Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and Mussorgsky’s “Night On Bald Mountain” sequence, in addition to the tinkering on Ponchielli’s “The Dance of the Hours,” the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” (completely rearranged), the Pastoral Symphony of Beethoven, and the Bach-Schubert “Ave Maria.” It all reflects Stokowski and Disney’s joint vision, and was a most fortuitous collaboration of these two titans of opposing media. That it all worked as well as it did is simply fantastic! Some of the animation sequences go beyond mere storytelling and straight into the realm of psychoanalysis (for example, the primeval battle of triceratops and tyrannosaurus in “Rite of Spring”; the dark demon Chernobog, modeled after Bela Lugosi, in the nightmarish “Night On Bald Mountain”). Only Pinocchio matches it in originality and insight. Indeed, nothing the studio did thereafter has ever approached it.\n\nFantasia 2000 (2000)\n\nThe inspiration of Walt Disney’s nephew and heir apparent, Roy E. Disney, was the guiding force behind this updated version of the animated concert film Fantasia from 1940. In place of famed conductor Leopold Stokowski, we have longtime Metropolitan Opera maestro James Levine leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He lacks Stokowski’s dramatic flair and onscreen flamboyance, but surpasses him in musical articulation. The recorded sound is spectacular and natural sounding in 6.1-channel Dolby Digital Surround. The perfunctory introductions (called “interstitials”) by hosts Levine, Steve Martin, Itzhak Perlman, Quincy Jones, Penn & Teller, James Earl Jones, Bette Midler, and Angela Lansbury, serve as natural pauses between the numbers, but distract more than they unite the disparate elements. The Mickey Mouse version of Dukas’ “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” from the original has been kept. Although it’s a classic, and beautifully hand-drawn, its inclusion is a tad unsettling due to the differences between early and modern design techniques. It stands apart from the other sequences in both looks and sound — this is not a criticism, just an informed observation. Donald Duck finally gets a segment of his own, helping the biblical Noah populate the Ark, in Sir Edward Elgar’s “Pomp and Circumstance Marches.” The other set pieces are well chosen and superbly done via computer-generated imaging and traditional line drawing. The film features the abstract expressionist Fifth Symphony of Beethoven, the surrealistic flying whales of Respighi’s “Pines of Rome,” the wonderfully interpolated Steadfast Tin Soldier story of Shostakovich’s Piano Concerto No. 2, the delightful yo-yo playing flamingos of Saint-Saens’ “Carnival of the Animals,” the ecologically-influenced Firebird Suite of Igor Stravinsky, and the Al Hirschfeld-inspired “Rhapsody in Blue” sequence, marvelously drawn and perfectly executed. Whatever one’s opinion about highbrow entertainment, it’s a welcome return to form to what the studio does best — which is, to provide extraordinarily adventurous animation to the masses. The only complaint: it’s much too short.\n\nForbidden Planet (1956)\n\nInitially a formula-B programmer, this precursor to subsequent big-screen sci-fi opuses emerged as a prestige production at MGM — and is head-and-shoulders above the usual bug-eyed monster movie from the fifties. It influenced such works as diverse as Star Trek, Star Wars, Alien, Close Encounters, The Terminator, and many, many more. Based primarily on Shakespeare’s The Tempest, it combines elements of classical mythology, Freudian psychology, and the three laws of robotics, to form its story of brainy philologist Professor Morbius, stranded on planet Altair IV. Left to his own devices, Morbius harnesses the planet’s elementary force in order to set up a private domain for himself and his comely daughter. When an investigating intergalactic space patrol invades his pet aradise and attempts to take him back to Earth against his will, Morbius unleashes the planetary force in true mad scientist-gone-amok fashion. Disney special-effects artist Joshua Meador designed many of the animated sequences, and also drew the Id Monster. Two actors, Frankie Carpenter and former Little Tough Guy Frankie Darro, played the mechanical sprite Robby the Robot, whose voice is supplied by Marvin Miller of the TV-series The Millionaire. Prosaically directed by Fred McLeod Wilcox, it stars Walter Pidgeon as Morbius, Anne Francis as his daughter Altaira, Leslie Nielsen (in his serious-acting phase) as the dry Commander Adams, Warren Stevens as Doc, Jack Kelly as Lt. Farnum, Richard Anderson as Chief Quinn, Earl Holliman as the Cook, and James Drury as Strong. Forbidden Planet is frequently cited as one of the best examples of intelligent science fiction writing ever committed to film. It’s a little static in spots and some of the dialogue is a bit childish. Still, it’s a milestone in its use of a futuristic, non-orchestral score (called “electronic tonalities” in the opening credits) by novices Louis and Bebe Barron. Filmed in the ultra-CinemaScope widescreen process, the beautiful matte paintings, sets and cyclorama are a must in glorious Technicolor.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)\n\nExtremely faithful (too faithful, perhaps) rendering of J.K Rowling’s wonderful children’s novel about the young wizard, Harry Potter, and the discovery of his new-found magical abilities. When he learns of his powers, he’s sent off to hone them at Hogwart’s School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Many memorable moments, including the congregation of owls scene at the Dursley’s, Hagrid’s door-busting entrance, the fog-enshrouded ride to Hogwart’s, the fabulous Quidditch match, the troll attack in the girl’s lavatory, and the encounter with the Dark Lord in the Forbidden Forest. For the adults, there’s outstanding acting by a veritable Who’s Who of Her Majesty’s supporting players, including Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, the snooty Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. There’s even a cameo by that old scene-stealer, John Hurt, as Mr. Olivander, purveyor of fine wands since 362 B.C. For the kiddies, there are star-making turns by the young Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as his redheaded buddy Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as the bookish Hermione Granger. A flavorful score by the veteran John Williams, destined to become a classic, is pure icing on this frothy concoction, directed in grand style by Chris Columbus. The same sensibility that gave us such literary classics as David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, and, in particular, Thomas Hughes’ Tom Brown’s School Days (doesn’t Draco Malfoy remind you of the recalcitrant Flashman?) is at work here, and only deepens one’s admiration of, and appreciation for, Rowling’s genius for invention. Some scenes are a bit too intense for younger viewers, especially the entrance of the evil wizard Voldemort. Otherwise, this is fine family entertainment and very highly recommended.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\n\nIn content and in style, it’s a rehash of J.K. Rowling’s first novel. In this second film adaptation of young Mr. Potter’s adventures at Hogwart’s School of Magic and Witchcraft, the Dickensian flavor and boarding school ethic are kept intact, as well as the dark tone of the original. Although far less suspenseful, it’s worth watching for the wonderful repartee of seasoned pros Kenneth Branagh as the foppish Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs as the malevolently unctuous Lucius Malfoy. Isaacs is hardly in this one at all, but steals every second of screen time he’s in: he brilliantly underplays his part to superb effect, a terrific casting coup. Daniel Radcliffe, as the titular hero, has noticeably matured since his last outing, as has the aptly named Rupert Grint as best pal Ron; however, both have grown comfortably into their respective roles. Emma Watson as Hermione has far less to do this time around, but makes due of the reduced screen time quite nicely, thank you. Also providing delicious takes are the returning Richard Harris (in his last screen appearance) as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as the sad-eyed Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as the suspicious Professor Snape. The actor who plays the villainous Tom Riddle (and shall go nameless) is ineffectual, but blame the novel for that. His role is grievously underwritten. Some of the special effects are good, if far from original, especially Dobby the house-elf, the enchanted flying car, and the nighttime spider attack (not at all as scary as it ought ot be). Errol, the Weasley’s scatterbrained owl, is definitely a hoot, though. In all, a good sophomore effort by director Chris Columbus, but the novelty is wearing off, and it goes on for much too long.\n\nInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)\n\nFans of Anne Rice’s Gothic romance were both pleased and perturbed with this cinematic version of her book, which stars four of Hollywood’s young hunks in differing roles: Brad Pitt as the melancholy Louis, Tom Cruise as his companion and nemesis Lestat, Christian Slater (in the part originally slated for River Phoenix before his untimely passing) as the Interviewer, and Antonio Banderas as the mysterious Armand, the Father of All Vampires. Twelve-year-old Kirsten Dunst all-but steals the show with her petulant portrayal of child-vampire Claudia. Her brazenly cold-blooded waif sends shivers down the spine. Stephen Rea is good as a theatrical fop, and the costumes and sets, especially the Grand Guignol Théâtre des Vampires and underground Parisian catacombs, are atmospheric and incandescent. The film is one long and supremely sad symphony of death, however, devoting a major portion of running time to what it’s like to live as one of the undead. For instance, the realist Lestat veers markedly from the comic to the sadistic in the blink of an eye. His counterpart, Louis, expresses remorse with self-loathing at what he has become, while the doll-like Claudia’s insatiable thirst for blood makes her the vilest and cruelest of the lot. One of the film’s themes is that of vampires playing house, a dysfunctional family threesome vying for a “normal” home life as they suck the life out of others. Despite many blood-soaked and stomach-churning scenes, including graphic neck bites and grisly rat-squeezing cocktails (slurp, slurp), Interview with the Vampire has an anemic story line that nearly drains the movie of life. The excellent score is by Elliot Goldenthal, a major contribution. The opening movement of mournful voices, with the viola da gamba on the soundtrack and a boy soprano intoning the Libera me (“Deliver me”) sets the mood of despondency and despair, harkening back to Bach and the Baroque era. It returns late in the picture after the horrifying demise of Claudia and her newly transformed “mother.” The cinematography is overwhelmingly dark and follows the prevailing brownish color pattern, a visual metaphor for decay. Stylishly directed by Neil Jordan (The Crying Game), who brings a postmodern AIDS sensibility to the proceedings — an idea not at all present in Rice’s original work but fascinating all the same — the film became a box-office hit, despite the bleak story line and downbeat script.\n\nIt’s A Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nThere was a time when producer-director Frank Capra’s bleak look into a dystopian middle-America was shunned by critics and audiences. After years of neglect, however, it eventually built up a solid following via frequent public television screenings. James Stewart is wonderful as Everyman George Bailey, stuck in a rut in small-town suburbia but forever longing to break out of its restrictive confines, only to discover that life is “wonderful” just as it is. Donna Reed adds a homey touch as his patient wife Mary, a warm-up for her later TV-outing in The Donna Reed Show. Every employee’s worst nightmare, curmudgeonly town banker Lionel Barrymore, is the perpetually scowling Scrooge-like Mr. Potter, who makes George’s life a living hell — or is it the other way around? Many memorable moments throughout, with fine performances from the large and colorful cast, including Henry Travers as befuddled angel second-class Clarence, H.B. Warner as the alcoholic druggist Mr. Gower, Beulah Bondi as George’s mom, Thomas Mitchell as absentminded Uncle Billy (“I’m all right, I’m aaaaaaaaalll right”), Gloria Grahame as the tarty Violet, Ward Bond as Bert, Frank Faylen as Ernie (!), and Samuel S. Hinds, Frank Albertson, Mary Treen, Lillian Randolph, Sheldon Leonard, Todd Karns, and others in supporting roles. Every part is perfectly cast, and there are numerous personal touches where one senses Capra slyly winking at his audience. Two tiny examples: the permanent look of disdain displayed by the manservant who pushes Potter’s wheelchair around; and the overly flirtatious exchanges between Violet and George. Endearing and heartwarming from beginning to end, it’s really a dark, noir-tinged nightmare of amazing acuity. George’s justly famous dream sequence near the end, where he imagines what life in his hometown would be like without him, has a staggering power to move, even after so many repeat viewings. The character’s slow descent into a bottomless pit, and his pained expression of dread at the horrible realization of what has transpired, are absolutely unforgettable. The film proved to be a test-run for Stewart’s strenuous work in such pictures as Winchester ’73, Bend of the River, Vertigo, and others. The spare score is by Dimitri Tiomkin. For once, the director has invested his film with more spice than nice, despite the cornball contrivances (for example, the opening scene in Heaven, and the all-too cheery finale). Essential viewing nonetheless.\n\nKing Kong (1933)\n\nKnown as the picture that saved a studio – RKO Radio Pictures Studio, to be exact – this granddaddy of all those big, bad stomping, monster-on-the-loose chomping fantasy epics is every bit the classic it’s cranked up to be. One of the greatest special effects extravaganzas of all time, King Kong did for New York what Godzilla would later do for Tokyo: that is, it immortalized a city, as well as almost single handedly destroyed it – in cinematic terms, of course. It also lifted Depression Era audiences to ecstatic heights. This box-office champion was the brainchild of two men, veteran movie-maker Merian C. Cooper and his partner Ernest B. Schoedsack, both of who directed and produced the feature, based on an original story by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. For the stop-motion wizardry, Cooper turned to FX man Willis O’Brien (The Lost World), who in turn looked to model maker Marcel Delgado for the gorilla and dinosaur miniatures that figured so prominently throughout. Restless movie mogul Carl Denham (an overly enthusiastic Robert Armstrong) searches for the perfect angle for his next project. Upon meeting impoverished Ann Darrow (lovely Fay Wray, who bleached her dark hair blonde for the shoot), he impulsively decides to star her in his upcoming adventure flick. In the blink of an eye, we’re whisked away on a long sea voyage to… who knows where. Once our adventurers arrive on Skull Island, all hell breaks loose – quite literally, in fact – along with an enormous ape named Kong, dubbed by Denham “The Eighth Wonder of the World.” After knocking the giant gorilla out with gas bombs, the publicity-minded producer manages to ship Kong back to Broadway, where the monkey makes an unscheduled debut on the city’s streets and atop its tallest building. The sturdy cast is headed by Armstrong, who makes mincemeat out of his manic character. Wray is the all-time champion screamer, but don’t let that fool you — she is full of pluck and spunk to spare. Lantern-jawed Bruce Cabot is first mate Jack Driscoll, who falls in love with Ann after rescuing her from Kong’s monstrous clutches. Frank Reicher is the stern Captain Engelhorn, Sam Hardy the theatrical agent Weston, and James Flavin the second mate, with Victor Wong as Charley the Cook, Noble Johnson as the Native Chief, and Steve Clemento as the Witch Doctor. Look for cameos of Cooper and Schoedsack, who piloted the airplane that eventually brings the big guy down. Cooper was a World War I aviator who put his knowledge of flight to good use. He was also a pioneer in the three-strip Technicolor process. It would be a shame not to mention the powerful and highly influential movie score by Max Steiner, one Hollywood’s Golden Age best. No home should be without at least a DVD/Blu-ray disc copy of this superb film.\n\nLilo & Stitch (2002)\n\nTalk about a boy and his dog, this one’s a lame reworking of that familiar theme. In fact, it should have been re-titled Disney Goes to Hawaii via Social Services. In this case, the girl Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase), a lonely orphaned youngster with a sadistic streak — living in Hawaii and none-too-well cared for by older sister, Nani (Tia Carrere) — is in danger of being taken to a foster home by a humorless social worker. That night, Lilo “wishes upon a star” (sound familiar?) to bring her a plaything she can relate to. Suddenly, from deep space, comes what looks like a cross between a rag-eared koala with fangs and an irascible iguana. This creature, whom she calls Stitch, is one of the most unlikable and least cuddly critters the Disney artists have ever penciled. It’s totally lacking in charm, fuzziness or warmth. Programmed for destructive behavior (now there’s a modern twist for you), it’s not even kid-friendly, which, in view of the film’s target audience, sort of defeats the purpose, don’t you think? The humans show significantly more emotion than the norm for a Disney feature, as the plot drags on to its prefabricated conclusion, a pretty by-the-numbers chase sequence with the usual sappy resolution. Despite being beautifully hand-drawn, and with little computer-aided animation, the story never takes off either as family entertainment or as sci-fi fantasy. It’s far too serious for little tykes, with not enough fresh ideas to maintain our interest. The early scenes on a faraway planet with otherworldly aliens, including one that resembles an over-sized Charlie the Tuna, are colorful, and most of the voiceover work is eminently respectable. However, the usually dependable David Ogden Stiers is seriously hampered by an impenetrable Russian accent as Jumba, the alien-scientist who created Stitch. Ving Rhames is coolness personified as former CIA agent-turned-social worker Cobra Bubbles (don’t ask). Stitch is voiced by Christopher Sanders, Kevin McDonald is the one-eyed Earth expert Pleakley (shades of Mike Wazowski from Monsters, Inc.), Jason Scott Lee is Nani’s boyfriend David, and the ageless Zoe Caldwell does a guest shot as the Grand Councilwoman (or -thing). Very disappointing summer movie fare. Read a good book instead.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nBased on J.R.R. Tolkien’s hugely popular trilogy about hobbits, orcs, wizards, elves, dwarves, and trolls, this first of three simultaneously filmed productions was lavishly lensed in New Zealand by fledgling kiwi director Peter Jackson. It took guts, money, and vision (not to mention nerve) to bring Tolkien’s rambling saga to the screen — and Jackson and his fellow co-writers, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, can be credited for having taken a brave first step with this outstanding entry. The plot revolves around the return of an all-powerful ring to Mount Doom where it was forged. Taking up this quest are a disparate group of nine intrepid travelers. The journey has been fleshed out in parts, and certain characters have been given greater prominence (Liv Tyler’s expanded part, for instance), or eliminated altogether (the much-lamented Tom Bombadil). Nevertheless, the plot is propelled forward by a multi-talented cast, including the statuesque Ian McKellan as Gandalf, owl-eyed Elijah Wood as Frodo (bearer of the One Ring), Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins, and Cate Blanchett, rugged Viggo Mortenson, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, John Rhys-Davies, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith of The Matrix series), the aforementioned Tyler, and the ever-effective Christopher Lee as the evil wizard Saruman. This was Lee’s second feature in a row, followed by his Count Dooku in Star Wars – Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Not bad for an octogenarian. There’s a literal cast of thousands, all good, in this grand screen entertainment. The excellent score, highly influenced by Richard Wagner’s mighty epic, The Ring of the Nibelung (a close cousin, story-wise), is by Canadian composer Howard Shore, with a little help from Enya at the end. Beautiful cinematography, stunning effects, and superb miniature work (all with the aid of the technical wizards at Weta Workshop), and a lovely evocation of Hobbiton by the set and costume designers, contribute to an exciting three hours plus (in the extended version, available on DVD and Blu-ray – highly recommended). It’s more robust and entertaining than Tolkien’s episodic novels were ever meant to be, but it’s still a bloody-good show. Three cheers for all (I’ll have a pint to go, please).\n\nMonsters, Inc. (2001)\n\nMonsters pop out of children’s closets, scaring them half to death in order to harness their screams into energy, thus powering the monsters’ modernistic city (how’s that for environmentally conscious?). Sounds like a great plot for a kid’s movie, right? And what a movie it is! The cartoon-friendly folks at Pixar Studios have developed this extraordinary idea into a delightful CGI feature about two friends at a giant corporation called Monsters, Inc., the big blue (IBM-pun intended) furry monster, James P. “Sully” Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), and his ambitious one-eyed partner, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). The trouble begins when Sully inadvertently opens the wrong closet, and lets a little girl he calls Boo into the plant, who immediately makes her child-like presence felt. He and Mike spend the rest of the film trying to return Boo to her bedroom before the Monster Goon Squad hauls them away to be stripped and scrubbed. Exposure to little kids, you see, can be quite hazardous to the monsters’ health. Outrageous plot devices and snappy one-liners make this a fast-moving, heart-tugging tale for toughs and tykes of all ages. It drags slightly toward the end, but the endearing vocal and computer-animated performances of Goodman and Crystal, as well as Steve Buscemi as a (literally) slimy villain, and James Coburn as the head of the corporation, elevate it above the usual trite kiddie fare. The role of Roz is a riot, as are the “outtakes” at the end – a welcome Pixar add-on. While not as entertaining or as fresh as the Toy Story movies, it’s still a job well done by the Pixar crew. The big city-corporation idea bears comparison to Osmosis Jones.\n\nThe Mummy (1999)\n\nHaving nothing in particular to do with the classic Boris Karloff version from the 1930s, The Mummy is far superior technically to most films of the genre, but devoid of the requisite chills the story demands. It’s strictly tongue-in-cheek, played mostly for laughs. Many of the gags are more in the spirit of silly slapstick, or a Saturday-matinee kiddie caper, than a grisly horror tale — but that’s okay with us! The film stars Rachel Weisz as a bumbling British archeologist in search of the City of the Dead, John Hannah as her ne’er-do-well brother, and Brendan Fraser as a down-on-his-luck soldier of fortune. Kevin J. O’Connor plays the hapless servant Beni, Israeli actor Oded Fehr displays his matinee-idol looks as a defender of the dead, and Arnold Vosloo is the proto-wrestling incarnation of Imhotep. Also appearing is veteran character actor Bernard Fox as forlorn English pilot Winston (!), and Jonathan Hyde as a condescending Egyptologist. As an adventure yarn, it’s better than the misguided The Phantom of a few years back, or the underrated The Shadow, but not by much. Along with the latter, it shares an exotic score by Jerry Goldsmith, the resident dean of movie composers. Good computer graphics and miraculous transformations, however, do not a horror-movie make. There’s a feeling this whole show plays better at home, where the warm sunset colors and sweeping romantic vistas can be savored at one’s leisure. Still, there’s something likable, in a goofy sort of way, about the finished product, due primarily to the fine flair for fun shown by the energetic cast. The premise is suspect even in our cynical TV age, but don’t take it too seriously.\n\nOsmosis Jones (2001)\n\nA big vulgar, grown-up teenager movie, directed by the Farrelly brothers in the tradition of such barf classics as Caddyshack and National Lampoon’s Animal House, but with a twist: part of the action takes place inside Bill Murray’s body. It’s this aspect, and the cartoon city within it, that’s most fascinating and winning. This marvelous animated metropolis is one long, continuous freeway, replete with its own arrival and departure port, speakeasy, mayor, press secretary, and single-cell police force. The animation is indeed original, colorful and imaginative. What’s missing is a truly engaging story to tie the ‘toons to their real-life counterparts: one longs for Jones and his cohorts to break out of Murray’s body and take the focus away from the obviously uncomfortable human actors. The voiceover work is commendable throughout, and features motor-mouth Chris Rock as Osmosis Jones, David Hyde Pierce as a cold tablet, William Shatner (lampooning his Captain Kirk persona) as the Mayor, Ron Howard as the opposition candidate, and a solemnly sinister Laurence Fishburne as the evil virus Thrax. Murray plays a more disgusting version of himself (now there’s an original thought), a slovenly Crocodile Hunter-type, who dearly loves his young daughter but fails to take proper care of his body’s hygienic needs. Chris Elliott plays his equally unkempt partner. It’s wicked in parts, more than a little gross at times, and blatantly predictable, too. Some truly hilarious scenes are interspersed with more mundane moments. While the film is not entirely a success, it can be recommended for older kids. Lots of crude noises and flatulence jokes galore for the easily offended (yours truly not among them).\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\n\nBreaking the sound barrier, the dawn of the space race, and the Mercury Project, all rolled up into a solid, three-hour-plus Wild West road-show on rockets. The book by Tom Wolfe, on which the movie is based, is a detailed look into the early U.S. space program, starting with the story of maverick test pilot Chuck Yeager and the unsung heroes of jet flight, followed by the Mercury astronauts, their selection and training, and finally their individual voyages. The film pretty much follows the book’s outline. There are amazing recreations of the X-1’s solo flights seamlessly merged with actual newsreel footage of the historic launches. The inspiring music is by Bill Conti, with parts of Gustav Holst’s The Planets tossed in for good measure, and the outstanding photography is by Caleb Deschanel. Directed by Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Unbearable Lightness of Being) with real cowboy swagger and grit. The laconic delivery and matter-of-fact speech patterns of the protagonists are uncannily captured. Some critics see this as a Saturday Night Live sketch of the space race, with several important characters treated as buffoons. From all accounts, it really was like that. Wonderful sixties ambiance, uniquely and vividly portrayed. Note the flicking camera shutters every time the reporters appear. Should make a valuable companion piece to Ron Howard’s Apollo 13, which covers similar ground but in less satiric fashion. There’s a real reverence for space travel and the brave men, women and vision it took to conquer it. Themes we take for granted — loyalty, teamwork, the love and support of family, and doing what’s right in spite of insurmountable odds — are all present here in unforgettable vignettes. The entire film is movingly acted by a large ensemble cast that boasts Sam Shepard, Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Barbara Hershey, Pamela Reed, Veronica Cartwright, Donald Moffat as Lyndon Johnson, Lance Henricksen, Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer in major and minor roles, along with the real-life Chuck Yeager as a barkeep. The narrator is the late Levon Helm, who plays Ridley and was The Band’s drummer for many years.\n\nSe7en (1995)\n\nPerpetually gray rainfall, dark and dingy urban blight, neo-noir trappings, deranged human behavior, and insane delusional serial killings. These are just a few of the plot points covered in director David Fincher’s disturbing ode to Thomas Harris territory. In fact, it’s a shade less gruesome (by a nose, so to speak) than many an episode of The X-Files, but infinitely better written. A series of big city murders are being committed in which the killer follows the pattern of the seven deadly sins. He makes himself out to be the sole avenging angel of the gluttonous, the greedy, the lustful, the prideful, the slothful, the envious, and the wrathful. One thankfully never gets a real good look at the murders, but the way they’re handled and discussed — amid the overpoweringly murky images, the grainy camerawork, the disgusting trash-ridden sets and decor, and the prevailing feeling of oppression and hopelessness – are all given exemplary treatment by Fincher, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, and cinematographer Darius Khondji; the viewer has the eerie sensation that all is not well within this city. The surprise denouement is disturbing, but telegraphed slightly. Excellent work by Morgan Freeman, as veteran detective William Somerset (what, no Maugham?) on his last week before retirement, and cocky Brad Pitt as David Mills, the eager, hot-tempered rookie assigned to him. Pitt downplays his teen-idol tendencies to give us a real person behind the brashness, and Freeman’s total command of his poetry-spouting character provides keen insight into this tired, trapped old man. Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pitt’s sweetly vulnerable wife, and R. Lee Ermey is Freeman’s boss. The mysterious killer (unbilled Kevin Spacey) only materializes at the end, but keep your eyes open, especially during the credits, as he appears throughout the drama in the least likely of places. Quite a mind bender, the film merits repeated viewings to decipher all of its carefully constructed clues. A winner, though not for the faint of heart.\n\nSigns (2001)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s The Birds gets a modern makeover in this deliberately paced but more-than-effective suspense thriller from the director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. One of its many virtues is the lack of elaborate special FX to distract viewers from the main story line. The plot involves mysterious crop circles found in Mel Gibson’s cornfield, but that’s only a cover: are enemy aliens really about to invade the Earth, or is it a form of mass hysteria? Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to handle numerous tidbits of minutiae, piling on hint after hint in subtle and ingenious ways, until the viewer becomes unaware of the full extent of his manipulation. He also has a cameo in a key role as a neighbor harboring an uninvited house guest. Gibson plays a grieving, disillusioned ex-minister who needs a healthy dollop of faith to snap him back to reality after his wife is killed in a horrific traffic accident. He must learn to cope with the loss without his customary assurance and bravado. Gibson is filled with a coiled tension that manifests itself at key points in the drama, particularly during his son’s asthmatic attacks and in his family’s flight to the cellar. Joaquin Phoenix is particularly adept as his sad-sack brother Merrill, a former baseball pro who still knows how to swing a bat. The kids are wonderfully played by Rory Culkin (Macaulay’s little brother) and the adorable Abigail Breslin; the eerily subliminal film-score is by James Newton Howard, done as homage to the late master, Bernard Herrmann: there are noticeable traces of Psycho and Vertigo abounding in it. There are also numerous references to The Birds and other Hitchcock thrillers. A must-see for fans of the genre, despite a few protracted scenes. Stay with this one all the way, though, as you’ll be amply rewarded for the effort. It should play better on DVD and Blu-ray. Take the PG-13 rating seriously.\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nA film that seeps into one’s subconscious at odd hours and times. Essentially, it’s a modern ghost story told in existential terms. Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (a laid-back Bruce Willis) tries desperately to help antisocial patient Cole Sear, a young boy with a most unusual problem: he sees dead people (no kidding!). Both learn their proper place in the world through a series of passive-emotional shrink sessions interspersed with ghostly visions. The film establishes its own ground rules, and wisely keeps to them. One of the few modern productions that’s as much a joy to see as it is to listen to, with many intelligent plot points to ponder. It’s cleverly written (one could say too clever by half) and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The sound design plays an integral part in the drama, as does the rich color scheme and gorgeous cinematography of Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs). James Newton Howard wrote the creepy musical score. Willis is superb as the child psychologist, and the talented Haley Joel Osment plays the boy, Cole. As actors, they have an amiable working relationship that gives their characters needed believability. The surprise ending will both shock and perplex, thus forcing you to go over the entire film from the beginning. Toni Collette plays Cole’s mom. Donnie Wahlberg (ex-New Kid on the Block) lost 40 pounds to play Willis’ crazed former patient, Vincent Grey. Glenn Fitzgerald is Cole’s teacher Stuttering Stanley, and Shyamalan appears unbilled role as a doctor (in honor of his parents, who are both physicians). An excellent effort by all concerned, and a big winner at the gate. See it, if you can, but not with small children: there are a few intense scenes scattered throughout.\n\nSpider-Man (2001)\n\nCult director Sam Raimi first tried his hand at a comic book superhero in 1990’s stylish Darkman. But the lead character’s tortured soul proved a bit too dark for movie audiences and Raimi’s own further examination. Stepping up to Marvel Comic’s classic action hero Spider-Man, he now gives us the back-story of the troubled teen web-swinger, first drawn in the mid-sixties by artist Stan Lee. Toby Maguire is just right as the geeky, would-be news photographer Peter Parker, who, when bitten by a genetically mutated spider, is transformed into the title character. He’s smitten with the lovely Mary Jane Watson, sensitively played by ravishingly red-haired Kirsten Dunst. Willem Dafoe is the nasty millionaire villain with a conscience, the Green Goblin; Rosemary Harris is Peter’s doting Aunt May, James Franco is his best friend Harry, and Cliff Robertson lends fine support as Spidey’s gentle Uncle Ben, whose tragic death is the main cata"
