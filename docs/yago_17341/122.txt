The “Lulu” (GB: ”No orchids for Lulu”) directed by Rolf Thiele was the second of the 4 movies adapted by the influential Paul Wedekind’s play, placing itself between the monumental “Die Büchse der Pandora” (”Pandora’s Box”; G.W.Pabst, 1929) and two 1980′s movies: “Lulu” by Walerian Borowicz and “Loulou” by Maurice Pialat; (as regard an Italian “Lulu” filmed in 1953 by director Fernando Cerchio and starring Valentina Cortese and Marcello Mastroianni, the references to Wedekind’s original were here so minimal and vague to appear almost absent).

This Austrian (rare to view) version, in which the dramatic/sexual role of Louise Brooks is played by the Austrian Nadja Tiller is very close to Pabst’s silent adaptation (with a more explicit accent on some erotic transgressive scenes) and, despite the disagreement of many critics (Sadoul among them) is absolutely worth to see (imo) as it stands as one of the best movie made in Austria in the 1960s.
