Lulu Wang was a Chinese-American filmmaker whose widely anticipated second feature film, "The Farewell," was released in July of 2019. Wang was born in Beijing, China and lived there with her family when she was a young girl. At the age of 6, Wang moved with her parents to Miami, Florida. She would remain in the Sunshine State throughout her formative years. Encouraged by her parents, Wang began taking piano lessons at the age of 4 and quickly showed promise. She attended the prestigious New World School of the Arts in Miami for piano performance and showed immediate promise as a classical pianist. When it came time to enter college Wang was accepted into Boston College. She doubled majored in literature and music at the school, and went on to graduate in 2005. Although music had been one of her main focuses throughout her life, Wang longed to be making films. So after graduation she packed her bags and headed west to Hollywood. While living and working as a film producer's intern in L.A., Wang met fellow filmmaking aspirant Bernadette Burgi. The two hit it off and before long decided to start their own production company - Flying Box Productions. With Burgi serving as producer, Wang released her directorial debut with 2014's "Posthumous." That film, which starred Brit Marling and Jack Huston, was written and directed by Wang. Wang's follow-up film, "The Farewell," premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The film starred Awkwafina as a young Chinese-American woman who travels to China to visit her dying grandmother. "The Farwell" was released theatrically in the U.S. in July of 2019.
