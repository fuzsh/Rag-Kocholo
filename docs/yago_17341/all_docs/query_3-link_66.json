        "text": "About me\n\nWith the unique ability to captivate audiences through her sincere storytelling, Chinese-American director Lulu Wang continues to establish herself as a writer and filmmaker to watch.\n\nWang wrote and directed her second feature film THE FAREWELL, which A24 will release in July 2019. The story follows Billi (Awkwafina), a young woman who returns to China after decades in America to join her relatives as they gather to say goodbye to the family’s elderly matriarch. However, the family decides not to tell their grandmother of her own diagnosis so they convene under the pretense of throwing a shotgun wedding for a cousin who has been living in Japan for so long that he hardly remembers his Mandarin. While Billi’s story is unique to her Asian-American experience, it is entirely relatable in its heartwarming depiction of love within a family. The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Dramatic Competition. Variety also named Wang among its “Top Ten Directors To Watch in 2019.”\n\nHer first film POSTHUMOUS, an indie romantic comedy starring Brit Marling and Jack Huston, was released by The Orchard in 2014. Wang was awarded with the Chaz and Roger Ebert Directing Fellowship at the 2014 Film Independent Spirit Awards for the film. She also earned a 2014 Film Independent Project Involve Directing fellowship.\n\nWang’s 2015 short film TOUCH premiered at the Palm Springs International ShortsFest. It was also an NBCU Short Film Festival finalist, and was selected by American Cinematheque for its Annual Focus on Female Directors. Additionally, TOUCH took home Best Drama at the Asians on Film Festival.\n\nLulu is currently developing her next feature that will reteam her with her producers at Big Beach and explore the bonds of family in a grounded sci-fi drama.\n\nBorn in Beijing, raised in Miami and educated in Boston, Wang originally trained as a classical pianist. However, her love for writing eventually paved the way to her success as a storyteller, with her diverse background reflected and emphasized in the global sensibility of her films."
