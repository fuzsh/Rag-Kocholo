        "text": "Despite the relative success of Lulu Wang’s “The Farewell” — including a swift pick-up by A24 at Sundance and setting the record for per theater average over “Avengers: Endgame” — the writer/director says the current cinematic landscape leaves little room for new IP, putting mid-budget movies in a tough spot.\n\n“I think that it’s a tough time to take risks,” Wang tells Variety, adding that she thinks “The Farewell” was made primarily because it was low-budget, despite some risks (it’s done almost entirely in Mandarin).\n\nThat doesn’t mean Wang herself will shy away from the chance to do big-budget superhero movies in the future. It just has to have the right message — and the right protagonist.\n\n“Yes, I’m putting it out into the universe. Bring me all the superheroes. Definitely female. I definitely want to do a female superhero,” says Wang.\n\nWhat you won’t find her doing, though, is watching movies with partner Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning director of “Moonlight.” As half of the indie filmmaking power couple, Wang admits that one of their favorite things to do together involves plopping down in front of the small screen and watching HGTV.\n\n“That’s our ideal Sunday: Wake up, have coffee, and put on ‘Love It or List It,'” says Wang.\n\nGuessing whether someone will “love” or “list” is serious business. “We always pause, and we take bets,” she adds. “We’re like, ‘What do you think? What do you say? Love it or list it?’ And we have a whole conversation before we hit play.”"
