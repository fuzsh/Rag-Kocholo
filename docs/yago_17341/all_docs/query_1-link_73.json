        "text": "Database page: Buffalo Bill, l'eroe del far west - The Spaghetti Western Database\n\nHas anyone seen this, or have it in their collections? I am interested in seeing this movie. I’m not sure about the year of production though. I’ve seen it listed as a 1962 production as well as being RELEASED in 1965. I am under the impression this was the first Italian western since the German western films showed the Italians how profitable the genre could be before they began doing their own. If this isn’t the first, I need to change something in part one of my SW article. Any info would be greatly appreciated.\n\nApologies if there’s an existing thread. I couldn’t find one using the search feature.\n\nIf you liked HELLBENDERS, you should like this one. It has all the action the other picture didn’t have. It was shot before the later version, and also stars Joseph Cotten. Awesome cast that included James Mitchum, Franco Nero…\n\nHELLBENDERS is one of my faves, but TRAMPLERS is an exciting action film.\n\nAnd for what it’s worth (i.e. nothing) Weisser lists it as 1964.\n\nIn reality I suspect it is nigh on impossible to be sure one way or the other. Par for the course with this genre. But I have come to trust Giusti for the most part.\n\nYou’re right (I only noticed the year directly following the title in bold), but it’s also stated that they were ready to film in march '63, but the works were postponed due to incompetence of a Spanish producer\n\nIt’s getting complicated, I’ll do some more research tomorrow\n\nMaybe it’s safe that the film was not made nor released in '62 or '63\n\nFor the moment '64 as year of production seems the best candidate, '65 the best candidate for year of release\n\nBut where did Bruckner get his dates ('63 production, '64 release) from ?\n\nBy the way, Silver Wolf is right, westerns, or western-like movies, have been made in Italy since silent movie era, as the first ‘fullblood’ western however, a film from 1941 is often cited, NOZZE DI SANGUE by Goffredo Allessandrini\n\nI’ll do some research in this area too"
