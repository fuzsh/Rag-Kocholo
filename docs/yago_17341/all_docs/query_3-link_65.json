        "text": "Sam Fragoso: What did making The Farewell mean to you?\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nLulu Wang: It’s quite disorienting to be told for most of your life that all of your instincts are wrong. Maybe that’s too harsh of a way to put it. There’s a real humility in Chinese culture… (laughs).\n\nSF: I fear if we don’t laugh, we’re just going to start crying again.\n\nLW: Correct.\n\nSF: (laughs) That’s a lot.\n\nLW: So much has changed. When I was making The Farewell, it was 2016— seven years ago. It wasn’t that long ago, and yet our culture has changed so much that when you talk about identity or talk about a hyphenate story that’s an American story, people nowadays are like, “Of course not all American stories are white.” That’s an of course now. When I was pitching The Farewell, it was not that.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nSF: How did you reckon with that while making the film?\n\nLW: So many people told me it wasn’t going to work. I had so much fear while making it, and I appreciate the level of support I got. But I’ve always had to navigate not only my fear, but everyone else’s fear around me. My parents being in American society, my friends coming to my parents’ house for the first time and not knowing how to act. I’ve had to carry this trepidation for other people. While making the movie, I had to constantly fight for something that I instinctively knew was right but there was no evidence of.\n\nSF: Like what?\n\nLW: Like the fact that, even though the film was going to be 75% in Mandarin, people would still be able to relate. That they could read subtitles. The only way to do that was to let go of the fear and have a sort of blind faith that it was going to work out. When the film came out and so many of my instincts were proven right, it was just disorienting. Like, “Oh wait, how do I shift how I’m listening? How do I shift my openness? Maybe I need to put some limits and protections around myself, so that I can practice listening to myself and listen less to others.”\n\nI’m always trying to navigate this balance of collaboration, which is so incredibly important to me, and listening to my own voice. Sometimes when I listen to a lot of people, that might look like, oh, she doesn’t know what she wants. But it’s actually — because I know what I want — I want to stress test it. I’m honing the yes and no’s to be quicker."
