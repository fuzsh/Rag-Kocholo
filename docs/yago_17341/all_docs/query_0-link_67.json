It was a deliberate choice on the part of producers and film-makers, in order to make their movies palatable for an audience whom they had to re-conquer since the growing diffusion of television in the country—the first broadcasts took place in 1954—had provoked a hemorrhage of box office takings. It was also a way to characterize their products for foreign market sales. One such example was Mario Bava’s Black Sunday (La maschera del demonio, 1960), which opened with an outstandingly violent scene where a witch played by Barbara Steele is tortured and put to the stake by her captors—a scene that includes the shot of a torture device—the “Mask of Satan”—being nailed to Steele’s face by means of a huge hammer. The path of violence (that mixed with an emphasis on eroticism in Gothic movies and mirrored another major tendency in Italian cinema, which grew parallel to the partial loosening of censorship) was further explored by what proved to be the most popular film genre in the decade, the so-called Spaghetti Western. Since the release of Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (Per un pugno di dollari, 1964) and Sergio Corbucci’s Django (1966)—the second becoming a reference point for violence on screen in the genre due to its insistence on a macabre mood and scenes such as the one in which Django (Franco Nero) has his hands crushed by the villains so that he can’t handle a gun any longer— outrageousness became a selling point. It couldn’t last too long. To quote Karl Marx, “History repeats itself, first in tragedy, then in farce.” And the Spaghetti Western, which already contained the seeds of irony in itself since Leone’s “Man with No Name” walked onto the screen, couldn’t help but end in laughter, as shown by the enormous success of They Call Me Trinity (Lo chiamavano Trinità..., 1970). After the decline of the Spaghetti Western, its place as Italy’s most popular and controversial genre was taken by the crime film, which monopolized much of the frustrations and rage that were dominant among moviegoers at the time. The Seventies were a tough period in Italian history. Events of 1968 paved the way for extreme political tensions, which resulted in bomb blasts, kidnappings, terrorist attacks and even an aborted attempt at a coup d’état in December 1970. Crime films put all this on screen, within the exciting and rough boundaries of genre cinema. Some of them echoed the paranoid atmosphere of a country plagued with terrorism and corrupt secret services; others portrayed infamous real events with just minimal changes. These featured tough, hard-boiled, gun-crazy cops, ruthless and sadistic criminals, brutal violence, heists, shoot-outs and spectacular car chases in city streets. Critics hated them, yet audiences queued to watch them. Italian critics started to call this sub-genre poliziottesco (plural: poliziotteschi, to be pronounced as polittsiot-teski), a diminutive name somehow similar to Spaghetti Western in reflecting an initial contempt for the genre. The term poliziottesco was a fusion of the words poliziotto (cop), and the suffix -esco, “related to,” akin to the English “-esque.” It had a negative connotation, compared to poliziesco (from polizia, “police”), which was the commonly used term for foreign crime and action films as well as police-related dramas. It was not just used in order to distinguish Italian crime flicks\n\nfrom their (supposedly much better) U.S. counterparts, but it actually implied a sarcastic sneer, a biased attitude. Yet, even though the influence of films such as Dirty Harry (1971, Don Siegel) or The French Connection (1971, William Friedkin) was evident, Italian crime films were the true descendants of Westerns, set in contemporary Italy—the violent, tormented Italy of the 1970s. The renaissance of the crime film in the ’70s was predated by such respected works as Elio Petri’s Oscar-winning Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto, 1970) and Damiano Damiani’s Confessions of a Police Captain (Confessione di un commissario di polizia al Procuratore della Repubblica, 1971), which mixed social commitment and genre cinema, became huge box office hits and were praised by critics. If Petri’s film won an Academy Award and assertively used a sui generis crime plot for a reflection on power within contemporary Italy (a famous line has the Commissioner, played by Gian Maria Volonté, state “repression is civilization”—a darkly ironic hint at the repressive role of the police force against the 1968 Student Movement), Confessions of a Police Captain can be seen as the true antecedent of the poliziottesco, which according to many critics began in 1972 when Stefano Vanzina’s Execution Squad (La polizia ringrazia) turned out a surprise hit, launching what would be one of the most popular genres of the decade, before the economic crisis that led to the death of the Italian popular movie industry in the 1980s took hold. After Execution Squad, dozens of crime films flooded the screen during the following years. They were mainly modestly budgeted works, starring popular actors—some of them, such as Franco Nero or Tomas Milian, were veterans of the Western genre while others, such as Maurizio Merli, Luc Merenda and Franco Gasparri were relative newcomers—and were helmed by capable filmmakers, including Fernando di Leo, Enzo G. Castellari, Umberto Lenzi, Stelvio Massi. Tough cops as played by Merli (the genre’s icon), Merenda, Nero and others are hard yet deeply honest men—incorruptible, often penniless and unlucky in love, with just one thing in mind: justice. They always complain that their hands are tied by unjust (read: too liberal) laws, and their enemies are not just crooks and corrupt politicians, but also magistrates and lawyers who permit criminals to stay out of jail. Happy endings were not the norm, however. In poliziottesco the tough cop most likely does not survive in the end, as he is usually shot in the back in the middle of the street, just when everyone is ready for the end credits to roll. The sub-genre was labeled as fascist by many critics of the time, who were unable to understand that one of the keys to its success was precisely the way it cunningly exploited the viewer’s dissatisfaction and demand for justice, just like Italian Westerns captured their audience by exploiting violence and sadism, without any true political colors. In the same film one could find a cop deliver an almost fascist speech and later on speak of tolerance like a left-wing activist. What’s more, the hero was almost always characterized as proletarian, whereas the villains were wealthy, powerful, and right-wing. The results were more likely apolitical, if not anarchist: not an uncommon trait in genre cinema. Most of all, however, poliziotteschi gave moviegoers the heroes they were in desperate need of, by capturing and representing their anxiety and anger in a climate of urban violence, decaying institutions and armed struggle. These films depicted exemplary characters and stories, and told sharp parables of life and death. They offered a ninety-minute trip to hell and back, a cathartic path that allowed\n\nviewers to make sense of the horror and cruelty they had to face daily in real life, and the opportunity to walk out of the theatres with their heads held high, ignoring fears and anxieties in the hope that somewhere, somehow, someone would restore justice. That’s why poliziotteschi are a very important, if not essential, chapter in the history of Italian popular cinema: their study is vital to understand not only the evolution and decline of a film industry (which in the 1980s collapsed after a long-term crisis which was heightened by the rise of commercial TV networks), but also the changing moods of the country that nurtured it. Poliziotteschi—or, as they were commonly known abroad, Italo-crime, Euro-crime or simply Italian crime films—were moderately successful in foreign markets, but didn’t attain the same diffusion as the Spaghetti Western. Many were released to home video—albeit in poorly dubbed, sometimes badly cut or re-edited versions—and gradually won over a cult status, especially when younger cinephiles started getting interested in European genre cinema. A turning point came when such popular filmmakers as Quentin Tarantino started championing the films by Lenzi, Castellari, and di Leo, and talked of these directors not as mere hacks but as out-and-out auteurs. Meanwhile, in Italy, poliziotteschi were experiencing a critical rediscovery and reevaluation, after the biased attitude that was commonplace among Italian film critics at the time of their release. This occurred also thanks to the work of fanzines and film magazines: most notably, Nocturno Cinema, a mag entirely devoted to Italian exploitation and genre films which featured interviews with a number of filmmakers who had been long forgotten and provided in-depth (if sometimes overtly partisan) essays on their works. The new attention brought about the re-release of many titles for the home video market by a number of labels, most notably Alan Young, NoShame and Raro Video, allowing the younger generations to finally find out what Eurocrime was about. This book lists all the poliziotteschi produced and released in Italy between 1968—a key year, with the release of Carlo Lizzani’s Bandits in Milan (Banditi a Milano), which proved to be a turning point for Italian crime film—and 1980—which saw its rapid decline—based on the films’ release date in their home country. Also listed are those films that, even though they cannot be considered poliziotteschi in the strictest sense, are part of threads which often crossed paths with the typical police-related dramas, since a common practice in Italian genre cinema was to mix genres and try different approaches to the subject matter. Such are the Mafia movie, which germinated after politically committed dramas such as We Still Kill the Old Way (A ciascuno il suo, 1967, Elio Petri) and The Day of the Owl a.k.a. Mafia (Il giorno della civetta, 1968, Damiano Damiani) and was fortified by the commercial success of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather (1972); the film noir, which was often akin to poliziotteschi but in most cases displayed literary origins (such as the novels by Giorgio Scerbanenco, Italy’s greatest hard-boiled novelist) and had in Fernando di Leo its most important exponent; and a peculiar hybrid which mixed the poliziotteschi’s flair for urban violence with a typical form of Neapolitan-based play (the so-called sceneggiata) which even included songs, and was immensely popular in Southern Italy in the late 1970s. Besides, I’m also briefly discussing the role and evolution of the crime film in Italian post–World War II film industry, as well as the genre’s struggle for survival in the 1990s and 2000s. On the other hand, parodies and out-and-out comedies where the crime element is just a tiny pretext are not listed in the book. Each entry has a comprehensive crew and cast list that is as complete as possible, based on the film’s opening and closing credits. Uncredited extras are also listed whenever possible, as those same faces\n\nwould pop up again and again in an outstanding number of Italian films. Home video releases are also listed, with preference given to DVD releases. However, even though a number of Italian crime films are available on DVD and Blu-ray, many were released only on VHS, either in Italy or in foreign markets (especially Northern Europe). When a film is mentioned in the text for the first time, its English title comes first (if there was an English language release) followed by the original Italian one and the year. For those films that circulated only in Italy, a literal translation of the Italian title is provided. As such, this volume is the most complete work in the English language dedicated to Italian crime films so far. My aim is to make each entry stand alone and be an interesting read in itself, as well as a piece of a larger mosaic, depicting a more complex view. My hope is that, after reading this book, the casual reader has developed not just an interest in the crime genre, but also a deeper understanding of Italian post–World War II history and costume. The information provided throughout the text is the result of a thorough research from a variety of sources such as academic texts and essays on Italian history and other assorted material—interviews with filmmakers and actors, newspaper reviews, original scripts—which is listed in the bibliography. Finally, I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart Mario and Roderick Gauci from Naxxar, Malta, and Mark Ashworth, an English gentleman in Rome, for they had the patience and dedication to read and revise the manuscript; Manlio Gomarasca, editor-in-chief of Nocturno Cinema, who kindly provided pictures from the magazine’s archives; Carlos Aguilar, who also helped me with beautiful rare pics; Vittorio Salerno, who kindly allowed me to use stills from his own personal archive; and soundtrack expert Emanuele Leotta, for helping with OST information. My most sincere gratitude goes also to the following, who helped in one way or the other in the making of this book: Tom Betts, José Antonio Diego Bogajo, Pino Bruni, Davide Cavaciocchi, Davide Comotti, Matteo Di Giulio, Adriano “Magou” Di Gaspero, Alessio Di Rocco, Adrián Esbilla, Giovanni Ferrari, Ernesto Gastaldi, Sergio Grmek Germani, Gabriele Giuli, Gianluca Guaitoli, Tommaso La Selva, Gabrielle Lucantonio, Antonio José Navarro, Alberto Pezzotta, Tom Prickette, Davide Pulici, Donato Totaro, Tonino Valerii.\n\nAn Overview of Italian Crime Films, 1947–1967 The history of Italian crime cinema is deeply connected to that of the country that nurtured it, even going back to the very first examples of the genre. After the restrictions and escapist dreams of the Fascist period, the immediate post-war scenario was that of a nation in ruins. Neorealism showed a side of Italy that many—including the government—thought should be best forgotten. Bandits, pimps, black market dealers made their appearance in films that recounted what was happening in the country, without sweetening the pill. That was the case with Tombolo (Tombolo paradiso nero, 1947, Giorgio Ferroni), Manù il contrabbandiere (1947, Lucio De Caro), Alberto Lattuada’s The Bandit (Il bandito, 1946) and Without Pity (Senza pietà, 1948), which can all be considered part of the so-called “Black Neorealism.” Even Giuseppe De Santis’s Bitter Rice (Riso amaro, 1949), which blended Neorealist elements with others taken from various sources, featured several sequences—such as the final shootout in the butcher’s shop, with sides of veal and livestock hanging from the ceiling, lit in an Expressionist manner—which were the stuff of out-and-out film noir. Italy’s most interesting early crime films of the 1940s and ’50s were Pietro Germi’s Lost Youth (Gioventù perduta, 1947) and Four Ways Out (La città si difende, 1951) and Fernando Cerchio’s marvelous but little-known Il bivio (1951). Co-scripted by Germi and, among others, future film directors Antonio Pietrangeli and Mario Monicelli, Lost Youth depicts the exploits of a band of robbers headed by a wealthy young man above suspicion (Jacques Sernas). The film is notable for the character of a sympathetic commissioner (Massimo Girotti) who feels inadequate in his job and bitterly regrets having left university because of the war. Stylistically, Germi moved away from Neorealism: Hollywood products were flooding Italian cinemas as a result of post-war regulations (600 American films were distributed in Italian theaters in 1946 alone), and the influence of American film noir is evident in the way Lost Youth is shot and lit, as well as in the portrayal of a town that becomes magical at night, a mysterious double of itself. The way characters dress, move and talk in Lost Youth definitely shows how Hollywood imagery colonized Italian cinema: Sernas refers to Alan Ladd (his trench coat is identical to the one worn by This Gun’s for Hire’s Philip Raven) and Robert Mitchum, and buys expensive gifts for the nightclub dancer he’s in love with, just as he has seen his movie heroes do. However, Germi does not shy away from realism: Italian censors were not fond of the way Lost Youth depicted post–War Italy: the film was initially denied a visa for public screening, and the decision was only revoked after a letter was sent to the then Secretary of State (and president of the Censorship Commission) Giulio Andreotti, signed by Germi and 30 other directors. However, the censors demanded a couple of scenes be cut, as Lost Youth was judged too pessimistic and demoralizing for viewers. One such scene featured a statistic lesson in college where the focus was on the rising wave of criminality in the country on the base of graphics, statistic datas and the mention real-life recent events; while another character compared old-time criminals to the new ones (the title’s “lost youth”), who would even steal their mothers’ dentures—a line the censors didn’t like in the least.\n\nGermi returned to the crime film four years later with Four Ways Out, the story of a holdup at a stadium and its tragic aftermath. The director focused on the stories of four desperate delinquents and their tragic attempts at escape through the city: it was once again the starting point for a harsh view of early ’50s Italy, a country that was laboriously rising up from the ashes but still had to face many inner contradictions and problems. The opening holdup—a silent, masterfully edited sequence— shows Germi’s perfect control of the medium, and the use of real locations and several semidocumentary sequences once again hint at the director’s love for American film noir (namely, Jules Dassin’s The Naked City and Elia Kazan’s Panic in the Streets). Germi resorted to the crime genre, even more so than in Lost Youth, as a way to make poignant social commentary. One of Il bivio’s most interesting aspects is casting. In a daring move, Raf Vallone—one of Italy’s most popular actors of the decade and usually typecast as the hero—plays a gang leader who infiltrates the police, becomes a vice–Commissioner and exploits his position to commit robberies, but his ambition to control and steer other people’s actions is illusory. At the heart of the film (whose title means “the crossroads”) is the protagonist’s growing moral dilemma: the need to face the consequences of his behavior (innocent parties arrested, ruined families, colleagues killed in the line of duty). This division between self-interest and desire to atone eventually leads the (anti)hero to his death. Both Four Ways Out and Il bivio portray a country that is trying to get back on its feet after years of disarray following World War II, but whose deep lacerations are still visible; many ideals have already collapsed—in Il bivio Vallone is a disillusioned war hero—and the slow economic recovery already has claimed its victims. The mirage of easy money has corrupted consciences and ruined lives. Once again the censors were not happy—this time because the film supposedly portrayed a negative image of the police force in several scenes, such as the one where the guards who are escorting a shipment of valuables by train are shown playing cards, and the one where they are disarmed and lined up, hands up and face to the wall, by a gang of robbers. Another deleted scene showed a commissioner slapping an arrested man in the face during a questioning: an image which was to become iconic in the following decades. Germi returned once again to the genre at the end of the ’50s, with a picture that he himself labeled as “the first Italian crime film.” Actually, The Facts of Murder (Un maledetto imbroglio, 1959) was more of a whodunit, loosely based on one of the greatest Italian novels of the twentieth century, Carlo Emilio Gadda’s experiment in language Quer pasticciaccio brutto de via Merulana, published in 1957. It was a bold move on Germi’s part to adapt the almost impossible-to-film novel by eliminating its most recognizable element—Gadda’s complex use of dialectal language and interior monologue— while retaining its thematic core. The director mixed two apparently opposite genres—police drama and comedy—but it was not his intent to make a hybrid. On the contrary, funny or naturalistic moments at times openly clash with detection and action scenes. The result is a deeply moral film that is both desperate and sarcastic at the same time. Germi himself, in the role of Inspector Ingravallo, is an ideal lead with his stern features and peculiar accent. The director would portray a similar character in Damiano Damiani’s directorial debut Lipstick (Il rossetto, 1960). In the 1960s, filmmakers who were deeply involved with social and political issues, such as Francesco Rosi, Florestano Vancini and Carlo Lizzani, once again used the crime genre in order to analyze Italy’s past and present alike. Thanks also to the loosening of censorship, it was easier to portray the country, its recent history and its problems without clashing with the commission’s\n\nrequests. Films like Lizzani’s The Hunchback of Rome (Il gobbo, 1960), Duilio Coletti’s Black City (Il re di Poggioreale, 1961, co-scripted by John Fante) and Florestano Vancini’s La banda Casaroli (1962) examined well-known real-life episodes and characters, the most successful of the lot being La banda Casaroli, one of the best Italian films of the decade. Paolo Casaroli and his acolytes, a gang of improvised bandits in immediate post-war Italy, were emblematic figures of the period. Vancini’s winning move was to cast Renato Salvatori against type as the titular lead. He was an actor more used to playing the love interest in comedies such as Poor But Handsome (Poveri ma belli, 1957) and Mario Monicelli’s wonderful Big Deal on Madonna Street (I soliti ignoti, 1958). La banda Casaroli can be seen as a rejection of the unpretentious, often politically unchallenging cinema made in the previous decade—a tendency driven and heightened by the suffocating censorship on the part of the country’s leading party Democrazia Cristiana, as censorship boards would examine the scripts beforehand and had the power to influence the economic credit given to the producers by the state. The historical context is portrayed with elegance and extreme precision: old Fascist mottos painted on decaying tenements, rural strikes, empty streets with the occasional vehicle driving by—a symbol of wealth that everyone desires. Casaroli and his gang use cars in order to make easy escapes after their robberies, but in the end, ironically, it’s an automobile that becomes a death trap for them when it’s revealed that Casaroli can’t drive. Vancini does not absolve the characters, but he understands their reasons: the post-war confusion, the anti-bourgeois grievances, the mirage of an easy life. He portrays a generation of misfits in search of strong emotions, who are unable to submit to the logic of sacrifice and work that are needed to rebuild the country. Stylistically, La banda Casaroli is an extremely accomplished work, built around an elaborate flashback structure and featuring several outstanding sequences, such as the long central chase in the streets of Bologna. Interestingly, the last half-hour focuses on one of Casaroli’s men, played by a young Tomas Milian, who desperately wanders around town after his boss has been arrested, and finally ends up in a cinema where he commits suicide while a newsreel announces the re-election of Democratic Christian premier Alcide De Gasperi—a further hint at Vanzini’s political discourse. The ’60s, however, were a colored, chaotic decade for Italian cinema. Screens were flooded with erotic documentaries, Gothic flicks, earli gialli, Spaghetti Westerns, James Bond rip-offs. Most crime entries followed the latter thread, yet the connection between the fast-paced, multicolored spy yarns and the crime films of the following decade are vague at best. Even though filmmakers such as Sergio Sollima and Umberto Lenzi served their apprenticeship in the spy genre, these films’ light-hearted, escapist tone was still a product of the euphoria raised by the economic boom of the early 1960s, and their overall optimism was in stark contrast with the film industry’s growing economic difficulties (which the explosion of Spaghetti Western could only partially hide). Moreover, despite the James Bond look-alikes’ nonchalant recourse to weapons, violence was always hyperbolic, innocuous, comic book-like.\n\nRobert Hoffmann as Luciano Lutring, “the machine-gun soloist,” in Wake Up and Kill (1966).\n\nMeanwhile, the Italian underworld was changing. Carlo Lizzani examined two exemplary figures within a new generation of criminals spawned by the decade’s delusions of wealth and well-being. Wake Up and Kill (Svegliati e uccidi, 1966) and Bandits in Milan a.k.a. The Violent Four (Banditi a Milano, 1968) were basically action movies with a strong sociological component, where the minute attention to the sociological prevailed over the spectacular hyperbole. Lizzani described an urban crime environment characterized by an individual and consumerist revenge, sometimes hidden under an ostensible social rebellion—and he did so with remarkable results. Bandits in Milan, released in such a crucial year as 1968, is in every way the landmark that would pave the way for 1970 crime films, and serves as an ideal starting point for this book.\n\nAbbreviations The following abbreviations are used in the credits list for each entry.

OST: 7' Ariete AR 8004 (Strange World / La giostra della vita) sung by Katyna Ranieri Milan, September 25, 1967. After a bank robbery gone wrong and a car chase across the streets of Milan, a gang of robbers is vanquished. Commissioner Basevi illustrates to a film crew how vice and crime thrive and flourish in a huge city with a high technological potential and a widespread economic well-being. Then the film reconstructs the stories of the four bandits and follows the preparation and execution of the robbery. The quartet was led by Piero Cavallero, a former partisan, smart and presumptuous, who posed as a businessman and led a double life, while one of his men was a seventeen-year-old kid. Cavallero eludes capture with his lieutenant Sandro Giannantonio, while the other two accomplices are captured. After a manhunt in the countryside which goes on for eight days, Cavallero and Giannantonio are surrounded and eventually surrender to the cops. Coming after the political western Requiescant (1967), starring Lou Castel, Bandits in Milan was\n\nCarlo Lizzani’s return to present-day Italy as well as one of his most ambitious films to date. As with Wake Up and Kill, the director chose to adapt a notorious true crime story in order to show the first examples of modern gangsterism in Italy, such as the prostitution and gambling racket, the escalation of robberies and a growing, more violent underworld. If Luciano Lutring—the “machine-gun soloist” in Wake Up and Kill—was moved by the logic of need, the titular Bandits in Milan are moved by a logic of profit. As Lizzani stated, “Earlier on there had been episodes of classical banditism, in a rural environment [...] or else because of World War II, with war veterans becoming bandits and so on. Whereas nowadays it was simply gangsterism, a phenomenon which belonged to affluent societies, such as North America in the ’20s or Italy in the ’60s [...] My ambition was not to simply make an action movie [...] but a film which reflected the Italian social context, with a very definite realistic and sociological setting.”1 Bandits in Milan was based on a bank robbery gone wrong that took place on September 25, 1967, in Milan. The bandits were led by Pietro Cavallero, played in the film by Gian Maria Volonté. The four gangsters (Cavallero, his lieutenant Sante Notarnicola, Adriano Rovoletto and underage Donato Lopez) robbed many banks using the same technique over and over: three hold-ups in the same day, a short distance from each other. The greater the risks, the more the chances to get away without getting caught, given the confusion and police forces having to disperse on several fronts. Between robberies, Cavallero and his men led a normal bourgeois life. Nobody suspected them. The Milan robbery was Cavallero’s seventeenth hit. Rovoletto, the driver, waited for his accomplices in a Fiat 1100 which he stole from a nearby parking lot, but a shop owner noticed suspicious moves and called the police. A long, wild chase followed all over Milan, ending with four dead and 22 injured. Eventually the bandits’ car was rammed and crashed into a tree. Rovoletto—an arm broken by a police bullet—tried to hide among the crowd, but was recognized and almost got lynched. His accomplices escaped, but their days were numbered. Donato Lopez, the younger of the trio, was arrested the following day in his own home, under his mother’s eyes. Cavallero and Notarnicola fled to the countryside: a dragnet ensued, which ended eight days later, on October 3, 1967, in an abandoned signalman’s box about 100 kms from Milan. Bandits in Milan came out in spring 1968, simultaneously at the first instance of the Assize Court of Milan, which sentenced Cavallero, Notarnicola and Rovoletto to life imprisonment, while Lopez was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months. As with his previous crime films of the ’50s and ’60s (such as The Hunchback of Rome and Wake Up and Kill), Lizzani’s method takes inspiration from the Neorealist lesson, “moving back from the chronicle of a single event to the social canvas that produced those social outcasts.”2 Here, however, the director opts for a more thought-provoking approach. The film begins with a semi-documentary prologue which recalls a television report: shots among the crowd, an ample use of zoom and handheld camera convey an impression of immediacy and perspective. Then the tone changes brusquely. A Commissioner (Tomas Milian)—who looks rather self-important, and was probably modeled on a then very popular real-life police Commissioner, Luigi Calabresi—guides a film crew through a series of sketches which recreate everyday episodes of criminal life: a nightclub owner refuses to pay the racket and his place is destroyed, a prostitute (Margaret Lee) is burnt alive by her pimps and so on. Lizzani’s thesis is evident: in one scene the film crew interviews an elderly robber (Luigi Rossetti) who synthesizes the differences between old and new criminality with the phrase “We used\n\nto be more gentlemen.”\n\nEnglish language poster for Bandits in Milan, a.k.a. The Violent Four (1968). However, the pseudo-objective approach is contradicted by the stylized set pieces (as in the nightclub scene, with balloons replacing the sight of the thugs breaking up the place) and the often incongruous details (such as the R&B song La pelle nera by Nino Ferrer accompanying the beating and subsequent death of a prostitute). What’s more, Lizzani opts for an unrealistic, comic-book style with grotesque touches: the story of the dead prostitute is told as if it was a fotoromanzo, with abundance of clichés, while a scene involving a phone call between the commissioner and a nymphomaniac (played by Carla Gravina, then Volonté’s lover) is outright hilarious. It’s an uneasy, daring choice, which somehow puts the viewer off-guard, and bewildered many critics at the time of the film’s release.3 It’s only after such an extended and misleading build-up, that Bandits in Milan’s main character is introduced. Much like Luciano Lutring, Pietro Cavallero (played by an extraordinary Gian Maria Volonté) is a son of his times. He is a former partisan and left-wing militant who abandoned both his party and political struggle (because “They’re all pretty good at talking nonsense in there, but I want to eat right now, and I’m going to fight my war by myself!”) and reinvented himself as an entrepreneur of crime, putting into use his knowledge of guerrilla warfare. This kind of metropolitan banditism is characterized by “an individual and consumistic sense of compensation, even though it’s dressed up with the colors of social rebellion,”4 unlike the rural banditism of Lizzani’s following film The Tough and the Mighty (Barbagia, 1969).\n\nGian Maria Volonté, left, and Don Backy in Carlo Lizzani’s Bandits in Milan (1968). Unlike Lutring, though, Cavallero and his gang learned the rules of the game and hid their criminal activity behind the respectable cover of a ghostly agency, complete with a long-legged secretary. Lizzani achieves memorable results in depicting a cultured bandit who reads Camus and uses a language similar to that of a Communist politician, a “left-wing lexicon which is no longer shared.”5 Cavallero takes an obvious delight in his conceitedness and presumption, and after the arrest he keeps bragging to journalists about his exploits. But behind his delusions of grandeur, what is left is the nondescript nature of his activity. Compared to the ruthless and ever-spreading organized crime, Cavallero and his accomplices are willing amateurs at best. Lizzani is particularly good at showing the petty, prosaic and petit bourgeois nature of these Padanian gangsters: the morning before their last hit, Cavallero and his men wake up early, travel from Turin to Milan and have breakfast at a bar, just like ordinary commuters. Near the end, while they’re hiding from the police, Cavallero and his sidekick Notarnicola trace a balance sheet of their criminal activity as if they were normal businessmen. “Five years work, that makes 17 hits, 75 million liras. 14 million liras a year divided by three, it’s about 4 million liras each ... let’s say 300,000 lire a month.” “Then there are expenses, the office, cars, motorway tickets, dinners ... my friend, being a bandit is an expensive job!” At the time of its release, the fact that it had been shot on the heels of real events6 was viewed as\n\nBandits in Milan’s biggest limit: critics called it “a dynamic and lively picture which nevertheless lacks any real depth.”7 Over forty years later, this seems the real strength of Lizzani’s film. The sociological analysis in real time reveals an electrical climate, and a subterranean tension which is about to explode, as shown by the impressive scenes of the crowd in revolt, trying to lynch Cavallero’s accomplice, which arrived on screens during the 1968 riots in Italy’s biggest cities. Compared to Wake Up and Kill, Bandits in Milan has a more complex and multi-layered narrative construction, with a series of flashbacks that punctuate the interrogation of Rovoletto. The bank robbery scene and the frantic, extremely well-shot car chase that follows (something of a novelty in an Italian film, which contributed enormously to the pic’s success) display a dynamism and sheer visual force which are still relevant nowadays, and the director makes first-rate use of on-location shooting in central Milan. The acting is also excellent: besides Volonté’s powerhouse performance and the always reliable Milian in a supporting role, Lizzani assembled a strong supporting cast which included a very young Ray Lovelock, who would become one of the genre’s most popular faces, and singer-turned actor Don Backy (real name Aldo Caponi) who would work again with Lizzani the following year on the rural bandit drama The Tough and the Mighty before moving on to ribald period comedies. Backy delivered another strong performance in Mario Bava’s Rabid Dogs (Cani arrabbiati, 1974) as a psychotic bank robber. Lizzani himself has a cameo as a police official, while a very young Agostina Belli is the girl Cavallero and his men take as a hostage after the robbery. Watching Bandits in Milan one has the feeling that the times were ripe for the birth of an Italian crime genre with its own original and believable traits: Lizzani’s film is closely related to the chronicle of its time, it takes place in appropriate urban contexts and, more importantly, it conveys an expressive power that has nothing to begrudge the foreign models.

Mario Corda and his accomplice Erico rob a huge sum of money from the post office transit at the Termini train station. Corda then joins his unsuspecting partner Lea and their son Luigino at the circus. However, the police are on Corda’s tracks: he escapes, leaving his house and family, and plans another heist—robbing a supermarket’s takings—with Erico before retiring. But the hold-up goes wrong when the gun-happy Erico kills the supermarket owner and a police officer. Corda is captured and imprisoned. Erico attempts another robbery with three accomplices, which ends in bloodshed. He plans to take refuge in Greece with Eva, but his behavior becomes increasingly violent and unpredictable. Eventually a stubborn police commissioner identifies Erico’s accomplices and apprehends them. Corda escapes from jail, only to find that his vicious accomplice has raped and killed Lea. He reaches Erico, who was about to leave on a plane, and kills him before being arrested once more.\n\nJohn Cassavetes in Bandits in Rome (1968). Obviously conceived after the success of Bandits in Milan—as proven by the English language title —Alberto De Martino’s film nonetheless leaves aside the Marxist analysis and sociological implications of Lizzani’s work and concentrates on action. The Italian title, which translates to Rome as Chicago, gives away its makers’ intentions: to create a gangster movie shaped like an American one. In other words, instead of focusing on the peculiarities and sociological traits of the Roman underworld, the script describes a fictitious Italy which looks more like an exotic version of an American city. Bandits in Rome is very much a product shaped for exportation, and De Martino’s “Americanized Rome,” in the director’s own words, is a rather phony scenario to a story which\n\nsounds precious little “Italian.” Produced by Dino De Laurentiis, Bandits in Rome is technically first-rate: the cinematography is by Aldo Tonti (Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria, Rossellini’s Europe ’51 and India among others), while Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai’s score—itself a reworking of Morricone’s music for the 1967 TV show Musica da sera1—gives the proceedings a classy touch, and De Martino’s direction is efficient even though not particularly impressive, displaying an undeniable skill in filming action scenes. As for the cast, John Cassavetes was presumably enjoying a well-paid European vacation so as to finance his own directorial projects: as a matter of fact, despite being first-billed, his presence on screen is volatile. After the initial sequences, he has very little screen time, leaving the scene to Greek idol Kourkoulos, in search of an international notoriety that never came. Recalling his relationship with Cassavetes, De Martino said: “He is the most difficult actor I have ever worked with. When we first met, his wife Gena Rowlands came too. He introduced me to her as “the most intelligent director in Europe.” She looked at me and said “Give him time!” (laughs). After the first week of shooting John and I started having arguments, and from then on we kept bickering and making peace, all the time. [...] However, when we finished the film he told me “Alberto, it’s nice to work with you!,” so at least we parted on good terms ... which didn’t happen between him and Giuliano Montaldo [with whom Cassavetes did Machine Gun McCain, Authors’ note].”2 As an expert gangster who leads a dual life as a middle-class bourgeois, Cassavetes’ Mario Corda looks like a cleaner, more palatable version of Bandits in Milan’s Pietro Cavallero (he even pretends to run an import-export agency). However, Corda never really comes alive as a character. He just doesn’t look and sound real, unlike Volonté’s Cavallero, as the script depicts him as an oldtime gangster from some ’40s Hollywood movie: he repeatedly boasts of never having killed anyone, and says he is respected and revered in the underworld. Yet it’s never quite clear how he ended up teaming with such an obnoxious, gun-crazy and mentally unstable partner as Erico: perhaps that can be explained by looking at the credits and counting a total of nine (!) scriptwriters, which somehow also gives away the film’s uneasiness in dealing with the gangster genre and its over-reliance on clichés (take, for instance, Corda’s clumsily explained escape from jail, or the rather unconvincing description of police procedural activities). That’s also true for the subplot regarding Corda’s love story with Lea, told in a few jarringly dull flashbacks. However, despite the film’s shortcomings (and Kourkoulos’ hammy portrayal of Corda’s antagonist), the character of Erico is Bandits in Rome’s most interesting and significant trait. A proletarian outsider who loves flamboyant dresses and fast motorbikes, and whose furious sexual appetite is complementary to his unsatiable thirst for violence, Erico is a dangerous, unpredictable and utterly vicious walking time-bomb of a madman, with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. A deranged, antisocial product of the Roman outskirts, a renegade who dons a platinum blond wig for a robbery not so much for camouflaging as for a deviated sense of mockery, Erico is a surprising anticipation of the following decade’s most impressive villains such as Tomas Milian’s Giulio Sacchi (Almost Human) or the hunchback Vincenzo Moretto (Brutal Justice). On the other hand, Ferzetti’s unnamed middle-aged Commissioner is still an old-style good cop who despises violence, has a smoking habit, dresses impeccably and always follows his instinct. Of course, he never ever touches a gun. Within a few years, his ’70s counterparts would drop good manners and grab the gun. However, he too has at least one line of dialogue which, even though inadvertently, predates a\n\nleitmotif of Italian crime films to come. To a journalist who asks him, “But what are we going to write in the newspapers?,” he replies sarcastically: “Write what you always have: the police grope in the dark!” Notes\n\n1.

Angel-face Jason and his stepbrother Adam are small-time gangsters in New Mexico, both very close to their alcoholic mother Marta. After robbing a jewelry and dispatching a rival gang, Jason tries to cut Adam out of his share, but he is betrayed by his girlfriend Karin, who is also his stepbrother’s lover. Adam gets his gang to mangle Jason’s gun hand. Jason is rescued and nursed back to health by the wealthy Barbara, who falls for him—yet his only thought is for revenge. After Marta inadvertedly reveals Adam and Karin’s whereabouts in Queimado, New Mexico, Jason goes to avenge himself, but he is once again betrayed by Karin, with whom he is still desperately in love. Adam and Karin plan to get rid of Jason, but a tremendous earthquake upsets everybody’s schemes...\n\nGiuliano Gemma in The Bastard (1968) (courtesy Carlos Aguilar). If Bandits in Milan and Bandits in Rome firmly located the gangster genre in contemporary Italy and opted for realistic—and in the case of Lizzani’s film even semi-documentaristic—tones, Duccio Tessari’s first gangster film The Bastard opts for a totally different approach. Starting from the casting of Giuliano Gemma and Klaus Kinski as stepbrothers on the wrong side of the law, to the plot’s many twists and turns, up to the offbeat (and somehow off-putting) ending, it’s obvious that Tessari’s film is not meant to be the least bit realistic. Take the brothers’ relationship with their alcoholic mother, played by Rita Hayworth: the woman is well aware of her sons’ illegal activities, yet her only concern is having a bottle of whiskey at hand (“I haven’t had a drink since this morning ... that’s probably why I’m blue”), and even asking Jason for a crate of the juice as her birthday gift, while the scene where the happy dysfunctional family is reunited plays like a sort of demented sitcom minus offscreen laughs. By emphasizing the subtle stream of hatred between Adam and his younger, almost child-like brother, Tessari and his official co-writers Mario Di Nardo and Ennio De Concini explicitly update one of Italian Western’s favorite themes, the destructive conflicts that destroy a family from the inside. Furthermore, the director’s stylish use of ample open spaces and long shots gives the film quite a different shape and rhythm compared to contemporary Italian gangster films. Indeed, The Bastard is a wild fantasy which openly plays like a modern-day variation on typical Spaghetti Western themes.\n\nWhile the latter genre is slowly moving adrift towards the kind of parodic exaggerations exemplified by 1970’s They Call Me Trinity, The Bastard retains Italian Western’s tendency towards violent excesses, as represented by the film’s centerpiece. After ambushing his stepbrother and his fiancée Karin (the ravishing Margaret Lee, in an impressive performance as an unscrupulous, duplicitous femme fatale) during an intimate moment on a river-bed, Adam has Jason reveal the location of some hidden jewels by threatening to rape Karin in front of him, before it turns out she’s actually Adam’s lover as well. Then Klaus Kinski—wearing a bizarre pair of metal sunglasses—has one of his men (a seedy-looking doctor played by ubiquitous character actor Umberto Raho) cut off Gemma’s right hand’s tendons, so that he won’t be able to use a gun. “You’ve always been such a good shot. When we were kids shooting at cans, it didn’t matter ... but now ... I can’t take that chance,” he explains. It’s a scene that wouldn’t have been out of place in Lucio Fulci’s Massacre Time (Le colt cantarono la morte e fu ... tempo di massacro, 1966), which shares a peculiar Oedipal subtext with Tessari’s film. The fact that Massacre Time was written by Fernando di Leo, Tessari’s close friend and collaborator on a number of Westerns (including uncredited work on Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars) must not be overlooked. When asked about his involvement on The Bastard, Di Leo used to skip the subject, but it’s likely he actually had a hand in the script. For once, the scene where Gemma practices shooting with his left by trying to hit a harp’s strings is another over-the-top moment in pure Di Leo style, not to mention the final earthquake, an unexpected deus ex machina which comes out of the blue just when one is expecting a typical climactic showdown between the brothers. The English language version, however, omits the real ending as devised by Tessari: it ends with Jason helping Adam get out of his house’s ruins, only to shoot him immediately afterwards. “Don’t thank me... We’ve got accounts to settle, and no one else is gonna get in between—not even God!” Jason spits out between shots. In the original edit, though, Jason is in turn killed by his mother, who just showed up after hearing of the earthquake on TV. Said ending eventually turned out in the American DVD release (as The Cats, which was the original working title).1\n\nGiuliano Gemma, Klaus Kinski and Rita Hayworth in The Bastard (1968) (courtesy Carlos Aguilar). For all its merits, The Bastard only partially succeeds. Plot faults are all over the place, from the confusing early scene in a nightclub where Jason gets rid of rival gangsters to the lame romantic interlude between Gemma and former Bond-girl Claudine Auger (which even includes the presence of singing cowboys in a scene, as another stab at the Western genre), while a subplot about a heist job Jason performs with an associate played by Serge Marquand is just half-baked. However, Tessari gets good performances from his leading men, with Kinski voraciously stealing every scene he is in as the hypochondriac, vicious Adam and Gemma getting no less than four love scenes with his two\n\nladies. Despite credits stating that it was an Italian / French / German co-production, actor Dan van Husen adamantly claims the film was actually an Italian / Spanish co-production, with the working title being Los Gatos, which would explain why it was mostly shot in Spain, outside of Madrid, while only the opening sequence was filmed in the U.S.2 If it proves the fil rouge between the Western and crime genre, on the other hand The Bastard predates the use that 1970’s Italian crime films would make of Hollywood has-beens in its casting of Rita Hayworth (after Joan Crawford backed off) in a self-deprecating, even humiliating role. The woman who once was Gilda looks as if she’s acting in a perennial drunken numbness: always with a glass in hand, she even ventures into a philosophical dissertation on the similitude between humans and liquors (“People are like whiskey, you always have to choose the best ... like you did this time”) that’s actually a shameless plug for J&B, whose bottles and crates feature prominently within the film, and which would become the beverage par excellence in Italian cinema over the years. Notes\n\n1. The U.S. Warner Archive Collection DVD has Italian language credits on a print with English language soundtrack. There is no audio at all for the ending, proving that the sequence never circulated in the English market before. 2. E-mail interview, May 2012.

Northon, a gangster who retired from business, wants to avenge the death of his sister Helen. She was married to Frank Cline, who disappeared while transporting 2000 kgs of ingots,\n\ntwo million dollars’ worth—which belong to the Organization—by sea, leaving three dead bodies behind him. An old friend tells him about Regina Westling, a nightclub singer who has been Cline’s lover and so might help him. Regina mentions a Mexican gangster, nicknamed “5 cents,” whom Northon traces and eventually allies with. “5 cents” tells Norton that he’s planning to get the ingots from the sunken ship, but he needs him to open the safety room where the gold is. However, Northon and “5 cents” must face a rival gangster, Albert Torio “the Saint,” who works for the Organization. Northon is kidnapped and tortured by the Nazi, one of the Saint’s men, but “5 cents” saves him. Northon discovers Cline’s dead body inside the ship, but the gold is missing. Northon finds his old friend dead as well, and Regina is also killed by the same assassin, after revealing the gold’s true hideout. Eventually, Northon and “5 cents” get the ingots, but the Saint and his men catch up with them. A confrontation at sea is about to erupt, when a member of the Organization arrives to claim the loot. It turns out that Cline and Helen were killed by the Nazi, who double-crossed the Organization at Torio’s orders. A duel ensues, where Northon kills Torio. Satisfied with his revenge, he leaves all the gold to “5 cents.” However, the gangsters don’t know that the Police have been spying on them all along... Alfio Caltabiano’s second film as a director after the Western Ballad for a Gunman (Ballata per un pistolero, 1967), Comandamenti per un gangster is in many ways a significant work, despite having received modest success upon its release and still being rather obscure nowadays. First of all, it is quite simply, a Western in disguise (or, as critic Pietro Bianchi more articulately put it, “a skillful attempt at applying the Western formula to the Gangster movie trappings”1), that illustrates the natural transition—which would become incresingly evident several years later—between the two genres. The story—written by a young film critic with a brilliant future before him, named Dario Argento— puts together a number of Western film characters and clichés in a contemporary setting (a bogus Canada, recreated in Yugoslavia). A number of elements recall Sergio Leone’s films—including Once Upon a time in the West (C’era una volta il West, 1968): and one wonders whether Argento recycled several elements from that film’s script. Examples are the theme of vengeance (a scene even has Northon contemplate a fold-up hand mirror with a picture of him and his sister, which recalls Lee Van Cleef’s watch in For a Few Dollars More) and over-the-top villains. The Saint (Rade Markovic) is a religious maniac, “an exalted mystic who believes in the redemption of souls through the suffering of bodies” who plays a church organ and tells his victims to make the sign of the cross so that they won’t go to hell after they die. A truly impressive villain, indeed, slightly let down by Markovic’s mediocre screen presence. On the other hand, Caltabiano’s “5 cents” is an athletic, charismatic type who dresses in black leather outfits and wears a lethal glove with iron spikes, while his dumb brother and sidekick “Mitraglia” is a flawless machine-gun specialist. Argento also displays an ear for witty dialogue which will be sorely missed in many of his later films: “5 cents” claims he is “a guy with his own ten commandments, and each one ends with the word ‘money’” (hence the title), while Northon tells Mitraglia, “They should have called you Giotto” after the latter has drawn a perfect circle with a hail of gunfire. But Comandamenti per un gangster is also a whodunit of sorts, and as such it shows several traits that would later become very important in Argento’s oeuvre as a director. The unseen murderer wears black leather gloves (which are often shown in glaring close-ups), leaves coins near his victims as a\n\ncalling-card and is identified by a physical detail—a scar on his wrist. Besides the fetishistic attention to gloves and weapons (Northon has an artisan build him a customized set of tools to open a safety room), there are a number of subjective shots from the murderer’s point of view; also, the script was obviously conceived as a showreel for the young writer, as evidenced by its care for visual tricks, which Caltabiano wisely follows: the camera pans to reveal characters as reflected in mirrors, and there’s a surprising number of sight gags, such as a point of view shot of a man who’s about to be hanged and sees his opponent through the noose that he is about to wear around his neck. Obviously Argento was trying to get noticed, and he definitely succeeds, aided by Caltabiano’s svelte direction. Also featured is Argento’s penchant for pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo (“We extracted the bullets without an autopsy via an electromagnet” a coroner explains). One could go so far as to perceive the scene that takes place in a sunken ship as a blueprint for the celebrated underwater setpiece near the beginning of Inferno (1980), while a vital clue to the solution is provided by a talking parrot—a bird... That’s not to say Comandamenti per un gangster is without its faults. Besides the poor setting, car chases are definitely not Caltabiano’s specialty, as shown by a so-so sequence halfway through; what’s more, Tadic is as wooden as it gets as the unsympathetic hero (a fact which allows Caltabiano to chew every scene he’s in). Yet it’s an extremely enjoyable little film, with Ennio Morricone’s groovy score—itself partly a reworking of his Western themes—being a definite asset. Last but not least, it’s funny to see how Caltabiano and Argento chose to end the film on a mockingly moralistic note—something decidedly not to be found in westerns of the period. Ultimately, the film’s playful approach to the genre is also its most evident shortcoming: Italian crime films to come would definitely be much bleaker, realistic affairs, which traced their roots well into Italian society.

One of the Colasberna brothers, a property developer, is shot to death in his truck near the house of Rosa Nicolosi and her husband. The case is assigned to Captain Bellodi, a man of the North. Bellodi receives an anonymous letter which informs him that the motive behind the killing is a tendering for a new motorway which is being constructed in the zone. Meanwhile, Rosa’s husband disappears and the widow asks help to local mafia boss Don Mariano. Rumours spread that Nicolosi killed Colasberna because he was Rosa’s lover, but Bellodi—who has a local confidant named Parrineddu—doesn’t believe it. He finally has Rosa reveal the murderer’s name: a man called Zecchinetta. The murder was commissioned by Pizzuco, who attempts to blow up Bellodi’s car, but is stopped by Don Mariano. Bellodi arrests Pizzuco and, even though he has no proof, Don Mariano as well. But the mafia boss, who’s got powerful political connections, is released and Bellodi is transferred as punishment. As Don Mariano celebrates his triumph, Parrineddu’s body is found beneath the newly inaugurated motorway. The Mafia has triumphed again. During the 1960s, Italian cinema rediscovered the tendency to reflect on the evolution, mood and problems of civil society—a debate which had been seemingly interrupted by the decline of Neorealism and in later years sporadically reprised. The initiator and reference point of this newlyrevived tendency was Francesco Rosi, with such films as Salvatore Giuliano (1961) and Hands Over the City (Le mani sulla città, 1963). Rosi’s films followed an idea of cinema with distinct expressive and stylistic qualities, that would analyze the country’s recent history through filmic inquiries which took inspiration from true events, such as the 1947 massacre of communist peasants at Portella della Ginestra for Salvatore Giuliano. If the ’60s “Commedia All’Italiana” portrayed the ideological dissolution of the decade in a comedic —although far from absolving—way, the so-called “political-civil cinema” gave voice to the citizen’s progressive loss of trust towards the institutions, as seen through the dramatization and aggrandizement of political actuality. It was, as one critic put it, “a partial compensation of that ruinous detachment from reality which [...] characterized post–Neorealist Italian cinema,”1 and reflected a real state of crisis and civil uneasiness. Such works left a profound political mark and expressed a neat opposition to dominating ideology. They treated such themes as justice, the inefficiency of the prison system, political corruption, Mafia. Yet—an unresolved contradiction which attracted a lot of harsh comments from left-wing critics— they were financed by the same system they were openly and, at times, radically criticizing. These political films had a powerful visual quality and “were strongly oriented towards maintaining strong links with the audience: they didn’t disdain spectacle and were often inscribed within—or at the margins of—genre cinema.”2 Especially, it has to be added, the crime genre.\n\nSometimes, this proximity was just a pretext inside an analysis which was closer to comedy (such as in Ettore Scola’s Il commissario Pepe, 1969) whereas in some cases it would pave the way for an allegory or a pamphlet (as is the case with Elio Petri’s Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, 1970).3 In Damiano Damiani’s films, civil and political commitment are closely linked to formal solutions and narrative themes which are deeply rooted in the crime genre. One of the director’s favorite themes is the relationship between the judicial authority and police, as shown in one of his best films, Confessions of a Police Captain (1971), and the way our idea of righteousness has to cope with raisons d’Etat and the keeping of a deeply antidemocratic political system, led by men whose political and human behavior is identical to those that characterize the Mafia. The encounter between the crime genre and committed “civil” cinema gave birth to a number of films which were intended as a strong spectacular alternative to American models, whose slavish imitation was still the recurring trait in most low budget flicks. The main literary reference point were the works of Leonardo Sciascia, such as The Day of the Owl (Il giorno della civetta, 1961) and To Each His Own (A ciascuno il suo, 1966), which denounced the spreading of the Mafia within crime narratives. Both were adapted for the screen: in 1967 Elio Petri directed We Still Kill the Old Way (A ciascuno il suo, 1967), co-scripted with Ugo Pirro and starring Gian Maria Volonté, which was a box office hit. The success of Petri’s film persuaded producers Ermanno Donati and Luigi Carpentieri— who had already bought the rights to Sciascia’s book and commissioned Gianni Grimaldi for a script —to green light the project. The Day of the Owl was adapted by Pirro and Damiano Damiani, who radically altered and rewrote the novel for the screen. “When I write a script based on a novel, I usually don’t respect the book’s structure,” Pirro explained. “To me, the book is a hint: I must try and preserve its message by using a different language. [...] Sciascia was very polemic and disheartened towards us scriptwriters; but you know, writers always behave like that.”4\n\nItalian poster for The Day of the Owl (1968). As another Sicilian writer, Giuseppe Fava, put it, Sciascia was convinced that the essence of the Mafia was a subtle mind game, and The Day of the Owl tells the story of an ethical and intellectual conflict between a captain of the carabinieri, Bellodi (Franco Nero) and a Mafia boss, Don Mariano (Lee J. Cobb). Damiani and Pirro retained the book’s most famous lines, where Don Mariano says that he divides humanity in five categories: “I,” went on Don Mariano, “have a certain experience of the world; and what we call humanity—all hot air, that word—I divide into five categories: men, half-men, pigmies, arse-crawlers—if you’ll excuse the expression—and quackers. Men are very few indeed; half-men few, and I’d be content if humanity finished with them... But no, it sinks even lower, to the pigmies who’re like children trying to be grown-ups, monkeys going through the motions of their elders... Then down even lower we go, to the arse-crawlers who’re legion... And, finally, to the quackers; they ought to just exist, like ducks in a pond: their lives have no more point or meaning...” The Mafia had made its entrance in the realm of Italian cinema in an openly unrealistic guise, in Pietro Germi’s In the Name of the Law (In nome della legge, 1949), a barely disguised Western set in Sicily and visually inspired by John Ford’s films, where Mafia men were “men of honor” who acted according to a rigid, unwritten code of rules. To the Northern Germi, Sicily was an idealized land, almost mythical: a source of impressive poetic images, but decidedly far from reality. How could Germi’s Mafia men, who quote Aristotle and preach loyalty, be compatible with those who just a couple of years earlier sent Salvatore Giuliano to shoot a crowd in cold blood at Portella della Ginestra? Following the example of Rosi’s Salvatore Giuliano, Damiani sweeps away the laughable distinction between “old” and “new” Mafia—with the former seen as a depositary of law and order—and depicts the progressive Americanization of Cosa Nostra, which becomes a replica of its overseas counterpart after the passage from the dominion of the country to that of the cities—here exemplified by the ambitious motorway which is being built with bad cement and bribes to politicians. Damiani visualizes the confrontation between the official authorities and their illegal counterparts through a striking visual idea (absent in the book), showing the two balconies on opposite sides of a square, where Nero and Cobb stay like two generals over a battlefield—or a chessboard, for that matter. From his observation post, each moves his own pawns: young widow Rosa (Claudia Cardinale), petty sneak Parrineddu (Serge Reggiani), hired killer Zecchinetta (Tano Cimarosa). Damiani’s direction is very precise, and shows a keen eye for frame composition: the director, a former painter, used to draw storyboards for every scene on set, and his preference for long sequence shots (such as in the scene where Nero visits Rosa’s house at night) gives the film a refined, classy look, aided by Tonino Delli Colli’s expert cinematography. According to assistant director Mino Giarda, the production received anonymous threatening letters while shooting in Sicily, and one day someone fired at the truck carrying the dailies (which were sent to Rome, printed and sent back to Partinico where Damiani shot most of the film). It’s no wonder: compared to the abstract, deterministic tone of Sciascia’s book—which was preserved in Petri’s We\n\nStill Kill the Old Way, sometimes at the film’s detriment—Damiani thrusts The Day of the Owl within Italy’s contemporary reality of electoral frauds and political connivance: “We always voted the way you wanted us to” says Rosa to Don Mariano. The scene—Damiani’s own idea—where Lee J. Cobb enters the local Democrazia Cristiana office, making an explicit reference to the complicity between Italy’s largest political party and the Mafia, raised a fuss during the film’s making. “They wanted to block the shooting” Giarda explains. “The police commissioner said “We can’t do that. I’m sorry but I have to ask for instructions from Palermo.” [...] Damiani replied that if he wasn’t allowed to shoot, he would hold a press conference on the very next day and denounce the situation. We had everyone against us—not only the Mafia, but the authorities as well.”5 The Day of the Owl was initially forbidden to minors by the Board of Censors: an absurd, arbitrary decision—officially motivated by the frequent use of foul language (mostly Sicilian dialectic expressions), its “harsh and corrosive criticism of institutions” and the lack of a happy ending— which was soon revoked in appeal after a couple of minimal dubbing alterations: Don Mariano’s “arse-crawlers” (pigliainculo in Italian, with a more explicit sexual innuendo) became “ruffians.” Besides Damiani’s powerful direction, one of the film’s main assets was its casting. Franco Nero, who in a couple of years had become a western movie star thanks to the success of Django (1966) and found international stardom with John Huston’s The Bible (1966) and Joshua Logan’s Camelot (1967), was persuaded to accept the role by his lover Vanessa Redgrave, who was familiar with Sciascia’s work: he injects a natural empathy in the role of Bellodi—inspired by the young Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, who would be murdered by the Mafia in 1982—making him a more likeable character compared to the novel. He and Damiani got on very well and would work again on a number of films in the following years. The same could not be said about Lee J. Cobb, whose acting affectations often irritated Damiani. As Nero recalls, during the final scene, where Cobb delivers the film’s most famous monologue about humanity, “after each line he handled his cigar, and took a long pause. And I saw Damiano behind the camera, clenching his huge boxer fists and whispering ‘Are you going to finish this damn dialogue or not?’”6 The film’s real revelation came from a colorful supporting actor discovered by Damiani’s assistant Mino Giarda. As Zecchinetta, the mustached, squat and diminitive Cimarosa—a postal clerk who had worked as an extra in a number of Franco and Ciccio films—brought an air of spontaneity to the film, ad-libbing many lines and portraying a down-to-earth, colorful hired killer (note the opening scene where the unseen hitman is waiting for his target, eating cheese and drinking wine behind a bush). The Day of the Owl grossed over one billion and three hundred million lire, becoming one of the season’s biggest successes in Italy. Damiani’s film paved the way for a subgenre about the Mafia— something which so many people back then pretended not to exist. Notes\n\n1.

Unjustly accused of the killing of an informant, Inspector Sterling is expelled from the police by his superior, Commissioner Donald. Determined to find out who framed him, Sterling becomes obsessed with his mission, even more so after his own son has been murdered so as to make him stop his investigations. He tracks down one of the two men who accused him through false testimony, Joseph Randolph, in a seedy hotel, but Randolph is killed when he’s about to confess. Sterling then tails a model, Janet, hoping that she leads him to the mysterious Charlie, who seems to be the mastermind behind all the murders. The other false witness, Rock, is also killed before he can talk, and the body supposedly of Charlie is found dead in the bay. Sterling is not convinced, though, and rightly so. After surviving another attempt at killing him, he catches up with Janet again and through her he eventually discovers Charlie’s real identity: Gary, Donald’s son. Emilio Miraglia’s Frame Up is exemplary of the situation of Italian film noir in the mid-sixties as opposed to the growing realistic urgency and urban hysteria of films like Lizzani’s Bandits in Milan. Titles like Miraglia’s film or Franco Prosperi’s The Professional Killer (Tecnica di un omicidio, 1966) and Every Man Is My Enemy (Qualcuno ha tradito, 1967) were hard-boiled flicks destined to foreign markets, starring American actors and heavily influenced by the new wave of American gangster films, darker and more violent, such as Sam Fuller’s Underworld U.S.A. (1961), William Asher’s Johnny Cool (1962), Don Siegel’s The Killers (1964). However, the rip-off was limited to absorbing the genre’s renewed iconography and stylistic traits, leaving untouched the more urgent themes (the breakdown of institutions, the collapse of urban structures, the rise of the underworld) that those films implied and underlined. As customary with Italian genre cinema, they also integrated elements from the whodunit and Hitchcockian thriller as well. As Brit critic Matt Blake noted, these films “seem to exist in an altogether different environment to the urban hysteria that populates\n\nproductions throughout the ’70s.”1\n\nItalian poster for Frame Up (1968).\n\nShot in San Francisco with a partly American cast, Frame Up is no exception. The hero’s pilgrimage through seedy hotels, topless bars, discos, skyline roofs and of course the obligatory climbs and descents of San Francisco streets and the iconic Golden Gate, is a parade of clichés as seen through the greedy, enthusiastic eyes of someone who comes from the periphery of the empire, and Miraglia’s direction overflows with wide-angle shots, nervous cuts, convoluted flashbacks. The only hint at irony is a scene where Beba Loncar exterminates a bunch of guys with a shot gun, which is revealed to be the shooting of a tv commercial for Levi’s. As with the previous year’s Assassination, Miraglia cast Henry Silva in the lead, and the actor’s impassive, stone-like face and square jaw perfectly epitomizes the idea of a world-weary, hardboiled cop. As one Italian critic wrote, “When Henry Silva smiles, it’s like a wound opens on his face,”2 so it’s not hard for him to portray a man who’s obsessed with vengeance and is alienated from his family even before his kid son is shot to death before his wife’s very eyes. “Everyone says you’re a skunk” his better half says, and we better believe her. Inspector Sterling predates ’70s tough cops in several ways: he’s a loner, is cross with his superiors, has his own debatable working methods (extorting a confession at gun point, for instance) as he feels his hands are tied by police procedures. “You reporters need your garbage, don’t you? You need headlines, policemen as killer, murders in cold blood...” he complains to a journalist played by Pier Paolo Capponi. “If crime goes up you say it’s the cop’s fault, he’s too soft ... but if for once a policeman gets a confession, you’re against it. There’s always someone to be sorry for in your articles, the criminal!” What’s really interesting about Miraglia’s film is that it circulated in two drastically different releases. The European edit (Frame Up) follows Sterling’s quest to find out who murdered his son and framed him for shooting an informant, and is characterized by a series of flashbacks showing the events that led up to the murders. About a hour in the film Sterling is shot on his door step but survives and eventually finds out who the killer is: the happy ending has him regaining his boss’ (Wynn) respect. The U.S. edit, distributed through Heritage Enterprises in 1971 and known as The Falling Man, runs eight minutes shorter, has the footage of Sterling being shot placed near the start of the film, and a plot which unfolds in quite a different way: after spotting a heist in progress, Sterling suffers the thugs’ wrath, as his son is killed and he is himself shot while walking back home. The whole film is structured as one long flashback, punctuated by footage of Silva falling down in slow motion (hence the title) to his death—somehow similar to Romolo Guerrieri’s The Double (1971). What’s more, the story has been arbitrarily altered so that it looks like Sterling has been killed by his own boss—all of which makes precious little sense. Other differences concern the dubbing (Keenan Wynn’s voice is re-dubbed in a New York accent in The Falling Man, while in the Euro version the actor dubbed himself) and Robby Poitevin’s beat-psychedelic score, replaced on The Falling Man by Marcel Lawler’s much inferior electronic music. Far from being a memorable film, Frame Up is worth seeing mainly because of Silva’s performance. After establishing himself as a reliable character actor in a number of films, plus the title villain in Johnny Cool, Silva moved to Italy with his family, accepting an Italian producer’s offer. During his\n\nItalian experience, the Brooklyn-born actor would become one of the “poliziottesco”’s emblematic faces, playing indifferently ruthless hitmen or violent cops in such films as Fernando di Leo’s The Italian Connection and Umberto Lenzi’s Almost Human.

Home video: UVI (VHS, Canada—Italian language) Elderly gangster Destil, just released from prison, plans one last job: robbing a case full of diamonds from a courier. He gathers a small gang, which includes a former shooting champion and an actress who attempted suicide. Destil’s friend, a cheat named Sempresì, promises he will get the money which is necessary to finance the job by playing cards, but he ends up in the hands of a rival gang whose leader Affatato loans him money in exchange for information on the hit. Destil’s plan seems to go smoothly: the plane on which the traveler is carrying the jewels lands at the Fiumicino airport on account of a fake bomb alarm, and the gangsters, dressed up as cops, take the case. When they return to their hideout, however, they find Affatato’s gang waiting for them. A shoot-out ensues, and only the actress and the shooting champion are left alive. They make a desperate escape attempt by car, but near the Yugoslavian border the man abandons his companion. Besides the sociological approach of Lizzani’s Bandits in Milan and the “American way” of Tessari’s The Bastard or Giuliano Montaldo’s Machine Gun McCain (1969), there is a third route to\n\nItalian crime cinema. That’s the case with Mino Guerrini’s Gangsters ’70. Guerrini was a former journalist who debuted behind the camera with an interesting modern-day Gothic starring Franco Nero, The Third Eye (Il terzo occhio (1966), later remade by Aristide Massaccesi / Joe D’Amato as Beyond the Darkness (Buio Omega, 1979). Guerrini’s following films were both scripted by Fernando di Leo: Date for a Murder (Omicidio per appuntamento, 1967), based on the novel Tempo di massacro (Massacre Time) by the prolific Sicilian writer Franco Enna,1 was a sardonic, at times almost experimental film noir, graced with a racy pop imagery and plenty of dark humor, starring Giorgio Ardisson, Italy’s answer to James Bond in Sergio Sollima’s Agent 3S3 films. The following year’s Gangsters ’70 was a much more serious affair. If Date for a Murder was colorful and crackling, Gangsters ’70 is desperate and painful—a far cry from the overall euphoria of 1960s Italian genre cinema. Guerrini and di Leo look at the French polar mythology of romantic failure, but also at the implacable narrative mechanism of John Huston’s The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and Stanley Kubrick’s The Killing (1956). Originally titled Elegia in un cimitero d’asfalto o Il sole nero (Elegy in an Asphalt Cemetery or Black Sun), and written by di Leo for an American producer, Gangsters ’70 puts together idiosyncratic gang of losers: an elderly gangster (Joseph Cotten) who is released from prison and plans one more hit, not realizing that times have changed and younger gangsters do not respect him anymore; a middle-aged card cheat (the great character actor Giampiero Albertini) who deludes himself about still being a poker ace; a drug-addicted shooting champion (Giulio Brogi) who even gives away his Olympic gold medal in exchange for a heroin dose; and a faded starlet who just attempted suicide (Franca Polesello) and who takes part of the heist, impersonating a hostess and luring a diamond courier into a trap, because it’s the only role she has been offered in a while. For all of them, the hit means a whole life’s redemption. It’s not just a matter of money, but a way to show to themselves they are still alive, and not to be forsaken by life and a world which goes much too fast: the title itself alludes to the following decade and to the rapidly changing underworld which is crushing and sweeping away old-style gangsters such as Destil. Di Leo and Guerrini insist on important themes: defeat, betrayal, dignity, the respect for oneself. Yet Gangsters ’70 conveys a pessimism which leaves no room for hope. The film’s nameless protagonists—they know each other by their often grotesque nicknames: “Mezzo Miliardo” (Half-a-billion), “Sempresì” (Always-yes), “Il Viaggiatore” (The Passenger)—aren’t too far from Gu in Melville’s Le Deuxième souffle or Jansen in Le Cercle rouge. Gangsters ’70 offers half a dozen memorable characters, including a cruel boss with voyeuristic and incestuous tendences (Bruno Corazzari) who looks like a blueprint for Di Leo’s subsequent villains. The style is much more controlled, although Guerrini doesn’t give up his favorite stylistic traits: nervous cuts, sequence shots, slow-motion bits and an inventive use of hand-held camera are put to best use, accompanied by Egisto Macchi’s remarkable experimental score: an impressive example of Guerrini’s technique has Albertini being trapped against a translucent metal wall and savagely beaten up in slow-motion to Macchi’s distorted piece of electronic music and assorted percussions. The first half has an erratic structure, with many detours from the main plot, such as Brogi’s meeting at the park with a drug dealer (played by Guerrini himself) who poses as a considerate father by carrying someone else’s little boy so as not to arouse suspicion, Brogi’s night wanderings while he’s in a cold turkey, or Cotten’s brief yet touching encounter with an old flame (Vivien Stapleton). The tighter\n\nsecond half is dominated by the lengthy, suspenseful hold-up at the airport and the subsequent showdown with the rival gang in a basement: the latter is a powerful, unpleasant and bloody sequence which features the kind of gory details—such as the blood-spattered features of a man who’s just been shot in the face—that had been introduced by Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and marks a neat departure from the kind of over-the-top yet gleefully sneering violence that characterized the Italian Western. Gangsters ’70 does not end with the massacre, though: Di Leo and Guerrini revive the plot by following Brogi and Polesello’s desperate escape to the border, through foggy roads and desolate winter landscapes, as if in some sort of road movie. It’s an unexpected, poignant coda which gives the story more depth and pathos, while stressing the makers’ original approach to the genre. However, Gangsters ’70 went unnoticed before critics and audiences alike. 1968 was the year of erotic thrillers with diabolical lovers and exponentially increasing naked skin. Guerrini’s film was soon forgotten and rediscovered much too late, towards the end of the ’90s. Yet it’s a fundamental work in the context of the Italian crime genre, not least because it paves the way for Fernando di Leo’s later work. Note\n\n1. Enna—real name Franco Cannarozzo—was an ecletic figure in the Italian literary world. A poet, novelist, playwright, in a forty-year career he wrote hundreds of works, signing them with an amazing number of pseudonyms.\n\n1969 Bootleggers (Cinque figli di cane) D: Alfio Caltabiano.
