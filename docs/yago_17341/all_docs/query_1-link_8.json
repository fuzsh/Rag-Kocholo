Westcott nurses him. When the group reaches the army post, it has been sacked and the defenders massacred. They are therefore forced to march to another post. Miles sends signals which bring the Indians. Madison and the men entrench them¬ selves, but the odds are too great. Lovejoy is sent to get reinforcements, and Miles accidentally gets killed. The cavalry arrives in time, while Madison makes his marriage proposal to Westcott. X-Ray: With Indians, soldiers, and the usual 3-D gimmicks, this should account for itself okeh in the current 3-D excite¬ ment. Otherwise, it is a routine outdoor show lacking in strong name values, with acting, direction, and production all ade¬ quate. James R. Webb wrote the screen play. Tip On Bidding: Better price because of 3-D. Ad Lines: “In Three Dimensions . . . ‘The Charge At Feather River’ “Over¬ flowing With 3-D Thrills”; “The Guard¬ house Brigade Holds Off A Whole Tribe Of Indians On The Warpath.” FOREIGN Cinderella Operatic Comedy (Cenerentola) 97 m. (Times) (Italian-made) (English titles) Estimate: Opera film may appeal to the art houses. Cast: Lori Randi, Gino Del Signore, Afro Poli, Vito De Taranto, Franca Tamantini, Enricho Formighi, with the voices of Fedora Barbieri and Fernanda Cadoni. Directed by Fernando Cerchio. Story: The two vain daughters of am¬ bitious Vito De Taranto are making themselves thoroughly obnoxious to their step-sister, Lori “Cinderella” Randi, servant for the family. Meanwhile, prince Gino Del Signore, out to find a wife, dis¬ guises himself as a footman while his actual footman, Afro Poli, poses as the prince in pursuit of a beautiful woman. The vain sisters put on all their charms to capture the supposed prince while they scorn the real nobleman. At the palace ball, the disguised footman carries on his flirtation with the two sisters. They balk, however, when he offers to give the hand of one of them to his supposed footman. Meanwhile, magician Enricho Formighi casts a charm upon Randi. Provided with the proper finery, she is the belle of the ball, and the supposed prince gives pursuit. However, she has eyes only for the foot¬ man. She leaves, unnoticed. The prince, still in the disguise of the footman, searches for her at the home of De Taranto, discovers her b| her scullery position, and offers her marriage. She accepts only to discover that he is the real prince. The evil sisters and ambitious father humble themselves, thereby put¬ ting themselves in the good graces again of the prince and princess. X-Ray: Based on the comic opera, “Cenerentola”, by Gioacchino Rossini, this opera film is fortunate in not having an offstage story to bog down the action, all of which should please music lovers. The tone of the music is light and humorous and in the typical staccato style of Rossini. It is played and sung by the orchestra and chorus of the Rome Opera Company with Oliviero De Fabritiis as musical director. Fedora Barbieri is the voice of Cinderella while Fernanda Cadoni sings “Tisbe.” The screen play is by Piero Ballerini, Angelo Besozzi, Fernando Cerchino, Fulvio Palmieri, and Aldo Rossi. Ad Lines: “Rossini’s Complete ‘Cene¬ rentola’ “Rossini’s Opera Based On The Famous Fairy Tale”; “A Musical Treat.” Home At Seven Melodrama 85m. (London) (English-made) Estimate: Fair import for the art houses. Cast: Ralph Richardson, Margaret Leighton, Jack Hawkins, Campbell Singer, Michael Shepley. Produced by Maurice Cowan; directed by Ralph Richardson. Story: Bank clerk Ralph Richardson returns one day as usual to find his wife, Margaret Leighton, in tears for he did not retutn home the previous evening. There is a lapse in his memory, which family physician Jack Hawkins is inclined to treat lightly. However, during Richard¬ son’s absence, strange happenings took place in the neighborhood. There was the theft of a sum of money and the murder of a club steward, who reported to the club president that Richardson had taken away the money. A suspect with a feeble alibi, Richardson is accused of both the theft and murder. He cannot remember his actions, and begins to believe his alleged guilt. However, a witness able to prove his whereabouts appears, and the capture of the murderer brings Richard¬ son’s clearance. X-Ray: This inexpensive English pro¬ duction sometimes seems to create sus¬ pense, but then falls upon its face. Rich¬ ardson’s performance is well done, while the others are adequate. The screen play is by Anatole de Grunwald. Ad Lines: “Murder Stepped In While His Mind Was A Blank”; “How Did He Spend Those Blank 24 Hours?”; “Was He Guilty Of Murder And Theft Which He Did Not Remember?” Keepers Of The Night Drama 108m. (Casino) (German-made) (English titles) Estimate: Good German religious drama. Cast: Luise Ullrich, Hans Nielsen, Rene Deltgen, Dieter Borsche, Kathe Haack, Angelika Voelkner, Gertud Eysoldt. Pro¬ duced by NDF/Filmaufbau; directed by Dr. Harald Braun. Story; Minister Hans Nielsen and his little daughter, Angelika Voelkner, arrive at a small town where he is to take charge of the local parish and act as chaplain in 'a sisterhood hospital. Nielsen meets young woman doctor Luise Ullrich, and she becomes a good friend. ‘Bfilrich’s own daughter has been killed during the war, and Ullrich consequently turned cynical toward religion. She cannot understand the quiet fervor that Nielson displays. Meanwhile, the Catholic priest in the town, Dieter Borsche, has gotten an act¬ ing troupe to appear in a production of “Everyrftan”, and the principal role is to be played by Rene Deltgen, the father of Ullrich’s child. Skeptic Deltgen scorns faith in God. Deltgen tries to win Ullrich back, but she makes it clear to him that the past is dead. Deltgen brings to the fore the fact that he fathered Ullrich’s child. The scandal results in her dis¬ missal. Deltgen takes the pastor’s daugh¬ ter to the fair, leaves her on the swings unattended, and she has a violent fall, Ullrich does all she can to save the child’s life, but she dies. Ullrich goes to comfort the disconsolate father, but she finds that his faith has enabled him to transcend the tragedy. She steps out of his life. X-Ray: This conflict between religious faith and resignation to life and scientific self-sufficiency makes up the meat of this drama of post-war Germany. Unusual acting from Ullrich and Nielsen lends prestige to the production and the direc¬ tion captures the atmosphere of the sur¬ roundings. This should make a suitable entry for the art houses. Ad Lines: “A Winner At The Venice Film Festival”; “A Drama Of Faith’s Triumph Over Tragedy”; “A Film Of Bit¬ ter Conflicts And Piercing Insights.” Biographical Man Of Music Drama with Music 100m. (Artkino) (Russian-made) (English titles) (Color by Magicolor) Estimate: Okeh Russian musical import. Cast: Boris Smirnov, Lyubov Orlova, L. Dunasov, G. Vitzin, K. Nasonov, I. Litovkin, L. Lubimov, A. Popov, Y. Yurovsky, S. Richter, B. Vinogradova, N. Korshunov, A. Sashin-Nikolsky, M. Nazvanov, I. Likso, P. Pavlenko, V. Savelyev. Produced by Mosfilm Studio; directed by Gregory Alexandrov. Story: Composer Boris “Mikhail Glinka” Smirnov, returning to his native Russia after a stay in Italy, is impressed by the spirit of the people and the power of the vast landscape. It is difficult for the composer to gain recognition among his contemporaries for ideas that he wants to express. Through the encouragement of his sister Lyubov Orlova, poet L. “Push¬ kin” Durasov, and R. “Franz Liszt” Richter, Glinka goes on to write his famous “Ivan Susanin.” The czar forced certain changes in the libretto in order that it might be more complimentary to the government, and the cafe society of the day scorns the peasant opera, but this did not discourage Glinka. He goes on to write “Russian And Ludmilla.” After a lifelong struggle for the new music, Smir¬ nov is advanced in years but happy in the thought that he has accomplished something for his life and his music. X-Ray: Mounted on Magicolor, this biography does not accomplish much dra¬ matically except perhaps present a eulogy to the memory of the composer. The pace is rather static, but the music might be of interest to music lovers. The screen play was written by P. Pavlenko, N. Treneva, and G. Alexandrov. Ad Lines: “The Magicolor Story Of The Life Of Composer Mikhail Glinka”; “A Musical Masterpiece”; “The Powerful Music Of ‘Ivan Susanin’ and ‘Russian And Ludmilla.” Sadko Drama-Fantasy 90m.

Leonidov, S. Martinson, L. Fenin, M. Astangov, S. Kayukov, O. Vikland, E. Myshkova, L. Vertinskaya. A Mosfilm production; directed by Alex¬ ander Ptushko. Story: Serge “Sadko” Stolyarov seeks to better the lot of the poor people, and this angers the merchants.

With the aid of a sea princess, he is enabled to angle the precious fish, but this does not bring happiness to the common people for everyone can not be provided for.
