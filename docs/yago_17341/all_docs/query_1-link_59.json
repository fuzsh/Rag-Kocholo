        "text": "With the highly successful \"La Cenerentola\" barely off the City Center's operatic boards, an Italian film version, labeled plain \"Cinderella,\" was unveiled yesterday at the Little Carnegie. From a production standpoint, at least, the Italians have accorded Rossini's comic masterpiece all that could be asked, in fine musicianship, handsome sets and a general adherence to the continuity and spirit of the original.Better still, a battery of five scenarists, through tactful pruning and the occasional inclusion of outdoor, naturalistic backgrounds, pluckily have tried to ease the Ferretti libretto out of a medium to which it remains perfectly suited. The same must be said for a reasonably camera-conscious director, Fernando Cerchio. Actually, this fanciful operatic re-telling of the traditional Perrault fairy tale shuffles the benighted heroine, her stepfather and stepsisters, the prince and his footman in enough bouncy intrigue to vibrate the camera.However, impersonally telescoped by such a demanding instrument, this screen opera can claim neither the frothy intimacy of its footlighted predecessor down the street nor the simple elasticity of, say, almost any unadorned Westernâ€”and we do mean horse opera.Lori Randi makes a beauteous, if buxom, heroine, with some splendid substitute vocalizing on the sound track by Fedora Barbieri. The others, who do their own singing, are equally personable and listenable, including Gino Del Signore, as the Prince; Vito De Taranto, as Don Magnifico; Franca Tamantini, as one of the predatory daughters, and particularly Afro Poli, as Dandini, the footman.\"Cinderella,\" like a host of predecessors, never bridges the gap between stage and screen. But as a neutral curio for the eyes, it still offers a treat for the cars.\n\nCINDERELLA, screen play by Piero Ballerini, Angelo Besozzi, Fernando Cerchio, Fulvio Palmieri and Aldo Rossi; adapted from the opera \"La Cenerentola,\" with libretto by Jacopo Ferretti and music by Gioacchino Rossini; presented here by Times Film Corporation, at the Little Carnegie.Cinderella . . . . .
