        "text": "It was 2016, and Lulu Wang was done with filmmaking. The then 33-year-old director already had one movie under her belt, 2014’s Posthumous, and another she was burning to make. But she was suffering a crisis of faith in the film industry she had worked so hard to be a part of. She knew she had a film in the personal tale of her Chinese family’s quest to keep her aging grandmother in the dark about her cancer diagnosis. The problem was no one else did.\n\nWhen Wang pitched her setup—a Chinese-American woman returns to her home country with the other expatriates in her family under the guise of a wedding, but with the true intent of seeing the family matriarch before she dies—she was met with a flood of criticism from both Chinese and American financiers: Who is this movie for? Chinese or American audiences? Why is it in Mandarin? Why isn’t your protagonist the bride in the wedding?\n\nAccording to Wang no one understood the story she was pitching about her internal conflict over lying to her grandmother, with whom she is still very close.\n\n“They wanted it to be my big, fat Chinese wedding,” said Wang of the investors on both sides of the world. “A very broad, ethnic comedy.”\n\nTo Wang, her story was nothing like that. It’s a tale of loss, a meditation on how to say goodbye, and an investigation into how different cultures handle illness and death. “To me, it’s a very American story because I’m American, and it’s just about me going back to a place where I don’t understand and I’m trying to understand,” she said.\n\nWhen we met on a late spring day in Los Angeles, Wang pulled up to the cafe on a mini Segway, embodying millennial chic in an oversized navy suit and bright yellow Vans. A writer and classical pianist by trade, Wang, who was born in Beijing and immigrated to Miami when she was six, first told her absurdist family drama as a short story and then as a podcast, in collaboration with This American Life and producer Neil Drumming. The result was a segment on an episode of the long-running radio series titled “In Defense of Ignorance” that debuted in April 2016.\n\nThe night it aired, Wang’s friend took her to a sushi bar to celebrate. Instead of toasting, Wang, who still desperately wanted to adapt her story for the big screen, burst into tears.\n\n“The experience of working with This American Life had been so amazing and so pure. This idea of being in a room with a mic and knowing that once I recorded, within the next three days, people all over the world would hear it,” she said. “That immediacy of storytelling reminded me why I became a storyteller in the first place. That direct connection. Films take so long to make. They take so much money, and I don’t fit in. Nobody wants to tell my story. They just want to put me in this box, and…unless I can do this kind of storytelling, it’s not worth it for me to do all that.”\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The podcast became a sensation with audiences and suddenly her personal story was just right for film. Producer Chris Weitz (About a Boy), who along with his brother, Paul, runs Depth of Field, the production company behind such films as Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist and A Single Man, was driving down the 10 freeway in Los Angeles with his wife, actress Mercedes Martinez, when the two happened upon Wang’s story.\n\n“I heard this extraordinary true story, this beautiful complete story. It’s really rare when you can think, Oh, this would make a perfect movie. I thought I might as well give it a try,” said Weitz, who was drawn to the conundrum at the center of the film, the notion that lying to a loved one can actually be a good thing. He also found the connection between Wang and her grandmother moving and was taken by the broader immigrant story she touched upon, the heartbreak of having to leave your family in pursuit of a better life.\n\nWeitz met with Wang. Within two weeks, with the help of another production company, Big Beach, The Farewell was financed and Wang was busy banging out a script.\n\nThe episode also gave her the high card and the courage to ask for everything she wanted.\n\n“It is ironic that films only get made now if they exist in another medium,” added Weitz. “It’s kind of an interesting insecurity in the film business right now…. When I come across people who have [original] stories they want to tell, they feel like they have to tell those stories in some other medium first in order to get any traction.”\n\nLast year, Wang headed to Changchun, China, and her grandmother’s neighborhood to tell her story. Awkwafina was cast as Billi, Wang’s avatar, while her own aunt Hong Lu played the aunt in the film, Little Nai Nai. Her grandmother, nicknamed Nai Nai, who today, at 86, is still alive, welcomed the visit, still in the dark about the real premise of the film.\n\n“It’s so meta,” said Wang with a laugh. The film shoot offered her an extended period of time with her grandmother, time in her neighborhood, where Wang would often find herself running up to her Nai Nai’s apartment to use the restroom, returning with armloads of snacks for the crew.\n\n“The lie has allowed me to spend so much time with my grandmother in China, shooting a movie…all kinds of scenarios that I never dreamed possible,” said Wang, who has made peace with her family’s orchestrated deception.\n\nWang is much more sanguine now about the film industry too. “I knew I had to make this film for me and anyone else who may be understood me,” she said. “I felt like if people don’t get it, but I made the film I set out to make, then I could be proud of it. But if I sort of compromised, and it didn’t do well, and I left the industry, I would forever regret it.”\n\nThe Farewell was a huge hit at Sundance, sparking a bidding war that ended with Wang turning down an additional $8 million from a streaming service to tie her wagon to A24, the film company behind Moonlight and Lady Bird. It will open in New York and Los Angeles on July 12.\n\nMeanwhile, Wang is currently working on a new film, an adaptation of the short story Children of the New World by Alexander Weinstein that takes place in the near future and, according to Wang, centers on questions of family and why we have children. Wang is writing the script now.\n\n“Every time I finish a film, it’s kind of depressing because you're kind of at the end but kind of at the beginning again, and you’re just excited but also unsure,” she said."
