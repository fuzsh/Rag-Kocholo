        "text": "Biografia ITA | > Biography ENG\n\nGIOVANNI FUSCO\n\nS.Agata dei Goti (Benevento) October 10th, 1906 – Rome, May 31st, 1968\n\nComposer, pianist, and conductor.\n\nAn eclectic and talented musician, he wrote about three hundred compositions, three plays, chamber music of sacred kind and, mostly, sound-tracks for feature films, short films, and documentaries.\n\nHis life, from his early childhood, was surrounded by a musical atmosphere. He was born in a large family, his father was Carlo Fusco (from S.Agata dei Goti) and his mother Maria Teresa Folena (from Lucca), he was the youngest of seven brothers, four of which were appreciated musicians. Lorenzo, the oldest, famous tenor, who had been fellow-student of Beniamino Gigli’s, was company with Ettore Petrolini.\n\nLorenzo, called Enzo, has been great interpreter of the Parthenopean lyric and of the famous patriotic song, as “The Legend of the Piave River”, and also the author of the very famous “Dicite ‘ncello vuje”.\n\nTarcisio, composer, pianist, and conductor, devoted himself to the world of variety show, and he has been one of the first musicians to devote himself to the connection between music and cinema, conducting orchestras during the showing of silent movies. Finally, Antonio and Romeo, violinist and percussionist, respectively.\n\nFor the young Giovanni, since his early childhood, the music is fashion in those days was very familiar: from the popular taste of the world of variety shows, to lyric songs.\n\nAt the age of six, his father took him to Rome, from his native region, Campania, to llow him to study. This decision was fundamental for his education; it allowed him to discover and develop his bright and natural musical attitude, through regular studies at the Liceo Musicale of S.Cecilia, where he studied piano under the supervision of P. Boccaccini. Since then, Rome became his adopted city, where he studied, worked, and spent his entire life. Here, when he is only nine, following his brother’s example, he plays the piano during the showing of silent movies, at the Sala Regia of Via Cola di Rienzo, and at the Cinema Corso, earning ten liras per evening. These were important movie theatres, which could afford to hire even an entire orchestra, but, at dinner time, the players used to take a break and a boy, wearing short pants, alone, used to comment with the music of his piano.\n\nThis fundamental experience, becomes his first experimental and forming site, which, in the future, will bring him to find a perfect fusion with the world of vision, keeping the integrity of the musical subject, according to its constructive logic; furthermore, updating and completing it through the addition of the most different contributions, to be considered, in the future, a “fundamental character” in the world of music for films. He also used to be, with Goffredo Petrassi and Ennio Francia, one of the singers of San Salvatore in Lauro’s.\n\nAfter his piano studies, where he graduated very successfully, his education continued at the Academy of Santa Cecilia, where he took organ lessons from Fernando Germani, composition lessons from Riccardo Storti and Alfredo Casella, and conducting lessons from Bernardino Molinari. In 1931, he graduates in composition from the Conservatorio of Pesaro and, in 1942, in conducting from the Conservatorio Santa Cecilia of Rome. Under the supervision of Alfredo Casella, he also improved his piano ability, these studies shared with Adriana Dante, pianist and inseparable companion of his life.\n\nDuring the years of Fusco’s youth, in the period between the two wars, the Italian music scene was going through an exciting reformation movement, due mostly to the “eighty’s generation”, which included Respighi, Pizzetti, Casella, Malipiero, and a certain number of less important authors. Certainly, Casella was the ensign of this renewal movement, which was hoping to elevate the Italian musical culture, trying to bring it inside a larger European scenery. Casella himself had all the talents of the composer, theoretic, and pianist, and he had deeply understood, clearer than his colleagues had, that the modification of the way of life of the human communities was also modifying the ways and the kinds of their sensorial perception. For Fusco, to meet this great artistic personality was very useful, either for the acquisition of the theoretic basis about the nature of the musician, based on humble and conscious handicraft, even though of a “superior handicraftsman”, like the great figures of the Renaissance, conscious of his function, and for the opening towards what was new, towards a world which was fastly changing, and that makes him, fearless, with audacity, try all kinds of new experiences and experimentations. From this maestro, Fusco will adopt, mostly, his courage and ability to retake other author’s styles, keeping unchanged, in their forms, a clear plasticity of the musical figurations, a deep iconicity, playing among polytonal solutions, rhythmic vibrations, rhythms taken from the most dissimilar musical kinds, such as Fox-Trott, Jazz, and the “consumption music” that, up to those days, had found the hostility of the official academic milieu, and also arriving to introduce some electronic experimentations.\n\nThe activity of this composer begins following the pre-established canons this profession requires, writing operas, sacred, symphonic, and chamber music. In the early ‘30s, he started to dedicate himself to composition, beginning a symphonic poem inspired to the freed Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1934, he starts to write the score for the three-act play by Luigi Chiarelli, La scala di seta, based on the libretto by Mario Casalino. From the same opera, in 1938, the symphonic piece Balletto was created, broadcast by EIAR, and for which he had several contracts.\n\nIn 1938, he set to music Via Nuvola 33, a musical play based on a libretto written by Enrico Bassano and Dario Martini.\n\nIn 1941, commissioned by RAI, he wrote the Sacred Oratory La cantata profetica, for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, from a text by Ennio Francia, inspired by Psalm 83, it was recorded at the Foro Italico and broadcast on the radio in 1955, conducted by another author. Then, L’ultimo venuto comes, one-act play in music by Dario Martini, commissioned by RAI again, and of this play a recording was made, conducted by Bruno Maderna.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, Maestro Fusco appeared several times, as conductor of concerts of contemporary music, dedicating him self also to the performance of jazz music in American clubs. His remarkable ability of playing at sight, was helping him in doing that; and, he was often proving it during the evenings spent with his musicians friends, where he used to perform for this audience, playing at sight, just printed, the musics by Stokausen or Stravinskij. Beginning these days, other important works deserve to be mentioned, as the Sonata a due, for violin and cello, the Suite Americana, for orchestra, the Sonata a tre, for violin, flute, and clarinet, the Psalm 112, for 4 soloist voices, 2 guitars, and jazz battery, dedicated to Goffredo Petrassi, the Suite for eight instruments, from the movie “Hiroshima mon amour”, the Fantasia da concerto, for violin and string instruments, the Piccolo concerto, for clarinet and orchestra, the Tam Tam of the Animals, for children’s voices and 5 instruments, the Canzone dell’uccellaio, for basso and orchestra, the Sinfonia Italiana, for orchestra, and the unpublished ballet La Rapina, on a subject written by Michelangelo Antonioni, commissioned by the Opera Theater “La Scala” in 1965, and never performed, because of the sudden death of the Maestro. La Rapina is the portrait of the inhabitants living in a neighbourhood outside a city, where the main characters of the ballet go through constant fights and quarrels: “which suddenly start and suddenly end”. Even in this ballet, music is responsible for the intimate expression, deeply plastic, of every represented reality: from the objective one to the one unspeakable of the characters involved.\n\nHis main activity, which kept him mostly engaged, was the composition of music for films.\n\nIn 1930, the sound movie is introduced in Italy with La canzone d’amore by Gennaro Righelli, with the musical contribution of Cesare Andrea Bixio. Only 6 years after this event, Fusco starts to work in the field of music for films, writing the sound-track for Il cammino degli eroi, a documentary by Corrado D’Errico, where, for the first time, disagreement and opposition elements to the ancient atmosphere of the “white telephones” appear. It is worth mentioning, among others, also the feature film Joe il rosso, by Raffaele Matarazzo, La contessa di Parma, by Alessandro Blasetti, Pazza di gioia, by C.L. Bragaglia, and Questi ragazzi, by Mario Mattioli; these, among the most significant directors of the first decade of the Italian sound movie.\n\nFor these works, the contribution of a really creative musician was not necessary, yet, but the first signs of those elements which, in the future, would have become the main musical characteristics of the innovating nature of Giovanni Fusco’s, could be identified, such as the introduction of dance music, popular instruments, intradiegetic music.\n\nSeveral are the musical advices and contributions that Fusco, in these years, gave to films based on typical comedies of the “white telephones” kind, composing, arranging, and re-writing some sound-tracks for foreign films, such as Duello al Sole.\n\nFusco’s poetic, still in its early stage, already underlined those stylistic-formal aspects, and a linguistic-musical syntax, which will be codified in a future and mature age, and that can be summarized as follows:\n\nEclecticism, can be found among the variety of his composing experiences, of all different kind, lived and fully written by our composer, which all finally end up in his main occupation: music for films. He was associated with “light music” clubs, writing “masters’ songs” (1) as the Ballata del suicidio on a text by Pier Paolo Pasolini for Laura Betti’s show Giro a vuoto, where only few fragmentary notes are accompanied by an obstinate rhythmic left hand of the piano. He practised in the so called “consumerism music” (2) , that kind of music so fashionable in the ‘50s, which we find, deeply adopted, also in his sound-tracks, Fox-Trott, Surf, Twist, Slow. He also took part in the production of radio programs and in the realization of advertisements.(3) As a conductor, he preferred contemporary music, but also moving in the past, and even performing experiences by Bach.\n\nEssentiality, reduction of the orchestra and of several instruments, sober, in fact reduced to the essential, with a mixture of sounds, sometimes unusual, of just few instruments and, often, adopting popular instruments: in Cronaca di un amore he makes use of saxophones and a piano; in I vinti, solo of stringed instruments; in La signora senza camelie, five saxophones and a piano; in Le amiche, two guitars and a piano; in L’avventura, a small group of wood instruments; in L’eclisse, brass instruments and a piano; in Deserto rosso, voice, song, and electronic music; in Gli sbandati, there is the adoption, extremely modern, of the stringed instruments; in I delfini, “short songs”, among which What a sky, solo for guitar and piano; in Gli indifferenti, solo for trumpet, strings, and piano; in Hiroshima, mon amour, flute, piccolo, piano, clarinet, viola, English horn, double-bass, and guitar. The use he makes of these instruments is often forced, going beyond their natural range of sounds. In this way, therefore, their timbre and registers are modified, making them sound almost like new instruments. Typical example of this way of operating is the percussive utilization of instruments, normally melodic, such as the piano.\n\n“Musical aphorism”, the adoption of the fragment in disfavour of the “Hollywood traditional thematism”, using the obstinate as “lietmotivica” (where the word leitmotiv is meant in a very strict Wagnerian way, like the elevation of the events to the sphere of their metaphysical meanings )(4). This way of composing, allows him to “atomize” his presence, without interrupting the musical line, and keeping, in this way, a kind of continuity, and leaving the opportunity to create, time after time, some very meaningful improvisations, and to resume, in any moment, the interrupted line. (5)\n\n“Semantic-Expressive Economy”. Fusco’s music doesn’t “visualize” or underline the images, as it used to happen in the tradition, but he creates the atmosphere, like a light which illuminates, or not, an environment, emphasizing its inner meaning, rather than its formal appearance; it isn’t descriptive, it doesn’t identify the situations, but it evokes some feelings, it is the inside voice or, if you prefer, some kind of psychological introduction, it tells us what, in other ways, we wouldn’t be able to hear; “it accomplishes the function to emotionally reinforce and to accompany the process of the inner talk”.(6) In general, “the pretension to make the music discreet doesn’t work in analogy with noise, but just with triviality”(7) in the specific case, Fusco succeeds in making extra-musical elements as “precipitated” of the music itself, as music may become something else alone, becoming symbol and archetype “sound soul” of the piece, and of the message the director wants to give. (8) A typical example, may be the most successful among the sound-tracks he wrote for Antonioni, is the one he created for L’avventura, where noises, sounds, are taken, elaborated, and integrated with the music, creating an evocative contribution to this director’s drama.\n\nCounterpoint, also adopting the tonal system and the styles of the classic ages, Fusco’s music succeeds in being modern and present. He takes the patterns and the forms and he breaks them, transforming them in archetypes, then putting them back together, in his language and style. Rather than the vertical and harmonic aspect, he prefers the horizontal one, melodic and polyphonic, with several voices which counterpoint. He renews and tears off the aggregations of tunes, till they become pure sound, “colour” and also largely adopting dissonance. It is not by chance that the composers he prefers, and he takes important composition ideas from, are: Frescobaldi, Bach, Pergolesi, Bartòk, and Stravinskij.\n\nImmediately after the war, the documentary becomes the most immediate means the new generation, stimulated by the power of the events, has to show its opposition and finally, destroy that idyllic atmosphere, in striking contrast with the new age of life of the “white telephones”. Already in 1942, the documentary Comacchio, by the director Fernando Cerchio, with music by Fusco, gives a warning sign of this sense of discomfort, with the movement, slow and relentless, of rhythms in their fusion and in their blending in the contrast between white and black, which will be developed in a clearer way, always through the documentary, by other directors, soon after the war. It is in this period that the person of Giovanni Fusco’s shows himself in all his potential, not only as long experienced musician, talented with that fresh attitude for changes, which makes him the best collaborator and sure reference for the new generations, but also as generous patron. Fusco was also active in the world of business. He founded, with Venturini and Messeri, the FILMS, a production company specialized in documentaries, which had also the ambition to create and produce “musical films”, this last goal soon abandoned, This idea was reconsidered, about 10 years later, when he created the CINELIRICA, where he produced the musical films “Lajo nell’imbarazzo” by G. Donizetti, “La traviata” by G. Verdi and “La Rita” by Donizetti. Besides the revision of the scores, which he was personally making, in some cases he was also responsible for the direction , which he used to sign using the assumed name of Vasco Ugo Finni, or John Welman, this last one created by Carlo Belli, writer and chief editorial of the Tempo’s. It was an extraordinary opportunity that the maestro put at disposal of young generations of singers and movie directors, and that allowed him, using his encouragement, to witness to the beginning of the most promising directors on the Italian movie scenery: Michelangelo Antonioni, to begin with.\n\nThe prolific meeting with Michelangelo Antonioni dates 1948, when they work together for the documentary signed by this director N.U. Nettezza Urbana, located along the streets of Rome, and which sees the maestro also in charge of its production. Fusco had already signed over 40 sound-tracks, including documentaries and feature films, but his meeting with Antonioni is fundamental for his career. By the side of an educated and rigorous author, with also a fine taste for music, Fusco was spurred to consider cinema the location where to wake up, inside himself, the old Casella’s heritage for heavy loads having creative nature, able to transform the character of the composition of music for films from artisan work to an artistic duty, having its own inside value.\n\nThe cooperation between Antonioni and Fusco has not been only an artistic cooperation, a cooperation between two artists; it has mostly been a deep and sincere strong friendship, with daily meetings, consideration, successful intuitions, and disputes between two personalities that, even though so different, would perceive one another’s strong possibilities to carry out their expressive beliefs.\n\nAntonioni has been, for Fusco, the perfect incentive, the one who pushed him towards an inside reflection and the personal research in matter of films; for Antonioni, Fusco represents his idea of music for films, which consists in dissolving the pretextuous music language, trying to amplify the extreme ranges of feelings, till they become just a “voice” that “while it’s doing it, nobody talks.”\n\nThe musical realization-interpretation by Fusco’s, of Antonioni’s ideas, continues with the documentaries, Superstizione, Sette canne e un vestito, and L’amorosa menzogna of 1949. In 1950, with La villa dei mostri, there is their last cooperation concerning documentaries, and the production of the first feature film, Cronaca di un amore, which allowed the author to win the Silver Ribbon Award for the best music. Leaving apart the usual conventions, Fusco’s music concentrates itself on single instruments or on small groups, having a nature more of chamber music rather than symphonic, to allow the lonely timbres to be defined, progressively tearing them off, till they become pure and essential sounds, connecting them to situations, to atmospheres, and to the conscience of the characters and of the plot, till they inextricably adhere.\n\nAll that, was making Fusco, already rigorous and demanding with himself, in the position to hire exceptional players, like the great French saxophone player Marcel Mule, accompanied on the piano by Armando Renzi, for the interpretation of the piece, for sax and orchestra, for Cronaca di un amore. Another fantastic example is the adoption of five saxophones, the “Paris Quintet”, conducted by Mule, for La signra senza camelie (1953), which performs as if it were only one instrument.\n\nIn I Vinti (1952), the environment is the setting for the action, in a way to make the director deal, in different ways, with the help of music, with photography and acting. Not by chance, Fusco adopts instruments of clear national nature, like the mandolin, the piano, and the accordion, in a very unheard of, anti-popular way. With this movie, music will stop during the most dramatic moments. For Le amiche, (1955), the musician looks for and creates new armonic solutions, characterized by a solid rhythmic heterogenecity, through the counterpoint between\n\na guitar, (played by Libero Tosoni), and a piano (played by Armando Trovaioli) with flashes by single instruments.\n\nThe score for Grido (1957), written for piano solo, is performed in an incomparable way by the piano player Lya De Barberis. The score is based, mainly, on the elaboration of two pieces, having different character. The diversified sequence of five themes (showing a certain similarity to Ravel’s themes and to melodies from the piano sonatas by Chopin), developed in the weak rotation of a dreaming and melancholy Andantino, almost scholastic, and a Valzer moderato, sharper, with its characteristics slightly modified. Both themes, seem to come from nature, from the outside world, from the fields, from the river banks, from the fog of a scenery which is the tragic portrait of the characters.\n\nIn L’Avventura (1960), the architectural design of the film, based more on the aesthetic beauty of the images, rather than on the refinement of words, is ignored by the music, which becomes sort of metaphysic language of the soul.\n\nThe sound-track follows the mood and the emotions of the characters, thanks to a sharp and anxious score, with rarefied and unusual timbres, based, mostly, on a concertino of wood and wind instruments, differently combined. There is also room for an unusual mandolin and guitar little orchestra, where jazz memories, pop, and from the Bolero by Ravel, can be recognized. Music, constantly going through rarefaction, becomes a lament and essence of the soul. Silver Ribbon award for the best music.\n\nIn Eclisse (1962), the comment adopts sonorous, dissonant fragments, having a metal effect, and ending with nothing concluded, or definitive. For this score, Fusco hires two exceptional artists: the singer Mina, who performs the twist having the same title, and the Maestro Franco Ferrara, engaged to conduct the music of the film.\n\nIn Deserto Rosso (1964), the tendency to the “mechanicalism” of music, to its abstraction, is taken further ahead, when Antonioni calls Gelmetti, who, using fragments from his own compositions continues, so to say, the massive presence of noises from refineries, cars, anchored ships; objects, once again, are more important than feelings. In contrast to that, there is just Fusco’s intervention, which basically consists of a “wordless song” , a long vocalism for female voice (performed by the composer’s daughter, Soprano Cecilia Fusco), who supports the sequence of fable-dream. Deserto rosso, awarded with the Leone d’Oro at the XXVth Mostra d’Arte Cinematografica of Venice, is considered, by the world movie criticism, among the best movies produced in the world. With this film, the cooperation between Antonioni and Fusco comes to an end; a rare example of creative osmosis."
