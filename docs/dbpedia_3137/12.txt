You might have missed it at retail, so here’s your second chance: Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ is hitting the Nintendo shop for DSiWare next week in North America.

Yup, this is the same on-rails shooter game that was released in stores in 2008. It’s a ridiculous premise, with players either taking control of a gun-toting Riding Hood or a ninja birthed from a gigantic peach. (Yeah, I know, right?) With your help, they’ll kill zombies and other baddies across 21 levels, including 10 massive boss battles.

As a concept, this game can’t lose. And from what I recall having played of it, its solid visuals and gameplay made up for the lack of variety. Anyone else have more experience with the game and willing to vouch for it?
