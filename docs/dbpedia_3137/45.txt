There are some games that simply have to be seen to be believed. "Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ" for the Nintendo DS is definitely one of them.

The concept alone is ludicrous enough to out-weird even the most outlandish of B-grade cult classic enthusiasts, but Spanish developer EnjoyUp delivers a surprisingly fun adventure at a very low price.

The game takes place after Little Red Riding Hood has saved her grandmother from the clutches of the Big Bad Wolf. Unfortunately, the Woodsman didn't make it. As depicted in the opening sequence, the Woodsman doesn't stay dead for very long. A zombie plague is spreading across Fairy Tale Land, and only Little Red Riding Hood can stop it.

"Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ" is a simple rail shooter at its core. Your character remains at the bottom of the screen throughout the duration of the game. As either Red or the mysterious ninja Momotaro, you shoot down hordes of monsters with your arsenal of weapons.

All of the sprites are rendered with a strong Japanese anime influence. Both outlandish and a bit ghoulish, the game's graphics take advantage of the outright zaniness of its concept and take it to the extreme. Each boss attacks your character in quirky ways that are an inside joke to those who are familiar with the fairy tales the characters are from.

Delightfully fun as it is, "Zombie BBQ" is far from perfect. The variety of enemies begins to get stale after a while, and your choice of weapons are limited and fairly ineffective for the most part.

The game also suffers from the occasional glitchy lag.

But when all's said and done, "Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ" is a charming little insane shooter that, at $19.99, won't make a big dent in your wallet.
