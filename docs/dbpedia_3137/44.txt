American McGee Shows Off Little Red Riding Hood Concept

American McGee posted this concept image, painted by two artists from the veteran developer's Spicy Horse studio in Shanghai, on his Flickr account to share a game idea he's hoping to sell: Little Red Riding Hood with an axe thirsting for wolf blood.

"[The artwork] depicts a scene from a game concept I'll be pitching at this year's GDC," explains McGee. "If we're lucky, an interested publisher will help us move it into production. It's an idea that [Spicy Horse art director] Ken Wong and I have been toying with for years."

This isn't the first time the Alice developer has thought of featuring Red in a video game; his 2008 episodic PC game, American McGee's Grimm, featured a chapter devoted to the fairy tale character. She's also appeared in several other video games in recent years, such as The Path, Fairytale Fights, and Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ.

The original Grimm game was also made into a comic book, by the way, American McGee's Grimm. The game itself is available on GameTap with several packs. Here's a link to The Girl Without Hands, for example.
