        "text": "If the sick and twisted normally appeals to you, you'll no doubt be following news of Gammick Entertainment's latest DS game closely.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ promises to be the most warped thing since Dementium: The Ward, and certainly a good remedy to all those puppy and fashion games the DS seems increasingly overrun with.\n\nSo the corrupt of mind will no doubt be interested to catch up with the latest on the game, which is due out later this year. First, then, there's a whole load of new screenshots (above). And second, a website for the game has now launched, which you can check out here.\n\nAs Gammick's press release says, visit the site and you can find out why Granny has become a horrible green monster and Pinocchio is now a blood thirsty cyborg. And that's just the start of things.\n\nPossessing an unnatural desire for blood and gore, we're certainly looking forward to it. Besides, any game whose promotional video begins with the line, \"Once upon a time fairytale creatures dwelt in their fantastic landâ€¦ till the zombies came to eat out their brains\" is guaranteed to get our attention.\n\nAnyone blessed with a similarly dark sense of humour should click 'Track It!' to be kept up to date on what should be a right blast."
