        "text": "When Spanish publisher Gammick Entertainment released first details on its upcoming twisted fairytale Zombie BBQ a few weeks back, it told us about one of the game's playable characters, Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nNow it's revealed there will also be a second playable character in the game in the form of Momotaro the Peach Boy - a well known character in Japanese folklore - who was apparently born from a giant peach (hence the name).\n\nLike all the other game characters though, Momotaro isn't portrayed in a traditional way. After all, Little Red Riding Hood carries a machine gun, which we can't remember from any Ladybird books. Similarly Pinocchio wants to be a zombie boy. There's not much in this game you'll remember from the bedtime stories your parents read to you.\n\nSo, in keeping with rest of the overall theme, Momotaro has sharp ninja skills as well as deadly ninja stars to throw at various zombified fairytale legends. He can also snatch weapons such as a laser rifle, flame-thrower and sawn-off shotgun from the cold dead hands of his defeated enemies to gun down enemies such as the ferocious Granny and undead Gretel.\n\nFrankly it's sounds twisted enough to make us wonder if someone on the Enjoy Up's development team might have been busy pulling the wings off flies and developing a sociopathic personality instead of riding his tricycle as a child.\n\nZombie BBQ is due for release towards the end of this year."
