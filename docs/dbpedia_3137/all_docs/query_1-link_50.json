I remember that one!\n\nIt's a little more mainstream but Space Channel 5 is certainly a wacky game. Part 2 is the best one\n\nooo! yeah ive heard of space channel 5 but i havent played it myself really! ive seen a little bit of it and it does seem like a fun wacky game i gotta! try it out someday! i wanted to give chulip as an example since i love that game a lot and! also it has a lot of fun weird aspects!\n\nSince you brought up LSD: Dream Emulator, I think anything by Osamu Sato would probably be up your alley. Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong Nou is a very strange, creepy point and click game done by him. Seaman for the Sega Dreamcast also comes to mind, which is relevant to this site because it's a very strange virtual pet game lol.\n\nI think something you might find interesting is Garage Bad Dream Adventure. It was lost media for 20 years, I believe, because the original release was only physical in Japan. At some point, an official english mobile version was made, although some parts are censored and changed, so I wouldn't recommend it if you want a faithful experience. There is a fan translation made of the original, that I found on internet archive. Some of the UI isn't translated, so it wasn't very easy to play. The best version, in my opinion, is the steam release. It's an official english translation, and it has been updated to include multiple endings and a more complex storyline. It's a point n click adventure game. I'd recommend it!\n\nA forewarning though, there are some NSFW themes, although it's from an artistic standpoint. It also has a pretty spooky atmosphere."
