        "text": "We'd say we're a bit old for fairytales now, but a 'scarytale' – that sounds a bit more interesting than fables about frogs turning into princes. And that's the word used to describe upcoming DS game Zombie BBQ, which you have to give kudos to for the title alone. It sounds brilliant already.\n\nAdd to the title the bonkers description from the game's publisher, Gammick Entertainment, and you've got quite a game. The run-and-gun shooter apparently begins with the invasion of a fairy tale land by hordes of ravenous zombies.\n\nLike the complete parallel to Disney's recent feelgood love film set in a fairy tale world, Enchanted, this has zombies tucking into the Three Little Pigs' little legs and the sawdust brain of Pinocchio (it's okay children, he's just a puppet) in a world where Prince Charmings have begun waking up Sleeping Beauties with real love bites.\n\nOne heroine can stop this madness and that's Red. As in Little Red Riding Hood who's apparently armed and dangerous – not entirely as we remember her in the books our mums read us as children.\n\nThe game was announced last month, but its publisher has today confirmed the studio which will be developing the game: Chronos Twins makers Spanish studio Enjoy Up. Chronos Twins was actually an enjoyable and certainly original title that only fell a bit flat because of a crazy difficulty curve. With any luck, the developer's second stab at a DS game could be even more successful.\n\nLittle is known about how Zombie BBQ will actually play, just that objectives include destroying hordes of zombies by stylus tapping the DS touchscreen. No doubt more information will be available nearer to the game's release in October. In the meantime try to keep nightmares about psychotic princesses and blood-sucking princes between now and its release to a minimum, eh kids?"
