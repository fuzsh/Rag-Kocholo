And they won't stop at anything: form the succulent legs of ham of the Three Little Pigs to the sawdust brain of Pinocchio; they are all tasty morsels for the living dead. Grotesque aberrations plague the enchanted forests. Only one heroine can stop this babbling army. Her name is Little Red Riding Hood, and now she's armed and dangerous!\n\nCan you save fairy tale land or will you let its creatures live an unhappy-ever-after-life?"
