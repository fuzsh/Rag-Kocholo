        "text": "Dark Fairy Tales\n\nGames that look at the darker side of fairy tales. American McGee's Alice is an excellent example of one.\n\nExploding Barrel\n\nAn environmental hazard that can be exploited to inflict massive areal damage, exploding barrels are one of the most ubiquitous objects to be found in games. The most common methods of ignition include shooting and throwing. Exploding barrels are usually distinguished from the non-exploding kind by a conspicuous red tint.\n\nHealth\n\nHealth is a value that gauges how much damage players can take in a game before they die or pass out. Also known as life in some games. Health is usually represented by a bar or a percentage instead of an exact amount. Found in most non sport games\n\nSexualized Women\n\nFemale characters who are designed with highly idealized figures and proportions, outfits that are revealing and/or form-fitting, and prone to ending up in completely over-the-top poses designed to show off their bodies.\n\nUndead\n\nThe Undead is an umbrella term describing creatures that do not exhibit the key fundamental attributes that are associated with life, such as respiration, and blood circulation. They are divided into two main categories: Ethereal and Corporeal, depending on whether or not they have a body.\n\nVertical Scrolling\n\nVertical scrolling is when the screen scrolls along the y-axis. In a vertical scrolling game the player usually starts from the bottom of the screen and moves up. They are also almost always presented in a top-down perspective.\n\nZombie\n\nZombies, more accurately called the walking dead, are reanimated corpses who feed on the living, and have become a ubiquitous video game enemy. They often move slowly, but can be deadly in large numbers, which is unfortunately how they tend to travel. Shotgun time!"
