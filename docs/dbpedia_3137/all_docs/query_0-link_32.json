It seems like to me that there is a lot of fluff and filler in the review and quite frankly it makes you look like a terrible reviewer.\n\nAlso how can forgettable music be the only con if you said this \" You change weapons by tapping an unfortunately-placed icon on the screen, that is frequently hit accidentally in the midst of all the action.\" that to me sounds like a bad design flaw and in your lastability section you pretty much said that this game is a one trick pony.\n\nHorrid review, the review looks lazily written,sloppy and unfinished that barely talks about the game with bad attempt at a joke in the opening.

The Grimm Brothers just cleaned up a lot of these medieval stories into stories of virginity and girls being confronted by male sexuality (the wolf) according too Victorian standards.\n\nYou should read diaries of convents with only men...you'll be surpised how \"gay\" the original and medieval christians were in comparison to our standards(here's a hint: very).\n\nWell, LRRH was original a story with medieval roots and actually had great sexual undertone which vivid descriptions of little red and the wolf doing it.

Using the touchscreen to control a shmup is a horrible idea. I had the same reaction to Animal Boxing. Developers need to think about touch screen usage before implementing it.\n\nI was very interested in this game until I found it at a Gmaestop and read the manual.
