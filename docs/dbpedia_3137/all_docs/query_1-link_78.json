        "text": "Honestly PS1 prices have dropped. Compared to like 8 years ago. I use to sell FF7 $60 all day, Now it's a $20 game, virtual console did that. I remember having 5 or 6 FF7 at one time, yard sales were good to me lol.\n\nTron Bonne has dropped even from last year. Tomba use to hit $80 all day. Intelligent Qube use to be a $90 game, now it's not even half that. I'm just glad I never really forked out a ton of $$ on my collection. I just let it sit and don't care too much about value....until it gets stupid high like nes and then I start selling it LOL.\n\nI was collector conscious by the time I got my DS, and I had an eye for some of the rare titles. Glad to see Retro Game Challenge made your list. That's one of my favorite DS games! Wish we got the sequel.\n\nI should go back through my DS collection. I haven't done that in a while. I know I have some rare ones, including one of the Fire Emblem games still sealed.\n\nAnother one I bought that I figured would be worth bucks now was Bangai-O Spirits. It's still sealed, too. Valued at around $13 on PriceCharting right now.\n\nI made the huge mistake in selling 75% of my PS1 (and most of my PS2) games about 10-12 years ago and almost all were what is now considered \"stupid expensive\". I finally got a CIB Suikoden II, III, IV, V, all 5 WildARMs, and some Tales games back. My surprise? Suikoden II is still stupid expensive but most of the other stuff isn't.\n\nEinhander was awesome and remains #3 on my top space shooters list begins Nemesis and Gradius III.\n\nMy PS1 collection has grown quite a lot since then but prices have dropped a ton in the last 5-7 years. Final Fantasy Tactics is super cheap now compared to the almost $90 price tag for the black label version back then. Get the PS1 games now while you can because I think the prices will go back up again.\n\nI have Adventures of Lomax. Given that I almost exclusively collect from Goodwill, you can imagine my shock when I discovered I'd just bought a 120 dollar game for just 1.\n\nIt's the most valuable game in my collection, and I found it on a fluke. Crazy enough, it happened less than 2 years ago.\n\nMy second most valuable ps1 game is Clock tower, followed by the longbox version of Silverload.\n\nEdited July 23, 2017 by Lendorien\n\nIt's not extremely expensive (especially by JRPG and shooter standards), but I was surprised last night to see that Colin McRae 2.0 for the PS1 seems to be a $50 game these days. Must be close to being the most expensive racer on the platform.\n\nI've wanted it for years, but always thought it was a $10 game or so. Even though the original managed to be a hit in North America despite rally racing being such a niche here, the PS2 launch must've held this one back from equaling that success (It released in early December, the same year that the PS2 appeared).\n\nAt $50 though, I'll have to think this one over a bit before buying it (Such as checking out the Japanese version on YouTube that is cheap to import first, to see if there's an English navigator option).\n\nEdited September 15, 2017 by Atariboy\n\nI rented Vanark, Ray Tracers, and Einhander from a video store back in the 90's and enjoyed all three immensely (I played and beat the 1st two over a couple days). I also remember enjoying a couple demo discs with the rare games Intelligent Cube and Tail Concerto.\n\nI've managed to find Ray Tracers for around $11 at a local game store within the past couple years... and one day about a year ago a sales clerk at a local game store asked me if I was looking for anything in particular, to which I responded that I'd love to get Einhander for a reasonable price. In fact I said something about how it'd be great if they had it as a disc-only game so it'd be more affordable.\n\nThe guy said- let me look, and within seconds raises up a disc from behind the counter and says, we have that. I tried not to let my eyes bug outta my head and said that I'd like to have it for twenty dollars. He agreed on the amount I offered and I had an incredible find that day\n\nNow, if only I could get Intelligent Cube or any of the others I mentioned that way... Well, Probably not. But I'm happy with what I do have!\n\n^^^^ It sounds like you only want the games to play. Ever consider just getting a modded ps1 and burning the games?\n\nI have intelligent Qube it's one of my fav. games. I purchased that many years ago. Another of my favorites is Zanac x Zanac which is an import I purchased off this site many years ago when I first joined. I have never played it (other than to test) though LOL. I have a burned copy I play. I do not play my rare disc based games for fear of scratching them.\n\nIf you absolutely have to have physical games, then picking up the Japanese versions of some of these titles is another way to go. Einhander cost me just under $30 after shipping from Japan this Summer, CIB. Intelligent Qube, $10, CIB. Lots of good stuff that would normally be expensive over here in North America is still reasonable for the Japanese versions.\n\nYou can either mod a PS1 or buy a Japanese system (I personally have a Japanese PS2, makes life easier and opens up my import options). The nice thing about this is that it also opens you up to other options that never released here.\n\nYou can still get okay prices on stuff, if you're willing to wait or don't jump at the first BIN you see. I lost out on an auction for Suzuki Bakuhatsu the other day*, which generally goes for around forty or fifty bucks (or more if you're not careful)... but another copy came up a couple of days later for 20 bucks plus shipping. Patience and keeping an eye out are still the keys to not getting price roasted.\n\n*which I had been dying to play since I read about it on Hardcore Gaming 101 a while back. It's a great game where you constantly have to defuse bombs hidden in various everyday objects"
