        "text": "Genre: On-Rails Shooter\n\nDeveloper: EnjoyUp\n\nPublisher: Destineer\n\nESRB: T\n\nReleased: October 21, 2008\n\nInfo:\n\nThis is one of those games that you may have seen on store shelves and laughed at, simply at the absurdity of the title and premise alone. What you may not know is that underneath the absurdity lies a pretty good game that was overlooked.\n\nThe premise of the game is that zombies are killing stuff so you have to kill them back and find out why they are killing things. Basically, a lot of killing. You can play as Little Red, who isn’t too little anymore, or as Momotaro, the hero of Japanese folklore who was born of a peach. Depending on which character you start with, you will have a slightly different opening sequence, but other than that the differences are aesthetic, with Red wielding a machine gun in combat, and Momotaro utilizing a shuriken shooter.\n\nOnce you have selected your difficulty (Hard is recommended, since you don’t get the true ending if you beat it on Normal) you are thrust into the game. Along the bottom screen, you can move your chosen character on a y-axis with the d-pad or y and a buttons depending on your dominant hand. Alternatively, you can move by tapping the square on the line you want as well. As the zombies, or various other ghoulish enemies, approach you, you will target them with the stylus. With your basic weapon, you are allotted an infinite amount of ammo, as long as you “reload” by removing your stylus from the screen for an instant. As you mow down the enemies while consistently moving forward on the rail-like courses, only stopping on rare occasions, you will accumulate various power ups, from a shotgun, to a flamethrower, and even a heavily damaging laser. If none of these work, you can throw a grenade in the hopes to blow the zombies to pieces.\n\nAt the end of the stage, a large boss based on a fairy tale character is waiting. Some of these battles can be very challenging, but just seeing what comes next is a morbid sort of treat. Disfigured, zombified versions of Gretel (Of ‘Hansel and’ fame), Sleeping Beauty, and even Santa Claus will square against you in battle, often times taking up an entire screen on their own.\n\nA flattering image of the lovely Sleeping Beauty.\n\nThe gameplay is a little slow, but in some areas, it feels just right. When there are a large group of enemies in screen and you are trying to toast them all with a flamethrower while barrels are exploding, there is a good bit of slowdown, which is unfortunate. One of Spanish developer EnjoyUp’s few games, it really is pretty solid for a small game company. The game could be beaten fully in a weekend, but there are a couple extra modes to extend the games’ life.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe environments and bosses are in nice 3D, and the attacks and explosions all look pretty nice. Red and Momotaro, as well as most of the enemies are sprites, but they move very fluidly and don’t seem to detract anything from the game.\n\nMomotaro blasts a creepy doll.\n\nSound:\n\nAn interesting rock-like soundtrack is horribly disfigured with the sound of constant zombie moaning and slaying. Not really worth a listen, since you probably won’t get a chance to."
