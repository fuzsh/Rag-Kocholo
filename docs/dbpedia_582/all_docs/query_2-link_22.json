        "text": "Vision\n\nWe seek to understand our interconnected world, past and present, at the local, regional, and global levels. The program draws upon scholarly approaches from across the humanities and social sciences and remains open to innovative and diverse epistemologies. We embrace the mindset of learning from the rest of the world and assessing our position in it, as we interpret and respond to the upheavals of the twenty-first century, such as climate change, forced migration, global inequalities, public health challenges, technological revolutions, and uneven development.\n\nMission\n\nOur program encourages students to be responsible and reflective global citizens by enrolling in courses across disciplines, acquiring languages, studying abroad, and cultivating open-mindedness to new ideas, all while remaining conscious of opportunities to learn about the world at home. Global Studies prepares students to think critically and creatively about the world and to connect the local with the global through research, service, and civic engagement.\n\nOur Program\n\nIn Global Studies, you are encouraged to cross the traditional borders of academic disciplines in order to develop a broader understanding of our world. Within six concentrations, you can take classes in anthropology, economics, history, languages and literatures, political science, among other disciplines to question global processes and explore the rich diversity of other cultures. As a major in the program, you have the opportunity to study abroad, conduct research and achieve proficiency in a modern language. You learn from experts in both the humanities and social sciences who will help you learn the theory and vocabulary you need to engage in key international issues across different world regions.\n\nOur Program History"
