Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMichinomiya Hirohito, posthumously known as Showa, was the longest-reigning monarch in the history of Japan, holding the throne from 1926 until his death in 1989. Emperor Hirohito was a controversial figure who took over Japan during a rising democratic sentiment, but he eventually turned it into an ultra-nationalist, militant country. He was also involved in World War II.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Emperor Hirohito or alternatively, you can download our 21-page Emperor Hirohito worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nOn April 29, 1901, Hirohito was born in the Aoyama Palace in Tokyo, Japan, during the reign of his grandfather. The reign of his grandfather was known as the Meiji Period, and it was a transformative time in Japan. His father was Crown Prince Yoshihito (later Emperor Taisho), and his mother was Princess Sadako (later Empress Teimei).\n\nAs part of the custom of the royal palace, Hirohito was raised by another family. At the age of seven, he was given an imperial education at the Gakushuin School, which was a special school for Japanese nobility.\n\nHirohito’s grandfather died when he was eleven, making his father the new emperor and making him the crown prince.\n\nIn 1921, he visited Europe, including France, Italy, and Great Britain, making him the first crown prince of Japan to ever travel abroad.\n\nAfter his trip to Europe, Hirohito learned that his father was sick, which granted him the leadership of Japan. He was eventually called the Regent of Japan and ruled as Regent until his father died in 1926.\n\nOn January 26, 1924, he married Princess Nagako (later Empress Nagako), a distant cousin of the royal blood. They eventually had seven children.\n\nRULE AS EMPEROR\n\nChoosing Showa, which roughly translates to “enlightened peace”, as his reign name, Hirohito formally became emperor on December 25, 1926, following his father’s death.\n\nDuring his reign, Hirohito’s advisors were mostly strong military leaders, who greatly influenced his political decisions.\n\nConsequently, Japan was in the middle of political turmoil at the time, which resulted in the assassination of many public officials, including Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi.\n\nEmperor Hirohito was also a reluctant supporter of the occupation of Manchuria, which ignited the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nFollowing this, Japan became a militant country, eventually pledging its allegiance to the Axis Powers during World War II. It carried out the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which killed almost 2,500 men and destroyed 18 ships at the US naval base.\n\nWhile historical sources depicted Hirohito as powerless and constrained by his military advisors, there was a lingering controversy that the emperor had an active role in the war effort.\n\nFor instance, on February 26, 1936, Hirohito deliberately authorized the use of military force to bring down a coup.\n\nMoreover, in 1941, when Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe stepped down, the emperor declined Konoe’s request for a replacement, which paved the way for the sudden rise to power of dictator Hideki Tojo.\n\nIn September 1945, Hirohito announced the unconditional surrender of Japan to the Allied Powers after the atomic bombings that took place in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nReports said that Japan lost 2.3 million soldiers and an estimated 800,000 civilians during World War II.\n\nShortly after, General Douglas MacArthur, who was also the Allied commander, oversaw the rehabilitation of Japan. At the same time, the United States introduced democratic reforms and a new constitution, forcing the denouncement of imperial divinity and leaving Hirohito as nothing more than a democratic figurehead.\n\nLATER LIFE\n\nAfter the war, Emperor Hirohito was not put on trial, and he was forced to reject the belief that Japan’s emperor was an incarnate divinity (arahitogami).\n\nEven after the repercussions of the Second World War, Hirohito remained a stable figure in Japan. He became the head of state as his title shifted from ‘imperial sovereign’ to ‘constitutional monarch’.\n\nMoreover, he toured the country and oversaw the reconstruction of the damages brought about by WWII. Japan largely went through a period of rapid economic growth.\n\nHe also studied marine biology and eventually wrote several books about this.\n\nOn January 7, 1989, Hirohito died due to cancer at the same place he was born, the Aoyama Palace in Tokyo.\n\nAfter his death, Hirohito’s son, Akihito, succeeded him to the throne.\n\nEmperor Hirohito Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Emperor Hirohito across 21 in-depth pages.
