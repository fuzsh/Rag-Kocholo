        "text": "By Avi Landau\n\nThe year 1932 was a turbulent one in Japan – featuring a wave of assassinations carried out by young right-wing fanatics. On February 9th, former Finance Minister Junnosuke Inoue was shot to death (by Sho Onuma – the son of an Ibaraki farmer)… and then on March 5th, Baron Dan Takuma, Director General of the Mitsui Conglomerate, met the same fate (at the hands of Goro Hishinuma – another Ibaraki farmer’s son). These two assassinations (there were actually 20 men on the hit-list, all liberals or members of the financial elite!) came to be known as the League of Blood – KETSUMEIDAN – Incident, and it lead to the arrest of its mastermind, an ultra-nationalist (self-proclaimed) Buddhist priest(??!!) Nissho Inoue, who had established a temple – and training ground for assassins – in Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture. Then in May, while Nissho was in prison, 11 of his disciples (several from Ibaraki) assassinated the sitting Prime Minister – Tsuyoshi Inukai (Charlie Chaplin, visiting Japan at the time and also on the hit-list, was out watching sumo when the young fanatics came knocking and thus spared).\n\nThat incident came to be called the May 15th Incident (Go Ichi Go Jiken) – after the date on which it was carried out. The strong and vocal public support for the “pure-hearted” assassins (and their devotion to the Emperor) led to lenient sentences for most of those arrested and eventual amnesty for Nissho and the other two gunmen – who had received life-sentences – ( a full pardon, in fact for Nissho) – and signalled the end of any hope for democracy and the rule of law in the face of rising militarism.\n\nDespite vocal support for the killers (which included nine young men from Niigata who cut off their own pinkies and mailed them into the court begging to be tried instead of the actual terrorists!) there were MANY who were deeply disturbed – and the incidents apparently gave Ibaraki Prefecture a bad reputation. In August of 1932 at a session of the Prefectural Assembly, one representative lamented the fact that people around Japan were starting to think that “Ibarakians” were dangerous by nature. He pointed out that it was getting hard to find work “out of prefecture” and some Ibarakians were actually turned away from hotels, inns and guest-houses, with proprietors worried about what these Ibarakians were actually up to while travelling around Japan. He then asked for something to be done, or that some policy be adopted by the prefecture to help alleviate the situation.\n\nIn repsonse to this, Abe Kashichi, who was governor at the time, declared that no matter how noble the intentions, the law of the land could not be ignored. He urged improved education AND stronger policing as a solution to the rising violence.\n\nSo why was it that so many Ibaraki boys were becoming assassins? Well, as I’ve already indicated, because Nissho Inoue had opened his Ultra-Nationalistic Dojo in Oarai (near Mito) and there, he was able to attract plenty of impoverished boys from the surrounding countryside (and the Tsuchiura Naval Aviation Base).\n\nThe next question though, is why Inoue, who was born in Gunma Prefecture, came to Ibaraki?\n\nWell, according to his disciple Goro Hishinuma (the killer of Dan Takuma and later, as Goro Obata, successful prefectural politician), Nissho felt that the Meiji Restoration had its roots in the Mito Clan (which ruled a large part of what is now Ibaraki Prefecture) whose daimyo (feudal lords), especially Mitsukuni (1628-1701) and Nariaki (1801-1860), promoted reverence for the Emperor (and a recognition of the need to “expel the barbarians”*) and whose retainers were famous for the 1860 assassination of the Great Elder, Ii Naosuke , the man who had implemented a policy of opening Japan’s ports to foreign ships. Hishinuma said that Nissho felt that if he came to Ibaraki, he would surely be able to meet young men who carried in their hearts the seeds of those ideas – the spirit of the Mito Clan.\n\n(* Sonno Joi – Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians was also the calling cry of the Tengu Faction during the Mito Rebellion 1864-5.)\n\nSo I guess it was the terrible poverty of the times, the local “Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians” heritage – and the presence in Ibaraki of the charismatic Nissho, that led to their being a preponderance of Ibaraki boys among the assassins of the early Showa Period.\n\nAnd interestingly, the image still sticks. If you look at any of the many books on ALL THE PREFECTURES and check out what they have to say about the Ibaraki Prefectural character, you will find they all say the same thing, in other words, list the same sterotypical character traits – which are called the Mito no San Poi (水戸の三ぽい).\n\nThey are: rikutsu poi (argumentative), okori poi (hot-tempered), and honeh poi (spirited)\n\nThese are characteristics that do NOT seem to me to be representative of the people of Ibaraki today – so I guess that these images are hold-overs from the Mito Clan days and the Early Showa Period, when Ibarakinas were best-known as hot-headed assassins."
