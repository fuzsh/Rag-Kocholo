        "text": "7 November 2019 – “Speaking with the Stars”: The annual Leonid meteor shower ramps up this week. With Bella Luna currently waxing toward Full, the best views will come in the couple of hours after the Moon sets & before twilight starts to paint the sky. The shower will peak the morning of November 18, unfortunately under the watchful eye of a waning gibbous Moon.\n\nThe Moon reaches apogee, the farthest point in its orbit around Earth, at 4:36 am CDT.\n\n***\n\nToday’s 3rd installment of 11.11.19 is dedicated to the Christian Community Priests here in Chicago attending the Synod. ( read the 1st & 2nd )\n\n11/11 is also Martinmas. St. Martin of tours, like Martin Luther King Jr, recognized that he had the capacity to bring healing out of his own resources by sharing his cloak (etheric body) with the shivering beggar (humanity).\n\nCelebrating this Feast Day serves as a reminder that each of us has a connection in the etheric world, where the Christ is calling to be recognized & that each of us has a divine spark that we must ferry out into the world & share with others.\n\nOn Martinmas the children hear the story of St. Martin, sing songs; & as darkness falls, venture out into the night with their lanterns, walking along a path lit with glowing luminaries, carefully carrying their glowing light in a mood of quiet reverence – An innocent prefiguring of the human soul in the life between death & rebirth.\n\nThis symbolic act also brings home the deeper truth heard in the gospel song “This little light of mine.”\n\nInteresting to note that MLK Sr. after visiting Germany, changed his name & his son’s name from Michael to Martin Luther. & MLK Jr. also named his 1st son Martin Luther.\n\nSo powerful to feel the sword & shield of Michael under the wings of these powerful human beings.\n\nI love the story below, I don’t know who wrote it, it is not the typical Martinmas story, but one I thought to share as we make our way thru the dark in anticipation for the powerful events of 11.11.19\n\nSAINT MARTIN’S LIGHT\n\nA stranger once knocked on Martin’s door, and said: “I met an old woman living high in the hills. She is ill and needs your help. She asked for you.”\n\nMartin wrapped bread and wine in a blanket, tied the bundle to his back and set off with his walking staff.\n\nIt was late in the day as Martin hurried along. At first he followed the highway and the going was smooth, but, at the foot of the hills, the road turned away to the south and Martin had to climb up into the woods. As he went along, storm clouds gathered and blocked the setting sun. A cold north wind began to blow, and he buttoned up his coat to keep warm. Soon the woods became as black as ink and Martin was forced to feel his way forward with his staff like a blind man.\n\nRain and sleet began to beat down on Martin’s head as he climbed and great rocks and boulders blocked his way. At last Marin tripped and fell. He looked around and saw nothing. It was too dark and the rain and sleet too fierce. He realized he was lost and no longer knew which way to go. So Martin did the only sensible thing a man can do when he cannot see the way and is completely lost: he prayed- and this was his simple prayer.\n\n“Dear Lord, I have done my best,\n\nBut I can’t lay down to rest-\n\nI am lost and cannot see,\n\nPlease send a light to comfort me.”\n\nMartin looked up and saw a small light hovering in the air before him. He got to his feet, picked up his staff and followed it. The light lit the ground before him and even though he did not know where he was, he knew the light was leading him truly and that he would never stumble.\n\nHigher and higher into the hills he climbed, the little light never wavering, until at last it stopped before a hut made of mud and sticks. It was the poorest hovel Martin had ever seen. He had to bend right over to get in the low doorway and when he was inside he saw and old, old, old woman lying on a bed of fir branches and moss.\n\nMartin immediately untied the bundle from his back and spread the blanket over the woman’s thin body. He took out the loaf of bread, broke it into small pieces, and gave her one to eat. Then he opened the flask of wine, still warm from the heat of his body and put it to her lips.\n\nBut, as soon as the wine touched her lips, the old woman stood up before Martin. All age fell from her and she looked both young and timeless. She became so bright that he thought the sun itself had risen into the sky behind her. Martin fell down on the ground and as he did so he saw in a vision the moon at her feet and a crown of stars on her head.\n\n“Look up, Martin,” she said. “Do not be afraid.”\n\nMartin raised his head and saw the little light, which had led him resting on the palm of her hand.\n\n“This is my gift to you,” she said. “It is the light of faithful knowing that lights your way. From now on, whenever you walk in darkness, this light will shine before you and lead the way.”\n\nAnd so it was. From that day forth, as soon as darkness fell, the little light hovered before Martin and lit his way. The local people were amazed to see such a thing and called it Martin’s Lantern.\n\nAfter he died, Martin was buried in the church where he worked and every year in early November, all the townsfolk gathered at dusk and each of them carried a lantern. Some carried theirs by hand and others, remembering how Martin always used a walking staff, tied theirs to a stick to swing before them. Out into the meadows and fields the townsfolk wandered, singing songs and winding though the darkness.\n\nMay we all find our way thru the darkness, enkindling & holding the wisdom of the true light within.\n\nUntil tomorrow\n\n~hag\n\n***\n\nRudolf Steiner’s Lectures on this day\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY\n\n680 – The 6th Ecumenical Council commences in Constantinople\n\n1492 – The Ensisheim meteorite, the oldest meteorite with a known date of impact, strikes the Earth around noon in a wheat field outside the village of Ensisheim, Alsace, France\n\n1665 – The London Gazette, the oldest surviving journal, is first published\n\n1775 – Goethe arrives in Weimar\n\n1775 – John Murray, the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, starts the first mass emancipation of slaves in North America by issuing Lord Dunmore’s Offer of Emancipation, which offers freedom to slaves who abandoned their colonial masters to fight with Murray and the British\n\n1837 – Death-day of Elijah Parish Lovejoy an American Presbyterian minister, journalist, newspaper editor & abolitionist.
