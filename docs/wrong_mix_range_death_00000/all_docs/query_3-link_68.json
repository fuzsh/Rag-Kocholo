        "text": "By the President of the United States of America\n\nA Proclamation\n\nTo the People of the United States:\n\nIt has pleased God in His infinite wisdom to take from us the immortal spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.\n\nThe leader of his people in a great war, he lived to see the assurance of the victory but not to share it. He lived to see the first foundations of the free and peaceful world to which his life was dedicated, but not to enter on that world himself.\n\nHis fellow countrymen will sorely miss his fortitude and faith and courage in the time to come.\n\nThe peoples of the earth who love the ways of freedom and of hope will mourn for him.\n\nBut though his voice is silent, his courage is not spent, his faith is not extinguished. The courage of great men outlives them to become the courage of their people and the peoples of the world. It lives beyond them and upholds their purposes and brings their hopes to pass.\n\nNow, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, do appoint Saturday next, April 14th, the day of the funeral service for the dead President, as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States. I earnestly recommend the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God, and to pay out of full hearts their homage of love and reverence to the memory of the great and good man whose death they mourn.\n\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States, to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington, the 13th day of April, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and forty-five, and of the independence of the United States, the one hundred and sixty-ninth.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN\n\nBy the President:"
