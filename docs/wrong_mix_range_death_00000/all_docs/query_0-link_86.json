Anne\n\nReviewer\n\nIf you know Bill O'Reilly from Fox News, you will be able to hear him talking throughout this book. He definitely writes like he talks. Whether that is good or bad, I leave up to you. This is one of three books the pair (O'Reilly and Dugard) collaborated on. The other two are Killing Kennedy (which was made into a tv movie) and Killing Lincoln. So far, I have only read Killing Jesus. As O'Reilly has stated on his show, this is a historical book, not a theology book. Although he felt inspired by the Holy Spirit to write this book, it is not intended to inspire but to inform, and that it does. The reader travels back in time to the period when Jesus lived. Geographical and cultural references deliver images to the mind's eye that are both beautiful and horrible. I realize that the book is entitled, Killing Jesus, so I should have been prepared for the graphic horrors of that time but I was hoping those details wouldn't be so....... detailed. This book is not for the faint of heart. Not only does the book describe Jesus' crucifixion but also the common tortures of that time period and then the debauchery of the Kings and other men in power. Certain things about these leaders I didn't need or want to know. I received an education I could have done without. Unfortunately, I cannot \"unknow\" these things. Thanks Bill.\n\nOk, onto what I did like about this book. The politics behind Jesus' arrest and killing are explained far better than any other book I have read on the subject, including the Bible. Being a historical book, the authors made fervent effort to produce an accurate account of who was governing and the circumstances that might have drove them to make fateful decisions. Most of us read Bible stories, in Sunday school, about a wonderful man named Jesus. We learned about His kindness, His miracles and wondered why those \"bad guys\" killed Him. If you were perplexed by that quandary, you won't be after reading this book. It is clear that Jesus was a maverick who made those in power feel threatened. Possibly losing their power, status and funds made them desperate to extinguish the threat and they felt unfettered do so by any means. The book ends where the facts end and faith begins. The facts of Jesus' life and death are not disputed among the erudite scholars. It is only the resurrection that is disputed and whether or not He was the Son of God. Historians of all faiths or no faiths do not argue that Jesus lived, preached, was very popular, stirred up turmoil and died on the cross. The arguments are about what happened to His body after burial and whether or not He rose. Some claim that His body was stolen or He just \"swooned\" and did not actually die on the cross. In either case, this book does not go there. It is strictly a factual history book detailing indisputable facts. Therefore, people of all faiths or no faith at all can read this book without getting \"bent out of shape\".\n\nI recommend this book.\n\nThe Four Kings\n\nScott Spotson\n\nSolstice Publishing\n\nP.O.

The world economy is in depression, and India and Pakistan are on the brink of a nuclear exchange. In the midst of the crisis four young adults materialize in the Oval Office and announce, \"We are the Liberators!\"\n\nThus begins Scott Spotson's political fantasy, The Four Kings. This 492-page epic novel is about a race of wizards taking over our world to implement needed changes. From the Mortals (that's us) they choose Amanda Fullerton as their Supreme Liaison.\n\nA committee of four takes control of each continent destroying the nation-state paradigm over night. World government and economy are now in the hands of the Wizards where coins and bills are replaced by \"bitcoins\" and taxes are abolished. Each continental team of wizards appoints its own Supreme Liaison to act as emissary between the Wizards and the Mortals.\n\nThrough Amanda's point of view, Spotson's political fantasy about Justica, Demus, Regi, and Indie - the four wizards of North America - is perceived. Their ruling style can be seen by the masses on special days called Game Day, Debate Day, and Petition Day. As Supreme Liaison, Amanda has the challenging job of communicating wizard intent to the \"liberated\" population and Mortal concerns to their new rulers. Thrown into the mix is a love triangle between Amanda and the two male wizards and Amanda's loyalty to her conquered people as she connives to uncover the Wizard Achilles heel.\n\nThe Four Kings is a novel with non-stop excitement that keeps coming until its rewarding climax. The only negative about this page-turner is that it ended.\n\n5 Stars\n\nThe Genie Who Had Wishes of His Own: 21st-Century Fables\n\nMargaret Harmon\n\nwww.margaretharmon.com\n\nPlowshare Media\n\nP.O.

The story follows Hrothbert, a former priest who has started to fight his way down and destroy a monster known as The Wight. Told by the Hrudu Man, who often takes the form of a giant rabbit, a strange narrative of speaking rats, an alternate New York city and a corrupt former king begins to unfold for the reader. The story twists and turns, with fish men, The Hierophant and elaborate plots that seem to only slightly be resolved.\n\nFighting Down Into the Kingdom of Dreams is much like it's name. Like a dream, the writing is poetic, transporting the reader from place to place, image to image. However, also like a dream many times the sequences make little to no sense and jumps around. I found myself having to reread many passages just to make sure I had the information correct. Towards the end, I finally just gave up trying to keep it all straight in my mind. This is not a book for those who wish to power through a lazy read on a Sunday afternoon; this is a book that one has to savor and digest in small portions, like an eight course meal at a fancy restaurant.\n\nThe downside to this book is that it is fairly easy to get lost while reading the story. Characters appear in a semi random order, and disappear just as quickly. Answers always seem about two steps away from the reader's grasp, and like the proverbial carrot and stick, the reader finds themselves being alluded by the concept. Dunn chooses to focus on concepts, such as what war does to an individual and a nation. My particularly favorite line had to do with employment, declaring, \"Management takes love, because without love management would kill their employees.\"\n\nThe book is beautifully written and charming, but requires the reader to let go of control and embrace the flow of the words and imagery. This is a book for poets; not a book for control freaks.\n\nWinning Fantasy Baseball: Secret Strategies of a Nine-Time National Champion\n\nLarry Schechter\n\nEmerald Book Company\n\nc/o Greenleaf Book Group LLC\n\nPO Box 91869, Austin, TX 78709\n\n512.891.6100; 800.932.5420; Fax: 512.891.6150\n\nwww.winningfantasybaseballthebook.com\n\n9781937110574, $19.95, 360pp, www.amazon.com\n\nAlso available Kindle, Nook, iTunes\n\nSteve Gardner\n\nReviewer & Senior Fantasy Editor\n\nUSA Today\n\nThe upcoming season brings a renewed sense of optimism to any baseball fan. Perhaps this will be the year our favorite team brings home a championship.\n\nIt's that way for fantasy baseball players as well. The season begins with a blank slate. And even in keeper leagues where some of the players carry over from last year, it all begins with every team tied for first place.\n\nFrom there, it's up to each individual owner to find the best path to a championship.\n\nLarry Schechter, arguably the most successful fantasy baseball player in the country, has written a book that provides an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at just how he's been able to win seven experts league titles and two national competitions in the past 12 years.\n\nThe book is appropriately titled Winning Fantasy Baseball because that's what he does. He wins ... more often than just about anyone else.\n\nBut take note: the book is not called \"playing\" fantasy baseball. There is a big difference.\n\nThough Schechter says the book is written for players of all skill levels - and it does include a section on the basic concepts of the game that experienced players can easily skip - the emphasis is clearly on the \"winning.\"\n\nHe goes step-by-step through his preseason preparations, from projecting player statistics to calculating their values to formulating a draft strategy to leveraging the trade and free agent markets.\n\nAlong the way, Schechter also reveals some of the tricks of the trade that even veteran fantasy owners may not realize. (One example: Calculating separate inflation rates for hitters and pitchers in keeper leagues to more accurately gauge their draft values.)\n\nUndoubtedly, some of his fellow competitors in the LABR and Tout Wars experts leagues (both of which he won in 2013) will use the knowledge to their advantage, but in the end it may not make much difference at all.\n\nHe's THAT good.\n\nWhat readers of this book will want to know is whether or not they can be THAT good in their leagues. The answer is an emphatic yes. But the main takeaway from Winning Fantasy Baseball is that achieving success requires a significant commitment.\n\nIt all begins with projecting player values. Schechter encourages fantasy owners to compose their own projections for every player in the pool. While it's not an iron-clad requirement (an average of several trustworthy sources will work as well), any outside factors that may affect a player's fantasy value -- such as injury history or park factor -- can be built into the projections from the very beginning.\n\nThe second step is converting those projections into a player value. It doesn't matter whether you use an auction or a straight draft or play in a keeper or single-season league. Each player will have a specific value.\n\nIn one of the book's more polarizing statements, Schechter argues that there's no such thing as position scarcity. Therefore, there's no reason to pay more for a player or draft him earlier just because of the position he plays. (One caveat: the lack of depth and irregularity of playing time among catchers does require a slight adjustment.)\n\nWhere Schechter gets his edge is in the precise accuracy of his player values, which he trusts implicitly, even down to a fraction of a dollar. If the auction reaches $21 on a player he has valued at $20.8, he won't bid.\n\nThe main objective, Schechter says, is to get as much excess value as possible out of your roster. For him, a draft isn't successful unless he has at least $300 worth of stats out of his $260 draft budget. He'll even pass on some significant bargains during the draft because he's confident he can get an even bigger one later on.\n\nFor me, that was the biggest revelation. If you have confidence in your values, you'll be willing to wait for the right mix of players - even if it seems as though pitching is being overvalued or all the good power hitters have suddenly become scarce. Since there's a finite collection of stats in the player pool, the owners who overpay to acquire those stats will always lose out to those who get more, less-expensive stats.\n\nWhere I end up disagreeing with him is how accurately anyone can determine what those stats will be. Is a $21.3 player really worth more than a $20.8 player? Schechter says yes - and adding up all that incremental value is how he gets his edge on everyone else at the draft table.\n\nBased on the results and the number of championships he has won, it's hard to say he's wrong.\n\nThe greatest issue for an average fantasy owner is the willingness to make a commitment to Winning Fantasy Baseball. If the will is there, Schechter's book provides a clear blueprint to building a championship-caliber squad.\n\nIn a manner-of-fact style, Schechter explains exactly why he does things the way he does. He provides the charts and calculations to prove his points. He downplays his understanding of higher-level math and sabermetrics, but isn't afraid to use those concepts to make his strategy work.\n\nOn the other hand, if playing fantasy baseball just for the fun of kicking back with a couple beers on draft night and following your favorite players during the season is what's most important, then you'll just have to be content watching Schechter's followers take home the trophy.\n\nAs a fellow LABR participant, I have first-hand experience of how well his system works. If you need more proof, just ask the other owners in AL Tout Wars, where he's won the last three titles.\n\nIf you're serious about winning your league, Larry Schechter's Winning Fantasy Baseball: Secret Strategies of a Nine-Time National Champion should be an essential element in your preseason preparation.\n\nScience and Religion: Reconciling the Conflicts\n\nDavid M.

Collingridge, PhD\n\nReviewer\n\nIn the same spirit of reconciliation as Francis S. Collins and the late Stephen J. Gould, Mr. Barker shows how to reconcile science and religion's seemingly incommensurate beliefs. This book is especially relevant to Christians looking for a well-thought-out approach to reconciling traditional Biblical views with modern scientific discoveries. Abundant scientific information on dating, evolution, and other topics typically at odds with religious views are presented. Barker offers reasonable critiques and ways to interpret scientific findings without doing injury to traditional religious views - food for thought even if you don't accept all his views. The book is well-written, researched, and presented in a non-dogmatic fashion. Highly recommended for people interested in science and religion.\n\nListen To The Whisper\n\nDavid Sample\n\nwww.davidleesample.com\n\nBalboa Press\n\nc/o Hay House, Inc.\n\nPO Box 5100, Carlsbad, CA 92018-5100\n\nwww.balboapress.com www.davidleesample.com\n\n9781452582733, $8.00 (PB), $21.00 (HC), $3.99 (Kindle), 108pp, www.amazon.com\n\nReviewer yet to be named.\n\nTriCountySentry.com\n\nDavid Sample captures the promise and truth of life in his new collection of free verse and lyrical poetry, \"Listen To The Whisper.\"\n\nInspired by his own life and faith in God, Sample pulls inspiration from his personal experiences, including his successes, failures and life-altering decisions, to create moving, thought-provoking poetry.

In Silk Armor, debut novelist Claire Sydenham never lets her readers forget that it is the unseen force of kismet pushing her characters into the individuals they are destined to become. In this twisting tale of destiny, secrets, and growth, Sydenham's narrator - named Claire - is an ex-pat university English teacher working in Turkey. Claire expected to spend a year discovering a Turkey without complications. However, she finds herself involved in a secret affair between a coworker, Victor, and Didem, one of her students. Much of the story reveals itself in Claire and Victor's trip back to the United States. Claire appears to know many of the obvious facts about their relationship, but she probes Victor for answers about another female student - Sevgi, Didem's childhood friend from the village of Karaagac - who suddenly disappears.\n\nThe plot seems simplistic at the outset of the novel, because Claire has not yet discovered all the information. However, each twist and turn will take the reader into a deeper understanding of the kismet that ties all the characters together. Claire's search to find Sevgi's whereabouts opens a well of secrets, creating tension and desire in the reader to discover the truth along with Claire, who reluctantly must partake in the search. The search proves to be the most important part of the story as Claire realizes that each person has made \"mistakes - fated mistakes.\"\n\nA Western reader will find a familiar guide in Claire as they discover Turkey and its people alongside her. A Turkish reader will understand this familiar story of rebellion against family and traditions. Special attention is paid to the deeply symbolic veil that is a prominent motif in the novel. Because the details about Turkey are told through the perspective of an outsider, the feeling of being veiled and protected from real life is potent in the story. Both men and women, whether they look towards home in the East or the West, will be able to discern the power of the veil to cover and to protect. However, Silk Armor does not seek to question the validity of tradition or to compare differing cultures. Sydenham's power of crafting characters that walk the pages as individuals with their own thickly layered struggles - calling to mind the Turkish proverb, \"One who is drenched does not fear the rain\" - is compelling enough to make readers turn inside to the truths within themselves.\n\nCollege Freshman 101\n\nBrenda Faye Collie\n\nDaylight Books\n\nPO Box 1105, New York, NY 10040\n\nwww.daylightbooks.net\n\nAtlas Books (Bookmasters, Inc.)\n\n9780984022021, $9.99, 276pp, www.amazon.com\n\nEllen Feld, Reviewer\n\nFeathered Quill Book Reviews\n\nWhen College Freshman 101 arrived at Feathered Quill I was excited to see it and grabbed it for my review stack. Back in 2011, I had read the first book in this planned trilogy, Almost A Senior, and found it a very enjoyable read. I was eager to learn what happens to the protagonist, Loresha Evans, as she embarks on her college adventure.\n\nWe first met Loresha when she was a junior in high school, in Almost A Senior. Loresha, a young woman growing up in Harlem, might have been marked for failure by many, but they didn't know how strong she was, nor how determined she was to get what she wanted. She knew that graduating from high school was necessary to set her on the path to reach her dream of going to college, and so, throughout the first book, we follow Loresha as she struggles, and\n\nprevails.\n\nNow, in College Freshman 101, we catch up with Loresha once again, this time as she prepares to leave the streets of Harlem for the lush, green grounds of a beautiful college in Massachusetts. Saying good-bye to her family and friends, Loresha makes the several hour trip to her new home, at Jackson College, where everybody seems to fit in except her. The first thing that Loresha notices is that the school is predominately white. Will Loresha find a place at her new school?\n\nLoresha's roommate, Cookie, starts off by annoying her without even trying-'Loresha' seems too long a name so Cookie calls her 'Lori' and when that doesn't work, 'Whatever' seems to be the new name. Loresha is unhappy to say the least, but when she ventures outside she spots \"Another Black student...maybe I would make it here after all.\"\n\nLoresha soon finds several friends among the small Black and minority population at school. Eager to fit in, she goes along with them as they steal money from the library's copier machines. Loresha is hesitant to go along, but when the others in the group encourage her with lines such as, \"we're not stealing. We're on financial aid,\" she gives in and acts as a decoy while others take the money. while Loresha makes some bad choices, she also makes some decisions that show she is maturing. Anxious to earn some money, she takes on a work-study job recording the life stories of Black people working in the area. And while she does party hard, she also is quite serious about studying. That determination to get good grades is also what leads her to a tutor. Walek Simms, a handsome graduate student. Loresha is immediately drawn to the young man, but is he falling in love too or just using her?\n\nTold in the first person by Loresha, I was instantly drawn into College Freshman 101. While I honestly can't relate to the trials that Loresha was going through because our backgrounds are vastly different, the author did such a good job of writing a well-fleshed out main character, that I truly was interested in Loresha's life. When she helped steal the copier money, I found myself cringing, hoping that she would see the mistake she was making. Other characters, too,were well crafted-I particularly liked the way Loresha's relationship with her roommate Cookie changed over time. And while the new college student fell for the hunky graduate student's claims of everlasting love, many readers will undoubtedly scream at Loresha not to fall for his sweet talk. While there were a few spots where the dialogue was a bit strained, overall it was a very satisfying read and I truly enjoyed catching up with Loresha. I look forward to meeting Loresha again in the final book in this enjoyable trilogy.\n\nQuill says: New friends, life lessons, heartache and joy await Loresha as she embarks on her first semester of college. It's a journey she won't soon forget, and I suspect that for the reader, the story will also linger long after the last page is read.\n\nAnn's Bookshelf\n\nThe Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\n\nElizabeth Kolbert\n\nBloomsbury\n\n9781408851210, A$29.99, 319 pages\n\nHenry Holt & Company\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 400, New York, NY 10010-7725\n\n9780805092998, $28.00, 336pp, www.amazon.com\n\nWe have 'Save the Whales', 'Save the Rhinos', 'Save the Sharks' - but what about 'Save the Frogs'?\n\nAs Elizabeth Kolbert begins her book she is in a market in the town of El Valle de Anton in Panama. It has, she says, \"what must be the largest selection of golden frog figurines in the world\", because, here, the golden frog is a lucky symbol. Once, there were thousands and thousands of golden frogs in the El Valle area but by 2002 they had all disappeared. Scientists who decided to capture and breed a few in captivity were too late. It quickly became apparent that the golden frog and amphibians of all kinds were disappearing rapidly, not just in South America but also in Central America, Costa Rica, Australia and many other places, too. The culprit was found to be a chytrid fungus which lives on the animal's skin and interferes with its metabolism.\n\nThe golden frog and many other amphibian species are now extinct in the wild and amphibians are currently the world's most endangered species. Should that worry us? Yes, says Kolbert. Extinction takes place very rarely in geological time and usually very slowly. Sudden mass extinction, such as that which is currently happening to amphibians, and, worryingly, to other species such as reef-building corals, fresh-water molluscs, rays and sharks and some species of mammal, is usually associated with a sudden change in the environment caused by a catastrophe of some kind. So, what is happening?\n\nOne major factor cited by Kolbert is \"intercontinental reshuffling\" - the ease with which animals and organisms are transported around the world. Recent concern about the spread of the SARS virus is one example of the danger this poses. But there are other things which are changing the environment. And who is responsible for this? \"One weedy species\": Us.\n\nHaving pointed the finger, Kolbert digresses into an interesting history of the way in which the concept of extinction came about. Not until the eighteenth century was there any idea that a species might die out. Huge fossilised bones were found and studied in America in 1739 and they were argued over for years, but it was assumed that the animal from which they came was \"still out there somewhere\". Not until Frenchman, George Cuvier, made a close study of as many of these huge bones as he could collect did the idea of a vanished species arise. In 1800, Cuvier determined that there were at least four species of animal that no longer existed, but he argued with Jean Baptiste Lamarck as to whether these animals were a separate species or were creatures which had 'transformed' (evolved) into animals which currently existed.\n\nKolbert follows this argument through, introducing seminal figures in the debate, such as Charles Lyell, whose Principles of Geology strongly influenced Charles Darwin. She also discusses those who proposed and argued over various theories about the cause of mass extinctions. And she brings the arguments up-to-date by visiting places where important discoveries have been made and talking to scientists, ecologists, geologists, conservationists, and others whose current work adds to the debate. Her style is journalistic, which makes for easy reading. But her habit of introducing each person by their physical attributes gets rather wearing: x is lanky, long faced, with bushy eyebrows; y wears a silver ear-ring in each ear and has a large tattoo; z has curly brown hair and a boyish smile; and so on.\n\nFive mass extinctions are know and Kolbert discusses each of them. This current 'Sixth Extinction' (as she has called it) is, like the others, put down to sudden change, caused, not as earlier mass extinctions apparently were by an asteroid strike or a massive volcanic eruption but by our disruption of the Earth's biological and geochemical systems.\n\nCan we stop it? Halfway through this book, reading of the first appearance of homo sapiens and our supposed culpability in the extinction of the Megafauna and also of our close relatives, the Neanderthals, ten thousand years ago, and reading of our continuing responsibility for the loss of various species of birds, bats, trees etc., I began to find the book depressing. Kolbert, however, is not a doom-monger. She pins her hope on \"our restlessness, our creativity, our ability to co-operate to solve problems and complete complicated tasks\". But at the same time she believes that we are now at the point of \"deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed\".\n\nKolbert's accounts of her travels, her descriptions of specific events and of particular animals and historical developments, are all good reading. The overall message, however, is clear: the Sixth Extinction is ongoing and it will change our world. Whether we will survive or not we don't know, but we should heed the warning of ecologist Paul Ehrlich, who wrote that \"in pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches'.\n\nThe Wives of Los Alamos\n\nTaraShea Nesbit\n\nBloomsbury\n\n9781408847824, A$29.99, 230 pages\n\nBloomsbury Press USA\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315, New York, NY 10010\n\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n\n9781620405031, $25.00, 240pp, www.amazon.com\n\nIn 1943, nuclear physicist, J Robert Oppenheimer, was given the task of establishing a secret bomb-development laboratory in a remote, isolated location in America. He chose a Ranch School in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which the American government acquired for the purpose, and he set about recruiting a staff of highly qualified scientists.\n\nMost of the scientists were men, most were married and their families were allowed to join them. Some were American, some British and some had been born in countries which were then being ravaged by war. To begin with, none of them knew exactly where they were going or what to expect when they got there.\n\nFor the men, the work was challenging and intensive and the hours were long, but they had a goal and a reason for being there. For their wives, the move meant an almost complete loss of identity and purpose. They left their homes, jobs, parents, family, friends, their social networks and connections, to move, initially, to an unknown location. They could not even tell their children where they were going, because they did not know themselves until they got there. The only address they could give to anyone was P.O. Box 1663, Santa Fe. They arrived at a closely guarded, barbed-wire-surrounded area, where the small wooden buildings in which most of them were to live were still being built; where essential facilities like water and electricity were often restricted; and where all letters in and out were censored. For some of them, even their names were changed so that they sounded more American: Mrs Meuller became Mrs Miller.\n\nThe culture shock for all of them, and for their children, must have been immense and TaraShea Nesbit conveys vividly how they felt, what life was like for them, and how they adapted - or did not. Nesbit traces the women's lives from their first move to Los Alamos to their departure a few years later, and, briefly, what some of their lives were like in the following years. Her choice of the collective 'we' brings their experiences close, includes the reader in their lives, and makes everything feel personal. This style takes a little getting used to but it works well when she describes \"our husbands\", the difficulties \"we\" faced and the things \"we\" hated and loved, the new friendships \"we\" made, and the changes \"we\" saw in \"our\" children as they grew up. At times, however, it is awkward: \"One night we found our husbands, or someone else's husband, sitting in the middle of the children's sand box...\".\n\nOppenheimer and The General ((Leslie Groves), the scientists, the GI's (Los Alamos was a US Army establishment, although the scientists were civilians), the first detonation of the Atomic bomb - all these come alive in this book, so that the horrific news of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and its civilian populations is immensely moving. And the mixed reactions of \"our husbands\" to this news easily become part of our experience. Husbands, wives and, later on, grown-up children all respond to the development and use of the bomb in very different ways.\n\nTaraShea Nesbit's imaginative empathy with the wives of Los Alamos and her skill in conveying their many experiences, thoughts and feelings makes this a remarkable and unusual first novel. She is certainly a writer to watch.\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nRobert Glancy\n\nBloomsbury\n\n9781408852217, A$29.99, 254 pages\n\nBloomsbury Press USA\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315, New York, NY 10010\n\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n\n9781620406434, $26.00, 272pp, www.amazon.com\n\nBecause Terms & Conditions is all about reading the small print, it comes with a title and advertising material replete with small-print footnotes. None of these are as enlightening as the footnotes in the book itself, but they warn you what to expect. And if you are short-sighted you may need to read this book with a magnifying glass handy, as there are often footnotes to the footnotes to the footnotes and the typeface gets progressively smaller as these progress.\n\nThis gimmick is essentially part of the story, since Frank Shaw, our narrator, is a corporate lawyer who specialises in the small-print Terms & Conditions on legal contracts. He is, he tells us, on one of the bottom rungs of his business: \"the legal equivalent of the guy who sweeps up the hair in a barber's shop\".\n\nFrank, however, is expert at his job, even after losing his memory in a car crash, so he is indispensable to his brother who runs the family law firm, even if he doesn't initially recognise him. Nor does he recognise the other person sitting by his hospital bedside who, it seems, is his \"alleged wife\".\n\nRobert Glacey's debut novel is carefully plotted, fresh and amusing. Frank is understandably confused and the gradual return of his memory reveals more to him than the bare facts of his pre-accident life. He learns things about himself as the \"Old Frank\", and things about his family, which he finds surprising and enlightening. He sees that Oscar, his brother, is manipulative, evil and \"the most corrupt lawyer in London\"; that Alice, the \"lovely, messy, chaotic girl\" he fell in love with has become, in her own words \"a brilliant HR expert and change-enabler\" who, in Frank's words, no longer speaks plain English but is fluent in \"corporate cant\"; and that Malcolm, his younger brother who sends him quirky e-mails from exotic places, had the right idea when he said \"Fuck it!\" to becoming a partner in the firm and walked off into the blue.\n\nAll the characters are lightly drawn and Frank, himself, is wryly funny and likeable, so much so that when he eventually exacts his delightful and appropriate revenge you feel like cheering, even if he can't resist one final footnote as he walks off wishing everyone \"the best of luck and lots of love\" *\n\n* terms and conditions apply.\n\nAnn Skea, Reviewer\n\nhttp://ann.skea.com\n\nBuhle's Bookshelf\n\nThe Compleat Acupuncturist\n\nPeter Eckman, M.D., Ph.D., M.AC.\n\nSinging Dragon\n\nc/o Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Inc.\n\n400 Market Street, Suite 400\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19106\n\n9781848191983 $49.95 www.jkp.com\n\nAcupuncture is an alternative medical practice that has existed for thousands of years, involving stimulation of specific points on the skin with needles, heat, pressure, or other mean.

The techniques cover how to escape from holds and grapples, how to fight back when threatened with a gun or knife. Each technique is described at length, and illustrated with full-color photographs. Perhaps just as valuable is the practical-minded advice for remaining alert and aware of potential dangers during everyday life. \"Be aware of your instincts! If a situation feels wrong, trust that feeling and leave! Sometimes this is nothing more than a feeling that something just is not right. Some people call it a sixth sense, others call it 'gut instinct'.

The author adopts the dubious persona of \"Cary Smith\" to narrate his tormentedly twisted narrative of pseudo-intellectual critics, frustrated dreams, overbearing peers, and highly crazed hyperbole. So real it must be grounded in personal experience, yet so wildly offbeat it can only come from a demented imagination, Four Corners resonates a chord with every reader who has suffered through the uncountable indignities of attempted to extract a secondary education, and is every bit as utterly unforgettable!\n\nMichael J.

Due to her massive global presence on Facebook and Twitter Mandy has a \"built-in\" platform for anything she writes, from books to The Single Woman's blog. Not to mention more than a half million Twitter followers.\n\nMandy's Twitter handle @TheSingleWoman was voted one of the top ten Nashville Twitter handles by Nashville Business Journal, who also identified her as a \"Woman of Influence.\" While the Huffington Post considers Mandy a \"Twitter Passionista\" with a voice of empowerment for women.\n\nYet it took a long road of self-discovery to become that woman where \"the ashes of the girl\" she once was became the \"diamond\" God intended her to be. Her journey would include a miraculous healing doctor's couldn't explain and a baptism \"that penetrated her heart\" unlike her first immersion.\n\nThat baptism spurred a newfound walk with God at a charismatic church where a prophetic minister called her forward and said, \"I see you one day speaking into the lives of many young women.\" That was \"a full decade\" before \"The Single Woman\" came into being, writes Mandy.\n\nMeanwhile dating gave her more questions than answers and prompted her to \"kiss dating goodbye\" for five years in favor of courtship where singles put romance on hold, \"hang out in groups together and get to know one another as friends.\"\n\nMandy's fresh, sometimes sassy voice engages readers emotionally since many struggle with issues she writes about. From her poignant descriptions of loneliness to hopes being dashed when a current love interest doesn't meet expectations or struggles with anxiety and depression.\n\nHowever, one of the best chapters, Mandy's abusive relationship experience, reveals the unrecognized danger and subtle development of abuse until it can no longer be ignored.

It's an inspirational narrative of chance and change that \"links lives and hearts with it's simple but beautiful message.\"\n\nThe story begins with Kate McConnell, a wife and mother who regains consciousness to hear the ambulance medic give a \"critical assessment\" of her vital signs to the emergency room doctors. In coming days newspapers would report Kate was part of the \"worst traffic accident ever on I-95 between Washington D.C. and Baltimore,\" that involved \"twenty-five cars, six semis and one bus.\"\n\nKate's last memory was \"the sounds of breaking glass and crunching metal\" then a \"crushing pain in her chest and down her right leg\" before she lost consciousness. When she came to in the ambulance she felt restraints on her wrists as blood pooled beneath her. The medic's calm transmission of vital signs made her wonder if she was going to die and she prayed, \"Please, let my life count.\"\n\nWhile the ambulance sped toward the hospital Kate remembered carefully copying Psalm 23 onto the scrap of paper she slipped into her son Matt's coat pocket, hoping he would read it. She had prayed long \"over each phrase\" she wrote, then had forgotten to take the paper from Matt's coat pocket when she left the coat to be cleaned.\n\nThat's what prompted her to go back. Kate couldn't know how God would use her carefully, prayerfully scripted words in the weeks ahead. Thus begins a story within stories of lives forever changed as Kate's handwritten scrap of paper travels around the globe. Through a narrative that begins with Kate and ends with Kate, her son Matt and husband, John among other brief narratives sandwiched in between.\n\nReaders meet Chris, an employee of the cleaners who emptied Matt's coat pocket and read the first verse of Psalm 23 - I shall not want that brought the unexpected into his life. Then there's Private Johnson, a veteran in therapy with Doctor Mitchell, who's frozen in a life-changing moment of combat who reads the words from verse two - He makes me lie down in green pastures.\n\nOr Nadia in Turkey, whose brother translated the Psalm as their family ran from the \"horror of war.\" While the Haboob, a stinging sandstorm, adding meaning to verse three - He leads me beside still waters. These and many more richly drawn narratives reveal people powerfully changed by Kate's prayer filled words from the most beloved Psalm in the Bible.\n\nAlthough the book is a quick read, the stories important message teaches God uses what might be considered our most insignificant words, gestures and actions to affect the lives of others. It might be as simple as smiling at a stranger, giving a tip of the hat or the wink of an eye. Or taking the time to make that phone call, fix a meal for someone or sending a card just to say, \"I'm thinking of you.\" If you, like Kate, wonder whether your life has meaning \"The Shepherd's Song\" is a must read.\n\nThe Auschwitz Escape\n\nJoel Rosenberg\n\nTyndale House Publishers\n\n351 Executive Drive, Carol Stream, IL 60188\n\n9781414336244, $26.99, www.tyndale.com\n\nThe Auschwitz Escape, scheduled to release March 18, unlike Joel Rosenberg's other novels, is an inspired work of historical fiction based on the \"greatest escape of all time,\" writes Rosenberg. It's the story of two men sentenced to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camps who escape to warn the world of what the \"final solution\" really means - death in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp Gas Chamber. They carry with them documents the world would come to know as the Auschwitz Protocols.\n\nThe riveting, multi-layered story includes an idealistic young man, a pastor, German Jews and the men and women of France who sacrificed to save them. Although a narrative of death, grim persecution and heartbreak, moments of hope inspired heroism are riveting. The story begins in 1940's France, where, writes Rosenberg, no one realizes \"Evil unchecked is the prelude to genocide.\"\n\nJacob, one of the main characters, is an underground freedom fighter involved in \"a rescue operation that went horribly wrong.\" While some of the Jewish prisoners escaped the trains cattle car, Jacob remains trapped inside with those who didn't escape. Pastor Luc, the other main character, is arrested by the Gestapo, beaten and sentenced to Auschwitz for \"helping Jews\" escape. Their riveting story plays out against the concentration camp of Auschwitz.\n\nRosenberg adds realism with historical facts, such as Franklin Roosevelt's Executive Order 9417 \"for the rescue and relief of victims of enemy oppression.\" And the burning of German Jewish poet, Christian Johann Heinrich Heine books in 1933. Who had written \"wherever they burn books, in the end will also burn human beings.\"\n\nRosenberg's realistic characterizations and nail-biting events enhance a segment of history few lived to tell about with a fictionalized account of courage and faith that reveals the resilience of the human spirit. \"The Auschwitz Escape,\" thought-provoking, unforgettable and guaranteed not to disappoint.\n\nWater Walker: Outlaw Chronicle Series, Book 2\n\nTed Dekker\n\nWorthy Publishing\n\n134 Franklin Road, Suite 200, Brentwood, TN 37027\n\n9781617952746, $14.99, www.worthypublishing.com\n\n\"Water Walker,\" book two in Ted Dekker's \"Outlaw Chronicles,\" releases March 18 from\n\nWorthy Publishing Group who acquired the print rights. The suspenseful narratives of redemption and forgiveness makes clear why \"Library Journal\" considers this author a master of suspense.\n\nIt's the story of thirteen-year-old Alice Ringwald, a foster child with amnesia. Her memories begin six months ago and it's as if she didn't exist before that. In those months she'd been tested many times, told she had a high IQ and speaks like an adult with an unusual ability to absorb new information intuitively. Yet, the counselor she sees once a week tells her she's also naive and trusts without question, much like a child.\n\nAlice only knows she's different in a way no one can explain which makes her feel weird, like she doesn't fit in anywhere. She must have had parents but she doesn't know who they were, where she once lived or even if she went to school. No one has answers and she has too many \"why\" questions. Until one night, four months after moving into the foster home of John and Louise Clark, Alice answers the door and \"stares up into the blue eyes of a man who claims to be her father.\"\n\nThus begins a \"modern day parable\" that takes readers on an unforgettable, mind-bending journey that keeps them guessing from beginning to end. From Kathryn, a mother everyone thought dead, to Wyatt, a submissive father who does what he's told. To FBI agent Olivia Strauss, obsessed with a case that reminds her of Michelle, her kidnapped daughter who was murdered, to April herself, who learns her real name is Eden.\n\nAdd a rich senator, a large inheritance, bizarre and strange ritualistic behaviors, a cult-like life of captivity; Stephen the \"Outlaw\" who gives \"secret words\" and this suspense filled thriller, based on choices, consequences and spiritual warfare is one only Dekker could write.\n\nI especially liked Dekker's writing Alice's chapters from her point-of-view with the rest of the story in third person. By the time I finished I realized he had returned to his earlier style of writing that made such a huge impact on the Christian publishing world and brought him thousands of fans. If you mystery and suspense this is not a book to miss! I'm also looking forward to reading Hacker, book three, scheduled to release June 10, 2014.\n\n52 Heart Lifters for Difficult Times\n\nDiana Savage\n\nHarvest House\n\n990 Owen Loop North, Eugene, OR 97402\n\n9780736956604, $11.99, www.harvesthousepublishers.com\n\nProfessional editor, author and encouraging mentor, Diana Savage penned, \"52 Heart Lifters for Difficult Times,\" a book of hope filled meditations served up with a dash of humor. Intimate with loss and grief, this Washington native now encourages others with the encouragement she received that she now writes about on her popular heartlifters blog. Where readers can also read sample chapters of this book.\n\nDiana begins with a description of what a \"heart lifter\" is, such as a smile, wink, nod or tip of the hat, small gestures that remind recipients \"we're not alone on life's journey.\" Her warm humor, God-blessed wisdom and insightful understanding shine through each meditation.\n\nThe book, divided into four segments includes:\n\n\"Choosing our Outlook\" - what our minds dwell on determines our destiny. Or like Ralph Waldo Emerson writes, \"We become what we think about all day long.\"\n\n\"Living Miraculously\" - belief in miracles and believing God for miracles. Or like the French proverb says, \"There are no miracles for those that have no faith in them.\"\n\n\"Participating Joyfully\" - centers on trusting God. Believing God has a plan and purpose for your life and has your \"best interests at heart.\"\n\n\"Pursuing Possibilities\" illustrates how a victim mentality, incorrect assumptions and misconceptions \"shackle\" and hinder pursuit of \"new possibilities\" in life.\n\nFifty-two scripture themed meditations include a Bible verse, a light-hearted anecdote or other illustration of the selected scripture theme and conclude with prayer. These brief devotions are perfect for time-challenged readers.\n\nDiana's book of \"52 Heartlifters\" is especially good for anyone suffering from loss, disappointment, or a sense of failure in our fast-paced world. The book would also be an excellent choice for a friend or family member in need of hope and encouragement.\n\nThe Love Languages Devotional Bible\n\nDr. Gary Chapman\n\nMoody Publishers\n\n820 North LaSalle Blvd., Chicago, IL 60610\n\n9780802408532, $29.99, www.moodypublishers.com\n\nDr. Gary Chapman, noted counselor, relationship expert and author of, \"Five Languages of Love\" that teaches language of love concepts adds his practical and helpful devotions to the NLT version of \"Love Languages Devotional Bible.\" It's a perfect choice for couples of all ages with readings that apply \"text to real-life relationships and deepens couples' understanding of God and of each other.\"\n\nHis devotions are a perfect addition to this translation, already appreciated for its straightforward approach and \"clear, dynamic writing style,\" which can also be said of Dr. Chapman's teachings and devotions.\n\nDr. Chapman's devotions focus on different aspects of relationships, enhanced by a topical, \"relationship oriented\" index of relevant Bible verses and devotional themes. Bible books start with summaries that note the author, time frame and overall theme of the book. Three easy-to-follow reading plans are also included:\n\n\"Read through the Bible in one year\"\n\n\"Getting to know God\"\n\n\"Growing your faith.\"\n\nMore than 260 devotions touch on communication issues, gender roles, conflict, finances, children, guilt, manipulation, confession, forgiveness and more. For example the devotion on \"Temper, Temper\" cites the example of Moses who struck the rock in anger instead of trusting the Lord to do what He promised. (Numbers 20:1-13).\n\nThe reading illustrates anger has negative consequences, while acting in love neutralizes a hostile situation. Examples of provocative situations, recommended responses and suggestions for prayer complete the devotion. The \"if you have more time\" segment offers extra relevant scriptures and questions.\n\nSince weekends are busy times for couples and families, the 52 \"weekend studies\" are intentionally short, contain supplementary scriptures, several questions and a \"challenge\" to consider and discuss. Besides a \"powerful, life-changing resource,\" devotions and reading plans encourage individuals and couples to read the Bible.\n\nDr. Chapman also provides free study guides on the love languages of marriage, parenting, teens and children.

An ancient Indian chief spirit contacts St. Augustine tour guide Ssabra Omith because she is part Cherokee Indian, about the murders. He wants her to contact the police. When she talks to Colvin and tells him that a Wican priestess from Cassadaga, Florida opened a door for an evil spirit to attempt to crossover and mate with beings of this existence, he shows very little interest in what he's been told. He thinks Ssabra is just too weird to believe. Later when he hears from another source the same information, he begins to allow himself to realize that he is not dealing with something human but that the killer is something supernatural.

'The short stories appeared in a variety of magazines and anthologies, and used bits and pieces of my history with the game, blending them with fictional elements to tell the story at hand.

As the book opens, Gamache, head of homicide at the Surete de Quebec, has become increasingly isolated. Now \"on the far side of fifty,\" after three decades in the department the only one of his original investigators left is Isabel Lacoste, the rest having been either transferred out on their own or moved by Gamache's nemesis, Chief Superintendent Francoeur, the most senior cop in Queec. But that situation has to take a back seat when he is called by Myrna Landers, the woman who owns the bookstore in the village of Three Pines, concerned when a friend who had just spent a few days there visiting, promising as she left that she would return shortly for the Christmas holidays. The enigmatic woman, Constance Pineault, had not returned, and Myrna, worried about her, asks Gamache to investigate. Therein lie the seeds of the ensuing parallel investigations. The rest of the novel concerns itself with murders and intrigues, both plentiful, going back over decades. Along the way we learn a great deal about lesser-known aspects of Canadian history, some more shameful than one might expect.\n\nGamache discovers that Constance, 77 years old, was in fact Constance Ouellet, the lone surviving member of quintuplets who had become world-famous upon their birth in the time of the Great Depression. She had for years hidden that identity and lived under her mother's maiden name to avoid the spotlight that had always followed her. (The author admits to having been \"inspired\" by the real-life Dionne quintuplets, born in that same era many years ago.)\n\nAll the residents of the village are present, and the many fans of the series will welcome them: Myrna, a large black woman who had been a practicing psychologist; Ruth Zardo, an eccentric, award-winning poet, and Rosa, her beloved pet duck; Gabri and Olivier, the lovers who run the bistro and the B&B; Clara Morrow, an artist and portraitist; as well as Henri, Gamache's German shepherd. Crucial but present only on the fringes of the tale is Jean-Guy Beauvoir, formerly Gamache's second in command and engaged to his daughter but now in the throes of a terrible addiction to painkillers after the life-threatening wounds sustained during the traumatic events which closed the prior book in the series. Suffice it to say that I found myself literally holding my breath in the final pages.\n\nThe writing is never less than elegant. This book is going from my hands into those of my granddaughter, a big fan of Ms. Penny's writing and a resident of Montreal from the time she started her college career at McGill University in that city as well as since her graduation, which I know will give her an even deeper appreciation of the book than my own.\n\nAs usual, the author from time to time includes snippets of poetry (mostly courtesy of Crazy Ruth), one such giving us the title of the novel: \"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\" And the meaning of that couldn't be clearer by the end of this novel, which can only be called simply terrific. And highly recommended.\n\nThe Set-Up Man\n\nT.T. Monday\n\nDoubleday & Company\n\nc/o The Random House Publishing Group\n\n1745 Broadway, New York, NY 10019\n\nwww.doubleday.com\n\n9780385538459, $24.95, Hardcover, 272 pp, www.amazon.com\n\nThe book is equal parts mystery and baseball. There is enough action in both aspects to keep the reader involved and turning pages quickly. Johnny Adcock is a terrific protagonist. He is a no-longer-young baseball player, 35 to be exact, thirteen years in the big leagues, his assigned role, as the title would suggest, to come into a game in the eighth inning, primarily to face left-handed hitters (as he is a southpaw himself), and retire them. Divorced and with a teenage daughter, his significant other is Bethany, a partner in a venture-capital firm who Johnny describes as the most intelligent woman he has ever met.\n\nJohnny's side job, so to speak, is as an investigator, which primarily involves \"cheating spouses, paternity threats, nothing bloody or life-threatening.\" Until now, that is. He is approached one night by Frankie Herrera, the 25-year-old backup catcher for the Bay Dogs of San Jose, California, who tells him that he has a \"problem with his wife.\" Very shortly thereafter, Frankie is found dead after an apparent auto accident. His widow believes it was not an accident, and hires Johnny to find out who killed her husband. The ensuing investigation embroils Johnny in matters of murder, porn, Mexican cartels, and other assorted intrigue.\n\nTiming is everything, they say, and my reading this debut novel by T.T. Monday on the eve of the new baseball season couldn't have been more perfectly timed. \"The Set-Up Man\" is a good mystery, with heavy doses of humor despite some of the darker aspects, and contains an abundance of terrific baseball lore and references. One doesn't have to be a baseball addict to enjoy the novel (although, to be fair and in the spirit of full disclosure, I am exactly that). Not a no-hitter, perhaps, but a solid performance, especially from a rookie. This is a very entertaining book, on any level, and it is recommended.\n\nHelsinki Blood\n\nJames Thompson\n\nBerkley\n\nc/o Penguin Group USA\n\n375 Hudson St., NY, NY 10014\n\nwww.penguin.com\n\n9780425264614, $15.00,Paperback, 341 pp, www.amazon.com\n\nInspector Kari Vaara, of the National Bureau of Investigation, the protagonist in this series, in which this is the fourth entry, has a reputation as a \"hero cop,\" having been shot more than once in the line of duty and decorated for bravery both times, and possessed of \"annoying incorruptibility.\" In the prior book in the series, \"Helsinki White,\" he was offered, and accepted, a job running a black-ops unit in his native Helsinki, using crime to fight crime with hand-selected (and admittedly sociopathic) cohorts, his \"brothers in arms, brothers in blood.\"\n\nThe book opens a very short time after the events described in the last book. Kari is still recovering from brain surgery to remove a tumor, the unsettling after-effects of which, while now lessening, were psychological/emotional rather than physical. As I wrote about that book, his motives were primarily altruistic: \"I took this job and started this illegal operation after being promised that it was for the purpose of helping people\" specifically \"young women being forced into the slave trade and prostitution. (A welcome by-product of bringing those criminals to justice was the ten million euros he had \"liberated\" from a faked blackmailer, aiding his present efforts.)\n\nThose are still his primary motivations, especially when he is approached by a woman who begs him to find her 19-year-old daughter, who has Down syndrome, who has been duped and is being held against her will with an intended future as a prostitute. He believes that \"if I could truly save this one girl, in some tiny way, it would justify all I've done. It wouldn't make things right or restore balance to my inner world, but the symbolism would be there, proof that doing good is possible for me.\" And maybe get his wife back: Vaara's life, mind and body are in shambles, only made worse when his wife of two years, shattered by the events in the prior book and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has left him, and their baby daughter, and sought refuge (ironically) with her drug-addicted brother in Miami. Honor-bound \"to the concept of duty, that sacrifice for the good of others is not only laudable, but expected, especially when it comes to family,\" he is determined to see that justice is again served, even after his investigation soon reveals that some very important people are involved, to his, and his family's, peril. This book, as readers of the prior books in the series know, is not for the faint of heart.\n\nIt is, however, recommended.\n\nThe Dead Place\n\nStephen Booth\n\nWitness Impulse\n\nc/o Harper Collins\n\n10 E. 53rd St., NY, NY 10022\n\n9780062302021, $15.99 pb, Kindle & Nook e-book, www.amazon.com\n\nThe newest book in this deservedly popular series by Stephen Booth, first published in the US in 2007, brings back Detective Constable Ben Cooper and his partner, Detective Sergeant Diane Fry. While Fry is investigating creepy phone calls received by the police from an obviously deranged person speaking through a voice changer and referring to deaths which have not yet taken place, in addition to the disappearance of a young woman from a car park, Cooper is trying to identify, with the help of a forensic artist who has done a facial reconstruction, a woman whose body has been found lying in a wooded area apparently more than a year after her death.\n\nThe anonymous phone caller is obsessed with death, and the subject permeates every corner of this book. Part of one phone call: \"I can smell it right now, can't you? ...It's the scent of death.\" And indeed death in all its aspects becomes palpable - to the police and the reader in turn, the thanatologist who volunteers to assist the police as a consultant only enhancing the effect. Diane muses: \"...there must be many ways of shutting out the sight of death passing by, or pretending it didn't exist.\" But the caller, again, insists: \"To most people, death is a dirty secret, a thing of shame, the last taboo. To me, it's completion, the perfect conclusion.\" On the other hand, Ben \"knew that he'd have to face up to his own death some time. Like most people, he'd always thought he could avoid it forever. And perhaps he'd read too many stories in which people didn't die. Instead, they passed away, breathed their last, or were no more. In polite conversation, death was skated over rapidly, like thin ice.\" Cryptic clues are contained in the phone calls, which exhort the police and tells them that all they have to do is find \"the dead place.\" It becomes a race against time as the police attempt to discover the identity of the caller, and of his next victim.\n\nA psychological thriller of the first order, \"The Dead Place\" is filled with atmospheric detail and a complex plot. Fry and Cooper are wonderfully drawn characters with whom the reader becomes more involved with each new novel by Mr. Booth. Highly recommended.\n\nLost\n\nS.J.

And as the book opens, the bodies are being found more and more quickly, the killer seemingly escalating. Barney's den is covered with posters, maps and photographs about each boy, his kidnapping, and his death.\n\nThe police investigation is headed up by D.I. Dana Tulloch, of Lewisham's Major Investigation Team. Sure of only one thing, that the killings will continue, they have no clues. And someone, perhaps the killer, is taunting them online. On the periphery of the investigation is D.C. Lacey Flint, still recovering from the horrific event of her last case, in the aftermath of which she is still seeing a psychiatrist twice a week, fighting her own demons, unsure of whether or not she still wants to remain a policewoman.\n\nBarney is the youngest of a small group of kids (five boys and one girl) who are brave, and foolhardy, enough to do some investigating of their own. He also happens to live next door to Lacey Flint. One day he works up the nerve to ask her to help him find his mother, who apparently left several years ago, when he was four years old, and he is determined to track her down, going so far as to use all his meager wages working for a newsagent to run anonymous classified ads in very methodically and geographically plotted newspapers in London and beyond.\n\nThe novel is but the newest of several suspenseful books from this author, and characters, plotting and tension seen in her prior work are fully present here. The reader is never more than guessing at the possible identity of the killer, as are the detectives whose work is detailed here, knowing that if they do not succeed another boy will die. Obsession is a constant theme. This is another winner from S.J. Bolton, and is recommended.\n\nGraveyard of Memories\n\nBarry Eisler\n\nThomas & Mercer\n\nc/o Amazon Digital Publishing\n\n276 Fifth Ave., NY, NY 10001\n\nwww.amazon.com/thomasandmercer\n\n9781477818169, $14.95, Paperback, 322 pp.\n\nA prequel to the thriller series whose protagonist is John Rain, assassin for hire, this new novel takes place in Tokyo in 1972. Rain, recently returned from combat duty in Vietnam and Cambodia and having left the military under a cloud, barely 20 years old, he finds a job of sorts as a CIA bagman. Rain is half American and half Japanese; after his father was killed in street riots in Tokyo in 1960, when Rain was eight years old, his mother brought him to the US, where he stayed until her death, at which time he joined the military. His beloved Suzuki motorcycle has been dubbed \"Thanatos,\" which he felt was \"appropriate after what I'd done in the war.\"\n\nAfter a series of incidents which trigger \"combat reflexes shaped in the jungle,\" and initially at least through no fault on his part, Rain finds that \"something about my demeanor . . . was suddenly making everyone swoon for my apparent potential as a contract killer,\" and so the Rain we have come to know and love is born. Rain also displays a sentimental side: \"My past and everyone part of it sundered, irretrievable, accessible to me now only as painful and haunted memories, some still sharp, some increasingly indistinct . . . But with sufficient exposure, you get acclimated to anything, killing included.\" And ultimately there is \"the smooth,ineluctable symmetry of fate.\"\n\nThe author manages to inject humor into a tale that is, unexpectedly, almost dispassionate, not as dark or graphic as might have been the case in lesser hands, despite the high body count. And the mantra throughout: \"Sometimes there's just what you can do, and what you can't.\" By book's end, Rain is forced to enter a self-imposed exile and starts a decade of life as a fugitive.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nDon't Ever Look Back\n\nDaniel Friedman\n\nMinotaur\n\nc/o St. Martin's Press\n\n175 Fifth Ave., NY, NY 10010\n\nwww.miotaurbooks.com\n\n9781250027566, $24.99/28.99 CA, Hardcover, 304 pp., www.amazon.com\n\nThis book is the second by Daniel Friedman featuring Baruch \"Buck\" Schatz, an 88-year-old Jewish ex-cop from Memphis, Tennessee, self-described as \"grumpy more for sport than out of necessity\" but more recently as \"a crippled retiree living in a rest home.\" He has had to sell his house and move with his wife of 65 years into an \"Assisted Life-Style Community for Older Adults\" after having been shot and severely beaten in the first book, \"Don't Ever Get Old.\" During his 35 years as a cop he had shot thirty-one men and beaten an equally impressive number, but was \"famously incorruptible.\" He still carries a blackjack, which he named \"Discretion,\" and as he says, he \"exercised my Discretion liberally.\"\n\nHe still carries the scars, physically and mentally, of his days in Auschwitz as a child, of his father's murder when a young boy, and his son's death seven years ago. Also returning here is Buck's grandson, a law school grad named William Tecumseh Schatz, whose nickname is Tequila (apparently a frat thing) - the last name of course being pronounced \"Shots.\" (Of his grandson, Buck says \"Maybe because he was family, I disliked him less than most other people.\") The tale takes place in 2009, but is equal parts flashbacks to 1965, a time when racism and anti-Semitism were endemic, and when the seeds of the events taking place in 2009 were sown. A lot of history from that earlier time, much of it unfamiliar to this reader, is included. The intricate plot spins out after Buck receives a visit from an old nemesis, who offers him what appears to be a bribe, which Buck of course refuses. But more importantly, it appears that the man intends to rob a local bank. And Buck can't allow that to happen, not in his town. The events that follow are alternately shocking and very, very funny.\n\nInterspersed from time to time are brief passages from Buck's notebook of \"Things I Don't Want to Forget\" (primary among which is a reminder that \"paranoia is the first symptom of dementia in the elderly,\" important for him to remember since paranoia seems to be recurring with worrisome frequency). These are often more like ruminations than part of any story, but they are intrinsic to knowledge of the man, as well as occasional historical details. As Buck says, \"you just write down the stuff you want to remember, leave out the rest of it, and keep pushing yourself forward on a walker or in a wheelchair or with anything that can keep you moving.\"\n\nThe author does not shy away from the occasional difficult and wrenching truths. As was the first book in what one hopes is a series, this novel is alternately laugh-out-loud funny, often poignant, frequently touching, and with a totally unexpected ending, the book is recommended.\n\nDon't Look For Me\n\nLoren Estleman\n\nForge\n\nc/o Tor-Forge Books\n\n175 Fifth Ave., NY, NY 10010\n\nwww.tor-forge.com\n\n9780765331212, $24.99, Hardcover, 288 pp, www.amazon.com\n\n\"Don't look for me\" is the entire content of a handwritten note left for the newest client of Amos Walker, to wit: a full partner in an investment company \"with gray temples and an office with a view of two countries\" - - that would be the US and Canada - - whose wife, 14 years her junior, has disappeared for the second time in the six years they've been married Her husband suspects anything from her having left him for a younger man to having met with foul play.\n\nMr. Estleman is the author of over 70 novels, and this is the 23rd entry in the series. Walker, a former cop who carries an honorary sheriff's star, is now a private detective renowned for finding missing persons. There is immediate evidence of the author's trademark wit, to which the new client responds: \"The humor I can take or let alone.\" Not so the reader. His descriptions of several characters are exquisite portraits. Of his new client's choice of attire: \"a suit the color and approximate weight of ground fog,\" and of the man himself, \"If he was so rich, why wasn't he smart?\" The superintendent of his building was \"on the tattered outer edge of middle age.\" Inspector John Alderdyce, of the Homicide division of the Detroit Police Department, who he'd known \"longer than anyone living,\" and who is Walker's \"bane and salvation, . . . looks like a grizzly bear carved with a chainsaw from a living oak.\"\n\nWalker soon realizes that \"a simple missing-persons case had turned into something else, like most things in a bad dream.\" It ultimately involves the Detroit Mafia, a porno film studio, and a 'Dragon Lady' nemesis of Walker, \"a psychopath with a two hundred IQ and more liquid assets than an emirate . .. ten times smarter than I am and twice as insane. Make that three times.\"\n\nA fast-paced and consistently witty entry in this terrific series, it is highly recommended.\n\nJust What Kind of Mother Are You\n\nPaula Daly\n\nAtlantic Monthly Press\n\nc/o Grove Atlantic\n\n841 Broadway, NY, NY 10003\n\nwww.groveatlantic.com\n\n9780802121622, $24.00, Hardcover, 312 pp, www.amazon.com\n\nThis stunning debut novel from Paula Daly is a breathtaking tale of ostensibly normal lives torn asunder. Lisa Kallisto, who runs an animal shelter, lives in a small village holding 260 houses in the English Lake district. Just a few days before Christmas, her best friend's thirteen-year-old daughter disappears, and the only thing more horrifying to Lisa is the fact that it appears to have been her fault. The author makes palpable the guilt which wracks the overworked and overwhelmed mother of three. And apparently this is not the first adolescent girl in the area to have been kidnapped, nor is she the last. As Lisa says: \"There is nothing as bad as a missing child. Nothing at all.\"\n\nThe investigation is headed up by D.C. Joanne Aspinall of the CID. Both women are in their late thirties, and the author focuses much of the book on these two women, wonderfully well-drawn, as are the other characters. The book is not as dark as one might expect, dealing as it does with such perverted acts. It is certainly suspenseful. Not edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, perhaps, at least until Day 4.\n\nAs the tale comes to a close, what came to mind was my mother's old adage: One never knows what goes on behind someone else's closed doors. And everyone has a secret (or two). I read this book in a little more than 24 hours, and it is highly recommended.\n\nTragic\n\nRobert K.

(Ultimately one learns that the second man was in fact the bodyguard of the woman, who is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful Japanese mogul.) There are \"no fingerprints, no trace evidence, no witnesses\" and no clues except for a blood-drenched slip of paper bearing an unreadable kanji, a unique Japanese character.\n\nJim Brodie, formerly LAPD, is now a 32-year-old private detective who is a 6' 1\", 190-lb. Caucasian with black hair and blue eyes, had lived for the first 17 years of his life in Japan, where he has his office; he also has a shop in San Francisco where he repairs and sells art and antiques, primarily Oriental. (He says of himself that he is \"refined on the one hand, brutish on the other,\" and wonders if he can \"make the leap from things people created to things they destroyed.\") He is called in as a consultant by the SFPD to assist in the investigation, and is staggered by the enormity of the crime. Brodie is a fascinating protagonist, intent in finding the perpetrators, but equally dedicated to protecting his six-year-old daughter, all the more so after having lost his Japanese wife in a lethal fire which had destroyed their home. The ensuing events put Brodie, his daughter, and all those around him and involved in the chase in great danger as it soon becomes evident that they are looking for a serial killer (or killers).\n\nThe novel is obviously very well-researched, beyond the author's own apparent knowledge of Japanese culture, history and martial arts. The plot draws the reader in. I have to admit that in the early pages I thought some of the dialogue a bit overwrought, but that reaction dissipated as I read further. The book is action-filled and suspenseful and surprises, as Brodie digs deeper into a twisting plot whose tentacles reach through parts of Asia, Europe, and the US to find the killers, of whom the description \"ruthless\" doesn't even come close. A thriller in every sense of the word, the novel is recommended.\n\nTragic\n\nRobert K.

The history is strong and the fiction blended into the history is not so fanciful that the history is impossibly corrupted. The story is actually two tales, a contemporary and a historical, separated by a thousand years of time. The only problem I have with the story is the metho"
