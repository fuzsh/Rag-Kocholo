        "text": "A visit to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is to be transported to a trying time in American history, an era rife with economic depression and international conflict. The memorial, which honors the 32nd president of the United States, is composed of four “outdoor rooms” which represent each of President Roosevelt’s four terms as commander in chief.\n\nBronze sculptures of the president, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, his trusty canine and First Pet Fala, as well as scenes from the Great Depression of fireside chats and waiting in bread lines are surrounded by engravings of 21 famous quotes and waterfalls cascading over red South Dakota granite. The memorial provides an in-depth experience and unparalleled insight into the trials and tribulations of America’s longest-serving president.\n\nPlanning your visit to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial\n\nThe FDR Memorial, which is located along the National Mall's Tidal Basin in between the Martin Luther King, Jr. and Jefferson memorials, opened to the public in 1997 and is maintained by the National Park Service. Like all the monuments and memorials on the National Mall, the FDR Memorial is free and open to the public. The memorial is also the first on the National Mall to be built wheelchair accessible. Given its location on the Tidal Basin among the cherry blossom trees, it is especially popular to visit during the National Cherry Blossom Festival.\n\nThe most convenient way to get to the memorial is by taking the Metrorail. The two closest Metro stops are Federal Triangle and Smithsonian, both on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines. If traveling by bus, take the DC Circulator’s National Mall route. If driving, visitor parking is available on Ohio Drive, between the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. Handicapped parking spaces are set aside at locations on West Basin Drive in front of the memorial. Note that street parking is often limited in DC.\n\nHave a question? National Park Service Rangers are on hand to assist visitors daily from 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and provide interpretive programs throughout the day and upon request.\n\nWhat does all the water at the FDR Memorial represent?\n\nBy now you have learned that the four outdoor “rooms” are symbolic of Roosevelt’s four terms as president and what the statues represent, but what about all of the waterfalls and fountains?\n\nThere are many water features, all with their own meaning. There’s the water feature comprised of one large drop, which depicts the crash of the economy that led to the Great Depression; multiple stair-like drops pay homage to the Tennessee Valley Authority dam-building project; there are chaotic falls at varying angles signifying World War II; and a still pool for Roosevelt's death.\n\nThe water and more than seven acres of space to explore at the FDR Memorial provide for an educational and introspective experience you’re not soon to forget.\n\nDid you know there are two FDR memorials?"
