        "text": "In 1910 Roosevelt was elected as a Democrat to the New York Senate. In 1912 President Woodrow Wilson made Roosevelt assistant secretary of the Navy. During World War I (1914–18) Roosevelt helped lead the Navy to victory over German sea forces. In 1920 Roosevelt ran for vice president, but the Democrats lost the election.\n\nIn 1921 Roosevelt caught poliomyelitis, a disease that paralyzed him from the waist down. In later years he could walk a little using a cane and leg braces, but he usually used a wheelchair.\n\nIn 1928 and again in 1930 Roosevelt was elected governor of New York. As the Great Depression began, Roosevelt introduced programs to help people without jobs.\n\nThe Democratic Party chose Roosevelt to run for president in 1932. With the depression worsening, Roosevelt promised a “new deal” for millions of poor people. He won an easy victory over his Republican opponent, President Herbert Hoover.\n\nBy the time Roosevelt was sworn in as president in March 1933, about 13 million people were unemployed in the United States. Roosevelt began his New Deal programs by making sure banks did not go out of business and by creating work for the jobless. In 1935 he asked Congress to pass the Social Security Act, which provided money to people who were unemployed, disabled, or elderly.\n\nRoosevelt easily won reelection in 1936. By the time he began his second term in 1937, the economy had greatly improved. By 1938 the New Deal was coming to a close.\n\nIn 1939 World War II began in Europe. In a special session called by Roosevelt, Congress agreed to send weapons to Great Britain and France. In 1940 Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to run for and win a third term.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Japan bombed U.S. military bases in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack brought the United States into the war. It joined Britain against Japan, Germany, and Italy.\n\nRoosevelt worked with British leader Winston Churchill to plan the war effort. Later, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin joined them. Roosevelt and other world leaders also began planning the United Nations, a new international organization to maintain world peace. Despite his failing health, Roosevelt won election to a fourth term in 1944."
