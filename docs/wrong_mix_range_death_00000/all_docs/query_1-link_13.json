        "text": "Events\n\nPhotos\n\nSite Map\n\nHistoric Site Feedback\n\nPass\n\nPoignant and profound, Roosevelt's Little White House stands as testimony to the neighborly association of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the citizens of Georgia, the nation and the world, bears witness to his battles against the dreaded illness of polio, economic depression and world tyranny, and stands as a moment frozen in time when the world heard of his death there on April 12, 1945.\n\nRoosevelt's Little White House\n\nNow a National Historic Landmark, Franklin Delano Roosevelt built the Little White House in 1932 while governor of New York, prior to being inaugurated as president in 1933. He first came to Warm Springs in 1924 hoping to find a cure for the infantile paralysis (polio) that had struck him in 1921. Swimming in the 88-degree, buoyant spring waters brought him no miracle cure, but it did bring improvement. During FDR’s presidency and the Great Depression, he developed many New Deal Programs (such as the Rural Electrification Administration) based upon his experiences in this small town.\n\nWhile posing for a portrait on April 12, 1945, FDR suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died a short while later. Today, the “Unfinished Portrait” is featured in a museum that showcases many exhibits, including FDR’s 1938 Ford convertible with hand controls, his Fireside Chats playing over a 1930s radio, his stagecoach and a theater. Visitors can tour FDR’s home, which has been carefully preserved very much as he left it, the servants and guest quarters, and the nearby pools complex that first brought the future president to Warm Springs. Selected as a \"Readers Choice\" site in Georgia Magazine nine times.\n\nFacilities\n\nLittle White House\n\nMemorial Museum & Film\n\nHistoric Pools Museum (closed for renovations from June 3)\n\nLegacy Exhibit\n\nEvent Room (seats 20) — call site to reserve\n\n3 Picnic Areas\n\nGuest Cottage\n\nServants Quarters\n\nThings To Do & See\n\nField Trips\n\nThe \"Unfinished Portrait\" - Newly Updated Exhibit(Read More)\n\nWalk of Flags & Stones\n\nEducational Programs\n\nTours\n\nMemorial Fountain\n\nGuest Quarters & Servants' Quarters\n\nScavenger Hunts Through History\n\nBirding\n\nPicnicking\n\nGeocaching\n\nGuided Tours\n\nTours of the Little White House are available on Saturday and Sunday at 10:00am for $20.00.
