        "text": "Year Country /\n\nRegion Election District/Race Margin\n\n(%) Margin\n\n(votes) Total votes\n\ncast for winner Description 1974 United States Senate New Hampshire 0.000901% 2 110,926[59] On election day, Republican Louis Wyman won with a margin of just 355 votes out of more than 220,000. His opponent John A. Durkin then won the recount by 10 votes. After a second recount, Wyman won by just 2 votes. The Democratic-controlled Senate at first agreed to seat Wyman, who served the last 3 days of Noris Cotton's term, but began to deliberate again when the new Senate took office. When the Senate deadlocked for months, Durkin agreed to Wyman's proposal for a new election. The Senate declared the seat vacant and the governor appointed Cotton to hold the seat for six weeks until a special election on September 16. Durkin won the special by 27,000 votes.[60] 1839 Massachusetts gubernatorial Governor of Massachusetts 0.00098% 1 51,034[61] Marcus Morton and the incumbent Whig Edward Everett received 51,034–50,725 votes respectively, with the remaining 307 votes went to scattering. The constitution of Massachusetts required a candidate to receive a majority of votes cast in order to win the office outright; otherwise, the legislature would have the authority to choose among the leading candidates. Morton exceeded this threshold by just 1 vote (50% of the 102,066 ballots cast), and had he not, the Whig controlled legislature would have been allowed to select the governor. The legislature could successfully deprive Morton of a majority if it disqualified the return from the town of Westfield. There was, moreover, an argument for doing so: the Westfield return was irregular and improper under the laws of the state because the attestation of its authenticity was not under seal. Instead, the return had been sealed first, and only afterward affixed with an attestation from the relevant local official. Despite pressure from partisans to contest this result, Everett refused. Historian and former Ohio Solicitor General Edward B. Foley notes: \"In the annals of American history there is not an equivalent example of a candidate in a major statewide election willing to forgo a victory so tantalizingly within reach based on, first, such a narrow margin and, second, such a readily available legal argument for invalidating disputed ballots.\"[62] 2020 United States House of Representatives Iowa's 2nd District 0.00152% 6 196,964 In the House election, Democrat Rita Hart lost by only 6 votes to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Unofficial results shortly after election day showed Miller-Meeks with a 282 vote lead. Official results, which included late-arriving absentee ballots and corrected canvassing errors, narrowed that lead to 44. A recount narrowed that vote still further to 6 votes. Hart chose not to appeal the election in the \"contest court\", arguing that Iowa law didn't allow enough time as from the November 30 certification date, the court would've had only 8 days to organize and then carry out the recount.[63] Instead she contested the election in the House of Representatives, asking for another recount, on the grounds that 22 votes were erroneously excluded due to poll worker error (and Iowa law had no way to remedy this) and that the recount was not done uniformly over the district.[64] Miller-Meeks was provisionally sworn in and requested the House Committee on Administration dismiss the contest, but that request was denied. On March 31, after several Democratic House members publicly stated that they wouldn't vote to change the result, Hart withdrew her contest.[65] It was the 2nd closest House race in US history and the closest since 1824. 1984 United States House of Representatives Indiana's 8th District 0.00171% 4 116,645 The initial count showed that Democrat Frank McCloskey had won by 72 votes, but Indiana's Republican Secretary of State refused to certify him pending a legal challenge by his Republican challenger Rick McIntyre.[66] After a tabulation error was found a month later McIntyre took the lead by 34 votes and was certified by the Secretary, even though a recount was on-going.[67] When the House opened it chose to seat neither person, but to pay them as though they were both members. The statewide recount was completed in late January and gave McIntyre a 418 vote lead, but against the Democratic-controlled House chose not to seat McIntyre, against the wishes of Republicans.[68] The House conducted their own recount, in which they made several controversial decisions, and seated McCloskey after declaring him the winner by just four votes. Republicans, who sought to declare the election void and call for a special election, staged a procedural protest and a walk out to protest what they viewed as a stolen seat.[69][70] 2013 Australian Senate Western Australia 0.002125% 1 23,532[71] Before senate electoral reform in 2016, the Australian senate was elected by a series of complex preference deals. At one point the next party to be eliminated was between the Shooters and Fishers Party and the Australian Christians. The margin was effectively one vote at that point in the count, and depending on which party was ahead either the Labor Party and PUP or the Sports Party and the Greens would have been elected.\n\nAs the recount was taking place it became apparent that there were some missing ballots, which was greater than the margin, so the election was voided and a re-run was conducted in 2014.[72]\n\n2023 Caddo Parish sheriff Sheriff of Caddo Parish 0.002312% 1 21,624 In the runoff election, Henry Whitehorn, a Democrat, defeated Republican John Nickelson by one vote. After a court challenge, the election was rerun; Whitehorn won again with a larger margin.[73] 1910 United States House of Representatives New York's 36th District 0.00242% 1 20,685 Charles Bennett Smith, a Democrat, defeated the incumbent, Representative De Alva S. Alexander, a Republican, by one vote, 20,685 to 20,684.[74] 1988 Massachusetts Governor's Council Democratic Primary 3rd District 0.00340% 1 14,716 Herbert L. Connolly lost to Robert B. Kennedy by one vote, and it was his own. Connolly arrived at his precinct a few minutes after the polls closed and wasn't able to vote. Kennedy won the following general.[75][76] 2003 Russian legislative Sverdlovsk Oblast District 163 0.00342% 5 73,083 Incumbent Georgy Leontyev held the seat by five votes,[77] despite allegations of vote manipulations, later rejected by the Supreme Court [78] 1919 Australian House of Representatives Ballarat 0.00369% 1 13,569 Edwin Kerby defeated incumbent MP Charles McGrath by a single vote. The result was voided by the Court of Disputed Returns, which criticised the \"almost incredible carelessness\" of the electoral officers. McGrath won the subsequent by-election.[79] 1997 United Kingdom general Winchester 0.00383% 2 26,100 In the General Election, Mark Oaten led Gerry Malone by 2 votes (26,100–26,098).[80] A total of 55 ballot papers were excluded from the count for want of official mark, of which 18 were votes in favor of Oaten and 22 in favor of Malone. Therefore, Malone would have had a majority of 2 votes had they been included in the count. On hearing an Election Petition in the High Court on 6 October 1997 Lord Justice Brooke and Mr. Justice Gage ordered that there should be a fresh election. The petition also stated that four voters cast tendered ballots after claiming to have been impersonated, but the impersonators could not be found and the allegation was not pursued.[81] In the subsequent by-election, Oaten easily beat Malone (37,006–15,450). 1992 Philippine Senate At-large 0.00398% 966 3,964,966 The Philippine Senate is elected via multiple non-transferable vote. The 24th placed candidate, Butz Aquino of LDP, edged out Alfredo Bengzon of Lakas to win out the last Senate seat. 1882 United States House of Representatives Virginia's 1st District 0.00476% 1 10,505 The initial tally had incumbent Democrat George T. Garrison up 70 votes on Readjuster challenger Robert M. Mayo. The Readjuster-controlled State Board of Canvassers then threw out the votes of Gloucester County and Hog Island precinct (Garrison had received all 14 votes from Hog Island). The new totals then had Mayo up one: 10,505–10,504. (A third candidate, the Republican John W. Woltz, received 168 votes).[82] Mayo was seated and served for a little over a year, but Garrison contested the result. The Committee of Elections then chose to accept the Gloucester County and Hog Island ballots and the House voted unanimously to seat Garrison.[83] 1868 United States House of Representatives North Carolina's 7th District 0.004841% 1 10,329 Plato Durham (D) was initially declared elected over Alexander H. Jones (R) with an 18-vote majority: 10,347–10,329. When Republicans began to complain of fraud, the votes were sent to General Canby at Charleston, who threw out enough for Jones to defeat Durham. Jones was then elected by 1 vote, 10,329–10,328.[84][85][86][87][88] 2004 Washington gubernatorial Governor of Washington 0.004842% 133 1,373,361[89] Democrat Christine Gregoire defeated Republican Dino Rossi, following two recounts, after the initial count and first recount showed Rossi as the winner. 2024 Indian general Mumbai North West 0.00503% 48 452,644 Ravindra Waikar (Shiv Sena) won with a 48-vote-lead against Amol Gajanan Kirtikar (Shiv Sena (UBT)).[90] 2024 Budapest local Mayor of Budapest 0.00524% 41 371,578 The candidate of the centre-left opposition candidate Gergely Karácsony defeated LMP candidate Dávid Vitézy who was backed by the Fidesz–KDNP alliance by 324 votes (0.0415%). Vitézy demanded a recount, asserting that a large portion of the ballots had been wrongfully deemed invalid. After recounting these ballots, the Hungarian National Election Office declared Karácsony the winner by a margin of 41 votes.[91][92] 1931 United Kingdom general Ilkeston 0.00569% 2 17,587 A.J. Flint (National Labour) gained the seat from George Oliver (Labour). After the polls closed it became clear that the Ilkeston election was very close. There were four recounts overnight, and the Returning Officer decided to call a halt in the early hours to return later in the day. At the end of the fifth recount, the Returning Officer declared Flint elected by a majority of two votes over the sitting Labour MP. This result remains the joint smallest majority in any individual constituency election since universal suffrage.[93] 2002 Irish general Limerick West 0.00584% 1 8,564[94][95] Going into the fourth (and final) count, sitting Fine Gael TD Dan Neville trailed his party colleague Michael Finucane, also an outgoing TD, 7,862 to 7,867 in the race for the third and final seat. He picked up 702 votes transferred from the eliminated candidates, six more than his opponent, to win by one vote. Finucane requested a recount, but when it became clear that the margin of his defeat would only increase, he requested the returning officer to terminate the recount, thus leaving the official margin of defeat at one vote. \"I am happy enough with the findings and I accept it. Democracy has spoken and I am sure there are many people out there feeling sorry at this stage that they didn't vote for me to tip me over the line.\"[96][97] 1854 United States House of Representatives Illinois' 7th District 0.00592% 1 8,452 On the initial tally, incumbent Democrat James C. Allen was ahead of challenger Republican William B. Archer by one vote: 8452–8451.\n\nArcher contested. Livingston precinct had initially certified Allen and Archer's votes as 47–100 (in that precinct). But they later certified that they had made a mistake and the vote (in that precinct) should instead have been 46–102. In which case the overall vote should have been 8,451–8,453.\n\nThe Committee of Elections concluded that Allen had won by at least 1 and probably 2 votes and recommended that he be seated. However, the House voted 94–90 that Allen was not qualified and also voted 91–89 that Archer would not be seated either. The seat was thus vacated.[98][99]\n\nA special election in 1856 was a rematch between Allen and Archer, and Allen soundly defeated Archer 13,081–10,136.[100]\n\n2000 South Korean legislature Gwangju 0.00614% 3 16,675 GNP Park Hyuk-kyu defeated MDP Moon Hak-jin by an official tally of 3-vote difference.[101] 1966 United Kingdom general Peterborough 0.00626% 3 23,944 Conservative Party incumbent Sir Harmar Nicholls defeated Labour Party challenger Michael Ward 23,944–23,941. Ward would again challenge and lose in 1970 and Feb 1974, but would win in Oct 1974. 1847 United States House of Representatives Indiana's 6th District 0.0067% 1 7,455 Whig George G. Dunn defeated Democrat David M. Dobson 7,455–7,454.[102] 2017 United Kingdom general North East Fife 0.00727% 2 13,743 Stephen Gethins of the Scottish National Party saw off a challenge by Elizabeth Riches of the Liberal Democrats to retain the seat of former leader Menzies Campbell.[103] 1962 Minnesota gubernatorial Governor of Minnesota 0.00734% 91 619,842 The vote count after election day had Governor Elmer L. Andersen in the lead by 142 votes. Then-Lieutenant Governor Karl Rolvaag went to court and won the right for a recount.[104] After the recount, it was determined that Rolvaag of the DFL had defeated Andersen, Republican, by 91 votes out of over 1.2 million cast. Rolvaag collected 619,842 votes to Andersen's 619,751. 2020 North Carolina Judicial Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court 0.00744% 401 2,695,951 Following a count, recount and hand-to-eye recount in 1% of precincts, Incumbent Chief Justice Cheri Beasley was defeated by Justice Paul Newby. The result meant that Republicans won all 8 statewide judicial races in the 2020 general election.[105] 1916 United States House of Representatives Iowa's 11th District 0.00768% 4 26,033 In the initial vote count, the sitting member Republican George C. Scott won by a majority of 131 votes, which Thomas J. Steele contested, alleging failure to count votes cast for the contestant and illegal counting of votes for the contestee. After a series of recounts, during which the lead switched back and forth and the contest was even tied at one point, the tally changed to 26,033–26,029 and after some legal wrangling (about lost ballots and votes by Iowa National Guardsmen serving at the Texas border), Scott was declared elected by the Democratically-controlled House.[106] 1991 Virginia House of Delegates District 53 0.00770% 1 6,493 After a recount, Jim Scott won by a single vote, earning him the nickname \"Landslide Jim\".[107] 2018 Kentucky House of Representatives 13th Representative District 0.0079% 1 6,319 In the initial count, Democrat Jim Glenn defeated Republican incumbent DJ Johnson by 1 vote, which was confirmed by a recanvass. Johnson filed for a recount, and Glenn was seated on January 8, 2019. The House later ordered another recount which was carried out over the weekend of January 30.[108][109] Following that recount, Glenn emerged as the winner by 3 votes, but then the County Board of Electors voted to reinstate one of the votes taken from Johnson earlier in the day and later to count five of 17 rejected absentee ballot. The result was a 6,323-6,323 tie.[110][111] On February 8, 2019, when Glenn threatened to sue if a coin toss were held and he lost, Johnson withdrew his challenge, thus settling the election.[112] 2014 North Carolina District Court District 5 0.00813% 5 30,746 Lindsey McKee Luther defeated Kent Harrell for North Carolina District Court, District 5 by five votes: 30,746–30,741.[113] 1974 United Kingdom general Carmarthen 0.00851% 3 17,165 Labour Party incumbent Gwynoro Jones defeated Plaid Cymru candidate Gwynfor Evans 17,165–17,162.[114] Jones had also beaten Evans in 1970, but would lose to Evans in Oct 1974. 2002 Washington House of Representatives Republican Primary 26th Legislative District 0.00852% 1 5,870 Ed Mitchell defeated Kevin Entze by one vote: 5,870–5,869.[115][116] Adding insult to injury, one of Entze's friends admitted that they never got their ballot mailed. \"He left his ballot on his kitchen counter and it never got sent out,\" Entze said.[117] Mitchell went on to narrowly lose the general election.[118] 1912 Kansas gubernatorial Governor of Kansas 0.00866% 29 167,437 George H. Hodges defeated the popular Republican Arthur Capper by a razor-thin margin of 29 votes out of 359,684 cast.[119][120][121] 1948 United States Senate Democratic Primary Runoff Texas 0.00880% 87 494,191 Lyndon B. Johnson is declared the winner over Coke R. Stevenson despite suspicion about 202 votes reported six days after the election from Precinct 13 of Jim Wells County. 1996 Vermont Senate Rutland County 0.00911% 2 10,978[122] There were six candidates for the three Rutland County Senate seats. On the night of the election, John H. Bloomer, Jr. and Cheryl M. Hooker received the first and second highest vote totals. Hull Maynard received the third highest total with 10,952 votes and Thomas Macaulay received the fourth highest total with 10,934 votes.\n\nMacaulay petitioned for a recount, whereupon the Rutland Superior Court determined that Maynard still beat Macaulay by two votes: 10,978–10,976. Macaulay's petition for further relief was dismissed by the Senate.[123][124][125]\n\n2000 United States presidential Florida 0.00921% 537 2,912,790 Republican George W. Bush was ahead of Democrat Al Gore after the initial count by 1,784 votes. After a mandatory statewide recount his lead was cut to 327.[126] After military and overseas ballots were added in, his lead increased to 930.[127] An additional hand recount was halted by the United States Supreme Court which resulted in the certified margin. Florida was the tipping point state for Bush's presidential victory. 2001 Italian Senate Marino 0.00929% 14 62,330 Olive Tree candidate Severino Lavagnini [it] was elected but the defeated House of Freedoms candidate won a seat via levelling seats. 1982 New Hampshire Senate District 8 0.00934% 1 5,352 Incumbent George Wiggins (R) defeated Fred Belair (D) by 1 vote.[128] 2010 United Kingdom general Fermanagh and South Tyrone 0.00939% 4 21,304 Michelle Gildernew (Sinn Féin) defeated independent Rodney Connor.[129] 2022 Connecticut House of Representatives District 81 0.00944% 1 10,593 Democrat Chris Poulos defeated Republican Tony Morrison by 1 vote.[130] 2022 California State Senate District 16 0.009495% 13 68,461 Democratic incumbent Melissa Hurtado defeated Republican David Shepard by 13 votes.[131] 1970 Missouri House of Representatives District 116 0.01037% 1 4,819 Both the initial count and a recount showed that incumbent Gus Salley (R-Warsaw) had defeated Morran D. Harris (D-Osceola), though a clerical error cost Salley 100 votes, indicating the real result was not nearly as close.[1] Harris brought the case to the House Election Committee to decide, but they chose not to overturn the results.[132] 1832 United States presidential Maryland 0.01044% 4 19,160 National Republican Henry Clay carried Maryland by four votes over Democratic President Andrew Jackson, but this is trivial since all of the electors were chosen based on the outcome in four districts. Had Jackson won the statewide vote it wouldn't have changed the electoral college vote.[133] 1910 United Kingdom general Exeter 0.0105% 1 4,777 Henry Duke (Conservative), the incumbent at the time of the general election, re-gained the seat from Harold St Maur (Liberal) on an election petition in 1911. The court changed the original result (under which the Liberal had won by four votes). The revised result was the smallest numerical majority in a UK Parliamentary election in the twentieth century.[134] 2015 Mississippi House of Representatives District 79 0.0109% 1 4,585 After Democratic incumbent Blaine Eaton tied Republican Mark Tullos with 4,589 votes each, he won re-election by drawing the long straw.[135] However, Tullos asked the State House to review the results, which they did, resulting in them throwing out five affidavit ballots for Eaton. The ballots were cast by people who had moved within 30 days prior to the election and hadn't updated their address. The vote that seated Tullos was largely a party-line vote and gave Republicans a super-majority.[136] Which five ballots were invalidated was never publicly stated, but they were all for Eaton and so the committee stopped evaluation the votes because even if the other four were for Tullos and also invalid, Tullos would still win by 1 vote. The final official count is unknown, and the count here is based on that decision.[137] 2022 Arizona general Arizona Attorney General 0.01116% 280 1,254,809 Democrat Kris Mayes originally defeated Republican Abraham Hamadeh by 511 votes, but after a recount, her lead narrowed to 280 votes.[138] 2001 Cape Verdean presidential President of Cape Verde 0.0112% 17 75,828[139] Pedro Pires (African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde) defeated Carlos Veiga (Movement for Democracy) in the second round of the election after neither won more than 50% in the first round.[140] 1924 United Kingdom general Leeds, West 0.0114% 3 13,057 Labour Party candidate Thomas Stamford defeated Conservative Party candidate A.F.G. Renton 13,057–13,054. This was the lowest margin of victory in a Leeds parliamentary election.[141] 1908 United States House of Representatives Massachusetts's 10th District 0.0121% 4 16,533[142] Representative Joseph F. O'Connell, a Democrat, defeated J. Mitchel Galvin, a Republican, by four votes, 16,553 to 16,549.[143] The record does not disclose the official returns, but a recount before a bipartisan board under the laws of Massachusetts gave O'Connell 16,553 votes, Galvin 16,549 votes, and two other candidates 1,380 and 1,187 votes, respectively, a plurality of 4 votes for Galvin, the sitting Member.[144] 1923 United Kingdom general Devon, Tiverton 0.0122% 3 12,303 Liberal Party incumbent Francis Dyke Acland defeated Conservative Party candidate Gilbert John Acland-Troyte 12,303–12,300. Acland had also defeated Acland-Troyte in the by-election earlier that same year, but Acland-Troyte would defeat Acland in 1924.[145] 1972 Canadian federal Ontario 0.0123% 4 16,328 Liberal incumbent Norman Cafik defeated Progressive Conservative Frank Charles McGee.[146] A PC win in this district would have resulted in a 108–108 tie with the Liberals in the overall seat count. 2006 Hungarian general election District 8 of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county 0.01263% 3 11,871[147] Socialist candidate Nándor Gúr defeated incumbent, conservative, Fidesz-candidate Oszkár Molnár by 9 votes. At Molnár's request, the Court decided to recount the votes and Gúr finally won by three votes.[148] 2018 Italian Chamber of Deputies Guidonia Montecelio 0.01269% 19 55,360 M5S candidate Sebastiano Cubeddu [it] defeated CDX candidate Barbara Saltamartini. 2008 United States Senate Minnesota 0.01287% 312 1,212,629 After the first count, Norm Coleman edged out Al Franken by 215 votes, but following a state mandated recount, Al Franken defeated Norm Coleman by 225.[149] Coleman contested the recount, after which Franken's lead grew to 312. After the Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously rejected Coleman's appeals, he conceded the race to Franken on June 30, 2009, 238 days after the election.[150] 1929 United Kingdom general Cheshire, Northwich 0.01292% 4 15,477 In this three-way race, Conservative Party incumbent Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart defeated Labour Party candidate Mrs. Barbara Ayrton-Gould 15,477–15,473. Chrichton-Stuart also defeated Mrs. Gould in 1924 and 1931.[151] 1994 United States House of Representatives Connecticut's 2nd district 0.0133% 21 79,188 In this three-way race between Democrat Sam Gejdenson, Republican Edward Munster, and Connecticut Party candidate David Bingham, the initial official tally was 79,169–79,167–27,729 (186,065 total votes).[152] Following a recount, Gejdenson and Munster were 79,160–79,156 with 186,030 total votes cast. The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled instead that the correct final tally was 79,188–79,167, awarding the seat to Gejdenson.[153] (However the Court did not mention what the correct total number of votes cast was.) Munster originally contested the election in the Republican-controlled House, but withdrew his contest citing the expense and time it would take.[154] 1964 Selangor State Legislative Assembly Kepong 0.0134% 2 7,487 Tan Chee Khoon, president of the Labour Party of Selangor, defeated the incumbent Chan Keong Hon of the Malaysian Chinese Association by two votes.[155] At the time Chan was a member of the state executive council. 2016 Vermont Senate Democratic Primary Washington County District 0.0135% 1 3,709 Superior Court Judge Timothy Tomasi determined that Francis K. Brooks defeated fourth-place finisher Ashley Hill by one vote in the Democratic primary for the three-member at-large Washington County district, 3,709 to 3,708.[156] The victory hinged on a disputed ballot from Worcester that Tomasi determined contained a vote for Brooks, but not one for Hill.[156] Brooks went on to finish third in the general election that fall, unseating longtime incumbent Republican Bill Doyle by 191 votes.[157] 1968 South Australian House of Assembly Seat of Millicent 0.0138% 1 3,635[158] On 2 March 1968, Martin Cameron contested the seat of Millicent for the House of Assembly, standing against the sitting member, and minister in the Labor Cabinet, Des Corcoran. Narrowly losing the seat by one vote (3635–3634), the Liberal and Country League challenged the decision and the election was referred to the South Australian Court of Disputed Returns. The court ordered a by-election, which was held on 22 June. This was won comfortably by Corcoran (3994–3564), the Dunstan-led Australian Labor Party running the campaign on electoral reform.[159] 1930 Canadian federal Yamaska 0.0143% 1 3,505 Liberal incumbent Aimé Boucher defeated Conservative Paul-François Comtois.[160] The riding result was later declared void, and Boucher won the by-election in 1933 by 84 votes (0.1%). 1968 Canadian federal Leeds 0.01478% 4 13,536 Progressive Conservative Desmond Code defeated Liberal incumbent John Matheson.[161] 1945 United Kingdom general Worcester 0.01479% 4 13,523 In this three-way race, Conservative Party candidate George Ward defeated Labour Party/Co-operative Party candidate J.

The margin had been initially reported as 11 votes, but was reduced to 9 votes after a formal recount.[163] 1949 Canadian federal Annapolis—Kings 0.0152% 4 13,202 Liberal Angus Alexander Elderkin defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent George Nowlan.[164] 2020 Florida State Senate District 37 0.01529% 32 104,630 After the initial tally, challenger Ileana Garcia led incumbent Jose Javier Rodriguez by 21 votes. An automatic hand recount extended that lead to 32 votes. The race was marred by fraud as a 3rd party candidate, also with the last name Rodriquez, received more than 6000 votes after being funded by a mysterious donor who funded an ad campaign that seemed designed to confuse voters.[165] A few months after the election the candidate, Alex Rodríguez, pleaded guilty to accepting illegal campaign donations and lying on campaign documents and agreed to testify against former Sen. Frank Artiles who had been charged with felony campaign fraud charges in March 2021.[166] 1968 Wisconsin House of Representatives District 25 0.01533% 2 6,523 Official count showed a margin of 3 vote for Joseph L. Looby (D) over Wilmer R. Waters (R), but it was 1 after a recount. A case was filed with the circuit court, where the judge declared the margin was two votes. An election committee investigated, but could make no proclamation of the true margin. After Waters appealed to the Republican controlled assembly, it voted unanimously to seat Looby.[1][167] 2002 Connecticut House of Representatives District 65 0.0155% 1 3,236 Republican Anne Ruwet defeated Democrat John S. Kovaleski by one vote (3,236–3,235).[168] 1922 United States House of Representatives New York's 21st District 0.0156% 10 32,089 Sitting Member Royal H. Weller had been returned by an official plurality of 245 votes, which the contestant Martin C. Ansorge contested. Following a recount, the tally was 32,089–32,079 and Weller was declared elected.[169] 1964 United Kingdom general Brighton Kemptown 0.0157% 7 22,308 Labour Party challenger Dennis Hobden defeated incumbent Conservative Party David James 22,308–22,301.[170] 2022 2022 North Carolina state legislature Republican primary North Carolina House of Representatives District 115 0.0159% 1 3,146 After a hand-eye recount that added one vote to his total, Pratik Bhakta defeated Sherry M. Higgins.[171] 1870 United States House of Representatives Indiana's 4th District 0.0159% 4 12,561 Republican Jeremiah M. Wilson defeated Democrat David S. Gooding by 4 votes: 12561–12557.[172] Gooding contested. The Committee's majority report gave Wilson a \"clear legal majority of 8\", while the minority report gave Gooding a majority of 17. The US House then voted 105–64 (71 abstentions) \"on strictly party lines\" to reject the minority report, accept the majority report, and thereby seat Wilson.[173][174][175] 1950 Maryland Senate Garrett County 0.0162% 1 3,080 Republican incumbent Neil C. Fraley defeated Democratic challenger Bernard I. Gonder by one vote: 3,080–3,079.[176][177][178][179] Gonder contested the result but to no avail.[180] 1983 United Kingdom general Leicester South 0.0163% 7 21,424 Conservative Party challenger Derek Spencer defeated Labour Party incumbent Jim Marshall 21,424–21,417. 2004 Kelantan State Legislative Assembly Kemuning 0.01646% 2 6,078 The Kemuning state constituency was shifted east in the 2004 redelineation, absorbing most of the abolished Banggol Judah constituency. Incumbent Banggol Judah assemblyman Zakaria Yaacob retained the seat for PAS by two votes against UMNO candidate Wan Mohamad Zin Mat Amin, 6,078–6,076. Crucially, this allowed PAS to maintain control of the Kelantan assembly throughout the term as it won 24 seats to UMNO's 22, and UMNO subsequently cut PAS' margin to one seat by winning the 2005 Pengkalan Pasir by-election. 1988 Canadian federal London—Middlesex 0.0165% 8 18,534 Progressive Conservative MP Terry Clifford narrowly edged out Liberal Garnet Bloomfield.[181] 2005 Virginia General Virginia Attorney General 0.01663% 323 970,886 Bob McDonnell was certified as the victor over Creigh Deeds following a recount.[182] 1988 Massachusetts Governor's Council Democratic Primary 3rd District 0.0170% 5 14,709 In the recount, Robert B. Kennedy led Herbert Connolly by one vote: 14,716–14,715.[183] (Connolly had actually failed to vote for himself.)[184] In the recount, Kennedy again led by one vote: 14,691–14,690. Connolly contested the result. The Supreme Judicial Court considered 116 contested votes and decided ultimately that Kennedy won by five votes: 14,709–14,704.[185] 1829 United States House of Representatives Kentucky's 2nd District 0.0179% 1 5,591 Jacksonsian candidate Nicholas D. Coleman defeated Adams candidate Adam Beatty 2520–2519.[186] 2018 Pakistani general Mardan-II 0.0181% 35 78,911 Awami National Party's Ameer Haider Hoti defeated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's Atif Khan 78,911-78,876.[187] 2011 Canadian federal Montmagny—L'Islet—Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup 0.0189% 9 17,285 Conservative incumbent Bernard Généreux was initially declared the winner by 311 votes. Subsequently, the returning officer determined that approximately 300 votes for the New Democratic candidate, François Lapointe, had been allocated to the Green Party candidate in error. After the correction, Lapointe was declared elected by 5 votes, prompting an automatic judicial recount. As a result of this recount, Lapointe was confirmed as the victor over Généreux by 9 votes, 17,285-17,276.[188] 1936 United States House of Representatives New Hampshire's 1st District 0.0193% 20 51,702 After the initial count, Republican Arthur B. Jenks was declared the winner by 550 votes, however a recount left the vote tied at 51,690 votes each. Both parties contested ballots, 108 in total, to the state ballot-law commission which after ruling on each determined that Alphonse Roy had won 51,695-51,678. After those hearings were over, Jenks argued that there was a 36 ballot discrepancy between those cast and those counted in Newton. The ballot-law commission called for another recount, finding the count was now 51,702 to 51,678, but also that 34 ballots were missing and that they should be awarded to Jenks making him the winner by 10 votes. Roy contested, and though Jenks wasn't sworn in until 2 days after Congress met, he did take office. During Roy's contest the majority of the Committee on Elections found that though there was a discrepancy between the ballots and the tally sheet, there was no evidence that any ballots had disappeared due to fraud or mistake and that in such a conflict the ballots should be considered the best evidence of the votes cast; and they found that four additional ballots should be awarded to Jenks raising his total to 51,682. The minority of the committee argued that they could establish both by testimony and the tally sheets that more people had voted in Newton than there were ballots to count; that in every race in Newton Republicans had lost 34 votes in the recount and Democrats had lost zero; and that the number of ballots (used and unused) returned to the state was 34 lower than what was sent. In the end the Democratically-controlled House decided to accept the majority's position, and on June 9, 1938 Jenks was removed from office and Roy was seated. Jenks then won election five months later and served until 1943.[189][190] 2003 Somaliland presidential President of Somaliland 0.0195% 80 205,595 Dahir Riyale Kahin, of the For Unity, Democracy, and Independence party narrowly defeated the Peace, Unity, and Development Party's Ahmed M.

But during the recount, a Hughes County judge threw out four votes for Nemecek when it was discovered the voters who cast the contested ballots were not registered to vote in the district. Though Nemecek argued that the straight-party option was confusing and voter intent was clear on some ballots that were not counted for him, Thomsen was declared the winner and sworn in.[193][194][195] 2004 Commonwealth's Attorney Special Election Radford District 0.0211% 1 2,375 Chris E.

Phillip Reed, who like Cosden was a Democratic-Republican, contested the election. The House decided that the Governor and Council were not allowed to choose a winner; that two votes for Reed that were excluded ought to count and that one that was counted for him was illegal.

That amendment ended the three-fifths rule effectively raising the population of states that once had slavery. As a result, South Carolina and other slave states tried to seat extra members of Congress. South Carolina choose two additional congress members during at-large election. In one of those, Johann Peter Martin Epping defeated Lucius W. Wimbush by 61 votes: 71,803–71,742. But the House refused to seat him and the other at-large winner. \"A number of southern states upon readmission claimed that since their slaves were emancipated, they were entitled to larger delegations in the House. Epping's election falls in this category. The claims were rejected by the House.\"[274][275][276][277] 1995 Queensland Legislative Assembly Mundingburra 0.04301% 16 18,600 General election saw return of Australian Labor Party MP Ken Davies over his Liberal Party rival, Frank Tanti, after distribution of preferences of minor candidates, by just 16 votes. However due to the non-arrival of some overseas military ballots, a Court of Disputed Returns required a fresh election, at which Tanti won. As this seat was the difference between a Labor Party majority and a Liberal Party supported by an Independent MP, the overturning of the result was a rare example of the fate of an entire government resting on a challenge to an ultra-close constituency. 2014 Parliament of South Australia Fisher state by-election 0.04371% 9 10,299 By-election caused by the death of sitting independent MP Bob Such.

In 1838, New Jersey had six seats and so each voter could vote for six candidates. The voting for the parties was very close and at first it appeared that all 6 Whig candidates had been re-elected and their election was certified by the Whig governor who applied the states \"broad seal\" to them. The Democrats contested the election on the grounds that the votes of two townships were excluded and that if included would've swung the election and this became known as the \"Broad Seal War\". The House, which held a 2-seat majority without the NJ delegation, decided to seat one of the Whigs but leave the other 5 seats vacant. After the contest was investigated, and the excluded votes counted, 5 of the 6 Democrats were declared winners. They were seated in July 1840. In the end only 197 votes separated the Democrat's best finisher from the Whig's worst. Charles C. Stratton came in 7th, only 31 votes behind Democrat Joseph Kille a difference of only 0.05455%.

On a recount, they were tied, with one mailed-in military vote for Buxton rejected. Buxton appealed and the Superior Court ruled that vote valid, so that Buxton still won by one vote (881–880). Ainsworth then appealed but the House voted along party lines to uphold Buxton's one-vote victory.[125][317][318] Remarkably, their fourth matchup in 2016 would again be decided by one vote, but with the result reversed. 2012 United States presidential Iowa Republican caucuses 0.0570% 34 29,839 Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum defeated former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the statewide Republican caucuses, the closest GOP primary election in United States history.[319] Romney had been declared the winner by 8 votes on caucus night. 1930 Kansas gubernatorial Governor of Kansas 0.0576% 251 217,171 Harry H.

The Electoral Commission took longer than expected to declare a winner, in part due to the closeness of the election and in part due to an incident in which a member of the NPP stole a ballot box which had to be inspected.[331] This result led to a hung parliament as a single independent prevented either party from reaching a majority of seats (although the lone independent decided to vote with the NPP).[332] 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary 184th constituency (Nova Kakhovka) 0.0607% 22 18,123 In a first-past-the-post race with 9 candidates, he Party of Regions candidate Mykola Dmytruk defeated an independent Ivan Vynnyk 18,123 (19.99%)–18,101 (19.96%).

The ballots were received on time and the barcode proved they were mailed prior to the election, as required by law, but the barcode used on the disputed ballot differed from the postage stamp or “intelligent mail barcode\" called for by the Iowa Code and administrative rules. After a district judge declined to decide if the ballots should be counted, Koether petitioned the Iowa House to settle the matter.

The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 in favor of calling a new statewide election for the seat over calling a new election in Carteret County alone; 4 votes would have been required to take action on either option. In early December, the North Carolina Board of Elections ordered a new election for January 11, 2005, in Carteret County alone, for voters whose ballots had been lost or who had not voted in the November 2 election. Both candidates appealed the decision, Cobb arguing that a statewide revote should be held, Troxler arguing that a revote should be limited to those voters whose votes were lost. A Wake County superior court judge overturned this decision on December 17, calling it \"arbitrary and capricious\" and \"contrary to law,\" requiring the State Board of Elections to revisit the issue. On December 29, the State Board of Elections ordered a new statewide election for the post. On January 13, 2005, the superior court invalidated this order as well, and sent the contest back to the Elections Board for resolution. Following this ruling, Cobb chose to concede defeat rather than continue a court battle with no clear way to resolve the issue. On February 4, the State Board of Elections officially certified Troxler as the winner of the 2004 election. 1930 United States House of Representatives Missouri's 3rd District 0.0704% 46 32,669 According to the returns as originally certified, incumbent Jacob L.

Subsequent action awarded it back.[391] 1974 United States Senate North Dakota 0.0771% 177 114,852 Five-term Republican U.S. Senator Milton Young defeated former Democratic Governor William Guy by 177 votes out of 237,000 cast.[392][393] 1990 Massachusetts House of Representatives 7th Worcester 0.0780% 13 8,341 Democrat Paul Kollios defeated Independent Alan M. Tuttle.[394] 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial Governor of New Jersey 0.0784% 1,797 1,145,999 The results of the initial ballot counting was close with Kean leading Florio by 1,677 votes. A recount took place over the next month and Kean was certified the winner besting Florio by 1,797 votes out of over 2.3 million votes cast. 1922 United Kingdom general South Shields 0.0794% 25 15,760 In this three-way race, Liberal Party candidate Edward Harney defeated Labour Party William Lawther 15,760–15,735.[395] 2013 New Jersey General Assembly District 2 0.07954% 40 25,164 Democrat Vince Mazzeo defeated incumbent Republican John F. Amodeo after a recount.[396] 1922 United States Senate Delaware 0.0812% 60 36,954 Democratic attorney Thomas Bayard defeated appointed U.S. Senator T. Coleman DuPont by 60 votes out of 74K+ votes cast in a special election. Bayard simultaneously defeated DuPont by 0.43 points in the election to the seat for the unexpired six-year term.[393] 2015 Santa Fe gubernatorial Governor of Santa Fe 0.0813% 1,496 584,017 Miguel Lifschitz (584,017 votes) defeated Miguel del Sel (582,521 votes) and Omar Perotti (558,571 votes). 1990 New Hampshire House of Representatives Hillsborough 40 District 0.0818% 4 2,448 Robert Murphy (D) defeated Kathleen Souza (R) by 4 votes.[398] 2018 Illinois House of Representatives 54th District 0.0823% 37 22,484 Tom Morrison (R) defeated Maggie Trevor (D) by 37 votes.[399] 1916 United States House of Representatives Michigan's 2nd District 0.0868% 46 26,530 The initial count for this House seat gave the win to Republican Mark R. Bacon by a margin of 49 votes. However his opponent, Democrat Samuel Beakes, discovered that canvassers had failed to include more than 70 ballots and those ballots were then counted which gave Beakes the lead by 46 votes. Bacon argued that the ballot boxes were not safely preserved and so any new ballots should be considered void. The local and state election boards felt unable to rule and the State Supreme Court was unwilling to call for a recount, so Beakes contested the election in the House where Bacon had been seated. The Democratically-controlled House, which had a 3 seat majority at the time, ruled that the new ballots should be counted and they replaced Bacon with Beakes.[246] 1984 United States House of Representatives Idaho's 2nd District 0.08399% 170 7,637 The first count showed that Richard H. Stallings had defeated the incumbent Republican George V. Hansen by 133 votes. A partial recount upped that margin to 170. Hansen, who in the spring prior to the election had been convicted of filing false financial disclosure statements, contested the election arguing that illegally registered voters were allowed to vote and that he was denied a full recount. A review by the Idaho Attorney General determined that no unqualified persons voted and that the partial recount did not show enough material differences for a full recount to change the outcome, so the House dismissed his contest.[189] 1972 Canadian federal Selkirk 0.08400% 30 17,872 New Democrat incumbent Doug Rowland defeated Progressive Conservative Dean Whiteway.[146] 1966 Massachusetts House of Representatives 2nd Bristol 0.08436% 28 16,609 Democrat Edward P. Coury defeated fellow Democrat Ronald Anthony Pina.[401] 1924 United States Senate Iowa 0.08439% 755 447,706 Smith Brookhart won the election by 755 votes and was initially seated in the Senate without incident. After Brookhart was seated, Steck contested the election results. The investigation and recount took longer than a year, but on April 12, 1926 by a vote of 45–41, the Senate overturned the election results and gave the seat to Steck. This was the first time the Senate voted to overturn an election after the winner was seated.[393][402][403] The recount was contentious with claims of fraud and destroyed ballots, and with the special subcommittee inspecting each discarded ballot to determine voter intent. In the end the fact that Democrats wanted Steck elected and Republicans wanted to punish Brookhart for failing to support Coolidge, partisan politics likely did him in.[404] 1974 Massachusetts House of Representatives Democratic Primary 41st Middlesex 0.08443% 3 1,778 Frank A. Antonelli topped Joseph Whelan by 3 votes and then lost the general election. He would win the nomination two more times and seek it two more than that, but never win the seat.[405] 1978 United States House of Representatives South Dakota's 1st District 0.08512% 110 64,683 Democrat Tom Daschle looked to have lost on election night, but an official canvas gave him a 6 vote margin.[406] The final tally gave him a 14 vote lead and a recount increased that to 105. Daschle was seated and his opponent Leo Thorsness appealed the recount in state court. A review of 1,084 contested ballots increased Daschle's lead to 110 votes, though a final count of the vote was not reported. Thorsness then contested the election in the House, but the case was dismissed as the House was satisfied with the count of the Iowa court and found no grounds to change the results.[189] 2015 United Kingdom general Gower 0.08518% 27 15,862 Labour candidate Liz Evans was defeated by the Conservative Byron Davies by 27 votes, less than 0.1% of votes cast, which made it the most marginal Conservative seat going into the next election. Davies' victory brought 105 consecutive years of Labour representation to an end, but Labour won the seat back in the 2017 general election with a majority of 3,269. 1858 United States House of Representatives New York's 9th District 0.0852% 13 7,637 Anti-Administration Democrat John B. Haskin defeated Democrat Gouverneur Kemble, 7,637–7,624. A third candidate Edward A. Andrews won 545 votes.[407][408] 1998 Massachusetts House of Representatives 1st Plymouth 0.0858% 11 6,417 Republican Vinny M. deMacedo defeated Democrat Joseph R. Gallitano.[409] 2018 Pakistani general Kasur-IV 0.0860% 249 124,644 Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's Talib Hassan Nakai defeated Pakistan Muslim League-N's Rana Muhammad Hayat 124,644-124,395.[410] 1977 Vermont House of Representatives Windham-4 District 0.087% 1 572 On election night, Democrat Robert Emond was declared the victor over incumbent Republican Sydney Nixon by one vote. Nixon then petitioned for a recount in Windham Superior Court under the provisions of 17 V.S.A. § 1361. The recount committee in that court found Nixon to be the winner by one vote and the court gave him a certificate of election.\n\nHowever, a House committee did its own recount and found Emond to be the winner by one vote (572–571 according to one site[411]). Rather than force the full House to vote on the recount report, Nixon simply resigned, thereby giving Emond the win.[125][412][413][414][415]\n\n(Note that the year of this contested election is incorrectly given by many sites as 1997.)\n\n2000 Canadian federal Laval Centre 0.08851% 42 23,746 Bloc Québécois MP Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral narrowly edged out Liberal Pierre Lafleur.[252] 2012 French legislative Eure second constituency 0.08928% 39 21,860 Socialist Jean-Louis Destans defeated incumbent Jean-Pierre Nicolas[416] 1846 United States House of Representatives New Jersey's 3rd District 0.0895% 16 8,942 John Runk and Isaac G. Farlee 8,942–8,926 votes.[417] There was a dispute over whether some 36 Princeton students' votes were legal due to residency. The majority of the committee investigating the contest chose to consider them as residents and the minority that they were not, which they estimated would have given Farlee the win by 3 votes. The full House voted that Farlee was ineligible and then voted on a resolution to remove Runk too and declare the seat vacant. The vote on Runk was a tie, broken by the Speaker in Runk's favor.[418] 1880 United States presidential California 0.08960% 144 80,426 Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock took advantage of the opposition to Chinese immigration for the first Democratic win in California since 1856, but narrowly lost the electoral vote and the popular vote to Garfield.[419] The US presidential election is not decided by popular vote, but Garfield won the national popular vote by only 1,898 votes or 0.0213%.[a] 1908 United States presidential Missouri 0.09066% 629 347,203 William Howard Taft wins a comfortable first term but takes Missouri by fewer than a thousand votes.[427] 1932 United States House of Representatives Connecticut's 5th District 0.0926% 78 42,132 Republican Edward W. Goss defeated his challenger Martin Gormley by 78 votes. Gormley challenged the election in the House of Representatives arguing that \"fraud, irregularities, corruption, and deceit\" at a voting booth in Waterbury had cost him the votes to win. The House investigation showed confusion at the polling place, but no recorded complaints and inadequate evidence to overturn the election.[189] 2000 United States Senate Washington 0.09301% 2,229 1,199,437[428] Democrat Maria Cantwell unseated Republican Slade Gorton following a mandatory recount.[429] 1961 Virginia House of Delegates District 66 0.09323% 5 2,684 James B.

Newland contested the race and a review of ballots by the House gave the election to Newland by 12 votes, but the House ignored the committee's recommendation to replace Graham with Newland and voted 100-99 to instead vacate the seat.[45][434] A special election was held in the summer of 1836 which Graham won easily. 1976 United States House of Representatives Illinois's 10th District 0.0941% 201 106,804 Democrat Abner V. Mikva was declared the winner by 201 votes. Following a discovery recount and the failure to get a judicial recount, Republican Samuel H. Young contested the election arguing that there were election irregularities or errors. The Committee on House Administration decided that there Young had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims and awarded the seat to Mikva. The election was a rematch of the 1974 race, and in that race Young had also contested the election to the House claiming fraud and violations of the law and that case was also dismissed for lack of evidence.[189] 1848 United States House of Representatives Ohio's 10th District 0.0947% 16 8,454 Democrat Charles Sweetzer defeated Whig Daniel Duncan 8,454–8,438.[435] 1962 Canadian federal St. John's West 0.09495% 24 12,650 Liberal Richard Cashin defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent William Joseph Browne.[436] 1857 United States House of Representatives Connecticut's 4th District 0.0953% 16 8,403 Democrat William D.

A recount was held in which more than 4,000 ballots were disputed. Hale sued for a certificate, which the Governor first refused and then issued after asking the Supreme Court of Maine for decisions on matters of law. James Oliver, his opponent, then contested the election in the House. After a review of the disputed ballots, the House Committee ruled that Hale had won by a vote of 58,024-57,913.[439] 1922 United Kingdom general Nottingham, Central 0.0959% 22 11,481 Liberal Party candidate Reginald Berkeley defeated Conservative Party incumbent Albert Atkey 11,481–11,459.
