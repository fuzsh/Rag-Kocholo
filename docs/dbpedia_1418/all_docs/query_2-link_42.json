that these minutes, and their Republican counterparts, be edited for publication. The discussions they contain tell a great deal about the development of our party's organization during these formative decades from before World War I to the mid-1960s. I am delighted to have played a role in making these minutes available and hope they will prove a source of illumination to my colleagues, to scholars, and to the American people. Thomas A. Daschle Senate Democratic Leader and Chairman, Democratic Conference PREFACE These conference minutes add significantly to our knowledge of the Senate's institutional development during the first two-thirds of the twentieth century. Their publication, on the unanimous recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress, serves as a further demonstration of the Senate's desire to open its historical records in a timely and useful manner. As the Senate officer responsible for preserving and making publicly available this body's noncurrent records, I take particular pleasure in this volume's release. Over the past five years, the Senate Historical Office, operating under the Secretary of the Senate's supervision, has carefully transcribed, annotated, edited, and indexed the minutes of both party conferences. Special thanks go to my predecessors Walter J. Stewart and Kelly D. Johnston for coordinating this project with the Senate's party leaders, and to party secretaries Elizabeth B. Greene and Martin P. Paone for their generous cooperation. Within the Senate Historical Office, I wish to acknowledge Senate Historian Richard A. Baker, who has resolutely advocated this enterprise almost since his appointment in 1975, and to Associate Historian Donald A. Ritchie and Historical Editor Wendy Wolff, the two professional staff members who did the hard work of transcribing, editing, and annotating. Wendy Wolff also prepared the detailed index that greatly enhances this work's reference value. Gary Sisco Secretary of the Senate INTRODUCTION The Development of Senate Party Caucuses The authors of the United States Constitution did not anticipate political parties and therefore made no provisions for political organizations within Congress. Yet party caucuses--meetings open only to members of the same party--emerged early in the histories of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and over time became the ``fountainhead'' of political power in Congress. Caucuses, later called conferences, took responsibility for choosing party candidates for such officers of the Senate as the president pro tempore, the chaplain, the secretary of the Senate, and the sergeant at arms. They also selected the majority and minority leaders and whips, the policy committees, steering committees, and members of all the standing and special committees. Depending upon the particular time, the issues, the incumbent president, the inclinations of the leadership, and the party's numerical strength, caucuses have attempted to maintain party unity and promote the party's program. 1 ``Caucus'' derived from an Algonquian Indian word for counselors. Before the American Revolution, secret caucuses within the colonial legislatures plotted opposition to British-appointed governors. By the time the First Congress met in 1789, the term ``caucusing'' had become a commonplace expression for any private conference of likeminded legislators. Between 1796 and 1836, formal congressional caucuses nominated candidates for president of the United States--until protests against ``King Caucus'' led to the convening of national party conventions. Less regularly during these early congresses, party caucuses met to plan strategy dealing with legislation, nominations, and treaties. When the Jeffersonian Republicans won control of Congress in 1800, the Federalist minority accused the majority of trying to reconcile their differences in caucuses before debating anything in public, thereby treating the minority as ``nullities.'' When legislation dealing with the purchase of Louisiana reached the Senate, a Federalist senator complained that ``the democratic senators held a Caucus last evening in which they settled the principles of the bill--and agreed to the same in the Senate without any debate.'' 2 Caucus innovations generally emerged from the majority party and were later adopted by the minority. Prior to the Civil War, when Democrats more often held the majority, the Democratic caucus originated the practice of submitting slates of names of its members for committee assignments (rather than have the Senate as a whole elect committee members as was the practice before 1846). Republicans gained the majority during the Civil War and held it for most of the remainder of the nineteenth century. During this era, Republican senators made their party caucus a vehicle for scheduling legislation on the floor, a function that they eventually assigned to a steering committee within the caucus. Republicans also established a committee on committees to make party assignments to the standing committees. Senate Democrats adopted similar committees during the two congresses in which they held the majority between the Civil War and the end of the century. By contrast, in the twentieth century Democrats held the majority more frequently than Republicans. During this time, the Democratic Conference invented such offices as the majority leader and whip, which in turn were adopted by the Republicans. 3 Senators have also attempted to exert party discipline through their caucuses. In December 1858, the Democratic caucus voted to remove Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas as chairman of the Committee on Territories, because of his opposition to President James Buchanan's plans for the organization of the Kansas territory. Similarly, in 1871, the Senate Republican caucus deposed Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, after he opposed President U.S. Grant's plans to annex Santo Domingo. Senator Sumner had also refused to acknowledge that his party caucus could limit the topics for consideration on the floor or tie senators' hands in advance. Nevertheless, by 1900 the two party caucuses controlled both committee assignments and calendars and imposed what one scholar has called ``unprecedented discipline'' on roll-call votes. 4 The progressive reform movement at the opening of the twentieth century had a significant impact on the congressional caucuses. Suspicious of any exercise of power in secret meetings, the progressives discredited the term ``caucus,'' which increasingly came to be replaced by ``conference.'' Republicans officially designated their meetings as conferences in January 1913, while the Democrats switched from caucus to conference more informally. Although the two terms continue to be used interchangeably, ``caucus'' came to refer to those attempts at binding the party's vote, while ``conference'' referred to the election of officers and the general discussions of legislative business. 5 For instance, on April 19, 1916, while debating a tariff on sugar, Nevada Senator Francis G. Newlands asked whether the meeting was a conference or a caucus--that is, whether those participating in the meeting were to be bound by its actions. The chairman declared the meeting to be a conference and explained that it would not ``assume the character of a caucus'' unless two-thirds of the Democratic senators first voted to make the question ``a party question.'' At that point, Georgia Senator Thomas W. Hardwick rose to state that unless the caucus coerced him he would ``use every means in his power'' to prevent the Senate from adopting the House version of the bill. But Hardwick added that if bound by the caucus he would ``submit to such vote as a good party man.'' A keen observer of the caucus' potential was the political scientist Woodrow Wilson. In his book, Congressional Government, published in 1885, Wilson had argued that ``No one is the Senator. No one may speak for his party as well as for himself; no one exercises the special trust of acknowledged leadership.'' However, by 1908, in his study Constitutional Government in the United States, Wilson had identified the chairman of the majority caucus as the leader of the Senate: ``Each party in the Senate finds its real, its permanent, its effective organization in its caucus, and follows the leadership, in all important political battles, of the chairman of that caucus, its organization and leadership alike resting upon arrangements quite outside the Constitution, for which there is no better and no other sanction than human nature.'' 6 The Democratic Conference, 1903-1964 Democrats held the majority from 1879 to 1881, and again from 1893 to 1895. In 1894, Maryland Senator Arthur Pue Gorman, as chair of the Democratic caucus, concluded that without an effective caucus ``we should have passed through the session with divisions as wide upon this side as it is possible to conceive of within a party.'' Perhaps because of their long years in the minority, Democrats had concentrated their party leadership more than did the Republicans, allowing their caucus chairman to head both the Steering Committee and Committee on Committees (during their years in the minority these committees were merged). In 1898, Gorman was defeated for reelection, but he returned to the Senate in March 1903, and once again was elected caucus chairman. Seeking further stability in their party organization, Democrats at that time adopted a ``binding'' rule by which members agreed to support any issue that received a two-thirds vote in the caucus. At the same time, Gorman began keeping regular minutes of the caucus proceedings. During the years that the Democrats remained in the minority, prior to 1913, Senate committee assignments and patronage issues initially predominated on the conference agenda.7 In 1912, Wilson won election as the Democratic candidate for president of the United States, and Democrats won the majority in both the Senate and House. Putting his theories into practice, Wilson was determined to make his party ``a disciplined instrument'' to enact his New Freedom program. He worked closely with the Democratic caucus to forge his legislative agenda within his party, rather than seek coalitions with progressive Republicans. The Senate Democratic caucus elected the progressive-minded freshman Senator John Worth Kern as its chairman and its de facto majority leader--although he never held that title officially. Kern called regular meetings of the caucus, particularly to debate the tariff, long a defining issue for the Democratic party. The caucus played a similar role in shaping legislation creating the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Trade Commission, the pillars of Wilson's ``New Freedom'' program.8 Kern was defeated for reelection in 1916, and Senate Democratic leadership reverted to the senior party member, Thomas S. Martin, a conservative Virginia Democrat, and caucus meetings were held less frequently. The ``binding'' rule was revived in 1917, to promote party unity in enacting the Senate's first cloture rule to limit debate during filibusters. Wilson had been angered when a band of antiwar senators, whom he dubbed a ``little group of willful men,'' filibustered legislation to permit the arming of American merchant ships prior to U.S. entry into the First World War. The new rule permitted debate to be cut off by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. In subsequent decades, filibusters were most frequently employed to block the passage of civil rights legislation, and the Democratic caucuses would confront the difficult issue of further liberalizing the cloture rule.9 After the frequent meetings called under Senator Kern's leadership, the Democratic Conference was convened far less often during the long and dynamic tenure of Arkansas Senator Joseph T. Robinson. Minority leader from 1923 to 1933, and majority leader from 1933 to his death in 1937, Robinson called conferences only at the beginning of sessions to elect officers and conduct routine business. In 1928, however, he used a vote of the Conference to support his leadership against attack from Alabama's fiery Senator Thomas Heflin. On March 6, 1933, when the Democrats retook the majority after fourteen years in the minority, and with the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ready to tackle the crisis of the Great Depression, Majority Leader Robinson attempted to restore the binding caucus rule that the Wilson administration had used so effectively a generation earlier: RESOLVED, That until further ordered the Chairman is authorized to convene Democratic Senators in caucus for the purpose of considering any measure recommended by the President; and that all Democratic Senators shall be bound by the vote of the majority of the caucus; Provided that any Senator may be excused from voting for any such measure upon his express statement to the caucus that said measure is contrary to his conscientious judgment or that said measure is in violation of pledges made to his constituents as a candidate. However, Louisiana's independent-minded Senator Huey Long immediately insisted that he would not be bound by any caucus. Other senators also asserted that they would vote their own consciences regardless of caucus rulings. Robinson retreated and thereafter used the Conference sparingly. Increasingly larger Democratic majorities in the Senate also relieved Robinson of the burden of maintaining party unity through the Conference. Robinson's successor as majority leader, Alben Barkley of Kentucky, similarly refrained from calling many party meetings. Although Barkley ostensibly led the largest majority in modern history, Senate Democratic ranks had divided sharply in response to President Roosevelt's plan to ``pack'' the Supreme Court in 1937, a division that took years to heal. Under those circumstances, Conference meetings offered Barkley anything but harmony. Ultimately, however, Barkley did draw strength from the caucus, which unanimously reelected him in 1944, following his resignation as majority leader over President Roosevelt's veto of a revenue bill that Barkley had endorsed.10 When Barkley became vice president in 1949, Senate Democratic leadership passed to his whip, Illinois Senator Scott Lucas, who sought to revive the Conference with regular meetings on President Harry S. Truman's legislative program. Defeated for reelection in 1950, Lucas was succeeded by Arizona Senator Ernest McFarland, who similarly looked to the party conferences to strengthen his leadership. McFarland was defeated for reelection in 1952, and the following year Senate Democrats elected Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson as Conference chairman and floor leader. In the mode of Joe Robinson and Alben Barkley before him, Johnson rarely called conferences, except at the beginning of each session. Johnson's concentration of power in the leadership rather than the Democratic Conference worked best when the two parties were narrowly divided in the Senate. However, in 1959, shortly after Democrats won a landslide majority in the Senate, freshman Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin took the floor to lament that ``the Democratic conference or caucus is dead.'' Noting that only two conferences had been called during his two years in the Senate, Proxmire offered as an epitaph: Here lies the Democratic caucus Conceived by senatorial responsibility And born with the Democratic Party--1800 Assassinated at the hand of senatorial indifference--1953. ``She labored faithfully and well to make Senatorial leadership responsible to all the people.'' Senator Proxmire pointed out that ``there is one body and only one body to which all Democratic Senators and only Democratic Senators belong. That is the Democratic conference--in the past years called the Democratic caucus.'' He argued that ``During much of the history of the Senate the party conference or caucus has given all Democratic Senators their opportunity to exercise their right and fulfill their duty in determining our party's program and policies.'' By the late 1950s, Proxmire argued that due to the diminution of the party conferences, ``the typical Democratic Senator has literally nothing to do with determining the legislative program and policies of this party in the Senate.'' Proxmire called for ``a greater degree of democracy in our party in the Senate,'' by calling regular meetings of the Conference ``to permit all Senators to know where the leadership intends to take us, and to permit the membership, if it cares to do so, to indicate whether or not it wants to go there.'' 11 Majority Leader Johnson publicly doubted that the Democratic Conference could be a productive tool, and privately worried that frequent party conferences might prove more divisive than unifying for the party. ``There may be some who attribute to me power and influence which I do not possess,'' Johnson argued, ``but I can say in good conscience, and give my word for whatever it may be worth, that if I had caucused all day and night, I doubt whether anything I might have said would have changed the viewpoint'' of other Democratic senators. However, Johnson responded to his critics by convening conferences to discuss specific issues. 12 Johnson's election as vice president in 1960 brought a vastly different style of party leadership under Montana Senator Mike Mansfield, who chaired the Democratic Conference and served as majority leader from 1961 to 1977. Believing that responsibility for moving the legislative agenda should be shared by all senators and not simply the leadership, Mansfield saw the Conference as a means of building consensus within the party. The Democratic Conference determined that regional and philosophical balance should be established on all party committees, and that no senator, except the Conference chairman, should sit on both the Steering and the Policy committees.13 Editorial Method The minutes of the Democratic Conference from 1903 to 1964 cover sixty years and the activities of 316 Democratic senators. They span an era that opened with concern over the treatment of Civil War veterans still serving on the Senate staff, and conclude with a reference to the enactment of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. They offer insights into the senators who sponsored such monumental legislation as the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Social Security Act of 1935, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rarely verbatim, the minutes are formal in nature. But they contain occasional flashes of levity, as on June 24, 1913, when Conference Secretary Willard Saulsbury noted why he had missed some of the debate over the tariff: ``Chairman here interfered with the duties of the Secretary by telling his laughing hyena story.'' On November 27, 1913, when the chair ruled against Senator Saulsbury's motion to adjourn for Thanksgiving, the Secretary took revenge by referring to the action in the minutes he was keeping as: ``the steamroller having been oiled up and brought in.'' One notes also that on January 25, 1917, the conference passed a resolution of appreciation to the Manitou Spring Water Company of Colorado for having furnished the Conference with a complimentary case of its ginger ale. The Democratic Conference minutes were reproduced from those held in custody by the party secretary for the use of the Conference. In 1993 microform copies were deposited in the National Archives, where they will be opened for research. These minutes begin in 1903, when Senator Arthur Pue Gorman resumed the Conference chairmanship, and when the conference first established a ``binding'' rule, making record keeping more essential. Minutes of a few early meetings were not included in the official minutes but were found in Senator Gorman's personal papers. Over the years a succession of Conference secretaries recorded the minutes, adopting different styles and varying the amount of material included. The earliest minutes were handwritten; later minutes were typed with occasional handwritten addenda. The transcripts have sought to remain faithful to the original texts, with the exception of silently correcting small typographical errors, maintaining some consistency in capitalization and punctuation, and providing full words in place of abbreviations. Occasionally, an obvious typographical error (such as describing a Senate committee room as Ways and Means instead of Finance) has been corrected by inserting the correct word in brackets. In general, spelling has not been altered, so that a word like ``subcommittee'' may be spelled in a variety of ways over the sixty-year period of these minutes. To provide historical context for the documents, the editor has added introductory notes for each Congress, explanatory information in brackets (including identification for House members, Republican senators, and other noncaucus members mentioned only by last name), and occasional footnotes. Appendix B lists the full names, states, and dates of service of all Democratic senators during this period, including those who served only briefly and thus are not mentioned within the minutes.

Fifty-eighth Congress (1903-1905) [Editor's Note: President Theodore Roosevelt called the Senate into special session on March 5, 1903 to consider the ratification of the Hay-Herran Treaty with the Republic of Colombia to construct an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama. On March 17, the Senate approved the treaty by a vote of 73 to 5, but Colombia refused to accept the treaty. During the Fifty-eighth Congress, Senate Democrats were in the minority by a margin of 33 to 57. On March 6, the Democratic Conference (alternately identified as the Democratic caucus) elected Senator Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland as chairman. No minutes exist of that meeting, which was reported in the following day's Washington Post. Senator Gorman had previously chaired the caucus from 1889 to 1893, and again from 1893 until his defeat for reelection in 1899; he won another term in the Senate in 1902. Also on March 6, 1903, Senator Edward W. Carmack of Tennessee was elected Democratic Conference secretary; the Conference increased the Democratic Steering Committee from seven to nine members; and the Steering Committee was instructed to recommend Democratic appointments to Senate committees, subject to ratification by the Conference.] ____________________________________________________ [March 16, 1903] MARCH 16, 1903 Minority Conference Room, U.S. Senate.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ From 1903 to 1911, the Minority Conference met in room 24 on the gallery floor of the Senate wing of the Capitol. This room was subsequently renumbered S-311 and renamed the ``Senate Wives' Lounge.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- March 16, 1903. The Conference was called to order at 10:30 a.m., Senator Gorman presiding, with the following Senators present: Messrs. Bacon, Bailey, Bate, Berry, Blackburn, Carmack, Clark of Montana, Clay, Cockrell, Daniel, Foster of Louisiana, Gorman, Latimer, McCreary, McEnery, Mallory, Martin, Money, Newlands, Overman, Patterson, Pettus, Simmons, Stone, Taliaferro, Teller, and Tillman, 27 in all. Senator Gorman stated the object of the meeting to be the discussion of the proposed amendments to the pending Panama Canal Treaty. Mr. Money offered the following amendment, by way of a substitute for the Second Paragraph of Article 4: The United States, following their uniform established policy in regard to their sister Republics in America, freely acknowledge and recognize the sovereignty of the Republic of Colombia, and disavow any intention to impair it in any way whatever, or to increase their territory at the expense of Colombia, but most earnestly desire her peace and prosperity. which was adopted. Mr. Bacon offered the following amendment as a substitute for Article 23 of the Treaty: The Government of the United States shall have and exercise the exclusive right to provide and enforce such means and measures as it may deem advisable and necessary for the regulation and management of the canal and for the protection and safety thereof, and of the ships that make use of the same, and the railways and other works within said Zone, including all persons and cargos and freights and other property connected with the construction, maintenance and operation of said canal and the use thereof, and for the accomplishment of these ends, as well as for the protection of the lives and persons of those employed upon the Canal, railways or other works, or engaged in the use thereof. The Government of the United States shall employ such force as may by it be deemed necessary, and to this end shall have the right at all times and in its discretion to use its police and its land and naval forces for these purposes, which was adopted. There being no further business, the Conference adjourned. __________________________________________ [Editor's Note: The Senate reconvened for the first session of the Fifty-eighth Congress on November 9, six days after a revolution broke out in Panama to secure its independence from Colombia. A U.S. warship prevented the Colombians from landing troops in Panama, and the United States quickly recognized the new government. On November 18, the United States and Panama signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, permitting the United States to build and operate, and protect a canal across Panama. Although he insisted that the United States had neither encouraged or assisted the rebellion, in later years, President Roosevelt asserted: ``I took the Canal Zone and let Congress debate.'' Democratic Senators opposed to the new treaty sought to unite their party by proposing a rule that would bind all members of the Conference to any decision approved by a two-thirds vote of the Conference. This marked the first time that either party caucus sought to bind its members to the decision of the caucus. The Senate approved the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty on February 23, 1904, by a vote of 66 to 14. No minutes were taken for the Democratic Conference meetings held on December 12 and 14, 1903, however Conference Chairman Gorman left the following account of these meetings in his own journal: Saturday Dec. 12, 1903 The Democratic Conference was held at 10:30 A.M. to consider a resolution offered by Senator Berry, to amend the Cuban bill; it was strongly urged [by] this Senator and Senator Teller but was opposed by Bailey, Clay, Blackburn and Gorman, who stated the only effect would be to divide the party and accomplish no other result. He appealed to his associates to unite [and] pass a resolution where \\2/3\\ of the Caucus so voted it should be binding on all matters of party interest. Blackburn offered such a resolution [and] a spirited debate followed. Strong in favor of Blackburn's proposition. The Conference declined to authorize any amend[ment] to the Cuban bill; Senator Teller announced he wold not allow another Caucus and would not be bound. We adjourned until Mond[ay] 14 to Consider Blackburn's resolution. December 14th, 1903 Caucus of Senators at 10, on Blackburn's resolution to bind all Senators on \\2/3\\ vote in Congress. Long debate. Daniel, Tillman, Blackburn, Carmack, Stone, Morgan, Foster advocating resolution. Bacon, Cockrell, Berry, Mallory opposing it; finally vote was taken on postponing until tomorrow. Carried by vote of 16, 25 in Caucus. Senator Newlands offered resolution to reorganize Steering Committee: 5 South including Maryland, 4 North. There are 6 Senators from the North--not considered but will be tomorrow.2] --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ John R.

Newlands, Overman, Pettus, Simmons, Stone, Taliaferro, and Tillman. Total 27. The following resolution offered by Mr. Blackburn was taken up for consideration: RESOLVED, That hereafter all members of the Senate Democratic Caucus shall be bound to vote in accordance with its decisions made by a two-thirds vote of all its members, on all questions except those involving a construction of the Constitution, or upon which a Senator has made pledges to his constituents, or received instructions from the Legislature of a State which he represents. Full discussion was had, and Senator Mallory offered the following amendment: Provided, this rule shall not apply to the action of Senators on the pending Cuban Reciprocity Bill or the pending Panama Canal Treaty, which, after discussion was rejected by the following vote: Yeas: Messrs. Bacon, Bate, Berry, Clay, Cockrell, Foster of La., McCreary, McEnery, Mallory, Simmons, Taliaferro, Total 11. Nays: Messrs. Bailey, Blackburn, Carmack, Daniel, Dubois, Gibson, Gorman, Latimer, McLaurin, Martin, Morgan, Overman, Pettus, Stone, and Tillman, Total 15.

Mr. Newlands offered the following resolution: RESOLVED, That the Steering Committee be reconstituted by providing that it shall consist of nine members, five to be selected by the Senators from the Southern States, including Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, and four to be selected by the Senators from the remaining States. After consideration, the Caucus, upon motion of Mr. Pettus, adjourned until 10 a.m. Wednesday, December 16.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Chairman Gorman's journal recorded: ``The Democratic Caucus met at 10. The Resolution of Senator Blackburn for \\2/3\\ rule was debated until 12. M [noon]. The opposition resolved the case on an Amendment to exclude the Cuban Treaty and Panama Treaty; it was voted down 11 to 16. And the Blackburn resolution passed 23 to 2; Senator Cockrell not voting. The debate was spirited, Bailey, Morgan, Stone for it; Cockrell, Foster, Mallory, and his colleague [James P. Taliaferro], and others in opposition. A great deal of feeling was exhibited as it is the first time such a rule has been adopted. I hope it will be allayed and good feeling will prevail. Senator Newlands then offered his resolution to reorganize the Caucus Committee, which goes over until tomorrow, Wednesday, at that meeting a resolution will be offered to oppose [the] Cuban Treaty.''

Mr. Bailey offered the following resolution: Whereas, this Caucus has heretofore expressly left each member of it to determine for himself his vote upon the treaty with Cuba; and Whereas, Senators have, in accordance with such Caucus action, committed themselves by votes and speeches in favor of said treaty, Therefore, Be it Resolved, That it would be inexpedient and unwise to adopt a rule requiring such Senators to vote against the bill now pending in the Senate to approve said treaty, which was adopted. Mr. Bailey offered the following resolution: That it is the sense of this Caucus that Democratic Senators shall insist in Executive Session on making public [the] Treaty with Panama and all documents, which was adopted.4 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Senator Gorman recorded in his journal: ``The Democratic Conference met at 10 a.m. The resolution of Senator Newlands was considered for reorganization of Steering Committee, and sundry propositions were made to amend by increasing the committee to 11. I finally stated that the Caucus could do as they desired but I considered the whole move a reflection on my action and it would be so regarded generally that the motion must be modified as I would not select the new members the Caucus must do that, that I would gladly surrender the place as chairman but I could not submit to continue with any Senators thinking I had been unfair to any section. The Caucus declined to take any action after which several Senators, Stone, Blackburn, Carmack & others appealed to me to adjust it. I told them frankly, I could not recede. I would be glad to vacate, so the matter ended. The Caucus decided to permit the Cuban bill to go through without Amendment being offered and each Senator to vote as he desired. And then to unite on demand for Panamanian Treaty to be made public and to insist on Post Office Investigation.''

Said committee shall have authority to send for persons and papers, compel attendance of witnesses, and shall make report at the earliest practicable date. and the matter referred to the following Sub Committee: Messrs. Bacon, Patterson, Martin, Newlands, and Bailey.5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Senator Gorman recorded in his journal on January 22, 1904: ``The Caucus Committee--Culberson, Cockrell, and [my]self being present agreed to a resolution of inquiry and one for investigation as to aid given by [the U.S.] government [to the] revolution in Panama. Called Caucus for tomorrow.'' On January 23, Gorman wrote: ``The U.S. Senate [Democratic] Caucus met at 11 A.M. After a long discussion we agreed to two resolutions named in memoranda of yesterday and appoint[ed] committee of 5 to take any other action.''

Fifty-ninth Congress (1905-1907) [Editor's Note: Senate Democrats remained in the minority, 32 to 58 1, during the Fifty-ninth Congress. A major issue facing the Senate in 1905 was a treaty with Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic), designed to solve Santo Domingo's debt crisis and forestall European intervention. The treaty permitted the United States to operate Santo Domingo's customhouses and manage its debt payment. The Senate first took up the treaty in December 1905, recommitting it to the Foreign Relations Committee on December 13. A revised treaty was eventually approved by a vote of 43 to 19, on February 25, 1907. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Source for party divisions in Senate and House of Representatives is Kenneth C.

Patterson of Colorado broke ranks with his party to support President Roosevelt's Dominican policies. Appearing before the Democratic Caucus on February 3, 1906, Patterson defended his views, but the caucus adopted a resolution requiring all members to vote against the treaty. In the Senate on February 5, Patterson assailed the attempt to enforce party discipline as being ``in plain violation of the spirit and intent of the constitution of the United States.'' Senator Joseph W. Bailey of Texas responded that the caucus had adopted a rule ``defining a Senator's duty as a Democrat. The Senator is at perfect liberty, whenever the importance of the question or the force of his convictions, or both, shall render it impossible to obey the Caucus, to defy it, and to vote precisely as he would had no Caucus action had been taken. If he does defy it, he then settles with the Democratic people of his own State.'' 2] --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Clarence A.

The assignments of Mr. Bankhead left vacant, a special report to be submitted when he is sworn in, the Chairman stating that he would nominate Mr. Bankhead to the vacancies then. On motion of Mr. Bailey, the Chairman was authorized to fill the four vacancies on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which was done, the members of the Committee for 1908 being: Messrs: James P. Taliaferro of Florida William J. Stone of Missouri Alexander S. Clay of Georgia Francis G. Newlands of Nevada Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma Robert L. Taylor of Tennessee Asbury C. Latimer of South Carolina C.A. Culberson of Texas Thomas S. Martin of Virginia Mr. Johnston suggested that a resolution, defining the duty of Democratic Senators as to legislation on the financial situation, and declaring that they would acquiesce in and not obstruct any just remedial legislation proposed should be adopted. Mr. Newlands moved that the Steering Committee be authorized to receive suggestions as to such legislation and to call meetings of the Conference to consider them, but accepted an amendment to the effect that the Committee on Rules be substituted. The Chairman read a proposed resolution, directing the Committee on Finance to forthwith investigate the financial situation, and make early report, with recommendations as to relief, suggesting that the Democratic members of the Finance Committee should take the initiative in developing the facts and formulating a proper plan for Democratic action. Messrs. Money and Teller suggested that they did not feel that they could be bound to the Conference on questions relating to finance. With Mr. Newlands' motion pending, the Conference adjourned. Chairman [signed] Robert L. Owen Secretary ____________________________________________________ [January 25, 1908] JANUARY 25, 1908 Minority Conference Room, U.S. Senate January 25, 1908. Conference convened at 10:30 a.m., with the following Senators present: Messrs. Bailey, Bankhead, Bryan, Clarke, Clay, Culberson, Daniel, Davis, Frazier, Gore, Johns[t]on, Latimer, McCreary, McLaurin, Newlands, Overman, Owen, Paynter, Rayner, Simmons, Stone, Taliaferro, Taylor, Teller, Tillman and Whyte. The minutes were read to date. Mr. Bailey suggested that he would prefer to have his reasons for voting to have the Conference name its own Committee on Committees inserted in the minutes, which was agreed to, and the minutes are to be corrected in this respect. The Chairman read a letter from the Oklahoma Delegation, expressing its thanks at the selection of Mr. Owen as Secretary of the Conference. Upon motion of Senator Daniel, it was ordered that the letter be spread upon the minutes, and it reads as follows: Dec. 5th, 1907 Senator Chas. A. Culberson Washington, D.C. My dear Sir: I beg to hand you a copy of resolutions unanimously adopted by the Oklahoma Democratic delegation. We are all duly sensible of the high honor conferred upon our State by the selection of my distinguished and deserving colleague as Secretary of the Democratic Caucus. You will kindly convey expressions of our gratitude and gratification to the Democratic minority in caucus assembled. Believe me, Very truly [Signed] T.P. Gore Resolution RESOLVED, by the Democratic delegation of the State of Oklahoma in caucus assembled, that we heartily endorse the selection of Senator Robert L. Owen, as Secretary of the Democratic Senate Caucus, not only as a fitting recognition of his high character and intrinsic worth, but as a significant and gracious compliment to the State of Oklahoma, the youngest daughter of the Republic. [signed] T.P. Gore, Chairman J.S. Davenport, Secy. An extended discussion of the financial question, participated in by various members, ensued, lasting until recess at 1 o'clock. The Conference reconvened at 2 p.m., and discussion continued until 4:30. The sense of the Conference appeared to be that the question should be discussed as thoroughly as possible, with a view to as great a degree of co-operation as possible among the members. It was further suggested that the members of the Minority on the Finance Committee should prepare a measure, and that suggestions should be made by the various members of the Minority in regard to the subject, with a view of securing such coherence of action as was possible, but no definite action was taken in regard to the matter. The discussion was participated in by Senators McLaurin, Owen, Bailey, Culberson, Newlands, Clarke, Teller, Taylor, Daniel, and others. There being no further business, the meeting adjourned. Chairman Secretary __________________________________________ Conference Room, April 15, 08. Senator J. H. Bankhead of Alabama was selected as a member of the Congressional Campaign Committee, vice Senator A.[C.] Latimer, deceased. Sixty-first Congress (1909-1911) [Editor's Note: After the election of 1908, Senate Democrats remained in the minority with 32 Democrats to 60 Republicans. President William Howard Taft called the Senate into special session, from March 4 to 6, to confirm his cabinet nominees. Taft called both houses of Congress back into session, from March 15 to August 5, 1909, to enact new tariff legislation. Although the president and reformers in both parties aimed to lower tariff rates, the resulting Payne-Aldrich Tariff considerably raised tariff duties.] ____________________________________________________ [March 5, 1909] MARCH 5, 1909 Conference Room, U.S. Senate, March 5, 1909. Conference met at 10 a.m. The following Senators were present. Messrs: Bankhead, Chamberlain, Clarke, Clay, Culberson, Frazier, Gore, Hughes, Johnston, McLaurin, Money, Newlands, Overman, Owen, Shively, Simmons, Smith (Md.), Smith (S.C.), Stone and Tillman. Absent: Messrs. Bacon, Bailey, Daniel, Davis, Fletcher, Foster, McEnery, Martin, Paynter, Rayner, Taliaferro and Taylor. Upon the convening of the Conference, the Chairman stated that the usual practice had been that no Senator was taken off a Committee without his consent, and that seniority governed in nominating for Committee vacancies, except that when such senior Senator was already upon an important committee or committees, this seniority privilege of nomination was not necessarily accorded, unless the senior Senator desiring the nomination agreed as a condition to such nomination to vacate a committee place already held by him. This suggestion of the Chairman was not questioned. Upon the nomination of Senator Stone, Senator Culberson was unanimously elected Chairman of the Conference for the 61st PCongress. Upon nomination of Senator Clarke, Senator Money was unanimously elected Vice-Chairman of the Conference for the 61st PCongress. Upon nomination of Senator Frazier, Senator Owen was unanimously elected Secretary of the Conference for the 61st Congress. Upon motion of Senator Clarke the Chairman was authorized to Pappoint a Committee on Committees of nine members, including Pthe Chairman of the Conference as ex-officio Chairman of the PCommittee. Senator Clarke reported reasons why the Committee to formulate rules for the government of the Conference had not prepared such rules, and moved that the Chairman appoint a new Committee of three for this purpose, which was adopted. Thereupon, the Chairman announced the appointment on this Committee of Senators: Clarke, Daniel, Taliaferro. The Chairman announced the appointment of the following Senators on the Committee on Committees: Money, Bacon, Martin, Tillman, Stone, Simmons, Newlands, Clarke, Culberson (Ex-officio Chairman). Upon motion, Conference adjourned, subject to call of Chairman. Chairman Secretary [typescript] Meeting of the Democratic Conference, March 5th, 1909. 10 a.m. Quorum present. Chairman Culberson called the meeting to order and made a short explanation of the purpose of the Conference, explaining the necessity for the reorganization of the Conference and the establishment of a Committee on Committees, and he stated that the usual practice of the Democratic Conference in the past was that no Senator was ever taken off a Committee without his consent, and that when vacancies occurred, the rule of seniority prevails in regard to application for preferment to such vacancies with the exception, that where a Senator is elected to act on a Committee, he may be required to relinquish something, before being advanced to the more important vacancy. Upon motion of Senator Stone, Senator Culberson was re-elected unanimously as Chairman of the Conference for the Sixty-first Congress. Senator Money, on the nomination of Senator Clarke, was unanimously elected Vice-Chairman of the Democratic Conference. Senator Owen, on the nomination of Senator Frazier, was unanimously re-elected Secretary of the Conference. Senator Clarke moved the Chairman appoint a Committee of nine, as a Steering Committee, of which the Chairman of the Conference should be ex officio Chairman. Senator Clarke named Senators Money, Bacon, Martin, Tillman, Stone, Simmons, Newlands, and Clarke as members of the Committee on Committees or Steering Committee. Senator Clarke reported for the Committee on Rules, that his Committee, consisting of Senators Daniel and Taliaferro had not had opportunity to prepare rules, and that he moved a new Committee of three be appointed to draw up permanent rules of procedure. Chairman Culberson appointed Senators Clarke, Daniel, and Taliaferro to perform this duty. General discussion ensued, with regard to the policy of the Minority, in which Senators Tillman, Money, Newlands, Clay, Simmons, Clarke and others participated. ____________________________________________________ [March 22, 1909] MARCH 22, 1909 Conference Room, U.S. Senate.

Thereupon the Conference adjourned. ____________________________________________________ [April 14, 1909] APRIL 14, 1909 Conference Room, U.S. Senate, April 14, 1909. Conference met at 2 p.m. The following Senators were present: Messrs. Bacon, Bailey, Chamberlain, Clay, Culberson, Daniel, Fletcher, Foster, Frazier, Gore, Hughes, Johnston, McEnery, McLaurin, Martin, Money, Overman, Owen, Rayner, Shively, Simmons, Smith of Md., Smith of S.C., Stone, Taliaferro, Taylor. Senator Davis was announced absent because of the death of his wife. Chairman Culberson explained that the Conference was called to consider the will of the Conference on the Tariff Bill. Senator Daniel urged a tax on the gross income of corporations. Senator Money advocated putting the entire responsibility on the Republicans, because the Minority were denied all rights in Committee, not being consulted on this Tariff Bill, or permitted to protest. General discussion followed and an agreement favorable to the Income Tax seemed to prevail. Senator Culberson suggested a graduated income tax, and to gradually reduce the protected articles. Senators Bailey, Taliaferro, Daniel, Culberson, Bacon, Johnston, McLaurin, Chamberlain, Simmons, Foster, Smith and others participated in the discussion. Senator Bacon submitted the following motion: RESOLVED, That it is the sense of this Conference that an income tax provision should be engrafted upon the Tariff Bill now pending in the Senate for the purpose of supplying revenue for the support of the Government, and that the Tariff Schedules in the said pending bill should be reduced in proportion to the revenue to be derived from said income tax, and that in said reductions, so far as practicable, the burden of taxation should be removed from the necessities of life. Senator Culberson was authorized to explain to the Press so far as he thought judicious the action of the Conference. Upon motion of Senator Johnston, adjournment was had. Chairman Secretary ____________________________________________________ [April 16, 1909] APRIL 16, 1909 Conference Room, U.S. Senate. April 16, 1909. Conference met, pursuant to call at 2 p.m. The following Senators were present: Messrs. Bankhead, Chamberlain, Clay, Culberson, Daniel, Fletcher, Foster, Frazier, Gore, Hughes, Johnston, McLaurin, Money, Newlands, Overman, Owen, Paynter, Shively, Simmons, Smith (Md.), Stone and Taylor. Mr. Daniel suggested dividing the work and giving each member a special subject. Mr. Simmons suggested being ready to proceed with the debate and to have a record made of those ready to take the floor. Senators Daniel, Stone and Money expressed themselves ready to speak. Mr. Culberson explained to the Conference that he had asked no favors of Senator Aldrich 4 in the way of delays. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Nelson W. Aldrich (Republican of Rhode Island), chaired the Senate Finance Committee and was the principal Senate sponsor of the Payne- Aldrich Tariff. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Income Tax was discussed. Reference was made to Senator George's 5 Report of 1892-93, when Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, and the decisions of the Supreme Court in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 52, and Pollock v. Farmers Loan and Trust Co., 157 U.S. 601, and the fact that in the Pollock Case, Sections 27-37 of the Act of 1894 had been held void. Senator Bankhead suggested that the decision be printed as a public document. Senator Rayner explained that the Court's decision recognized as valid taxes on offices, privileges, employments and vocation, but as to income on real estate and personal property the Court held that it was a direct tax, and was not apportioned as required. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ James Z. George (Democrat of Mississippi), 1881-1897. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Daniel urged the taxing of franchises and corporations. Senator Gore suggested the income tax passed during the War by the Republicans, and sustained by the Supreme Court, as having tactical advantage. Senator Clay moved the appointment of a Committee of three to investigate the New York Tax Law on future contracts and report to the Conference. The motion was carried. The Chairman appointed upon the Committee Messrs. Clay, Paynter, and Hughes. Senator Paynter suggested a rebate of 6 cents a pound on twisted loose- leaf tobacco, so far as the farmers' personal sales were concerned (the item has passed the House three times). Senator Newlands suggested a special conference on the Philippines. Adjourned. ____________________________________________________ [December 6, 1909] DECEMBER 6, 1909 Conference Room, U.S. Senate, December 6, 1909. Conference called to order at 2 p.m. by Hon. H. D.

Absent: Bailey, Culberson, Gore, McEnery, McLaurin, Martin, Smith of Md. Senator Stone moved that Chas. A. Culberson's resignation be adopted and his letter spread on minutes. Motion carried nem con. The letter follows: Atlantic City, N.J. Dec. 5 1909. To the Democratic Caucus: I hereby tender my resignation as Chairman of our Caucus to take effect at once. Enclosed is a copy of my letter to Senator Money giving my reasons for this course which I ask may be spread on the minutes of the proceedings. With renewed assurances of my profound appreciation of the honor done me by election to this high party station, Very truly yours, [Signed] C.A. Culberson Atlantic City, N.J., Dec. 3, 1909. Hon. H.D. Money Vice Chairman, Democratic Caucus Washington, D.C. Dear Senator: As you and all my Democratic associates know, I have not been at all well for nearly a year. Last March I had a severe attack of the grippe. Without taking the necessary rest from such an attack, I remained in Washington in attendance upon the Senate throughout the recent extra session. The result was that I continued all during all the session, and at its close, I was much reduced in strength and vitality. From this I have not recovered in the comparatively short vacation which I have been able to take. The approaching session of the Congress promises to be a long, exacting and arduous one, and, in my present condition, I do not feel that I should undertake the extra duties which will devolve upon the Chairman of our Caucus. It would probably retard or prevent my early and full restoration to health. While I am deeply sensible to the high honor done me by my colleagues in my unanimous election to this chairmanship for the last two Congresses, especially as it came wholly without my seeking, and while under different circumstances, I would, of course, fulfill as best I might the requirements of the position, yet for the reasons stated, I am compelled to ask to be relieved of its duties. Accordingly at the first Conference to be held by the Minority in the coming session, I will submit my resignation as chairman. It remains only for me to repeat that the esteem and confidence and partiality of my party associates in the Senate are ever more keenly appreciated than I can express, and that I will ever bear them in grateful recollection. Your friend, [signed] C.A. Culberson Senator Daniel moved that the Secretary advise Senator Culberson of the profound appreciation of the Conference of his uniform courtesy, fairness and fidelity. Motion unanimously carried. Washington, D.C. Dec. 10th 1909. Hon. Charles A. Culberson Washington, D.C. My very dear friend: On behalf of the Democratic Conference of the United States Senate over which you have so kindly and graciously presided, I am instructed by a formal resolution of the Conference to express to you the profound appreciation of your Democratic Colleagues for the faithful, able, impartial and very honorable manner in which you have discharged the duties of the trust reposed in you by them. Nothing but an earnest desire to promote the restoration of your health would have induced your associates to accept your resignation. Had you been able to overhear the sentiments expressed at the Conference when your determination to withdraw was discussed you would more fully realize the very cordial admiration and affection felt for you by all of your colleagues on whose behalf and in whose name I am directed to thank you for the fidelity and distinguished ability with which you have so satisfactorily served them as chairman. Faithfully your friend, [Signed] Robert L. Owen Secretary of the Conference of Democratic Senators Senator Daniel moved Senator Money be elected Chairman of the Conference for this Congress. He was elected by acclamation. Senator Money made an address to the Conference, pledging his best efforts to preserve concord, promote unity and serve the PCountry. Senator Newlands nominated for Vice-Chairman by Senator Chamberlain. Senator Stone suggested Senator Shively on account of the importance of Indiana. Senator Newlands withdrew his name and Senator Shively was elected nem con. Senator Tillman nominated Captain R. S. Anderson as door-keeper. Carried.
