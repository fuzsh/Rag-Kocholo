        "text": "The 1922 United States Senate elections were elections that occurred in the middle of Republican President Warren G. Harding's term. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. With the Republicans divided between conservative and progressive factions, the Democrats gained six net seats from the Republicans while the Farmer–Labor party gained one. The Republicans retained their Senate majority.\n\nMid-term vacancies would reduce the Republican majority by a further two seats, with the Democrats and the Farmer Labors picking up another seat each, reducing Republicans to a 51-43-2 majority.\n\nGains, losses, and holds\n\nRetirements\n\nOne Republican and two Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election. One Republican retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term and one Democrat retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term.\n\nDefeats\n\nNine Republicans and three Democrats sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election. One Republican sought election to finish the unexpired term and sought election to a full term but lost in both the special election and the regular election.\n\nPost-elections changes\n\nChange in composition\n\nBefore the elections\n\nAt the beginning of 1922.\n\nDDDDDDDDwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% DDDD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nR\n\nR\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nMajority →RRRR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nAfter the elections\n\nDDDDDDDDwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% Dwidth=10% DDDD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nFL\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nMajority →RRRR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nKey\n\nalign=center width=35px DDemocraticalign=center width=35px FLFarmer–Laboralign=center width=35px RRepublican\n\nRace summaries\n\nSpecial elections during the 67th Congress\n\nIn these special elections, the winners were seated during 1922; ordered by election date.\n\nStateIncumbentResultsCandidatesSenatorPartyElectoral historyDelaware\n\n(Class 1)T.

Mayfield won the runoff, but because of his support of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan, anti-Klan activists in the Democratic Party including George Peddy attempted to have him stripped of the nomination.[2] After this failed, Peddy ran as the candidate of the \"Independent Democrats.\"[3] The Texas Republican Party also backed Peddy, but after a lengthy court battle, they were unable to have him included on the general election ballot as their official nominee.[4] Peddy instead ran as a write-in candidate, but he lost the general election to Mayfield.[5]\n\nUtah\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nSee main article: 1922 United States Senate election in Vermont.\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nSee main article: 1922 United States Senate election in Virginia.\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nSee main article: 1922 United States Senate election in Washington.\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSee main article: 1922 United States Senate election in Wisconsin.\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nSee also: List of United States senators from Wyoming.\n\nSee also\n\n1923 United States Senate elections\n\n1922 United States elections\n\n1922 United States House of Representatives elections\n\n67th United States Congress\n\n68th United States Congress\n\nNotes and References"
