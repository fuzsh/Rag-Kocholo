He graduated from Mississippi College in 1927 and received his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1938, where he also completed his master’s thesis \"Career of John Sharp Williams in the House of Representatives.\" Between 1935 and 1941, he taught at Berry College and during this period married Margaret McMillen. Osborn also served on the faculties of the University of Mississippi (1943-1944), Memphis State University (1944-1947), and the University of Florida (1947-1972). In addition to his biographies John Sharp Williams: Planter-Statesman of the Deep South (1943) and James Kimble Vardaman: Southern Commoner (circa 1981), he also published Woodrow Wilson: The Early Years (1968) and The Role of the British Press in the 1976 Presidential Election (1981).\n\nJohn Sharp Williams\n\nJohn Sharp Williams represented Mississippi in the U.S. Congress for twenty-nine years. Williams’ grandfather Christopher Harris Williams, a Tennessee Whig, had served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1837 to 1852. Born to Christopher Harris Williams Jr. and Annie Louise Sharp in Memphis on 30 July 1854, Williams became an orphan during the Civil War when his lawyer father died fighting at the Battle of Shiloh (his mother having passed away several years earlier). Williams and his brother moved to Cedar Grove, the 3,000 acre plantation home of their maternal grandfather John Sharp in Yazoo County, Mississippi.\n\nWilliams had an extensive and varied education. After attending local schools, he studied at the Kentucky Military Institute, the University of the South, and the University of Virginia. Williams left the latter institution in 1873 as a Phi Beta Kappa member but with no degree since he refused to enroll in anything but liberal arts classes. Abroad, he attended the Universität Heidelberg in Germany and the College of France at Dijon (years later, his studies and travel experience garnered him a reputation in Congress as a European specialist). After returning to the United States, Williams enrolled in law classes at the University of Virginia and read with a Memphis law firm.\n\nAdmitted to the bar in March 1877, Williams married Elizabeth Dial Webb of Livingston, Alabama later that year. He returned to Yazoo City in 1878 to practice law and grow cotton at Cedar Grove which eventually grew to 8,000 acres. His family also increased with the birth of seven children.\n\nThe Fifth Mississippi District electorate sent Williams, a Democrat, to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1893. With impressive debating skills, he adopted positions for silver coinage (but against Williams Jennings Bryan’s demand for unlimited circulation of that currency); against protective tariffs and the annexation of Hawaii; and for states’ rights. Williams faced his first real electoral challenge after 1903 redistricting forced a campaign against two other incumbents. Victorious, he became the House Minority Leader, a post held until 1908. Williams also served on the Rules Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nIn 1906, he announced that he would run for a Senate seat in 1911 instead of seeking reelection to the House. Therefore in 1909, he returned home to fight a vicious campaign for the post against Mississippi Governor James K. Vardaman. Although Vardaman promised white voters that he would work to rescind the 15th Amendment, Williams won the election. In recognition of his House experience and leadership, Senate Democrats placed the new Mississippi member on both the Finance and Foreign Relations committees. Williams also chaired the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses (1913-14), the Committee on the Library (1915-18), and the Committee on the University of the United States (1919-1920).\n\nWilliams allied himself with President Woodrow Wilson, supporting the United States’ entry into World War I and lobbying for U.S. membership in the League of Nations. During the latter legislative battle, a bitter feud developed between Williams and Vardaman, who had eventually won Mississippi’s junior senate post and who opposed both the war and the League. Williams actively supported Pat Harrison in the 1918 campaign which removed Vardaman from office.\n\nDisappointed with the Senate’s isolationist majority, Williams decided not to seek reelection in 1922 stating famously that he would \"rather be a hound dog and bay at the moon from my Mississippi plantation than remain in the United States Senate.\" He remained close to home after retirement and died on 27 September 1932. His grave rests in the family plot at Cedar Mound.\n\nJames Kimble Vardaman\n\nBorn on 26 July 1861 in Jackson County, Texas, James Kimble Vardaman was one of six children by parents William Sylvester and Mollie Fox Vardaman. Originally from Mississippi, the father moved his family back home in 1868, settling in Yalobusha County.\n\nVardaman moved to Carrollton, Mississippi as a young man to study law at Helm & Somerville. Admitted to the bar in 1882, he opened a practice in the nearby community of Winona where he also edited the local newspaper. In 1884, he married Anna Robinson with whom he had two daughters and a son.\n\nIn 1890, Vardaman became editor of the Greenwood Enterprise. The year before, Leflore County had elected him to the Mississippi House of Representatives. The young legislator would hold on to both jobs through 1896. Although defeated in a race for House Speaker in 1892, Vardaman garnered the post in 1894. He also served as a democratic presidential elector in both 1892 and 1898. In 1895, he failed to win the gubernatorial nomination of the state’s Democratic Party. The following year, Vardaman established the Greenwood Commonwealth.\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War, Vardaman accepted a commission as captain in the 5th U.S. Volunteers. At the end of service in Cuba, he had risen to the rank of major. Despite these military ventures, party leadership at home refused yet again to nominate him for the Governor’s Mansion. Consequently, Vardaman backed the popular primary measure in which voters selected a party’s nominees for all public offices. In 1903, he became the first governor in the state elected after receiving his party’s nomination through a popular primary election.\n\nSince his early newspaper years, Vardaman had espoused a prohibition platform. A \"southern progressive,’ he also fought against child labor, supported prison reform, and established the State Insane Asylum as well as the Deaf and Dumb Institute during his two terms in office. However, his racism propelled him to recommend the closing of black public schools and to seek repeal of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter John Sharp Williams defeated him in a 1907 contest for the U.S. Senate, Vardaman established a weekly newspaper in Jackson called The Issue which he continued to manage until 1911. Defeated in another campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in 1910, he finally succeeded in 1912. During his tenure, the junior senator served as chair of the Committee on Conservation of Natural Resources (1913-1918), the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department (1913-1914), and the Committee on Manufactures (1917-1918). Largely due to his vocal opposition to United States participation in World War I, Pat Harrison defeated his reelection bid in 1918.\n\nVardaman lost an attempt to return to the Senate in 1922 and thenceforth relocated to Birmingham, Alabama where his two daughters lived. Dying on 25 June 1930, Vardaman returned to Mississippi to lie in state at the capitol before burial in Jackson’s Lakewood Memorial Park.\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThis collection contains research material accumulated by historian George Coleman Osborn while researching his biographies John Sharp Williams: Planter-Statesman of the Deep South (1943) and James Kimble Vardaman: Southern Commoner (circa 1981). The collection contains mostly transcripts; however, original material is scattered throughout the files as well.\n\nBoxes 1 through 3 contain transcripts of correspondence that George C. Osborne or his agents made while researching John Sharp Williams. At times, these transcripts are merely excerpts. The transcripts make no indication regarding the institution or holder possessing the original letters, although they often contain handwritten research notes by Osborne. In his biography, Osborne remarks that most of his research relied upon the John Sharp Williams Collection at the Library of Congress. Box 2 does include a few original documents which are marked as such on the content list.\n\nMost of the contents in Box 4 are original. Box 4, Folders 3 through 11 hold the correspondence of Robert W. Banks (1843-1919) who owned and edited the Columbus Index and later moved to Meridian to edit the Standard. Banks wrote a Civil War history The Battle of Franklin (1908) and a series of newspaper articles on famous Mississippians in the past. The same box includes the correspondence of his daughter, Lucile Banks in Folders 1 and 2. Related to John Sharp Williams through the Webb family, several of the Banks letters discuss Williams, Vardaman, and Mississippi politics in general. Other subjects include Robert Bank’s book, his series of articles on famous Mississippians, and Confederate veterans. Folder 4 contains a particularly lengthy account of Mississippi’s military recruitment efforts to fill the state’s quota for the Spanish American War. Box 4, Folders 12 through 16 contain a mix of Lucile Banks, Robert W. Banks, and John Sharp Williams correspondence. Box 4, Folder 17 has transcripts of James K. Vardaman correspondence, while Folder 18 contains transcripts of three letters between Williams and Vardaman. Box 4, Folder 19 holds transcripts of material in the Archibald Stinson Coody Collection (possibly from the Coody Papers at the Mississippi Department of Archives & History). Secretary of the Mississippi State Tax Commission from 1918 to 1954, Coody published an excerpt from an intended biography of Vardaman in 1944. Finally, Folder 20 contains the correspondence and notes of George C. Osborn concerning his research on Williams.\n\nBox 5 consists of typed transcripts of excerpts from the Congressional Record. Boxes 6 through 8 hold typed transcripts of excerpts from the New York Times and a variety of Mississippi newspapers on the topics of John Sharp Williams and James Kimble Vardaman. Included among these newspapers are three established and edited by Vardaman: Greenwood Commonwealth, Issue, and Vardaman’s Weekly. Box 9 holds transcripts of Williams’ speeches; typed notes from master’s theses, popular magazines, and publications; typed manuscripts of a series of articles on famous Mississippians by Colonel Robert W. Banks; and miscellaneous notes on both Williams and Vardaman.\n\nBox 10 contains some original correspondence related to Williams, but mostly consists of small publications and other printed materials. Original photographs in the last folder have been removed to separate storage and replaced with photocopies. Box 11 is oversized and holds original broadsheets, clippings, newspapers, and newspaper excerpts which primarily relate to Williams and Vardaman, although some items are about Dr. B.F. Ward and Robert W. Banks.\n\nUser Information\n\nPrefered Citation\n\nJohn Sharp Williams Collection, Archives and Special Collections, J.D.
