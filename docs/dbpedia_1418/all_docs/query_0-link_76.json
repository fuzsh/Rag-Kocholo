        "text": "One hundred years ago - on 4 June 1919 - Congress approved the 19th Amendment to the US constitution guaranteeing the right of American women to vote.\n\nThe amendment was the product of decades of campaigning and slow progress since the first convention for women's rights was held in Seneca Falls in 1848.\n\nIn the years since, women had been thrown in jail for voting illegally, organised pickets across the country and chained themselves to the White House demanding representation.\n\nRights were granted in a handful of, mostly western, states over the years but resistance remained. This amendment, officially ratified in 1920, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex on a national level.\n\nIn 2019 the US has more women in national politics than ever before, but still falls well short of equality.\n\nThese are the pioneers who have made history in the century since.\n\nFirst women in congress\n\nBefore the amendment, Jeanette Rankin was elected to the House of Representatives in 1916 remarking: \"I may be the first woman member of Congress, but I won't be the last\".\n\nShe was a suffragette and lobbyist with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) - an organisation borne out of the frustration over post-civil war reconstruction not advocating for women's rights.\n\nShe voted against US entry into World War One - a move that would eventually cost her her seat. She then returned to the House in 1940 on an anti-war platform - becoming the only member to vote against US entry in both conflicts.\n\nIn 1922 Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the US Senate - but only as a symbolic gesture for 24 hours. Ten years later Hattie Ophelia Caraway, from Arkansas, became the first woman ever elected to the chamber.\n\nHer husband, Thaddeus, had died in office the year before and a governor had chosen her to fill his seat drawing on something known as the \"widow's mandate\".\n\nShe then won a special election to serve out the rest of his term and achieved re-election herself in 1938.\n\nIn spite of the 19th Amendment, racially-targeted voter suppression and disenfranchisement remained a problem throughout the 20th Century.\n\nHawaii representative Patsy Mink became the first woman of colour, and first Asian-American woman, to be elected to the House in 1964.\n\nFour years later Shirley Chisholm became the first African-American congresswoman. Born in Brooklyn, she served seven terms and became known as \"Fighting Shirley\" because of her reputation as a champion of racial and gender equality.\n\nFirst female governor\n\nIn 1925, Nellie Tayloe Ross became the first woman to ever hold a US governor post - elected after the death of her husband.\n\nWyoming, where she served, was the first territory in the US to offer suffrage to women - back in 1869.\n\nDespite failing to win re-election, Ross remained in politics and moved to Washington DC.\n\nFirst women to lead political parties\n\nUtah-born Jean Westwood became the first ever woman to chair a political party in 1972 - the same year Congress approved the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nThe New York Times reported that when she expressed her pride at becoming chairman of the Democratic National Committee she was heckled by audience members saying she should be a chairwoman or chairperson instead.\n\n\"I'm proud to be your chairman,\" she reiterated and the matter was settled, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe Republican party followed two years later, when Mary Louise Smith succeeded future president George HW Bush as their chair.\n\nShe was a political moderate and took over in the midst of the party's recovery from the Watergate scandal.\n\nFirst female Supreme Court justice\n\nOf the 114 Supreme Court justices in US history - a staggering 110 have been men.\n\nThe first woman to be nominated to the top court was Sandra Day O'Connor - on the back of a 1980 election campaign pledge by Ronald Reagan.\n\nO'Connor was from Arizona and was unanimously confirmed at a 1981 Senate vote.\n\nShe was followed in 1993 by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, nominated by Bill Clinton.\n\nPresident Obama nominated two more women to the Supreme Court - Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nFirst female attorney general\n\nPresident Bill Clinton chose Janet Reno to lead the US Justice Department in 1993.\n\nAs Attorney General, she oversaw some of the most notorious events in US history including the Waco siege and the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nDuring her tenure, she received a lot of media scrutiny about her physical appearance, especially her 6ft 1in frame.\n\nShe was portrayed by actor Will Ferrell on Saturday Night Live - but turned the joke around in 2006 when she appeared alongside him in a sketch.\n\nFirst female secretary of state\n\nPresident Clinton also nominated the first female secretary of state in US History - Madeleine Albright.\n\nBorn Marie Jana Korbel in then-Czechoslovakia, her family fled to England when the Nazis invaded. Her father was also a diplomat and negotiated their refuge into the US after the war.\n\nHaving previously worked under Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brezensinki, Ms Albright was named as US ambassador to the UN in 1993.\n\nAs secretary of state, from 1997 to 2001, she became known for her firm commitment to human rights.\n\nIn 2005, Condoleezza Rice became the second woman, and first African-American woman, to hold the post.\n\nFirst female speaker\n\nThe incumbent speaker of the House of Representatives is also the first, and only, woman to hold the role.\n\nNancy Pelosi, 79, has led the Democrats in the lower house since 2003, and first became the speaker in 2007.\n\nFollowing the 2018 mid-term results, she returned to the position and is spearheading congressional opposition to President Trump.\n\nShe comes from a family heavily involved in politics, with both her father and brother serving as mayor of Baltimore.\n\nMs Pelosi herself rose up the party ranks in California, where she lived with her family - serving as DNC rep for the state from the 1970s before making the leap into national public office in 1987.\n\nMost women in congress\n\nThe amount of women in Congress has been steadily on the rise since the early 1990s - but the record amount of 127 at present still sits far short of parity.\n\nToday, only about 25% of national lawmakers are women.\n\nNevertheless, the 116th Congress has received widespread praised for its progressive representation.\n\nNotable firsts include the youngest member of Congress elected ever - Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.\n\nThe 2018 success, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, drew comparisons to the previous \"Year of the Woman\" in 1992. In that year, the total amount of women jumped from 32 to 54 in one vote.\n\nMany linked the female success rate to high-profile sexual misconduct cases playing out in public at that time - including Clarence Thomas being confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of harassment lodged by Anita Hill.\n\nThat year six women were elected to the Senate - at a time when they did not even yet have a designated female bathroom nearby.\n\nPotty parity, as it has come to be known, is considered a key marker of institutional misogyny. It took until 2011 for the House of Representatives to get a female restroom nearby to the voting floor.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1990s for old-fashioned attitudes about congresswomen's appearance to change too.\n\nOn one weekend in 1993, Barbara Mikulski - the longest serving female lawmaker ever - plotted a \"pantsuit\" protest against how women were expected to wear skirts.\n\nShe and Senator Nancy Kassebaum told female staffers to show up to Congress in trousers - a move that apparently prompted \"a big stir\" but ultimately helped break the norm.\n\nFirst women on a presidential ticket\n\nGeraldine Ferraro was the first woman to ever be on a major party's presidential ticket, chosen as running mate for Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in the 1984 election.\n\nUnfortunately for them both, Mondale lost heavily to Republican Ronald Reagan - who came out in top in 49 of 50 states.\n\nSarah Palin became the first Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008. The late Senator John McCain was the lead candidate on the ticket - but they lost to Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden.\n\nSo far no woman has served as vice-president of the United States.\n\nFirst female president?\n\nOf course, the dream of a female US president is still also unfulfilled.\n\nWell before Hillary Clinton, other women had also put themselves forward for the top office.\n\nAmong them was Margaret Chase Smith, a pioneer against McCarthyism who ran for the Republican nomination in the 1964 presidential race.\n\nShe was largely without campaign financing - and lost all her primaries - but nonetheless became the first to have her name on the ballot at a major party's convention.\n\nIt took until Hillary Clinton's primary victory in 2016 for a woman to eventually win a major party's candidacy.\n\nClinton already had an impressive public office pedigree - in 2001 becoming the first former first lady to win a political seat of her own.\n\nShe had ran for the Democratic nomination in 2008 but conceded to Barack Obama, before serving as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, the date women could vote for a female president for the first time, many travelled to suffragette graves to leave \"I voted\" stickers.\n\nHowever, in a massive political upset, Clinton lost. She had edged the popular vote overall, but lost the electoral college.\n\nKey swing states, including Florida and Pennsylvania, flipped to Donald Trump and the Republican party - dashing hopes of a female president.\n\nAhead of the 2020 presidential election Democrats are now lining up to take on President Trump.\n\nThis includes six women who have already announced their candidacy - a new record in itself.\n\nWhether or not this means the US may eventually get its first female president, a century on from the 19th Amendment's ratification, time will tell."
