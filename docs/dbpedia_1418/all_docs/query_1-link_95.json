        "text": "African American rural settlements documented: 2\n\nClark County had a large African American population prior to the Civil War. At least two black rural settlements were established by 1870. One settlement, known as Africa, was associated with the village of Memphis in Union Township. The other rural settlement, name unknown, was associated with the village of Watson in Utica Township.\n\nAs a whole, the 19th century African American population of Clark County was significant and rather widely distributed throughout the county. Carl Kramer’s description of the county as “a major black population center” (p 120) provides insight into the challenges of the research process. As in the case of Marion County, issues include trying to frame and define the standard of rural and urban settlement and the challenges of gathering scant bits of information on the African American presence from varied sources. Clark County, one of the earliest sites of European settlement in Indiana, presents a particular challenge in defining an independent rural settlement as opposed to a neighborhood, suburb, or community within a larger context.\n\nIn 1810, Clark County’s population included 40 free people of color and 81 slaves (Kramer p 72). In these early days of the region, slave owners circumvented the prohibition against slavery by indentures. Emma Lou Thornbrough documents 32 such indentures involving 36 individuals, the majority of whom were from Kentucky. Although there was a strong practice of slave holding among white settlers in Clark County, there was also forceful opposition, including Underground Railroad activity.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, Clark County continued to have one of the largest black populations in the state. With a count of 138 African Americans in 1820, Clark ranked second only to Knox County in black population. Although population in the county continued to increase steadily (with the exception of a small drop in the 1860 census), Clark’s black population was superseded by rapid growth in counties where there was a strong Quaker presence. Clark County’s black population increased from 520 in 1860 to 1,970 in 1870, an increase of 278.8 percent. Growth slowed in the next decade rising to 2,536 (28.7 percent). Clark County ranked as the third largest black population of Indiana’s counties exceeded only by Marion & Vanderburgh Counties (Kramer p 174).\n\nIn contrast to other counties with large African American populations, black residents of Clark County ranked relatively low in terms of land ownership. Herbert Heller examined black land holdings for the year 1850. Of the top nine counties, Clark ranked last with 24 African American property owners. Holdings were valued at $10,240 in 1850 (Thornbrough p140). The number of opportunities for employment in industrial enterprises may have been a factor in the lower numbers of black landowners.\n\nData extracted from the 1870 census indicates that most African American men found employment as farm laborers or general laborers. There are far fewer black or mulatto farmers. Other occupations reported include barber, plasterer, painter, carpenter, teamster, stone mason, railroad worker, boat steward, boat porter, wood cutter, and butcher. Black female heads of households are most often listed as “keeping house” with a significant number of women listing their employment as washerwomen. (Hannah Toliver, 44 years old in the 1870 census, is enumerated as a washerwoman. Her anti-slavery activities are commemorated with an historic marker in Jeffersonville.)\n\nThe majority of heads of black households give Kentucky as place of nativity with Indiana nativity as strong second. Other states of origin include Ohio, the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, Alabama, and Mississippi. William Washington, a 25 year old mulatto farmer, gives Canada as his place of birth. Family names include Thornton, Mitchum/Michum, Washington, Smith, McCoy, Bland, Tandy, Wilson, Hardin, Russell, Henson, Gill, Slaughter, Clemens, Bibb, Taylor, Kiphart and Hampton.\n\nUnion Township, Africa\n\nThe African American settlement associated with the village of Memphis was known as Africa. Memphis was laid out in 1852 at the crossing of Blue Lick Road and the railroad tracks. A contemporary informant stated that historically major components of commerce in the town included mills, cooperages and the manufacture of staves. It was indicated that African Americans were not employed in those industries but worked instead as farm laborers. Unfortunately the microfilm for Union Township is almost illegible. making it difficult to extract much information given limitations of time. The index to the 1870 census lists 20 households headed by African Americans and 1 white household with African American members. Occupations are almost exclusively laborer or farm laborer. The nativity of black residents conforms to that of Clark County in general. Kentucky leads as place of birth with Indiana a close second. Other states include Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas. Family names include Scott, Montgomery, Hansberry, Helm, Tyler, Blakemore, Adams Bibb, Jefferson, Ball and Blakey.\n\nMemphis maintained two schools—one for white students and one for “colored” students. Of the approximately 100 students, about a quarter of them were black. Black Methodists and black Baptists held joint services in their school-house. A cemetery was begun about 1840 in a “private yard” belonging to a Mr. Weir. African Americans buried their dead in a half acre area “alongside” the Weir yard. It was reported to be “handsomely situated and neatly fenced.”\n\nUtica Township, Watson\n\nThe unnamed African American settlement associated with the village of Watson was located along the Utica-Sellersburg Road. The village of Watson itself had its origins with the relocation of a cement mill to a spot near the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Watson was formally platted in 1876 with the objective of providing housing for workers at the mill. While a number of small towns in Utica Township were hostile to African Americans (e.g. the towns of Utica with sunset laws), Watson was described in a newspaper account as “a harboring place for them [African Americans] in considerable numbers.”\n\nMany of the residents of the Watson settlement were farm laborers or ordinary laborers. Of the 33 black heads of households in the township, there was only a single black farmer: Lowry Straws, a 43 year old man from Kentucky. Straws is enumerated with property valued at just over $1000. The index to the 1870 census lists 15 white heads of households whose households included black members. The County Historian related that a number of African Americans worked at the Fry settlement, a farm owned by white people about 2 miles from the village of Watson on the Utica-Sellersburg Road. One of the farm hands, Reuben Johnson, was arrested in the 1850s for aiding people fleeing slavery and later served with the 108th Colored Infantry of Kentucky. Family names include Mitchem, Hawkins, Kiphart, Carter, Straws, Johnson, Hampton, Steers, Haydon/Hayden, Mattox, and Dorsey.\n\nAlthough Watson was a small municipality, there was a white school and a “colored” school. About forty students attended the colored school. Watson also had two Sunday schools—“white and colored”, as well as an African Methodist Church. Briar Hill Cemetery has been identified as an African American burial place. The Clark County historian stated that a tombstone for a Civil War veteran named McCormick was found at Briar Hill. African American residents also chartered an Odd Fellows’ lodge.\n\nThe following township descriptions illustrate where else in Clark County African Americans settled. Many of these places appear to be neighborhoods in towns or cities prior to 1870.\n\nJeffersonville Township\n\nThe large majority of Clark County’s black residents lived in Jeffersonville Township either in Jeffersonville proper or in towns, communities and neighborhoods associated with Jeffersonville and Clarksville as well as smaller nearby municipalities.\n\nJeffersonville (Town)\n\nThe black population of Jeffersonville was large enough to result in the development of institutions such as the First Colored Baptist Church organized about 1861 by Philip Simcoe (located on Illinois Street between Seventh and Eighth Streets). Simcoe also organized Second Colored Baptist (located at the intersection of Indiana Avenue and Sixth Street) about 1865 following a split from First Baptist. Wesleyan Methodists began worship in Jeffersonville following the Civil War eventually moving from a modest frame building to a new structure in 1876 south of the community of Claysburg on Watt Street. Educational aspirations were fulfilled at Jeffersonville Colored High School established as early as 1872; renamed Taylor High School in 1924 to honor a beloved principal. In 1878 Prince Hall Masons chartered North Star Lodge No. 3. at 801 Spring Street.\n\nOther Communities in Jefferson Communities\n\nAlthough other writers often use the word “settlement” in reference to a range of communities/neighborhoods, without more detailed study and documentation, I hesitate to classify these communities as such. A list of black and/or racially mixed communities with descriptions follows.\n\nGuinea Bottom or Guinea Bottoms\n\nLocated near the western edge of Clarksville; adjoins the B&O railroad.\n\nAs early as 1802 or 1803 “influential pioneer families” quartered their slaves in this low, swampy area. Jeffersonville newspapers in the 19th century reported that General George Rogers Clark “brought the first colored family to Indiana, Uncle Tom and Aunt Esther, with twelve children, whom he settled in a spot called Guinea Bottom.” General Clark’s farm on outlot 127 encompassed a portion of Guinea Bottom. News accounts also mention “the Goodwins brought the second colored family as slaves and settled them in Guinea Bottom” The article continues with the dubious claim “ …and so formed the first Negro settlement” [in Indiana]; then, hedging, they make a possible exception for Vincennes.\n\nBen and Venus McGee are better documented as being among the first residents of Guinea Bottom. Records exist showing that Ben McGee was “once enslaved by the Clark family” (Brown p34). Documents in the Kentucky Archives record Ben McGee’s manumission on December 10, 1802, and his subsequent indenture papers signed one day later. Rob Loy/Lloyd, a free man of color, was another early resident.\n\nIn 1905, the town of Clarksburg, in an “…effort to create a pure white city…” attempted to expel its black residents by “…de-annexing Guinea Bottoms where most lived.” By 1940, Clarksville was “devoid” of African Americans (Kramer p257).\n\nJeanne Burke, Clark County Historian, is of the opinion that a strong case could be made for classifying Guinea Bottom as a rural settlement for a part of its existence. Clearly, this is an important subject that needs additional research.\n\nClaysburg\n\nPlatted in 1856 by Dr. Nathaniel Field (a noted white abolitionist), William Riddle and Edward Schon.\n\nNamed for Cassius M. Clay, a Kentucky abolitionist.\n\nWalter K. Kiser uses the terms “surburb [sic] of Jeffersonville” and “a separate section from Jeffersonville” and states that “Claysburg is largely a colored settlement.” Eventually became Jeffersonville’s “largest black neighborhood” (Kramer p139).\n\nMany of the African Americans residing in Claysburg found employment with the railroad company and other nearby industries.\n\nResidents established Bethel AME Church as early as 1842. Other African American churches included Trinity Baptist (15th and Spring Streets), Gilt Edge Baptist (Green Street), Indiana Baptist and Walnut Ridge Baptist.\n\nClaysburg schools were segregated with separate white and “colored” schools. A park, U.S. Negro Enterprise Association Park, also known as Beech Grove Park, was established. Other institutions were segregated as well including the Dixie Theater and a separate grocery store. Many restaurants and other public accommodations refused service to African Americans. Claysburg was eventually annexed to the city of Jeffersonville in 1948.\n\nLick Skillet\n\nLick Skillet was the colloquial name for the Lattimer & Savage Subdivision of the town of Port Fulton. Victor Neff laid out Port Fulton in 1835 about a mile and a half upstream from Jeffersonville’s Spring Street (Kramer p100-101). “Leap frog growth became a characteristic pattern of development in Jeffersonville and Clark Co” (Kramer p 100). Port Fulton was bounded by the river, Jackson Street, Division Street. The town attracted ship builders and others associated with maritime industries. Saloons were plentiful. Lick Skillet itself was prone to flooding. During the 1960s Port Fulton was the subject of large scale urban renewal projects.\n\nOther Communities in Jeffersonville Township/Jeffersonville (Town)\n\nBucktown: an area west of Jeffersonville, needs further documentation.\n\nCementville: village six miles north of Jeffersonville developed around cement industry; needs further documentation.\n\nGibsonville: a “small settlement east of Downtown Jeffersonville” (Kramer, p311). According to Clark County historian it was a disparaging name for Claysburg’s Watt Street intended to convey exaggerated status. Mentioned in Jeffersonville newspaper accounts as early as 1873; has news brief in 1887 on topic of church rally held by Pastor E. Miller.\n\nPrison Hill: a “predominately black neighborhood” in Jeffersonville and notable victim of I-65 development c. 1956” (Kramer p 412). County historian locates the neighborhood east of the Colgate Palmolive building and considered the area racially mixed.\n\nSand Hill: Rural area east of Port Fulton along 8th Street/Middle Road. Small farms with sandy soil. Family names from 20th century include James, Lee and Lindsay. Sand Hill was considered an integrated area.\n\nSassiegamus (also spelled Sassygamus): associated with Jeffersonville Springs founded in 1819 by Swiss immigrant John Fischli. Many patrons of the springs were attracted by opportunities to gamble (Kramer p 144-115). It is assumed that this neighborhood housed the black employees of the resort.\n\nSlabtown: located “below the bridge fill”; also known as West End and Egypt. Clark County historian places it west of Jeffersonville and east of the Colgate Palmolive building. She indicated that it was a racially mixed neighborhood and the name Egypt derived from darker skin tones in the population.\n\nCharlestown Township, Charlestown (Town)\n\nIn analyzing population trends of Indiana’s 19th century “nonrural communities,” Emma Lou Thornbrough includes the town of Charlestown as one of eight towns in the state designated as nonrural with the largest black population. In 1860, Charlestown’s African American population was tallied at 198 persons, an increase from the 1850 count of 154 persons. Further, Thornbrough notes that these figures represent 6 percent of the total population of the city. It is interesting to note that in 1860 New Albany ranked first both in black population and in percentage of total population with 627 African American residents making up 7.5 percent of the town. Indianapolis, which had the 2nd largest black population (498 persons), was only 2.6 percent black (Thornbrough 141). It is also worth noting that in a decade where the black population of Clark County as a whole decreased, the population of the town of Charleston increased. By 1870, the population of Charleston more than doubled to a count of 410.\n\nIn addition to labor, various censuses also inventory an interesting range of skilled trades among the black residents of Charlestown that included blacksmith, miller, plasterer, carpenter, cabinet maker, shoemaker, brick molder, tailor, teamster, river pilot, boatman, wagon maker, miniature painter and weaver. Kentucky and Indiana are the primary places of birth.\n\nDespite it’s significant numbers, Charlestown’s African American residents were mostly restricted to a neighborhood with the unfortunate name of Nigger Hill, a name still in common use to this day. The neighborhood is located on the southwest edge of Charlestown. Black students attended a segregated school. The Charlestown Public Library has a catalog with a roster of students in the “colored department” as well as a photograph of students outside the Carver Hill School, a one-room school house.\n\nBethel AME Church began before 1857 as the Charlestown Meeting House. Reverend W.A. Mitchem was one of the first ministers to preach. Tradition has it that preachers also served as school teachers. The church built a second structure in 1857. County histories indicate that the cemetery in Charlestown has “subdivisions” for “strangers, suicides and colored people.” The John Brown Post 585 of the GAR, an African American chapter, was organized in 1890. Although short-lived, Charlestown even had a newspaper with an African American perspective. Begun in May 1859, William Greenlee’s effort ceased publication shortly after it began (Kramer 156).\n\nBibliography\n\nAbby, Margaret. “Taylor High: Their School is Gone but Not Their Spirit.” Jeffersonville Evening News, January 24, 2002.\n\n“Back in the Early Days.” Jeffersonville Daily Evening News, August 27, 1889, p2.\n\nBaird, Lewis C.

Werle “Research Notes on Indiana African American History,” M 792, William Henry Smith Memorial Library, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nBy Georgia Cravey, October 21, 2014\n\nAfrican American rural settlements documented: 1\n\nThere was one small unnamed settlement in Sugar Creek Township of Hancock County. John Delaney, born in Virginia about 1788, appears to be the nucleus of this community. An enterprising man, he purchased 140 acres of land in Hancock County in 1833. He established a tavern on the Old Brookville Road (SR 52) a mile west of present day New Palestine. The tavern would be located advantageously at a midway point between Indianapolis and Rush County, home to both the Beech settlement and the town of Carthage. His wife, Maryland native, Sarah Delaney, had a reputation as a good cook. The building is currently a private home still standing at 5714 W US Highway 52; Palestine.\n\nListed in the 1850 census as a farmer, Delaney is also identified as an early grocer in the county. Both John and Sarah are enumerated as mulatto. It is interesting that accounts of the Delaneys in the standard county histories do not mention race. They are buried in the small cemetery west of New Palestine situated near the site of their former tavern. Other burials in the Delaney Cemetery record the names Cambridge, Malson and Burns. Genealogy forums discuss much intermarriage among these families. Other names encountered nearby include Butler, Chavis/Chevis, Custor, Griffin, Locklear, Roberts, and Washington.\n\nAlthough it bears more investigation, this settlement seems to have an interesting racial composition. Some of the households in this area appear to be headed by white men who have married “mulatto” women and raised large families. (E.g. the 1850 census lists Francis Malson, a farmer, 36 years old, white, married to Jane Malson, a 33 year old mulatto woman born in Kentucky with five mulatto children in the household.)\n\nJoe Skvarenina, Hancock County Historian, considers racial identity in this area as fluid at the time.\n\nIn another example of racial fluidity (and again, more careful research is needed) it would seem that John H. Cambridge (farmer, born in Maryland) and Matilda Malson Cambridge, (possibly born in Ohio), residents in the Sugar Creek vicinity, were the parents of several children. In 1850 the entire household is enumerated as mulatto. However, some sources indicate that their son Edwin later served in the 2nd regiment, Indiana Calvary, a “white” unit, rather than in a unit of the United States Colored Troops.\n\nGeorge Richman relates an incident that illustrates the nature of second class citizenship that people of color experienced in the area. “About 1853-1854 several families came from Cincinnati…they seemed to be progressive and set about soliciting donations… for a more modern school…A mulatto…Lafe Cambridge had subscribed and paid his money…When he sent his children, objections were raised because they were colored…The children were not permitted to attend.”\n\nTwo of Hancock County’s nine townships did not have any African American population between 1840 and 1870. The numbers are sparse for the other townships with Sugar Creek having the largest black population. In 1840, there is a population of 16. In 1850, there are 41 people. 1860 is the peak year with a population of 48. By 1870 the numbers decline to 11.\n\nThe only township to experience an increase in its black population in the 1870 census is Center Township where the county seat of Greenfield is located. The count grows from 9 in 1850, to 17 in 1860, to 31 in 1870.\n\nIn his autobiography, George Knox gives a unique look at life in Greenfield. Knox, a one time barber, successful businessman, owner and publisher of an influential black newspaper, was born a slave in Tennessee. In 1863 he crossed into Union troop lines eventually making his way to Indiana. In 1865 Knox opened a barbershop in Greenfield, a town which Knox himself described as a place where “prejudice was very high.” Nevertheless, Knox and fellow black citizens created fulfilling lives establishing such organizations as a literary club, a debate society, a church and a school. Camp meetings in the countryside drew large crowds of both races.\n\nRace relations come to a head in the decades following the Civil War. When groups of African Americans made attempts to settle in Hancock County warnings were posted, barns burned and livestock killed (Thornbrough, p 222-223). In 1875 a notorious lynching occurred. Armed and masked vigilantes from three counties broke into a jail and took their victim to the county fairgrounds where they hung him. Knox, described as an “accommodationist”, was able to withstand the pressures and controversy. However in 1884, no doubt recognizing his vulnerability as a black man, he ultimately relocated to Indianapolis.\n\nBibliography\n\nBinford, J. H. History of Hancock County, Indiana.

The county was established in 1808. Corydon was Indiana’s territorial capital from 1813-1816 . It served as the state’s first capital from 1816-1825. Indiana was a part of the Northwest Territory and although slavery was prohibited in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, it was tolerated. Many of Indiana’s earliest white settlers, largely from the slave states of Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky, brought enslaved people to Indiana. Indentured servitude was used to circumvent anti slavery laws. Thus, the status of free African Americans in Indiana and in Harrison County was tenuous. In her book, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, Emma Lou Thornbrough cites the 1810 census in Harrison County as listing 21 slaves and 12 free persons of color.\n\nA few years after this early census, ca. 1814, a large enclave of about 100 African Americans migrated into Harrison County with an elderly white couple, Paul and Susannah Mitchem, who eventually freed them. Their story is very unusual since the freedom seekers comprised such a large group and were accompanied by their benefactors who settled among them. Most of those who came into Harrison County with the Mitchems took the name Mitchem. Other family names included Finley, Carter, and Cousins. These new agrarian settlers became land owners, business owners, and one, Littleton Mitchem, was a physician. Also, there is no evidence to suggest the settlers were coerced into signing indentures. Due to the size of the Mitchem Settlement, the families fanned out throughout the county, but most stayed in or around Corydon. The townships where the African American population was located include Harrison, Boone, Webster, and Heth.\n\nPerhaps, the most notable among the Mitchems was a man who came to free territory with this enclave but ended up settling in St. Louis, Missouri. His name was John Berry Mitchem and according to a first person account, he purchased his freedom from Paul Mitchem and then earned enough money to walk 700 miles to Virginia and 700 miles back to Kentucky to purchase his father’s freedom. After marrying an enslaved woman from Kentucky, he followed her to St. Louis after her master took her there. John Berry Mitchem is listed as one of the early settlers of St. Louis who contributed to the state of Missouri’s development. He distinguished himself as the minister of a large Baptist Church in St. Louis and as the founder of a freedom school that was conducted on a Mississippi River vessel since it was illegal for African Americans to attend school in Missouri.\n\nAfter the Civil War, another in-migration of African Americans relocated to Harrison County, most of who came from Meade County, Kentucky, which is the closest Kentucky county to Harrison. These families settled in various areas of the county, but most eventually migrated into Corydon, where a downtown church/school combination had been built about 1851. Other churches, Collins Chapel, which was also a church/school, one unnamed on the South Hill, and St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (organized about 1882) drew the African American population into Corydon. Today St. Paul AME has more white members than African American. Collins Chapel, founded in 1868 in Boone Township, no longer exists.\n\nIn 1891, the Corydon Colored School , a public school for African American elementary and high school students was built by the Corydon Schools. The high school was discontinued in 1925 due to a lack of high school age students; however the elementary school was continued until 1950. It closed because there were not enough elementary-age students to constitute having a teacher unit. Now called the Leora Brown School, the building was rehabilitated over twenty years ago as an historic site and educational and cultural center.\n\nMost of the Mitchem Settlement members were buried in Corydon in Cedar Hill, the historic town cemetery that was begun in 1808. Many of the early settlers’ graves are at the front of the cemetery. The cemetery is not segregated. In addition, there are three small Mitchem family cemeteries.\n\nBibliography\n\nBrown, Maxine. “Mitchem Family and Settlement, Free Men of Color in Harrison County, Early 1800’s.” Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, Spring, 2009\n\nBulleit, F.

Informants mention areas that seem to be more like neighborhoods but further investigation is warranted. The areas are the Stockyards (1859-1870s) on the east side of Franklin; an unnamed area of Franklin centered on West Madison Street (1860s to present); an unnamed, undefined area in Edinburgh; and Idlewilde in Hensley Township which never developed as the platted lots were too small.\n\nIn 1830 the census shows a total of six free people of color residing in the county. Milly Magill heads a household of three minor children in Franklin Township where the town of Franklin is located. The other two enumerated individuals live in Nineveh and Blue River Townships.\n\nIn 1840 the population increases to 20 persons, but the 1850 figure declines to 15. Of those 15, 9 are residing in the town of Franklin. The others are distributed in townships as follows: Blue River, 2; Hensley, 1; Pleasant, 2; White River, 1. By the 1860 census the count is 19 African Americans. As in the previous decade the majority, 14 people, live in the town of Franklin.\n\nThe racial attitudes of antebellum Johnson County were not particularly warm. An anecdote about the fair of 1860 relates how in a racist manner Richard “Dick” Blakey was prohibited from a foot race competition. During the Civil War Blakey enlisted in the 28th United States Colored Troops. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of the Crater, and ultimately starves to death in Libby Prison. County histories also relate that sentiments were in favor of “conciliation” and a “willing[ness] to continue slavery” rather than go to war. The counterpoint to these attitudes is the evidence of the county’s Underground Railroad activity.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, Johnson County experienced a surge in overall population due to an influx of people from the south. The African American population of 1870, although a small percentage, increased significantly to 115 people. The majority of the population is still located in the town of Franklin. The increase is also reflected in Franklin Township’s population of 10 persons exclusive of the town of Franklin. Edinburgh experienced growth as well with a population of 24 (up from the 3 people counted in 1860). Three of the six townships (Hensley, Nineveh, and White River) counted no African Americans. Blue River (exclusive of Edinburgh), Pleasant and Clark Townships each had a single individual and Union Township had two persons enumerated.\n\nAn analysis of the 1880 census indicated that the largest number of adults enumerated were from Kentucky (117 persons of the 172 adult total). Other states of origin included North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. There were also 25 Indiana-born citizens as well as 5 immigrants from Canada. Adam and Clayton Moore are believed to be the first of the arrivals from Kentucky followed by the Fossett family. Most found worked as farm laborers or sharecroppers.\n\nThe story of an individual Greenwood resident, probably the single person of color counted in 1870 in Pleasant Township might be illuminating. Mary Ann Cain, an enslaved person from Natchez, Mississippi, ran away about 1864. She encountered Captain Richard Wishard of Pleasant Township during her flight and continued north with him eventually working in his home as a domestic for eight years. The brief, unattributed article about her life begins “…there have been few, if any, of the colored race living in Greenwood. Not that the inhabitants had anything against the colored people, but it seems that for some reason or other they did not settle here.” In discussion with the librarian at the Johnson County Historical Museum, it was mentioned that property deeds in Greenwood had restrictive racial covenants and that even if an African American resident of Franklin were employed in Greenwood, that person came home to Franklin at night. Mary Ann Cain was apparently the exception.\n\nThe town of Franklin seems to have been a somewhat more tolerant environment for African Americans than other parts of the county. Two churches were established: Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Franklin in 1868 and Second Baptist Church of Franklin (Colored) organized in 1871. Rev. Whitton Lankford led the AME congregation whose family names included Hammond, Leonard, Elkins, Blakely and Stark. Second Baptist’s first three pastors were William Singleton (1871-1872), Thomas Robinson (1872-1874) and E.E. Tyler (1874-1880). The congregation included the following surnames Clark, Beaty, and Blakemore/Blakeman.\n\nTolerance had limits. County histories note that “colored children were admitted to free common school privileges by an act of May 13, 1869. So, “for a time thereafter” children were enrolled at the “old school district.” When the school was sold on July 16, 1870, no permanent provisions were made until 1873. At that time lots were purchased and a school house was built. Laura Overbay taught the first school year of 1875-1876 at what was first known as the West School, later renamed for Booker T. Washington. Its graduates were “allowed” to attend Franklin High School.\n\nNewspaper accounts note that unlike many other Indiana cities, Franklin did not practice a hard line on segregation until the 1940s. During World War II, 6,000 members of a black infantry company were stationed at Camp Atterbury. In response, the restaurants in Franklin banned all blacks, both local and military, from their businesses and a separate USO for the black troops was organized.\n\nThe growth of African American population in Edinburgh is reflected in research done for Rest Haven Cemetery. A history of the cemetery notes “The registration of the fifty-eight free Blacks in Bartholomew County in 1853 started the movement of the Blacks north into Johnson County’s Blue River Township during the 1860s.” Names of Edinburg families from the 1870 census include Farley, Larne, Martin, Lewis, Scott, Henry and Atchison.\n\nA church was organized by 1881, Edinburg Baptist (Colored). Led by Rev A. R. [or John?] Miller, the congregation included families with the names Gooden, Canady, Hill, Quinn, Beeler, Johnson, Gooden, and Lee. Rev. Miller was briefly succeeded by Rev. Mr. Walker who was followed by Rev. David Slaughter. In 1888, Slaughter pastored a membership of some 100 people. According to early records special trains ran from Indianapolis for church gatherings held at the fairgrounds. Edinburgh Baptist persisted into the 1960s when outmigration to Columbus and Franklin gained momentum.\n\nEdinburgh did not build a school for African American students until 1891. Twenty-seven students attended classes. The building still stands and houses the Church of Edinburgh Independent Baptists.\n\nBibliography\n\nBanta, David. History of Johnson County, Indiana.

The two settlements also had connections with Clear Lake Settlement in Porter County, the Huggart Settlement in Saint Joseph County, and the black community in Cass County, Michigan.\n\nThe Banks Settlement in Centre Township was located two miles north of the city of La Porte. African Americans owned property in several sections of the township. Surnames of those residing in the settlement included Armstead, Banks, Destarch, Dogan (Dugan), McClellain, and Medford. In 1856, Thomas Dugan married Milly Butter, who possibly had a connection to the Nathaniel Butter farm in Berrien County, Michigan. There is also likely a connection with the Clear Lake Settlement in Porter County as a Banks also lived there, and the property borders those living in La Porte County. The first Banks Settlement property owner was Adam Medford, who came with his family from New Jersey. He purchased twenty acres on April 15, 1839. The 1840 census lists John Banks living next to the Medford farm (bringing the Banks Settlement population up to nine). The 1850 federal census records and land deeds show that the Medfords had increased their acreage to a value of $1,000 and new neighbors of the Medfords, Berry and Lucinda Banks owned $50 worth of property. Berry Banks was originally from Virginia and his wife Lucinda was from Kentucky. They had migrated to Indiana, where their first child, Jemima, was born by 1838. Berry was elected to the trustees of the African Methodist Protestant Meetinghouse in La Porte.\n\nBy 1860, the Banks Settlement had reached its peak, when thirty-eight individuals resided in five households, of which, three were land owners. Because of the proximity to the town of La Porte, these farming families most likely would have had social connections to the large population of African Americans living in town. The Banks Settlement’s population had declined by the 1870s. The only new owner of property in the settlement at that time was Jackson McClellain, who came from Mississippi and bought forty acres of land near the Medfords.\n\nThe Henderson Settlement, a smaller community consisted of two-square miles of land and was located in Lincoln Township. From 1844, at least three African American families lived on this land. The Hendersons, Thompsons, and Wanzers (or Warners) came from Virginia. Terry Goldsworthy suggests that these families might have migrated to Indiana in response to the 1831 Nat Turner Rebellion. The settlement reached its population peak in 1860, when seventeen individuals were counted. At this time, Joseph and Debby Wanzer owned property worth $2,200 and the Henderson’s property was valued at $800. The Thompsons, who did not own land, had their personal estate listed at $50. By 1870, John Henderson who owned the 80-acre nucleus of the settlement had passed, and the population decreased to 15 people and only two families remained in the area. By 1880, the Thompsons had relocated to the Banks Settlement and only Joseph Wanzer remained at the Henderson Settlement.\n\nThere are also other accounts of African Americans living in the county, particularly the town of La Porte before 1870. The first known African American settler in La Porte County was Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, who has commonly been called the Founder of Chicago. He was in Indiana before moving on to Michigan, and Illinois.\n\nGoldsworthy estimates that up to 50% of African Americans that lived in the county lived in rural areas, and had farming occupations at these settlements or on farms of nearby whites. The La Porte County Historical Society has a large collection of primary source materials related to these settlements and other African Americans that were included in the large population numbers of La Porte County.\n\nBibliography\n\n“African Methodist Protestant Meeting House-Election of Trustees, March 31, 1845.” Recorder Book O, Page 412, March 6, 1845.

Over time it was known as Sunnyside and West Parkview.\n\nMarion County has been a challenging county to research. One difficulty in the process has been trying to frame and define the standard of rural and urban settlement. Another issue has been the challenge of analyzing the most populous county in the state. A final concern is the relatively paltry level of detail available in the written record on the townships of Marion County, especially the record of the African Americans who lived outside of the city limits.\n\nEmma Lou Thornbrough observes that by 1860, Indianapolis had “one of the largest Negro communities in the state” as well as noting “… there were also Negroes in the rural parts of Marion County.” (p52) The 1840 census enumerated 122 African Americans living in Indianapolis and an additional 72 African Americans living in Center Township outside city limits. In 1850 the African American population of the city increased substantially to 405 persons while those living in Center Township exclusive of Indianapolis increased slightly to 144 persons. In 1860 the city population continued to rise (498 persons) as does the population in Center Township (210 persons). The astonishing increase comes in 1870 when the city population reaches 2,931 and Center Township’s population doubles to 433. Total Marion County population leaps from the 1860 count of 825 to 3, 938 (Thornbrough 211).\n\nJames Divita summarizes the long view of settlement patterns in Indianapolis. He notes that Marion County’s African American population was present in the city from the beginnings of the county and finds that in 1830 the largest populations of rural African Americans were in Wayne and Washington Townships. Perry and Warren had small populations. The lowest numbers were in Lawrence and Franklin Townships. Divita states that in 1840 “Both Irish and blacks appear to be residents of Ward 5 and in the district west of West Street” (p11). Divita also notes the construction of Second Baptist Church (colored) in Ward 6 on Missouri Street between Ohio and New York Streets in 1849.\n\nIn the 1850s two per cent of Marion County’s population was black. Most of the 835 African Americans (708) lived in Center Township. The remainder of the population was distributed in every township except Lawrence and Pike. African Americans living in the city limits were distributed in every ward, but the highest concentration was in ward 4 (north of Washington Street and west of Mississippi Street (present day Senate Avenue) and in Ward 5 (south of Washington Street and West of Illinois Street). Part of this area was dubbed “Bucktown.”\n\nAudrey Werle’s 1870 Index to heads of households lists 60 households in Center Township outside city limits headed by African Americans. Farm laborer is a common occupation as is unspecified laborer. The list also includes occupations such as gardener, hod carrier, whitewasher, teamster, carpenter, and ice peddler. Places of birth are varied: Kentucky, North Carolina and Indiana predominate with representation from Maryland, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Missouri and New York. A large number of households headed by white persons also include African Americans. Family names represented include Winslow, Moore, Roberts, Harvey, Williams, Washington, Walden, Wilson, Tolbert and Young. (See 1870 index for complete listing Werle, M0792.)\n\nMarion County offered economic opportunity over the decades and African American arrived seeking employment and community. For the project’s time period (pre statehood through 1870), Indianapolis lead the state in African American population and a rich cultural life continued to evolve. There are many possibilities for further research.\n\nUnnamed settlement in Bridgeport, Wayne Township:\n\nThe Wayne Township village of Bridgeport is situated on the National Road at the west edge of Marion County. It was platted in 1831. Wayne Township reported 34 African Americans in the 1840 Marion County census, second only to Center Township’s count of 72. In 1850, the count was 27 and in 1860, there were 23 African Americans. 1870 saw a significant increase when the population rose sharply to 174.\n\nFurther analysis of the 1870 census reveals 34 households in Wayne Township with one or more black persons in the household. Of those households, 24 were headed by an African American. The count included 3 black or mulatto farmers: Joseph T. Fossett/Fawcett, Martin Davis and Isaac Wilson. Twenty-six African American men reported working as farm laborers. Most of the 1870 population had their origins in Kentucky. Other states of origin included North Carolina, Virginia, Indiana and Tennessee.\n\nAccording to records of the First Baptist Church, Bridgeport (also know as White Lick Creek Colored Baptist Church), the first members of the congregation came to the Bridgeport area in August of 1864. They held their first services in the Friends Church. (It might be assumed that this is the Bridgeport Friends Meeting located ½ mile northwest of Bridgeport (Cline, p 541)). In 1865 the congregation “joined with the second church of Indianapolis” (Second Baptist Church in Indianapolis was pastored by Reverend Moses Broyles). When that association proved “inconvenient”, they held services in a Hendricks County schoolhouse (# 6) where they developed an association with the small African Methodist Episcopal church in Plainfield. The church had a number of locations over the course of its existence before 1891 when the church dedicated the edifice they still occupied in 1925 at 8730 W. Washington Street. Some members of the White Lick Colored Baptist Church joined with a group from Lick Creek Baptist Church, whih was near Beech Grove, to form a new congregation named Mount Zion Baptist Church in 1869.\n\nIn 1884, Wayne Township had two “colored schools” (Sulgrove, p 665). Perry Township was the only other outlying townships to note separate schools. Two black teachers taught thirty-one black male students and forty-two female students.\n\nA white dentist by the name of Dr. Welsh made his summer home on a twenty acre parcel along Girls School Road, south of the old New York Central Railroad. In the late 1890s he divided his property into four-acre tracts to be sold only to “colored people.” Moses Williams, another white man, owned twenty acres adjoining Sunnyside and decided to follow suit in 1900 naming his area West Parkview.\n\nThe first family to build was the Williams family completing their home around 1910. Other families followed and by 1914, the neighborhood was becoming well established. “Old settlers” included the names Coleman, Smith, Walker, Brown, Pettiford, Johnson, Garret, Abernathy, Flemings, Kimble, Cables and Wathen. There were no roads, only paths. Families raised animals for meat and kept gardens. Through the efforts of residents, Sunnyside/West Parkview got electricity in 1941. Another collective effort resulted in the organization of a civic club house. In response to a tragic fire in the 1950s, the community converted the civic club building to a fire station. Pennies were saved to purchase a fire truck.\n\nBibliography\n\nAtlas of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana, 1889 (reprint). Mt.

Wright, Jr., the exodus of Quakers from North Carolina was a major factor in the settlement of African Americans in Randolph County. Deborah Rotman updates the research with a detailed study of the settlement of the county. She finds that many of the first black settlers had “strong connections to individual Quakers and Quaker meetings” in their areas of origin (most often North Carolina and Virginia, (p 29)). Further, much of Randolph County’s settlement was mingled with that of Wayne County (p 32). Both enclaves were strongly and actively abolitionist and much movement occurred between the two counties and in the area bordering the Ohio state line.\n\nRotman describes three main groups of immigrants:\n\n1) Individuals and families with longstanding status as free people (p. 36)\n\n2) Recently manumitted slaves (p. 37)\n\n3) Fugitive slaves (p. 39)\n\nA distinctive feature of life in Randolph County was the level of cooperation between the races. Emblematic of this attitude was the establishment in 1845 of Union Literary Institute. Founded as an integrated, co-ed, manual training school, the charter forbade discrimination. Students were admitted without regard to “color, rank, or wealth.” In addition to students from the immediate locale, families throughout Indiana and Ohio as well as other states enrolled their children. The school was a great hub for contacts among other Indiana counties such as Henry and Rush as well as students from outside Indiana. Thornbrough considered the school “the most significant and successful experiment in Negro education’ in Indiana (p173).\n\nAlso illustrative of progressive racial attitudes, Randolph was also one of only four Indiana counties to vote in opposition to Article XIII of the 1851 State Constitution [Tucker (p 134) Thornbrough (p 68) Rotman, (p52)]. Among other restrictive measures, Article XIII excluded “Negroes” from entering Indiana.\n\nSources report 1822 as the year that the families in the vanguard begin to arrive in Randolph County often relocating from interim residence in Wayne County, Indiana, and from Ohio. Family groups of Scotts, Alexanders, Outlands, Robbinses, Demorys/Demarys settled on some 1500 acres. Between 1822 and 1838, Wright reports that 2000 acres of land were entered by a dozen black families who migrated chiefly from North Carolina. Additional family names include Chanous (Virginia), Brown (Tennessee), Burden and Cotman (South Carolina), Benson (North Carolina) McKeon/McKown/McCown, Stokes and Tann.\n\nThe history of African American settlement in Randolph County is notable for its three large, prosperous communities: Cabin Creek, Snow Hill and Greenville.\n\nGreenville, it should be noted, is part of a community that encompassed land on both sides of the Indiana/Ohio state line. The Darke County, Ohio, portion of the settlement is known as Longtown or simply Long. Greenville was the earliest of the three settlements, the first settler being Thornton Alexander. Alexander entered 300 acres of land in 1822. Born in Culpepper County Virginia, he was freed from slavery at age thirty-six. The Alexander family migrated to Greenville from Warren County, Ohio.\n\nCabin Creek was established about 1825 by John Demory who came with Lemuel Vestal from North Carolina. Demory is described by E. Tucker as a “free-born, half Frenchman.” He was born in Charleston, South Carolina and married Sarah Robinson in Anson County, North Carolina. The couple would eventually have eleven children and own eighty acres of land in Washington Township as well as a house and lot in the town of Winchester.\n\nSoon after Demory’s arrival in Cabin Creek, Drew Taylor and his family settled on Eight Mile Creek and the Obadiah Anderson family settled in the southwest part of the county. Eventually Cabin Creek was home to “some eighty to one hundred families and several hundred people according to E. Tucker (p. 134). Writing in 1882, Tucker further notes that “the number has materially lessened” with many families “having sold their possessions and moved to locations more suited to their notions.” He reports that “thirty to forty families remain.” Additional family names in Cabin Creek were Scott, Crane, Ward, Terry, Cotman, Wilkerson, Chavis, Woods, Seeny, Outland, Skipworth, Woods, Smothers, Smith, Barber, Ladd, Jennings, Roberts, Barracks, Hill, Stafford, Perkins Sawyer, Hall and Watkins.\n\nSnow Hill’s first settler was Gabriel Moore who arrived about 1838. Other settlers in Snow Hill were Copeland, Winburn, Small, Boon, Lawrence, Winn, Watkins, Culfer, Benson and Bragg. Tucker gives profiles of William and Michael Benson, both were born in slavery in North Carolina and arrived in Randolph County via earlier settlement in Wayne County.\n\nRandolph County had the highest ratio of African Americans in the state in the period before the Civil War. Rotman reports that by the turn of the century the settlements had “virtually disappeared.” Tucker observes the population “dropping out to Grant County, Paulding County and to Michigan.” He also mentions “promising young men” who either are, or have been teachers who have moved to Kokomo and Noblesville.\n\nDeteriorating race relations, changes in agriculture, land prices, and opportunities for employment, education and social life in more urban areas were major factors in the migration away from the communities that thrived during the 19th century.\n\nBibliography\n\nA Brief History of Greensfork and Washington twp’s [sic], Randolph County, Indiana.

Scott evolved into somewhat of a crossroad for several counties but was too distant from all county seats for practical matters. So, residents successfully petitioned the Indiana Legislature for separate status. (Corydon was the state capitol at the time.) Augmented with portions of Clark, Jackson, Jefferson, Jennings, and Washington counties, Scott was established in 1820. The census that year recorded 2,334 inhabitants. The number of black people in the county would vary little over the course of the century:\n\nU.S. Census Estimates of African American Residents in Scott County, 1820-1900\n\nCensus Year 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 No. of Inhabitants 0 15 15 15 2 5 10 1 1\n\nThese figures exclude those in bondage. Census slave schedules for this period reflect approximately 200 enslaved people in Indiana- six in Scott County. Slavery was outlawed; it was openly practiced and tolerated. Even so, there may have been some under-reporting of numbers. Owners paid a tax for each person they owned; so, some may have chosen to downplay the numbers. Since the census is based on voluntary participation, self-report and enumerator interpretation, it is vulnerable to low compliance, underestimates and inaccurate categorizations.\n\nThe above may be an “underestimate”, but whatever the actual number, Scott and many counties had similar counts. (A 1901 statewide voter audit confirms this and the dramatic drop from mid-century figures. Indianapolis Journal, October 26, 1901.) Still, the data does challenge the current consensus that African Americans were “not allowed” in Scott County but reveals nothing about the terms and conditions of their habitation. For example, is “Violet Lavinia,” who served the Swope family as a slave in Kentucky, but was “freed” in Scott Co. part of the count? What was her status as a citizen and worker from 1820 onward?\n\nNote also that the Washington County Negro Register (1853-1865), reflects Scott County as the birthplace for four of five “Jacksons” registering. (The fifth, presumably their mother, reported Bourbon Co. KY as her birthplace.) There is also evidence that in 1850, of the 15 African Americans Scott County residents, 5 were school-aged children and 4 were attending school. From Coy Robbins Reclaiming Our Black Heritage in Salem Indiana, pg.92: “Table 15: Colored Children in Adjoining Counties Attending Schools in 1850.” Were they attending local white schools or were arrangements made for access to the A.M.E. “day” schools in adjacent Washington County? The famed Rev. Hiram Revels, his brother and other African Methodist Episcopal members had formed at least two schools in Washington County by 1845.\n\nAll suggest that African Americans coalesced in some ways as community here that merit further examination. Similarly, with the possible exception of Scott Co.’s first lynching, there is virtually no mention of race in historic documents or local newspapers. Since “color related” news—both the sensational and mundane–was often picked up as filler or commentary in newspapers in other locales (Indianapolis, Louisville, Salem, etc.), future researchers could find substantiation elsewhere.\n\nBibliography\n\nBogardus, Carl R. and Langdon, Leland.

She describes a 6 ½ acre parcel “just south of the [Shelbyville] city limits” settled by five Grissom brothers and a sister known as the Grissom neighborhood or Grissom Lane (p17). Additionally she discusses two “primary areas of settlement”: Harrison Street area to the south of the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad and an area along Pike and Venter Streets and Washington Avenue west of Miller Street known as Maplewood (p 26). These two areas are probably within the town of Shelbyville and thus outside the scope of this project. Another area of settlement known as Hoganville was located across Blue River at the north edge of Shelbyville (p 26). Finally Karmire notes “a small community of people” at Norristown by 1900 which falls outside the time frame of this project (p 7).\n\nThe 19th century African American population of Shelby County was small, but like neighboring Johnson County, shows a substantial increase between 1860 and 1870.\n\nIn 1830 the census shows a total of eight free people of color residing in the county apparently in association with white families. The history of the Fox household is typical of one of the major themes of migration to Indiana. Michael Fox leaves the Quaker stronghold of Randolph County, North Carolina, with his son, Jacob, and three black children: Silas, Isaac and Dilla/Dilly Coleman/Colman. In 1820 the Fox household is enumerated in Wayne County, Indiana, and by 1821 Fox and his household have settled in “Little Marion” in Shelby County.\n\nDavid Craig describes the Davis household, another white family that included African Americans. Records would indicate that these individuals had connections to a North Carolina farm owned by the Copple family. The Copples were German immigrants who lived previously in Maryland and Virginia. They left Rowan County, North Carolina, with “a few slaves” for Clark County, Indiana, where some of the freed slaves remained with the Copples while others apparently migrated to Shelby County.\n\nThe story of the first black landowners in Shelby County presents another interesting scenario of migration. In his 1821 will, Thomas Graffort, a white slave-owner in Bourbon County, Kentucky, provides his fifteen slaves eighty acre-tracts of land that have been entered in Shelby County and Rush County, Indiana. Three men, Hazard, Hedgeman and George Graffort share in the 480 acres purchased in Addison Township. They did not, however, have long tenure as the land seems to have been sold within a few years.\n\nIn 1840 the population increases to 20 persons. In 1850 the count declines by 1 person to 19. Of those 19 people, 9 are residing in the town of Shelbyville. The others are distributed in townships as follows: Moral, 7; Hendricks, 2;, Marion, 1. In the 1860 census the count is 21 African Americans. As in the previous decade, the majority, 14 persons, live in Shelbyville, the county seat.\n\nThe Civil War years and the years leading up to the war saw conflict develop between Union and anti-Union/pro-slavery elements. Accusations were made concerning the formation of a chapter of Knights of the Golden Circle. On the other side of the coin, there is evidence of Underground Railroad activity in Shelby County. Ten black men enlisted in the 28th United States Colored Troops (USCT) from Shelby County: Thompson Burrs, Hiram and Madison Estes, Jordan McCrary, William B. McNeal, Daniel W. and John W. Morgan, Harvey Palmer, James Wadkins, and Isaiah Wells. Additional men were represented in other “colored” units. The 28th USCT was an Indiana regiment.\n\nAlthough it represented a small percentage of the total county population, the African American population increased significantly to 128 by 1870. The population was still concentrated in the town of Shelbyville and in Addison Township as a whole. In 1860 there were no African Americans counted in Addison Township out of the town of Shelbyville, but by 1870, 58 persons exclusive of the town are residing in the township. The 1870 population outside Addison Township is negligible with 10 of the 13 townships reporting no black population and two townships reporting only a single individual. A majority of the population shares Kentucky nativity with a good representation of North Carolinians, Virginians as well as some Indiana- born persons.\n\nPaula Karmire’s excellent study of Shelby County’s black history provides a detailed picture of African American life in Shelby County after 1870. Settlement patterns begin to change. She notes a “small community of people living at Norristown” by 1900 with kinship ties to a community located near Hope, Indiana, in northeast Bartholomew County (p 7). Family names include Crawley, Bird, Starks, Simms, Hobbs, Johnson, McGee, Wells, Hayes, and Gaither. Children from these families are evident in early school photographs collected at the Shelby County Library. Another small group of African Americans (Pattersons, Alderbrands and Couchmans) lived for a brief period following the Civil War in small frame houses in Washington Township a mile west of Flat Rock, south of State Road 252. The Couchmans can be traced to Marion County where Henry Couchman was a bell captain at an Indianapolis hotel.\n\nIn the decades following the Civil War, certain elements of Shelbyville demonstrated a domestic version of xenophobia. In December 1879, twenty-five immigrants from Goldsboro, North Carolina, arrived without adequate clothing or other means to survive winter in Indiana. Local reaction among white residents was largely negative and suspicions were aroused about other groups of North Carolinians making the migration north in search of opportunity.\n\nIn Shelbyville the black community began efforts to organize a school as early as 1868. School #2 at South Harrison and Howard Streets was built in 1870. In 1884 Nelson Grissom successfully sought to have his son Edmund admitted to the Shelbyville High School. Edmund Grissom graduated with the class of 1889.\n\nEfforts to organize a church began as early as 1857 and organized worship by a Baptist congregation began in February 1869. Rev. Richard Bassett headed the church in 1870. Rev Bassett had ties throughout Indiana including Parke and Howard Counties, and the towns of Rising Sun, Madison, New Albany, Indianapolis and Kokomo. Methodist organized more slowly. They obtained their own building in 1879 in the former headquarters of the Shelby County Abolitionist Society.\n\nIt seems notable that Shelbyville’s fire department was integrated. Six black men were members of the 1891 hook and ladder squad and are included in a photograph of the crew. Karmire notes, however, that blacks were barred from many aspects of white society and as a consequence developed a rich community life with separate social and benevolent organizations including Masons and Odd Fellows. She sums up: “While there was generally mutual respect…racial lines were clear” (p23). In her book the level of detail is superior.\n\nThere is an impressive collection of local history materials at the Shelby County Public Library. There is a Local History Room, including many photographs. There are a lot of possibilities for digitization projects.\n\nBibliography\n\nAtlas of Shelby County.

The majority of the black population was found in Cicero Township (1860, 23 persons; 1870, 37 persons) and in the town of Tipton (1860, 7 persons; 1870, 17 persons). Madison Township reported 7 African Americans in 1850 and 24 in 1870. Liberty Township enumerated 12 African Americans in 1860. Three of the six townships reported zero African Americans.\n\nTipton County offers an interesting situation with the census and racial designation that may have resulted in undercounting of the African Americans. In just a superficial examination of a few records on Ancestry, it appears that some families enumerated in one decade as white (or at least without the letter W indicating white) and then enumerated as mulatto or black in other decades. Racial identity may have been fluid, or it is possible that the enumerator did not perceive the individuals as non-white. In other cases the census taker may have had poor handwriting and M’s for mulatto were not differentiated from W’s for white. Handwriting may also account for significant variants in the recording of names,\n\nThe Richard Goin/Going/Goins household, Madison Township, presents an interesting case. North Carolina born Richard Goin was a farmer. Ancestry links Richard to an 1840 record from the U.S. Land Office documenting the purchase of eighty acres in Tipton County. At the time of the purchase, he was residing in Hendricks County. His Virginia born wife Lakey and eight other individuals are listed as residing in Madison Township for the 1850, 1860 and 1870 census. Most of their children were born in Indiana indicating a significant length of residency in the state. The Goines are enumerated without a racial designation in the 1850 and 1860 census leading to the assumption that they are white. Also in 1860 the African American population of Madison Township drops to zero. In the 1870 census when the black population increases to twenty-four persons, the Goines are enumerated as mulatto rather than white.\n\nIn the case of the Tyner/Tanner family, a large family living in Cicero Township, King Tanner, head of household, is reported in the 1860 census as black, born in Virginia. His wife, Sarah is reported as mulatto born in North Carolina. Records indicate that King had married Sarah (nee Lawrence) in Henry County, Indiana. They have ten other individuals in the household, all born in Indiana and classed as mulatto. In 1870 the census taker transcribes the surname to Tyner and the handwriting is such that it is very difficult to differentiate between the letters M and W designating race. In 1870, Ancestry reports, probably in error, that King Tyner is white,. Bolden Tyner, age 28, is in the household in 1870. Ancestry links him to a record for Bolden Tanner who served in the Civil War with the 55th Massachusetts Colored Infantry.\n\nOther African American family surnames in Tipton County include Perkins, Murphy, Nicholson, Linch, Jones and Mulvine. In addition to birthplaces of Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana, other settlers reported Ohio, and New York.\n\nTipton County histories scarcely mention African Americans. However they do report evidence of Southern sympathies at the time of the Civil War. These attitudes were counter balanced with pro-Union sentiment. When a rebel flag was raised from the courthouse in 1861, indignant citizens tore it down and threatened the “butter-nut element” with hanging. In 1863, with patriotism lagging, local chapters of Knights of the Golden Circle were formed. In the 1920s, Tipton County faced a new surge of nativism when the Ku Klux Klan enrolled 1622 members. This represented an astonishing 34.4 per cent of the native-born white male population making the Tipton Klan one of the strongest, most influential Klan units in the state.\n\nAllen Safianow noting the county’s small black population in the 19th century (seventy-eight persons by 1870), reports a mere four African Americans in the 1920 census, and none in the 1930 census. He continues, “The precise reasons for the decline…are unexplained, but racial prejudice was common. Blacks left because of greater economic opportunities in the cities or because of overt hostility and intimidation.” Sources acknowledge that the county’s reputation is one of being “inhospitable” to blacks including unwritten sundown laws. He concludes that “racism was something the Tipton Klan exploited rather than generated.”\n\nBibliography\n\nBlanchard, Charles. Counties of Howard and Tipton. Chicago: F.A.

As early as 1803 and typical of the time, “squatters” anticipating territorial expansion began migrating to the area. By 1810, roughly 250 people had settled. It’s unclear how many people of color were among or in addition to this number. The manner in which one, John Williams, arrived is uncertain. But along the way, he befriended Quakers. They had begun arriving in 1808. The same year, a teen named Harry Mingo entered a 60-year indentured service agreement with slaveholder Henry Twyman. Thus, Twyman complied with Indiana law, which stipulated all enslaved peoples (including the boy and others Twyman had brought with him from Kentucky) be “freed.” Mingo would periodically take Twyman to court, charging mistreatment. In 1816, fearing a return to Kentucky and enslavement, he enlisted the aid of friends and escaped to Canada. (See Centennial History of Washington County by Steve Warder.)\n\nNegro Registers and census data confirm a growing number of blacks trickling into the county between 1820 and 1850. Some were lone domestics or farm hands living with the family they served. Many chose the various African American enclaves that were built close together—often unnamed. In comparison to the white community, their overall numbers were few but grew dur-ing this period. Ultimately African Americans would reside in over half of this rural county’s 13 townships. For census data, it appears that most lived either in the city of Salem or rural com-munities in Washington, Posey or Howard Townships. County revenue and deed records suggest these three unnamed, black pioneer settlements in Washington County were largely agrarian and robust. Property ownership was common. Entrepreneurs paid taxes, helped build churches and established cemeteries. At the zenith of black residency, Rev. Hiram Revels and his brother, Wil-lis, were active in the local African Methodist Episcopal (AME) community, which built two day schools for black children. (Sons of free black parents and born in North Carolina, the Revel brothers lived in Washington County for decades before seeking their fortunes elsewhere. Hiram moved to Mississippi where he became the first African American Senator to serve in the U.S. Congress.) By any standard of the day, John Williams became wealthy—owning 160 acres of profitable farmland. Businessman Alexander White established a “whites only hotel” in Salem, purchased numerous plats in “Hay’s Addition” and the plot in Howard Township, where an AME church once stood.\n\nAs the black community had grown, so had anti-black hostility. White was considered Salem’s “last colored resident” when he was murdered in 1867. His wealth inexplicably gone, he was doing odd jobs around town. Though retaining his wealth, Williams died similarly—presumably at the hand of white assailants. [No one was convicted for either crime. William’s murderer(s) were unknown. White’s murder was witnessed as he and others were leaving church. One assailant fled the town and avoided arrest. The other was tried but not convicted. See Reclaiming African Heritage in Salem, Indiana by Coy Robbins.] Washington County enumerated 252 blacks in the 1850 census, but by 1870 the number had dwindled to 18. For the next century, the county’s population census recorded single digits for black residents.\n\nWith threats, violence and aggressive “colonization” campaigns, the 1850s ushered in tremendous pressures on Washington County’s African Americans. The successful crusade to drive African Americans away was followed by decades of erasing away any sign they had ever been there. What had made the settlement communities—its properties, institutions and cemeteries were consumed, looted or otherwise destroyed.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Washington Co. Cemetery Association erected markers recognizing sites where “Negro People” had been buried or there had been an “African American Community.” Thus, black pioneers were honored but remained blanketed in anonymity. The one exception stands on the site of what was once the Salem African Methodist Episcopal Church and cemetery: “SITE OF BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN METHODIST CHURCH John Williams established a fund for the education of Negroes which is still awarding scholarships to Negro students. He died in 1863 and is buried here.” The Washington County settlements, cemeteries and schools that Williams, White and many others helped establish and those that merit further investigation are listed below.\n\nCemeteries\n\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Cemetery (where John Williams is buried)\n\nSalem, Washington, Indiana\n\nAfrican-American Cemetery\n\nBecks Mill, Washington, Indiana\n\nBibliography\n\nBureau of the United States Census, National Archives & Records, Indiana Federal Population Census Schedules, Volume: Reel 0014 – 1820.
