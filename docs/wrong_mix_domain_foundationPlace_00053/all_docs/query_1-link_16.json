        "meta_description": "Background Few clinical studies perform detailed analyses of subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) used to treat acute ischemic stroke. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is a formidable complication of MT and is widely used in clinical trials as a safety outcome. However, variable definitions of sICH are used across clinical studies.\n\nObjective To radiographically subcategorize post-MT ICH development within this large cohort and examine overlap with sICH. Second, to examine the agreement of this definition of sICH with local site-reported occurrences of sICH to see how sICH rates change with modifications of the definitions used.\n\nMethods A large cohort of patients treated with MT for acute ischemic stroke (n=1395) was analyzed to (1) radiographically characterize hemorrhagic subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurring after MT; (2) examine associations of hemorrhagic subtypes with sICH; and (3) compare core laboratory-adjudicated occurrences of sICH with site-reported sICH.\n\nResults The overall rate of ICH was 552/1395 patients (39.6%), and the overall rate of sICH was 47/1395 (3.4%). The most common type of ICH was hemorrhagic infarction type 1 (HI1), which represented 45.3% of all ICH cases– followed by HI2 (31.5%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, 29.2%). Parenchymal hematoma 2 (PH2) represented only 3.3% of all ICH cases. Of the PH2 hemorrhages, only 33.3% were determined to be symptomatic. Of sICH cases, the most common ICH subtypes were HI2 (48.9%) and SAH (38.3%). Comparison of sICH rates as determined by core laboratory adjudication versus local site-reported results showed that only 14 patients were identified as having sICH with both definitions, with 47 patients total with sICH according to one definition, but not the other.\n\nConclusions Results of this analysis demonstrate the radiographic subtypes of ICH and also highlight the limitations of variable criteria used to define sICH, suggesting that it might be appropriate to revisit how sICH is defined post-MT.\n\nTrial registration number Clinical trial [NCT03845491][1].\n\nAll data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information.\n\n [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV&access_num=NCT03845491&atom=%2Fneurintsurg%2Fearly%2F2024%2F07%2F05%2Fjnis-2024-021725.atom",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nOur analysis examined the breakdown of hemorrhagic subtypes according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification, which demonstrated that the most common type of ICH was HI1—representing 45.3% of all ICH in our study—followed by HI2 (31.5%) and SAH (29.2%). PH2 hemorrhages are historically understood to be associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality.5–7 Consistent with previous studies, our results demonstrated that PH2 represented only 3.3% of all ICH cases—yet interestingly, only 33.3% were determined to be symptomatic. Our results also demonstrate that the most common ICH subtypes for patients with sICH were HI2 (48.9%) and SAH (38.3%). Interestingly, our regression analysis of change in NIHSS score demonstrated that PH1/PH2 hemorrhages were the only ICH subtype group that showed an average increase in NIHSS score between baseline and 24-hour scores. Patients with all other hemorrhage subtypes, and patients without ICH, on average presented with a decrease in NIHSS score over the first 24 hours. Additionally, all ICH subtypes were significantly associated with a smaller decrease in NIHSS score than patients without that subtype.\n\nClinical studies have employed different definitions of sICH since the start of reperfusion therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and our study demonstrates a meaningful difference in reported outcomes when using a core laboratory/NIHSS definition versus using a local site-reported definition. In the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) criteria for sICH, patients with any decline in neurological status and CT evidence of hemorrhage were determined to have sICH.8 Other attempts to define sICH included the ECASS II study, in which sICH was defined as blood at any site in the brain on CT, evidence of clinical deterioration according to the investigator, or signs of clinical worsening causing an NIHSS score increase of four or more points.9 In ECASS III, sICH was defined as ‘any apparently extravascular blood in the brain or within the cranium that is associated with clinical deterioration, as defined by an increase of four points or more in the score on the NIHSS, or that led to death and that was identified as the predominant cause of the neurologic deterioration’. 10\n\nOn the other hand, the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST) protocol defined sICH as a local or remote PH2 observed on a 22–36-hour post-treatment scan, in addition to either a NIHSS score increase of four points or more from baseline or from the lower NIHSS score between baseline and 24 hours, or death. With no unifying definition for sICH, trials often report different definitions for sICH, which limits the comparability of sICH rates and characterization across trials.\n\nIn the present study, 47 patients demonstrated sICH when using a core laboratory/NIHSS definition, whereas 28 patients demonstrated sICH when using local site-reported definitions. Furthermore, in comparing two different criteria for defining sICH within the ASSIST Registry, our results demonstrate a lack of agreement between the two definitions, with only 14 patients being identified as having sICH with both definitions. This left 47 patients total that were reported to have sICH according to one definition, but not the other.\n\nAs sICH is one of the most commonly reported indications of poor outcome for clinical trials studying MT, the observed variance in defining sICH presents challenges in interpreting accurate safety outcome data in studies. Additionally, the variability in imaging interpretation across sICH definitions might contribute to this lack of agreement; in particular, previous studies have demonstrated differences in site-reported and core laboratory-adjudicated readings of reports following MT.11 12 Our results suggest that differences in sICH definitions might alter the number and reporting of sICH incidence in clinical studies. Furthermore, our results suggest that using core laboratory-adjudicated image interpretation might lead to more identifications of sICH than when relying on local site reported results. Despite this, we found that the frequency of sICH is rare (3.4%) in the setting of MT when using core laboratory adjudication. Although established methods exist for using core laboratory-adjudicated image interpretation in large-scale studies that report hemorrhagic transformation, our results suggest that future research is needed to interpret sICH post-MT.\n\nAlthough a NIHSS change of four points from baseline to 24 hours has been a widely used metric to determine neurologic deterioration after acute ischemic stroke,13 this criterion has several limitations. First, patients with already very high baseline NIHSS scores with radiographic evidence of hemorrhage might not meet sICH criteria, as the NIHSS scoring system subjects patients to a ceiling effect. Our results support that exhibiting a four-point change in NIHSS is rare across all radiographically proven hemorrhage subtypes. Second, our results demonstrate that the majority of patients with a stroke might face a natural decrease in the NIHSS score from baseline to the 24-hour score. This natural decrease might mask the clinical component of sICH criteria, which uses a NIHSS score increase of four points or more. Furthermore, a NIHSS score increase of six points has also been used in prior studies, which contributes to additional variability in reported outcomes. In clinical studies where ICH is a known complication of treatment, we advocate outcomes reporting for all radiographic hemorrhages and hemorrhagic subtype, regardless of corresponding NIHSS score changes. Despite this, it is important to note that the long-term prognostic significance of asymptomatic ICH and of all hemorrhagic subtypes are areas worth investigating in future studies.\n\nIn previous studies, sICH after thrombectomy has been associated with worse functional outcomes compared with patients with no ICH.14–16 Yet few studies have assessed detailed hemorrhage subtypes after thrombectomy. In a post hoc study using data from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN)-NOIV and MR CLEAN-MED,15 data from 1017 patients were available for analysis of asymptomatic ICH, sICH, detailed hemorrhage subtypes (HI1, HI2, etc), and functional outcomes; while this study focused on functional outcomes in 1017 patients with and without ICH, our study emphasizes limitations in using NIHSS changes to define sICH and highlights the variability observed in using different sICH definitions. A recent meta-analysis17 demonstrated an aggregate 81.1% rate of asymptomatic ICH out of total ICH cases in patients post-MT across 10 studies, which is comparable to our reported rate of asymptomatic ICH (505/552, 91.5%) in patients with core laboratory-adjudicated imaging data available. Previous studies18 have demonstrated differences in sICH with different definitions; however, our study represents a deeper examination into locally defined sICH and how change in the NIHSS score is affected by hemorrhage subtype in a significantly larger cohort.\n\nWe did not specifically evaluate sICH definitions that have been used in previous studies, such as the SITS-MOST and ECASS II definitions, which might be worth examining in future studies. Additionally, while we assume that core laboratory adjudication offers a high level of standardized assessment, standard imaging in more detail, such as susceptibility weighted imaging, was not performed routinely as the nature of the study was a registry. Core laboratory adjudication might also have limitations in a real-world setting of recognizing hemorrhage after MT as it might offer a more detailed and less rushed image interpretation than in a traditional inpatient setting, and might thus lead to detection of more sICH cases than expected.\n\nAlthough our data represent a global, multi-institutional dataset, our analysis has several limitations. Our cohort yielded fewer than 50 cases of sICH out of 1395 patients, which represents a relatively low number of sICH cases analyzed, and the generalizability of our results should be interpreted in this context. Furthermore, although local physicians might have opted to serially reassess NIHSS scores numerous times per admission, only one NIHSS score was recorded for the baseline measurement and for the 24-hour measurement for the purposes of our study. The NIHSS score that was recorded for the 24-hour visit might not be the same one that indicated an increase of at least four points that the physician used to determine sICH. Similarly, the temporal relationship of the NIHSS values used in this study and the onset of hemorrhage according to the imaging results is also unknown. Additionally, patients with fatal outcomes immediately following MT might have been less likely to be registered for the study, potentially creating a bias in the study population enrolled. Future studies might benefit from larger sample sizes of sICH cases and subsequent correlation of hemorrhagic subtypes with presence of sICH. Furthermore, local institution variability in site-reported sICH criteria should be considered a limitation of this analysis. Specific criteria used to define sICH among local sites were also not analyzed within this present work. Additionally, as part of the study protocol, sites were not asked to report instances of what they determined to be ‘any ICH’ or specific ICH subtypes, and thus we were unable to analyze the detection rate of any ICH between the core laboratory and different sites. Furthermore, while we highlight the limitations of defining sICH via an increase in NIHSS score in patients who are successfully treated and are subsequently expected to show rapid NIHSS score improvement, more analyses are needed in order to better understand the complex relationship between any ICH, sICH, and changes in the NIHSS score. Given the shortcomings of the present study, we recommend reproducing and building on these analyses in future registries and trials."
