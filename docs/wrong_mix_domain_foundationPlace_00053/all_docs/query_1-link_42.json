        "text": "It is giving me a bittersweet feeling to have Richard Stallman here today. Sweet, because this time the conference is organized by a couple of political philosophers working at the Department of Political Science. And this is a recognition that software is a kind of language organizing and shaping our world, and not just a technical and business issue. It is about free culture. It is about free speech. And it is a freedom that deserves to be understood and protected, even to the point of hacking copyright like Richard Stallman did. The bitterness comes from the fact that most Italian universities are no longer the cradle of free thinking, because they are using—or they are being used by—proprietary clouds and software, to the point that when we had to switch to remote teaching during the pandemics we were recommended as teachers to use Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom. Now we are using Big Blue Button, that is free software, and as you can see it's working perfectly.\n\n--Maria Chiara Pievatolo\n\nOur guest was Richard Stallman, the man behind GNU and the Free Software Foundation. He condems the Amazon Kindle (his term for it is the “swindle”) because it takes away freedoms that readers of hardcopy books enjoy. Freedoms such as the ability to lend a book to a friend, to borrow one from a library, to buy one anonymously by paying cash, to keep a book as long as we like and to give it away. The Amazon Kindle implements DRM—digital rights management [sic]—to restrict your use of books. He is not against eBook readers per se, just the DRM, which in addition to the above also requires you to run proprietary software to read eBooks. He urged listeners to go to Defectivebydesign.org and sign up to participate in his protests.\n\n--PCRadio\n\nThis is a speech that I recorded so it could be played at a free software event in Curitiba, Brazil (the state of Parana), in November, 2003. A few points in the speech will not be clear without some background.\n\nThe event was actually a corporate trade show, but its title gave the impression of being more of an activist event. The organizers recruited a free software activist to run the speeches track, and he convinced me to attend. Between the title and the fact that my friend was the one asking me, and the fact that the state government of Parana was sponsoring the event, I assumed it was bona-fide free software activism. I agreed to go.\n\nA scandal broke in Brazil when it became known that the event had accepted Microsoft as a major sponsor. My friend tried to defend this as “spending the enemy's money”; he didn't realize that Microsoft knows what it is doing when it buys its way into such events. Then he told me, “Besides, the other major sponsor was Oracle.”\n\nMost of our community is not sufficiently politically aware to recognize that Oracle's sponsorship ought to be just as scandalous as Microsoft's. Regardless of who the owner is, nonfree software tramples your freedom.\n\nI was not sure whether to attend the conference or boycott it. Ultimately I was unable to go to Brazil because of my broken arm. I decided that any harm my participation might do was already done through the use of my name, and that it was better for me to give a speech about what had gone wrong than not to do so.\n\nIn this speech, I sought to educate rather than attack the free software activists who participated in the event, as well as the state government of Parana, which I hope will continue promoting free software in the future, but next time will get better guidance in how to do so.\n\n--Richard Stallman"
