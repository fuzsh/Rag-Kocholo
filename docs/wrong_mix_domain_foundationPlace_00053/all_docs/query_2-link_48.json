        "text": "We found that the strongest drivers of research and societal interest are utilitarian cultural features, namely whether a species is useful and/or harmful for humans in some way (Figure 3A), matching previous evidence based on restricted taxonomic samples. For example, Vardi et al., 2021 showed that in Israel, the most popular plants in terms of online representation often have some use for humans. Similarly, Ladle et al., 2019 found that bird representation online is strongly associated with long histories of human interactions, for example, in the form of hunting or pet-keeping. From a cognitive standpoint, an interpretation of this relationship may be rooted in our ancestral past, when we more often relied on wildlife products and we were more frequently subject to predation and other hazards related to wildlife. Experimental evidence suggests that, even in today’s society, images of dangerous animals are better able to arouse and maintain human attention (Yorzinski et al., 2014). Interestingly, harmfulness to humans was not a significant driver of scientific and societal interest in Tracheophyta (Figure 4). This result may partly be an artifact because plants dangerous to humans are those that are poisonous, but many poisonous plants are contemporary medicinal plants, making it difficult to draw a clear border between usefulness and dangerousness. This is also the case for many poisonous animals, but since vascular plants do not move, the value of their poison as a medicine might overrun our perception of them as a threat. More broadly, many species with deeply rooted histories of interactions with humans retain their importance in specific cultural contexts, particularly among indigenous peoples, and are thus more likely to remain salient nowadays. Disrupting these connections can have important biocultural consequences, and negatively affect both the species and the communities that value them (Ladle et al., 2023; Reyes-García et al., 2023).\n\nSpecies with a common name also attracted more scientific and popular interest, matching previous studies (e.g., Vardi et al., 2021). This result should be interpreted with caution, however, because we considered only whether a species possesses an English common name. While we recognize the limitations of this approach, English was selected due to the lack of a comprehensive list of common species names in multiple languages, and because most species that are relevant in other cultural and language settings are also likely to have been attributed English common names as part of legislative, scientific, and other societal processes. It must also be noted that this variable entails some circularity, given that humans tend to assign common names to popular species and/or those that are relevant to humans in some way. For example, a recent study showed that across nine local villages in Mozambique, species perceived as dangerous were more likely to have a local name (Farooq et al., 2021). Interestingly, this speaks about the possible existence of specific interactions among different cultural traits and cultural settings which our results do not capture and could be further explored with targeted studies.\n\nThe positive effect of body size on scientific and societal interest suggests our attention is likely best captured by organisms with sizes similar (or larger than) our own, rather than organisms that are barely visible. Furthermore, larger species are easier to study and more detectable in the field (Johnston et al., 2014; Kéry and Gregg, 2003). Previous studies documented positive relationships between human interest and body size, for example, in different vertebrate groups (Berti et al., 2020; Guedes et al., 2023; Ward et al., 1998; Żmihorski et al., 2013) and flowering plants (Adamo et al., 2021), while others observed negative relationships, for example, in passerine birds (Garrett et al., 2018) and butterflies (Żmihorski et al., 2013). This hints that there may be some within-group variability that is not captured in our broad-scale analysis. However, it is worth noting that most previous studies have focused on organisms that are within the same approximate size range as humans. Indeed, when we repeated regression analyses within subsets of data corresponding to the phylum Chordata, Arthropoda, and Tracheophyta, we found that the effect of body size was not significant in Tracheophyta (Figure 4). While our random sample of Tracheophyta encompassed an enormous range of sizes—from a duckweed to a sequoia—it may be that attractiveness in plants is primarily controlled by other aesthetic drivers (Adamo et al., 2021).\n\nDifferent variables reflecting both commonness and rarity contributed markedly in explaining scientific and, to a lesser extent, societal interest. The positive relationship between scientific and societal interest and geographic range size suggests a broader area of distribution could make a species accessible and visible to more people, including researchers, and thus more likely to be studied and searched for in Wikipedia. This result aligns with previous studies observing a positive correlation between proxies of species familiarity and online popularity (Correia et al., 2016; Żmihorski et al., 2013) or scientific interest (Adamo et al., 2021). Furthermore, taxonomically unique species often attracted more scientific and societal interest. These species may represent unique adaptations and phylogenetic distinctiveness and thus be of interest from research or conservation standpoints. Taxonomic uniqueness may also appeal and fascinate the general public, as in famous cases of the discovery of living individuals belonging to taxa previously restricted to the fossil record such as the maidenhair tree (G. biloba L.) or the coelacanth fish (Latimeria chalumnae Smith). Conservation rarity, measured as presence and status on the IUCN Red List, was also an important driver of scientific and societal interest. Concerning scientific interest, this was true regardless of the threatened status, namely both endangered and least concern species were more studied and popular across our dataset compared to unlisted species. This variable also entails a certain degree of circularity: IUCN assessments require a lot of data, making it possible to confidently assess species only when there is background information on their distribution and threats.\n\nFinally, colorfulness and phylogenetic proximity to humans correlated exclusively with societal attention. Colorfulness is an important proxy for the aesthetic value of biodiversity (Langlois et al., 2022; Santangeli et al., 2023) and has been shown to often match cultural and economic interests—for example, it was recently shown that colorful birds and fish are more frequently targeted in wildlife trade (Borges et al., 2022; Senior et al., 2022). Phylogenetic proximity to humans seemingly correlates with a range of traits including the degree of empathy and anthropomorphism toward species. This result resonates with a recent study by Miralles et al., 2019, who used an online survey to assess the empathy of 3500 raters toward 52 taxa (animals, plants, and fungi) and observed a strong negative correlation between empathy scores and the divergence time separating the different taxa from Homo sapiens (Miralles et al., 2019). It is more difficult to explain the fact that freshwater-dwelling species were significantly more searched for in Wikipedia than species inhabiting multiple habitats. Speculatively, this may reflect human preference for species inhabiting habitats that are more foreign to human experience, but may also be a sampling artifact (only 103 species in the model, less than 4% of the total, were freshwater-dwelling).\n\nThe fact that subjectivity might drive scientific and societal attention toward biodiversity is not a problem per se, but, in the long run, it may bias our general understanding of life on Earth to the point of influencing policy decisions and allocation of research and conservation funding. For example, more popular species tend to receive more funding and resources for conservation efforts (Adamo et al., 2022; Davies et al., 2018; Mammola et al., 2020) and the allocation of protected areas has not adequately considered non-vertebrate species, as up to two-thirds of threatened insect species are not currently covered by existing protected areas (Chowdhury et al., 2023). This disparity in awareness may also influence species’ long-term conservation prospects—a species is less likely to go extinct if humans choose to protect it. Bluntly put, it may be that we are concentrating our attention on species that humans generally consider to be useful, beautiful, or familiar, rather than species that deserve more research effort due to a higher extinction risk and/or due to the key role they play in ecosystem stability and functioning.\n\nExcluding subjectivity when developing any research agenda is certainly challenging. However, once we are aware that utilitarian needs and emotional and familiarity factors play a key role in the development of biodiversity research globally, we can start moving toward more balanced research agendas by carefully selecting which criteria we want to focus on. Ideally, we should aim, over time, for all parameter estimates in Figure 3A to move toward the middle (with the possible exceptions of IUCN categories). This strategy would minimize the effect of aesthetic and cultural factors in the selection of research and conservation priorities, and can be achieved over time through a more even repartition of research and conservation funds (see, e.g., Mammola et al., 2020 for a concrete agenda)."
