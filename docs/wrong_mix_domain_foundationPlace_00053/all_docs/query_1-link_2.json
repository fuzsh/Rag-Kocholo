Back in February, we made the decision to not sell, service or support products in Russia, Belarus and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, in addition to the already embargoed Crimea,\" Dell spokesman Mike Siemienas told reporters.\n\nCNews previously reported that Dell would completely leave the Russian Federation and fire all local employees. The Russian Ministry of Industry, in turn, said that many researchers and engineers working for Dell in Russia have already been offered new jobs.\n\n\"We are monitoring the development of the situation. According to our data, the vast majority of Dell ºs R&D centre specialists and support engineers in St Petersburg and Moscow have already received job offers with competitive pay from Russian producer,\" Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Vasiliy Shpak told Russian propaganda media."
