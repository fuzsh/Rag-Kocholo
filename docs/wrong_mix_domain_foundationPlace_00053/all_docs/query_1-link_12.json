        "text": "Last week was filled with super long days! But worth it to work with such an energetic bunch of young people who just entered the Sport for Development Space! Meeting the kids who first started playing ultimate last year when we did the previous workshop was heart-touching. From random shy smiles a year back to appreciating opponents for defending them well, there has been much learning and self-improvement. This wouldn't have been possible without the team working on the ground day in and out understanding the context of Kapadwanj and navigating the challenges that come with it. The first cohort of fellows have started their second year of the fellowship interning at various parts of the country to get an in-depth knowledge of what it takes to run such programs. I'm truly excited to see how these youth will do phenomenal work in the Sport for Development ecosystem in the future! Check out ELMS Sports Foundation and #ProjectChhalaang to stay turned to other updates.\n\nI recently had a realization about the power of speaking in one's mother tongue—it helps articulate thoughts that might otherwise be hard to express. Being in Delhi, there are few moments where I truly 'think' and 'speak' in Malayalam. Last week, I had the pleasure of engaging in a lovely conversation with Vandana Nair from Manorama Online. I'm extremely grateful to Vandana for engaging in an in-depth conversation about building Y-Ultimate, growing the GK MAD program, and our upcoming participation in the World Ultimate Championships. Although this feature is in Malayalam, it beautifully shares our story. What I love most is the categorization of this article under \"Love & Life.\" For many years, Y-Ultimate and GK MAD have been my love and life, and they will continue to be so for decades to come. I hope my fellow Malayalis enjoy reading this. If not, may Google Translate do a great job! Read about our work on Manorama Online here: https://lnkd.in/gqJdFe2F If you are interested in what we do, join hands to take our champions to the World Ultimate Championships 2024 to represent India - https://lnkd.in/gMQrzQbm\n\nThe emotion I went through seeing the \"Men in Blue\" on Doordarshan for select matches and counting on my dear neighbour uncle's celebration to predict the wickets lost and sixes hit are nostalgic moments that may never leave me. I used to wonder how they reached there and what it takes to play with the hope of a country resting on them. Maybe what that young boy was doing was manifesting his future 15 years later. I'm at a point where I'm wondering what it would take for not only young men but also young women to wear the Indian jersey for Ultimate Frisbee at the World Ultimate Championship. Seeing the hope this builds in the children they touch and the ripple effects it is creating is beyond my articulation now. Maybe it would take another 15 years for these children to grow up into young partners in running families and shaping the future of a new India around them. Yes, Ultimate Frisbee is not as big as cricket or football or for that matter any other sport in India. However, being able to carve your way out to make it to be the best in the country by merit is not easy. I have tried and failed myself for Ultimate Frisbee by reaching to the last stage of Indian tryouts and not making it in 2018. I haven't tried after that. However these champions have failed, picked themselves up and continued to pick up those around them too through ultimate frisbee. We are lined up against a massive uphill challenge to raise the money to take them to the World Championships without government and institutional funding! If you connect with the cause, making a support fundraising campaign is very easy and you can join me in #MakeThemFly ! As always, I'm open to every question or query you may have about this campaign or anything at Y-Ultimate.\n\nAbout 9 years back in 2015, I got introduced to the sport of ultimate frisbee at St. Stephen’s College and I never thought a piece of plastic would have such a butterfly effect in life. In a place where I was far from home and unsure about where I truly belonged, the sport gave me a space to be me. I wasn’t the most athletic of the lot, not the fastest, fittest or the smartest. However, had a lot of enthusiasm and went out of the way to somehow play. Meanwhile, a bunch of kids from Zamrudpur in Delhi too started playing and stole my heart. It motivated me to join Teach For India Hyderabad to explore the intersection of education and sports for development. These kids rallied together to become GK MAD and invited me to also play with them. (The first time an ultimate frisbee team did this for me). The kindness shown by the team and kids gave me a sense of identity to navigate my early 20s. Since 2018, life has become all about these kids and how they can thrive as adults. This led to starting Y-Ultimate, a non-profit to support these children as well as future generations. It’s been 6 years unofficially and 5 years officially (we turned 5 yesterday) of building Y-Ultimate and it’s been a roller coaster. Our first generation of kids as young adults have done a stellar job reaching out to so 200x children - over 3300 to be exact! Now we have hit a beautiful moment. 6 of my kids, friends, colleagues, and teammates are selected to represent India at the World Ultimate Championships organised by the World Flying Disc Federation at Gold Coast later this year. They were selected to represent the country by the affiliated Indian Association (India Ultimate) through rigorous rounds of tryouts across the country. With the sport being in its nascent stage, there isn't government or institutional funding yet. Being selected as the best in the country and not being able to represent the country is a problem we all can solve collectively. I would love to have all the help we can get to take them to the world championships, break out of the 'Aukaat' that the society has asked them to stay in and inspire the next generations too. You can help #MakeThemFly by 1. Sharing this fundraising request 2. Donating any amount you can 3. Creating a support-fundraiser at your end for your peers and network 4. Connecting me to any person / institution you know who can help us out! #MakeThemFly Campaign: https://lnkd.in/gMQrzQbm Neha Pradhan Arora, Sameer Arora, Itisha Nagar, AMANDEEP RANDHAWA Aparna Apte Gupta, Amrit Ahuja, Tulika Mehra, Ramabhadran Sundaram, Mainak Roy, Tushar Malhotra, Rose Gastler, Fiona Cooper, Renu Yadav (She/Her), Jinny Uppal, Rekha Rathore, Rhea Gomez, Chetna V.\n\nIf you are interested in the non-profit space, work in it, donate to a non-profit, advocate for their work or engaged in any other way, this is definitely something to read! https://lnkd.in/gJqvWMAh Thank you Deval Sanghavi and Dasra for taking steps to help non-profits in the work they do going under the tip of the iceberg, sharing about what goes unnoticed most of the time. Running Y-Ultimate, a small non-profit with a niche way of working and theory of change I struggle to even raise the program cost. Having support for mental health and well-being is a far distant dream right now. But definitely an aspiration. Many people are interested to give equipment & jersey but not ready to support quality people who are needed to make an impact with the equipment on ground as well as manage & support them effectively. However we do take whatever we can get and with the support of some friends, family and donors who have committed to donating every month, we survive month after month. What would it take for you to donate to the people and their well-being in a non-profit that you connect with?"
