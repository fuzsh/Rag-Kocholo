        "text": "Mario A. Garcia Sees Himself as Finding the Cure for Cancer\n\nMario A. Garcia graduates with a degree in biochemistry and a College of Science Honor Certificate. To earn the certificate, Mario not only had to have a high overall GPA and a high majors GPA, but he also had to show experience in research and community service.\n\nMario was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, and graduated from El Dorado High School. He stated that he did not hit his academic stride until he reached UTEP and experienced mentorship from so many professors. He chose UTEP because he wanted to stay close to his very supportive family. Not only has Mario excelled at UTEP, but he has also excelled to such a degree that he plans to bypass a master’s degree and has applied directly to doctoral programs in molecular biochemistry. He plans to study cancer and how to activate our own immune cells to attack cancer cells.\n\nMario has been involved and loved sports his entire life and that is why he chose a major in kinesiology when he arrived at UTEP. As he progressed through the major, he was involved in cardiovascular physiology research and was funded to participate in undergraduate research in cardiovascular physiology. While at UTEP he was exposed to other disciplines and after being accepted to the fast-track graduate program in kinesiology, he realized he wanted to study cardiovascular disease at the molecular level and changed his major to biochemistry. His interest in cardiovascular research was a result of his father’s struggles with cardiovascular disease.\n\nHe has been extensively involved in research while at UTEP. He has held several research assistant positions in both the Department of Kinesiology and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. He was a research assistant in the NIH Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement Fellowship where he worked under the mentorship of Dr. Alvaro Gurovich in the Clinical and Applied Physiology Laboratory, in the RISE (Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement) program where he studied cardiovascular disease, in the Metabolism, Nutrition, and Exercise Research Laboratory under the mentorship of Dr. Sudip Bajpeyi, and in the COURI (Campus Office of Undergraduate Research Initiatives) program. Because of these research assistantships, he has presented 30 abstracts at various conferences and submitted two papers for review.\n\nHe was a member of the Dean’s List Plus every semester. To make this list, your overall GPA must be at least 3.5 and your major GPA must be at least 3.5. He stated while a chemistry peer leader, Drs. James Becvar and Mahesh Narayan mentored him through leadership training and prompted him to go further in his studies. Throughout his undergraduate research, Mario has also gained great support and motivation from his hard-working parents and close friends. They made him believe he could do anything and have inspired him to continue to pursue his passion for research.\n\nJazmin G. Corral Sees Herself as the Future Director of CDC\n\nJazmin Corral graduates with a degree in biology with a biomedical concentration and a College of Science Honor Certificate. To earn the certificate, Jazmin not only had to have a high overall GPA and a high majors GPA, but she had to show experience in research and community service.\n\nJazmin was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and raised in Chihuahua, Mexico where she completed primary school and one year of high school. She then moved with her father to El Paso so she could attend Del Valle High School. When she arrived at Del Valle, she spoke no English. This did not stop her and by the time she graduated in the top ten percent of her class, she belonged to three honor societies. After that first year at Del Valle, she and her father moved back to Mexico and she commuted daily between Juarez and El Paso to graduate from Del Valle High School and UTEP.\n\nShe was awarded the Presidential Scholarship to attend Del Valle. She chose UTEP because she wanted to stay close to her very supportive family. Her mother, who has a graduate degree in education, always championed her studies. She chose biology as a major because she is very interested in cancer research.\n\nJazmin was involved with research throughout her time at UTEP and has presented her summer research projects at several conferences. While at UTEP, she received two Louis Stroke Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) awards. The first award was to study cancer research at the University of Massachusetts where she presented her research. The second award was to study cancer under the directorship of Dr. Giulio Francia at UTEP and presented her paper at UT Austin online due to the COVID pandemic. She also received the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABCRM) award and presented her research at the University of California at Anaheim and UT Austin. Her research involved studying a drug-resistant gene that inhibited cancer treatment.\n\nWhile at UTEP she volunteered in Dr. William McCabe’s lab where her group read and analyzed student papers to try to improve the teaching of science Her hobby is working out and to enhance her workouts, she became certified as a personal trainer.\n\nJazmin stated that at UTEP she was encouraged to believe that if you dream big and work hard, you can achieve your goals. It has certainly worked for Jazmin, and we fully expect to see her as the future direction of the CDC.\n\nAlandra M. Rodriguez Sees Herself as the Future MD-PhD\n\nAlandra Rodriguez graduates summa cum laude with a degree in biology with a biomedical concentration and a College of Science Honor Certificate. To earn the certificate, Jazmin not only had to have a high overall GPA and a high majors GPA, but she had to show experience in research and community service.\n\nAlandra was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, and graduated from Chapin High School in the Engineering Magnet program in the top ten percent of her class. She was raised in a multi-generational home and chose UTEP because she wanted to stay close to her very supportive grandparents.\n\nDuring her senior year in high school, she worked at the YMCA as a swim coach. She was inspired by all the individuals with disabilities struggling to learn how to swim that she realized her major was not engineering, but rather medicine. When she entered UTEP she chose biology as her major and arrived with eleven semester hours of AP courses and several scholarships. Her twin brother will graduate from UTEP in the spring.\n\nShe was awarded the Presidential Scholarship, the Petrozza and Richer Mouchantat Endowed Scholarship, and the Amy Provincial-Gamboa Endowed Scholarship. Alandra has been on the Dean’s List Plus every semester.\n\nDuring her time at UTEP, Alandra has worked in the research lab of Dr. Thomas McCabe which focused on biological educational research. Part of the research was trying to come up with ideas where students would focus on the whole picture rather than on parts of the picture.\n\nWhile at UTEP Alandra volunteered at the YMCA as a swimming instructor and in community events to raise money so that economically disadvantaged individuals could participate in all things offered at the YMCA. She also volunteered at Cedar Grove Elementary school where she worked with gifted students as well as students who needed remediation.\n\nAlandra is very interested in several areas of pediatrics and plans a gap year before medical school so that she can shadow pediatricians. She ultimately would like to complete an MD-PhD where she can work and do research at a medical school.\n\nAlandra is an extraordinary individual and we in the College of Science expect great things from her in the future\n\nTolulope was chosen to represent the College of Science at the fall commencement as the Graduate Marshal of Students because of his high academic achievements.\n\nTolulope was born, raised, and educated in Ondo State, Nigeria. After completing his undergraduate degree in physics and electronics, he worked with three companies across the financial, construction, and oil and gas sectors. While he honed his skills, he identified persistent friction within the industries where he had worked, and his knack to provide solutions led to the birth of his own company, LETAS Solutions – an analytics company providing information-driven solutions across the logistics and financial industries. The need to deliver value to these industries through LETAS Solutions led Tolu to acquire more education and he intentionally chose UTEP because of its R1 status and El Paso because of the close climatic condition to that of Nigeria. He has been accepted into the doctoral program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to study information systems. For Tolu, education is a family affair since both his parents are deeply involved in the educational sector in Nigeria.\n\nHe is completing his MS in Physics with a concentration in computational biophysics under the guidance and mentorship of Dr. Lin Li. It is important to note that Drs. Lin Li and Rajendra Zope were instrumental in his settling in which provided him the necessary push in his pursuit. For Tolu, completing research during the COVID pandemic was very challenging but with the support of Dr. Li, he was able to achieve outstanding results in time. He was a recipient of the college of science graduate research grant for the summer of 2021, he worked as a research assistant in Dr. Li’s computational biophysics lab and a teaching assistant with two of his courses. In addition, he and Dr. Li have a paper currently under review.\n\nAlong with his undergraduate and graduate degrees, he has completed five certificates: Data Science and AI, Splunk Architect, Mini-MBA, Management Development Program, and Oracle Database Administration.\n\nTolulope has been the recipient of several awards, four of which are from his career in the oil and gas sector.\n\nHe loves sports especially soccer, he has a gold medal and a silver medal from coaching two soccer teams, he also loves music, and most of all family.\n\nJulia Astromovich Chosen as Graduate Marshal of Students at the Fall 2020 Commencement\n\nJulia will represent the College of Science as the Graduate Marshal of Students at the fall 2020 commencement. She is graduating with a master’s of science in geophysics and plans to work in industry.\n\nShe was born and raised in Macomb, Michigan but moved to Michigan’s upper peninsula to the small city of Sault Ste. Marie for her undergraduate studies. She graduated from Lake Superior State University magna cum laude and outstanding senior of the physical sciences with a degree in geology and minors in mathematics, chemistry, and environmental science. Julia often claims the “UP” of Michigan as her home due to the “Yooper” connection to nature, embracing long winters, and true grit of the people who live there.\n\nJulia states that she always wanted to be scientist and at first, thought she would pursue astrophysics because of her love for astronomy and star gazing while growing up. However, a family vacation to Hawaii changed her mind. While in Hawaii a geologist was hired for a hike and took her family through Kauai’s Waimea Canyon and told them all about the geology of canyon and of the islands. It inspired her and after meeting later in the week with a group of geoscientists at Hawaii’s Volcanoes National Park, she was hooked and changed her path to geology. Julia is often quoted as saying “Professional adventurer wasn’t a college major so I chose to be a geologist”.\n\nWhile at Lake Superior State University she had the opportunity to conduct research in geophysics, specifically paleomagnetism. She spent three years on this project and did everything from the grant writing, field sample collecting, sample preparation, sample running, managing the team, and presenting the research, all with a close eye by her undergraduate mentors and the help of her team of peers. The Sierra Nevada Paleomagnetism project was her first-time conducting research and the first time she visited the mountains. There was no turning back from the geosciences after that first Sierra expedition and attempting to unravel the mountain’s mysteries. Those cathedrals of stone held millions of years of geologic history and understanding the way they interacted with one another, was enough to keep Julia hooked on the geosciences. With this research focus in geophysics she changed her career path from geology to geophysics.\n\nLake Superior State University has a ten-year informal relationship with UTEP where a handful of undergraduates from LSSU will be accepted into a graduate program in the Department of Geological Sciences with full funding. Presented with this opportunity, she accepted. While at UTEP her research focused on an inexpensive way to find oil and gas prospects. She used gravity and magnetic methods to locate salt underground. Salt often acts as a great trap for oil and gas resources in the many basins that contain it. Her thesis titled, Application of Non-Seismic Methods to Analyze and Model the Geometry of the Northern Margin of the Onion Creek Salt Diapir, Paradox Basin, Utah supported her hypothesis of redefining the salt structure present in the subsurface and the validity of non-seismic methods as a means to locate concealed salt with a high level of accuracy. She received the McBride Fellowship in the summer of 2019 which enabled her to expand her field research and remain in El Paso near the university during the summer. She is also the recipient of the SEG Student Scholarship, AAPG\n\nGraduate Student Research Grant, AAPG SWS Scholarship, the Roswell Geologic Society Scholarship, and the Four Corners Geologic Society Scholarship.\n\nJulia participated in an 8-week virtual internship at BP in the summer of 2020 where she worked with the Mad Dog Reservoir Management Team as a geophysicist. She analyzed a newly processed seismic dataset on an underexploited reservoir and presented her findings to management. After over 50 internship applications, she was thrilled to be given this opportunity and never gave up on applying, even after the rejections started coming in. Although the oil and gas industry are not in a great place right now, Julia was extremely thankful for the experience and the knowledge she gained from every team member she interacted with.\n\nWhile a graduate student Julia was a Teaching Assistant for mostly field based courses such as field camp and intro to mapping courses. She has a passion for field work in the geosciences and will find any excuse to assist her peers with this process. Julia also looks to inspire undergraduate students to pursue field-based projects and teaching them the skills needed to fulfill their class requirements, all with a smile and showing how much fun field work can be. She has received numerous awards for her posters and oral presentations based on her research.\n\nShe also reached out to the community while heading the committee for Earth Science Week 2019 where she set in motion and called to action many of the activities that inspired elementary aged school students to consider the geosciences. This outreach program is important to the Geological Sciences Department and area teachers that are seeking hands-on activities for their students. Geoscience is often not taught in the primary education level formally and these outreach activities highlight the importance through topics such as earthquakes, water resources, climate change, desertification, weather, oceans, and many more topics.\n\nLike many geoscientists she enjoys hiking and camping and has loved living in the southwest with its abundance of trails and National Parks. She also pursues oil painting in her free time based on the many photos she takes on her adventures with her current inspiration being the red rocks of Utah. Her family has always been supportive of her scientific and educational pursuits. Since she has to defend her thesis virtually because of COVID-19, her family will be able to attend virtually where they may not have been able to attend otherwise. Being at her journey’s end, Julia likes to live by the quote “Life is an adventure and it continues on” knowing that her next adventure is out there and even if there isn’t a clear path forward, life will continue on to the next great thing.\n\nZoe Yolanda Covernali Chosen as College of Science Undergraduate Marshal of Students for Fall 2020 Commencement\n\nZoe is graduating summa cum Laude with a degree in biology and plans to complete a graduate program in biology.

What is the best material for building next-generation computers? How can we increase computer efficiency by decreasing the amount of material that we use and what are the obstacles and challenges to achieving this? Will UTEP graduate and undergraduate physics students contribute to answering these questions? When Dr. Zahra Hooshmand is asked why she accepted such difficult scientific challenges, she shares her excitement about the topic. Further, her anecdotes about the enthusiasm she observes in the undergraduate- and graduate- students, who work alongside postdoctoral researchers in the theoretical physics group of Professor Mark R. Pederson at the University of Texas-El Paso, tells us that the answer to the question about a future role of UTEP students is “Yes”. Further, to lead the world to a sustainable future, students must solve these problems. For two decades, scientists in physics and chemistry and mathematics have grappled with these questions, both theoretically and experimentally, because there is a widespread realization that continued miniaturization of computer components will eventually be stopped by fundamental barriers imposed by Quantum Mechanics. The answers to the end of the so-called Moore’s-Law era of digital computing are difficult to find but a growing number of pioneers, including Dr. Hooshmand, are pursuing the development of a very interesting class of molecules known as molecular magnets. Electrons in these molecules cause the molecule to behave as if it is a spinning top or magnet and thereby puts them at the forefront for information storage applications for use in the highest-speed computers of tomorrow. Recently, theoretical and experimental experts in this field gathered at the “Molecular Magnetism in North America (MAGNA) Conference”, to exchange their findings and address challenges in Quantum Information Systems and Computing. As a member of Professor Pederson’s molecular magnetism and quantum theory group, Dr. Hooshmand described her quantum computations on a 130-atom molecular magnet. Her first-prize lecture showed that control of the information storage capacity, governed by the relative orientations of spins on two triangular units, composed of manganese ions, required much less energy than conventional computer components. These electrically-controlled magnetic molecular “qubits” are not merely dreams of quantum theorists as they have been synthesized by chemists, in Europe, very recently. When asked about other near-term applications of such molecules, Dr. Hooshmand mentions quantum sensing, the striking similarity that molecular magnets have to nature’s choice for biological energy production, and recent reports, in a Geosciences magazine, about higher-than-ordinary levels of magnetic particles in the human brain. She shares the hopes of many that future physicists will someday link quantum logic to the understanding of thought processes in the human brain and looks forward to seeing which UTEP physics students will someday contribute to such grand-challenge problems.\n\nAiyana Ponce Joins the\n\nNational Institute of Health for a Two-Year Internship\n\nAiyana Ponce is graduating with a degree in Cellular and Molecular Biochemistry and a GPA of 4.0.
