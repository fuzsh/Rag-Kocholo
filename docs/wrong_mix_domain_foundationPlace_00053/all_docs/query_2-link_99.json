        "text": "----\n\nIncantation Karaoke\n\nperformance by Eglė Budvytytė\n\nIt is a 35 min performance channelling multiple entities and ideas bruised by modernity and extractivism through a form of a song.\n\n\"I am exploring the potential of rhyme, repetition, sonic alteration of the voice and the proximity of physical presence of myself to induce the audience into the altered mind states and singing.\"\n\n----\n\nLACUNA – Land of hidden spaces\n\nfilm by Elena Mazzi\n\nLACUNA – Land of hidden spaces is part of a bigger project, called Reflecting Venice; this intends to investigate the possibility of responding to last years’ increase of environmental issues affecting Venice, in Italy. Through the application of an interdisciplinary methodology, Reflecting Venice explores technological innovation and its implications. Considering local context in conjunction with new environmental goals is beneficial in redefining their broader effectiveness and functionality. The video has the will to combine and intertwine the different ‘actors’ of the project: a prototype of solar wall made with mirrors, referring to Archimedes’ inventions, the ancient tradition of engraved glass in Murano (Venice), and the fragile environment of the Lagoon, now in peril.\n\nElena Mazzi was born in 1984 in Reggio Emilia (Italy). She received her BFA in 2007 in History of Art from Siena University, and her MFA in 2011 in Visual Art from IUAV, Venice University. She was selected for an exchange program at Royal Academy of Art (Konsthogskolan) of Stockholm. Her works have been displayed in many solo and collective exhibitions, among others: Whitechapel gallery in London, GAMeC in Bergamo, MAMbo in Bologna, AlbumArte in Rome, Sonje Art Center in Seoul, Palazzo Fortuny in Venice, 16° Rome Quadriennal, GAM Turin, 14° Istanbul Biennale, 17° BJCEM Mediterranean Biennale, EGE-European Glass Experience, Fittja Pavilion at the 14° Architecture Venice Biennale, COP17 in Durban, Italian Institute of Culture in New York, Brussels and Stockholm, Bevilacqua La Masa Foundation. She attended different residency programs and workshops such as HIAP (FI), GuilmiArtProject (IT), Via Farini (IT), Foundation Botin (SP), Bevilacqua La Masa (IT), Future Farmers A.I.R. (USA), Fondazione Spinola Banna (IT), Dolomiti contemporanee (IT), Botkyrka Konsthall AIR (SE).\n\nShe is the winner, among others, of XVII Ermanno Casoli Prize, STEP Beyond, OnBoard grant, Thalie Art Foundation grant, VISIO Young Talent Acquisition prize, Eneganart prize, Illy grant for Unidee, Pistoletto Foundation, ntcm e l’arte, m-cult media and technology program, Special mention for Arte Patrimonio e diritti umani, Antworks award, Sandretto Re Rebaudengo prize, Lerici Foundation grant and Movin’up Italian prize for young Italian artists abroad.\n\n----\n\nBlack Pond\n\nfilm by Jessica Sarah Rinland\n\n16mm film digital transfer, 35mm film stills, Archive, 42 minutes, 2018\n\nBlack Pond is an odyssey across a common land in the south of England told through the hands of the members of the Natural History Society who currently occupy it.\n\nArgentine-British artist filmmaker, Jessica Sarah Rinland has exhibited work in galleries, cinemas, film festivals and universities internationally including New York Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, Rotterdam, Oberhausen, Edinburgh International Film Festival and Bloomberg New Contemporaries. She has received grants from Arts Council England, Wellcome Trust, Elephant Trust and elsewhere. Residencies include MacDowell Colony, Kingston University, Locarno Academy and Berlinale Talents. Her most recent multi-screen, randomized installation We Account The Whale Immortal was exhibited at Somerset House, London in 2016. She is currently an Associate Artist at Somerset House Studios, a Schnitzer prize awardee at M.I.T., and a Film Studies Center Fellow at Harvard University.\n\n----\n\nThe Antisinking Workshop\n\nconceived by Carlo Gambirasio, curated by Irene Angenica and Marco Bianchessi\n\nThe Purpose of the Antisinking workshop is to find utopian solutions for the Venetian sinking problem with a different approach: people’s Intelligence. The project wants to Collect the ideas of all the individuals used to hear about this problem and currently live in the city. Both and visitors can take part to this “thinking machine” sharing solutions filled with the humbleness of the ordinary citizen who doesn't have technical skills which could undermine the out-of-the-box thinking. The workshop would last for 30m. It will starts with a 10 minutes introduction, with the contribution of two experts: Alice Staro (geologist) and Andrea Biffi (Biologist). After this introduction will be asked to the participants to draw an utopian idea to solve the sinking problem. At the end of the workshops days all the projects will be given to the Venice municipality.\n\nCarlo Gambirasio (b. 1994, Verona) holds a BFA from NABA and currently pursues his MFA at the same institution. The thought of Carlo originates from a careful analysis of the contemporary visual culture. His works often consist of imagined devices utilizing new technologies; capable of conveying a particular concept, reflecting on the logic and rules of the ‘artificial’ worlds with the aim of understanding and modifying them. Some of the exhibitions he participated in are: Sensations without Conditions (Istanbul, 2018), Share Project (Turin,2018), Roasted Spin, FuturDome (Milan, 2017); Exi Shapes, Spazio Morel (Lugano, 2017); The Great Learning, La Triennale (Milan, 2017).\n\nMarco Bianchessi (b. 1994, Monza). He began his studies at the classical high school of Monza, he decides to devote himself to art from the university, attending first the Naba in Milan where he graduated in \"Painting and Visual Arts\"; and then complete the course at the Ca Foscari in Venice in \"Economics and Management of Arts and Cultural Activities\".The presence of economic-managerial knowledge combined with a real artistic approach, allows him to have an overview of the art world. A lover of everything related to art, he divides his interests between music and visual arts.\n\nIrene Angenica (b. 1991, Catania). She deals with curating and didactic. Since 2016 she founded and directs Porto dell'Arte - appointments for the promotion of artists in apartments, a non-profit project aimed at encouraging and supporting young artists through the creation of site-specific exhibitions. Her research is based on contemporary art experimentation, preferring the artistic medium of the installation.\n\n----\n\nEmpathetic body\n\nInga Galinyte ir Anna Papathanasiou\n\nInga & Anna are hoping to have their meeting in The Swamp Pavilion and perform their ﬁrst physical depiction of Long Term Relationship project with a performance under the title ‘The empathetic body’ structured on so far collected data within the context of the swamp as a natural valuable state of creation, both in nature and art and as a manifestation of the strong connection to nature’s wisdom to have more than one ways of being and generating vitality.\n\n----\n\nAcoustic Tipi\n\nperformance by Erin Genia\n\nThe Acoustic Tipi sound amplifier is a drum interface that invites people to create audible vibrations, which will reverberate through space.\n\nThe Acoustic Tipi references Unktehi — a supernatural water serpent of Dakota legend who is responsible for flooding and peril in the water — and Wakinyan — thunder beings who bring atmospheric catastrophe, warning of impending flooding, sea-level rise, and the increased intensity of planetary storms due to climate and environmental change.\n\nThrough the sound of the drum, Acoustic Tipi provides an encounter, a moment of reflection, upon the interrelatedness of life on earth and throughout the universe. The piece allows up to four people to play at once, creating a collaboration that reduces the distance between the art and viewer, and each other. The piece is a call for unity to address the issues causing ecological decline, which, according to Dakota perspectives, is the responsibility of all people.\n\nErin Genia (Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate) is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice follows various strands, merging cultural imperatives, pure expression, and exploration of materiality, with a response to past, present, and future matters. Erin is concerned with creating a powerful presence of Indigeneity in the arts and sciences to invoke an evolution of thought and practice in societal instruments that are aligned with the cycles of the natural world and the potential of humanity. Her work has received attention from diverse audiences, and been exhibited nationally and internationally, most recently at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, and the Museum of Northwest Art. Erin was awarded the AAF/ Seebacher Prize for Fine Arts in 2018 and received her first public art commission for “Resilience: Anpa O Wicahnpi” from the City of Seattle Office of Arts and Culture. She is a 2017 First Peoples Fund fellow and graduate researcher at ACT/MIT."
