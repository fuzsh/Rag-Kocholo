        "text": "It's official! üéâ Fundraising in this environment has been NO joke, so we're really proud and excited (and relieved!) to announce the IFC - International Finance Corporation as an investor in i2i Ventures! With their involvement, we officially close our Fund I, which has already invested in 15 companies, including Abhi (YC S21), CreditBook, Metric, DealCart, Swag Kicks (Techstars '22, SOSV-Orbit ‚Äò21), Oraan, Safepay HQ Truck It In Edkasa Tazah Technologies ezBike Rider (YC WC22) & more. We are still investing from this fund, so more to come. üôÇ Misbah Naqvi & I wouldn't have gotten here without our team Ailia Naeem & Farwa Sajjad Vazir, Syed Asad Jafri, our IC member Fawzia Naqvi, our lawyers Wendy Heilbut & Chadwick Boswell, our amazing LPs we already had in our corner, and numerous advisors, founders & friends. Many thanks to the IFC team who has been our champion in pushing this through -- Anissa Kanoun, Alisher Abdrakhmanov, Sahar Etezaz, and also Mohamed Eissa, Laurien Field, Zeeshan Sheikh and more. It's an important signal in this current environment to have you in our corner, and we're excited to have you on this journey with us! (And also from me personally, shout out to the best partner/work wife Misbah, we could not have done this without one another!)\n\nLearned a lot from this gathering of Beyond The Billion¬Æ (launched as The Billion Dollar Fund for Women¬Æ) in DC last week. Two tidbits: ¬∑ American women will control US$30 trillion in household assets by 2030. ¬∑ Most women and young people inheriting wealth are expected to dump their financial managers within the first year. Those points should serve as a wake-up call for asset managers who think gender issues are a niche market or an annoying extra to-do in their work. Thank you Shelly Porges and Sarah Chen-Spellings, and our hosts Vital Voices Global Partnership and Gobi Partners. More takeaways in the link below. https://lnkd.in/eD5GsABk\n\nWhat does it mean to be *purposeful* in your investing? With the advances in technology (yes AI, we see you) and the myriad of opportunities to place our investment dollars, it can be overwhelming for families and next-generation investors to decide, what is next. Some notable quotables from our gathering with some of Europe, Asia and America's most influential families against the backdrop of beautiful Stockholm in the last week: 1. \"Don't underestimate the power of ownership (of sports teams, of investments) over generations‚Äî and what this means for the impact you can create\" ‚ÄîMary Owen, Chair of the Board and Life Trustee of the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation 2. \"As a life science investor, I see the endless opportunities AI offers when it comes to understanding human disease. I would argue that it's unethical to not explore AI in making the untreatable diseases treatable.\" ‚ÄîNina Rawal, Trill Impact 3. \"There's a lot of fear around AI, but as someone close to the work, I'm not worried. The lesson of the last decade isn't to avoid the tech platforms‚Äîit's to structure them the right way with the right people around the table, and that's a constant learning.\" ‚ÄîSandro Gianella, OpenAI 4. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not forget what‚Äôs important is also not what gets invested but who gets invested in.‚Äù ‚ÄîDorothy Chou, Google DeepMind More soon coming through right here üëâ H/t to #FamilyOfficeAlliance Philip von Wulffen Claude Finckenberg for the kind invitation and the rest of the crew for making this beautiful experience happen!
