But as AI use becomes more widespread, so do concerns about bias.\n\nBias in AI algorithms can perpetuate inequalities, affecting student outcomes and reinforcing societal prejudices. Addressing this AI bias requires a nuanced approach, including ethical guidelines, diverse datasets and rigorous testing. In this webinar, we will discuss some of the ways that education systems can safeguard against the unintended consequences of AI and promote equitable educational practices.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nTiera Tanksley, Post Doctoral Fellow in Youth, Technology and Public Policy, UCLA\n\nJeremy Roschelle, Executive Director of Learning Sciences Research at Digital Promise\n\nEleanor Drage, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence\n\nStéphan Vincent-Lancrin, Senior Analyst and Deputy Head of Division at the OECD Directorate for Education and Skills\n\nModerated by Sasha Ramirez-Hughes, Communication Manager, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nHow teachers can use AI effectively\n\n1 August 14:00-15:00 CET\n\nSupporters of AI argue it has the potential to supercharge education but do teachers know how to use it effectively? Today, few education systems provide guidelines on if and how teachers should use AI in their classrooms. This has contributed to a gap between teachers’ interest in using AI and the support and training they receive to effectively use AI tools and techniques.\n\nWith predictions of an AI revolution across the education landscape, this webinar will explore ways teachers can use AI to improve learning outcomes.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nPunya Mishra, Director of Innovative Learning Futures at the Learning Engineering Institute and Professor at the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College at Arizona State University\n\nMadhumalti Sharma, PMP, Founder & President of Workshop4Me\n\nSamo Varsik, Policy Analyst, Education for Inclusive Societies project, OECD\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nPrevious 2024 webinars\n\nBuilding Green Futures: How can students understand and progress towards green careers?\n\n17 July 11:00 CET\n\nThe OECD’s recent working paper on green guidance was the starting point for this conversation. The webinar was an opportunity for the OECD Career Guidance project to speak to leading experts and practitioners on how education systems can better equip young people for green careers, and to engage in discussions that could help shape the future of career guidance and education.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nYoung Chang, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nDr Peter Plant, Aarhus University, Denmark\n\nMarkus Gruber, Department of Environment and Energy Management, Province of Lower Austria\n\nDavid Blackmore, Sustainable Futures, WWF UK\n\nModerated by Dr Anthony Mann, Senior Policy Analyst, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nInnovations in measuring social and emotional skills and what AI will bring next\n\n5 July 14:00-15:00 CET\n\nHow can we better assess social and emotional skills in students? What role can AI play in this? In this OECD webinar we’ll explore innovative methods to enrich the quality of assessment of social and emotional skills. From behavioural tasks and digital games to virtual reality and biodata, we looked at the potential and pitfalls of each approach.\n\nWe also examined vital concerns about AI social biases, data privacy, and ethical considerations. Click on the recording below to discover innovation in assessment and the role of AI in measuring students social and emotional development.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nRose Luckin, Emeritus Professor at UCL and Founder and CEO of Educate Ventures Research\n\nClemens Lechner, Chief Product Officer at Jam Technology\n\nEllen Morgan, Principal Advisor at Templeton World Charity Foundation\n\nModerated by Adriano Linzarini and Daniel Catarino da Silva, OECD Rethinking Assessment of Social and Emotional Skills project.\n\nYou can check out the projects latest working paper here and their interactive online data table can be found here\n\nWill AI in education help students live fulfilling lives?\n\n28 June 11:00-12:00 CET\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is often celebrated as a pivotal force in transforming education, but the critical question remains: Will it genuinely support students in achieving a comprehensive sense of fulfillment in their lives? While proponents of AI in education highlight its potential to personalise learning and enhance life quality by promoting happiness, meaning, and purpose, skeptics raise concerns about its overuse potentially stunting cognitive development.\n\nThis webinar explored the fundamental issues surrounding the current objectives of education and its alignment with the concept of human flourishing in the age of AI. We discussed how educational paradigms can evolve to better support all aspects of human flourishing and critically examine whether AI can enhance or hinder this process.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nAndreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills\n\nAnita Lehikoinen, Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Education, Finland\n\nChern Wei Sng, Deputy Director-General, Ministry of Education, Singapore (Video)\n\nMelanie Stewart, Associate Deputy Minister, Ministry of Education and Child Care, British Columbia (Video)\n\nModerated by Michael Stevenson, Senior Consultant and founder of the High Performing Systems for Tomorrow initiative.\n\nLaunch of PISA 2022 Results (Volume III): Creative Minds, Creative Schools\n\n18 June from 09:45-10:30 CET\n\nFor the first time, the Programme on International Student Assessment (PISA) has measured the creative thinking skills of 15-year-old students, assessing their ability to engage productively in the generation, evaluation and improvement of ideas. As we navigate the complex environmental, social and economic changes of the 21st century, it is crucial for students to be innovative, enterprising and to use critical and creative thinking purposefully.\n\nTo watch the launch of PISA 2022 Results (Volume III): Creative Minds, Creative Schools, please click on the links below.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nMathias Cormann, OECD Secretary-General\n\nAndreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills\n\nTackling job market gaps with a skills-first approach\n\n12 June 16:00 CET\n\nIn today’s ever-changing job market, there’s a clear demand for skills that fill the employment gap in sectors, particularly those driving green and digital transformations. However, throughout OECD countries, employers are grappling with finding the right talent. Traditional methods of hiring, such as relying solely on academic qualifications or job titles, often fail to capture the true potential of candidates and perpetuate inequalities. What needs to change? A skills-first approach, which focuses on hiring based on actual skills, could be the answer.\n\nIn this webinar, the OECDs Skills-first approach project will present some of the preliminary findings and then a panel of experts will discuss further the potential of prioritising skills to promote inclusion in the workforce, especially in essential but to hard-to-fill jobs. Register now to join this important discussion.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nIván Bornacelly, Policy Analyst at the OECD Centre for Skills, OECD\n\nSharat Raghavan, Research Director, LinkedIn\n\nMariana Batista, Education and Skills advisor, WindEurope\n\nDaniel McCabe, WorldSkills Champion, UK\n\nJose Betancur, Director of NODO, Colombia\n\nPapia Debroy, Senior VP of Research and Insight, Opportunity@Work\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nAsk an expert: How can education support child empowerment?\n\n31 May 15:00 CET\n\nChild empowerment is high on education policy agendas around the world. The growing view is that children are autonomous agents of change who play important roles in shaping current and future democracies. A large body of evidence suggests that education systems can help empower children to act on topics that they feel passionate about and that affect them as outlined in our recent report, “What does child empowerment mean today?”.\n\nIn our latest Ask an Expert webinar, we discovered the student and teacher perspective on how education policy and practice can support child empowerment, and what empowerment can look like from different perspectives. We also delved into what some of the challenges and opportunities are in developing and implementing child-centered policies and practices that acknowledge the rights, experiences and opinions of children themselves in education systems worldwide.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nCaitlin Faye Maniti, 2022/23 Uachtarán (President) of the Irish Second Level Students’ Union, Ireland\n\nMaría Francisca Elgueta, History teacher and winner of the Global Teacher Prize Chile 2022, Chile\n\nShari Irfan, 2023/24 Uachtarán (President) of the Irish Second Level Students’ Union, Ireland\n\nJordan Hill & Francesca Gottschalk – Analysts in the OECD’s Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, France\n\nDigital devices in schools: Detrimental distraction or secret to success?\n\n27 May 12:00-13:00 CET\n\nToday, the digital landscape plays a crucial role in children’s lives, offering opportunities for education, socialising and entertainment. However, it also poses risks such as cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content and breaches of privacy. There are also concerns that excessive screen time can impact children’s social and emotional development, leading to debates about the quality of their interactions. Recent findings from the PISA survey further highlight a negative correlation between leisurely digital device use at school and academic performance.\n\nThis webinar brought together policymakers and experts to discuss with Andreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills, the role of digital devices in the classroom and the implication of school bans.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nAndreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nLotta Edholm, Minister for Schools, Sweden\n\nVinod Rao, Secretary (Primary & Secondary Education) State of Gujarat, India\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nInsights from PISA 2022: How prepared are teenagers in England for their future career?\n\n16 May 15:00-16:00 CET\n\nAs young people stay in education longer and have more decisions to make about education and training, it has never been more important that they have access to effective and equitable career guidance. This webinar explored how well young people in England are being prepared for their transition into work through a deep analysis of the latest data from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment. Through PISA, we know the career and educational ambitions of students aged 15, how they engage in career development activities and where they see barriers and enablers as they plan for their futures in work.\n\nDrawing on insights from longitudinal data in multiple countries, including the UK, the webinar highlighted the strengths and challenges of career development in England. With guests from the UK Department for Education and The Careers and Enterprise Company which leads guidance provision in England, the webinar asked how effective, efficient and equitable career development is in England compared to other OECD countries?\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nLucie Heseltine, Senior Manager, Careers and Enterprise Company (UK)\n\nAlex Iles, Head of Careers Strategy and Infrastructure, Department for Education (UK)\n\nJonathan Diaz, Analyst, OECD\n\nAnthony Mann, Senior Policy Analyst, OECD\n\nWhat does child empowerment mean today? Implications for education and well-being.\n\n15 May 14:00-15:00 CET\n\nChild empowerment enables children to act on issues that are important and relevant to them, it develops their confidence and leadership skills, and gives students the belief to play a greater role in school life and pursue their ambitions both now and in the future. But should students be involved in school decisions about wellbeing, curriculum and spending?\n\nThe OECD’s latest publication, ‘What Does Child Empowerment Mean Today?‘ dives into these and other issues.\n\nDuring this launch webinar, OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann and OECD Director for Education and Skills Andreas Schleicher presented insights from the report, backed by OECD data and contributions from diverse stakeholders. Watch the recording to discover how children in OECD countries are actively participating in decisions that impact their lives and learn about the urgent policy concerns facing education systems in the 21st century.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nMathias Cormann, OECD Secretary-General\n\nAndreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills\n\nNo Child Left Behind: Tackling the School Absenteeism Crisis\n\n30 April 14:00-15:00 CET\n\nCOVID pandemic-induced school closures hindered learning for young people around the world. Yet even today, many students across the OECD have failed to return to the classroom. Two-thirds of schools in the US are facing chronic absenteeism. In England, absences are 50% higher than before the pandemic, with more than one in five secondary pupils considered “persistently absent”, missing 10% or more of their hours of schooling. Even in Norway, which in the pre-pandemic era had successfully cut absenteeism by a quarter, four out of ten school principals are now very concerned about absenteeism in their school.\n\nSchool absence can have significant individual and societal consequences, spanning academic, economic social, and emotional domains. Addressing absenteeism necessitates a comprehensive approach, including identifying causes, providing support, and fostering a positive school culture that prioritises attendance and engagement.\n\nIn this webinar, we’ll talked to experts working to tackle the absenteeism crisis in communities. We looked at what we know and what knowledge gaps remain and explore effective policies and practices for a meaningful intervention to tackle the soaring number of children missing school and losing out on their education.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nMichael Gary Jr., Chief of Staff, Concentric Educational Solutions, United States\n\nBjørn Lescher Nuland, Divisional director for competence development, Directorate of Education, Norway\n\nÁine O’Keeffe, Director, Tusla Education Support Service, Ireland\n\nAndreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nModerated by Sasha Ramirez-Hughes, Communication Manager, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nThe Creative Classroom: Rethinking Teacher Education for Innovation\n\n19 April 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nUnlock the power of creativity in education! In this OECD webinar we explored how countries are equipping educators to nurture student creativity and inspire innovative teaching methods.\n\nIn celebration of World Creativity and Innovation Day on 21 April 224, we talked about the professional learning framework for teachers and leaders developed by the OECD’s creativity and critical thinking project. Our panel showcased real-world examples of teacher learning experiences that prioritise creativity and shared insights on fostering creativity within education systems worldwide. Check out this discussion on unleashing creativity in the classroom as we reimagined teacher education to place student creativity at the forefront of learning.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nMaria Wallin, Director of Institute, Berättarministeriet, Sweden\n\nBillie Freeland, Primary Teacher, Kent City Elementary, USA\n\nJennifer Mansfield, Senior Lecturer in Science Education, School of Curriculum, Teaching and Inclusive Education, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Australia\n\nCassie Hague, Analyst, Centre for Educational Research and Innovation, OECD\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nAI and cheating in education: How can we safeguard the integrity of exams?\n\n17 April 11:30-12:30 CET\n\nCheating in high school exams is an age-old problem, but new technologies have made it easier than ever resulting in huge issues for fairness and credibility. In today’s digitally connected and AI inclusive world, ensuring the integrity of exams is a major challenge. From plagiarism detection software to solutions leveraging facial recognition and eye-tracking technology, various measures are being deployed to combat cheating. But do they work? And do educators need reevaluate how to hold fair exams in a world of previously unimagined unlimited digital resources?\n\nIn this webinar, we explored questions surrounding AI and cheating by looking at the shifting dynamics of high-stakes examinations. We discussed OECD research on digitising high-stakes examinations in upper secondary education, examined strategies to make them more secure and debated how they might look in the future.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nDr. Phillip Dawson, Professor, Deakin University\n\nDr. Christina Wikstrom, Associate Professor, Umeå University\n\nShivi Chandra, Policy Analyst, Above & Beyond: Transitions in Upper Secondary Education project, OECD\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nAdvancing Gender Equality: The Crucial Role of Science and Technology\n\n4 April 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nIn recent decades, there has been a notable increase in the development of education policies that prioritise gender equality, spanning both during and post-education periods. The question of their effectiveness is subject to ongoing debate. Results from the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) confirm the persistence of gender disparities. For example, girls still outperform boys in reading and boys still have the advantage in mathematics. These examples require deeper inspection.\n\nIn this webinar, we explored the nuanced relationship between gender disparities in education and employment and how science and technology are related to a wide variety of jobs in Creative Industries, Financial and Digital Industries as well as in Green jobs.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nJoão Costa, Minister of Education, Portugal\n\nLaura Ripiani, Labor Markets and Social Security Division Chief, IADB\n\nDiana Zamora, Global Public Policy Director, Mastercard\n\nEric Charbonnier, Analyst, Innovation and Measuring Progress Division, OECD\n\nModerated by Marta Encinas-Martin, OECD Education Gender Ambassador\n\nLaunch of the PISA-VET Framework: A Global Milestone in Future-Ready Professional Skills\n\n19 March 11:00-12:00 CET\n\nVocational Education and Training (VET) plays a crucial role in ensuring that both young people and adults possess the skills required by societies and labour markets. As the global landscape of VET undergoes transformative shifts, so too does the need for a collaborate approach in professional skills measurement. The PISA-VET Framework, a joint effort between 13 countries as well as more than one hundred experts, employers, and international partners, will take centre stage as a beacon of innovation, designed not just to assess, but to guide, inform, and inspire.\n\nWatch the recording as Yoshiki Takeuchi, Deputy Secretary General at the OECD, launched the framework. Following opening remarks, we talked with leading experts to delve into the core of this innovative approach, providing a comprehensive understanding of how together we can redefine the landscape of vocational skills and education.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nYoshiki Takeuchi, Deputy Secretary General, OECD\n\nEl Iza Mohamedou, Head of OECD Centre for Skills\n\nDavid Hoey, CEO, WorldSkills International\n\nHanni Rosenbaum, Executive Director of Business at OECD\n\nMarkus Schwertel, Director for HP Global Policy & Strategy team\n\nOlga Mironenko Stampfer, Vice President, International Relations at United Health Group\n\nModerated by Duncan Crawford, Senior Content Manager, OECD Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nDiversity + Quality = Equity? A complex equation for early childhood education and care\n\n4 March 14:30-15:45 CET\n\nCheck out the recording of our Q&A webinar by clicking below and explore the intersection of diversity and quality in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) through OECD’s latest research. Discover correlations between dimensions of diversity and ECEC quality, delve into what aspects of quality matter most for diverse backgrounds, and identify policy priorities for enhanced provision.\n\nThe discussion was based on the latest OECD Education Working Papers and reports shedding light on the relationship between diversity and quality.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nAndreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nMichel Vandenbroeck, Ghent University, Belgium\n\nAlejandra Cortázar, Centro de Estudios Primera Infancia – CEPI, Chile\n\nModerated by Mihaela Ionescu, ISSA, The Netherlands\n\nThe art of balancing curricular choice in upper secondary education\n\n29 February 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nUpper secondary education helps refine the interests and expertise of students, preparing them for future study or careers. Yet in a system that fails to offer sufficient student choice in subject matter, learners may disengage, not reach their potential, or even drop out of school.\n\nIn our latest webinar focusing on upper secondary education, we delved into how countries design their curricula, balancing core subjects like literacy and numeracy with the freedom to explore other subjects of interest such as science, literature or economics.\n\nCheck out the recording to see us drawing insights from the OECD’s comparative research and hear from policy makers on their country’s experiences as well as lessons learned.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nIhor Khvorostianyi, General Director of the School Education Directorate, Ministry of Education and Science, Ukraine\n\nFritjof Karlsson, Senior Advisor in a national commission of inquiry, Sweden\n\nAdeline Croyère, Directrice des lycées et de la formation professionnelle au Ministère de l’éducation nationale et de la jeunesse, France\n\nStella Pearson, Deputy Director, Advanced British Standard, UK (England)\n\nCamilla Stronati, Junior Policy Analyst, Transitions in Upper Secondary Education project, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nModerated by Sasha Ramirez-Hughes, Communication Manager, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nLights, Camera, Fluency: How pop music, podcasts, and Tik Tok are impacting English language learning\n\n20 February 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nStep into the future of English language education. Beyond timetabled lesson hours, today’s students are immersing themselves in English from an increasingly early age through diverse and exciting new avenues, reshaping the landscape of language acquisition. But with many countries and families investing considerable amounts to ensure students leave school with sufficient language skills, what are the implications of this new English-learning reality for teachers and students?\n\nOur panel, inspired by key findings from the OECD’s research on global English learning which is co-financed by the European Commission, shared insights and discussed implications for today’s education systems.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nAndreas Schleicher, Director for Education and Skills OECD\n\nSophia Eriksson, Director for Youth, Education and Erasmus+, European Commission\n\nAnna Sole Mena, Senior Expert, European Commission\n\nSelma Koyuncu, Teacher of English, Puistopolun Comprehensive School, Helsinki, Finland\n\nHanan Khalifa, Language testing and evaluation expert\n\nStavros Kontos, English language student, 2nd Model General Lyceum of Athens, Greece\n\nModerated by Sasha Ramirez-Hughes, Communications Manager, Directorate for Education and Skills\n\nBridging the gap – How countries are using micro-credentials to reshape the workforce\n\n14 February 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nIn an era where traditional education and training pathways are being reimagined, micro-credentials – smaller, more targeted, and more flexible education programs – emerge as a solution to the increasing demands for upskilling and reskilling. Recognised as pivotal in facilitating swift skill acquisition, these programmes are gaining momentum globally. But how are countries integrating micro-credentials into their education systems?\n\nThis Q&A webinar looked at the findings of the OECD-European Commission ‘Micro-credential Implementation Project’ which explores how OECD countries, particularly Finland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Spain, are responding to the rise of micro-credentials and how integrating them is re-shaping the landscape of lifelong learning and workforce development.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nPetri Haltia, Senior Ministerial Adviser, Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland\n\nPeter Ondreička, Director of Higher Education Department, Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport, the Slovak Republic\n\nDuša Marjetič, Head of Higher Education Division, Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Slovenia\n\nPedro Martínez Martín, Senior Ministerial Adviser, Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain\n\nIsabel Ladron Arroyo, Policy Officer, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission\n\nShizuka Kato, Higher Education Policy Analyst, Directorate for Education and Skills, OECD\n\nModerated by Simon Roy, Head of Higher Education Policy, Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nMaking learning resilient in a changing climate\n\n8 February 12:00-13:00 CET\n\nClimate change is here. Besides continuing to work to reverse emissions growth, we must adapt to its impacts, including on education. This means that not only must learners acquire new skills, but the very structure of education spaces must be reimagined to ensure uninterrupted learning in the face of extreme weather, flooding, and wildfires. Action plans are needed for education during climate emergencies and to ensure equitable access, addressing disparities from varying climate exposures and access to technology.\n\nDrawing on insights from the OECD Skills Outlook 2023, this webinar fostered a dialogue about the infrastructural, curricular, and organisational measures that can empower education and training systems to adapt effectively to the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\nMustafa Yesil, National Education Expert, Ministry of National Education, Türkiye\n\nFrancesca Bastagli, Head of Research and Policy, Fondazione Agnelli\n\nJohannes Klumpers, Senior Expert DG CLIMA, Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change, European Commission\n\nAndreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills.\n\nIt was moderated by Sasha Ramirez-Hughes, Communications Manager, Directorate for Education and Skills.\n\nDecoding the hype: can AI help create accessible and inclusive student learning?\n\n6 February 13:00-14:00 CET\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is touted as having the potential to revolutionise the way students learn and teachers teach. Among the benefits, AI can help prepare students for the challenges of the digital age, develop 21st Century skills and provide personalised feedback.
