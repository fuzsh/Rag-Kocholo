        "text": "Laura Bassi\n\nBorn in Bologna in 1711, Laura Bassi was the first woman to take up a professorship in Europe and the second to earn a doctorate. Her extraordinary career as an academic spanned nearly five decades, for much of which she was a galvanizing figure for the scientific culture of eighteenth century Europe. Bassi’s admirers included the likes of Voltaire in France, who preferred Bassi’s academy to that of London’s, and Dorothea Erxleben in Germany, the first woman to earn a medical doctorate, who notably found inspiration in Bassi’s fierce struggle for equal opportunity for women. Bassi's career culminated in her succession to the chair of physics (then known as natural philosophy) at the University of Bologna in 1776—a role in which her husband, Giuseppe Veratti, was her assistant.\n\nThe Editing Press Laura Bassi Scholarship is named in her honour, in part with the intention of supporting work undertaken against the grain of the disciplinary fashions of academia.\n\nFor further reading on Laura Bassi, see:\n\nP Findlen, ‘Science as a Career in Enlightenment Italy: The Strategies of Laura Bassi’ (1993) 84 Isis 441.\n\nThe Biblioteca Comunale dell’Archiginnasio di Bologna (in collaboration with the Stanford University Libraries) has compiled a digital archive of Bassi’s family papers, available here.\n\nFor further reading on pioneering women academics, philosophers in particular, see:\n\nProject Vox\n\nTB Dykeman (ed), The Neglected Canon: Nine Women Philosophers (Springer 1999)\n\nLL McAlister (ed), Hypatia's Daughters: 1500 Years of Women Philosophers (Indiana University Press 1996)\n\nFAQ\n\nHow much funding is available in each round?\n\nWe have set aside $8,000 per round of funding (or roughly $24,000 per annum), which is divided between any combination of master’s, doctoral, or junior academic applicants at the discretion of the Scholarship Advisory Board.\n\nWho sits on the Scholarship Advisory Board?\n\nThe Advisory board comprises the members of our editorial collective in addition to academics in fields with which we are not especially familiar and whose expertise we may need to call upon in judging the applications before us.\n\nHow can I pay the voluntary application fee in a non-USD currency?\n\nYou may use our standard payment portal, the instructions for which are available here. You can then return to the application portal and select the fee waiver option. The system will automatically pair your application with your payment provided that you use the same e-mail for both. If you have a Canadian bank account, you are also welcome to send an Interac e-transfer to payments@editing.press, and then send us a note indicating that the fee has been paid.\n\nIf I am awarded the Scholarship, how long do I have to submit my manuscript for editorial work?\n\nThere is no expiry for the use of the Scholarship funds.\n\nHow many times can I apply?\n\nThere are no restrictions on how many times one can apply, nor on how many times successful candidates can apply—though, in the case of the latter, preference is given to applicants who have not been given scholarships in the past.\n\nCan I apply with more than one manuscript?\n\nWe ask that candidates restrict themselves to one manuscript per application per funding round.\n\nDo you favour certain disciplines over others?\n\nNot at all. Applicants from every discipline are encouraged to apply.\n\nMy university does not consider me as a 'candidate' in my master's / doctoral programme yet, but am I still eligible for the Scholarship?\n\nYes, and you are very much encouraged to apply.\n\nCan I submit an application in a language other than English?\n\nThe application must be submitted in English, but we are happy to consider awarding the Scholarship for non-English language manuscripts. In addition to English, we are also able to work in French, German, and Spanish.\n\nDo I need to submit a manuscript along with my application?\n\nNo, the only documents required are your CV and application form.\n\nIf I am awarded a scholarship, am I required to publish my work with Editing Press?\n\nNo, Editing Press does not publish monographs or journal articles through the Laura Bassi Scholarship.\n\nMy files exceed the 5mb limit of the application portal. What can I do?\n\nWe recommend using an online PDF size reducer and then trying to upload your files again. If that does not work, you are welcome to submit your application form without your signature (incorreclty formatted signatures are typically the cause of bloated file sizes).\n\nI am a co-author of a paper or book. Can my co-author(s) and I submit joint applications?\n\nYes, absolutely. In addition to the standard application form, we will also need copies of each author's CV.\n\nI am a part-time student. Am I still elgible?\n\nYes, and you are very much encouraged to apply.\n\nCan the funds from the Scholarship be used for other purposes, such as open access fees or, indeed, anything else?\n\nNo, unfortunately. The value of the Scholarship can only be remitted through editorial assistance provided by Editing Press.\n\nIf my application is successful but my topic subsequently changes, will I still be able to draw on the Scholarship funds for editorial assistance?\n\nYes, provided that the new topic is related to the topic reflected in your initial application.\n\nCan I submit my application by e-mail?\n\nWe are no longer able to accept applications by e-mail, so please use the application portal.\n\nI was unable to upload one or both of my application document(s), or would like to update my application document(s). Can I do this by email?\n\nWe are unable to accept application documents by email without breaching our impartiality rules. If you were unable to upload your document(s), please try the application portal again with a different browser. In the event that you paid the voluntary administrative fee with your first attempt, please select the fee waiver option in subsequent attempts.\n\nThe application portal is not accepting my documents even though they are in the right format and under 5mb. What shall I do?\n\nThis sometimes happens with certain PDFs. We recommend saving a size-reduced version even if the documents are under 5mb and then trying the portal again.\n\nI have submitted my application but have not received a confirmation of receipt. How can I ensure that my application was received?\n\nIf you have already checked your junk box and placed the Editing Press domain (editing.press) on your mail setting's whitelist, please try submitting again using an alternative email. If you have not received an automated confirmation of receipt, we cannot guarantee that your application has been received (we are unable to access the database of applicants before the closing date in order to check manually).\n\nI have more questions, how can I get in touch?"
