        "text": "OBJECTIVES: Drummond checklist is a detailed tool for evaluating the methodological rigor of health economic (HE) studies, requiring a time-consuming review process. The use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT4.0 can significantly reduce the efforts required by a human reviewer. This study aimed at evaluating the performance of ChatGPT4.0 versus a trained human reviewer in assessing the quality of HE studies using the Drummond checklist.\n\nMETHODS: A list of HE studies was randomly selected from an existing review and each study was anonymized to ensure an unbiased evaluation by ChatGPT4.0 and the human reviewer. We developed standardized prompts using an iterative process by providing explicit instructions on the Drummond checklist, which encompasses 36 questions across study design and data collection methods, measurement and evaluation of outcomes, analysis and interpretation of results. These prompts included an appraisal guidance document, a response template and the study documents to be assessed for quality appraisal. The primary outcome of the analysis was the level of agreement assessed by Kappa statistics between ChatGPT4.0 and the human reviewer.\n\nRESULTS: We piloted the prompt using 10 studies and post-standardization further expanded the assessment to another 27 studies. After standardization of the prompt, meantime in minutes to complete the checklist was significantly shorter with ChatGPT4.0 compared to the human reviewer (8 mins/study vs 25 mins/study, a 68% reduction). Our assessment indicated that the level of agreement between ChatGPT4.0 and the expert reviewer across the three domains ranged between 2.7% to 94.5%. Differences were noted in specific areas such as the generalizability of the study results which are more subjective and require human judgement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0 can expedite the quality appraisal of health economic studies, but it should be utilized only as an adjunct to human expertise rather than a standalone reviewer, particularly for domains requiring subjective evaluation.\n\nOBJECTIVES:Our objective was to extract disease severity scores for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients from electronic health record unstructured clinical notes using a transformer-based retriever-reader architecture and assess the accuracy.\n\nMETHODS:Deidentified clinical note paragraphs of IBD patients (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision: K50*, K51*) from two hospital systems (2017-2022) in the OMNY Health real-world data platform were written to a document store. To retrieve paragraphs relevant to the severity scores of interest, queries were composed inquiring about four severity scores: 9-point Mayo score, 6-point Mayo score, Endoscopic Mayo score, and short Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Relevant paragraphs were retrieved using the Best Match 25 algorithm. A Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pre-training Approach (RoBERTa)-based question-answering model was used to identify the tokens in each paragraph corresponding to the severity scores. Results were sorted and manually examined to select an optimal confidence score cutoff for each query, and 25% of the records scoring above the cutoffs were randomly sampled and manually annotated for accuracy.\n\nRESULTS:39,338 IBD patients were included; 3.36 million paragraphs were written to the document store. For severity scores listed above, score cutoffs of 0.810, 0.650, 0.490, and 0.694 were selected, respectively, yielding overall score (unique patient) counts of 428 (167), 425 (170), 317 (146), and 402 (161), respectively. Accuracy for the four scores was 100%, 100%, 96%, and 100%, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:The results show that a retriever-reader architecture extracts severity scores from clinical notes of IBD patients with >95% accuracy. Improvements in accuracy and discrimination between several scores in the same paragraph were observed in this pipeline compared to previously published pipelines. This model demonstrates that key clinical outcomes may be extracted at scale. Further development and deployment of the model would increase patient yields and isolate Endoscopic Mayo scores for various intestinal regions.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are structured diagrams describing the assumed underlying causal relationships between treatments, outcomes, and covariates. As evidence generation using real-world data (RWD) continues to expand, DAGs can help identify biasing paths, inform selection of covariates, and generate a more valid causal effect estimate. This study systematically built DAGs to elucidate causal pathways between first-line (1L) treatment (immune-oncology (IO) versus non-IO therapy) and survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\n\nMETHODS: The study design comprised three components: 1) two targeted literature searches to identify relevant variables related to treatment (IO [nivolumab, ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab] versus non-IO [standard of care chemotherapy]) and outcomes (progression-free/overall survival); 2) plausibility assessments of each proposed relationship to be captured in the DAG, and 3) a case study utilizing Carelon Research’s Healthcare Integrated Research Database (HIRD). Using US integrated claims and clinical data from 2014-2023, we differentiated measured from unmeasured variables and estimated bivariate relationships between each covariate, treatment, and overall survival via logistic regression to refine the proposed relationships.\n\nRESULTS: The two targeted literature searches identified 94 RCTs and 22 RWD studies, from which 28 variables were extracted. These potential confounders (e.g., tumor characteristics, performance status, health care access) or colliders (e.g., data collection methods) relative to the treatment-outcome relationship were built into the DAG. We identified 9,046 patients with mCRC from the HIRD, of whom 213 patients initiated IO therapy (mean age 60 years, 47% female, 80% Non-Hispanic White). Age, performance status, prior chemotherapy, and BRAF mutation status demonstrated large effect sizes and statistically significant associations with both treatment (IO versus non-IO) and overall survival.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Creating DAGs in a systematic and efficient manner, informed by existing literature and plausibility assessments, provides transparency when estimating causal effects from RWD and can reduce bias in the chosen statistical model.\n\nOBJECTIVES:The burgeoning field of healthcare data analysis is continually confronted with the dual challenges of data privacy and the need for high-quality datasets with which to perform cutting edge data analysis and research. We aim to use a synthetic data generation pipeline to bridge the gap between these challenges by producing synthetic patient data capable of performing real research.\n\nMETHODS:We utilize GuardantINFORM, which includes anonymized genomic and structured payer claims data, to generate lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patient cohorts. We process this data into a tabular format before decomposing it into an internal sequential format that is able to leverage advanced transformer-based large language models. This innovation allows for the creation of synthetic datasets that not only retain the statistical properties of the original data but also preserve the privacy of underlying data points.\n\nRESULTS:We show that there is a 0.993 R2 correlation between real and synthetic variable probabilities, demonstrating the robustness of the synthetic data in mimicking real-world data distributions. We then use a membership inference attack test, with a resulting accuracy of 49% or roughly a random guess, to underscore the effectiveness in preserving patient privacy while generating that data. Finally, we replicated a real study using the synthetic data by showing that LUAD patients with the KRAS G12C mutation were more susceptible to earlier loss of life in the face of a cancer diagnosis and that this problem compounded upon co-occurring STK11 mutations. This not only validates the practical utility of synthetic data but also highlights its potential in facilitating groundbreaking research.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:We present a promising solution for the healthcare research community. It enables the sharing of privatized, synthetic data that retains the integrity and utility required for significant scientific discoveries, paving the way for more liberalized, responsible, and effective data sharing practices in healthcare research.\n\nISSUE:While it’s clear that family members can be profoundly affected by the ill health of a child, how to capture family member spillover health effects in pediatric economic evaluation is fraught with controversy. In the case of life-extending interventions, the “Carer-QALY trap” suggests that whereas small quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains may be experienced by the patient, the extensive QALY losses experienced by family members due to prolonged caregiving may paradoxically make treatment appear less favourable than death. Inclusion of caregiving effects is also subject to bias associated with the number of caregivers available, with treatments demonstrating better outcomes in families with larger caregiving circles. The inclusion of family member spillover health effects is increasing, but a wide range of study designs, preference-based health-related quality-of-life instruments and modeling approaches are being used, revealing a lack of consensus on the optimal design, tool and modelling approach. This international panel will examine and debate different approaches to capturing family member/caregiver health effects in pediatric economic evaluation.\n\nOVERVIEW:Mick Tilford will moderate and provide context. Ramesh Lamsal will address the appropriateness of including spillover health effects and will contrast the different approaches used, such as measuring parent and child health state utilities in a single or separate models, deriving joint health states, summing QALY gains across family members, or deriving a household/family utility function. Wendy Ungar will illustrate the issue using economic evaluation of pediatric genetic testing, where testing is often directed at families (through cascade testing or trio sequencing), and present how family member health effects and resource use can be included in the reference case analysis. After the presentations, the moderator will pose questions to panelists to spark debate and each speaker will be asked to suggest ways forward. The session will end with an audience Q&A.\n\nISSUE: The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests hinges on their ability to correctly diagnose a condition and guide appropriate treatment, which is expected to improve clinical outcomes. How might diagnostic tests be valued for conditions that lack optimal treatment? Many infectious diseases provide good examples – e.g. norovirus, rhinovirus, bacterial vaginosis. There are currently no treatment options for norovirus and rhinovirus. Despite antibiotics being available for bacterial vaginosis, symptom persistence/recurrence rates are high. For these conditions where improvements in clinical outcomes may not be achieved through treatment, how is the value of diagnostic information (VODI) perceived? How does the valuation criteria differ for diagnostics intended for conditions with good treatment options? Does disease severity affect the perceived value? The aims of this issue panel are: 1) to use infectious disease examples to explore more complex relationships between treatment effectiveness and diagnostic value across multiple perspectives; 2) explore different value parameters for diagnostics and how these may be captured in cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nOVERVIEW: The moderator will present a 10-minute overview of the issue. Each panel member will then have 10 minutes to present their perspective. This will include the concept of VODI and how VODI supports broader value assessment of diagnostics beyond treatment outcomes; clinician perspective on the real-world clinical and economic benefits of molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases; and payer perspective on current priorities and considerations for diagnostic reimbursement. After the presentations, the moderator will summarise and pull out the key themes and consider wider applicability to additional disease areas before a 20-minute panel discussion with audience participation. It’s expected that researchers and manufacturers in the diagnostic tests field and payers would benefit from this discussion.\n\nPURPOSE: Since 2018, China has adopted a centralized drug review and price negotiation process to inform national coverage decision making. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is a recommended outcome measure for this process. However, all existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed in western countries. There was a need for PROMs that measure important aspects of health perceived by Chinese populations. The China Health-Related Health Outcome Measures (CHROME) were developed for this purpose. CHROME is a system of preference-based PROMs that consists of a core module for generic use and a series of disease-specific modules for measuring disease or condition-specific impact. This system has a novel design in which both generic and disease specific measurement needs are integrated throughout the conceptualization, validation, and valuation. Therefore, they can be used in clinical and economic evaluations with consistency and transitivity, while maintaining independence. The primary goal of this workshop is to introduce the development and validation of the CHROME system and its application to support drug price negotiation in China.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis workshop will start with an introduction of health technology assessment (HTA) and drug price negotiation process in China (10 minutes, by Dr. Kun Zhao). Dr. Feng Xie will provide an overview of the design, concept and structure of the CHROME system (15 minutes). Dr. Xue Li will present the development of CHROME instruments and their validations using both classic testing theory and item response theory in large representative samples (n=2,929) in China (20 minutes). The workshop will be concluded by discussion on the implications of the CHROME systems for HTA and drug price negotiation in China (10 mins by Dr. Qiang Fu), followed by a Q&A session (5 minutes). This workshop may benefit the audience who is interested in the PROMs development and validation for HTA and drug coverage decision making in China.\n\nPURPOSE: Anchored covariate-adjusted indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) inform reimbursement decisions when (1) there are no head-to-head trials between the treatments of interest, (2) there is a common comparator arm shared by two studies, and (3) there are patient-level data limitations. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is currently the most widely used method in HTA but is not always possible. We begin with an overview of newly proposed MAIC weighting schemes and approaches for assessing the numerical feasibility of conducting an MAIC. We then consider the \"two-stage MAIC\", an extension to MAIC which has been recently proposed and shown to yield improved precision and efficiency, while maintaining similarly low levels of bias when assumptions are met. We review the two-stage MAIC and how it has recently been applied to achieve greater precision. Finally, certain approaches in causal inference are known to be “doubly-robust” meaning that they will provide unbiased estimates so long as either the trial allocation model or the outcome model is correctly specified. However, doubly-robust methods for ITCs have not yet been proposed. Here we consider the potential of “augmented” MAIC for doubly-robust estimation in anchored ITCs.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Workshop attendees will review the main advantages and limitations of MAIC and be introduced to newly proposed methods. The audience will be asked (real-time polling) to consider if these “advanced” methods should be more widely considered in HTA . Ms. Cope will chair the session and introduce the main issues involved with existing MAIC methods and summarize recent work on alternative weighting schemes and feasibility assessment (20 min). Dr. Remiro-Azócar will summarize his recent work on the two-stage MAIC method (15 min) and Dr. Campbell will consider the potential of “augmented” methods for doubly-robust estimation (15 min). To conclude, an audience discussion will consider the potential and priorities for MAIC methods research (10 min).\n\nPURPOSE:Real world evidence (RWE) is only trusted by regulatory bodies, health technology assessment (HTA) organizations, payers, clinicians and patients if the underlying real-world data (RWD) is demonstrated to be high quality and fit-for-purpose. Electronic health records (EHRs) are an important source of real-world data: they are the primary record of the patient symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, outcomes, and in many cases, preferences and experiences. However, EHRs were not designed for research, and clinician engagement and interaction with EHRs varies widely from scope of practice to health care organization type. Clinician documentation in EHRs can often be limited by time pressure and administrative burden. Moreover, much information is captured in unstructured formats within the EHR, and coding systems and other factors often vary between health system EHRs. Patient records may also be split between multiple health systems and private practice EHRs. In this workshop, we will explore how all of these factors impact RWE generated from EHR data, and how these challenges can be overcome to improve trust and transparency around uses and the reliability of EHR data for research and regulatory purposes.\n\nDESCRIPTION:In this workshop, Rachele Hendricks-Sturrup will describe health system practices in generating RWE to support learning health system goals, and Duke-Margolis’ current focus on operationalizing EHR data relevance, reliability, and quality to build trust and transparency among health system stakeholders. Mac Bonafede, Elise Berliner and Louis Ehwerhemuepha will take some of those examples and describe the strengths and weaknesses of EHR data for the specific questions and how they are working to improve the validity and quality of EHR data to answer these questions. The panel will take questions on specific challenges audience members are facing using EHR data and other RWD, and brainstorm solutions with panel and audience members.\n\nOBJECTIVES: For patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), selexipag is often added several months from initiating double oral therapy (DOT) with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i). To appropriately assess the effectiveness of escalation to triple oral therapy (TOT) compared with DOT, it is critical to account for the DOT duration prior to selexipag initiation. This study compared the effectiveness of adding selexipag within 3, 6, and 12 months to DOT versus DOT alone for risk of hospitalization and PAH-related disease progression using a target trial design.\n\nMETHODS: A hypothetical, pragmatic trial protocol was developed to analyze real-world claims data from Komodo. Eligible study patients with PAH on DOT for 60 days between July 2015–June 2022 were cloned to both treatment groups and artificially censored when their observed treatment deviated from their assigned treatment strategy. Randomization was emulated using inverse probability treatment weight, and censoring-induced selection bias was accounted for using inverse probability censoring weight. A pooled logistic model was used to estimate the per-protocol effect between the treatment arms. Time to all-cause hospitalization, PAH-related hospitalization, and PAH-related disease progression were compared via adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs).\n\nRESULTS: The risk of all-cause hospitalization (aHR=0.82;95%CI:0.72–0.94), PAH-related hospitalization (aHR=0.81;95%CI:0.70–0.95), and PAH-related disease progression (aHR=0.82;95%CI:0.70–0.95) were significantly lower among patients who added selexipag within 6 months of DOT compared with DOT alone. More pronounced treatment effects were observed when patients added oral selexipag early (3-months), or when continuous treatment was defined using a shorter gap in treatment (45 versus 90-days).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Adding selexipag as early as 3 months from initiation of DOT of ERA and PDE5i significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization among patients with PAH. Delays in selexipag initiation (≥12 months) and treatment gaps may contribute to suboptimal outcomes.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Colon cancer (CC) constitutes approximately 6% of global cancer incidence. Post-curative surgery, current guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk patients, as defined by clinicopathologic factors, followed by routine surveillance and monitoring. However, some patients face ongoing risk of recurrence. We developed a novel comprehensive microsimulation model for this population within the framework of current guidelines, providing a nuanced understanding of CC management.\n\nMETHODS: A microsimulation model, replicating disease progression and guideline recommendations, was developed using a lifetime horizon with monthly cycles. The starting age of the cohort was 65 years. Treatment decisions post-curative-surgery, post-recurrence, and surveillance algorithms were incorporated into the model following the current guidelines. Disease progression parameters and performance characteristics of the recommended testing modalities were derived from the published literature. The model was validated using the National Cancer Database records following ISPOR validation guidelines.\n\nRESULTS: Our model predicted a 10-year recurrence-free survival of 71.5% for high-risk Stage II and 62.8% for Stage III patients. The 10-year overall survival rate was 73.7% for high-risk Stage II and 68% for Stage III survivors, with post-surgery average life expectancy of 17.1 years and 16.0 years, respectively. The model predicted 810 recurrences per 10,000 high-risk Stage II survivors (250 locoregional and 560 distant) and, 1,820 recurrences for Stage III survivors (570 locoregional and 1,250 distant) over 10 years. However, only 510 (63%) and 1,370 (75%) of recurrences were detected by the current surveillance modalities.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our clinically validated model enables the evaluation of long-term clinical outcomes in high-risk Stage II and Stage III CC survivors. Model predictions highlighted suboptimal recurrence detection rates under the current screening modalities. Given the newer emerging molecular residual disease tests, this model could serve as a foundational tool for evaluating both current clinical practices and the potential of these new tests to improve early detection.\n\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess clinical impact of replacing PCV13 with PCV15 in the national immunization program (NIP) for infants in Costa Rica.\n\nMETHODS: A state-transition Markov model was utilized to simulate the occurrence of cases and deaths associated with pneumococcal disease (PD) in Costa Rica population. The model incorporated three health states: no PD, post-meningitis sequelae (PMS), and death; and tracked the occurrence of acute PD events, including acute otitis media (AOM), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Health outcomes, including life-years (LYs), were reported. The initial birth cohort in 2024, consisting of 69,654 newborns, and the subsequent 100 cohorts were eligible to receive either PCV13 or PCV15 according to the 2+1 schedule, administered at 2, 4, and 12 months. Costa Rican-specific data from official sources/literature were used, with data from other Latin America countries as proxy, when necessary. A life table was included to account for all-cause mortality among the cohorts. The same vaccine-type efficacy and waning profile was assumed for both vaccines. For the two additional PCV15 serotypes (22F and 33F), the average overall PCV13 vaccine efficacy was applied, including indirect effect for the first five years following PCV15 introduction.\n\nRESULTS:Replacing PCV13 with PCV15 in the Costa Rican NIP was projected to avoid additional 740 IPD cases (53 meningitis, 158 bacteremia without focus, and 528 bacteremic pneumonia), 4,260 NBPP cases (1,865 inpatient and 2,395 outpatient NBPP), 3,297 AOM cases and 16 PMS cases over a 100-year time horizon. Additionally, PCV15 was estimated to avoid 84 IPD/NBPP deaths compared to PCV13, resulting in gains of 1,606 LYs over the 100-year time horizon.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PCV15 is projected to prevent more PD-related cases and deaths compared with PCV13. These findings highlight the additional impact of PCV15 in preventing PD mortality and morbidity in Costa Rica.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) whether payers have higher willingness to pay (WTP) for interventions that meet novel value criteria: groundbreaking durable/curative, disease severity, and health equity; and (2) for relevant interventions reviewed by ICER from 2021‒2023, how many additional treatments would be deemed cost-effective at higher WTP thresholds.\n\nMETHODS: A double-blinded web-based survey of US healthcare payers was fielded in July 2023 through Cencora’s research panel, the Managed Care Network, to assess payer WTP for interventions meeting novel value criteria. Identified ICER reports assessing pharmaceutical interventions published between Mar 2021 and Nov 2023 that included an appraisal committee (AC) meeting (N=54). Determined whether an intervention met novel value criteria based on surrogate measures: (1) groundbreaking durable/curative: use of single and short-term therapies (SST) framework (n=6); (2) disease severity: ≥50% AC voted disease had high acuity of need (n=7); and (3) health equity: ≥50% AC voted intervention would have positive impact on health inequities (n=5).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 48 payers participated in the survey. Most payers strongly agreed/agreed they would pay more per unit of health gained for groundbreaking durable/curative treatments (75%). Fewer strongly agreed/agreed they would pay more per unit of health gained for interventions that treated higher-severity diseases (40%) or reduced health inequities (33%). At a WTP threshold of $100,000, ICER found 3 “groundbreaking durable/curative” treatments cost-effective (50%), 1 “disease severity” treatment cost-effective (14%), and 1 “health equity” treatment cost-effective (20%). At WTP threshold of $200,000, the respective numbers rose to: 6 (100%), 4 (80%), and 2 (29%). At $300,000, the numbers rose to: 6 (100%), 5 (100%), and 3 (43%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Some payers are willing to pay more for interventions meeting novel value criteria. With increased WTP thresholds, more interventions meeting novel value criteria would be considered cost-effective, with potential implications for formulary decision-making and patient access.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Regulatory and payment pathway guidance are emerging related to digital health technologies (DHTs). As DHT applications are commercialized, healthcare technology assessment (HTA) agencies will play an increasingly important role in assessing their potential value. The goal of this study was to identify and review available DHT value assessment frameworks.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a targeted review using PubMed and HTA sites to identify DHT assessment frameworks from HTA authorities in North America and Europe. We prioritized DHT frameworks published in English from January 1, 2018-November 10, 2023. Frameworks limited to DHT subcategories (e.g., mobile health apps, personalized medicine solutions) were excluded. Twelve EUnetHTA HTA Core Model domains (Health problem and current use of technology; Technical technology characteristics; Safety; Clinical effectiveness; Patient and social aspects; Economics; Legality; Ethics; Organizational impact; Usability; Data security; Interoperability) informed descriptive analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Three DHT frameworks met inclusion criteria from the US (ICER), the UK (NICE), and Finland (Digi-HTA). All 3 frameworks covered 5/12 domains: ‘safety,’ ‘clinical effectiveness,’ ‘economics,’ ‘usability,’ and ‘data security.’ ‘Technological characteristics’ (ICER, Digi-HTA), ‘patient and social aspects’ (NICE, ICER), and ‘interoperability’ (NICE, Digi-HTA) were addressed by 2/3 frameworks. ‘Health problem and current use of technology’ was covered in ICER's framework. NICE addressed both ‘legal’ and ‘ethical’ guidance. No framework covered ‘organizational impact.’ NICE's framework encompassed the most domains (9/12), followed by ICER (8/12) and Digi-HTA (7/12). Related to the ‘economics’ category, budget-impact analysis was recommended by ICER and NICE, and cost-effectiveness analysis was suggested by NICE (for costly interventions) and Digi-HTA.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Few HTA agencies have published broad DHT assessment frameworks. Among existing frameworks, assessment criteria vary, and domains salient to DHT evaluation—including technological characteristics, interoperability, and ethics—are not universally considered. Establishment of clear, explicit evidence standards is needed to facilitate robust DHT value assessment."
