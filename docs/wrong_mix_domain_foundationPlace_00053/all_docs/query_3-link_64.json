And every team member who logs 10 hours or more of volunteering each quarter receives a voucher for $150 USD that they can donate to the vetted charity of their choice.\n\nWe believe so strongly in the power of our team and their philanthropic action that we have committed to two ambitious targets as part of our 2030 Plan:\n\nBy 2030, 75% of our team members will participate in giving or volunteerism in their communities\n\nBy 2030, we will use our expertise and technology to support the digital transformation of 1,000 nonprofits partners"
