        "text": "CLOCKSS was born as the trusted collaborative archive jointly owned and governed by libraries and publishers. This ensures that libraries feel secure that the content they license from publishers is guaranteed to always be accessible. Today book and journal publishers deposit their content in at least one, and ideally three, long-term archives. This is required by many libraries as a condition of doing business.\n\nIn brief, preserving your content in an archive like CLOCKSS makes it easier for publishers to license content to libraries or to publish their researcher’s works Open Access.\n\nThe world’s leading academic publishers have entrusted the long-term preservation of their published content to the CLOCKSS archive."
