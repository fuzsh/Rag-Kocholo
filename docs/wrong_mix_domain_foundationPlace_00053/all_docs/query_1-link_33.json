Sept 18, 4:45-6:00pm, Art Annex Studios. Open to all.\n\nART SMP students open their studios to show the works completed during the “10 works in 10 days Marathon”.\n\nStudents: Tara Auman, Gillian Borkoski, Davita Fennell, Emory Knott, Carol Morris, Bri White and Claire Youmans\n\nDorotha Grace Lemeh\n\nArtist House Residency: September 3 – October 15, 2019\n\nArtist Talk: Monday, September 16, 4:45-5:45pm, Glendening Annex\n\nDorotha Grace Lemeh is an artist, poet and educator who works across disciplines in her creative work to produce powerful installations. In her own words, Lemeh explains: “Visual storytelling is the means in which I use to examine rather interesting, and at times, complex narratives associated with the body—specifically that of women. In my art, I utilize various artistic methods to delve into historic, literary, and popular cultural themes, which, at times, offer a different understanding of the (usually binary) roles that are either assigned to, and/or taken on by women. Using the ideas of fragmentation and acceptance, I tend to create art that strays into the in between spaces of identity, beauty, and desire. Here in these areas I create visual pieces that play within the intersections of object- text- image, object-to-image and image-to-image subject matter. At times, I reference and use archetypal stereotypes, personal and historical narratives in my art to seek out the hidden messages that for various reasons are removed from the prying eyes of others.” —dglemeh\n\nAs a visual artist, Dorotha Lemeh has to her credit over 80 exhibitions. Internationally her works of art have been exhibited in Bulgaria, Beijing & Huairou China, England, Italy, Ireland, Mali, Tlaxacala-Mexico, and Nigeria. Nationally, she continues to participate in exhibitions in New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Minnesota, Arkansas, Tennessee, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Texas, Washington D.C., and Washington State.

Dorotha Lemeh received her MFA in painting & drawing from The Pennsylvania State University’s School of Visual Arts (SoVA) and her Bachelor of Science in Studio Art from The Tennessee State University.\n\nLemeh’s Artist House Residency and programming is co-sponsored by The Department of Art & Art History, The Lecture and Fine Arts Committee, and the African and African Diaspora Studies Program.\n\nClare Nicholls ‘10\n\nArtist House Residency: October 1-19, 2019\n\nArtist Talk: Wednesday, October 9, 4:45-5:45pm, Glendening Annex\n\n“Weaving is hand work and is digital. Digital came from digits, from counting on our fingers. Now digital means information that is delivered via computer program– an array of ones and zeros arranged in grids.\n\nGrids are the overlay to interface with everything. Cities are planned on a grid, icons snap to a grid, a grid overlays an image to edit. When Clare was a teenager, she would draw in MS Paint pixel by pixel, placing each tiny square of color with the most precision the mouse would allow. That same digital grid is how she decides how to build shapes on the warp.\n\nWeaving is also the marriage of image and object, building fabric from scratch. The revelation between empty warp and finished cloth feels mythic: at first there was nothing, and now here is something. Weaving tells stories, textiles are connected to text. The rhythm of shape and color in her tapestries is a poem. A line of color running up the side is marginalia. The knots that finish the cut ends are a signature. Clare dyes her own yarn to brew her own vocabulary; she salvages yarn from thrift stores and by unraveling sweaters to reclaim words that have been lost to her.\n\nThe weaving process has a sense of unearthing what is lost, sometimes. Language shifts, myths are retold. Artist Rowland Ricketts once said, “Sitting at the loom connects you to the origin of things.” Through weaving it is possible to re-trace those origins and find new paths beyond the present.” – Clare Nicholls\n\nClare Nicholls is an artist and educator living and working in Baltimore, Maryland. Clare is a weaver and artist who loves touching soft things and is obsessed about knowing everything. Formerly the manager of The Shed, an exhibit makerspace within the Maryland Science Center, she wrote programming and taught workshops focused on STEAM education in informal contexts. Clare also teaches weaving workshops for the public around Baltimore, MD. Her professional goal is to connect people to process.\n\nClare earned a BA in Art and Art History from St. Mary’s College of Maryland in 2010, and obtained a Post-Baccalaureate Certificate from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in 2013. She most recently showed work in RITUALISMS at the Target Gallery in Alexandria, VA in January 2019. She has also shown work at the School of Design Gallery at Stevenson University, Boyden Gallery at St. Mary’s College, and the Riggs and Leidy Galleries at MICA. Clare also lectured on how weaving structures have influenced garments throughout history at the School of Design at Stevenson University.\n\nhttp://www.clare-nicholls.com\n\nAAH New York Bus Trip\n\nSaturday, Oct 19\n\nWatch out for more details and an informational meeting early in the fall semester.

She has taught painting, drawing and 2D Foundations at The College of William & Mary, and has been awarded residencies by the Cité des Arts Internationale (Paris, France) and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts (Amherst, VA). Her work has been shown in exhibitions at the Matney Gallery, Matthews & Shank Gallery, Muscarelle Museum of Art, Longwood Center for the Visual Arts, the Washington Studio School, and the Peninsula Fine Arts Center among others. Hardy will teach ART 206. Introduction to Painting in fall 2019 at SMCM.\n\nOver her entire artistic career, Hardy has focused on the interplay of the objects, the spaces, the light, the people, that catch her eye. Her challenge is to reveal the relationships among and between them, in a way that says something visually interesting while representing these things as identifiably themselves.\n\nMiriam Schaer\n\nArtist House Residency: November 2-15, 2019\n\n“I have been creating artist books, including one-of-a kind sculptural works and limited editions, for more than 30 years, using both traditional and non-traditional materials. I also make prints, installations, multiples and multimedia projects. I frequently use clothing — everything from dresses and children’s garments to bustiers, basques, brassieres, and aprons — as materials for my books, manipulating and embellishing the fabrics to serve as enclosures, inside which I explore personal, feminist, social and spiritual themes, such as housework, family ties, non-motherhood, and religion. I especially love using objects created for other ends so that their reinvention serves broader themes. The book as a transformational object is an ancient, even romantic notion. Traditionally, books embody stories. Mine do too, while also expressing the multiple roles thrust on women by culture, the media, and themselves. That my techniques sometimes involve a layered complexity defying easy explication transforms the works into physical representations of the illusion of something under control.\n\nRecently, my work has focused on the relationship of women, motherhood, and the absence of motherhood — in particular, how women without children fare in a world that values women largely for their fertility. I became sensitized to the relationships among these conditions as my own mother began to exhibit signs of dementia. As we all age, how do we negotiate the role reversals inherent in coping with parents who live beyond the point at which they can care for themselves and become, like small children, individuals cared for by their own children, now adults? Finding no simple answers, I hope my work stimulates a dialogue about these difficult issues.” – Miriam Schaer\n\nTWO EVENTS with Miriam Schaer\n\nArtist Talk: November 6, 4:45-5:45pm, Glendening Annex\n\nBookmaking Workshop with Miriam Schaer\n\nSpinal Bling: The Transformative Magic of Link-Stitch Binding\n\nSaturday, November 9, 2019\n\n10:00am-3:00pm, Montgomery Hall Art Studios, Room 132\n\nAll materials provided – No previous experience needed\n\nFree to Arts Alliance members and SMCM students\n\nRegistration required. Limited to 20 participants. Email: srjohnson@smcm.edu\n\nGenerous funding support for the workshop has been provided by a grant from The Arts Alliance\n\nIn just one workshop session, each participant will make a beautiful book (shown above) from start to finish. No previous experience needed. Instruction by well-known New York book artist, Miriam Schaer. As part of the session, lunch will be organized as a communal ‘potluck’ or brown-bag lunch. Also on hand will be SMCM Professor of Art, Sue Johnson and Teaching Assistant, Carol Morris.\n\nLink-Stitch Binding, sometimes referred to as French-Stitch, is a wonderful, elegant sewing structure that creates a lacey matrix of vines across the spine of any codex to which it is applied. Workshop students will learn to use the stitch on its own and also with ribbons as a sewing support to create exposed-spine bindings that are both beautiful and functional. Students will also learn to make cover boards for their books. By the end of the workshop, students will finish at least one book using this approach.\n\nMiriam Schaer is an artist and educator based in Brooklyn, New York. She exhibits extensively in the U.S. and abroad and is represented in numerous collections, including Yale University Museum, Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History & Culture at Duke University, the Tate Gallery in London, and The Bainbridge Museum outside of Seattle, WA. Her work has earned a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, inclusion in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for the Feminist Art Base at the Brooklyn Museum, and artist residencies in Spain, Estonia, India and Egypt. Her work about societal bias against childless women, Baby (Not) On Board: The Last Prejudice?, has been exhibited by the International Museum of Women. A U.S. Fulbright Scholar, Schaer spent part of 2017 in the Republic of Georgia, where she established the Artist Book Collection at Telavi State University. This spring she has work included in Freed Formats: the book reconsidered, in various locations throughout Connecticut and Hand & I, about embroidery and social practice Dorsky Gallery in Long Island City, NY, curated by Yulia Tikanova. From 2009-2017, she was a Senior Lecturer at Columbia College Chicago in the Interdisciplinary MFA in Book, Paper, Print and Media, and has been a visiting artist at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, NY, Academy of Arts, Tallinn, Estonia, and Faculty of Fine Art, University of Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro. Schaer’s essay The Motherhood Imperative: Fertility, Feminism, Art, is included in “Maternal in Creative Work: Intergenerational Discussions on Motherhood and Art,” edited by Elena Marchevska and Valerie Walkerdine, will be published by Routledge in Fall 2019. She is represented by the Central Booking Art Space in New York, and by Vamp and Tramp Booksellers, in Birmingham, Alabama. She is currently serves on the board of The Center for Book Arts in New York.\n\nMargot Douaihy\n\nArtist House Residency: December 3 -13, 2019\n\nCreative writer Margot Douaihy leverages language as a tool of immersion and inquiry. As a process-based artist working in diverse genres—poetry, lyrical fiction, crime fiction, flash noir, true-crime verse—Douaihy allows the creative identity of a project to locate the final form. A queer writer, Douaihy filters ideas through a phenomenological lens, mining the patterns and occlusions that shape awareness in a text. She inhabits and subverts tropes, such as hardboiled and noir, to shake the heteronormative, perceptual constructs that limit storytelling modes. In her poetry, fiction, and hybrid forms, Douaihy foregrounds voice and a bold re-imagining of place. Raw, visceral, lush, obsessed—carefully crafted with line-level immediacy—Douaihy’s dialogue-driven, narrative experiences often mask complex, subterranean simmering. Her poetics evoke the broken opulence and gritty beauty of the Rust Belt Poetry School. Earning a PhD in Creative Writing at Lancaster University, with a focus on the craft of queer crime fiction, Douaihy views constraints as generative, invitations to innovate beyond pastiche and deepen reader engagement. Refusing to flatten work to conform to genre expectations, Douaihy layers sonnets to read like detective stories and infuses mystery novels with the musicality and unexpected depth of triolets. From her poetry collections published by Clemson University Press to her hardboiled-inspired sleuth series set in New Orleans, an aching ethos unites Douaihy’s oeuvre. Taking structural and temporal risks while honoring genre hallmarks is intended to spark synthesis, enrich the literary discourse, and push the boundaries of form.\n\nMargot Douaihy (b. Scranton, PA) earned a BA in Writing from the University of Pittsburgh Writing Program, an MA in Creative & Life Writing from Goldsmiths, University of London, and a Ph.D. in Creative Writing from Lancaster University. Douaihy is the author of Scranton Lace (Clemson University Press), the Lambda Literary Finalist Girls Like You (Clemson University Press) and I Would Ruby If I Could (Factory Hollow Press). Her book, Bandit/Queen: The Runaway Story of Belle Starr, is under contract with Clemson University Press. Created in collaboration with her partner, Bri Hermanson, an illustrator, Bandit/Queen is a true-crime poetry project exploring Belle Starr, a notorious wild west outlaw. In Douaihy’s sleuth fiction series—currently on submission—she inhabits and reconstructs hardboiled PI tropes through a queer lens. A Board Member of Philadelphia Stories and Founding Member of the Creative Writing Studies Organization, Douaihy’s work has been featured in PBS NewsHour, Colorado Review, Madison Review, Tahoma Literary Review, North American Review (forthcoming), South Carolina Review, Adirondack Review, Wisconsin Review, The Sow’s Ear Poetry Review, The Tishman Review, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Storyscape Literary Journal, The New Guard Literary Review, The Mark Literary Review, Bloodstone Review, Tupelo Press 30/30, The Common by Amherst College, Soundings East by Salem State University, Big Bridge, Mic, Nottingham Writer’s Studio, Sight Into Sound, Ducts, Nth Position, Catamaran Literary Reader, The Moth Magazine, The Four Quarters Magazine, Belle Reve Literary Journal, and The Pittsburgh Poetry Houses. An award-winning editor and mentor, Douaihy holds the post of editor-at-large with Future Publishing where she explores the intersection of art, technology, storytelling, and pedagogy. A frequent speaker, presenter, and workshop leader, she has held teaching positions at Marywood University. Currently, Douaihy is a Lecturer at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, NH, where she also serves as the Editor of the Northern New England Review literary journal.\n\nDouaihy’s residency is sponsored by the Artist House Residency Programs. During her residency she will work on a true-crime project, Bandit/Queen: The Runaway Story of Belle Starr (under contract to Clemson University Press) on which she collaborates with her partner and illustrator, Bri Hermanson. Douaihy will also make a class visit to ART 347 Book Arts course."
