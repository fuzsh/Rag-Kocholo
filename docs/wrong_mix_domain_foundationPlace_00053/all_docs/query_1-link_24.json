        "text": "+++ 2023 WINNERS ANNOUNCED +++\n\nAs one of the most widely used human-made products on the planet, concrete is all around us: in our houses and offices; our roads and pavements; in the bridges that connect us; the wind farms that provide us with energy; and the sea barriers that protect us. As the sustainable building material of choice, it provides safe, durable and resilient structures as well as providing the basis for renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nConcrete in Life is our annual photography competition, open to all photographers (or anyone with a camera phone) around the world. It tasks you to take photos of concrete in your life for a chance to win up to $10,000.\n\nOver 21,000 people entered our 2023 competition, and after the judging rounds and people’s vote, we are delighted to reveal our winners. The winners were announced at a special exhibition at the Brunswick Gallery in London, UK, which commemorated 5 year’s of Concrete in Life competition.\n\nOur exhibition is now open until 13 April so if you are in London, do go check it out at the Brunswick Art Gallery.\n\nCongratulations to our winners and to everyone that was shortlisted. You can see their pictures and the shortlist below."
