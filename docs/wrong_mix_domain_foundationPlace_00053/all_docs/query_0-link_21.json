The theme for 2024 is Playing with Math, celebrating mathematical games, puzzles and other entertaining activities, as well as \"playing\" with mathematics itself - exploring, experimenting, and discovering!\n\nBook cover: Springer, Cham, 2022\n\nNew book on the history of the IMU!\n\nThe book \"Framing Global Mathematics: The International Mathematical Union between Theorems and Politics” by Norbert Schappacher on the history of the IMU has now been published (Springer, Cham, 2022). The IMU solicited the writing of the book to mark the occasion of the centennial of the founding of the IMU in 1920. It is available in open access and can be freely downloaded here.\n\nPhoto: shutterstock\n\nCarlos E. Kenig: The International Mathematical Union (IMU) at 100\n\nIMU President Carlos E.
