        "text": "\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" is the third single and second track off of The Red Album.\n\nAppearances\n\nWeezer (The Red Album)\n\nNot Alone: Rivers Cuomo & Friends Live at Fingerprints (Live)\n\nVarious official \"bootlegs\"\n\nAlone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years (2020)\n\nOverview\n\nWriting process\n\nIn 2004, Rivers Cuomo began taking private music composition lessons from Bruce Reich at UCLA.[1] Some of the vocal harmonies written for \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" were originally composed for a focal counterpoint excercise from these lessons. Cuomo excitedly contacted Reich after the release of The Red Album, but was dismayed to learn that Reich had recently passed away.[1][2][3]\n\nIn describing his initial inspiration for the song, Cuomo has said, \"I just had this really strong and kind of sudden conviction that I am sick of writing verse-chorus-verse songs. I've been doing it for so many years, that's what everyone else does; I wanna do something completely different.\"[3] Cuomo decided to instead write a song using the musical structure of theme and variations, as used in classical music, using different bands and musician styles (Slipknot, Jeff Buckley, Aerosmith, etc.) as the different variations. Cuomo intially also attempted to utilize different lyrical perspectives for each variation, but found the results too disjointed, and resolved to maintain the same persona throughout. Early alternate song titles in consideration included \"Mack Daddy,\" \"The Player,\" \"Player 4 Life,\" and \"The Ballad of Oswaldo Sánchez\" (named for the Mexican soccer goalie). Cuomo was inspired by Sánchez after seeing him play the World Cup in 2006 despite Sánchez having just lost his father to a heart attack.[3]\n\nCuomo had difficulty writing the spoken word section of \"The Greatest Man\", and so contacted Rick Rubin to get examples of spoken word sections in pop songs. Rubin suggested Elvis Presley's rendition of \"Are You Loneseome Tonight?,\" which Cuomo studied.[3] The lyrics for the spoken word section from \"The Greatest Man\" is derived from similar lyrics in Presley's song (which itself was partially derived from the play As You Like It by William Shakespeare).\n\nAt the time of the release of The Red Album, Cuomo called the song his favorite song on the album, and one of his favorite songs he's ever written.[4] Bassist Scott Shriner, in an interview, called the song \"a masterpiece that includes ten different styles of music based around a common theme. It's awesome.\"[5]\n\nThe song's title includes the parenthetical \"Variations on a Shaker Hymn,\" referring to the 1848 Shaker song \"Simple Gifts,\" generally attributed to Joseph Brackett. As explained in the liner notes for the deluxe edition of The Red Album:\n\nRecording\n\n\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" was recorded in the \"War Room\", a space backstage at the Malibu Performing Arts Center in Malibu, California. The band taped butcher paper to the mirrors to write down ideas and plans for recording songs. According to Brian Bell, the band used about 20 feet of butcher paper just for \"The Greatest Man\" and spent about as much time discussing how to record the song as they did actually recording it.[6] According to Cuomo, the band rehearsed the song for about a month before embarking on the Troublemaker Tour, and about half of the rehearsal process was dedicated to learning \"The Greatest Man.\"[4]\n\nSections\n\nDifferent sections of the song were inspired by specific artists, in the theme and variation style of classical music:\n\nRap (0:35)\n\nSlipknot (1:00)\n\nJeff Buckley (1:26)\n\nChorale (1:51)\n\nAerosmith (2:17)\n\nNirvana (2:43)\n\nThe Andrews Sisters (3:08)\n\nGreen Day (3:33)\n\nSpoken word (4:06)\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (4:37)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (4:54)\n\nWeezer (5:11)\n\nRelease\n\n\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" was the first song from The Red Album to be released on iTunes, releasing as a digital single on May 13, 2008.\n\nThe song was released as a downloadable track for the rhythm video game Rock Band on June 24, 2008, along with the songs \"Troublemaker\" and \"Dreamin'.\"\n\nThe song was performed live as the finale of the Spike Video Game Awards, which aired on December 14, 2008. The performance featured a marching band drummer, a women's choir, and musician Dave Kushner (formerly of Velvet Revolver) on rhythm guitar. Rivers Cuomo wore a white suit with no shoes.\n\nReception\n\nThis section requires expansion.\n\nKnown recordings\n\nPerformer(s) Title Filename Date of recording Recording location Length Appeared on Notes Rivers Cuomo The Greatest Man That Ever Lived The Greatest Man that ever Lived.mp3 June 21, 2007 6:04 Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years Weezer The Greatest Man That Ever Lived April-October 2007 Malibu Performing Arts Center, Malibu, CA 5:52 Weezer (The Red Album) Rivers Cuomo The Greatest Man That Ever Lived November 25, 2008 Fingerprints, Long Beach CA 8:02 Not Alone: Rivers Cuomo & Friends Live at Fingerprints\n\nMusic video\n\nIn late 2008, it was reported that a music video for \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" was planned with director Spike Jonze[7] (who previously directed music videos for \"Undone - The Sweater Song,\" \"Buddy Holly,\" and \"Island in the Sun\"). Ultimately, an official video never materialized. The song was used in the Warren Miller documentary Children of Winter, from which a segment was released as a music video on Weezer's official YouTube channel in late 2008:[8]\n\nA low-budget video, featuring the band lip-syncing the song with a boom-box, was filmed when the band was selected as MTV's Artist of the Week:\n\nPersonnel\n\nRivers Cuomo – lead guitar, lead vocals, keyboard\n\nPatrick Wilson – percussion, vocals\n\nBrian Bell – rhythm guitar, lead and backup vocals\n\nScott Shriner - bass guitar, lead and backup vocals\n\nRick Rubin - producer\n\nRich Costey - mixing\n\nLyrics\n\nLyric sheet\n\nLyric sheet page 2\n\nYou try to play cool like you just don't care\n\nBut soon I'll be playin' in your underwear\n\nI'm like a mage with the magic spell\n\nYou come like a dog when I ring your bell\n\nI got the money and I got the fame\n\nYou got the hots to ride on my plane\n\nYou're givin' me all that I desire\n\nCuz down with me I'm takin' you higher\n\nI'm the baddest of the bad\n\nI'm the best that you've ever had\n\nI'm the tops, I'm the thing\n\nAll the girls get up when I sing, yeah\n\nI'm the meanest in the place\n\nStep up, I'll mess with your face\n\nI don't care where you are\n\nLook up and follow the star\n\nOhh, I'm gonna tear down the wall\n\nI may not be here when you call\n\nSo best be givin' me your all, ooo\n\nAfter the havoc that I'm gonna wreak\n\nNo more words will critics have to speak\n\nI've got the answers to the tangled knot\n\nSleep tight in your cot\n\nOhh baby, I've been told that I'm goin' crazy\n\nOhh baby, but I can't be held down\n\nOhh baby, somehow I'm keepin' it steady\n\nOhh baby, I'm tearin' up this town\n\nHey, this is what I like\n\nCut my heart with a martyr's spike\n\nHey, this is nothing new\n\nI've got more than enough for you\n\nI can take on anybody, I can do my thing\n\nI don't wanna hurt nobody but a bee has got to sting\n\nI'm 'a fix it if you mix it up\n\nTalk smack then I'm a'gonna shut you up\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI was born to give\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived, oh\n\nRadioactive\n\nSomebody said all the world's a stage\n\nAnd each of us is a player\n\nThat's what I've been trying to tell you\n\nIn Act I, I was struggling to survive\n\nNobody wanted my action dead or alive\n\nAct II, I hit the big time\n\nAnd bodies be all up on my behind\n\nAnd I can't help myself\n\nCuz I was born to shine\n\nAnd if you don't like it, you can shove it\n\nBut you don't like it, you love it\n\nSo I'll be up here in a rage\n\nTill they bring the curtain down on this stage\n\nI'm the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI'm the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI was born to give and give and give\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nRadioac-dioac-dioac-dioactive\n\nI am the greatest man that ever lived\n\nI was born to give\n\nSee also\n\nList of Weezer songs\n\nList of Rivers Cuomo songs"
