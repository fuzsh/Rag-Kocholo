        "text": "Weezer\n\nAlbum by Weezer\n\nReleased 3 June 2008\n\nPower Pop\n\nRating – 5\n\nFor today’s special review, we’ll be taking a look at a record released during Weezer’s 2000s to early 2010s run, or ‘the Great Depression’ as its otherwise known. The band’s third self-titled album, known as the ‘Red Album’ for its red background, was released in 2008, following 2005’s ‘Make Believe’, surely a step up?\n\nI think I used to lie about liking ‘The Red Album’, probably because I used my enjoyment of lead single ‘Pork and Beans’ to decide it was the most likeable release during Weezer’s rough patch. In truth, it’s almost as lousy as ‘Make Believe’, or at least the second half of the album kind of is. But it isn’t all hunky dory on the first half either, as we kick the album off with ‘Troublemaker’, one of the tritiest helpings of trite Weezer have obnoxiously thrown our way. It has this generic, slightly shuffly, radio rock sound, full of arbitrary, half-autobiographic, but even more half-assed lyrics, like the chorus – “I’m a troublemaker, never been a faker, doing things my own way and never giving up”. It might be the lousiest single the band has put out this side of ‘Beverly Hills’. I like the personal, ‘happy loser’ intent of Weezer’s first album, so sometimes it hurts when they pull something out of their asses that just sounds commercial, with nothing else going for it. Too much vague lyricism, and so we’ll leave ‘Troublemaker’ behind, because what happens in vagueness stays in vagueness.\n\nDespite the music video of ‘Pork and Beans’ showcasing a lot of viral/meme YouTube sensations, it’s the previous track, ‘The Great Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)’, that feels like a YouTube video in itself. We’ve been riddled in recent times with multiple videos of people doing impressions, including videos like ‘(song title) done in (however many) different styles’. I’m not sure if Weezer really kickstarted that kind of thing with this song, but the method behind the near-six-minute madness is just that, it’s Weezer using a few basic melodies and chord progressions and demonstrating them via multiple impersonations of artists and styles.\n\nThe payoff is pretty good actually, not too shabby considering this wasn’t an experiment anybody really asked for. I guess, as it’s a song made up of smaller songs, it’s hard to be totally positive, as there are a few dud impressions in there, including the dumbfounded Aerosmith section, and the whitest of white raps that kicks the song off. Still, the ambition is there, especially in the choral section and the Bach and Beethoven parts, which sound more like a ‘Pet Sounds’ era Beach Boys impression than anything. My favourite part is the ‘Green Day’ verse, as it just sounds like classic Weezer, and I feel like I could dig an entire song made up of that great, steady but powerful guitar strumming, with the song’s main melody rumbling over it. My least favourite section might actually be the ending part, which funnily enough, is just Weezer being Weezer, so I guess 2008 Weezer really isn’t that good, which is weird because I think this album generally is still Weezer being themselves, as in their ‘90s selves, to a point anyway, more so than ‘Make Believe’, I guess they want to be Weezer at the very least, though they can’t quite manage it at times.\n\n‘Pork and Beans’ is a great single, the hip kind of dorky Weezer tried to be too often around this portion of their career, with a cool guy doofus vocal deliver from Rivers, and references to Timberland. But if there’s a band who I like hearing pull out the old faithful I-V-vi-IV chord progression, it’s Weezer, pretty much because it reminds me of a couple of tunes from their first album, and it really suits the chorus to ‘Pork and Beans’, with pummelling distortion, and its “I’ma do the things that I wanna do, I ain’t got a thing to prove to you”. I guess the song takes a bit of a jab at people like me, underwhelmed by the band’s 2000s output as it’s a lot emptier than what they did in the ‘90s, reminding us that sometimes – “everyone likes to dance to a happy song, with a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along”.\n\nOne of Weezer’s great unsung heroes is ‘Heart Songs’, a gentle ode to music, with some heavier sections that really bring out the emotion in Rivers’ words. It essentially is just Rivers Cuomo recounting his influences, from Slayer to Joan Baez to Cat Stevens to the Fresh Prince, and finally Nirvana. Unfortunately, he doesn’t mention KISS, after all, they’re his favourite rock band, he has posters of them on the wall, he has Ace Frehley, he has Peter Criss, waiting there for him. It isn’t the most poetic of songs, in fact, the chorus of “these are my heart songs, they never felt wrong” seems a little hollow, but I like the fact that it’s clearly about SOMETHING. I’m not saying every song here has to be totally meaningful, but I love how heartfelt Rivers is here when singing about something that seems to mean a lot to him, so, ‘Heart Songs’ gets a few points for that. There are also a few background violin stabs in the song, something not heard too often on Weezer albums.\n\nThe post-‘Heart Songs’ portion of the ‘Red Album’ is like the album equivalent of post-‘Pinkerton’ Weezer. It falls off the rails, with even more meaningless songs that have no longevity value. To get the good out of the way, closing track ‘The Angel and the One’ is actually quite lovely, a slow burner with a gorgeous main melody, making for some lullaby-esque balladry before it builds up. It’s no ‘Only in Dreams’, but anything that comes at all close gets a thumbs up from me. But my god, the songs that come before it are head-scratchers.\n\n‘Everybody Get Dangerous’ is a snoozer of a pop rock song. Calculatedly heavy to the point where it becomes no surprise that Rick Rubin produced this album. It details Rivers’ younger days, tipping cows with his best friend, before bumbling into a cripplingly cringeworthy chorus of “everybody get dangerous, everybody get dangerous, ooh yeah”. ‘Dreamin’’ follows, and while it isn’t as bad a song generally, it’s a lot more hollow, with I-iii-IV-V verses, and bland lyrics about dreaming, cancelling out the optimistically thick guitars, before settling into this mediocre…overly nature-driven, ‘60s hippy-esque slower section, remarking how nice the trees look and how the birds are singing (not this song) and all that contrived ‘peace and love’ drivel. I like Donovan, but Donovan this ain’t.\n\nThen comes the portion of the ‘Red Album’, that I guess you could call unique, but that doesn’t make it any less harrowing. It’s the trilogy of songs not written or sung (at least lead vocals) by Rivers Cuomo, featuring Brian Bell’s horribly-sung, but well-structured ‘Thought I Knew’, Scott Shriner’s pseudo-bleak ‘Cold Dark World’, which does feature a writing credit from Rivers actually, and Pat Wilson’s forgettable ‘Automatic’. I guess the band just didn’t have enough ideas on the record, so Rivers commanded the other three guys to do their own thing and come back to him. You know how Queen had four great songwriters that all produced memorable #1 singles? Yeah, this ain’t them.\n\nA few dark horse tracks keep the ‘Red Album’ from being Weezer’s blandest work. It’s still pretty bland, but in regards to the opening paragraph’s question of whether or not this was a step up from ‘Make Believe’, the answer is yes, if that means anything…\n\nFavourite songs – ‘Pork and Beans’ – ‘Heart Songs’.\n\nHonourable mention – ‘The Greatest Man That Ever Lived’.\n\nWeakest songs – ‘Troublemaker’ – ‘Everybody Get Dangerous’ – ‘Cold Dark World’.\n\nDishonourable mention – ‘Automatic’.\n\nRating – 5 out of 10\n\n(Note – I strongly dislike how Rivers Cuomo looks on the album artwork)"
