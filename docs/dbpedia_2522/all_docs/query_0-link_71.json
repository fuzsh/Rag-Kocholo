        "text": "JOURNEY\n\n“Revelation” (Nomota)\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the mid-’80s, Journey’s hits were lavish pop bulletins conjuring amber waves of strip malls. Its melodies resolved quickly over four-four grooves, and the band didn’t indulge much in suite form or rarefied instrumental interludes. Neal Schon was its front-and-center guitar player, bending notes into parabolas as big and sexy as rainbows. Steve Perry was its great theatrical tenor, hitting high notes with a likably strained, through-the-noise voice and Sam Cooke-type embellishments. Once it refined its formula, Journey was pure suburban-teen romantic inspiration. By contrast, Boston sounded more street and more mystical; Styx and Kansas were Trig 1 and 2.\n\nMr. Perry hasn’t worked with Journey since a reunion album in 1995, and after he left, the band, led by Mr. Schon, hired two other touring lead singers. Recently, Mr. Schon secured the services of another singer, Arnel Pineda, a 40-year-old from the Philippines whom he found on YouTube and who sounds a great deal like Mr. Perry. “Revelation,” produced by Kevin Shirley, is the resuscitated band’s covering-all-bases album, with 11 new songs, 11 old songs and a live DVD. (Like the Eagles’ most recent record, it is available exclusively at Wal-Mart and the band’s own Web site, journeymusic.com.)\n\nDespite the recent surge in iTunes downloads of the old hit “Don’t Stop Believing” after it closed last year’s final episode of “The Sopranos,” this is a band with roughly the same audience it left behind about 25 years ago, a comfort machine with no subcultural clout. “Revelation” seems like a record to justify a tour, and there’s one this summer, with Heart and Cheap Trick as supporting acts.\n\nAnd though the album doesn’t transcend this purpose, it is, actually, good. Mr. Pineda, who sings hard and with the appropriate vulnerability, gives it some distinction. Beyond that, the band seems to have taken rock vitamins: it feels alive.\n\nWith the exception of “Wildest Dream”  slightly modern-rock, slightly Foo-Fightery  “Revelation” operates with its own kind of Schillinger System, an almost clinical set of chord modulations, solo-lengths and emotional progressions. You find yourself reeled in exactly where the band wants you to be, to the degree that it wants you to be. Those lyrics! Within the first minute and a half, you’re given a huge melody and a full story line: a pair of young lovers have run away, hit hard times and decided with finality that they won’t give up on love. Journey, in a nutshell.\n\nWith this band, faith counts, and being an average person counts; hence the new song “Faith in the Heartland,” about young lovers somewhere in the breadbasket who won’t give up their dreams in a fading town, and hence, on slightly less epic ground, a track written by Mr. Schon and the keyboardist Jonathan Cain, “Change for the Better,” about recovering from alcoholism. (Though take away the phrase “clean and sober” and the song could be about emerging from any bad stretch, psychological, spiritual or physical.)\n\nAs for the second disc of re-recorded hits  including “Only the Young,” “Open Arms” and “Don’t Stop Believing”  it sounds pretty much like old Journey, down to the vocal details, with more acrobatic and whammy-bar-enhanced guitar solos. If you’re a fan, take the compliment: the members of Journey will not let go of you. They believe in you. BEN RATLIFF\n\nWEEZER\n\n“Weezer” (Geffen)\n\nOn “Make Believe” (2005), Rivers Cuomo, the singer of Weezer, was glum and despondent. “What’s the deal with my brain?” he sang. “Why am I so obviously insane?” But on “Weezer,” the band’s sixth album, he trades self-pity for bravado, contemplating middle-age with an album full of adolescent kiss-offs.\n\nThe single “Pork and Beans” mixes demographic-warping references (Timbaland, Oakley shades, Rogaine) with a defiant chorus: “I’m a do the things that I want to do/I ain’t got a thing to prove to you.” Mr. Cuomo, now a 37-year-old dad, examines the tenuousness of celebrity and cool, drolly considering advice to hit the gym and “fit my underwear.”\n\nThe video for the song addresses instant-but-fleeting Internet notoriety, featuring YouTube upstarts like Tay Zonday (“Chocolate Rain”), Chris Crocker (“Leave Britney Alone”) and the wig-topped auteur behind “OMG Shoes.” (Unsurprisingly, “Pork and Beans” has already been viewed more than four million times on YouTube.) Mr. Cuomo  much like those unlikely stars  demands fame on his own terms: “I eat my candy with the pork and beans,” he declares, later adding, “I don’t give a hoot about what you think.”\n\nWith its layered vocals and mugging guitars, the song owes a debt to “Buddy Holly,” a hit from Weezer’s 1994 debut album. Over all, this new CD relies on familiar formulas: twitchy, singalong choruses, lyrical and musical in-jokes (in “Troublemaker,” brash guitar squiggles come after Mr. Cuomo sings, “How’s this for arts and crafts?”) and affable vocal harmonies. But it also feels disjointed and indulgent, packed with stylistic U-turns. “The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)” is the kind of “Bohemian Rhapsody”-style epic that high school drummers compose during chemistry lab. It opens with a piano melody borrowed from “Simple Gifts” and then devolves into a multipart marathon, flitting from semi-rapping to falsetto-driven lament to a throbbing choral breakdown. (Yes, it’s a parody.)\n\nThere are a few other clunkers, like the schmaltzy ballad “Heart Songs,” a homage to Mr. Cuomo’s favorite songwriters. But the gauzy, wistful “Dreamin’ ” is likely to please long-time fans: its genial chorus, ripe with teenage unease (“Daddy says I gotta pay some bills/So I can learn to be responsible”) could power a thousand Senior Skip days. AMANDA PETRUSICH\n\nJEWEL\n\n“Perfectly Clear” (The Valory Music Co./Big Machine)\n\nThat “Perfectly Clear,” Jewel’s strong seventh album, is her “country” record is of course ludicrous; she’s been country for years. She describes her father as a “poetic cowboy.” Her longtime boyfriend is the rodeo champion Ty Murray. She was a host of “Nashville Star,” country music’s “American Idol.” And it is just a short, mournful-fiddle-assisted hop from the coffeehouse folk with which she made her name to Nashville’s more contemplative wing.\n\nAnd so the ways in which “Perfectly Clear” is more country than her 1995 debut album “Pieces of You” are small, more a function of gestures and nods than of wholesale conversion. Jewel wrote or helped write every song here save one, and the producer John Rich (of Big & Rich) has done little to hammer down her well-worn eccentricities: wordiness; imperfect rhymes; a sharp, assured voice that collapses for effect.\n\nThe title track shows just far Jewel, 34, hasn’t come. “The doorway frames you,” she sings, “a picture perfect silhouette/blue sky of regret/enough to hang you.” It could have been on her debut album. (To be fair, it was written when she was 18.) “Two Become One” also appeared, in different form, on her 2003 album “0304.” (The dance-floor flirtation on that album was Jewel’s true genre experiment.)\n\nStill, her brand of country is gentle; making her a genre star will require adrenalizing it. And while the most blatant attempts at shoring up Jewel’s credibility should be the least successful, the opposite is true. On “Loved by You (Cowboy Waltz),” she yodels, compellingly (it’s a skill she often displays live). “Anyone but You” boldly revisits country’s early-’70s pop moment, in the manner of Lee Ann Womack’s recent “There’s More Where That Came From”; Jewel is lovely on it, her voice breathy and bittersweet. And “Till It Feels Like Cheating” recalls the blues-inflected sound of Julie Roberts. (One of the song’s writers, Lisa Carver, wrote Ms. Roberts’s excellent post-breakup dissection, “Wake Up Older.”) It’s the best song here, and the likeliest hit. But it is no coincidence that it is the one Jewel did not write  and that it sounds the least like Jewel. JON CARAMANICA\n\nTHE PINKER TONES\n\n“Wild Animals” (Pinkerland/Nacional)\n\nThe party never stops for the Pinker Tones, a pair of outlandishly upbeat D.J.’s from Barcelona. “Wild Animals,” the duo’s new album, offers a dozen tracks of disparate styles and sensibilities but with danceable rhythm as a steadily flowing undercurrent. Whatever else crops up in the music  retro-funk breakdowns, bachelor-pad bossa novas, catchy choruses in Romance languages  the beat endures and thrives.\n\nMr. Furia and Professor Manso, as the D.J.’s call themselves, share a fondness for electronic timbres both old and new, but much of the album escapes the tyranny of strobe lights and disco balls. “The Whistling Song” is buoyant ska, with guest vocals by Jimmy Lindsay of the 1970s funk band Cymande; “Electrotumbao” similarly features Amparo Sánchez of the Spanish electronic group Amparanoia. The opening track, “Hold On,” employs slide guitars, cowbells and folk-rock harmonies for a kind of catchy techno-twang.\n\nThe singing is mainly the work of Mr. Furia and Professor Manso themselves, along with a frequent collaborator, D.J. Niño. This is unusual enough for a dance-music act; what’s even stranger is that they sound credible as vocalists, often blending seamlessly in falsetto. “Let Go,” which closes the album, even ventures into Brian Wilson territory, as does the close of an otherwise archly cosmopolitan tune called “On Se Promenait.”\n\nOf course it’s wise not to look too closely at the lyrics here, which confirm that the Pinker Tones come to pop as producers rather than songwriters. That’s not taking anything away from the effectiveness of a tune like “S.E.X.Y.R.O.B.O.T.,” which has the potential to lodge itself into any human cranium. Or from this chorus: “I’m happy everywhere/It’s just that I’m a little bit scared.” The modesty and vulnerability implied by that couplet can only be assets for a group this confident and cheerily suave.
