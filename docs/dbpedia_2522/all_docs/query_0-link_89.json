        "text": "who is your TOP band of all time POST\n\nanswers please follow by your own playlist\n\nmines is the mighty radiohead\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/stig2009/playlist/7sA4HGPxtCrifUQoQBF5Qw\n\n@nicklaswachter4\n\nYeah they're up there, but I don't think it surpasses the work Dave did with Nirvana and the Foos. Nirvana killed a genre of music, and the Foos are one of the few 90's rockers that not just survived the 2000's but won like 13 Grammys.\n\nI know I'm about to get knives thrown at me, but I don't like Radiohead. I respect the work they did and the influence they had, but idk. There's many bands I prefer.\n\nHaha that song and video both are great!\n\nPretty sure Dave had some Foo Fighters songs written before Kurt died. Though we missed out on some potential from Nirvana, I cant say I'm bummed because of all the great stuff from the Foos.\n\nWhat I found interesting though is that Kurt was getting tired of the heavy rock and wanted to start doing more stuff like they did for the MTV NYC Live show. Kurt wasn't the best singer or guitarist, but the songwriting and passion was there, what I loved most about Nirvana.\n\nMine is Linkin Park. Probably because they were the first time I ever really gave rock music a chance and then I followed them most of my young adult life. They were pretty much my gateway into finding similar music. I've seen them twice in concert and own all their albums. I don't have a playlist specifically made for them on my account. I have a playlist that features them. I don't know if it really fits the topic but I'll post anyway because it has a lot of my favourite rock bands in it but it's a blend of country, rock, punk, post hardcore and pop (it's also pretty frikkin long, sorry not sorry. I usually just put it on shuffle). I don't think there's very much classic rock on it. That's a genre I'm trying to learn more about this year. Great post Idea btw!\n\nspotify:user:theckbert:playlist:4oTtTQwZHnVH16NyLe3uwX\n\nGosh, this is hard!\n\nI would say Primus and Mr.Bungle, I really can't choose between this two, they are both fundamental for my musical knowledge.\n\nEven though I don't listen to Primus often, they introduced me to the world of alternative music, and Les Claypool made me want to learn how to play bass.\n\nI still remember the first time I listened to \"Tommy The Cat\", I didn't loved it, but then it grew on me, and now it's one of my favorite songs ever.\n\nspotify:album:0kOQO9vavKO2O6iUOusbMM\n\nWhen I first listened to Mr. Bungle, particularly their first album, I felt like a wave of insanity and porpuseful wonky riffs scratched my face,and I loved them since then.\n\nWith just three albums, their whole discography, you can clearly see how they matured through the years.\n\nspotify:album:5TzQq2irJPHeHNnh11atPw\n\nI love all kinds of music and that's why I love the Bee Gees. They are completely underrated because most people see them as \"Disco\" act which they never were. They were imo the most versatile Songwriters and Singers ever. Their lead vocalists differed extremely and could do a lot with their great range (Barrys normal voice, Barry's falsetto, Robin's deep vibrato, Robin's high-pitched vocal, Maurice's harmonies) and went through lots of styles in their career. My playlist features some rare gems. Have a listen.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/serenaux/playlist/04xpsRul4d7atC40T3IUtU"
