        "text": "On May 8, 1945, the streets of American cities filled with throngs celebrating the Allied victory over fascism in Europe. That week, Aaron Copland, a forty-four-year-old Brooklyn-born composer of Russian-Jewish descent, received a Pulitzer Prize for his ballet score “Appalachian Spring.” It was a symbolic ceremony of arrival for an artist who had long labored to bring American composition out of obscurity and into the cultural mainstream. In Copland’s youth, most American concert halls and opera houses were essentially shrines to Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner; few native-born talents could win admittance without imitating the European masters. By the time Copland reached the peak of his career, in the late thirties and the early forties, he and other members of his generation, among them Samuel Barber, Roy Harris, and Virgil Thomson, had gained a foothold. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt died, three weeks before V-E Day, the luxurious lamentation of Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” unfurled on the radio.\n\nCopland seized the nation’s attention by forging a universally recognizable national sound. Works such as “Billy the Kid,” “Rodeo,” “Lincoln Portrait,” “Fanfare for the Common Man,” and “Appalachian Spring” became synonymous with the “open prairie,” as Copland titled the opening section of “Billy the Kid”; the texture and soul of the heartland seemed implicit in their sparse, open-ended contours, their lonely but happy melodies, their tangy tonal harmonies, their climactic tableaux of sounding brass and drums. At the same time, the music matched the collectivist ethos of the New Deal and Second World War period—the spirit of “common discipline,” as Roosevelt put it in his first inaugural address. Beneath the patriotic surface, these scores bore traces of the international leftist politics that preoccupied so many artists and intellectuals in the Roosevelt era. “Billy the Kid” evokes a frontier Eden threatened with urbanization and industrialization. “Lincoln Portrait” arranges quotations from Lincoln into a vaguely socialistic narrative (“As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master”). “Fanfare for the Common Man” takes its title from a speech that Vice-President Henry Wallace delivered in 1942, in which that most militantly leftist of New Dealers thundered, “The people’s revolution is on the march, and the devil and all his angels cannot prevail against it.”\n\nThe political subtext of Copland’s music from the thirties and forties is often overlooked today. Countless films, television commercials, news broadcasts, and campaign ads have employed Coplandesque open-interval melodies to suggest the innate goodness of small-town and rural life—elderly couples sitting on porches, newsboys on bicycles, farmers leaning on fences. A diluted version of the “open prairie” manner was heard in Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” campaign ads. The peroration of “Appalachian Spring,” with its grand and gritty harmonization of the Shaker tune “Simple Gifts,” has evolved into something like national theme music—the leitmotif of feel-good news.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, however, political watchdogs did not fail to notice Copland’s leftward leanings. Investigators in Congress and at the Federal Bureau of Investigation catalogued his multifarious links to progressive, radical, and fellow-traveller groups, notably the semi-Communist cadre of the Group Theatre. Between 1949 and 1953, Copland endured a gruelling test: media vilification after his appearance at the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, in New York; denunciations from anti-Communists in Congress; and a chilling session before Senator Joseph McCarthy’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Copland emerged from the ordeal apparently unscathed, and retained his iconic status. Yet he was never quite the same afterward. Coincidentally or not, “Appalachian Spring” turned out to be the last triumph of his all-American, music-for-the-masses period, the words of the Shaker hymn spelling out its elusive dream: “When true simplicity is gained / To bow and to bend we shan’t be ashamed.”\n\nAs the war ended, prospects seemed bright for the populist style that Copland had helped engineer. In 1946, Thomson, who doubled as the most acerbically perceptive critic of the day, crowed in the New York Herald Tribune, “We are producing very nearly the best music in the world.” As evidence, he offered a long list of names, including the boy wonder Leonard Bernstein, who had made a sensational conducting début with the New York Philharmonic, in 1943, and had established his compositional credentials with the oracular “Jeremiah” Symphony and the joyously hip musical “On the Town.”\n\nYet, even as the confetti was being swept from Times Square, V-E exuberance faded into a darker, more volatile state of mind. America was surging toward unprecedented domestic prosperity and global influence, but the mood at home turned cynical and edgy, as the middle class fell prey to the fear that Roosevelt had warned against at his first Inaugural. The fear focussed, above all, on Communism. The detonation of the first Soviet nuclear device in the summer of 1949 and the subsequent unmasking of the physicist Klaus Fuchs as a Soviet spy intensified the anti-Communist hysteria.\n\nNew Deal-style populism began to acquire a dubious reputation. Power-to-the-people gestures in the “serious” arts could now be read as evidence of a suspect consciousness. Modernists, on the other hand, garnered admiring adjectives such as “unyielding” and “uncompromising,” their contrary stance imbued with political as well as aesthetic implications. Thus, the critic Clement Greenberg trumpeted Abstract Expressionist painters as icons of a tough postwar spirit. In March, 1948, Greenberg announced in the pages of Partisan Review that, with the rise of Pollock and others, “the main premises of Western Art have at last migrated to the United States, along with the center of gravity of industrial production and political power.” The mainstream media went along to some extent with this conceit. In August, 1949, Life published photographs of Jackson Pollock’s “drip” paintings, and asked in a headline whether Pollock was “the Greatest Living Painter in the United States.” Given that Life was under the wing of Henry Luce, the mogul who heralded the “American Century,” Pollock’s abstractions acquired a certain political nobility.\n\nIn October, 1946, as the country was tilting to the right, Copland introduced his Third Symphony—his first attempt at a large-scale, four-movement symphony in the vein of Beethoven, Brahms, and, especially, Dmitri Shostakovich. At the height of the Second World War, Shostakovich had attained celebrity in America as a symbol of the common front against Hitler; Time, Luce’s other flagship publication, had put the composer on its cover in 1942, at the time of a nationwide broadcast of the Seventh Symphony, the “Leningrad.” The metallic sonorities and obsessively striving melodic ideas of Copland’s Third plainly echoed the language of Shostakovich’s most recent symphonies, which exemplified, at least on the surface, socialist realism in the musical realm.\n\nThe conductor Serge Koussevitzky, who commissioned the work for the Boston Symphony, dubbed it “the greatest American symphony.” But skepticism crept into the critical reaction; Time quoted a Boston critic calling the work “Shostakovich in the Appalachians.” The anonymous Time writer went on to say that Copland was now too popular for his own good—“too busy to be a great composer.” The implication was that Copland’s big-shouldered music was out of step with the temper of the times.\n\nThe Third had another, partly hidden political layer. In the finale, Copland quoted his own “Fanfare for the Common Man,” that muscular utterance inspired by Wallace’s “Century of the Common Man.” By the fall of 1946, Wallace was no longer a nationally respected figure. Roosevelt had in fact dropped him from the national ticket in 1944, wary of his undisguised friendliness toward the Soviets. Instead, Wallace became Commerce Secretary. In September, 1946, Truman fired him from that post on account of a string of pro-Soviet remarks. To be associated with an unrepentant New Dealer like Wallace had become a political risk. As the scholar Elizabeth Crist points out in her 2005 book “Music for the Common Man,” Virgil Thomson made this subtext explicit in a review of the symphony the following year, in which he mocked its resemblance to “the speeches of Henry Wallace, striking in phraseology but all too reminiscent of Moscow.”\n\nThomson’s attack on the Third Symphony was a brilliantly manipulative feat of musical politics, yet Copland himself was playing naïve ideological games. His occasional commentaries on the international situation showed little awareness of what life inside the Soviet Union was really like. In April, 1948, he attempted to analyze recent Soviet denunciations of composers, such as Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev, who had been reprimanded for espousing so-called “formalist” or obscurantist tendencies: “[The composers] were rebuked for failing to realize that their musical audience had expanded enormously in the last several years . . . and that composers can no longer continue to write only for a few initiates.” Such remarks brushed dangerously close to the Party line.\n\nIn March, 1949, Copland attended the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The event was the scene of one of the first great propaganda battles in the “cultural Cold War,” as the historian Frances Stonor Saunders calls it, and more than a few artistic reputations fell victim to the clash of ideologies. The martyr-in-chief was not Copland but Shostakovich, who had gone to America at Stalin’s behest. Weird scenes surrounded Shostakovich from the moment he arrived on American soil. The Broadwood Hotel, in Philadelphia, cancelled a dinner reservation that he had made after it received threats of violence. Demonstrators carried placards exhorting him to speak out or to defect: “Shostakovich, We Understand,” “Shostakovich! Jump Thru the Window!” The latter slogan, which was held aloft by a glum young man with a dandyish look, referred to the athletic defection of the schoolteacher Oksana Kasenkina the previous year.\n\nIt was not in Shostakovich’s nature to jump through the window. He read the speeches that were placed in front of him; he answered questions in accordance with instructions that were whispered in his ear. On the final night of the conference, he played a piano arrangement of the Scherzo of his Fifth Symphony at Madison Square Garden before an audience of eighteen thousand, while two thousand marchers protested outside. Through it all, Shostakovich maintained an indecipherable façade of nervous preoccupation. When the composer Morton Gould sidled up to him in the hope of hearing some candid confession, Shostakovich muttered, “It’s hot in here.”\n\nLeft-leaning American artists of all disciplines and persuasions gathered at the Waldorf to greet their Soviet counterparts. Some attendees came in a spirit of political sympathy, others out of artistic fellow-feeling or curiosity. Henry Wallace was there, and drew cheers as he entered. Time snidely observed, “The show might easily have been mistaken for an election rally for Henry Wallace, where the party line was pushed, but not too obviously.” Clifford Odets, Lillian Hellman, and Arthur Miller also attended. Thomas Mann sent a message of support. Copland’s role was especially prominent: he greeted Shostakovich at the airport and sat at the head table with Hellman and Wallace. The event had been covertly overseen by Soviet propagandists, working through the international Cominform organization.\n\nAssembled on the other side of the barricades was a coalition of disenchanted leftists who called themselves Americans for Intellectual Freedom. They holed up in a bridal suite at the Waldorf, determined to stem the tide of Communist propaganda. In the thick of the group was the composer Nicolas Nabokov, a friend of Stravinsky’s and a cousin of Vladimir Nabokov’s, who had written for Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in the nineteen-twenties and then, in 1933, gone to America. His music, close in style to Stravinsky’s, was relatively negligible, but his ability to cultivate high-level social and political connections was positively virtuosic, and in the postwar years he showed a Zelig-like ability to position himself in the middle of cultural imbroglios.\n\nAt the end of the war, Nabokov worked in the office of the Information Control Division in Berlin, helping to supervise the reorientation of German cultural life. He then applied for a position in the nascent Central Intelligence Agency; his sponsor was George F. Kennan, a chief architect of American Cold War policy. Failing to receive security clearance—evidently J. Edgar Hoover took a dim view of him—Nabokov decided to devote himself again to composition. Yet, by various twists and turns, he ended up on the C.I.A.’s payroll all the same. Americans for Intellectual Freedom was receiving clandestine support from the C.I.A., which had taken an interest in combatting Soviet influence through the promotion of anti-Communist and pro-democratic cultural activities. Nabokov’s subsequent protests that he had no knowledge of the C.I.A. connection are difficult to credit. Surely, when the president of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union handed him a wad of cash to pay the bill at the Waldorf, it must have crossed his mind that all was not as it seemed.\n\nAt the Waldorf, members of Americans for Intellectual Freedom fanned out to various speeches and panel discussions. Nabokov zeroed in on a Sunday-morning Fine Arts Panel, at which Shostakovich and Copland were scheduled to appear. The setting for the event was the fabled Starlight Roof ballroom, with its gilt ceiling and crystal chandeliers.\n\nShostakovich’s contribution was a five-thousand-word speech that ranged from music to international politics and on to Soviet domestic policy. It would be too much to say that the composer “delivered” it; he sat in silence while his interpreter read it aloud. The speech attacked Stravinsky for betraying his native Russia and joining the ranks of the Western modernists: “His beginnings were promising . . . but his moral barrenness reveals itself in his openly nihilistic writings, proclaiming the meaninglessness and absence of content in his creations. Stravinsky has no fear of that gaping abyss which separates him from the spiritual life of the people.” The speech also denounced “new aspirants for world domination, now engaged in resurrecting the theory and practice of Fascism.” This “small clique of hatemongers”—presumably the Cold Warriors of the Truman Administration—were developing weapons of mass destruction that stood in the way of world peace. The speech even criticized Hanson Baldwin, the military-affairs editor of the Times, for denigrating the economic status of Soviet Asian regions such as the Uzbek and Tajik republics. The conceit that Shostakovich was an avid reader of military-affairs coverage in the Times added a slight comic note to the proceedings. Two guards stood at Shostakovich’s side throughout the conference, presumably to prevent him from following Kasenkina out the window.\n\nCopland, despite his lingering proSoviet sympathies, observed the spectacle with due skepticism, distancing himself from the propaganda on both sides. At the Fine Arts Panel, he delivered a temperate, thoughtful speech in which he disavowed any political agenda, pointedly remarking that no one had given him a text to read. “I am going to start by saying that I wrote this paper myself,” he said. “Nobody told me what to say, and if anybody had tried to tell me what to say, I wouldn’t be here.” At the heart of the address was an affecting elegy for the lost idealism of the New Deal:\n\nLately I’ve been thinking that the Cold War is almost worse for art than the real thing—for it permeates the atmosphere with fear and anxiety. An artist can function at his best only in a vital and healthy environment for the simple reason that the very act of creation is an affirmative gesture. An artist fighting in a war for a cause he holds just has something affirmative he can believe in. The artist, if he can stay alive, can create art. But throw him into a mood of suspicion, ill-will and dread that typifies the Cold War attitude and he’ll create nothing.\n\nUnfortunately, the only part of Copland’s speech that drew notice in the papers was this: “The present policies of the American Government will lead inevitably into a third world war.”\n\nNabokov kept his gaze fixed on Shostakovich. He had a history of attacking the Soviet composer in print—in a 1943 article for Harper’s he declared that the American fad for Shostakovich signalled a decline in cultural values, a slide toward “absolute and immediate comprehensibility to large masses of people”—but he professed to feel some sympathy for the figure who stood before him in 1949. “Throughout the tumultuous conference, I watched his hands twist the cardboard tips of his cigarettes, his face twitch, and his whole posture express intense unease,” Nabokov recalled. “He seemed like a trapped man, whose only wish was to be left alone, to the peace of his own art and to the tragic destiny to which he, like most of his countrymen, had been forced to resign himself.”\n\nThe knowledge that Shostakovich lacked freedom of speech did not prevent Nabokov from forcing him to speak. At the Waldorf panel, the émigré rose from his seat to ask Shostakovich whether he really endorsed the official Soviet condemnation of Western modernists, Stravinsky chief among them. Shostakovich, who privately held Stravinsky’s music in high esteem, had no choice but to say, “I fully agree with the statements made in Pravda.” Decades later, Arthur Miller was still haunted by the memory of Shostakovich’s humiliation: “God knows what he was thinking in that room, what splits ran across his spirit.”\n\nSeveral days later, Life opened fire on the entire world of Henry Wallace, the New Deal, the Popular Front, and the U.S. Communist Party. A sardonic photo essay on the Waldorf conference highlighted Wallace as the “standout fellow traveler,” and a two-page photo gallery identified fifty “dupes and fellow travelers” who were said to be aiding the Communist cause. Copland, spelled “Copeland,” appeared alongside Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, Dorothy Parker, Langston Hughes, Charlie Chaplin, and various others who had attended the conference.\n\nIn addition, the attack in Life indicated that the media’s lionization of refugee intellectuals—Einstein and Mann had acquired hero status during the Second World War—was at an end. A “strange rogue’s gallery,” Mann called the Life spread. He had come to America in 1938. Fearing that his adopted homeland was falling victim to the same totalitarian madness that had consumed Germany, he began to think about emigrating once again, and in 1952 he moved to Switzerland, where he died, three years later. Mann had come to America looking for freedom from demonic politics; he did not find it.\n\nWhen the Waldorf debacle was over, Copland travelled to Paris, where he busied himself with tracking down the latest musical trends. In his student days, he had spent several years in Paris, taking lessons from the master pedagogue Nadia Boulanger and attending performances of works by Stravinsky and the merry-making band of composers known as Les Six. Now, in a letter to the composer Irving Fine and his wife, Verna, Copland reported that he was “ferreting out the dodecaphonistes,” by which he meant the twelve-tone composers, who were following in the footsteps of Arnold Schoenberg. In particular, he ferreted out the fearsome Pierre Boulez, who was on the verge of inventing a hyper-complex extension of twelve-tone writing that came to be called “total serialism.” Copland ascended the stairs to Boulez’s apartment, which occupied two rooms on the top floor of a building in the Marais, and heard the young master play parts of his intricately structured, outwardly violent Second Sonata. “But must we start a revolution all over again?” Copland asked, when it was over. “Mais oui,” Boulez replied. “Sans pitié.” The two composers met again a few days later, at a gathering of American expatriates that included the pianist Shirley Gabis and the gifted young composer Ned Rorem. Boulez once more banged out the Second Sonata, to the consternation of the neoclassical Americans. According to Rorem, Copland “stuck it out with a grin.” Afterward, he went to the piano to play his own granitic “Piano Variations,” from 1930; he wanted to show that “he was just as hairy as Boulez,” or so Rorem guessed.\n\nIn the fall of 1949, the question of Copland’s politics arose once more in the American media, and in a bizarre way. Schoenberg, who had been living in Southern California since 1934, abruptly took to the airwaves to denounce what he perceived to be a widespread backsliding toward empty-headed populism: “You cannot change the natural evolution of the arts by a command; you may make a New Year’s resolution to write only what everybody likes; but you cannot force real artists to descend to the lowest possible standards to give up morals, character, and sincerity, to avoid presentation of new ideas. Even Stalin cannot succeed and Aaron Copland even less.”\n\nVirgil Thomson published Schoenberg’s bellicose remarks in the Herald Tribune and then allowed Copland to respond. Copland wrote, “Mr. Schoenberg must have seen my picture in the papers in company with Shostakovich on the occasion of his brief visit here last spring. In America it is still possible (I hope) to share a forum platform with a man whose musical and political ideas are not one’s own without being judged guilty by association.”\n\nAt the F.B.I., in Washington, D.C., someone opened a file on the composer. (“Alias: Aaron Copeland,” it said on one page.) After Copland returned from a six-month tour of Europe and Israel, in 1951, J. Edgar Hoover wrote a note to his counterpart at the C.I.A.: “Copland has been abroad for some time and on June 25, 1951, he arrived in New York from Bombay, India, on TWA flight 6022-C. It would be appreciated if you would furnish this Bureau any information you have received concerning Copland’s activities while abroad.”\n\nIn 1951 and 1952, Copland delivered the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard, in which he sketched an exceptionally clear and canny picture of the ideological divide that was opening up in postwar music. On the one hand, he said, you have the composer of twelve-tone music or other “advanced” styles, who “is no longer writing music to satisfy himself” but instead is fighting “against a vocal and militant opposition” of socialist-realist composers. On the other hand, you have the “composer of communist persuasion,” who runs the risk of abandoning artistic quality for popular appeal.\n\nReading between the lines of Copland’s flat prose, you can sense his anxiety that he was falling too conspicuously into the second category. He had already been labelled a “fellow traveler” in the pages of Life. He had watched as old colleagues, such as Marc Blitzstein and Hanns Eisler, were subjected to interrogation or driven out of the country. As a gay man, he had extra reason to worry: the F.B.I. was conducting separate purges of homosexuals on the theory that they made easy targets for Soviet blackmail.\n\nOn January 20, 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated as President. Copland’s “Lincoln Portrait” had been scheduled for a preliminary Inaugural Concert by the National Symphony, but, two weeks before the event, Fred Busbey, an Illinois congressman, denounced the work as Communist propaganda and demanded that it be removed from the program. Making the case for Copland as a “fellow traveler,” Busbey read a long list of Copland’s affiliations into the Congressional Record, including his appearance at the Waldorf-Astoria conference; his support of Hanns Eisler, who had been interrogated by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 and then deported; and his relationships with such organizations as the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, the Artists’ Front to Win the War, the Citizens Committee for Harry Bridges, the National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, and the American Music Alliance of the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Busbey warned, “As the number of such activities or affiliations increase, any presumption of the innocence of such a person must necessarily decrease.”\n\nCopland released a statement couched in the defensive jargon of the day: “I say unequivocally that I am not now and never have been a communist or member of the communist party or of any organization that advocates or teaches in any way the overthrow of the United States Government.” Nonetheless, “Lincoln Portrait” was not played for President-elect Eisenhower at Constitution Hall.\n\nFinally, on May 22, 1953, came the dreaded telegram:\n\nYOU ARE HEREBY DIRECTED TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE ON MONDAY MAY TWENTYFIFTH AT TWO THIRTY P M ROOM 357 SENATE OFFICE BUILDING WASHINGTON DC – JOE MCCARTHY CHAIRMAN SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS.\n\nMcCarthy did not treat Copland as brutally as he did other witnesses, perhaps because the Senator was interested less in the composer’s career than in his educational activities on behalf of the U.S. State Department, which was supposedly riddled with Communists. In a diary, Copland wrote, “My impression is that McCarthy had no idea who I was or what I did.” The composer claimed ignorance of the Communist affiliations of the organizations to which he had been linked. Sometimes, he said, his name had been used without his knowledge. In other cases, the associations were tenuous; Copland’s role in the Citizens Committee for Harry Bridges had amounted to a one-dollar check. Less sincere was Copland’s claim that he had never knowingly consorted with a Party member. Fortunately, McCarthy’s investigators did not learn that in 1934 he had given a speech to a rally of Communist farmers in Minnesota.\n\nCopland, having submitted his written response to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, waited to be called back for a public hearing. But no call materialized. Apparently, he benefitted from the unlikely support of the anti-Communist newspaperman George Sokolsky, who privately urged McCarthy to lay off “one of America’s greatest living composers.” Still, there were repercussions. For a time, Copland was hassled when he tried to travel abroad; the passport agency declined to renew his passport, and repeatedly requested that he demonstrate affiliations with anti-Communist organizations. In 1953, he had several engagements rescinded on political grounds.\n\nHoward Pollack, in an authoritative biography of Copland published in 1999, points out that the composer’s political predicament, tense as it was, did not bring about a wholesale change of style. Copland did not abandon tonality in favor of twelve-tone writing, as Leonard Bernstein, among others, claimed. Only four certifiably twelve-tone works appeared from the time of the Waldorf-Astoria conference onward: the Piano Quartet, the “Piano Fantasy,” “Connotations,” and “Inscape.” These had clear connections to the more dissonant productions of the composer’s youth, notably his “Piano Variations” of 1930. In other postwar pieces, such as the frugally beautiful Emily Dickinson songs of 1949-50, Copland retained a version of his populist manner. All the same, the conspicuous stylistic split that appears in his later music—the almost schizophrenic alternation between a dense, dissonant language and an approachably tonal one—seems symptomatic of the political polarization of the time.\n\nCopland’s most ambitious project of the fifties was the opera “The Tender Land,” which applied the language of “Billy the Kid” and “Appalachian Spring” to a quietly moving tale of life on the prairie. Erik Johns’s libretto had undercurrents of social protest: the community becomes irrationally suspicious of two strangers in its midst, enacting in microcosm the paranoias of McCarthyite America. Taut tonal melodies and spare instrumentation bathe the scene in the familiar Edenic light. Copland hoped that “The Tender Land” would be broadcast on television, but the networks took no interest. The work instead had its première at New York City Opera, where it received weak reviews. Copland’s thousand-dollar commissioning fee was a gift from Rodgers and Hammerstein.\n\nWith “The Tender Land” almost completely overlooked, Copland’s most conspicuous postwar statement was, instead, “Connotations,” whose first performance took place in September, 1962. Few American orchestral works have ever enjoyed such a heavy media glare: the occasion of the première was the opening of Philharmonic Hall, the flagship venue of the new Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in Manhattan. CBS broadcast the concert to a television audience of twenty-six million people. Here was the mass public of which American composers had long dreamed. But Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood; some sudden rage welled up in him, some urge to confront the gala audience with dark news about the state of the world or to express a private agony that he left unspecified. “Connotations” is by a considerable margin the most dissonant score of Copland’s career, and it culminates in an apoplectically orchestrated sequence of chords encompassing all twelve notes of the chromatic scale. At intermission, he was greeted by Jacqueline Kennedy, who had come up from Washington for the event. Ordinarily at ease in cultural settings, the First Lady was rendered more or less speechless. “Oh, Mr. Copland,” she said. “Oh, Mr. Copland . . .”\n\nAfter that barbaric yawp of a piece, Copland’s output rapidly dwindled. “Inscape,” which Bernstein’s Philharmonic played in 1967, was of a more subdued, mysterious character. Copland’s last extended work, the Duo for Flute and Piano, from 1971, returns to a language of plainspoken eloquence, the flute’s opening solo sounding like a pastoral version of the adamantine trumpet line that begins “Fanfare for the Common Man.” Around the same time, Copland published a poignant little piano piece called “In Evening Air,” reviving some music that he had written in 1945 for the Office of War Information documentary “The Cummington Story,” which showed how a group of Eastern European refugees were initially spurned and later embraced by a New England town. Some of the same material, including a Polish lullaby, appears in one of his very last works, “Midday Thoughts,” from 1982. It’s as if Copland were dreaming back to a more hopeful time.\n\nAfter a point, music stopped running through his head. “It was exactly as if someone had simply turned off a faucet,” he told the critic Paul Moor. He began to suffer memory loss, the first sign of the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. He died in 1990, at the age of ninety. The epigraph for “In Evening Air,” from Theodore Roethke, told the story of his last years: “I see, in evening air, / How slowly dark comes down on what we do.”\n\nThere is an affecting recording of the elderly Copland rehearsing “Appalachian Spring” with the Columbia Chamber Ensemble. When he reaches the ending, an evocation of the American frontier in ageless majesty, his reedy, confident Brooklyn voice turns sweet and sentimental: “Softer, sul tasto, misterioso, great mood here. . . . That’s my favorite place in the whole piece. . . . Organlike. It should have a very special quality, as if you weren’t moving your bows. . . . That sounds too timid. It should sound rounder and more satisfying. Not distant. Quietly present. No diminuendos, like an organ sound. Take it freshly again, like an Amen.” Copland conjures a perfect American Sunday in which the music of all peoples streams from the open doors of a white-steepled church that does not yet exist. ♦"
