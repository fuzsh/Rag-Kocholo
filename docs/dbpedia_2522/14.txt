Overview

Writing process

In 2004, Rivers Cuomo began taking private music composition lessons from Bruce Reich at UCLA.[1] Some of the vocal harmonies written for "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" were originally composed for a focal counterpoint excercise from these lessons. Cuomo excitedly contacted Reich after the release of The Red Album, but was dismayed to learn that Reich had recently passed away.[1][2][3]

In describing his initial inspiration for the song, Cuomo has said, "I just had this really strong and kind of sudden conviction that I am sick of writing verse-chorus-verse songs. I've been doing it for so many years, that's what everyone else does; I wanna do something completely different."[3] Cuomo decided to instead write a song using the musical structure of theme and variations, as used in classical music, using different bands and musician styles (Slipknot, Jeff Buckley, Aerosmith, etc.) as the different variations. Cuomo intially also attempted to utilize different lyrical perspectives for each variation, but found the results too disjointed, and resolved to maintain the same persona throughout. Early alternate song titles in consideration included "Mack Daddy," "The Player," "Player 4 Life," and "The Ballad of Oswaldo Sánchez" (named for the Mexican soccer goalie). Cuomo was inspired by Sánchez after seeing him play the World Cup in 2006 despite Sánchez having just lost his father to a heart attack.[3]

Cuomo had difficulty writing the spoken word section of "The Greatest Man", and so contacted Rick Rubin to get examples of spoken word sections in pop songs. Rubin suggested Elvis Presley's rendition of "Are You Loneseome Tonight?," which Cuomo studied.[3] The lyrics for the spoken word section from "The Greatest Man" is derived from similar lyrics in Presley's song (which itself was partially derived from the play As You Like It by William Shakespeare).

At the time of the release of The Red Album, Cuomo called the song his favorite song on the album, and one of his favorite songs he's ever written.[4] Bassist Scott Shriner, in an interview, called the song "a masterpiece that includes ten different styles of music based around a common theme. It's awesome."[5]

The song's title includes the parenthetical "Variations on a Shaker Hymn," referring to the 1848 Shaker song "Simple Gifts," generally attributed to Joseph Brackett. As explained in the liner notes for the deluxe edition of The Red Album:

Recording

"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" was recorded in the "War Room", a space backstage at the Malibu Performing Arts Center in Malibu, California. The band taped butcher paper to the mirrors to write down ideas and plans for recording songs. According to Brian Bell, the band used about 20 feet of butcher paper just for "The Greatest Man" and spent about as much time discussing how to record the song as they did actually recording it.[6] According to Cuomo, the band rehearsed the song for about a month before embarking on the Troublemaker Tour, and about half of the rehearsal process was dedicated to learning "The Greatest Man."[4]

Music video

In late 2008, it was reported that a music video for "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" was planned with director Spike Jonze[7] (who previously directed music videos for "Undone - The Sweater Song," "Buddy Holly," and "Island in the Sun"). Ultimately, an official video never materialized. The song was used in the Warren Miller documentary Children of Winter, from which a segment was released as a music video on Weezer's official YouTube channel in late 2008:[8]

A low-budget video, featuring the band lip-syncing the song with a boom-box, was filmed when the band was selected as MTV's Artist of the Week:

Lyrics

Lyric sheet

Lyric sheet page 2

You try to play cool like you just don't care

But soon I'll be playin' in your underwear

I'm like a mage with the magic spell

You come like a dog when I ring your bell

I got the money and I got the fame

You got the hots to ride on my plane

You're givin' me all that I desire

Cuz down with me I'm takin' you higher

I'm the baddest of the bad

I'm the best that you've ever had

I'm the tops, I'm the thing

All the girls get up when I sing, yeah

I'm the meanest in the place

Step up, I'll mess with your face

I don't care where you are

Look up and follow the star

Ohh, I'm gonna tear down the wall

I may not be here when you call

So best be givin' me your all, ooo

After the havoc that I'm gonna wreak

No more words will critics have to speak

I've got the answers to the tangled knot

Sleep tight in your cot

Ohh baby, I've been told that I'm goin' crazy

Ohh baby, but I can't be held down

Ohh baby, somehow I'm keepin' it steady

Ohh baby, I'm tearin' up this town

Hey, this is what I like

Cut my heart with a martyr's spike

Hey, this is nothing new

I've got more than enough for you

I can take on anybody, I can do my thing

I don't wanna hurt nobody but a bee has got to sting

I'm 'a fix it if you mix it up

Talk smack then I'm a'gonna shut you up

I am the greatest man that ever lived

I was born to give

I am the greatest man that ever lived, oh

Radioactive

Somebody said all the world's a stage

And each of us is a player

That's what I've been trying to tell you

In Act I, I was struggling to survive

Nobody wanted my action dead or alive

Act II, I hit the big time

And bodies be all up on my behind

And I can't help myself

Cuz I was born to shine

And if you don't like it, you can shove it

But you don't like it, you love it

So I'll be up here in a rage

Till they bring the curtain down on this stage

I'm the greatest man that ever lived

I'm the greatest man that ever lived

I am the greatest man that ever lived

I was born to give and give and give

I am the greatest man that ever lived

Radioac-dioac-dioac-dioactive

I am the greatest man that ever lived

I was born to give
