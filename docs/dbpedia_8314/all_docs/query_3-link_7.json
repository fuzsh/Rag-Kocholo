        "text": "Her soaring voice, wonderful smile and her gentle charm won her fans across the generations – The Queen even borrowed the words of her most famous wartime anthem ‘We’ll Meet Again’ for her speech to the nation during the early days of the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nVera was born in London’s East Ham in 1917 and by the age of seven she was performing on stage. But it was the war years that showed her extraordinary character as well as talent. Vera sang on the London Underground stations that were being used as air-raid shelters. Her radio show, Sincerely Yours, was hugely popular, sending messages to those serving abroad and keeping up the country’s morale. Vera joined the Entertainments National Services Association (ENSA) and toured India, Egypt, Burma, as well as visiting the troops in Benghal just before the Battle of Kohmina."
