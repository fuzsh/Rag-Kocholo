        "text": "In this film from our collection we see Vera Lynn chatting to British and Burmese current troops of the 14th army in what was then India near the Burmese border. She's wearing the cap of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and an officer's tunic and shorts, but she's not singing here, she's chatting to soldiers.\n\nThe film was made on the 14th of May 1944 and it's notable for being the only known wartime actuality footage of Vera Lynn.\n\nShe created a feature film in 1943 called We'll Meet Again and this recreated scenes of her singing to troops, but this mute unedited footage here is unique. One of my favorite scenes is signing autographs. She was already a big radio star in Britain with her own show Sincerely Yours but she decided that radio wasn't enough and traveled to India, Burma and Egypt to entertain troops. She became known as the forces sweetheart; you can really see the light on these soldiers' faces as they meet her and hold out their slouch hats for her to sign. Dame Vera, who is now 103, has been in the news recently as the song which she first recorded in 1939 has been re-released, its message of hope and times of adversity has resonated as people have become separated from friends and family."
