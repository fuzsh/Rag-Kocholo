        "text": "We are halfway through 2024 so I wanted to rundown my top 10 favorite films of the year so far. I have seen 79 films this year, but I will only be taking into consideration films that released in the first half of the year. That means that festival titles like Dominic Savage’s Close to You, Aaron Schimberg’s A Different Man, Sean Wang’s Dìdi, Jesse Eisenberg’s A Real Pain, Fernando Andrés’s Rent Free, Greg Kwedar’s Sing Sing, and one fall release that I am not allowed to talk about yet will not be included even though all of these films would have either been in the top 10 or an honorable mention. With that down, here are a handful of honorable mentions from the first half of 2024 that nearly made this list.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nHow to Have Sex (dir. Molly Manning Walker)\n\nLate Night with the Devil (dir. Cameron Cairnes, Colin Cairnes)\n\nMonkey Man (dir. Dev Patel)\n\nProblemista (dir. Julio Torres)\n\n10. The First Omen (dir. Arkasha Stevenson)\n\nNo film this year surprised me more than The First Omen. Not only is the track record for horror prequels/remakes an abysmal one, but The Omen franchise in particular has had a rocky road. I only watched the original film for the first time prior to the release of this one and while I enjoyed it, it pales in comparison to other gnarly horror classics of the era like The Exorcist, Possession, and Suspiria. This also came out mere weeks after the release of another nun horror film Immaculate which was an obnoxious jump scare fest. And yet with all that baggage, Arkasha Stevenson directed one of the most suspenseful and riveting horror films I have seen in recent memory. The First Omen thrives not in constantly trying to make the audience go deaf but rather immersing them in an atmosphere full of dread and terror. Both the exceptional lead performance by Nell Tiger Free and the bone-chilling cinematography by Aaron Morton go a long way in making this film truly shine.\n\n9. Thelma (dir. Josh Margolin)\n\nEvery time I see June Squibb in a movie, it brings a huge smile to my face. That is a major reason why I had so much fun watching Thelma, a film that gives her the delightful leading role that she deserves. This was clearly a very personal film for Josh Margolin, loosely inspired by his own grandmother, and it playfully gives Squibb a story that feels like a hilarious mashup of Mission: Impossible and Paddington. She is surrounded by a fantastic ensemble that includes the likes of Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg, Malcolm McDowell, and the late Richard Roundtree who are all clearly having a blast not only with their own shenanigans but also bouncing off of June Squibb at the top of her game. A wonderful gem.\n\n8. I Saw the TV Glow (dir. Jane Schoenbrun)\n\nPerhaps an argument could be made that I Saw the TV Glow is the most ambitious, singular vision of the year. This is a movie that has firmly had its grasp on my mind since I first saw it a couple of months ago. What Jane Schoenbrun has done is invent their own visual language for one of the most viscerally haunting films of the year through a trans lens that both pierces through the souls of those that share their lived-in experience and captivates everyone else through a visceral power that feels almost indescribable. It thrives as a disturbing horror film and an emotional portrait of the solace people seek in media from a young age. The performances from Justice Smith and Brigette Lundy-Paine, along with some of the sequences in this film are so striking and profound.\n\n7. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (dir. George Miller)\n\nIt was always going to be a high bar to live up to the magnum opus that is Mad Mad: Fury Road. While clearly it failed to match its limited success at the box office, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is another bonkers, exhilarating jump into George Miller’s Wasteland. It features the most ferocious action set pieces I have seen in a movie this year while delving deeper into the backstory of one of cinema’s most iconic action heroines. Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne both command the screen playing Furiosa at different ages, perfectly complimenting what Charlize Theron accomplished so beautifully in Fury Road while Chris Hemsworth dominates the film as the chaotic antagonist Dementus. Now that we have Furiosa, it feels damn near impossible to separate it from Fury Road as they are now brilliant companion pieces to one another.\n\n6. Hundreds of Beavers (dir. Mike Cheslik)\n\nHundreds of Beavers is the funniest film of the year by far and I am willing to guarantee that nothing will come close in the remainder of 2024. It is a miracle that this movie even exists, a hysterical homage to Looney Tunes and Charlie Chaplin while also serving as an innovative benchmark for comedy. The laughs-per-minute ratio here is through the roof as director Mike Cheslik, writer and star Ryland Brickson Cole Tews, and all those damn beavers throw everything at the screen with such extreme, relentless glee. There has never been a movie like Hundreds of Beavers and the world is all the better for its existence.\n\n5. Ghostlight (dir. Kelly O’Sullivan, Alex Thompson)\n\nIf I cannot talk about Sing Sing here as a triumphant exploration of the healing power of art, then at the very least I need to talk about Ghostlight, Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson’s terrific film that happens to explore similar themes through a very different context. The film explores such a raw, vulnerable family dynamic, played perfectly by Keith Kupferer, Tara Mallen, and Katherine Mallen Kupferer who are also a family in real life. Seeing these characters find catharsis through performance and theater as they are in mourning makes for such a powerful viewing experience that clearly came from the heart. Not a lot of people know about this film and I hope that my glowing recommendation encourages people to seek it out. Very few films moved me on an emotional level as much as this one did.\n\n4. Hit Man (dir. Richard Linklater)\n\nWatching Hit Man at last year’s TIFF was one of the highlights of the entire festival, another banger from Richard Linklater that played the roof off with my packed premiere audience. I feared that the film would not hold up as well on a rewatch but thankfully, it remains absolutely fantastic. I have been a fan of Glen Powell’s for years, but this is the starring role that showcases just how much of a charismatic screen presence he is, especially as he shares such phenomenal chemistry with Adria Arjona who stands toe-to-toe with him every step of the way. It is incredibly funny, sexy, and even thoughtful in how it examines this moral struggle with identity. It ranks among Linklater’s very best films.\n\n3. Inside Out 2 (dir. Kelsey Mann)\n\nThe film that has taken the world by storm, the latestto enter the billion dollar club, is not only a much needed win at the box office for Pixar but also one of their best films in years. Inside Out 2 may have gotten some flack for not being quite as good as its masterful predecessor but, like I argued in my piece about the film from a few weeks ago, few films are as good as Inside Out. Where this film excels, and where it takes a page from the Toy Story sequels, is that it manages to be a natural evolution of the story and themes of the first film. They recognize that the concepts of the original have so much creative potential that was worthy of being explored in a second installment. Even with the absence of Pete Docter in the director’s chair, Kelsey Mann does a phenomenal job stepping in and keeping the imagination alive in a sequel that is emotionally nuanced and complex while also being a tremendous amount of fun. Also, it’s the second film on this list to feature June Squibb!\n\n2. Dune: Part Two (dir. Denis Villeneuve)\n\nWhat can be said about Dune: Part Two that hasn’t already been said? Denis Villeneuve has been on a remarkable streak of consistently great films ever since Polytechnique, and it feels like a privilege that we get to be alive at the same time that he is cementing his place in film history. All of the promise that was brilliantly set up in the first Dune is paid off to perfection here. This is blockbuster filmmaking on an unparalleled level with some of the most astonishing technical crafts ever put to screen but through the massive scope, Villeneuve never loses sight of the characters, allowing this incredible ensemble to immerse themselves into their roles, all of them delivering top notch work. It is a pulse-pounding sci-fi epic that is going to be remembered as an instant classic.\n\n1. Challengers (dir. Luca Guadagnino)\n\nAfter a few months and several repeat viewings, I have still not come down from the sensational high that is Challengers. Luca Guadagnino takes his sensual vision as a director to the next level with an intoxicating film that I could not take my eyes off of. The trio of performances from Zendaya, Mike Faist, and Josh O’Connor are spectacular as they share such electric sexual chemistry with each other that keeps the energy in every scene to astronomical highs. It’s all captured in a thrilling non-linear structure that builds up the tension to such high degrees as it culminates in a fist-pumping, all-timer of an ending. Every single aspect of this movie, from the sizzling screenplay by Justin Kuritzkes to the banger score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, makes for a magnetic experience that might be hard to top. But hey, Guadagnino and much of the same crew are back at it again with Queer later this year so we might be in for even more delectable cinema.\n\nWhat are your top 10 favorite films of the year so far? Are there any movies that I didn’t include that you loved this year? Leave your thoughts down below.\n\nFor more of my thoughts on the latest in film, please follow me on Twitter and Letterboxd.\n\nAround this time a year ago, I posted my predictions for what could play at last year’s major fall festivals, those being the Venice Film Festival, the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the New York Film Festival. Back then, I went by each festival individually and tried to predict part of their lineups. This year, I want to take a different approach and run down a list of 25 films ranging from world premieres as well as films that played earlier this year at other festivals and try to predict how their festival runs will pan out. This is purely speculation just for fun as I have no inside information on where these movies will be playing. I’m sure that there will be plenty of surprises along the way whether they be from these 25 films or even some surprise movies that none of us have even heard of yet that could break out in the fall (remember, none of us knew about American Fiction a year ago). What we do have is some rumors floating around in the major trades that I will take into account when making my predictions. Also, one film on this list has a confirmed world premiere that I will touch on as well.\n\nBefore we get into it, I am not predicting the following films to play at any of the major fall festivals:\n\nThe Collaboration (dir. Kwame Kwei-Armah)\n\nEmmanuelle (dir. Audrey Diwan)\n\nGladiator II (dir. Ridley Scott)\n\nJuror No. 2 (dir. Clint Eastwood)\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night (dir. Jonathan Kent)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim (dir. Kenji Kamiyama)\n\nMegalopolis (dir. Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nMother Mary (dir. David Lowery)\n\nNosfertatu (dir. Robert Eggers)\n\nWicked (dir. Jon M. Chu)\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nThe Actor (dir. Duke Johnson)\n\nI predicted that The Actor would premiere at last year’s TIFF, but then it got delayed. There is still not official confirmation that the film is coming out this year, but I am inclined to believe that we will finally see Duke Johnson’s follow-up to Anomalisa at TIFF this year. His last film, which he co-directed with Charlie Kaufman, was a TIFF world premiere and I would be surprised if this one skipped out on that festival. Maybe there is a possibility that it also plays at Telluride or NYFF, but I am going to stick with predicting that it follows in the footsteps of Anomalisa and only does one festival.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nAll We Imagine As Light (dir. Payal Kapadia)\n\nThe winner of the Grand Prix prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival is destined to play at least a couple of the major fall fests. All We Imagine As Light was one of the most raved titles that played at Cannes and should be a hot ticket wherever it plays. I don’t expect this (or any other Cannes title) to play at Venice, but the remaining three are all fair game. I am getting the sense that, while it’s entirely possible that it plays Telluride, I expect to see Payal Kapadia’s film show up next at TIFF and follow that up with NYFF.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nAnora (dir. Sean Baker)\n\nFrom the Grand Prix to the Palme d’Or, Anora is a no brainer for fall festivals. NEON took their last four Palme d’Or winners to Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF with the exception of Titane which skipped Telluride. Sean Baker is a filmmaker that the fall festivals love to celebrate whenever he has a new movie so I would be shocked to see any of them miss out on screening what might be his biggest title to date. Telluride missed out on The Florida Project while TIFF missed out on Red Rocket (NYFF got both films), but I still believe that all three will join the fun together on this one.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nThe Apprentice (dir. Ali Abbasi)\n\nThe Apprentice is in the biggest limbo of any movie this year, even now surpassing Megalopolis which managed to get distribution from Lionsgate for a late September release. The film premiered at Cannes to mixed reviews despite some praise for both Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. It still has no distributor and received a cease and desist letter from the orange man in an attempt to block its release. Ali Abbasi’s last two films, Border and Holy Spider both went to Telluride and TIFF following their Cannes debuts while Border also went to NYFF, but I have a feeling that there could be a scenario where the controversy surrounding the film bars it from playing any festivals later this year. Still, I am inclined to believe that it will show up at TIFF with the slight possibility that it adds on Telluride or NYFF to its run.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nBird (dir. Andrea Arnold)\n\nAndrea Arnold’s latest film got mostly positive reviews out of Cannes, but I have a feeling that the enthusiasm surrounding it is going to increase once it reaches the fall fests. Looking at her previous films, American Honey went to TIFF, her documentary Cow went to Telluride, and Fish Tank went to both. I believe that Bird is going to follow in the footsteps of Fish Tank and play both of those festivals. I did wonder if maybe this one could add a NYFF screening to its run, but I feel like that is probably unlikely. Regardless, this is one of the films I’m most looking forward to seeing.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nBlitz (dir. Steve McQueen)\n\nI vividly remember last year when Blitz seemed all but destined to play at this year’s Cannes. Now, I’m struggling to figure out which festivals, if any, will play this movie. There are rumblings that the film was not submitted to either Venice or Telluride which is very surprising. Looking at Steve McQueen’s past films, last year’s documentary Occupied City played both Telluride and NYFF following Cannes, a couple of his Small Axe films played at NYFF after they were originally planned to screen at Cannes until the pandemic hit, Widows premiered at TIFF, his Best Picture-winning 12 Years a Slave played Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF, Shame premiered at Venice then went to TIFF and NYFF, and Hunger went to Cannes, Venice, TIFF, and NYFF. So McQueen’s festival history has very eclectic groupings, but they all have at least some appearance. I could maybe see this being a TIFF world premiere, but I am going to predict that NYFF snags the world premiere since all of these films except Widows played at this festival. Perhaps may choose it as one of their big gala selections.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: Maybe\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nConclave (dir. Edward Berger)\n\nEdward Berger burst onto the scene when All Quiet on the Western Front world premiered at TIFF and went on to be one of the biggest films in Oscar consideration. So a lot of eyes are on his next feature, Conclave. Focus Features is releasing it in a prime November release date and I would be shocked if it was not a festival film. There might be a chance that this shows up at either Venice or Telluride first, but I think that Berger will return to TIFF to debut the film. If it does end up screening at another festival first, my guess would be that it would be Telluride.\n\nVenice: Maybe\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nA Different Man (dir. Aaron Schimberg)\n\nI saw A Different Man at New Directors/New Festival earlier this year and absolutely loved it. It had its world premiere back at Sundance where it received very positive reviews and raves for Sebastian Stan, Renate Reinsve, and Adam Pearson’s performances. A24 is releasing the film and while Aaron Schimberg’s previous feature Chained for Life did not play at any of the major fall festivals, I think this will make an appearance at TIFF before it releases later in September. Maybe it can even screen at Telluride right beforehand.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nEmilia Pérez (dir. Jacques Audiard)\n\nAnother Cannes title that was among the hottest titles was Emilia Pérez. Jacques Audiard’s latest won two prizes, those being the Jury Prize and an Ensemble award for the quartet of actresses that led the film. This is absolutely destined to play at TIFF, I would be shocked if it doesn’t. The way that this was talked up at Cannes, it sounded like the biggest crowdpleaser of the festival which is music to the ears of the TIFF programmers. Maybe it can also play at Telluride as well, but for now I’m gonna say that it goes straight to TIFF and will immediately skyrocket up people’s watchlists among that lineup.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nThe End (dir. Joshua Oppenheimer)\n\nBefore they dominated Cannes with Anora and another film that I will get to later, many thought that NEON’s big contender this year would be Joshua Oppenheimer’s narrative debut, The End. His beloved documentaries both had fall festival premieres with The Act of Killing going to Telluride and TIFF and The Look of Silence attending all four major festivals. I do wonder if maybe there’s a chance that NEON holds onto this film for next year, but if I am going by the perception that it will be released this year then I will be predicting it to premiere at Venice but might hold off on the other festivals.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Maybe\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nThe Fire Inside (dir. Rachel Morrison)\n\nAfter working as a cinematographer on films like Fruitvale Station, Black Panther, and Oscar-nominated for Mudbound, Rachel Morrison steps into the director’s chair for The Fire Inside, formally titled Flint Strong. The screenplay was penned by Moonlight director Barry Jenkins and was originally slated to release before the fall festivals until getting delayed to Christmas. This has TIFF premiere written all over it with the only other possibility being that it also pops up at Telluride first. I’m hoping that this will be a good one.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nHard Truths (dir. Mike Leigh)\n\nMike Leigh is back with a new film called Hard Truths starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste. Whenever he has a new movie, he is a staple of Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF with very few exceptions so those three are all but guaranteed. Venice is a wild card because normally he premieres his films at Cannes or another early film festival rather than premiering at Venice. However his last film Peterloo did world premiere at Venice (although that film interestingly skipped NYFF which is rare for Leigh). Hard Truths has yet to play at any film festival so I believe that it will world premiere at Venice, making this the only title on this list that I am predicting to go to all four festivals.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nHere (dir. Robert Zemeckis)\n\nGetting the obvious out of the way, Robert Zemeckis has been on a rough streak as of late with films like The Witches, Welcome to Marwen, and the Disney live-action remake of Pinocchio. Normally it would be a joke to even consider a festival run for one of his films. However, it wasn’t that long ago when both The Walk and Flight had gala premieres at NYFF. His latest film Here is a reunion with his two Forrest Gump leads as well as that films screenwriter Eric Roth (who has been on a hot streak of every film he writes since The Curious Case of Benjamin Button gets nominated for Best Picture, even the disastrous Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close). Sony Pictures is releasing the film in limited release mid-November so I wonder if maybe this could have a premiere at NYFF and be a surprise return to form for Zemeckis.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: No\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nIn the Hand of Dante (dir. Julian Schnabel)\n\nJulian Schnabel returns with In the Hand of Dante which has an intriguing, yet puzzling cast that includes Oscar Isaac, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Gerard Butler, Al Pacino, John Malkovich, and even Martin Scorsese. This is Schnabel’s first feature since At Eternity’s Gate which earned Willem Dafoe a Best Actor nomination and premiered at Venice before playing as the Closing Night film at NYFF. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which likely was close to a Best Picture nomination as it had 4 nominations including Best Director, was a Cannes premiere where he won the Best Director prize, which was then followed by a fall festival run at Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF. This film sounds more peculiar than both of those films, but I still think that Venice will welcome him back.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: No\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux (dir. Todd Phillips)\n\nTruth be told, I was ready to say that Joker: Folie à Deux was going to skip festivals. I know that the first film won the Golden Lion at Venice then played at both TIFF and NYFF, but I believed that it would follow in the footsteps of Dune: Part Two which, despite the first playing at the same three festivals, was planning to skip the fall festivals entirely prior to when they decided to delay the film. That being said, recent rumblings suggest that Todd Phillips may in fact be aiming to return to Venice with the Joker sequel which has me rethinking my prediction. I still think it might skip TIFF this time because they might wanna control the narrative around the movie and not show it to the festival that appeals most to the average movie-goer, but now I will be trusting the rumors that it will appear at Venice and that perhaps it could also have a U.S. premiere at NYFF the week of its theatrical release.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: Maybe\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nMaria (dir. Pablo Larraín)\n\nI am very confident that Maria, the third film in Pablo Larraín’s biopic trilogy following Jackie and Spencer should be a major festival contender. It could possibly go to all four fests, but that would make it the first in the trilogy to do so. Both Jackie and Spencer went to Venice and TIFF so those are absolute guarantees while Jackie added NYFF to its run and Spencer played at Telluride. I think that Maria will be closer to Jackie‘s festival run if it doesn’t end up going to all four festivals, but I can see it going the Spencer route as well. Regardless, it will be one of the most in-demand tickets of fall festival season.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nMemoir of a Snail (dir. Adam Elliot)\n\nMemoir of a Snail is right at the top of my most anticipated films of the rest of the year. Adam Elliot’s long-awaited sophomore feature following the masterpiece Mary and Max recently premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival where it won the Cristal Award for Best Feature Film. It may be unwise to predict this to play at fall festivals since Mary and Max‘s biggest festival screening happened at Sundance and it didn’t even get a proper theatrical release in the U.S., but that film’s popularity has only grown in the years since it came out and Memoir of a Snail already has distribution from IFC Films. I think that TIFF and NYFF will bite and screen this film in their lineups with the possibility that maybe Telluride joins in.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nNickel Boys (dir. RaMell Ross)\n\nI remember last year when I predicted that Nickel Boys would world premiere at TIFF until it got held back to this year. RaMell Ross’s Oscar-nominated documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening was an award winner at Sundance but did not go to any of the major festivals since it released in September. Amazon MGM Studios slated this film to release in limited release in late October, making this a prime candidate to have a world premiere at a fall fest. My guess is that it will have its world premiere at Telluride then ride that buzz to TIFF where it could potentially be a People’s Choice Award contender.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Maybe\n\nNightbtich (dir. Marielle Heller)\n\nHere we have our first confirmed fall festival movie! Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch was recently announced as a world premiere title at TIFF along with films like Mike Flanagan’s The Life of Chuck and DreamWorks Animation’s The Wild Robot. Amy Adams was also announced to be receiving this year’s TIFF Tribute Performer award, the prize that previously went to Oscar winners Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, Anthony Hopkins for The Father, Jessica Chastain for The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Brendan Fraser for The Whale, and my predicted Best Actor winner this year Colman Domingo for Sing Sing. This marks a return to TIFF for Heller after both Can You Ever Forgive Me? and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood played at the festival in their respective years. I do not anticipate that it will go on to play at NYFF, but this is very exciting news regardless and I am extremely excited to see it.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: Confirmed\n\nNYFF: No\n\nThe Piano Lesson (dir. Malcolm Washington)\n\nI almost considered leaving The Piano Lesson off of this list. Neither of the last two August Wilson adaptations, Fences or Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, had fall festival runs and this is the directorial debut from Denzel Washington’s son Malcolm Washington. And yet, I can’t help but shake the feeling that Netflix will want to bring this film to Telluride and TIFF to try to get some awards buzz for its actors John David Washington, Danielle Deadwyler, and especially Samuel L. Jackson whom many think is a major contender to win Best Supporting Actor this year. Maybe this continues the trajectory of the other adaptations and skips fests altogether, but I’m gonna go with my gut on this one.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nQueer (dir. Luca Guadagnino)\n\nThis is it. This is the film that I am predicting to be the hottest ticket at the fall festivals. After Luca Guadagnino took the film world by storm with Challengers earlier this year, he is back with Queer starring Daniel Craig in what many think could potentially be an Oscar-winning role. He brought much of the same behind the camera talent along with him. There is heavy speculation that a Venice premiere is basically guaranteed after Challengers was originally slated to open the fest last year, and I think the film will have a healthy run afterwards as it looks for distribution. Bones and All went to Venice, Telluride, and NYFF, Call Me By Your Name had premieres at Sundance, TIFF, and NYFF, I Am Love screened at Venice and TIFF, and we had A Bigger Splash and Suspiria only play Venice. I think that it might be tough to say that Telluride will get the film, but I feel certain that TIFF and NYFF will be eager to include it in their lineups.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nA Real Pain (dir. Jesse Eisenberg)\n\nOne of the most buzzed titled at this year’s Sundance was A Real Pain which was written and directed by Jesse Eisenberg. He also stars in the film alongside Kieran Culkin who has been receiving lots of awards consideration for his performance. I saw the film virtually at the festival and quite enjoyed it, particularly loving Culkin’s work. Searchlight bought the film and plans to release it in October so I am extremely confident that they will want to restart buzz for this film by screening it at both Telluride and TIFF.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nThe Room Next Door (dir. Pedro Almodóvar)\n\nWe recently got confirmation that Pedro Almodóvar’s first English-language feature The Room Next Door will be released later this year by Sony Pictures Classics. The film only recently finished shooting, but Almodóvar has been known for his quick post-production process and getting his movies finished so quickly after shooting that they’re ready for festivals. Parallel Mothers finished filming in April after a little over a month of principal photography and then premiered at Venice a few months later, followed by Closing Night at NYFF. Pain and Glory, Volver, and Bad Education all premiered at Cannes then went onto play at Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF while Julieta, The Skin I Live In, and Broken Embraces went to all of those except for Telluride, and Talk to Her went to the same fests except for Cannes. All About My Mother only did Cannes and NYFF. My guess for The Room Next Door is that it will have its world premiere at Venice, perhaps it might skip Telluride, then will screen at TIFF and NYFF. I also think this could be a strong contender for an Opening Night slot at NYFF.\n\nVenice: Yes\n\nTelluride: Maybe\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nThe Seed of the Sacred Fig (dir. Mohammad Rasoulof)\n\nThere was so much buzz at Cannes when Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran after he was heinously sentenced to 8 years in prison so that he could screen his film The Seed of the Sacred Fig. he and the film received the most rapturous standing ovation at this year’s festival and it got great reviews. It went onto win a special Screenplay prize in addition to the next film I will be mentioning which felt like a way of the jury recognizing the bravery Rasoulof displayed with his film and his escape. NEON acquired the film before it even premiered and I have a feeling that they’re just getting started. Once this film makes the rounds at Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF like I predict it will, I think the hype is only going to skyrocket even higher.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: Yes\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: Yes\n\nWe Live in Time (dir. John Crowley)\n\nAnother film in A24’s slate this year is We Live in Time starring Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh. This is the latest feature from John Crowley who previously directed the Oscar-nominated Brooklyn which premiered at Sundance then screened at both TIFF and NYFF, and the critically panned The Goldfinch which premiered at TIFF days before its theatrical release. I think it’s safe to say that TIFF will welcome Crowley back regardless of the quality of the film, but I have my fingers crossed that this is closer to Brooklyn.\n\nVenice: No\n\nTelluride: No\n\nTIFF: Yes\n\nNYFF: No\n\nWhat films do you think will play at each of the four major festivals this year? Any movies that I failed to mention that you think can make an appearance? Let me know what you think down in the comments.\n\nFor more of my thoughts on the latest in film, please follow me on Twitter and Letterboxd.\n\nI had the pleasure of attending this year’s Tribeca Festival. Over the past week and a half, I saw fifteen feature films and today I will run down each title from my least favorite to my favorite. Overall, the lineup featured some mostly solid films with some unfortunate misfires and only a small handful that stood out among the pack. So let’s get started.\n\n15. Winter Spring Summer or Fall (dir. Tiffany Paulsen)\n\nBy far the weakest title I watched at Tribeca this year is Winter Spring Summer or Fall, a romance film that aims to be charming and heartfelt but ends up being creepy right from the start. Jenna Ortega tries her best with an incredibly weak material and acting opposite a bland scene partner in Percy Hynes White. It doesn’t help that his character is literally a stalker from the beginning of the film and yet the film tries its hardest to paint this as endearing and rewards his character for his behavior. Their chemistry is nonexistent as the script is flooded with every cliché imaginable. An absolute disaster.\n\n1/5\n\n14. Mars (dir. Stevan Najarian)\n\nYour milage may vary on Mars depending on how big a fan you are of The Whitest Kids U’Know. I heard from people who went to the premiere screening that was filled with fans that they had the time of their lives. My press screening was not very receptive to the film at all. I went into it with limited knowledge of the comedy group and knew that it was also a tribute to Trevor Moore, one of their own who passed away recently. So I feel bad to say that the humor and animation style for this struck out with me. It has its moments that made me laugh out loud like a great running gag with acronyms and a hilariously nihilistic news anchor, but it felt like they struggled immensely to stretch this concept to a feature film.\n\n1.5/5\n\n13. Lake George (dir. Jeffrey Reiner)\n\nPairing Shea Whigham and Carrie Coon in a crime film sounds like it could make for an entertaining movie. Unfortunately, Lake George plays it safe with a fairly pedestrian, mediocre narrative. Both actors are committed to the material and deliver solid performances, but the pacing is sluggish and it only starts to get interesting at the beginning of the third act as it tries to throw some twists into the conflict. And even then, the film long overstays its welcome as it adds a seemingly endless amount of epilogues that had me clamoring for the credits to roll.\n\n2/5\n\n12. Daddio (dir. Christy Hall)\n\nThis is a title that I missed at TIFF and remembered hearing solid reception from those I know who saw it there. Now having seen Daddio, I found it to be a pretty mixed bag. The direction from first-time director Christy Hall is very impressive with solid camerawork, and she gets great performances out of both Dakota Johnson and Sean Penn. The problems arise from the screenplay which tries to delve deep into both of these characters, but ends up not really scratching the surface. In terms of chamber pieces that take place entirely in a car ride, I found myself being constantly reminded of Locke from a decade ago and wanting to revisit that instead.\n\n2.5/5\n\n11. The Shallow Tale of a Writer Who Decided to Write About a Serial Killer (dir. Tolga Karaçelik)\n\nAs soon as I read the title for The Shallow Tale of a Writer Who Decided to Write About a Serial Killer, I immediately became interested. That title had my curiosity while the cast including John Magaro, Steve Buscemi, and Britt Lower had my attention. That makes it even more crushing that the end result was by far the most disappointing film of the festival. That’s not to say that it’s a bad movie, it certainly has its strengths in the trio of performances, some genuinely funny scenarios that the characters are put in, and a palpable sense of tension throughout. What drags it all down is its bizarre tonal inconsistencies, hazy narrative, and an abysmal conclusion that is wholly unsatisfying.\n\n2.5/5\n\n10. The Dog Thief (dir. Vinko Tomičić)\n\nThe Dog Thief is one of the better crafted films that I saw at Tribeca. The cinematography is fantastic and the performances are solid from both Franklin Aro and Alfredo Castro. It’s a film that has good intentions and Vinko Tomičić makes the motivations and desires of his protagonist clear, empathetic, and understandable. The desperate lengths that he goes to in order to get what he wants undermine those motivations and make it incredibly difficult to root for him like the film wants us to. It just made me feel bad for this poor dog.\n\n2.5/5\n\n9. The Devil’s Bath (dir. Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala)\n\nBy far the most unsettling film I watched at the festival, The Devil’s Bath is an intriguing, devastating look into the depressing, draining life of a woman who thought that she was going to live a married life of happiness. Anja Plaschg’s performance is astounding and I greatly admired Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala’s restraint, avoiding the jump scare pitfalls that most horror films fall under these days and instead crafting a dreadful atmosphere. That being said, the film lags a lot in its second act and the some of the grotesque imagery felt too excessive.\n\n3/5\n\n8. Griffin in Summer (dir. Nicholas Colia)\n\nGriffin in Summer won three prizes at Tribeca, those being the New Narrative Director award, Best Screenplay, and Best U.S. Narrative Feature. I’m frankly a little surprised that this film was so embraced. It’s a cute movie with terrific performances from Everett Blunk, Melanie Lynskey, Owen Teague, and Abby Ryder Forston, and it starts and ends fairly strong. The issues arise in how it fumbles finding a delicate balance in its themes and tone. The main character can be quite fun to follow in some moments and extremely grating in others. It also plays a little too loose with some of the dangerous scenarios that he finds himself in. Still, there are enough strengths here to recommend the film overall.\n\n3/5\n\n7. Skywalkers: A Love Story (dir. Jeff Zimbalist)\n\nMy experience watching Skywalkers: A Love Story was one of the most stressful that I have had in a very long time, and I didn’t even see it in IMAX. Seeing Angela Nikolau and Ivan Berkus sneakily find their way to the top of the tallest buildings in the world to take photos and videos of themselves is both breathtaking and horrifying, especially as someone with a fear of heights. That being said, it’s all presented in a standard documentary that doesn’t take any risks with its filmmaking and its exploration of their love for one another feels surface-level. It’s a serviceable means of witnessing the insanity and bravery of these two performers.\n\n3/5\n\n6. In the Summers (dir. Alessandra Lacorazza)\n\nIn the Summers won the Directing award and Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival this year, but it was one of the films that I missed. Catching up with it now, I found that it started with such promise. I immediately connected with the performances across the board, particularly from Residente and later in the film from Lio Mehiel and Sasha Calle. The Latine specificity in the family dynamic resonated with me and I thought I was witnessing what could be a heartbreaking film on the level of Aftersun. That makes it more disappointing that the screenplay falls into generic territory that paints broad strokes in its characterization and loses much of its nuance. Still, the highs are worth checking out.\n\n3/5\n\n5. Jazzy (dir. Morrisa Maltz)\n\nI have yet to see Morrisa Maltz’s previous feature The Unknown Country, but after seeing Jazzy I am now even more compelled to go back and watch that film. I found this to be an immersive coming-of-age story that may not have a complex plot (or really any plot for that matter), but has great vibes. Jasmine Bearkiller Shangreaux and Syriah Foohead Means are such a joy to watch together as we see them navigate childhood. The two of them even have a story credit on the film. I also liked how the camera almost exclusively focuses on these two and the other kids they encounter, leaving the adults blurry in the background or off screen entirely until they are absolutely needed. It made for an engrossing, pure experience.\n\n3.5/5\n\n4. Boys Go to Jupiter (dir. Julian Glander)\n\nI cannot think of a Tribeca title that was more trippy this year than Boys Go to Jupiter. This is yet another coming-of-age film, but one that features a minimalist animation style that was definitely odd to see on a big screen but still felt lively and playful. It’s got a real quirky sense of humor that consistently made me laugh, an enjoyable set of characters (even some creatures), and a soundtrack full of some catchy earworms. Yes, this one is a little slight and I don’t know if it entirely justifies its runtime, but I had quite a bit of fun with this.\n\n3.5/5\n\n3. Kneecap (dir. Rich Peppiatt)\n\nSpeaking of movies with a banger soundtrack, next up is Kneecap. This film won the NEXT award at Sundance and I went into it really knowing nothing about it. I hadn’t listened to a single track from the titular band nor did I know they were actually a real band or anything about their story. I didn’t even know that the band members play themselves in this movie. I had a great time with this, a highly energetic film that’s got a sick style to it and it was fascinating to hear their music and the commentary behind it all. And yes, I started listening to Kneecap since watching the movie nearly two weeks ago.\n\n3.5/5\n\n2. Sacramento (dir. Michael Angarano)\n\nSacramento was one of my most anticipated titles of Tribeca and it did not disappoint one bit. Michael Angarano’s film is laugh-out-loud funny almost from beginning to end and has a tremendous amount of heart. His dynamic with Michael Cera on screen is very entertaining as they, along with Kristen Stewart and Maya Erskine, have impeccable comedic timing. The one drawback against the film is that it takes a detour in the third act that stumbles the pacing and nearly derails the development of one of its characters, but it quickly gets back on track and sticks the landing. I really enjoyed this one.\n\n3.5/5\n\n1. Rent Free (dir. Fernando Andrés)\n\nEasily my favorite film of Tribeca is one that you might not have even heard of. Rent Free is such a pleasant surprise, thriving off of the excellent performances from David Treviño and Jacob Roberts and a very clever screenplay by director Fernando Andrés and Tyler Rugh. It’s a funny and authentic look into the financial hardships of these two friends as they not only navigate their living situation but also grapple with their sexuality and their life goals. A nice little gem that I hope finds an audience.\n\n4/5\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my ranking of this year’s Tribeca Festival titles! The fall festivals are right around the corner and I am greatly anticipating going to the Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival later this year. My next piece will be going over a number of major films coming out in the second half of the year and predicting where they might show up during festival season.\n\nFor more of my thoughts on the latest in film, please follow me on Twitter and Letterboxd.\n\nThis year’s Cannes Film Festival has just concluded. Even though I myself was not in attendance, it has been a lot of fun diving into the reception of all the movies that screened. It played out very differently from how I anticipated, particularly in how back-loaded the festival was in terms of high quality titles, but even the films that had disappointing reception still garnered a lot of interesting chatter. I thought that I would recap Cannes while also updating my 2025 Oscars predictions. I will first talk about the prize winners at this year’s festival before I touch upon the most notable titles that were buzzed about as potential awards contenders prior to the fest’s start as well as those that gained traction after they screened. After that, I will discuss some significant developments since the last Oscars predictions I posted back in March before finally revealing my updated predictions. Let’s get started!\n\nIn what is becoming a historic run, NEON won the Palme d’Or for the fifth time in a row with Sean Baker’s latest film Anora. I had very high expectations for this as someone who loves Baker’s work like Tangerine and especially The Florida Project, however I did not anticipate that it would be a contender to win the top prize at Cannes and instantly become an Oscars hopeful. NEON’s last four Palme d’Or-winning films were Anatomy of a Fall, Triangle of Sadness, Titane, and Parasite, three of which went on to be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, with Parasite winning all three. I am thrilled to see Baker get his moment in the spotlight alongside his lead actress Mikey Madison. Anora got rave reviews across the board, a wave of praise that was welcome to see since at the time when it premiered, it was the first title of Cannes to garner unanimous acclaim after several films received reviews that ranged anywhere from generally positive to harshly negative. With the film winning the top award of the festival, it has immediately catapulted into the Oscars conversation.\n\nAs for the other awards, the Grand Prix went to Payal Kapadia’s All We Imagine As Light, a film that screened late during the festival and was side-by-side with Anora as perhaps the most acclaimed film of Cannes. Janus Films picked up the US distribution rights and I am eager to see it later this year. The Jury Prize and Best Actress award both went to Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez, with the Actress prize being shared between the film’s ensemble consisting of Karla Sofía Gascón, Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz. This one seemed like a pretty big crowdpleaser which got picked up by Netflix so perhaps they will mount an awards campaign either for the film itself or for its cast, notably Gascón and Saldaña. The Best Actor award went to Jesse Plemons for Yorgos Lanthimos’s Kinds of Kindness. Reception to the film was really solid, but it appears that your enjoyment will depend on if you prefer his darker films like The Lobster, Dogtooth, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer or if you prefer his extravagant collaborations with Tony McNamara with The Favourite and Poor Things. I happen to love both modes of Lanthimos so I anticipate that I will be an enthusiastic fan. Best Director went to Miguel Gomes for Grand Tour, a film that seemed to get mostly positive reviews, although it left some audience members cold. Coralie Fargeat won the Best Screenplay prize for one of the buzziest titles of Cannes, The Substance. This body-horror satire got some of the most intense discourse of the festival from emphatic praise to vehement rage. Even so, most critics seemed to be raving about the film which will be coming out in September from MUBI.\n\nPerhaps the most notable thing that happened at Cannes was the screening for The Seed of the Sacred Fig. The director Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran after receiving a heinous eight-year prison sentence along with his belongings being confiscated and flogging, all in response to his courageous activism through this film. He managed to make it to Cannes to attend the premiere for which he got a standing ovation both as he entered the theater and once the screening was over. Sacred Fig was met with extremely positive reviews with many deeming it to be the immediate favorite to win the Palme d’Or. Hell, NEON even bought the distribution rights so if it did win, it also would have continued the studio’s winning streak. While it may not have won any of the prizes mentioned before, the jury did give Rasoulof a special award for his screenplay, seemingly to acknowledge his cinematic accomplishment along with his titanic perseverance voyaging to the festival.\n\nOutside of the Cannes award winners, we have a few movies that were tipped to be Oscar contenders going into the festival that had mixed results. Probably the most acclaimed film of this batch was George Miller’s highly anticipated Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, which just opened in theaters this Memorial Day weekend after playing Out of Competition at Cannes. While not everybody was as blown away by this prequel as they were with Mad Max: Fury Road, those that were on board had a blast, myself included. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office, although I do believe that it has some awards prospects in the technical categories as well as an outside shot in Best Supporting Actor for a career-best performance from Chris Hemsworth. Next is Andrea Arnold’s Bird which also had a mixture of some people feeling cold watching it while others were deeply moved. It sounds like a movie right up my alley and I cannot wait to see it. MUBI picked up the rights to that one. Parthenope is the latest film from Paolo Sorrentino which got picked up by A24 before the start of the festival. I took this to mean that it could be a strong contender for the Palme, but unfortunately reception was mostly negative, although some praised the cinematography and lead performance from Celeste Dalla Porta. Michel Hazanavicius premiered his film The Most Precious of Cargoes, the first animated film to play In Competition since 2008’s Waltz with Bashir. However, it appears that reviews were mixed and that festival attendees were more taken by Flow from the Un Certain Regard section, tipping that as a potential Best Animated Feature contender.\n\nTwo final films to discuss from the lineup. First up, lets talk about the “megaflopolis” in the room. In my last Oscar predictions, I mentioned that I had been skeptical of Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, not only its awards prospects but more importantly the film’s quality, but I was swayed at the 11th hour by first reports of an internal screening of the film going very well. As it turned out, I should have taken that first report with a grain of salt because literal days after I posted my predictions, word got out that buyer screenings had gone horribly and that Coppola was struggling to find a US distributor. So even before the festival began, I was regretting including the film in my predictions down the ballot. After it premiered, I extra regret it because while some cinephiles are taken by the bold swings and are just happy to see a new movie from a cinematic legend, it appears that both those who love and hate Megalopolis agree on one thing: it ain’t touching the Oscars. Even many of the positive reviews seem to stem from enjoying it on a “so-bad-it’s-good” level. Many critics absolutely hated it. As of writing this, there is still no US distributor on the film even though some international markets have picked it up and IMAX seems to be committed to doing a limited run in the US whether it gets distribution or not.\n\nSpeaking of controversial films that have no US distribution, the last Cannes film that I will discuss is Ali Abbasi’s Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice. This being an election year with Trump at the forefront of the conversation, plenty of eyes were on this film, for better or worse. Abbasi was an interesting director for this project because this seems so different from his previous two films, Border and Holy Spider. While both of those movies were well received to varying degrees, I happen to not be a fan of either of them so my expectations were low for this. Many people had this in their Best Picture predictions going into Cannes and sure enough, this was another film that garnered mixed reviews. Some seemed to be taken by the performances by Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong as well as the different approach to directing a biopic. Others criticized it for being a surface-level exploration of how Trump came to be and thought that, especially given the timing of this film, it was criticized for being low hanging fruit that preaches to the choir rather than having anything interesting to say. Controversy sparked almost immediately when Trump’s legal team sent a cease and desist letter in an attempt to bar the movie from being released due to the monstrous acts it depicts him committing in the film. Sure enough, it still has no distributor. I still stand by my thoughts last time that I think, no matter what press it gets, that The Apprentice will fall short during awards season in large part due to an exhausting election cycle. Now it can just add to its baggage that it’s a mixed bag as a movie on its own terms.\n\nAs for outside of Cannes, we had some other notable developments. One of the biggest is that Searchlight announced that Tina Mabry’s The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat has now been confirmed to be a Hulu release, ejecting it from the Oscars race altogether. I struggled finding a Searchlight contender to put in my predictions last time and hedged my bets on this one. Now, I am going to wait an see what emerges from the studio’s slate later this year before I put one of their films in my top 10 predictions, although so far I am debating between Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch and Jesse Eisenberg’s A Real Pain. Another development was that my swing predicting Audrey Diwan’s Emmanuelle as this year’s international Best Picture contender was a big miss since it was not only absent from the Cannes lineup entirely, but was recently announced to world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in late September, meaning that it will also skip Venice, Telluride, and TIFF. So now it seems abundantly clear that it will not be Diwan’s ticket to the Oscars. Hopefully her next film will get her into the conversation. We had the trailer drop for Joker: Folie à Deux which got a lot of attention. I still remain apprehensive that it will repeat the overwhelming awards success of its predecessor, but I could see it either performing on par with another superhero sequel to a Best Picture nominee, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nLuca Guadagnino has Queer on the horizon possibly at Venice, but last month he also shook the film world with Challengers which I currently believe is the best film of the year. With the critical success of that film along with its solid box office numbers, that could manifest in boosting the awards prospects for Queer if that film similarly delivers as a representation of a great year for Guadagnino and his returning crew, or perhaps in awards recognition for Challengers itself. I also still feel great about my prediction last time that Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door will be ready for release this year as it has now finished shooting and has entered post-production. Filming lasted a little longer than his last feature Parallel Mothers so perhaps it might be cutting it close for Venice, but I could see it show up at TIFF or NYFF. RaMell Ross’s The Nickel Boys was given a prime October limited release date by Amazon MGM, suggesting that it will be making the rounds at the festival circuit. I have a feeling that is going to be a very hot ticket at whatever festivals it appears at. Many believed that NEON was going to heavily push Joshua Oppenheimer’s The End and while they may still go through with a hefty push for that film, I now struggle even more to see a path for that film in this awards season since their hands are full with both Anora and The Seed of the Sacred Fig. They have never gotten more than one film into Best Picture in a single year so for The End to break out, that would mean that NEON would have to successfully pull off getting *three* Best Picture nominations this year and I just don’t see it. And last but not least, just for fun, I added Twisters as a longshot possibility if it takes the summer movie season by storm… no pun intended.\n\nUpdates are going to go dark again soon as we will likely not have any major news on potential awards contenders until the fall festivals announce their lineups in late-June/early-July. Very shortly, I will be sharing my predictions for some titles I anticipate will show up at Venice, Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF. That will likely come sometime in mid-June. The rankings in each graphic were included with the help of the screengrab feature from Brother Bro’s Award Expert app, an incredibly useful tool for predictions that I highly recommend that people download on iOS and Android.

Last week, I reviewed my predictions to see how the Oscars panned out compared to what I predicted. So let’s reset the clock and start from the beginning again. Like last year, this is just for fun. I put a lot of thought into what films I have my eye on this year, but I am absolutely certain that things will drastically shake up as we start seeing these films and discovering titles that weren’t even on our radar at this time. At this time last year, the vast majority of people had no idea that Anatomy of a Fall or American Fiction would be Best Picture nominees. So I am excited to see how these predictions evolve and change throughout the year. Also, the rankings included in each graphic were included with the help of the screengrab feature from Brother Bro’s Award Expert app, an incredibly useful tool for predictions that I highly recommend that people download on iOS and Android. With that down, time for predicting!\n\nThe top two films I have in Best Picture seem to be a consensus top two among people making early predictions since they are the two highest profile films that people have actually seen. Most people are predicting Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two as the early frontrunner for Best Picture, understandably so as Villeneuve exceeded expectations, surpassing the quality of the first on every level. I think it is fair to consider that the film can match the awards success of its predecessor and add a Best Director nomination this time. I am taking that approach right now until we have a firmer grasp on what the slate looks like later in the year and reassess how crowded each category is and see if Dune: Part Two can break through the competition. But right now, I feel more confident in placing Greg Kwedar’s Sing Sing in my #1 slot for Best Picture. I saw this movie at the TIFF world premiere last year and it ranked among the very best films I saw at the festival. A tremendous, life-affirming film that shines through its exceptional ensemble cast mostly comprised of former members of the RTA theater troupe that the film is based on and led by a career-best Colman Domingo. When thinking about the types of movies that are win-competitive in Best Picture, they almost always win either an acting prize, a screenplay prize, or both. Right now, I think both the phenomenal screenplay and the performances from Domingo and Clarence Maclin have the potential to win Oscars depending on competition. Unlike A24’s indie darling Past Lives from last year, I think that Sing Sing has higher potential for nominations across the board.\n\nWe have a slew of major titles coming out this year that are high on everyone’s radar, namely Steve McQueen’s Blitz and Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis. Starting with the latter, I was ready to dismiss this as yet another case like Ferrari and House of Gucci where an old school, legendary filmmaker has a film that on paper seems too big to fail that manages to fail spectacularly. And given how long it has been since Coppola has made a presence at the Oscars with any of his films, I figured that this would be a passion project that goes outside the creator’s grasps. But then last night, reports came out that a screening of the film with industry buyers, filmmakers, and very limited press played to a very enthusiastic response. So now, I have to consider the opposite narrative, where a filmmaker raises the money to finally fund his passion project and delivers his best film in decades. That is too juicy to pass up. So even though I had my reservations at first, I have now taken a 180 and put Megalopolis in my predictions down the ballot. As for Blitz, I think this makes sense as McQueen’s grand return to the Academy Awards after his Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave, but I am also curious to see how it performs considering that was his only Oscars success.\n\nThere are a number of major titles that I am not predicting for Best Picture that seem to be getting a lot of early traction. The biggest one is probably Todd Phillips’s Joker: Folie à Deux. The first Joker film was the nomination leader in its year and won two Oscars for Best Actor and Best Original Score. The sequel seems to be taking a lot of big, interesting swings, especially with being a jukebox musical and casting Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. I find myself fascinated by this movie, but I have a feeling that it will be one of the biggest talking points of the year that doesn’t get in at the end of the day. We already have Dune: Part Two as a high-profile sequel nearly guaranteed a Best Picture nomination and I doubt that Warner Brothers is going to split their resources to try to get two blockbuster sequels into Best Picture and risk cannibalizing each other. Two other franchise films that I am not putting into Best Picture are George Miller’s Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2. I cannot wait for Furiosa and I think it will get some nominations, but not as many as Fury Road. Gladiator 2 I think is going to suffer from the same problem as most other Ridley Scott films from the past couple decades and be a massive misfire.\n\nI came close to predicting Pablo Larraín’s Maria, especially due to feeling confident in its Best Actress potential for Angelina Jolie and Best Cinematography, but I think it is going to fall just short like Jackie did. Edward Berger’s Conclave was hard not to include because it seems to be Focus Features’s top player this far out, but I have become wary of predicting the follow-up feature to a director’s first time at the Oscars and even though All Quiet on the Western Front was a huge success, that doesn’t mean that his next film is a guaranteed hit either. The teaser for Yorgos Lanthimos’s Kinds of Kindness got me psyched and I want to believe that it can be a Best Picture nominee, but this looks to be closer in line with The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer so I am going to remain cautious about its chances until it screens. A lot of people are extremely confident in Ali Abbasi’s The Apprentice, understandably so, but I cannot get myself to predict a movie about Donald Trump to be nominated for Best Picture in what is sure to be an exhausting election year where he is front and center.\n\nI settled on the following films to fill out my first Best Picture predictions: Audrey Diwan’s Emmanuelle, Robert Zemeckis’s Here, RaMell Ross’s The Nickel Boys, Luca Guadagnino’s Queer, Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door, and Tina Mabry’s The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat. There is a question mark on whether Almodóvar’s film will be ready by the end of the year as it is shooting right now, but his past few films show that his productions move by very quickly. For example, his last feature, Parallel Mothers, shot in March-April 2021 and was ready to premiere in Venice in the beginning of September that year. This is his first English-language feature film and I suspect that it could break through in a big way at the Oscars this year, especially with stars like Tilda Swinton, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro attached. Guadagnino found awards success with Call Me By Your Name, but his filmmaking is an acquired taste. That being said, I will take the risk and believe that Queer will mark his return and that it might finally bring Daniel Craig into the conversation of Best Actor. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor stars in both The Nickel Boys and The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat and I think both films could be festival favorites, one with an emotionally devastating story that can deeply resonate with audiences, and the other a heartwarming crowdpleaser. The latter film has rumors that it might be going to Hulu through Searchlight, but to my knowledge that stems from Wikipedia rather than an official studio source.\n\nI finally watched Audrey Diwan’s last film, Happening, this week and found it to be one of the most harrowing films I had seen in years, finding a delicate balance between tackling its subject matter of abortion with visceral authenticity and a delicate sensitivity. I think people are underestimating her film Emmanuelle. I know that the Oscars tend to look the other way with more risqué sexual content unless from a filmmaker that they already love, but this has the potential to be a moving portrait of female sexual liberation that reclaims and recontextualizes the perception that the source material served only as pornography, evidenced by the erotic film franchise that it spawned. That same delicate hand that made Happening into such a triumph, and a Golden Lion winner at Venice, could create something really special that speaks to a lot of people this year. Who knows, maybe it can be this year’s annual NEON Palme d’Or winner at Cannes.\n\nEasily the biggest WTF pick in my Best Picture predictions is Here. The recent slate of Robert Zemeckis films that, aside from the odd good film here or there, range from bad to worse. So why do I have it in Best Picture? Simply, it’s Eric Roth writing the screenplay. His last five films have all been nominated for Best Picture, even a movie as poorly received and frankly disastrous as Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. The film also reunites Zemeckis with Roth who wrote his Best Picture winner Forrest Gump, along with that film’s lead stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, and even its composer Alan Silvestri. I also realized that I was feeling far too comfortable with the picks I was making in my predictions and I thought I should go for one that makes me feel a bit uneasy. This could so easily flop, but for some reason I have a feeling that this could be one of those high risk-high reward predictions that could be fun to try out early in the year and see if it pays off later.\n\nThere are so many more films that I haven’t even discussed that I have my eye out for. Films like Joshua Oppenheimer’s The End, Andrea Arnold’s Bird, Malcolm Washington’s The Piano Lesson, David Lowery’s Mother Mary, Clint Eastwood’s Juror No. 2, Robert Eggers’s Nosferatu, Duke Johnson’s The Actor, and so many more. I am also extremely excited to find out about titles that I hadn’t even heard of that come out of the film festivals. This year seems to have such a wide spectrum of contenders with less heavy hitters than we had at this point last year. I cannot wait to see what changes over the next several months and to see all of these films for myself.
