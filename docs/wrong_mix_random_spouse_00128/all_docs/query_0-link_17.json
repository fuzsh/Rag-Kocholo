        "meta_description": "Hobbled by studio cuts and ignored at the box office, Martin Scorsese's New York, New York was conceived as a tribute to \"event\" movies like Cukor's A Star is Born—musical epics that leaned on complex characterizations as much as a good showstopper. Robert De Niro flexes his acting chops as a volatile jazz musician and Liza Minnelli rattles the rafters with one crowd pleaser after another—including, of course, the title song. The studio cuts and other deleted scenes were eventually restored in 1981—along with much of the film's original luster.",
