The first was interview the Duplass family for their film \"Oh, Christmas Tree.\"\n\nThis 11 minute short film was shot in their cabin in upstate NY. It truly was a family affair, written by Mark Duplass to star in with his daughter Ora Duplass, and directed by Katie Aselton, Mark's wife and Ora's mom.\n\nI asked them a couple of questions about shooting this short film and working together. It was Ora's first time in a film, so I asked her about her preparation for this role and whether it felt performative to ask with her Dad.\n\nI also asked about advice for filmmakers. I truly found this particular short very inspiring. They shot this as a family, with only one extra person to record sound.\n\nI was able to tie in a fun question at the end!\n\nSynopsis: Itâs been a bit of a year for 16 year-old Claire and her father Ben. All they really want to do is put it behind them. But Christmas is here and their silly holiday traditions are staring them dead in the face, practically taunting these\n\ntwo to give them a try after all theyâve been through. This short film by the Duplass family is as much an examination of mental health as it is an attempt to explore the emotional minefield of ever-shifting family dynamics.\n\nMark Duplass - Mark is a filmmaker, actor, writer and musician. His credits include Bombshell, Safety Not Guaranteed, Tammy, The Mindy Project, and Charlie \"Chip\" Black on The Morning Show.
