        "text": "He’s attracted some of Hollywood’s most-celebrated auteurs over the past half-decade, from Scorsese and Spielberg to Charlie Kaufman and, now, with The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion. But Jesse Plemons is still surprised, nevertheless, when anyone knows who he is. “I’ve noticed fewer people refer to me as Meth Damon,” he says to GQ, asked of his recent ascent, his voice low and considered, punctuated by a chuckle. “Maybe a few more people know my actual name.” Give it a year — and his upcoming lead role in Scorsese’s latest, Killers of the Flower Moon, with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio — and one suspects that “few” will become “a lot”. The film, another true-crime epic, is based on a non-fiction book of the same name, about a major FBI investigation into a series of murders in Osage County, Oklahoma, in the 1920s. DiCaprio was originally lined up to play its hero, FBI agent Tom White, but after a reshuffle, Plemons found himself taking on that mantle, and he doesn't take it lightly. “He almost has this otherworldly level of fairness and justice.\"\n\nIt’s a marked evolution for the 33-year-old actor who was once best known for a beloved part in Friday Night Lights. Fans of prestige television — from Breaking Bad to Black Mirror — have long been cognisant of talents. His film breakthrough came in 2016 with a starring role in Sundance hit Other People; before 2020’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Kaufman’s typically meta psychodrama, reaffirmed his leading-man bona fides. Between them came a conveyor belt of supporting roles in Oscar-nominated prestige pictures, from Spielberg’s political thriller The Post to Scorsese’s gargantuan mob epic The Irishman.\n\nFar from showy, Plemons is the image of restraint. He has remarkable verisimilitude: he could well be a day player relegated to the background, a trait that reportedly attracted Kaufman to him in the first place. Though he has frequently played antagonists, he seldom imbues them with theatrical, typified villainy. His characters are full-bodied, sympathetic and frequently vulnerable, no matter how morally grey they might be.\n\nBut the jewel in Plemons’ 2021 crown is Campion’s Oscar-tipped latest, in which he plays George Burbank: a humble man caught in the crossfire between his brash, intemperate brother (Benedict Cumberbatch) and wife Rose, played by Kirsten Dunst, his real-life partner. Not only is Plemons playing against his antagonistic type in The Power of the Dog, it stands as his best display to date of the earnest credibility that has won the regard of so many directorial greats. Not that he’s thinking about them, of course.\n\nYou were in New Zealand shooting The Power of the Dog when Covid hit. What was it like being locked down there?\n\nI mean, on the one hand, we felt ridiculously fortunate, because it wasn’t nearly as dire over there as it was in Los Angeles at the time – and most other places. But it did eventually get to the point where we had to shut down. And you know, it was really nice being in a place that felt safer, but at the same time, there was so much happening in the States. So it was very strange to be away, with all of the upheaval that was happening – social justice, protests, and everything. It was surreal in many ways.\n\nDid you continue shooting?\n\nWe were there for a month, just because we were so terrified of flying with our two-year-old who touches everything, puts his hands in his mouth, puts his hands in our mouths. So we stayed for about a month until we felt a little safer to fly home, then flew back, because at that point, everything was speculation. We weren’t sure it was going to be a month and a half until we were up and shooting again, or, you know, six months. In the period of time we were back [in LA], New Zealand eliminated the virus and allowed us back in. We stayed in the government-approved quarantine facility, which is an experience with a toddler.\n\nYou’re a two-time dad as of September. How does that feel?\n\nIt’s so, so… wild, and wonderful to see our eldest son with him, you know. It’s hard to put into words, other than just like very, very cheesy words. But it’s so beautiful, and he’s been so understanding, with us dividing our attention. He had a few little slip-ups, but that’s to be expected, you know? And yeah, our little guy – or little, very big guy.\n\nKirsten described him as the “Big Kahuna” in another interview.\n\nIt’s an apt nickname. But he’s so sweet, and yeah, it’s the best.\n\nYou’ve said that with I’m Thinking of Ending Things, you were surprised that Charlie Kaufman knew who you were, let alone asked you to audition. So how was it having Jane Campion knock on your door?\n\nThat’s the weird and amazing thing about what we do: you’re twiddling your thumbs one day and the next, everything changes. My dad has a pretty great outlook on what I do, and always says “you never know who’s watching,” and that has definitely proved to be true. It just feels like it falls from the sky, and all of sudden, everything changes. I had no idea that I was on Jane’s radar at all, you know?\n\nYou say you were surprised to be on Jane’s radar. But surely, after being the lead in a Charlie Kaufman film, and in The Irishman with Scorsese, you are cognisant of the fact that other directors are going to know who you are.\n\n[Laughs.] Well, I don’t really think about it like that. When I shoot something, I don’t think about it coming out, really, until I’m talking to you, you know. It’s such an intense, isolated experience that requires all of your focus and the rest of the world, the rest of your life, kinda goes on pause for a little bit. And then you finish something and it’s such a release. And it always takes such a long time that I don’t spend much time thinking about it. And it’s somehow just easier to be pleasantly surprised, rather than sitting around wondering who might be watching it, or what’s to come.\n\nBut you have gone from being a rising TV star to being one of the leads in another Scorsese film. Are you increasingly conscious of celebrity?\n\nI’ve noticed that fewer people refer to me as 'Meth Damon'. Maybe a few more people know my actual name. There’s something where it’s so surreal, and sort of the apex of what I had hoped for – these are the types of parts and projects I had hoped to be a part of starting out. I don’t know, if you think about it too much you can sort of spin yourself out. It’s not even that I try not to think about, OK, where am I now at the scale of my career or celebrity. It’s just I’ve had the most success, at least in the way I navigate through all of this, in just not focusing on it, and just attempting to be present in surreal circumstances, and attempting to just enjoy it all. It’s cliche to say, but the only thing I’m obsessive about is the work, and continuing to get better, and play parts that are exciting, that I haven’t done before. I can’t keep track, I guess I choose not to.\n\nWhere in the work do you derive most of your enjoyment? What do you find most fulfilling?\n\nThe days where the stars align, and you fully get out of your own way, and are able to just play, you know, and have fun with the other actor. There’s a scene in the Scorsese film [Killers of the Flower Moon] — I had a scene with De Niro, and you know, I’d worked with him on The Irishman. But I was definitely sort of a lackey in that film, and was just trying to keep it together on that. It was a good scene, and I knew it was gonna be my only one-on-one scene with him, and I so desperately wanted to be able to fully relax and be present. You have your ideas of what a scene could be, but then what’s the most exciting to me is when something happens that takes it to a new place or in a new direction, and you discover something that you can only discover by being fully planted in the moment. What’s most exciting is just throwing it back and forth with another actor.\n\nAnd it must be thrilling for that experience to be with De Niro, of all people.\n\nYeah, it’s so wild. But you know, if you can get over the fact that you’re in a scene with one of the greatest actors of all time, he’s so good that it almost makes it easier, all you have to do is pay attention to what he’s doing.\n\nWhat are the most striking differences between working with, say, Kaufman and Campion?\n\nJust completely different sensibilities and styles and voices. The rehearsal process with Jane was something that I really enjoyed, but it’s not done very often anymore. Everything is so rushed now. It doesn’t seem like productions want to spend the money to have more time.\n\nDoes Kaufman rehearse?\n\nWe would’ve loved to, I mean, but we just didn’t have the time or money. We got there maybe five days before we started shooting, and we started with those car scenes. Which were like 11 pages a day, uninterrupted takes. We rehearsed a bit, but because it reads and feels more like a play, it would have been a totally different experience had we had that time. But both of them are just so, so invested, and you never feel like — it’s the same with Marty [Scorsese] — you never feel like it’s directing from above, it feels very collaborative.\n\nYou’ve worked with Kirsten on other projects, but aside from her cameo in the Black Mirror episode “USS Callister”, this is the first thing you’ve worked on together as a couple. How was that?\n\nSo nice, and easy, and comforting. It’s something that we’ve talked about, how back in the day with couples, it used to be something that I think audiences almost looked forward to and accepted more, and now that’s sort of changed. But I first really felt like she was the ideal creative counterpart for me on Fargo. And there’s something kind of inexplicable about why it’s just really easy to work with certain people, but we found that rhythm very quickly on Fargo, and could just remove any ego from any ideas or choices that we made, and were just able to really throw out ideas. And then with this, I think I didn’t realise until we got there that we’d only worked together in these two very specific roles. So I was like, I hope it translates to other characters. I think we rehearsed one time with Jane.\n\nYour dynamic is so organic as a result, I think. Is there anything about Kirsten, as a fellow actor, that you find particularly compelling – especially when you’re opposite her?\n\nThere’s a ferocity that she can tap into – and a sort of wild, very expressive and real… rage is the wrong word, but everything that’s happening inside you, you just see on her face and in her eyes. Like I was saying about working with De Niro, when someone is expressing so much, it makes your job a lot easier because all you have to do is look, and listen, and respond. I think she’s just an incredibly honest, bold performer and can kind of do anything. You know she’s really funny, and really versatile.\n\nI imagine you read the book of Killers of the Flower Moon before you were cast. What jumped out to you about it?\n\nAt least in the States, a lot of people I think like to look at the terrible crimes that were committed against the Native Americans as something that was less sophisticated, you know, and as having happened a long time ago. But the fact that this was 1920, and we’re living in houses with electricity, and driving around in cars, was not that long ago. The level of inhumanity was just really mind-blowing to me. And I was fully prepared to be playing someone that was in on the whole scheme. I found out I was playing Tom White — he almost has this otherworldly level of fairness and justice. I mean, it’s hard to imagine, and even in talking to David Grann briefly, who wrote the book, he really dug trying to find some skeletons in his closet. He just was really sort of a superhero in how fair he was, and how he treated everyone. So it was an experience."
