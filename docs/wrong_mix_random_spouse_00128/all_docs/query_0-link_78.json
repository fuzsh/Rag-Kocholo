Why John Malkovich? I don't know... I thought it was funny. It's hard to explain, but I thought it was funny, but not jokey. Because [John Malkovich] is a serious actor, he is a great actor, but there is something odd about him and there is something behind his eyes that you can't see. And I thought that was a good person for this. And then I think his name is perfect for the title... when we trying to get the movie made... we didn't know if John was going to do it and Spike [Jonze] and I sort of tried to make a list of other possibilities and there are lots of good actors but nobody's name sounded good in the title... so... it was important for that reason. - Kaufman in an interview with Charlie Rose\n\n16. Was John Malkovich keen? Not to begin with. Apparently Malkovich liked the script but did not think he would suit the lead role and offered to produce the film with a different title actor. Kaufman refused and continued to approach Malkovich about is periodically. After many years Malkovich was eventually worn down and agreed to star. Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that this was Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced: Either the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character."
