        "text": "Only a little bit, genuinely. I don’t know, it just feels like an end of just this really important era of filmmaking, and film loving, and film watching, where for a time, for a brief 20-year span, you could get almost any piece of media that had been released - you could find it on disk, and you could find it someplace and you could rent it. You didn’t have to worry about were the rights expired or not, who has ownership, is it in a vault or not? It was probably released at some point, and if it was out there, you could find a way to source it, and Netflix had a great catalog for that. And what makes me sad is that there are so many titles, like thousands upon thousands of titles that have never been brought to streaming, either legally, or to buy in any way shape or form that are not available to stream, or not available to buy digitally, that are just gone in vaults… While billionaires decide how they can manipulate various IP agreements to suck every single cent out of what was supposed to be art. Never forget the business part of show business. But there was this moment of time where you could get everything. And now that that moment is gone, because there’s so many amazing films and TV shows and other things that are just not available, I feel like we’ve lost something. It feels like when the video store started to close, and I just… I don’t know, it makes me sad.\n\n…this is what really kills me about the death of physical media, and especially the death of some of this Netflix stuff, is that there are amazing audio commentaries - not all of them; some of them, especially once they started having to churn out so many DVDs, and you would see – the people would record them before the film was even released. You know, they were bad. But there were so many amazing director commentaries, and commentary tracks from other people involved in the film… This isn’t a thing that the kids today know about, and that makes me so sad, because as someone who was in high school during kind of this golden era, and then in college - I’m not even joking when I say this, I think that I got more of a film education in some cases listening to those commentaries that I did from film school.\n\nYeah, that’s the thing, you always had your stand-outs, like the Criterion Collection, who have always been known… I mean, they go back to the laserdisc era, which was before my time… But some of the best early DVDs especially were just laserdisc ports. And even today, some of the best – like, the commentary tracks and extras are from the laserdisc era. But Criterion always did really good job with that stuff. And some studios would do a really good job, too. But yeah, then I think it became a marketing thing. And then I think you’re right, we all kind of became blind to it, because it just became promotional. It wasn’t about the treat, it was about “Okay, let me advertise this other upcoming thing to you. Let me sell you something.”\n\nThat was the thing. And also, there’s less of an incentive for the studios to make them, because they’re like “Okay, well, people will stream it without or without it.” Once they can get data on how many people are listening to these things and how many people are watching these things… This is a good software analogy, too - on the one hand, it’s really great to get that telemetry, because you know what’s being used. On the other hand, it can kind of be a curse a little bit, because there are these things that might only be used by a certain subset of users, but are really beloved. And if you over index on data, which Netflix famously does do, I think you miss out on that.\n\nThey even had for a period of time - and I don’t know if they’re still available… I’ve found a way to rip some of them at some at one point, but it was difficult… But some of the Netflix original series, they had some audio commentary tracks, that Netflix had. I remember for the pilot of House of Cards, the director of that pilot episode did a really good commentary track, and they had some commentary tracks I think for some of the arrested development stuff when that came out. But then over time that sort of thing disappears, and you have this rot, and this loss of this great commentary… I mean, it might not be that important, but it’s just – you know, seeing how something was done… And people cared enough to share the process of how it was made.\n\nLike, it’s not gonna appeal to everyone, but to the real lovers out there, it does. And for me - I mean, the reason I get so romantic about the DVD era is, as I said, I always loved movies as a kid… But there were only so many of them you could get. Mot everything was available on home video. And tapes were expensive and bulky… And then suddenly, we had this way where everything, things that had been out of print for years, for decades, it was just available. And I felt like I had this whole world open up to me, both seeing films I’d never seen before, or couldn’t see, but also being able to find out these tidbits about how it was done. And it makes me sad that 15-year-old Christina in the future, living in 2023, wouldn’t have that same access. Because it’s not there the same way. It’s just not.\n\nRight. They just wanted to get it. No, you’re dead on. It’s easy for everybody to believe that wide broadband is everywhere, but it’s not… And that last mile thing, especially rural internet, especially in the United States, is a real problem. But it’s also a problem in parts of the world that are harder to get to, like Australia and New Zealand, where they’re just now starting to get fiber-like speeds… And yeah, these things - it’s a lot to process. I mean, this is one of the reasons why I think Microsoft was smart… And Sony as well, but they were smart to still have the disc era for this last generation of consoles, even though it would have been very easy to just go digital-only… Because in some of those cases you’re talking about titles that - you know, one title might take up half of your available memory, downloading patches and whatnot… But if you live someplace where your internet is not really, really great, you’re not gonna be able to play that game, let alone do online multiplayer.\n\nSo what happened was – yeah, Reed Hastings had a rare failure where he decided that they were going to split the DVD and the streaming services, and they were going to call the new thing Qwikster. And this was in October of 2011… And I think that it lasted like less than a week, because people were so outraged in 2011 by the idea of splitting the by-mail and the streaming service. They were gonna split it into two different services, and they were like “No, we can’t do this.” There was wide outrage. The name was derided, because it was spelled Qwikster, so it was terrible naming as well.\n\nSo it was announced in September of 2011, and then it was canceled in October of 2011. But it was just a complete cluster of epic proportions. People were so upset… And so I think that that’s one of the reasons they probably held off on getting rid of this for a long time… Because when they did finally split the two businesses - like I said, I was paying for a while, and then they just slowly just like stopped charging me, because it wasn’t renting out discs anymore… And I forgot about it. And then I thought for a while, I was like “Well, maybe I should resubscribe…” And I was like “Christina, you don’t ever take any discs out. You just buy them. If you can find it, you just buy it.” So I didn’t.\n\n…which was down from where it was. Redbox was an interesting thing. Like, a lot of people blame Netflix for the death of Blockbuster… I actually think it was Redbox more than Netflix. Netflix definitely helped speed it up, because Blockbuster was bloated, and had a bad customer service thing and whatnot. But then they did introduce online ordering and whatnot in the early 2000s, because I used to use it and abuse their system. I would play both of them off against one another… And Blockbuster also had video games that you could rent. And you could return it to like a local store, but they just didn’t have the logistics engine the way that Netflix did. But I really think it was Redbox that kind of cemented the death of Blockbuster, because to your point, it was so much more convenient. You could just drive up and pick up a movie and grab it and go. And the same thing to rent it, and it was a buck. It was like “Okay, I just want to watch this and go. I don’t care.” And that was I think in that era when, again, maybe the extra features and things didn’t matter. We’re almost at streaming. Streaming is almost a reality. We’re not quite there, and this is the great kind of perfect thing to tie this over in the middle.\n\nYeah. The box art mattered, right? Like, what was on the back of the – the description, all that stuff mattered, because you didn’t know; you’d have to talk to the guy at the store… We had blockbusters and stuff, but my home video store was actually called Home Video, and it was like this two-story, huge video store, and they had like a marionette Pinocchio, I remember that. And they had a massive collection of stuff. Like, stuff that you couldn’t get anywhere else. And they had video games, too. But they had this promo they started - it was like five movies, for $5, for five nights, if it was not a new release. And they would have like a seven, for seven, for seven.\n\n[ ] And when my mom was in graduate school, she would take me to Home Video during the summers, and I would get a bunch of Nintendo and Super-Nintendo games, and I would get a bunch of VHS tapes. And that’s what I would do while she was in graduate school during the days. I would amuse myself by watching the collected works of Alfred Hitchcock, and Martin Scorsese, and Francis Ford Coppola. And I’m like nine; I’m like nine or ten at this point.\n\nNo, I was super-into it. Because I would get into something, and I would talk – but that’s the thing, though… You’d talk to the video store guys… And I was a very small nine-year-old. At nine, I probably looked six. So I’m sure that they thought it was very odd that they’re having these high-level conversations about movies with someone who looks like she’s six years old. But they would give you advice, because that’s what they did all day. It was like the movie clerks, it was that sort of thing, where – just these guys spending all day talking about movies with customers, and you would get suggestions for things. They’d say, “Oh, well, you liked this. You should watch this.” And I would go “Oh, I liked this. Let me get all the movies by this director.” And what would you do? There was like an almanac, some sort of book that someone had, of like all sorts of movie reviews… I remember that’s what I would use as my proto IMDb to find out what were all the movies directed by a certain person. And then I would go to the video store and find them all.\n\nOkay, so the company has a really storied history, but basically, they make very high-end movie players and servers for the types of people who have millions of dollars to spend on their home theater system, and will be able to buy the super-expensive Crestron-controlled audio, and lighting, and everything, setups… And basically, these are servers, and many times they are actually server-sized things that can act as a movie player for 4k UHD. And there’s various ways you can get the content imported. But what they used to have, their original product - and they were sued for this - was that they would let you take… It was very user-friendly, and they’d let you take a disk that you owned, and drop it into their system, and it would rip it, and rip everything perfectly, and it would put it in the library, just like a Plex for you, and then you would have it available. And everyone loved it. But they were sued, and they had to change how they worked, to a certain amount. It’s amazing that they’re still in business… I’m very happy for them.\n\n[ ] You know what - I can just say it now, because enough time has passed… But I had a meeting with the then head of Warner Brothers home entertainment, probably a decade ago; maybe a little bit more than that. And we were talking about some of the issues of around like Vudu, and Movies Anywhere, Disney’s platform, which at the time was I think called magic key and whatnot… And we were talking about whether or not Warner Brothers was going to sign on or not, and he was talking to me about Collide Escape, and he was like “I love this so much… But we’re suing them, so I can’t tell anybody that I have this.” And the guy who was Kevin Tsujihara, who wound up becoming the president of Warner Brothers Entertainment, like the chairman and CEO of Warner Brothers. He had to resign because of some stuff, but this was maybe two months before he was promoted, and he was talking to me about how everybody in Hollywood who was suing this company, all of the executives had these things in their houses, and were using them. That to me kind of percents the perfect – like the friction point between these two things, where you have people who love this stuff so much, and then you have people who just only see the business goals, and want to make it as difficult as possible for people to do the right thing…\n\nNo. And you know what happened? It went away for a long time when you could stream a lot of stuff, and when streaming was easy. Now, of course, they’re raising prices… Which makes sense. Prices should go up a little bit. I think some of the streaming companies are getting a little ridiculous, but they’re raising prices… And they’re restricting how you can log in with things.\n\nLook, if Netflix wants to enforce not giving your password to 500 different people, I get it. But I pay you for X number of users a month. I pay them whatever the highest amount of money you can pay Netflix is for their 4k account. I should not have to make sure that my Fire TV stick, which I keep in my suitcase and I never take out, because I use it when traveling… I shouldn’t have to connect that to my home network every three months, just so the IP address is the same as where I live, so that you don’t cut off access. When you do things like that, that’s when I’m going to go back to Popcorn Time, and stuff like that. Like, that’s when that happens again.\n\nYeah. It’s strange, because – Uncut Gems is another one. I’ve got to keep putting my disc back in to rewatch this. So I rewatched the movie less even. I get to enjoy the film less, because it’s not competing anymore. It’s unfortunate; it really boils my blood… In particular Uncut Gems; it’s just a scene switch. For whatever reason, it cuts to the other scene quickly, and comes back to the normal flow of the film… But for whatever reason, it happens in Knives Out, it happens in Cabin in the Woods… And it’s just a – I don’t even know how to describe why they would even do it, aside from… You can still rip the film, but it’s just out of order. If that’s on purpose, and not just like a software glitch as a way of MakeMKV getting around the DRM, and that’s an artifact of breaking the DRM… If that’s on purpose, somebody is cruel in those organizations.\n\nIt is… I only did that after – this is like after many, many years of my life dreaming. Like, I didn’t just suddenly be like “Let me just spend all this money doing this.” I started reading Crutchfield magazines at like 10 years old, or whatever. And I learned all about home theater, and gear, and equipment, and channels, and all these different things through Crutchfield. The Crutchfield brand is amazing. I still buy almost everything I can from Crutchfield. My TVs I bought from Crutchfield, most speakers through them… My subs were from Crutchfield… So sometimes you price things out, because like, I’m not gonna spend two grand more when I can get it for a grand less, or whatever. I’m not going to do every possible thing. But I love Crutchfield. They’re always amazing. It’s a great brand. They’re not sponsoring this, of course… Crutchfield.com.\n\nMy kids - so I’ve got a seven-year-old and a three-year-old. And they sit down with me and watch films… Not all things. Like, we’ll watch The Grinch, and like kids stuff. The Super-Mario Brothers movie’s on there… We just got the 4k version of it recently, because we bought it through Apple TV when it first came out. We cannot wait. We watched it in the theater… That was amazing. These kids love that film, and I loved it, because it was just an amazing, amazing version of it. And so we bought it on Apple TV. And then it came out on disk, and then we finally got the 4k version of it. So we have that on Plex now, thankfully. And it’s just so amazing to watch 4k content on a 4k-native laser projector, on a phenomenal screen. That’s not what the show is about, but it was pretty awesome to – and I designed it all. I didn’t obviously design the screen, but like the whole room is - I chose every component, specifically, after many years of research, and what I can afford, and what would fit in the room, and what would make sense, and all that good stuff. But it’s been a labor of love to get to that point, because it takes work.\n\nBreak: [ ]\n\n“We have to be everywhere.” No, when they made that distinction, I was so happy too, because I was somebody who’s like – I mean, the Movies Now service that Disney owns, and a lot of studios participate in, but not all… Not Lionsgate, not Paramount… There are a couple of other smaller ones. It means that your libraries will reflect back on one another. So if you buy it on Google Play, or on Amazon, or on the Microsoft thing, it’ll also be in your iTunes library and vice versa… Which is nice, but there will be a ton of stuff that I would have – obviously, the 4k stuff would all be on iTunes, and there’d be some stuff that’ll only be on iTunes, or Apple TV, whatever… And I was like “Okay, I don’t want to travel with an Apple TV for this stuff. I’m gonna have to find a way to rip this.” And then as you said, when they realized they were a production house too, and they had to have wider distribution, and they brought that to all of the other devices, I was like “Okay, thank you. This is good.”\n\nYeah. Here’s the things I concern myself with… I recall an interview with Matt Damon, talking about the change in the film business, essentially…\n\n[ ]\n\nThe DVD was a huge part of our business, of our revenue stream. And technology has just made that obsolete. The movies that we used to make, you could afford to not make all of your money when it played in the theater, because you knew you had the DVD coming behind the release, and six months later you’d get all a whole other chunk; it would be like reopening the movie almost. And when that went away, that changed the type of movies that we could make. I have to split everything I get with the exhibitor, the people who own the movie theaters… So I would have to make $100 million before I got into profit. The idea of making $100 million on a story about lik this love affair between these two people… Yeah, I love everyone in the movie, but that’s suddenly a massive gamble, in a way that it wasn’t in the 1990s when they were making all those kinds of movies, the kind of movies that I loved, and the kind of movies that were my bread and butter.\n\nAnd you miss out on things. No, I think you’re exactly right. I mean, I would argue that this is one of the reasons why Netflix has stagnated a little bit, is that they do everything from a data-driven perspective, and not from more of an artistic perspective… And so if you just follow the numbers, and you just give everybody the cookie cutter Marvel stuff - that’s great, you can make a lot of money off of it, but where does that leave those small films that could actually grow into something huge? Like, some of the most beloved films of all time took a long time for people to really get to know and love. The Wizard of Oz was not a hit when it was released.\n\n[ ]\n\nYou cursed brat! Look what you’ve done!\n\nBut even though it was taking existing IP, it obviously was also kind of a new thing… And the screenplay is fantastic, and how they were able to thread the needle between being obviously a consumeristic kind of play, but also winking and nodding and kind of making fun of the very thing that is at its core really worked so well. It nailed it. But that film, I think the budget was like maybe 100 million, which two decades ago would have seemed huge, but now is kind of more small. And it’s gone on to be the biggest grosser of the year… And it’s one of those things where if you just saw the pitch, and if it didn’t have Barbie attached to it, if you just saw the pitch of the storyline, I don’t know if that would get greenlit. And that’s disappointing, because obviously, the audience is there for it, right?\n\nA great storyline, right? But again, this is an original story, and studios used to always have the thing – they’re kind of like venture capitalists, where they would be like “Okay, it’s gonna be the one big hit… The five big hits we get a year will pay for everything else”, and that’s just the cost of doing business. And now there’s this expectation that everything has to be the big hit, and you don’t get to take chances. And look, sometimes the smaller films flop and they don’t do anything, and sometimes they wind up having a second or third life, and sometimes they turn out to be The Silence of the Lambs, which was released by a studio in bankruptcy, in March, the worst time of year to release a film… Yeah, it had an Oscar winner attached to it, but the storyline was not something that you would think would sell the audiences, and it goes on to be, at the time, an incredibly high grosser for an R rated film, and wins massive Academy awards, and is considered one of the greatest films of all time. And again, a bankrupt studio put that out.\n\n[ ] There’s a part of the business that you can optimize for, and that makes sense, but there’s some stuff that I think just happens, and you have to take artistic chances on, and that have to be about more than money. And that’s, to me, what has always made movies great, is that there can be room for both. And I worry that we’re getting away from having room for both.\n\nNo, I think you’re exactly right. And it makes me think a lot about how important it is for us to also start archiving these digital things, and to think very seriously about how we make archives of these digital things DRM or not, just because it would be much easier for those things to go away, right? Because there will come a day when there are films or TV shows or other things that are never going to have any sort of physical release. That’s already happened in some cases, but there will come a day when that is going to be more common, and it will be important for us to start to preserve these things digitally. I’ve thought a lot about digital preservation for a long time. I think that’s why organizations like the Internet Archive are so important. Not just the Wayback Machine, but a lot of the work they do… Because there’s so much stuff out there that’s in our culture that only exists in certain formats; old software, and… You can think about like iPhone apps, right? There are whole generations of iPhone apps that we will never have access to again, because they were 32-bit and they ran on old versions of an operating system that you can’t run in a VM anywhere. And there’s not like a library of those IPA files. Some people might have hoarded them, but it’s not like they’re preserved someplace where you can download them all. And that sucks, right? Like you said, your dad could pass down his vinyl collection to you. You could pass down like maybe your video game collection to your kids… But they’re not going to be able to do the same with their kids. And that makes me sad.\n\nI mean, I think it does, but I think that that’s to our detriment, right? Because think about all the things we would have lost if people hadn’t been smart enough to microfiche newspapers, and preserve other records. I mean, even talking about film, one of the coolest things that I’ve ever had the opportunity to do was I got to go to Sony’s facilities where they were doing restoration of old film. And some stuff that they were worried had been lost, and the amount of care and work that go into that preservation, the scanning in every single frame, and then detailing that, and getting that into that 4k quality… There are people who do this work, the archive is out there, and I so appreciate the work they do. I wish that I guess we could, as a culture, maybe have more of a discussion about that. Like, look, I’m not asking to keep the physical media around; I get that it doesn’t make sense from a space level and whatnot. We might have an attachment to it, but I get it. But can we at least keep the permanence of what it represented? Can that still be part of our culture going forward, where at least we have – we can still move forward, but will we still have a legacy, right?\n\nI’m a huge fan of the first one. I wanted to wait till I was in my home theater to watch this latest one. I resisted the theaters, and I was like “I know I’ll eventually get here.” And we’ve just built our house this last year, and moved in in June, so it’s a new thing… If there was a way I could buy that digitally and get a version that would like run on a known operating system like Plex, for example, like a movie operating system, if there was a digital artifact that I can also purchase, that I would have forever, that wasn’t like a DRM thing, that was like an MKV file thing, then I would be okay with evolving. I’m not against evolution. What I’m sort of against is what that represents, to some degree, for the future. Like, how will my kids rewatch these films we’ve watched, with their kids, 20 years from now? I mean, it’s not very far away. 20 years is not very far away… You know?"
