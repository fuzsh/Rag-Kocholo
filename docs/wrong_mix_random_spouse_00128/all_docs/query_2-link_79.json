        "text": "The following, rated on a system of 0 to 4 stars, are by Rick Groen, Liam Lacey. Full reviews appeared on the dates indicated. Adaptation***½ A bona fide original, screenwriter Chalie Kaufman broke the mould with his inventive script for Being John Malkovich, and he's back at it again here. A comic gem with some serious sparkles, Adaptation pulls off a feat I would have thought impossible on the screen -- it manages to dramatize the art and sullen craft of writing. More precisely, it gets into the schizoid head of virtually every wordsmith who ever picked up a quill pen. That the head happens to belong to Kaufman himself (with both halves played by Nicolas Cage) leads me to the next astonishing fact. All this should be self-indulgent and should not appeal to anyone beyond his fellow legion of scribblers. But it isn't, and it does. AA (Dec. 6) -- R.G. Antwone Fisher** If you're in the market for sentimental uplift -- and 'tis the season -- then this may fit the bill. A caution though. The tale of a troubled African-American who made good, it's the brand of sentimentality that comes with a high concentration of saccharine and every taste of bitterness safely removed. The confectionist is Denzel Washington, who's making his directorial debut, but don't let his celebrated name fool you. The picture's rightful home is really on network TV, tucked between Touched by an Angel and Anne Murray's Christmas. AA (Dec. 20) -- R.G. Catch Me If You Can*** Great imposters make for great yarns, and for obvious reasons -- they fall squarely into the pop tradition of the tall tale, they always feature a picaresque rogue of terrific charm, and they speak straight to the latent imposter in all of us. Add in the fact that Catch Me if You Can has Leonardo DiCaprio in front of the camera and Steven Spielberg behind it -- in one of his cheerful, sunny-side-up outings -- and the result should be a nice slight treat. It is. No more than that, despite ample opportunities, but let's not carp. PG (Dec. 24) -- R.G. Die Another Day**½ A terrific first half-hour in which James Bond is jailed, tortured and fired (and risks developing character depth), soon gives way to a more typical series of spectacacular action set-pieces from Cuba to Iceland to North Korea, and a lot of unconvincing computer-generated imagery. Toby Stephens plays the British diamond merchant who wants to rule the world with a laser satellite but what is his secret connection to a rogue North Korean military officer? Rick Yune, face studded with diamond-pitted scars, plays another villain, with Halle Berry as that rarity, a Bond girl who can stuff a wild bikini and also act her co-star's pants off. AA (Nov. 22) -- L.L. Eight Crazy Nights*½ Adam Sandler's third feature this year is an animated musical about a cruel small-town drunk who gets saved by an elderly tiny basketball coach and learns the holiday spirit. The scene where the Sandler cartoon surrogate is confronted by the retail logos of Christmases past at the local mall has a certain absurd panache, but the fat kid, Chinese restaurateur and excretion jokes aren't just incorrect, they're cheap and mean. PG (Nov. 27) -- L.L. Gangs of New York**½ For Martin Scorsese, this was a dream project he's been nurturing since the seventies. Tracing the mean streets of New York back to their origins in the mid-19th century, the film would be his epic American period piece. Alas, no. Gangs does have its moments -- an auteur with talent will always provide that, especially when he can draw on the performing skills of Daniel Day-Lewis. But moments do not an epic make. Scorsese means this picture to be his masterpiece of the Civil War era, his urban answer to Gone With the Wind; instead, all he's generated is a rude question: Is it his Heaven's Gate? AA (Dec. 20) -- R.G. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*** Less talk and more action this time around, if that appeals to you. Otherwise, it's a movie that serves the Potter franchise well, that won't disappoint either kids or their parents, and that bears the markings of its solid studio craftsmanship -- worthy performances, credible effects, competent direction. So, in the midst of such stalwart craft, maybe only the curmudgeonly will lament the missing element: This is a movie about magic that ultimately lacks the magic of movies. PG (Nov. 15) -- R.G. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*** The second instalment of director Peter Jackson's $300-million adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume novel is darker, with more narrative momentum and less whimsy than the first movie, as the characters split up to go their separate ways. The climactic siege battle is a massive achievement in cinematic engineering, if a bit repetitive. The real star is the computer-generated character, Gollum, a small, bald, pink computer-generated homunculus (Andy Serkis). In a world of abstract Good and Evil, he's the embodiment of anarchic contradictory impulses. AA (Dec. 18) -- L.L. Maid in Manhattan** A distracted Jennifer Lopez plays the humble chambermaid; a miscast Ralph Fiennes plays the famous politician. The genre: formulaic romance comedy. The verdict: J-Lo, Ralph-Lower, Movie-Subterranean. PG (Dec. 13) -- R.G. Rabbit-Proof Fence**½ Set in 1931, the movie tells an extraordinary real-life story of three mixed-race Aboriginal girls who escaped from their residential school where they were being trained as domestics, to travel across 2,000 kilometres of desert and rough land to rejoin their mothers. Director Phillip Noyce doesn't really do this potentially epic story justice. Kenneth Branagh, as a single-minded racist bureaucrat, gets far too much attention, the incredible expedition not enough. PG (Nov. 29) -- L.L. Saint Monica** Terrance Odette's Saint Monica is about a 10-year-old Portuguese Catholic girl with an angel obsession who befriends a homeless woman who thinks she's the Virgin Mary. The family's quirks are moderately enjoyable, but the overall script too saccharine to enjoy. PG (Dec. 13) -- L.L. Solaris*** Having drifted of late after those duelling Oscar triumphs, Steven Soderbergh tries to correct his course with this adaptation of the Stanislaw Lem novel. And does he? Well, it isn't perfect but it is better. The territory is metaphysical sci-fi, but Soderbergh wisely confines his focus to a single issue for the ages: the nature of romantic passion. The result is a cerebral love story, which places enormous pressure on the principal actors to fill the emotional void, to engage our feelings while the script occupies our minds. Natascha McElhone is up to the task, George Clooney is not. AA (Nov. 27) -- R.G. Star Trek: Nemesis**½ Familiarity breeds content in this 10th Star Trek movie, in which Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) must do battle with a young, evil clone of himself (Tom Hardy). Once again, the space crew investigates a mysterious incident, there is a lot of background exposition, transporters are used, the spaceships blast each other. Picard and Data (Brent Spiner) get centre stage; the rest of the cast stand around and say the lines they always say. PG (Dec. 13) -- L.L. The Way Home*** If you ever doubted the power and scope of silent film, watch The Way Home. The tale is a fresh variation on a familiar tale -- city mouse meets country mouse, cocky kid leaves Seoul to visit his mute granny deep in the Korean countryside. The narrative arc is as broad as any chattering feature, the emotional depth is greater than most, and it's all achieved with virtually no dialogue. Director Jeong-Hyang Lee lets her pictures speak their thousand words and her actors add eloquent grace notes. PG (Dec. 6) -- R.G."
