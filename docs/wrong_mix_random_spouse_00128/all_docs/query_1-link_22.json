Especially King of Comedy, because I always point out that the only place that King of Comedy was appreciated was Britain.”\n\nHe added, in his interview with The Guardian: “But I didn’t want to get involved with it.”\n\nJoker, directed by Todd Phillips, was noted upon release for its similarities to 1983’s The King of Comedy, about a loner who idolises a TV comic, and 1978’s Taxi Driver, about a lonely vigilante living in urban New York.\n\nScorsese himself was originally speculated to be involved with Joker as a producer, but he is not credited on the final film.\n\nThe 40 best films of the decade\n\nShow all 40\n\nIt was claimed in October that Scorsese was originally offered the chance to direct the film. The filmmaker’s representative denied the rumour to the Hollywood Reporter, however, saying he “had no intention to direct” the film and only “considered producing”.\n\nThe report also claimed that Scorsese departed his potential producer role on Joker to work on The Irishman. He remained somewhat involved with the project via his regular producing partner Emma Tillinger Koskoff, who was installed in a Joker producer role shortly after Scorsese’s exit.\n\nJoker has been one of 2019’s most successful films, grossing over a billion dollars at the global box office.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
