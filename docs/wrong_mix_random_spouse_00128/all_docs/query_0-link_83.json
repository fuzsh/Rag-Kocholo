        "text": "It is with a heavy heart that The Mill shares the very sad news of the passing of Amanda Libotte on 27th June 2024. Amanda worked with MPC and most recently The Mill for just under 30 years. A truly distinguished career, including starting MPC in NY, producing many award-winning projects, and setting the gold standard for how studios should operate most effectively, and within a culture of true collaboration, respect, and fun. As a dedicated member of the MPC/The Mill family, she was a caring, loving soul who spent each day helping those around her reach their highest potential; Amandaâ€™s impact on the London and NY creative communities touched thousands of lives. Passionate about VFX, and an avid educator for both the School of Visual Arts and the Ghetto Film School in NY, Amanda left a long-lasting impression on countless students. For those fortunate enough to have known Amanda well, her impact on our lives is something that will last forever. A remarkable person in so many ways; fearless in standing up for what is right and fair, a true champion of diversity, always considerate of others and a pillar of strength to those around her who were looking for support or guidance through a difficult situation. Amandaâ€™s priorities always laid with those around her, and for those fortunate enough to know Amanda, we were all so much the better for her wonderful and entertaining company, her great sense of humor, and her wisdom and knowledge of broader cultures and arts. A truly inspirational figure, a true legend of our industry, respected and admired by us all. ðŸ”— https://lnkd.in/eQQKzFim\n\nThe Millâ€™s partnership with Ghetto Film School kicked off with a bang as the New York studio welcomed the first-year student cohort for 2024â€™s Pitch Day. Our vibrant team of The Mill mentors came together from all departments including Production, 2D, CG, Edit, Color, and TechOps. As in previous years, the young aspiring filmmakers were tasked with writing a script for their first non-dialogue short films to be pitched to our mentors within 2 minutes. They were able to receive real-time feedback, boosting their film-making skills and storytelling confidence. We were blown away by the incredible talent and creativity each student brought to the table! Thank you to our volunteers below as well as NY Head of Culture, Ryan Brinkmann and Operations Manager, Jelena SavanoviÄ‡ for spearheading this event with support from our NY Front of House Team and GFS Facilitators. Big thank you to The Mill mentors: Anthony Jones, John Wilson, Joanne Lee, Dara Ã“ Cairbre, Mo Thavornwatanayong, Navdeep Singh, Sam Ommen, Rithika I., T'Naige Wallace, Anton Anderson, Casey-Leigh Jordan, Juli Wright, Laura Nash, Brandon Wilson, Lauren Yianilos, Fionna Lanning, Thomas McCullough, Melissa Garcia, Joe Zappulla, Lauren Wright, Amonnie Nicolas\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Sony Pictures Entertainment has acquired Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in a deal that puts a major Hollywood studio back in the business of owning a movie theater for the first time in more than 75 years. For more than seven decades, studios werenâ€™t allowed to own an exhibition company under the Paramount Consent Decrees, which were rescinded in 2020. Wednesdayâ€™s announcement stressed that Alamo Drafthouse â€” an independent chain with 37 locations that has been at the forefront of in-theater dining and other consumer-friendly initiatives â€” will continue to be run by Alamo CEO Michael Kustermann, under a new division that heâ€™ll also be in charge of, Sony Pictures Experiences. Sony said the deal reinforces its long-held commitment to theatrical exhibition and continued initiatives in experiential entertainment. #sony #sonypictures #alamo #alamodrafthouse #movies #popculture"
