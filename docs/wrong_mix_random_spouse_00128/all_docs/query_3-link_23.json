Selznick Achievement Award at the 2024 Producers Guild Awards\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA — The Producers Guild of America (PGA) announced today that Academy Award-winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese will be honored with the 2024 David O. Selznick Achievement Award for his monumental achievements in more than six decades of producing. He will accept the honor at the 35th Annual Producers Guild Awards on Sunday, February 25.\n\nThe David O. Selznick Achievement Award recognizes producers for their outstanding body of work in motion pictures. The Award has a rich and distinguished history with past recipients including such legendary producers as Steven Spielberg, Barbara Broccoli, Mary Parent, Tom Cruise, Brian Grazer, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, and George Lucas.\n\n\"Marty's trailblazing career as a producer, marked by decades of bold, breakthrough projects, demands to be celebrated,\" expressed PGA Presidents Donald De Line and Stephanie Allain. \"His mastery and unwavering commitment to the craft are truly unparalleled. We are proud to honor him and his many filmmaking achievements this year at the PGA Awards.\"\n\nSaid Scorsese, “In March 1965, I was flown out to Los Angeles by the PGA to receive an award for my student film ‘It’s Not Just You, Murray!’ I was 22 at the time. At the same event, a much older filmmaker was also being honored. His name was Alfred Hitchcock.”\n\n“58 years later, I’m proud to say that I am now the much older filmmaker. And I’m touched and extremely honored to be receiving an award named after a true legend among producers, David O. Selznick. It makes me feel like I’ve come full circle.”\n\nDriven by a passion for cinema and dedication to telling important stories with timeless characters, Scorsese has worked for the past six decades producing films that are momentous and unforgettable. His legendary career as a producer has spanned 63 years and in that time he has produced more than 50 motion pictures across a myriad of genres, including this year’s acclaimed, New York Film Critics Circle award-winning feature “Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nScorsese, renowned as one of the most influential producers of our time, has profoundly shaped cinema, bringing to life iconic characters from classic films and accumulating an ever-expanding list of accolades. This prestigious award celebrates his outstanding achievements and lasting impact on the world of filmmaking. Scorsese continues to achieve excellence through award-winning work that has garnered him three PGA Award nominations, earning one for his work on \"Boardwalk Empire,” as well as 14 Academy Award nominations including one Best Director win for “The Departed.”\n\nIn addition to “Killers of The Flower Moon,” Scorsese’s credits as a producer include \"The Irishman,\" \"Silence,\" \"Shutter Island,\" \"Hugo,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" \"Personality Crisis: One Night Only\" and \"George Harrison: Living in the Material World.”\n\nSponsors of the 2024 Producers Guild Awards include Cadillac, the Official Vehicle, Delta Air Lines, the Official Airline, Glenfiddich Scotch, and GreenSlate."
