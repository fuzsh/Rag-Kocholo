        "text": "It was my distinct honor to be on the host committee for GLAAD's annual TIDINGS celebration this past Saturday, which raised over a quarter million dollars for GLAAD's life-changing initiatives in 2024! üéâüåà Thank you to Sarah Kate Ellis, Matthew Zaccagni, co-chairs Chris Fraley, Jarvis Sam, and Candis Cayne, my fellow host committee members, friends and family who donated, and the entire GLAAD team for including me in this incredible evening. With federal marriage restrictions, transgender discrimination legislation, and \"Don't Say Gay\" measures on the horizon in the coming year, GLAAD's megaphone will be more important than ever. We must ensure that our voices, our stories, and our community are front and center in the national dialogue. If any members of my LinkedIn community would like to directly support our donation efforts, they can do so by clicking the link below. https://lnkd.in/gbUSMnnz #representationmatters #lgbtq #lgbtqrights #glaad #calltoaction\n\nI had the privilege of co-curating three impactful events in commemoration of Native American Heritage Month at Soho House & Co. over the past two weeks. We began with a hands-on session led by Marcelle Bouchard, a talented Isleta Pueblo descendant and bead artist. Members immersed themselves in crafting Heishi Necklaces, weaving together turquoise, white heishi, onyx, and coral beads sourced from Pueblo communities across the Southwest Territories. The workshop was followed by an exclusive screening of \"Lakota Nation vs. The United States,\" a poignant documentary that premiered at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival. Directed by Jesse Short Bull and Laura Tomaselli, the film delves into the enduring quest of the Lakota Indians to reclaim the sacred Black Hills of South Dakota, unjustly seized by the American government in 1876. The documentary explores the historical injustices faced by Indigenous communities across the nation, prompting crucial conversations on accountability. Our month-long series concluded with a compelling panel discussion on Native representation in film and TV, moderated by MRK MGMT client Justin Johnson Cortez. Esteemed guests, including Rene Haynes (Casting Director, Killers of the Flower Moon), Karissa Valencia (EP, Netflix's Spirit Rangers), Shelley Dennis (Writer, ABC's The Connors), and Loren Anthony (Actor, AMC's Dark Winds), engaged in thought-provoking conversations about Hollywood's complex past and the optimistic future for Native stories and creators in the industry. Special thanks to Soho House's Diversity and Inclusion Board for orchestrating these exceptional events and amplifying Native voices within our community. As a #LGBTQ business owner, I recognize the significance of allies in our shared journey. It was an honor to foster these unique opportunities as an ally to the Native community, emphasizing that our commitment to celebrating, recognizing, and supporting Native peoples and creatives should extend far beyond the confines of November. #Allyship #NativeVoices #DiversityandInclusion #IndigenousVoices #CulturalCelebration #NativeArtistry #FilmIndustry #RepresentationMatters #NativeStories #nativeamericanheritagemonth\n\nToday, October 19th, is GLAAD's #SpiritDay, the world‚Äôs most visible anti-bullying movement, inspiring #LGBTQ youth to live their lives in their truth and authenticity! Today I \"go purple\" and take the Spirit Day Pledge to take a stand against bullying and join GLAAD in accelerating acceptance! A 2023 national survey shows that 60% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, and 41% of LGBTQ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, with an even larger percentage for young people who are transgender, nonbinary, and/or people of color. As a LGBTQ business owner and talent representative, I am proud that my clients have been a part of the 10.6% of LGBTQ characters represented on scripted television in the 2022‚Äì2023 season. A number that gravely contrasts with the actual percentage of LGBTQ-identifying people in the country. And a statistic that inspires me to fight for more visibility that showcases queer people thriving, loving, and living as their authentic selves. Thank you to GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD VP Mel Harris, and Creative Artists Agency for hosting Nick Reid and me for their GLAAD Corporate Summit and Fifth Annual Spirit Day Concert powered by Live Nation Entertainment and The Recording Academy at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles. The night was full of love, support, community, and incredible performances from showstopping queer artists! Please join me in taking the #SpiritDay Pledge and visit the link below! https://lnkd.in/gqDCyzB6\n\nI am proud to support my SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America West clients and their right to strike for a fair deal! In my role as a talent representative, I have witnessed firsthand the steady erosion of fair compensation for working actors. The lack of trickle-down economics, in which Studios do not share their profits with the actors and writers who create their success, has limited the opportunity for growth in the career sector and discourages our everyday artists from entering the industry entirely. When many of these artists' residual checks are reduced to pennies when their shows are moved to streaming services, one wonders where all of their hard-earned money has gone? That answer, I believe, is well known to the general public. If our industry is to survive, profit sharing, viewership transparency, and an increased bottom line for artists must be improved. Money in the pockets of the artists who bring this industry to life helps to build and sustain the surrounding economy. It is past time to put an end to corporate greed and strike a fair deal for all parties involved. I urge all of my LinkedIn connections to join these labor unions on the picket line and learn more about how their fight for the entertainment industry's future is a fight for all industries. The world is watching as we approach the AI cliff. Our nation's prosperity rests on the backs of its workers and their strong unions; now, more than ever, is the time for those unions to stand united and strong. #sagaftrastrong #wgastrong #sagaftrastrike #wgastrike #unionstrong #entertainment #hollywood #talentmanagement\n\nüåà Netflix‚Äôs New LGBTQIA+ Dramedy \"Glamorous\" Premieres Today!üè≥Ô∏è‚ößÔ∏è I am #Proud to announce that the highly anticipated series premiere of \"Glamorous,\" starring MRK MGMT client Ayesha Harris opposite Kim Cattrall and Miss Benny, is finally here‚Äîexclusively on Netflix! What a perfect way to celebrate Pride Month! Being an LGBTQIA+ business owner myself, I understand the value of sharing the experiences of successful Queer people in the workplace and how they inspire the next generation of workers and creatives. Seeing Queer characters thrive in society allows others to believe that they, too, can achieve greatness simply by celebrating their truth and being their authentic selves. We need more shows like \"Glamorous\" that focus on the positive experiences of the LGBTQIA+ community as we face unprecedented attacks in the year 2023. As we immerse ourselves in the world of \"Glamorous,\" let's celebrate the magic of Pride Month and the strides we've made toward a more inclusive society. Let's use this opportunity to support LGBTQ+ representation in the media, promote acceptance, and amplify the voices that empower and inspire us. Happy Pride Month, and here's to a future where LGBTQ+ stories continue to be celebrated and embraced. üåàüéâ #GlamorousNetflix #PrideMonth #LGBTQRepresentation #AuthenticStorytelling #DiversityandInclusion #lgbtqia #RepresentationMatters #DiversityInEntertainment #InclusionInMedia #EntertainmentIndustry #DiverseTalent #EqualOpportunity #InclusiveCasting #InclusiveStorytelling https://lnkd.in/gadFSPu8\n\nüéâ 'All American: Homecoming' Officially Renewed for Third Season at The CW I am absolutely thrilled to share that MRK MGMT client Netta Walker will return as \"Keisha McCalla\" for Season 3 of \"All American: Homecoming!\" This renewal is more than just a celebration of the show's success; it symbolizes a growing recognition of the importance and power of black storytelling in mainstream media. \"All American: Homecoming\" has consistently provided a platform for underrepresented voices, shedding light on the rich culture, history, and challenges faced by HBCUs. It has become a powerful catalyst for conversation and understanding, pushing boundaries and breaking stereotypes along the way. By showcasing the journeys of talented HBCU student-athletes and the struggles they face both on and off the field, \"All American: Homecoming\" has ignited a sense of pride and appreciation for the incredible contributions of HBCUs to our society. It serves as a reminder that these institutions have been pivotal in shaping the lives and futures of countless individuals. This renewal reaffirms The CW Network's commitment to diversity and inclusion, ensuring that stories from different backgrounds are given the platform they deserve. It sets a precedent for other networks to follow suit, recognizing the immense talent and unique narratives within the black community. #AllAmericanHomecoming #RenewalAnnouncement #ExcitingNews #HBCURepresentation #BlackStorytelling #DiversityInMedia #InclusionMatters #CelebratingDiverseVoices #TheCW #HBCUPride #RepresentationMatters #PowerOfStorytelling #BlackExcellence #MediaIndustry #InclusiveEntertainment #InspiringNarratives #BreakingBarriers #SupportingDiverseContent"
