        "text": "For some of this year’s Oscar nominees and winners, there is truly no rest for the weary. Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening both have high-profile TV shows premiering this spring, while Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling are so close to the release of their new movie The Fall Guy that they were essentially promoting it at the Oscars. Then there are other nominees, like screenplay winners Justine Triet and Cord Jefferson, who seem ready to take their time.\n\nWhether it will be a short wait or a long one, here’s your guide on where to look next for most of this year’s major Oscar nominees and winners.\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nThe best-actor winner and Oppenheimer star has already debuted his next role. He stars in the Irish drama Small Things Like These, which also stars Michelle Fairley and Emily Watson and premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February.\n\nPaul Giamatti\n\nYou can hear the Holdovers star regularly on his Chinwag podcast, which he hosts with Stephen Asma. Giamatti is also reportedly in the upcoming film Peachville opposite Simon Pegg and Ming-Na Wen.\n\nJeffrey Wright\n\nThe American Fiction nominee will reprise his role as Commissioner Gordon in Matt Reeves’s upcoming sequel to The Batman, which Warner Bros. recently set for an October 2026 release.\n\nColman Domingo\n\nOf all the best-actor nominees, we’ll likely see Rustin’s Domingo again the soonest. His film Sing Sing, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last year to raves, is set for a July release from A24. You can even watch the stirring trailer now.\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nCooper’s next role debuted immediately after the Oscars—he played himself on the post-Oscar episode of Abbott Elementary. But as with his nominated film Maestro, he’ll be back behind the camera soon enough, directing and starring opposite Will Arnett in Is This Thing On?. The project was announced this past June shortly after the writers strike began.\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nEmma Stone\n\nThe best-actress winner and her Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos are on a roll, having already completed the anthology film Kinds of Kindness as well as a short film, Bleat. As of February she was also in talks for a role in his upcoming remake of Save the Green Planet!, and then there’s always the persistent talk of a Cruella 2.\n\nLily Gladstone\n\nGladstone may have lost the Oscar for best actress in the year’s tightest race, but the Killers of the Flower Moon breakout certainly caught Hollywood’s eye for her wrenching performance in Martin Scorsese’s epic. She’ll lead the buzzy film The Memory Police, adapted from the acclaimed Yoko Ogowa novel by Oscar winner Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) and helmed by Emmy winner Reed Morano (The Handmaid’s Tale). (Scorsese is also involved as an executive producer.) And while that’s a ways away, Gladstone will actually be back on our screens next month, as a lead in Hulu’s Emmy-contending limited series Under the Bridge, costarring Riley Keough.\n\nSandra Hüller\n\nThe first-time nominee for Anatomy of a Fall may soon find herself back on the festival circuit for Rose, a buzzy drama in which Hüller plays a 17th-century woman who disguises herself as a man to go to war. “It was easier than living as a woman at that time,” she told David Canfield on Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast recently, where she also teased some high-profile upcoming projects she can’t yet reveal. Is that so-called Oscar bump real? “It is real,” she said, “and I’m very happy about it.” Stay tuned.\n\nCarey Mulligan\n\nMulligan’s Maestro follow-up is already out there—she’s in Netflix’s Spaceman opposite Adam Sandler—but she’s also attached to the UK-set comedy One for the Money, which was for sale at the Cannes market last year.\n\nAnnette Bening\n\nThe five-time Oscar nominee and Nyad star has added another new accomplishment to her increasingly impressive résumé: executive producer. Bening stars in and executive-produced the limited series Apples Never Fall, which is based on Liane Moriarty’s best-selling novel and premieres on Peacock March 14. The series also stars Sam Neill, Alison Brie, and Jake Lacy.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nFor those who thought Downey had transformed himself to play Oppenheimer’s Lewis Strauss, buckle up for The Sympathizer, which premieres on HBO April 14. In the limited series Downey dons a range of wigs and other prosthetics to play a series of characters who represent, more or less, Western imperialism. As Don McKellar, co-showrunner of the series with Park Chan-wook, put it in our first look at the series, Downey liberated everyone involved in the genre-busting show “to go for it.”\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nFor anyone wondering how Gosling might top his crowd-pleasing and award-nominated performance as Ken, the early buzz on his next film, The Fall Guy, is very good. The film revolves around Gosling’s stuntman Colt Seavers, who tries to quit the business after getting injured on the job, but is lured back to work when his former love Jody (Emily Blunt) needs his help. The film also stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Winston Duke, and Hannah Waddingham and is directed by David Leitch (Bullet Train). The Fall Guy premieres at the SXSW Film Festival this week and hits theaters May 3.\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nThe Poor Things star’s next big role was supposed to be right around the corner. But now that Warner Bros. has delayed the release of Bong Joon-ho’s Mickey 17 to 2025, we’ll have to look toward the indie TV series Hal & Harper, with Cha Cha Real Smooth wunderkind Cooper Raiff.\n\nSterling K. Brown\n\nThe American Fiction first-time nominee shot to fame in Hollywood through his powerful Emmy-winning performances on television series including This Is Us and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, and he’s got some more juicy small-screen work in the pipeline: He has reunited with This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman on Paradise City, a Hulu thriller in which Brown plays a former president’s head of security, and he’s a key cast member in the long-gestating adaptation of the decorated novel Washington Black, also with Hulu.\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nHis Killers of the Flower Moon follow-up Ezra, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last year, comes to theaters on May 31, from director Tony Goldwyn. He also stars in the upcoming Barry Levinson film Alto Knights, in which he plays a dual role as mob bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. Warner Bros. has it set for a March release in 2025.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nThe best-supporting-actress winner and Holdovers star has a role in the upcoming Rebel Wilson comedy Bride Hard, and she’ll also star opposite Kerry Washington and Omar Sy in the action thriller Shadow Force. She has also strongly hinted that they’ll find a way to include her in the upcoming fourth season of Only Murders in the Building.\n\nEmily Blunt\n\nBlunt will be back on the big screen very soon in another highly anticipated film, The Fall Guy, playing opposite Ryan Gosling (see above for more on that film). The friendly costars teamed up on the Oscars stage Sunday to honor the stunt community and delivered one of the most fun and memorable bits of the night, playing up their Barbenheimer rivalry. In addition to Fall Guy, Blunt lends her voice to husband John Krasinski’s upcoming film “If,” in which she plays a unicorn.\n\nJodie Foster\n\nWith the Oscar campaign season now complete, we can expect Foster to become part of the Emmy campaign season for her acclaimed work in True Detective: Night Country, in which she starred and served as executive producer. Foster will also appear in a documentary about her Silence of the Lambs costar Anthony Hopkins, which the actor’s wife, Stella, is currently filming.\n\nAmerica Ferrera\n\nIt had been nearly a decade since America Ferrera had appeared in a movie when both Dumb Money and her Oscar-nominated Barbie hit theaters last year. Her next gap will be far shorter, as the Emmy winner is set to star opposite Matthew McConaughey in Paul Greengrass’s next drama, The Lost Bus. She’s also developing her feature directorial debut, I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, which was just acquired by Amazon MGM Studios’ Orion Pictures.\n\nDanielle Brooks\n\nAlthough the production start date has not yet been set, The Color Purple star will reprise her fan-loved role as Leota Adebayo on the second season of Peacemaker with John Cena. Her character is also expected to make an appearance in the DCEU spin-off series Waller, starring Viola Davis. Brooks will also appear in Minecraft, with Jason Momoa, Kate McKinnon, Jennifer Coolidge and Jack Black, which is currently in production in New Zealand.\n\nAND THE FILMMAKERS TOO!\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nAlthough you might argue that he’s already made his ambitious and weird Oscar follow-up, just in reverse, Christopher Nolan’s post-Oppenheimer project will continue to be the subject of intense speculation until he finally gets around to announcing it. Given that he’s released films on a meticulous every-three-years schedule for the past decade, we may not be waiting too much longer.\n\nWes Anderson\n\nAt long last an Oscar winner for his live action short film The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar, Anderson wasn’t present to accept his award because he’s already in Germany getting ready for his next movie, which is said to star Bill Murray, Michael Cera, and Benicio del Toro.\n\nGreta Gerwig\n\nDespite the $1.5 billion blank check Barbie granted her, Gerwig is first moving on to a project she took on long before turning the world pink: an adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia for Netflix. Beyond that, though, she may have some thinking to do. “I don’t want to get too precious about making the ‘right’ decision.” she told Vanity Fair last year. “I want to give myself enough time to get lost so that I’m not so demanding of output to let it be uncomfortable.”\n\nJonathan Glazer\n\nLike Christopher Nolan, Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer releases his films at a steady cadence—but they tend to come about a decade apart. He told the Los Angeles Times that as a way to step away from the Holocaust horrors of Zone, his next film will be “about tenderness— how tender we can be as well.” But as the Times adds, “It won’t come for a while.”\n\nCord Jefferson\n\nA newly minted Oscar winner for best-adapted screenplay, Jefferson was told by none other than Spike Lee to make his next film “as quickly as possible.” But with an overall deal at Warner Bros. television, Jefferson says that even though he’s working on a few scripts now, it may be a while before his name is on another film: “Look, if I can sit down and finish one of these scripts in the next couple of months and it’s to a place that I really, really love, then I’m all for directing another movie quickly if Warner Bros. will allow me. But until it’s really there, I don’t want to try to rush something just to get something out there.”\n\nYorgos Lanthimos\n\nLanthimos is staying in the Emma Stone business. Following his star’s best actress win on Sunday, we’ll get Kinds of Kindness, an anthology reuniting Stone with Poor Things scene-stealers Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, as well as Oscar nominees Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons. Then Stone and Lanthimos are set to make another movie, a remake of the South Korean comedy Save the Green Planet. Expect more joint trips to the Oscars in their future.\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nAt 81 years old and with no apparent desire to slow down, the Killers of the Flower Moon director has teased plans to make an 80-minute movie about Jesus but set in the present day. He’s also been attached since 2022 to direct an adaptation of The Wager, the latest book from Killers of the Flower Moon author David Grann. While doing press for Killers, however, he suggested that last one might be a ways off.\n\nCeline Song\n\nSong is already hard at work on her next feature film, Materialists, which she will write and direct for Sony. Production is set to begin this year and rumored stars are Pedro Pascal, Dakota Johnson, and Chris Evans. The romantic comedy reportedly revolves around a matchmaker who becomes entangled with a wealthy man while still dealing with complicated feelings about an ex.\n\nJustine Triet\n\nDavid Thion, producer of Triet’s best-original-screenplay-winning Anatomy of a Fall, has teased that they will be teaming up again soon, though details are scarce. “Justine has devoted herself fully to the awards campaign for Anatomy of a Fall, and she hasn’t had time to decide what her next film will be, but she has a few ideas,” Thion told Variety before the Oscars.\n\nThe Best Moments From the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party"
