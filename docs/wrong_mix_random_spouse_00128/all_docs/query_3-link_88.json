        "text": "For the first time in 37 years, Martin Scorsese will bring a new film to Cannes Film Festival\n\nMartin Scorsese will premiere his new film Killer of the Flower Moon at Cannes Film Festival 2023. The news is particularly exciting for cinema lovers as it is the first time the director has shown at film on la croisette in 37 years.\n\n“Together with Apple Original Films, the Festival de Cannes confirms that Martin Scorsese will present in world premiere Killers of the Flower Moon, his new feature film. The event will mark the return of the filmmaker to the Official Selection for the first time since the presentation of After Hours in 1986,” reads a statement from the festival organisers.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon will be screened at the Grand Théâtre Lumière. The film is inspired by the eponymous, best-selling book by David Grann and is set in 1920s Oklahoma. It depicts the murder of members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation, crimes which have come to be referred to as the “Reign of Terror.”\n\nFor this latest project, Scorsese signed up with Apple on a 200 million budget. Killers of the Flower Moon will be released in France in October.\n\nMartin Scorsese and the Festival de Cannes: an enduring collaboration\n\nMartin Scorsese received the Palme d’Or in 1976 for his film Taxi Driver which is presented in Competition and ten years later, he won Best Director’s Award for the film After Hours. In 1998, Scorcese was President of the Jury, and in 2002 he chaired the Jury for the Cinéfondation and Short Films."
