        "text": "Martin Scorsese, visionary director of Apple Original Films “Killers of the Flower Moon,” awarded prestigious Honorary Golden Bear from the Berlin International Film Festival, presented by Wim Wenders\n\nThe ceremony opened with special orchestral performance of Robbie Robertson’s Oscar-nominated “Killers of the Flower Moon” original score, set to scenes from the 10-time Academy Award-nominated film\n\nVisionary “Killers of the Flower Moon” director and historic 10-time Academy Award nominee Martin Scorsese was recognized with the prestigious Honorary Golden Bear from the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale), presented by trailblazing filmmaker and playwright Wim Wenders. The Honorary Golden Bear pays tribute to important figures in the world of film, and is presented to those with exceptional artistic careers. The awards ceremony opened with a special orchestral performance of Robbie Robertson’s Oscar-nominated “Killers of the Flower Moon” score, set to scenes from the film. Guests in attendance included Sharon Stone, Fatih Akin, “Killers of the Flower Moon” Best Editing Academy Award nominee Thelma Schoonmaker, the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media of Germany Claudia Roth, Karoline Herfurth, Sibel Kekilli, Maria Schrader, Martina Gedeck and Francesca Scorsese.\n\nBroadly hailed as a “masterpiece,” Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” was recently honored with 10 Academy Award nominations, including nods for Best Picture, Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Lily Gladstone), Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. With landmark representation for Indigenous artists, Gladstone made history as the first Native American to land a nomination for Best Actress, and Indigenous artists Robbie Robertson and Scott George were recognized with first-ever nominations in the Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories, respectively. Additionally, George is the first member of the Osage Nation to be nominated for an Academy Award. Scorsese made history as he became the most-nominated living director, bringing his total to 10 total lifetime Academy Award nominations for Best Director.\n\nThe film has been honored as the Best Film of the Year by the National Board of Review, which named star Lily Gladstone as Best Actress, Martin Scorsese as Best Director, and Rodrigo Prieto for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography, and it was also named to the American Film Institute’s list of Motion Pictures of the Year. The film has received over 200 accolades, in addition to recognition from over 30 critics groups globally, and has been named the No. 1 Best Film of 2023 by The New York Times and The New Yorker, and Best Film by the New York Film Critics Circle. Gladstone recently made history as the first Indigenous actress to win Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama at the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic Western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal.
