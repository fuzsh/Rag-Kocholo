This years list also includes the local hire casting directors who fill out the tapestry of each picture with much of the supporting cast.\n\nNow, let’s check out which CDs would have been in the running this year… for the 2020 Academy Awards!\n\n92nd Academy Awards™ - Honoring Films Released in 2019 (Presented in 2020)\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nRonna Kress, Kissy Dugan, Cassandra Han (Italy) (Ford Vs Ferrari - Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, James Mangold)\n\nEllen Lewis (The Irishman - Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, Emma Tillinger)\n\nDes Hamilton, Maya Kvetny (Czech Republic) (JoJo Rabbit - Carthew Neal, Taika Waititi, Chelsea Winstanley)\n\nShayna Markowitz (Joker - Todd Philips, Bradley Cooper, Emma Tillinger Koskoff)\n\nKathy Driscoll, Francine Maisler, Douglas Aibel (NY), Matt Bouldry (Massachusetts) (Little Women – Amy Pascal)\n\nDouglas Aibel, Francine Maisler (Marriage Story - Noah Baumbach, David Heyman)\n\nNina Gold (1917 - Sam Mendes, Pippa Harris, Jayne-Ann Tenggren, Callum McDougall)\n\nVictoria Thomas (Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood - David Heyman, Shannon McIntosh, Quentin Tarantino\n\nHeidi Levitt (Parasite - Kwak Sin Ae, Bong Joon Ho)\n\nBEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE\n\nEva Leira, Yolanda Serrano (Pain & Glory – Antonio Banderas)\n\nVictoria Thomas (Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood – Leonardo DiCaprio)\n\nDouglas Aibel, Francine Maisler (Marriage Story – Adam Driver)\n\nShayna Markowitz (Joker – Joaquin Phoenix)\n\nNina Gold, Barbara Giordani, Francesco Vedovati (Italy), Diego Betancor (Spain) (The Two Popes - Jonathan Pryce)\n\nBEST ACTRESS IN LEADING ROLE\n\nKim Coleman (Harriet - Cynthia Erivo)\n\nDouglas Aibel, Francine Maisler (Marriage Story – Scarlett Johansson\n\nKathy Driscoll, Francine Maisler, Douglas Aibel (NY), Matt Bouldry (Massachusetts) (Little Women – Saorise Ronan)\n\nAllison Jones (Bombshell – Charlize Theron)\n\nAlice Searby, Fiona Weir (Judy – Renee Zellweger)\n\nBEST ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE\n\nAvy Kaufman, Donna Belajac (Location) (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood – Tom Hanks\n\nNina Gold, Barbara Giordani, Francesco Vedovati (Italy), Diego Betancor (Spain) (The Two Popes – Anthony Hopkins)\n\nEllen Lewis (The Irishman – Al Pacino & Joe Pesci)\n\nVictoria Thomas (Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood – Brad Pitt)\n\nBEST ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE\n\nGeoffrey Miclat (Richard Jewell – Kathy Bates)\n\nDouglas Aibel, Francine Maisler (Marriage Story – Laura Dern)\n\nDes Hamilton, Maya Kvetny (Czech Republic) (JoJo Rabbit – Scarlett Johansson)\n\nKathy Driscoll, Francine Maisler, Douglas Aibel (NY), Matt Bouldry (Massachusetts) (Little Women – Florence Pugh)\n\nAllison Jones (Bombshell – Margot Robbie)\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nEllen Lewis (The Irishman – Martin Scorsese)\n\nShayna Markowitz (Joker - Todd Phillips)\n\nNina Gold (1917 - Sam Mendes)\n\nVictoria Thomas (Once Upon A Time In… Hollywood – Quentin Tarantino)\n\nHeidi Levitt (Parasite – Bong Joon Ho)\n\nThis list was compiled by J.C. for the Secret Actor Society\n\nCasting Directors who would have been considered for the Oscar in 2008\n\nDay 3 of our 10 day countdown…Wouldn’t it be great if the Academy Awards finally included a category for casting directors?
