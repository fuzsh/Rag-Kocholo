        "text": "This year’s Cannes Film Festival has just concluded. Even though I myself was not in attendance, it has been a lot of fun diving into the reception of all the movies that screened. It played out very differently from how I anticipated, particularly in how back-loaded the festival was in terms of high quality titles, but even the films that had disappointing reception still garnered a lot of interesting chatter. I thought that I would recap Cannes while also updating my 2025 Oscars predictions. I will first talk about the prize winners at this year’s festival before I touch upon the most notable titles that were buzzed about as potential awards contenders prior to the fest’s start as well as those that gained traction after they screened. After that, I will discuss some significant developments since the last Oscars predictions I posted back in March before finally revealing my updated predictions. Let’s get started!\n\nIn what is becoming a historic run, NEON won the Palme d’Or for the fifth time in a row with Sean Baker’s latest film Anora. I had very high expectations for this as someone who loves Baker’s work like Tangerine and especially The Florida Project, however I did not anticipate that it would be a contender to win the top prize at Cannes and instantly become an Oscars hopeful. NEON’s last four Palme d’Or-winning films were Anatomy of a Fall, Triangle of Sadness, Titane, and Parasite, three of which went on to be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, with Parasite winning all three. I am thrilled to see Baker get his moment in the spotlight alongside his lead actress Mikey Madison. Anora got rave reviews across the board, a wave of praise that was welcome to see since at the time when it premiered, it was the first title of Cannes to garner unanimous acclaim after several films received reviews that ranged anywhere from generally positive to harshly negative. With the film winning the top award of the festival, it has immediately catapulted into the Oscars conversation.\n\nAs for the other awards, the Grand Prix went to Payal Kapadia’s All We Imagine As Light, a film that screened late during the festival and was side-by-side with Anora as perhaps the most acclaimed film of Cannes. Janus Films picked up the US distribution rights and I am eager to see it later this year. The Jury Prize and Best Actress award both went to Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez, with the Actress prize being shared between the film’s ensemble consisting of Karla Sofía Gascón, Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz. This one seemed like a pretty big crowdpleaser which got picked up by Netflix so perhaps they will mount an awards campaign either for the film itself or for its cast, notably Gascón and Saldaña. The Best Actor award went to Jesse Plemons for Yorgos Lanthimos’s Kinds of Kindness. Reception to the film was really solid, but it appears that your enjoyment will depend on if you prefer his darker films like The Lobster, Dogtooth, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer or if you prefer his extravagant collaborations with Tony McNamara with The Favourite and Poor Things. I happen to love both modes of Lanthimos so I anticipate that I will be an enthusiastic fan. Best Director went to Miguel Gomes for Grand Tour, a film that seemed to get mostly positive reviews, although it left some audience members cold. Coralie Fargeat won the Best Screenplay prize for one of the buzziest titles of Cannes, The Substance. This body-horror satire got some of the most intense discourse of the festival from emphatic praise to vehement rage. Even so, most critics seemed to be raving about the film which will be coming out in September from MUBI.\n\nPerhaps the most notable thing that happened at Cannes was the screening for The Seed of the Sacred Fig. The director Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran after receiving a heinous eight-year prison sentence along with his belongings being confiscated and flogging, all in response to his courageous activism through this film. He managed to make it to Cannes to attend the premiere for which he got a standing ovation both as he entered the theater and once the screening was over. Sacred Fig was met with extremely positive reviews with many deeming it to be the immediate favorite to win the Palme d’Or. Hell, NEON even bought the distribution rights so if it did win, it also would have continued the studio’s winning streak. While it may not have won any of the prizes mentioned before, the jury did give Rasoulof a special award for his screenplay, seemingly to acknowledge his cinematic accomplishment along with his titanic perseverance voyaging to the festival.\n\nOutside of the Cannes award winners, we have a few movies that were tipped to be Oscar contenders going into the festival that had mixed results. Probably the most acclaimed film of this batch was George Miller’s highly anticipated Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, which just opened in theaters this Memorial Day weekend after playing Out of Competition at Cannes. While not everybody was as blown away by this prequel as they were with Mad Max: Fury Road, those that were on board had a blast, myself included. Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office, although I do believe that it has some awards prospects in the technical categories as well as an outside shot in Best Supporting Actor for a career-best performance from Chris Hemsworth. Next is Andrea Arnold’s Bird which also had a mixture of some people feeling cold watching it while others were deeply moved. It sounds like a movie right up my alley and I cannot wait to see it. MUBI picked up the rights to that one. Parthenope is the latest film from Paolo Sorrentino which got picked up by A24 before the start of the festival. I took this to mean that it could be a strong contender for the Palme, but unfortunately reception was mostly negative, although some praised the cinematography and lead performance from Celeste Dalla Porta. Michel Hazanavicius premiered his film The Most Precious of Cargoes, the first animated film to play In Competition since 2008’s Waltz with Bashir. However, it appears that reviews were mixed and that festival attendees were more taken by Flow from the Un Certain Regard section, tipping that as a potential Best Animated Feature contender.\n\nTwo final films to discuss from the lineup. First up, lets talk about the “megaflopolis” in the room. In my last Oscar predictions, I mentioned that I had been skeptical of Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, not only its awards prospects but more importantly the film’s quality, but I was swayed at the 11th hour by first reports of an internal screening of the film going very well. As it turned out, I should have taken that first report with a grain of salt because literal days after I posted my predictions, word got out that buyer screenings had gone horribly and that Coppola was struggling to find a US distributor. So even before the festival began, I was regretting including the film in my predictions down the ballot. After it premiered, I extra regret it because while some cinephiles are taken by the bold swings and are just happy to see a new movie from a cinematic legend, it appears that both those who love and hate Megalopolis agree on one thing: it ain’t touching the Oscars. Even many of the positive reviews seem to stem from enjoying it on a “so-bad-it’s-good” level. Many critics absolutely hated it. As of writing this, there is still no US distributor on the film even though some international markets have picked it up and IMAX seems to be committed to doing a limited run in the US whether it gets distribution or not.\n\nSpeaking of controversial films that have no US distribution, the last Cannes film that I will discuss is Ali Abbasi’s Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice. This being an election year with Trump at the forefront of the conversation, plenty of eyes were on this film, for better or worse. Abbasi was an interesting director for this project because this seems so different from his previous two films, Border and Holy Spider. While both of those movies were well received to varying degrees, I happen to not be a fan of either of them so my expectations were low for this. Many people had this in their Best Picture predictions going into Cannes and sure enough, this was another film that garnered mixed reviews. Some seemed to be taken by the performances by Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong as well as the different approach to directing a biopic. Others criticized it for being a surface-level exploration of how Trump came to be and thought that, especially given the timing of this film, it was criticized for being low hanging fruit that preaches to the choir rather than having anything interesting to say. Controversy sparked almost immediately when Trump’s legal team sent a cease and desist letter in an attempt to bar the movie from being released due to the monstrous acts it depicts him committing in the film. Sure enough, it still has no distributor. I still stand by my thoughts last time that I think, no matter what press it gets, that The Apprentice will fall short during awards season in large part due to an exhausting election cycle. Now it can just add to its baggage that it’s a mixed bag as a movie on its own terms.\n\nAs for outside of Cannes, we had some other notable developments. One of the biggest is that Searchlight announced that Tina Mabry’s The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat has now been confirmed to be a Hulu release, ejecting it from the Oscars race altogether. I struggled finding a Searchlight contender to put in my predictions last time and hedged my bets on this one. Now, I am going to wait an see what emerges from the studio’s slate later this year before I put one of their films in my top 10 predictions, although so far I am debating between Marielle Heller’s Nightbitch and Jesse Eisenberg’s A Real Pain. Another development was that my swing predicting Audrey Diwan’s Emmanuelle as this year’s international Best Picture contender was a big miss since it was not only absent from the Cannes lineup entirely, but was recently announced to world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in late September, meaning that it will also skip Venice, Telluride, and TIFF. So now it seems abundantly clear that it will not be Diwan’s ticket to the Oscars. Hopefully her next film will get her into the conversation. We had the trailer drop for Joker: Folie à Deux which got a lot of attention. I still remain apprehensive that it will repeat the overwhelming awards success of its predecessor, but I could see it either performing on par with another superhero sequel to a Best Picture nominee, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nLuca Guadagnino has Queer on the horizon possibly at Venice, but last month he also shook the film world with Challengers which I currently believe is the best film of the year. With the critical success of that film along with its solid box office numbers, that could manifest in boosting the awards prospects for Queer if that film similarly delivers as a representation of a great year for Guadagnino and his returning crew, or perhaps in awards recognition for Challengers itself. I also still feel great about my prediction last time that Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door will be ready for release this year as it has now finished shooting and has entered post-production. Filming lasted a little longer than his last feature Parallel Mothers so perhaps it might be cutting it close for Venice, but I could see it show up at TIFF or NYFF. RaMell Ross’s The Nickel Boys was given a prime October limited release date by Amazon MGM, suggesting that it will be making the rounds at the festival circuit. I have a feeling that is going to be a very hot ticket at whatever festivals it appears at. Many believed that NEON was going to heavily push Joshua Oppenheimer’s The End and while they may still go through with a hefty push for that film, I now struggle even more to see a path for that film in this awards season since their hands are full with both Anora and The Seed of the Sacred Fig. They have never gotten more than one film into Best Picture in a single year so for The End to break out, that would mean that NEON would have to successfully pull off getting *three* Best Picture nominations this year and I just don’t see it. And last but not least, just for fun, I added Twisters as a longshot possibility if it takes the summer movie season by storm… no pun intended.\n\nUpdates are going to go dark again soon as we will likely not have any major news on potential awards contenders until the fall festivals announce their lineups in late-June/early-July. Very shortly, I will be sharing my predictions for some titles I anticipate will show up at Venice, Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF. That will likely come sometime in mid-June. The rankings in each graphic were included with the help of the screengrab feature from Brother Bro’s Award Expert app, an incredibly useful tool for predictions that I highly recommend that people download on iOS and Android.

Last week, I reviewed my predictions to see how the Oscars panned out compared to what I predicted. So let’s reset the clock and start from the beginning again. Like last year, this is just for fun. I put a lot of thought into what films I have my eye on this year, but I am absolutely certain that things will drastically shake up as we start seeing these films and discovering titles that weren’t even on our radar at this time. At this time last year, the vast majority of people had no idea that Anatomy of a Fall or American Fiction would be Best Picture nominees. So I am excited to see how these predictions evolve and change throughout the year. Also, the rankings included in each graphic were included with the help of the screengrab feature from Brother Bro’s Award Expert app, an incredibly useful tool for predictions that I highly recommend that people download on iOS and Android. With that down, time for predicting!\n\nThe top two films I have in Best Picture seem to be a consensus top two among people making early predictions since they are the two highest profile films that people have actually seen. Most people are predicting Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two as the early frontrunner for Best Picture, understandably so as Villeneuve exceeded expectations, surpassing the quality of the first on every level. I think it is fair to consider that the film can match the awards success of its predecessor and add a Best Director nomination this time. I am taking that approach right now until we have a firmer grasp on what the slate looks like later in the year and reassess how crowded each category is and see if Dune: Part Two can break through the competition. But right now, I feel more confident in placing Greg Kwedar’s Sing Sing in my #1 slot for Best Picture. I saw this movie at the TIFF world premiere last year and it ranked among the very best films I saw at the festival. A tremendous, life-affirming film that shines through its exceptional ensemble cast mostly comprised of former members of the RTA theater troupe that the film is based on and led by a career-best Colman Domingo. When thinking about the types of movies that are win-competitive in Best Picture, they almost always win either an acting prize, a screenplay prize, or both. Right now, I think both the phenomenal screenplay and the performances from Domingo and Clarence Maclin have the potential to win Oscars depending on competition. Unlike A24’s indie darling Past Lives from last year, I think that Sing Sing has higher potential for nominations across the board.\n\nWe have a slew of major titles coming out this year that are high on everyone’s radar, namely Steve McQueen’s Blitz and Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis. Starting with the latter, I was ready to dismiss this as yet another case like Ferrari and House of Gucci where an old school, legendary filmmaker has a film that on paper seems too big to fail that manages to fail spectacularly. And given how long it has been since Coppola has made a presence at the Oscars with any of his films, I figured that this would be a passion project that goes outside the creator’s grasps. But then last night, reports came out that a screening of the film with industry buyers, filmmakers, and very limited press played to a very enthusiastic response. So now, I have to consider the opposite narrative, where a filmmaker raises the money to finally fund his passion project and delivers his best film in decades. That is too juicy to pass up. So even though I had my reservations at first, I have now taken a 180 and put Megalopolis in my predictions down the ballot. As for Blitz, I think this makes sense as McQueen’s grand return to the Academy Awards after his Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave, but I am also curious to see how it performs considering that was his only Oscars success.\n\nThere are a number of major titles that I am not predicting for Best Picture that seem to be getting a lot of early traction. The biggest one is probably Todd Phillips’s Joker: Folie à Deux. The first Joker film was the nomination leader in its year and won two Oscars for Best Actor and Best Original Score. The sequel seems to be taking a lot of big, interesting swings, especially with being a jukebox musical and casting Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. I find myself fascinated by this movie, but I have a feeling that it will be one of the biggest talking points of the year that doesn’t get in at the end of the day. We already have Dune: Part Two as a high-profile sequel nearly guaranteed a Best Picture nomination and I doubt that Warner Brothers is going to split their resources to try to get two blockbuster sequels into Best Picture and risk cannibalizing each other. Two other franchise films that I am not putting into Best Picture are George Miller’s Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2. I cannot wait for Furiosa and I think it will get some nominations, but not as many as Fury Road. Gladiator 2 I think is going to suffer from the same problem as most other Ridley Scott films from the past couple decades and be a massive misfire.\n\nI came close to predicting Pablo Larraín’s Maria, especially due to feeling confident in its Best Actress potential for Angelina Jolie and Best Cinematography, but I think it is going to fall just short like Jackie did. Edward Berger’s Conclave was hard not to include because it seems to be Focus Features’s top player this far out, but I have become wary of predicting the follow-up feature to a director’s first time at the Oscars and even though All Quiet on the Western Front was a huge success, that doesn’t mean that his next film is a guaranteed hit either. The teaser for Yorgos Lanthimos’s Kinds of Kindness got me psyched and I want to believe that it can be a Best Picture nominee, but this looks to be closer in line with The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer so I am going to remain cautious about its chances until it screens. A lot of people are extremely confident in Ali Abbasi’s The Apprentice, understandably so, but I cannot get myself to predict a movie about Donald Trump to be nominated for Best Picture in what is sure to be an exhausting election year where he is front and center.\n\nI settled on the following films to fill out my first Best Picture predictions: Audrey Diwan’s Emmanuelle, Robert Zemeckis’s Here, RaMell Ross’s The Nickel Boys, Luca Guadagnino’s Queer, Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door, and Tina Mabry’s The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat. There is a question mark on whether Almodóvar’s film will be ready by the end of the year as it is shooting right now, but his past few films show that his productions move by very quickly. For example, his last feature, Parallel Mothers, shot in March-April 2021 and was ready to premiere in Venice in the beginning of September that year. This is his first English-language feature film and I suspect that it could break through in a big way at the Oscars this year, especially with stars like Tilda Swinton, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro attached. Guadagnino found awards success with Call Me By Your Name, but his filmmaking is an acquired taste. That being said, I will take the risk and believe that Queer will mark his return and that it might finally bring Daniel Craig into the conversation of Best Actor. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor stars in both The Nickel Boys and The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat and I think both films could be festival favorites, one with an emotionally devastating story that can deeply resonate with audiences, and the other a heartwarming crowdpleaser. The latter film has rumors that it might be going to Hulu through Searchlight, but to my knowledge that stems from Wikipedia rather than an official studio source.\n\nI finally watched Audrey Diwan’s last film, Happening, this week and found it to be one of the most harrowing films I had seen in years, finding a delicate balance between tackling its subject matter of abortion with visceral authenticity and a delicate sensitivity. I think people are underestimating her film Emmanuelle. I know that the Oscars tend to look the other way with more risqué sexual content unless from a filmmaker that they already love, but this has the potential to be a moving portrait of female sexual liberation that reclaims and recontextualizes the perception that the source material served only as pornography, evidenced by the erotic film franchise that it spawned. That same delicate hand that made Happening into such a triumph, and a Golden Lion winner at Venice, could create something really special that speaks to a lot of people this year. Who knows, maybe it can be this year’s annual NEON Palme d’Or winner at Cannes.\n\nEasily the biggest WTF pick in my Best Picture predictions is Here. The recent slate of Robert Zemeckis films that, aside from the odd good film here or there, range from bad to worse. So why do I have it in Best Picture? Simply, it’s Eric Roth writing the screenplay. His last five films have all been nominated for Best Picture, even a movie as poorly received and frankly disastrous as Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. The film also reunites Zemeckis with Roth who wrote his Best Picture winner Forrest Gump, along with that film’s lead stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, and even its composer Alan Silvestri. I also realized that I was feeling far too comfortable with the picks I was making in my predictions and I thought I should go for one that makes me feel a bit uneasy. This could so easily flop, but for some reason I have a feeling that this could be one of those high risk-high reward predictions that could be fun to try out early in the year and see if it pays off later.\n\nThere are so many more films that I haven’t even discussed that I have my eye out for. Films like Joshua Oppenheimer’s The End, Andrea Arnold’s Bird, Malcolm Washington’s The Piano Lesson, David Lowery’s Mother Mary, Clint Eastwood’s Juror No. 2, Robert Eggers’s Nosferatu, Duke Johnson’s The Actor, and so many more. I am also extremely excited to find out about titles that I hadn’t even heard of that come out of the film festivals. This year seems to have such a wide spectrum of contenders with less heavy hitters than we had at this point last year. I cannot wait to see what changes over the next several months and to see all of these films for myself.

The Venice Film Festival begins on Wednesday, the Telluride Film Festival on Friday, and the Toronto International Film Festival starts next Thursday. We also have the full lineup for the New York Film Festival which begins on September 29th. As such, this is the last opportunity to predict the Oscar nominations before we get first official reactions to a slew of major titles still to come. As fate would have it, we also had a major shake-up in this year’s race since, due to the AMPTP’s inability to offer a fair deal to the striking writers and actors, Warner Brothers has made the spectacularly moronic decision to delay the release of Denis Villeneuve’s hotly anticipated Dune Part Two from its November 3rd release date this year to March 15th, 2024. This devastating delay has now opened up slots across multiple categories. In my July predictions, I had Dune Part Two in 10 categories with a win in Best Visual Effects. I will take this opportunity to take some bold swings across the board right before we get word over the next few weeks about the quality of so many of this fall’s titles.\n\nStarting with the Venice lineup, we will be hearing reactions to films such as Pablo Larrain’s El Conde, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Evil Does Not Exist, Michael Mann’s Ferrari, Richard Linklater’s Hit Man, David Fincher’s The Killer, Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Yorgos Lanthimos’s Poor Things, and Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla. There are several question marks in here that I am very curious to hear first reactions to, in particular Ferrari and Priscilla as those might turn out to be sleeper contenders that surprise us. Currently, I am expecting great things from Poor Things and Maestro, the two films in the Venice lineup that I have in my top 10 for Best Picture. We recently got our first teaser for Maestro which made me hold firm in my expectations that this will be the big player from Netflix, Bradley Cooper’s ticket to finally winning an Oscar, and potentially a strong contender for Carey Mulligan in Best Actress. As for Poor Things, the film has one of the most extensive festival runs, hitting Venice, NYFF, and potentially Telluride. This, paired with Searchlight’s early December release date, gives me confidence to believe that the film will be to The Favourite what Nightmare Alley was to The Shape of Water: the beloved nomination leader and a well-liked follow-up that is mostly tech player.\n\nWe will not have the official Telluride lineup until Wednesday morning, however premiere designations at other film festivals next month can clue us into what titles we should expect to pop up. Some of the films that we can expect to see make their world premiere include Andrew Haigh’s All of Us Strangers, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin’s NYAD, and George C. Wolfe’s Rustin. There has also been heavy speculation that both Jeff Nichols’s The Bikeriders and Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn will premiere here. Interestingly, I am not anticipating any of these films getting a Best Picture nomination. Originally, I was pretty confident in Saltburn‘s chances, but I am perplexed by the film currently only being rumored to play at Telluride, skipping the other three major fall festivals. It is opening the London Film Festival which on its surface is a good sign, however the last time a film opened the festival and got nominated for Best Picture was The Imitation Game in 2014. I wanna hear those first first reactions to this one before I go all in on it. Some films that are expected to make a stop here after a previous world premiere are Poor Things, Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, Wim Wenders’s Perfect Days, and Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest.\n\nI will be flying out to Toronto next Wednesday for TIFF, excited to see this year’s extensive lineup. Surprisingly, there aren’t many world premieres this year that I anticipate being major contenders, although I have my eye on Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction and Taika Waititi’s Next Goal Wins as potential surprises. I am even predicting a lone Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for American Fiction. There is the world premiere of Craig Gillespie’s Dumb Money, but I anticipate that film will flop with critics. We also have films like Anatomy of a Fall, Evil Does Not Exist, Hit Man, The Holdovers, NYAD, Perfect Days, Rustin, and The Zone of Interest attending the fest. Going into the festival, most believe that The Holdovers will win the People’s Choice Award due to it being a potential crowdpleaser and thanks to talent like Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and Alexander Payne. Interestingly, tickets to the film are not selling nearly as well as other titles like Anatomy of a Fall, Dumb Money, Next Goal Wins, or The Zone of Interest. It will have to rely on good word out of Telluride to pick up buzz, but I’ve always had a feeling that this film would be the major contender that everyone believes in but falls short at the end of the day. By far the hottest ticket of TIFF is Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron, the opening night film of the festival. All five public screenings have gone off-sale prior to tickets becoming available to the general public and it is easily the most shortlisted title among users on the scheduling website TIFFR. I predict that the hype is so strong that the film will go all the way and win the People’s Choice Award. And if it does, with the track record of every year’s recipient getting a Best Picture nomination since Silver Linings Playbook back in 2012, I have put it in my Best Picture lineup. I will see for myself when I go to TIFF next week!\n\nNYFF’s lineup is very interesting. The only film that has a world premiere slot that might end up surprising is Garth Davis’s Foe. However, based off of the trailer, I do not anticipate this film making a dent at all in the awards race. In a deviation from previous years, we have four main galas. The Opening Night, Centerpiece, and Closing Night Galas are Todd Haynes’s May December, Priscilla, and Ferrari respectively. This year, we have a newly introduced Spotlight Gala which will be Maestro, screening at the David Geffen Hall, the venue where Leonard Bernstein himself lead the New York Philharmonic for many years. There have been times where none of the galas were nominated for Best Picture, but it is usually a good bet to predict at least one of them to get in. Like I mentioned earlier, I have Maestro in my Best Picture lineup so that covers that side of NYFF. In the Main Slate and Spotlight sections of the festival, some of the titles include the previously mentioned All of Us Strangers, Anatomy of a Fall, The Boy and the Heron, Evil Does Not Exist, Hit Man, Perfect Days, Poor Things, and The Zone of Interest. Of those titles, I also have Anatomy of a Fall, The Boy and the Heron, and Poor Things in my Best Picture predictions. By the time NYFF starts, we will already have a clearer picture on what fall fest titles will be top contenders and which ones have fallen.\n\nAs for the films that have already released, I still feel strongly that we will see Best Picture nominations for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Celine Song’s Past Lives and Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The passion for these four films remains so strong that I think not only will critics rally behind them once they deliver their top 10s at the end of the year, but I believe awards bodies will nominate all four of them consistently. I have swapped Past Lives and Oppenheimer in my rankings, joining many other awards pundits in placing the latter as the frontrunner to win Best Picture. Oppenheimer has the type of momentum that we rarely see nowadays and even though it is dangerous to go with the consensus frontrunner this early in the year, I simply do not see a more believable alternative at this point. We shall see if the fall festivals and the rest of the year shake things up. Also with the absence of Dune Part Two, that opens up plenty of opportunities for Oppenheimer to win many below-the-line categories as well as a window for its release date companion Barbie to be Warner Brothers’s new top contender depending on the strength of Blitz Bazawule’s The Color Purple this Christmas. Even though I now do not have Past Lives in the top spot for Best Picture, I still think it will have a hefty nomination haul and that it’s the clear frontrunner in Best Original Screenplay. As for Spider-Verse, some may question my decision to have two animated features in Best Picture considering the Academy’s history of only nominating three animated films in their 95-year history for the top prize. To that I say that I am playing with fire and rolling the dice on a big risk. We’ll see how that pays off.\n\nAs a reminder from my last predictions, I stand firmly with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA in their fight for a fair deal. As a show of support, I am including a link for people to donate to the Entertainment Community Fund which helps workers who need financial support as they strike. If you are in any capacity to do so, donate here. If you are unable to donate, then I highly encourage you to share the link around and get the word out to help the WGA and SAG-AFTRA. Also throughout my continued coverage of this upcoming awards season, through all the changes it will have, I have decided to rearrange the categories and start with the screenplay and acting categories and will continue starting with those categories in future updates until the AMPTP reaches a deal with these guilds. None of these films are possible without the hard work of all the writers and actors who made these films and I want to prioritize shining a spotlight on their work. The studios need to recognize the value of artistry and pay them what they’re worth. I hope that they come to their senses sooner rather than later, compensate everyone who is on the picket lines, and make an agreement with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA so that all the writers and actors can get back to work and know confidently that they are protected.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nPast Lives – Celine Song\n\nBarbie – Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig *\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – Arthur Harari and Justine Triet ↑+1\n\nAir – David Scarpa ↑+1\n\nThe Boy and the Heron – Hayao Miyazaki ↑+1\n\n—\n\nSaltburn – Emerald Fennell ↓-3\n\nMaestro – Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer ↑+1\n\nMay December – Samy Burch ↓-1\n\nHit Man – Richard Linklater and Glen Powell ↑+2\n\nFair Play – Chloe Domont ↓-1\n\nThe Holdovers – David Hemingson ↓-1\n\nPerfect Days – Takuma Takashi and Wim Wenders ↑+3\n\nBottoms – Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott ↓-1\n\nRustin – Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black\n\nAsteroid City – Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola ↓-2\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon – Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese\n\nOppenheimer – Christopher Nolan\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse – Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Dave Callaham ↑+1\n\nAll of Us Strangers – Andrew Haigh ↑+6\n\nAmerican Fiction – Cord Jefferson\n\n—\n\nPoor Things – Tony McNamara\n\nNext Goal Wins – Taika Waititi and Iain Morris\n\nOrigin – Ava DuVernay\n\nThe Killer – Andrew Kevin Walker ↑+3\n\nFreud’s Last Session – Mark St. Germain ↓-1\n\nThe Zone of Interest – Jonathan Glazer\n\nThe Nickel Boys – RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes ↑+1\n\nThe Bikeriders – Jeff Nichols ↑+1\n\nThe Color Purple – Marcus Gardley and Marsha Norman ↑+1\n\nFerrari – Troy Kennedy Martin (RE-ENTRY)\n\nDROPPED OUT:\n\nDune Part Two – was #3\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nBradley Cooper, Maestro\n\nCillian Murphy, Oppenheimer\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nColman Domingo, Rustin\n\nBarry Keoghan, Saltburn\n\n—\n\nKoji Yakusho, Perfect Days ↑+3\n\nPaul Giamatti, The Holdovers ↓-1\n\nTeo Yoo, Past Lives\n\nElliot Page, Close to You (NEW)\n\nAndrew Scott, All of Us Strangers ↑+2\n\nJeffrey Wright, American Fiction\n\nMichael Fassbender, The Killer ↓-2\n\nDavid Strathairn, A Little Prayer\n\nAnthony Hopkins, Freud’s Last Session ↑+1\n\nMatt Damon, Air ↓-1\n\nDROPPED OUT:\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir, Bob Marley: One Love – was #7\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nSandra Hülller, Anatomy of a Fall\n\nCarey Mulligan, Maestro ↑+3\n\nFantasia Barrino, The Color Purple ↓-1\n\nGreta Lee, Past Lives ↓-1\n\nMargot Robbie, Barbie ↓-1\n\n—\n\nEmma Stone, Poor Things\n\nNatalie Portman, May December\n\nAnnette Bening, NYAD\n\nPhoebe Dynevor, Fair Play ↑+4\n\nTeyana Taylor, A Thousand and One ↓-1\n\nCailee Spaeny, Priscilla ↑+3\n\nAunjanue Ellis, Origin ↓-2\n\nKate Winslet, Lee ↓-2\n\nJessica Lange, Long Day’s Journey Into Night ↓-2\n\nJessica Chastain, Memory\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nRyan Gosling, Barbie\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer\n\nRobert De Niro, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nJohn Magaro, Past Lives\n\nGlenn Howerton, BlackBerry\n\n—\n\nCharles Melton, May December\n\nWillem Dafoe, Poor Things ↑+1\n\nPaul Mescal, All of Us Strangers ↑+1\n\nJacob Elordi, Saltburn ↑+1\n\nMark Ruffalo, Poor Things ↑+1\n\nJamie Bell, All of Us Strangers ↑+1\n\nColman Domingo, The Color Purple ↓-5\n\nMatt Damon, Oppenheimer\n\nBen Affleck, Air\n\nRichard E.

The AMPTP is still refusing to offer a fair deal to both guilds consisting of pay raises, increased residuals, secure healthcare benefits, AI regulation, and many more important issues to writers and actors. The WGA strike began on May 2nd and the SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14th. Since the actors went on strike, nearly all productions have halted, films like Dune Part Two, The Color Purple, and Next Goal Wins have considered delaying release dates, films like Challengers, Poor Things, and Drive-Away Dolls did delay their release dates, actors have now stopped doing all promotion for struck work like Barbie and Oppenheimer, and all the upcoming fall festivals are looking to have their actors presence severely diminished through films like Poor Things, Maestro, and The Killer. I stand firmly with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA in their fight for a fair deal.\n\nAs a show of support, I am including a link for people to donate to the Entertainment Community Fund which helps workers who need financial support as they strike. If you are in any capacity to do so, donate here. If you are unable to donate, then I highly encourage you to share the link around and get the word out to help the WGA and SAG-AFTRA. Also throughout my continued coverage of this upcoming awards season, through all the changes it will have, I have decided to rearrange the categories and start with the screenplay and acting categories and will continue starting with those categories in future updates until the AMPTP reaches a deal with these guilds. None of these films are possible without the hard work of all the writers and actors who made these films and I want to prioritize shining a spotlight on their work. The studios need to recognize the value of artistry and pay them what they’re worth. I hope that they come to their senses sooner rather than later, compensate everyone who is on the picket lines, and make an agreement with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA so that all the writers and actors can get back to work and know confidently that they are protected.\n\nNow onto my updated Oscar predictions starting with this year’s screenplay contenders. I am feeling confident that we have a frontrunner in Best Original Screenplay with Celine Song’s Past Lives. Her screenplay is so soulful and moving, nothing even comes close. We do have other contenders in the game like Arthur Harari and Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, David Scarpa’s Air, and Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn. That last title still has yet to have an announced festival premiere, although Venice Film Festival director Alberto Barbera mentioned in a recent interview that he believes the film is making its world premiere at Telluride.\n\nAdapted Screenplay does not have a clear frontrunner at the moment, but it seems like a battle between Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. As a matter of fact, those two films have solidified themselves as surefire Best Picture frontrunners with Oppenheimer being a smash success at the box office and one of the most critically raved films of the year. The film is absolutely extraordinary and its screenplay is one of the biggest attributes to its success. Other Adapted Screenplay contenders include Jon Spaihts and Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Part Two (if the AMPTP reaches a fair deal and Warner Brothers maintains its November release date), Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Dave Callaham’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction which just got announced for a TIFF world premiere.\n\nOne interesting case is Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, already on its way to being the highest grossing movie of the year. I fully believe that the film, which is incredible, will get a screenplay nomination. The only question is if it’s original or adapted. Many are suggesting that it is adapted because the film is based on the Barbie toy, but my argument is that it is not based on a previously existing book or movie. The closest comparison I could find was The Lego Movie which is based on the Lego toy but was campaigned as an original screenplay. Now it ultimately was not nominated at the Oscars so we do not know how they would have ruled, but I am going to trust my instinct and say that it will campaign in Best Original Screenplay.\n\nNow onto the actors. We have now seen performances from both Barbie and Oppenheimer which all surpassed out highest of expectations. Everyone went into both movies expecting Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer and Ryan Gosling in Barbie to be Oscar worthy and they 100% delivered. But now, we have to add Margot Robbie in Barbie and Robert Downey Jr. in Oppenheimer to the lineups because both actors deliver what could be the best performances of their careers. We even have Supporting Actress potential with Emily Blunt in Oppenheimer and America Ferrera in Barbie, both of whom I thought were terrific. I think the Gosling vs Downey battle is going to be one of the most exciting this awards season.\n\nI still have Bradley Cooper in Maestro as the frontrunner in Best Actor despite now believing that he has incredibly strong competition from Cillian Murphy. Maestro has just been announced to have its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival In Competition, an upgrade from his previous film A Star Is Born being Out of Competition. There is also heavy speculation that the film could be attending the New York Film Festival which would be an incredible sign of confidence. Everything I have heard about the performance has been exceptional and I have complete faith that Cooper will knock it out of the park. Alongside him and Murphy, I am predicting Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon, Colman Domingo in Rustin (which will have its world premiere at Telluride followed by TIFF), and Barry Keoghan in Saltburn.\n\nThe default Best Actress frontrunner has been Fantasia Barrino in The Color Purple, but my faith in that film has declined since I cannot predict three Warner Brothers films to get nominated for Best Picture and now I have both Dune Part Two and Barbie. So I made a switch to now predicting Sandra Hüller in the Palme d’Or winning Anatomy of a Fall. Her performance has been praised through the roof and I see a path forward for her being the critics sweeper at the end of the year. I am also predicting for a nomination Greta Lee in Past Lives, Margot Robbie in Barbie, and Carey Mulligan in Maestro.\n\nThe Best Supporting Actor race looks to be down between Ryan Gosling in Barbie and Robert Downey Jr. in Oppenheimer. I found both performances to be outstanding on every level, but I am giving the edge to Gosling’s hysterical comedic turn as Ken. He is a scene-stealer in every sense of the word and I believe that he is going to have the most vocal support throughout awards season. Filling out the category I expect will be Robert De Niro in Killers of the Flower Moon, John Magaro in Past Lives, and a dark horse prediction for Glenn Howerton in BlackBerry. I know that last one is wishful thinking, but let me have this one!\n\nSupporting Actress still seems to be prime for Lily Gladstone in Killers of the Flower Moon. There is still a possibility that either Danielle Brooks or Taraji P. Henson in The Color Purple could become top tier contenders, but the raves for Gladstone are so strong that I highly doubt that anyone can surpass that level of praise. Filling out the category, I am predicting that Emily Blunt gets nominated for Oppenheimer as well as Julianne Moore for May December, although part of me also wants to include America Ferrera for Barbie whose third act monologue is absolute dynamite.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nPast Lives – Celine Song\n\nBarbie – Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig *\n\nSaltburn – Emerald Fennell ↑+1\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – Arthur Harari and Justine Triet ↑+3\n\nAir – David Sca"
