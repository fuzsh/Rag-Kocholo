        "text": "The Critics Choice Association — of which Above the Line critics Edward Douglas and J. Don Birnam are both members — has announced the nominations for its 29th Annual Critics Choice Awards, which will be handed out on Sunday, Jan. 14, 2024 at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles, with the ceremony also being broadcast live on The CW.\n\nGreta Gerwig‘s Barbie and Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer – collectively known as “Barbenheimer” — continued to dominate with nominations in many categories, although the three songs nominated from Barbie puts it ahead with the most nominations — 18 total. That may be the most nominations for a single film in Critics Choice history.\n\nAlthough the Critics Choice doesn’t split its categories into “Comedy/Musical” and “Drama” ala the Golden Globes, there were many categories in common, although America Ferrara was nominated for Barbie over Rosamund Pike for Saltburn, despite the latter getting into the Best Picture nominations. Sterling K. Brown was nominated in the Best Supporting Actor over Poor Things‘ Willem Dafoe, who received a Golden Globe nomination. Both Poor Things and American Fiction were well-represented in the nominations, as was Martin Scorsese‘s Killers of the Flower Moon. Bradley Cooper received three nominations in the Actor, Director, and Screenplay categories.\n\nUnlike the Golden Globes, the Critics Choice also honor many of the below-the-line creatives that work hard on making films with most of the ten Best Picture nominees being represented for their crafts.\n\nYou can read the full list of Critics Choice film nominations below:\n\nBest Picture\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPast Lives\n\nPoor Things\n\nSaltburn\n\nBest Actor\n\nBradley Cooper – Maestro\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nColman Domingo – Rustin\n\nPaul Giamatti – The Holdovers\n\nCillian Murphy – Oppenheimer\n\nJeffrey Wright – American Fiction\n\nBest Actress\n\nLily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nSandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall\n\nGreta Lee – Past Lives\n\nCarey Mulligan – Maestro\n\nMargot Robbie – Barbie\n\nEmma Stone – Poor Things\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSterling K.
