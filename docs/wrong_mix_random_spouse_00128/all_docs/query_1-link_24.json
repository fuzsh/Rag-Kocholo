        "text": "In a Hollywood studio where Bernard Herrmann had been supervising the recording of his score for Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver , it had been suggested that the session be finished the following day. Herrmann insisted, however, that it be completed.\n\nApril 24, 2006, was the first performance of The New York Philharmonic under the direction of John Williams in a program of selections from the conductor's and Bernard Herrmann's film scores. The Herrmann selections, hosted by Martin Scorsese, were played in the first half of the program, and the rest of the program was devoted to music by John Williams."
