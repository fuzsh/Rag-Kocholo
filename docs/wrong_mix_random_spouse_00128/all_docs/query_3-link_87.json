        "text": "The best Martin Scorsese movies comprise one of the greatest filmographies in history. Fellow \"movie brat\" Steven Spielberg may be the greater crowd-pleaser – and considerably more successful at the box office – but the director of GoodFellas, Raging Bull, and The Wolf of Wall Street has cemented his reputation as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation.\n\nWe've looked back through the 26 movies of his career so far, and ranked the best Martin Scorsese movies from worst to best. It's an eclectic selection, featuring historical dramas, thrillers, musicals, and a single excursion into family-friendly territory. But again and again, his most memorable works have tended to put the spotlight on flawed men navigating morally ambiguous, criminal worlds – often in his native New York. Fortunately, most of the list is available to stream on some of the world’s best streaming services across the US, the UK, and Australia.\n\n26. Boxcar Bertha\n\nRelease date: June 14, 1972\n\nRuntime: 88 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R18+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Tubi, Pluto TV with ads (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK and Aus)\n\nOne of Scorsese’s earliest movies, Boxcar Bertha is the Bonnie and Clyde-esque story of a pair of train robbers-slash-lovers (played by Barbara Hershey and David Carradine) as they go on the run. Although it pre-dates Mean Streets (widely regarded as the director's first classic), this Roger Corman-produced outing shows off some of the talents that Scorsese would later hone to spectacular effect.\n\nThat said, watching Boxcar Bertha half a century after its original release, it's clear he hadn't yet found his directing mojo. So – while there's not really a weak link when it comes to the best Martin Scorsese movies – this is definitely one to file among the lesser entries in the director's filmography.\n\n25. Kundun\n\nRelease date: December 25, 1997\n\nRuntime: 134 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG-13 (US) / 12 (UK) / PG (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: N/A\n\nWe don’t really talk about Kundun… Scorsese’s depiction of the 14th Dalai Lama (the one we all know) and the plight of Tibet threw him into some hot water politically, and almost led to ties being severed between Disney and China’s leaders. Scorsese was banned from ever entering the country again, while Disney reportedly did a deal to open Shanghai Disneyland to patch things up.\n\nFormer Disney CEO Michael Eisner came to regret the whole affair. “The bad news is that the film was made,\" he said. \"The good news is that nobody watched it.”\n\n24. Who’s That Knocking at My Door\n\nRelease date: November 15, 1967\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US, UK, and Aus)\n\nPart of Scorsese’s student project at NYU and his first ever movie, Who’s That Knocking at My Door, was shot in 1967 in gritty black-and-white.\n\nA young Harvey Keitel fronts the movie as J.R., a man who shuns his girlfriend when he learns she isn't a virgin as he'd previously believed. It's set in the Italian-American communities Scorsese grew up in, and the director explores the themes of Catholic guilt that have been a hallmark of his long career.\n\n23. New York, New York\n\nRelease date: June 21, 1977\n\nRuntime: 155 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG (US) / PG (UK) / N/A (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: N/A\n\nAfter the dark, bleak brilliance of Taxi Driver, few would have predicted where Scorsese went next. New York, New York stars Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro as a singer and saxophonist respectively embarking on a romance as they chase fame. This movie signified a considerable shift from the stony realism Scorsese had become known for.\n\nThe director had wanted to pay homage to the musical side of Hollywood, but the results drew mixed reviews from critics. The making of New York, New York coincided with the sharp end of Scorsese's troubles with cocaine, and production was a mess. The movie subsequently ran over budget and flopped at the box office, thus finding its position here in our best Martin Scorsese movies ranking.\n\n22. Bringing Out the Dead\n\nRelease date: October 22, 1999\n\nRuntime: 121 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R18+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Hoopla, The Criterion Channel (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK) / N/A (Aus)\n\nIn the mid- to late-’90s, Nicolas Cage followed up his Oscar-winning arthouse success on Leaving Las Vegas by turning action hero in The Rock, Con Air and Face/Off. This 1999 collaboration with Scorsese though brought the actor back into more serious, dramatic territory – albeit with a supernatural edge.\n\nIn Bringing Out the Dead, Cage stars as Frank Pierce, an ambulance paramedic haunted by the patients he couldn’t save. As Pierce struggles to retain his sanity over three tumultuous and nightmarish evenings, Scorsese creates some epic shots depicting the paramedic's hallucinations, against the murky backdrop of New York’s Hell’s Kitchen.\n\n21. The Color Of Money\n\nRelease date: October 17, 1986\n\nRuntime: 119 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US and UK) / Disney Plus (Aus)\n\nThe Color of Money brings two screen icons together, as Paul Newman and Tom Cruise share the screen in the only sequel of Scorsese's career, a belated follow-up to 1961 Newman classic The Hustler. It's the tale of ageing pool wizard \"Fast\" Eddie Felson as he passes on his knowledge to a young pretender, though it's easy to see the real-world parallels as Hollywood legend Newman passes the baton on to Cruise.\n\nSet in a pool hall, it’s all about learning the tips and tricks of the hustle. Scorsese is arguably more focussed on potting balls than popping bad guys, but it's very ’80s, very hammy, and very fun.\n\n20. After Hours\n\nRelease date: September 13, 1985\n\nRuntime: 157 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Roku, The Criterion Channel (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK and Aus)\n\nScorsese spent most of the 1980s working in New York, the city where he has produced his finest work. After Hours, shot in the city’s SoHo district, has become known for being an integral part of cinema’s ‘yuppie nightmare’ genre. In simple terms, a yuppie nightmare is when a young professional comes under threat.\n\nIn this case, ordinary data entry worker Paul Hackett (An American Werewolf in London's Griffin Dunne) finds himself embroiled in a horror evening strung together by a series of unfortunate events. He’s invited to visit a girl he meets in a coffee shop and there lies the last normal part of his evening. The timeline quickly turns into one full of threats, assault, and kidnapping.\n\n19. Hugo\n\nRelease date: November 23, 2011\n\nRuntime: 126 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG (US) / U (UK) / PG (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Hoopla (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK and Aus)\n\nIn the best Martin Scorsese movies, it's unusual to see a family movie, but Hugo is the exception – and a wonderful excuse for the director to express his love for the dawn of cinema.\n\nSet in Paris in 1931, Hugo tells the story of the titular orphan (played by Asa Butterfield, who'd go on to star in Sex Education) living secretly in the Gare Montparnasse. While servicing the railroad station’s clocks, he uncovers a mystery regarding his late father (Jude Law) and discovers a mechanical automaton that sends him on a quest involving silent movie pioneer, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). It’s lightyears away from Scorsese’s usual style, as well as being his first foray into 3D, which was all the rage back in 2011 after the colossal success of the original Avatar.\n\n18. The Age of Innocence\n\nRelease date: October 1, 1993\n\nRuntime: 139 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG (US) / U (UK) / G (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US and Aus) / Rakuten TV with ads (UK)\n\nWhen it comes to Scorsese movies set in New York, we’re used to seeing the mean streets, mobs, and crime of the lower classes. With The Age of Innocence, Scorsese shows that whatever his protagonists' position in society, the Big Apple remains his playground.\n\nThe Age of Innocence is a tale of 19th century high society adapted from the novel of the same name by Edith Wharton. The story follows Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), who – after marrying the safe, but uninspiring May Welland (Winona Ryder) – becomes infatuated with the mysterious Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer). It's a movie that proves Scorsese’s ability to direct love, as well as hate.\n\n17. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\n\nRelease date: December 9, 1974\n\nRuntime: 112 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG (US) / 15 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US and UK) / Binge, Foxtel Now (Aus)\n\nFollowing on from her iconic role in The Exorcist, Scorsese cast Ellen Burstyn in the titular role of Alice Hyatt. She clearly also did a stellar job in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1975.\n\nAlice is a widowed, single mother who embarks on a journey across the southwest US with her young son, in the hopes of becoming a famous singer, and winds up falling in love with a local rancher (Kris Kristofferson). The pace is slowed down and the emotion turned up as Scorsese steps away from his trademark stylistic violence. The result is a simple tale of a mother and her son trying to move on as best they can.\n\n16. Silence\n\nRelease date: December 23, 2016\n\nRuntime: 161 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US) / Apple TV Plus (UK) / Foxtel Now, Beamafilm (Aus)\n\nScorsese developed Silence for over 25 years, finally committing to make the movie after finishing The Wolf of Wall Street in 2013. Up to this point, Scorsese had also worked on The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun, taking on themes of religion and struggles of faith.\n\nIn Silence, two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) travel to Japan to spread the Catholic faith in a time where such acts were punished. Scorsese clearly made the most of the quarter-century he spent developing the movie, and that's reflected as the film unfolds across nearly three hours of considered storytelling.\n\n15. The Last Temptation of Christ\n\nRelease date: August 12, 1988\n\nRuntime: 164 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Prime Video (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK and Aus)\n\nIt's the gospel according to Martin, as Scorsese adapts the New Testament for the big screen. With Willem Defoe as Jesus and Harvey Keitel as Judas, it stirs up plenty of controversy along the way.\n\nIndeed, Scorsese took some big risks with The Last Temptation of Christ, and was hit with plenty of criticism for depicting the Gospel in the way that he saw fit, depicting Jesus as a flawed man struggling to spread his teachings.\n\n14. The Aviator\n\nRelease date: December 25, 2004\n\nRuntime: 170 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG-13 (US) / 12A (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Prime Video, Apple Plus TV, Hoopla (US) / N/A (UK) / Binge (Aus)\n\nYou’ll start to notice a trend as we head into to the upper echelons of our list of the best Martin Scorsese movies, as Leonardo DiCaprio becomes his most frequent collaborator – much as Robert De Niro was in the first half of the director's career.\n\nIn DiCaprio's second Scorsese outing (after Gangs of New York), the Titanic star plays infamous filmmaker, businessman, aviator and – eventually – recluse Howard Hughes, in a sumptuous biopic set during Hollywood's golden age.\n\nLauded for being an honest representation of a man struggling to cope with his meteoric rise in fame, and affected by his own mental health issues, The Aviator is a great representation of why Scorsese and DiCaprio have become one of Hollywood's most reliable partnerships.\n\n13. Shutter Island\n\nRelease date: February 19, 2010\n\nRuntime: 138 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US) / Netflix (UK) / Stan (Aus)\n\nYou won’t know whether you’re up or down once you’ve visited the remote asylum of Shutter Island in this impressive adaptation of Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel.\n\nUS Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) travels to the eponymous hospital for the criminally insane to investigate the escape of a woman who drowned her own children. Scorsese keeps you wondering what's real and what's not throughout, in a neo-noir psychological thriller that frequently teeters on the brink of full-on horror.\n\n12. Cape Fear\n\nRelease date: November 15, 1991\n\nRuntime: 128 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Starz (US) / BBC iPlayer (UK) / Prime Video, Paramount Plus, Foxtel Now (Aus)\n\nScorsese remakes the 1962 crime classic, Cape Fear, with Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte taking on roles originally played by Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck – both of whom cameo here.\n\nDe Niro plays convicted rapist Max Cady, released from prison after 14 years and out to avenge himself on Sam Bowden (Nolte), the lawyer who defended him in court. De Niro is utterly chilling as he portrays Cady's terrorization on Bowden and his family, in a gripping and taut thriller. The film was memorably homaged in \"Cape Feare\", one of our best Simpsons episodes, in which a vengeful Sideshow Bob sets out to kill Bart.\n\n11. The King of Comedy\n\nRelease date: December 18, 1982\n\nRuntime: 109 minutes\n\nAge rating: PG (US, UK, and Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Paramount Plus, FuboTV (US) / Disney Plus (UK and Aus)\n\nOnce again, Robert De Niro takes on the lead role for another of the best Martin Scorsese movies, but he'd never before played anyone quite like desperate stand-up comedian Rupert Pupkin, a man totally obsessed with fame and the idea of appearing on a late night TV talk show.\n\nMore than four decades after its original release, The King of Comedy remains a remarkably prescient satire on fandom, celebrity culture and the quest for fame at all costs. As Pupkin plots with fellow fan Masha (Sandra Bernhard) to kidnap TV star Jerry Langford (played by real-life comedian Jerry Lewis), he sets himself on an unstoppable descent into chaos. The result is a movie that's sometimes painful to watch, but masterful in its execution.\n\nThe King of Comedy was also a major influence on Joker, one of the entries in our best superhero movies guide.\n\n10. The Irishman\n\nRelease date: November 1, 2019\n\nRuntime: 209 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix (US, UK, and Aus)\n\nFinanced to the tune of a whopping $160 million budget by Netflix, Scorsese was finally able to shoot a movie he’d been planning for more than a decade. The director used the cash to tell the story of hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) and his decades working within the Buffalino crime family, and for teamster union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).\n\nThat mega-budget allowed Scorsese to unite regular collaborators De Niro, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel with The Godfather legend Pacino, as (sometimes questionable) de-ageing VFX allowed them to play their respective characters at different stages of their lives. Not as great as the standout mafia classics that top our best Martin Scorsese movies list, perhaps, but The Irishman is still a hugely impressive piece of work that takes a spot on our best Netflix movies list.\n\n9. Gangs of New York\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2002\n\nRuntime: 167 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Max (US) / MGM (UK) / Foxtel Now (Aus)\n\nIt’s 1862 and the roost that is New York is ruled by warring gangs, Irish Catholics, and American Protestants hell-bent on taking each other out in some incredibly gory ways. After his father is stabbed to death, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) swears revenge on the killer – Bill ‘The Butcher’ Cutting.\n\nStill fresh off Titanic, DiCaprio was king of the world when Scorsese cast him for the first time, but the standout performance in Gangs of New York belongs to The Age of Innocence star Daniel Day-Lewis as the chaotic, terrifying and unbelievably violent, Cutting.\n\n8. Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nRelease date: October 20, 2023\n\nRuntime: 206 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 15 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Apple TV Plus (US, UK, and Aus)\n\nFor the second film in a row, Scorsese is bankrolled by Apple TV Plus picking up the tab for a powerful adaptation of David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name. Telling the true story of the Osage people murdered for their oil in 1920s Oklahoma, Scorsese puts the spotlight on a shameful moment in American history, directing with sensitivity and restraint.\n\nWith a running time just short of three-and-a-half hours, Killers of the Flower Moon is a long, sprawling affair, but also gripping from start to finish. The film's notable for bringing Scorsese mainstays Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio together on screen, but the movie is stolen from under their noses by a memorable and heartbreaking performance from Golden Globe winner Lily Gladstone.\n\n7. The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nRelease date: December 25, 2013\n\nRuntime: 180 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R18+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Paramount Plus (US) / Netflix (UK) / Netflix, Prime Video (Aus)\n\nScorsese teams up with Leonardo DiCaprio for the fifth time, and this dramatisation of the true story of stockbroker and financial criminal Jordan Belfort may just be the best of their collaborations in the best Martin Scorsese movies.\n\nComing in at almost three hours long, The Wolf of Wall Street follows a similar structure to Casino and GoodFellas, as Scorsese has fun with Belfort's excessive lifestyle and rise to the top, before bringing everything crashing down to earth with a massive, drug-fuelled thud. It's also the movie that launched Barbie’s Margot Robbie on the path to Hollywood stardom.\n\n6. Casino\n\nRelease date: November 22, 1995\n\nRuntime: 178 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: FuboTV, Starz, MGM (US) / Prime Video (UK) / Prime Video, Paramount Plus (Aus)\n\nWhat happens in Vegas? Scorsese reunites his GoodFellas dream team of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and also takes Sharon Stone and James Wood on this memorable trip to Sin City.\n\nCasino operator Sam Rothstein (De Niro) does his best to manage a gambling empire while falling for former prostitute Ginger McKenna (Stone), and negotiating a complicated friendship with mobster Nicky Santoro (Pesci). Despite some obvious narrative similarities it's not quite as good as GoodFellas itself – but hey, what is?\n\n5. The Departed\n\nRelease date: October 6, 2006\n\nRuntime: 151 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Prime Video, AMC (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK) / Foxtel Now (Aus)\n\nScorsese remakes 2002 Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs, and belatedly wins himself the Best Director Oscar he was denied for GoodFellas and Raging Bull. Even though The Departed isn't quite top-tier Scorsese, there's no question it's up there with the best crowd-pleasers of the director's glittering career.\n\nIn this high-concept cop drama, cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes undercover with the Boston mafia. Meanwhile, mob mole Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police while supplying information to his boss, Frank Costello (a wonderfully over-the-top Jack Nicholson). The result is a twisty, high stakes game of cat-and-mouse (or, rather, cat-and-cat) that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It also features a brilliant, Academy Award-nominated performance from Mark Wahlberg as the angry – and very sweary – Staff Sergeant Dignam.\n\n4. Mean Streets\n\nRelease date: October 14, 1973\n\nRuntime: 112 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Tubi (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK and Aus)\n\nMean Streets is Scorsese's first true classic and the film where his career started to build critical momentum. It's certainly a considerable step up from previous movies Boxcar Bertha and Who's That Knocking at My Door, though the director did take Harvey Keitel, his leading man from the latter, along for the ride. This is also the first film in his enduring partnership with Robert De Niro.\n\nMean Streets is a tale of mafiosos in Little Italy, where petty criminal Charlie (Keitel) fights to protect his friend, Johnny Boy (De Niro), after he finds himself in deep water with sinister loan sharks. Torn between his Catholic faith and working for his mob boss uncle, he struggles to find the balance between conflicting values – a theme that has cropped up repeatedly through some of the best Martin Scorsese movies.\n\n3. Taxi Driver\n\nRelease date: February 8, 1976\n\nRuntime: 114 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / R18+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US, UK, and Aus)\n\nDisillusioned with society, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) drives the dirty, violent streets of 1970s New York City, filled with a deep-set rage. His fury and hatred for the rich who ride in his cab leads him to assassination attempts on both a presidential candidate and a pimp.\n\nLead actors Robert De Niro and Cybill Shepherd both agreed to take pay cuts for this low-budget movie, and they deliver outstanding performances throughout. It's an uneasy, often brutal watch, but stands up as one of the best Martin Scorsese movies of them all.\n\n2. Raging Bull\n\nRelease date: December 19, 1980\n\nRuntime: 129 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / M (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: FuboTV, MGM, Hoopla (US) / available to rent and/or buy (UK) / SBS On Demand, MGM (Aus)\n\nYet another collaboration with Robert De Niro, sports biopic Raging Bull tells the true story of champion boxer Jake LaMotta, whose personal demons lead to the breakdown of his personal relationships, his arrest, and – bizarrely – a stand-up comedy career.\n\nScorsese was initially reluctant to work on the story, but after developing the script alongside De Niro and Taxi Driver screenwriter Paul Schrader, he crafted a bona fide classic. Shooting the film in gorgeous black-and-white and soundtracking key moments with opera classics, the director finds artistry in the most brutal of sports. De Niro also won an Oscar for his performance, for which he famously gained 60lbs to play the older, overweight LaMotta.\n\n1. GoodFellas\n\nRelease date: September 18, 1990\n\nRuntime: 145 minutes\n\nAge rating: R (US) / 18 (UK) / MA15+ (Aus)\n\nWhere to stream: Available to rent and/or buy (US) / Sky, Now (UK) / Netflix, Binge, Foxtel Now, Stan (Aus)\n\n“As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster…” Even as mobster Henry Hill watches his friends shoot and stab a soon-to-be corpse in the trunk of their car, Ray Liotta’s voiceover gives seedy organised crime a thrilling and entertaining edge.\n\nCharting decades of mafia life through Hill’s eyes, Scorsese’s career-defining drama is a violent, sweary, frequently funny rollercoaster ride that finds the humanity in men who wouldn’t think twice about killing anyone who looks at them a bit funny. In a career packed with bona fide classics – he even recycled the GoodFellas formula in the nearly-as-good Casino and The Wolf of Wall Street – this crime drama is arguably the masterpiece in a career defined by classics. The best Martin Scorsese movie? We think so."
