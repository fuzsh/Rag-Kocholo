        "text": "“Twenty-four was I when I was blacklisted, thirty-six when it ended. My ingenue years were gone, and my leading years almost over. Facing forty, I was beginning again.” It’s one of the memorable quotes actress/director/documentary maker Lee Grant wrote in her astonishing 2014 autobiography, “I Said Yes to Everything: A Memoir” (Blue Rider Press), a very brave, honest, courageous, and open-hearted account of her long life on the stage, and in and out of motion pictures. Ms. Grant gathered four Academy Award nominations (winning two, including one as a documentary maker), seven Emmy nominations (two wins), five Golden Globe nominations, a Directors Guild Award, and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her screen debut in William Wyler’s “Detective Story” (1951) which she received when she was already out of work because of the witch hunt that interrupted her film career for more than a decade. How could that possibly be? What had happened to one of the most promising new faces and probably one of the most enduring young actresses who started her motion picture career in the early 1950s?\n\nThe elegant theater and screen actress wrote it all down in her book’s nearly 500 pages, an absorbing life story with many ups and a few downs, which I recently started reading on a Monday evening and finished it by Tuesday morning. Ms. Grant has a fascinating way with words. To me, her life has not only been dominated by the blacklist for more than a decade—undoubtedly a terrible phase in her life and the way she handled it, she can look back at it with her head up high and with great pride—”I Said Yes to Everything” basically tells the story of an incredible achievement that Ms. Grant was able to accomplish. Only a few actors, directors, or screenwriters who had been blacklisted ever made it back, while she made it even bigger after being blacklisted than she had been before. Her stunning comeback in front of the camera included her Emmy Award-winning performance as Stella Chernak in the TV series “Peyton Place” (1965-66, 70 episodes). She revived her film career when she appeared in several interesting movies and worked on various ambitious projects which earned her all the awards and honors as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Not only did she get noticed—she was hailed, praised, and welcomed with open arms by the Hollywood film community.\n\nThis was the most perfect and waterproof response she could give, after the incredible damage the HUAC (short for House Un-American Activities Committee) had done to her and so many other actors, screenwriters, directors, etc.—so many people, families, and careers all suffered severely, some tragically, as a result of the blacklisting—but ultimately Ms. Grant really showed them. For her, it all began in the early 1950s when she and J. Edward Bromberg, a founding member of the Group Theatre and an actor with a heart condition, appeared in a play called “They Knew What They Wanted.” Called to testify before the HUAC, he took the Fifth Amendment and was promptly blacklisted. Within months he died of a heart attack, only a few weeks before his 48th birthday. At his memorial, Ms. Grant gave a moving eulogy, saying that the HUAC ‘knew he had a bad heart and kept calling him to testify anyway. I feel the committee ultimately killed him.’\n\nTwo days later, her name appeared in ‘Red Channels’ (a pamphlet which named all the blacklisted people, you can find them here). By then, Ms. Grant, a native New Yorker, born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal, who first emerged on Broadway, debuting in 1949 as a shoplifter in the play “Detective Story” (which earned her The Critics’ Circle Award right away), had a film career that was over after only one film. But twelve long years later, she was ‘cleared’ and made a tremendous comeback. Not only did she survive the witch hunt, but she also turned her career into a very thriving one after the blacklisting was all over.\n\nShe then played both leading and supporting roles on the screen, without ever becoming a real movie star, but Ms. Grant is a woman of substance who turned out to be one of the best, most talented, and most reliable character actresses of her generation—and beyond—with an incredibly sensitive, artistic and creative quality and potential.\n\nBut first her autobiography. Although published two years ago, it is a timeless account of many struggles and career twists for multiple lives.\n\nMs. Grant, when reading your autobiography, it’s very clear that you turn out to be a wonderful and natural writer, and most of all, it’s a brave and honest memoir. If I’m correct, you all wrote it down by hand, didn’t you?\n\nYes, that’s correct. I don’t use a typewriter or a computer, so everything was written by pen and ink by my little desk. It took me four years to complete it, and as you can see, it wasn’t an easy book to write.\n\nThe first thing I thought after I had finished reading it was what a brave and courageous woman you are: blacklisted for twelve years, then coming back the way you did, winning two Academy Awards as well as numerous other awards. You were again recognized as a highly acclaimed actress and, later on, also as a first-rate director. So, in other words, you really are a survivor, aren’t you?\n\nYes, I’m happy to say that I am a survivor. I think the twelve years of the blacklist created the woman I am. When I was young and still lived at home, I only thought about acting, which was everything to me. Then all of a sudden, everything was taken away from me. Being a stepmother of two boys later on [after her marriage to screenwriter Arnold Manoff in 1951], I became very strong—the opposite of Cinderella, which is what I felt like when I was nominated for an Oscar for “Detective Story” [1951, dir. William Wyler] and was the Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. But when I heard about that, I couldn’t work in film or television anymore. And I was only twenty-four at the time—and a very young twenty-four. So I think those twelve years were my education, and without them, I would not have become the woman I am now. But after they took my career away from me—and I was an immensely successful young actress back then—after they did that, what else could they do? They couldn’t imprison me, so it freed me in a way because I had nothing to lose after that. I had no film career anymore, but I still had Broadway because there was a contract between the Actors Equity and the Broadway theater producers never to have a blacklist in the theater. With that open to me, and with the New York theater community being so rich, loyal, and beautiful, it freed me to learn how to fight. You know, all the directing I did and all the documentaries I’ve done were based on learning how to stand up for myself and for others. It turned out to be a great education a little Jewish girl could get.\n\nAs an actress, what were the standards you used to accept or turn down a role?\n\nWell, it depended. If I needed the job to have money during the blacklisting, I took anything in the theater I could get, and I was very fortunate in the roles that I was offered in every period. I also started teaching at the Uta Hagen acting school to earn a living.\n\nWhen you appeared in front of the camera again after the blacklist, you played several memorable roles in films such as “In the Heat of the Night” [1967] and “The Landlord” [1970]. When did you decide to become a director?\n\nWell, I am grateful for those parts, and for the Oscar I got for “Shampoo” [1975], being in my late forties, and I made films as “Airport ’77” [1977], “Damien: Omen II” [1978] and “The Swarm” [1978] when I had to yell endlessly ‘The bees are coming!’ Then I realized I had run out of Hollywood time for the kind of parts they had given me. I knew I had to start a new life, I wanted to, and I was ready to use my own voice. That’s when I decided to direct, with films such as “Tell Me a Riddle” [1980] and the HBO documentaries, like “Down and out in America” [1986, which earned her a second Academy Award as Best Documentary Feature], which I like. I think they’re all great.\n\nThe Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on March 29, 1976, with Ms. Grant, feeling like a bride, winning her Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress in Hal Ashby’s “Shampoo”\n\nWhat did they teach you at the Neighborhood Playhouse in the late 1940s?\n\nWhen I went to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, I found the road into myself, a belief system, and a way to transform into whatever character. I was given a chance to explore, and the exploration was mind-blowing to me. The doors that opened in me as an adolescent were so astonishing, rewarding and fulfilling, that it was like a religion to me. Finding [acting teacher] Sanford Meisner, and finding all these emotions that I never used before… Having done them in a classroom where it was okay, all of that training and learning just kicked the door open in me and it stayed with me for the rest of my life. That was my fortune, and that’s what I learned [other actors who studied under Mr. Meisner’s instructions, include Gregory Peck, Sydney Pollack, Steve McQueen, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Mary Steenburgen].\n\nI always thought you were one of the best character actresses of your generation. Would you agree with that?\n\nWell, I chose to be a character actress very early. I sensed that carrying a play as the leading lady… I was offered the ingenue role in “Detective Story,” that’s what I looked like. I was a pretty girl, but the lines of the ingenue were so insipid that I couldn’t even say them. I just started laughing. So that’s when I asked, ‘Can I play the 40-year-old lady?’ I knew that character from the Neighborhood Playhouse with one of my assignments to go on a bus to listen to people. So that character that I had found in acting school is what I brought to the play. One of the things I realized by turning down the ingenue and on insisting doing the character part instead, was that this character was not only much more interesting, but I also didn’t have to worry about what I looked like, I didn’t have to carry the play, or when I started into films, I didn’t have to be the one bringing in the money. That’s what the people who play the leading roles in movies have to do. If the movie doesn’t bring in the $40,000,000 that it was supposed to, and only brought in $20,000,000—that has nothing to do with how good an actress is in the part, it only has to do with the box office. I never ever entered that game, so being a character actress myself, I never wanted to put myself in the position of having to star and make money for the studio. You know, I worked with Faye Dunaway in “Voyage of the Damned” [1976], and after that, she did “Network” [1977], which won her an Oscar. It was a wonderful movie, and later on, she did a lot of other great movies, but then she made a movie once which didn’t make money, and her agent told me what they were saying about her in the viewing room in the studio. She had become old, this and that—the raising up of a female idol and then the destruction of her by the same business people who had built her, is just terrible. I was wise enough never to be pulled into that orbit.\n\nIs there anyone who inspired you to become a director? Maybe Hal Ashby, because you speak very highly of him in your book.\n\nI adore him. He was such a wonderful character outside of the system, and the work that I did with him, was also so brilliant outside of the system [“The Landlord,” 1970; “Shampoo,” 1975]. The 1970s and 1980s produced many brilliant film directors, they took over, and I was fortunate enough to be there at that time to work with them and to see such fresh things happening. But for me, directing started by accident. The AFI [American Film Institute] called me. They were forming their first-ever women’s directing workshop, and they asked if I could recommend anybody. I thought, why not try it myself, just go and see, and it was just a huge turn of a life experience for me. There was this play by August Strindberg called “The Stronger” that so fascinated me—only three pages—it was an amazing and remarkable piece of work. It’s only with two women, one stays silent through the whole play, and she’s the stronger. It was a great experience for me to make it, and that was the start of it. I fell in love with it, and then everybody seemed to want to help me. Did you ever see “Tell Me a Riddle” [1980], the movie I made with Melvyn Douglas and Lila Kedrova? How lucky I was to have this as my first feature film to direct. Those performances… they were geniuses. It was such a meeting of minds; we had Tillie Olsen’s story, we were able to inject all that political stuff, and we started to say—through the film—all of the things that I needed to say. That was a great experience.\n\nWhat advice would you give to young actors who start in this business?\n\nI would say, ‘Learn how to be a waiter.’ That’s what so many actors and actresses do. There is really not a lot of work for all the young people who go to Columbia and NYU—I taught there, you know. A lot of those young people are talented, but what kind of space is there in the theater? How big is off-Broadway? Who’s making the movies? How gorgeous do you have to be? What is the lifetime of a young actor today, even the ones who make it in Hollywood? What’s the lifespan? So I don’t know how to answer that question. All I know is that when I was heading the Actors Studio, I saw so much talent that was being unused, people who did beautiful work there and weren’t given a chance to do it on the outside.\n\nDo you also still go out to see a movie?\n\nYou know, since I got an Oscar, they send the films to me to see, so that I can watch them at home. Recently I saw one that I loved very much, “Nocturnal Animals” [with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal]. I thought it was fascinating. And I know there are also good documentaries out there that I haven’t watched yet.\n\nIn 1980, I saw your daughter Dinah Manhoff in “I Ought to Be in Pictures” on Broadway. She’s no longer acting, is she?\n\nShe had been on some very successful television series [including “Empty Nest,” 1988-1995] and when she stopped getting work, she quit acting. But she teaches now, she puts on plays, and she’s a brilliant director. She walked away the same way I did. No more LA, and she has a great life now.\n\nYou’ve been awarded a lot during your career. How important are all your awards to you?\n\nEach one at that time was like saying, ‘I’m still here.’ Each award was like being able to say to the blacklisters, ‘So where are you now, what are you doing?’ I was getting awards for being there, and I survived them, so those awards meant a lot to me. And I still feel that way. But, let me ask you something, when did you first see me acting?\n\nThat was in the mid-1960, in “Peyton Place.”\n\nSo I’m sure you fell in love with the character I played, bad Stella Chernak!
