Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker renowned for his gritty portrayals of American culture.

Since the 1970s, he has crafted a body of work that is bold and brilliant, though often demanding and intense. Known for working with substantial budgets and Hollywood's top stars, he has a reputation as a cult director with mainstream resources.

His most renowned films, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, and The Irishman, are considered cinema classics with numerous Oscar nominations.

Surprisingly, Scorsese — born in 1942 in Queens, New York — himself won his first and only Oscar for directing The Departed in 2007, four decades after his debut film premiered.

His latest project, Killers of the Flower Moon, reunites him with Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. It tells the true story of a series of overlooked killings in 1920s and 1930s Oklahoma, where indigenous Native Americans were brutally murdered in a ruthless land grab for the oil beneath their settlements.

Celebrated as one of the most acclaimed American directors in the history of cinema — Francis Ford Coppola recently dubbed him 'the world’s greatest living filmmaker — Scorsese built a remarkable body of work over the decades, but who are Scorsese's most frequent collaborators?

Harry Northup | Six appearances

Like Argo’s, Harry Northup's roles in Martin Scorsese's films tend to be brief, often spanning only a scene or two. Some of the roles he took lacked names, such as 'Soldier' in Mean Streets and 'Bartender' in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.

He appeared in the first six films directed by Scorsese, commencing with Who's That Knocking at My Door in 1967 and concluding with New York, New York in 1977.

Barbara De Fina worked closely with Scorsese on numerous projects, including Casino, The Age of Innocence, and Cape Fear.

Born in New Jersey in 1949, she began working as a producer in the low-budget filmmaking industry and married Scorsese in 1985, their marriage lasted six years.

"A lot of editors and directors do fight over movies. He trained me after all - I know what he likes and he doesn't."

Catherine Scorsese

In the Scorsese cinematic world, a frequent collaborator was't an actor — it was Martin Scorsese's own mother, the late Catherine Scorsese.

Though not a professional actor, she took on roles like the mother of Joe Pesci's character in Goodfellas.

“All we told her to do was just welcome her son home; she hasn’t seen him in a while,” Scorsese said of his mother as reported in the IndieWire.

Her presence on screen was also not just acting, she became part of the crew and cast, even cooking for them and watched how her son became one of America's biggest directors.
