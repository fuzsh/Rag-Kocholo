        "text": "Jimmy Warshawsky, of Canyon Country, has emerged as one of the most talented young chefs on “Season Three of Masterchef Junior,” seen Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox (channel 11 in Santa Clarita).\n\nWarshawsky, 13, was among thousands of children who auditioned last year to appear on the series which features host and award-winning chef Gordon Ramsay and fellow judges restaurateur Joe Bastianich and acclaimed chef Graham Elliot.\n\nHe was chosen to be among the 19 best junior home cooks in the country between the ages of 8 and 13 to compete for the Masterchef Junior trophy and the $100,000 grand prize.\n\n“When you first walk into the ‘Masterchef Junior’ kitchen it is really scary,” said Warshawsky, who was age 12 when the competition was taped last spring. “When you see the judges standing there you wonder what they are going to say to you. But once you start cooking, and get to know them, they become less intimidating.”\n\nWarshawsky, an eighth grader at La Mesa Junior High School, said now that he knows the judges they are just “really famous friends.”\n\n“Masterchef Junior” debuted on Jan. 6. The finale will air on Feb. 24.\n\nCulinary competitions\n\nWarshawsky is among the final eight contestants on the show, surviving a variety of culinary competitions including several “mystery box” challenges, a meringue pie challenge, a sushi tag-team race and a sausage making challenge.\n\nTuesday’s episode (Feb. 3) of “Masterchef Junior” will feature Gordon Ramsay’s daughter, Matilda Ramsay presenting the young chefs with their elimination challenge.\n\nUpcoming episodes will feature the popular “restaurant takeover,” a crème brûlée challenge and the finale, where the top two young chefs will compete for the title of Masterchef Junior.\n\nWarshawsky said he has been watching cooking competition shows for years. He also likes watching Food Network.\n\n“I watched the adult ‘Masterchef’ and when ‘Masterchef Junior’ came out it seemed like an awesome show and I wanted to audition,” he said.\n\nDon’t miss a thing. Get breaking Santa Clarita news alerts delivered right to your inbox.\n\nCasting\n\nThe junior chef said he was given a skills test and an interview and was invited back for further tests, an on camera\n\ncooking demonstration and interviews.\n\n“As you continue in the process the skills tests get more advanced and the interviews get longer,” he said.\n\nWarshawsky estimated he was called back five times before he was cast on the show.\n\n“It is really hard to get on the show,” said Jimmy’s mother, Lisa Warshawsky. “It took nearly two months before he was cast.”\n\nHowever, once he was notified that he would appear on the show it was only days before taping began.\n\nWarshawsky had very little time to practice, or memorize recipes, before the competition started.\n\nThe young cooks were sequestered at a hotel in Universal City during taping of the competition, said Jimmy’s mother, Lisa Warshawsky.\n\n“They went to ‘set school’ for three hours every day, and also taped the show,” she said. “Some days were very long.”\n\nPraise\n\nDuring the run of the series to date, Warshawsky has earned praise from the judges for his vodka sausage Pappardelle dish and won the meringue pie challenge, earning him the right to push a meringue pie into the face of “Masterchef Junior” judge Graham Elliot.\n\n“That was the best feeling in the world when I won that challenge,” said Warshawsky. “Then to be able to throw the pie in Graham’s face was even more exciting.”\n\nIn last week’s episode Warshawsky was teamed with Ayla, 11, from St. Louis, Mo. and the duo won the tag-team sushi challenge.\n\n“It’s fun to make sushi,” he said.\n\n“Masterchef Junior” Judge Bastianich said the duo’s sushi was “the best we’ve ever had in this kitchen, even among adult contestants.”\n\nDo you have a news tip?

He said he enjoys “creative cooking.”\n\n“I make a lot of creative things with s’mores,” Warshawsky said. “That’s one of my favorite things to eat. I’ll make a s’mores cobbler or a s’mores tart.”\n\nLisa Warshawsky said her son also makes creative roulades.\n\n“He’ll take chicken or steak and roll up it up into puff pastry, that kind of thing,” she said.\n\nTo date Warshawsky has been up for elimination only once, during the “scary food” challenge, when he made an alligator fajitas with guacamole dish the judges thought was “too safe.”\n\n“It was really scary, I could have gone home,” said Warshawsky. “I was really glad I made it through.”\n\nWarshawsky said the “Masterchef Junior” experience as been very positive.\n\n“We’re all still great friends,” he said of his fellow competitors. “My phone is constantly buzzing with texts and phone calls.”\n\nWarshawsky said his ultimate goal in life is to have a “food empire.”\n\n“I want to have a cooking show and be the host and to have a bunch of restaurants worldwide,” he said.\n\n“That’s my goal and I’m working towards it.”\n\nOther interests\n\nWarshawsky has other interests in addition to cooking. He appeared in numerous theater productions in the Stagecraft for Kids afterschool enrichment program while attending Fair Oaks Ranch Community School and has worked as a professional actor on “The Haunted Hathaways” on Nickelodeon.\n\nHe is studying broadcast journalism at La Mesa and enjoys math, science and history.\n\nWarshawsky continues to practice his cooking skills by making dinner for his family three to four times a week.\n\n“Last night I made chicken wings,” he said. “Sometimes I’ll go fancier and make a Beef Wellington.”\n\n“It’s so delicious,” said Lisa Warshawsky. “It’s amazing.”\n\nWhat is Warshawsky’s signature dish? Almond Ricotta Pancakes with Almond Whip Cream.\n\nWarshawsky said he really appreciates the support he has been getting from people in the Santa Clarita Valley, as well as world-wide.\n\n“He’s been getting emails and Facebook friends from Viet Nam and Indonesia, from so many countries,” said Lisa Warshawsky."
