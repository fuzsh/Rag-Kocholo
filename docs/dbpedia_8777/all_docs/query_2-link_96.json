Citizen science is a type of volunteering in which individuals or organizations participate in one or more aspects of the scientific process. This work can also be known as community science, volunteer monitoring, and public participation in scientific research, among other names. In some cases you can participate remotely by using your computer or smartphone to analyze images of fish. In other cases you can participate in-person by reporting sightings of sea turtles. Volunteer observations have helped inform marine resource management efforts for several decades and continue to play a vital role in NOAA Fisheries’ research and monitoring.\n\nNOAA has more than 60 projects listed in the Federal Citizen Science Catalog.\n\nCitizen Science Opportunities Nationwide\n\nBe a marine scientist from anywhere—even your couch!

We recognize that this is not a short-term goal but one that requires a deliberate, sustained effort.\n\nOur Community\n\nNOAA Fisheries is a multi-mission, geographically dispersed agency responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and its habitat. Our workforce is made up of individuals with a wide range of characteristics and experiences who serve diverse communities across the nation. We maintain that the best scientific work is achieved through a community that values diversity and inclusion throughout the agency. We use the collective experience of all our staff to create a productive workforce that is a leader in creating and sustaining diversity and inclusion.\n\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\n\nUnderstanding that diversity and inclusion are essential to fulfilling our mission, we will strive to cultivate a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility, fairness and belonging. We recognize that employees, supervisors, and leaders at all levels play a critical role in realizing this vision.\n\nDefining Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity\n\nDiversity is the mixture of the unique attributes that shape an individual's identity which they bring into the workplace to help NOAA accomplish its goals. Diversity refers to demographic diversity (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation), experiential diversity (e.g., affinities, hobbies, and abilities), and cognitive diversity (e.g., sensory processing and problem solving).\n\nInclusion\n\nInclusion is a culture that values the unique attributes of all team members. It is an environment which is respectful, collaborative, supportive, and one that allows for equal access. Inclusion requires active and intentional engagement on the part of everyone and provides a feeling of belonging.\n\nGoals\n\nBe a vibrant and productive workforce\n\nMove the organizational culture to an inclusive environment where all employees are connected, respected, and have the opportunity to reach their full potential\n\nEnsure managers and supervisors foster employee engagement and promote diversity and inclusion in our workplace\n\nObjectives\n\nRecruit qualified individuals at all levels who are reflective of our nation’s diversity and whose diverse backgrounds, experience, education, and skills will advance NOAA’s mission\n\nProvide a full and fair opportunity for all employees and applicants, regardless of race, religion, gender, color, age, disability, national origin, genetic information, and sexual orientation\n\nStrengthen employee engagement to cultivate an inclusive culture\n\nEnsure all employees have equal access to career development opportunities\n\nExpand leadership and accountability for managing diversity and inclusion across NOAA\n\nWe will make every effort to enhance and promote practices that encourage employee engagement and empowerment. We will factor diversity into recruitment and succession planning, and increase work-life balance and developmental opportunities to foster retention. We will ensure performance management and other policies and systems are aligned with our vision of diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn addition to sustaining a more ecologically diverse marine environment, we recognize the importance of accountability for sustainable growth and development as an organization. By focusing on employee engagement and embedding diversity into the culture, we are able to help sustain a healthy and balanced work life for all. To do this, we will work to strengthen leadership’s commitment to a diverse and inclusive agency through accountability, data, and education. This in turn will help us institutionalize a culture of inclusion that can be sustained far into the future.\n\nLearn more about our National Program Office for Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity"
