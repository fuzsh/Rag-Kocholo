Carson Higginbotham of Clarksburg finished second with a two over par 144. Michael said of his Championship, “I’m happy to come out on top. Thanks go to the WVGA for a great event and to Guyan for being great hosts.”\n\nKerri-Anne Cook of Oceana came from a two-stroke deficit Monday to win the Girls Championship with a four-stroke lead over Taylor Sargent of Milton, Monday’s leader. Cook finished with a five over par 147. Cook said, “The weather held off and the course was beautiful.”\n\nParker O’Dell of Hurricane held onto his first-day lead to win the boys 13-14 division at eight over par 150. Audrey Kerr of Bridgeport won the girls 10-14 division with a 29 over par 171.

Congratulations to Kerri-Anne Cook, as well.”\n\n“Great hosts and a great venue at Guyan Golf and Country Club provided an amazing championship experience for our junior golfers this week” said WVGA Tournament Manager – Youth Operations Lucas Ware. “Thanks to Head PGA Professional Rick Ellison and General Manager Allan Thacker for allowing us to host one of my favorite events at their Club.”\n\nClick here for a complete list of today’s final scores."
