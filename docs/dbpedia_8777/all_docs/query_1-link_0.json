        "text": "American competitive reality television series\n\nThis article is about the American version of Junior MasterChef. For the whole series franchise, see Junior MasterChef. For the most recent season, see MasterChef Junior (American TV series) season 9.\n\nMasterChef JuniorGenreCookingBased onJunior MasterChefWritten byRobin AshbrookJudgesNo. of seasons9No. of episodes104ProductionExecutive producers\n\nBen Adler\n\nRobin Ashbrook\n\nPaul Franklin\n\nEden Gaha\n\nPatricia Llewellyn\n\nElisabeth Murdoch\n\nAdeline Ramage Rooney\n\nGordon Ramsay\n\nProduction companiesOne Potato Two Potato\n\nEndemol Shine North AmericaOriginal releaseNetworkFoxReleaseSeptember 27, 2013 ( ) –\n\npresent\n\nMasterChef Junior is an American cooking competition involving children from the ages of 8–13 that premiered on Fox on September 27, 2013. It is based on the format of the British series Junior MasterChef.\n\nIn October 2023, the series was renewed for a ninth season, with Gordon Ramsay, Aarón Sánchez and Daphne Oz as returning judges, along with new judge Tilly Ramsay. The season premiered on March 4, 2024.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nAny child between ages eight and thirteen can apply to become a contestant on the series by applying online or by going to an open casting call. The contestants are announced through a variety of methods over the years, sometimes via competitions, or sometimes the top contestants are simply announced.\n\nAs in its parent show MasterChef, the following challenges have all been regularly featured on the show:\n\nSkills Test: Cooks are challenged to prepare foods in accordance with a list of common cooking techniques or styles, or to replicate a particular cooking method of a dish (i.e. steaks done to an exact wellness). This type of test is also sometimes used as an Elimination Test.\n\nMystery Box: Cooks are all given a box with the same ingredients and must use only those ingredients to create a dish within a fixed amount of time. The judges will select three dishes based on visual appearance and technique alone to taste, and from these three select one winner who usually gains an advantage of some type in the elimination test.\n\nElimination Test: After the challenge is explained, judges evaluate all dishes based on taste and visual appeal. The judges nominate the worst dishes for elimination and criticize them before eliminating at least one contestant.\n\nTeam Challenge: The cooks are split into teams by either team captains or the judges. They often occur in a restaurant takeover or pop-up restaurant taking the place of the staff of a particular restaurant. Diners taste both meals and vote for their favorite. The winning team advances, while the losing team will participate in the Pressure Test or even face elimination based on team members' performance.\n\nPressure Test: Another form of the Elimination Test, in which losing team members compete against each other to make a standard dish within a very limited amount of time that requires a great degree of cooking finesse. Each dish is judged on taste, visual appeal and technique, and the losing chef is eliminated.\n\nOnce the competition is reduced to either the final two or three competitors, the finalists will compete against each other in a three-course cook-off. All courses of the meal are judged and an overall winner is crowned. The winner of each season wins $100,000, the MasterChef Junior trophy, and the title of MasterChef Junior. Some seasons have also added other prizes.\n\nJudges\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason Judge 1 Judge 2 Judge 3 Judge 4 1 Gordon Ramsay Graham Elliot Joe Bastianich — 2 3 4 Christina Tosi 5 Guest judges 6 Joe Bastianich 7 Aarón Sánchez 8 Daphne Oz 9 Tilly Ramsay\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nSpecials\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleOriginal air date [1]Prod.\n\ncode [1]U.S. viewers\n\n(millions)1\"An Extra Serving\"[2]April 27, 2017 ( )SP-17212.65[3]\n\nGordon Ramsay recaps the events of the past five seasons; moments from past seasons, as well as never-before-seen bloopers, were shown; contestants from seasons 1–3 talked about the events in the years since they competed; Ramsay talks with the previous winners.\n\n2\"The Road to the Finale\"[4]May 15, 2018 ( )SP-18201.74[5]\n\nGordon Ramsay takes a look back at the events of season 6 along with some clips and bloopers, and shows some of the audition videos submitted for the show.

For the sixth season, Bastianich returned to his judging position. In the seventh season, Bastianich left again and was replaced by Aarón Sánchez, who was one of the guest judges in season 5 as well as a judge on the adult MasterChef.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nFox placed casting calls for participants in January 2013.[27] Fox officially ordered the series (then under the name Junior MasterChef) on May 10, 2013.[28] The name was later changed to MasterChef Junior. There were concerns that Ramsay's style of cursing at the contestants on his other competition shows (most notably Hell's Kitchen and the adult MasterChef) would carry over to MasterChef Junior. It did not. One contestant (Gavin) said that Ramsay had only cursed twice during the production of the series and never at the contestants. In the final editing, he cursed once in front of (but not at) the contestants.[29]\n\nSeason synopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1 (2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season premiered on September 27, 2013, with chefs Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Joe Bastianich acting as the judges.\n\nThe winner of MasterChef Junior season 1 was Alexander Weiss, a thirteen-year-old from New York City.\n\nSemifinalist Troy Glass is now an actor, appearing on Kids React and other cooking shows, and making cameos on shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nSeason 2 (2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe second season premiered on November 4, 2014,[30] with chefs Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Joe Bastianich again acting as the judges.\n\nThe winner of MasterChef Junior season 2 was Logan Guleff, an eleven-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nSeason 3 (2015)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 5, 2014, MasterChef Junior was renewed for a third season before production on season two began.[31] The third season premiered on January 6, 2015,[32] with chefs Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Joe Bastianich once again acting as the judges.\n\nThe winner of MasterChef Junior season 3 was Nathan Odom, a twelve-year-old from San Diego, California.\n\nSeason 4 (2015–16)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fourth season premiered on November 6, 2015,[33] with chefs Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Christina Tosi acting as the judges.\n\nThe winner of MasterChef Junior season 4 was Addison Smith, a nine-year-old from River Forest, Illinois.\n\nSeason 5 (2017)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fifth season premiered on February 9, 2017, with chefs Gordon Ramsay and Christina Tosi acting as the judges, along with numerous guest judges including Julie Bowen and Mayim Bialik.[34]\n\nThe winner of MasterChef Junior season 5 was Jasmine Stewart, an eleven-year-old from Milton, Georgia.
