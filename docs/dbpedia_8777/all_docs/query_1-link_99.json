Posted five top-10 finishes including a T2 finish at the West Regional Championship. Helped her team to win the Lone Star Conference Championship. Honored by the Women's Golf Coaches Association (WGCA) as an honorable mention All-American.\n\n2020-21: Won her first college tournament at the West Texas A&M Fall Invitational, firing 72-71.

As a freshman, she overcame adversity and really showed how strong her game and mind is. Her experience winning state in high school shows that she knows how to make clutch shots under pressure to win. On a less serious note, she has an infectious laugh, which is great for a coach to hear when the team is together in the van and on the road traveling.\n\n2023-24 Results\n\nTournament Date Rounds Scores Par Finish Swan Memorial Sept. 8-9 3 73-76-77=226 +10 11th DBU Women's Classic Sept. 17-19 3 77-74-72=223 +7 T34th WT Fall Invitational Oct. 2-3 3 71-75-73=219 +6 7th Midwestern State Invitational Oct. 16-17 3 75-75-76=226 +10 T11th Rollins National Preview Oct. 30-31 2 70-76=146 +2 T13th Jack Brown Memorial Feb. 5-6 2 84-90=174 +30 T46th UCO Southern Invite Feb. 19-20 3 77-74-72=223 +7 15th St. Mary's Rattler Invitational Feb. 26-27 3 79-75-78=232 +16 T28th WT Desert Invite Apr. 1-2 2 80-79=159 +15 T37th RJGA Palm Valley Classic Apr. 5-6 2 68-70=138 -6 1st Lone Star Conference Championship Apr. 15-16 3 NA-75-76=151 +7 T28th NCAA West Regional May 6-8 3 72-72-71=215 -1 T5th NCAA National Championship May 21-23 3 75-77-71=223 +7 T46th\n\n2022-23 Results\n\nTournament Date Rounds Scores Par Finish WT Fall Invitational Sept. 9-10 3 75-72-70=217 +4 T13th DBU West Regional Preview Oct. 3-4 3 73-79-77=229 +13 T33rd UMSL National Preview Oct. 10-11 3 78-72-76=226 +10 T8th HPU Shark Shootout Oct. 25-26 2 82-74=156 +12 T34th Dennis Rose Intercollegiate Invitational Oct. 28-29 2 85-80=165 +21 T73rd Jack Brown Memorial Feb. 6-7 2 84-76=160 +16 T17th UCO Southern Invite Feb. 20-21 3 70-75-76=221 +5 T7th St. Mary's Rattler Invitational Feb. 27-28 3 78-74-74=226 +10 T5th RJGA Palm Valley Classic Mar. 31-Apr. 1 2 75-75=150 +6 T21st WT Desert Invite Apr. 3-4 2 82-76=158 +14 T9th Lone Star Conference Championship Apr. 24-25 3 72-75-71=218 +2 T13th NCAA West Regional May 8-9 3 71-68-67=206 -4 T2nd NCAA National Championship May 16-18 3 78-71-71=220 +4 T14th\n\nHistorical Player Information\n\n2020-21Freshman\n\n2021-22Sophomore\n\n2022-23Junior\n\n2023-24Senior"
