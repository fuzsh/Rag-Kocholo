        "text": "As I sat by Cecil in the hospital this past week, I realized it was time for me to gather some family facts to include in his obituary. I didn’t have a clue what to do so I Googled “How do you write an obituary?” I immediately found an article that gave lots of good tips and also provided a link to the obituary of a man named Joe Heller. It was the funniest obituary I’d ever read, and I changed everything I thought I needed to do. Instead of the usual listing of family members, who they were married to and where they lived, I decided to write the obituary in story form as I wanted everyone to know the real Cecil.\n\nEveryone’s heard about people who fought the good fight. That perfectly describes the attitude of Cecil Barnes Jr., who died July 5, 2024, from complications with his 20 year battle with Parkinson’s disease. As his disease progressed and he would be in obvious pain, I once asked him why he never complained. He replied, “Well, what good would that do?” And he never complained!\n\nBorn in 1947 to parents, Cecil Barnes Sr. and Kathryn (Kitty) Barnes, his life was colored by his parents’ experiences in the Depression and World War II. By that I mean he was always very frugal or maybe cheap is a better word. He cherished anything new he bought for himself. I remember finding him inspecting new shoes he had bought and then putting them back in the box until his other ones had truly worn out.\n\nHe loved gadgets, computers, and cell phones. He loved to use the program that could change the way you looked and would send the weirdest pictures to our granddaughter, Rachel. He had me take a picture of his head after he had deep brain stimulation surgery. He emailed that picture to Rachel and said he had gotten his hair cut. He once pranked our nephew, Roman, by photoshopping a picture of his face into the body of a chicken. Roman freaked out. I found hundreds of cords and computer stuff in boxes in the closet. When I’d try to get rid of the stuff, he’d always say he might need it sometime. I’m going to have him cremated with all the cords as nobody else would ever want them. He was always inventing things. When Leigh was four or five, she had a friend over to play. When they walked down the hall, they saw Cecil hanging upside down in his gravity boots from the attic stairwell. He would put on the boots, climb up the attic stairs and hook his feet into some device he had created. Then he would hold on to a rope hooked to the device and slowly lower himself down. He would hang like that for a while and then use the rope to haul himself back up into the attic. It’s a wonder that he didn’t fall and break his neck. He kind of freaked the little girl out, but Leigh just told her it was her dad and he was always doing that. I wonder what that little girl told her parents when she got home.\n\nCecil grew up with his two sisters— Ann, who died years ago, and Carolyn, who now lives in N.C. with her husband, John Egbert. He has a younger brother, Rusty, who lives in N.C. with his wife, Barbara. The four of them were typical siblings who fought over whose turn it was in the one bathroom in the home and teased and fought and made up from day to day.\n\nKitty, his mother, told a story about Cecil when he was a toddler. He chewed on a pacifier and never seemed to lose it. He would pop it into his mouth as he needed a little security. Finally, she realized how he kept up with it. He would take it out of his mouth and store it in the front of his diaper until he needed it once again.\n\nCarolyn, his sister, remembers a weekly ritual. Their mother used to split a bag of chocolate kisses every Saturday night after supper between the kids. They all gobbled theirs down except Cecil, who would carefully count his out and leave them on the kitchen table and threaten their lives if any were missing while he went out on a date…luckily they could run fast.\n\nRusty recently shared a story about a time the family was returning from the beach. A helicopter began to fly overhead and eventually a policeman pulled them over. Rather than going to the driver’s side where his mother was, the police went to the side where Cecil was sitting. Evidently someone had called the police because they thought Cecil fit the description of a wanted criminal. It’s a wonder they didn’t arrest Cecil because, knowing Rusty, he was probably whispering out that window that they were all being kidnapped by Cecil.\n\nRusty and Cecil were the jokesters in the family, and when we all got together, they would try to outdo each other. Every time they would start with the jokes and go on and on. His wife, Barbara, and I would just roll eyes at each other.\n\nCecil and I met in high school when he was the new guy who sat behind me in homeroom my junior year. He finally had the courage to ask me to the senior prom. We dated for about a year until he went to Valdosta State University, and I started at the University of South Florida in Tampa. We continued to date until I broke up with him as he liked to tell the story.\n\nWe didn’t see each other until we both graduated from college. I decided to track him down and thought he had transferred to USC. I remember writing a letter to “Secretary, USC, Columbia, S.C.” I told the secretary I was trying to find my first boyfriend and asked if there was a Cecil Barnes enrolled at USC. It would never happen today, but she mailed me Cecil’s address, and I was able to contact him again. We reconnected after almost four years. I moved to Columbia, and we married in 1972.\n\nCecil graduated from the University of South Carolina with a BA in counseling and earned his master’s degree from there, too. His first internship was at Broad River Correctional Facility, an experience that he never forgot.\n\nI reached out to Rich Tinneny and Sandi Oliver, former VP for Student Development Services at Midlands Technical College, to gather some more information about his career. They provided the following information, much of which I couldn’t even remember. Cecil loved Midlands Tech and would brag about its programs to anyone who would listen.\n\nCecil began his career in higher education at Midlands Technical Education Center, the forerunner of Midlands Technical College. He worked as a student development professional at Midlands Technical College for over 30 years. He was a leader in areas such as career counseling, career development, and entering student academic advisement. Cecil was a highly respected professional and served as a consultant in these areas to other technical college system, university, and secondary school colleagues throughout South Carolina. Over the years, Cecil served as a career counselor, director of career development, and director of entering student academic advisement at Midlands Technical College (MTC).\n\nWhile at Midlands Technical College, Cecil initiated “Educators in Industry,” which he coordinated for over 10 years, in coordination with the University of South Carolina and local industrial leaders in the Midlands of S.C. The Educators in Industry program exposed local secondary school counselors and other school leaders to emerging careers and technological advances in industry so they could better prepare and guide their students about the constantly changing world of work. The participating educators spent time in the classroom and in industrial settings, receiving three credit hours of graduate credit for the course. This outstanding program received numerous accolades and was replicated in several other technical colleges in South Carolina.\n\nIn recognition for his expertise and his exceptional service to students, the college, and the community, Cecil received numerous awards, including MTC Employee of the Month, MTC Employee of the Year, MTC Outstanding Administrator, and SC Technical College System Outstanding Administrator.\n\nCecil was obsessed with playing tennis and never turned down a game with his many tennis buddies. When we moved to the Columbia Northeast area in the ’80s, we searched for a church home. One Sunday we visited Spring Valley Presbyterian Church on Sparkleberry Lane. When the pastor came into the sanctuary, it was his tennis buddy, Lamar Potts. We’d found our church. For many years, as he shook hands with Lamar as we were leaving, I’d hear Lamar say, “I’ll see you at Parklane at 2 p.m.” Obsessed is not a strong enough word to describe Cecil’s search for the perfect tennis racquet. He would research them and then check one out at least once a week at one of the local tennis shops to try it out. It took him years to pick just the right one. He also learned to string his own racquets and spent thousands of dollars on tennis balls through the years. He made many friends on the tennis courts. On Friday afternoons he played singles with his buddy and doctor, Dr. Wayne Sribinick. He joined a tennis team and made lifelong friends with Paul C., Cary, Chuck, Mike, Paul B., and many others. I’d sometimes hear him talking to one of them on the phone, and it was like an instant replay, point by point. Cecil was a true gentleman on the court except for one day when he was playing a singles match in a tournament with a guy he didn’t know. I was watching and the guy kept calling balls out that were clearly in. This went on quite a while until the guy called one too many out. Cecil erupted, rushed the net, and yelled, “Did you call that out?” The guy changed his call and never called another one out even when they were really out.\n\nAnother time, he was playing doubles in a tournament with Paul C., Cecil was serving and it was match point for the other team. Cecil double faulted and he never forgave himself. My sister, Kay, recalls Cecil sending her a copy of a magazine cover with a picture of him and a caption that said he was a champion player in S.C. It turned out Cecil had created the cover using his newfound computer skills and Kay really fell for it. Cecil continued to play for many years after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease and watched his friends play after he could no longer play. He never missed a tennis match on TV.\n\nHe also loved music and joined the choir at the church. He was able to sing with them for many years until his voice began to fail. He loved Stan and Ann Perry and all the other choir members who he said, “Put up with him.” He became more and more interested in anything to do with music. He tried to follow in the footsteps of his musical mentor, Lamar Potts, and purchased a violin. His goal was to play as well as Lamar, but he never matched his skill. (Yes, that was sarcasm.) I must have listened to “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” at least 10,000 times. Next, it was on to the guitar, then the keyboard, and finally karaoke. He actually had a little success singing Alan Jackson’s song “Remember When,” which I also had to listen to repeatedly after which he would ask me if he sounded any better. His best musical skill was playing the harmonica his mother was very talented at playing. He downloaded hundreds of songs to his playlist and would listen to them as he fell asleep each night. His tastes were very eclectic from Tony Bennett to Brandi Carlisle. We were able to see her in concert two years ago in Greenville, and it was so much fun.\n\nAnother obsession, for both of us in recent years, was following the USC Lady Gamecocks basketball team. We never missed a game on TV. March Madness was a favorite time of the year for us. He idolized Dawn Staley and all the other coaches and knew all the players’ names, hometowns, and stats about each of them. This year we watched all the games on TV and finally the championship game against Iowa. My usual demeanor was to scream and holler and curse a wee bit while Cecil just sat there and watched. We were both nervous wrecks watching this year’s championship game, and I was screaming for Dawn Staley to call a timeout to regroup when Iowa jumped out to an early lead. Again, he just calmly sat there. The game went up and down until USC finally won and we both cried along with them. Cecil leaned back in his chair and said, “Darn, I’m exhausted!”\n\nCecil adored his mother, Kitty, who was famous for her cooking. He often reminded me about this gift she shared with everyone. Every time I sliced a tomato for him, he’d comment that his mother always peeled the tomato before slicing it. I finally got him to understand he could peel the tomato if that’s what he wanted. I never became the talented cook his mother was. The first time I made a cherry pie for him I didn’t know cherries had pits. Cecil didn’t say a word as he ate his slice of pie and calmly picked the pits out and put them on his plate. Fifty-two years later I never became a good cook, but again, he never complained. I remember having a temper tantrum one time because I was sick of cooking. I told him I was just tired of cooking every single night, and he could take a turn once a week to make a meal. One night he tried making fried chicken and some veggies. He used every pan in the kitchen and left grease everywhere. I think he did it on purpose because I wouldn’t let him cook after that. He was relegated to doing the dishes and taking out the trash.\n\nCecil thought he could fix anything that was broken. He loved tools and would teach himself how to use them. He would spend hours thinking of ways to make a task easier and actually made it worse. Ever the spendthrift, he would never hire someone to do a job that he knew he could handle. Once, we had a leak in the wall in the kitchen and he fixed the leak and patched the wall. The next day when I came home from work, the tiny leak had burst the pipe, and there was over two inches of water all over the downstairs hardwood floors. In the last few years, a new neighbor who had moved next door would help us out with fixing problems with the lawnmower and other tools. Cecil would always try his best to fix them, but his fingers wouldn’t work so well so I’d have to call Bobby. Bobby finally had to tell me to not let Cecil try to fix things as it was much harder to fix what he had messed up. But Bobby would patiently work along with Cecil to solve a problem.\n\nCecil was constantly playing pranks on me. One night after we had both gone to sleep, I awoke to an eerie, soft whisper saying, “Tracy, Traaaacccy Barnes!” The voice came from the hallway, and I was petrified someone had broken into our apartment, and they even knew my name. As I was crawling out of the bed to reach the phone, I heard Cecil laughing. It seems he had brought a tape recorder home from work and had let the tape run for about 29 minutes and then recorded my name over and over again. He got up supposedly to go to the bathroom but really was pushing play on the recorder. Then he waited until his whispery voice woke me up. I was very angry and got a red marker and drew a line down the middle of the bed. I dared him to put even his toe over the line. This threat lasted at least a week. Lamar loved to tell this story to everyone. Another night I was sewing on my machine that faced a window. I looked up and realized that someone was standing outside the window and was staring in at me. I freaked out, but again, it was Cecil playing one of his pranks. Carolyn clearly recalls waking one night to find a monster at the foot of her bed calling her name in a low scary voice. It was Cecil with a flashlight under his chin making an eerie face. He got in big trouble for that one. He tried this on his mother once. I think he was in her closet with the flashlight when she opened the door, and she nearly fainted. He regretted scaring her.\n\nFamily was everything to Cecil. First, his mom and dad, sisters and brother, and then all the aunts and uncles and cousins, my sister, Kay, and her three girls. He endured my mother for many years and believe me, that wasn’t easy. He loved all his nephews and nieces and cherished watching them all grow up.\n\nWe have one daughter, Kathryn Leigh, who he adored even when she became a rebellious teen. Leigh married and has one daughter, Rachel Marie Riddle. Cecil loved Rachel dearly and said being a granddad was just the best. He always had time for her and was constantly guiding and supporting her.\n\nLast Saturday we celebrated an early birthday for Cecil at our house. My sister, Kay, and two of her daughters, Pam and Jennifer, and Rachel and Leigh were there, and he seemed to really enjoy it. He loved chocolate so he did manage to swallow a bit of his birthday cake.\n\nCecil had a strong faith in God and loved his church family. Even as he began to fail and was using a motorized wheelchair, he loved to go to Jack’s Bible study on Tuesdays at noon. It was a small group and he loved seeing them and listening to the discussions and sometimes chiming in with his thoughts. Jack would always end the time by going around the tables and asking each person for any more thoughts they might have. Sometimes, Cecil would just pass and sometimes he would say something. One time, he was the last one Jack asked to speak. Cecil started out and as I listened, I realized he was telling a joke, and it wasn’t even a religious joke. I had to repeat it as he spoke as others could not always understand what he was saying.\n\nCecil was very agitated Monday morning when Jack, our pastor, dropped by to see us. Cecil seemed to recognize Jack, and Jack rubbed his arms and told him how much he and everyone else loved him. He began to pray for him and Cecil seemed to realize this and calmed down.\n\nCecil is an example of sheer force of will and perseverance. He never gave up. We both changed how we prayed about his illness from begging for a cure for his disease to asking God to help us both to handle what was to come. Cecil suffered silently and rarely asked for medicine for the pain. His wish and mine too was that he would die in his sleep, and that there would be no more suffering. I was rubbing his face and telling him that everyone loved him and that it was ok for him to let go. He took one last breath and let go. Peace at last.\n\nI want to thank our church family for its love and support for the last 30 years and our wonderful neighbors who would answer my calls at two in the morning and come running to help him. Cecil joined a gym called Rocksteady Boxing and worked with the owner David and his wife in a special program designed for Parkinson’s patients. Sometimes I would watch him boxing with David and wonder where he found the strength to do it. He loved to work out with them at least twice a week. David nicknamed him “Rocky.” I’d also like to thank his wonderful caregivers from Bright Star. The nurses and caretakers from Traditions Hospice were the bright spot of his days, especially his nurse, Dr. Stanley Melton, with his big brown eyes, deep voice, and constant kindness. His no-nonsense caregiver, Deborah Crane showered him, literally, with love and care for the past two years. I don’t know how I would have coped if she was not there for him. He adored her!\n\nThe last six months Cecil lived at the Watercrest Home on Clemson Road, about two blocks from our home. He was hesitant about moving there, but everyone was so kind to him. Cecil wore a button that he could push to get help if he needed it. He rarely pushed the button, but when he did the caregivers would come running. He was always so appreciative for all they did for him. He loved going to the dining room and tried to learn everyone’s names and thanked them for their kindness towards him.\n\nFinally, I’d like to thank his doctors. First, Dr. Wayne Sribnick, his tennis buddy, and the one who first diagnosed the Parkinson’s disease. His wonderful neurologist, Dr. Julie Kurek, of the Movement Disorder Clinic of the Medical University of Augusta, provided excellent medical care for him but more importantly gave him the hope to carry on. His internist, Dr. Robert Kneece, and his staff cared for him for many years. Dr. Melissa Hummel and her nurse, Renee, helped him with his sleep apnea and kept him sleeping well.\n\nI want everyone to remember Cecil as just an ordinary man, not always the best he could be, but one who tried to be a good man. Remember him for his will to overcome all the obstacles he faced. His last 20 years were a testament to his faith in his God and his longing for the peace he would find in his next life. I like to picture his mom and dad and all his other family members meeting him in heaven. I also picture Lamar greeting him and saying, “I’ll see you at Parklane at 2.”"
