        "text": "Posted by at 10:29 pm on November 8, 2022\n\nJeff Cook, founding member and legendary guitarist of the supergroup ALABAMA, has died. Cook, a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, Musicians Hall of Fame, Fiddlers Hall of Fame and Gibson’s Guitarist of the Year, passed away peacefully yesterday, November 7, with his family and close friends by his side at his beach home in Destin, Florida. He was 73. The multi-award winning guitarist was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2012. Cook was a champion in all he attempted and he courageously faced his battle with a positive attitude.\n\nJeffrey Alan Cook was born in Fort Payne, Alabama on August 27, 1949. He began playing lead guitar and keyboards in bands at the age of 13. Securing a broadcast license only three days after his 14th birthday, Cook went to work as a disc jockey at a local Fort Payne radio station. The broadcast bug had entered his blood and later resulted in him owning radio and TV stations. After graduating from Fort Payne High School, Cook received a degree in Electronic Technology from Gadsden State Community College in Gadsden, Alabama and was named “Outstanding Alumni” by the American Association of Community Colleges. Cook loved that radio combined two of his favorite things, music and electronics.\n\nOne of Cook’s lifelong dreams came true with the construction of Cook Sound Studios and his home, “Cook Castle,” based in Fort Payne. The studio was a way for him to help musicians share their music with others. Outside of music, one of his favorite hobbies was bass fishing. He was proud to be an official “Fishing Ambassador” to the state of Alabama, as proclaimed by five Governors.\n\nCook is credited for introducing the electric double neck guitar to country music. He was also an accomplished musician with the ability to play piano, guitar, fiddle, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin and anything else thrown in front of him.\n\nHe married the love of his life, Lisa Williams, on June 9, 1995. The Cooks resided in “Cook Castle” atop Lookout Mountain in Fort Payne, AL, Guntersville, AL and Destin/Miramar Beach, FL.\n\nAs a member of ALABAMA, Cook enjoyed one of the most successful careers in country music history. Over 50 years ago, Cook, along with cousins Teddy Gentry and Randy Owen, left Fort Payne to spend the summer playing music in a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina bar called The Bowery. It took Cook, Gentry and Owen six long years of tip jars and word-of-mouth to earn the major label deal they’d been dreaming of. Then, seemingly no time at all to change the face of country music forever. Cook’s iconic guitar licks, unique fiddle style, exceptional vocals and harmony, along with his bandmates, went on to sell 80 million albums and charted 43 No. 1 hits, becoming the biggest group in the history of the country genre.\n\nDue to Cook’s health battle, he ceased touring with ALABAMA in 2018. With his encouragement and well wishes, ALABAMA went on because Cook never wanted “the music to stop or the party to end.”\n\nWith his profound desire to help others, The Jeff and Lisa Cook Foundation was formed along with The Jeff and Lisa Cook Children’s Home to house orphaned children worldwide, starting in the Philippines.\n\nCook is survived by his wife of 27 years Lisa Cook, beloved puppies Blazer and Blakely, his mother Betty Cook, his brother David Cook, Crystal Cook, his father-in-law Jerrial Williams, his brother-in-law Randy Williams and many nieces and nephews. Cook was pre-deceased by his father James Cook and his mother-in-law, JoAnn Williams.\n\nJeffrey Alan Cook will always be thankful for his loving family, many close friends and especially… his FANS.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be made to THE JEFF AND LISA COOK FOUNDATION:\n\nP.O. BOX 680067, Fort Payne, AL 35968 or through the foundation website: thejeffandlisacookfoundation.org\n\nArrangements for Cook’s “Celebration of Life” will be announced at a later date.\n\nHere is what some of his peers are saying about his loss:\n\nDavid Frizzell – Frizzell and West & Alabama worked a lot of shows together in the early ’80s. It was great working with these talented guys. So sorry to hear of Jeff Cook’s passing.\n\nExile – We’re absolutely heartbroken to hear of the death of our old friend Jeff Cook, after bravely dealing with a debilitating illness over the last few years. He was a great musician and singer, but most importantly, a wonderful, charitable person. Our thoughts go out to Lisa and to Randy, Teddy and all of his Alabama ‘family.’ Rest in peace.\n\nHeath Wright (Ricochet) – In 1980 I heard my first Alabama song on the radio. I immediately fell in love with the harmonies, blazing guitar solos, and honest lyrics about being a country boy and growing up in the South. I was saddened to hear of the passing of Jeff Cook today. He told us that no matter what we do or how we play it needs to ‘come from the heart.’ Rest in Peace, Sir!\n\nHome Free – We lost a legend this week. Jeff Cook was one of the kindest, coolest, and most talented people we’ve ever met. He was always so generous with his time and talents. We’re sending our prayers to his wife Lisa, his whole family, and Randy and Teddy and the extended Alabama family.\n\nJ.D. Shelburne – Prayers to the family of Jeff Cook. One of the founding members of Alabama – the highest-selling country band of all time. Their music traces back to my childhood and so many good times growing up! He was a staple of that country group and he helped put Ft. Payne on the map. I know he’s going to be missed tremendously. Prayers also to Randy and Teddy as they continue their legacy in Jeff’s honor.\n\nJason Aldean – So sad to hear of the passing of Jeff Cook. I spent a lot of my life listening to him play guitar, what an iconic sound he had. I got a chance to perform with him multiple times over the years and I will never forget it. RIP Mr. Jeff, you are a legend to many of us and your influence will be felt forever in country music.\n\nJanie Fricke – I have great memories of touring with Alabama for 2 years, a most important time in my career. Jeff’s talent and his life of being a great entertainer will never be forgotten.\n\nJeannie Seely – Such sad news today with the passing of Jeff Cook. Many years ago, Jack Greene and I were asked to judge a talent contest, not something I’m comfortable with as I don’t feel qualified to ever judge another talent. However, we chose the group that became Alabama. We shared a lot of laughs about that and I joked I would never judge another contest as I was gonna quit a winner. Jeff was such an integral part of the group, both on and off stage. He was a talented musician and singer, but he also had the personality to connect with friends and fans alike. My heart is heavy tonight.\n\nJohn Berry – Some of my best times in country music were while sharing the stage with Jeff Cook. I had a wonderful opportunity to open for Jeff and the band many years ago. Whenever I would run into him he would always mention me being on the show with them back in Atlanta in the mid-80s. He was very kind to remember what was probably a very small thing to him and the band. Alabama, but it was such a huge thing for this country boy. Godspeed, Jeff.\n\nJohnny Lee – I was good friends with Jeff Cook and will miss him a lot. Praying for his family and friends. Rest easy, buddy.\n\nLacy J. Dalton – Jeff was an honest-to-God good Ol’ boy!!! We will all miss him.\n\nLee Greenwood – We ran a lot of roads together back in the ’80s. I was proud to tour with Alabama for four years! Night after night I watched them create magic like I had never seen before. Jeff was a unique part of the group Alabama and a really good guitar player and fiddle player. We thought we were forever young. This one hits hard. Go rest high on that mountain, Jeff Cook.\n\nPaige King Johnson – Jeff has played such a big part in music history for years and has a legacy that will live on for centuries, I’m sure! My thoughts & prayers are with his family & friends during this hard time.\n\nRandy Owen (Alabama) – He lived to play our music we created together. He could play any instrument he chose, but his harmonies I’ll miss the most. I’m thankful we got to create music together for over 50 years! Wish we could play ‘My Home’s in Alabama‘ one more time. I’m hurt in a way I can’t describe! To Lisa, thanks for loving him and being there for him to the end. Play on, Jeff. Love you!\n\nShane Owens – The group Alabama was one of my all-time favorites growing up! Was fortunate to meet Jeff Cook and the boys on a couple of different occasions. One of the best guitar pickers ever also! RIP to another legend! It’s a sad day.\n\nT.G. Sheppard – I’m so sorry and sad to hear the news of Jeff Cook’s passing. He was not only a delight to see and hear on stage, but was always a delight to just hang with. He definitely has left his mark in country music that will never be erased. R.I.P. my friend\n\nT. Graham Brown – So sorry to hear that Jeff has passed. He and Lisa always got Sheila and me to stay with them at “The Castle” and they were the most gracious hosts. He always had me laughing. Jeff contributed so very much to the music world. Alabama was the greatest country band in history and showed us all how to get it done. Condolences to Lisa, Randy, Teddy, and his legion of fans. Rest in peace, my brother.\n\nTeddy Gentry (Alabama) – Closer than brothers, we lived together more than with our immediate families. Don’t think I’ve known anyone who loved playing more. Jeff, along with me and Randy, experienced the highs of undreamed success, as well as some very tough early years. None of us were perfect, but together we had something so special it will never die. No other guitar player I’ve known had the range of styles Jeff had. No one can take your place. Ever. Rest in peace till we get to jam again.\n\nTim Atwood – The last time I played with Jeff Cook was on the 2020 Country Music Cruise. Alabama was one of the headliners that year, and even though Jeff performed several shows throughout the week with Randy and Teddy, he spent most of his nights with me and my dueling piano partner Chrissy Sparks. He sat around our pianos and helped us sing. He and I even played a few numbers together at the pianos. Twenty-seven #1 hits of his own, and Jeff was happy singing the classics. He simply loved the music! My condolences to his family and friends.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys – Jeff Cook was a long-time friend and brother as has been Randy and Teddy over all these times passing! This is a heartbreaking loss for all that knew Jeff. ALABAMA is in our prayers. Rest in Peace Jeff. Until the day…\n\nTravis Tritt – Sending out my deepest condolences to the family, friends and band mates of Jeff Cook from @TheAlabamaBand. Such a great guy an one heckuva bass fisherman. He will be truly missed."
