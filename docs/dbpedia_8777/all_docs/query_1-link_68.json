        "text": "Danielle Cook enters her 6th season at the helm for the Concordia Cardinals Women's Volleyball program. Cook brings a great deal of Cardinal Pride to the program that is helping develop athletes that are committed to the culture that Concordia desires them to have. This is evident in Cook being awarded the WHAC Chapmion of Character award in back to back years (2018 and 2019). Cook previously served as the Associate Head Coach for two seasons for the Cardinals volleyball program before becoming Head Coach.\n\nIn 2020, the Cardinals had the most successful season under Cook's tenure as head coach. With 7 wins in the WHAC (the most since 2015), the Cardinals were able to clinch the 6th seed for the conference tournament, sweeping three different season series against WHAC foes during the regular season. In addition, Kayla Peters was named WHAC Newcomer of the Year, the first time any Concordia volleyball player had ever been recognized for the award.\n\nCook was a standout student-athlete during her time as a four year starter ('08-'11) for the Cardinals. Cook currently holds four top 10 career records with 1,033 blocks (3rd), 140 block assists (T-8th), 164 total blocks (10th), and 1,469 digs (6th). As an elementary education major and early childhood minor, Cook also exceled in the classroom being named NAIA Academic All-American and WHAC All-Academic as a junior and senior. Cook was a two-time captain for the Cardinals and also won the WHAC Champions of Character Award.\n\nCook is originally from Lambertville, MI and was prepped at Bedford Senior High School. Danielle is married to CUAA alum, Austin Cook ('11) and they have two children, Isaiah and Elliana."
