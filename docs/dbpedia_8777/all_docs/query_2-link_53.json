This year, Shawsheen celebrated 109 exceptional individuals among its 1320-student population, embodying the school’s core values of Respect, Integrity, and Accountability.\n\nHosted by the dean’s office, the ceremony stands as a significant event for the school community, applauding students who epitomize the essence of what it means to be a Shawsheen student. The recently embraced core values played a pivotal role in the selection process, with students nominated for exemplifying these principles. One student from each grade in every vocational program, alongside one student from each academic course, was chosen for this esteemed recognition.\n\nAssistant Principal Kevin Caruso and Dean of Students Christine Tobin led the proceedings, presenting each student with a certificate and commemorative pin. Notably, the event garnered widespread support from teachers and staff, many of whom attended to show their encouragement for the deserving students. The ceremony also featured its annual Ice Cream Sunday bar, skillfully catered by Shawsheen’s culinary students.\n\nCaruso emphasized the importance of the event for the department, highlighting its role in reinforcing positive behavior. He stated, “It is important to recognize students for this excellent achievement because they work hard in school and are great role models for other students.”\n\nPrincipal Jessica Cook echoed the sentiment, underscoring the crucial role of school leadership in cultivating a positive school culture. She said, “It is our responsibility to intentionally create impactful moments in the lives of our students, and these ceremonies are an example of that.”\n\nShawsheen extends a heartfelt congratulations to the 109 students who earned this prestigious recognition. They are:\n\nDestinee Almodovar, Anna Andacic, Emily Aurilio, Rachel Botte, Aidan Boutot, Braeden Brazil, Noah Brooks, Ethan Caceres, Maria Cafaro, Samuel Cahill, Pheobe Cameron, John Canadas, Spencer Capparelli, Malcolm Castiglione, Isaiah Castronova, Geoffrey Cavanaugh, Tara Clark, Timothy Clark, Kara Clayton, Owen Coltran, Erin Cornell, Dante D’Alleva, Carmella Deacy, Siena DeMatteo, Brenden DiMambro, Allison Dinelli, Isabella DiSalvo, Sophia DiTonno, Mariarose Doucette, Trevor Engel, Tyler Fennell, Jake Gagnon, Sara Ganley, Gisele Gannem, Kaytlin Gannon, Elisabeth Gibson, Mia Gorrasi, Alessandra Harris, Angelique Hernandez-Nichols, Lia Holowenczak, Nathan Horne, Jaxon Jacobs, Destinee Jeanty, Sarah Johansen, Lillian Johnson, Pauline Karavakis, Alexander Kaszuba, Cole Kelley, Bryan Keohan, Matthew Kilfoyle, Nishtha Lamsal, Melissa Lavine, Daphne Lazo, Ava LeDoux, Maya Lee, Gabriella Lentini, Lincoln Levesque, Madeline Long, Mykah Lourie, Devin MacDonald, Sydney MacPherson, Aliza Maher, Lucy Malfy, Kyle Marrone, Nora Martin, Harley Martin, Amelia Matzke, Emma McDermott, Sarah McLaughlin, John McLaughlin, Devin Medeiros, Nicholas Melaragni, Valerie Mendoza-Reyna, Trevor Middleton, Julia Morin, Mia Morrison, Jacquelyn Morrissey, Valentina Mosquera, Derek Mulik, Kenneth Murnane III, Seamus Naughton, Mono Newell, Gordon Noble, Ryan Nogueira, Emmanuel Nogueras, Makayla Nolan, Mason O’Rourke, Joseph O’Sullivan, Rayssa Pereira, Colin Peterson, Gianna Rago, Ava Rega, Zackary Rogers, Seth Ruchalski, Luke Saengvanich, Elizabeth Santos, Samuel Sarkissian, Phoebe Sassone, John Schofield, James Shepherd, Brennan Skelly, Gabriella Solari, John Vitor, Ariana Walker, Delaney Ward, Michael Ware, Anna Warford, Hailey Welch, and Destiny Young.\n\nShawsheen remains committed to fostering a positive and supportive learning environment, celebrating the accomplishments of its students, while preparing them for success after high school.\n\nExchange Students Seek Hosts\n\nWhile Tewksbury Public Schools don’t currently accept exchange students, local private high schools do. Families interested in this experience are invited to contact ASSE International Student Exchange Programs (ASSE), a non-profit, public benefit organization, to learn about the many rewards of hosting a foreign exchange student. ASSE students come from more than 50 countries worldwide: France, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Japan, Australia, to name a few. They are between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and they are enthusiastic and excited to experience American culture, family life, school, sports. etc. They also love to share their own culture and language with their host families, who welcome the students into their home, not as a guest, but as a family member, giving everyone involved a rich cultural experience. Host families may be single parents, couples and single persons.\n\nThe exchange students have pocket money for personal expenses and full health, accident and liability insurance. ASSE students are carefully selected based upon academics and personality, and host families choose their student from a wide variety of backgrounds, countries and personal interests."
