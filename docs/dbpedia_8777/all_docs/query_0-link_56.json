        "text": "Media day is typically a low-key affair for Acorn high school football teams, with the primary activity revolving around teens wolfing down breakfast burritos at neighborhood sports grills.\n\nThe Marmonte League, spearheaded by host and defending league champion Oaks Christian, and the school’s athletic director Brad Cook, decided to go big.\n\nOaks Christian, Camarillo, Simi Valley, St. Bonaventure, Pacifica and Bishop Diego of Santa Barbara showcased their best players during Marmonte League media day Aug. 5.\n\nThe extravaganza featured an illuminated stage; the clicking of cameras by a gaggle of photographers, including budding multimedia journalist Alan Ko, a Thousand Oaks senior and CIF Champion for Character; a throng of journalists, notably distinguished scribes Haley Sawyer, Lorenzo Reyna and Eric Sondheimer (Joe Curley was allegedly on vacation, teaching his offspring the lost art of hunting snipe); and one slightly bewildered snot otter pondering why it cost $250 per school for a buffet featuring yogurt and black coffee.\n\nIt wasn’t about the grub. It’s about football.\n\n“The Marmonte League is the best league in Ventura County,” said Joe Goyeneche, St. Bonaventure’s head coach.\n\nSt. Bonaventure and Simi Valley won CIF-Southern Section championships last season in Division 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nOaks Christian notched a 9-3 record, seized the Marmonte crown with a 5-0 mark and reached the Division 2 playoff quarterfinals last fall.\n\nPacifica went a perfect 10-0 in the regular season while conquering the Channel League last year.\n\nCamarillo, a public school team that does not recruit and has a proud history of success, did not qualify for the 2023 postseason.\n\nParochial pariah Bishop Diego, a school so far away from this newspaper’s coverage zone it might as well be in Wetaskiwin, had an inconsequential record. We looked it up, squinted at the computer screen, noted it, and made the executive decision not to print the record in this space.\n\nIt is hard for players to stand out on any media day—they are understandably nervous, and there is rarely much insight gleaned from the boilerplate vernacular of jock talk—but Weston Schwesinger was a notable exception.\n\nSchwesinger, an Oaks Christian senior wide receiver who lives in Moorpark, talked about his older brother, Carson, who walked on at UCLA before eventually earning a scholarship. Carson Schwesinger is a redshirt junior linebacker, honor roll student and bioengineering major for the Bruins.\n\n“He inspired me,” Weston Schwesinger said.\n\nThe younger Schwesinger scooped up an offer from the Air Force Academy this summer, but the 5-foot-10, 170-pound teen knows he’ll have an uphill climb wherever he plays football.\n\n“It doesn’t get any easier,” he said. “I know I can play in college and play at a high level.”\n\nSchwesinger, a scholar athlete, sports a 4.4 GPA. The track and field sprinter is also one of the fastest players on the Lions’ roster.\n\nTight end Stevie Amar Jr. (multiple Division I offers), quarterback Axel Eason (UC Davis commit), linebacker Christian Knoos (UC Davis), defensive end Hayden Lowe (USC) and offensive lineman Will Simic (University of Chicago) also represented Oaks Christian at media day.\n\nKnoos, who is on the verge of breaking the school record for career tackles, talked about the intensity of Oaks Christian’s offseason training.\n\n“We treat every practice like a game when it comes to competition,” Knoos said.\n\nCamarillo’s media day caravan featured head coach Nathan Anderson and standouts Garrett Johnson, Peyton Moise, Drew Reyes, Brayden Smith (CIF baseball champion) and quarterback Brendan Widerburg.\n\n“We’re honored to be in this league . . . and hopefully win some games,” said Johnson, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound tight end/defensive end.\n\nJohnson is one of four tight ends integrated into Anderson’s complex offense at Camarillo.\n\n“We incorporate tight ends on almost every single play,” Anderson said.\n\nThe Scorpions, who opened fall camp on Aug. 5, kicked off media day festivities. When they finished, they bolted down the Conejo Grade to join the rest of the team at practice.\n\nSt. Bonaventure is the Teddy Roosevelt of high school football. The Seraphs are intentional and direct; they speak softly off the field, but they are hellraisers on it.\n\n“Our first goal is to win league right now,” Goyeneche said. “Oaks is at the top of the league, and it’s our job to knock them off.”\n\nBrice Hawkins, Izak Simpson, Kevin Ilano, Jack Reed and Gino Veon represented Simi Valley at the media day.\n\nThe Pioneers will be the first team to play this season. They kick off in another state next week: Simi Valley plays at Spanish Springs of Reno, Nevada, on Aug. 16.\n\nLowe of Oaks Christian said he’s ready for the new season.\n\n“We really want to have a great year,” the Lion said.\n\nFollow sports editor Eliav Appelbaum on X @EliavAppelbaum\n\nPIGSKIN PREVIEW!\n\nThe 12th edition of the Pigskin Preview, a 24-page special section on high school football, will print next week on Aug. 16.\n\nAgoura, Calabasas, Camarillo, Moorpark, Newbury Park, Oak Park, Oaks Christian, Royal, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Westlake all have their own team pages. The Acorn Power Poll, featuring local public school outfits, will also be unveiled.\n\nThe 2023 Pigskin Preview won a first-place award from the California News Publishers Association."
