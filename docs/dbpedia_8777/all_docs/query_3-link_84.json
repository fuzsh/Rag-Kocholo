        "text": "Being on a reality competition show is tough enough when you’re an adult. Imagine if you’re a kid!\n\n“MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays” scouted more than 1,000 contestants, but only one young chef from South Florida had the talent to make the cut.\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay: “That soggy, disgusting nugget sat on a bed of unwanted slaw over a gummy [expletive] purée that I’d give my granddad to paste his [expletive] new wallpaper, not to eat.”\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay sure can get fired up on “MasterChef,” but when it comes to MasterChef Junior”…\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay: “Ho! Ho! Ho!”\n\n“MasterChef Junior” contestant: “I didn’t know Santa has a British accent.”\n\nHe’s kind of a big ol’ softie … and he and his daughter Tilly are feeling festive about the show’s new seasonal special, “MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays.”\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay: “Tilly’s been to the ‘MasterChef’ kitchen many times, but to have her here as a judge makes me feel old, and I can’t be any prouder from a dad’s point of view.”\n\nSpeaking of being proud, that’s how Deco’s feeling about SoFlo’s own Chef Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “Since a young age, I’ve loved to cook. I mean, at first I was playing soccer, ’cause my dad thought I was gonna be Messi. But you know, I didn’t really like to run.”\n\nWhat he did like was food…\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “My first words, you would expect ‘Mommy,’ ‘Mamá,’ ‘Papá.’ My first words were ‘carne, carne,’ which is ‘meat, meat’ in Spanish.”\n\n…and learning to get crafty in the kitchen, even if he didn’t always get it right.\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “Being a chef is hard, but it’s like, you learn from your mistakes, so I like that.”\n\nIt’s that drive that landed 12-year-old Lorenzo on “MasterChef Junior’s” holiday special.\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “Out of 1,150 kids, only nine of us. Like, that’s not even 1% so, you know, for me to get there, I feel like anything is possible.”\n\nHis parents totally agree.\n\nFrederik Ramos: “We really feel so proud of him that he made the cut.”\n\nMarta Ramirez: “I think it was an incredible journey for his life, because the competition and the casting was very hard.”\n\n“MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays” is all about celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa-themed dishes.\n\nWhile Lorenzo couldn’t give us specifics about what he cooks on the show, he did give us a demo of one of his signature dishes.\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “Today I’ll be making you a special tuna tartare. Make sure to use sushi grade tuna. This is ahi tuna.”\n\nLorenzo stacks three layers — tuna, avocado, then more tuna — then tops it with chives, some truffle, lemon zest and sea salt.\n\nThen he adds some edible flower garnishes, and voilà!\n\nLorenzo Ramos: “This is a very good appetizer. You can obviously decorate it in a variety of different ways, but this is the final product.”\n\nNow all that’s left is a taste test with his toughest critic: his big sister. Mmm, looks like this recipe is a winner!\n\nBy the way, Lorenzo’s parents did confirm his first word really was “carne.”\n\n“MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays” will spice up the season during its two-night special premiere event. You can watch it Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m., right here on 7.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.
