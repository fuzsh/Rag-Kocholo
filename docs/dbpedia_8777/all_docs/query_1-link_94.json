You were either going home or you were staying,” said McGlynn.\n\n12 year old Bryson “Cheese Curd” McGlynn is advancing to the finale of Fox’s “Master Chef Junior.” In the semi-final round, the junior chefs had to prepare a dish the same way Chef Gordon Ramsey did. McGlynn said the challenge pushed him to the limits.\n\n“That was really crazy,” he said. “We had to cook it the exact same way we did, plating, same thing. It was a lot,” he said.\n\nMcGlynn, a 6th grader at Fox Run school in Opelika, ended up burning the broccolini in his dish, sending him to the bottom two for the first time in the competition. The boy, known as “Cheese Curd”, said the way he cooked the Duck helped save him.\n\n“It was medium rare, which is the way it was supposed to be,” he explained.\n\nAs a way to thank Bryson for representing Opelika, Academy Sports and Outdoors presented Bryson with a $1,000 shopping spree and, of course, he went straight to the grilling department.\n\n“I have a thousand dollar limit, which is a lot, and I’m thinking about getting different seasonings and different kitchenware,” he said.\n\nIf Bryson wins, he’ll win enough money to buy all the tools he wants. The top prize is $100,000 dollars and of course, he’ll get to wear the White Apron.\n\n“It’s a huge honor to even get into the show, but now I’m in the finale so I’m just excited,” he said.\n\nCheese Curd is one of three finalists in the two-part finale that will air Monday at 7 p.m. CT on FOX 54, or your local Fox channel.\n\nThere will also be a watch party at Hey Day Market in Auburn beginning at 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nFor our full story with “Cheese Curd”, click on the video player below:"
