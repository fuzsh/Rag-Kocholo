        "text": "For the hostess and host of tomorrow...\n\n{HISTORY}\n\nOriginally published in 1955, this revised 1963 edition of the Better Homes and Gardens Junior Cook Book is a fun way to introduce your kids to cooking, vintage style. Published by one of America's most well-loved magazines, Better Homes & Gardens which has been around since 1922, it is filled with over 75 pages of recipes for the petite chef (or the host and hostess of tomorrow, as the front cover states!) Broken down into six chapters, recipes run the gamut from easy (baked potatoes) to challenging (Scalloped Salmon) and include all meals of the day.\n\n{SPECIAL FEATURES}\n\n- Contains six chapters broken down as follows: Beverages, Breads & Sandwiches, Candy & Cookies, Desserts, Main Dishes, Salads & Vegetables\n\n- Each chapter ends with a list of ideas for extra recipes, styling tips or table presentation\n\n- Illustrated throughout with both color and black and white photographs, cute retro drawings and jaunty midcentury fonts\n\n- Interesting recipes like Party Surprise Sandwiches, Lime Fizz, Cherry Fill-Ups, Mock Drumsticks, Yumsicles and Honey Coconut Bars mingle with traditional favorites like pancakes, hamburgers, and hotdogs for a good balance between well-loved foods and recipes that are a little more unusual.\n\n- Additional cooking tips and techniques include special sections on weights and measures, meal planning, equipment etc.\n\n- Because these highlight foods intended for kids a lot of these recipes deal with fun presentation. Don't let that deter you though into thinking they are only meant for kid-size appetites. Many recipes suggest making dishes that all members of the family will enjoy including adults.\n\n{CONDITION}\n\nBright and clean! There is some rubbing to the corners of the cover, and a small cooking stain on one page (see photo), but other than that the spine is tight, all pages are intact and free of writing and marks.\n\n{SIZE}\n\nMeasures 7.25\" (width) x 10.25\" (length) x .5\" (depth)\n\n{STYLE IDEA}\n\nIt would be so fun to throw a vintage style kids party for the little ones in your life, complete with costumes, decorations, music and a movie all centered around a 1960's theme. Another fun use for this book is as a new holiday cooking tradition especially for guests sitting at the kids' table. They'll get a chance to sample some food made especially for them, by them, making the holiday extra special and personal."
