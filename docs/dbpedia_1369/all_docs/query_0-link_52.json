        "text": "Tachycardia-Induced Right Heart Failure and Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation That Improved with Medication.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Young Ae; Yang, Dong Heon; Kim, Hong Nyun; Kwon, Sang Hoon; Jang, Se Young; Bae, Myung Hwan; Lee, Jang Hoon; Chae, Shung Chull\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSecondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) primarily develops due to left heart failure or primary pulmonary diseases. Tricuspid annular dilation, which is commonly caused by right ventricular volume and pressure overload followed by right ventricle dilation, is believed to be the main mechanism underlying secondary TR. It is reported that once the tricuspid annulus is dilated, its size cannot spontaneously return to normal, and it may continue to dilate. These reports also suggest the use of an aggressive surgical approach for secondary TR. In the present report, we describe a case of tachycardia-induced severe TR that was completely resolved without the need for surgery.\n\nAlterations in myocardial free fatty acid clearance precede mechanical abnormalities in canine tachycardia-induced heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nFreeman, G L; Colston, J T; Miller, D D\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate whether abnormalities of free fatty acid metabolism are present before the onset of overt mechanical dysfunction in dogs with tachycardia-induced heart failure. We studied six dogs chronically instrumented to allow assessment of left ventricular function in the pressure-volume plane. Free fatty acid clearance was assessed according to the washout rate of a free fatty acid analog, iodophenylpentadecanoic acid ([123I]PPA or IPPA). IPPA clearance was measured within 1 hour of the hemodynamic assessment. The animals were studied under baseline conditions and 11.7 +/- 3.6 days after ventricular pacing at a rate of 240 beats/min. Hemodynamic studies after pacing showed a nonsignificant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (11.7 +/- 4.7 to 17.4 +/- 6.5 mm Hg) and a nonsignificant decrease in the maximum derivative of pressure with respect to time (1836 +/- 164 vs 1688 +/- 422 mm Hg/sec). There was also no change in the time constant of left ventricular relaxation, which was 34.8 +/- 7.67 msec before and 35.3 +/- 7.3 msec after pacing. However, a significant prolongation in the clearance half-time of [123I]PPA, from 86.1 +/- 23.9 to 146.5 +/- 22.6 minutes (p < 0.01) was found. Thus abnormal lipid clearance appears before the onset of significant mechanical dysfunction in tachycardia-induced heart failure. This suggests that abnormal substrate metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this condition.\n\nIntrinsic cardiac nervous system in tachycardia induced heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nArora, Rakesh C; Cardinal, Rene; Smith, Frank M; Ardell, Jeffrey L; Dell'Italia, Louis J; Armour, J Andrew\n\n2003-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that early-stage heart failure differentially affects the intrinsic cardiac nervous system's capacity to regulate cardiac function. After 2 wk of rapid ventricular pacing in nine anesthetized canines, cardiac and right atrial neuronal function were evaluated in situ in response to enhanced cardiac sensory inputs, stimulation of extracardiac autonomic efferent neuronal inputs, and close coronary arterial administration of neurochemicals that included nicotine. Right atrial neuronal intracellular electrophysiological properties were then evaluated in vitro in response to synaptic activation and nicotine. Intrinsic cardiac nicotine-sensitive, neuronally induced cardiac responses were also evaluated in eight sham-operated, unpaced animals. Two weeks of rapid ventricular pacing reduced the cardiac index by 54%. Intrinsic cardiac neurons of paced hearts maintained their cardiac mechano- and chemosensory transduction properties in vivo. They also responded normally to sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic efferent neuronal inputs, as well as to locally administered alpha-or beta-adrenergic agonists or angiotensin II. The dose of nicotine needed to modify intrinsic cardiac neurons was 50 times greater in failure compared with normal preparations. That dose failed to alter monitored cardiovascular indexes in failing preparations. Phasic and accommodating neurons identified in vitro displayed altered intracellular membrane properties compared with control, including decreased membrane resistance, indicative of reduced excitability. Early-stage heart failure differentially affects the intrinsic cardiac nervous system's capacity to regulate cardiodynamics. While maintaining its capacity to transduce cardiac mechano- and chemosensory inputs, as well as inputs from extracardiac autonomic efferent neurons, intrinsic cardiac nicotine-sensitive, local-circuit neurons differentially remodel such that their capacity to\n\nThyroid Storm with Heart Failure Treated with a Short-acting Beta-adrenoreceptor Blocker, Landiolol Hydrochloride.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamashita, Yugo; Iguchi, Moritake; Nakatani, Rieko; Usui, Takeshi; Takagi, Daisuke; Hamatani, Yasuhiro; Unoki, Takashi; Ishii, Mitsuru; Ogawa, Hisashi; Masunaga, Nobutoyo; Abe, Mitsuru; Akao, Masaharu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBeta-adrenoreceptor blockers are essential in controlling the peripheral actions of thyroid hormones and a rapid heart rate in patients with thyroid storm, although they should be used with great caution when there is the potential for heart failure. A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed as having thyroid storm in addition to marked tachycardia with atrial fibrillation and heart failure associated with a reduced left ventricular function. The administration of an oral beta blocker, bisoprolol fumarate, induced hypotension and was not tolerable for the patient, whereas landiolol hydrochloride, a short-acting intravenous beta-adrenoreceptor blocker with high cardioselectivity and a short elimination half-life, was useful for controlling the patient's tachycardia and heart failure without causing hemodynamic deterioration.\n\nRadiofrequency catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients without structural heart disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlein, L S; Shih, H T; Hackett, F K; Zipes, D P; Miles, W M\n\n1992-05-01\n\nRadiofrequency energy has been used safely and successfully to eliminate accessory pathways in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and the substrate for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. However, this form of ablation has had only limited success in eliminating ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease. In contrast, direct-current catheter ablation has been used successfully to eliminate ventricular tachycardia in patients with and without structural heart disease. The purpose of this study was to test whether radiofrequency energy can safely and effectively ablate ventricular tachycardia in patients without structural heart disease. Sixteen patients (nine women and seven men; mean age, 38 years; range, 18-55 years) without structural heart disease who had ventricular tachycardia underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation to eliminate the ventricular tachycardia. Two patients presented with syncope, nine with presyncope, and five with palpitations only. Mean duration of symptoms was 6.7 years (range, 0.5-20 years). Radiofrequency catheter ablation successfully eliminated ventricular tachycardia in 15 of 16 patients (94%). Sites of ventricular tachycardia origin included the high right ventricular outflow tract (12 patients), the right ventricular septum near the tricuspid valve (three patients), and the left ventricular septum (one patient). The only ablation failure was in a patient whose ventricular tachycardia arose from a region near the His bundle. An accurate pace map, early local endocardial activation, and firm catheter contact with endocardium were associated with successful ablation. Radiofrequency ablation did not cause arrhythmias, produced minimal cardiac enzyme rise, and resulted in no detectable change in cardiac function by Doppler echocardiography. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients without structural heart disease is effective and safe and may be considered as\n\nPrognostic Factors in Severe Chagasic Heart Failure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCosta, Sandra de AraÃºjo; Rassi, Salvador; Freitas, Elis Marra da Madeira; Gutierrez, NatÃ¡lia da Silva; Boaventura, Fabiana Miranda; Sampaio, Larissa Pereira da Costa; Silva, JoÃ£o Bastista Masson\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Prognostic factors are extensively studied in heart failure; however, their role in severe Chagasic heart failure have not been established. Objectives To identify the association of clinical and laboratory factors with the prognosis of severe Chagasic heart failure, as well as the association of these factors with mortality and survival in a 7.5-year follow-up. Methods 60 patients with severe Chagasic heart failure were evaluated regarding the following variables: age, blood pressure, ejection fraction, serum sodium, creatinine, 6-minute walk test, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, QRS width, indexed left atrial volume, and functional class. Results 53 (88.3%) patients died during follow-up, and 7 (11.7%) remained alive. Cumulative overall survival probability was approximately 11%. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (HR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.04 - 4.31; p<0.05) and indexed left atrial volume â¥ 72 mL/m2 (HR = 3.51; 95% CI: 1.63 - 7.52; p<0.05) were the only variables that remained as independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions The presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter and indexed left atrial volume > 72 mL/m2 are independent predictors of mortality in severe Chagasic heart failure, with cumulative survival probability of only 11% in 7.5 years.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are effective in reducing mortality, but do not prevent arrhythmia recurrence. There is increasing recognition that frequent premature ventricular contractions or repetitive ventricular tachycardia may also lead to new onset ventricular dysfunction or deterioration of ventricular function in patients with pre-existing HF. Suppression of the arrhythmia may lead to recovery of ventricular function. Catheter ablation has emerged as a safe and effective treatment option for reducing arrhythmia recurrence and for suppression of PVCs but its efficacy is governed by the nature of the arrhythmias, the underlying HF substrate and the accessibility of the arrhythmia substrates to ablation.\n\nVentricular, but not atrial, M2-muscarinic receptors increase in the canine pacing-overdrive model of heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilkinson, M; Giles, A; Armour, J A; Cardinal, R\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTo investigate the effects of heart failure induced by chronic rapid ventricular pacing (six weeks) on canine atrial and ventricular muscarinic receptors. Dogs (n = 4) were fitted with a bipolar pacing electrode connected to a Medtronic pacemaker set at 240 stimuli/min. Pacing was maintained for six weeks. Tissue samples obtained from the left atrium and ventral wall of the left ventricle were frozen at -70 degrees C. Control tissue was obtained from normal dogs (n = 6) following anesthesia and thoracotomy. M2-muscarinic receptors were characterized and quantified in tissue micropunches using the hydrophilic ligand [3H] N-methyl-scopolamine (NMS). Cardiac tissue bound [3H] NMS with the specificity of an M2 subtype. Tachycardia-induced heart failure did not affect atrial muscarinic receptors but signify left ventricular myocytes (control 160.0 +/- 10.0 fmol/mg protein versus heart failure 245.0 +/- 25.0 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.01). Canine ventricular muscarinic receptors display a specificity for the M2 subtype. In contrast to previous work, tachycardia-induced heart failure was accompanied by an increase (+ 53%) in ventricular, but not atrial, M2 receptors compared with normal dogs.\n\nImaging cardiac activation sequence during ventricular tachycardia in a canine model of nonischemic heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Chengzong; Pogwizd, Steven M; Yu, Long; Zhou, Zhaoye; Killingsworth, Cheryl R; He, Bin\n\n2015-01-15\n\nNoninvasive cardiac activation imaging of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is important in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias in heart failure (HF) patients. This study investigated the ability of the three-dimensional cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique for characterizing the activation patterns of spontaneously occurring and norepinephrine (NE)-induced VTs in a newly developed arrhythmogenic canine model of nonischemic HF. HF was induced by aortic insufficiency followed by aortic constriction in three canines. Up to 128 body-surface ECGs were measured simultaneously with bipolar recordings from up to 232 intramural sites in a closed-chest condition. Data analysis was performed on the spontaneously occurring VTs (n=4) and the NE-induced nonsustained VTs (n=8) in HF canines. Both spontaneously occurring and NE-induced nonsustained VTs initiated by a focal mechanism primarily from the subendocardium, but occasionally from the subepicardium of left ventricle. Most focal initiation sites were located at apex, right ventricular outflow tract, and left lateral wall. The NE-induced VTs were longer, more rapid, and had more focal sites than the spontaneously occurring VTs. Good correlation was obtained between imaged activation sequence and direct measurements (averaged correlation coefficient of â¼0.70 over 135 VT beats). The reconstructed initiation sites were â¼10 mm from measured initiation sites, suggesting good localization in such a large animal model with cardiac size similar to a human. Both spontaneously occurring and NE-induced nonsustained VTs had focal initiation in this canine model of nonischemic HF. 3DCEI is feasible to image the activation sequence and help define arrhythmia mechanism of nonischemic HF-associated VTs.

We describe the first case report, to our knowledge, of a patient who developed recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia with multiple administrations of lacosamide in an acute setting. A 70-year-old woman with a history significant for valvular heart disease was admitted to the inpatient cardiology service for worsening heart failure. On hospital day 7, she received a bioprosthetic aortic valve. Prior to surgery and immediately after, the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. After developing multiple generalized tonic-clonic seizures refractory to levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproic acid, the decision was made to initiate lacosamide. Two hours following the second lacosamide dose, the patient developed a wide complex QRS that transitioned into sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion. Sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred again, just hours after the third dose of lacosamide was given. Following cessation of lacosamide, the patient's QRS interval normalized and has since had no documented episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for life-threatening rhythmic disturbances in patients initiated on lacosamide and the need for vigilant ECG, electrolyte, and drug-drug monitoring.\n\nMitoQ improves mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure induced by pressure overload.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro Junior, RogÃ©rio Faustino; Dabkowski, Erinne Rose; Shekar, Kadambari Chandra; O Connell, Kelly A; Hecker, Peter A; Murphy, Michael P\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHeart failure remains a major public-health problem with an increase in the number of patients worsening from this disease. Despite current medical therapy, the condition still has a poor prognosis. Heart failure is complex but mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be an important target to improve cardiac function directly. Our goal was to analyze the effects of MitoQ (100â¯ÂµM in drinking water) on the development and progression of heart failure induced by pressure overload after 14 weeks. The main findings are that pressure overload-induced heart failure in rats decreased cardiac function in vivo that was not altered by MitoQ. However, we observed a reduction in right ventricular hypertrophy and lung congestion in heart failure animals treated with MitoQ. Heart failure also decreased total mitochondrial protein content, mitochondrial membrane potential in the intermyofibrillar mitochondria. MitoQ restored membrane potential in IFM but did not restore mitochondrial protein content. These alterations are associated with the impairment of basal and stimulated mitochondrial respiration in IFM and SSM induced by heart failure. Moreover, MitoQ restored mitochondrial respiration in heart failure induced by pressure overload. We also detected higher levels of hydrogen peroxide production in heart failure and MitoQ restored the increase in ROS production. MitoQ was also able to improve mitochondrial calcium retention capacity, mainly in the SSM whereas in the IFM we observed a small alteration. In summary, MitoQ improves mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure induced by pressure overload, by decreasing hydrogen peroxide formation, improving mitochondrial respiration and improving mPTP opening.

Long-term clinical studies have been performed using tetracyclines, without significant side effects. Previous studies demonstrated that doxycycline (DOX), a major tetracyclin antibiotic, exerted a protective effect in animal models of heart failure; however, its exact molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we provide the first evidence that DOX reduces oxidative stressâinduced mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and beneficially alters the expression of Mfn-2, OPA-1 and Drp-1 âthe main regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fissionâin our isoproterenol (ISO)âinduced heart failure model, ultimately decreasing the severity of heart failure. In mitochondria, oxidative stress causes a shift toward fission which leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by drugs that shift the balance toward fusion, could be a novel therapeutic approach for heart failure. On the basis of our findings, we raise the possibility that DOX could be a novel therapeutic agent in the future treatment of heart failure.

We set out to establish large animal model of FTR that could serve as a research platform to investigate the pathogenesis of FTR associated with end-stage heart failure. : Through right thoracotomy, ten adult sheep underwent implantation of pacemaker with epicardial LV lead, five sonomicrometry crystals on the right ventricle, and left and right ventricular telemetry pressure sensors during a beating heart off-pump procedure. After 5âÂ±â1 days of recovery, baseline haemodynamic, echocardiographic and sonomicrometry data were collected. Animals were paced thereafter at a rate of 220-240 beats/min until the development of heart failure and concomitant tricuspid regurgitation. : Three animals died during early recovery period and one during the pacing phase. Six surviving animals were paced for a mean of 14âÂ±â5 days. Cardiac function was significantly depressed compared to baseline, with LV ejection fraction falling from 69âÂ±â2% to 22âÂ±â4% ( P â<â0.001) and RV fractional area change from 52âÂ±â11% to 25âÂ±â9% ( P â=â0.005). All animals developed significant enlargement of tricuspid annulus (from 29.5âÂ±â1.6 to 36.5âÂ±â4.5âmm; P â=â0.01) and right ventricle (from 21.9âÂ±â0.2 to 30.3âÂ±â0.6âmm; P â=â0.03). Sonomicrometry derived contractility of RV free wall was depressed and at least moderate tricuspid insufficiency developed in all animals. : Biventricular dysfunction, tricuspid annular dilatation and significant FTR were observed in our model of ovine tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. This animal model reflects the clinical situation of end-stage heart failure patients presenting for mechanical support. Â© The Author 2017.

Several studies reported the evidence of cardiac autophagy, involving removal of cellular organelles like mitochondria (mitophagy), peroxisomes etc., in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, little is known regarding the therapeutic role of mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi) in the pressure overload induced heart failure. We hypothesize that treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi) inhibits abnormal mitophagy in a pressure overload heart and thus ameliorates heart failure condition. Materials and Methods To verify this, ascending aortic banding was done in wild type mice to create pressure overload induced heart failure and then treated with Mdivi and compared with vehicle treated controls. Results Expression of MMP-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, CD31, was increased, while expression of anti angiogenic factors like endostatin and angiostatin along with MMP-9, TIMP-3 was reduced in Mdivi treated AB 8 weeks mice compared to vehicle treated controls. Expression of mitophagy markers like LC3 and p62 was decreased in Mdivi treated mice compared to controls. Cardiac functional status assessed by echocardiography showed improvement and there is also a decrease in the deposition of fibrosis in Mdivi treated mice compared to controls. Conclusion Above results suggest that Mdivi inhibits the abnormal cardiac mitophagy response during sustained pressure overload stress and propose the novel therapeutic role of Mdivi in ameliorating heart failure.

Less noradrenaline was released from cardiac myoneural junctions into coronary sinus blood in response to left stellate ganglion stimulation in anesthetized failing heart preparations (582 pg/mL, lower and upper 95% confidence intervals of 288 and 1174 pg/mL, n = 19) compared with healthy heart preparations (6391 pg/mL, 95% confidence intervals of 4180 and 9770 pg/mL, n = 14; p < 0.001). There was substantial adrenaline extraction by failing hearts (49 +/- 6%), although it was slightly lower than in healthy heart preparations (65 +/- 9%, p = 0.055). In contrast with healthy heart preparations, no net release of adrenaline occurred during stellate ganglion stimulation in any of the failing heart preparations, and ventricular tissue levels of adrenaline fell below the sensitivity limit of the HPLC technique. In failing heart preparations, maximal electrical stimulation of right or left stellate ganglia resulted in minimal augmentation of left ventricular intramyocardial (17%) and chamber (12%) systolic pressures. These indices were augmented by 145 and 97%, respectively, following exogenous noradrenaline administration. Thus, the cardiac efferent sympathetic neurons' reduced capacity to release noradrenaline and modify cardiac function can contribute to reduction of sympathetic support to the failing heart.\n\nRadiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with symptomatic atrial flutter/tachycardia after orthotopic heart transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yi-gang; GrÃ¶nefeld, Gerian; Israel, Carsten; Lu, Shang-biao; Wang, Qun-shan; Hohnloser, Stefan H\n\n2006-12-20\n\nAtrial tachycardia or flutter is common in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation. Radiofrequency catheter ablation to treat this arrhythmia has not been well defined in this setting. This study was conducted to assess the incidence of various symptomatic atrial arrhythmias and the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency catheter ablation in these patients. Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation were performed in patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmia. One Halo catheter with 20 poles was positioned around the tricuspid annulus of the donor right atrium, or positioned around the surgical anastomosis when it is necessary. Three quadripolar electrode catheters were inserted via the right or left femoral vein and positioned in the recipient atrium, the bundle of His position, the coronary sinus. Programmed atrial stimulation and burst pacing were performed to prove electrical conduction between the recipient and the donor atria and to induce atrial arrhythmias. Out of 55 consecutive heart transplantation patients, 6 males [(58 +/- 12) years] developed symptomatic tachycardias at a mean of (5 +/- 4) years after heart transplantation. Electrical propagation through the suture line between the recipient and the donor atrium was demonstrated during atrial flutter or during recipient atrium and donor atrium pacing in 2 patients. By mapping around the suture line, the earliest fragmented electrogram of donor atrium was assessed. This electrical connection was successfully ablated in the anterior lateral atrium in both patients. There was no electrical propagation through the suture line in the other 4 patients. Two had typical atrial flutter in the donor atrium which was successfully ablated by completing a linear ablation between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava. Two patients had atrial tachycardia which was ablated in the anterior septal and lateral donor atrium. There were no procedure-related complications. Patients were free of\n\nMending a Broken Heart: Treatment of Stress-Induced Heart Failure after Solid Organ Transplantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKumm, Kayla; Kueht, Michael; Ha, Cindy P.; Yoeli, Dor; Cotton, Ronald T.; Rana, Abbas; O'Mahony, Christine A.; Halff, Glenn; Goss, John A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStress-induced heart failure, also known as Broken Heart Syndrome or Takotsubo Syndrome, is a phenomenon characterized as rare but well described in the literature, with increasing incidence. While more commonly associated with postmenopausal women with psychiatric disorders, this entity is found in the postoperative patient. The nonischemic cardiogenic shock manifests as biventricular failure with significant decreases in ejection fraction and cardiac function. In a review of over 3000 kidney and liver transplantations over the course of 17 years within two transplant centers, we describe a series of 7 patients with Takotsubo Syndrome after solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, we describe a novel approach of successfully treating the transient, though potentially fatal, cardiogenic shock with a percutaneous ventricular assistance device in two liver transplant patients, while treating one kidney transplant patient medically and the remaining four liver transplant patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump. We describe our experience with Takotsubo's Syndrome and compare the three modalities of treatment and cardiac augmentation. Our series is novel in introducing the percutaneous ventricular assist device as a more minimally invasive intervention in treating nonischemic heart failure in the solid organ transplant patient, while serving as a comprehensive overview of treatment modalities for stress-induced heart failure.

We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with CQ-induced cardiomyopathy leading to severe heart failure. Electrocardiographic abnormalities included bifascicular block, while structural disease consisted of severe biventricular and biatrial hypertrophy. Appropriate diagnosis via endomyocardial biopsy led to cessation of CQ and subsequent dramatic improvement in symptoms and structural heart disease. Cardiac toxicity is an under-recognized adverse effect of CQ/HCQ leading to cardiomyopathy with concentric hypertrophy and conduction abnormalities, with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Predisposing factors for CQ/HCQ-induced cardiomyopathy have been proposed. CQ/HCQ cardiomyopathy is a phenocopy of Fabry disease, and Î±-galactosidase A polymorphism may account for some heterogeneity of disease presentation. Â© 2018 The Authors.

A 47-year-old male with a history of heart failure with New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms presented to our institution with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia storm. Torsade de pointes secondary to a combination of dofetilide and hypokalemia was determined to be the etiology. Upon stabilization, the patient was initiated on dronedarone 400 mg orally twice daily by the electrophysiology service for atrial fibrillation. The patient had a questionable history of amiodarone intolerance. By hospital day 9 (day 4 of dronedarone therapy), the patient demonstrated a clinical picture consistent with acute renal and hepatic failure possibly due to worsening heart failure. Dronedarone was discontinued on hospital day 10. He was subsequently transferred to an outside hospital where he required milrinone therapy for cardiogenic shock. Laboratory markers of renal and hepatic function improved over the remainder of his hospitalization and he was discharged on hospital day 20. Dronedarone is a newly approved antiarrhythmic agent with multichannel blocking properties similar to amiodarone. Use of the Naranjo probability scale determined that this patient's worsening heart failure leading to acute renal and hepatic failure was possibly caused by dronedarone. The implication from the ANDROMEDA trial as well as our experience in this case is that dronedarone should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure and avoided in patients specifically outlined in the product labeling. This case report, to our knowledge, represents the first published postmarketing report of worsening heart failure complicated by multiorgan dysfunction in the setting of dronedarone initiation. Dronedarone use must be approached with\n\nF 16915 prevents heart failure-induced atrial fibrillation: a promising new drug as upstream therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Grand, Bruno; Letienne, Robert; Dupont-Passelaigue, Elisabeth; Lantoine-Adam, FrÃ©dÃ©rique; Longo, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; David-Dufilho, Monique; Michael, Georghia; Nishida, Kunihiro; Catheline, Daniel; Legrand, Philippe; Hatem, StÃ©phane; Nattel, Stanley\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of heart failure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a new pure docosahexaenoic acid derivative called F 16915 in experimental models of heart failure-induced atria dysfunction. The atrial dysfunction-induced AF was investigated (1) in a dog model of tachypacing-induced congestive heart failure and (2) in a rat model of heart failure induced by occlusion of left descending coronary artery and 2 months reperfusion. F 16915 (5 g/day for 4 weeks) significantly reduced the mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing in the dog model (989 Â± 111 s in the vehicle group to 79 Â± 59 s with F 16915, P < 0.01). This dose of F 16915 also significantly reduced the incidence of sustained AF (5/5 dogs in the vehicle group versus 1/5 with F 16915, P < 0.05). In the rat model, the percentage of shortening fraction in the F 16915 group (100 mg/kg p.o. daily) was significantly restored after 2 months (32.6 Â± 7.4 %, n = 9 vs 17.6 Â± 3.4 %, n = 9 in the vehicle group, P < 0.01). F 16915 also reduced the de-phosphorylation of connexin43 from atria tissue. The present results show that treatment with F 16915 reduced the heart dilation, resynchronized the gap junction activity, and reduced the AF duration in models of heart failure. Thus, F 16915 constitutes a promising new drug as upstream therapy for the treatment of AF in patients with heart failure.\n\nConcomitant Wolff-Parkinson-White and Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia: Which Pathway to Ablate?\n\nPubMed\n\nSarsam, Sinan; Sidiqi, Ibrahim; Shah, Dipak; Zughaib, Marcel\n\n2015-12-11\n\nAtrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common form of supraventricular tachycardia. In contrast, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern consists of an accessory pathway, which may result in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Frequent tachycardia caused by AVNRT and accessory pathways may play a role in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A 54-year-old man presented with palpitations and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. His baseline EKG showed Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern. While hospitalized, he had an episode of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). He underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for AVNRT, and his accessory pathway was also ablated even though its conduction was found to be weak. He was clinically doing well on follow-up visit, with resolution of his heart failure symptoms and normalization of left ventricular function on echocardiography. This case raises the question whether the accessory pathway plays a role in the development of systolic dysfunction, and if there is any role for ablation in patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern.\n\nIschemic Ventricular Tachycardia Presenting as a Narrow Complex Tachycardia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPage, Stephen P; Watts, Troy; Yeo, Wee Tiong; Mehul, Dhinoja\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis report describes a patient presenting with a narrow complex tachycardia in the context of prior myocardial infarction and impaired ventricular function. Electrophysiological studies confirmed ventricular tachycardia and activation and entrainment mapping demonstrated a critical isthmus within an area of scar involving the His-Purkinje system accounting for the narrow QRS morphology. This very rare case shares some similarities with upper septal ventricular tachycardia seen in patients with structurally normal hearts, but to our knowledge has not been seen previously in patients with ischemic heart disease.

Although the central sympatholytic drug moxonidine is an established therapeutic strategy for hypertension, its benefits for hypertensive heart failure are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of central sympathoinhibition by intracerebral infusion of moxonidine on survival in a rat model of hypertensive heart failure and the possible mechanisms involved. As a model of hypertensive heart failure, we fed Dahl salt-sensitive rats an 8% NaCl diet from 7 weeks of age. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of moxonidine (moxonidine-ICV-treated group [Mox-ICV]) or vehicle (vehicle-ICV-treated group [Veh-ICV]) was performed at 14-20 weeks of age, during the increased heart failure phase. Survival rates were examined, and sympathetic activity, left ventricular function and remodelling, and brain oxidative stress were measured. Hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were established by 13 weeks of age. At around 20 weeks of age, Veh-ICV rats exhibited overt heart failure concomitant with increased urinary norepinephrine (uNE) excretion as an index of sympathetic activity, dilated left ventricle, decreased percentage fractional shortening, and myocardial fibrosis. Survival rates at 21 weeks of age (nâ=â28) were only 23% in Veh-ICV rats, and 76% (nâ=â17) in Mox-ICV rats with concomitant decreases in uNE, myocardial fibrosis, collagen type I/III ratio, brain oxidative stress, and suppressed left ventricular dysfunction. Moxonidine-induced central sympathoinhibition attenuated brain oxidative stress, prevented cardiac dysfunction and remodelling, and improved the prognosis in rats with hypertensive heart failure. Central sympathoinhibition can be effective for the treatment of hypertensive heart failure.\n\nPathological alterations in liver injury following congestive heart failure induced by volume overload in rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShaqura, Mohammed; Mohamed, Doaa M.; Aboryag, Noureddin B.; Bedewi, Lama; Dehe, Lukas; Treskatsch, Sascha; Shakibaei, Mehdi; SchÃ¤fer, Michael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHeart failure has emerged as a disease with significant public health implications. Following progression of heart failure, heart and liver dysfunction are frequently combined in hospitalized patients leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Here, we investigated the underlying pathological alterations in liver injury following heart failure. Heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. Sham operated and ACF rats were compared for their morphometric and hemodynamic data, for histopathological and ultrastructural changes in the liver as well as differences in the expression of apoptotic factors. ACF-induced heart failure is associated with light microscopic signs of apparent congestion of blood vessels, increased apoptosis and breakdown of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell inifltration were observed. The glycogen content depletion associated with the increased hepatic fibrosis, lipid globule formation was observed in ACF rats. Moreover, cytoplasmic organelles are no longer distinguishable in many ACF hepatocytes with degenerated fragmented rough endoplasmic reticulum, shrunken mitochondria and heavy cytoplasm vacuolization. ACF is associated with the upregulation of the hepatic TUNEL-positive cells and proapoptotic factor Bax protein concomitant with the mitochondrial leakage of cytochrome C into the cell cytoplasm and the transfer of activated caspase 3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus indicating intrinsic apoptotic events. Taken together, the results demonstrate that ACF-induced congestive heart failure causes liver injury which results in hepatocellular apoptotic cell death mediated by the intrinsic pathway of mitochondrial cytochrome C leakage and subsequent transfer of activated caspase 3 into to the nucleus to initiate overt DNA fragmentation and cell death.

Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias is needed to facilitate new therapeutic approaches for the hypertensive, failing right ventricle (RV). The aim of our study was to identify the mechanisms generating arrhythmias in a model of RV failure induced by pulmonary hypertension. Rats were injected with monocrotaline to induce either RV hypertrophy or failure or with saline (control). ECGs were measured in conscious, unrestrained animals by telemetry. In isolated hearts, electrical activity was measured by optical mapping and myofiber orientation by diffusion tensor-MRI. Sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ handling was studied in single myocytes. Compared with control animals, the T-wave of the ECG was prolonged and in three of seven heart failure animals, prominent T-wave alternans occurred. Discordant action potential (AP) alternans occurred in isolated failing hearts and Ca2+ transient alternans in failing myocytes. In failing hearts, AP duration and dispersion were increased; conduction velocity and AP restitution were steeper. The latter was intrinsic to failing single myocytes. Failing hearts had greater fiber angle disarray; this correlated with AP duration. Failing myocytes had reduced sarco(endo)plasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase activity, increased sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-release fraction, and increased Ca2+ spark leak. In hypertrophied hearts and myocytes, dysfunctional adaptation had begun, but alternans did not develop. We conclude that increased electrical and structural heterogeneity and dysfunctional sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ handling increased the probability of alternans, a proarrhythmic predictor of sudden cardiac death. These mechanisms are potential therapeutic targets for the correction of arrhythmias in hypertensive, failing RVs.

Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for G protein-coupled receptors, including protease-activated receptors (PARs), in the pathology of heart hypertrophy and failure. Activation of PAR-2 on cardiomyocytes has been shown to induce hypertrophic growth in vitro. PAR-2 also contributes to myocardial infarction and heart remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we found that PAR-2 induced hypertrophic growth of cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes in a MEK1/2 and p38 dependent manner. In addition, PAR-2 activation on mouse cardiomyocytes increased expression of the pro-fibrotic chemokine MCP-1. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of PAR-2 in mice induced heart hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, inflammation and heart failure. Finally, in a mouse model of myocardial infarction induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, PAR-2 deficiency attenuated heart remodeling and improved heart function independently of its contribution to the size of the initial infarct. Taken together, our data indicate that PAR-2 signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and heart failure.

However, the role of gallic acid in heart failure remains unknown. In this study, we show that gallic acid administration prevents heart failure-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Heart failure induced in mice, 8weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery, was confirmed by echocardiography. Treatment for 2weeks with gallic acid but not furosemide prevented cardiac dysfunction in mice. Gallic acid significantly inhibited TAC-induced pathological changes in the lungs, such as increased lung mass, pulmonary fibrosis, and damaged alveolar morphology. It also decreased the expression of fibrosis-related genes, including collagen types I and III, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and phosphorylated Smad3. Further, it inhibited the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, E-cadherin, SNAI1, and TWIST1. We suggest that gallic acid has therapeutic potential for the treatment of heart failure-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Advanced heart failure in hypothyroid patients has been described only in severe symptomatic cases, mostly during myxedematous coma. We describe an unusual case of asymptomatic patient with hypothyroidism who presented with severely reduced cardiac function with elevated cardiac enzymes reflecting significant myocardial injury. Comprehensive evaluation for heart failure was suggestive only for long-standing untreated hypothyroidism. Endomyocadial biopsy demonstrated unique histological findings of mucopolysaccharide accumulation attributed to hypothyroid state. Asymptomatic hypothyroidism may cause severe reduction in cardiac function accompanied with elevated cardiac enzymes. To our knowledge, this is the first description of human myocardial biopsy revealing mucopolysaccharide accumulation attributed to hypothyroid state.\n\nOxymatrine attenuated isoproterenol-induced heart failure in rats via regulation of COX-2/PGI2 pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Ru; Xu, Qingbin; Xu, Yehua; Xiong, Aiqin; Wang, Yang; Ma, Ping\n\n2016-12-01\n\nOxymatrine (OMT) is an active constituent of traditional Chinese herb Sophora japonica Ait which has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory,anti-oxidant and anti-fibrosis properties. Our previous studies have demonstrated that OMT has protective effects on isoproterenol-induced heart failure in rats through regulation of DDAH/ADMA metabolism pathway.In this study,we further investigated whether OMT could attenuate isoproterenol-induced heart failure through the regulation of COX-2/PGI 2 pathway. Heart failure was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by 5mg/kg isoproterenol subcutaneous injection for 7days. The rats were maintained on normal diet and randomly divided into five groups: control, isoproterenol, isoproterenol with OMT (50, 100mg/kg), and OMT alone groups (n=12 in each group). Serum brain natruretic peptide (BNP, a heart failure biomarker), histopathological variables, expression of Cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2 ), cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) were analysed. Administration of OMT significantly reduced the increased BNP in plasm of isoproterenol-induced rats, attenuated cardiac fibrosis,suppressed overexpression of myocardial COX-1 expression, up-regulated COX-2 and PGIS expression, but had no effects on isoproterenol-induced elevated protein cPLA 2 . And compared with control group, any indexes in sham rats treated with OMT (100mg/kg) alone were unaltered. These results demonstrated that OMT has cardioprotective effects on isoproterenol-induced heart failure in rats by regulating COX-2/PGI 2 pathway. Copyright Â© 2016.

Case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nAlvarado S, Jorge Luis; FernÃ¡ndez V, Zhirly Andrea\n\n2014-04-01\n\nNeonatal hyperthyroidism is usually a self-limited condition frequently associated with transplacental passage of thyroid stimulating antibodies secondary to maternal autoimmune disorders. To timely detect mothers with this medical antecedents decreases the risk for fetal adverse events. To report a case of neonatal hyperthyroidism associated with intrauterine growth restriction and heart failure. A 36 week-old newborn with birth weight of 1,240 g. Symptoms were tachycardia, distal coldness, exophthalmos, hepatomegaly and tremors. Echocardiogram ruled out structural heart disorders. Due to maternal symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, TSH tests were performed showing 0.01 ulU/ml, free T4 7.7 ng/dl, so the diagnosis of neonatal hyperthyroidism was confirmed. It was treated with methimazole and propanol, alleviating the symptoms and decreasing the levels of free T4. To know the maternal history helps identify and manage neonatal complications of hyperthyroidism. Heart failure and other cardiopulmonary disorders are determinants of mortality during early neonatal period. High-risk newborns should receive follow up assessments.\n\nMitochondrial proteome remodelling in pressure overload-induced heart failure: the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDai, Dao-Fu; Hsieh, Edward J.; Liu, Yonggang; Chen, Tony; Beyer, Richard P.; Chin, Michael T.; MacCoss, Michael J.; Rabinovitch, Peter S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAims We investigate the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in mitochondrial proteome remodelling using mouse models of heart failure induced by pressure overload. Methods and results We demonstrate that mice overexpressing catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT) attenuate pressure overload-induced heart failure. An improved method of label-free unbiased analysis of the mitochondrial proteome was applied to the mouse model of heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). A total of 425 mitochondrial proteins were compared between wild-type and mCAT mice receiving TAC or sham surgery. The changes in the mitochondrial proteome in heart failure included decreased abundance of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism, an increased abundance of proteins in glycolysis, apoptosis, mitochondrial unfolded protein response and proteolysis, transcription and translational control, and developmental processes as well as responses to stimuli. Overexpression of mCAT better preserved proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and attenuated the increases in apoptotic and proteolytic enzymes. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis also showed that monosaccharide metabolic processes and protein folding/proteolysis were only overrepresented in mCAT but not in wild-type mice in response to TAC. Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that scavenging mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mCAT not only attenuates most of the mitochondrial proteome changes in heart failure, but also induces a subset of unique alterations. These changes represent processes that are adaptive to the increased work and metabolic requirements of pressure overload, but which are normally inhibited by overproduction of mitochondrial ROS.

However, almost no data exists on the use of this technology in catheter ablation of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia in patients with congenital heart disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of contact force monitoring during catheter ablation of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia in those patients. Catheter ablation of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia using monitoring of catheter contact force was performed in 28 patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Thirty-two patients matched according to gender, age, and body weight with congenital heart disease undergoing catheter ablation without contact force monitoring served as control group. Parameters reflecting acute procedural success, long-term efficacy, and safety were compared. Acute procedural success was statistically not different in both groups (contact force 93Â % vs. control 84Â %, pâ=â0.3). Likewise the recurrence rate 1Â year after ablation as shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis did not differ (contact force 28Â % vs. control 37Â %, pâ=â0.63). Major complications were restricted to groin vessel injuries and occurred in 3 out of 60 patients (contact force nâ=â1; control nâ=â2). Complications related to excessive catheter contact force were not observed. The present study did not show superiority of catheter contact force monitoring during ablation of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia in patients with CHD in terms of efficacy and safety. Higher contact force compared to pulmonary vein isolation might therefore be required to increase the efficacy of catheter ablation of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia in patients with congenital heart disease.\n\nThyroid Echography-induced Thyroid Storm and Exacerbation of Acute Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakabayashi, Keisuke; Nakazawa, Naomi; Suzuki, Toshiaki; Asano, Ryotaro; Saito, Hideki; Nomura, Hidekimi; Isomura, Daichi; Okada, Hisayuki; Sugiura, Ryo; Oka, Toshiaki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHyperthyroidism and thyroid storm affect cardiac circulation in some conditions. Several factors including trauma can induce thyroid storms. We herein describe the case of a 57-year-old woman who experienced a thyroid storm and exacerbation of acute heart failure on thyroid echography. She initially demonstrated a good clinical course after medical rate control for atrial fibrillation; however, thyroid echography for evaluating hyperthyroidism led to a thyroid storm and she collapsed. A multidisciplinary approach stabilized her thyroid hormone levels and hemodynamics. Thus, the medical staff should be prepared for a deterioration in the patient's condition during thyroid echography in heart failure patients with hyperthyroidism.\n\nHeart-rate variability depression in porcine peritonitis-induced sepsis without organ failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nJarkovska, Dagmar; Valesova, Lenka; Chvojka, Jiri; Benes, Jan; Danihel, Vojtech; Sviglerova, Jitka; Nalos, Lukas; Matejovic, Martin; Stengl, Milan\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDepression of heart-rate variability (HRV) in conditions of systemic inflammation has been shown in both patients and experimental animal models and HRV has been suggested as an early indicator of sepsis. The sensitivity of HRV-derived parameters to the severity of sepsis, however, remains unclear. In this study we modified the clinically relevant porcine model of peritonitis-induced sepsis in order to avoid the development of organ failure and to test the sensitivity of HRV to such non-severe conditions. In 11 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and instrumented domestic pigs of both sexes, sepsis was induced by fecal peritonitis. The dose of feces was adjusted and antibiotic therapy was administered to avoid multiorgan failure. Experimental subjects were screened for 40âh from the induction of sepsis. In all septic animals, sepsis with hyperdynamic circulation and increased plasma levels of inflammatory mediators developed within 12âh from the induction of peritonitis. The sepsis did not progress to multiorgan failure and there was no spontaneous death during the experiment despite a modest requirement for vasopressor therapy in most animals (9/11). A pronounced reduction of HRV and elevation of heart rate developed quickly (within 5âh, time constant of 1.97âÂ±â0.80âh for HRV parameter TINN) upon the induction of sepsis and were maintained throughout the experiment. The frequency domain analysis revealed a decrease in the high-frequency component. The reduction of HRV parameters and elevation of heart rate preceded sepsis-associated hemodynamic changes by several hours (time constant of 11.28âÂ±â2.07âh for systemic vascular resistance decline). A pronounced and fast reduction of HRV occurred in the setting of a moderate experimental porcine sepsis without organ failure. Inhibition of parasympathetic cardiac signaling probably represents the main mechanism of HRV reduction in sepsis.

We previously demonstrated that enhanced central sympathetic outflow is associated with brain toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) probably mediated by brain angiotensin II type 1 receptor in mice with myocardial infarction (MI)-induced heart failure. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether silencing brain TLR4 could prevent LV remodeling with sympathoinhibition in MI-induced heart failure. MI-induced heart failure model rats were created by ligation of left coronary artery. The expression level of TLR4 in brainstem was significantly higher in MI-induced heart failure treated with intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of hGAPDH-SiRNA than in sham. TLR4 in brainstem was significantly lower in MI-induced heart failure treated with ICV injection of TLR4-SiRNA than in that treated with ICV injection of hGAPDH-SiRNA. Lung weight, urinary norepinephrine excretion, and LV end-diastolic pressure were significantly lower and LV dimension was significantly smaller in MI-induced heart failure treated with TLR4-SiRNA than in that treated with hGAPDH-SiRNA for 2 weeks. Partially silencing brain TLR4 by ICV injection of TLR4-SiRNA for 2 weeks could in part prevent LV remodeling with sympathoinhibition in rats with MI-induced heart failure. Brain TLR4 has a potential to be a target of the treatment for MI-induced heart failure.\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia induced by chocolate: is chocolate too sweet for the heart?\n\nPubMed\n\nParasramka, Saurabh; Dufresne, Alix\n\n2012-09-01\n\nConflicting studies have been published concerning the association between chocolate and cardiovascular diseases. Fewer articles have described the potential arrhythmogenic risk related to chocolate intake. We present a case of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in a woman after consumption of large quantity of chocolate. A 53-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented to us with complaints of palpitations and shortness of breath after consuming large amounts of chocolate. Electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia at 165 beats per minute, which was restored to sinus rhythm after adenosine bolus injection. Electrophysiology studies showed atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, which are methylxanthines and are competitive antagonists of adenosine and can have arrhythmogenic potential. Our case very well describes an episode of tachycardia precipitated by large amount of chocolate consumption in a patient with underlying substrate. There are occasional case reports describing association between chocolate, caffeine, and arrhythmias. A large Danish study, however, did not find any association between amount of daily caffeine consumption and risk of arrhythmia.\n\nCardioprotective Effects of QiShenYiQi Dripping Pills on Transverse Aortic Constriction-Induced Heart Failure in Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuan, Guoran; Ren, Haojin; Zhang, Chi; Zhu, Xiaogang; Xu, Chao; Wang, Liyue\n\n2018-01-01\n\nQiShenYiQi dripping pills (QSYQ), a traditional Chinese medicine, are commonly used to treat coronary heart disease, and QSYQ was recently approved as a complementary treatment for ischemic heart failure in China. However, only few studies reported on whether QSYQ exerts a protective effect on heart failure induced by pressure overload. In this study, we explored the role of QSYQ in a mouse model of heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Twenty-eight C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: Sham + NS group, Sham + QSYQ group, TAC + NS group, and TAC + QSYQ group. QSYQ dissolved in normal saline (NS) was administered intragastrically (3.5 mg/100 g/day) in the Sham + QSYQ and TAC + QSYQ groups. In the Sham + NS and TAC + NS groups, NS was provided every day intragastrically. Eight weeks after TAC, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization were performed to evaluate the cardiac function, and immunofluorescent staining with anti-actinin2 antibody was performed to determine the structure of the myocardial fibers. Moreover, TUNEL staining and Masson trichrome staining were employed to assess the effects of QSYQ on cardiac apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Western blots and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to measure the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the heart, and immunohistochemical staining with anti-CD31 antibody was performed to explore the role of QSYQ in cardiac angiogenesis. Results showed that TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction and disrupted structure of myocardial fibers significantly improved after QSYQ treatment. Moreover, QSYQ treatment also significantly improved cardiac apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis in TAC-induced heart failure, which was accompanied by an increase in VEGF expression levels and maintenance of microvessel density in the heart. In conclusion, QSYQ exerts a protective effect on TAC-induced heart failure, which could be attributed to enhanced cardiac angiogenesis\n\nImpact of tachycardia and sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor test on cardiac diastology and arterial function in elderly females.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Jonas; HÃ¥kansson, Felicia; Shahgaldi, Kambiz; Manouras, Aristomenis; Norman, Mikael; SahlÃ©n, Anders\n\n2013-04-01\n\nAbnormal vascular-ventricular coupling has been suggested to contribute to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in elderly females. Failure to increase stroke volume (SV) during exercise occurs in parallel with dynamic changes in arterial physiology leading to increased afterload. Such adverse vascular reactivity during stress may reflect either sympathoexcitation or be due to tachycardia. We hypothesized that afterload elevation induces SV failure by transiently attenuating left ventricular relaxation, a phenomenon described in animal research. The respective roles of tachycardia and sympathoexcitation were investigated in n = 28 elderly females (70 Â± 4 yr) carrying permanent pacemakers. At rest, during atrial tachycardia pacing (ATP; 100 min(-1)) and during cold pressor test (hand immersed in ice water), we performed Doppler echocardiography (maximal untwist rate analyzed by speckle tracking imaging of rotational mechanics) and arterial tonometry (arterial stiffness estimated as augmentation index). Estimation of arterial compliance was based on an exponential relationship between arterial pressure and volume. We found that ATP produced central hypovolemia and a reduction in SV which was larger in patients with stiffer arteries (higher augmentation index). There was an associated adverse response of arterial compliance and vascular resistance during ATP and cold pressor test, causing an overall increase in afterload, but nonetheless enhanced maximal rate of untwist and no evidence of afterload-dependent failure of relaxation. In conclusion, tachycardia and cold provocation in elderly females produces greater vascular reactivity and SV failure in the presence of arterial stiffening, but SV failure does not arise secondary to afterload-dependent attenuation of relaxation.\n\nSildenafil ameliorates left ventricular T-tubule remodeling in a pressure overload-induced murine heart failure model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Chun-kai; Chen, Bi-yi; Guo, Ang; Chen, Rong; Zhu, Yan-qi; Kutschke, William; Hong, Jiang; Song, Long-sheng\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, has been shown to exert beneficial effects in heart failure. The purpose of this study was to test whether sildenafil suppressed transverse-tubule (T-tubule) remodeling in left ventricular (LV) failure and thereby providing the therapeutic benefits. Methods: A pressure overload-induced murine heart failure model was established in mice by thoracic aortic banding (TAB). One day after TAB, the mice received sildenafil (100 mgÂ·kgâ1Â·dâ1, sc) or saline for 5 weeks. At the end of treatment, echocardiography was used to examine LV function. Then the intact hearts were dissected out and placed in Langendorff-perfusion chamber for in situ confocal imaging of T-tubule ultrastructure from epicardial myocytes. Results: TAB surgery resulted in heart failure accompanied by remarkable T-tubule remodeling. Sildenafil treatment significantly attenuated TAB-induced cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure, improved LV contractile function, and preserved T-tubule integrity in LV cardiomyocytes. But sildenafil treatment did not significantly affect the chamber dilation. The integrity of LV T-tubule structure was correlated with cardiac hypertrophy (R2=0.74, P<0.01) and global LV function (R2=0.47, P<0.01). Conclusion: Sildenafil effectively ameliorates LV T-tubule remodeling in TAB mice, revealing a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic benefits of sildenafil in heart failure.

We previously studied 354 patients prescribed amiodarone in whom the occurrence of hyperthyroidism was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke and even death [1]. We now present a case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism complicated by isolated right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism. Detailed quantitative echocardiography enables improved understanding of the haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the condition.

These proposed benefits arise from the inter-related pathophysiologies of diabetes and heart failure (diabetes increases the risk of heart failure, and heart failure can induce insulin resistance) and also in light of the dysfunctional myocardial energetics seen in heart failure. The normal heart utilizes predominantly fatty acids for energy production, but there is some evidence to suggest that increased myocardial glucose uptake may be beneficial for the failing heart. Thus, GLP-1 agonists, which stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release and enhance myocardial glucose uptake, have become a focus of investigation in both animal models and humans with heart failure. Limited pilot data for GLP-1 agonists shows potential improvements in systolic function, hemodynamics, and quality of life, forming the basis for current phase II trials.\n\n[Understanding heart failure].\n\nPubMed\n\nBoo, JosÃ© Fernando Guadalajara\n\n2006-01-01\n\nHeart failure is a disease with several definitions. The term \"heart failure\" is used by has brougth about confusion in the terminology. For this reason, the value of the ejection fraction (< 0.40 or < 0.35) is used in most meganalyses on the treatment of heart failure, avoiding the term \"heart failure\" that is a confounding concept. In this paper we carefully analyze the meaning of contractility, ventricular function or performance, preload, afterload, heart failure, compensation mechanisms in heart failure, myocardial oxygen consumption, inadequate, adequate and inappropriate hypertrophy, systole, diastole, compliance, problems of relaxation, and diastolic dysfunction. Their definitions are supported by the original scientific descriptions in an attempt to clarify the concepts about ventricular function and heart failure and, in this way, use the same scientific language about the meaning of ventricular function, heart failure, and diastolic dysfunction.\n\nHeart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nMetra, Marco; Teerlink, John R\n\n2017-10-28\n\nHeart failure is common in adults, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence is increasing because of ageing of the population and improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events, despite the efficacy of many therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), Î² blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and advanced device therapies. Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population. Although some data suggest that spironolactone might improve outcomes in these patients, no therapy has conclusively shown a significant effect. Hopefully, future studies will address these unmet needs for patients with heart failure. Admissions for acute heart failure continue to increase but, to date, no new therapies have improved clinical outcomes. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Gene mutations associated with cardiomyopathies can lead to various pathologies of heart failure. In recent years, zebrafish, Danio rerio, has emerged as an excellent model to study human cardiovascular diseases such as congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, and preclinical development of drugs targeting these diseases. In this review, we will first summarize zebrafish genetic models of heart failure arose from cardiomyopathy, which is caused by mutations in sarcomere, calcium or mitochondrial-associated genes. Moreover, we outline zebrafish heart failure models triggered by chemical compounds. Elucidation of these models will improve the understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis and provide potential targets for novel therapies.\n\nAlterations in left ventricular diastolic function in conscious dogs with pacing-induced heart failure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKomamura, K.; Shannon, R. P.; Pasipoularides, A.; Ihara, T.; Lader, A. S.; Patrick, T. A.; Bishop, S. P.; Vatner, S. F.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWe investigated in conscious dogs (a) the effects of heart failure induced by chronic rapid ventricular pacing on the sequence of development of left ventricular (LV) diastolic versus systolic dysfunction and (b) whether the changes were load dependent or secondary to alterations in structure. LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction were evident within 24 h after initiation of pacing and occurred in parallel over 3 wk. LV systolic function was reduced at 3 wk, i.e., peak LV dP/dt fell by -1,327 +/- 105 mmHg/s and ejection fraction by -22 +/- 2%. LV diastolic dysfunction also progressed over 3 wk of pacing, i.e., tau increased by +14.0 +/- 2.8 ms and the myocardial stiffness constant by +6.5 +/- 1.4, whereas LV chamber stiffness did not change. These alterations were associated with increases in LV end-systolic (+28.6 +/- 5.7 g/cm2) and LV end-diastolic stresses (+40.4 +/- 5.3 g/cm2). When stresses and heart rate were matched at the same levels in the control and failure states, the increases in tau and myocardial stiffness were no longer observed, whereas LV systolic function remained depressed. There were no increases in connective tissue content in heart failure. Thus, pacing-induced heart failure in conscious dogs is characterized by major alterations in diastolic function which are reversible with normalization of increased loading condition.\n\nFour faces of baroreflex failure: hypertensive crisis, volatile hypertension, orthostatic tachycardia, and malignant vagotonia\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKetch, Terry; Biaggioni, Italo; Robertson, RoseMarie; Robertson, David\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: The baroreflex normally serves to buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure and heart rate occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences. METHODS AND RESULTS: Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis is the most common presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or in the absence of an acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant vagotonia with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control.\n\nA Case of Refractory Heart Failure in Becker Muscular Dystrophy Improved With Corticosteroid Therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Makiko; Sunagawa, Osahiko; Hokama, Ryo; Tsuchiya, Hiroyuki; Miyara, Takafumi; Taba, Yoji; Touma, Takashi\n\n2016-09-28\n\nThe patient was a 26 year-old man who was referred to our hospital in June 2011 because of severe heart failure. At age 24 years, he was found to have Becker muscular dystrophy. He received enalapril for cardiac dysfunction; however, he had worsening heart failure and was thus referred to our hospital. Echocardiography showed enlargement of the left ventricle, with a diastolic dimension of 77 mm and ejection fraction of 19%. His condition improved temporarily after an infusion of dobutamine and milrinone. He was then administered amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia; however, he subsequently developed hemoptysis. Amiodarone was discontinued and corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered followed by oral prednisolone (PSL). His creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level and cardiomegaly improved after the corticosteroid therapy. The PSL dose was reduced gradually, bisoprolol was introduced, and the catecholamine infusion was tapered. A cardiac resynchronization device was implanted; however, the patient's condition gradually worsened, which necessitated dobutamine infusion for heart failure. We readministered 30 mg PSL, which decreased the CPK level and improved the cardiomegaly. The dobutamine infusion was discontinued, and the patient was discharged. He was given 7.5 mg PSL as an outpatient, and he returned to normal life without exacerbation of the heart failure. There are similar reports showing that corticosteroids are effective for skeletal muscle improvement in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, their effectiveness for heart failure has been rarely reported. We experienced a case of Becker muscular dystrophy in which corticosteroid therapy was effective for refractory heart failure.\n\nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nPSVT; Supraventricular tachycardia; Abnormal heart rhythm - PSVT; Arrhythmia - PSVT; Rapid heart rate - PSVT; Fast heart rate - PSVT ...

This study aimed to evaluate MR to better understand the multitude of factors contributing to its development. Heart failure was induced by rapid ventricular pacing (230 beats/min) in 40 mongrel dogs. Left ventricular (LV) size and MR were evaluated echocardiographically. LV contractility was analyzed using a conductance catheter. MR increased to mild in 12 animals (regurgitant orifice area, 0.06+/-0.05 cm(2)), moderate in 15 (0.14+/-0.07 cm(2)), and severe in 13 (0.34+/-0.16 cm(2)). The grade of MR had an inverse relationships with E(max) (the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, p<0.01) and dE/dt (the slope of the maximum rate of change of pressure-end-diastolic volume [V(ED)] relationship, p<0.01) and positive relationships with V(ED) and end-diastolic cross-sectional areas and lengths (p<0.05) by univariate analysis. The dE/dt had an independently significant (p<0.01) relationship by multivariable logistic regression. Many factors influence the development of MR and because of its similarity to the clinical situation, this model can be used to investigate MR and heart failure, as well as new surgical therapies.\n\nHeart Failure as an Aging-Related Phenotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorita, Hiroyuki; Komuro, Issei\n\n2018-01-27\n\nThe molecular pathophysiology of heart failure, which is one of the leading causes of mortality, is not yet fully understood. Heart failure can be regarded as a systemic syndrome of aging-related phenotypes. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and the p53 pathway, both of which are key regulators of aging, have been demonstrated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Circulating C1q was identified as a novel activator of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, promoting systemic aging-related phenotypes including sarcopenia and heart failure. On the other hand, p53 induces the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in the failing heart. In these molecular mechanisms, the cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes (e,g,. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, macrophages) deserves mentioning. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology underlying heart failure, focusing on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and the p53 pathway.\n\nActivation of PPAR-Î± in the early stage of heart failure maintained myocardial function and energetics in pressure-overload heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaimoto, Satoshi; Hoshino, Atsushi; Ariyoshi, Makoto; Okawa, Yoshifumi; Tateishi, Shuhei; Ono, Kazunori; Uchihashi, Motoki; Fukai, Kuniyoshi; Iwai-Kanai, Eri; Matoba, Satoaki\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFailing heart loses its metabolic flexibility, relying increasingly on glucose as its preferential substrate and decreasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPAR-Î±) is a key regulator of this substrate shift. However, its role during heart failure is complex and remains unclear. Recent studies reported that heart failure develops in the heart of myosin heavy chain-PPAR-Î± transgenic mice in a manner similar to that of diabetic cardiomyopathy, whereas cardiac dysfunction is enhanced in PPAR-Î± knockout mice in response to chronic pressure overload. We created a pressure-overload heart failure model in mice through transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and activated PPAR-Î± during heart failure using an inducible transgenic model. After 8 wk of TAC, left ventricular (LV) function had decreased with the reduction of PPAR-Î± expression in wild-type mice. We examined the effect of PPAR-Î± induction during heart failure using the Tet-Off system. Eight weeks after the TAC operation, LV construction was preserved significantly by PPAR-Î± induction with an increase in PPAR-Î±-targeted genes related to fatty acid metabolism. The increase of expression of fibrosis-related genes was significantly attenuated by PPAR-Î± induction. Metabolic rates measured by isolated heart perfusions showed a reduction in FAO and glucose oxidation in TAC hearts, but the rate of FAO preserved significantly owing to the induction of PPAR-Î±. Myocardial high-energy phosphates were significantly preserved by PPAR-Î± induction. These results suggest that PPAR-Î± activation during pressure-overloaded heart failure improved myocardial function and energetics. Thus activating PPAR-Î± and modulation of FAO could be a promising therapeutic strategy for heart failure. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study demonstrates the role of PPAR-Î± activation in the early stage of heart failure using an inducible transgenic mouse model.

Frailty is a clinical syndrome that geriatricians attach great importance to. Like many other diseases chronic heart failure can cause frailty. Based on the experience that we see only a small correlation between the functional capacity of patients with heart failure and the results of cardiological findings, the model of peripheral myopathy in chronic heart failure was developed. Different pathophysiological changes may cause the increasing exercise intolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. We can already consider different experimental approaches to the therapy of frailty caused by chronic heart failure. At the moment we have to focus our efforts on an optimal therapy of heart failure, especially with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and on individual endurance and strength training.\n\nRodent heart failure models do not reflect the human circulating microRNA signature in heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nVegter, Eline L; Ovchinnikova, Ekaterina S; SilljÃ©, Herman H W; Meems, Laura M G; van der Pol, Atze; van der Velde, A Rogier; Berezikov, Eugene; Voors, Adriaan A; de Boer, Rudolf A; van der Meer, Peter\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe recently identified a set of plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) that are downregulated in patients with heart failure in comparison with control subjects. To better understand their meaning and function, we sought to validate these circulating miRNAs in 3 different well-established rat and mouse heart failure models, and correlated the miRNAs to parameters of cardiac function. The previously identified let-7i-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-18a-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-30e-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-423-5p and miR-652-3p were measured by means of quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in plasma samples of 8 homozygous TGR(mREN2)27 (Ren2) transgenic rats and 8 (control) Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 mice with angiotensin II-induced heart failure (AngII) and 6 control mice, and 8 mice with ischemic heart failure and 6 controls. Circulating miRNA levels were compared between the heart failure animals and healthy controls. Ren2 rats, AngII mice and mice with ischemic heart failure showed clear signs of heart failure, exemplified by increased left ventricular and lung weights, elevated end-diastolic left ventricular pressures, increased expression of cardiac stress markers and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. All miRNAs were detectable in plasma from rats and mice. No significant differences were observed between the circulating miRNAs in heart failure animals when compared to the healthy controls (all P>0.05) and no robust associations with cardiac function could be found. The previous observation that miRNAs circulate in lower levels in human patients with heart failure could not be validated in well-established rat and mouse heart failure models. These results question the translation of data on human circulating miRNA levels to experimental models, and vice versa the validity of experimental miRNA data for human heart failure.\n\nRapid-rate nonsustained ventricular tachycardia found on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interrogation: relationship to outcomes in the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial).\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Jay; Johnson, George; Hellkamp, Anne S; Anderson, Jill; Mark, Daniel B; Lee, Kerry L; Bardy, Gust H; Poole, Jeanne E\n\n2013-05-28\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine rapid-rate nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (RR-NSVT) during routine implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) evaluation in patients with heart failure and its relationship to outcomes. The clinical implications of RR-NSVT identified during routine ICD interrogation are unclear. In this study, the occurrence of RR-NSVT and its association with ICD shocks and mortality in SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial) were examined. The 811 patients who received ICDs in SCD-HeFT constituted the study population. The occurrence of RR-NSVT and its association with ICD shocks and mortality in SCD-HeFT were examined. RR-NSVT was documented on ICD interrogation in 186 of 811 patients (22.9%). The mean duration of RR-NSVT was 26.4 Â± 9.1 beats (7.5 Â± 2.6 s), with a mean cycle length of 259 Â± 32 ms. Polymorphic RR-NSVT accounted for 56% of episodes. Compared with patients without RR-NSVT, those with RR-NSVT were less likely to be taking beta-blockers, statins, or aspirin at enrollment. After adjusting for other known predictors of mortality in SCD-HeFT, RR-NSVT was independently associated with appropriate ICD shocks (hazard ratio: 4.25; 95% confidence interval: 2.94 to 6.14; p < 0.0001), with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 2.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.62 to 3.54; p < 0.0001), and with a composite of all-cause mortality and appropriate ICD shocks (hazard ratio: 3.03; 95% confidence interval: 2.21 to 4.15; p < 0.0001). RR-NSVT identified on routine ICD interrogation should be considered an important clinical event. RR-NSVT during ICD interrogation is associated with appropriate ICD shocks and all-cause mortality. The clinical evaluation of patients with RR-NSVT should include intensification of medical therapy, particularly beta-blockers, or other appropriate clinical interventions.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed irregular wide QRS complex tachycardia with a slur at the initial portion of the QRS complex. He had preexisting long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, but early excitation syndrome had never been noted. Chest X-ray showed heart enlargement and pulmonary congestion. He was diagnosed with late onset of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and congestive heart failure was probably caused by rapid ventricular response of atrial fibrillation through the accessory pathway. Emergency catheter ablation for the accessory pathway was undertaken, and heart failure was dramatically improved.\n\nUnderstanding chronic heart failure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFenton, Matthew; Burch, Michael\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe key principles of chronic heart failure and the development of clinical management strategies are described. The physiological changes in chronic heart failure and the clinical management of children with heart failure are considered, but the treatment of heart failure related to congenital heart disease or the intensive care management of heart failure are not mentioned as both topics require consideration in their own right. A greater understanding of the maladaptive responses to chronic heart failure has enabled targeted therapy to be introduced with consequent improvement in symptoms, reduction in hospitalisation and lower mortality.

After autonomic blockade, the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR), myocardial O(2) consumption (MVO(2)), and LV pressure-volume area (PVA) were defined at several different afterloads produced by graded infusions of phenylephrine. Short-term RVP resulted in reduced preload with proportionate reductions in stroke work and the maximum first derivative of LV pressure but with no significant reduction in baseline LV contractile state. In response to increased afterload, the baseline ESPVR shifted to the left with maintained end-systolic elastance (E(es)). In contrast, after short-term RVP, in response to comparable increases in afterload, the ESPVR displayed reduced E(es) (P < 0.05) and significantly less leftward shift compared with control (P < 0.05). Compared with the control MVO(2)-PVA relation, short-term RVP significantly increased the MVO(2) intercept (P < 0.05) with no change in slope. These results indicate that short-term RVP produces attenuation of afterload-induced enhancement of LV performance and increases energy consumption for nonmechanical processes with maintenance of contractile efficiency, suggesting that early in the development of tachycardia heart failure, there is blunting of length-dependent activation and increased O(2) requirements for excitation-contraction coupling, basal metabolism, or both. Rather than being adaptive mechanisms, these abnormalities may be primary defects involved in the progression of the heart failure phenotype.\n\nELABELA-APJ axis protects from pressure overload heart failure and angiotensin II-induced cardiac damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Teruki; Sato, Chitose; Kadowaki, Ayumi; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Ho, Lena; Ishida, Junji; Yamaguchi, Tomokazu; Kimura, Akinori; Fukamizu, Akiyoshi; Penninger, Josef M; Reversade, Bruno; Ito, Hiroshi; Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji\n\n2017-06-01\n\nElabela/Toddler/Apela (ELA) has been identified as a novel endogenous peptide ligand for APJ/Apelin receptor/Aplnr. ELA plays a crucial role in early cardiac development of zebrafish as well as in maintenance of self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells. Apelin was the first identified APJ ligand, and exerts positive inotropic heart effects and regulates the renin-angiotensin system. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological effects of ELA in the cardiovascular system. Continuous infusion of ELA peptide significantly suppressed pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and impaired contractility in mice. ELA treatment reduced mRNA expression levels of genes associated with heart failure and fibrosis. The cardioprotective effects of ELA were diminished in APJ knockout mice, indicating that APJ is the key receptor for ELA in the adult heart. Mechanistically, ELA downregulated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression in the stressed hearts, whereas it showed little effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, which are distinct from the effects of Apelin. FoxM1 transcription factor, which induces ACE expression in the stressed hearts, was downregulated by ELA but not by Apelin. ELA antagonized angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. The ELA-APJ axis protects from pressure overload-induced heart failure possibly via suppression of ACE expression and pathogenic angiotensin II signalling. The different effects of ELA and Apelin on the expression of ACE and ACE2 implicate fine-tuned mechanisms for a ligand-induced APJ activation and downstream signalling.

The aim of this study is to determine if plasma miRNAs can be used as indicators of disease progression or therapeutic efficacy in hypertension-induced heart disease. In order to define circulating miRNAs that change during hypertension-induced heart failure and that respond to therapeutic treatment, we performed miRNA arrays on plasma RNA from hypertensive rats that show signs of heart failure. Array analysis indicated that approximately one-third of the miRNAs on the array are detectable in plasma. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for a selected panel of miRNAs indicated that circulating levels of miR-16, miR-20b, miR-93, miR-106b, miR-223, and miR-423-5p were significantly increased in response to hypertension-induced heart failure, while this effect was blunted in response to treatment with antimiR-208a as well as an ACE inhibitor. Moreover, treatment with antimiR-208a resulted in a dramatic increase in one miRNA, miR-19b. A time course study indicated that several of these miRNA changes track with disease progression. Circulating levels of miRNAs are responsive to therapeutic interventions and change during the progression of hypertension-induced heart disease.\n\nHeart Failure\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... cause heart failure, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.
