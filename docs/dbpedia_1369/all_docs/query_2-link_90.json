But to dare to write a letter, I have to wait an average of 4 weeks until a bearable hour comes  and afterwards I have to pay for it! Therefore, forgive me if everything remains the same with me as before   staying silent, but with love.\n\nMy existence3 is a terrible burden: I would have thrown it off long ago if I had not done the most instructive tests and experiments in the intellectual-moral field precisely in this state of suffering and almost absolute renunciation  this joy in thirst for knowledge brings me to heights where I conquer all torment and all hopelessness. On the whole, I am happier than ever before in my life: and yet! constant pain, for several hours a day a feeling of semi-paralysis closely related to seasickness, which makes it difficult for me to speak, alternating with furious attacks (the last one made me vomit for three days and nights: I thirsted after death). Cannot read! Write very rarely! No socializing with people! Cannot listen to music! Am alone and go for walks; mountain air; milk and egg diet. All internal methods for alleviation have proven useless; I no longer have need of anything. The cold is very bad for me.\n\nI want to head south in the next few weeks in order to begin a life of walking.4\n\nMy thoughts and perspectives are my consolation. I scribble a bit here and there on a sheet of paper as I walk; I don't write anything at a desk; friends decipher my scribblings.5 The last thing6 my friends finished will follow by the way, take it kindly, even if it is less welcomed by your own way of thinking. (I myself am not seeking \"followers\"  do you believe me?  I enjoy my freedom and wish this joy to all those entitled to intellectual freedom)\n\nYour dear wife stands before me as a noble and strong soul who wishes me well.7 I am and will remain yours\n\nFaithfully F. Nietzsche\n\nI've already had lengthy periods of unconsciousness several times. Last spring they gave up on me in Basel\n\nSince the last [eye] examination, my vision has again deteriorated significantly.\n\n1. Otto Eiser (1834-1898): Frankfurt doctor, and admirer of Nietzsche and Richard Wagner. He examined Nietzsche in October 1877, and disclosed to him a letter from Richard Wagner opining on the cause of Nietzsche's poor health  namely, masturbation. According to a friend of Eiser, Eiser admitted that this was the real cause of Nietzsche's break with Wagner. See Sander L. Gilman, \"Otto Eiser and Nietzsche's Illness: A Hitherto Unpublished Text.\" In: Nietzsche Studien (2009) 38:396-409. Dr. Eugen Kretzer. \"Erinnerungen an Dr. Otto Eiser.\" (Memories of Dr. Otto Eiser.) Ca. 1912. Excerpt: \"Auf meine Veranlassung hat die Witwe Dr. Eisers einem der Briefe Richard Wagners an ihren verstorbenen Gatten besondere Fürsorge zugewendet. Den Inhalt dieses Briefes kennt, wie sie mir sagte, außer mir nur Hr Geheimrat Dr. Henry Thode, sonst niemand. Sie hat ihn dem Hause Wahnfried übersandt, und dort ist und bleibt er fortan deponiert. Ich billige das durchaus. Er sollte der Öffentlichkeit stets vorenthalten werden. Richard Wagner schrieb diesen Brief, als er erfuhr, daß Dr. Eiser seinen jungen Freund kennen gelernt hatte und ärztlich beriet. In treu besorgter, wahrhaft väterlicher Weise teilt er darin dem gemeinsamen ärztlichen Freund seine Hypothese über die Ursache von Nietzsches Erkrankung mit. 'Warum Nietzsche von Wagners abfiel?,' meinte Eiser einst:  'ich weiß es allein, denn in meinem Hause, in meiner Stube hat sich dieser Abfall vollzogen, als ich Nietzsche jenen Brief in wohlmeinendster Absicht mitteilte. Ein Ausbruch von Raserei war die Folge, Nietzsche war außer sich:  die Worte sind nicht wiederzugeben, die er für Wagner fand.  Seitdem war der Bruch besiegelt.'\" (At my instigation, Dr. [Otto] Eiser's widow took special care of one of Richard Wagner's letters to her deceased husband. As she told me, \"The contents of this letter are known only to me, privy councilor Dr. Henry Thode, no one else.\" She sent it to the Wahnfried house [Wagner's villa in Bayreuth], and it is and will be deposited there from now on. I absolutely approve of that. It should always be withheld from the public. Richard Wagner wrote this letter when he learned that Dr. Eiser had met his young friend [Nietzsche] and gave him medical advice. In a faithful, truly fatherly way, he shares his hypothesis about the cause [i.e., masturbation] of Nietzsche's illness with his mutual medical friend. \"Why did Nietzsche break away from Wagner?\" Eiser once said:  \"I alone know, because this break took place in my house, in my [examining] room, when I informed Nietzsche about that letter with the best of intentions. The result was an outbreak of rage, Nietzsche was beside himself:  the words that he found for Wagner cannot be repeated.  At that moment the break was sealed.\")\n\n2. Nietzsche thanks Eisner for a 12-31-1879 letter wishing Nietzsche a happy New Year.\n\n3. See Nietzsche's 05-02-1879 letter of resignation to Carl Burckhardt. German; English.\n\n4. Nietzsche's travels took him to Italy: Bolzano, Riva Del Garda, and Venice. Paul Rée, unbeknownst to Nietzsche, sent money to Heinrich Köselitz in order to go to Riva to assist Nietzsche.\n\n5. The friend was Heinrich Köselitz, who was one of the few people who could decipher Nietzsche's handwriting.\n\n6. Der Wanderer und sein Schatten (The Wanderer and His Shadow), published on December 18, 1879.\n\n7. In Eisner's 12-31-1879 letter, he passed along the greetings of his wife.\n\nMalwida von Meysenbug.\n\nFrom b/w photo, 1880.\n\nColorized and enhanced image ©The Nietzsche Channel.\n\nNaumburg, January 14, 1880:\n\nLetter to Malwida von Meysenbug.\n\nAlthough writing is one of the most forbidden fruits for me,1 you, whom I love and esteem like an older sister, must nevertheless have a letter from me  but it will probably be the last! For the terrible and almost unremitting martyrdom of my life makes me thirst after the end,2 and, according to a few symptoms, the stroke to provide relief is close enough to grant me hope. As far as torture and renunciation are concerned, the recent years of my life can measure up to that of any ascetic of any era; nevertheless, in these years I have gained a lot for purifying and polishing the soul  and I no longer need either religion or art for this purpose. (You will notice that I am proud of this; in fact, complete abandonment [of everything] first allowed me to discover my own resources[.]) I believe that I have done my life's work, admittedly like someone who was not given time. But I know that I have poured out a drop of good oil for many and that I have given many a hint for self-elevation, peaceableness and a right mind. I will write this to you afterwards, it should actually be pronounced at the completion of my \"humanity.\"3 No pain has or should be able to seduce me into false testimony about life, [life] as I know it.\n\nTo whom might I say all this if not to you? I think  but is it immodest to say so?  that our characters have many similarities. E.g.: we are both courageous, and neither distress nor contempt can force us off the road that we recognize as the right one. Also, we have both experienced some things inside of us and outside of us, the radiance of which few people of the present age have seen  we have hopes for humanity and offer ourselves as modest sacrifices, don't we?  \n\nHave you heard news of the Wagners? I have heard nothing from them for three years: they too have abandoned me,4 and I knew long ago that from the moment W[agner] noticed the rift between our efforts, he too would no longer stand by me. I was told that he was writing against me.5 May he continue doing so: the truth must come to light in every way! I think of him with constant gratitude, because I am indebted to him for some of the most powerful stimuli for intellectual independence. Frau W[agner], as you know, is the most congenial woman I have met.  But I am completely unsuitable for associating with them, let alone resuming relations. It is too late.\n\nTo you, my dear sisterly esteemed friend, greetings from a young old man who bears no grudge against life, though he must soon want it to end.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche.\n\n1. A result of Nietzsche's poor eyesight.\n\n2. Nietzsche, like any hypochondriac, was in the habit of hyperbolizing his symptoms to the dismay of Meysenbug. E.g., see her 06-03-1877 letter to Augusta von Stein-Rebecchini: \"Teure Freundin, ehe ich Sorrent verlasse, muß ich Ihnen einen Scheidegruß senden. Ich hätte eher geschrieben, allein Sie kennen die alte betrübte Ursache. Seit vier Wochen bin ich hier ganz allein, denn Nietzsche hatte wieder einen so starken Rückfall und meinte nun, das Klima nicht mehr vertragen zu können, daß er plötzlich aufbrach und nach Ragaz ging, wo er nun die Kur gebraucht.\" (Dear friend, before I leave Sorrento, I must send you a last farewell. I would have written sooner, only you know the old sad cause. I've been here all alone for four weeks, because Nietzsche had such a severe relapse again and now thought he could no longer stand the climate that he suddenly set off and went to Ragaz, where he is now taking a treatment.)\n\n3. A reference to Der Wanderer und sein Schatten (The Wanderer and His Shadow), published on December 18, 1879.\n\n4. Coincidentally, Richard Wagner had asked about Nietzsche in a 10-19-1879 letter to Franz Overbeck: \"Daß ich aber so gänzlich davon ausgeschlossen sein soll, an Nietzsches Leben und Nöten teilzunehmen, betrübt mich. Würde ich unbescheiden sein, wenn ich Sie herzlich ersuchte, mir einige Nachricht über unseren Freund zukommen zu lassen?\" (But I am saddened that I should be so completely excluded from participating in Nietzsche's life and needs. Would I be immodest if I kindly asked you to send me some news about our friend?).\n\n5. At the same time that he was asking about Nietzsche, Wagner was indirectly attacking him in the Bayreuther Blätter (Okt. 1879, 310).\n\nTitle Page:\n\nDas Recht zu leben und die Pflicht zu sterben.

See pp. 312-313; 316. \"Die Provençalen hatten die ersten dichterischen Anregungen und Formen aus den arabischen Reichen Spaniens erhalten, und mit ihrer eigenen Heldenlust und Liebeswonne vermählt. Die von den französischen Rittern Besiegten lebten als Sieger in der poetischen Kultur der 'Gaya Scienza' in der Provence fort. Die Poesie wurde hier zum geistigen Turnier und das ganze Volk nahm an ihr theil. Die Urheber dieser erfinderischen Dichtkunst (art de trobar) erhielten den Namen Troubadours (Erfinder), pflegten wie ihre orientalischen Vorgänger hauptsächlich die Lyrik, das Liebeslied, das Lehrgedicht und die Satire, und sangen in ihren Canzoni bald Morgenlieder (Albas), Abendlieder (Serenas) Strophen der Freude (Soulas) und des Leids (Lais), Sonette (mit Instrumenten begleitet), Balladen (mit Tanz), bald Streitgedichte (Tenzoni) und Lob- und Rügelieder (Sirventes). Die Sirventes erhielten für die Provence die höhere Bedeutung, dem socialen und politischen Leben einen freimüthigen, feurigen Aufschwung geben, und die Gebrechen der Kirche zu bekämpfen [ ] So haben die zahlreichen Troubadours der Provence die Gaya Scienza zu einem leidenschaftlichen, freiheitsglühenden, prophetischen und dann wieder schwermüthigen, liebedurstigen Gesang erhoben, ein Abbild des ganzen Landes.\" (The Provençals had received the first poetic ideas and forms from the Moorish empires of Spain, and wed them with their own heroic desires and joys of love. Those defeated by the French knights lived on as victors in the poetic culture of the \"Gaya Scienza\" in Provence. Here poetry became a spiritual tournament and the whole people took part in it. The creators of this inventive poetry (art of trobar) were given the name troubadours (innovators), and like their oriental predecessors, they mainly used lyricism, love songs, didactic poems and satire, and in their canzoni they first sang morning songs (Albas), evening songs (Serenas), stanzas of joy (Soulas) and of suffering (Lais), sonnets (accompanied by instruments), ballads (with dance), then poems of dispute (Tenzoni) and songs of praise and rebuke (Sirventes). The Sirventes were given the greater importance for Provence, to give the social and political life an outspoken, fiery impetus, and to combat the deficiency of the Church [...] Thus the numerous troubadours of Provence exalted the Gaya Scienza to a passionate, freedom-ardent, prophetic and then again plaintive, love-thirsty singing, a reflection of the entire country.)

In his 04-11-1880 letter to Franz Overbeck, (see footnotes 6 and 7), Nietzsche asked for an issue of recent publishing notices. Moreover, in his 04-21-1880 postcard to his mother and sister, Nietzsche asked Elisabeth to keep an eye out for interesting books. \"Wenn Du, meine liebe Schwester, beim Lesen der Revue des deux mondes ein Buch sehr empfohlen findest (historisch oder philosophisch), so schreib es mir, ich werde sehr dankbar sein. (If you, my dear sister, while reading the Revue des Deux Mondes find a highly recommended book (historical or philosophical), then write to me about it, I will be very grateful.)\n\n4. In 1878, there were 20 bookstores in Zürich. It's not certain to which one Nietzsche was referring, although it may have been Volksbuchhandlung, Zeltweg 35 in Hottingen. See Adressbuch der Stadt Zürich und der Ausgemeinden für 1878. Zürich: Orell Füssli, 1878, 254. In his 05-09-1880 letter to Heinrich Köselitz, Overbeck writes: \"Grüssen Sie N. aufs herzlichste. Die von ihm gewünschte Adresse der Züricher Buchhandlung kann ich ihm noch nicht geben.\" (Give N[ietzsche] my warmest regards. I can't yet give him the address he wants for the Zurich bookstore.)\n\nIda Overbeck.\n\nFrom b/w photo, ca. 1875.\n\nColorized and enhanced image ©The Nietzsche Channel.\n\nVenice, May 24, 1880:\n\nLetter to Ida Overbeck.\n\nDear revered Frau Professor, Thank you very much  but I did have a bit of remorse: it seemed to me that I should have prevented in every way such an act of kindness by you,1 and I did nothing!\n\nThe essay2 is not adequate \"for the subject\" just like others by the same author, but I am grateful to anyone who even touches on the subject. To know how higher cultural ages than ours have come to terms with the bitterest pain  that is very important, and one would have to expend a great deal more strength and knowledge on this than Ms[sr]. A[lbert] had at his disposal then. Nor should one combine such concerns too much with Christian concerns, otherwise one gets false colors.\n\nThe objections3 to Seneca's way of consoling  as if he had just wanted to evoke it? He did not like to say the word that mattered to him; he said that such grief was no longer decent for a woman of this rank (in every sense)  what did he then advise? What had he meditated on all his life, what is the ever present thought in his writings, even if there is not a word of it  suicide. Only with this word do the objections disappear; and that noble soul should discover it for itself!4 Instead, Ms[sr]. A[lbert] wanted to pluck the laurel for Christianity.  Perhaps I am doing an injustice to both of them with this hypothesis. \n\nSay thanks especially to my friend for everything he recently gave me through Hr. Köselitz5; it is so refreshing to know one another from a distance and yet in such proximity to one another. E.g. we both don't need a word anymore  for understanding about Jews and Jewish proselytes.6 I confess that all news from Germany is annoying and alien to me, and my health almost forces me to solder myself like a can for the sake of preservation.\n\nFarewell!\n\nDeeply grateful\n\nand devoted\n\nF Nietzsche\n\nFrom Venice, the city of rain, wind and dark alleys.\n\nDon't believe George Sand about Venice7 (the best part of it is tranquillity and beautiful pavement)\n\n1. She translated an essay by Paul Albert (1827-1880), \"Les consolateurs.\" In: Variétés morales et littéraires. Paris: Hachette, 1879, 1-63. See the entry for Albert in Nietzsche's Library.\n\n2. Ibid.\n\n3. Ibid., p. 41.\n\n4. Nietzsche is referring to Seneca's death after Nero condemned him to death by suicide. Seneca's wife, Pompeia Paulina, decided to commit suicide as well, to which Seneca replied that he did not begrudge her setting such a fine example, and that they both would die with equal fortitude, although her death would be nobler. Besides accounts about Seneca and his wife from Tacitus, Nietzsche was familiar with the one by Montaigne (1533-1592). See Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Essais. Avec des notes de tous les commenteurs. Paris: Didot, 1864, 386. See the entry for Montaigne in Nietzsche's Library.\n\n5. See 05-09-1880 letter from her husband Franz Overbeck to Heinrich Köselitz. We can only surmise that Köselitz read to Nietzsche Overbeck's letter, part of which refers to Schmeitzner's anti-Semitic publications: \"Wenigstens von den antisemitischen Blättern habe ich mit sehr geringer Freude gehört, es auch Hrn Schmeitzner geschrieben und keinen mich für die Sache mehr einnehmenden Bescheid darauf erhalten. Worüber man sich bei Juden zu beschweren hat und was an ihnen in der Regel widrig ist darüber wird man unter Nichtjuden und auch unter Deutschen leicht einverstanden sein, doch scheint mir in dem ganzen jetzigen öffentlichen Treiben in Deutschland des Blinden, Gedankenlosen Unbesonnenen und Beschränkten genug zu sein, dass es durch eine auf den blindesten Trieben beruhende Agitation noch vermehrt werden dürfte.\" (I heard about a few of the anti-Semitic papers with very little pleasure, I also wrote about it to Mr. Schmeitzner and did not receive any information on the matter that was more appealing to me. What one has to complain about with Jews and what is generally uncomfortable about them will be easily agreed upon among non-Jews and also among Germans, but it seems to me that there is enough of what is blind, thoughtless, reckless and imbecilic in all the current public activity in Germany that might be increased by agitation based on the blindest instincts.) In a series called Antisemitische Hefte (Anti-Semitic Pamphlets), Schmeitzner began reprinting the reprehensible writings of the anti-Semitic agitator, Wilhelm Marr (1819-1904). The series only lasted for one year with three issues: Wilhelm Marr, Der Judenkrieg, seine Fehler und wie er zu organisieren ist. \"Der Verkauf findet zum besten des antisemitischen Agitationsfonds statt.\" Chemnitz: Ernst Schmeitzner, 1880. Aus: Der Sieg des Judentums über das Germanenthum. - [1879] Series: Antisemitische Hefte Nr. 1; Wilhelm Marr, Goldene Ratten und rothe Mäuse. \"Der Verkauf findet zum besten des antisemitischen Agitationsfonds statt.\" Chemnitz: Ernst Schmeitzner, 1880.

Series: Antisemitische Hefte Nr. 3.\n\n6. See 05-12-1880 letter from Heinrich Köselitz to Franz Overbeck. \"Was uns ganz neu war, das ist die Nachricht vom Erscheinen-wollen \"Antisemitischer Blätter\" im Schmeitznerschen Verlage. Wie gesagt, ich erfuhr das erste Wort von Ihnen über diese Sache, und begreife jetzt recht gut, dass seit jenem Briefe, in welchem mir Schmeitzner mittheilte, er betheilige sich stark an der antisemitischen Agitation, mit welcher Mittheilung er wahrscheinlich eine eingehendere Verständigung einleiten wollte, er mir Nichts mehr über diese Angelegenheit gesagt hat; ich hatte ihm nämlich darauf unumwunden geantwortet 'ob er sich denn nicht vor mir schäme'?  Nietzsche gab Ihren Gedanken vollständigen Beifall; im Übrigen aber, meinte er, lasse er sich mit dem Thema über die Juden jetzt nicht ein; er habe es zu seiner geistigen Gesundheit nöthig, sich hier, wie in einigen andern Dingen (z. B. den bayreuthischen, den christlichen) eine strenge Diät aufzuerlegen, seinen Kopf diesen Dingen fremd werden zu lassen, damit er eine gewisse Distanz für sie gewinne.\" (What was completely new to us [Köselitz and Nietzsche] was the news that \"Anti-Semitic Papers' would appear in Schmeitzner's publishing house. As I said, I heard the first word about this matter from you, and I now understand quite well that since that letter in which Schmeitzner informed me that he was heavily involved in anti-Semitic agitation, with which communication he probably wanted to initiate a more thorough understanding, he said nothing more to me about this matter; I had of course replied frankly to him, \"Whether he wasn't ashamed of himself\"?  Nietzsche completely approved of your sentiments; but apart from that, he said he was not getting involved with the subject of the Jews; he had to impose a strict diet on himself here for his mental health, as well as some other things (e.g. the Bayreuthian, the Christian), to let his mind become alien to these things, so that he could keep a certain distance from them.) In later correspondence between Schmeitzner and Köselitz, Schmeitzner objected to Köselitz calling the anti-Semitic movement \"imbecilic race hatred\"  parroting Franz Overbeck's description, i.e., \"blind, thoughtless, reckless and imbecilic\" (see footnote 4). Excerpt from Chemnitz, 10-22-1881, letter from Ernst Schmeitzner to Heinrich Köselitz in Venice: \"Ei, ei, Sie böser Herr, wie können Sie nur gleich von 'imbeciler Rassenanfeindung' reden! Was für Ungeheuer von deutschen Zeitungen müssen Sie denn da lesen, daß Ihnen so etwas aus Deutschland erzählt wird. Ist kein Wort davon wahr; man spricht bei uns nur davon ob wir uns vor dem totalen materiellen und moralischen Ruin schützen dürfen!\" (Well, well, you wicked sir, how can you speak of \"imbecilic racial hostility\"! What monsters of German newspapers have you been reading that told you something like that from Germany. Not a word of it is true; we only talk amongst ourselves about whether we can protect ourselves from total financial and moral ruin!)\n\n7. George Sand (1804-1876), Histoire de ma vie. Tome neuvième.

But the god of cannibals and ascetics is happy when precisely people, people such as you, suffer, it is pure cruelty.  And at the same time you still think of me and give me another drink of the best milk!  That is and remains for me W.

Rée's foster sister, Mary Sellin Harper (1852-1880), died at the age of 27 while giving birth to her third child.\n\n2. A number of works by Walter Scott in German translation were published in or around 1880, but it's uncertain which one was gifted to Nietzsche by Rée. The reference to milk is reminiscent of Nietzsche's 01-18-1876 letter to Carl von Gersdorff: \"Ich lebe fast ganz von Milch, die mir gut thut, auch schlafe ich ordentlich, Milch und Schlaf sind die besten Dinge, die ich jetzt habe. [....] Meine Schwester liest mir viel vor, weil mir Lesen und Schreiben schwer fällt. Walter Scott hätte ich neben Milch und Schlaf nennen sollen.\" (I live almost entirely on milk, which does me good, I also sleep well; milk and sleep are the best things which I now have.

It's better here. I live in the forest: it's called \"Hermitage.\" I dream that maybe we'll see each other again this summer?  If you can do without the books I recently wrote about,2 please send them; I've thought about \"Christian morality\" so often by now that I'm ravenously hungry for some material for my hypotheses.3\n\nThe good wishes of a water drinker4 and forest ranger to you and your dearest dear companion.\n\n1.

Nietzsche stayed in Marienbad for two months. He began writing Morgenröthe (Dawn) in the autumn of 1880. After arriving in Genoa around 11-10-1880 (where he stayed until the end of April 1881), he continued working on the manuscript until sending it to Heinrich Köselitz on 01-25-1881. The book was finally published in July 1881.\n\n4. Drinking water  as opposed to alcohol or coffee  was still a homeopathic cure at the time.\n\nHeinrich Köselitz.\n\nFrom b/w photo, Venice, 1878.\n\nColorized and enhanced image ©The Nietzsche Channel.\n\nMarienbad, July 18, 1880:\n\nLetter to Heinrich Köselitz.\n\nMy dear friend, I still think several times a day about the pleasant pampering in Venice1 and of the even more pleasant pamperer, and I say only that one should not be allowed to have it so good for long and that it is quite right to be a hermit again and, as such, to go walking for ten hours a day, to drink fatal waters and await their effects. Meanwhile I am digging zealously in my moral mines2 and sometimes feel quite subterranean in the process  it now seems to me as if I have found the main tunnel and way out, but something like this can be believed and rejected a hundred times. Every now and then I hear an echo of Chopin's music, and you have now achieved such a thing,3 so that I always think of you and lose myself in thinking about possibilities. My confidence has become very strong; you are much more solidly built than I assumed, and apart from the detrimental influence that Herr Nietzsche has occasionally had on you, you are in every respect well conditioned. Ceterum censeo4 mountains and forests are better than cities, and Paris better than Vienna.5 But that does not matter.\n\nOn the way [here] I came into contact with an important ecclesiastic, who seemed to be among the first promoters of old Catholic music; he was a match for any detailed questions. I found him very much taken with Wagner's work on Palestrina;6 he said that the dramatic recitative (in the liturgy) was the seed of church music, and insisted afterward that the recital be as dramatic as possible. Regensburg[, he said,] was now the only city on earth where you could study the old music, but above all, could hear it (especially during Passiontide).\n\nHave you heard about the fire at Mommsen's house? And that his notes were destroyed, the most voluminous preparatory work ever made by a living scholar? He supposedly rushed into the flames repeatedly, covered with burns, and eventually they had to restrain him by force. Such undertakings as M[ommsen]'s must be very rare, because a colossal memory, and a corresponding acumen in the criticism and organization of such material seldom come together, but rather work against one another.  When I heard the story, it was heartwringing, and even now I suffer physically when I think about it. Is that pity? But what is M[ommsen] to me? I am not at all favorably inclined towards him. 7\n\nHere alone in the forest in The Eremitage,8 whose Eremit I am, there has been great distress since yesterday: I don't really know what happened, but the shadow of a crime lies on the house. Somebody buried something, others discovered it, one could hear terrible wailing, many gendarmes were there, a search of the house took place, and at night I heard someone moaning in anguish in the room next to me, so that sleep fled from me. Also in the dead of night there seemed to be digging again in the forest, but a surprise happened and there were tears and shouting again. An officer told me it was a \"banknote affair\"  I'm not curious enough to know as much about it as everyone around me probably knows. Suffice it to say, the forest solitude is eerie.\n\nI have been reading a novella by Mérimée, in which H[enri] Beyle's character is said to be portrayed: \"The Etruscan Vase\"; if this is true, it would be the character called St. Clair. The whole thing is derisive, pretentious9 and deeply melancholic.10\n\nLastly, a reflection: one ceases to love oneself properly when one ceases to exercise oneself in loving others: wherefore the latter (the ceasing) is very much advised against.11 (From my own experience.) Farewell my beloved and very much valued friend, may things go well with you by day and by night.\n\nFaithfully your F.N.\n\nIn your conduct toward the deserter,12 Schopenhauer would see a proof of the immutability of character13  and be wrong about it, as he almost always is.\n\n1.

Now we have trouble in the house,2 the owner has suddenly been taken to prison, gendarmes came and dug up a printing press for counterfeit banknotes, searched the house, and there was considerable lamentation afterwards. The poor woman was beside herself with profound desperation for 3 days. As I said: I want to go to Ruhla next month, hopefully the forests there are as good as here.3 But to stay here in the long run  that won't work for me. I can't eat well here on a single guilder.

How long have I been deprived of what is so noticeably good for me, pure air and sun! I will probably stay here until the end of the month, I am too suspicious of changing locations and so seldom find anything suitable for me. Here I still have the forest and the good paths in it, which I often walk amidst the rain. At the beginning of September I will be coming to you two and reckon that I will find a quiet, pleasant autumn life there.

I was delighted by it, and at the same time seized by a feeling of profound, ineffable privation. I believe I wept, and it would be strange if this excellent little book did not arouse such a sensation in many others. \n\nWhy haven't I written? Because for 3 weeks I have been flapping my wings to get away from Marienbad  and because three weeks of constant rainy weather clung to me, was detrimental to my health and myself due to constant change from expectation to disappointment, depriving me of almost all capability to make decisions. Now I will patiently hold out until the end of the month, and again try to achieve a moderate level of wellbeing that I owe to the forest, the sun, the clear sky and the fatal little sips of water in the first few weeks of my stay here. Had it stayed that way, I would have spent my August near Dresden2  that was my plan and I did not write in order to write anything specific about the time of arrival.\n\nBut nevertheless! There remains the beautiful hope for the Naumburg reunion!3 right?  And this [plan] shall not fall through! \n\nToday they celebrated the Kaiser's birthday4 here, but in the midst of the black and yellow colors I can always think something terrible, about the birthday of the plague.5  I glanced again in Sainte Beuve. He has perceived very fine things: p. 19 he speaks of the informality of (Font[enelle]'s) expression which  looks like a secret ruse against the grandeur of things[.]\"6 This is perceived in the style of Pascal.\n\nBest wishes to my dear friends and the entire esteemed circle\n\nYour grateful\n\nvery grateful\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche.\n\n1.

In his 11-18-1879 postcard to Ernst Schmeitzner, Nietzsche wrote: \"Geehrtester Herr, die Sainte-Beuve-Übersetzung ist fertig: wollen Sie sich an Hr. Prof. Overbeck ihretwegen wenden?

Troisieme Tome, 314-335 (328): \"Ce grand esprit, atteint en ceci d'un reste de superstition, recule devant la vérité de Copernic et laisse indécise la balance. Si inférieur à Pascal comme imagination et comme âme, et dans un rapport qu'on dirait incommensurable avec lui (nous sommes en style de géomètre), Fontenelle, à titre d'esprit libre et dégagé, d'esprit net, impartial et étendu, reprend lentement ses avantages, et, sur la fin de ce siècle de grandeur, mais certes aussi d'illusion et de timidité majestueuse, il ose voir en réalité et exprimer en douceur les vérités naturelles telles qu'elles sont. Là est son originalité, là est sa gloire. / On commence à sentir en quoi, malgré ses légèretés et ses minauderies d'agrément, malgré cette familiarité affectée d'expressions qui semble par moments une chicane concertée contre la majesté des choses, Fontenelle se différencie profondément des écrivains frivoles qui traitent des sujets graves et qui ne prennent point la vérité en elle-même.\" (This great mind, affected in this by a remnant of superstition, recoils before the truth of Copernicus and leaves the balance undecided. So inferior to Pascal in imagination and in soul, and in a relationship that one would call immeasurable to him (we are in the style of a surveyor), Fontenelle, as a free and clear mind, a clear, impartial and comprehensive mind, slowly resumes his advantages, and, at the end of this century of greatness, but certainly also of illusion and majestic timidity, he dares to perceive reality and to express gently natural truths as they are. There is his originality, there is his glory. / One begins to feel how, in spite of his lightness and his simpering airs, despite this familiarity affected by expressions which at times seems a concerted ruse against the majesty of things, Fontenelle differs deeply from frivolous writers who deal with serious subjects and who do not take the truth in itself.)\n\nRichard Wagner.\n\nMunich, 1880.\n\nFrom b/w photo by Joseph Albert.\n\nColorized and enhanced image ©The Nietzsche Channel.\n\nMarienbad, August 20, 1880:\n\nLetter to Heinrich Köselitz.\n\nFriend Köselitz, in my harvest, indeed harvest-festival mood, your letter chimed in, though a bit somberly, but so well and powerfully that today I again, as always, conclude and rest my reflections about you with the chorale\n\nYou are made of sterner stuff than I am, and are free to cultivate for yourself higher ideals. For my part, I suffer terribly when I am deprived of sympathy; and, for example, nothing can compensate me for the fact that in recent years I have been deprived of Wagner's sympathy. How often I dream of him, and always in the style of our former intimate togetherness. There was never an angry word spoken between us, not even in my dreams, yet very many encouraging and cheerful ones, and with no one perhaps have I laughed so much. That's over now  and what good is it to be in the right, in many respects, against him! As if that could wipe this forlorn sympathy from my memory!  And I have experienced similar things before, and will probably experience them again. They are the hardest sacrifices that my path through life and thought have demanded of me  even now my whole philosophy falters after an hour of sympathetic conversation with total strangers; it seems to me so foolish to want to be right at the cost of love, and not be able to communicate what is most worthwhile about it, for the sake of preserving sympathy. Hinc meae lacrimae.2 \n\nI'm still in Marienbad: the \"Austrian weather\" has kept me here! Bear in mind that it has rained every day since July 24, and often all day long. Cloudy and rainy skies, but nice walks in the woods. My health took a turn for the worse here; in summa, however, I have been content with Venice and Marienbad. There has not been so much contemplation here since Goethe,3 and even Goethe did not let so [many] essential things pass through his head  I really outdid myself.4 One time, in the woods, a gentleman who was passing by stared very hard at me: I felt at that moment that the expression on my face must have been one beaming with joy, and that I had been walking around with it for 2 hours. I am living incognito as the most inconspicuous of all spa guests; in the registry for foreigners I am listed as \"Mr. Nietzsche, teacher.\" There are many Poles here and they  it's strange  keep taking me for a Pole, greeting me in Polish and  do not believe me when I make it known that I'm a Swiss. \"He is of the Polish race, but his heart has wandered God knows where\"  so one of them said to me in parting, quite sad.\n\nI am in Naumburg in early September. The Overbecks are also coming. Also Frau von Wöhrmann (she is dissolving her household in N[aumburg] and is moving to Venice). The son of Frau W[öhrmann] and likewise his friend Count Werthern, who attended the Naumburg Gymnasium, are going to be at our house.5 Do you have the \"Menschen des 18. Jahrhunderts\" by St. Beuve?6 It contains superb portraits of people and St. B[euve] is a great artist. But I can still see above every figure a curved line that he does not see, and this advantage gives me my philosophy. My philosophy? Let the devil take it! And you may summon the dear Lord  he takes delight in all things Köselitz.\n\nFaithfully yours\n\nFN.\n\n1.

I think of you with true longing, without having any prospect of satisfying it; for I had to retreat to the south again2 and this time, as I have promised myself, for longer. As a prescription as well as a natural passion, solitude seems to me more and more clearly the perfect one  and the state in which we can accomplish our best has to be established and many sacrifices have to be made for it. For such a solitary person, however, \"the friend\" is a more priceless thought than the crowd here.3  My respects to your parents.\n\n1.

In that it is, as I now see from the calendar, your birthday  you will look back upon your life today with particular melancholy! We are growing older and thus lonelier: precisely that love abandons us, which loved us like an unconscious necessity, not because of our particular qualities, but often in spite of them. Our past draws to a close when our mother dies: then for the first time our childhood and youth become nothing more than a memory. And then on it goes, the friends of our youth die, our teachers, the ideals of those days  ever more solitude, ever more cold the winds blowing about us. You were right to plant another garden of love around you, dear friend!2 I think that you will be particularly grateful for your lot today. Furthermore, you have remained true to your art; I listened to everything that you reported to me about it with sincere satisfaction, and perhaps in the course of time my body will reach a more favorable age than the present one, when we shall once again sit together and see the past resurrected out of your [musical] notes, indeed just as with the music of our youth, when we had both dreamed together of our future.3\n\nI dare not say more, my afflictions (which still, as in the past, have their own daily history) have laid their dictatorial hand upon me. When you think of me (as you did on my birthday, which, this time, I had even forgotten), you must believe that I do not lack the courage and the patience, even the way things now stand and are going, to aspire to high, very high goals. \n\nYou must also firmly believe that I am and remain your friend\n\nDevotedly, with heartfelt love\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche.\n\n(Genoa)\n\n1.

Since our last exchange of cards and letters, I have been besieged by every malady and insalubrious thing, so that I hardly remember a worse time;2 I have suffered like a bear in a tight spot,3 and timidity and bitterness were also nestled in my heart  extremely hibernal, as in nature.

It always does me good to think of you at your work, it's as if a healthy force of nature worked, as it were, blindly through you, and yet it is a [kind of] reason that works in the subtlest and most intertwined material and by which we have to abide when it behaves impatiently and doubtfully, and sometimes to our despair. I owe you so much, dear friend, for the fact that I was able to watch the spectacle of your life so closely: in fact, Basel bestowed upon me your image and that of Jakob Burckhardt; I think that it is not only with regard to knowledge that I have made great use of these images. The dignity and the grace of a distinctive and essentially solitary way of living and knowing: this spectacle was \"presented at my door\"1 by the favor of my destiny, which cannot be revered enough  and consequently, I left that house differently than I entered it.\n\nNow all my writings and endeavors are aimed at realizing an ideal attic solitude in which all those necessary and most elementary demands of my nature, as many, many pains have taught me, come into their own. And perhaps I will succeed! The daily struggle against my headaches and the ridiculous variety of my distresses requires such attention that I run the risk of becoming petty as well  well, it is the counterweight to very general, very ambitious urges that have such control over me that I would have to make a fool of myself without great counterweights. I have just come round from a very vicious attack, and no sooner had I shaken off my distress of the past two days when my folly again pursued quite incredible things, from the moment I wake up, and I do not think that any attic occupants will see the dawn illuminate more lovely and desirable things. Help me to hold onto this hiddenness, deny my existence in Genoa,  for a good period of time I have to live without people and in the middle of a city whose language I do not know, I must  I repeat; have no fears on my account! I live as if the centuries were nothing and pursue my thoughts without thinking of the date or the newspapers.\n\nI also want to have nothing more to do with the aspirations of the current \"idealism,\" especially the German one[.]  Let us all do our work, posterity may then rank us such and such, or it may not do it: I merely want to feel free and not to have to say yes! or no! e.g., to such a typically idealistic booklet2 like the one I am sending you. It's the last thing I want to get to know about the current \"German mind\"  equally touching, presumptuous, and in unspeakably bad taste: just read it once, together with your wife, of course! And then burn it and read Plutarch's life of Brutus and Dion3 to purge yourself of this German bombast.  Farewell, dear friend! Did I congratulate you on your birthday?4 No. But I congratulated myself for it.\n\nWith all my love.\n\nGenova, poste restante.\n\n1. Nietzsche and Overbeck were housemates in Basel.\n\n2.

For in order to get to my garret, I have to climb 164 steps inside the house, and the house itself is very high up, on a steep palace street,2 which is very quiet because of its steepness and because it leads to a big flight of steps with some grass between the stones.  My health is in a hideous disorder, including my stomach.
