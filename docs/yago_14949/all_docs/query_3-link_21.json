        "text": "[Congressional Record Volume 169, Number 176 (Wednesday, October 25, 2023)] [House] [Pages H5053-H5064] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] STANDING WITH ISRAEL AS IT DEFENDS ITSELF AGAINST THE BARBARIC WAR LAUNCHED BY HAMAS AND OTHER TERRORISTS Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 771) standing with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 771 Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea, including firing thousands of rockets; Whereas this heinous assault took place just after the 50th anniversary of the start of the multi-front 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel; Whereas Hamas terrorists crossed the land border and began slaughtering Israelis and abducting hostages in towns in southern Israel, including children and the elderly; Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas launched over 4,500 rockets into southern and central Israel; Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed over 900 Israelis and injured more than 2,600 others; Whereas at least 11 United States citizens in Israel are among those killed by Hamas since October 7, 2023; Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians; Whereas the expansion of this war to other fronts by Hezbollah, Iran, or others would create an even more devastating regional catastrophe; Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization; Whereas Iran has long provided support to Hamas and other terrorist groups and proxies, and prior United States Government unclassified assessments indicated that, ``Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command''; Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment, such as bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including through thorough vetting of assistance; Whereas under the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding, the United States pledged to provide Israel $3.3 billion per year in Foreign Military Financing Program assistance and $500 million per year in missile defense for 10 years, which Congress has appropriated annually; Whereas section 1273 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 authorized not less than $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing Program assistance for Israel for each of the fiscal years 2021 through 2028, in accordance with the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding; Whereas Congress has responded with additional appropriations beyond the terms of the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding as needed, including in March 2022 when Congress appropriated an additional $1 billion for Iron Dome defense system after the May 2021 conflict in which Hamas launched more than 4,400 rockets at Israel; and Whereas Israel is a major non-NATO ally and Major Strategic Partner of the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists; (2) reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense; (3) condemns Hamas' brutal war against Israel; [[Page H5054]] (4) calls on all countries to unequivocally condemn Hamas' brutal war against Israel; (5) calls on Hamas to immediately cease these violent attacks and safely release all living hostages and return the bodies of deceased hostages; (6) mourns the over 900 Israelis and 11 Americans killed and over 2,600 others wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on Israel; (7) reaffirms the United States' commitment to Israel's security, including through security assistance in accordance with the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding; (8) urges full enforcement of the Taylor Force Act (title X of division S of Public Law 115-141; 132 Stat. 1143) and other restrictions in United States law to prevent United States foreign assistance from benefiting terrorists, directly or indirectly; (9) condemns Iran's support for terrorist groups and proxies, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad; (10) urges full enforcement of United States sanctions against Iran to prevent Iran's funding of terrorist groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad; and (11) stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply and other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend debate for each side by 10 minutes, and I also ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, October 7, Israelis awoke to rockets raining down on them from Gaza, and gunmen broke down their doors and invaded their homes. Hamas terrorists killed babies and toddlers. They killed elderly grandmothers and grandfathers. They killed moms and dads. They killed teenage kids in their homes. No one was spared from their brutality. Following World War II, my father's war, I never believed the world would bear witness to the slaughter of the Jewish people as we have seen at the bloody hands of Hamas. October 7 was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Additionally, Hamas is holding 220 hostages, including Americans. This is a flyer with a picture of a mother and son taken hostage by Hamas, #bringthemhomenow. They are using them as human shields and threatening to execute them. They must all be released unconditionally now. This is one of the darkest moments in the history of the State of Israel. I was in one of the kibbutzim right on the border of Gaza last year, meeting with members of the community. I saw their daycare center. That very same kibbutz was overrun by 70 Hamas terrorists. Many of the residents I met were slaughtered. Most viciously, the babies and the children I visited in the daycare center were slaughtered, shot to death, beheaded, and burned alive. When the press says it didn't happen, they are just wrong. It did because I have seen the pictures of the burned babies and the decapitated children and the blood that you see here in the babies' cribs. For God's sake, what is going on in this world today? In one of the most horrific stories to emerge, a pregnant woman had her baby cut out in front of her very eyes as they murdered her baby before her and before they shot her in the head. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, they are monsters. At a music festival to celebrate peace, chaos, gunfire, and explosions ripped through the air, piercing hundreds of bodies with bullets and shrapnel. While the attendees attempted to flee the area, gunmen surrounded them from every direction. In total, 260 attendees assembled in peace to enjoy music were massacred. Among others, atrocities we have heard reported include children with their hands bound, shot in the back of the head execution style; women who were raped and slaughtered, one of whom was dragged through the streets of Gaza; families, including babies and young children, burned alive in their homes in front of their parents; the beheading of Israeli soldiers; and parents gunned down as they shielded their children before the onslaught of gunfire. This is sheer terror. It is evil. It cannot stand in this world. We are witnessing in real time Hamas carrying out their covenant that outlines their goal of eradicating Israel through jihad. In fact, their covenant states: ``Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.'' They specifically discuss jihad, noting: ``The day that enemies usurp part of Muslim land, jihad becomes the individual duty of every Muslim. In face of the Jews' usurpation . . . , it is compulsory that the banner of jihad be raised.'' Mr. Speaker, it was indeed raised on October 7. To be completely clear, despite repeated efforts by Israel to secure peace, the ``Hamas Covenant'' states: Peace ``initiatives, and so- called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement. . . . There is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by jihad.'' This declaration calling on the annihilation of the Jewish state must be confronted with zero equivocation. That is why I worked with my good friend, Ranking Member Meeks, to introduce this bipartisan resolution. It condemns in the strongest possible terms the atrocities of Hamas and reiterates Israel's right to defend herself, along with America's unwavering support for the State of Israel. All roads lead back to Iran. Their fingerprints are all over this attack. They have consistently funded Hamas and other Palestinian groups to the tune of $100 million per year. This resolution condemns Hamas and Iran for its support of terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic jihad while also calling for all sanctions on Iran to be fully enforced. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. It will send a clear message across the world that terrorists and their sponsors will be held to account for their atrocities, their crimes against humanity, their crimes of genocide. On December 7, 1941, in response to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt said it was ``a date which will live in infamy.'' So, too, will October 7, 2023, live in infamy. Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this extraordinarily important resolution written with my friend and colleague, Chairman McCaul. Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, the State of Israel suffered the greatest mass murder perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel by land, sea, and air. Behaving just like ISIS, Hamas terrorists murdered and beheaded soldiers and civilians alike. Babies were shot and burned in their cribs and reduced to smoldering piles of ash--babies. Children were murdered. Teenagers were murdered. Men and women were murdered. Elderly people, including Holocaust survivors, were murdered. Hamas has also taken 200 of those who survived into Gaza as hostages, including unaccompanied children, Holocaust survivors, and many American citizens. Mr. Speaker, Hamas' attack was truly unprecedented. When you consider the size of Israel's population, proportionately it would be like 30,000 people dying in New York on 9/11. Just let that sink in a little. We must all acknowledge that Hamas is a cutthroat terrorist organization that exists solely to destroy Israel. Hamas' terrorism does not help the Palestinians. In this moment, it is critical for Israel to know that the United States of America stands firmly by its side in this battle against Hamas. Mr. Speaker, what I am about to say next is also very important. There are innocent Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank who seek normal and free lives and want nothing to do with Hamas or other terrorist organizations. [[Page H5055]] We cannot lose sight of this. We must keep them--many of whom are also children--and their safety and well-being in mind. In the immediate term, we must find a way to ensure the safety of those innocents who are in Gaza's war zone, and I support the Biden administration's efforts toward that goal. The United Nations estimates that thousands of Palestinians have been killed since the terrorist attacks on October 7. We don't know for certain how many of those killed were civilians, but here is what we do know: We know that Hamas terrorists used Palestinians as human shields. We know that every single one of them would be alive today if Hamas had not launched its terrorist attack. We must be aware and do all that we can to stop this war from expanding beyond its current scope. The administration and our allies are working around the clock to send messages and warnings to Iran and Hezbollah to stay out. President Biden underscored this message during his recent travel to Israel. Do not test America's will. This Congress will have Israel's back as it degrades and eliminates Hamas' terrorist infrastructure. We know that it won't take a day. It will be difficult. {time} 1545 For too long, too many have been willing to contribute to the delegitimization of the State of Israel. It is deeply concerning that even global leaders are already whitewashing one of the worst terrorist attacks in history while Hamas and its allies blanket cyberspace with misinformation about this war. Just yesterday, Turkish President Erdogan said: ``Hamas is not a terrorist organization, it is a group of mujahideen defending their lands.'' This from the mouth of a NATO ally who has his own concerns about terrorists as an existential threat to his country. President Erdogan's rhetoric is dead wrong. It is rank with hypocrisy, and its timing is extraordinarily dangerous. The resolution before us is a bright spot of bipartisanship today during a very difficult time in American politics. Mr. Speaker, 425 Members of this House of Representatives have cosponsored this resolution. There is no question in my mind that it will pass overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans alike. Most importantly, the American people believe in the Jewish state and believe in its survival. In the days, weeks, and months ahead, I know the United States will continue to stand steadfastly with Israel to assure its defense and its long-term security. We will also, as President Biden has outlined, remain committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza have access to safe areas and continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance without diversions by Hamas. We must also stay keenly focused on working to get United States citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely. I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by raising an issue that the United States and Israel must address: What does a successful ground operation in Gaza look like, and how do we achieve the goal of leaving Gaza to a responsible Palestinian Government if Israel's effort to remove Hamas is successful? One thing is for certain--the path to peace will require more Arab States to recognize that Israel has the right to exist and that we hold firm and will make sure that we could thereby have a two-State solution. If you say Israel does not have the right to exist, you are saying that you do not want peace. I urge our Arab friends to join the Abraham Accords and acknowledge Israel's right to exist because that is the pathway to peace in the Middle East. To the people of Israel, I hope you learn of the passage of this resolution today and know that the United States Congress and the American people have your back. We mourn beside you and are working to provide the resources your government needs to defend you. We have deployed powerful military resources to the region to demonstrate just that support. We are working all of our diplomatic channels to assure your success, and we are in this together. We will not waver. We will not quit. We will stand with our ally Israel. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for this extraordinarily important resolution. Mr. Speaker, our great friend and ally Israel, with significant assistance from the United States, continues to respond to the cowardly Hamas invasion that includes Hamas' psychotic terrorist butchering of innocent civilians, rape, hostage-taking, the beheading of babies, and daily indiscriminate missile attacks that are reminiscent of Nazi buzz bombs and V-2 rockets. Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu has said in the past that he would never allow a second Holocaust, nor should we. Anti-Semitism is at the root of Hamas' violence against Israel and every Jewish man, woman, and child. Israel's right to defend itself from this brutal invasion is absolute. Hamas' 1988 charter explicitly demands the absolute destruction of the State of Israel and proclaims: ``Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it. . . . '' Article 7 of the Hamas charter demands the slaughter of all Jews and says: The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him. Article 13 explicitly rejects initiatives for peace and reconciliation and states, ``Initiatives, and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement.'' In its 2017 charter, Hamas reiterated its goal of wiping Israel off the face of the Earth and said: ``There is no alternative to a fully sovereign Palestinian State on the entire national Palestinian soil, with Jerusalem as its capital.'' Like the Nazis before them, Hamas and its chief terrorism sponsor, Iran, are committing genocide against the Jews. The United States--and all people committed to human rights and the rule of law--must stand with Israel. That means our support and prayers and the weapons systems to defeat Hamas. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, more than 1,000 Hamas terrorists invaded our Democratic ally Israel, and in the most gruesome, savage, and unimaginably barbaric manner attacked 22 Israeli towns, going house to house slaughtering families, raping girls, beheading babies, setting fire to homes where children were hiding in safe rooms, burning them alive, and taking more than 200 people of 40 different nationalities hostage, including taking infants and the elderly hostage. They massacred more than 260 young people attending an outdoor peace concert. They perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, slaughtering more than 1,400 people, including 39 Americans. In committing these horrific crimes against humanity, they have brought disaster to the very people they govern--the Palestinian people. They hide their fighters among civilians. They place rocket launchers and weapons in schools, in hospitals, in mosques, and in residential buildings, compounding their acts of evil. I was so proud that President Biden immediately expressed the full support of the United States for the State of Israel. He traveled to Israel in a time of war to embrace the Israeli people, to show with his presence that the Jewish state has not only a right but a duty to defend itself against Hamas, a terrorist group that has in its charter as its foundational purpose to murder Jews and destroy the State of Israel. Make no mistake: When they shout, ``from the river to the sea,'' they are calling for the total destruction of the [[Page H5056]] State of Israel and ridding the Middle East of all Jews. Well, let me say: not on our watch. The United States will stand side by side with our Democratic ally Israel. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in support of this resolution. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the vice chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771. Today, the House has an opportunity to demonstrate moral clarity and moral courage. These past few weeks have exposed a level of anti- Semitism in this Nation that is frightening. Whether it is schoolchildren chanting for the genocide of Israelis by calling for removal ``from the river to the sea'' or radicalized college students projecting anti-Semitic slogans on the side of school property, it is clear young Americans are being indoctrinated against Israel. These actions must be condemned. Hamas is a terror organization that slaughtered innocent women and children. Hamas is a terror organization that manipulated Western media into doing their bidding by spreading lies about attacks Israel did not commit. Hamas is a terror organization that steals foreign aid, using it to construct rockets and attack Israel. These are not my opinions, Mr. Speaker, they are facts. Yet too many refuse to call Hamas out for what it is: evil incarnate, focused solely on the destruction of the Jewish people. Mr. Speaker, the United States Government must be united in support of Israel and against Hamas and anti-Semitism. There should be no equivocation from the White House when asked whether the rise of anti-Semitism is wrong. There should be no equivocation from a Member of Congress about whether to stand with Israel or with terrorist groups like Hamas. Today, this body is speaking loudly to the international community that Israel must have the resources to defend itself from genocidal terrorists. With one voice, let us support H. Res. 771 and stand with Israel. If, Mr. Speaker, you cannot bring yourself to support this resolution today, I would encourage any such Member to do the right thing and resign from this body. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the former majority leader of this distinguished body. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. For millennia, the Jews of the world have been subject all over the world to prejudice, hate, and violence. Mr. Speaker, I have visited the Kfar Aza kibbutz over four times in the last 25 years. It was a place of community. On October 7, Hamas turned it into a place of slaughter. This brutal terrorist organization will pursue its genocidal, anti- Semitic mission to fight and kill Jews. That is their purpose. The Jewish State of Israel will cease to exist if their objectives are achieved. Hamas will not yield, and neither can we. As the resolution makes clear, we will stand by our ally Israel; have their back, Mr. Chairman. Dozens of American civilians have been killed, wounded, and held captive in this war. We have also seen the scourge of anti-Semitism here in America. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Flood). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we must follow this resolution with action. We must all vote for this resolution and speak with one voice; action that shows the world that America will defend its allies in Israel, in Ukraine, and around the world. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to support this bipartisan resolution, which has been offered by our chairman Mike McCaul and our ranking member Greg Meeks. I was born with an appreciation for the people of Jewish faith. My birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, at the time of the American Revolution had the largest Jewish population in the New World who had come here to escape oppression and to achieve freedom, which they achieved in America. I am grateful today to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle East, North Africa, and Central Africa and co-chairman of the Israel Caucus. Just 7 weeks ago today, I met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is so courageous and is serving there in Jerusalem. I pledged then my support of Israel to defend itself from a nuclear Iran, which also includes, of course, support of Israel from the barbaric invasion of Hamas, the puppets of Iran who have conducted murder, killing hundreds of persons, 1,200 at least, and even possibly more that, indeed, are puppets of Iran to kill people in Israel. Sadly, we are in a conflict we did not choose with dictators with rule of gun invading democracies with rule of law. On October 7, which is the Israeli equivalent of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, I was grateful to be attending the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Copenhagen, Denmark, where with Finland and Sweden, Western civilization has never been more united to defend Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. America's resolve for Israel I saw firsthand on May 14, 2018, leading a House delegation to fulfill President Donald Trump's opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem with the extraordinary Ambassador David Friedman. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues of both parties to support the resolution. {time} 1600 Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Hakeem Jeffries for his speech in favor of the importance of this resolution. The scenes from Gaza are horrendous and some cry out for a cease- fire. Hamas cannot follow a cease-fire. They exist and it is in their charter to kill every Jew in the Middle East. If they agreed to a cease-fire, they would fall apart. They had a cease-fire on October 6, which is why they killed 1,400 civilians on October 7. We can get a cease-fire when Hamas agrees to disarm and release the hostages. The loud voices demanding a cease-fire should be shouting at Hamas demanding those two actions. We hear quotes from the Gaza Ministry of Health. The Gaza Ministry of Health counts in their death counts the terrorists who are killed and mixes them with the civilians. The Gaza Ministry of Health is under the control of Hamas. Hamas brutally murders Palestinians who dare to dissent. It forces innocent Palestinians to act as human shields, and it steals aid meant for civilians. Thirty percent of the time when it shoots a rocket in an effort to kill an Israeli civilian, the rocket never leaves Gaza and it falls down to Earth where it may kill Palestinians, including those who died at that hospital in Gaza. Israel is characterized as somehow a European colony. Keep in mind, the majority of Israeli Jews are there from Arab States and Iran from which they have been expelled or persecuted. This is a Middle Eastern country of Middle Eastern descent from people who, 2,000 years ago, lived there but also lived there right until the Arab States expelled them or persecuted them. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a time when we can have a two-state solution, that begins with the destruction of Hamas. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), the chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific. Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to demonstrate that this House stands united with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists. On October 7, we watched in horror as hundreds of terrorists poured across the Israel-Gaza border and massacred, kidnapped, and raped Israelis. It is abhorrent. This is at the hands of Hamas [[Page H5057]] and Hezbollah terrorist groups backed and funded by the Iran regime. They want to wipe Israel off the map. Thousands of rockets have fallen on Israel and continue falling as we speak. This has been the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust. I visited Israel last year, and I felt the constant threat of attack that the people of Israel face. It reminded me of my time growing up in South Korea as a young girl after the Korean war, and I felt that constant threat coming from North Korea. This is really personal to me. Hamas now holds around 200 hostages from Israel, the U.S., and other countries around the world. Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist aggression, bring its hostages home, and its right to exist. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for leading this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a strong member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for leading on this resolution. Hamas is a terrorist organization that is backed by Iran, driven by hate, and committed to genocide. Since its founding, Hamas has been dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews. All who cherish life, value democracy, and seek justice must resolutely condemn Hamas, condemn its heinous attack on October 7, and condemn its war with Israel. Israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself against Hamas, to protect its citizens, to secure its borders, and to rescue its hostages no matter how long it takes. Peace will only come after Hamas releases the hostages, ceases launching rockets at Israeli neighborhoods from Palestinian neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals, and Hamas no longer governs Gaza or threatens Israel. Until then, Palestinians and Israelis cannot know peace. Three points: Hamas is a murderous organization and its aspirations are no different than al-Qaida or ISIS. Twenty-two years ago, the United States went to war halfway across the world. Today, Hamas is not halfway across the world, but is entrenched on Israel's border. Point number two: Israel must be able to defend itself and protect its citizens. Point number three: The United States, the United States Congress, and the American people stand with Israel. Our relationship is unbreakable. Our commitment to Israel's security to a Jewish democratic State is ironclad. Israel has no better friend than the United States and the United States has no better friend than Israel. To those who cheer Hamas, who turn a blind eye to murder, rape, torture, and kidnapping, you cast your lot with the barbarians and share in their shame. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa). Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, many in this body continue to say that no words can describe the horror that the Israeli people are facing. That is not true. There are words to describe it and they have to be said. Some of those words are simply the facts, the real information that we are not seeing. One of them is that we are constantly hearing from pro- Palestinian groups that in fact you have a right to resist occupation. I have been in this body since 2001. I was in Israel under Ariel Sharon when he withdrew every single settler and every soldier from Gaza. Gaza has not been under occupation, just the opposite. When they didn't like the control they had after an election, Hamas seized, by violence, the control of Gaza, killing their fellow Palestinians. Since that time, they have been a war-making machine that has in fact been financed by Iran, equipped by Iran, and today it is Iran that owes an apology to the world, and the Palestinian people need to discount forever their association. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), another strong member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), and the chair for putting together this very strong resolution, H.R. 771. The United States unequivocally stands with the State of Israel and its people. The world is watching our actions today and tomorrow and by our actions will determine the future of democracies around the world; therefore, we must be unified and bipartisan. Terrorism is never ever justified. Israel has the right to exist and defend itself against Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist group whose only purpose is to destroy the State of Israel and its people. Therefore, Congress and the President must together pass a strong bipartisan package to support our ally Israel. We must send a strong message to Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah not to escalate the situation. In the President's word: ``Don't.'' Don't think about it. America defends its allies, Israel, Ukraine, and other freedom-loving democracies around the world. We stand by our word. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority leader. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for coming together on this critical, important piece of legislation, the first piece of legislation under Speaker Mike Johnson, to stand with our friend Israel as they are under attack from Hamas and other terrorist organizations. Let's not forget what has happened because there are reports that Iran and other terrorist organizations worked with Hamas for not only months, but possibly over a year, planning these vicious attacks that now result in war and death of so many people--not just Israelis, Americans, hostages, so many injured, and thousands more. This is horrific. This is an opportunity for people all around the world to stand with Israel's right to defend themselves. As we look at the casualties, the devastation, and the barbaric nature of the attacks coming from Hamas and Gaza, we must recognize that the funding that goes to these terrorist organizations can be stopped with stronger action from this Congress. I know we are going to be coming together again to address some of those issues. We need to stand up against Iran's ability to sell oil on the world markets because they use those billions of dollars in funds to also augment and fund terrorism to groups like Hamas. Everybody knows it happens, it has been going on for years and years and it must stop. We must stand up against it. We must also freeze the $6 billion that still hasn't been transferred but that was negotiated as part of a settlement that even Iran has admitted can be used for whatever purpose they want, including funding terrorism. We can't stand by and let that happen either. As we are taking strong action to stand with Israel, our friend in the Middle East, we must also stand up to the anti-Semitism that we see here in our country that pops its ugly head during ugly times like this. Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues. There are 425 co-sponsors on this piece of legislation that shows that even in a divided Congress we can come together when it is time to support our strongest ally in the region when they are under attack. We strongly stand with Israel. Mr. Speaker, let's pass this legislation overwhelmingly. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the former chair of the House Appropriations Committee and the current Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am devastated by Hamas' brutal attacks on innocent civilians in Israel, which include taking children, women, and elderly people hostage. I strongly stand by our ally Israel and unequivocally support its right to defend itself. This vicious assault was enabled by Iran, which has publicly praised the attacks. Now more than ever, it is vital [[Page H5058]] that the United States does not walk away from its global commitment to defend democracy. This war is against Hamas; it is not the Palestinian people. Palestinians have also lost communities and loved ones because of Hamas' atrocities. Israel has to end Hamas' role in Gaza, while we work together to minimize harm to civilian populations. Hamas' presence is an assault on humanity, and I want to work with the unity governmental in Israel to create the conditions for peace again. As ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am intent on ensuring that we do everything that we can to provide the humanitarian and military assistance that is necessary for Israel to recover from this devastation and continue to defend itself. {time} 1615 Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, let's be honest. If Hamas puts down its guns, peace will happen. If Israel does that, they will be slaughtered. In these brutal attacks by Hamas terrorists, they have killed over 1,400 Israelis and taken over 200 hostages, including American citizens. I thought it was very telling when I saw a Jewish father on the news celebrating the fact that his daughter had died in the initial attack because he was afraid that she had been abducted and all these horrible, horrible things these dirtbags would have done to her. We have had a few weeks of discontent here in this body, but today, I think we all stand united with Israel as a body. Israel and the Jewish people have long been targets. Hamas must understand their time is over, and they are about to meet their fate and their maker. We stand in solidarity with the people of Israel in their fight against these worthless thugs--Hamas, Hezbollah, and any other Iranian- backed terrorist group. Our enemies must know that we are committed to our allies and that our enemies will die. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the current ranking member. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the very first thing I want to say is this: Take note, those of you who are around the world watching this House of Representatives in action, that the very first bill that we are putting out is a bill to send a powerful message that we not only stand with Israel, but we will fight with Israel. There is absolutely no way, as God is our maker, that we are going to stand by and see Israel destroyed. Make no mistake about it. It is as clear as a bell. In the Holy Scriptures brought down by the mighty hand of God Almighty: Stand with my people, the people of Israel. Mr. Speaker, I was called upon as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to go to Iran to write the paper on Iran. I met the people of Iran, and I want the people of Iran to listen: Go to your mullahs. Go to your leadership. They are the ones that control Hamas, Hezbollah. Then, I call upon our friends in Saudi Arabia. The answer to this is in your hands. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there has never been a more important moment in the relationship between the United States and Israel. I call upon this body to take all necessary actions to unequivocally stand with Israel as it fights for its very existence in this unprovoked war launched by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists. I have and always will do everything in my power to stand with Israel. I, like the rest of the civilized world, have been disgusted with the unspeakable and barbaric atrocities imposed on innocent Israeli women and children by these animals that call themselves Hamas. We must enact policies to provide Israel with anything and everything it needs to defend itself, to immediately end all illegal aid payments to the Palestinian terrorists, and to hold Iran accountable. As long as I have a vote in Congress, I will always cast my vote in support of the Jewish state. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of California (Ms. Pelosi), the Honorable Speaker Emerita. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to support one of our closest allies in the world and partners, Israel, as she defends herself against terrorist attacks. I thank Chairman McCaul for his leadership in bringing this to the floor. I also thank Chairman McCaul as well as Ranking Member Meeks for their leadership and working together, crafting this resounding statement of support, and doing so in a unifying, bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker, on October 7, we watched in horror as Hamas terrorists unleashed a brutal assault on Israel's families and slaughtered so many. We have gone into some detail about the brutality of it all. It is brutality outside the circle of civilized human behavior. The attacks were horrible. With this resolution, the United States Congress resoundingly declares our support for Israel, not with revenge but with justice, that justice will be done. While doing so, we continue to remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with civilians caught in the middle of the war. I echo Secretary Blinken's call for a humanitarian pause so that innocent lives can be saved. Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, on the floor of this House, my father, Thomas D'Alesandro, as a Member of Congress from Maryland, called upon the Roosevelt administration to support the establishment of the State of Israel in what was known as Palestine at the time. He was early in calling for that, so it is in my DNA to protect that State of Israel. Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel. Hamas has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States. Hamas must be destroyed, but in destroying them, we must protect the children in Gaza. They use them as shields. We want to protect them. This resolution, with overwhelming bipartisan support on the floor of the House, is so necessary. I urge a unanimous vote and thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important resolution affirming Israel's right to self-defense against this savage war perpetrated by Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorists. While it was Hamas terrorists who invaded peaceful communities across Israel, decapitating babies, burning elderly women alive, kidnapping innocent civilians, including Holocaust survivors, it was Iran that was working behind the scenes to fund these acts of terror. I support this resolution because it calls out the mullahs in Tehran for funding Hamas and enabling this attack to occur. How did this happen? In short, it happened because the Biden administration's foreign policy allowed it to happen. Our government designated Iran as a state sponsor of terror, yet the Biden administration pursued a policy of weakness and appeasement toward Tehran. Since the Biden administration took office, Iran has generated approximately $80 billion in revenue from oil sales, and that is because this administration rolled back the Trump administration's successful maximum pressure campaign. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. BARR. In 2021, the administration lifted oil sanctions on Iran. The sanctions relief was so helpful to the regime that the deputy chief of the Central Bank of Iran said that Iran's foreign currency reserves were growing due to the growth of oil and other exports. For months, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan, and other officials have chased another JCPOA to release billions of dollars in sanction assets. Now we see the administration effectively incentivize Hamas [[Page H5059]] to take American hostages by facilitating the transfer of $6 billion from South Korea to Iranian banks in Qatar, a deal that this administration claims it has frozen for now but Qatar and Iran say is available to them today. Support this resolution. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 7 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz). Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and the State of Israel and to speak out against the horrific murder of 1,400 Israeli civilians and the kidnapping of hundreds more. The unspeakable, genocidal violence inflicted on Israelis and the Jewish people by Hamas terrorists goes beyond condemnation. It demands action. As part of a bipartisan and bicameral delegation, I was in the region in pursuit of peace when Hamas launched their cowardly attack on civilian communities. Three days later, I met with Israeli's unified leadership and pledged continued U.S. support for the defense of the Jewish state. President Biden has led our Nation in mourning the dead, praying for the kidnapped, and mobilizing to support Israel in eradicating Iranian- backed death cults like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic jihad, which are dedicated to the elimination of the Jewish people. Israel has never had a stronger ally and the Jewish community has never had a stronger advocate or stronger voice in the Oval Office. The unconscionable apathy of many nations and many in our own Nation is a sobering reminder of the fact that Israel remains surrounded by hostility and danger. As a proud Jewish American and Zionist, let me be clear: Israel has a right to defend itself, and Hamas must be destroyed. As an advocate for peace, normalization, and a two-state solution, it must be stated that Hamas is the primary obstacle to all three. We should not tolerate Americans who rationalize massacres and lionize monsters while spouting off anti-Semitic tropes and accusations. I will not equivocate because there is no equivalence between Israel's righteous efforts to protect its civilians and democracy from terror and Hamas using innocent Palestinians as a human shield, broadcasting carnage, burning families alive, and raping teenage girls to death. ``Am Yisrael chai''; ``the people of Israel live.'' Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this bipartisan, strong resolution. Iran and Russia are locked in a poisonous partnership committed to terror--terror in Ukraine, terror in Syria. Iran, as the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is further committed to the destruction of our ally Israel. On October 7, Iran's puppet, Hamas, commenced its most recent sick, savage slaughter of innocents. America was the first nation to recognize Israel in 1948. Over the decades, we have stood at her side when she has been attacked by force over her borders. We have stood by her side at anti-Semitic rhetoric in the halls of the United Nations. Together, we have been at the peace table seeking solutions. Today, united we stand on this House floor in prayer for the safe return of all the hostages taken by Hamas. I urge adoption on a strong bipartisan basis of this resolution in support of our ally Israel. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Thanedar). Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771. I firmly stand with Israel in the face of terrorism from Hamas. When I visited Israel in August, I saw how they were surrounded by threats. Now, those threats have come true in the most violent and terrible possible way. Let me be clear, our goal is the eradication of terrorists and terrorism from the face of this Earth. We call on and expect the Israeli army to try to minimize civilian casualties. We should make every reasonable effort to protect innocent Palestinians, but there can be no cease-fire until Hamas releases all hostages, stops its rocket attacks, and surrenders the leaders of the terrorist attack. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kean), the chair of the Subcommittee on Europe. Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding me time. On the morning of Saturday, October 7, Hamas launched the most brutal and expansive surprise attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago. {time} 1630 The world stood in shock as reports and images began to surface of civilians murdered, young children beheaded, and Holocaust survivors being dragged into Gaza as hostages. Like many of my colleagues in this Chamber, I spent the past weeks engaging with the Jewish community leaders in my district, reassuring them of their communities' safety and speaking with constituents who had to flee back to the United States. I stand here in support of this overwhelming bipartisan resolution, which has almost every single Member of the House of Representatives as a cosponsor. As the House of Representatives, we support Israel's right to self- defense and survival. We stand against Hamas, against its terror, and against its masters in Tehran. We stand with Israel in its fight for survival and against anti-Semitism in all of its forms. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel). Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my grandfather, Abe, fled the Holocaust as 6 million Jews were shot and tortured and gassed and starved. We often say, ``never again.'' Yet on October 7 it happened again, and make no mistake: The brutal, barbaric attacks by Hamas was not about freeing innocent people; it was about destroying Israel and killing Jews. Today, I am proud to stand with all those who condemn Hamas, support Israel's right to defend itself, and reaffirm the United States' commitment to Israel's security. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, women, children, babies slaughtered. The worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel has a right to exist, a right to defend itself. We have Members in this body that do not believe that. We have Members in this body that cannot muster the courage or the strength to condemn the slaughtering of babies but have the audacity to repeat a vile and disgusting lie that Israel bombed a hospital. They are not worthy of serving in this body, and the fact that we have people that didn't even sign on to this resolution tells you everything you need to know. If you cannot stand with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, a beacon of democracy and hope and freedom, you do not belong in this body. Those Members should resign in disgrace. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 4 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff). Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of this critical resolution to condemn Hamas' brutal attack on Israel and reiterate our Nation's support, our strong support, for our greatest ally in the Middle East--Israel. We all know that Hamas' heinous and unprovoked attack on innocent Israelis is barbaric. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to stand united with Israel. Let me be clear: Israel has a fundamental right to defend herself and her people during this war. I am honored to be chairman of the bipartisan House-Knesset Parliamentary Friendship Group. From both [[Page H5060]] sides of the aisle, our members' support for the only democracy in the Middle East is absolutely ironclad. This resolution demonstrates our unwavering commitment to Israel and our relationship. It is important for our Nation and the rest of the world to hear this strong support and commitment from the United States' House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for their leadership. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Davis). Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, which expresses unwavering support for Israel. This past August, I traveled to Israel. I find it absolutely heart- wrenching as I think of the very place that I visited just days later was attacked by Hamas at the Kfar Aza kibbutz where 58 people in the community were massacred and 17 kidnapped. It is just awful to think of babies being killed, people being slaughtered and gunned down in cold blood. At least 33 Americans have lost their lives. Others are missing. Let's be clear: A nation must respond, and, yes, we must respond. Let us continue to extend our unwavering support to Israel and ensure that the people of Israel have everything necessary to defend themselves and dismantle these egregious Hamas fighters. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, freedom-loving Texan and sitting member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, the events in Israel these past weeks are of utmost concern, but beyond that, they should concern every American and, frankly, every member of humanity regardless of religion, ethnicity, race, gender, or political affiliation. What we have seen in these past weeks is pure hate and pure evil. Hamas is a well-known, Iranian-backed terrorist organization whose official charter calls for the obliteration of Israel and the Jewish people. Let's consider that for a moment. These last few weeks have been proof of their commitment to this goal. How should we respond in the United States? The U.S. should act strategically with strength and steadiness so that those enemies of the U.S. and Israel are overwhelmed and ultimately defeated in their entirety. We must stand firmly with Israel with whatever they need. Now is not the time for timidity. It is the time for strength and unity with Israel. Such action will help deter evil in the future, preserve life, and promote liberty. Now is the time for us to be all in. We need to offer strength and steadiness in this time. Let us begin by standing with Israel. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose). Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of America's greatest ally in the Middle East--Israel, its people, and its right to defend itself against the horrifying Hamas terrorist attacks that have taken the lives of so many innocent individuals, including 33 Americans. Since that deadly attack, I have been working to assist Tennesseans and their families and friends in Israel in their attempts to come home. I have also joined members of the Tennessee delegation in a letter to President Biden urging him to support Israel by any means possible, including by providing any weapons and munitions necessary and punishing all involved in aiding the Hamas terrorists. Lastly, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution we are here voting on today, which reaffirms our commitment to Israel and condemns Hamas' brutal terrorist attacks. Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect and defend our friend Israel. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger). Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back at work, doing the important work of the House. Mr. Speaker, the United States stands united in the face of the horrific, barbaric attacks on our greatest ally in the Middle East-- Israel. The October 7 attack, nearly 50 years to the day after the Yom Kippur War, was horrific. More than 1,500-plus people murdered, hundreds more taken hostage, including American citizens. The brutality is unlike anything we have seen in modern times. With women and children being raped and babies beheaded, this cannot be the norm. Israel has every right to protect themselves, to defend themselves and their sovereignty. Our country must support Israel's efforts to protect its citizens and uphold its sovereignty without question. With misinformation and the horrible pro-Hamas demonstrations across the world, the U.S. Congress must reaffirm our unwavering support for Israel. Together, we must work toward a lasting peace that ensures the security and prosperity of our Jewish friends and Israel. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder in this pursuit, unwavering in our commitment to justice, freedom, and the enduring bonds that bind our nations together. We stand with Israel today and forever. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher). Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Israel and H. Res. 771. Israel is our most important partner in fighting terrorism. In fact, they are the first line of defense for the U.S. when it comes to terrorism because the sources of that terrorism are the same for both of us. Israel is a fabulous intelligence partner. I liken them to a giant antenna in the Middle East that serves and provides information to America. As the only true democracy in the Middle East, Israel is a beacon for the American ideals of freedom, personal liberty, and market economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand together and support Israel and H. Res. 771. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, let me start off by thanking my friend and colleague, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul, for his friendship and for working collectively together to make sure that the world knows that there is no daylight between us when it comes to us standing with our friend and our ally the State of Israel, and I appreciate you. When we first started this, after this horrendous attack on October 7, we had a conversation. We said, let's make sure that we put out a statement collectively, us giving our opinions as chair and ranking member of this committee. Then immediately thereafter, we went to work on a resolution so that the world would know where the United States' House of Representatives stood. We thought we would get it done earlier, but we knew that the first bill, the first resolution that would come to the floor after the House resumed its business, would be this bill because this bill is so significantly important to state that we have the back of our friend and ally, and we want to make sure that Hamas does not exist. Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege and the opportunity to visit Israel several times. I have been in some of those tunnels. I have talked to the people, and when I have talked to the people of Israel, all they say is that they want to live in peace. When I talk to the Palestinian people in Gaza or in the West Bank, they say they want peace, but the Hamas terrorist organization when you look at their mandate, they say they want the destruction of Israel. You cannot have peace. You can't even negotiate peace if one side says you should not exist. How can you say that you want a better relationship if you are saying that Israel should not exist? {time} 1645 You can't forget the horrific terrorist ISIS-like atrocities that were committed on October 7. You cannot be silent. You can't sit back and make believe that it didn't happen because it did. Mr. Speaker, I say, as we end this debate, thank you to the American people for standing with our friend and ally, the State of Israel. [[Page H5061]] Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Meeks, as well. Mr. Speaker, that is how the Foreign Affairs Committee operates. The fact that this is the most bipartisan resolution in modern history with 425 cosponsors, over 97 percent of this body, speaks volumes. It sends a strong message to the people of Israel that the United States Congress and the American people stand firmly behind you. The Hamas Covenant states, ``Ranks will close, fighters joining other fighters, and masses everywhere in the Islamic world will come forward in response to the call of duty, loudly proclaiming: `Hail to Jihad.' This cry will reach the heavens and will go on being resounded until liberation is achieved, the invaders vanquished, and Allah's victory comes about.'' In response to this, we will strengthen our resolve to stand with our ally Israel. This resolution sends a clear and unequivocal message that the United States House of Representatives and the American people condemn the barbarity of the genocide and war crimes perpetrated by Hamas. We want to make it clear that Israel has the right to defend herself to prevent an event like this from ever happening again. We assure you that the United States will be shoulder to shoulder with Israel supporting her right to self-defense. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear: I have condemned Hamas for their heinous attacks on civilians and call for an immediate release of the Israeli hostages. I continue to call for the safety of all civilians in the Middle East. Unfortunately, today's resolution H. Res. 771 is horribly one-sided. By failing to acknowledge the growing loss of Palestinian lives or that all Palestinians are not Hamas, this resolution creates further division and spurs harmful rhetoric. We must defend our Jewish brothers and sisters from Antisemitism. Muslims must also be defended from Islamophobia, and not have their patriotism questioned because they believe in justice for Palestinians. As a senior Member of the Intelligence Committee and through my work on the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation Subcommittee--and having spent many years working in law enforcement--I am concerned that these kinds of one-sided resolutions have become and will continue to be recruitment tools for extremists. This is why I am co-leading H. Res. 786, the Ceasefire Now Resolution, which I believe is the best way to prevent further tragic loss of life to Palestinian civilians and simultaneously ensure the safe return of hostages. Only then can we begin to move towards a long- term, two-state solution that includes both Palestinians and Israelis living in peace and liberation, side by side. This resolution rightly mourns the nearly 1,400 Israelis and Americans killed and wounded. But it completely ignores the mounting deaths of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza since October 7th, which has reached an estimated 5,761--including over 2,360 children killed and over 870 children missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Provided below, for the Record, are updated assessments about the destruction and deaths that civilians have suffered. Pain and grief know no boundaries. The United States fails in our duties as an international leader if we do not wholeheartedly condemn all violations of international law, whether it is committed by Hamas or the Israeli government. The United States urgently needs a new approach to this decades-long conflict. The roots of these problems existed long before October 7th. The Israeli government's 16-year blockade on Gaza has been identified by major human rights organizations as collective punishment and a war crime--and it has resulted in poor health, social, educational, physical, and political infrastructure throughout Palestine. Although I will vote ``no'' on this resolution, I urge every colleague who will vote today for H. Res. 771, to join me in bringing H. Res. 786 to the floor for a Ceasefire Now. UNRWA Situation Report #14 on the situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) All information valid as of 24 October 2023 at 18:00 (local time)--Day 17 of hostilities 1. Key Points More than 613,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) are sheltering in 150 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza strip. In the last 24 hours, another three UNRWA staff members have been killed, bringing the total to 38 staff killed since 7 October. Two have been injured, one of whom is in a critical condition. One school in Rafah, sheltering 4,600 IDPs, sustained severe collateral damage due to a close proximity strike. One IDP was killed and 44 more were injured, including nine children. Fuel is urgently needed to continue the UNRWA lifesaving humanitarian operations. If fuel is not received into Gaza, UNRWA will be forced to significantly reduce and in some cases bring its humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip to a halt. The coming 24 hours are very critical. 2. Overall Situation The Gaza Strip According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, 5,791 people have been killed since 7 October, including 2,360 children, 1,292 women, 295 elderly, and 16,298 were injured. This is in addition to the 1,550 reported missing, presumably under the rubble of destroyed buildings, including 870 children. Overall, nearly 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, according to the Israel authorities, the vast majority on 7 October (OCHA). In the West Bank, 95 people have been killed and nearly 1,900 injured since 7 October. Overcrowding conditions in UNRWA shelters remain a serious concern, as the current facilities can no longer provide dignified living conditions. Some shelters are currently hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their designed capacity. 3. Humanitarian Access & Protection of Civilians THE GAZA STRIP Since 7 October, 38 UNRWA colleagues were killed and 20 have been injured, with one in critical condition. At least 42 UNRWA installations have been impacted since 7 October. 4. UNRWA Response THE GAZA STRIP UNRWA Shelters: The average number of IDPs per shelter has reached 2.7 times capacity, with some shelters reaching 12 times intended occupancy. In the Middle Area, one school is hosting up to 13,300 IDPs, while another facility in Khan Younis is hosting 21,000 persons. UNRWA continues to distribute assistance in shelters; however current conditions severely constrain access to essential services and represent a health and protection risk for IDPs. Health: The eight UNRWA health centres that remain operational in the South (out of 22) recorded 4,200 visits on 24 October for refugees and non-refugees. In addition to essential primary healthcare, post-natal and high-risk pregnancy care services resumed on 24 October with 40 displaced women receiving this service. Healthcare support for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) patients continued. Healthcare services were maintained within the UNRWA shelters, with the support of 93 mobile medical units and medical teams, serving around 10,000 cases at shelters. According to initial health assessments from the mobile medical teams there are over 37,500 persons with NCDs, over 4,660 pregnant women and around 390 post-natal cases requiring medical attention among the IDPs. In addition, medical teams are increasingly identifying cases of acute respiratory and diarrhea among children under five years old. UNRWA's stocks of medicines are critically decreasing with availability for a few more days only. UNRWA primary health centres are running out of fuel, threatening the provision of essential healthcare services. Psychosocial Support: UNRWA has counsellors and social workers in the shelters, who provide psychological first aid and other specialized protection services. Since the beginning of the crisis, UNRWA social workers provided 8,900 people with psychosocial support and social work services. These include cases that are referred for medication and other specialized mental health and psychosocial support interventions. Protection/Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU): UNRWA conducted a Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) to identify the different impacts of the war on women, man, girls and boys and better understand their different needs and coping strategies. The RGA highlighted the following: There is a shortage of feminine hygiene supplies and very few toilets. This results in increased challenges for females to maintain menstrual hygiene. Overcrowding and limited privacy increase familial tensions (which can increase the risk of GBV) and broader tensions between males. There are critical gaps in access to health services that particularly affect women and adolescent girls, including access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care, newborn care and sexual and reproductive health services. Water and Sanitation Services (WASH): Some solid waste collection from the camps and from emergency shelters and transfer to landfills continues in Middle, Khan Younis and Rafah areas with difficulties due to the scarcity of fuel and staff. Water wells in Jabalia, Khan Younis and Rafah are functional with about 11,000 m\\3\\ being pumped from nine water wells. [[Page H5062]] Despite the limited availability of fuel, desalination plants continue to operate in the shelters for the provision of potable water. Water trucking operations in shelters in Rafah and Khan Younis also continue; however, the potable water provided is not enough to meet all needs. Maintenance and rehabilitation work at shelters continue on a daily basis. This includes essential repairs and upgrading of shelters to accommodate additional IDPs when possible, as well as the installation of mobile showers and toilet units. This resolution, while mourning the devastating loss of Israeli civilian life, fails to even acknowledge the killing and targeting of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli military. It uses incendiary language that encourages the suffocating military siege of the Gaza Strip and that escalates violence and war. Furthermore, by stating Congressional support for possible shipment of further US weapons to the Israeli military, this resolution will significantly worsen and exacerbate violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians alike. Since this resolution was introduced, the Israeli government and military have continued to carry out shocking and horrifying violence, including clear and documented war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza. It does not even so much as acknowledge the overwhelming loss of life of Palestinians. The Israeli military has already targeted Palestinian residential buildings, in some cases wiping out entire generations of the same Palestinian family, killed over 2,000 children, attacked first responders, demolished mosques, and bombed schools. The Meeks McCaul resolution fails to name or address any of these war crimes, or to even acknowledge that Palestinian civilians have been killed by the Israeli military. Several days ago, after this resolution was introduced, the Israeli Air Force announced that it had dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza in six days. Experts have said that this means Israel has dropped, in less than a week, the same amount of bombs that the U.S. dropped in a year of war in Afghanistan--and in a much smaller and more densely populated area. Those of us who want to build a future toward peace must wake up and speak out against this. Israeli officials themselves have stated clearly that they are carrying out collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza and use dehumanizing rhetoric that fuels the violence. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said: ``I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.'' As members of Congress, it is our moral obligation not to support or echo these calls. Last Friday, after this resolution was introduced, the Israeli military called for all civilians of Gaza City--1.1 million people--to relocate south within 24 hours, as it amassed tanks for an expected ground invasion. The UN responded that evacuating everyone was impossible, with power supplies cut and food and water running short after Israel placed Gaza under total siege, and said this would have ``devastating humanitarian consequences.'' The scale of atrocities is enormous. Doctors Without Borders staff say that painkillers and anesthesia for operations have run out in Gaza, and sick patients are screaming in pain while they also face the looming threat of bombardment. They have called on Israel to ``show humanity''--and we in Congress must do the same. More quotes from Israeli government officials reflecting dehumanizing and violent rhetoric, and intentions to carry out collective punishment against Palestinians in Gaza: ``I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.'' Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant ``This is a war between the children of light and the children of darkness . . . It will be a deadly war.'' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ``Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home.'' Israeli Minister of Energy Israel Katz ``Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There will be no buildings.'' Israeli security official ``I say to the residents of Gaza: leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere.'' Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Palestinian civilians are literally unable to flee or leave, because they are trapped under a 16-year Israeli military siege. ``Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset Ariel Kallner, referring to 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes and land. ``It's time to be cruel.'' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich ``We need to deliver a blow that has not been seen for 50 years and take down Gaza.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset Haim Katz ``Hamas has opened the gates of hell into the Gaza strip.'' Head of the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories Specifics notes on the resolution: ``Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea, including firing thousands of rockets;'' This whereas clause decontextualizes this violence, which did not begin on Saturday. Between January and September 2023, Israel killed 227 Palestinians, according to the UN. Israeli settlers have rampaged throughout Palestinian communities, torching houses and killing people. Entire Palestinian communities have been driven from their homes by Israeli settler violence. Israel has repeatedly attacked the more than 2 million Palestinians living under its more than 16-year siege of Gaza, killing thousands of Palestinian civilians, including hundreds of Palestinian children. Palestinians have endured more than 75 years of brutal Israeli rule, during which time tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. They have suffered from the systematic violation of their human rights by Israel since 1948 and have been denied their freedom and self- determination. Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed over 700 Israelis and injured more than 2,500 others; The failure of this whereas clause to mention the fact that Israel has killed more than 6,546 Palestinians since October 7, including over 2,000 children, is deeply problematic. All human life is precious and sacred. This deliberate erasure of Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply dehumanizing. Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians; This whereas clause blames Palestinians for their own deaths. War crimes go not justify more war crimes. Israel has decided to attack Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by targeting residential buildings, hospitals, ambulances, schools, and mosques in one of the most densely populated places on earth, knowing full well the grievous toll that such attacks will inflict on Palestinian civilians. Israel, especially as the occupying power of the Gaza Strip under international law, is responsible for any violations of human rights and international law it commits, just as Hamas is responsible for any violations that it commits. Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment such as bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including through thorough vetting of assistance; This whereas clause advocates for the tightening of Israel's more than 15 year illegal siege against 2 million Palestinian civilians trapped in the Gaza Strip. Imposing collective punishment against civilians by denying them access to food, clean water, electricity, fuel, healthcare and medicine, etc.--all prominent components of Israel's illegal siege on Gaza--is a grave war crime. Stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists; Congress should stand with all victims of violence, not express selective concern for the lives of some but not others. This resolved clause dehumanizes the Palestinian people. Mourns the over 700 Israelis killed and over 2,000 others wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on Israel; The failure to even mention Palestinian deaths in this resolved clause is deeply problematic. Congress should mourn the loss of all civilians killed, including the more than 6,546 Palestinians since October 7, including over 2,000 children. All human life is precious and sacred. This deliberate erasure of Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply dehumanizing. Stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply and other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support. Congress should be taking steps to save lives and end the violence, not exacerbate the violence by sending additiona1 weapons to Israel. Israel is already committing apparent war crimes by targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza. Providing Israel with more weapons deepens U.S. complicity in Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians and reinforces the existing, untenable status quo of Israeli oppression of Palestinians. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to describe the anguish I feel in the aftermath of the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas. It continues the record I've seen from Hamas for as long as I've been in Congress. Under Yasser Arafat, Hamas torpedoed a peace agreement that was almost adopted with President Clinton. The pain was magnified because we were so close to an agreement for lasting peace. Even though optimism for the two-state solution has faded, I still believe it is the best chance for long-term peace and security. Ultimately, there is no military solution to this conflict. I've traveled to Israel several times over the last 25 years and am heartsick that the optimism I first encountered there appears to have melted away. During my first trip to Israel in 1999, I met at a police command center in Ramallah led by both an Israeli officer and a Palestinian officer who were working cooperatively towards keeping the peace. Now we are on the edge of a humanitarian catastrophe made even worse with the widening scope of this war. I am deeply concerned for the safety and security of the two million civilians in Gaza, [[Page H5063]] half of whom are children. Israel cutting off water, electricity, medicine, fuel, and humanitarian aid has already created horrific consequences. These actions are not recipes for lasting peace in the region. It was important for President Biden to acknowledge the mistakes that America made in our military response to 9/11 in Iraq and Afghanistan. We lost our perspective. We overreacted and the world is still paying the price. I hope the Israeli government pays attention to the President's words of caution--to follow international law and responsibilities for the rules of war. They must work to avoid civilian casualties. As someone who has worked for years trying to solve the water and sanitation crisis in Gaza, I know full well the consequences they face. As Congress provides funding to deal with this crisis, I hope we can redouble our effort for humanitarian assistance, using our leverage to urge restraint, and move as quickly as possible to help the Palestinian people. I hope there is a humanitarian pause with a corridor for civilian safety so that it can allow a reset for food, water and medicine, and fuel to help them survive. I pray that everyone will work together to avoid having this humanitarian crisis spill out in the region and engulfing more people and accomplishing nothing. Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, cognizant of the urgency of the situation in the Middle East and the spirit in which this resolution has been put forth. As we conscientiously denounce the horrific crimes against humanity committed by Hamas, let us remember our ultimate goal of peace, the need for diplomacy, as well as our commitment to a two-state solution. I regret that the vision of peace between Israel and Palestine by way of a two-state solution is not referenced in the resolution. I sincerely believe that this non-inclusion risks conveying an incomplete representation of our nation's long-standing position on this pressing matter at a critical time in our history. The situation in Israel and Palestine is highly sensitive, and our response should denounce the violation of human rights, while supporting Israeli and Palestinian victims. Omitting such judicious principled concepts from our resolution could inadvertently give the erroneous impression that we have abandoned the Palestinians as well as the two-state solution to peace. I called these issues to the attention of the Foreign Affairs Committee in a letter delivered to the committee on October 12, 2023. To this end and because I had no hand in drafting the resolution, I propose that we amend the resolution under consideration to include the following: ``Whereas the U.S. House of Representatives desires lasting peace between Israel and Palestine.'', ``Whereas the two-state solution has and continues to be the best path to lasting peace.'', ``Whereas we mourn the deaths and suffering of babies as well as innocent Palestinian and Israeli people of all ages.'', ``Whereas our support for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian babies and innocent civilian Palestinian people is a necessity.'', and ``Resolved that the House of Representatives desires a two-state solution that leads to peace between Israel and Palestine.'' The resolution without these principle points will lead me, as a matter of conscience, to not vote ``yea.'' I realize that on this vote I may stand alone. However, on votes of conscience I believe it is better to stand alone than not stand at all. As we witness the calls for war, let us remember our moral imperative to stand for peace at the genesis of war. Doing so will make clear our unwavering commitment to not only Israel's defense but also to the ultimate vision of peace that we all wish to see materialize in the region. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the immediate aftermath of the horrific October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, I co- sponsored H. Res. 771 in solidarity with the people of Israel. The resolution was intended to send an immediate message of bipartisan support. Unfortunately, Republican dysfunction (inability to elect a speaker of the House) prevented the resolution from moving to the floor for nearly three weeks. In the interim, as the conflict deepened, my Republican colleagues refused to update the text of the resolution to reference the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the civilian casualties in both Israel and Gaza. While I support many of the goals of this resolution, Congress must recognize that the suffering from this war is not one- sided. As I will vote present on this resolution, I hope that Congress can put partisanship aside, helping Israel and pushing Hamas to work toward an immediate ceasefire--or, at minimum, a temporary cessation of hostilities to protect civilians, transport humanitarian aid, and secure the safe return of all hostages. Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771, the bipartisan resolution condemning the heinous October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas that have resulted in the senseless deaths of Israelis, Palestinians, and more than 30 American citizens. Hundreds remain missing and many are held hostage--including women, children, and even infants. Savage attacks killing innocent civilians are never justified, and the Hamas attacks of October 7 were perpetrated against Israeli communities for the goal of annihilation. These crimes cross a red line and must be unequivocally condemned as they are clear violations of international human rights law. Israel has a right to defend its citizens from this Hamas terrorism. But Israel's response must be proportional and consider the innocent Palestinian lives at stake in Gaza. In the past two weeks, we have seen an escalating wave of violence across the region. It is clear that a broader conflict must be prevented. That is why I have publicly called on President Biden to work with all involved parties on negotiating an immediate regional ceasefire to avoid the loss of more innocent lives. A one-sided ceasefire is not sustainable and will fail. It must include Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and other parties, with the support of the international community. The international community must also continue working together to facilitate critical humanitarian aid to Gaza--the population of which is nearly half children--so Palestinians have access to food, water, medicine, and fuel. I also recognize that this violence is not just a far-away matter; it is hitting close to home. Many families here in the United States and overseas are living in unimaginable fear while mourning those they have lost. I am hearing from many Jewish constituents and community leaders who are in pain and who have loved ones among the injured, killed, or missing. I commend the U.S. State Department for their work bringing Americans home from Israel, but more work needs to be done--there are American citizens in Gaza who seek to come home and have been prevented from doing so. I am deeply saddened and outraged about the brutal murder of an innocent six-year-old boy in Illinois, because he happened to be Palestinian-American. The violent, hate-filled targeting of Wadea AI- Fayoume or anyone else based on ethnicity or religious affiliation is unconscionable and should be condemned by everyone. Hate has no place in America, and Antisemitism and lslamophobia must not be tolerated. It is my hope for the future that every Israeli child and every Palestinian child to be tucked into bed at night by their parents without fear of bombings and perpetual violence. All people deserve safety and security, and the only sustainable path forward is one where international human rights and international law are at the forefront and democratic ideals are upheld.
