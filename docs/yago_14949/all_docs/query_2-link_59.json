        "text": "Title: Art Imitates Life\n\nAuthor: Diane\n\nFandom: The Boondock Saints\n\nPairing: Connor/Murphy\n\nRating: R (language, violence)\n\nSpoilers: I'm sure there's a few in there for the movie.\n\nWarnings: Uh, as my friend Dave used to say incest is best. So yeah. Not your cuppa tea, I wouldn't read it.\n\nArchive: Ask, and ye shall receive.\n\nSummary: This is not the way it's supposed to end.\n\nDisclaimer: I wish I came up with this movie. I'd be a cult god or something. Not mine.\n\nNotes: 1) First Saints fic. Be kind. 2) Written for the contrelamontre kisses in unusual places challenge. Used about 40 minutes. 3) Cross posted to contrelamontre. 4) First time I've done one of these… 5) Anyone have a better title suggestion?\n\nLife is not a fucking movie. He knows this. But, fucking hell, this is not the way it's supposed to end.\n\nHe cased a fucking purse snatcher. What else was he supposed to do? Watch as some old lady screamed at the man that stole her purse and shoved her into the hot dog cart that he and Connor were standing at? No. Fuck that.\n\nSo he chased. Connor's laughter chasing after him. Knowing in the back of his head that his brother was paying for their two hotdogs --his cooling on the street because the first thing he did was drop it and run-- and waiting. Letting him do this because that's Connor's way.\n\nIt should have been fine. He wasn't even going to kill the guy, just get the damn bag back fro the poor old lady who probably had all her pension check in there or something. Simple.\n\nBut now. Fucker had a gun. A gun that went off loud and harsh in the tight confines of the alley. And then pain and nothing else mattered. Not the guy running off, not the sound of him hitting his knees, the feel of concrete on his face when he falls onto it.\n\nFor a minute, a full fucking minute, he wasn't even sure where he was shot. Just pain and burning and thinking too many thoughts for a guy with a bullet in him. But then there were hands, strong hands that he knows better than his own, rolling him over. Onto his back in the trash covered alley. He looked up into Connor's eyes and realizes how fucking stupid it was. That this isn't how the hero's in the movies are supposed to die.\n\nStomach, he realizes. It really fucking hurts. Connor's pressing his hands to the wound, pressing tight.\n\n\"You stupid ass.\" Connor says, no anger, just love in his voice.\n\nHe tries for a smile, but it probably comes off weak. Reaches up his hand, touches his brother's face. Leaves a path of blood across Connor's face. His blood. It looks wrong.\n\nThe movies always get it wrong. Too much blood, or not enough blood. The guns going off too soon. People always saying good shit right before the croak.\n\nHe can't figure out what to say. There should be something, but it hurts and Connor looks so fucking scared.\n\nHe grabs Connor's hair, pulls him down so they're faces are inches apart. Connor's hands still on the bullet wound, tears making tracks through the blood trail on his face. Pulls closer and their lips are touching. Just slightly, then more, more than one should ever kiss there brother but he doesn't fucking care. Not right now. He thinks the kiss is enough to say what he can't say with words because he can't think of the words, not now, when he's bleeding and probably dying.\n\nConnor pulls back fast and slaps him. Hard. So hard he thinks it will leave a bruise if he lives to see another day.\n\n\"You fucking idiot. You are not dying.\"\n\nThere's so much faith in Connor's voice, in his eyes, that he knows he should believe him. It's just hard with the lead in his stomach.\n\n\"Well,\" He gasps out. \"Let's go. Cops.\" Talking hurts. A lot. Fuck giving out dying monologues. That's wrong too.\n\nConnor lets out a set of obscenities that make Murphy oddly proud, and then gets up. Murphy finds out then what hurts more than talking. Moving. Being lifted off the ground.\n\nHe has faith.\n\nBut there's people watching them. They've come to the end of the alley. Connor pushes through them, and the part and let them through. Murphy lets his head lean against Connor's shoulder, feels dizzy. Sick.\n\nThey get to the car. People still following behind. Shouting, all of them talking too fucking loud. Connor puts him in the passenger seat. He lets out a moan. His body feels cold where Connor was touching it.\n\nHe watches Connor run around the car and get in. Throws it into reverse and starts backing out. Slams the breaks and Murphy groans again. Connor puts a hand on his shoulder, apologetic.\n\n\"Who the fuck are you?\" Connor says, looking into the back seat.\n\nIt hurts, but Murphy turns to see a little girl, about fifteen years old, looking back at them.\n\n\"I know who you are. I know where you can get help. No problems.\"\n\nConnor looks at him, and he looks at Connor. Connor nods and speeds off through the parking lot. The girl gives directions quietly, no sense of panic. Connor's panicking enough for all three of them.\n\nMurphy lets his eyes close. The last thing he hears is Connor yelling at him to open his eyes. But it hurts and he can't keep them open anymore. He hopes Connor will understand.\n\n---\n\nIt confuses him at first. The sound of rapid fire Spanish and the dull warmth that's encased his whole body. Drugs, he thinks, dimly. You don't feel this way normally. Who drugged him?\n\nBut there's a hand in his that reminds him of everything that happened. A fucking purse snatcher.\n\nHe opens his eyes and stares into his brother's eyes. The relief that floods through them makes him force out a smile. Connor nods to someone he can't see, and a face floats into his view. Brown skin and smiling eyes.\n\n\"You feel better?\" The man asks, a slight accent to his voice.\n\nHe feels like someone kicked him in a stomach. Not the intense, burning pain of before. \"Good drugs, ya got.\"\n\nHe hears Connor laugh and smiles then, for real. Because, how bad can it be, if Connor's laughing?\n\n\"I still got all my parts, right?\" He asks, when the doctor moves away.\n\nConnor laughs again. \"Aye. Though I might just break your knees for that little trick.\"\n\nHe wants to fight back, to keep up the banter, but the warm drugged feeling is making it hard to keep his eyes open. One more question to ask. \"We're safe?\"\n\nConnor nods, looks down at their hands. Fingers entwined. \"That doctor knows who we are. He's going to keep it quiet.\"\n\nThere's something strange in his brother's eyes. Something strange he doesn't understand. \"What?\" Barely a word. Starting to hurt and he wants to go to sleep.\n\n\"His daughter. She was killed by a stray bullet, meant for some gang member.\"\n\nJust looks at Connor. Can't say anything more. The burning is back.\n\n\"She...\" Connor looks flustered. His fingers are playing with his cross. Unusually twitching for his usually calm brother. \"He showed me her picture. She was the girl in the car. The one who lead us here. I swear, same girl.\"\n\n\"Got someone lookin' out for us.\"\n\nConnor nods. \"Yes, we do. Now go back to sleep. I'll be here when you get up.\"\n\nMurphy feels a real, genuine smile. \"I know.\"\n\nThe last thing he thinks before drifting off to sleep is that this is a good ending. Art imitates life.\n\n---\n\nThe end."
