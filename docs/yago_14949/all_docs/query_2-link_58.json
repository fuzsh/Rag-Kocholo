        "text": "Throw caution to the wind and embark on a musical journey* through the lands of the Celts, as Murphy’s Pigs drags you headfirst into their world of rugged mountains, stormy oceans, fearsome battles, unrequited love and a dram or two of fine whisky.\n\nTheir unrehearsed style breathes new life into old favourites and firmly places their unique stamp on contemporary treasures ... and some not-too-shabby stuff they’ve written themselves. Mildly humorous onstage banter, an insane number of instruments and robust, manly voices unite to create an experience that will, unfortunately, be seared deep into your memory long after the performance is over. Boisterous chorus songs and lilting ballads compel thetone deaf to sing fervently while spirited jigs, reels and hornpipes spur the uncoordinated out onto the dance floor.\n\nOne minute you’re crying into your Guinness, the next minute you’re pouring it over your head with a hearty cheer. If you like singing your heart out, stamping your feet, dancing like a loon or just wallowing in guilt-free revelry, then this is one journey* you will want to take.\n\n*All journeys sold separately. Batteries not included.\n\nSpecial Guest Suellen Cusack\n\nSuellen Cusack is one of Queensland’s most popular classical crossover artists. Hailing from Bundaberg she is well known as a Celtic and classical crossover soprano who made her name touring Australia-wide, New York and Toronto in “Scotland the Brave”. She has performed alongside Marina Prior, performed as a soloist alongside Ireland's, The Celtic Tenors, and has been a backing vocalist for renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli. Her debut album, Whispers of Angels, went to No. 1 on the classical crossover charts, and she is currently in the process of recording her much anticipated new album, The Irish Song Book, featuring a duet with Damien Leith. Suellen will be joined on stage by violinist Kate Hardisty.\n\nDoors/Bar/Kiosk open from 1.30pm.\n\nPlease note this is a flat floor venue."
