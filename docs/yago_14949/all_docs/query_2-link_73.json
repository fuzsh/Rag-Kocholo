        "text": "There was just a situation where a Murphy bed collapsed on a guest about a week or so ago. They then told everyone in the resort not to use the beds until they were inspected. I believe they provided air mattresses or something.\n\nHowever, I think this was only at the newest resorts…perhaps an installation issue. I haven’t heard what the end result was of that. From what I saw, though, the value resorts weren’t impacted.\n\nAnyone have additional info?\n\nThat was the twin-sized hang off the wall (like at POFQ, CBR, and maybe some other places - so it is not like they don’t know how to do it). The ones at the AllStars are like the ones at Pop and more stable. They don’t hang.\n\nThey shut down the queen beds over the sofas in the refurbed rooms at SSR and Riviera Tower rooms. At the Riviera that is the only bed in the room! I heard Len on a couple of podcasts reviewing the Riviera and I think he described the Tower rooms as the “worse rooms on property”. Imagine a room that cost between $350-600 a night and not even having a bed? I think they fixed them quickly!"
