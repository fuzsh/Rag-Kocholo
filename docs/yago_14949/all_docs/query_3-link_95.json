The list includes only those products with which the bureau has established experience and expertise. New technology, new products recently brought to market, and products not previously used by the City of Portland will not be reviewed under this process.\n\nPurpose of CPL\n\nWhile many construction product submittals are project- or site-specific, there are a number of standard materials or products that can be approved for use without reviewing redundant product information. The CPL was developed from reviews of typical products and manufacturers used on projects over a prolonged period of time and approved by Environmental Services for continued use on future projects.\n\nThese four agency-approved product lists make up the CPL:\n\nEnvironmental Services CPL (on this page above)\n\nPortland Water Bureau Construction Products List\n\nPortland Bureau of Transportation Construction Products List\n\nOregon Department of Transportation Qualified Products List\n\nProducts are organized numerically by specification section as defined in the City of Portland Standard Specifications (2020). The Environmental Services list includes links to the product information and specifications. These links can be used by all City staff and the contracting community. If a product is on the PBOT and/or ODOT lists, then it is not included on the Environmental Services CPL.\n\nHow to Use the CPL\n\nEnvironmental Services designers, construction managers, construction technicians, inspectors, and contractors use the CPL to find approved products for Environmental Services infrastructure projects.\n\nIf a product is on the CPL, the contractor must submit a submittal for the product in HERON. In the submittal, the contractor should include the product name and list from which it came. It is not necessary to include complete product information. Choosing a product from the CPL does not alleviate contractors from their responsibility to follow the requirements of the contract.\n\nIf a product requires testing before it can be approved for use on a project, then it is not included on the CPL, and a standard construction submittal in HERON is required.\n\nUse of all other products and \"or approved equal\" products not included on the CPL requires a standard construction submittal in HERON for review and approval.\n\nWhen applicable, the CPL will also indicate products that have been rejected from the list and the reason for the rejection.\n\nAdding New Products to the CPL\n\nEnvironmental Services staff, product manufacturers/distributors, and contractors can request to add commonly used products to the CPL. Environmental Services has a Review Committee, chaired by a representative from the bureau's Engineering group, which reviews all products submitted for inclusion on the CPL. Find instructions and application below for how to submit a product for consideration. Pertinent, current product information must be included as part of the application process.\n\nProduct information will be reviewed to determine if a product will be included on, or excluded from, the Environmental Services CPL. The Review Committee meets every six months to make a determination regarding each product submitted.\n\nUpdate and Maintenance of the CPL\n\nThe Environmental Services CPL is updated and maintained by the CPL Review Committee Chair and a Technician. The list will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the product links provided are fully functional.\n\nHow To Submit a Product for Consideration for the Environmental Services Construction Products List\n\nIf you would like to submit a commonly-used construction product for consideration for the CPL, download and complete the Product Application Form below. Email completed forms to the Environmental Services Construction Product List Steward. Contact information is on this page."
