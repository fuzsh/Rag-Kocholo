        "text": "Admittedly, Pat Murphy’s ties to the Padres aren’t all that many these days.\n\nBut there is that one: The team that employed the Brewers’ current manager from 2010 (in the minors) through the end of the 2015 season (in the majors) signed his son, Kai, as an undrafted free agent in July 2022 and has pushed him to high Single-A Fort Wayne this year.\n\n“I watch every at-bat,” the elder Murphy said with a smile this week.\n\nAs in through MiLB.TV.\n\nOf course, each spring the Padres seemingly put Kai on the bus to Maryvale every time they play at the Brewers’ complex or in the lineup in Peoria.\n\nNine years ago, the younger Murphy was along for the ride for much of the summer as his dad was called up to the majors to replace the fired Bud Black.\n\nKai Murphy went on to play college ball at Oregon State and later at his dad’s old program at Arizona State. The Padres were among the teams scouting Kai for the 2022 draft, connected with him quickly after he went undrafted and pushed him to low Single-A Lake Elsinore that first summer.\n\nIt was in the California Lague that Kai Murphy first teamed with Jackson Merrill, the Padres’ current center fielder.\n\n“The Padres have been unbelievable to him,” Pat Murphy said. “I mean, he raves about their organization and how they treat their minor leaguers. He’s close with Jackson. He’s close with (Graham) Pauley. He was close with (Jakob) Marsee.\n\n“For him, it’s a home.”\n\nThe 23-year-old Murphy is hitting .229/.328/.343 with three homers, 27 RBIs and seven steals in 58 games with the TinCaps.\n\nFriday’s scoreboard\n\nTRIPLE-A EL PASO (30-43)\n\nSugar Land 3, Chihuahuas 0: RHP Glenn Otto (0-2, 9.00 ERA) allowed two runs in an inning in the start. RHP Lake Bachar (3.73 ERA) closed the game with two shutout innings. 1B Kevin Plawecki (.710 OPS) went 3-for-3 with a double.\n\nDOUBLE-A SAN ANTONIO (30-36)\n\nAmarillo 10, Missions 2: LHP Robby Snelling (1-7, 5.92 ERA) allowed five home runs and nine runs in 5⅓ innings in the loss. 1B Robbie Tenerowicz (.757 OPS) drove in two runs on his sixth homer.\n\nHIGH SINGLE-A FORT WAYNE (29-38)\n\nTinCaps 5, Wisconsin 4: LF Joshua Mears (.720 OPS) drove in three runs, including two on a walk-off homer for his third of the season. CF Homer Bush Jr. (.691 OPS) hit his second homer. DH Ethan Salas (.604 OPS) went 2-for-3 with a double and a walk. RHP Henry Baez (3.74 ERA) allowed two runs — one earned — in five innings in the start.\n\nLOW SINGLE-A LAKE ELSINORE (32-33)\n\nVisalia 11, Storm 10 (14): INF Wyatt Hoffman (0-1, 5.79 ERA) allowed five runs — two earned — over the final 2 ⅓ innings to take the loss. C Jacob Campbell (.840 OPS) drove in three runs on three hits, including his fourth homer. CF Nick Vogt (.714 OPS) drove in three runs on two hits, including his third homer. SS Leodalis De Vries (.634 OPS) went 0-for-5 with two walks and two runs scored. De Vries stole his fifth base and Vogt swiped his 16th.\n\nROOKIE ACL PADRES (16-20)\n\nRangers 8, Padres 1 (7): RHP Abraham Parra (0-2, 9.00 ERA) allowed six runs in 3 ⅓ innings in the loss. CF Spence Coffman (.771 OPS) went 2-for-3 and SS B.Y. Choi (.809 OPS) went 1-for-3 with an RBI. 2B Ismael Javier (.612 OPS) went 1-for-2 with a double, a walk and a run scored.\n\nROOKIE DSL BROWN (1-11)\n\nReds 19, Padres 2 (7): DH Jason Hernandez (.875 OPS) went 2-for-3 with a double and two runs scored. RF Jesmaylin Arias (.881 OPS) went 1-for-2 with a double, an RBI and a walk.\n\nROOKIE DSL GOLD (8-5)\n\nPadres 19, Reds 7: Padres hitters walked three times in the game against collecting just seven hits. 1B Yoiber Ocopio (1.005 OPS) went 1-for-2 with a triple, an RBI and three walks."
