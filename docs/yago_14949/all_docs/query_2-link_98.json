        "text": "Last updated: 13th August 2024\n\nOur Terms of sale were designed to treat both Customers and Vendors (including Professional Vendors and Non-Professional Vendors (as defined in the Site Terms)) fairly, in order to make the shopping/selling experience with Vinterior just as exceptional as the items.\n\nTo protect our Customers from disappointment or the unexpected, we strongly encourage them to closely inspect item photos, descriptions, and details before purchasing anything on the Site, and then again upon delivery or pickup.\n\nIf the Customer is unsure about an item's condition, dimensions, quantity, or description, they can send their questions to the item's Vendor by clicking on Ask the seller on the listing page of the Site.\n\nCustomers shall receive the same level of consumer protection on purchases irrespective of whether they are buying from a Professional Vendor or Non-Professional Vendor.\n\nShould you have any questions regarding your transaction, please contact the Vendor in the first instance.\n\nCan I cancel an order?\n\nIf a Customer changes their mind or decides for any other reason not to purchase the Goods before they have been dispatched, they can cancel the order on the Site and receive a refund.\n\nThe right to cancel does not apply to the following types of goods, which are non-refundable: items that are personalised, bespoke, or made-to-order according to the customer's specific requirements. If in doubt, the Customer can contact the Vendor via the Site.\n\nIf the Customer cancels an order after an item has already been marked as dispatched for delivery, the delivery costs are non-refundable.\n\nTo cancel the order, the Customer must follow the cancellation procedure on the Site by clicking on Create Cancellation on the order page.\n\nCan I return an item?\n\nAll items at Vinterior are special and unique, and we understand that once they are at the Customer's place, they might not fit the space or just donâ€™t feel right. This is why we offer a market-leading 100-day returns policy for purchases from Professional sellers after goods have been received by customers based in the UK and European Union. This means Vinterior customers can return their items for any reason up to 100 days from the day they were received.\n\nIf purchased from an Individual seller, a 14-day return policy applies from the day it was received.\n\nTypes of returns and responsibilities\n\nChange of mind return\n\nConsumers can return the goods due to a change of mind. Once a return is requested, the buyer is in charge of shipping the goods back to the seller and should organise it as soon as possible. Shipment costs to and from buyers are non-refundable.\n\nItem not fit for purpose\n\nActing under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, customers may return faulty Goods that are damaged or the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate, misleading, or misrepresents the Goods. In these cases, the Customer must provide photographic evidence to Vinterior and the Vendor or reject the delivery on arrival.\n\nDamage in transit\n\nVinterior must be informed of any damage in transit. If Proovia delivered the items, Vinterior will then raise an insurance claim on behalf of the Vendor with the delivery company. If the seller organised a delivery, they would be asked to raise a claim with their courier. Once the claim is resolved and any relevant decision regarding the insurance has been made, any applicable refunds will be processed.\n\nHow to request a return\n\nTo initiate a return the customer needs to log in to their Vinterior account and click Create a return on the order page. In the return request, the reason for the return must be included along with photos of any damage of the Goods, if faulty.\n\nHow you will be refunded?\n\nOnce the item is returned to the Vendor in the same condition, the Vendor will confirm receipt of the item, and Vinterior will refund the original payment method.\n\nIf an item is returned to the seller damaged or in an unsuitable condition, Vinterior will not be able to process the refund, and the seller may have to send it back (and ask you to cover the delivery costs). All items are inspected on return.\n\nWhat can't be returned?\n\nAs with cancellations, the right to return an item does not apply to the following types of Goods, which are non-refundable: items that are personalised, bespoke or made-to-order to the Customer's specific requirements.\n\nPlease note that vintage items are not sold as new and are likely to show signs of wear and tear. This is not sufficient grounds for a refund.\n\nVendors may refuse a return of an item if the Customer has altered it in any way.\n\nNeither Vinterior nor the Vendors are liable for any damages or loss sustained in transit via third parties."
