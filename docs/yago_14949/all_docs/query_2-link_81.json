        "text": "Purpose: Paraneoplastic neurologic disease (PND) is an aberrant immune-mediated response against the nervous system triggered by malignancy. Given the rarity, a paucity of data describing breast cancer-related PND (BC-PND) exists; we sought to further examine this specific patient population.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively identified patients at our institution from 1997 to 2016 with BC-PND. Retrospective review with a descriptive analysis determined factors associated with PND and BC, which were compared to national breast cancer median of age (61 years) and average stage at diagnosis (60% local disease).\n\nResults: BC-PND was diagnosed in 56 female patients at a median age of 52.8 years. Only 20% of invasive cancer patients had local disease. The majority of patients were hormone receptor positive and Her2 negative. Neurological symptoms presented prior to BC diagnosis in 57.1% of patients. Of all patients, 30 (53.6%) had autoantibodies detected: Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibody Type-1 (PCA-1[anti-Yo]), n = 10; amphiphysin-IgG, n = 9; Anti-Neuronal Nuclear Autoantibody Type-2 (ANNA-2[anti-Ri]), n = 5; and others, n = 6. The most common neurologic findings were cerebellar ataxia, myelopathy, and myopathy. Immunotherapy benefit was found to be robust (21.6%), mild to moderate (52.9%), absent (17.6%), or indeterminate (7.8%)."
