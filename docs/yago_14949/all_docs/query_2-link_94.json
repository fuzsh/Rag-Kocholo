        "text": "The Falcons acquired wide receiver Rondale Moore from the Cardinals in an offseason trade that sent quarterback Desmond Ridder to Arizona. Moore averaged roughly 400 yards per season over his three years with the Cardinals but, like Ridder, needed a fresh start. The former second-round pick was on track to play a key role in Atlanta before suffering a season-ending knee injury during joint practices against the Dolphins.\n\nWith Moore out for the year, the team will need someone to replace the young receiver. Will it be someone currently on the roster or a potential free agent? The biggest hurdle for the Falcons is their lack of salary cap space, with just north of $3 million available. Here's a look at five possible replacements for Moore in 2024.\n\n1. Hunter Renfrow\n\nHunter Renfrow has had an up-and-down NFL career. In his first two seasons, he established himself as a crucial slot receiver for the Raiders' passing attack before posting career-high numbers in Year 3. Renfrow was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2021 after posting an 80 percent catch rate and amassing 1,000 yards for the only time in his career. However, Renfrow's career took a massive step back over the past two seasons. Renfrow went from having 51 first-down catches in 2021 to just 18 in 2022 and 11 in 2023. If he's not too expensive, Renfrow would make sense.\n\n2. Michael Thomas\n\nA move for Michael Thomas would be off-putting to both Falcons and Saints fans due to how many times the receiver has burned Atlanta through the years. However, Thomas is currently out of a job and has bad blood with the Saints organization, so it's within the realm of possibility. After all, he wouldn't be the first player to make the switch and he used to be one of the best receivers in the league. Thomas would likely command a salary higher than Atlanta can afford without moving someone else to create the cap space. Would that be too much to spend replacing the team's third/fourth wide receiver?\n\n3. DeVante Parker\n\nDeVante Parker spent his first seven seasons in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins and his last two seasons with the New England Patriots. While he's currently retired, Parker could be intrigued by the situation in Atlanta. He did temporarily sign with the Eagles before changing his mind. During his nine-year NFL career, Parker only amassed 1,000 yards once back in 2019. Since then, Parker's production has been on a steady decline. Still, the veteran wideout is a potentially cheap option that could add quality depth.\n\n4. Julio Jones\n\nJulio Jones and the Falcons went through a very public breakup back in 2021 and the relationship seems to have soured ever since. However, since leaving, Jones hasn't done much, if anything, to improve his stock and would be an affordable option. Playing with Kirk Cousins would bring out the best in the former All-Pro. Since leaving, Jones recorded 424 yards with Tennessee in 2021, 299 the following year in Tampa Bay, and then 74 yards last season with Philadelphia. Those combined totals barely eclipse the 771 yards he had with the Falcons in 2020.\n\n5. Casey Washington\n\nCasey Washington was selected by the Falcons in the sixth round of this yearâ€™s draft and is a player to watch for the duration of this preseason. Even before Moore went down with his knee injury, Washington was already turning heads and pushing for the fourth receiver role behind Drake London, Darnell Mooney, and Ray-Ray McCloud. With Moore now down for the season, the spot is there for Washington to take. The rookie was technically listed as Moore's backup on the team's first preseason depth chart. The next few weeks will be crucial for Washington, but he should be ready for the challenge.\n\nMore Latest Falcons News!\n\nFalcons vs. Dolphins: How to watch Friday's preseason opener\n\nFalcons 90-man roster: Ryan Sanborn in, Rondale Moore to IR\n\nFalcons WR Rondale Moore placed on IR with knee injury\n\nFalcons DL Ruke Orhorhoro among players to watch in preseason opener\n\nNFL.com lists Falcons near the bottom of latest power rankings"
