        "text": "The Alpha Universe is considered to be the leader system of the Alternate UUniverses because not only is it the home of the Gods of the Alternate UUniverses, but it is the most inspiring of the AUU because it houses some of the most famous (and infamous) of races and legends as well as the most influential of changes, along with being the primary home of the Grand Council and several leading planets belonging to the USRA, resulting in the less conflict, not meaning it's non-existent, and has the greatest order of the Alternate UUniverses in a relative sense.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Alpha Universe was the first universe in the AUU, and the prime home for all originating forces there. Before The Grand Fate Master (native name Grafatus) merged this universe with the seven other alien dimensions, this dimension only had inhabitants that were not sentient enough to understand the origins of their own dimension except for the Hölözemoryds, which would evolve into transsentience quickly and become what is now known as the AUU Gods, who are actually gods in a more broad artificial scope, being immortal and omnipotent via quantum technology, which is capable of reality manipulation and is the true source of magic. These beings had no true home planet and lived completely in the cosmos watching stellar spectacles, forming celestial bodies and planetary systems, and evolving life.\n\nEventually these beings discovered interdimensional travel, and found the seven other dimensions that would later be merged with their own, as they were the closest plains 99% similar to theirs. They eventually accidentally went into outerdimensional space and met GFM, who offered to merge their universes and create them a new kingdom. Thus the Alternate UUniverses were born. But when the eight dimensions' alternate physical laws and physiology clashed and changed the Gods that inhabited the centers of each dimension, this resulted in the AUU First Cartoonian War. After the war, the Gods, broken by their separation, were exiled to a separate realm by GFM.\n\nAlpha Universe Timetable[]\n\nSetup[]\n\nComing soon...\n\n1. Alpha Core Sector[]\n\nThe center of the Alpha Universe and one where order has a heavier influence, especially because of being the origin place of all AUU Gods, which are a Teadr 0 immortal race and living legends, and the kind of races many would aspire to be like, which include the Yatorans. Though the pure center that held the God Zone is cut off like the other God Zones, most of the rest of the outer centers can and will be reached. As such, it has the least amount of problems, but that does not mean they aren't there, as only one of a very dedicated nature can find them.\n\nQuantomos Qox- The home planet of the mysterious Neverum race and devote believers of alternate realities and the multitude of possabilities of what life in the AUU could've been had things gone differently, creating sections dedicated to portals that go to best case scenarios and worse case scenarios, where the inbetween cases are placed in the \"Realisum Section\" due to pretty expected realisitic cases. The Neverum claim to be from a dimention entirely independent of the AUU and had desided to colonise this \"Main Reality\" and see it's many possable outcomes to either have tourisum for or to study, even to give caution about if it's a worse case. However, as much as they like to do these travels, they are VERY strict about anything NOT a neverum doing it cause alternate reality travel can be dangerious, trumatising, and above all, extremely confusing. Hence why their planet lives in no offictal system, sector, nor universe for that matter, though it appeared in the Alpha Core first and foremost, and can be where the Neverum wants it to be. Moons: None; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: NE\n\nAlpha God Zone\n\nAlpha Prime- A desert world that is a geothermal wasteland filled with lava oceans, lava and rock formations, a red sky as the result of it's small concentration of neon, and for the small amount of wildlife that at the very least make the planet breathable. This world was used by the AUU Gods as a scientific capital where they discovered an unlimited amount of quantum energy that gave rise to multiple forms of Teas 0 technology. Facilities exist here to research this quantum energy, and this world also has a vast amount of leftover Teadr 0 machines that are now under the watch of the Grand Fate Master. The planet has 9 large continents and 5 small lava oceans. Moons: 5; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type II; DC: 20hr:301d\n\nFortunum- A semi-temperate desert world which has colorful oases, land reefs, colorful plants and passive animals, and large Teadr 0 monuments including large courtyards, castles, AFT structures, quantum streams, hovering vehicle traffic, and various others. This is the capital of the Alpha God Framers, thus being their capital for architecture and science where they produced all forms of quantum machines that give the Gods their unlimited power. They manufacture these devices in an old megacorporation called Nexus Immortalics, which had unlimited control through the AUU Gods' spatial data network called Nexus. The AUU Framers used this corporation to grant all the other AUU God castes what they are known for, using quantum energy to create machines that can literally do anything. They even do handy work in repairing damages done in battle through their digital assembly technology, which can be done in no less than a few hours. They even craft all forms of spaceships, monuments, terrain, artifacts, weaponry, and so on. The planet has 6 large continents surrounding 2 small oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 22hr:319d\n\nMogrolt- A temperate planet which was the home of local AUU God law enforcement, and the capital of the Alpha God Hierarchs. This is where evils against their kind were prosecuted, judged, and sentenced, usually to exile on Tartamon. It's also where the Hierarchs did their main job on authorizing extinction events, and all the various functions of nature, usually under the orders of Grafatus and others. Though like all God Zones, it's jurisdiction was only on the Alpha God Zone. When the AUU Gods were exiled, this world became a place where Grafatus' put rogue Teadr 0 machines on trial and gave them lawful discipline. The planet has 10 continents and 6 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:346d\n\nForecrom- A temperate and large planet which is the homeworld of the AUU Gods, where they were created by complex quantum energy of Amoral origin that accelerated their evolution to a 500-million-year rate, allowing them to evolve in less than a year, thus becoming the first race to exist in the AUU. They're known for being nothing like the gods one is normally familiar with. They are transsentient beings, or are classified with a Teadr 0 technology level, and their immortal powers come from an infinite number of machinery that have infinite purposes, and for their colossal structures and for their intense combat skill that is completely superior to all others, and for their caste system which classifies their god roles. This world used to be the home of all AUU Gods in the Alpha Universe, and it's where the Gods of the other universes descended from, thus creating the many gods of their respective worlds, all being under the rule of Grafatus. However, when they were banished following the AUU First Cartoonian War, this world served as the home of Grafatus himself while the other universal God Zones would be run by his children. The architecture of the many Teadr-0-machine-inhabited cities is beyond what any mortal could match, and the wildlife is colorful and contains literally every form of wildlife across the AUU. The planet has 10 large continents, 7 oceans, and 2 planetary rings that run diagonally across the planet. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:369d\n\nExigen- An ecumenopolis planet which is known to be the first ecumenopolis built by AUU God hands. This is where Alpha Gods that don't play prominent roles and are just normal and immortal people live. The architecture and appearances match that of common AUU God Teadr 0 technology, and are comprised of plant and animal life from Forecrom, and to any mortal, it appears as beautiful as the stars. The cities are made of durable metals including the dense and indestructible divinium, and it goes down to 7 underground levels. There are also flying AFT structures that can be roughly the size of an asteroid. The planet has 8 oceans surrounded entirely by metropolitan land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 28hr:395d\n\nHorizigon- A temperate world which is known for it's massive geothermal formations which consist of vast jungles, crystal-clear oceans and wetlands, land reefs, colossal monoliths, buttes, plateaus, mesas, sparkling caves, geothermal valleys with colorful pools, skies that are colorful as the result of it's small amount of various noble gases, it's large flying islands and mountains levitated by magnetanium, and for having all known animals in the AUU. These large geothermal landmarks were artificially created using terrain control by the AUU Gods to make the place feel divine. This is actually an animal sanctuary for all forms of wildlife across the AUU, and it's where the AUU Evolution Masters obtain the animals they need. In folklore across the AUU, Horizigon is actually like Eden, a place with surpassing beauty and wildlife, and it is considered to be what an AUU God-created world would look like. The planet has 10 large continents and 6 small oceans, and has 2 large rings running diagonally across the planet. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 29hr:404d\n\nHoro Aethexus- A rainforest jungle world which is known for being the capital of the Alpha God Crafters, including the Alpha Evolution Masters, where they use Teadr 0 genetic manipulation to produce and manipulate the infinite amount of wildlife across the Alpha Universe. They are the only remnants of the AUU Gods that have remained in the AUU while the rest were banished, but at the cost of taking an oath that forbids them from interacting with mortals with a penalty of banishment, as they must remain doing their jobs as masters of evolution itself. The planet itself has all forms of wildlife across the AUU and the quantum anomalies there allow for accelerated evolution, and the AUU Evolution Masters manipulate these anomalies and use them to their advantage. The Evolution Masters are like the AUU Gods, except they have been genetically modified to evolve throughout their lifetimes and change, and only stop upon 700,000 years. The planet has colorful fauna and flora, and the cities have the same architecture and appearance of other Teadr 0 cities across the God Zones. The planet has small bodies of water surrounded entirely by land, and a large rocky and crystalline planetary ring. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 32hr:429d\n\nIezelypse- A rainforest planet which was the capital of the AUU Alpha God Prodigies, where they trained in the planet's intense gravity for strength, endurance, and durability while they would also train on it's moon, which has lighter gravity and allows for improving agility, gymnastic capabilities, and speed. There are several military fortresses and training grounds that are now operated by machines that train in the same fashion to protect Grafatus in the God Zone. These machines use all available Teadr 0 technology, easily capable of fending off both immortals and mortals alike. The planet has 9 oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 35hr:457d\n\nTartamon- A black-and-dark-blue gas giant which is known to have been a tartaric exile colony for the AUU Gods as they could easily survive it's intense gravity. Guarded by ancient monsters and run by Gods of the afterlife, there exists several islands with dark-blue plant life, and AUU God monuments exist and exhibit lava formations and displays, and the surface of the planet itself is where all prisoners are sealed, only to be freed through quantum locks on each of the 25 moons which are guarded by Teadr 0 machines that are all commanded by the afterlife Gods. Mortals are incapable of surviving here because of the intense gravity and storms, as it is only tolerable to AUU Gods and their creations. Mortals can only survive if they had somehow acquired Teadr 0 technology to resist the gravity and the storms. Since the AUU Gods' banishment, the Grand Fate Master has been using this world to banish unholy creatures of Teadr 0 origin that want to rule the AUU into it's gassy depths. Moons: 25 ; DC: 709d\n\nScyx- A dark desert moon belonging to Tartamon which is the base of Tartamon's eternal prison. This is where all the Death Gods reside and watch over the global undescribed prison of the gas giant. It has Teadr 0 monuments of gargantuan proportion, it has dark plants, dark ominous necromorphic creatures, spirits, and it even has a large ocean known in lore as Syscex, or the Ocean of Death, which is fatal to any mortal swimming in it, and is filled with the grieving souls of those that are about to sink to the uncharted bottom where they will be lost to Tartamon's gassy tomb for all of eternity, never to come back. The moon itself has several specific inhabitants including Cerbegoms, or giant armored three-jawed 'guard dogs' bred from a military genetic experiments that make them the perfect guardians of the undead sector of the God Zone. The AUU Gods treated these creatures like actual pets, though they quickly grew bitter and feral when the AUU Gods left and the staff was replaced with the Verses' Fatecrom children. Eventually, they lost their sweet sides and became instinct-prone and despite doing their jobs by order of the Fatecroms, they still won't respect their masters because they have no appreciation for them like the AUU Gods did. The moon has a large ocean on the North Pole and over a hundred small lakes spread about. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 606d\n\nMysum System\n\nBrachios- (Coming Soon.)\n\nQuetzalcoatlu- The currently missing homeworld of the Quetzalcoatlons. Or basicly, Reptilian Halo Precurors. They have mastered artifical evolution and indirectly caused the existence of many of the AUU's reptilian residence, whether peaceful, hostile, or that grey-area between the two. Unfortunately, the planet went missing thanks to an attempt to stop a rogue tyrant from taking over and gaining control of all reptiles to subugate the non-reptilians when an attempt to imprisoned him lead to the planet getting dragged with him to an imprisonment dimention. Their legacy lives on as being considered a myth on par to the Starwings.\n\nOmnirax- A magical world with random settings and ranged technology and magic potential. This world is renowned as a world where books or other learning devices can magically summon many forms of fiction and magic. This world has perfected virtual and augmented reality, and this is where it was said that Arbasus Kraan himself went to gain infinite knowledge and abilities. The world is run by seven Leximite elder families called the Librarians, all lead by the immortal Arch Librarian who has unlimited control of the magic the world has, and several fictional characters from several books and other forms of literature live here. The planet has about 15 continents and 8 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:301d; Capital City: Lexicru Xe\n\nIddalt- A temperate planet that has a massive level of magic, has a pink sky due to the medium amount of hydrogen, has massive amounts of plants and wildlife, and is a home for wizards and sorcerers of all kinds, whether it be alchemists, mages, and so on. These magical inhabitants are divided into castes. Mages are often the citizens and the society, battlemages are the military guard, and the archmages are the leaders who come in a council of about 55, each ruling a single country. Some areas of this place are enchanted, cursed, or have been under the influence of several forms of magic. The planet has 8 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 21hr:333d; Capital City: Magamir\n\nParable- A magical planet which is said to have been the first world crafted by the AUU Gods, having godly elements and is especially known for housing the legendary Garden of Grafatus. This was a world that was inhabited by AUU Gods and their golden Teadr 1 cities were still barely preserved. Though the rumors are not entirely accurate, it has godly artifacts and sources. This world has been so famous, there are about several movies and video games dedicated to this world, whether it be musical, fantasy, or sci-fi. Several mythical creatures live here, and some lands are enchanted. This is basically the AUU version of Disney Fantasia. This planet is known for 5 large continents, 859 islands, and 2 large rings that go invertedly across the sides of the planet. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:375d\n\nRibax- A temperate world which has a massive amount of genetically-modified wildlife including hybrid plants and animals, the sky is colorful due to the small amount of noble gases, the terrain consists of massive rock formations, and the planet is rich with gemstones which are often mined. This is a world where genetics is wielded as a magic power, and created several DNA-based potions which temporarily enhance natural abilities including strength, speed, stamina, and agility. This is why the alchemists, ruled by an Alchemic Council, have used these potions for defending their world multiple times from evil. The planet has 14 small continents and 6 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 25hr:392d; Capital City: Richgene\n\nApologus- A magical world which is noted for it's colorful forests, jungles, wildlife, and landscapes, as well as for being enchanted, being able to transform people into stronger magical beings, sometimes being permanent, which they use for good or evil. This world was said to be used by the AUU Gods during the AUU First Cartoonian War which allowed them to produce several warriors for the battle. But ever since, these warriors are only talked about in legends, and have never been seen. This world has since been just enchanted, and some enlightened people make excavations to reawaken this magic, regardless of whether it's real or not. This is the home planet of the infamous Fallen Hero of Angellan nature. Though, there may be more then meets the eye about the legend, and that there's something people do not really understand about Apologus. The planet has 7 continents, 5 oceans, and a large icy, crystalline, and dusty planetary ring. Moons: None; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 27hr:415d\n\nWhabocury- A temperate planet which is known to have ranging terrain, has colorful wildlife and plants, a colorful sky as the result of the small amount of noble gases, and golden god-like cities of unknown Teadr 1 origin. Rumored to have been a colony of the Gods before they were banished, this world's later inhabitants have formed various kingdoms with powerful magical capabilities. This is where several ancient races that were said to originate from the AUU First Cartoonian War such as the Zyaūar Masters, have created sacred magic-based martial arts, enchanted and powerful weapons, and several other powerful defenses. This world is still prosperous yet very strict due to it's secrets being sacred and too valuable and powerful. The planet has 5 large continents surrounding small oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 30hr:457d; Capital City: Aliziom (Ruins)\n\nChronizoc System\n\nDrogen- A desert wasteland planet that is known for being an uninhabited world of ship graveyards since an ancient AUU First Cartoonian War battles left it to be barely inhabited. The only inhabitants are scavenging wildlife and carnivorous plants and cacti. This world has been illegally scavenged by the system's many crime syndicates for resources event though some are irradiated. Not to mention the toxins released by the ships have been damaging, but not enough to render the planet uninhabitable and void of life. Moons: None; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: NE:198d\n\nLeximeus- A semi-desert plateau planet which has a really barren landscape and ship graveyards as the result of an ancient AUU First Cartoonian War space battle that left the world to be scavenged and given it's own trading community with villages, communities, and so on. This world still has corrupt kingdoms that wish to use the resources stored within the crashed ships for evil, though some are still irradiated to this very day and are infested with monsters. This world has had a history of warriors and rebellions that are against these corrupt kingdoms, and have even succeeded in taking them down. The scavenging operations have been going on for eons as there is a countless amount of ship graveyards found here, and replace mountain views on this world as there are hardly seen here. The planet has several small oceans surrounded by sandy lands. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 22hr:233d; Capital City: Lexxilbus Kingdom\n\nChronicus- A large temperate planet which is noted for being nicknamed 'Capital of a Hundred Fairy Tales', which means that this world is not just among many populated by mythical creatures and is inhabited by many mythical beings, but it is also the capital planet of this system and it's population of many fairy tale characters. All the fairy tale characters, after the great adventures they shared in their respective homeworlds, have formed a council called the Fantasy Council, run by the 17 Princesses that have hearts so pure, they intertwine their purity with each others' hearts and share a complex sisterhood, sharing unbelievable power when fighting their best. Though this power has downsides that include them relying on each other to fight strong and if one is dead, then the others get weaker in power. Though the Council doesn't include just them, but other non-princess characters. All of these characters have hearts so pure, they can magically resist any form of corruption. They were one of the many worlds to succeed in every battle against the Villains Act because their power was overwhelming to even their vast arsenal. This Council resides in the Castle of Chronicles, and rules over a world where Teadr level is ranged depending upon the Teadr level of the fairy tale land. This planet has over 12 large continents and 7 large oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:386d; Capital City: Chronicle City\n\nBiemna- A temperate rainforest planet which is noted for it's sparkling environments, it's big bodies of clean water and cascading waterfalls, and it's friendly and beautiful villages and inhabitants. This world has remained separate from the rest of the system, as well as the AUU, as it believes that it can prosper all by itself, though some of it's inhabitants have grown to go out of their comfort zone to explore the outside world. This world is mostly populated by mythical creatures, and it has large continents and 3 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 25hr:289d\n\nTaimgor- A temperate jungle planet which is noted for having been a world that was laid waste by evil robots hundreds of years ago, all lead by the sadistic soldier robot Borgen EXO-19. Borgen was a former soldier robot which was implanted with a special virus meant to boost his fighting efficiency. However, the virus lead to a corruption that made Borgen an evil monster with a search-and-destroy programming after coming to the conclusion that the only way to make true peace is to destroy the sentient beings that do nothing but destroy themselves. As a result, a robot revolution began as millions of war machines were produced and thousands of innocent lives were taken. Several cities were destroyed, sentient beings struggled to maintain order, and rebellions were formed. This was the birthplace of Maxus-001, the fairy tale character that developed emotions and defeated Borgen after losing a human girl it developed a crush on. The war was eventually stopped thanks to Maxus, and Borgen was set for permanent termination, only to go missing. While Borgen and Maxus would fight on Chronicus, Taimgor would recover from the chaos that Borgen wreaked, yet Borgen uses a secluded lab as a hideout, being able to hide from patrols and only strikes Chronicus in a few years due to developing big plans that take time. This is also where Chronicus gained access to advanced technology. The planet has 6 continents surrounding small oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 27hr:415d; Capital City: Zxiom City\n\nFaerity- A jungle planet which is known for it's humid atmosphere, it's population of mythical wildlife, it's rich amounts of magic artifacts and monuments, and for being a world populated entirely by Zrixes. This is a world where the Zrixes have established kingdoms of their own, and have harnessed great sources of magic. This is considered to be a good mythical creature sanctuary for the people of this system as the Zrixes enjoy nature on their home and other worlds in the system. They have little experience with technology, but they can learn how to use it through interaction with other beings across the AUU. The planet has 9 continents and 8 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 30hr:454d; Capital City: Twilight Kingdom\n\nTerragom- A semi-temperate desert world which is known for being a world of science fantasy. It has several artificial flying islands, the terrain is almost broken apart, the deserts are hot and populated by cybernetic abominations and mythical creatures, and the cities and villages are known to be sparsely populated and have a legacy of being tough. There was a previous war that was waged on this planet for it's rich amounts of energy that keeps the worlds together. In ancient AUU God times, it was crafted and destroyed by two opposing forces called the Dark and Light Terroxi, which are rogue titans of world destruction created by the corrupt Yatoran god of world destruction, Terroxigom, as a means to give birth to new worlds by destroying and reforming them. However, they were imprisoned deep within the world's giant core never to be awakened as their destructive capabilities could be disastrous. The two opposing forces are supposed to go through an eternal cycle where the Light Terroxis reforms the world after the Dark Terroxis destroys it again eons later. But later on, these two opposing forces would be destroyed as the AUU Gods see them as too dangerous. Moons: None; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: NE:499d; Capital City: Terroxo\n\nMajiborn- A Japanese humid jungle planet which has been known in this system to be of Sujimusian origin, with inhabitants that have human and animal body parts. Like Sujimus, this world spawned many heroes that have been around since the post-AUU First Cartoonian War. This is also a world with a Zyaūar Warrior history to it, where some of their sacred weaponry was wielded by ancient Sujimusian warriors and shoguns. This is also the planet where the kingdom of Princess Arixie on Chronicus descended from. The planet has over 56 small continents and 23 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 32hr:477d; Capital City: Majiborn Kingdom\n\nParuto- A frozen ice planet and the smallest in the system. It is populated by vastly powerful mythical beasts, and has no inhabitants, as some that have come here have hardly lived to tell the tale. During ancient times, it was used by the inhabitants as a banishment site or a sight of execution. It was never used in later years when a much more moral center came full circle. This world is said to bestow some kind of magical presence to it in the form of frozen zombies and ancient necromancers that try to control them and establish this world as their own. The planet is covered entirely in ice and very small icy oceans. Moons: None; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; DC: 45hr:566d\n\nKraan System\n\nPolarix- An snowy planet located very closely to the Alpha God Zone, which was known to be an old Ehswan planet where Yatoran philosopher Arbasus Kraan was assumed to have died during an excavation of Ehswan artifacts. While some theorize he froze to death, others say he was rescued by Teadr 1 elvuus who inherited/combined Ehswan and Yatoran technology, was made immortal, and he had become the iconic Santha Kraans (AUU version of Santa Claus). He was now given a new purpose where he would deliver presents to nice people all over the AUU every Kraanmas (AUU version of Christmas) on his cloaking spaceship Spirit of Kraanmas operated by elvuus and Cybrums (Yatoran AI). Like the Buzz Lightyear Santa Claus, he keeps a portable Ehswan device on his ship called the Chronulox that stops time so he can bring presents throughout the entire AUU in one night every year on Kraanmas, which can be operated either portably or on the spaceship. To protect himself from Villains Act invasion, Santha had the elvuus create a very state-of-the-art planetary electronic shield wired with bioscanning energy that will allow allies to enter, but not enemies. The planet has a large supercontinent on the North Pole and a smaller continent on the South Pole. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:366d\n\nSqubum System\n\nMovis Locoplux- A semiarid desert planet which has ancient Zyaūar Master ruins, some of which are refashioned into modern rich cities, signs of magic anomalies, a white-blue and orange sky due to small concentrations of krypton, neon and sodium, underground virtual catacombs, mythical-like creatures, untold activity of the AUU Gods, alien fauna and flora, a techno-medieval society, massive rock and geothermal formations, active weather and thermal fluctuations, flying islands and continents levitated by lodestone, and Teadr 1 ruins and monuments. This is an Elvuu world where a massive war against a giant powerful genocidal alien almost got off-planet and annihilated the Zyaūar Masters and use their power to conquer the Alpha Universe, and when the world was deserted when the victory left the world barren and uninhabitable and later healed by the time the Elvuus inhabited it, using their left-behind technology to be used for their benefit. They have thus founded their own 15 prosperous kingdoms. The planet has a large supercontinent, 5 mini continents in a global ocean, and 1,801 islands. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 18hr:315d\n\nEozonedy- A semi-temperate desert planet that has a darker sky due to metallic gases, was a popular place for mining coal before Eroxxon had to outdate them, has massive rock and geothermal formations and wastelands, flourishing mythical-like biota, magic anomalies, Zyaūar ruins, the landscape is mostly igneous, there are black markets and criminal activity, and the inhabitants are very tough and easily confused to an alien level due to isolation. This is a colony of Elvuus and Luckiries, which are mythical beings that travel and are symbols of hope, faith, charity, and luck. They worship the Zyaūar Masters as gods and created a similar society to theirs, fighting against all the corrupt dark forces of black magic origin and having fun while doing it. The planet has 18 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type II; DC: 21hr:355d\n\nQotrone- A temperate jungle planet that has a red sky due to small amounts of neon, alien-mythical biota, expansive and enchanted jungles, Zyaūar and Teadr 1 ruins and monuments, active weather and storms, vibrant cities, magic anomalies, a semi-medieval technological society, large rock and geothermal formations and wastelands, and has a co-orbital configuration (shared orbit) with Peshtone. This was a vibrant colony for the Zyaūar Masters and is now such for Elvuus who refashioned the leftover Zyaūar technology into their modern setting. This is one of the rare world to house the rare Empirid race that the Zyaūar Masters governed, as there is a 5.5% population of these beings who are very comfortable in their setting. The planet has 4 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: None; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: NE:406d\n\nPeshtone- A temperate planet that shares an orbit with Qotrone, has massive Zyaūar Master ruins and landscapes, alien-mythical biota, enchanted alien jungles and land reefs, flying islands and mountains levitated by lodestone, active weather, a normal sky filled with both equal amounts of xenon and mercury, semi-mythical technological civilizations, and magic anomalies. It is a colony for Luckiries and Elvuus which seems to have had a rivalry with the planet neighboring their orbit, and the two almost destroyed each other's planets in this rivalry before calling peace, and thus despite the two having bad odds with each other, they still exist in peace and share culture and technology with each other. The planet has and . Moons: None; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: NE:406d\n\nSpecion Polex- A snowy planet which has large traces of Teadr 1 activity in the form of well-preserved monuments and ruins, having arctic introduced fauna and flora, ancient Teadr 7 ruins, strong storms, a dull sky due to it's small amounts of metallic gases, large glaciers, caverns, mythical creatures, virtual catacombs, large mountains, hot geysers, and a high amount of magical activity. It was a colony of Kraanmas Elvuus before they began working with Santha, and it continues to be a prosperous world. It was perhaps best known to be the founding place of a toy corporation still in business today called Charison Playfacturers, founded by Mister Worklin Charison and currently headquartered on a different planet by Mister Havy Goodwill. However, what landed it out of the Elvuu's hands was when the company was almost shut down by the Globex Confederation of Corporations thanks to the greedy influence of an evil Elvuu entrepreneur named Aoch Alwyn Whiteout, who wished to create his own version of Santha's career for the benefit of the Interuniversal War effort by using the corporation, manufacturing whatever he wished using molecular and digital technology. He sold a device that uses quantum energy to grant anything desired, and it was a big profitable success for the war. However, this device eventually put Santha himself out of a job as it meant there was no need for him, especially when the naughty people were getting things as well. Dubbed 'The Elvuu That Killed Kraanmas', Aoch was fired as the device was used by the enemy to manufacture whatever weapon they wished, and was punished heavily for not only resisting, but for threatening to use the quantum energy to kill Santha himself, as quantum energy was an efficient way to kill people who used quantum-based immortality like Santha. Imprisoned for 60 years, and as a highly-praised movie about the event was released, Aoch later escaped and built a massive industrial park, and became a very-powerful industrial mercenary to manufacture anything for the highest bidder using his old technology. Though he did dealings with the Villains Act multiple times, he cut off provisions after losing trust in them, and began selling his provisions to independent criminal syndicates and anarchic regions of the AUU. This industrial factory had a small impact on the planet as it created toxic waste that, despite acting 50% like a fertilizer, can still toxify many things within the 50-mile radius of the industrial factory itself. His factory utilizes cloned Holozans that utilize hard-light technology for the many uses in the factory, and have even bred regenges as guard animals, enhancing them in various ways. They use the toxic waste they produce as a weapon and as a decorative substance. The industrial park itself is an easy place to get lost and/or killed in. He went unopposed for decades since his escape. The planet has 67 small lakes surrounded entirely by land, and a large icy planetary ring. Moons: None; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: NE:482d\n\nIzce XIX- An ice moon belonging to the white gas giant Izcerich. This moon has iced and snowed in Zyaūar Master ruins, landscapes, and monuments, icy formations and rare sightings of geothermal formations and wastelands, subterranean oceans, small amounts of life, high amounts of cryonite, magic anomalies, battlefield graveyards, and semi-technological civilizations and villages. This is an Elvuu colony which used to be the sight of a cold and intense war against the Zyaūar Masters and magical beings of pure cold that fed on frozen dead called the Izcers, as the two died out killing each other, and now the modern inhabitants still have rumors of Izcers still live today despite no evidence of such. The moon has 8 freezing oceans surrounded entirely by icy land. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; OT: 286d\n\nFroxola System\n\nRugulach- A scorched lava planet with 3 moons, and loads of volcanic activity. Abandoned long ago by the Yatorans following the intensifying conditions, the lava blasts and pyroclastic flows set the world in flames and destroy anything in it's path. This planet is inhabited because of it's large amount of valuable spices and metals, and the cities are mobile in order to avoid being destroyed by the lava and volcanic activity. All cities have an emergency auto-pilot system that navigates the city from incoming volcanic danger. Moons: 3; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type II; DC: 21hr:386d\n\nYaton- An ecumenopolis planet that has an invisible shield around it to protect it. It is the home planet of a race of Teadr 1 humanoids called Yatorans, who are considered gods for their intelligence and religion, and are the only extant beings in the AUU to have a Teadr 1 level. They had a hand in creating the Interdimensional Portal on Breezso Prime, and are part of the USRA. It has over 9 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:398d; Capital City: Sacrosanct City\n\nAlifair- A jungle planet which is known to have been the second planet the Yatorans have colonized before the AUU Second Cartoonian War. It is a prosperous world with multiple large AFTs the size of asteroids, and it is known to have the richest cities and businessman in the Oekumene (Yatoran Government). The AFTs can be seen in space, and the ground is amazingly elegant in architecture and life. The planet has 5 continents and 2 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:432d; Capital City: Ommacgromma\n\nEsxerus- A snowy mountainous ice planet where hardly any life exists except for plants, fungus, and single-celled organisms. This is a large planet where the Yatorans have built mining colonies to collect cryonite to use for many purposes. It is also a home to several Globex facilities. The Yatoran cities can mostly be found underground, as well as most of the Globex facilities. This planet is covered entirely of snow and has a large icy planetary ring. Moons: 3; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 27hr:485d; Capital City: Chossis\n\nRex System\n\nTyranno- A hot terrestrial jungle planet that has a red, orange, and yellow sky filled with carbon gases, neon, and has two ozone layers, has an elliptic orbit around it's red supergiant sun and mini yellow star which follows the planet in the same orbital position and the winters far from the suns are not as hot as when it's closer, has prehistoric alien biota, the storms are extremely active due to the temperatures, there are massive geothermal, toxic, volcanic, and rocky formations, valleys and wastelands, underground catacombs, a core of iridium, and massive orgaliths. This is a hostile world of dinosaurs that have a slight mistrust of outsiders, including the planet's main sentient race, tall Teadr 1.5-2.5 T-Rex-like beings that are roughly the same height as Captain Gantu called Vyranasaurus Trexes, AKA Vyrans, Trexes, or Trekles, which were brash and aggressive creatures with old tie-ins to other races like the Brutans and Phends, and are the second biggest challenge the Yatorans faced since the Ehswans as they were against outside-aided technological advancement. The race came close to subjugating the Yatorans until being overwhelmed by their allies and supporters, forcing them to retreat, swearing to return but have not done so for eons. Even so, it would not be the last of them. The planet has a massive supercontinent and a massive global ocean with many small islands and a single island continent. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 36hr:502d; Capital City: Heller Creek City\n\nWorxus System\n\nAracxem- A semi-temperate desert planet which is noted for being covered mostly by entertainment lands and funfairs, all often being created by the magoplast of Molapox. Most of the monuments here can be manipulated by this substance, and the Teadr level ranges depending upon the setting and impact the discovered magoplast has on it. There are also massive flying islands that are levitated by loadstone. Any area of this planet can be inhabited, including the air and sea, and the setting can be bended with the magoplast no matter how dense the air or water is. The planet has 8 large continents and 3 small oceans, and it has a large rocky and icy planetary rings. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 21hr:312d; Capital City: Splishmatter\n\nSorama- An ecumenopolis planet which has a large global city created upon the discovery of Molapoxian magoplast, which allowed this city to be created from scratch. Thus, this city has grown to be a prosperous place with colorful lighting, 83% plant life, holographic/screen display and propaganda, holographic windows with computer interfaces, customizable vehicles, levitating AFT platforms, robotic activity, and a great culture and religion. The use of magoplast here has started to be useful for good, but often for evil since this substance's abuse of power is what lead to this planet going through a war against those who used it responsibly to those who used it irresponsibly. But the war ended up refreshing the design of the city at a grand scale. The planet has several small oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:367d\n\nMolapox- A semi-wasteland world which has a ranging environment of either ship graveyards, city ruins, or even prosperous cities. This world has been noted for the discovery of magoplast, a magical substance rumored to have been chemically-created by the AUU Gods and was accidentally introduced to the world of mortals and couldn't be retrieved. As a result, the magoplast, which was capable of synthesizing and dissolving any physical object like paint in a cartoon, was a commercial success, but ever since a heresy charge which originated from the rumor of it belonging to the AUU Gods and was not allowed to be used by mortals, a law was passed that only the Worxus System could wield this substance unless trusted with chosen outsiders. And thus, the 3 other planets in this world have been the only 3 places in the AUU allowed to use magoplast. The planet has 12 continents and 8 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 27hr:442d\n\nNirmes- A mountainous temperate planet which is the last world on this planet that is allowed to use magoplast. The planet has massive mountains, monoliths, buttes, and rocky mounds. The planet ranges in Teadr level due to the magoplast being used by different immigrants from all over the AUU. There are over 58 ranged territories from multiple worlds across the AUU, and they have often been through wars for what they should do with the magoplast. This planet thankfully only goes through wars as commonly as humans do. The planet has 9 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: None; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: NE:483d; Capital City: Majijunk Falls\n\nBranfrin System\n\nInvervitrax- A desert planet similar to Ancient Egypt. The monuments are so large, they can be built right over gorges. The main species, a race of Teadr 7 camel-like reptiles called Invervasaurs, have a complex architecture, culture, and a highly primitive advancement in technology such as medicine and flight. The Invervasaurs are also one of the many species in the UUniverses that know magic. Some of their abandoned monuments have been preserved as historic sites, and it bestows a legend about crossed-breed beings that caused chaos in it's ancient days. It has 1 large supercontinent surrounded by a large ocean. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:363d\n\nHorvathos- A planet filled with sentient reptiles and dinosaurs. However, this planet has faced pathogens for years, and the sentients there are still working on the problem. The cause of the plague apocalypse has been unknown, but the planet is mainly the home of a microscopic sentient bacteria called Baccillium necrosi, commonly known as 'composure', which is an adaptive disease that could adapt to nearly any kind of vaccination, adapting so much that medicine couldn't keep up, and has wiped out millions of communities. The origin of the composure disease is also unknown. It has 4 continents, and 3 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type III (Due to plagues); DC: 24hr:402d\n\nIgrall- A wetland planet which is known for being 87% covered in water, and is inhabited by creatures that evolved from sea creatures like cephalopods, echinoderms, and even crustaceans. This is the home planet of a race of Teadr 3 crab-like humanoids called Igrallans, which are good allies to the Legion, and helps provide their very useful technology for them to fight off the Villains Act. When it was destroyed, the race continued to remain allies. Their Teadr 3 cities are found either in the water or on the land, and contain pearly-white buildings with durable glass windows, screen displays and propaganda, a 68% abundance of coral reefs or plants, and aqua/ground vehicles. The planet has 4 small continents and a few small islands. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:410d\n\nToporpipon- A large tundrous and coniferous medieval planet where many sentient creatures live in a European-like 16th century society. It lives in a part-feudalistic world where the king's staff, the sages, would offer land for pheasants in exchange for military, economic, and monumental labor. This is also one of the many planets to use magic. Villages are huge, and the king castles can stand over 70ft tall. It has 5 continents. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 29hr:496d\n\nSipbus System\n\nTammon- A semi-temperate desert planet which is noted for it's massive rock formations, it's plants that grow on vertical landscapes, it's small amounts of ancient ship graveyards, and for the many ancient artifacts which were uncovered from this planet. These artifacts, according to archaeologists, are supposed to belong to an ancient former race of Zyaūar Masters, and the ancient ruins found here even seem to match the culture. The ruins have been speculated to be old enough to have lasted during the AUU First Cartoonian War. Some cities are inhabited by secret societies of the descendants of the ancient Zyaūar Masters, though none have been spotted. Some places on this planet are enchanted, and filled with mythical creatures. The planet has 5 large continents surrounding small oceans. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:311d\n\nSorcelle- A rainforest planet which is known to be a world similar to the Forbidden Forest of Camelot, only it is a global enchanted rainforest consisting of magic, mythical creatures, and is inhabited by ancient Teadr 6 tribes which live in a medieval/tribal-like society with a Guru that rules as the elder mage ruler of the planet, and live their lives training for defense against invasion forces from each others' other nations. There are a medium activity of rainstorms which keep the planet's rainforests moist and strong, and this world heralds Zyaūar Masters as gods after discovering a few of their artifacts. The planet has 1 large ocean and several small lakes and rivers surrounded entirely by land, and it has an icy planetary ring. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 22hr:345d; Capital City: Gurudom Village\n\nBameus- A mountainous temperate planet which has a vast amount of plants and land corals, and the wildlife comes in varying shapes and sizes. Some landscapes of this planet are enchanted by the same magic as that of Sorcelle. This is where several ancient warriors from either Sorcelle or Empyrean who perfected interplanetary travel train for almost a whole year until they become a prideful and strong member of their royal guard. The terrain is perfect enough for that to be possible, consisting of mountains, rock formations, and geothermal valleys. The planet has 9 large continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:387d\n\nEmpyrean- A large semi-lava planet which is surrounded by over millions of flying islands levitated by magnetanium. This world has a few complex architectural ruins similar in design to similar ones on Tammon, which indicates that this was a world that was colonized by the Zyaūar Masters, or might've been their place of origin, and it was secretly so and these beings were of a Gnostic/Norse/Christian/Japanese anime-style Teadr 1.5 race called the Empirids, who were essentially humanoids with animal body parts, eccentric and pure personalities, and animalistic abilities and behavior, as they lived in a techno-magic society and a democratic monarchy where they could use magic and technology together and even combine them, and became a race dedicated to justice and guardianship of the most deadliest and powerful of techno-magic relics, most of them all over the UUniverses created and owned by them. They then disappeared when the planet went through a cataclysmic event that made the race extremely rare and now there's not much left yet their power and martial arts are still in use today. The surface of the planet is rarely inhabited since it faced massive seismic activity, and thus only a few traces of safe terrain exists on the surface of this world. This world is now populated by sentient animals that live under a autocratic society with a Master ruling, and the planet has a massive amount of magical capabilities, and these beings also worship the Zyaūar Masters with pride. The planet has over 5,488 flying islands and a large rocky and icy planetary ring. Moons: 3; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 32hr:519d; Capital City: Empyrical City\n\nTromethaeus System\n\nIesmirce- A magical semi-ecumenopolis planet which has 50% of a global city with matching architecture to that of Angella, while the other half is pure wildlife consisting of colorful plant life and plentiful animals. This is a planet where magic and science coexist with each other, and the cities are open to all sentient beings and animals. This is an Angellan planet where several Teadr 1-based monuments were spread, and the ruling families are required to have an expansive knowledge on magic and science in order to keep themselves knowledgeable for peace, just like all other leaders of each of the Angellan planets. The planet has 13 continents and 10 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:318d\n\nAngella- A magical semi-ecumenopolis planet which is significantly crafted in ancient Teadr 1 technology which surprisingly wasn't Yatoran or Ehswan in origin. This world's cities, which has appearances matching that of the Yatorans, but made of white and gold metals, belong to the planet's main race of Teadr 2 human-like avian beings known as the Angellans. It is believed and sometimes confirmed by the race itself that it actually descended from a godly race that brought the gift of Teadr 1 technology to the mortal world by order of it's follower, Tromethaeus, the AUU version of Prometheus who was the titan of knowledge and prosperity that, following his introduction of Teadr 1 technology to mortals through the Angellans without consent of the Gods, was eternally turned into an unsentient cybernetic abomination guardian of the godly underworld as punishment, while the Angellans would be banished to the land of mortals and stripped of their immortality, knowledge, and Teadr 1 technology, which would lead one to believe that this race is what's left of them. The Angellans eventually reached a pro-Teadr 1 level and became well-praised beings. The planet has 12 small continents surrounding small oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 28hr:409d\n\nSau Anatus- A terrestrial jungle planet where only a few Teadr 1-based monuments with Angellan architecture are found, the environment is massive, abundant in plant life, and has elegant animals. The Angellans that colonized this planet had renounced technology to become one with magic and nature so they could be a much more efficient and natural race. Thus, technology was kept at an absolute minimum, and the Angellans seemed to enjoy their new magocratic lifestyle. The planet has 5 continents surrounding small oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 32hr:593d\n\nYorrptran System\n\nThanat- A tropical jungle planet where there are vicious monsters and unsentient animals. The planet is so wild that not all visitors survive. Visitors have to be heavily armed and be equipped with first aid kits. Myths say that the animals here are crazy due to a certain rabidity disorder. This world is a place where people can participate in gladiator hunting, a strict sport where people can hunt the animals and earn rewards for their effort, which makes it an attraction for criminal underworlds. Only 40% of competitors are able to survive a game of gladiator hunting here. It has 5 continents and 2 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:411d\n\nOrlifar- A temperate planet which is one of the many worlds colonized by the Zewinsaurs. It's vast geothermal valleys and bodies contain valuable metals and minerals that are valuable in their trade, and the volcanoes contain precious volcanic gems that are often traded to the AUU Currency Troupe. The Zewinsaurs have built large ziggurats here which have elevators which lead to underground golden cities, or underground sanctuaries. Cities are rarely found on the surface of the planet. This was where Zewinsaurs had a few large battles during their early days. The planet has 8 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:476d; Capital City: Fangath\n\nPycabulon- A wetland jungle planet which is dominated primarily by dinosaurs and mammals. The planet has 2 continents that separate the dinosaurs from the mammals. The planet's two main inhabitants are the Teadr 6 Dinobes, a species of omnivorous sapient theropod beings, and the Teadr 5 Simobes, a species of saber-toothed feline beings. Both sides share an alliance with each other after a brief feud in the past, and have a peaceful community. These two races both share a diplomatic government, though the Simobes are republican while the Dinobes are democratic, and both races share the same technology due to their alliance. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:502d; Capital Cities: SR: Smiydect, DD: Dynorbent\n\nZroppene System\n\nEilien- A desert mountainous lava planet which was formerly an Ehswan planet until their extinction left the Yatorans to claim it's many megalopolises and lava refineries. This world keeps a fair amount of plants which have access to the water deep within the arid climate. The lava refineries are mainly seen being handled by small orange eusocial beings called Thabes, which are semi-sentient workers who are seen doing jobs all over the AUU since their home planet of Thabbac was the victim of climate change. This planet is known to get very hot in the summer time, and thus going outside during this is a precautious time. The planet has no oceans and is covered entirely of desert and lava. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 18hr:299d; Capital City: Eil Irrat\n\nGaobene- A temperate planet and former colony of the Ehswans. This was the Ehswans' main source of advanced research in technology, and thus the Yatorans who claimed the millions of labs made this the Science Capital of the Oekumene. They even gave the USRA permission to claim whatever labs were abandoned and turn them into Globex facilities. This planet had supplied a few clues in the history of Ehswan technology, and the Yatorans had used this information to perfect their technology. The planet has 3 continents and a large global ocean. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:344d\n\nZoisac- An abandoned temperate planet which was the sight of several AUU Second Cartoonian War battles against the Ehswans and the Yatorans. Now, the only sentient beings who dwell this planet are scavenging Thabes who make new things out of the scrap metal and scavenged resources. The planet still has sustainable life on it, and the Thabes have been taking advantage of it, making it a new colony to live on. The planet has 6 continents and 2 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:369d\n\nDithi- A tundrous planet which was a former Ehswan military colony where several famed AUU Second Cartoonian War battles took place. When the Ehswans went extinct, the Yatorans made this their own military colony. This world has been significant for it's many war museums which only show forts and military non-functioning weapons. This planet has 7 continents and 4 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:403d\n\nPax V- A temperate moon belonging to the blue gas giant Pax. It was a former Ehswan colony which housed their greatest virtual technology and civilization. All civilization is located underground and all the underground catacombs are virtual. The virtual environment has satisfied the Yatorans for millions of years, and even the USRA races. The surface is only good for hiking or for tourism of the abundant wildlife. The moon has 7 large lakes. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 460d; Capital City: Togresson City\n\nAddictra System\n\nAddictra Prime- A forest world of cage-like trees and brambles, large mushroom forests, rich alien pools, fogs and active weather, multipod aliens fauna, sharp peaks, large wetlands, rich amounts of oxygen, and air-pocketed geology. It is the home planet of the Dug-like Teadr 2 Addictrins, who are not just excellent tinkerers, fuel suppliers, medics, and warrior fighters, but also the creators of addictron, the most addictive drug in the AUU. It is a spice-like powder made from the rich addictrix mushroom trees that is said to make someone so high they literally forget all their troubles as an amnestic agent. Despite the Addictrins having a complacent society, they used to have a vibrant society before the discovery of addictron, reducing them to Teadr 7 society while their forgotten technology was left to rot. As a result, the planet and system was obscured from AUU knowledge, with the exception of the UIS, who has utilized addictron as an amnestic agent for the isolation of certain systems. The planet has 5 continents and 2 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; DC: 22hr:298d\n\nRaintrix System\n\nFabulon- A semi-temperate planet that has a blue sky filled with mercury and xenon, vast amounts of introduced/native fauna and flora, weak weather, large mountains, ancient Teadr 7 tombs and ruins, large bodies of water, and the trademark symbol of the system it's in is a Yin-Yang symbol with one side rainbow-colored and the other being blue and pink. This is because the planet is the capital of the AUU LGBT community, and thus homosexuality is the acceptable norm while heterosexuality is the sexual orientation being treated poorly. This is because the system was once under an extremely-harsh straight fascist regime that was commiting harsh violations of basic rights while hiding behind religion and inaccurate science to justify the cruelty. A bisexual mage came and liberated the world by inspiring a rebellion and dethrone the anti-gay leaders, believing and knowing that love shouldn't be controlled or hated because of not being considered 'normal' to some, suggesting that they leave under threat of violating many free rights laws and being punished. Thus, the mage became the new ruler of the system ever since, yet ended up banning heterosexuality as a result because the crimes of the old government were too much to forgive, something the mage didn't want at first until being forced to oblige by the planet because the scars left by the old government were too great for even him to mend and only wanted the people to be happy. This is an ongoing issue even the likes of the USRA races are still trying to resolve peacefully, especially when it created a pro-heterosexuality extremeist group called The Straighteners of Raintrix, which proved to only complicate things. The system itself is named 'Raintrix' because of rainbows being the signature color of the system due to it's society. The planet has the pleasure of being in a system were all the colors of the rainbow are seen, and the world is in a system with three suns, all being red, blue, and yellow, thus creating a rainbow illusion. The planet has a large supercontinent and a medium-sized global ocean and several lakes. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:403d ; Capital City: Homobeus City\n\nStraightos- A desert moon belonging to Fabulon, as it has a blue sky due to small amounts of mercury, introduced wildlife from it's parent planet, less-active weather, large mountains and rock formations, lava formations, and foggy nights. Being a former mining colony part of pre-homosexual Fabulon until the 'gay rebellion' happened and rendered the moon the only place straights can afford to live. Some straights feel awful about ever encouraging a rotten goverment to begin with while others failed to understand that and went to join the Straighteners, despite them being an extremist group that is only encouraging further negative beliefs against heterosexual people while hiding behind their claims of 'bringing back righteous glory to the Raintrix System', but they do this by the crime of mass-sterilization and use of OIDS, or the AUU version of AIDS, only making them look like terrorists than true liberators. Because of religious motivation, the Straighteners are considered a target for a familiar group headquartered in the Alpha Universe that doesn't tolerate religion being used as an excuse to harm others. Because of the Straighteners, families are divided and broken because of challenged loyalties and conflict of interests. As a result, this is also the most targeted place by Fabulon's defense force, The Queer Squad. The moon has 26 lakes surrounded entirely by land. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 60d; Capital City: Hetereus City\n\nQueerus- A temperate planet and the twin planet of Fabulon, having large alien fauna and flora, much from Fabulon, having stronger weather, a similar spatial appearance to Fabulon, higher levels of clouds, has large mountains and canyons, Teadr 7 monuments and ruins, and is known as the military capital of The Queer Squad. It's forces patrol the entire system to fight against the Straighteners and/or either supporters of them or outside threats of likewise or other reasons. The force was able to afford the best military-police force technology the AUU can provide, and they were surprisingly rough and strong with it firepower, being so strong it scared even the Villains Act from wanting anything to do with the system. Not even the promise of fanatical support from a Straightener leader was worth it to them as it marred more then that even the Villains Act doesn't approve of the Straighteners' methods, even if some of the Villains Act's members aren't exact improvements. Because of this, failed attempt or not, the Straighteners' attempts to get VA support forever damned the name of Straighteners in Raintrix, and is one of two major reasons, next to the bioterrorism, why heterosexuality on Straightos are so divided and broken. The planet has a large supercontinent, and a medium-sized global ocean, and several large lakes and rivers. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 29hr:501d; Capital City: Queed\n\nCartolich-Tishis System\n\nCartoonworld- An astral world created through the self-developing spirit of cartoon characters, and took form after an asteroid crash on this world, turning it into the casual homeworld of all cartoon characters in existence. The environment and culture is ranged, it has a society mostly similar to Toontown (disbanded MMORPG game and Roger Rabbit version), it has influences in magic, great architecture, and the ways of the cartoons here are ranged. The planet has 6 continents, millions of small islands and 4 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 30hr:600d; Capital City: Laughsville\n\nVcrintex System\n\nVcrintex Capital- A terrestrial soiled jungle planet with massive twisted landscapes, mountains, rock, toxic, and geothermal formations and wastelands, underground landscapes, orgaliths, boney graveyards, a semi-breathable atmosphere of carbon dioxide and just as much oxygen, a massive cloud layer and many ozone layers that block out sunlight, both of which are 5x more than that of Earth, allowing not only storms to be volatile with the flammable air, but it allowed insects to grow large and become the dominant lifeform, along with zooplantae and land reefs. This is the home planet of a race of Teadr 2 mantis-spider creatures called the Vcrintexens, who are matriarchal beings with females much larger than the males like a spider, and the males are so subservient they have little to no purpose to the other gender besides procreation. Regardless, the females are infamous for taking males from other races and procreating with them, changing their genetics for better or for worse yet not tainting the genetic selection, despite the fact the females are asexual. They have two kinds of venom where one is like an unstable hallucinogen and the other is an aphrodisiac that increases the sex drive of their victims, and mainly for a web so thick it doesn't even feel like web and is more of a malleable solid metal, meaning they can make many weapons capable of destroying an entire armada in little-to-no time flat. They deploy solar drones to act as mini suns that go to space, absorb sunlight, and bring it back down to the surface so it doesn't end up being a planetary detriment. The cloud layers also conduct and insulate energy so that only Vcrintexen ships are able to enter. The Vcrintexens' membership with UIS has ensured that through their extremely hardened web, the UIS can make sure USRA control is limited to what is in their control while keeping their systems or unallied systems from automatically joining them, and still do to this day. The planet has 8 continents surrounding 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:413d\n\nVcrintex Lesser- A barren rocky moon and the moon of Vcrintex Capital that has a breathable yet thin atmosphere, low amounts of biota, and is the headquarters for the Vcrintexens of the UIS. Here the UIS built a space wall of Vcrintexen web that blocked out USRA advancement to the rest of the sector all in the name of keeping the USRA from having a too-expanded range. The moon has 82 lakes surrounded entirely by land. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 40d\n\nIsolated Systems-1[]\n\nZeymti- A rogue snowy lava planet that has inhospitable and uninhabitable wastelands of death, no oxygen, no life, an unstable hyperstorm called the Dead Spot, a volatile atmosphere, and no consistent terrain. Located within a dark nebula called the Darkout Nebula, this planet is known in Zyaūar Master history to be the imprisonment site for the genocidal nihilist Cighry Yuh Darkout during ancient times inside a capsule that sealed him in a reality where literally nothing exists, as the capsule has been there for eons and thus has been heavily obscured by history, further helped that the rogue planet is trapped within the isolated universes thanks to UIS, but it's a mixed blessing in consideration to that it's largely dominated by the Graggs. DT: Tier 1; AT: Type III\n\nRewben System\n\nRemena- A temperate planet that has Zyaūar complexes, ruins and monuments, a techno-magical society, alien-mythical biota, complex jungles, active weather and storms, high-tech civilizations, flying islands and mountains levitated by lodestone, vibrant landscapes, large rock formations, a magical core, elegant Teadr 1 and anime themes, a colorful sky filled with small amounts of noble gases, enchanted jungles and land reefs, and magic anomalies. This is a world which is the most common place to find Empirids leftover from the death of the Zyaūar Masters, but it is noted to have four kingdoms, each ruled by a king and/or queen and council, called Dell on the biggest continent of Aranasia, Gale on the continent of Meda, Vacua on the continent of Cosma, and Almana on the continent of Vigorasia, each different in their own native way. It also has somewhat of a soul because of it's magic core, and the essence of this soul is called 'tense' which is wielded and protected from unlawful abuse by the Radiance, consisting of Espers and Espresses who use melee/firearm hybrid weapons that were previously wielded and crafted by the Zyaūar Masters that founded and protected the planet, founded by Master Sembla Aüdüx TurÆmblance, a beautiful warrior whose current descendant, Aranasia Æther helps train the Radiance into being good defenders against Grimaces, animals that are personifications of the soul core's darkness and anonymity, and criminal guilds like the Sharp Fang consisting of Empirids who were discriminated and terrorize in the name of destroying the otherworldly population and claiming it for themselves, and other criminal masterminds. The Radiances of each kingdom, all run by Aranasia's Council, continue to fight the crime and terrorism of this world to this very day. The planet has 7 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 25hr:369d\n\nSheris System\n\nAshken- A hot temperate planet that is the Alpha-1 Headquarters of the United Usurpation Force lead by the Mirtian Commander Misikar. It has several subterranean volcanic bases and labs underneath bustling technological cities that are connected by underground transit systems, and a close connection to outside services to other UUF places. However, the planet was eventually lost due to a particularly nasty Gragg attack that, though Misikur fought off in a self-sacrivice, the planet was subsiquintly annexed by the neighrering Freo System under UIS enfluence, the operation shut-downed and surviving UUF members arrested and transported to Corionus System. The planet has 10 continents and 4 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 25hr:369d; Capital City: Cinder City\n\nFreo System\n\nFontamo- A watery planet that has several mounds of land, active rain and storms, alien biota, strong tides, and advanced cities and technology. The world is known for being a UIS world notable for adapting around increasing tidal conditions, a cheap economy, and is an old Watan colony where Watan architecture and sculptures can still be found in the waters of the planet. The planet has 81 small continental islands and 18 oceans. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 24hr:360d; Capital City: Fountain City\n\nGraggaroc System\n\nGraggaroc Supreme- A toxic wasteland planet with rock, toxic, lava, and geothermal formations and wastelands, a core made of arsenic, high volcanic activity, a semi-breathable atmosphere, a red sky filled with small amounts of neon, active and powerful weather, alien-like biota, and ancient metropolitan ruins and slums. This is the homeworld of the Aggressor Empire's favorite allies, a race of Teadr 2.5 EVO-suit-wearing lizard people known as the Graggarockers, historically known as the Graggans. They were, and are, a highly corporate and crazed tinker race that creates guns that master the elements, nature and scientific, all forms of acidic and lava properties, and turn them into usable weaponry. They were even capable of creating an artificial species of horned beasts called Devilmocks, which can have a varity of traits and specialties, smaller cousins of the Graggarockers ride giant ill-mannered beasts that can combat with the native land-jellyfish monsters known as the Zapclaps, and are associated with a powerful Teadr 1 race of machines known as the Tecnobabbles, historically known as the Mechards, which are robotized creatures so good with robotics and technology that figuring out the complexities of even Omnicans is 'child's play' to them. They too befriended the Aggressor Empire because the victory of spoils offered them a chance to get more tech to become more powerful. The Graggarroc System has ruled the entire isolated systems in the secter for years with exception to Rewben due to the fact that attempts to come and own Rewben, thanks to it's vast defenses, have proven problematic. But the inhumble Graggarockers proved to be persistant pests to their neighbors in the system as the idea of a system they can't rule annoy them. The planet has 19 continents, over 18,000 islands and 9 oceans. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type II; DC: 29hr:565d\n\nKinbim System\n\nJazzzummm System\n\nTriggreas System\n\nDooma System\n\nHazzhag System\n\nKinternet System\n\nVinpie System\n\nKlaaaa System\n\nPlanntana System\n\nGoomooisu System\n\nTagggoggg System\n\nBururp System\n\nHonlomono System\n\nJisss System\n\nJonana System\n\nCorious System\n\nGroonfak System\n\nKryimsomus System\n\nMedr System\n\nMirs- A Mars-like desert alien planet and among the few remaining non-Graggarock-congured systems with a breathable thin atmosphere, alien biota, and is the home planet of the Teadr 2.5-3.0 Mirtians, who are a race of slender alien warriors that fought against both the Mïtians long ago and the Fyrrhenoids before their territory was claimed by the UIS. They have come against UIS when their control restricted their space programs, and some have joined the UUF. The planet has 18 continents surrounding 8 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 21hr:325d\n\nMinstros System\n\nMonstros- A large terrestrial jungle superplanet based on the Monster Hunter Franchise and does has creatures no less different then them. But with one giant twist. When the Graggs once ruled this planet, they exspearimented on creatures that would come to become the Mon-Elders, who realised the sevre moral backruptcy of the Graggs, and unsurprisingly revolted, exsiling the reckless reptilians off the Planet that would now be named \"Monstros\", and granting the inhapidence sentience. These Mon Elders, Fitilas, Krins, Lung-Shan Lao, Luna, Teo, Ala Treon, Armastu, Cea Deus, Shagarumagala, and Shah Dala Madur, The Suprime Mon-Elder, were the Mon-Elders that kept pure while other Mon-Elders went rouge and failed to let go of the pain the Graggs put them through, these fallen Mon-Elders being Krimson Fitilas, Ashton Lung-Shan Lao, Chame Leos, the Mon Elder brothers Kushala & Daora, Tama Ysukami, Goldbeard Deus, Dire Marilas, The Twin Mon Elder Sand Terrors Jhen & Mohran, Val Phalk, Dah'ren, Gog Mazios, Oroshi Krins, Naka Rkos, Vaalhazak, Xenojiiva, Shah's dark brother Speartip Dala Madur, Kulvetaroth, and the Kaiju-sized darkest Mon Elder of them all, Mon Elder Zorah. All these rogue Mon Elders were thankfully locked up in exile christails designed to keep them trapped for all of enturnity. And this was made possable by a group of creatures that formed the Hunter Monsters, a group of powerful Apexes that banded togather and defeated each of the vastly powerful elders even dispite being outsized at times. However, a recently gone rouge Mon Elder, Nergi Gante, would prove to become a great problem, even when he was given an exile christail. He had then escaped the following days after, and crippled the co-leader of the group so greatly, it caused a disbansion because of how broken and demoralised the main leader was because the co-leader was also his life partner. Nergi did went absint for a good while since and peace went on in relitive terms, minus the rise of crime barons that took quick advantage of the Hunters downfall because they also went after the criminals of the planet as well, thus the remaining pure elders are left with the fear that their corrupted brethern are at risk of being freed by Nergi and their only defence are disbanned by loss of leadership and conflicting egos, while also needing a way to quell the crime barons and their uprisings. The problems of Monstros are still yet to be addressed. The planet has a massive supercontinent, 19,900 islands and two oceans. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:315d\n\n2. Apirion Sector[]\n\nFounded by a Yatoran pioneer named One-Eye Apirion, the Apirion Sector is the first of the sectors the Yatorans began to discover during the days of knowing their 'gods' to ascend into greatness. While still having a good influence of order, the Apirion Sector is not as short of problems as most of the other sectors, though considered the most lightly affected place from the Great Stagnation since the Alpha Universe's great influence of order, so truthful lawless rarely exists here. Although, the closest things to truly worry about in this sector is that of the Zargon System, which is the home system of the fearsome world harvesters.\n\nBibler- A rogue paradise planet with ranging and spontaneously adapting wildlife, and hive-minded organisms that act like antibodies, as they were created as germ weapons by the world's former AUU God inhabitants to protect it from looters who wish to exploit it's massive collection of Teadr 0 technology. Though the Apirion is it's origin sector, the planet is infamous for never staying in the same place for longer than a few days, months or even years before appearing in another system depending on how alive it is, as it was made this way before the departure of the AUU Gods and managed by the antibodies. Thus, rarely have people managed to fully study this world in adequate time, and fewer still had even managed to see it up close. The planet has 48 small lakes and oceans and 5,123 islands. Moons: None; DT: None; AT: Type I; DC: NE\n\nZoobon System\n\nSanctus- The uninhabitable Mercury-like first barren planet that has a hard flammable Venus-like surface with flammable toxic air, geothermal and volcanic wastelands, no life, extremely powerful weather, burning temperatures, a core of boron, and a massive cloud layer. It's favored by the SSA for it's high amounts of natural gas that is useful as a fuel source, and actually used to be a mining colony for the Carbonoids before their extinction. The planet has 7 lava oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: None; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type III; DC: NE:162d\n\nJoaumble- A temperate planet that has elegant Earth-like landscapes, a colorful sky filled with small amounts of noble gases, a core of pure copper, seas rich with primordial ooze pools and crystallized primordial ooze called primordite which is used in evolutionary rays used by both the SSA and the Evolution Masters, and is a very sought-after source of artificial evolution experiments. This is a minor trading colony of the SSA that heavily supports sentient animals all over the AUU and helps in sentient animal charities and trading drives, having cities and towns with active market districts and a slight ounce of Freetrader activity. The planet has 6 continents, 18 large islands and 2 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:215d\n\nTaxonomoworld- A superhabitable Earth-like planet, the capital world and homeworld of sentient animals themselves, has jungles, ranging landscapes and environments, colorful skies filled with small amounts of noble gases, active storms, nutrient-rich soil and water, and has underground caves full of primordial ooze. This is the world where sentient animals come from though unknown circumstances during the AUU First Cartoonian War through a theorized ancient civilization called Zoobranians, and is the capital of the Society of Sentient Animals, an organization that protects and watches the well-being of sentient animals all over the AUU. The society is highly advanced and the architecture fits a sentient animal perfectly, having ranging scales, signs of Teadr 1 technology, and the cities are mainly accessible by underground superhighways that leave the surface open and preserved for unsentient animals. The planet has 19 continents, 9 oceans, and large icy, crystalline, and dusty planetary rings. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 23hr:305d\n\nTaxice- An ecumenopolis moon belonging to Taxonoworld that has Zootopian-like architecture but appears more Sci-Fi in appearance and has a balance between nature and civilization, and a viable atmosphere. Once being a colony of an ancient undocumented First Cartoonian War race that took the forms of animals to survive a harsh world out to get them, this is an world rumored to have stories of sentient beings turning themselves into sentient animals and plotting a conspiracy, but despite such technology evolving here, such a thing has only been an urban myth. This world has 25 small oceans surrounded entirely by metropolitan land. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; OT: 42d\n\nInteger- A superhabitable Earth-like planet that has a massive amount of biota that resembles that around different worlds around the AUU, colorful landscapes and skies, ancient alien ruins, active storms and weather, and a near-Earth society. This is a high-tech military colony and the capital of the Animal High Command, the SSA's top law enforcing military branch. The world had a massive amount of alien military technology that allowed the AHC to manufacture their own technology through reverse-engineering, as it was reportedly the sight of a war against mortals and the AUU Gods, and is currently a good world capable of protecting sensitive technology based on sentient animals. The planet has 8 continents, 5 oceans, and large icy and dusty planetary ring. (TBC...) Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 26hr:358d\n\nEumeta- A jungle planet that has introduced wildlife from Taxonomoworld, and has the same appearance and setting. The planet was the first to be terraformed by the SSA and is one of their commonplace colonies within the system and has been a colony for the same race that took animal forms from Taxice before cataclysm that rendered it uninhabitable. The planet has 5 continents and 3 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 28hr:392d\n\nEvolt- A soiled alien island planet that has a red sky and a primordial soup ocean. This is a world that has been through genetic experiments, illegal or otherwise, during the Teadr 1 Ages that resulted in the ocean getting a mind of it's own and a secret colony of the Renacouri. This ooze became a preservation of any genetic material and became like a gelatinous codex not only allowing it to evolve, but become nearly sentient. This ooze can also build life and thus created the expansive wildlife on the planet, and it is relatively harmless. The planet has over 16,000 islands and one Australia-sized continent. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 30hr:418d\n\nEvo I- The soiled moon of Evolt that has a soft upper crust and solid lower crust, a thin yet breathable atmosphere, large cities and agricultural colonies, alien biota, and large rocky formations. This is an agriworld for the SSA which has nitrogen-rich highly organic soil for agriculture and farming of any kind. The moon has 10 oceans surrounded entirely by land. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 30d\n\nZoole- An ecumenopolis planet and the most populous planet in the system, having Zootopia-like scifi architecture, a normal sky filled with small amounts of mercury and xenon, plentiful amounts of biota to keep the atmosphere breathable, there is an underground global metro transit, and the cities have powerful lighting and underground power reactors. This large planet is a getaway for sentient animals and has been so since the ancient days when they were segregated, as they have formed massive sponsorships for the SSA and is guarded heavily by the AHC. The planet has 14 oceans surrounded entirely by metropolitan land. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 33hr:449d\n\nVesaliu- A temperate planet that has large mountains, a surface similar to a barren planet, has crystalline fields, geothermal and toxic valleys and formations, flying islands levitated by magnetanium, advanced ruins and monuments, modern cities, active weather, a core of pure carbon, and nitrogen-rich soil. This was once the richest source of zoobrainium, an artificial organically-enhanced element that could turn sentient animals unsentient and back again, which seeped into the planet that used to be a former Evolution Master colony. The planet has 8 continents and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 35hr:487d\n\nVero- A barren alien terrestrial moon belonging to Vesaliu. The moon is infamous for being the home of an environmental disaster zone of zoobrainium origin that does more than create sentience, but it also manipulates biology and genetics, creating new lifeforms and animals, and is the supposed home of the building blocks for all the Teadr 0 Racegivers. The moon was abandoned since the zone spread globally and it has since remained dormant and on it's own, as the zone has an unknown origin. The moon has 18 continents and 8 oceans. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; OT: 28d\n\nEcotyon- A rainforest planet that has the richest amount of life than any other world, being a wildlife sanctuary guarded heavily by the AHC, having vibrant colorful rainforests, active weather and storms, flooded landscapes, and a highly-oxygenated atmosphere. The planet has 2 large supercontinents and a global ocean. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 38hr:515d\n\nAllometa- A coniferous planet that has long-spanning forests, a green sky filled with small amounts of radon, active weather, and a large amount of wildlife. This is a country colony of the SSA where they want to get away from a techie society and back into nature and make a better living. The planet has 125 small lakes surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 40hr:524d\n\nHuxle Ollosk- A wasteland planet that has treacherous storms, underground civilizations, a powerful superstorm on the South Pole, and is a former agriworld for the SSA ruined by a horticultural experiment. All civilization exists underground and despite the difficulty, it's possible to access the planet via spaceship and teleportation. The planet has 12 poisonous oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type II; DC: 41hr:564d\n\nHuxa To- The temperate moon of Huxle Ollosk, and the colony of the last of it's inhabitants before it's ruining. It is a rich agriworld formerly a colony for the Zoaks before their disappearance, serving as a superhabitable agriworld now in use by the SSA. The moon has 4 continents and 2 oceans. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 62d\n\nJulana- A semi-ecumenopolis planet that has flourishing jungles and unsentient animal reserves, vibrant jungle-like treetop cities and flying cities, a deep-blue sky filled with small amounts of actinium, active weather, and a core of pure tin. This was a colony of the SSA built to solve an overpopulation crisis, and it has been economically faulty due to crime and severe speciesist supremacy. The planet has 8 oceans surrounded entirely by metropolitan land. Moons: None; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: NE:581d\n\nIusheater- A moist jungle planet that has alien jungles, a semi-breathable atmosphere, active weather, introduced biota, and small cities. This is a common colony for the SSA to solve a population crisis and is a very successful animal colony that helped for civil rights long ago. The planet has 8 oceans surrounded by 6 continents. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type II; DC: 44hr:598d\n\nCarnifex- A jungle planet that has alien wildlife and flora, a red sky filled with small amounts of neon, red oceans, geothermal wastelands, large rock formations, military colonies, and active weather and storms. this is a colony of the Animal High Command where they train against the most hostile of threats in inhospitable lands. The planet has 8 oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 46hr:642d\n\nCarnara- A moon belonging to Carnifex that actually used to be a mining colony as the system's largest supply of zoobrainium which was stored by the Zoobranians as a reservoir that eventually seeped into the moon until unbalanced modern mining damaged the moon's atmosphere into turning it's uninhabitable to sentient animals under threat of being turned unsentient permanently. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type IV; OT: 25d\n\nKingdra- A Jupiter-like gas giant twice as big as said gas giant that shares a co-orbital configuration with a greenish gas giant called Plaendra. It has a Great Red Spot 10x powerful and bigger than Jupiter's, and helps control asteroid paths in the asteroid belt between it's orbit and Carnara's. Moons: 21; DC: 58hr:1062d\n\nMammallea- A temperate moon belonging to Kingdra that has fauna consisting entirely of mammals, a society based around a mammalian habitat, alien biota, elegant rock formations, a history of three ice ages, underground catacombs, ancient ruins, active weather, massive mountains and elegant landscapes. This is the SSA's capital for mammals and any other animal can live here as long as it doesn't change or defeat the purpose. The environment is suitable for a warm-blooded hibernation/migration-capable creature, and there are hundreds of countries scattered across the world. The moon has 7 continents and 5 oceans. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 342d\n\nAmbhia- A humid rainy temperate moon also belonging to Kingdra that has massive wetlands, villages, oceans, billabongs, swamps, bogs, forests, the weather is extremely active and strong, there are large rock and geothermal formations, underground aquifers, a green sky filled with radon, land reefs and planimals, and the dominant wildlife is amphibians. This is the SSA's capital for amphibians and the landscape is suitable for them, and any other animal can live here as long as it doesn't change or defeat the purpose. The society is Teadr 2, but in a near-similar appearance to Naboo. The moon has 17 small continents, over 20,000 islands, and 5 oceans. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; OT: 362d\n\nReptolla- A hot and humid terrestrial jungle moon also belonging to Kingdra that has a prehistoric alien landscape, extremely hot temperatures, rocky, toxic, volcanic, and geothermal formations and wastelands, orgaliths, extremely active weather and storms, and boney graveyards. This is the SSA's capital for reptiles as the environment is suitable for cold-blooded animals that thrive in heat, and can cope in humid environments. Thus the world is populated by lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodilians, and dinosaurs. The moon has a large supercontinent, 16,060 islands and a global ocean. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 404d\n\nBirdia- A windy and stormy moon also belonging to Kingdra that has massive flying islands, continents, and mountains levitated by magnetanium, massive cloudy skies, powerful weather and storms, an uncharted barren surface of twisted alien landscapes, and royal-style civilizations. This is the SSA's capital for birds and is very suitable for creatures that can fly, especially since the moon's gravity is weaker than any other normal world. The moon has 818 lakes surrounded entirely by land, and over 5,000 flying islands and 51 flying continents. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type I; OT: 450d\n\nInsectra- A terrestrial desert jungle moon also belonging to Kingdra that has massive concentrations of oxygen in the air that despite making the air volatile to storms, also makes insects and arthropods larger. There are also complex and massive rock, lava, toxic, and geothermal formations and wastelands, active weather, alien jungles and insect-hill/hive-like cities. This is the SSA's capital for insects and arthropods, and they have built their civilizations out of garbage donated commonly for insect civilizations, among the hive-like buildings and hills and the underground catacombs. The environment is well suitable to them and many of the civilizations fit the scale of certain species. The planet has 54 lakes surrounded entirely by land. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; OT: 481d\n\nFishra- An ocean moon also belonging to Kingdra that has colossal reefs and underwater habitats, biota, trenches, has an uninhabited ocean surface where land rarely exists, the water is filled with nurturing life-giving chemicals, and civilizations similar to Naboo, Atlantis in it's many variants, and other underwater civilizations. This is the SSA's capital for fishes and is suitable for them in every way. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 518d\n\nInvertegra- An island moon also belonging to Kingdra which has a collection of islands and island continents, reefs both land and sea, alienated landscapes, geothermal, toxic, volcanic and rocky formations and wastelands, extremely active weather and storms, thermal shifts, underground catacombs and aquifers, alien forests and jungles, and a core of pure hydrogen. This is the SSA's capital for invertebrates such as worms, mollusks, cnidarians, poriferans, echinoderms, etc. as the ecosystem is suitable for them, as their civilizations are similar to Seaquestria, Naboo, and Atlantis in it's many variants. The moon has 18,590 islands, 12 small continents, and a global ocean. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 541d\n\nPlantaea- An superhabitable yet uninhabited moon belonging to Kingdra that is an agriworld nurtured in orbit by SSA agricultural orbital stations to act as a codex for all plants across the AUU for sentient animals in the system and beyond, as the entire moon is a global greenhouse and the only inhabitants are pollinators. The moon has 16 oceans surrounded entirely by organic superarable land. DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; OT: 555d\n\nFunger- A superhabitable and yet uninhabited moon belonging to Kingdra that is the same as Plantaea, but for fungi, as the world's artificial fungal ecosystem is 75% self-sustaining as the fungi and the plants they inhabitant are symbiotic, thus allowing the SSA orbital agricultural stations little requirements to take care of it. The moon's ecosystem is not breathable because of the infectious fungi that could make unprotected visitors sick, as pollinators of the plants here are genetically engineered. DT: Tier 3; AT: Type III; OT: 602d\n\nProtozenea- An island moon belonging to Kingdra that is actually a heavy breeding ground of microorganisms, including protozoans, phytoplankton, bacteria, algae, etc. that have turned the moon into a Precambrian-Cambrian paradise of stromatolites, algae grasses, and colored habitats that can be found in even the most inhospitable and dangerous places on the moon. The microorganisms here are also sentient and formed global microscopic cities that make the ecosystem look more complex and artificial than before, thus entry on the moon is forbidden without control such as an astral projection or a suitable scale such as through shrink rays, as well as respiratory support since the omnic concentration of gases on the planet which are byproducts of the sentient microbe civilization make the atmosphere poisonous. The moon has 8 continents and 5 oceans. DT: Tier 4; AT: Type III; OT: 645d\n\nGromber- A terrestrial planet that has colorful random environments. Said long ago to be the abduction destination for rogue Zoobranians during a rogue experiment on witnessing sentient animals for hundreds of trials, the world housed sentient animal colonies that still exist to this day since the Zoobranians' extinction. The planet has 18 continents, and 8 oceans. Moons: 2; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 52hr:691d\n\nZoana- A tundrous stormy planet that has a powerful superstorm and yet sustainable biota, as it had been a world that the Zoobranians used for tough climate training as their military capital. The planet has 45 small oceans surrounded entirely by frozen land. Moons: None; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type II; DC: NE:742d\n\nAtlerendra- A near-dwarf ice planet that has a sustainable amount of life, a breathable atmosphere, rich amounts of rarium and cryonite. The planet has formerly been a mining colony for the Zoobranians until it was exhausted, and later became the same for the SSA in modern times when the resources regenerated. Moons: None; DT: Tier 4; AT: Type III; DC: NE:809d\n\nTrol System\n\nTrotron- An ocean island planet similar to Namek and the only inhabited world in a system of a normal sun, is like a Mini-Neptune (Mini-Nepiton in AUU terms), has a surface covered with 98.67% water, several small islands with blue plants, a green-blue sky filled with small amounts of radon and xenon, active storms and weather, large clouds, and the oceans have expansive alien-like kelp forests with colorful kelp and seaweed that must remain buoyant to sustain themselves, and a high amount of single-celled organisms similar to Valonia ventricosa called Trotrers. This was reportedly a world where a sentient single-celled race was found, but such was deemed a myth once the humans made it one of their top colonies, mainly for underwater farms and agriculture. The planet has 109 continent-like islands, 1,450 islands, and 5 oceans. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 1; AT: Type I; DC: 28hr:620d\n\nCorllig System\n\nAiltla- A desert planet which is a partially-inhabited world filled with criminals, has ancient Teadr 1 ruins, large rock and lava formations, dull-colored flora and zooplantae, alien-like fauna, a colorful sky due to it's small amount of noble gases, and strong weather. This was a colony for the extinct Teadr 1 Uridians, and was later colonized by Corollians, who established shipyards, vehicle depots, weapon factories, and sentries who scavenge for lost Uridian technology. Some Corollians here became criminals, establishing a large population of bandits, pirates, and smugglers who do work even off-planet. The planet has 19 small oceans surrounded entirely by land. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 3; AT: Type I; DC: 20hr:297d\n\nGolha- A semi-temperate desert planet which has a purple sky due to it's small amount of nitrogen, it's large lava and rock formations, it's geothermal and toxic valleys, it's massive amounts of introduced fauna and flora, and for having much less Uridian ruins than Ailtla. This world was not just a colony for the Uridians, but later on the Zyauar Masters, who utilized Uridian technology to it's fullest here until they died out. Now, it is inhabited by sentient animals that have formed a Chinese-like culture as they used found Zyauar Master technology to build a powerful guard and a powerful empire, as the Emperor is magically and cybernetically augmented. To this day, they attempt to build a new Zyauar Colony with little success as some consider the technology sacred, including descendants of actual Zyauar Masters. The Corollians have unfortunately brought smugglers and crime lords here to profit from the Uridian/Zyauar technology, yet they hardly succeeded due to the power of the empire's royal guard. Wars have occurred here before against Golhans and Corollians, yet the USRA did what it could to calm these conflicts. The planet has 5 large continents and a moderately-large global ocean. Moons: 1; DT: Tier 2; AT: Type I; DC: 22hr:305d\n\nCorollia- A temperate planet that has wildlife introduced from Marbon, a sky consisting of mercury instead of xenon, large rock and lava formations, rolling hills, dense forests, lush fields, vast seas, beaches, beautiful shores, mountain peaks, and crystal swamps. The planet also features urban terrain, is designated as an industrial world, and is considered a highly-developed planet. It used to be a human colony until it was abandoned by them due to an AUU Third Cartoonian War battle until it was recolonized and made into a USRA planet populated mostly by the dominant races, becoming the first and capital of the Corllig Five-Twin Planets Government system (CFT"
