The base outer shell is comprised of air mesh with built-in protectors and on top of that, a GORE-TEX waterproof outer shell can be used during rides in cold or wet weather. This new two-layer system provides maximum versatility and comfort in any season or any weather conditions.\n\nDuring rides in Spring/Summer or warmer temperatures, the class AA CE-certified air mesh layer will keep you cool and comfortable; allowing air to flow toward the body. The air mesh motorcycle jacket is equipped with our position-adjustable CE-level 2 SEEFLEX protectors at the elbows as well as a CE-level 2 SEESOFT back protector. An extra upgrade can easily be made by adding our CE-Level 1 chest protectors. The detachable kidney belt provides stability and protection to the lower back area. Additionally, a hydration bag can be fitted in the pocket around back.\n\nWhen the weather takes a turn for the worse or for when you’re intentionally riding in colder and wet climates, the waterproof 3L GTX laminated shell can be added on top of the air mesh motorcycle jacket, providing maximum waterproofing and weather protection. This waterproof shell is level B CE-certified and combined with the AA Air mesh layer it offers the highest level of protection in our adventure collection. Ventilation zippers on the front, back, and upper arms will direct airflow to your body when the sun is beaming down. The detachable hood - which protects your neck against the elements during riding - can be stored in the XL back pocket when not needed.\n\nTake on any adventure in any weather with the Stratum GTX motorcycle jacket.\n\nCOMFORT FEATURES\n\nAdjustability:\n\nAdjustable elbow protection\n\nAdjustment drawcord at hem\n\nAdjustment drawcord at waist\n\nAdjustment tab at cuffs\n\nAdjustment tab at lower arm\n\nelasticated cuff\n\nElasticated waist\n\nPockets:\n\nSleeve pocket\n\nSlit pocket at back\n\nSlit pocket at chest\n\nTwo inner pockets\n\nTwo slit pockets on front\n\nTwo waterproof inner pockets\n\nTwo waterproof slit pockets on front\n\nXL storage pocket\n\nLining:\n\n3D mesh\n\nMesh\n\nFeatures:\n\nAdjustment drawcord at hood\n\nDetachable hood\n\nDetachable kidney belt\n\nDouble front zipper\n\nExternal hang loop\n\nShort connection zipper\n\nSoft edge at collar\n\nStretchable cuff\n\nStretch at back\n\nStretch at elbows\n\nStretch at shoulders\n\nTIZIP® waterproof front zipper\n\nCLIMATE FEATURES\n\nWaterproofing:\n\n3L GORE-TEX fabric\n\nVentilation:\n\nPanels inside arms\n\nVentilation panel behind center front zipper\n\nVentilation panels on back\n\nZipper at center front\n\nZipper at upper back\n\nZippers on upper arms\n\nPROTECTION FEATURES\n\nProtection:\n\n3D mesh protector pockets\n\nPrepared for SEESOFT™ CE-level 1 Divided Insert Chest Protector\n\nProtective print at elbows\n\nSEEFLEX™ CE-level 2 Elbow Protectors\n\nSEEFLEX™ CE-level 2 Shoulder Protectors\n\nSEESOFT AIR CE Level 2 on back\n\nThumb loops\n\nOuter shell material:\n\n3L GORE-TEX nylon 400D fabric\n\n3L GORE-TEX Pro Armacor fabric\n\n3L nylon 200D GORE-TEX fabric\n\nNeoprene\n\nPolyester mesh\n\nPWR|Shell mesh\n\nPWR|Shell ripstop stretch\n\nPWR|Shell stretch\n\nVisibility:\n\nLaminated reflection at front\n\nLaminated reflection at upper arms\n\nLaminated reflection on back\n\nLaminated reflection on hood\n\nLaminated reflective logo on back\n\nNOTE: Due to manufacturer restrictions, this item cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Canada.\n\nIt’s a daunting task when trying to improve upon the pinnacle motorcycle jacket of our adventure collection, but we made it happen.

Thanks to the combination of waterproof CORIUM+® leather on the arms and the breathable 3L CORIUM+® textile laminate on the body of the motorcycle jacket, you are always fully protected from the elements. A detachable thermal liner will keep you warm while riding in colder temperatures. And to improve your comfort level even more, we added a detachable storm collar to keep away the wind and rain from your neck.\n\nWhen the temperatures start to rise while riding, you can easily direct cool air to your upper body with the help of our VCS|Aquadefence ventilation system. Just open up the flaps on the chest and secure them with the magnetic Fidlock® system. All of this can be done with one hand while riding. By opening the ventilation zippers on the back, the warm air from inside the jacket can easily escape, helping to keep your upper body at the ideal temperature.\n\nRain or shine, cold or warm, it doesn’t really matter.

It would be a jacket designed for long-distance, metropolitan commuters that ride 365 days a year on two wheels, in any type of weather imaginable. Mission: Accomplished.\n\nThe laminated GORE-TEX® outer shell is extremely breathable and, as you would expect, 100% waterproof. Being a laminated outer shell, the water pick-up is virtually non-existent, so the jacket stays dry and lightweight all the time. This plays a huge role in preventing hypothermia during winter or colder rides. When used without the included thermal liner, there’s an unsurpassed breathability making this jacket comfortable to wear in warmer conditions. Thus, you have here an almost four-season jacket, with the exception of extreme heat.\n\nUnparalleled, on-demand airflow is provided by our patented VCS|aquadefence ventilation system, conveniently positioned at the chest, yet nicely integrated into the design. Hot and humid air that could potentially get trapped inside the jacket can easily escape through the air outlet vents around back. In terms of protection, the Trench GTX jacket has got it all. SEEFLEX™ CE-level 2 armor is found at the elbows and shoulders, and it’s also prepared for the SEESOFT™ CE-level 2 back protector.\n\nWant to add a back protector to your jacket?

The bib forms a protective barrier against cold air and moisture which prevents the cooling down of the upper body.\n\nEnsuring your personal items remain close by, these pants now have more storage options thanks to the addition of cargo pockets at the upper legs. During rides in higher temperatures, airflow to the legs is facilitated by our patented VCS|Aquadefence panels that can easily be opened with or without gloves on, and while riding. Armor is provided by SEEFLEX CE-level 2 knee protection and the pants also include the thin and breathable SEESMART CE-level 1 hip protectors.\n\nEnjoy all the road, or road less traveled, has to offer with the multi-season, multi-faceted Dominator 3 GTX pants.\n\n3L GORE-TEX Pro\n\nThe 3-layer (3L) GORE-TEX PRO design utilizes a revolutionary membrane that is specially processed and provides high strength. The membrane is durably bonded to both the rugged outer material and a specially developed robust inner lining. GORE-TEX PRO garments are highly abrasion- and snag-resistant. The 3-layer GORE-TEX PRO laminates also benefit from our Tricot Backer technology. The specially woven lining protects the membrane also from abrasion on the inside and adds to the extreme robustness of the 3-layer laminate system.\n\nNOTE: Due to manufacturer restrictions, this item cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Canada.\n\nTop-spec, waterproof, CORIUM+® laminated leather/textile pants for multi-season on-road touring.\n\nTake on any asphalt adventure in any weather with the high-tech and versatile Valve H2O motorcycle pants. We took our time when it came to the design of the Valve H2O pants; to make sure they were created and suitable for all-season riding. Thanks to the combination of waterproof CORIUM+® leather on the hips, knees, and rear and the breathable 3L hydratex waterproof laminate on the body of the pants, you are always fully protected from bad weather.\n\nA detachable thermal liner will keep you warm while riding in colder temperatures. On warmer days you can easily direct cool air to your upper legs with the help of our VCS|Aquadefence system. Just open up the flaps on the legs and secure them with the magnetic Fidlock® system. All of this can be done with one hand, with gloves on, while riding. Don’t compromise comfort and protection during your next touring adventure.\n\nThe Valve H2O motorcycle pants will keep fully protected from the elements during every minute of your adventure tour ride, and help to keep you safe at the same time.\n\nNOTE: Due to manufacturer restrictions, this item cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Canada.\n\nAll-climate adventure travel pants with removable thermal and GORE-TEX liners.\n\nWhen you start traveling, you create new experiences that sometimes go far beyond your imagination. We want to make sure you can fully enjoy these moments by keeping you as comfortable and protected as possible. That is why we designed Defender 3 GTX pants. They’re a versatile pair of rugged pair of pants that are prepared to take on any weather type you may encounter out on the road. To keep you comfortable in cold and wet weather, we equipped them with a removable 3-layer GORE-TEX waterproof liner, along with a removable thermal liner for insulation in colder temperatures.\n\nThe outer shell is equipped with stretch inserts above the knee and under the waist to increase freedom of movement during active riding on or off the road. When the temperature starts to rise while riding, you can easily open the VCS|Ventilation panels on the upper legs and secure them using the magnetic Fidlock® closure. By opening the exhaust vent on the rear of the pocket, you will create a steady flow of air through the pants keeping your upper legs cool and comfortable. Under the rugged outer shell constructed of ripstop material, we installed SEESMART CE-Level 1 hip protectors and height-adjustable SEEFLEX CE-level 2 knee protectors. To increase the abrasion resistance on the high-impact areas of the outer shell we added a protective, multi-layer print to the knee area.\n\nThere are ample storage points so you can bring your essentials including two waterproof slit pockets at the waist and waterproof pockets on the upper legs. These side pockets are equipped with zippers to make sure your belongings stay inside, where they belong. To get the perfect fit to your body you can adjust the straps at the waist and calves. With the hook-and-loop closures on the calves, you can adjust these pants to fit with any motorcycle boots you can think of. Furthermore, these pants are equipped with grip panels at the seat, long and short connection zippers, and reflection on the calves; all incorporated to keep you comfortable and safe when on the road or trails.\n\nNo matter the weather, with the versatile and rugged Defender 3 GTX pants you are fully prepared to experience your next adventure to the fullest.\n\nNOTE: Due to manufacturer restrictions, this item cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Canada.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Sand 4 H2O Ladies are an incredibly versatile pair of female-specific riding pants that will enable the most adventurous riders out there to explore the best roads and trails of the world on two wheels, in any environment, in any season.
