        "text": "Prior to spending time with this new Blueberry Esterbrook Estie SE, here’s what popped into my head when I heard the name Esterbrook:\n\nThose iconic vintage J-series fountain pens that accept a multitude of Esterbrook nibs;\n\nThat 2014 “rebirth” of the Esterbrook brand by Robert Rosenberg that did not seem to go particularly well.\n\nI have a couple of vintage Esterbrooks but they haven’t, as yet, found a true place in my heart. I suspect that I need to explore the various vintage nib offerings and find one that really speaks to me. I look forward to that eventual deep dive. I won’t rehash the issue with that first re-launch of the brand, but it left something of a bad taste in my mouth for the “new” Esterbrook.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. In 2018, Joel Blumberg, Kenro’s founder and president, acquired the rights and patents for the brand and relaunched Esterbrook the right way, by honoring the vintage spirit of the brand with fresh designs and quality workmanship. THIS re-birth, I’m happy to say, is cause for celebration.\n\nI’ve been using this Blueberry Estie SE with silver trim (it’s also available with gold trim) the last couple of weeks for writing my morning pages, and I’m enjoying it very much. It’s the pen I reach for despite having several others inked and at the ready. The look, the feel, the writing performance are all on point. SE stands for “Special Edition,” as this pen is limited to 500 pieces, equally split between the gold and silver trim models, but are not numbered.\n\nThe blue “cracked ice” acrylic is highly polished so the pen is extremely smooth to the touch. Finishing is superb. I have absolutely no complaints with fit or finish. This particular acrylic looks a little more gray in indirect light, while the blue pops in brighter light. There’s shimmer and depth and a lot of visual interest in this material.\n\nMy pen is outfitted with a medium #6 JoWo steel nib that lays down a true medium line. I’ve experienced no hard starts or skips. It was a great performer right out of the box, which is never a given. The nib starts up easier than I do every morning at 4:45 am. It’s reliable and smooth. Very pleasant.\n\nA “cushion cap closure” inside the pen’s cap prevents the nib from drying out, which is why the pen always hits the page running. I filled the included converter with Montblanc’s Leo Tolstoy, one of my favorite inks and a great match for this acrylic.\n\nCapped, the pen measures 5.9″. Unposted, it’s a very comfortable 5″, while posted, it’s a very long 6.7″ (feels like a saber). Overall weight is 24 grams. I find it to be very comfortable, neither too light nor too heavy.\n\nNow here’s where things get really cool. The Estie can be outfitted with an MV Nib Adapter (available separately) which is designed to hold many of those vintage Esterbrook nibs. As I said earlier, that’ll be a fun rabbit hole to explore.\n\nBranding is minimal, and the highly polished clip does its job, without interrupting the clean look of the pen. (The flag you see on the clip in the above photo is just a reflection of one on my patio. This thing is like a mirror.)\n\nThough I came to the Esterbrook Estie with some skepticism, I find myself impressed with this offering, and look forward to future releases of different models and materials. As a lover of fall colors, the new Honeycomb Estie is right up my alley. What a beautiful autumnal acrylic.\n\nEsterbrook’s manifesto states: We want to reconnect with consumers, rebuild interest in fine writing and penmanship, revolt against the decline of handwriting in American schools, reestablish brand image as America’s Original, regain trust and market share with retailers, and revive the values and spirit of Richard Esterbrook for the 21st century.\n\nIf this Blueberry Estie SE is any indication, Esterbrook is a brand to get excited about once again.\n\nThanks to Pen Chalet for providing this pen for review purposes. This review represents my own impressions and experiences with the pen. There are no affiliate links in this review.\n\nI think I’ll just cut to the chase. I love this pen. The end.\n\nKidding.\n\nThere’s a little more to the story and the pen.\n\nOn a recent episode of The Pen Addict podcast, during an ad for Pen Chalet, Myke and Brad mentioned that Ron was running a great deal on the Monteverde Tool pens. Since I was listening in my car, I made mental note to check out the sale once I got home. And, wow, were they right…the price was awesome ($20-something, down from a regular retail price of $45). BUT—do I need another pen?\n\nHonestly, no.\n\nI’ve curtailed my pen buying this year as I have so much that I enjoy using already. Saying “no” has become easier and easier the more I do it. (The same restraint does not hold true for inks. Or paper.)\n\nAs I scrolled through the Tool pen models, my thinking went something like this…\n\n“Ballpoint. Nope…I’ve got plenty.”\n\n“Pencil. Nah.”\n\n“Fountain. All set there.”\n\n“What??!! Inkball?? Hmmmmm….”\n\nThe Monteverde Inkball Tool Pen is not a conventional rollerball pen, though that’s what the tip looks and acts like. This version of the Tool Pen takes international short cartridges—the kind you’d normally use in a fountain pen—rather than your typical rollerball refill. NOW I was intrigued as this little twist brought something new to the pen table. (Pen table?)\n\nThere are plenty of great color options, but the orange and black one called my name, as orange and black often does. Two days later, I had the pen in hand.\n\nI had an empty short international cartridge on hand, so I immediately filled it with Robert Oster’s Fire & Ice, a current favorite.\n\nAnd then I couldn’t figure out how to install the cartridge. Or how to get the included cartridge out of the barrel. I’d unscrewed the front black section, the writing tip, but the opening in the barrel was too small to get the included cartridge out or my newly filled cartridge in. What the…?!\n\nBaffled, I emailed Ron to ask him what I was doing wrong. Then headed out to run some errands and to grab lunch.\n\nAs I sat in Applebee’s waiting for my lunch, I suddenly remembered the video overview on Pen Chalet’s page and watched that again. Ohhhhhhhhh, THAT’S what I was doing wrong! Instead of unscrewing the black section holding the tip, you have to grab that section and yank it straight out of the pen. Now the barrel opening was large enough for the included cartridge to be removed from the barrel, and I was able to install my refilled cartridge. Back in business. (A side note: Ron answered my email right around the time I discovered my error. Much appreciated.) As they say, when all else fails, follow directions.\n\nWith that “user error” dilemma conquered, I put pen to paper—Tomoe River Paper, to be exact. Oh, my. What a smooth and lovely writing experience.\n\nI spent the afternoon hunkered down in our Barnes & Noble café writing letters with this pen, rarely looking up. Immersed, is what I was. Immersed and impressed.\n\nThe tip runs fairly broad, but is perfect on Tomoe River Paper—like a good medium. The performance is excellent. Smooth and skip-free. I love the way the rollerball feels, and I like seeing my favorite ink flowing out of a rollerball-style tip. The barrel is enameled brass, which gives the pen a nice weight (37 grams). As a point of reference, a Lamy Safari weighs about 16 grams, and a Lamy AL-Star weighs 21 grams, so this pen runs about twice as heavy. Despite that, I’ve never experienced hand-fatigue, but maybe that’s because I lift weights on a regular basis and I’m strong like bull (I wish).\n\nBut, wait…there’s more!\n\nThe Monteverde Tool Pen includes a number of additional features. The barrel, as you can see, contains a 4-inch ruler as well as three metric scale rulers—1:100, 1:200, and 1:300. Those are pretty obvious.\n\nThe Tool Pen’s endcap is a stylus that works well on my iPhone and Kindle. Unscrew the stylus to reveal a tiny flathead screwdriver. This screwdriver insert can be removed and flipped around to access the Phillips head screwdriver.\n\nShould you need to repair a teeny-tiny thing, you’re all set.\n\nAlong with the rulers, the barrel also contains a level, so you can verify that your café table is indeed perfectly level.\n\nThe one downside to the pen is the fact that the small black cap that covers the writing tip cannot be posted. When you’re using the pen, you have to keep track of this piece. So far, that hasn’t been an issue, but if you’re prone to losing things, keep this in mind.\n\nYou might call this a “novelty” pen, and I’d have to, for the most part, agree. Will I ever use the screwdrivers or the level? Probably not, though you never know. The rulers may come in handy now and then. (Edited to add: If it had a little shovel, this pen would’ve come in very handy the past two days as I’ve been trapped in the house by three feet of snow, while Fred was literally stuck at work.) Despite what may seem like gimmicks, this is a pen that delivers a really cool writing experience coupled with an interesting look and potentially useful tools. And let’s not forget that you can use any fountain pen ink as long as you have an empty international short cartridge to refill. (I don’t believe that a conventional converter will fit, though I haven’t confirmed this.)\n\nI really do love this pen. The end. For real, this time.\n\nThis One Touch Stylus 9 Function Tool Pen was purchased with my own funds. The sale at Pen Chalet appears to be over, but you can still find this pen (as well as the other models/colors) at a good price at Pen Chalet. I was in no way compensated for this review. In fact, it’ll come as a surprise to Ron. If you’re a listener of the Pen Addict podcast, you already know that Pen Chalet often sponsors the show and provides codes for listener-only discounts and special sales. If you’re not a listener of the podcast, what’re you waiting for?\n\nSimple tree\n\nI had planned to get a post up last week, but then I caught a cold (unexpected) and Christmas arrived (expected). One thing was fun, the other not so much. Slowly coming out of my sinus miseries and low-key Christmas celebrations to think about getting things back to normal. Well, normalish.\n\nBaking molasses cookies. Or as I call them, mole asses cookies.\n\nI’m off from work for most of the week— just have to pop in on Friday for a little while— so every day feels like Saturday lately. Which is what I imagine heaven feels like.\n\nMy festive Retro 51s\n\nA couple of feelings routinely kick in this time of year, as one year ends and the other begins. The first is gratitude. Thanks for all of the good stuff and good people that I’ve encountered in the last year, much of it related to pens (and paper and ink and pencils) and the pen/pencil communities. These are the places where I feel most comfortable, where my introverted tendencies vanish, where I have a blast.\n\nKaras Kustoms Retrakt\n\nThough not a complete list by any means, these are just some of the people and places who made 2014 a memorable year:\n\nPodcasts/Videocasts\n\nThe Pen Addict with Brad and Myke (responsible for oh so many pen purchases and for an always entertaining commute)\n\nThe Erasable Podcast with Andy, Johnny, and Tim (Who would’ve thought I’d listen to a show about pencils? I do, and I love it.)\n\nAnderson Pens (Oh, that chat! It’s like meeting with friends every time I tune in.)\n\nSBREBrown & Gourmet Pens & the “I won’t be ignored” kitty (Great information with great humor. You guys rock.)\n\nPen, pencil, ink, notebook, and storage vendors\n\nAnderson Pens\n\nDudek Modern Goods\n\nEdison Pen Co.\n\nField Notes\n\nFontoplumo\n\nThe Goulet Pen Co.\n\nJetPens\n\nKaras Kustoms\n\nLevenger\n\nNock Co.\n\nPen Chalet\n\nThe Pen Company\n\nRetro 1951\n\nWrite Notepads & Co.\n\nThanks to some for supplying review items, to others for great customer service, and to all for great products and that extra-special personal touch.\n\nMy nib guy\n\nDan Smith @fpgeeks\n\nThanks for making less than stellar pens remarkable, quickly and affordably. Great work!\n\nPenpals\n\nTracy Lee\n\nMichelle\n\nThank you for understanding when I TAKE SO LONG TO REPLY. Your letters and cool envelopes are a source of delight in my mailbox. So glad we’re getting to know each other better while using our pens and inks.\n\nBloggers, Tweeters, Facebookers\n\nI won’t name names because I’ll leave someone out then feel bad, but you all entertain and educate me, amuse and enlighten. This is the BEST community.\n\nBest hotel\n\nThe Sheraton at Tysons Corner for returning my “left behind” Akkerman ink after the DC Pen Show. Amazing customer service. So grateful.\n\nPencil line-up\n\nThe other feeling that kicks in this time of year is “fresh start.” Old year out, new year in. Time to purge, reorganize, and start with a blank(ish) slate. Fred and I regularly purge and straighten out our pantry during our break between Christmas and New Year’s. Annual ritual. Afterwards, we vow to use what we have on hand before adding more stuff to the cupboards.\n\nConklin Stylograph (to be reviewed)\n\nIn that same vein, I plan to make 2015 a year where I buckle down and USE my pens, pencils, papers, and inks— switching my focus from acquisition to using. When you have a Staples Printer Paper box full of empty notebooks, it might be time to stop buying notebooks and start writing in them. Like every day. Don’t get me wrong, I use my stuff but I need to REALLY use my stuff. There’s plenty here to be written in and written with, plenty to be reviewed, plenty to have fun with. Plenty.\n\nMachined favorites\n\nSo I’m closing out 2014 and starting 2015 feeling grateful and blessed. And you— all of you— are the reason.\n\nPeace and good health to you all.\n\nWrite Notepads & Co. loot\n\nMany thanks to Ron, at Pen Chalet, for sending along this Conklin Duragraph fountain pen. I was not compensated for my review, and this post reflects my experiences with the pen. There are no affiliate links in this post.\n\nThe Conklin box is a little coffinesque, but it holds a very nice pen.\n\nThe Conklin Duragraph originally launched in 1923. I won’t pretend to know much (or anything, really) about the history of the Duragraph line, but I was intrigued by the appearance of this recently released updated version. The look is distinctly vintage, with rich-looking resins and a flat-top cap. Branding is quite simple. The center band sports the words “Conklin” and “Duragraph,” bracketed by two sets of three tiny crescents. The flat-top is imprinted with “Conklin Est. 1898.”\n\nI own a few Conklin fountain pens— all crescent fillers— and while I enjoy them, cleaning them is something of a chore. It takes A LOT of filling and flushing to clean the internal “bladder” of those pens. The Duragraph is cartridge/converter pen which means that it’s simple to fill and to clean. The pen ships with two cartridges AND the converter. (I love when the converter is included.)\n\nI filled my Cracked Ice version with Pilot Iroshizuku tsuki-yo, and set pen to paper. The stub nib on this Conklin Duragraph is smooth and plenty juicy, but not overly so. My other Conklin pens have equally smooth nibs (that’s 4 for 4), so I’ve either been lucky or nib QC is quite good. Flow is perfect— neither too dry or too wet.\n\nAvailable in Amber, Cracked Ice, and Forest Green versions, I was initially drawn to the Amber version (fall colors are kind of my “thing”), but decided to branch out a bit and chose the Cracked Ice resin. I haven’t seen the other finishes in person, and I’m sure they’re great looking, but, to me, the Cracked Ice resin accentuates the vintage roots of the pen. It looks like a pen my grandfather would’ve used— sort of understated, but still interesting— like a pen made from crushed sea shells.\n\nThe stainless steel nib is available in fine, medium, and this 1.1 mm stub. Though not really suitable for me as a daily writer, the stub gives my handwriting more flair than it normally has, even though I’m not particularly proficient with it. I’ve never experienced a hard start or any skipping. I’m really pleased with the flow and the feel of the writing experience. It’s silky smooth.\n\nThis is a pen that’s meant to be used unposted. Though it’s possible to post the cap, it doesn’t post securely at all (the cap could/would definitely wiggle off), AND extends the pen to an unwieldy feeling 6.9″ (175 mm). Capped, the pen measures 5.9″ (140 mm). Unposted, it measures 4.9″ (124 mm), which feels fine in my hand, but might be a bit short if your hands are very large. The concave grip gives my fingers the perfect resting place for writing and doodling. The capped pen weighs 26 grams— sort of a nice “middle-ground” weight. I have NO complaints with anything about the look or the feel of this pen.\n\nThis newly released Conklin Duragraph stays true to its vintage roots without the price tag that can come with a vintage pen. Listing for $55, and available from Pen Chalet for only $44, this is a pen that’s hard to resist. I really can’t get over the price. I suspect that the Amber one is in my future, maybe with a medium nib.\n\nThe Conklin Duragraph is a pen that’s easy to fall for. The cartridge/converter set-up means that it’s easy to maintain, the resins are gorgeous, and the nibs smooth. And that price? What’s not to love?!\n\nCheck out the Conklin Duragraph line at Pen Chalet HERE. You really can’t go wrong."
