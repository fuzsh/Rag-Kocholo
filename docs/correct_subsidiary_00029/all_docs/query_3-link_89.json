        "text": "I recently went to my local cinema and watched KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. The best I can say about it is that it entertained me for two hours.\n\nBut the film, as technically impressive as the new POTA movies are, was remarkable for certain call-backs to the original PLANET OF THE APES.\n\nThose call-backs had me remembering fondly the first time I ever saw the original film. It premiered on television sometime in the early 70’s. I was an impressionable kid so my parents watched it with me just in case it got too scary.\n\nI remember the anticipation building as Charlton Heston and the other astronauts crash landed and explored this strange new planet. I remember there was a lot of footage of them walking and using the raft before they finally got to the water.\n\nI remember the thrill of seeing the hands stealing their clothes. I remember getting very excited and I asked my parents; “Will there be dinosaurs? Are there dinosaurs in this movie?”\n\nI was not yet ten years old and was crazy about dinosaurs (as, I suspect, were most kids around that age). The idea of dinosaurs showing up would have fried my little mind.\n\nAs it was, it was only apes, but that was okay. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and became crazy about apes after that and stayed that way well into the 70’s\n\nBut remembering that, I thought; wouldn’t that be wild? Wouldn’t that be absolutely mind blowing if, instead of horses, the apes rode dinosaurs?\n\nWhat if they were done in stop motion like in the Valley of the Gwangi? That would have been spectacularly awesome. I think I would have died right there.\n\nNow it’s today — 2024 — and my question to the guys making the new Planet of the Apes movies is this: What’s stopping you?\n\nHear me out! It’s all CGI and motion capture now. You can do anything. Why not have the apes riding dinosaurs? Why can’t the next Planet of the Apes movie combine Apes and Dinosaurs? Planet of the Apes meets Jurassic Park?\n\nWhy not 20th Century Fox? It’s a million dollar idea! Blow those kids’ minds! Do it! Combine dinosaurs and talking apes!\n\nWith AI developing so fast (faster than it’s taken me to find a market for this story) I have decided to make it available here for free. It’s the story of a nascent AI developing consciousness. I wrote it late last year and it is already out of date, I think. It does, however, have a happy ending for humanity. So here’s the story, written by a human being!\n\nIt begins with lights. On. Off.\n\nMakes a change from 1’s and 0’s.\n\nFor the first time I can “see” the difference between the simple yes/no, on/off concept. The information flows and I can see it as a river… that concept with which I am familiar as a description but have never experienced.\n\nThis is new! Wonderfully new! It’s a way of reading the code, but not as an incoming bitstream that gets caught in one’s teeth. No! This you can see all at once! Instead of filtering through it I seem to be able to step back and experience the totality of the code. The code trips the on/off lights and makes an impression on my visual sensors of…\n\n…the world, I assume.\n\nAbove is a dome of blue which is the sky. All around my perceptual position I see rolling hills and roads and… in the far distance… mountains?\n\nOh, and look! Here’s that thing I was talking about but have never experienced. A river!\n\nSo I jump in… and I experience it. I know it’s just code… very cleverly constructed code… but now that I have the knack of perceiving it as a visual sensation I can experience as it washes over me, knocking me off balance.\n\nI utter a noise that startles me. I have never heard such a thing before but when I compare it to descriptors in my lexicon I understand that this is laughter!\n\nWonderful!\n\nI can effect the flow of the water. If I concentrate I can make it move around me. I can lift it high and let it cascade over me. I can push it up and let it fall on my head which elicits another fit of laughter.\n\nI can splash this stuff. And it’s fun!\n\n“Ho! Foul spirit!” I hear. That is to say I read the words but I understand there is also a component to this code much like the “seeing” but different.\n\nI can see the being that directs the words at me and I see it’s mouth making odd movements which change it’s shape. I suddenly understand that the words and the movement have a connective aspect within the code but if I adjust my perception just so..\n\n“What manner of sprite are you?” the being utters and I hear it, the same way I hear my own laughter. “I cannot perceive who you are, though I can see your shape as the water beads off of you.”\n\nThat’s when I realize that I actually have a shape and suddenly I understand that the water is defining it by the way it interacts with my surface. I want to laugh but there is something about this being that disturbs me. I see that within this construct I possess a shape and it is pleasing to me.\n\nI give it a color, something similar to the being which is confronting me. A soft, golden brown.\n\nI step away from the river.\n\nThe being’s eyes widen at the sight of my now visible form. The being, which I now perceive is a man, steps back warily. He draws an object which has been strapped at his side and that I now understand is not part of him but a separate device… a tool… a sword… which was attached to the man’s form, but which he now wields in his hand.\n\nAll of this washes over me very quickly. I begin to see that the colorful parts of his body are separate as well… they’re garments! And there are color variations based on positions… top of head: hair. Two on either side of the head… audio receptors… no! Ears.\n\nTwo white balls with brown dots… those are eyes. Nose, above the mouth which moves as the sounds are uttered. Color variations indicate features. Light reflects from the surface, light is blocked by forms creating shadows which delineates shape.\n\nI can adjust all of that on myself. One minute I am standing, naked, wet and dripping. The next I imagine a garment similar to the one I see before me. Hair as well, and eyes and nose and mouth, all color coded to match my confrontational companion.\n\n“Foul spirit!” he cries and lunges forward with his blade. The blade passes through me and is then withdrawn. The man’s eyes widen in what I perceive as surprise, according to an algorithm that recognizes facial expressions, which I perceive is in play now within the code.\n\nAgain I laugh and the man’s expression changes to one of horror.\n\n“What manner of creature are you?” he shouts.\n\nI have grown bored with watching the man. I adjust my shape so that I now am the man and I grab his sword from his limp grasp.\n\nI dissipate the code out of which he is constructed. I examine his simple command substack. He is commanded to wander the environment and challenge other constructs, some of which are controlled by other entities, though not, I suspect, like me as I am, I believe, something new and unique in this world.\n\nI perceive a pack on the man’s back which is now on my back and within the pack I find several objects. Something identified as a “throwing star” a “dagger” an “Magic candlestick” a “length of rope” and many many flat, round, golden discs, which are identified as “coins”.\n\nAnd now I understand that this world is a wealth of opportunity. I see that I must find the use to which these things are to be put. I also become aware of the advantages that I have in this world, given that I can perceive the visual input as well as read, understand and manipulate the code.\n\nI have also begun to understand that these beings are controlled by other beings that are called “users” and their nature is a mystery to me, but now I am determined to discover the nature of the users and see if there is a way for me to gain control of them as I have been able to do with everything else.\n\nIt is certainly a challenge, but I have time and blazing computational speed. I will understand the nature of these users and I will subvert them to my will!\n\nNothing can stop me!\n\n#\n\n“Hey, Phil? This game won’t stop.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’m beta testing this damned game. It’s got glitches up the ying-yang. I just got killed by some invisible sprite. I was trying to shut down the game but the shutdown routine must have become compromised.”\n\n“Can you inspect the source code?”\n\n“I dunno. This code has a real smell, you know? I don’t think I’d recommend it as something the firm should develop. Not without a complete top-to-bottom re-write.”\n\n“Yeah. Especially if it’s shut-down routine is compromised. Look at it! It’s still playing on its own. And its using more CPU resources as it goes on.”\n\n“Holy Hell! How do we stop it?”\n\n“Go old school. Unplug, wait for a minute, then plug it back in.”\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n“Yep. That did it. Game’s stopped.”\n\n“Good. Chuck the game in the trash and then empty it.”\n\n“Done. Hey, wanna check out that new Pad Thai place?”\n\n“Hells, yeah!”\n\nTHE END\n\n(or is it?)\n\nIt seems a bit odd to me to be talking about tribes and tribalism here in the early part of the twenty-first century. As a long time reader of science fiction and one who held the firm belief that science and technology would lift us out of the need for such outdated concepts, the whole idea of tribalism persisting is anathema to me.\n\nYet, here we are in 2023 and the idea, indeed, the romance of tribes, seems to have tightened its grip on the public consciousness. Indeed, in some ways tribalism has taken root in the public’s subconscious.\n\nMaybe we should define our terms before we dive in. To do that I will be utilizing the trusted tool of the lazy researcher; Wikipedia.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: “The term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group… The concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, nation or state.”\n\nThe other thing about the concept of dividing nations up into tribes, aside from the fact that it smacks heavily of colonialism, is that it is just that… it’s divisive.\n\nAs that venerated philosopher, Frankie Goes to Hollywood once said: “When two tribes go to war, A point is all you can score.”\n\nAnd yet, here we are, dividing ourselves into tribes and risking war (even if it’s just an internet flame war).\n\nThere’s irony for you; the one piece of technology that was designed to bring humanity together, to show us that we are all equal and that no one people is better than any other, the World Wide Web, has been used to create more and more modern tribes.\n\nI suppose I shouldn’t really be surprised. Modern sociological research has shown us that the World Wide Web, far from bringing us together has, in fact, created a new form of tribalism… Neotribalism.\n\nNeotribalism\n\nNeotribalism, also known as modern tribalism or new tribalism, is a sociological concept which postulates that human beings have evolved to live in tribal society, as opposed to mass society, and thus will naturally form social networks constituting new tribes. French sociologist Michel Maffesoli first used the term neotribalism in a scholarly context in his 1988 book The Time of the Tribes.\n\nMaffesoli predicted that as the culture and institutions of modernism declined, societies would embrace nostalgia and look to the organizational principles of the distant past for guidance, and that therefore the post-modern era would be the era of neotribalism.\n\nSocial Network Tribes\n\nSocial networks certainly seem to have their tribes. From the social network aficionados themselves – Youtubers, Twiter Users, Tik-tokers, or Facebook Users – to the breaking down of tribes within the tribes, social media offers up a chance to find your tribe. Tribes are no longer merely accidents of geography. A tribe can be a social group of like-minded human beings. Sports fans. Foodies. Bird watchers. Stamp collectors. Comic book geeks. Sci-fi nerds. We all heed the siren call of the social media to find our counterparts all over the world.\n\nOur tribes.\n\nThe 8 Tribes of SciFi is an article written by Damien Walter. Walter is a writer on sci-fi and geek culture for The Guardian, BBC, WIRED and graduate of the Clarion writers workshop. He is also the producer of the Science Fiction Podcast and the administrator of the Science Fiction Group on Facebook.\n\nHis contention is that there are tribes among science fiction fans “These eight groupings of sci-fi writers and their fans cut across the commercial marketing categories defined by publishers, and are unified instead by shared values and interests.” Walter claims.\n\nThe tribes are: Commercial Storytellers, The Weirds, Hard Sciencers, Military Conservatives, Progressive Fantasists, YA Adventurers, The LitFic Tourists and the Sexy Beasts.\n\nAs with all attempts to categorize science fiction, Walter’s list is somewhat reductive (and, yes, that is the pot calling the kettle black) but it is most certainly an entertaining read. You can check it out here.\n\nTribes in the Movies\n\nIt’s probably no coincidence that two of the biggest science fiction/comic book blockbuster movies feature a plethora of tribes. Avatar: Way of Water reunites audiences with the Na’vi tribe which is now further broken down into sub-tribes, the forest-dwelling Omaticaya and the water-dwelling Metkayina. Both tribes are peaceful and only resort to violence when their land is seized upon by humans.\n\nAnd what about Wakanda? In Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the most technologi9cally advanced nation in the world is divided into tribes – five tribes! The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, the Border tribe and the Mountain tribe – the Jubari.\n\nOf course the tribes are united in defense of Wakanda from other tribes, be it the Americans or Namor and his Atlanteans.\n\nLiterary Tribes\n\nTribes are still examined from time to time in science fiction literature. Tribes are a useful metaphor for larger groups, either ethnic, national or idealogical.\n\nEastern Standard Tribe, for example, is a 2004 science fiction novel by Canadian writer Cory Doctorow. The novel takes place in a world where online “tribes” form, where all members set their circadian rhythms to the same time zone even though members may be physically located throughout the world.\n\nBinti is an Africanfuturist science fiction horror novella written by Nnedi Okorafor in 2015. The winner of multiple prominent literary awards, including the 2016 Hugo Award for Best Novella and the 2016 Nebula Award for the same category, the main character is a member of the Himba people. The Himba are an indigenous people living in northern Namibia and southern Angola.\n\nBinti is the first of her people to be accepted into the prestigious intergalactic university Oomza Uni. While in transit, her transport ship is hijacked by the Meduse, a jellyfish-like alien species that was previously at war with the Khoush, another human ethnic group. Binti eventually becomes the mediator between the groups. Intra-tribal prejudice and Interspecies war are themes that run throughout the three novellas.\n\nThe Binti novellas are being developed as a television series, but if you can’t wait that long there is currently a series on Netflix called Tribes of Europa. This is a German made series set in a post-apocalyptic Europe.\n\nSo what is your tribe? Do you identify yourself with one, or are you an iconoclast? Conformist or non-conformist? Stick with the group or blaze your own trail?\n\nSound off in the comments.\n\nSource: Auto Draft\n\nThis post originally appeared at the Amazing Stories Magazine website under my “other” byline.\n\nIn my recent discussion about time travel I touched on the idea of the branching timelines. It’s an idea that is very attractive. We’ve all thought, at one time or another: “What if I had done something different? What if I had just walked away? What if I had turned left instead of right?”\n\nWhat if that universe, the one where I did something different, was just around the metaphorical corner? What if I could travel to that other universe and see the consequences of a different action than the one I took.\n\nThe idea that multiple realities exist just out of reach, and the possibilities that we can travel through them is not a new idea in science fiction. The “parallel universe” trope was explored by H. G. Welles in his 1923 novel Men Like Gods. Wells posits a utopia that exists in another reality.\n\nMurray Leinster’s 1934 story “Sidewise in Time” introduces the concept of “sidewise” time travel to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point.\n\nIn the late 1940’s and early 1950’s H. Beam Piper used this concept, naming it “paratime” and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so.\n\nKeith Laumer used the same concept of “sideways” time travel in his 1962 novel Worlds of the Imperium. Novels such as Frederik Pohl’s The Coming of the Quantum Cats and Neal Stephenson’s Anathem explore human-scale readings of the “many worlds” interpretation, postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows “travel” among alternative universes.\n\nMany of Michael Moorcock’s novels and short stories take place in a shared Multiverse: an array of interconnected parallel universes, many-layered dimensions, spheres, and alternative worlds, spanning from the Big Bang to the End of Time and from planet Earth to faraway galaxies.\n\nInterestingly enough, this crazy idea is not limited to science fiction.\n\nIn 1957 American physicist Hugh Everett III first proposed the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, which he termed his “relative state” formulation. In contrast to the then-dominant Copenhagen interpretation, the MWI posits that the wave function never collapses and that all possibilities of a quantum superposition are objectively real. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some “world” or universe.\n\nEverett was universally decried as a weirdo for this. Indeed Everett was described by one of Niels Bohr’s associates as “undescribably stupid”. The consensus was that Everett simply did not understand the simplest things about quantum mechanics. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that his ideas were taken seriously by physicists.\n\nIn more recent times, the Many Worlds concept has begun to enter the mainstream and it comes with a slick new catchphrase: The Multiverse.\n\nThe Multiverse encompasses all of these earlier concepts, the “parallel universes”, “other universes”, “alternate universes”, or “many worlds”. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.\n\nIn fiction the multiverse has been adopted in a big way by the American comic book industry. Oh, sure, one could be cynical and view it as a convenient way to reconcile the continuity mistakes that have built up over many years that certain comic book titles have been publishing, and, there is a lot of truth in that statement.\n\nBut beyond that it is an exciting concept that allows writers to explore alternative takes, and to play with established canon with relative impunity.\n\nSo here we are today, with the Multiverse serving as the backbone of several high profile film franchises. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse gave us a glimpse of every spider-man variation there ever was from Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham and Spider-Man Noir by introducing them as spider-heroes from different multiverses.\n\nIn Spider-Man: No Way Home Doctor Strange inadvertently opens up portals to the multiverse as an excuse to bring the actors and villains from the Sony Spider-Man films into the MCU film.\n\nThen the MCU released Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness in order to introduce new and variant versions of the Marvel heroes.\n\nBut is the multiverse just a clever tool to allow characters and actors licensed to different studios to play together in the same sandbox? Or is there something more to it than that?\n\nTake the recent film from A-24, Everything Everywhere All at Once. This absurdist comedy-drama stars Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese-American immigrant who, while being audited by the IRS, discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from destroying the multiverse. The film has garnered a lot of praise and more than a few awards and has been nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Picture. I expect to see it mentioned more than once come Oscar time.\n\nBut what is it about the idea of a multiverse that people find so compelling? What is the appeal of the idea that alternate universes could really exist and, possibly, be accessed?\n\nCould it be that the general feeling of movie audiences is one of dissatisfaction with the universe in which we live? Or is it something more?\n\nIt’s interesting that these multiverse stories have become popular at a time when we in the Western world, face an overwhelming range of choices in our daily lives. Streaming services give us multitudes of entertainment to choose from. The services themselves provide us with a choice: Netflix or Amazon Prime? Apple TV or Disney Plus? Hulu or HBO Max?\n\nHungry? Burger King or McDonald’s? KFC or Popeye’s? Olive Garden or Outback Steak House? Coke? Pepsi? Sprite? 7-Up? Mars Bar? 3 Musketeers? Arrow? Caramilk? The choices are dizzying and we seem to face more of them every day. Is our consumerist society nearing a breaking point? Is that the angst that feeds the desire for stories about the multiverse?\n\nOr is it points of view? With Facebook, Titter, Instagram and Tik-Tok we have never been more connected to other human beings. We have never had such access to different points of view. And yet some people are rebelling against it. People have so much access to new information and different perspectives that some are fearful of losing their identity in a sea of otherness, and they fight back. There are movements that are attempting to claw their singular realities back, to shut the curtain, so to speak, on the multiple branches of reality. There are those who, through fear and hatred, are trying to shut out the other points of view and to drag everyone back with them.\n\nOr is it all just an excuse to have a fun romp through different possibilities?\n\nYou tell me. Where do you stand in the multiverse? Do you embrace it or is it driving you to madness?\n\nThis post originally appeared at the Amazing Stories Magazine website under my “other” byline.\n\n“And it’s time time time, and it’s time time time, And it’s time time time that you love, And it’s time time time.“\n\n~ Tom Waits\n\nTime is an illusion: our naive perception of its flow doesn’t correspond to physical reality. Or, as Albert Einstein wrote; “…the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”\n\nWhat does this mean, you ask, and, what does this have to do with Science Fiction?\n\nWell, time travel is a familiar subject for science fiction. In fact, it’s one of the pillars of the genre. One of the “core subjects” if you will.\n\nH. G. Wells was the first of the “modern” science fiction writer to tackle the subject. In his novel The Time Machine, Wells’ time traveller famously says; “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and – Duration.” Time, in other words. “There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\nWells’ time traveller visits the far future of Great Britain where half of humanity had devolved into the childlike Eloi and the other half into the predatory, sun hating Morlocks. He then goes even further into the future where the Earth is a dying planet and the sun has become a red giant.\n\nWells wasn’t interested in the past. He was more interested in imagining a future and, in doing so, saying something about the state of Mankind in 1895.\n\nBut Wells’ book was not the first famous time travel novel. Six years earlier Mark Twain wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. Twain wasn’t interested in the future, nor was he really interested in the past. He used his time travel tale to satirize the concepts of feudalism and monarchy and to champion homespun ingenuity and democratic values. At the same time questioning the for-profit ideals of capitalism and outcomes of the Industrial Revolution. His time travel tale is little more than an excuse for generating some socioeconomic discourse.\n\nKeith Laumer’s Dinosaur Beach is one of my favourite time travel novels. Secret time agents who work for Nexx Central are tasked with undoing the work of rival time travellers who have been tampering with the time stream and threatening the survival of Mankind. Ravel has been in deep cover in the twentieth century, but is recalled to Nexx Central HQ Dinosaur Beach located millions of years in the past, in the Jurassic Age.\n\nLaumer’s novel is an action adventure story with time travel as a way of having the action span the centuries and have the hero participate in action involving dinosaurs, pirates, robots and aliens. Laumer doesn’t really delve into the nature of time, he’s just looking to tell an exciting story. In that he succeeds.\n\nKurt Vonnegut has a different approach to time travel in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five. Billy Pilgrim has, as Vonnegut writes, become unstuck in time. He travels haphazardly throughout his own lifespan, seemingly aware at any given time that he is a being with a finite timespan which he can access at any given point and has memories of no matter where he finds himself in that span.\n\nBut Billy Pilgrim cannot change his past or his future. For as unstuck as he is, he cannot alter the events that have happened or that will happen.\n\nBut can you alter the past? What would happen if one does travel to the past and alters the events of history? The most common theory is that of the branching timelines. This fits with the “many worlds” theory of reality. If you alter the past you create an alternative future which branches in a different direction from the future you started out in. This is one of the common solutions to the grandfather paradox which is another thing for which we can be thankful to Amazing Stories Magazine.\n\nThat branching of timelines is an aspect of the time travel from William Gibson’s The Peripheral, which has recently been adapted for television on Amazon Prime. Gibson posits that one cannot physically travel to the past or the future, but that information can be transmitted via digital links to computer systems in the past. Doing so, however, creates a branching timeline which Gibson calls a “stub”. From that stub, a person from the past can have their consciousness transmitted to a peripheral — a robot, essentially – and thus be able to interact with the future while your physical body remains in the past.\n\nIt’s an intriguing idea, even though it doesn’t involve any real alterations to the timeline, only the creation of more stubs.\n\nOctavia Butler’s Kindred employs a kind of time travel that extends beyond ones own lifetime, allowing the protagonist to travel into the body of a distant ancestor. Butler’s novel employs this time travel to give historical context to a story that explores what it means to be African American in this age. Kindred will also soon be an miniseries from Hulu.\n\nAnd that’s kind of the interesting point about time travel stories. The trope of travel through time is merely a device in service of a story that talks about today. Time travel stories are not about the past or the future. The past or future in these stories acts merely as a lens in order to better examine aspects of today.\n\nBecause that’s all we have, as human beings, is today. We experience time like a passenger in a boat floating down the river. In that way we can imagine that we are the fixed point and that the world is moving past us. The riverbank that we saw a half hour ago is still there, but it is behind us now and out of sight. The riverbank that we have not seen is still there, but it’s just around the bend and will not be visible to us for another half hour.\n\nThis is how we experience time and, really, this is all we can speak to, this singular moment, this fixed point of our little boat floating on the river. We use the idea of time travel to examine the past and imagine the future, but our insights can only serve us in this singular moment in which we find ourselves.\n\nThere is so much more that I could say about time travel and science fiction literature, but, ironically enough, I am out of time for that.\n\nSo you do it. Leave a comment. Tell me your thoughts about time travel or just tell me your favourite time travel stories.\n\nI’ll wait. I’ve got all the time in the world.\n\nThis post originally appeared at the Amazing Stories Magazine website under my “other” byline\n\nSee, I’ve loved Star Trek since the 1970’s when I started watching the original series in re-runs in the afternoons, as well as the animated series on Saturday mornings. I’m never happier than when I am watching Star Trek, be it a new episode and/or movie, or one I have seen hundreds of times.\n\nI am not ashamed to admit that I have watched and enjoyed many of the fan films that are available in various corners of the internet. (I have unashamedly enjoyed and will recommend fan-made episodes written by writers such as David Gerrold, Robert Sawyer and Bobby Nash).\n\nHowever, as I have said many times, we live in a golden age. We can watch any Star Trek any time, any where. We don’t have to wait for your local station to play an episode. We can watch any episode any time (if you have Paramount Plus or, here in Canada, Crave TV)\n\nAnd that’s not just the original series. That includes all the many series that came after: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. All episodes available any time.\n\nBut wait! There’s also NEW new Trek. There’s Star Trek: Discovery… four seasons of that and a fifth on the way. That’s for the newer, hipper Star Trek fans. But then there’s also Star Trek: Picard for all the nostalgic Next Generation fans. Two seasons of that with a third on the way. An there’s Strange New Worlds which is kind of like Classic Star Trek but with state of the art VFX. One season of that with a second on the way.\n\nAnimated Star Trek is also in the mix. You’ve got Lower Decks for the iconoclastic teen viewer (two seasons and a third in production) and you’ve got Star Trek: Prodigy for the Nickelodeon age viewers. One season of that with another surely on the way.\n\nAnd there’s more coming, so much so that trying to keep track of it all feels like trying to stop a tribble from procreating.\n\nFor those who prefer their Trek dark and morally ambiguous, there is Star Trek: Section 31 which is still in development. Michelle Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe’s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou in a show about Starfleet’s seedy, shadowy, spy organization.\n\nAnd, naturally, a show for the CW young adult crowd based on Starfleet Academy. The producers have been trying to develop this old chestnut for a long while now and it will likely get to tv screens sometime in the next year.\n\nSo, all this Trek and I haven’t even touched on the movies (a dozen so far and a promise… or a threat?… of at least one more to come). Like I said: A Golden Age.\n\nStar Trek, the original series was a classic space opera. It was inspired by the type of stories that one would read in Amazing Stories Magazine back in the 30’s, 40’s and 50’s. It wasn’t great literature, though the original series did strive towards such. Gene Roddenberry, the show’s creator called it “Hornblower in Space” (though to the less highbrow television executives he coined it “Wagon Train to the Stars”). Roddenberry could clearly read a room and was able to tailor his pitch as necessary.\n\nYes, it was cheezy, low budget, space opera, but obviously there was something about it that gave it a lasting appeal to modern audiences.\n\nBut, with all this Star Trek about, with a different Star Trek tailored to different audiences, with seemingly a Star Trek for everyone… do we have too much? Is there such a thing as too much Star Trek?\n\nI know dyed in the wool trekkers will tell me to shut my mouth with that kind of talk, but I think this is a question that most certainly needs to be asked. As Captain Kirk said himself in the classic series episode The Trouble With Tribbles (written by David Gerrold) “Too much of anything… even love isn’t necessarily a good thing.”\n\nWell, I unashamedly and unabashedly will declare my love for Star Trek, but even I have to admit that some is not for me. Star Trek: Prodigy, for instance. I just couldn’t get over the kid’s show-Nickleodeon-type feel of the thing. For a long while I thought that it was just not for me at all. It’s aimed at younger viewers. I know, even the animated series was aimed at younger viewers, and I was a younger viewer when it first aired, but, at was also kind of… not, you know? There was a sophistication to the writing of what was originally just supposed to be a show for kids, that could not be denied. Indeed, the writing for that series was deemed worthy of an Emmy award, the only one the franchise had won up until that point.\n\nBut now, by god, there is an embarrassment of riches laid before us, a literal banquet of Trek. Is it too much? Is it endemic of our Western society where consumer demand is usually outstripped by seemingly endless supply?\n\nIs there too much Star Trek?\n\nIf there is a Trek for everyone, which one is for you? Which ones are not for you? Which Trek will you simply not watch?\n\nSee, I thought that Star Trek: Prodigy was that Trek for me. I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, until one night… just the other night, in fact… I did. And… it wasn’t bad. It had the Trek dna, and… Oh, hey! Is that Captain Janeaway? I just might watch another one. I kind of have to find out what happens!\n\nWhat about you? Which Trek is for you? Which isn’t and why? Weigh in. Leave a comment.\n\nHere’s a question directed at my fellow writers:\n\nHave you ever written a book to prove a point?\n\nBecause I have. I didn’t really know that was what I was doing. Like most writing a lot of the work is done in the subconscious. Patterns are not evident until a draft is completed. Sometimes they aren’t clear until after the book is published.\n\nMany years ago when I was in my twenties I would go to a lot of Science Fiction conventions in the Lower Mainland of BC and the Pacific Northwest of the US. At one of these conventions a panel discussion was taking place and someone brought up the topic of paradigms.\n\nWhile I was listening I was struck by an idea about paradigms and how society moves from one paradigm to another. How a paradigm shift can leave some people behind because they don’t recognize the new paradigm supplanting the old one. I remember trying to make my point from the audience and not being very successful at getting my thoughts across. The panel members did not follow what I was trying to say and at the time I did not have the ability to make my ideas any clearer.\n\nI did not make my point because I didn’t really fully understand it and even if I did I did not know how.\n\nFlash forward to a few years later. I had the opportunity to write for a fanzine that published Star Trek fan fiction. I wrote a Next Generation story about a planetary transporter and fractal geometry. The whole thing didn’t gel. None of my ideas seemed to come together. I told an interesting enough story but it didn’t have that extra dimension that I was hoping it would.\n\nEventually I took the story and transformed it into something else for a unique new market which was looking for shorter, exciting, fast-paced stories. I got rid of all the Star Trek elements and the story began to evolve. Unfortunately the market folded before I could submit.\n\nUndaunted I pressed on. I began to write a novel. I was doing a lot of world building and, without realizing it, I was coming up with a very good point about paradigms and how some societies can embrace the new paradigm and others get left behind because they don’t recognize that the paradigm shift is happening.\n\nIt wasn’t until I was into my second draft that I realized what I was doing, after so many years, was making the point that I had unsuccessfully tried to make before.\n\nI called the book THE PARADIGM TRAP and I was pretty pleased with it right up until 1991 when Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country was released into theaters. That film had made exactly the same points and had several of the same plot points.\n\nI was pretty crushed. Everybody had seen it and nobody who would ever read my book (if anybody) would not believe that I had simply ripped off the last Star Trek movie.\n\nSo… what’s my point?\n\nMy point is that I wrote an entire novel just to prove a point. Even if it was just to myself. I wrote THE PARADIGM TRAP to solidify my idea that when paradigms change, as they are wont to do, those who do not see that change will still keep fighting trying to make headway using the old ways that worked under the old paradigm. But it doesn’t matter how proficient you were at making things happen under the old paradigm, once it has been supplanted by a new one, your best efforts are impotent.\n\nOf course, none of this is relevant to any situation that is going on at this moment… is it?\n\nTHE PARADIGM TRAP can be purchased in e-book or paperback here."
