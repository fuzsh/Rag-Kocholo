        "meta_description": "Dry cleaning equipment is used to clean semiconductor wafers without the use of liquids or solvents. This type of cleaning is often preferred over wet cleaning because it eliminates the risk of residue and reduces the risk of particle contamination. Dry cleaning equipment can come in different forms such as plasma cleaning equipment, vapor phase cleaning equipment, and physical cleaning equipment such as mechanical and thermal cleaning systems. Each type of dry cleaning equipment has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of equipment will depend on the specific cleaning requirements, such as the type of contaminants to be removed and the desired level of cleanliness. Plasma cleaning, vapor phase cleaning, and physical cleaning are all methods used to remove contaminants from surfaces in the semiconductor industry. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages and the best method to use depends on the specific cleaning requirements. Plasma cleaning uses a plasma discharge to remove contaminants from a surface. This method is effective for removing organic and inorganic materials, but it can also cause damage to the surface if not controlled properly. Vapor phase cleaning uses solvents that are heated to a temperature at which they vaporize. The vapor then reacts with the contaminants on the surface to dissolve or remove them. This method is effective for removing organic contaminants, but it can also be expensive and time-consuming. Physical cleaning involves using physical means such as brushing or blasting to remove contaminants from the surface. This method is effective for removing particles and debris, but it may not be as effective for removing more stubborn contaminants. In summary, plasma cleaning is effective for removing a wide range of contaminants, vapor phase cleaning is best for removing organic materials, and physical cleaning is best for removing particles and debris. There are many manufacturers of dry cleaning equipment in the market. Some of the leading companies include: Plasma-Therm Applied Materials Lam Research Oxford Instruments KLA Corporation TEL NEXX Inc. Rudolph Technologies Bruker Corporation Novellus Systems Tokyo Electron Limited.",
