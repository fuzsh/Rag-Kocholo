It receives tally inputs from devices like switchers, record systems, etc. and provides this information over Ethernet to [[MAGNUM-Tally]] to be processed. The tally information can then be used by [[MAGNUM-Tally]] to provide tally information to Cameras, Under Monitor Displays (UMDs), Switchers, Replay and Record systems, or physical GPO's for third party devices back to the 7800TR-32x24.",
