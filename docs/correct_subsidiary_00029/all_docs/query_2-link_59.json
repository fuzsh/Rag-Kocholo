It will be the 5th consecutive year that Hillier has competed on the Mountain Course and the winner of the prestigious Newcomers Trophy in 2008, has now firmly established himself as one of the leading racers at the TT. One of the new breed of youngsters racing on both the roads and the short circuits, Hillier has a busy schedule at this year’s TT Races and will line up in all six solo races in June later this year having also secured a Lightweight TT machine. He was running fifth in the opening stages of the 2011 Dainese Superbike race and is clearly establishing himself as a potential TT winner of the future. He will be hoping to improve upon his best finish of 8th and a fastest lap of 127.661mph, which makes him the seventeenth fastest rider in TT history. He originally made his name in the Virgin Mobile R6 Cup, and enjoyed success in the British Supersport Championship before moving on, firstly to the Metzeler National Superstock Championship and then in 2011 to the British Superbike Evo Championship where he finished 8th overall and a solid debut year in the Superbike division. On the roads he made his TT debut in 2008 for the Martin Bullock Racing team when he took 17th and 19th in the two Supersport races, lapping at over 119mph and picking up two silver replicas and the Newcomers Trophy for his efforts. Since then, his road racing credentials have gone from strength to strength and he now has 15 finishes inside the top twenty at the TT with five of those top 10 and has 15 replicas. He finishedeighth place overall in the 2011 TT Championship, a stunning effort given the vastly more experienced riders he was up against. James hopes to get a run out on his ER6 Kawasaki in February before undertaking a full testing programme in Spain in March as he also contests the premier British Superbike Championship this season. In addition, he also hopes to return to the North West 200, Ulster Grand Prix and Macau in what promises to be a busy season for the Hampshire rider. Speaking about the season ahead, James said: “I’m really looking forward to the year ahead and with regards to the TT I simply want to keep on improving and build upon the results I’ve achieved thus far. No-one’s getting slower so it’s not getting any easier but I’ve been steadily getting faster and would like to think I’ll be there or thereabouts this year. I’ll take it as it comes though as that’s the approach that’s served me well thus far and although I haven’t set myself many targets, I would like to crack the 130mph barrier on the Superbike.” “I’ll also be contesting the new Lightweight TT and am really excited about that. Ryan (Farquhar) has done all the chassis work for us with the ER6 Kawasaki and the bike sounds really good so it could be the one that gives me my best result. It should be a bit more of a level playing field and promises to be a really good class.” Peter Extance, Team Owner at Bournemouth Kawasaki Racing commented: “James Hillier is a real credit and asset to Bournemouth Kawasaki Racing. We have supported him fully for four years and for us he is the reason why we are involved in Racing. James is a local lad and we have seen his potential grow over the years into what we hope will be podiums and wins at the TT. James has been a real team member and not just a Rider turning up and riding the bike. You will still see James putting up the awning and pit garage and taking it all down again at the end. For 2012 we have invested heavily in trying to give James the best machinery possible for the TT and we believe it is the time for James to be pushing on to the top steps and with seven races at this year’s event we are really excited that he can fulfill his and our dreams in 2012.” Paul Phillips, TT and Motorsport Manager, Isle of Man Government commented: “James was one of the potential stars of the future that we highlighted in our 2008 ‘Young Guns’ campaign and he’s really starting to fulfil his potential. I have no doubt that he will be a TT star for many years to come and will be challenging for a podium place sooner rather than later.” More, from a press release issued by Z1 Cycletech: Z1 Cycletech of Toronto, Ontario will distribute Performance Friction motorcycle brakes and components in Canada starting immediately.

That’s because the 29-year-old Odom just got an unexpected bonus for riding in last year’s AMA KTM National Dual Sport Trail Riding Series: a 2012 KTM 350 EXC-F from 2011 series sponsor KTM North America. The annual AMA drawing, conducted by independent auditing and accounting firm Plante & Moran of Columbus, Ohio, included participants in all of the AMA events on the national dual-sport calendar. “Man, this is awesome,” said Odom, whose current bike is a 10-year old 125cc two-stroke. “My boss got me into dual sports, and I’ve been having the best time ever. Everybody on these rides is great. They’re friendly. They’re helpful. Everyone is a die-hard rider. The riding is super challenging, but without the full-on pressure of a flat-out race. It’s great. I can’t think of a better time on a motorcycle.” KTM North America Inc. President Jon-Erik Burleson said he’s excited to see the 350 EXC-F go to someone who appreciates the new bike as much as Odom. “It’s great that someone like Randy, who has wanted to be a part of the KTM family for so long, can now count himself among the orange-bleeders,” Burleson said. “These guys are the heart and soul of our customer base. I hope Randy enjoys his new KTM for years to come.” Odom, a long-time off-road rider, says the people who ride and organize the individual events on the AMA’s national dual-sport calendar represent some of motorcycling’s friendliest people. He said one of his favorite rides is the Show Me 200, put on by the Midwest Trail Riders Association in Bixby, Mo. “I loved it,” Odom said. “I rode that, and I got hooked. It’s all types of terrain. It has the best of everything. Maybe best of all, I get to keep my wheels on the ground and stay pretty safe. My wife definitely approves! In fact, I just sent my check off to ride the 2012 Show Me 200. Plus, at all these events, we appreciate the AMA and the clubs that are part of the AMA and everything the AMA does for riders.” With the 2012 season set to begin soon, stay tuned for exciting news on this year’s dual-sport series, including a full schedule and more.

More, from a press release issued by Driven Public Relations on behalf of Zero Motorcycles: ZERO MOTORCYCLES RANKED #1 ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE MANUFACTURER IN THE WORLD BY PIKE RESEARCH — Independent Study Finds Zero Motorcycles Achieved Highest Ranking Among Competition — SANTA CRUZ, Calif. Zero Motorcycles, the global leader in the electric motorcycle industry, today announced it achieved the highest overall results in an independent study conducted by Pike Research. The study, called the Pike Pulse Report, evaluated the competitive landscape of both the electric motorcycle and electric scooter markets and named only one company as the overall leader. The study was based on 12 distinct categories that measured an Original Equipment Manufacturers’ (OEM) ability to compete on a global level. Zero Motorcycles scored higher than many notable names, including Honda and KTM. “Pike Research is one of the industry’s leading independent market research firms when it comes to EV’s and new technology. We are very gratified to hear that they have ranked us number one in the electric motorcycle industry. It confirms we are on a good path and serves as huge motivation for us to keep pushing hard to develop our vision for electric motorcycles. It also is a huge reward for the staff of Zero Motorcycles who share equally in this acknowledgment,” stated Scot Harden, VP of Global Marketing for Zero Motorcycles. “We are deeply committed to this product segment.” The following is an excerpt taken from the Pike Pulse Report Zero Motorcycle achieved the highest ranking in this Pike Pulse Report with a combination of strong strategic planning and great execution of those plans. The company’s product lineup is well suited to the less cost-conscious early adopter market. Zero is also pursuing a specialty market for the e-motorcycles (off-road and fleet applications). In addition, the company has put together a strong management team and continues to build a strong dealer network in the key regions of Western Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and North America. All of these factors have provided Zero with strong momentum leading into 2012. The Pike Pulse Report was scored on the following criteria: Strategy Vision Go-To-Market Strategy Partners Product and Production Strategy Technology Geographic Reach Execution Criteria Market Share Sales and Marketing Product Quality and Reliability Product Features Pricing Staying Power The Zero S, a street fighter, and Zero DS, a dual sport, are both available in a 6 or 9 kWh configuration. As measured by the EPA UDDS, the Zero S is capable of respectively achieving 76 or 114 miles on a single charge. Both motorcycles offer a higher top speed, with the Zero DS hitting 80 mph and the Zero S topping out at 88 mph. Both motorcycles offer a broad torque band and stealthy acceleration from 0 rpm that makes them incredibly fun to ride. In addition, all the street models, including the Zero XU, feature new brushless motors and regenerative braking that allow riders to recoup energy during deceleration. The Zero XU, a motorcycle designed for inner city riding, now uses the same maintenance-free belt drive system as the Zero S and Zero DS. Brushless air-cooled motors, life of motorcycle power packs and belt drive systems make Zero’s lineup of street models just about the world’s easiest-to-own form of transportation. Zero’s new Z-Force™ power pack uses a completely new battery cell chemistry and configuration that is up to 95 percent more energy dense and is rated to 3,000 complete charge cycles before hitting 80 percent capacity. This means that a Zero S could travel as much as 308,000 miles on its original power pack. All of Zero’s on and off-road motorcycles leverage the new technology, meaning that the power pack is designed to exceed the longevity expected of any conventional motorcycle. The result is a complete electric motorcycle line that offers owners exhilarating rides while saving on gas and virtually all-routine powertrain maintenance. The same is true for the all new Zero X and MX. Improvements in styling, performance and range make both of these off-road oriented models a dream to own and operate. With almost three times the range of previous Zero X and MX models, and with substantially more power on tap, these electric dirt motorcycles take off-road riding to an all new level. About Zero Motorcycles Zero Motorcycles is committed to transforming the motorcycling experience by bringing to market highly innovative electric motorcycles that offer exceptional value and performance. Zero is powered by innovation, driven by passion, guided by integrity, and measured by results. Through extensive research, insight and experience, Zero combines the art and science of motorcycle development to create and manufacture products that excite consumers and inspire brand loyalty.

The 24-year old will campaign both GSXR1000 and GSXR600 Suzuki machines during the season and will receive technical support from TAS Racing as he bids for glory on both the short circuits and the roads. He’s no stranger to the GSXR having ridden both a K7 and K9 Superstock bike in previous years but it will be his first time on the 600cc version, having enjoyed success during the last four seasons on an R6 Yamaha. Since becoming the first rider to win a hat-trick at the Manx Grand Prix, a feat he achieved in 2008, Kneen’s credentials have gone from strength to strength. On the roads the Braddan rider has become a regular fixture in the top ten at the Isle of Man TT with a best result to date of 5th in the 2010 Supersport A race, as well as doing similar at the North West 200 and Ulster GP becoming the fastest newcomer in history at the latter when he lapped at over 129mph in 2010. It will be the 4th consecutive season that Marks Bloom, Chartered Accountants and Insolvency Practitioners in Kingston upon Thames, has supplied machinery for Kneen and other major sponsors of the team in 2012 include WEMOTO, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of on-line motorcycle parts, Slick Performance and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. Speaking about the season ahead, Kneen said: “It’s great to have everything all in place so early and I can’t wait for the new season to start. Having new machinery is a terrific boost to all of us and we should be able to raise our game considerably. I’ve ridden Suzukis before and gone well and receiving technical support from the TAS Racing team will only strengthen our cause.” “I want to go quicker at the TT and improve my results so I’ve been doing more homework on the course and concentrating on learning it a bit more. I’ve done good lap times so far but it was a bit of a struggle on the big bike last year and I had to roll off in places so there’s definite time to be gained. I’ve had my best results in the 600cc class but I was a bit unlucky last year as I was running 4th in the first race before it got stopped and 3rd in the second before the same thing happened but these things happen. It will be nice to be on a new 600 machine and if I could get a podium, that would be superb.” Paul Phillips, TT and Motorsport Manager, Isle of Man Government commented: “Dan is definitely one of the up and coming riders at the TT and it’s great to have another high profile Manxman along with Conor for the locals to support. He’s building his performances well and isn’t that far away from a podium place which could even come this year.” More, from another press release issued by American Motorcyclist Association: American Motorcyclist Association earns Grassroots Innovation Award PICKERINGTON, Ohio — The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) and AMA Grassroots Coordinator Jessica Irving have earned a prestigious Grassroots Innovation Award for their inventive campaign to involve the public in overturning a federal ban on the sale of kids’ dirtbikes and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). The Public Affairs Council — a nonpartisan, nonpolitical association for public affairs professionals — presented the award to Irving in the “social media” category at its National Grassroots Conference held in Miami Beach, Fla., Jan. 30-Feb. 2. The award was presented for the AMA Kids Just Want to Ride! grassroots campaign — a national educational and recruitment movement that encouraged people nationwide to get involved in efforts to overturn the ban. Critical components of the campaign included the use of Facebook and YouTube videos. The AMA Kids Just Want to Ride! campaign was instrumental in bringing hundreds of young motorcyclists, their parents and concerned riders from 20 states to Washington, D.C., on May 26 for the AMA Family Capitol Hill Climb to lobby their U.S. representatives. The event was a strong demonstration of public opposition to the ban on the sale of kid-sized motorcycles and ATVs. “We’re honored and humbled to receive this prestigious award from the well-respected Public Affairs Council,” said Rob Dingman, AMA president and CEO. “We put an awful lot of effort into the Kids Just Want to Ride! campaign, but the true heroes are all the AMA members, individuals and organizations who came together as a community for the good of the children. “We’re extremely pleased that we were able to provide some of the critical tools needed to exempt kids’ dirtbikes and ATVs from the law,” Dingman said. “We certainly learned that, as a united community, we are unstoppable.” On Aug. 12, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 2715 to exempt kids’ off-highway vehicles (OHVs) from the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008, known as the lead law. The CPSIA, which went into effect on Feb. 10, 2009, banned the making, importing, distributing or selling of any product intended for children 12 and under, including kids’ dirtbikes and ATVs, that contained more than a specified amount of lead in any accessible part. The president’s signature ended nearly three years of intensive efforts by the AMA and its partner organization, the All-Terrain Vehicle Association (ATVA), their members and millions of advocates of responsible OHV recreation to change the law.

More, from a press release issued by Road Racing Legends: SEVENTH ANNUAL ROAD RACING LEGENDS FUND RAISER www.roadracinglegends.org The seventh annual Road Racing Legends fund raising event was held on February 17 at the Wynnstay Hotel in Oswestry, North Shropshire. The theme this year was TT Magic and was due to include a star guest line-up of Ryan Farquhar, Jenny Tinmouth, Ian Hutchinson, and Guy Martin plus a special half time appearance of John McGuinness, the host for the evening to be RRL patron Jamie Whitham. However despite having agreed a fee and his availability to attend the event in writing – 12 months earlier plus given numerous telephone calls to confirm the date the organisation was extremely disappointed to receive a call from Guy Martin’s management team on the morning of the event stating that he would not be attending due to work commitments. There was no apology either to the organisers or his fans for his non-attendance. John McGuinness, who had flown in especially from Sepang in Malaysia where he had been testing with the Honda TT Legends World Endurance team very kindly agreed to step into the breach and remained at the event throughout the evening instead of the agreed half time appearance that was originally scheduled. Grateful thanks also must go to Ian Hutchinson who signed himself out of hospital where he was receiving treatment for a broken leg as he did not want to let down the fans or organisers of the event. As the event began, RRL Chairman Colin Morris advised the audience of Guy Martin’s last minute withdrawal and offered a refund to anyone disappointed by this. Not one person took advantage of the offer and the evening went on to be a resounding success, one of the best to date, raising a sum of Â£22,088 on the day taking the overall total to Â£105,340. Phil Morris said: “Despite the non appearance of Guy Martin we had an enjoyable and productive evening and my thanks go to everyone who attended the event and helped to make it so successful. Needless to say we are very disappointed with Guy Martin who let us down badly.” The Road Racing Legends Organisation was set up in 2005 to raise and donate funds to various charities through events and corporate sponsoring to include the Rob Vine fund, Isle of Man Helicopter fund, TT Riders association to name but a few plus to assist riders such as Conor Cummins, Nick Crowe and Mark Cox in their recovery from injury. We are able to offer help where it is needed and provide events and promotions through the generous donations of our members and patrons. In order to admire and enjoy the wonders of British motorcycle racing since 1907. We are launching an urgent appeal in search of memorabilia such as Helmets, Leathers, Trophies and even Bikes themselves for the purpose of auctions for the benefits of the charities we work so hard to support. Charities such as Air Ambulance, Hope House, Helicopter Fund IOM, Wheelchairs for injured riders and donations for the rehabilitation of injured riders. More, from a press release issued by Irnie Racing: “Irnie Racing Shifts Up for 2012!” Marcel Irnie has a new agenda for 2012. The Kelowna BC native welcomes a new teammate, a new motorcycle, a full-time Canadian crew chief and exciting new sponsors to assist the team with their challenging privateer program The MOPAR Canadian Superbike Championship! Andrew Rogers of Gig Harbor WA joins Marcel as his teammate for 2012. Rogers, who has only raced for one full season, is already the fastest Novice racer in Washington. Jason Williams of Ottawa will be playing a pivotal role in the pits as crew chief. Williams’s mechanical background and race track experience will be an invaluable resource to the team’s race program. The team will be racing the entire Canadian Superbike Championship Series with Irnie piloting the potent AMSOIL 2012 BMW S1000RR in the Pro Superbike class and Rogers piloting his 2009 Yamaha R6 in the Amateur Sportbike class. The team has allocated 10 weeks for traveling to Eastern Canada to compete in the series, but also intends to race several events in Washington, Oregon, and hopefully California. Irnie will be consistently racing on competitive equipment this year with his new BENTLEY Motorrad BMW. In previous years, Irnie had been racing on underpowered 600cc machines and learned to make do with less. He achieved two victories in 2011 on borrowed equipment, so having competitive machinery for a complete campaign will be a welcome change. Irnie commented, “We are running a very serious privateer race program for 2012. I will be competing in the Pro Superbike class and Amateur Rookie Andrew Rogers competes to win the Amateur Sportbike class. The Pro Superbike class features the fastest bikes and the fastest factory riders in Canada, while the Amateur Sportbike class produces the fastest 600cc Amateur National racers. We will be traveling the Canadian National Series for ten weeks straight, racing and filming to promote the Irnie Racing brand and sponsors. We will also race seven WMRRA/OMRRA/AFM regional races before and after Canada. I will be producing the 2012 Irnieracing.com Canadian Superbike Tour HD Documentary. I have discussed this with series organizer Kevin Graham, and he is happy that I will be filming his series from the on-board GoPro perspective.” New 2012 Irnieracing.com sponsors: BENTLEY Motorrad Graves Motorsports HEROIC Racing Apparel Pro-Bolt USA Dave Alexander Yoyodyne Nu-Life Hearing Center Idol-Fit Connect Moto-D Racing Woodcraft Technologies Armour Bodies Returning Irnieracing.com Sponsors: AMSOIL Synthetics Advanced Motorcycle Gear GoPro Camera KFG Racing World Gym Kelowna EBC Brakes 2WheelDynoWorks OneOnOneDesign 2012 Schedule: Washington Rd 1 -April 1 Oregon Rd 1 -April 22 Washington Rd 2 -April 29 or California Rd 2 -May 13 (AFM) Washington Rd 3 -May 28 Oregon Rd 2 -June 3rd Ontario CSBK Rd 1 -June 24 Quebec CSBK Rd 2 -July 8th Nova Scotia ARL regional -July 15th Nova Scotia CSBK Rd 3 -July 22nd Quebec CSBK Rd 4 -August 12th Ontario CSBK Rd 5/6 -August 26th Oregon Rd 6 -Sept 16th Oregon Rd 7 -Oct 7 or California Rd 7 -Oct 7th (AFM) More, from a press release issued by Putter Power Media on behalf of Absolute Cycle Experience: ABSOLUTE CYCLE EXPERIENCE NAMES WASHINGTON CYCLE WORKS AN AUTHORIZED REPAIR AND TRACK-PREP SHOP FOR ITS MEMBERS RAHWAY, NJ (February 24, 2011) — Absolute Cycle Experience, the east coast’s premier powersports parts dealer and track-day club, is pleased to announce a new relationship with Washington Cycle Works as an authorized service center.
