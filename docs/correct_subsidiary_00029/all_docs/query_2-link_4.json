        "text": "WILMINGTON, Mass., April 23 -- NEXX Systems, a Wilmington manufacturer of flip chip processing equipment for back-end semiconductor manufacturing, announced today it has completed the acquisition of All Wet Technologies Inc. (AWT), a Wellesley developer of electrodeposition technology for metal and photoresist. Arthur Keigler, president of AWT, has joined NEXX Systems as vice president of technology and as a board member.\n\nWith the acquisition, NEXX Systems will offer two new product lines in addition to its Nimbus PVD and Cirrus CVD systems: Stratus systems for electrodeposition applications in gold and solder bumping, redistribution and MEMS; and Cirrostratus systems for photoresist electrodeposition targeted at wafer bumping and MEMS-type thick film processes.\n\nNewport Corp. announced Monday that it has invested $3.5 million to acquire 19.9 percent of NEXX Systems.\n\nFor more information, visit: www.nexxsystems.com"
