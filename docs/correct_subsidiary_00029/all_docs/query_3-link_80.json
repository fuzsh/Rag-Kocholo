This is typically done using an immersion process wherein a wafer, or one or more carriers containing a number of wafers, is immersed in the desired hydrofluoric acid containing processing fluid.\n\nsilicon wafers can be processed by using etchant gases, including gases which contain hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n\ngases which contain hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n\nHF hydrofluoric acid\n\nauthors P. A. M. van der Heide et al. describe the etching of silicon dioxide layers by using vapor mixtures of HF, water and nitrogen.\n\nthe article describes using a flow of nitrogen carrier gas through a vessel containing a 10% hydrofluoric aqueous solution.\n\nthe nitrogen carrier produced a flow of etchant gas which was directed through a nozzle against the surface of a small silicon wafer being etched.\n\na flow of dry nitrogen was passed over the opposite side of the wafer to reduce the effects of ambient atmospheric water which was present in the essentially open atmospheric process. Temperatures from 25Â°-40Â° C. were indicated for the HF solution and from 25Â° C. to about 60Â° C. for the wafer. The authors also reported that high temperature treatment under vacuum conditions following the etch provided complete removal of oxygen.\n\netching uniformity is also deficient in that the process arrangement may not provide assurance of equilibrium homogeneous presentation of the reactant gas to the wafer being processed. Variations in the uptake of the vapors by the incoming carrier gas stream can result in instantaneous variations in the etchant gas stream which can affect processing. This deficiency may not have been as significant in the reported processing because of the substantial diluting effect of the carrier gas which also resulted in very slow etching rates.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,749,440 to Blackwood et al. shows a gaseous process for removing films from substrates which utilizes an anhydrous HF supply.\n\nthe process is described to involve passing a flow of dry nitrogen over the wafer and then introducing a flow of reactive gas which is preferably an anhydrous hydrogen halide gas such as anhydrous hydrogen fluoride gas.\n\na flow of water vapor laden nitrogen is also passed over the wafer before the anhydrous HF gas flow is begun and this is continued until after the anhydrous HF gas flow has been stopped.\n\nThis type of processing leads to nonhomogeneous mixing occurring during the brief processing period of approximately 5-30 seconds.\n\nexclusively water laden carrier gas is first introduced.\n\nthe nonuniformity problem also results from variations in the amount of water present in the matrix of the material being processed which can have very significant effects on the effective localized concentrations of the reactants on the surface of the chip during the high speed reactions which occur during this type of processing.\n\nWafers otherwise processed in a similar manner may exhibit highly differing processing rates merely because they have been allowed to sit for hours under ambient conditions thereby uptaking atmospheric moisture to a substantially greater degree than other wafers processed soon out of a furnace or other moisture eliminating processing.\n\nSuch variations in moisture content of the wafers are typical and any special pre-atmospheric treatment necessarily increases processing time, processing logistics, or both.\n\nEDGE 2000 Another more recent approach to vapor etching of wafers is incorporated into the processing machine referred to as the EDGE 2000 from Advantage Production Technology.\n\nThis system utilizes a specially configured processing chamber which vacuum treats the wafer prior to processing with the etchant.\n\nThis approach attempts to remove residual moisture from the wafer to address the nonuniform etching rate problem discussed above.\n\nthe relatively short duration vacuum processing cannot remove all moisture content variations.\n\nthe wafer is exposed to a highly reactive HF-water gas stream which is directed at the wafer in a vertical orientation from one or both sides.\n\nthe jet of incoming reactant gas impinges upon the surface or surfaces of the wafer at localized central areas and typically results in non-uniformities in mass transfer due to this localized impingement despite the vacuum processing directed toward water removal.\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic side sectional view showing a preferred configuration for vapor processing wafers according to this invention.\n\nFIG. 2 is a further schematic side sectional view showing another preferred configuration for vapor processing wafers according to this invention.\n\nthe novel processes according to this invention involve the production of a vapor mixture or solution which is used as a processing gas for combined etching and cleaning.\n\nthe etching and cleaning agents are typically acids. Hydrogen-halide acids are preferred.\n\nthe preferred methods use hydrofluoric acid vapor, hydrochloric acid vapor and water vapor.\n\nthe water vapor acts as a diluent and is important in inducing the reactivity of the hydrofluoric acid.\n\nthe hydrofluoric acid vapor acts as the etching vapor.\n\nthe hydrochloric acid vapor acts as a cleaning agent solubilizing metals, metallic ions, and other contaminant particles. The vaporous solubilization of the contaminants allow for volatilizing the contaminant particles from the surface of the wafer to provide improved particle counts as a result processing.\n\nthe manner of producing and presenting the vapor mixture to the semiconductor wafer or similar article being processed is of great significance in the achievement of a commercially viable process of suitable benefits to warrant use in the semiconductor chip manufacturing industry.\n\nthe vapor mixture is preferably produced in a manner which generates a nearly homogeneous vapor mixture of these constituents which acts as a reactant processing gas.\n\nthe vapor mixture is most preferably in equilibrium with a liquid phase supplying the vapors.\n\nthe liquid phase source is also preferably homogeneously mixed or in solution.\n\nthe processing gas has been found effective at both etching oxide and nitride layers and additionally to simultaneously remove metals, metallic ions and other particulates from the wafer.\n\na typical utilization of the processes is in the removal silicon dioxide layers from silicon wafers with combined metallic particulate removal to achieve a very clean etch and very low particle count in a relatively quick and highly cost effective one-step process.\n\nthe processes are also potentially applicable to the processing of other wafer and substrate materials, such as gallium arsenide and indium containing semiconductors.\n\nthe processing gas is advantageously produced from a homogeneous liquid mixture or solution of the etchant, cleaning agent and diluent.\n\nthe processing gas is made of hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and water which forms a source for the desired homogeneous equilibrium vapor processing gas.\n\nAlternative etchant, cleaning and diluent components may also be operable.\n\nthe equilibrium liquid processing solution is advantageously comprised of water and combined amounts of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids in sufficient amounts to provide relative molar concentrations in the approximate range of 1:100 to 1:1 (combined hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid:water). More preferably, the liquid source of the processing vapor includes amounts sufficient to provide relative molar concentrations in the approximate range of 1:50 to 1:5 (acids:water).\n\nthe relative amounts of the hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids in the processing solutions are typically in the approximate range of 5:1 to 20:1 (hydrofluoric acid:hydrochloric acid).\n\nhydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and water used in preparing the preferred liquid processing solutions are advantageously of very high purity without contaminating particles of organic or inorganic materials. Purity levels of the highest or nearly highest degree obtainable with chemical purification techniques now available are most appropriate.\n\nthe processing liquid mixture is advantageously maintained at a temperature suitable for producing vapor pressures of the constituents which cause good evolution of vapor to speed processing.\n\nLiquid processing fluid temperatures in the range of 10Â°-100Â° C. are appropriate. Temperatures in the range of 20Â°-40Â° C. are more preferred, with ambient temperatures of 20Â°-25Â° C. most typical.\n\nthe vapor processing is preferably done within an enclosed or confined processing chamber at pressures which are sufficiently high to prevent boiling of the liquid processing fluid. Processing pressures in the approximate range of 100-2000 torr are operable dependent upon temperature of the liquid mixture. Pressures in the range of 500-1500 torr are more preferable with atmospheric pressures in the range of 600-900 torr most preferable.\n\nthe liquid phase processing mixture can advantageously be assisted into vapor formation by a suitable vaporization enhancer.\n\nthe vaporizing of the liquid phase can be enhanced by a suitable agitating, such as by circulating through a recycle system as described below, or otherwise agitating the processing liquid. It is alternatively, or additionally possible to use ultrasonic agitation to enhance vapor formation.\n\nEnhanced vapor formation can serve to increase processing throughput and availability of the vapor phase mixture to the wafer being processed.\n\nthe homogeneous processing gases used in the novel processes of this invention are preferably presented to a wafer being processed so as to uniformly contact the surface or surfaces being acid processed.\n\ncarrier gas is specifically not employed because of the inventor's identification of substantial complicating and derogatory effects of such an approach.\n\nCarrier gases tend not only to dilute the vapor and reduce etch rates, but also to represent substantial additional problems in maintaining homogeneity and effective etching upon the surface of the wafer being processed.\n\nthe preferred processing gases are contacted against the processed surface of the wafer in a manner specifically designed to minimize the potential for nonhomogeneity and variations in the microscopic localized concentrations of the mixed acids and water.\n\nthe processing rates of aqueous hydrofluoric acid mixtures vary dramatically as a function of differing relative concentrations of these constituents. Such variations have plagued the semiconductor industry resulting in uneven etch rates which are increasingly troublesome in chips having smaller and smaller feature sizes.\n\na preferred manner of presenting the processing vapors is to generate the vapors from a pool of homogeneous liquid mixture which is in close physical proximity to the wafer surface. This is advantageously accomplished by forming a pool of the liquid source mixture which is maintained in a homogeneous condition by suitable mixing. The wafer is then processed by closely positioning the wafer to the source pool.\n\nthe preferred manner of presentation of the processing vapors to the processed wafer surface or surfaces is also to orient the processed surface to face downwardly. This presents the treated surface in a manner which resists particle migration to the surface by the force of gravity. It is also advantageous in bringing the processed surface of the wafer in closer proximity and juxtaposition to the source of vapor and improves the mass transfer between the source and surface to maintain high etch rates and good solubilization of metallic particles and ions.\n\nthe wafer surface being processed is preferably in the approximate range of 2-100 millimeters from the surface of the liquid etchant source to facilitate circulation and mass transfer.\n\nthe novel processes of this invention also include rotating the wafer during the presentation of the vapors to provide uniform dispersion of the processing gas over the entire processed surface of the wafer.\n\nthe rotating of the wafer being processed is also significant in creating circulation which provides adequate mass transfer between the source, vapor and surface being treated. At sufficient rotational speeds a vortex action develops which can be significant in providing the desired mass transfer and circulation.\n\nThese dynamic flows in the circulating processing vapors also are significant in maintaining homogeneity and equilibrium in the vapor phase so that etch rates are uniform across the wafer and repeatable from wafer to wafer.\n\nthe rotating action of the wafer is preferably at rotational speeds of at least 20 revolutions per minute (rpm). Speeds less than 20 rpm have been found inadequate to fulfill the processing needs of the system. More advantageously, the relative wafer rotational speeds are in the approximate range of 20-1000 rpm because excessive speeds have been determined to cause a substantial derogatory effect in particle counts on the wafer. Although the specific mechanism is not known with precision, it is believed that the high rotational speeds cause such extensive turbulence that particles are agitated to a point causing migration onto the wafer surface from either the liquid source or the processing equipment. High rotational speeds may also cause electrical charge (static electricity) to develop which may aggravate the potential, otherwise raised by the turbulence, for particle migration.\n\nelectrical charge static electricity\n\nrotational speeds in the range of 20-1000 rpm are operable, experimentation has indicated that rotational speeds in the range of approximately 30-800 rpm are improved in maintaining low particle counts as compared to rotational speeds outside this range. Still further significant improvement has been shown when the rotational speeds are in the range of approximately 50-400 rpm. Still further preferred are rotational speeds in the approximate range of 50-250 rpm.\n\nthe novel processes of this invention further advantageously include drying the wafer after the acid vapor phase processing described above.\n\nthe vapor processing can lead to condensation of the vapors onto the surface of the wafers.\n\nthe drying advantageously includes a post-acid-processing spin cycle immediately after the vapor phase processing described above.\n\nthe wafer is rotated as during the vapor phase processing or with increased rotational speeds greater than 1000 rpm. Spinning speeds in the approximate range 1000-3000 rpm are suitable, with speeds of 1000-2000 most preferred.\n\nthe spin processing can be assisted by also passing a flow of suitable drying gas through the processing chamber to further supplement or finalize the drying process.\n\nthe drying gas is preferably a non-reactive gas, such as nitrogen or an inert gas.\n\nthe drying gas can be heated or supplied at ambient temperatures. Drying gas having temperatures in the range of 0Â°-200Â° C. are appropriate, with temperatures in the range 20Â°-100Â° C. more preferred.\n\nthe drying gas is preferably supplied so as to impinge upon the processed surface or surfaces being dried.\n\nFIG. 1 shows relevant portions of a preferred semiconductor processing machine adapted for carrying out the novel processes of this invention.\n\nProcessing machine 10 includes a movable head 12 which mates with a processing bowl 14 to confine an enclosed processing chamber 16.\n\nProcessing head 12 includes a suitable wafer holder 30 for holding a wafer 20 using fingers 34 in a desired orientation with the processed surface facing downwardly.\n\nthe wafer holder 30 is provided with a motor or other drive (not shown) which is connected to the drive shaft 31 to rotate the wafer in the desired rotational processing described above.\n\nthe arrangement shown in FIG. 1 includes the wafer 20 in superposition above a subjacent pool 40 of the liquid source for the gaseous processing fluid.\n\nthe proximity distance D p defines the amount of separation between the upper level of the liquid processing fluid source and the wafer surface being processed.\n\nthe preferred range of D p is the indicated 2-100 millimeters.\n\nthe processed surface of wafer 20 is in directly opposite juxtaposition to the subjacent pool 40.\n\nthe processing machine 10 is also advantageously provided with a means for maintaining a homogeneous mixture of the liquid phase constituents.\n\na means for maintaining a homogeneous mixture of the liquid phase constituents is suitably provided in the form of a central drain 50 which has a system outflow line 51 through which liquid is drained through drain valve 52 to a disposal line 53.\n\nthe outflow line 51 is advantageously branched to form a recycle line 55 which empties into a reservoir 60.\n\nReservoir 60 can advantageously be provided with a suitable heater, such as a thermostatically controlled electric resistance heating coil 63 for maintaining the processing liquid at a desired temperature.\n\nReservoir 60 is provided with an outflow in the form of pump feed line 61 which communicates fluid to the inflow side of a suitable pump 65.\n\nPump 65 and outlet valve 68 are controlled to deliver a supply of the processing liquid to form pool 40 in the lower portions of processing chamber 16.\n\na reservoir recycle control valve 56 is provided to allow control of the level of pool 40.\n\nthe processor 10 also advantageously is provided with an ultrasonic agitator 75 of suitable design.\n\nAgitator 75 can be activated during the acid processing to enhance vapor formation.\n\nFIG. 1 also shows that the processing chamber 16 is further fitted with a drying gas introduction port 76 which receives nitrogen or other drying gas from drying gas supply line 77.\n\nthe drying gas can be input into the processing chamber via a plurality of circumferentially spaced ports which are at approximately the same elevation as the wafer or slightly below and oriented to direct the flow of drying gas across the processed wafer surface.\n\nthe processor 10 is operated to carry out the described processes.\n\nthe wafer 20 Prior to the combined etching and cleaning, the wafer 20 is otherwise suitably processed in a variety of related processing steps dependent on the particular integrated circuit product being produced.\n\nthe head 12 is loaded with wafer 20 which is held in position by the wafer holder.\n\nthe head is then positioned in sealing relationship with the bowl 14 or otherwise suitably adjusted to confine the processing chamber against drafts and other substantial leakages which might affect the homogeneous vapor phase which is being presented for contacting and etching and cleaning the processed surface of wafer 20.\n\nthe bowl is thereafter filled with the source liquid for producing the processing vapor using pump 65, supply line 66 and suitable control of valves 52, 56 and 58.\n\nthe wafer is preferably rotated at a suitable speed, as indicated, during the filling operation and maintained briefly to better establish an equilibrium condition between the liquid processing fluid source and the vapor phase processing gas within the processing chamber adjacent the wafer surface. This equilibrium can typically be established within 10 seconds to 1 minute depending on the size and proximity spacing of the system.\n\nthe agitator 75 or recycle loop through reservoir 60 can be used to assist in the production of vapor from the liquid phase.\n\nthe rotation of the wafer at the desired speed is continued to perform the combined etching and cleaning. Processing times are commonly in the approximate range 30 seconds to 3 minutes, with 1 minute times most typical.\n\nPump 65 and valves 56 and 68 can be suitably controlled to recycle the source liquid to maintain homogeneity and to filter the liquid through recycle filter 67 which is preferably a 0.1 micron or smaller filter to remove particles from the liquid during recycle.\n\nvalve 56 is opened and the pool of processing source liquid is drained to reservoir 60 for reuse. Alternatively, it can be drained through valve 52 when it is expended.\n\nthe wafer rotational speed can advantageously be increased to speeds typically in the range of approximately 1000-2000 rpm to assist in the removal of any condensed vapor and to minimize the potential for residue.\n\nSuch post-acid-processing spinning is typically done for periods of 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or as appropriate.\n\nthe post-treatment spin can be performed while also passing a flow of drying gas through the chamber using inlet port 76.\n\nthe head is removed upwardly and the wafer removed in any suitable manner for subsequent processing.\n\nFIG. 2 shows portions of an alternative processing machine 110 similar to machine 10 described above.\n\nthe notable difference is in the provision of a perimeter trench 117 in processing bowl 114 for confining the processing fluid pool 140 therein about the periphery of the wafer 120.\n\nthe wafer and supporting wafer holders preferably extend in close proximity to create vapor circulation between the toroid-shaped pool and the processed lower surface of wafer 120.\n\nDrain 150 and outflow line 151 are similarly connected to a recycle and drain system such as described above with reference to FIG. 1.\n\nthe system shown in FIG. 2 is operated using processes the same or similar to that described above.\n\nLiquid processing fluid was prepared in a molar ratio of 160:16:1 (water:hydrofluoric acid:hydrochloric acid) by mixing these components in the typical manner of mixing acids and water.\n\nthe processing fluids were input into a processor similar to FIG. 1 and recirculated to mix and further assure homogeneity.\n\nthe liquid processing fluid was then drained to reservoir and the processing chamber opened and a wafer was installed.\n\nthe processing fluid was maintained at ambient temperature.\n\nthe wafer and head assembly were placed in position to enclose the processing chamber and the wafer rotated at approximate 100 rpm at a distance of approximately 7.5 millimeters.\n\nthe pressure within the processing chamber was atmospheric.\n\nFluid from the reservoir was then supplied into the processing chamber bowl and the vapor phase concentrations were allowed to increase for approximately 15 seconds.\n\nthe wafer was then processed by the vaporous processing fluid for an additional 60 seconds. Thereafter the processing chamber was supplied with a flow of drying nitrogen gas at approximately 2 psig and ambient temperature. The rotor speed was increased to approximately 2000 rpm during the drying of the wafer which lasted approximately 2 minutes. The wafer was thereafter removed and examined to determine that etching had occurred with acceptable uniformity. Particle counts had decreased relative to counts made before processing.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nCondensed Matter Physics & Semiconductors (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nComputer Hardware Design (AREA)\n\nMicroelectronics & Electronic Packaging (AREA)\n\nPower Engineering (AREA)\n\nCleaning Or Drying Semiconductors (AREA)\n\nWeting (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nDisclosed are methods and apparatuses for combined etching and cleaning of semiconductor wafers and the like preferably using hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water solutions which generate equilibrium vapor mixtures of HF vapor, HCl vapor and water vapor as a homogenous processing gas.

The wafer is preferably oriented with the surface being processed directed downward. The wafer is advantageously positioned above or in close proximity to the liquid source of the processing vapor. The wafer is rotated at a rotational speed in the range of 20-1000 revolutions per minute to provide uniform dispersion of the homogeneous processing gas across the wafer surface and to facilitate circulation and transfer from the liquid source into processing gas and onto the processed surface. The liquid source of the vapor can advantageously be provided in a bath immediately below the processed surface of the wafer or in toroidal basin adjacent to the wafer.

No. 07/524,239, filed May 15, 1990, now abandoned, \"Aqueous Hydrofluoric Acid Vapor Etching of Semiconductor Wafers\".\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\nThe technical field of this invention is vapor phase processes for silicon and other semiconductor wafers using combined hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid aqueous solutions.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is common in the processing of silicon wafers to remove or etch portions of a layer of silicon dioxide using an etchant. A common etchant is hydrofluoric acid. This is typically done using an immersion process wherein a wafer, or one or more carriers containing a number of wafers, is immersed in the desired hydrofluoric acid containing processing fluid.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of immersion etching processes is that the wafers typically exhibit an increase in the numbers of particulates which become adhered to or imbedded in the wafer. As the feature size of semiconductor wafers continues to decrease into the sub-micron sizes, now typically in the range of 0.1-0.5 micron, the need for minimizing contamination becomes more acute. These small feature sizes also create additional problems for immersion processing because surface tension effects can reduce etching uniformity and resulting product quality.\n\nIt has previously been recognized that silicon wafers can be processed by using etchant gases, including gases which contain hydrofluoric acid (HF). In an article entitled, \"Etching of Thin SiO2 Layers Using Wet HF Gas\" authors P. A. M. van der Heide et al., describe the etching of silicon dioxide layers by using vapor mixtures of HF, water and nitrogen. The article describes using a flow of nitrogen carrier gas through a vessel containing a 10% hydrofluoric aqueous solution. The nitrogen carrier produced a flow of etchant gas which was directed through a nozzle against the surface of a small silicon wafer being etched. A flow of dry nitrogen was passed over the opposite side of the wafer to reduce the effects of ambient atmospheric water which was present in the essentially open atmospheric process. Temperatures from 25Â°-40Â° C. were indicated for the HF solution and from 25Â° C. to about 60Â° C. for the wafer. The authors also reported that high temperature treatment under vacuum conditions following the etch provided complete removal of oxygen.\n\nOne deficiency of the process described is the continuation of etching after the process exposure has begun. This results in uneven etching rates and problems in the resulting integrated circuit devices due to variations in feature sizes across the device. The etching uniformity is also deficient in that the process arrangement may not provide assurance of equilibrium homogeneous presentation of the reactant gas to the wafer being processed. Variations in the uptake of the vapors by the incoming carrier gas stream can result in instantaneous variations in the etchant gas stream which can affect processing. This deficiency may not have been as significant in the reported processing because of the substantial diluting effect of the carrier gas which also resulted in very slow etching rates.\n\nAnother serious deficiency of the processing described by van der Heidi is that the etching rates are very slow and accordingly not practical from a commercial processing standpoint where high volume production rates must be maintained. The authors describe the need to produce an initial wetting time and then periods of 3.5-5 minutes were reported as acceptable for removing very thin layers of only 1.2-3.5 nanometers. The resulting indicated etching rates were about 1 minute per nanometer (1 minute per 10 Angstroms). These relatively slow etching rates would provide commercially unfeasible processing times of 5-100 minutes where layers of 50-1000 Angstroms are to be removed. Such processing times are sufficiently slow to prevent acceptance of the van der Heide vapor processing as a substitute to the faster processing times possible using the prevalent immersion processing.\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,749,440 to Blackwood et al. shows a gaseous process for removing films from substrates which utilizes an anhydrous HF supply. The process is described to involve passing a flow of dry nitrogen over the wafer and then introducing a flow of reactive gas which is preferably an anhydrous hydrogen halide gas such as anhydrous hydrogen fluoride gas. A flow of water vapor laden nitrogen is also passed over the wafer before the anhydrous HF gas flow is begun and this is continued until after the anhydrous HF gas flow has been stopped. This type of processing leads to nonhomogeneous mixing occurring during the brief processing period of approximately 5-30 seconds. During the initial period exclusively water laden carrier gas is first introduced. This subjects the surface of the wafer to a high gradient moisture increase over a very short period of time. This is immediately followed by anhydrous HF gas which is incapable of reaching any effectively uniform homogeneous or equilibrium condition with the water vapor because of the prior introduction of the water vapor and the quickly terminated introduction of the HF which creates a highly reactive combination varying from point to point across the wafer surface. The resulting highly reactive but nonhomogeneous etchant gas is capable of high etch rates. Unfortunately, the results using this process have proven to be highly variable with nonuniform etching on the same device being a common problem as well as nonuniformity from one device to the next. Acceptance of this processing system was initially enthusiastic but has been nearly abandoned by chip manufacturers because of the seriousness of the nonuniformity problem in etching rates.\n\nThe nonuniformity problem also results from variations in the amount of water present in the matrix of the material being processed which can have very significant effects on the effective localized concentrations of the reactants on the surface of the chip during the high speed reactions which occur during this type of processing. Wafers otherwise processed in a similar manner may exhibit highly differing processing rates merely because they have been allowed to sit for hours under ambient conditions thereby uptaking atmospheric moisture to a substantially greater degree than other wafers processed soon out of a furnace or other moisture eliminating processing. Such variations in moisture content of the wafers are typical and any special pre-atmospheric treatment necessarily increases processing time, processing logistics, or both.\n\nAnother more recent approach to vapor etching of wafers is incorporated into the processing machine referred to as the EDGE 2000 from Advantage Production Technology. This system utilizes a specially configured processing chamber which vacuum treats the wafer prior to processing with the etchant. This approach attempts to remove residual moisture from the wafer to address the nonuniform etching rate problem discussed above. The relatively short duration vacuum processing cannot remove all moisture content variations. The wafer is exposed to a highly reactive HF-water gas stream which is directed at the wafer in a vertical orientation from one or both sides. The jet of incoming reactant gas impinges upon the surface or surfaces of the wafer at localized central areas and typically results in non-uniformities in mass transfer due to this localized impingement despite the vacuum processing directed toward water removal.\n\nA deficiency of both of the above processes is the relatively poor ability of these techniques in removing metallic ions or other metallic contaminants which may exist either as impurities in the oxide layer or as particulate contaminants which have adhered to the surface of the wafer. It is now common to use a series of cleaning processes after etching of silicon wafers. Dilute hydrofluoric acid treatment followed by processing in water, hydrogen peroxide and ammonium hydroxide is a common cleaning approach. This is typically followed by processing in water, hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid to further clean the wafers. These cleaning processes are in addition to prior HF etching. Such a series of processing steps is time-consuming and adds to product cost.\n\nPrior of this invention there has been a long-felt need in the art for one-step processing which will provide uniform and repeatable etching results while achieving low contamination rates and cleaning of metallic ions and other metallic impurities and particulates. Other objectives and advantages of the invention are also indicated herein.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nPreferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which are briefly described below.\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic side sectional view showing a preferred configuration for vapor processing wafers according to this invention.\n\nFIG. 2 is a further schematic side sectional view showing another preferred configuration for vapor processing wafers according to this invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\nThis disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the Patent Laws \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\" (Article 1, Section 8).\n\nThe novel processes according to this invention involve the production of a vapor mixture or solution which is used as a processing gas for combined etching and cleaning. The etching and cleaning agents are typically acids. Hydrogen-halide acids are preferred. The preferred methods use hydrofluoric acid vapor, hydrochloric acid vapor and water vapor. The water vapor acts as a diluent and is important in inducing the reactivity of the hydrofluoric acid. The hydrofluoric acid vapor acts as the etching vapor. The hydrochloric acid vapor acts as a cleaning agent solubilizing metals, metallic ions, and other contaminant particles. The vaporous solubilization of the contaminants allow for volatilizing the contaminant particles from the surface of the wafer to provide improved particle counts as a result processing.\n\nThe manner of producing and presenting the vapor mixture to the semiconductor wafer or similar article being processed is of great significance in the achievement of a commercially viable process of suitable benefits to warrant use in the semiconductor chip manufacturing industry. The vapor mixture is preferably produced in a manner which generates a nearly homogeneous vapor mixture of these constituents which acts as a reactant processing gas. The vapor mixture is most preferably in equilibrium with a liquid phase supplying the vapors. The liquid phase source is also preferably homogeneously mixed or in solution.\n\nThe processing gas has been found effective at both etching oxide and nitride layers and additionally to simultaneously remove metals, metallic ions and other particulates from the wafer. A typical utilization of the processes is in the removal silicon dioxide layers from silicon wafers with combined metallic particulate removal to achieve a very clean etch and very low particle count in a relatively quick and highly cost effective one-step process. The processes are also potentially applicable to the processing of other wafer and substrate materials, such as gallium arsenide and indium containing semiconductors.\n\nThe processing gas is advantageously produced from a homogeneous liquid mixture or solution of the etchant, cleaning agent and diluent. Preferably the processing gas is made of hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and water which forms a source for the desired homogeneous equilibrium vapor processing gas. Alternative etchant, cleaning and diluent components may also be operable. The equilibrium liquid processing solution is advantageously comprised of water and combined amounts of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids in sufficient amounts to provide relative molar concentrations in the approximate range of 1:100 to 1:1 (combined hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid:water). More preferably, the liquid source of the processing vapor includes amounts sufficient to provide relative molar concentrations in the approximate range of 1:50 to 1:5 (acids:water).\n\nThe relative amounts of the hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids in the processing solutions are typically in the approximate range of 5:1 to 20:1 (hydrofluoric acid:hydrochloric acid).\n\nThe hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and water used in preparing the preferred liquid processing solutions are advantageously of very high purity without contaminating particles of organic or inorganic materials. Purity levels of the highest or nearly highest degree obtainable with chemical purification techniques now available are most appropriate.\n\nThe processing liquid mixture is advantageously maintained at a temperature suitable for producing vapor pressures of the constituents which cause good evolution of vapor to speed processing. Liquid processing fluid temperatures in the range of 10Â°-100Â° C. are appropriate. Temperatures in the range of 20Â°-40Â° C. are more preferred, with ambient temperatures of 20Â°-25Â° C. most typical.\n\nThe vapor processing is preferably done within an enclosed or confined processing chamber at pressures which are sufficiently high to prevent boiling of the liquid processing fluid. Processing pressures in the approximate range of 100-2000 torr are operable dependent upon temperature of the liquid mixture. Pressures in the range of 500-1500 torr are more preferable with atmospheric pressures in the range of 600-900 torr most preferable.\n\nThe liquid phase processing mixture can advantageously be assisted into vapor formation by a suitable vaporization enhancer. The vaporizing of the liquid phase can be enhanced by a suitable agitating, such as by circulating through a recycle system as described below, or otherwise agitating the processing liquid. It is alternatively, or additionally possible to use ultrasonic agitation to enhance vapor formation. Enhanced vapor formation can serve to increase processing throughput and availability of the vapor phase mixture to the wafer being processed.\n\nThe homogeneous processing gases used in the novel processes of this invention are preferably presented to a wafer being processed so as to uniformly contact the surface or surfaces being acid processed. The use of carrier gas is specifically not employed because of the inventor's identification of substantial complicating and derogatory effects of such an approach. Carrier gases tend not only to dilute the vapor and reduce etch rates, but also to represent substantial additional problems in maintaining homogeneity and effective etching upon the surface of the wafer being processed.\n\nThe preferred processing gases are contacted against the processed surface of the wafer in a manner specifically designed to minimize the potential for nonhomogeneity and variations in the microscopic localized concentrations of the mixed acids and water. The processing rates of aqueous hydrofluoric acid mixtures vary dramatically as a function of differing relative concentrations of these constituents. Such variations have plagued the semiconductor industry resulting in uneven etch rates which are increasingly troublesome in chips having smaller and smaller feature sizes. A preferred manner of presenting the processing vapors is to generate the vapors from a pool of homogeneous liquid mixture which is in close physical proximity to the wafer surface. This is advantageously accomplished by forming a pool of the liquid source mixture which is maintained in a homogeneous condition by suitable mixing. The wafer is then processed by closely positioning the wafer to the source pool.\n\nThe preferred manner of presentation of the processing vapors to the processed wafer surface or surfaces is also to orient the processed surface to face downwardly. This presents the treated surface in a manner which resists particle migration to the surface by the force of gravity. It is also advantageous in bringing the processed surface of the wafer in closer proximity and juxtaposition to the source of vapor and improves the mass transfer between the source and surface to maintain high etch rates and good solubilization of metallic particles and ions. The wafer surface being processed is preferably in the approximate range of 2-100 millimeters from the surface of the liquid etchant source to facilitate circulation and mass transfer.\n\nThe novel processes of this invention also include rotating the wafer during the presentation of the vapors to provide uniform dispersion of the processing gas over the entire processed surface of the wafer. The rotating of the wafer being processed is also significant in creating circulation which provides adequate mass transfer between the source, vapor and surface being treated. At sufficient rotational speeds a vortex action develops which can be significant in providing the desired mass transfer and circulation. These dynamic flows in the circulating processing vapors also are significant in maintaining homogeneity and equilibrium in the vapor phase so that etch rates are uniform across the wafer and repeatable from wafer to wafer.\n\nThe rotating action of the wafer is preferably at rotational speeds of at least 20 revolutions per minute (rpm). Speeds less than 20 rpm have been found inadequate to fulfill the processing needs of the system. More advantageously, the relative wafer rotational speeds are in the approximate range of 20-1000 rpm because excessive speeds have been determined to cause a substantial derogatory effect in particle counts on the wafer. Although the specific mechanism is not known with precision, it is believed that the high rotational speeds cause such extensive turbulence that particles are agitated to a point causing migration onto the wafer surface from either the liquid source or the processing equipment. High rotational speeds may also cause electrical charge (static electricity) to develop which may aggravate the potential, otherwise raised by the turbulence, for particle migration.\n\nAlthough rotational speeds in the range of 20-1000 rpm are operable, experimentation has indicated that rotational speeds in the range of approximately 30-800 rpm are improved in maintaining low particle counts as compared to rotational speeds outside this range. Still further significant improvement has been shown when the rotational speeds are in the range of approximately 50-400 rpm. Still further preferred are rotational speeds in the approximate range of 50-250 rpm.\n\nThe novel processes of this invention further advantageously include drying the wafer after the acid vapor phase processing described above. The vapor processing can lead to condensation of the vapors onto the surface of the wafers. The drying advantageously includes a post-acid-processing spin cycle immediately after the vapor phase processing described above. The wafer is rotated as during the vapor phase processing or with increased rotational speeds greater than 1000 rpm. Spinning speeds in the approximate range 1000-3000 rpm are suitable, with speeds of 1000-2000 most preferred.\n\nThe spin processing can be assisted by also passing a flow of suitable drying gas through the processing chamber to further supplement or finalize the drying process. The drying gas is preferably a non-reactive gas, such as nitrogen or an inert gas. The drying gas can be heated or supplied at ambient temperatures. Drying gas having temperatures in the range of 0Â°-200Â° C. are appropriate, with temperatures in the range 20Â°-100Â° C. more preferred. The drying gas is preferably supplied so as to impinge upon the processed surface or surfaces being dried.\n\nFIG. 1 shows relevant portions of a preferred semiconductor processing machine adapted for carrying out the novel processes of this invention. Processing machine 10 includes a movable head 12 which mates with a processing bowl 14 to confine an enclosed processing chamber 16. Processing head 12 includes a suitable wafer holder 30 for holding a wafer 20 using fingers 34 in a desired orientation with the processed surface facing downwardly. The wafer holder 30 is provided with a motor or other drive (not shown) which is connected to the drive shaft 31 to rotate the wafer in the desired rotational processing described above.\n\nThe arrangement shown in FIG. 1 includes the wafer 20 in superposition above a subjacent pool 40 of the liquid source for the gaseous processing fluid. The proximity distance Dp defines the amount of separation between the upper level of the liquid processing fluid source and the wafer surface being processed. The preferred range of Dp is the indicated 2-100 millimeters. The processed surface of wafer 20 is in directly opposite juxtaposition to the subjacent pool 40.\n\nThe processing machine 10 is also advantageously provided with a means for maintaining a homogeneous mixture of the liquid phase constituents. This is suitably provided in the form of a central drain 50 which has a system outflow line 51 through which liquid is drained through drain valve 52 to a disposal line 53. The outflow line 51 is advantageously branched to form a recycle line 55 which empties into a reservoir 60. Reservoir 60 can advantageously be provided with a suitable heater, such as a thermostatically controlled electric resistance heating coil 63 for maintaining the processing liquid at a desired temperature.\n\nReservoir 60 is provided with an outflow in the form of pump feed line 61 which communicates fluid to the inflow side of a suitable pump 65. Pump 65 and outlet valve 68 are controlled to deliver a supply of the processing liquid to form pool 40 in the lower portions of processing chamber 16. A reservoir recycle control valve 56 is provided to allow control of the level of pool 40.\n\nThe processor 10 also advantageously is provided with an ultrasonic agitator 75 of suitable design. Agitator 75 can be activated during the acid processing to enhance vapor formation.\n\nFIG. 1 also shows that the processing chamber 16 is further fitted with a drying gas introduction port 76 which receives nitrogen or other drying gas from drying gas supply line 77. The drying gas can be input into the processing chamber via a plurality of circumferentially spaced ports which are at approximately the same elevation as the wafer or slightly below and oriented to direct the flow of drying gas across the processed wafer surface.\n\nThe processor 10 is operated to carry out the described processes. Prior to the combined etching and cleaning, the wafer 20 is otherwise suitably processed in a variety of related processing steps dependent on the particular integrated circuit product being produced. The head 12 is loaded with wafer 20 which is held in position by the wafer holder. The head is then positioned in sealing relationship with the bowl 14 or otherwise suitably adjusted to confine the processing chamber against drafts and other substantial leakages which might affect the homogeneous vapor phase which is being presented for contacting and etching and cleaning the processed surface of wafer 20.\n\nThe bowl is thereafter filled with the source liquid for producing the processing vapor using pump 65, supply line 66 and suitable control of valves 52, 56 and 58. The wafer is preferably rotated at a suitable speed, as indicated, during the filling operation and maintained briefly to better establish an equilibrium condition between the liquid processing fluid source and the vapor phase processing gas within the processing chamber adjacent the wafer surface. This equilibrium can typically be established within 10 seconds to 1 minute depending on the size and proximity spacing of the system. The agitator 75 or recycle loop through reservoir 60 can be used to assist in the production of vapor from the liquid phase. The rotation of the wafer at the desired speed is continued to perform the combined etching and cleaning. Processing times are commonly in the approximate range 30 seconds to 3 minutes, with 1 minute times most typical. Pump 65 and valves 56 and 68 can be suitably controlled to recycle the source liquid to maintain homogeneity and to filter the liquid through recycle filter 67 which is preferably a 0.1 micron or smaller filter to remove particles from the liquid during recycle.\n\nAfter the etching has suitably been completed then the valve 56 is opened and the pool of processing source liquid is drained to reservoir 60 for reuse. Alternatively, it can be drained through valve 52 when it is expended. After the pool 40 has been drained the wafer rotational speed can advantageously be increased to speeds typically in the range of approximately 1000-2000 rpm to assist in the removal of any condensed vapor and to minimize the potential for residue. Such post-acid-processing spinning is typically done for periods of 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or as appropriate. The post-treatment spin can be performed while also passing a flow of drying gas through the chamber using inlet port 76.\n\nAfter the post-etching spin, the head is removed upwardly and the wafer removed in any suitable manner for subsequent processing.\n\nFIG. 2 shows portions of an alternative processing machine 110 similar to machine 10 described above. The notable difference is in the provision of a perimeter trench 117 in processing bowl 114 for confining the processing fluid pool 140 therein about the periphery of the wafer 120. The wafer and supporting wafer holders preferably extend in close proximity to create vapor circulation between the toroid-shaped pool and the processed lower surface of wafer 120. Drain 150 and outflow line 151 are similarly connected to a recycle and drain system such as described above with reference to FIG. 1. The system shown in FIG. 2 is operated using processes the same or similar to that described above.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nLiquid processing fluid was prepared in a molar ratio of 160:16:1 (water:hydrofluoric acid:hydrochloric acid) by mixing these components in the typical manner of mixing acids and water. The processing fluids were input into a processor similar to FIG. 1 and recirculated to mix and further assure homogeneity. The liquid processing fluid was then drained to reservoir and the processing chamber opened and a wafer was installed. The processing fluid was maintained at ambient temperature. The wafer and head assembly were placed in position to enclose the processing chamber and the wafer rotated at approximate 100 rpm at a distance of approximately 7.5 millimeters. The pressure within the processing chamber was atmospheric. Fluid from the reservoir was then supplied into the processing chamber bowl and the vapor phase concentrations were allowed to increase for approximately 15 seconds. The wafer was then processed by the vaporous processing fluid for an additional 60 seconds. Thereafter the processing chamber was supplied with a flow of drying nitrogen gas at approximately 2 psig and ambient temperature. The rotor speed was increased to approximately 2000 rpm during the drying of the wafer which lasted approximately 2 minutes. The wafer was thereafter removed and examined to determine that etching had occurred with acceptable uniformity. Particle counts had decreased relative to counts made before processing.\n\nIn compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural features. It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown, since the means and construction herein disclosed comprise a preferred form of putting the invention into effect.
