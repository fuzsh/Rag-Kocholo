        "text": "(Susan M. Pigott is a fountain pen collector, pen and paperholic, photographer, and professor. You can find more from Susan on her blog Scribalishess.)\n\nBrad sent me the Fountain Pen Friendly Paper Collection by Yamamoto Paper to review several months back. It sat quietly in my queue, until one evening, a few weeks ago, I removed the plastic and flipped through the pad. I was stunned into silence. I’ve received paper collections before, but I’ve never seen anything like this one. Preceding each set of paper there’s a golden parchment page that details where the paper is made, the history behind the paper, and a brief description of its characteristics.\n\nI totally geeked out, reading the descriptions then tracing my fingers over each paper, feeling its smoothness or texture, measuring its thickness, delighting in its crinkles as I turned the pages. Audible gasps and exclamations of “Ooooo,” emerged from my home office. I carried the pad reverently into the living room where I told my husband that I was holding a veritable treasure trove of precious paper. He just shook his head and went back to reading his book. I do not understand him.\n\nThe paper in this collection isn’t just paper. Rather, each set reflects the science and artistry of various paper makers who developed the paper for specific purposes. I am fascinated by this, because the interaction between pen, ink, and paper is often a mysterious alchemy. Some papers bring out the vibrant colors and sheen of ink. Other papers offer a more tactile writing experience because of their texture. Still others have the perfect combination of thickness, texture, and absorption that makes writing an absolute pleasure. And who doesn’t love the crinkly feel and sound of quality paper?\n\nBelow, I include the description of each paper (as written by Yamamoto Paper) followed by my own observations. To test the paper, I used twelve pens with various nibs and ink types and eight different inks for swabbing. I wanted to offer a variety of nib sizes from fine to extra broad (music). I also attempted to use many different brands of inks, but ultimately I emphasized color over manufacturer variety.\n\nThis is part one of my review, in which I discuss the first nine papers in the collection. Next week I will review the remaining nine.\n\nPens\n\nI’m a huge fan of Tomoe River paper, so the fact that the company plans to outsource manufacturing disturbs me. I hope the paper retains its quality. As I said above, you can find Tomoe River paper from many different sources now, but my favorite journal with Tomoe River is the Seven Seas Writer.\n\nNo. 4 ~ New Chiffon Cream (75 gsm)\n\nNew Chiffon Cream is a light-cream colored book paper that is thick, light, and soft. Book paper, or high bulk paper, was developed to meet the needs of publishers who wanted a paper that balanced portability with thickness. It is a paper with low fiber density that is very light for its thickness. Its lightness makes it easy to carry without being brittle. It is suited for printing both text and images, and does not allow any bleed-through on the page. In addition to these great properties, New Chiffon Cream is PH neutral so it does not discolor over time, offering great archivability. In our ink tests, Sailor and Platinum inks dried almost immediately and showed no bleed-through. Some very wet inks, such as J. Herbin inks, showed slight bleed-through. However, the slightly rough surface provides a wonderful feel when writing. We at Yamamoto Paper like this paper so much, that we use it in our very own > > > > > > RO-BIKI NOTE> > > > > > notebooks. We highly recommend using this paper with ballpoints and fountain pens.\n\nOh myyyy, I love this paper. It is buttery soft with a bit of texture, quite unlike Tomoe River paper. Ink soaks in and dries quickly, so you won’t experience smudging while writing (lefties take note!) The first word that came to mind when I started my pen tests on this paper was “yummy.” Truly, this paper is delightful to write on. Sheen lovers may not care for this paper as it soaks up ink too quickly for much sheen to form. Nevertheless, it does exhibit good shading.\n\nKin Kaku Den is a truly unique paper. You can actually see the glimmer mentioned in Yamamoto’s description when you hold the pen in direct sunlight. The lovely texture of the paper is noticeable when you rub it between your fingers. Unfortunately, since the paper manufacturer has ceased operations, the only way you can obtain this Kin Kaku Den is in the Yamamoto collection.\n\n~~~\n\nI have had so much fun testing each of the papers in the Yamamoto collection. Next week I will review the remaining paper samples.\n\nI can say, unequivocally, that, if you are a paper geek like me, you simply must purchase the Yamamoto Fountain Pen Friendly Paper Collection. Even though the Yamamoto Etsy Store isn’t open right now, you can find this brilliant collection at site sponsor JetPens for $39.50.\n\n(Yamamoto Paper provided the Fountain Pen Friendly Paper Collection to Pen Addict at no cost for review purposes.)"
