        "text": "This relatively simple smart device attaches to and elevates your existing door opener so that you can monitor or control it from anywhere—some let you view your garage through a camera—and receive alerts about any activity. You can also share access to your controller through the app with family members or anyone else you trust who regularly visits your home.\n\nThe Tailwind iQ3 Smart Automatic Garage Controller Pro is the best smart garage-door opener controller we tested. It offers a strong mix of durable, professional-grade hardware, easy in-app control, advanced features such as auto-open and auto-close, and an impressive variety of optional smart-home integrations.\n\nCompatibility: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Control4, Crestron, Google Home, Home Assistant, Hubitat, Samsung SmartThings\n\nThe Tailwind iQ3 Smart Automatic Garage Controller Pro’s sheer number of compatibility options and advanced features, coupled with its solid hardware, excellent performance, and reasonable price, made it the overwhelming favorite in our tests.\n\nThis smart controller comes with a main module and a door sensor wired to the module to determine whether your door is opened or closed. Although Tailwind’s installation is comparatively involved because of that wired door sensor (the other controllers either lacked a door sensor or connected wirelessly), the Tailwind app for Android and iOS walks you through every step along the way.\n\nIn our tests, we found that the installation was worth the extra effort because the wired door sensor translated to particularly reliable performance with no errors, inaccurate alerts, or inconsistencies.\n\nThis controller works with up to three garage doors. It also supports automatic open and close, which worked seamlessly during our testing.\n\nCompatibility: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Shortcuts, Google Home"
