The structure includes a base member for immersion within an electroplating solution. The base member has a central aperture (35) defined by an aperture perimeter (34) formed within the base member. A sealing ring (40) is positioned adjacent to the aperture perimeter. The sealing ring forms a sealing connection with an object to be electroplated (24). A number of electrical contacts (36) are positioned adjacent to the sealing ring. The electrical contacts form an electrical connection with one side of the object to be electroplated (24). A lid is positioned on the base member over one side of the cental aperture.
