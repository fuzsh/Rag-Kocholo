Five 6-foot (2 meter) cables are provided to connect form the TR-4800E to the BHP to allow remote placement of the bulkhead panel.\n\nWet and Dry modes are easily selected for each GPO and GPI via a slide switches and no rewiring required. All GPIO are broken out to 2-pin removable terminal blocks to allow easy wiring. Additionally the BHP has a cable strain relief bar runs across the middle of the panel to provide a tie point for the GPIO cables.\n\nFeatures"
