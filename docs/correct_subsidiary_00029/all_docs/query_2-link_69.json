        "text": "(Kimberly (she/her) took the express train down the fountain pen/stationery rabbit hole and doesn't want to be rescued. She can be found on Instagram @allthehobbies because there really are many, many hobbies!.)\n\nI did a review of the Rhodia GoalBook a while back because it was what I use for my loose interpretation of the Bullet Journal (BuJo or bujo) method for planning. My first bujo in 2017 was a Leuchtturm, which had 70gsm paper. It was fine and had somewhat/mostly fountain pen-friendly, but I switched to GoalBook because of the index and calendars (though I stopped using those after time) and hadn’t looked back. Flash forward to now and I just finished GoalBook #8 last week, but there won’t be a GoalBook #9. Why? After trying out the Leuchtturm 120 gsm notebook oh-so-briefly at the Shoppe Object show back in August, and seeing that it looked to be FP-friendly, I knew I had to do it for science!\n\nIn addition to the slightly broader lines, the writing experience on the LT 120 is a little “squishier” than other paper/notebooks, probably due to the additional weight. I hesitate to say that it has a bit more feedback than the GoalBook because it is still quite smooth. It is difficult to describe but it just feels like there is a bit more resistance, which I am attributing to the heavier weight. It isn’t unpleasant, just different.\n\nAnd here are some “rare” additional pictures of spreads that I have in my bujo; “rare” because my bujo isn’t really for pretty social media posts. Mine has always been a functional bujo. I will add some more washi tape to color it up a bit but that’s about as much decorating as I do.\n\nI made a simple grid spreadsheet for habit tracking and at the start of the month, I jot down the date/day and what habits I’m tracking. My aim isn’t necessarily to have everything checked every day (though some are daily habits), but more so I can see when I’ve done something and if it’s been a while, to make sure I get back to it. I print several copies so I have them in the back cover whenever a new month comes up."
