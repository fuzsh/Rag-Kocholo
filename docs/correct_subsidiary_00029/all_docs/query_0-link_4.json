Extended out-time enables companies to construct and assemble large-scale structures before the prepreg reaches the end of its processing shelf life. The NTC-425 architecture is also capable of parts production via out of autoclave (OOA) without the need for complicated debulks or curing processes; its flexible processing also enables autoclave and vacuum bagging production methods.\n\nAccording to Nexx Technologies, Enduredge NTC-425 prepreg creates Z-directional engineered air release channels that offer optimized vacuum bag-only (VBO)/OOA capabilities. Additionally, NTC-425 initially cures at a lower temperature (121ºC), ensuring dimensional stability for parts that will then be post-cured off the tool (freestanding). As a result, the fabricator can then use lower temperature capable tooling. After post-cure, the material reaches a final Tg of 200°C.\n\n“NTC-425 provides excellent mechanical properties along with low moisture absorption and outgassing,” Joseph Kidd, general manager at Nexx Technologies, says. “For projects that may require an extended time to layup, NTC-425 is the ideal choice for its unbeatable out-time. Our vertical integration of cyanate ester resin production will allow us to provide a definite advantage to our customers in both availability and costing.”\n\nEnduredge NTC-425 Cyanate Ester System is available in numerous carbon fiber fabrics, fiberglass and quartz, as well as unidirectional tapes (UD).
