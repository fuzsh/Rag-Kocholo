In the event that such rate does not appear on Page BBAM of the Bloomberg Financial Markets Information Service (or otherwise on such Service) on any day, the “Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate” for such day shall be determined by reference to such other publicly available service for displaying eurodollar rates as may be reasonably selected by Bank, or, in the absence of such other service, the “Daily Adjusting LIBOR Rate” for such day shall, instead, be determined based upon the average of the rates at which Bank is offered dollar deposits at or about 8:00 a.m. (California time) (or as soon thereafter as practical), on such day, or if such day is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day, in the interbank eurodollar market in an amount comparable to the principal amount of the Indebtedness hereunder and for a period equal to one (1) month;\n\n(b)\n\n1.00 minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) on such day at which Bank is required to maintain reserves on “Euro-currency Liabilities” as defined in and pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or, if such regulation or definition is modified, and as long as Bank is required to maintain reserves against a category of liabilities which includes eurodollar deposits or includes a category of assets which includes eurodollar loans, the rate at which such reserves are required to be maintained on such category\n\n(g)\n\nit is a valid, legally enforceable obligation of the Account Debtor thereunder, and is not subject to any asserted offset, counterclaim or other defense on the part of such Account Debtor or to any claim on the part of such Account Debtor denying liability thereunder in whole or in part; provided that to the extent an offset solely arises from Borrower’s liabilities to the Account Debtor for goods sold or services rendered by the Account Debtor to Borrower, any amount owed to Borrower in excess of such offset may be included as an Eligible Account;\n\n(j)\n\nexcept for Eligible Foreign Accounts that are not treated as Eligible Export Related Accounts Receivables (as defined in the Ex-Im Facility Documents) for purposes of the Ex-Im Facility Loans, it is not owing by an Account Debtor which (i) does not maintain its chief executive office in the United States of America or Canada, (ii) is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or Canada, or any state or province thereof, as applicable, or (iii) is the government of any foreign country or sovereign state, or of any state, province, municipality or other instrumentality thereof;\n\n(k)\n\nit is not an Account owing by the United States of America or any state or political subdivision thereof, or by any department, agency, public body corporate or other instrumentality of any of the foregoing, unless all necessary steps are taken to comply with the Federal Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended, or with any comparable state law, if applicable, and all other necessary steps are taken to perfect Bank’s security interest in such Account;\n\n(l)\n\nit is not owing by an Account Debtor for which Borrower has received a notice of (i) the death of the Account Debtor or any partner of the Account Debtor, (ii) the dissolution, liquidation, termination of existence, insolvency or business failure of the Account Debtor, (iii) the appointment of a receiver for any part of the property of the Account Debtor, or (iv) an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against the Account Debtor;\n\n(l)\n\nInventory that is in the possession of a processor or bailee, or located on premises leased or subleased to Borrower, or on premises subject to a mortgage in favor of a Person other than Bank, unless such processor or bailee or mortgagee or the lessor or sublessor of such premises, as the case may be, has executed and delivered all documentation which Bank shall require to evidence the subordination or other limitation or extinguishment of such Person’s rights with respect to such Inventory and Bank’s right to gain access thereto;\n\n(a)\n\nany Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, except that if the next succeeding Business Day falls in another calendar month, the Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day, and when an Interest Period begins on a day which has no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month during which such Interest Period is to end, it shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;\n\n(b)\n\n1.00 minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal) during such Interest Period at which Bank is required to maintain reserves on “Eurocurrency Liabilities” as defined in and pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or, if such regulation or definition is modified, and as long as Bank is required to maintain reserves against a category of liabilities which includes eurodollar deposits or includes a category of assets which includes eurodollar loans, the rate at which such reserves are required to be maintained on such category.\n\n(a)\n\nAt least 15 days prior to the date of the Acquisition, Borrower shall have delivered to Bank notice of the Acquisition together with pro forma financial statements of Borrower showing the effect of the Acquisition on a pro forma basis as if it been consummated on at the beginning of the current fiscal year and that it will not result and if so consummated would not have resulted in an Event of Default, and copies of all material documents relating to the Acquisition, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank;\n\n(c)\n\nThe sum of the purchase price of the proposed Acquisition, computed on the basis of total consideration paid or incurred, or to be paid or incurred, by Borrower with respect thereto, including the amount of Debt assumed or to which such assets, businesses or business or ownership interests or shares, or any Person so acquired, is subject, is not greater than $1,000,000.00 for any one Acquisition and does not exceed $1,000,000.00 for all Acquisitions consummated within any 12 month period.\n\n(g)\n\nLiens securing Permitted Purchase Money Debt, provided that (i) such Liens shall be created substantially simultaneously with the acquisition of such fixed or capital asset, (ii) such Liens do not at any time encumber any property other than the property, equipment or improvements financed by such Debt, and (iii) the principal amount of Debt secured by any such Lien shall at no time exceed 100% of the original purchase price of such property, Inventory, equipment or improvements and related costs and charges imposed by the vendors thereof.\n\n1.\n\nThe Borrower (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and (b) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry out its business as, to our knowledge, now owned and conducted and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations set forth in each Loan Document. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation, of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower by Lender in accordance with their\n\n2.\n\nThe execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by the Borrower will not constitute (i) a breach of the Borrower’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii) a violation by the Borrower of the DGCL or any statute, rule, regulation or law of the United States of America or Massachusetts law known to us to be applicable to the Borrower, or (iii) a default under any material contract listed on Exhibit B hereto.\n\n3.\n\nTo our knowledge, the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by the Borrower does not require the Borrower to give any notice to, to obtain any exemption by, to make any registration, declaration or filing (other than filing the Financing Statements and continuation statements and filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office) with or to take any other actions in respect of, any government or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over Borrower, except for such consents, notices, exemptions, registrations, declarations and filings as have been given or made and except for such consents, notices, exemptions, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required by EX-IM.\n\n1.\n\nCreditor subordinates to Bank any security interest or lien that Creditor may have in any property of Borrower. Notwithstanding the respective dates of attachment or perfection of the security interest of Creditor and the security interest of Bank, the security interest of Bank in the Collateral, as defined in the Credit Agreement between Borrower and Bank, dated June ____, 2010, as amended from time to time (the “Credit Agreement”), shall at all times be prior to the security interest of Creditor.\n\n3.\n\nCreditor will not demand or receive from Borrower (and Borrower will not pay to Creditor) all or any part of the Subordinated Debt, by way of payment, prepayment, setoff, lawsuit or otherwise, nor will Creditor exercise any remedy with respect to the Collateral, nor will Creditor commence, or cause to commence, prosecute or participate in any administrative, legal or equitable action against Borrower, for so long as any portion of the Senior Debt remains outstanding. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Creditor from converting all or any part of the Subordinated Debt into equity securities of Borrower.\n\n6.\n\nFor so long as any of the Senior Debt remains unpaid, Creditor irrevocably appoints Bank as Creditor’s attorney-in-fact, and grants to Bank a power of attorney with full power of substitution, in the name of Creditor or in the name of Bank, for the use and benefit of Bank, without notice to Creditor, to perform at Bank’s option the following acts in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving Borrower:\n\n7.\n\nFor so long as any of the Senior Debt remains unpaid, Creditor agrees that it will not object to or oppose (i) the sale of the Borrower, or (ii) the sale or other disposition of any property of the Borrower, if Bank has consented to such sale of the Borrower or sale or disposition of any property of the Borrower. If requested by Bank, Creditor shall affirmatively consent to such sale or disposition and shall take all necessary actions and execute such documents and instruments as Bank may reasonably request in connection with and to facilitate such sale or disposition.\n\n8.\n\nCreditor shall immediately affix a legend to the instruments evidencing the Subordinated Debt stating that the instruments are subject to the terms of this Agreement. No amendment of the documents evidencing or relating to the Subordinated Debt shall directly or indirectly modify the provisions of this Agreement in any manner which might terminate or impair the subordination of the Subordinated Debt or the subordination of the security interest or lien that Creditor may have in any property of Borrower. By way of example, such instruments shall not be amended to (i) increase the rate of interest with respect to the Subordinated Debt, or (ii) accelerate the payment of the principal or interest or any other portion of the Subordinated Debt.\n\n9.\n\nThis Agreement shall remain effective for so long as Borrower owes any amounts to Bank under the Credit Agreement or otherwise. If, at any time after payment in full of the Senior Debt any payments of the Senior Debt must be disgorged by Bank for any reason (including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of Borrower), this Agreement and the relative rights and priorities set forth herein shall be reinstated as to all such disgorged payments as though such payments had not been made and Creditor shall immediately pay over to Bank all payments received with respect to the Subordinated Debt to the extent that such payments would have been prohibited hereunder. At any time and from time to time, without notice to Creditor, Bank may take such actions with respect to the Senior Debt as Bank, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, terminating advances to Borrower, increasing the principal amount, extending the time of payment, increasing applicable interest rates, renewing, compromising or otherwise amending the terms of any documents affecting the Senior Debt and any collateral securing the Senior Debt, and enforcing or failing to enforce any rights against Borrower or any other person. No such action or inaction shall impair or otherwise affect Bank’s rights hereunder. Creditor waives the benefits, if any, of Civil Code Sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845, 2847, 2848, 2849, 2850, 2899 and 3433.\n\n10.\n\nThis Agreement shall bind any successors or assignees of Creditor and shall benefit any successors or assigns of Bank. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of Creditor and Bank and not for the benefit of Borrower or any other party. Creditor further agrees that if Borrower is in the process of refinancing a portion of the Senior Debt with a new lender, and if Bank makes a request of Creditor, Creditor shall agree to enter into a new subordination agreement with the new lender on substantially the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n12.\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles. Jurisdiction shall lie in the State of California. THE UNDERSIGNED ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ONE, BUT THAT IT MAY BE WAIVED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY, AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF ITS, HIS OR HER CHOICE, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES, WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT, INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNDERSIGNED PARTIES.\n\n(b)\n\nWith the exception of the items specified in clause (c), below, any controversy, dispute or claim (each, a “Claim”) between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other document, instrument or agreement between the undersigned parties (collectively in this Section, the “Loan Documents”), will be resolved by a reference proceeding in California in accordance with the provisions of Sections 638 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”), or their successor sections, which shall constitute the exclusive remedy for the resolution of any Claim, including whether the Claim is subject to the reference proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, venue for the reference proceeding will be in the Superior Court in the County where the real property involved in the action, if any, is located or in a County where venue is otherwise appropriate under applicable law (the “Court”).\n\n(c)\n\nThe matters that shall not be subject to a reference are the following: (i) nonjudicial foreclosure of any security interests in real or personal property, (ii) exercise of selfhelp remedies (including, without limitation, set-off), (iii) appointment of a receiver and (iv) temporary, provisional or ancillary remedies (including, without limitation, writs of attachment, writs of possession, temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions). This Agreement does not limit the right of any party to exercise or oppose any of the rights and remedies described in clauses (i) and (ii) or to seek or oppose from a court of competent jurisdiction any of the items described in clauses (iii) and (iv). The exercise of, or opposition to, any of those items does not waive the right of any party to a reference pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n(d)\n\nThe referee shall be a retired Judge or Justice selected by mutual written agreement of the parties. If the parties do not agree within ten (10) days of a written request to do so by any party, then, upon request of any party, the referee shall be selected by the Presiding Judge of the Court (or his or her representative). A request for appointment of a referee may be heard on an ex parte or expedited basis, and the parties agree that irreparable harm would result if ex parte relief is not granted.\n\n(e)\n\nThe parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the reference proceedings. Accordingly, the referee shall be requested, subject to change in the time periods specified herein for good cause shown, to (i) set the matter for a status and trial-setting conference within fifteen (15) days after the date of selection of the referee, (ii) if practicable, try all issues of law or fact within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the conference and (iii) report a statement of decision within twenty (20) days after the matter has been submitted for decision.\n\n(f)\n\nThe referee will have power to expand or limit the amount and duration of discovery. The referee may set or extend discovery deadlines or cutoffs for good cause, including a party’s failure to provide requested discovery for any reason whatsoever. Unless otherwise ordered based upon good cause shown, no party shall be entitled to “priority” in conducting discovery, depositions may be taken by either party upon seven (7) days written notice, and all other discovery shall be responded to within fifteen (15) days after service. All disputes relating to discovery which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be submitted to the referee whose decision shall be final and binding.\n\n(g)\n\nExcept as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the referee shall determine the manner in which the reference proceeding is conducted including the time and place of hearings, the order of presentation of evidence, and all other questions that arise with respect to the course of the reference proceeding. All proceedings and hearings conducted before the referee, except for trial, shall be conducted without a court reporter, except that when any party so requests, a court reporter will be used at any hearing conducted before the referee, and the referee will be provided a courtesy copy of the transcript. The party making such a request shall have the obligation to arrange for and pay the court reporter. Subject to the referee’s power to award costs to the prevailing party, the parties will equally share the cost of the referee and the court reporter at trial.\n\n(h)\n\nThe referee shall be required to determine all issues in accordance with existing case law and the statutory laws of the State of California. The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding. The referee shall be empowered to enter equitable as well as legal relief, enter equitable orders that will be binding on the parties and rule on any motion which would be authorized in a court proceeding, including without limitation motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The referee shall issue a decision at the close of the reference proceeding which disposes of all claims of the parties that are the subject of the reference. Pursuant to CCP § 644, such decision shall be entered by the Court as a judgment or an order in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court and any such decision will be final, binding and conclusive. The parties reserve the right to appeal from the final judgment or order or from any appealable decision or order entered by the referee. The parties reserve the right to findings of fact, conclusions of laws, a written statement of decision, and the right to move for a new trial or a different judgment, which new trial, if granted, is also to be a reference proceeding under this provision.\n\n(i)\n\nIf the enabling legislation which provides for appointment of a referee is repealed (and no successor statute is enacted), any dispute between the parties that would otherwise be determined by reference procedure will be resolved and determined by arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a retired judge or Justice, in accordance with the California Arbitration Act §1280 through §1294.2 of the CCP as amended from time to time. The limitations with respect to discovery set forth above shall apply to any such arbitration proceeding.\n\n(j)\n\nTHE PARTIES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES, DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RESOLVED UNDER THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL BE DECIDED BY A REFEREE AND NOT BY A JURY. AFTER CONSULTING (OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT) WITH COUNSEL OF ITS, HIS OR HER OWN CHOICE, EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES, AGREES THAT THIS REFERENCE PROVISION WILL APPLY TO ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS."
