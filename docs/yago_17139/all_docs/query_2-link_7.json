        "text": "Nate Hastings on The Young & The Restless is a big player now but he also has a bit of history in Genoa City some newer fans might not be aware of. Nate is the son of Nathan Hastings and Olivia Winters, born back in 1995. After a series of child actors, the character was aged to an adult and played by Walter Fauntleroy in 2011 for a brief stint. Nate returned in July of 2018 portrayed by Brooks Darnell. However, as of the April 10, 2019, episode, the role was taken over by Sean Dominic, who continues to play him to this day.\n\nNate was involved with drama right from the moment he was conceived. Olivia was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but refused to abort her baby to save her own life, and in 1992, Nate Jr. was delivered early but healthy. However, after Nathan cheated on her with a woman who could have exposed them all to HIV, she threw him out of the house. They all tested negative, but Nate was so desperate to see his boy that he kidnapped Nate! After several weeks on the run, Nathan returned his son to Olivia, but was killed in a hit-and-run shortly thereafter.\n\nAs Nate grew up, he grew very fond of his new father, Malcolm Winters, and was upset when Olivia broke things off with him and turned to his brother, Neil Winters. Malcolm was further upset when Olivia changed her will so Neil would raise Nate if anything happened to her. After Malcolm was presumed dead, Nate finally grew closer to Neil, but since he was drowning his sorrows over his brother in alcohol, Olivia tried to keep her son away from him as well.\n\nNate eventually went off to boarding school and in 2008, Olivia mentioned he was in medical school. Then, in 2011, Nate resurfaced in Genoa City as Ronan Malloy’s specialist, treating his liver ailment. He reconnected with his family, including Neil, Malcolm, and his cousins, Lily Winters and Devon Hamilton, but that was the extent of it.\n\nIn July 2018, Nate made a surprise appearance in Genoa City at Neil’s request to secretly treat Victor Newman. He was living in Neil’s penthouse where Hilary Curtis took an instant dislike to the doctor, accusing him of not being able to get a woman. Neil explained to her that Nate had been about to propose to the love of his life, Carolyn, when she died. When a pregnant Hilary was seriously injured in a car accident, Nate tried to save them both, but unfortunately, the baby died, and Hilary’s injuries proved fatal.\n\nNate took over Nikki Newman’s care for her MS, and when she was hit by a car and nearly died, helped get her out of the hospital and to a safe place where she could recuperate. Nate was also there to help support Devon when he threatened to spiral out of control following Hilary’s death. The doctor was also called upon to help save Lola Rosales’ life when she was assaulted and required a liver transplant. And when Victor was suffering from a potentially fatal blood disease, Nate worked to find a way to help him find a cure and navigate the dangerous side effects. The handsome physician’s social life finally took a turn for the better when his friendship with Abby Newman turned into a full-blown romance.\n\nUnfortunately, Nate’s relationship with Abby fizzled out and he found himself adrift for a time. He teamed up with Elena Dawson to open up a clinic to help people in town, but that remained strictly business as she was romantically linked to Devon. However, Nate later found himself drawn to newcomer Amanda Sinclair and asked the attorney out on a date.\n\nHowever, Nate’s real feelings were for Elena, and as the pair continued to work closely together, they only grew. And when she opened up to him about the problems she was having with Devon, things took a turn and the co-workers slept together! Elena was wracked with guilt and wanted to tell Devon what had happened, but Nate left that decision entirely in her hands. But she then decided to confess without giving Nate a heads-up, so when an enraged Devon confronted him, the resulting fight left Nate with an injured hand! Not sure he’d ever be able to perform surgery again left Nate feeling it was his penance and he considered leaving town to get away from the drama.\n\nNate tried to build a relationship with Elena, but that fell apart when he found out she’d cheated on him with Devon. Nate dumped her, but they still had to work together, and were the ones who diagnosed a dying Rey Rosales with thallium poisoning. He also treated Faith Newman after her car accident and saved her life with a kidney transplant. When Elena saved Nate’s life after he had a serious allergic reaction, he asked her not to take the job in Baltimore and they reconciled and got back together. Imani Benedict openly flirted with Nate in front of Elena, but while flattered, he remained faithful. He was disappointed when Moses Winters changed his mind about pursuing medicine but thrilled to be appointed as chief of surgery at the hospital.\n\nStepping down from Ask MD Now, Nate urged Billy and Lily to hire Elena as his replacement. He was also taken aback when Ashland Locke asked him to be his best man at his wedding to Victoria Newman. But he agreed and after the nuptials, invited Elena to move in with him. After the hospital chastised him for dating Elena, Nate quit, intending to take Ashland up on his job offer. But then he was appalled to learn that Locke had been faking his cancer diagnosis and helped expose the mogul’s lies. He then accepted Devon’s offer to be his COO at the newly-formed Chancellor-Winters company.\n\nNate and Elena moved into the penthouse after Chelsea moved out, and he rebuffed her insistence that Imani was after him. He struggled to work with Devon as they constantly butted heads about his ideas and didn’t seem to notice Imani stoking those fires. After losing his temper, Nate decided to quit, but after telling Victoria about the plan to take Chancellor-Winters public, he returned to the fold to act as an inside man so Newman could take a controlling interest in the company and install him as CEO. He met Audra Charles, who Jill had hired to handle the IPO, and gave her the inside dirt on everyone in the office. Unfortunately, when he shared his plan to oust Devon and take over at Chancellor-Winters, Elena was shocked at the man he’d become and decided they needed to take a break.\n\nEventually, a guilty Nate confessed his duplicity to Lily, Devon, Billy, and Audra, though he kept Victoria’s name out of it. Naturally, he was fired from Chancellor-Winters and then Elena left to interview for a job in Baltimore. Victoria offered Nate the CEO position at Newman Media and he eventually accepted. He was also happy when Elena came home and agreed to give him another chance. But after Nate hired Audra as Newman Media’s new COO, Elena wondered if something was going on between them. However, it was actually his attraction to Victoria that had Nate focusing more on work than his girlfriend! Victoria tried tempting Nate into an affair, but he was determined to remain faithful. However, after lying to Elena that he was going on a business trip to L.A. alone, Nate actually went with Victoria and they had sex in her hotel room!\n\nNaturally, when Elena caught the pair together, she dumped Nate like a hot potato and moved out. However, he was happy to be able to publicly date Victoria and also to be offered the job as COO at Newman Enterprises. Nate also continued working with Audra and got her a job running Newman Media. Although many accused Nate of using Victoria, she continued to defend their relationship. Although when he tried to help Audra propose a merger between Adustus and Newman Media, Victoria shut down the idea and Nate promised that he wouldn’t keep any more secrets because he was falling in love with her.\n\nVictor named Adam as Nate’s new assistant and asked Nate to keep an eye on his son. As the paranoia at Newman Enterprises continued to grow, much of the family worried about Victor’s memory and strange behavior. Mamie Johnson asked Nate to return to Chancellor-Winters, but he decided to stay at Newman. But when Victor confided to the family he was having mental health issues and Nate suggested that he seek treatment in a clinic as Victoria took over as CEO, Victor revealed the whole thing had been a ruse to smoke out the traitor and fired Nate on the spot!\n\nNate resisted Victoria’s attempts to reconcile and was surprised when Devon invited him to come back to Chancellor-WInters. He warned Victor that he suspected Nikki was drinking again but he dismissed the idea only to later realize Nate was right. As 2024 began, Nate and Victoria parted as friends and continued to work at Chancellor-Winters where he sided with his family against Billy’s attempts to add Abbott to the company name. He tried to convince Mamie to give up her war against Jill but she wouldn’t listen. And he sided with Lily and Devon to block her attempt to oust Jill and Billy from the company. He also reconnected with Audra and they decided to keep things casual."
