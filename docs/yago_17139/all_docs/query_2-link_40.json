He replaces Brooks Darnell, who took on the role back in July 2018.\n\n“What can I say and where do I start?” opened up the actor in a post on social media before thanking the show and others who’ve helped him reach his dreams. “Blessings to the most high and thank you all who follow me on this journey,” he continued. “Sit tight… we only getting started.”\n\nNate is the son of Nathan Hastings (last played by Adam Lazarre-White) and Olivia Winters (Tonya Lee Williams). The character returned to Genoa City last summer as a doctor, treating several of the town’s most prominent citizens during one disaster after another.\n\nRELATED | ‘Y&R’s’ Kristoff St. John Tribute: Who’s Returning, Who’s Not\n\nIn addition to “Greenleaf,” Dominic has starred in such shows as “Makeup X Breakup” and “Situationships,” among others.\n\nDominic takes over the role beginning with the Wednesday, April 10 episode. No last airdate has been announced for Darnell."
