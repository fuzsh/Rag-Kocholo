        "text": "Viewers will enjoy a very special episode of THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on Friday, May 28. According to Daytime Confidential and Entertainment Weekly, the 3 Winters children will celebrate Neil's life on the second anniversary of his death. Devon, Lily, and Moses will take a walking tour through the city that will be centered on places that were special to their dad. Their cousin Nate Hastings will also celebrate his uncle with them. Neil Winters was a fan favorite in Genoa City and his followers were devastated at the untimely death of his portrayer Kristoff St. John.\n\nThere will be various Genoa City residents who will take part in the tribute episode including Jack Abbott and Victor Newman. The heads of the two legacy families used to be sworn enemies and battled each other for decades, often resorting to unscrupulous methods against one another. They put their differences aside, however, after Neil's memorial service and even shared a drink together. Neil died of a heart attack 3 months after his portrayer Kristoff St. John passed away on February 3, 2019. Jack, Nikki, and Ashley are also said to be taking part in the tribute episode.\n\nNeil initially was working with Jack at Jabot and was involved in a love triangle with Drucilla, her sister Olivia and Nate Hastings. He later became an employee of Newman Enterprises before Devon helped him set up his own company. Nikki and Neil bonded because both were attending Alcoholics Anonymous together and once shared a kiss. while Ashley and Neil once dated for a while.\n\nMoses, the youngest is actually Neil's only biological child. His mother is Sophia who had slept with both Neil and his brother Malcolm by her own choice. Lily's mom Drucilla was Neil's first wife and she also slept with both Winters siblings. The night she was with Malcolm she was high on cough syrup and thought he was Neil and Lily ended up being Malcolm's daughter.\n\nDevon was adopted by Neil and Drucilla and later it turned out that he was the grandson of Katherine Chancellor because Kay's son Tucker McCall is his biological father. The current storyline is linking all of the Genoa City families due to Devon donating his sperm for Chance and Abby's baby. Chance is the grandson of Jill but not a blood relative of Katherine as Devon is. Abby is both Newman and Abbott and Mariah who was impregnated with Devon's sperm is Sharon's daughter.\n\nLily is currently dating Billy Abbott and Moses is becoming closer to Faith Newman. These connections keep the Winters children in close proximity to and makes them a part of the core Genoa City families who preceded Neil's arrival in town. According to PEOPLE, there will be flashbacks of scenes from Kristoff St. John's 3 decades of portraying Neil Winters on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS. This will be delightful for fans who enjoy going down memory lane.\n\nFans were shocked two years ago when the news came that Kristoff St. John was found dead in his home. The official cause of death was hypertrophic heart disease but alcohol may have been a factor. St. John had been grieving the death of his son Julian in 2014 who had taken his own life. The actor had been on the phone with his ex-wife prior to his death and said that he had been talking to Julian. By the time he was found the soap veteran was already dead.\n\nLong time fans of THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS will enjoy these special moments with the family and friends of Neil Winters on Friday so be sure to tune in. On a brighter note, actress Telma Hopkins will join the cast of Y&R on June 1 as Denise Tolliver and will interact with Devon, (Bryton James). During the 1990s Hopkins portrayed Rachel on the ABC hit series FAMILY MATTERS and James played her son Little Richie. This will be tghe first time the duo has shares screen time since the show went off the air in 1998."
