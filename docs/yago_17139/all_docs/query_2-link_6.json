        "text": "Because Olivia introduced the very young Neil to Dru as a way to distract her sister with someone her own age. Only Neil had a crush on Liv and wanted her for himself. He only agreed to the blind date a s way to spend time with Liv, he had no idea she was hoping Nathan would put a ring on her finger.\n\nNathan was a hired thug who fell for the police commissioner’s daughter Amy. Amy worked for Paul and Andy. Nathan was able to get out form under the mob and trained on the job to become a member of Williams Investigations. When Andy left he became Paul’s right hand man. He met Liv while working on a case during a stakeout. I have always believed that if Nathan Purdee had remained in the role he created, Nathan Hastings would have never been written as cheating husband…\n\nYour telling me. I so miss the drama of everyday life that sent us over the edge by waiting to see if a marriage would survive an affair, if the company that was going under would bounce back with a new product to others to shame. The great friendships that lasted through just about every storm regardless of who was apart of the lighting strike. Mysteries that were really Who Done It’s that we didn’t see coming and it wasn’t just blamed on an actor who was scheduled to leave. Any character returning to the show for short stunt was a key player in moving a story along and stayed long enough for it to make sense.\n\nWith Mal Young at the helm I was expecting him to take the show in a more primetime style and really show case the actors at their best by grouping them into stories that were more similar to his UK history of writing/directing. For example, I was really let down with the whole Zack is the pimp s/l that ended with him suddenly unable to carry forth his Mr. Big persona and becoming a begging man wanting Abby to run away with him. It would have been better if he hooked the naked heiress on drugs and had her staring in porn movies. Instead we had her comforting herself and Scott with sex and playing the martyr. Never got that answer as to how Tessa’s sister found Zack given he wasn’t on her call list anymore. Or why she had to implicate Newman Enterprises and Victor as being apart of her bad choices when it was the Newman family who had taken her sister in and was trying to help her get out of prostitution."
