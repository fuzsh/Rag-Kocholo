        "text": "Devon Hamilton and Nate Hastings are cousins, but they didn’t grow up together on The Young and the Restless. Nate had already left town with his mom, Olivia Barber, before Olivia’s sister, Drucilla Winters, and her husband, Neil Winters, adopted a teenage Devon.\n\nYoung and the Restless Polling\n\nThey’re family in name only, though both went along with Lily Winters’s (Christel Khalil) dream of having them all work together — in a company she doesn’t even own. Except that it hasn’t been smooth sailing in the executive suite. The pair are at each other’s throats — professionally speaking. And we wanted to know: Are you Team Devon (Bryton James) or Team Nate (Sean Dominic)?\n\nY&R None of the Above\n\nWho cares, a winning 47% want to know? This entire storyline is a disaster. Nobody is right, everybody is wrong but, what’s worse, it’s boring. We don’t tune into daytime drama in order to watch two grown men squabble over spreadsheets. What goes on between the sheets, yes. Spreadsheets, no. Everyone is a loser with this story.\n\nYoung and the Restless Professionalism\n\nDevon is the expert here, 25% of you would like to remind. He’s worked with Neil (Kristoff St. John), and he’s run his own company. Nate is a babe in the woods who thinks he’s the king of the forest. He should listen more and talk less.\n\nY&R Woman on the Edge\n\nThe person we feel sorriest for is Lily, 15% of fans sigh. She’s the one stuck in the middle, forced to explain her brother to her cousin — and vice-versa. They both need to remember she’s the boss and do what Lily says.\n\nThe Young and the Restless Doctor Is In\n\nNo one is giving Nate a chance, 13% complain. How can he prove that he knows what he’s doing when everyone second-guesses his decisions? The man once held people’s lives in his hands. He can certainly handle a music festival.\n\nThe Young and the Restless (YR) airs weekdays on CBS. Check your local listings for airtimes.
