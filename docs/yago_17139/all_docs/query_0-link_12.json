        "text": "Since Y&R have basically set aside all their story lines for this week to honor KSJ, I thought it would be a good time to ask questions about Neil that perhaps we knew and forgot about, or just remembering him. By the way, I have seen the Cdn. show today and I cannot say enough about the writing, acting and performances for this story. Well done.\n\nMy one question is did Neil and Victoria ever date? I kinda remember something about it, but I am not 100% certain on it.\n\nYes. Victoria got pregnant by her ex-husband Cole Howard.\n\nVictoria and Neil bonded and decided to raise her baby together and planned to marry.\n\nShe went into early labor. A baby they named Eve was born and died.\n\nVictoria and Neil broke up. Neil started dating Olivia, Dru’s sister.\n\nOne of my favorite stories involving him was early on and it involve him, Dru, Olivia, and Nathan Hastings.\n\nOlivia and Nathan were engaged. Dru decided that she wanted to have Nathan.\n\nNeil and Dru teamed up together to try and break them up, only they ended up falling in love with each other!\n\nAnd I always loved his interaction with his kids.\n\nAnother story that I liked was when he was working at Newman Enterprises and the light bulb went off and he realized that the only way to advance in Newman Enterprises beyond the level he was at was to be born a Newman. So he quit and went to work for Chancellor Industries as the CEO. Victor likes to dangle the carrot but Neil was one of the few who actually saw the situation for what it was.\n\nI actually wish the focus of these shows would be solely on Neil. He is still a major force in Y&R.\n\nI remember him with Dru. The complimented each other so well. I always wished whatever dust up happened that resulted in her leaving would have been resolved and the character could have returned. They could have done some powerful stuff with that and Neil and Dru would have been THE solid couple I so long for on a soap.\n\nNeil with Ashley was promising and should have been done years ago.\n\nBasically anytime he was on screen I loved the show. Even in his dark times… I hated some of the material the writers gave him but he certainly pulled it off. Such a professional.\n\nI miss him.\n\nI think they made a mistake killing off the character.\n\nI’m sad that Kristoff has died and I agree that they should have an on-air memorial for him where the actors can talk about him and having worked with him.\n\nBut Neil is an instrumental part of the show and the patriarch of the Winter’s family. Devon does not have the chops to take on that role and wouldn’t be believable in it anyway. He just isn’t masculine enough.\n\nI think they should have waited a few months and then recast the role.\n\nYou have a valid point in that Devon does not have the chops to take on role of patriarch of Hamilton - Winters family But, my opinion, the actor was there so long/would be a disservice to his memory to recast as if they could recast Katherine Chancellor or someday Victor Newman\n\nno…instead I would prefer a recast of Malcolm (since Shemar Moore isn’t coming back) let the new strong Malcolm work with Devon taking over the duties Neil had he is Lily bio father / he is therefore the twins grandfather"
