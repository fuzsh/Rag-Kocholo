Going to tech school was the best decision she ever made! Arielle was born and raised in Arizona with her grandparents and sister. Most of her family is from New York and New Jersey so you could say she's a little ways from home. She has a wide variety of animals at home. She has 2 dogs, 5 cats, 3 leopard geckos, and a guinea pig. They definitely keep her very busy! Some of her hobbies include photography, horseback riding, and playing guitar.\n\nArielle is a Fear Free Certified Professional.\n\nAs a little girl in Oklahoma, Dee would frequently visit her grandfather's rabbitry (rabbit farm) where she fell in love with animals and veterinary medicine.

As a lover of the desert, when she first came to Arizona, she knew it would be her home one day. She has always loved animals and working with them is a big part of her life. She graduated from a school of veterinary medicine in São Paulo in 2009 and worked as a veterinarian until she moved to the USA. Her dream is to validate her degree in the United States and be able to continue her profession here. Working as a Technician at AAWC has been extremely important to her and she is grateful to be able to continue in the veterinary field and learn with other amazing professionals. She loves spending time with her husband, their dog Pita (a 6 yo Karelian Bear dog), and their cat Rado (a 1 yo cat that her husband found under the house where he worked).

She's on a quest to become fear-free certified, aiming to make every pet's visit to the clinic as enjoyable as a belly rub. Her thirst for knowledge doesn't stop there; she dreams of furthering her education in veterinary medicine, fueled by an insatiable curiosity and probably a fair amount of caffeine. Every day is a new adventure, filled with learning opportunities and the occasional surprise—like finding out how many treats it takes to convince Bo and Olivia to vacate her spot on the couch. Teresa believes in laughter, the power of a good book, and the magic of a well-timed coffee break. She's determined to leave a paw print on the hearts of all the pets she meets and maybe, just maybe, learn how to make the perfect latte along the way.\n\nTeresa has been playing tag with the veterinary field since she was 16, ducking in and out but always getting caught by her love for animals. She's the proud human of a Vizsla named Bo and a Frenchie named Olivia, who are the reigning champions of the \"Best Couch Potatoes\" in her household. When not at work, she can be found forming a small, cozy mountain of laziness with her furry companions, a good book in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other—because, for Teresa, coffee is not just a beverage; it's a lifestyle choice that mirrors her passion for her job as a veterinary technician.\n\nRhyen was born and raised here in Arizona.
