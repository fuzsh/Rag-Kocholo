        "text": "Friday! Friday!\n\nThe Young and The Restless sure had some plot twists involving the infamous Neil/Dru/Olivia/Malcolm days!\n\nBut wait……remember, Dru and Olivia’s aunt is the legendary Mamie (yes, Mamie…the Jabot’s housekeeper of course! LOL)\n\nMamie Johnson is a fictional character on the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The role was originated in 1980 by Marguerite Ray, who was replaced in 1990 by Veronica Redd. Redd departed the series in 1995, and returned from 1999 to 2004. Mamie was the series’ first regular African American character.\n\nJabot Cosmetics founder, John Abbott, was left alone to raise his three adolescent children when his wife Dina Mergeron left him. The Abbott children were mostly raised by long-time family maid, Mamie Johnson, whom they thought of as their mother.\n\nMamie was at John’s side after his heart attack, which was caused by Jack almost selling Jabot out from under him. When John married Jill Foster, Mamie disapproved. She kept a sharp eye on Jill, was suspicious when Jill mysteriously “fell” from a ladder and miscarried, and kept John up to date on her. Mamie nursed John back to health from the stroke caused when John discovered Jill had a one-night stand with his son, Jack, so the baby could have been his. Then she stood by his side during his divorce and the crushing settlement which gave Jill one-fourth of Jabot Cosmetics, a seat on the board of directors, and a cushy executive position with Jabot at $150,000 a year.\n\nMamie’s niece, Drucilla Barber, a teen runaway who had been missing for years, showed up desperately looking for her aunt at the Abbotts’ door. Mamie talked John into letting Dru live with her in the servants’ quarters. John took a liking to Dru, and got her a job in the Jabot mailroom. Mamie was there as a sounding board and problem solver for Dru over the years, and Dru ended up a successful fashion model. The same was true for niece Olivia Barber, who was a doctor at Genoa City Memorial, and Olivia’s son Nate and Dru’s daughter Lily.\n\nNow about Drucilla (Dru):\n\nDru is illiterate, but is taught to read by private detective Nathan Hastings (who was once also illiterate). Nathan later marries and fathers a child by Dru’s successful physician sister Olivia. Drucilla and Olivia originally have a relationship fraught with tension and anger, due to mother Lillie Belle’s favoritism of Olivia over Drucilla, but the two eventually reconcile in a very emotional manner and have more or less been best friends ever since.\n\nDru eventually marries Neil Winters, but only after many trials and mistakes. One such misstep, is posing nude for Sensuality magazine, though Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) discovers and destroys the film. Over time, Dru eventually evolves into a glamorous model. In June 1993, after marrying Neil, Drucilla finally receives closure by telling off her mother for wanting to abort her and not showing love for her as a child. Dru becomes close with Neil’s brother Malcolm Winters, who develops a crush on her. While she is under the influence of cold medication, the two engage in sex. When she ends up pregnant they decide not to uncover the child’s paternity and keep their affair a secret. Dru gives birth to her daughter, Lily, in 1995. Dru’s marriage to Neil ultimately collapses because her desire for a career clashes with his desire for a wife who stayed home. Dru develops very close friendships with people in town, including Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), and Jack and Ashley Abbott (Peter Bergman and Eileen Davidson). She develops an adversarial relationship with Phyllis Romalotti (Michelle Stafford), which only intensifies as the years go on.\n\nAbout Olivia:\n\nLillie Belle and Walter Barber had two daughters who were as different as night and day, and bitter rivals. Older sister Olivia could do no wrong. Younger sister Drucilla could do no right. Their mother, Lillie Belle, admitted many years later that Dru was an unwanted child, the result of husband Walter’s drunken lust. It was no wonder that Dru ran away as a teenager and spent years on the streets racking up a criminal record. Olivia was shocked by this revelation, needless to say and saw Dru in a new light for the first time in years. Walter assured Olivia that even though Dru’s conception was not planned, he loved her regardless and had no regrets over having her. Olivia was relieved and grateful to hear this, but was furious with Lillie Belle for mistreating Dru all those years.\n\nNathan Hastings, detective with the Paul Williams Detective Agency, caught a shoplifter while working security for Fenmore’s Department Store, the same Drucilla Barber. Nathan ended up talking the judge into releasing Dru into his custody and took her in once he realized another thing they shared, as Nathan was once illiterate too. Nathan taught Dru to read and be more ladylike, and eventually Dru fell in love with him. But lo and behold, Nathan’s girlfriend was Olivia, Drucilla’s “perfect” sister. The sisters were reunited, but it was obvious no love was lost between them. Nathan explained that his heart was with Olivia. Dru plotted to win him away by seducing him, but that didn’t work. Olivia informed their parents of Dru’s presence in Genoa City. They came to see Dru, but were rebuffed, so returned home.\n\nPushed by Olivia to produce her mystery “boyfriend”, Drucilla talked Jabot executive trainee and Stanford MBA graduate, Neil Winters, into playing the part. Neil ended up falling in love with Olivia himself. Olivia decided that Dru was setting them up, so moved up her wedding date. This was the year of the grand masquerade ball. Olivia had to work, so Nathan dressed as an Arabian and took Dru dressed as “The Firebird” ballerina. Nathan and Olivia married with Dru as reluctant maid of honor. Dru and Neil commiserated, and ended up falling in love. It was obvious both couples were mismatched. The scholarly Olivia was married to the former criminal Nathan, and the former criminal Dru with the well-educated Neil Winters. Neil supported Dru in her rise to ballerina stardom. But she turned down a chance to tour with the ballet for a modeling career. Neil thought it unforgivable, to be giving up art for self-gratification and big money, so they broke up.\n\nA pregnant Olivia was found to have ovarian cancer, but refused to abort the baby to save her life. After the birth, Olivia was to have a hysterectomy, but it and the cancer subject was dropped. Their son, Nathan Hastings, Jr., was delivered early to save Olivia’s life.\n\nNathan began an affair with the beautiful Keesha Monroe. Olivia became suspicious, and both Dru and Neil tried to caution Nathan after they caught him with Keesha. Each time Nathan tried to end the affair, Olivia did something to drive Nathan back to Keesha’s arms. Nathan finally ended the affair, and he and Liv began trying for another child. Just as Keesha was falling in love with Malcolm, he found out about the affair with Nathan and dumped her. Then Keesha began getting persistent calls from old boyfriend Stan, who later died of AIDS. Keesha went to Dr. Liv, turned out to be HIV positive, and had to tell Nathan. It was about this time that Dru decided to tell Olivia about Nathan’s affair with Keesha. Liv was furious, not only that Nathan had betrayed her, but had also endangered her and Nate with HIV. She kicked Nathan out and forbade him to ever see their son again. All 3 of them were HIV negative, but Keesha was doomed now with AIDS. The compassionate Malcolm began seeing her again, helping her through the difficult times as she grew weaker and thinner, and would have otherwise been left all alone to die. Malcolm cared for her so, he brought her flowers and a veil and married her on her death bed so she could at least die happy. Nathan became desperate to see his son, and ended up kidnapping him. Life on the run was rough on Nate, so Nathan finally did the right thing, and was returning Nate to Olivia when he was struck by a car and killed.\n\nAbout Neil:\n\nIn 1991, rising Jabot Cosmetics executive trainee Neil Winters becomes involved in a love quadrangle with Drucilla Barber (Victoria Rowell), Olivia Barber (Tonya Lee Williams), and Nathan Hastings (Nathan Purdee). Olivia and Nathan are engaged but Olivia’s sister Dru wants Nathan for herself. She has Neil attempt to woo Olivia away from Nathan. While doing so, he falls in love with Olivia. Neil and Dru’s attempt to break up the couple is unsuccessful. Neil and Dru fall for one another and become romantically involved. They are married in a private ceremony at Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)’s estate in March 1993.[6]\n\nNeil’s half-brother Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) comes to town in 1994. There is animosity between Malcolm and Neil (now an executive at Newman Enterprises), but Malcolm befriends Dru and soon falls in love with her. While she is over-medicated on cold medicine, they have sex and Dru becomes pregnant. She does not know if Neil or Malcolm is the father. They decide to keep their affair a secret and to allow Neil to raise the baby whether he is the father or not.\n\nNeil and Dru’s daughter, Lily Winters, is born in 1995. Dru’s career as a fashion model caused problems in her marriage to Neil. He wanted her to be a stay at home mom. These problems eventually led to a divorce. Dru and Lily leave Genoa City and Neil for Paris. After Victoria Newman (Heather Tom) becomes pregnant with the baby of Cole Howard, her former husband, she and Neil bond and decide to raise the child together. They plan to marry. Victoria goes into an early labor and gives birth to a premature baby, Eve, who dies shortly after birth. After this they decide to end their engagement. Subsequently, Neil has a relationship with Dru’s sister Olivia, and comes very close to having an affair with Malcolm’s fiancée Alex Perez (Alexia Robinson).\n\nAfter the murder of his best friend, Ryan McNeil (Scott Reeves), and the apparent death of his brother, Malcolm, Neil also battles alcoholism. Neil eventually manages to get his illness under control, but almost loses his family and career.\n\nIn the show’s historic 11,000 episode, Nichelle Nichols guest starred as Neil’s estranged mother\n\nAbout Malcolm:\n\nMalcolm first arrives in Genoa City in 1994, determined to get to know his estranged half-brother, Neil Winters. Neil, at first, wanted nothing to do with his rebellious younger half-brother, but eventually decided to give him a second chance. With the help of Blade Bladeson, Malcolm became Genoa City’s most prominent photographer.\n\nHe soon met Drucilla Barber, and was instantly smitten with her, but nothing becomes of the relationship and she married Neil. Malcolm and Drucilla longed for one another and had sex. However, Drucilla had taken a good dose of cold medication, and thus mistook Malcolm for Neil. Drucilla called out for Neil, which made Malcolm realize her advances were not intended for him. The following morning Malcolm realized what a mistake he had made and confides in Dru’s sister, Olivia Barber.\n\nNine months later, Drucilla gave birth to a daughter, Lily Winters. Having convinced herself that Neil is Lily’s father, Dru forgave Malcolm and Olivia soon fixed him up with her hospital colleague, Keesha Monroe. They fell in love and married, just before Keesha died of AIDS.\n\nMalcolm then developed a relationship with recently widowed Olivia and grew very attached to her son Nathan Hastings, Jr. Malcolm and Olivia were married in 1997. One year later, Malcolm’s ex-girlfriend Callie Rogers arrived in town and Olivia became jealous that Malcolm was spending so much time with her. Olivia’s insecurity ultimately destroyed her marriage to Malcolm and he rebounded back to Callie. The two became engaged but Callie soon broke it off and left town. In the meantime, Malcolm continued his close relationship with his former stepson Nate, who views Malcolm as his father.\n\nMalcolm and Neil soon found themselves fighting over a woman, attorney Alex Perez. Malcolm and Alex fell in love and become engaged, though she was also developing feelings for Neil. Malcolm catches them together and left. While Malcolm driving over a bridge in Kenya, the bridge collapses and Malcolm is presumed dead."
