        "text": "Malcolm is back on The Young and the Restless\n\nIf you watched the Andy Griffith Show or Gomer Pyle you will recall that Jim Neighbors character Gimer had a phrase \"Surprise, surprise,surprise\" that he often said. This is the attitude fans of The Young and the Restless shoudl have as the number 1 daytime drama series continues to bring past characters back to Genoa City. The latest is fan favorite Shemar Moore who portrayed Malcolm Winters.\n\nMoore is best known for his role in Criminal Minds and for hosting Soul Train from 1999-2003. He has won eight NAACP Image Awards and also the 2000 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his character on The Young and the Restless. According to PEOPLE, the actor will return as Winters on May 8 as one of a number of the former cast who have been returning to Y&R in honor of the observance of the 50-year anniversary.\n\nThe Young and the Restless turned 50 on March 26 but the celebration actually began in 2022. As anticipation for this 5-decade milestone grew the CBS soap began bringing back former residents of Genoa City. Two who have stuck around are father and son Danny Romalatti (Michael Damian) and Daniel Romolatti (Michael Grazeadei). In the midst of the festivities, there has been some backstage upheaval where co-executive producer Anthony Morina was fired in December and Josh Griffith who is now sole EP and head writer fired his entire breakdown team in February.\n\nMalcolm's history in Genoa City\n\nLast week The Young and the Restless held a bicentennial gala for Genoa City residents so when Malcolm returns the big bash will be over but he will be able to reconnect with his family which is complicated at best. Malcolm's biological daughter is Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) because he slept with Drucilla Winters ( Victoria Rowell) when she was out of it on cold medication. Malcolm wrongly assumed his brother Neil Winters's (Kristoff St. John) wife wanted to be with him but he was wrong. Drucillia said she thought she was making love to her her husband and that the medication made her loopy.\n\nNeil raised Lily as his own and later he and Drucilla adopted Devon Hamilton (Brytn James) which makes him Malcolm's nephew. Malcolm was married to Drucilla's sister Olivia Barber Hastings (Tonya Williams) who has a son Nate Hastings Jr.(Sean Dominic) with Nate Hastings Sr. ( Randy Brookes and Nathan Purdue). Nate is first cousin to Lily and Devon but has no blood relationship with Malcolm although some soap spoilers say they are uncle and nephew they are actually stepfather and stepson.\n\nWhat will Malcolm be up to in Genoa City\n\nMalcolm Winters was last seen on The Young and the Restless during a special tribute to St. John who passes away on February 3, 2019. There is no news yet regarding how many episodes Shemar will be in or what storyline he will be involved with. Lily and devon are attempting to patch up their broken relationship and are even tolerating Nate who betrayed them. In addition to Moore, Grazeadei, and Damian's characters other former Genoa City residents who have returned have included : Leanne Love (Barbara Crampton), Nina Webster (Trisha Cast), Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) Mamie Johnson (Veronica Red) Lucy Romalotti (Lily Brooks O'Briant) and Heather Stevens (Vail Bloom)."
