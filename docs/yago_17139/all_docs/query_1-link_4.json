Later, when Olivia finds out about Nathan’s affair with Keesha, a woman with AIDS, Nathan kidnaps Nate and disappears. After several weeks on the run, Nathan decides to return Little Nate to Olivia. But when he wanders away from his father on a crowded street, Nathan rushes to find him and is fatally struck by a car. After Nathan’s death, Olivia becomes close to Malcolm, who also has a soft spot for Nate. Malcolm proposes marriage and the possibility of adopting Nate, who considers Malcolm to be his father, even though the boy is old enough to remember Nathan. Olivia and Malcolm eventually divorce, yet Malcolm remains a staple in Nate’s life until Malcolm’s presumed death in Africa. In 2008, Olivia mentioned that Nate was currently attending Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAfter a nine year hiatus, the character returned on screen on February 7, 2011.\n\nAww crap…by the time Id ‘copied and pasted’…you already knew.rotfl\n\nQuote clicquot1:\n\nQuote valencia4love:\n\nQuote soapsrfun: Please confirm for me who Nate's father is.

He and his brother were both in love with Paul’s first secretary, Amy Lewis. She was the daughter of Frank Lewis, the Captain of the Genoa City Police Department. Kong left the mob and went to work for Paul and no longer used the nickname. That was a great storyline.\n\nI loved the early scenes with Drucilla and Nathan. They first met with he was working undercover at Fenmore’s. Drucilla was a pick-pocket and Nathan caught her red-handed. She was going to be sent to juvenile detention but Nathan struck a deal and offered to take her home help her to straighten out her life. By the time Drucilla was secretly falling in love with Nathan, he and Olivia were planning to get married. That was another great story.\n\nSeveral years later, Little Nate, loved his father and was devastated when his parents split. Mamie just thought it was wrong that Olivia kept Nate from his seeing his father. So, on the days she had Nate for the day, she set it up so Nathan could ‘just so happen’ to drop by and spend time with his son. When Olivia discovered what Mamie did, she put a stop to it.\n\nNathan became desperate and kidnap his son, unbeknownst to Nate what was going on. They were on the run for awhile. Nathan noticed how depressed Nate was becoming from not seeing his mother and decided to return him home.\n\nWhen they finally reached the block of the apartment. Across the street, Nathan noticed a street vendor who was selling flowers. He told Nate to hold on, while he ran back to grab some flowers to give to Olivia. By that time, Nate saw Olivia standing outside by the apartment building. He ran to his mother, Nathan ran after him because he was afraid he would get hurt crossing the street. As Nathan ran across the street, he was hit by the car and later died from the injuries.\n\nNate never forgot his father and missed him a great deal. He was happy to have a male figure in his life when his mother became serious with Malcolm. Then when Malcolm disappeared in an accident at the photo shoot in Kenya. Nate was devastated and became despondent. For awhile, Brad was around to comfort him. Eventually, Olivia sent Nate to boarding school in England."
