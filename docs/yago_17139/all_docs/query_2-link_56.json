I rather like the feeling\n\nOf watching folks getting hurt deep, fall apart & reap\n\na micro quick healing. lol!\n\nDrama. Drama.\n\nIt is for your moma,\n\nto which I will say: ‚ÄúHello‚Äù.\n\nI dig it all.\n\nThe deep the small\n\nand lately digging the Beautifully Bold. üòâ\n\nAll My Children used to be gold ‚Äì but that‚Äôs all gone away.\n\nI lie to you not, I like the lil‚Äô snots on Y&R everyday.\n\nThere are a few characters on Y&R that I am requesting get into scene,\n\nincluding but not limited to Drewcilla Winters and the fine Dr. Hastings.\n\nLil‚Äô Nate. Olivia‚Äôs boy. Yes he‚Äôs back and employed at the local hospital. He‚Äôs a doc.;)\n\nHe‚Äôs intellectual, he‚Äôs strong ‚Äì he‚Äôs another single jones & his physique is a la HOT!\n\nCan he get another camera shot? lol!\n\nTucker McCall‚Äôs health is recovering well, but at a much slower rate,\n\nthan it would be if there were a script feed to the helpful Dr. Nate.\n\nWon‚Äôt Sophia need a Dr. soon? I don‚Äôt know if Nate OB/GYN‚Äôs,\n\nbut you‚Äôd agree, he‚Äôs an interesting he and he sports a winning grin.\n\nMrs. Bell ‚Äî please write Dr. Nate in. üôÇ\n\nNow that Diane Jenkins is dead, Jack and Victor will fight over the boy.\n\nWhile Lily and Daniel lay in red sheets, post making ‚Äòfriends with benefits‚Äô joy.\n\nCorrection.\n\nThe two of them just professed their affections."
