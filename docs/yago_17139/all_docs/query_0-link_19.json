        "text": "She’s presumed dead, but fans of The Young and the Restless will never forget feisty Drucilla Barber Winters, who loved her family with all her heart! Emmy-nominee Victoria Rowell played the part of Dru and left a lasting impression that continues to this day.\n\nMy Sister, My Rival\n\nAn attitude-challenged Dru came to town and reconnected with her aunt, Mamie, who was working for the Abbott clan. But one person was able to have a good influence on the hellion. She met Nathan Hastings, who tenderly taught Dru how to read and she fell for him hard. Sadly for Dru, he was in love with her sister Olivia.\n\nWinters of Her Content\n\nWorking at Jabot, Dru met and fell in love with rising executive Neil Winters. Their chemistry from day one was instant and combustible. Dru challenged Neil with her impulsiveness, but their connection couldn’t be denied. Soon the two fell in love, got engaged, and later wed in Katherine Chancellor’s living room.\n\nFamily Drama\n\nDru let loose at a family gathering, blasting her mother, Lillie Belle, for always favoring Olivia over her (getting to the crux of Dru’s insecurity that had tarnished her relationship with her sister). Snarling at her mother, Dru informed her neglectful parent: “I survived you!”\n\nOut Cold\n\nFighting the flu, Dru was zonked out on some cold medicine. Her brother-in-law Malcolm came to visit her and Dru, feeling the effects of the medicine, thought that Malcolm was Neil — and in a shocking move, the two engaged in sex. Soon after, Dru was pregnant with her daughter Lily!\n\nDisconnected\n\nWhile fighting over a cell phone with pal Sharon and nemesis Phyllis, Dru and Sharon fell over a cliff, presumably to their deaths. Sharon survived. Dru’s body was never found.\n\nWith Neil now gone, perhaps Dru and her true love are reunited in the hereafter. Unless, of course, Dru’s alive and one day comes back to Genoa City to reunite with her daughter Lily (named after her mom) and son Devon. The Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS. Check local listings for air times.\n\nVideo Credit:Adex"
