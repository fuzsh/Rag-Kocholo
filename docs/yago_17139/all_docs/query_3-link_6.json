        "text": "I posted a few years ago a plot idea that would have Neil see a newsclip on TV and in the crowd, Dru - or someone who resembles her strongly. He can’t stop thinking about it. Is Dru still alive? From a fall like that she could have amnesia. She was rescued and did not remember who she is. Eventually, she built a new life for herself, married, and has a family. But Neil can’t stop thinking about it. He doesn’t tell anyone. He says he needs to get away on an Eat, Pray, Love type thing and goes in search of Dru. This takes a while, because she was only visiting in the town where the news clip was shot. He finds the hotel she and her family were staying at, and find someone remembers her. But their computer crashed so they don’t have any names. They think she was from somewhere in Europe. France maybe. Neil goes and wanders around. He looks up old newspaper clippings seeing if he can find any wedding announcements or birth notices with photos of the bride/mom. Finally, he is in Paris, and sees a woman who from the back could be Dru. He follows her to a cafe. It’s her. He keeps his distance, trying to decide what to do.\n\nAnother idea I read was that Malcolm was keeping Dru somewhere as she is in a coma and he didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up for her recovery. Maybe she did recover and believed that Malcolm was her true love…\n\nSo many other possibilities and yes a recast if they can’t come to terms with the original actress. There are so many newer viewers now.\n\nBy the way, where is Olivia? and didn’t she have a son???"
