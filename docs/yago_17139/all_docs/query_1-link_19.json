The role was originated in 1984 by Nathan Purdee, who portrayed the character until 1992. The character was subsequently de-aged on two separate occasions, as evidenced by later portrayals by Randy Brooks (1992-1993) and Adam Lazarre-White (1994-1996, 2000), who are both clearly younger than Purdee.\n\nFictional character biography\n\nIn 1984, attorney Tyrone Jackson (Phil Morris), along with his brother Jazz Jackson (Jon St. Elwood) and private investigator Andy Richards (Steven Ford), gather enough evidence to dismantle the local organized crime family, headed by Joseph Anthony (Logan Ramsey). They receive invaluable assistance from one of Anthony's men: \"Kong\", whose real name is Nathan Hastings. As a result, Nathan is granted immunity for his crimes. After secretary Amy Lewis (Stephanie Williams) realizes that Nathan is illiterate, she secretly teaches him to read and write. The two soon start dating, but she eventually leaves town.\n\nHaving completely reformed, Nathan becomes a private investigator himself and joins Paul Williams' (Doug Davidson) detective agency. While working security for Fenmore's Department Store, he catches a shoplifter -- a runaway named Drucilla Barber (Victoria Rowell). Once Nathan realizes that Drucilla is illiterate (as he once was), he convinces the court to release her into his custody. Nathan teaches Dru how to read. She soon falls in love with Nathan, and is determined to steal him away from his girlfriend. Coincidentally, the girlfriend turns out to be Dru's estranged sister, a physician named Olivia Barber (Tonya Lee Williams). Dru's attempts to seduce Nathan away from Olivia prove to be unsuccessful, and she later turns her attention to her future husband, Jabot Cosmetics executive trainee Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). Nathan and Olivia are eventually married, and have a son, Nathan Hastings, Jr. (or \"Nate\" for short). The birth poses a great risk to Olivia's life, as she has developed ovarian cancer. Following the birth, she has a hysterectomy.\n\nNathan and Olivia experience serious marital problems on two occasions. First, Olivia becomes infatuated with Neil (at a time when he and Dru are having difficulties). Later, Olivia's parents Walter and Lillie Belle Barber separate, and Lillie Belle comes to live with the couple. Lillie Belle is clinically depressed, and Nathan and Olivia argue about her strange behavior. The conflict continues even after Lillie Belle and Walter reunite. Eventually, Nathan begins an extramarital affair with Keesha Monroe, although he does not tell Keesha that he is married until later in the relationship. Soon Keesha meets Neil's half-brother, photographer Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore). After much effort, Malcolm manages to woo her away from her boyfriend, whom he is unaware was Nathan. When Malcolm learns of Keesha's affair with Nathan, he breaks up with her, even though she has already stopped seeing Nathan. However Malcolm keeps the affair a secret from Olivia, as do Neil and Dru, who also learn of Nathan's infidelity."
