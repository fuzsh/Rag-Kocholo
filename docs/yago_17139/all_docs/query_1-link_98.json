        "text": "The Young and The Restless spoilers and updates tease Jordan (Colleen Zenk) may not be Eve Howard’s (Margaret Mason) sister-Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck) doesn’t know anything about her!\n\n“Great Aunt Jordan” may be an imposter who raised Claire Grace (Hayley Erin) or possibly kidnapped her from the hospital and fabricated her death!\n\nThe Young And The Restless Spoilers: Victoria Newman’s Appendicitis\n\nCole and Victoria Newman (then Heather Tom) were having problems and separated, he was with Ashley Abbott (then Sherri Shattuck) and her with Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John).\n\nVictoria had gotten pregnant on purpose, trying to hang onto Cole, and several months into the pregnancy was hospitalized with a severe infection; this went on for a couple of days.\n\nIt was determined that her appendix had burst and her baby had to be delivered by emergency c-section so the appendix could be removed.\n\nHer medical team was Olivia Winters (Tonya Williams) who is Nate Hastings’ (Sean Dominic) mother, and a Dr. Ken Cromwell (Joel Stoffer) an obstetrician; and a nurse who was never named.\n\nCole and Neil both were in the hospital while Victoria and the newborn baby girl was in the neonatal unit.\n\nY&R Spoilers: Victoria Newman Carried To The Neonatal Unit\n\nVictoria finally saw her newborn in the neonatal unit when Cole carried her into the room with the incubator, against the nurse’s and Dr. Cromwell’s orders.\n\nNeil and Cole as well as Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) were in Memorial Hospital supporting Victoria, but it was Cole who made it possible to see the baby.\n\nThey named her Eve Nicole after their mothers, as Neil spoke to Olivia, who was worried the baby wouldn’t make it, and then Cole carried Victoria back to her room.\n\nThen Dr. Cromwell came in, along with this mysterious unnamed nurse, and wanted to talk to Cole alone and said the baby died-but her death wasn’t shown onscreen per recaps.\n\nThis all happened in November, 1998 including a memorial service for Eve Nicole in the hospital chapel-again, no mention of the baby being seen deceased by the family there either.\n\nThe Young And The Restless Spoilers: Fast Forward To 2023\n\nFast forward to 2023, and Cole is lured to the house where Nikki has been kidnapped by Claire and Jordan knocks him out with a hammer!\n\nHe had been texted from Nikki’s phone by either Claire or Jordan and told Victoria (now Amelia Heinle) was in trouble there and he has no idea who Jordan is.\n\nSoon, the “family reunion” is complete minus Nikki, who’s still on a vodka IV upstairs, and Cole sees Victoria, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow).\n\nJordan introduces herself as Eve’s sister and Claire as Cole and Victoria’s baby, Eve Nicole! Cole doesn’t know of an aunt and Victor didn’t know of Eve having a sister-could she really be the nurse, working with Cromwell years ago to falsify Eve Nicole’s death?"
