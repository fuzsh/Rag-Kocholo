        "text": "Here’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.
