C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, yet it’s difficult to find well-taught online courses for it, let alone for complete newbies to programming. The problem lies not in the quantity of courses, but the quality.

That’s why this Best Courses Guide (BCG) exists. We understand that you’re not interested in courses that put profits and views over educational quality. Therefore, we’ve curated a selection of the best courses for you — whether you have never written a single line of code, or are currently studying programming at a bootcamp or university, or even if you code professionally on a daily basis. And it also happens that most of these courses are free to take, though there are also paid courses that are worth the money.

The motivations for learning C++ can vary greatly. Maybe you’re interested in the low-level side of C++? Or perhaps you want to develop a game, or some piece of software? Rest assured, we’ve taken these diverse learning objectives into account, and there’ll be at least one course in this BCG that’s just right for you.

What is C++?

Invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983, C++ is an intermediate-level general-purpose programming language used to create large-scale applications, like operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. It acts as an extension or a superset of the C programming language (which I have written a BCG about).

What makes C++ extremely popular is that it is not only fast, efficient, flexible, and provides direct control over hardware like its older brother C, but it also improves on C in several aspects. For example, it was created for object-oriented programming, and provides exception handling and function overloading, which were not available in C. In addition, every three years, the C++ language is revised to support ground-breaking new features, which get the language on par with C# and Java, but without the performance penalty of a garbage collector.

C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world, and the data proves it. It’s community is the fourth largest, boasting 13.3M developers according to SlashData’s State of The Developer Nation. Meanwhile, C++ sits at third place in popularity as of the TIOBE Index, while GitHub’s 2022 State of the Octoverse ranks C++ as the sixth most prevalent language used across its 372M repositories.

Why Learn C++?

If you need high performance and low-level control over system resources for applications, C++ is an excellent choice. You can find thousands of entries of C++ frameworks, libraries, and applications in this Awesome List and C++ wiki, but to keep things short:

Game Development: Unreal Engine, one of the most popular game development platforms, requires developers to code in C++ to create hit games like Fortnite and Street Fighter V.

Graphical Applications: High-performance client applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, are built with C++ for their intensive graphical operations. The massively-popular Qt framework, used to build cross-platform GUI applications, treats C++ as a first-class citizen.

Operating Systems: Microsoft’s Windows OS has core components written in C++, and Apple’s macOS incorporates C++ in its I/O Kit for low-level system components. Similarly, parts of the Linux kernel and various system utilities are implemented using C++.

Embedded Systems / Microcontroller: C++ is used in embedded system software for devices like smartwatches, medical machines, and IoT devices because of its efficiency and control over hardware. The most popular open hardware development board, Arduiono, uses C++.

3D Graphics: C++ is used in 3D graphics for games and simulations with many available graphics API libraries like OpenGL, as well as in professional graphics software like AutoCAD.

C++ developers are well-rewarded for their expertise. The StackOverflow 2023 Developer Survey cites a global median salary of $75K for C++ developers, with those in the United States earning a median of $130K, as per Glassdoor’s 2023 data.
