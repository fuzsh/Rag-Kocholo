        "text": "Hello, Tianyu Sun-MSFT.\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for the comment. Can you please clarify the following point:\n\nFor example, if your Node.js application depends on npm native modules like sqllite3, bufferutil, etc., in order to successfully install these npm packages on Windows, you will need to use Visual Studio Build Tools. Previously, if the application you were developing was not OSS, installing VSBT was permitted only if you had a valid Visual Studio license (e.g., Visual Studio Community or higher). With this new license option, if you do not need the full functionality of Visual Studio for your active development of your project, you have the flexibility to install Visual Studio Build Tools for free.\n\nIt says here that with the new license terms, if you do not require the full functionality of Visual Studio, you have the opportunity to install Visual Studio Build Tools for free.\n\nWe do not need the full functionality of Visual Studio to develop applications. But at the same time, there is a point: \"As noted above, if you and your team need to compile and develop proprietary C++ code with Visual Studio, a Visual Studio license will still be required.\"\n\nThus, please clarify whether we can still use Visual Studio Build Tools for free in case we only need it to use the Python library and not to use the full functionality of Visual Studio, or even in this case we need to purchase a paid Visual Studio license\n\nThank you"
