        "text": "Reported from InfoWorld\n\nUS President Joe Biden’s administration wants software developers to use memory-safe programming languages and ditch vulnerable ones like C and C++.\n\nThe White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), in a report released Monday, called on developers to reduce the risk of cyberattacks by using programming languages that don’t have memory safety vulnerabilities. Technology companies “can prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities from entering the digital ecosystem” by adopting memory-safe programming languages, the White House said in a news release.\n\nMemory-safe programming languages are protected from software bugs and vulnerabilities related to memory access, including buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, and memory leaks. Recent studies from Microsoft and Google have found that about 70 percent of all security vulnerabilities are caused by memory safety issues.\n\nThe new 19-page report from ONCD gave C and C++ as two examples of programming languages with memory safety vulnerabilities, and it named Rust as an example of a programming language it considers safe. In addition, an NSA cybersecurity information sheet from November 2022 listed C#, Go, Java, Ruby, and Swift, in addition to Rust, as programming languages it considers to be memory-safe.\n\nDirect link to the White House report\n\nI imagine this could slow down vst development and synth tinkering if enforced legally. I recall Elektron was looking for a Rust engineer a while back.\n\nNothing stops you writing unsafe Rust, it offers memory safety but a developer can opt not to use it in that way.\n\nWhile very unlikely, it could potentially be enforced for new developments for government funded work, but would be impossible to enforce broader than that.\n\n100%. Same for C#\n\nHow do you reckon they’d go about enforcing this legally? Lol\n\nOh no so scary malloc() !\n\nMeanwhile US Department of Defense has mainframes still running Fortran for nuclear missile guidance.\n\nthis is honestly such an embarrassment. they really thought they were doing something with this one.\n\nI think it’s funny to see the Biden administration communicate this to the tech community, but at least it’s well intended: the idea that it would almost eradicate a whole class of CVEs is nice, although slightly flawed. Yeah, no more stack-smashing, but you can have very unsafe code in memory-safe languages.\n\nAlso, good luck porting all the existing C/C++ codebases in the world to go and rust!\n\nWhat’s their guidance on Emacs vs vim?\n\nLol\n\nI use GameMaker Language…\n\nEnforce a request?\n\nThe Biden administration strikes me as an Emacs shop. That’s just the vibe I get from people’s faces and stuff\n\ntime to learn and spent cash on stupid code. beat me to it.\n\nI doubt this would be enforced legally in the US, but who knows.\n\nAs for audio product development, I believe that Elektron is more and more relying on Rust for their products. That is one reason I am teaching myself the language, that other that is that I find it to be fun, albeit challenging. One way I am learning it is by making simple VST plugins with it. There are also many audio and plugins projects out there, so it is absolutely possible to develop stuff with it, and if I, who only has experience with the language the NSA recommends, and hardly any experience with C/C++, and no experience making audio applications or with DSP, can make a plugin in Rust, then I seriously doubt that it would slow down VST and synth development to damaging side effects.\n\nEveryone should use Nano, obviously.\n\nNo programming language is safe from human error. Bugs are simply part of the game and will always be, memory-safe or not. Good luck as well with ChatGPT as a programming assistant\n\nMuahaha!\n\nPOTUS + EMACS sounds better than POTUS + VIM. There is also POMACS, EMUS, VIMUS, POTIM, POTEM, VIMACUS, and I’ll throw in NANOPOT.\n\nI was arrested for C++'ing today, but I broke out of jail with old “hiding in the laundry bin” maneuver.\n\nI’m on the lam now, so let’s party.\n\nFree books i take that back.\n\nCan you give me pointers?"
