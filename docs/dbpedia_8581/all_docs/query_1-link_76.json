There are no restrictions on what can be included except that the source of the library must be readily available to download.\n\nThe page is provided “as is” - with the hope of being useful, but without any warranties. Outdated, misleading or wrong links might appear here. If you’ve noticed one of these, it would be great if you fixed the error."
