        "text": "This tutorial shows how to prepare your local machine for C++ development, including developing C++ apps that run on Google Cloud.\n\nIf you already have a development environment set up, see C++ and Google Cloud to get an overview of how to run C++ apps on Google Cloud.\n\nObjectives\n\nInstall a supported version of C++ compatible with Google Cloud.\n\nInstall a C++ build system.\n\nInstall an editor (optional).\n\nInstall the Google Cloud CLI (optional).\n\nInstall the Cloud Client Libraries for C++ (optional).\n\nSet up authentication.\n\nInstalling C++\n\nC++'s installation instructions vary by operating system. Follow the guide for the operating system you're running in your development environment, macOS, Windows, or Linux.\n\nInstall a C++ Build System compatible with Google Cloud\n\nTo use C++ effectively you will want a build system and package manager that supports the Cloud Client Libraries for C++. The client libraries support multiple such build systems and package managers.\n\nInstall an editor\n\nThere are many editors and IDEs with C++ support. Pick one that fits your needs. Consider these features as you make your selection:\n\nFully integrated debugging capabilities\n\nSyntax highlighting\n\nCode completion\n\nInstall the Google Cloud CLI\n\nThe Google Cloud CLI is a set of tools for Google Cloud. It contains the gcloud and bq command-line tools used to access Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and other services from the command line. You can run these tools interactively or in your automated scripts.\n\nInstall the Cloud Client Libraries for C++\n\nThe Cloud Client Libraries for C++ is the idiomatic way for C++ developers to integrate with Google Cloud services, such as Spanner and Cloud Storage.\n\nFor example, to install the package for an individual API, such as the Cloud Storage API, do the following:\n\nSet up authentication\n\nTo use the Cloud Client Libraries in a local development environment, set up Application Default Credentials.\n\nCreate local authentication credentials for your user account:\n\ngcloud auth application-default login\n\nFor more information, see Authenticate for using client libraries.\n\nWhat's next"
