        "text": "C++ is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, yet it’s difficult to find well-taught online courses for it, let alone for complete newbies to programming. The problem lies not in the quantity of courses, but the quality.\n\nThat’s why this Best Courses Guide (BCG) exists. We understand that you’re not interested in courses that put profits and views over educational quality. Therefore, we’ve curated a selection of the best courses for you — whether you have never written a single line of code, or are currently studying programming at a bootcamp or university, or even if you code professionally on a daily basis. And it also happens that most of these courses are free to take, though there are also paid courses that are worth the money.\n\nThe motivations for learning C++ can vary greatly. Maybe you’re interested in the low-level side of C++? Or perhaps you want to develop a game, or some piece of software? Rest assured, we’ve taken these diverse learning objectives into account, and there’ll be at least one course in this BCG that’s just right for you.\n\nClick on the shortcuts for more details:\n\nTop Picks\n\nWhat is C++?\n\nWhy Learn C++?\n\nStats\n\nNotable C++ YouTubers to Follow\n\nAdditional C++ Resources\n\nBCG Methodology\n\nHere are my top picks. Click on one to skip to the course details:\n\nCourse Highlight Workload Best Free All-Rounder Resource (LearnCpp.com) N/A Best Free Zero to Hero Course (Daniel Gakwaya) 31 hours Best Free YouTube Course for Beginners (The Cherno) 24 hours Best Paid Game Development Course for Absolute Beginners (GameDev.tv) 11 hours Best Free Course for Game Programming (Memorial University) 28 hours Best Paid Course for Absolute Beginners (Frank Mitropoulos) 46 hours Best Free Text Course for Absolute Beginners (Codio) 10–15 hours Best Paid Course for Professionals (Kate Gregory) 7–8 hours Best Specialization for C++ and Data Structures (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) >65 hours Best Free University Course for Computer Vision and Image Processing (University of Bonn) 13–14 hours\n\nWhat is C++?\n\nInvented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983, C++ is an intermediate-level general-purpose programming language used to create large-scale applications, like operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. It acts as an extension or a superset of the C programming language (which I have written a BCG about).\n\nWhat makes C++ extremely popular is that it is not only fast, efficient, flexible, and provides direct control over hardware like its older brother C, but it also improves on C in several aspects. For example, it was created for object-oriented programming, and provides exception handling and function overloading, which were not available in C. In addition, every three years, the C++ language is revised to support ground-breaking new features, which get the language on par with C# and Java, but without the performance penalty of a garbage collector.\n\nC++ is one of the most popular languages in the world, and the data proves it. It’s community is the fourth largest, boasting 13.3M developers according to SlashData’s State of The Developer Nation. Meanwhile, C++ sits at third place in popularity as of the TIOBE Index, while GitHub’s 2022 State of the Octoverse ranks C++ as the sixth most prevalent language used across its 372M repositories.\n\nWhy Learn C++?\n\nIf you need high performance and low-level control over system resources for applications, C++ is an excellent choice. You can find thousands of entries of C++ frameworks, libraries, and applications in this Awesome List and C++ wiki, but to keep things short:\n\nGame Development: Unreal Engine, one of the most popular game development platforms, requires developers to code in C++ to create hit games like Fortnite and Street Fighter V.\n\nGraphical Applications: High-performance client applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, are built with C++ for their intensive graphical operations. The massively-popular Qt framework, used to build cross-platform GUI applications, treats C++ as a first-class citizen.\n\nOperating Systems: Microsoft’s Windows OS has core components written in C++, and Apple’s macOS incorporates C++ in its I/O Kit for low-level system components. Similarly, parts of the Linux kernel and various system utilities are implemented using C++.\n\nEmbedded Systems / Microcontroller: C++ is used in embedded system software for devices like smartwatches, medical machines, and IoT devices because of its efficiency and control over hardware. The most popular open hardware development board, Arduiono, uses C++.\n\n3D Graphics: C++ is used in 3D graphics for games and simulations with many available graphics API libraries like OpenGL, as well as in professional graphics software like AutoCAD.\n\nC++ developers are well-rewarded for their expertise. The StackOverflow 2023 Developer Survey cites a global median salary of $75K for C++ developers, with those in the United States earning a median of $130K, as per Glassdoor’s 2023 data.\n\nStats\n\nFour of the courses are suited towards absolute beginners to programming, while the rest require programming experience.\n\nSeven of the courses are free or free-to-audit, while three are paid.\n\nAround 18K people are following C++ Subject on Class Central.\n\nBest Free All-Rounder Resource (LearnCpp.com)\n\nReasons to Take\n\nTeaches Core and Modern C++ (C++17 and C++20)\n\nConstantly up-to-date\n\nComprehensive chapters with quizzes\n\nEasy to learn and reference\n\nLearnCpp.com is the best free all-rounder text-based tutorial and resource for C++. It aims to walk you through everything you’ll need to know in order to create and compile your programs, from the core aspects of C++ to the more advanced features of Modern C++.\n\nSince its inception in 2007, LearnCpp.com has consistently served as a reliable source of reference for beginner and intermediate C++ developers. Its reputation is backed up by various communities such as Reddit and C++ Discord groups (some of which are C++ Help, Better C++, and #include).\n\nIf you’re in search of comprehensive, yet easy-to-understand tutorials or references for C++, then look no further than this website.\n\nThe tutorials explore every essential C++ programming concept, spanning 28 chapters. To reinforce your understanding, each chapter concludes with a review quiz designed to test what you’ve learned. The chapters include:\n\nC++ Basics (Variables, Functions, Files, Data Types)\n\nConstants and Strings\n\nScope, Duration, and Linkage\n\nControl Flow\n\nError Detection and Handling\n\nType Conversion, Type Aliases, and Type Deduction\n\nFunction Overloading and Function Templates\n\nCompound Types (References, Pointers, Enums, and Structs)\n\nClasses\n\nDynamic / Fixed-size arrays\n\nIterators and Algorithms\n\nDynamic Allocation\n\nFunctions\n\nOperator Overloading\n\nMove Semantics and Smart Pointers\n\nObject Relationships\n\nInheritance\n\nVirtual Functions\n\nTemplates and Classes\n\nExceptions\n\nInput and Output (I/O)\n\nWhile LearnCpp tries to accommodate absolute beginners to programming, I’d recommend you try other courses in this BCG if you are one.
