        "text": "C++ is an advanced object-oriented programming language that helps programmers write fast and portable programs.\n\nA program considered movable or portable can be used not only in the operating system where it has been written but also in other systems without the necessity of processing.\n\nPortability should be the initial goal of any work implemented by the programmer because only in that case the program written by you will flawlessly work in any environment.\n\nIn general, programs written according to standard software interface rules, such as C language X / Open UNIX 95 interface, are portable. The only thing left to do is to compile the program in the new environment. Sometimes the programmers who write programs using standard software interface rules use operating system extensions for cases that may not exist in the new system. The mentioned extensions should be skipped or replaced with similar functions in the new operating system.\n\nThere are many programming languages, and some of them do not stand the test of time; they go out of the use or “die,” while others live long, gradually changing and developing even more. A programming language will not go out of use if it fits for continuous implementation, and such a language should be more effective than the others.\n\nBefore deciding to specialize in a language, you had better focus on the field for which the program should be written, its purpose, and the capacities of that particular language for creating a program with high performance and efficiency. Of course, there are also other reasons for choosing a language. Sometimes you may encounter an IT company where most programmers master Java and work with Java when choosing another programming language would have been more suitable for their product. Here, of course, it is important to find available programmers who master this or that language and to evaluate how easy it is to understand and learn the given language.\n\nAs a rule, everyone avoids complications.\n\nWhen choosing a language, many people pay attention to its value in the market as programmers get paid differently based on their specialized languages.\n\nHowever, the best approach to choosing a language is to emphasize the peculiarities of the program.\n\nIn this article, we will focus on this point.\n\nIn some emergencies, the language choice is not considered at all. For example, if productivity plays a huge role and each millisecond is crucial, then all the scripting languages are immediately put aside, even questioning the choice of Java and C# languages.\n\nIn such cases, C++ is the best option. Though C and assembler are faster than C++, they are not relevant nowadays.\n\nUnfortunately, the programmers who excellently master C++ are quite few because the process of learning and understanding this language is not a piece of cake while finding a fast, simple, and highly-paid position is easier and more available.\n\nWriting a program in C++ requires much time, attention, knowledge, and concentration. As the number of such programmers is small, but the demand is high, so is their payment.\n\nIt is important to note that programs written in C++ have a troubling issue; they are not very safe. That is to say; it is difficult not only to compile the code but also to work with the memory that would help prevent memory leaks and problems arising from it.\n\nOther languages also contain this risk, but the likelihood is smaller.\n\nOne of the advantages of C++ is that programs written with it require less memory and CPU work than programs written with a scripting language or C#, Java, and so on.\n\nIt is not right to claim that this fact can be decisive in the language choice because nowadays, memory and CPU are not very costly, especially when iCloud allows us to obtain an enormous amount of memory at affordable prices.\n\nUsing C++ is more rational when working on products with smaller embedded boards and microprocessors. It is a great choice when resources are limited, and there is a need to provide high speed (real-time).\n\nThe number of such cases is gradually reducing, but they still exist and require solutions with the appropriate programming toolkit.\n\nIf there aren’t any special requirements for the program, then it is more convenient to work with other modern languages where the programmer’s task is simplified.\n\nC++: fields of uses and applications\n\nLet’s speak a bit about the applications where the C++ programming language has been used.\n\nAs the language is very close to the hardware, it can easily access various resources and provide procedural programming with functions actively using the CPU. It is also widely used in 3D game development, as well as in multi-layer networking. All these advantages make C++ irreplaceable in game programming.\n\nHere is the list of games that have been programmed using C++:\n\nDoom III engine, Counter-Strike, Sierra On-line: Birthright, Hellfire, Soccer Professional, Bullrider I & II, Trophy Bear, Kings Quest, Antara, Hoyle Card games suite, SWAT, Blizzard: StarCraft, StarCraft: Brood War,\n\nDiablo I, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, Starfleet Command, Invictus, PBS’s Heritage: Civilization and therefore the Jews, Master of Orion III, CS-XII, MapleStory.\n\nGUI is the graphical user interface, a type of user interface that has keys, windows, and many other widgets that the user can access when using your application. The web browser is an obvious example of such an application that has everything mentioned above and a common window where the entire content is uploaded. Almost all Adobe applications, including Illustrator, Photoshop, and others, are designed with C++.\n\nMicrosoft’s famous application Win Amp Media Player, which has been providing all our audio/video activities for decades, is also developed with C++.\n\nC++ is also used when writing database management software. MYSQL and Postgres are among the most famous databases.\n\nFor example, MySQL is developed and supported by Oracle Corporation, which acquired trademark rights with Sun Microsystems, which in turn had previously obtained the Swedish company MySQL AB.\n\nIt is also written in C++ and is widely used in various companies.\n\nHere are some more databases written in C++:"
