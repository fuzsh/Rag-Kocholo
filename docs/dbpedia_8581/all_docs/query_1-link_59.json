        "text": "As the world of video games continues to grow, so does the need for talented programmers. Game development is a complex process that requires the use of specific programming languages to create the code that makes games function.\n\nSo, which programming languages are best for game development? It depends on the type of game you want to develop. For example, if you want to develop a 2D platformer, you might want to use a language like Lua and even JavaScript. But if you want to develop a 3D first-person shooter, you might want to use a language like C++ or C#.\n\nIn this article, weâll take a look at the best programming languages for game development, and discuss the different types of games that can be developed using each language.\n\nWhat Is Gaming Development?\n\nAbout Game Engines\n\nThe Best Programming Languages for Game Development\n\nC++\n\nJava\n\nJavaScript (with HTML and CSS)\n\nC#\n\nLua\n\nWhich Programming Language Should a Beginner Start with for Game Development?\n\nPython as a Game Development Language\n\nBest Programming Language for Simple Games\n\nBest Programming Languages for Complicated Games\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat Is Gaming Development?\n\nGaming development is the process of designing, creating, and coding a game. This process can be done in various ways depending on the type of game and the size of the development team.\n\nThere are many different types of games:\n\ntext based, 2D, 3D, and real-time\n\nsingle-player and multiplayer\n\nfocused on the graphic design, the story line, or the gameplay mechanics\n\nâ¦ But you surely know all of that, so letâs see how to actually develop games!\n\nAbout Game Engines\n\nWeâll be mentioning game engines a lot throughout this article, so letâs say that a game engine is a software development environment designed for people to build video games. It provides a framework for game developers to work in, and can be used to create both 2D and 3D games.\n\nThere are too many to list them all, but here are some of the ones weâll mention:\n\n<br>\n\nYou can also check out 11 tools to get you started making video games, by D. M. Moore on The Verge.\n\nThe Best Programming Languages for Game Development\n\nThese languages are all popular choices for game development, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Letâs take a detailed look at each language.\n\nC++\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nC++ is a good programming language for game development because itâs fast and efficient. Game developers use C++ to create high-performance games, and it also has plenty of debugging tools, which is important for game development.\n\nOther languages, such as Python, are designed for readability and simplicity. This makes Python an excellent choice for prototyping game ideas, but it wouldnât be suitable for developing a final product.\n\nAs a compiled language, C++ is converted into machine code before itâs run on a computer. This makes C++ programs run faster than interpreted languages such as Python. C++ also offers a variety of programming paradigms, such as object-oriented and data-driven programming.\n\nMany of the most popular game engines support C++, which means that there are a variety of tools and libraries that developers can use to create their games.\n\nPopular game engines using C++:\n\nUnreal Engine\n\nUnity\n\nCRYENGINE\n\nAmazon Lumberyard\n\nCons of C++ in general:\n\nitâs difficult to learn\n\nitâs a memory-managed language\n\nitâs not cross-platform*\n\n*Technically, you can write C++ code that will compile on different platforms. However, the compiled binaries will not be cross-platform. Also, many features and libraries are platform-specific; writing truly cross-platform C++ code would take a great deal of care, and likely be quite limiting when developing games.\n\nJava\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nJava is a versatile and powerful programming language thatâs widely used in many different industries. It can also be a good choice for game development, because it has many of the C++ strengths, plus it runs on a variety of platforms.\n\nAs a platform-independent language â thanks to the Java virtual machine (JVM) â Java games can be run on any operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes Java another popular choice for developing mobile games, as it can be run on iOS devices and Android. Java is, in fact, the language to develop native apps with Android Studio.\n\nWhile some game engines support Java, itâs not as fast as C++, which can be a drawback for some types of games.\n\nGame engines using Java:\n\njMonkeyEngine\n\nlibGDX\n\nJava 3D\n\nCons of Java in general:\n\nnot as easy to learn\n\nit can be slow, particularly in legacy devices\n\nitâs not as widely used as C++\n\nJavaScript (with HTML and CSS)\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nJavaScript (JS) is another versatile programming language thatâs used for game development, and it has the advantage of being relatively easy to learn. While JavaScript isnât as fast as C++ or Java, itâs still suitable for developing 2D games.\n\nWhile HTML and CSS arenât programming languages strictly speaking, they can be important technologies for game development. HTML is used to create the structure of a game, while CSS is used to style the game.\n\nJavaScript games can be run on any web browser, which makes them easy to distribute. However, JavaScript games arenât as widely used as games developed with other languages.\n\nPopular game engines using JavaScript:\n\nPhaser\n\nPixiJS\n\nCocos2d-x\n\nCons of JavaScript in general:\n\nnot as fast as other languages\n\nnot as widely used for games\n\nlimited to the browser\n\nCheck out the books HTML5 Games: Novice to Ninja, by Earle Castledine, Learn to Code with JavaScript, by Darren Jones, and How to Build a Game with Vue.js.\n\nC#\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nC# was created by Microsoft. It has many of the same advantages as C++, and itâs a particularly good choice for developing 2D and 3D games.\n\nOne advantage of C# over C++ is that itâs easier to learn. C# is also a cross-platform language, which means that games developed with C# can be run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nThe integration between C# and Visual Studio (also created by Microsoft) is excellent, and so are the debugging and testing tools.\n\nPopular game engines using C#:\n\nUnity\n\nUnreal Engine\n\nGodot\n\nCons of C# in general:\n\nnot as widely used\n\nlimited to the Microsoft ecosystem\n\nLua\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nLua is a lightweight scripting language thatâs used in many different industries, including game development. Itâs easy to learn and use, and itâs also fast (which is an unusual combo!).\n\nLua is often used for developing game logic, and it can be embedded into other programming languages. This makes it a good choice for developing games with complex mechanics.\n\nWhile some game engines support Lua, itâs not as widely used as other languages, but itâs still a great choice for making 2D games.\n\nPopular game engines using Lua:\n\nSolar2D\n\nLÃVE\n\nGideros\n\nCons of Lua in general:\n\nnot as widely used\n\nlimited to the game development industry\n\nWhich Programming Language Should a Beginner Start with for Game Development?\n\nLua, of course! As weâve already mentioned, Lua is a lightweight programming language thatâs easy to learn and use. So itâs something of a no-brainer that, if youâre new to programming, Lua will give you a good foundation on which to build more complex games.\n\nAdditionally, Lua has been used in a number of popular games, so there are plenty of resources out there to help you get started. On top of that, itâs a language that you can later use for scripting on many game engines while coding more complex projects on C++!\n\nPython as a Game Development Language\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nAlthough we didnât get to mention it, Python is yet another language thatâs popular among beginner developers. Just like Lua, itâs very easy to learn; and unlike Lua, itâs a general-purpose language that can open doors beyond the game development industry, such as data science and artificial intelligence.\n\nItâs not quite as lightweight as Lua, but itâs still a good option for beginners who want to develop simple games. And aside from being a scripting language supported by many engines (Delta3D, Godot (with some hacks), Source), it also has some engines:\n\nPygame (games)\n\nRenâPy (interactive stories)\n\nKivy (GUIs with which you would also write games\n\nHowever, expect less functionality than with other fully-fledged game engines.\n\nCheck out The Python Apprentice book by Austin Bingham and Robert Smallshire to learn more.\n\nBest Programming Language for Simple Games\n\nIf you want to develop a simple game, such as a 2D platformer or a puzzle game, you can use any programming language that you are comfortable with.\n\nAgain, Lua and Python can be good starting points for prototyping; but even JavaScript can make for a good 2D shooter that can be created extremely fast, especially when using assistive programming, such as OpenAIâs Codex.\n\n<br>\n\nCheck out the Build Your Own Wordle For Numbers: Numble article by Olivia Gibson, or even the book Build a Rock Paper Scissors Game from Scratch with React, by Madars Biss.\n\nBest Programming Languages for Complicated Games\n\nNow, if you want to develop a 3D first-person shooter or an open-world RPG, youâll need to use a more powerful programming language.\n\nC++ is probably your best choice for developing complicated games. Itâs a low-level language, which means it gives the programmer more control over the gameâs inner workings. This can be both good and bad: good, because you have more control over how the game runs; but bad, because it can be more difficult to write code in C++, and more difficult to debug.\n\nJava is another good choice for developing complicated games. Itâs a high-level language, which means itâs easier to write code in Java than in C++; but it also means you have less control over the gameâs inner workings.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith new technologies and platforms emerging every few years, the landscape of game development is constantly changing. As a result, the programming languages used to develop games have to change as well.\n\nIf youâre new to programming, we recommend starting with Lua or Python. These languages are easy to learn and use, and theyâll give you a good foundation on which to build more complex games.\n\nIf you want to develop a more complicated game, youâll need to use a more powerful programming language. C++, C# and even Java can be the best choice for developing complicated games.\n\nC++ particularly, as a low-level language, will give the programmer more control over the gameâs inner workings â¦ but of course, at the expense of more coding and debugging time. ð\n\nFAQs About Best Programming Languages for Game Development"
