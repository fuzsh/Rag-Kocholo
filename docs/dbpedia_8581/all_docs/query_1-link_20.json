        "text": "If the course requires it, then yes, sort of.\n\nWhat I mean is that I would assume the course will just walk you through the basics you need to do the course. C/C++ is being used as a teaching language, so you need to know what the course uses, that’s all – you’re supposed to be getting knowledge of data structures and algorithms out of it. The language used isn’t terribly important, the concepts are basically identical regardless of language.\n\nYou can use them for anything. But most things are built on top of them rather than them being written directly in C (so for example the Windows, Linux and OSX kernels are written mainly in C, many [most?] languages’ compilers were originally written in C or were written in a language that has a compiler originally written in C). I guess you wouldn’t normally write, say, some ML code in C, but you might use something (Python for example) that in turn uses C. C++ is a superset with a lot (a lot) of extra features on top of C. It’s used for loads of stuff. Often used for programs that need very high performance (eg most 3D game engines).\n\nThe languages require you to manage the memory yourself, and that’s an advantage if you need performance because it allows you to tune it. As compared to, say, JavaScript, where you do not need to manage the memory. You don’t need to learn them, you can get what you need from the algorithms course and freely use that knowledge in a different language.\n\nJust to give you a bit of context:\n\nC and Cpp are mostly used nowadays as system programming languages.\n\nYou can think of it as a “foundation” for other tools to work on.\n\nThink of them as the language used to write the software on which other people will write/use software upon. (oversimplified of course)\n\nBrowsers are predominately written in C/Cpp, but incidentally web developer uses Javascript to make webpages.\n\nGodot and Unreal Engine are written in Cpp, but you can develop video games using other languages that will run on that engine.\n\nMySQL is written in Cpp, but you don’t need it to use it to run queries into your database.\n\nMacOS is written in Cpp, but you don’t need it to use your Macbook\n\nAll this just to give you an idea of the “scope” of the language, hoping you will make a more informed decision\n\nIf your goal is just to learn data structures and algorithms, then I don’t know if I’d want to learn a new language. This class, is it a required school class or just something you found on the internet? If it is the latter case, I might suggest that you could find a course somewhere in a language with which you are more comfortable. Between the two, I think C might be easier to learn, especially just the basic things needed for this. But again, unless you need C or C++ for a job, or unless you have a lot of free time, I’d rather learn in a language I know and strengthen that. When you’re starting out, it’s better to learn a few (or one) languages well rather than dabbling in a bunch of languages.\n\nYes, C++ can be used for games, but there are other paths."
