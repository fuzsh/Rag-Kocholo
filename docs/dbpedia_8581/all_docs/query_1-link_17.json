        "text": "The exceptional memory management, flexibility, controls, and optimization capabilities of the C++ programming language make it an ideal choice for gaming resources. This is why you have to ensure that your game developer has extensive knowledge of C++ before you get them on board.\n\nWith so many freelance C++ developers on popular freelance job sites like Guru, you can easily find the right developer for your game. But before you start interviewing potential C++ programmers for your project, it’s important to make sure you understand how this programming language is used in game development.\n\nC++ is usually applied as a collected language, which is why so many vendors, including LLVM, Intel, Oracle, IBM, and Free Software Foundation, offer C++ compilers. Therefore, this language is available on numerous platforms. Because game development is a resource-intensive undertaking that requires a programming language with specific functionalities, C++ has proved to be a perfect choice for game developers.\n\nThere are many reasons why C++ is considered to be perfect for game development. For instance, it offers exceptional memory management, better control, and flexibility, allowing you to develop a unique game that meets the needs of its intended players. It also allows full optimization of your game.\n\nYour game needs a reliable and practical gaming engine to make it effective and easy to play. With C++, you don’t have to worry about the effectiveness of your game because it’s compatible with several popular gaming engines like 4A, CryEngine, C4, Antiyard Gx 3D, Unity, and Unreal. It can easily be aligned with the current gaming needs through regular development updates.\n\nBecause C++ is an extension of the low-level C language and is compatible with other assembly languages, it’s easy for your developers to work with the hardware-level elements. As a compiled programming language, C++ allows superior runtime performance than other complex interpreted languages.\n\nAnother reason why C++ is a perfect choice for your game development is the fact that it has numerous libraries that are suitable for developing games. These high-volume libraries will allow your developers to create high-performance games.\n\nWhat Is C++?\n\nC++ is a high-performance programming language that’s object-oriented. It’s considered to be one of the most effective programming languages, especially for developing large-scale products; C++ is an extension of the C language. Even Java, the other most popular programming language, is based on C++, but C++ is optimized to make it easy to distribute program objects on the internet and other similar networks.\n\nCompared to Java, C++ is a bit complicated to learn and requires a significant amount of training and study. This language continues to expand, with its latest version featuring object-oriented, standard, and purposeful features on top of its ability for low-level memory management.\n\nSo, is C++ good for software development? Yes–the language was developed with integrated, resource-constrained software, and across-the-board systems in mind. It’s also flexible enough to be used in various software development projects. Furthermore, this language has proved to be effective in developing other products like servers, video games, space probes, etc.\n\nThis programming language has been standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Its latest standard version was sanctioned and published by ISO in 2020 as ISO/UEC 14882:2020, also referred to as C++20. This version comes with more new features and an expanded standard library.\n\nC++ Develops Games across Different Platforms\n\nFor decades, professional game developers have been using C++ to develop high-performing games across different platforms using C++, including Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, and many others. Furthermore, this programming language is suitable for both 2D and 3D games. This also makes it suitable for 2D and 3D game engines.\n\nFor example, Unreal Engine uses C++ as its scripting language, while Unity Engine games are written in C#. However, the runtime language for Unity games is C++. At the moment, most gaming application programming interfaces (APIs) are written in C++. On top of its flexibility that offers low-level components, this programming language maintains high performance by compiling down to machine code.\n\nWriting C++ code requires more time, but its high performance compensates for the time lost. Therefore, take your time to learn the basics of C++ in game development so that you can choose a C++ game developer on Guru with the prerequisite knowledge, skill, and experience."
