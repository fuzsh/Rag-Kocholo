        "text": "#1 Python\n\nLanded at No.1 on the PYPL chart as the most popular programming language, Python accounts for 28.11% of the market share, making it the most used programming language in 2024, although it has been around for almost three decades. Python, developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989, is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in web app development, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), scientific computing, machine learning, etc.\n\nThere are many reasons why Python has remained one of the top programming languages since 1989. First of all, Python has a clean, readable, and concise syntax, and it is supported by a large community of software developers, making it easy for beginning programmers to learn and use. Secondly, its vast standard library provides a wide range of functionality (image manipulation, databases, unit testing, expressions, and more), allowing you to do more with less code.\n\nAdditionally, Python is a free and open-source programming language, so it can be a cost-effective solution for many businesses, especially small ones and startups. Moreover, Python is cross-platform, highly extensible, and can run on various operating systems, making it a versatile software programming language. Last but not least, this software development language can be integrated with other languages such as Java, C++, and .NET components. However, Python is not as fast as some other programming languages, so it may not be the best choice for performance-critical applications.\n\n#2 Java\n\nJava, created by James Gosling in 1995, has long been one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it holds the second position on the PYPL chart with a market share of 15.52%. Java is a general-purpose, platform-independent, and object-oriented programming language that enables developers to create robust and high-performance applications.\n\nLike Python, this popular language has a large and active community of Java developers who contribute to its continuous improvement. Moreover, the vast amount of documentation and resources available make it easy for freshers to get started with Java development. Furthermore, Java is supported by many major IDEs and automation tools, making the development process smoother. However, one downside of Java is that it is a bit verbose, so it can take more code to reach the same results as other programming languages.\n\nJava can be used for a wide range of applications, such as web development, mobile development, desktop applications, big data, Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and more.\n\n#3 JavaScript\n\nWith a market share of 8.57%, JavaScript ranks third on the PYPL chart. Created by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript is a versatile scripting language that runs on both the client-side and the server-side of web applications. It can be used to build interactive web interfaces, handle user input, manipulate the DOM, and more. JavaScript is the best programming language for web development as it can be used to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, although it can also be used for mobile app development, desktop applications, game development, and more.\n\nMoreover, it is easy to learn as it is similar to other programming languages such as Java and C++. Furthermore, JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it doesnât need to be compiled before being run. However, one downside of JavaScript is that it can be difficult to debug as it does not have a standard debugging environment.\n\n#4 C/C++\n\nC is a general-purpose programming language built by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. On the other hand, C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is a powerful object-oriented language that enables developers to create sophisticated systems. Although both languages are used for system programming, they have different applications. C is mainly used for embedded systems, while C++ is widely used in the development of desktop and server applications.\n\nWith a market share of 6.92%, C/C++ is a middle-level language, meaning that it can be used to write high-level code that can be read by humans, as well as machine code that can be readable for computers. Moreover, C/C++ is a compiled language, meaning that the code needs to be converted into machine code before it can be executed. This can result in faster execution times as the compiler can optimize the code for performance. However, C and C++ are not easy programming languages to learn for beginners as they are complex and have a steep learning curve.\n\n#5 C-sharp (C#)\n\nC# (pronounced as âC-sharpâ) is a Microsoft language created by Anders Hejlsberg in 2000. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming language that enables developers to create robust and high-performance applications. C# is ranked fifth on the PYPL chart with a market share of 6.73%. Similar to other C-family languages such as C++ and Java, C# is easy to learn and a type-safe programming language, meaning that you can catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.\n\nLike other popular programming languages, C# can be utilized for a variety of purposes, ranging from web development to mobile development, desktop applications, cloud-based services, and virtual reality (VR). C-sharp is also well-known as one of the top gaming programming languages. C# has the advantage of being cross-compatible with most of the game development platforms.\n\n#6 R\n\nR is a language and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R is a popular programming language among statisticians and data scientists for its wide range of statistical and graphical methods. Ranking seventh on the PYPL chart, R programming language accounts for 4.75% of the market share. R is a free and open-source language that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nR is the right programming language for data science (data mining, data analytics, and data visualization). R also has many packages that can be used for machine learning, such as the caret package â a set of tools to streamline the process of creating predictive models. In addition, RStudio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R that can be used to write code, debug code, and create data visualizations.\n\nHowever, R can be difficult to learn for beginners as it has a steep learning curve. In addition, R code can be difficult to read and debug due to its complex syntax. Despite these disadvantages, R is a powerful language that enables developers to create sophisticated statistical models.\n\n#7 PHP\n\nPHP (Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a commonly used, open-source scripting language created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. It is a general-purpose scripting programming language that is mainly used for web development. One of the reasons why PHP is one of the best programming languages for developing websites is it can be embedded into HTML code and doesnât need to be compiled before being executed.\n\nThe PHP code is executed on the servers, which generate HTML that is then sent to the client. PHP 7 - This version of PHP is up to twice as fast as older versions and has significantly reduced memory usage. Nonetheless, PHP code can be difficult to debug as it is not compiled before being executed. Moreover, PHP is not a very fast language compared to other languages such as C++.\n\nLikewise, it can also be used for other purposes, such as desktop applications and server-side programming. According to the PYPL chart, PHP ranks sixth in the list of the most popular programming languages in 2024, with a market share of 4.57%. PHP programmers are in high demand as the language is used by some of the most popular webs, such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress.\n\n#8 TypeScript\n\nDeveloped and maintained by Microsoft, TypeScript is one of the widely used functional programming languages. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. However, TypeScript adds additional features to the language, such as static typing and class-based object-oriented programming. Static typing enables type checking at compile-time, which can help to prevent errors in the code. TypeScript is ranked eighth on the PYPL chart with a market share of 2.78%, and its popularity is sharply increasing.\n\nIn terms of advantages, TypeScript makes code easier to read or debug. Moreover, TypeScript code can be easily refactored, which makes it easier to maintain large codebases. This popular language is used for large-scale JavaScript applications. The Angular framework, developed by Google, is written in TypeScript. Other popular frameworks that are written in this language include Vue.js and React. In addition, TypeScript is used by Microsoft to develop Azure App services, Visual Studio code, and many other products.\n\n#9 Swift\n\nSpeaking of Swift, it is quite a new language launched by Apple in 2014, and it is designed to be fast, safe, and easy to use. Swift requires fewer coding skills, and it is easier to read and write than Objective-C. As a result, Swift has quickly become the preferred language for developing iOS and macOS applications, and it is used by IBM for cloud-based application development. At the moment, Swift is ranked 9th on the PYPL chart of most used programming languages, with a market share of 2.75%.\n\n#10 Objective-C\n\nAccounting for 2.37% of the global market share, Objective-C will be the 10th most popular programming language in 2024. Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that was created in the early 1980s. It is primarily used to develop iOS applications, macOS applications, and other Apple software (such as tvOS and watchOS operating systems).\n\nThis is one of the easiest languages to learn for those who are already familiar with the C programming language. Objective-C also has a wide range of toolkits and libraries that can be used to develop apps. In addition, it has a rich set of IDEs and frameworks (such as Cocoa and Cocoa Touch) that make development faster and easier. However, Objective-C is not as popular as it once was due to the rise of newer languages such as Swift.\n\n#11 Rust\n\nRust is one of the programming languages of the future. Created by Mozilla in 2006, Rust is a cross-platform, statically typed, and free-to-use programming language that enables developers to work in various programming styles. This language provides memory safety without using garbage collection. In addition, it has a low learning curve and easy-to-read syntax. Rust is also known for its high performance and speed.\n\nIn addition, Rust has a variety of applications, such as network programming, game development, web development, and system programming.
