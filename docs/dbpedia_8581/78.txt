The C++ programming language (also referred to as C++ scripting language) is a general-purpose programming language that can be labelled in various ways, including—statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, and compiled. C++ (pronounced “see plus plus”) as well as a group of intermediate-level languages, because it comes with a mixture of features found in both high and low level languages. Bjarne Stroustrup created the ground work for C++ in 1979 while he was employed at Bell Labs. It has object-oriented features, such as classes, but also includes other improvements over the original. C++ was an improvement over the original name of “C with Classes,” which doesn’t have such a nice ring to it. The new name was given in 1983, and is a play on words. It literally means “Increment C by 1”, alluding to the fact that it’s better than C.

C++ is one of the most widely accepted programming languages that has found its way into a great many hardware and OS platforms. It is known to be able to compile native code efficiently, and is used for developing operating systems, applications, device drivers, embedded software, high-performance server and client applications, and video games. A number of groups offer both free and paid C++ programming language compiler software, including the GNU Project, Microsoft, Intel and Embarcadero Technologies. The C++ programming language has been a significant influence on other popular programming languages, and in particular C# and Java. Other widely used and popular languages, like Objective-C use a markedly different syntax and approach to adding classes to the C++ language.
