Embarcadero Dev-C++ is a new and improved fork (sponsored by Embarcadero) of Bloodshed Dev-C++ and Orwell Dev-C++. It is a full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and code editor for the C/C++ programming language. It uses Mingw port of GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) as its compiler. Embarcadero Dev-C++ can also be used in combination with Cygwin or any other GCC based compiler. Embarcadero Dev-C++ is built using the latest version of Embarcadero Delphi. Embarcadero Dev-C++ has a low memory footprint because it is a native Windows application and does not use Electron. Optimized for parallel compilation on modern multi-core machines.

User Reviews

Embarcadero Dev-C++ is good. However, the UI interface is much different from original Dev-C++ (Orwell version and bloodshed version). Here I recommend "Xiaoloong Dev-C++", which supports Windows 11/10/8/7, and is very similar to the original.

Currently there's still some work to do, and the support lack: The IDE isn't as stable as needed, the Astyle menù item isn't working in some conditions, the project clean also fail in some condition, and the additionall UI Themes provided are quite useless and ugly. Moreover there are just few releases quite old: it seems to me that even this Dev-C++ evolution became a zombie! Honestly, at this moment (September 2022), I should say that IMHO a better Dev-C++ evolution - for teaching and developing simple C++ programs - could be another SourceForge Dev-C++ project: "Red Panda Dev C++" (version 1.2 and following). Hope to see asap a better release also from Embarcadero, as I was a Borland Turbo C++ developer and also a C++Builder buyer.

In my opinion, when it comes to writing applications on C language - this IDE is handier than the Visual Studio. For one simple reason - It just works! When I need to add a library to the project, I just need to add .c and .h files to the project. That's it! Unfortunately, can't say the same about the Visual Studio. Although sometimes Embarcadero Dev-C++ doesn't seem to work as stable as the Visual Studio, it's convenience, speed, and ease-of-use are overshadowing all of its flaws making it a worthy alternative to the Visual Studio.

It reborned, finally!

Absolutely amazing!!
