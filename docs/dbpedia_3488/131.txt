"The Invisible War" is an-Academy Award nominated documentary film about the epidemic of sexual violence in the United States military.

According to the Defense Department's own reporting, 20 percent of veterans have been sexually assaulted while serving. But fewer than 15 percent of survivors report the assault. Again, the Defense Department's own estimates suggest that in 2010 alone, almost 20,000 sexual assaults occurred in the United States military.

Guests
