        "text": "Film phase:Completed\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA groundbreaking investigation into the epidemic of rape in the US military, the institutions that perpetuate and cover up its existence, and its profound personal and social consequences.\n\nABOUT THE DIRECTORS\n\nAmy Ziering is an award winning Academy award and Emmy nominated documentary director and producer. Her film Outrage, for which she received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Investigative Journalism, is a searing indictment of the hypocrisy of powerful, closeted politicians and the institutions that protect them. Ziering also co-directed and produced Derrida, a documentary about the world-renowned French philosopher and the philosophical movement known as deconstruction. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, won the Golden Gate award at the San Francisco Film Festival, was released theatrically by Zeitgeist Films and features an original score by Oscar winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is the 2012 recipient of the Nestor Almendros Prize for Courage and Filmmaking, the 2013 Ridenhour Documentary Film Prize, and the 2013 Gracie Award for Outstanding Producer – News/Non-Fiction.\n\nKirby Dick is an Academy and Emmy Award-nominated documentary director. In 2006 he directed This Film Is Not Yet Rated, released by IFC Films. A breakthrough investigation of the highly secretive MPAA film ratings system, the film compelled the MPAA to make long overdue changes in the way it rates films. Dick’s prior film, Twist of Faith, is the powerful story of a man confronting the trauma of his past sexual abuse by a Catholic priest. Produced for HBO, Twist of Faith received a 2004 Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Dick’s other films include Derrida, a complex portrait of the world-renowned French philosopher Jacques Derrida, which won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco Film Festival, and the internationally acclaimed Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist, which won the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and the Grand Prize at the Los Angeles Film Festival."
