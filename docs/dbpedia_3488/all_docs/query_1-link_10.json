        "text": "This well-crafted film directed by Kirby Dick (This Film Is Not Yet Rated, Outrage) investigates the widespread phenomenon of rape in the United States military. While the documentary provides plenty of disturbing statistics taken from official records, its greatest power lies in sympathetic portrayals of the strong women who became victims of sexual assault, and who were subsequently betrayed deeply by a system in which they and their families trusted idealistically and naively. The film provides a moving and hard-hitting expose of the long-term traumatic consequences for the survivors. It also depicts the perseverance some of them have been able to muster in trying to attain justice, or even medical care, for sustained injuries. We see the hypocrisy in some systemic attempts meant to prevent rape, the indifference of administrators, and the struggle of individuals against almost unbreakable chains of command. The outrage the film generates leads to an examination of larger cultural issues, too, such as gender equality and the role of the military. AM"
