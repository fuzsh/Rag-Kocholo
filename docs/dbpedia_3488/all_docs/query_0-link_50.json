        "text": "From Oscar® and Emmy®-nominated filmmaker Kirby Dick (This Film Is Not Yet Rated; Twist of Faith) comes The Invisible War, a groundbreaking investigative documentary about one of America's most shameful and best kept secrets: the epidemic of rape within the U.S. military. The film paints a startling picture of the extent of the problem-today, a female soldier in combat zones is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. The Department of Defense estimates there were a staggering 19,000 violent sex crimes in the military in 2010. The Invisible War exposes the epidemic, breaking open one of the most under-reported stories of our generation, to the nation and the world.\n\nSundance Film Festival, 2012\n\nHuman Rights Watch Film Festival, 2012\n\n“This is not a movie that can be ignored.” —A.O. Scott, The New York Times\n\n“Shocking and important” —Entertainment Weekly"
