        "text": "There are 1.5 million active-duty personnel in the U.S. Armed Forces. Sexual assault is an increasing problem within those ranks. In many, if not most cases, it's swept under the carpet: only 8 percent of sexual assault cases are prosecuted in the military, and only 2 percent of those cases result in convictions. The filmmaker Kirby Dick's new documentary, THE INVISIBLE WAR, sheds light on the suffering of thousands of military rape victims, and he'll join Doug on Friday to talk about it. (Rebroadcast)\n\nThe Invisible War opens at the Tower Theater in Salt Lake City on Friday, July 20. Daily screenings are scheduled at 2:10 p.m. and 7 p.m. For more information on the film, visit the Salt Lake Film Society's web site. A Q&A will follow Friday's 7 p.m. screening. On hand will be Geralyn Dreyfous, whose company Impact Partners helped finance The Invisible War; Donna McAleer, a subject in the film and a West Point Class President; Lt. Col. Chris Gedney, Retired USAF; and Emeritus Honorary Lt. Gen. (Volunteer) Celeste Gleave of FYVE STAR, Inc.\n\nThanks to The Christan Center of Park City, our hosts for the 2012 Sundance Film Festival."
