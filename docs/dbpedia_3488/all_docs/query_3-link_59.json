        "text": "In a culture where spiritual warfare is everywhere, it’s time to put on the armor of God and fight the demonic forces at work in this world! In Chip Ingram’s book, The Invisible War, he will teach you what every Christian needs to know about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.\n\nThis is a paperback book.\n\nDescription\n\nMany believers have no idea how much of their daily lives are influenced by the subtle deception and lies of our adversary. But, the fact that you’re considering this book proves that you care about your spiritual life, especially in light of the invisible war we face as Christians.\n\nThere is an unseen battle against demonic forces going on in this world. The Bible clearly teaches that Satan is on mission to destroy God’s people. And the problem is, Satan doesn’t announce his temptations and schemes. Instead, he’s very secretive as he attempts to lead Christians down a delicate, subtle, gradual path of deception.\n\nHow can you defend yourself? How can you win? In Chip Ingram’s bestselling book, The Invisible War, he draws on Ephesians 6 in a powerful way to reveal what believers need to know in order to defend themselves and their families against Satan’s daily attacks.\n\nIn his book, The Invisible War, Chip leads you through an in-depth Bible study where you will see what God has to say about Satan’s goals and tactics, the spiritual armor God offers us, and the confidence we can have about our sure victory over the Enemy.\n\nChip Ingram’s book, The Invisible War, includes the following sections and chapters:\n\nSpiritual Warfare 101: What Every Believer Needs to Know\n\nWhy You Struggle\n\nYour Life – Behind the Scenes\n\nYou Have a Personal Enemy\n\nOur Strategic Position\n\nSpiritual Warfare 201: How to Prepare Yourself for Spiritual Battle\n\nYour Personal “Code Red”\n\nSifting Through False Intelligence\n\nIn Sync with God\n\nBombarded by Doubts\n\nSpiritual Warfare 301: How to Do Battle with the Enemy and Win\n\nWhen You’re Attacked\n\nCultivate Invincible Faith\n\nThe Battle for Your Mind\n\nWield Your Weapons\n\nSpiritual Warfare 401: Deliverance from Demonic Influence\n\nThe Missing Ingredient of Your Life\n\nWhen the Enemy Gets In\n\nHow to Find Freedom\n\nCheck out these supporting resources for The Invisible War book or watch on YouTube here."
