        "text": "He might not be a household name — even to film buffs — but documentary filmmaker Kirby Dick is eminently worthy of the Faith Hubley Career Achievement Award, which he receives this week at the Provincetown International Film Festival (June 13-17). He joins fellow honorees director Roger Corman and actress Parker Posey in a conversation led by John Waters at their awards ceremony, at 5 p.m. Saturday, June 16, in Provincetown Town Hall, 260 Commercial St.\n\nIt’s not because he has a signature approach to documentaries, like last year’s Hubley winner, Albert Maysles, but instead because of his relentless and fearless reporting, and the remarkable lives and uncomfortable issues that he brings to the screen.\n\nDick has a knack for unearthing the profound stories behind a sensational hook. Performance artist Bob Flanagan, whom Dick profiled in his brilliant 1997 feature, “Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist,” is a case in point: in the art world, Flanagan was infamous for the outrageous self-torture he would perform in galleries and museums — most notoriously, for nailing his penis to a wooden board. (Needless to say, it’s not easy to watch this bloody spectacle happen live in “Sick.”) But there is so much more to Flanagan than a provocative act: as a lifelong sufferer of cystic fibrosis, his sexual thrill in experiencing pain actually helped him to endure the extreme hardship of his suffocating, terminal disease. Dick helped to expose the heroic human being and inspired artist behind the attention-grabbing performance, from his fascinating (some might say codependent) marriage to a Jewish dominatrix to his final work of art — his death and the preservation of his withered body.\n\nAnd it wouldn’t be the last time that Dick would explore sexual taboos. “I think sexuality is something that lends itself to film,” he says. “There’s something sensual about the film experience. I’m always looking for psychological and political complexity, and sexuality is in play in both of them.”\n\nThat would explain what inspired him to film his 1985 debut feature, “Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate,” which Dick embarked on after graduating from the prestigious California Institute of the Arts. His Academy Award–nominated 2004 feature, “Twist of Faith,” chronicled the anguish of a Toledo, Ohio, firefighter, Tony Comes, who was sexually abused by a priest in his youth. Comes’s all-American world, and his picture-book marriage, starts to painfully unravel as Dick follows him in his fight for recognition from the Roman Catholic Church. “I’m very drawn to the perspective of outsiders,” Dick says. “I’m looking to give a voice to people who are in the wilderness.”\n\nStill, it’s difficult to pigeonhole the 59-year-old Dick as an artist — each of his films is a unique undertaking. “I always feel extremely tender toward my subjects,” he says. “Each film is a shared voyage or experience, but when that’s over I move on. Every new film I make seems to upset the fans of my previous film, but I want to start from scratch with a completely new canvas. It’s part of an artist’s temperament to look for new territory.”\n\nThe beautifully shot “Derrida” (2002), which Dick co-directed with Amy Ziering, was certainly a departure. It’s an intimate portrait of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, an Algerian-born Sephardic Jew, who formulated the concept of deconstruction that revolutionized the literary arts scene in the 1970s and had a profound influence on anthropology, linguistics and psychoanalysis. Derrida appears in Dick’s film as a surprisingly affable, gentle and charming man — not at all the aloof and challenging figure one might expect. (He died of pancreatic cancer two years after the film was released.)\n\nMore recently, Dick has produced documentaries that relied heavily on investigative journalism, such as his 2006 “This Film Is Not Yet Rated” (at 4 p.m. Thursday, June 14, at Waters Edge 2), an exposé of the Motion Picture Association of America’s rating system and how it’s stacked against independent films and sexually frank content. And then there’s “Outrage” (2009), which looks into the practice of outing anti-gay politicians who are in the closet. Dick’s newest film, “The Invisible War,” about the little-known pervasiveness of female soldiers being sexually assaulted and raped in the Armed Forces, is yet another political bombshell. The soon-to-be-released feature, which premiered at Sundance, will be screened at 4:30 pm Friday, June 15, at the Art House and at noon Sunday, June 17, at the Schoolhouse.\n\nWhen asked about the difficulties of generating empathy in a counterculture-embracing audience for the plight of women in the Armed Forces, Dick acknowledges that “in some ways I had that perception of the military going into it, but I really had my eyes opened.” The women who enlist “are very idealistic,” he says. “They’re actually the people that you’d want to be going into the military. We have a country that’s really two societies: there are those who are in the military and support the military and those who are very critical of the military. The divide is so stark that it doesn’t allow for complete civilian oversight. The film is not anti-military — it was made to help change things. We wanted the military to be receptive to it, and it’s already had an incredible effect in Washington.”\n\nIf that sounds more like the words of a tough-minded pragmatist than a provocateur, Dick doesn’t seem to mind. “I came out of art school wanting to get involved in film,” he says. “I was looking for psychological complexity and edge. Once I got involved, I was kind of hooked. I wasn’t coming at it from a journalistic perspective, but it has become a much more important part of my approach. I took the rigor of art school and brought it to the films I make.”"
