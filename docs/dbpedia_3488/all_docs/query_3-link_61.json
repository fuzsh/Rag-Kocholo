        "text": "On Sunday, June 23, 2013, 300 guests attended a sold-out screening and disucussion of the Academy Award nominated documentary THE INVISIBLE WAR, at the Ann and and Jerry Moss Theater at New Roads School. THE INVISIBLE WAR draws attention to the epidemic of sexual assault within the U.S. military. LA Times Film Critic Kenneth Turan moderated a timely panel discussion with the filmâ€™s Director, Kirby Dick, and the Producer, Amy Ziering, as well as Liesl Gerntholtz, Director of the Women's Rights Division at HRW, and Tandy Fink, one of the survivors interviewed in the film. Following the screening, guests were invited to a reception catered by Sal Marino of Il Grano. Join HRW for the next Film Club Screening on Sunday, September 29 at New Roads School when we will screen \"Which Way Is the Front Line From Here? The Life and Time of Tim Hetherington\". Stay tuned for more details!"
