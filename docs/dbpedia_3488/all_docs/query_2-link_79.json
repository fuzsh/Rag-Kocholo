Bradley notes that it took 82 Oscar ceremonies for a woman to win the prize for best director (Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker). However, since 2009, 17 films directed or co-directed by women have been nominated in the best documentary feature category.

That was a pretty good run!\n\nBradley suggests that the Oscar disparity between fiction and non-fiction films could exist because the barriers to entry in documentary film are much lower. Meanwhile, Free Solo director, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, states in the article that “documentaries require an enormous amount of grit and empathy - and that is something women are incredibly strong at.”\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing is clear. We need more women directors in the film industry. In addition, we need to support the films that female filmmakers create. With that in mind, here are seven of my favourite documentaries directed by women (stay to the end for a list of very honourable mentions):\n\nStories We Tell - Sarah Polley\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nStories We Tell is a deeply personal exploration of director Sarah Polley’s family. As Polley unravels (detective style) the mysteries of her childhood, she reveals an intimate and intriguing collection of memories about the mother, Diane, she lost aged just 11 years old.\n\nHowever, this is not just a film about Polley’s experiences. What sets Stories We Tell apart from other (perhaps more self-involved) documentaries is how Polley digs deeper and examines more universal questions - exploring the power of stories, the act of storytelling, the concept of truth and the elusive nature of memory.\n\nClick here to read more about Polley’s powerful documentary\n\nBlackfish - Gabriela Cowperthwaite\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Dawn Brancheau was killed at Orlando’s SeaWorld marine park. Her killer was the 12,000 pound orca called Tilikum that Brancheau - an extremely experienced trainer - had helped train and had performed with for years.\n\nDirector Gabriela Cowperthwaite had many questions following the tragedy. “Something wasn’t right,” she recalls. “Why would a highly intelligent animal attack its trainer – in effect, bite the hand that feeds it?\"\n\nAt the start, Cowperthwaite really didn’t know what story she wanted to tell. “For two years we were bombarded with terrifying facts, autopsy reports, sobbing interviewees, and unhappy animals – a place diametrically opposite to its [SeaWorld's] carefully refined image,” she explains. “But as I moved forward, I knew that we had a chance to fix some things that had come unraveled along the way. And that all I had to do was tell the truth.”\n\nClick here to read more about the Blackfish effect.\n\nWest Of Memphis - Amy Berg\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nOn 6 May, 1993 the naked and mutilated bodies of three eight year old boys - Stevie Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers - were found in a watery ditch in West Memphis, Arkansas.\n\nUnder significant pressure to solve the crime and in the midst of satanic panic hysteria, three local teenagers - Damien Echols, his friend Jason Baldwin and Jesse Misskelley - were arrested, charged and then convicted of the brutal murders.\n\nDirector Amy Berg spent over two years conducting research and chasing leads about the case before she began tp make her documentary, West Of Memphis. \"Rarely had I come across a failure of justice with such profound consequences - three young men falsely convicted of crimes for which they were still imprisoned; six families lives forever destroyed while the real killer of three eight year old boys remained free,\" she says.\n\nBerg explains that \"a combination of poverty, corruption, political ambition and religious bigotry had collided in this case to create a horrific illustration of how wrong things can go for everyone when we, as a society, fail to do all in our power to discover the truth.\"\n\nClick here for more on West Of Memphis\n\nFaces Places\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings.

Of her many brilliant films, I absolutely love Faces Places. On paper, the documentary seems like a strange concept. An octogenarian filmmaker tootles around the French countryside with JR, a photographer in his thirties, in a van that looks like a camera.\n\nOccasionally - and seemingly without a plan - they stop and take pictures of the people they meet. The images are then plastered on walls, barns, water towers and the like.\n\nIt shouldn’t work but, thanks to the friendship between Varda and JR, it does - it really, really does. The unlikely pair have a truly special chemistry.\n\nIt is wonderful to watch them talk about their art and, through these fascinating and endearing interactions (JR enjoys teasing Varda), we see the exuberant bravado of youth juxtaposed with the wisdom and poignancy of old age.\n\nClick here for more on Faces Places\n\nCitizenfour\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nFilmmaker, Laura Poitras, had been working on a film about surveillance for two years when she was contacted by someone using the name “Citizenfour”. The contact was a man and he knew about Poitras because she had been the target of US government surveillance and had steadfastly refused to be intimidated.\n\nCitizenfour revealed that he was a high level NSA analyst and that he could expose the massive amount of surveillance of Americans (and others). Poitras persuaded Citizenfour to let her film him. He agreed and Poitras along with Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald flew to Hong Kong to meet Citizenfour - otherwise known as Edward Snowden.\n\nCitizenfour is a truly remarkable documentary. It is nothing short of incredible to be in the hotel room with Poitras and Greenwald and hear Edward Snowden tell his story.\n\nClick here for more about Citizenfour\n\nCameraperson - Kirsten Johnson\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nKirsten Johnson is one of the most respected cinematographers working in documentary cinema. Her impressive filmography includes Citizenfour, Fahrenheit 9/11, The Invisible War and Audrie & Daisy.\n\nAfter 25 years behind the camera, Johnson decided to take pieces of memorable footage and edit them together to form a memoir, an exploration of human connections and a look at what it means to film and be filmed.\n\nCameraperson is a cinematic collage - a series of film moments selected from a truly illustrious career. There is no voice over, nothing to tell you what to make of the footage you are watching. An introductory title card explains that, while Johnson “originally shot the following footage for other films”, she would like us to see this new film as \"my memoir. These are the images that have marked me and leave me wondering still”.\n\nClick here for more about Cameraperson\n\nFor Sama - Waad al-Kateab\n\nYoutube content is not displayed due to your cookie settings. Click on the functional YouTube cookies in the cookie banner to agree to load and display content from YouTube.\n\nFor Sama isn’t the first documentary that I have watched about the devastating conflict in Syria. Over the last few years, there has been a steady influx of films - including The White Helmets, City Of Ghosts and Last Men in Aleppo - depicting the war and the battle for Aleppo.\n\nHowever, Waad al-Kateab’s documentary is the one I feel will stay with me the most.\n\nIt is For Sama’s mix of powerful journalism and intimate storytelling that makes this film an unforgettable experience. The documentary offers both an uncompromising and important account of life in Aleppo between 2012 and 2016 and immersive access to a family under siege.\n\nClick here to read more about For Sama."
