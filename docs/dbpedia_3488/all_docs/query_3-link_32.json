        "text": "Over the last few years, the Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP) has been hard at work developing a first of its kind training for the core components of cognitive behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP). The resulting Second Life Island for Preventing Suicide, or SLIPS, is an asynchronous, avatar-based learning environment focused on reinforcing the concepts learned during traditional two-day CBT-SP workshops.\n\nBy show of hands, how many of us encounter clients that are struggling with substance abuse and addiction in the midst of dealing with other mental health issues? Ok, this is a blog, so of course I can’t see your hands, but I am imagining a wall of hands in the air of everyone reading this. And of course that is because substance use disorders are highly co-morbid with other mental health conditions. If you’re like me, having received training in several evidence-based psychotherapies for various conditions, you may not have a lot of experience or training in how to treat or manage co-morbid substance use disorders (SUD). This can be particularly true regarding the addition of medication-assisted therapist (MAT) for SUD."
