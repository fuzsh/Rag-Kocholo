        "text": "The documentary filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have spent the past decade illuminating sexual abuse accusations in institutions like the military, in “The Invisible War” (2012); colleges, in “The Hunting Ground” (2015); and the music industry, in “On the Record” (2020). Now they have set their sights on Dylan Farrow’s decades-old sexual abuse allegations against her adoptive father, Woody Allen.\n\n“Allen v. Farrow” is a four-part docuseries set to debut later this month that takes viewers into Farrow’s public experience of accusing a famous and powerful man of abuse but also lays out details of the case that haven’t been shared with the public.\n\nInitially, Farrow’s story didn’t comport with Dick and Ziering’s usual broad-based investigations, but on closer examination the filmmakers found it offered them a chance to discuss familial child abuse and incest, a topic that survivors consistently asked the two to tackle.\n\nEverybody, though, talks about Woody Allen and Mia Farrow. The one-time Hollywood power couple were together for 12 years. Never marrying and keeping separate residences, they made 13 films together, adopted two children (Dylan and Moses), and had another (Satchel, who changed his name to Ronan after his parents split). They were the talk of the town until it all came crashing down in 1992. In the course of eight months, Farrow discovered naked photos of her then college-age daughter Soon-Yi Previn in Allen’s apartment; that summer, 7-year old Dylan said Allen sexually assaulted her. Those accusations led to an ugly custody fight and a family permanently torn asunder. Allen has consistently denied the accusations, and after investigations in Connecticut and New York, he was not charged with a crime.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
