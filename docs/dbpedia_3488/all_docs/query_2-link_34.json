        "text": "With horror-movie music and stark white-on-gray titles, “Outrage” promises to illuminate a “brilliant conspiracy” that protects the secret lives of some powerful politicians while ensuring that the rights and interests of ordinary gay and lesbian Americans remain marginal. The choice of the word conspiracy may be deliberately provocative, but this indignant and methodical new documentary, directed by Kirby Dick, offers a lot of insight into the ideology and psychology of present-day political homophobia.\n\nI say present-day, but “Outrage,” a battlefield report from the culture wars clearly intended to rally the morale of one side while attacking the exposed flanks of the other, is also a snapshot of a rapidly changing landscape. Its accusations of hypocrisy and betrayal are pointed and in many cases persuasive, but they would have sounded different  more urgent, and perhaps more incendiary  a few years or even six months ago. With each passing day that brilliant conspiracy looks increasingly tattered and beleaguered, and the men at the center of it seem less fearsome than pathetic.\n\nMr. Dick, whose previous documentaries have examined sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, the inner workings of the movie ratings system and the life and work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, is a cerebral muckraker.\n\nWhile his techniques are not as nakedly tendentious as Michael Moore’s (and his movies, as a consequence, are not as much fun), he hardly pretends to be a detached or unbiased observer. “Outrage” is less an analysis of the practice of outing closeted public officials than a defense of it, an argument that the dignity and full citizenship of gay men and lesbians are undermined by an unspoken pact of secrecy.\n\nThis idea has been a foundation of gay politics for a long time: a clip at the end of “Outrage” shows Harvey Milk, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors more than 30 years ago, insisting that coming out was central to the project of gay civil rights. And Mr. Dick’s film often works less as an exposé of current injustice than as a historical essay, looking back in particular on the 1980s, when AIDS made candor and visibility matters of survival for many gay men and when resistance to gay rights began to emerge as an organizing principle for conservatives in the Republican Party.\n\nMuch of “Outrage” consists of interviews with journalists and activists who reflect on that history, including Andrew Sullivan, the blogger and author; Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat; and Larry Kramer, the novelist and playwright who was a founder of Act Up. Their reflections are interwoven with allegations about the sex lives of several well-known current political figures, including Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Representative David Dreier of California and Larry E. Craig, the former Idaho senator whose arrest on a charge of soliciting sex in a Minnesota airport bathroom provides Mr. Dick with his most complete case study.\n\n(In a somewhat manipulative passage he juxtaposes Mr. Craig’s denials of homosexuality with reflections by James E. McGreevey, the former New Jersey governor, on the psychic and spiritual costs of such denial. Mr. McGreevey is talking about himself, but the editing makes it seem as if he also has Mr. Craig in mind.)\n\nThe central claim of “Outrage”  advanced most ardently by Michael Rogers, a blogger who sees it as his mission to name names and reveal secrets  is that politicians who vote against gay interests while surreptitiously pursuing gay sex deserve exposure. There was a time when this position seemed much more radical than it does now, and I suspect that “Outrage” might create less of a furor than it would have a few years ago.\n\nThe reason for this may have less to do with the vicissitudes of electoral politics, which are Mr. Dick’s focus, than with the social changes his film quietly and powerfully documents. In other words, the real story is not in the discretion and possible dishonesty of the targets of outing, but rather in the openness and self-acceptance of nearly everyone else in the film, people who are able to assert their humanity, their normalcy, without shame or apology.\n\n“Washington is a very gay town,” one of them says. “And it’s also a deeply closeted town.” A generation ago the first part of that statement would have sounded scandalous, but a generation from now the second part is likely to sound quaint, even a little outlandish, as parents patiently explain to their puzzled children that in the olden days gay people were supposed to be ashamed of themselves, just as black people were forced to use different bathrooms and women were not allowed to vote.\n\nWhich is not to say that the debates and issues raised by “Outrage” are by any means settled. But history moves fast, and this movie, haunted overtly by the 2004 elections and implicitly by the passage of Proposition 8 last year in California, when Republicans successfully rallied opposition to gay marriage, meets its audience in a notably changed world. Somewhat surprisingly, what was clearly intended as a culture-war call to arms feels more like a declaration of victory.\n\nOUTRAGE\n\nOpens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington.\n\nWritten and directed by Kirby Dick; director of photography, Thaddeus Wadleigh; edited by Doug Blush and Matt Clarke; music by Peter Golub; produced by Amy Ziering; released by Magnolia Pictures. In Manhattan at the Chelsea Clearview Cinemas, 260 West 23d Street. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. This film is not rated."
