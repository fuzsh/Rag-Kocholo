In the spirit of Derrida&rsquo;s work, acclaimed filmmakers Kirby Dick (Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist) and Amy Ziering Kofman have created an innovative and entertaining portrait by questioning the very concept of biography itself. Featuring a mesmerizing score by Oscar-winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto (The Last Emperor), Derrida is a playful and provocative glimpse at a visionary thinker as he ruminates on everything from Seinfeld to the sex lives of ancient philosophers.",
