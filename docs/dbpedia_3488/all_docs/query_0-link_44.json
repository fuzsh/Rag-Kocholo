        "text": "Women have been sexually harassed and assaulted in the work force for years, and for many years, the US Army has been dealing with this enormous and overwhelming issue, through the help of their agency known as the Equal Opportunity Program (EOP). In the US Army regulation 600-20, Army Chief of Staff, General Raymond T Odierno, States the purpose, “This regulation prescribes the policies and responsibilities of command, which include the Well-being of the force, military discipline, and conduct, the Army Equal Opportunity (EO) Program, and the Army Sexual Assault Victim Program.“ For a long time, the Army’s EOP Equal Opportunity\n\nMore than a decade after rape or physical assault during military service, women reported severely decreased health-related quality of life, with limitations of physical and emotional health, educational and financial attainment, and severe, recurrent problems with work and social activities.” (Para 4.) The article talks about the frequency of women getting raped or sexually assaulted, and the injuries that these women face physically and emotionally, even years after the incident occurs. In this particular study, a “Cohort of women veterans who served in the Vietnam, post-Vietnam, or Persian Gulf War era was selected.” (Para 9.) Around six hundred women participated in this study, and “Almost half the participants (48%) reported some type of physical or sexual victimization during their military service. Physical assault was reported by 35%, and most (58%) had been assaulted at least twice. Rape was reported by 30%, in 11% it was attempted and in 19% completed.” The seriousness of these situations recurring should not go\n\nThroughout history, the United States Military has faced numerous scandals. From its role in the Vietnam War, to the Iran-Contra Affair, to the Iraq War, to the abuse and denial of due process rights to detainees currently held indefinitely at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; the Department of Defense has undeniably raised many questions about its ethics and treatment toward both civilians and fellow members of the Armed Forces alike. One recent scandal, which would now appear to be becoming the standard, is that of sexual assault within the military. However, due to a campaign of awareness, grassroots activism, and pressuring elected officials to do what is right, things are now beginning to change.\n\nIn the past, military news typically evolved tragic training incidents or deaths during overseas combat. However, over the last several years many incidents involving military personnel and sexual assault have made headlines across the United States. Military women and men have brought to light the lack of justice for victims of sexual assault, and the prevalence of such attacks. Questions arise as to why victims do not report incidents or seek assistance when they are physically or sexually assaulted. Many reasons are due to how the system of reporting is established within the military, retaliation and further re-victimization within the chain of command. Modifications to the current system have begun within the Department of Defense and\n\nJ.D Student, Stella Cernak, in her excerpt in the Michigan Journal of Gender & Law, discusses recent media attention of intra-military sexual assault and rape in the United States Armed Forces. Cernak’s purpose is to bring awareness of the nature of gender crimes in the military. Not only in the U.S but all armed forces worldwide. She adopts an informative tone to bring clarity and awareness to the audience reading. She uses real life examples and cases that will trigger the readers to see that she understands what they are going through in hopes of victims to continue their fight for a change.\n\nIn more than just the examples given in the documentary, reporting a sexual assault seems almost baffling in terms of procedure, both in military life and in civilian. It is a difficult enough prosses for a man or women to endure in civilian life. Just noting what I have witnessed in my time here at Georgia Southern University, it is a long, horrifying, and complex means to achieve justice, and even then, it is certainly not guaranteed. Even at the conclusion of this class, it is still difficult to grasp the blatant disregard for an entire section of the armed forces. The ones who are willing to make the huge personal sacrifices to serve their own country, when that same courtesy would never be reciprocated. As stated multiple times in The\n\nIt summarized data from many different sources, and provided statistics for many different aspects of sexual assault. Some main points included the prevalence of assault, the effects on victims, and particular risk factors for being sexually assaulted within the military. The article gave chilling statistics, such as up to 31% of women in the military receive unwanted sexual attention. This article shows how the power relationships between men and women extend to even the most honorable positions held in society. The fact that sexual assault and harassment is so common in the military just further deters women away from holding admirable, brave occupations. The fear of being sexually assaulted can discourage women from joining and further perpetuate the mentality of women being\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss the issue of rape and sexual assault in the military. The number of attacks for rape and sexual assault in the military are at an all-time high. Women have recently been allowed to fight on the front line. While this may be a huge achievement for women-kind, for this woman, it is a very scary thought. I am a junior at Texas Academy of Biomedical Sciences; a school geared towards students wishing to enter the medical field. I may be forced to join the military one day if a war breaks out and women are needed to protect the country. I would be happy to serve my country if I did not have to be scared of my fellow soldiers. Rape and sexual assault are major issues in the military and\n\nThe United States military continues to be one of the most powerful forces in the world. Although the characteristics of the United States military has changed throughout the course of time. Traditionally the military was dominated by men until women were given the opportunity to serve their country. However, there is an ongoing problem with sexual assault against women in the United States military. Sexual assault in the military has skyrocketed throughout the years and many of these cases are never reported.\n\nMany people have gone after those involved with the creation of the documentary and those who used it as a platform to tell their stories. The argument is that testimonies of victims are inaccurate and that facts have been misrepresented. However, the filmmakers were adamant about including statistics to support their claims. As someone heading to college that seemed to be one of the scarier sides of the documentary. However, as scary as it is, it is important to stay educated about the subject and have a deep understanding of what's going on behind the cover-up that college administrations have put up. Many high school students are not aware of the reality of the statistics, not because they are naive, rather because of the lack of reporting or the lack of attention given to a case. According to the documentary, one in every five women are sexually assaulted in college, 27.7% of female college seniors have experienced unwanted sex, and as of today, 11.5% enrolled students have been raped. If this matter is not taken more seriously, 100,000 students will be sexually assaulted in the next academic year. These are critical statistics because most students probably believe that it will never be them. However, this is proof that it can be anyone, no matter who it is, it is the thing that you will expect the least.\n\nThroughout the world, deviant acts and social controls are committed everyday. An incredibly significant one that is often unreported is sexual assault within the military. Sexual assault is already determined as an extremely deviant act throughout the world. All acts of rape and other abusive acts should never be dismissed or ignored, but rape within the military is often not reported or recognized. If it is brought to light, the victims are generally in fear of losing their positions, rankings, homes, relationships with their spouses and families, etc…. This is not to state that men are not also victims of sexual assault, but women are much more prone and vulnerable to being attacked and harassed. I will be focusing on the female victims of military assault in this paper.\n\nEven with the few meek attempts being made to stop the sex crimes in the United States Armed Forces, the truth is still that there is a cover up of enormous proportion in progress. No woman is totally secure. Everybody from women in the military to young women on the streets are vulnerable to this horrendous crime spree that has been going on for the past several years in the military. The worst part of this abuse is the fact that any women that are abused usually see their pursuers released with practically no penalty to them whatsoever, and it is very rare to see a woman's pursuer convicted.\n\nSixteen of these twenty will be prosecuted, but only ten will result in conviction” (Shen). Of all rape reports, only 10 percent end in conviction. Therefore, if a false accusation, which already has a low probability of occurring, is made, it then only has a 10 percent chance of being convicted. This 10 percent chance is likely even lower, as if the case is properly investigated, a false accusation will not end in a conviction. False accusations are not the problem in society, but rather sexual assault. Underreporting, paired with the increase in rape, demonstrates the growing urgency to deal with the problem of sexual assault before it gets out of hand. Although false accusations of rape are without a doubt a problem, they are in no way as big as the growing problem of rape in our society. False accusations should not be society’s main concern, but rather the number of sexual assaults which occur. In the military alone, sexual assault has grown, with “about 3,000 service members reporting being sexually assaulted in 2012, but a confidential Department of Defense survey suggests the figure is closer to 26,000 — up 35 percent over 2010” (Koons). These numbers may even be"
