        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nA new documentary by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Kirby Dick attempts to shed light on what's becoming known as America's best kept secret: the epidemic of rape in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by a 2007 Salon story by journalist Helen Benedict, \"The Invisible War\" tells the stories of both female and male servicemembers who were raped by their peers and commanders. In most cases the military did nothing to prosecute the perpetrators and in some cases actually punished the victims.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThese are some of the staggering statistics revealed in the film (all sources come from U.S. government studies):\n\nAn estimated 500,000 men and women in the military have been sexually assaulted since WWII\n\nIn 2009, an estimated 20,000 men were victims of military sexual assault\n\nProsecution rates are extremely low: in 2011, officials received more than 3,000 reports of sexual assault and less than 200 military members were convicted\n\nAn estimated 15 percent of recruits attempted or committed rape before entering service—which is double the rate in civilian society\n\nTwenty-five percent of women didn't report an incident because their commander was their rapist\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta watched the film on April 14. Two days later he ordered that sexual assault investigations be moved to a higher ranking colonel. He also announced that each branch of the armed forces would establish a Special Victims Unit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film opens nationally on June 22.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeaman Kori Cioca was raped by a commanding officer in the Coast Guard in 2005. He hit her in the face and broke her jaw. When she went to get treatment, she was refused because the officials \"didn't want to cause trouble.\"\n\nCioca was told if she went forward with the case she'd be court-martialed for lying. Her husband who was also in the Coast Guard, gave it up for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe now suffers PTSD and nerve damage to her face. There are no longer discs where they should be in her jaw but the VA won't pay for surgery citing that she fell two months short of completing two years of service.\n\nCioca carries with her this knife and cross. She wakes up in the middle of the night screaming as she relives her attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriana Klay was a 1st Lieutenant in the USMC, stationed at the prestigious Marine Barracks in Washington D.C. She was assaulted by a senior officer and her civilian boss; she charges that the Marine Corps said she must have welcomed the attacks because she wore makeup and skirts, which were part of her regulation uniform.\n\nElle Helmer was also raped at the Marine Barracks in D.C. She recounts a culture of mandatory drinking and rampant harassment. Of the five cases of sexual assault at Marine Corps Barracks, four of the women were investigated or punished; none of the officers who were the assailants were court-martialed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2009, Deputy Defense Undersecretary Michael Dominguez testified before the House Oversight Subcommittee on sexual assault in the military. He says that he told Dr. Kaye Whitley, the director of the Sexual Assault and Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) not to attend the hearing, which prompts allegations of a coverup.\n\nRep. Waxman fires at Dominguez: \"The Department of Defense has a history of covering up sexual offense problems. We all remember Tailhook and the scandal and how the military tried to cover that up. I don't know what you're trying to cover up here but we're not going to allow it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the film, former SAPRO Director Dr. Kaye Whitley is asked what methods of risk reduction she advocates to prevent sexual assault in the military, she responds that they tell women to have a buddy. The filmmakers ask if she knows of any other methods and she says, no. Under Whitley, SAPRO ran awareness campaign posters which read, \"Don't risk it . . . wait until she's sober.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011, lawyer Susan Burke brought a lawsuit against former Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates for a system of depriving victims of their constitutional rights.The lawsuit was dismissed based on the ruling that rape is an occupational hazard. She's filed another lawsuit; Cioca, Helmer, Klay are among the plaintiffs.\n\nThis Marine was raped by a F-18 Navigator and the military did nothing\n\nRead the story of how she overcame her assault and went on to advise General Patraeus in Afghanistan >\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
