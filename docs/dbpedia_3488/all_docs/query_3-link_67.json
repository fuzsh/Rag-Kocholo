        "text": "The third Oscar-nominated documentary I had the pleasure of watching is The Invisible War. Filmmaker Kirby Dick (This Film is Not Yet Rated, Outrage) is a genius storyteller. Dick crafts his films so brilliantly, the editing is so tight, so deliberate. Even with a difficult subject, it’s a pleasure to watch his films. Which helps in the case of The Invisible War because this is an extremely difficult subject to witness. The Invisible War investigates the increased incident of rape in the military and the system that allows the perpetrators to continue to target both women and men in sexual assault. The statistics are staggering. From the companion website, NotInvisible.org,\n\nWhile the Department of Defense claims to have a “Zero Tolerance Policy,” the numbers of sexual assault occurrences within the U.S. military have continued to rise.\n\nSince 2006, more than 95,000 service members have been sexually assaulted in the U.S. military\n\nMore than 86% of service members do not report their assault\n\nLess than five percent of all sexual assaults are put forward for prosecution, and less than a third of those cases result in imprisonment\n\nReel Charlie’s got a category called “must-see” which I use whenever I believe a film is worthy of a large cross-section of the population checking it out. To call The Invisible War a must-see doesn’t even begin to describe the importance of this film and the bravery of the women and men who have come forward to tell their story. Take a deep breath and spend an evening exploring this subject. It’s time to end the violence of rape and assault in our culture and we need everyone in our society to do what they can. A 5 out of 5 for Kirby Dick’s latest, The Invisible War.\n\nExplore the film’s companion website and learn how you can get involved."
