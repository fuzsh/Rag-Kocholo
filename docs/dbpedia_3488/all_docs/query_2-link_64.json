        "text": "THE SCREEN CREDIT GALLERY: Her Name in Lights\n\nTHE SCREEN CREDIT GALLERY:\n\nHer Name in Lights\n\nEditors were almost never given front screen credit until the 1960’s when some editors (like Dede Allen) did such remarkable work that it wasn’t possible to continue relegating their contribution to the back end of the film. Consequently, I created a CUT TO page about getting credit where credit is due.\n\nLater on, I had to find screen credits for Françoise Collin because there are no available photographs of her.\n\nAnd there are some who dispute the centrality of Elizaveta Svilova’s role in the making of Man with a Movie Camera, perhaps in part due to her screen credit (authored by Vertov?).\n\nAnd while doing another CUT TO section, I discovered that many of the films directed by Jean Rouch have no on-screen credits, so I found ones which named each of the seventeen women editors who collaborated with him.\n\nFinally, while doing another CUT TO section about the women who collaborated with the Maysles, I made a page of screen credits about the films they directed independently of their work with the brothers.\n\nBut why stop there?\n\nI loved seeing their names on the big screen, so I created this gallery to showcase many more.\n\nA few notes:\n\n—I haven’t distinguished between front and back screen credits.\n\n—The screen credits are listed alphabetically by the last name of the editor (or in the case of multiple editors, then it’s by the first woman of the team.)\n\n—These are only for the “Main Editors” because a screen credit for the “Filmmakers who Edit” is implicit; we know their names as the makers/directors….\n\n—This page is ever-expanding. I will be adding more, and if you send me a high-res screenshot of one from your favorite film by one of the editors on the website, along with the caption info, I’ll add it in."
