        "text": "Her previous film, The Invisible War, a groundbreaking investigation into the epidemic of rape in the U.S. military, won the Audience Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, won two 2014 Emmy Awards for Best Documentary and Outstanding Investigative Journalism and was nominated for an Oscar. The film spurred Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta to announce significant policy changes and catalyzed the passing of 35 pieces of reform legislation. She is also the Producer of Outrage — an indictment of the hypocrisy of powerful, closeted politicians and the institutions that protect them, which received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Investigative Journalism.\n\nZiering also co-directed and produced Derrida, a documentary about the world-renowned French philosopher. Ziering also executive produced Kirsten Johnson’s award winning and Oscar shortlisted CameraPerson, and Josh Fox’s Awake - A Dream from Standing Rock."
