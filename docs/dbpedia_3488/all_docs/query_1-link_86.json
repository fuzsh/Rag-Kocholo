        "text": "Screening of the film The Invisible War\n\nAbout ‘The Invisible War’:\n\nFrom Oscar®- and Emmy®-nominated filmmaker Kirby Dick (This Film Is Not Yet Rated; Twist of Faith) comes The Invisible War, a groundbreaking investigative documentary about one of America’s most shameful and best kept secrets: the epidemic of rape within the U.S. military. The film paints a startling picture of the extent of the problem – today, a female soldier in combat zones is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. The Department of Defense estimates there were a staggering 19,000 violent sex crimes in the military in 2010. The Invisible War exposes the epidemic, breaking open one of the most under-reported stories of our generation, to the nation and the world.\n\nDetails about the film and trailer here: http://invisiblewarmovie.com/\n\nAmy Ziering is an Emmy nominated and award-winning Los Angeles producer and director. Her most recent film, OUTRAGE, was produced and distributed by Magnolia Pictures and had its television premiere on HBO. Ziering’s previous release, THE MEMORY THIEF, which she produced, stars Mark Webber and Jerry Adler and is a thought provoking examination of the relationship between empathy, narcissism, and trauma. It was NYTIMES critics pick and won several festival awards.\n\nZiering also co-directed and produced DERRIDA, a documentary about the world-renowned French philosopher and the philosophical movement known as deconstruction. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, won the Golden Gate award at the San Francisco Film Festival, and was released theatrically by Zeitgeist Films. Ziering also produced Richard Cohen’s critically acclaimed TAYLOR’S CAMPAIGN, a documentary about Ron Taylor, a homeless person who ran for a seat on the Santa Monica City Council. Prior to becoming a filmmaker, Ziering taught literature and film at Yale University and Bennington College.\n\nEvent co-sponsored by The Difference and Media Project, Gender and Sexuality Studies, BRAVE, and Center for Civic Engagement."
