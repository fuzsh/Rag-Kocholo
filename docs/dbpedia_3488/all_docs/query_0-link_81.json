Focusing on the powerful stories of several young veterans, the film is a moving examination of the staggering personal and societal costs of these assaults.\n\nMeticulously researched, the film reveals that hundreds of thousands of service members have been assaulted over the past several decades, with nearly half of those assaulted being male. Combining interviews with high-ranking military officials and members of Congress with the devastating testimony of veterans, the film catalogues the conditions that have protected perpetrators and allowed this epidemic to continue.\n\nBoth a comprehensive inquiry and an insight into what can be done to bring about much-needed change, The Invisible War urges us all, civilian and military alike, to fight for a system that protects our men and women in uniform.\n\nPart of Philanthropy New York's Documentary Series.\n\nThis program is \"Mostly Open.\"\n\nDesigned for\n\nFunders, nonprofit colleagues and other friends are invited to this reception, film screening and panel discussion. All are welcome!"
