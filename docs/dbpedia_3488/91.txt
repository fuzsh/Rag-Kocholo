On June 27, Director Kirby Dick’s provocative documentary, The Invisible War, was screened for DGA members at the Guild’s Los Angeles Theater.

Seeking to expose one of our country’s most shameful secrets, the epidemic of rape in the U.S. military, The Invisible War focuses on the fight for justice by several military women and features interviews with high-ranking officials and members of Congress to reveal the perfect storm of the conditions and the systemic cover-up of these crimes.

After an introduction by Special Projects Committee Member Victoria Hochberg, Director Kirby Dick sat down with Director Amy Berg (Deliver Us from Evil, West of Memphis) for a discussion about the making of The Invisible War.

Kirby Dick’s other films include This Film is Not Yet Rated, an exposé about the American movie ratings board; the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize-winning Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist; the Emmy Award-nominated Outrage, about the hypocrisy of powerful, closeted politicians and the political and media institutions that protect them; and the Academy Award-nominated Twist of Faith, about a man confronting the trauma of having been sexually abused as by a Catholic priest as a boy.

He has been a DGA member since 2010.
