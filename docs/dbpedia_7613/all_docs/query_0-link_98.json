By bidding at auction, you agree to be bound by these Conditions of Sale.\n\nPrior to the Sale\n\nAll items (hereinafter referred to as item(s), lot(s), article(s), antique(s), property, etc.) for sale are sold “AS IS” and Matthew Bullock Auctioneers its agents, employees, and/or consignors do not make any guarantees, warranties, or representations, expressed or implied, with respect to the items or the correctness of the catalog or other description of the authenticity of authorship, physical condition, size, quality, rarity, importance, provenance, exhibitions, literature or historical relevance of the property or otherwise, except where applicable under the Terms of Guarantee (applies ONLY to published catalog auctions, NOT Online Only Auctions). No statement anywhere, whether oral or written, shall be deemed such a guarantee, warranty, or representation.\n\nPLEASE NOTE ALL SHELF LOTS, GROUP LOTS AND BOX LOTS WE GIVE NO GUARANTEE AS TO CONDITION; SOME ITEMS MAY HAVE CHIPS OR CRACKS NOT NOTED IN THE DESCRIPTION. YOU ARE BUYING THESE LOTS AS IS!!!!\n\nAll prospective bidders should inspect the property they wish to purchase prior to bidding. If a bidder is unable to view an item in person, they are responsible for obtaining a condition report and/or additional photographs prior to bidding to determine an article’s condition, size, and degree of restoration. We endeavor to be fair and forthright with our descriptions and condition reports; however, bidders must acknowledge that antique items often show normal signs of use and wear, which might not be specified in a condition report. If you are a very particular client with expectations of perfection for the items you purchase, it is advisable that you inspect items in person or that you do not submit absentee bids as your definition of condition may be more exacting than an appraiser could have time to verify. The absence of a condition report does not imply that the lot is in good condition. Matthew Bullock Auctioneers reserves the right to reject any request for a condition report/additional photograph in which, in our opinion, the value of the object is not commensurate with the time necessary to complete the request. Please also note that the warranties given by Matthew Bullock Auctioneers (applies to published/printed catalog auctions only), do not extend to the condition reports. Weights and measurements are approximate. Matthew Bullock Auctioneers does not guarantee clocks, watches, mechanical banks, scientific instruments, electric lamps, and other mechanical or electric items to be complete or in working condition. Display materials shown in photographs are not included with the lot unless stated in the description. Box lots (i.e., books) are only guaranteed to have those items listed in the description and no condition reports or additional photographs will be provided.\n\nAt the Sale\n\nRegistration Before Bidding - A prospective buyer must complete and sign a registration form and provide identification before bidding. We may require bank or other financial references. Matthew Bullock Auctioneers., is under no obligation to approve the registration of any prospective registrant.\n\nBidding as Principal - When making a bid, a bidder is accepting personal liability to pay the purchase price, including the buyer's premium, all applicable taxes and all other applicable charges, unless it has been explicitly agreed upon in writing with Matthew Bullock Auctioneers before the commencement of the sale that the bidder is acting as agent on behalf of an identified third party acceptable to Matthew Bullock Auctioneers, and that Matthew Bullock Auctioneers will only look to the principal for payment.\n\nAbsentee Bids - Matthew Bullock Auctioneers will use reasonable efforts to carry out written bids given to us prior to the sale for the convenience of clients who are not present at the auction in person. Bids must be placed in U.S. dollars. If we receive written bids on a particular lot for identical amounts, and these are the highest bids on the lot at the auction, it will be sold to the person whose written bid was received and accepted first.

All telephone bids must be at least $250, start at half of the low reserve or 10% above the current online bid.\n\nOnline Bids - We will use reasonable efforts to carry out online bids and do not accept liability for equipment failure, inability to access the internet or software malfunctions related to the execution of online bids.

The reserve will not exceed the low estimate of the lot. Reserves are agreed upon with consignors or, in the absence thereof, the absolute discretion of Matthew Bullock Auctioneers The auctioneer may open the bidding on any lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the seller. The auctioneer may continue to bid on behalf of the seller up to the amount of the reserve, either by placing consecutive bids or by placing bids in response to other bidders. With respect to lots that are offered without reserve, unless there are already competing bids, the auctioneer, at his or her discretion, will generally open the bidding at half of the low estimate for the lot. In the absence of a bid at that level, the auctioneer may proceed backward at his or her discretion until a bid is recognized, and then continue up from that amount.\n\nAuctioneer's Discretion - The auctioneer has the right at his or her absolute and sole discretion to refuse any bid, to advance the bidding in such a manner as he or she may decide, to withdraw any lot, and in the case of error or dispute, and whether during or after the sale, to determine the successful bidder, to continue the bidding, to cancel the sale or to re-offer and resell the item in dispute. If any dispute arises after the sale, our sale record is conclusive.\n\nSuccessful Bid - The highest bidder acknowledged by the auctioneer will be the purchaser. In the case of a tie bid, the winning bidder will be determined by the auctioneer at his or her sole discretion. In the event of a dispute between bidders, the auctioneer has final discretion to determine the successful bidder or to re-offer the lot in dispute. If any dispute arises after the sale, the Matthew Bullock Auctioneers sale record shall be conclusive. Title passes upon the fall of the auctioneer's hammer to the highest acknowledged bidder subject to the Conditions of Sale set forth herein, and the bidder assumes full risk and responsibility.\n\nLiability\n\nCondition Reports - Matthew Bullock Auctioneers is not responsible for the correctness of any statement of any kind concerning any lot, whether written or oral nor for any other errors or omissions in description or for any faults or defects in any lot.

Except as required by local law any warranty of any kind whatsoever is excluded by this paragraph.\n\nPurchased Lots - If for any reason a purchased lot cannot be delivered in the same condition as at the time of sale, or should any purchased lot be stolen, miss-delivered, or lost prior to delivery, Matthew Bullock Auctioneers shall not be liable for any amount more than that paid by the purchaser.\n\nLegal Ramifications - The rights and obligations of the parties with respect to these Conditions of Sale, the conduct of the auction, and any matters connected with any of the foregoing shall be governed and interpreted by the laws of the jurisdiction in Illinois. If any part of these Conditions of Sale is found by any court to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that part shall be discounted, and the rest of the conditions shall continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law."
