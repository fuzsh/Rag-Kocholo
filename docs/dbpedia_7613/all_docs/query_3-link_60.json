        "text": "Moulin Rouge dancer Mistinguett and singer Maurice Chevalier struck up a legendary relationship on-stage and off – but it was one that almost proved fatal. Chloe Govan reveals all…\n\nMistinguett was once the highest paid entertainer in the world: she insured her trademark legs for half a million francs and was a household name across France. Her relationship with onstage partner Maurice Chevalier became legendary as the pair, who had a 15-year-age gap, embarked on a dangerous love affair that led both to question their own mortality.\n\nIt all began in 1873 when Mistinguett was born Jeanne Florentine Bourgeois to a modestly paid labourer father and painstakingly hard-working seamstress mother. Her rags to riches journey began in a Paris suburb – the spa district of Enghien-les- Bains (which featured in the movie Amélie). Filled with lakeside idylls and thermal baths renowned for their healing properties, it was where wealthy but weary city dwellers came for a rejuvenating holiday. One day, the area would be filled with some of the glitziest casinos in all of France but nothing like that existed in Mistinguett’s childhood.\n\nUndeterred, he attempted to compensate for his poor singing by weaving comedy into his performances. The bawdy sense of humour of a boy who was described at the time as “awkward and unsophisticated” was adored by some of the working class revellers, but sneered at by many of the more upper-class patrons. Chevalier, by his own admission, had “no voice” at the time – merely a series of lewd jokes. Yet, driven by his desire to escape poverty, he swallowed his pride and determined to do his best.\n\nWith time, he began to improve and later he actually saw his initial lack of ability as a blessing. “Thank God, it was my good luck not to have any voice,” he declared earnestly in the New York Times. “It made me look for something to make me different from a hundred other crooners who are neither good nor bad.”\n\nThat something would, in part, be given a helping hand by the sizzling chemistry he shared with Mistinguett, by now an established dancer 15 years his senior. She too had been building up a reputation at venues such as Eldorado and the Moulin Rouge. After Maurice turned 21, they were cast together in a revue at the Folies Bergère. The show saw them rolled up together in a carpet and sensationally unravelled before the audience. Their energetic singing, dancing, somersaulting routine was an instant hit with the crowds.\n\nHowever, it was rumoured that there was more going on beneath the rolls of carpet than met the eye, with Mistinguett indulging in some mischievous groping, transforming their relationship from professional to personal in the blink of an eye. As a single mother in her 30s with a young son to care for, Mistinguett had more responsibilities and burdens to bear than Chevalier did, yet they became closer than either could have imagined. After he reportedly warded off her ex in a street fight, the pair officially became lovers.\n\nFor several years, the glamorous duo enjoyed their new status as highly sought after celebrities, but then disaster struck in the form of the First World War. Chevalier, who was part way through his National Service, found himself on the front line.\n\nLater recounting his memoirs to journalist Percy Cudlipp, he lamented that the conflict had meant “putting aside” his stage ambitions for a while. “When we went into the trenches, there was no more singing or dancing,” he recalled gravely. “One by one, my friends were killed or wounded – and I was beginning to think myself a very lucky fellow to remain unscathed.”\n\nThat stroke of luck didn’t last long, however. He was soon hit by an exploding shrapnel shell, which punctured his lung and left him seriously wounded. As fate would have it, within hours of the attack, the Germans gained a stronghold on the local area, ruthlessly capturing any soldier too injured to move – and that included Chevalier. His frustration was palpable. He’d come an extraordinarily long way, from a young penniless boy whose employers had disparagingly sneered at him and branded him a ‘titi’ to a highly paid and respected performer. Yet now, wounded and captured, with blood pouring from his mouth, it seemed all was lost.\n\nThe Trauma of War\n\nChevalier was hauled off to a prisoner of war camp, where he spent two years and four months. Undaunted, Mistinguett stepped in to save the day – a risky manoeuvre that almost proved fatal for them both. She embarked on a perilous rescue mission to save her man, but ended up walking a tight-rope between two warring countries.\n\nDuring her deadly, dangerous escapades, she secretly offered her services as a spy to both France and Germany – and ended up almost being executed by both. The French detained her and threatened to kill her after she was mistakenly identified as Mata Hari, and after she’d wriggled her way out of that one, her fake collaboration with the Germans almost saw her meet her untimely death too."
