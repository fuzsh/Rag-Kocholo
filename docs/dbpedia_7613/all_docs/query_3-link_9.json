        "text": "Maurice Chevalier is an American born actor and producer. The most recent speaking roles of his are with both Luke Goss and Michael Paré in Operator - Wettlauf gegen die Zeit (2015), Gregory Alan Williams in Unspoken Words (2014), and as Aaron in the award-sweeping Sanity (2014). He was born to Margaret Chevalier and Maurice Chevalier in Detroit, Michigan. His background is German, Scottish, French, Lithuanian, Cherokee Indian, and Canadian. While fully involved in acting throughout his early years, Maurice was introduced to the world of entertainment and television through modeling. He quickly made NYC his home while working for clients such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Just Cavali. Hundreds of runway shows for Gucci, D&G and Christian Dior, to name a few, complete his credentials alongside editorials for Cosmopolitan, Maxim, and Redbook. Maurice has also performed in commercials across the United States and in Europe and Asia. In-between working in Greece, Italy, Japan, Taipae, Hong Kong, and China, he focused on acting workshops in Manhattan. This opened doors to nearly every type of film and theatre work; including voice-overs, pilots, short films and features, commercials, industrials, and spokesperson campaigns. Playing Josh in the award-winning Ansley Park Playhouse's production, A Sunday Afternoon at Loehmann's, and speaking in national television commercials for Ford Trucks provided a solid platform for him. Acting grew into many other opportunities. Working with Wes Llewellyn and Amanda Llewellyn as a producer for the show, It's Supernatural (1996), a popular Christian television show seen in over 160 countries, helped pave the way for several production-based accolades. Teaming up with other award-winning productions furthered his progression with the success of Tragically Beautiful (2014), a film that landed them Best Picture. Most recently, Maurice's team was commended with 9 awards total, including Top 5 Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Cinematography at the CMF Awards in Hollywood, CA for their films Sanity (2014) and Music Therapy (2014)."
