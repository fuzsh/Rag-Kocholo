        "text": "The Athenaeum’s popular film series, Flicks on the Bricks, returns in August for its 16th year with The Lubitsch Touch, a trio of effervescent films from Ernst Lubitsch, curated by Beth Accomando, KPBS arts reporter and host of the Cinema Junkie podcast. Guests are invited to join us on the outdoor patio for balmy summer nights and screenings of classic cinema al fresco.\n\n“Girls are checking up on MAURICE CHEVALIER—and finding him cute and sweet” (Print ad—Sunday Tribune, ((Manila, P.I.)) 19 June 1932)\n\nAn unhappily married couple try to come between a happy one.\n\nAndré and Colette Bertier are happily married. But Mitzi, an old school chum of Colette's, resurfaces out of the blue. As her marriage is on the rocks she has no better idea than to seduce André. André tries hard to resist but what could he do with that Mitzi? Colette decides to be revenged thanks to Adolph, André's friend, who yearns for her.\n\nMaurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald are captivating in this sparkling marital comedy enhanced by lilting tunes and the magical Lubitsch touch.\n\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 18 minutes\n\nCast: Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, and Genevieve Tobin\n\nMemorable Quote:\n\nProfessor Olivier: In Switzerland they have a very peculiar law. When a husband shoots his wife, they put him in jail.\n\nInteresting Trivia:\n\nEven though it was the pre-Hays Code era, it was one of the few films of that time to show a married couple in the same bed together.\n\nNominations:\n\nAcademy Awards, USA 1932: Best Picture\n\nINDIVIDUAL FILMS:\n\n$15 member / $20 nonmember\n\nSERIES OF 3 FILMS:\n\n$39 member / $54 nonmember\n\nThe films will be shown in person and outdoors on the Athenaeum Music & Arts Library patio. There are no physical tickets for these events. Your name will be on an attendee list at the front door. Doors open at 7:30 p.m. Seating is first-come; first-served. Priority seating will be given to Donor level members and above.\n\nThese events will be presented in compliance with State of California and County of San Diego health regulations as applicable at the time of each concert. Masks are optional.\n\n*Covid-19 policy special procedure: Due to the outside nature of this event, we will not be checking vaccination status or negative test."
