        "text": "Maurice Chevalier (born September 12, 1888, Paris, France—died January 1, 1972, Paris) was a debonair French musical-comedy star and entertainer who was known for witty and sophisticated films that contributed greatly to the establishment of the musical as a film genre during the early 1930s. His suave manner and half-speaking style of singing, together with his trademark tilted straw hat and a possibly exaggerated French accent, gained him international fame as a stage personality, and he became known as “the most popular Frenchman in the world.”\n\nChevalier grew up in a struggling working-class family. He lacked interest in the trades, however, and made his debut as a Parisian café singer in 1901. At the beginning of World War I he was called up for military service. Chevalier was wounded and captured in his first engagement and spent 26 months in a German prisoner-of-war camp, during which time he learned English from a fellow POW. Following the war, he returned to what was already a thriving career.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nBy the 1920s Chevalier was a famous entertainer in French musical revues and was appearing in French films. He starred in the operetta Dédé in Paris in 1921 and made his first appearance in the United States when the show was later brought to New York City. In 1928 a producer invited him to appear in American movies. His first Hollywood film, The Innocents of Paris (1929), was the prototype of the popular gay and charming musicals that followed, in which he often costarred with Jeanette MacDonald—e.g., The Love Parade (1930), One Hour with You (1932), Love Me Tonight (1932), and The Merry Widow (1934).\n\nChevalier returned to Paris in 1935. During World War II he continued to tour in the unoccupied areas of France but performed twice in Paris and once for French prisoners in a German camp (in exchange for the release of several POWs). He was denounced as a collaborationist, but his name was soon cleared, and he resumed his career in France. His popularity in the United States suffered for much longer, however, though he did have a successful North American tour in 1947."
