        "text": "Q: I watched \"White Christmas\" starring Bing Crosby the other night, which prompted me to wonder what became of his four boys from his first marriage. Did one or more inherit his singing voice?\n\nA: According to the official website bingcrosby.com, Bing had seven children: Gary, twins Dennis and Philip, and Lindsay from his first marriage to Dixie Lee Crosby (who died of cancer in 1952), and Harry, Mary and Nathaniel from his second marriage, to Kathryn Grant Crosby, still with him when Bing died in 1977.\n\nDixie's four sons all tried out singing at various times, including as the Crosby Boys; Gary, later an actor on TV shows such as \"Adam-12,\" had several hit singles in the early '50s. But none achieved the success of their father. Indeed, life proved difficult for them, with the website saying each \"constantly struggled with alcoholism and had embarrassing scrapes with the law.\" Gary wrote a memoir claiming that Bing had been an excessively strict parent but, according to the website, he did so to improve sales and later recanted \"large portions\" of the book. Gary was hoping to revive his career by overdubbing some of Bing's recordings when he discovered he had cancer and died in 1995. By that time, both Lindsay and Dennis had committed suicide, in 1989 and 1991 respectively; Philip died in 2004 at the age of 69.\n\nFor more about Bing and his family, including his other three children, see bingcrosby.com.\n\nQ: I remember visiting my grandparents during holidays. Though I can't remember a specific holiday, my grandfather always had an old black-and-white movie on about giant rabbits or bunnies destroying towns and knocking down power lines and eating people. It looks like it might be from the '30s, '40s or '50s. Though this movie terrified me as a child, looking back now it seems kinda corny. I would like to know the name of the movie please and why anybody would find giant rabbits scary.\n\nA: There do not appear to be many giant-rabbit movies. In fact, the only one I could find was \"Night of the Lepus,\" a 1972 color feature starring Stuart Whitman, Janet Leigh and others. If readers know of another film, let me know and I will discuss it in a later mailbag.\n\nQ: Some years ago there was a made-for-TV movie called \"Pop Rocks.\" Was this ever put out on DVD and if so where can I obtain a copy?\n\nA: The movie starring Gary Cole originally aired on ABC Family in 2004. It involves a former rocker turned family man who thinks about going back onstage to earn tuition money for his kids — who don't know about their dad's former life. But I do not know of an authorized release of the movie on home video.\n\nQ: I caught only the last half-hour or so of the following movies and hope you can identify them. In one, Charles Boyer is the friend of the aging Maurice Chevalier, who weds a young girl to save her from the scorn of the villagers when she has a son out of wedlock. The other has Paulette Goddard and Charlie Chaplin; the ending depicts Chaplin speaking — presumably to a crowd — and his speech resonates with Goddard, who is in a field.\n\nA: The first is \"Fanny,\" a 1961 film starring Leslie Caron as the young woman. As for the other, Goddard and Chaplin were married for about a decade and made two films together, \"Modern Times\" (1936) and \"The Great Dictator\" (1940). The scene you remember is from the end of \"The Great Dictator.\""
