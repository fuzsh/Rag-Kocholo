        "text": "Army rebels are in control of Portugal tonight after an almost bloodless dawn coup ended nearly 50 years of dictatorship.\n\nShortly after midnight, tanks rolled into the centre of Lisbon. The Salazar Bridge over the River Tagus was seized and the airport, radio and television centres were taken.\n\nTroops armed with machineguns stormed the barracks where the Prime Minister, Dr Marcello Caetano, and several of his ministers had taken refuge.\n\nThe former deputy armed forces minister, General Antoniio de Spinola, received the surrender of the prime minister, who has now fled into exile to the Portuguese island of Madeira.\n\nRestore civil liberties\n\nBy sunrise the Movement of the Armed Forces, or MFA, was in control. It issued an immediate proclamation appealing for calm and patriotism.\n\nAfter almost five decades of dictatorship, it promised to restore civil liberties and hold general elections to a national assembly as soon as possible.\n\nThe MFA condemned Portugal's foreign policy. After 13 years of fighting, it said, Portugal had been unable to achieve peace \"between Portuguese of all races and creeds\".\n\nIt also called for a clean-up of state-run institutions which had legitimised the abuse of power.\n\nA seven-man junta, led by General Spinola, would oversee the transition period until democracy could be established.\n\nGeneral Spinola and his troops received a hero's welcome from crowds, who gave them cigarettes, food, newspapers and carnations which were in full bloom at the time.\n\nIn one violent outburst, up to six civilians were killed after shots were fired from the headquarters of the police station - and troops responded by storming the building.\n\nThe Democratic Elections Commission group, which contested last year's parliamentary elections against the Government, issued a statement today saying that the group considered as positive \"an act which could lead to the overthrow of a regime which for 50 years has oppressed the people of Portugal.\"\n\nThe majority of Portuguese troops, nearly 140,000 out of 204,000, are posted overseas, propping up Portugal's tottering colonial empire in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique.\n\nGeneral Spinola was sacked from his job as deputy armed forces minister last month after writing a book, Portugal and the Future, in which he argued that the Portuguese could not win its African wars by military means alone.\n\nHe was Governor and Commander in Chief of Portuguese Guinea between 1968 and 1972 and was widely respected for trying to win over the hearts and minds of the local population.\n\nHis book was regarded as heretical by the country's right-wing establishment - in particular his stated claim that Portugal was not defending the West and its civilization by colonising African states."
