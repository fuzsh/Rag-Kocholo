        "text": "The final terms that dictated the Public Prosecution Service organisation and the powers were set forth by Decree No. 24 dated 16 May 1832 ‑ the so-called «decree on the reform of the justices» signed in Ponta Delgada by the regent D. Pedro, duke of Bragança, on behalf of Queen D. Maria II.\n\nMouzinho da Silveira, Minister and Secretary of State for Justice Affairs at the time, was the booster behind this Decree, which represented a fundamental step towards the organization of the Public Prosecution Service.\n\nMouzinho da Silveira set up the Supreme Court of Justice and established the post of Prosecutor General for the Crown at that Court. He further established the posts of Royal Prosecutor at each second instance court and those of Deputy Royal Prosecutor at each first instance chamber. While performing his duties, the Deputy Royal Prosecutor also applied for the Judiciary. An Assistant to the Deputy Royal Prosecutor was appointed for each section, according to the latter’s choice and trust.\n\nThese posts were under the immediate subordination of the Government, and their holders were to be dismissed at the Government’s sole discretion.\n\nFor the first time, the Public Prosecution Service appeared as a hierarchic structure in which the Prosecutor General for the Crown played the core role. This structure was developed by Decree No. 27 dated 19 May 1832, which stated that «the Prosecutor General for the Crown is above the Royal Prosecutors, and he shall be in touch with them and the Government».\n\nThe future consultative powers of the Prosecutor General’s Office were already being outlined: the Prosecutor General for the Crown’s opinion could be requested in writing both by the Government on any affairs it deemed appropriate and by the Chambers on legislative matters. The Prosecutor General for the Crown would also answer before the Chambers when invited to do so.\n\nIn order to grasp the increasing relevance of the consultative duties of the Prosecutor General’s Office it suffices to say that in a letter addressed to the king on 13 September 1908, when noting the convenience of postponing the town elections, José Luciano de Castro stated that such goal could only be attained upon a positive opinion of the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown: «Then I tried to convince Amaral to listen to the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown on this matter; hopefully he will give up his intention when faced with an opinion in favour of the postponing».\n\nIn another letter dated 6 October, while advising Mr. Ferreira do Amaral, president of the Government, José Luciano de Castro further stated that «he had discussed (the matter) with the Prosecutor General for the Crown», i.e. the Justice António Cândido Ribeiro da Costa. «I ended up by asking him (Ferreira do Amaral) to consider the opinion of both the competent directorate general and the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown, as it concerned a matter of law and its interpretation». And further on: «[...] and, after the hearings were closed, doubts had arisen as to the legality of the government’s intervention on this matter. Reason why the competent department and the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown had been heard thereupon and the government had been obliged to follow the opinion of the competent authorities, which helped avert the burden of performing a completely illegal act».\n\nThe Prosecutor General for the Crown, assisted by a Deputy — the embryo of the Consultative Council of the Prosecutor General’s Office —, was also the Government’s Commissioner at the chambers with seat next to the ministers. He also followed up the indictments submitted to the Upper House.\n\nNot only did the Rules of 15 December 1835 specifically provide that the Public Prosecution Service played the main role in the prosecution of public criminal offences, but they also stated that the Public Prosecution Service ought to display an unequivocal unity in the fulfillment of the respective duties. Besides, those Rules confirmed the 1832 provisions on hierarchy.\n\nThese Rules also set forth that, when acting on behalf of the Royal Prosecutor’s Office, each service should keep four books (livros “riscados”), the first of which should contain entries of public crimes against freedom of the press.\n\nBoth the brand-new judicial reform contained in the Decree dated 21 May 1841 and the 1835 Rules reaffirmed the hierarchical structure of the Public Prosecution Service, the Prosecutor General for the Crown being vested in the highest post. According to the Decree, «he shall act within the strictest impartiality in the performance of his duties and pursue the interests of justice while acting as a law enforcement supervisor».\n\nAt that stage, all public Registrars and Notaries were dependent from the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown. Interestingly, remnants of this situation persisted in the territory of Macao for quite a long time ‑ according to the 1976 statute, the registry and notaries services operated under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office of Macao.\n\nThe correspondence to and from the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown was dealt with by the Supreme Court Registrar’s services. However, this situation came to an end with the Decree dated 5 November 1851 which, due to the caseload involved, set up a private registry.\n\nFinally, the Decree dated 12 November 1869 closed this first and relevant process of evolution and growth by entrusting the Prosecutor General for the Crown with the duties previously incumbent on the Prosecutor General for the Treasury. This post had been established by Decree dated 30 December 1836, and its purpose was «the fight for the fair and obvious rights of the Treasury».\n\nThe new post became known as the Prosecutor General for the Crown and Treasury ‑ the highest post of the Public Prosecution Service covering the judicial and administrative fields ‑ and the person holding it became entitled to the assistance of six Deputies. The first Prosecutor General for the Crown and Treasury was Justice Martens Ferrão, one of the most remarkable jurists and public men of his time.\n\nThis new Decree set forth the Prosecutor General’s obligation to hold ordinary meetings with his Deputies twice a month, «in order to submit, discuss and vote issues raised by any of them». The opinion agreed upon should then be followed and sustained in all future replies, opinions or consultations.\n\nShortly thereafter, the duties that had been carried out by the administrative services of the State’s Council were passed on to the Prosecutor General for the Crown and Treasury and his Deputies in compliance with the provisions of a Decree effective from 9 June 1870.\n\nDue to this increase in charges, sixty six meetings took place in the year of 1870 (instead of the previous bimonthly meetings) and eighteen meetings had to be held during the first quarter of 1871. In the course of the year of 1870, the total of lawsuits and official letters that were registered reached the number of 7,158, being 2,637 the number of lawsuits filed for consultation and decision thereupon.\n\nIn 1871, Justice Martens Ferrão submitted a report to the Minister for Justice on all the activities of the Prosecutor General’s Office, in which he proposed, among others, the systematic publication of opinions on important matters of law in relation to which the Government had to take a decision, with a view to improving case-law. This practice is still followed today.\n\nThe Registrar’s services of the Prosecutor General’s Office for the Crown and Treasury were greatly improved with the Rules of 29 December 1876. In fact, a significant impetus was given to their development when they were considered a Government’s high office entrusted with extended functions: from the administration of the Public Prosecution Service to law conflict and consultation issues submitted to the Court of Audits, and also to matters relating to the land registry offices and the Prosecutor General’s Office releases.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic in its original version\n\nTo begin with, the 1976 Constitution of the Portuguese Republic reversed the deep-seated notion that the Public Prosecution Service was a branch of the executive power bound to the government.\n\nIn fact, the new basic law of the democratic Portugal vested the Public Prosecution Service with a statute of autonomy.\n\nSince its very first version the basic law comprised both the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office as a clear sign of their relevance within the political power organisation.\n\nArticles 224, 225 and 226 dealt with the powers and the statute of the Public Prosecution Service, of the Public Prosecutors and of the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nAccording to article 224, the Public Prosecution Service is responsible for representing the State, instituting criminal proceedings, defending the democratic Rule of Law and such interests as laid down by the law (paragraph 1).\n\nThe Public Prosecution Service has its own statute (paragraph 2).\n\nAs regards the staff and the operation of the Public Prosecution Service, paragraph 1 of article 225 states that the Public Prosecutors are accountable magistrates subject to a hierarchy, who may not be transferred, suspended, retired or removed from office unless otherwise provided for by the law.\n\nThe appointment, assignment, transfer and promotion of the Public Prosecutors and the undertaking of disciplinary action are incumbent on the Prosecutor General’s Office (paragraph 2).\n\nIn turn, paragraph 1 of article 226 defined the Prosecutor General’s Office as the highest body of the Public Prosecution Service presided over by the Prosecutor General.\n\nPursuant to its paragraph 2, the rules of organisation and the composition of the Prosecutor General’s Office should be laid down by the law.\n\nThe constitutional layout for the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office would not be completed without reference to the provisions enshrined in the Constitution on the Prosecutor General’s appointment and to other constitutional provisions.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 1 of article 136 the President of the Republic is responsible for the Prosecutor General’s appointment and removal from office.\n\nOther references may be quoted in the scope of the legislative powers of the Assembly of the Republic and of the constitutional monitoring system.\n\nThe first part of article 167(j) provided that it was exclusively incumbent on the Assembly of the Republic to make laws about the organisation and powers of the courts and of the Public Prosecution Service and to draft on the magistrates’ statute.\n\nArticle 281(1) stated that, upon request of the Prosecutor General or other relevant entities, the Council of the Revolution was competent to examine a given rule and to declare its unconstitutionality with binding force, if applicable.\n\nFurthermore, it was stated that once the courts have refused to apply a rule laid down in any law, decree-law, governing decree, regional decree or any similar statutory instrument based upon a matter of unconstitutionality, and recourse to the ordinary appeals have been exhausted, a cost-free appeal shall be lodged so that a final decision on the matter can be reached by the Constitutional Commission. Such an appeal shall be mandatory for the Public Prosecution Service and restricted to the matter of unconstitutionality (paragraph 1 of article 282).\n\nThe appeal lodged against a court decision applying a rule previously deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Commission (paragraph 2) was further deemed mandatory on the Public Prosecution Service.\n\nThe 1982 Constitutional Revision\n\nThe status of both the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office underwent the changes inserted by the legislators through the different revisions to which the wording of the 1976 Constitution was submitted.\n\nBroadly speaking, the core of the original text remained unaltered and unaffected.\n\nRegardless of the variation to which the numbering of the articles was subjected, the 1st Constitutional Revision brought no significant changes to the text.\n\nEven though, one relevant change in article 226(2) should be emphasized.\n\nIn fact, its provisions allowed a relevant body within the Prosecutor General’s Office, though yet unnamed, to be enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nThe new paragraph 2 stated as follows:\n\nThe law sets out the rules for the organisation and the powers of the Prosecutor General’s Office, which comprises a college composed of Public Prosecutors elected by and among their peers.\n\nThe 1989 Constitutional Revision\n\nThe Constitutional Law No. 1/89 dated 8 July 1989 contained the 2nd Constitutional Revision and introduced amendments in what concerned the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office.204\n\nApart from the remarks made hereinafter, no other significant amendments were introduced thereto.\n\nAlthough the systematic insertion was kept, this issue became dealt with by articles 221 and 222.\n\nArticle 221 (Functions and statute) stated as follows:\n\n1. It is incumbent on the Public Prosecution Service to represent the State, to institute criminal proceedings, to defend the democratic Rule of Law and the interests laid down by the law.\n\n2. The Public Prosecution Service has its own statute and autonomy under the law.\n\n3. The Public Prosecutors are accountable magistrates subject to a hierarchy, and they may not be transferred, suspended, retired or removed from office unless otherwise provided for by the law.\n\n4. The appointment, assignment, transfer and promotion of the Public Prosecutors and the undertaking of disciplinary action are incumbent on the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nArticle 222 referred to the Prosecutor General’s Office:\n\n1. The Prosecutor General’s Office is the highest body of the Public Prosecution Service, the composition and powers of which are laid down by the law.\n\n2. The Prosecutor General’s Office is presided over by the Prosecutor General and it comprises the High Council of the Public Prosecution Service, which is composed of members elected by the Assembly of the Republic and members elected by and among the Public Prosecutors.\n\nThe 1997 Constitutional Revision\n\nThe fourth Constitutional Revision had an obvious impact on the structure of both the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nDue to a renumbering of the basic text, articles 219 and 220 became applicable thereto.\n\nAs for the functions and statute, article 219(1) reads as follows:\n\nThe Public Prosecution Service is responsible for representing the State and defending the interests laid down by the law, as well as for participating in the enforcement of the criminal policy as defined by the sovereignty bodies in compliance with paragraph 2 hereabove and pursuant to the law, instituting criminal proceedings guided by the principle of legality and defending the democratic Rule of Law.\n\nAs regards the Prosecutor General’s Office, the new paragraph 3 focused on the Prosecutor General’s tenure of office:\n\nThe Prosecutor General’s tenure of office corresponds to a six-year term without prejudice of the provisions set forth in paragraph 133(m).\n\nThe Public Prosecution Service’s Constitutional soundness\n\nIf we consider closely the evolution undergone by the basic law, it becomes easy to extract therefrom some of the mainstream ideas regarding the Public Prosecution Service and the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nThe first idea dealt with the stability achieved in defining their functions. In fact, four primary functions — so to speak — of the Public Prosecuting Service had remained untouched since 1976: the representation of the State, the defence of the interests laid down by the law, the institution of criminal proceedings and the defence of the democratic Rule of Law.\n\nThe successive constitutional revision laws did not affect these core functions.\n\nNevertheless, the 1997 Constitutional Revision made it clear that the institution of criminal proceedings was guided by the principle of legality; in a different level, it granted official character to another function of the Public Prosecution Service: to participate in the enforcement of the criminal policy defined by the sovereignty bodies.\n\nThis new mission of the Public Prosecution Service, as clearly stated in the Constitution of the Republic, does not jeopardize its statute or autonomy.\n\nIn what concerns the Public Prosecution Service’s statute, the constitutional demand requirement expressed in 1976 reinforced the existence of a universe of magistrates other than that of the Judges. The new text contained all the foundations necessary for an autonomous career, with no particular link with other magistrates’ careers.\n\nFrom 1989 onwards, another feature of the highest relevance was constitutionally enshrined: the autonomy.\n\nThe constitutional legislator used this means in order to reinforce the particular nature of the Public Prosecution Service. By doing so, the legislator protected it from any measures imposed by the common legislator likely to endanger such a value, considering its relevance to the good fulfillment of the functions conferred on it by the Constitution of the Republic.\n\nSince the primitive wording of the constitutional text, the main features of the Public Prosecutors’ career and professional experience have been reaffirmed with a view to establishing their own statute.\n\nAnother consolidated fact is the reference to the Prosecutor General’s Office as the highest body of the Public Prosecution Service. The same guarantee is given to the statute of the Prosecutor General of the Republic, whose tenure of office was first limited in 1997.\n\nFinally, a special reference must be made to the fact that the Constitution has been dedicating an increasing attention to the High Council of the Public Prosecution Service.\n\nA first glimpse of a college within the Prosecutor General’s Office — offered by the text derived from the 1982 Constitutional Revision — was followed by the specific reference to the High Council of the Public Prosecution Service in the 1989 Constitutional Revision. Mainly due to its composition, this Council acquired a status of self-government."
