        "text": "Politics in Portugal operates as a unitary multi-party semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Portugal is the head of government, and the President of Portugal is the non-executive head of state which, although it is a somewhat ceremonial figure,[1] has some significant political powers they exercise often.[2] Executive power is exercised by the Government, whose leader is the prime minister. Legislative power is primarily vested in the Assembly of the Republic (the Portuguese parliament), although the government is also able to legislate on certain matters.[3] The Judiciary of Portugal is independent of the executive and the legislature. The President exerts a sort of \"moderating power\", not easily classified into any of the traditional three branches of government.[2]\n\nSince 1975, the party system has been dominated by the social democratic Socialist Party and the liberal-conservative Social Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to the V-Dem Democracy indices Portugal was 2023 the 20th most electoral democratic country in the world.[4]\n\nPolitical background\n\n[edit]\n\nThe national and regional governments are dominated by two political parties, the centre-left Socialist Party (PS), a social-democratic party, and the centre-right, liberal-conservative Social Democratic Party (PSD), which have similar basic policies in some respects: both are pro-European, support NATO membership, welfare state and market economy. Other parties with seats in the parliament are Chega, the Portuguese Communist Party, the Left Bloc, the Ecologist Party \"The Greens\", LIVRE, and People-Animals-Nature. The Communists and the Greens are in coalition as the Unitary Democratic Coalition.\n\nIn the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, the PSD won enough seats to form a majority government with the CDS-PP. The coalition, led by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, was supported by a majority in the Parliament of 132 MPs. The major opposition party was the Socialist Party (the party of the former prime minister José Sócrates, in office 2005–2011) with 74 MPs. Also represented were the Portuguese Communist Party (14 MPs), \"The Greens\" (2 MPs) and the Left Bloc (8 MPs), all to the left of the governing coalition.\n\nIn the 2015 elections, which the PSD and People's Party (CDS-PP) contested as a coalition, Portugal Ahead, the government lost its absolute majority. The left-wing parties, the Socialist Party, Portuguese Communist Party, Ecologist Party \"The Greens\", and Left Bloc, argued that as they were willing to form a coalition which would have a majority in the assembly, they ought to be invited to form the government, while Portugal Ahead, as the largest grouping, argued that they should be invited to form the government. After three weeks of uncertainty, the President designated Passos Coelho as prime minister, which was followed by the formation of a minority government. However, the Government Programmed was rejected by the Parliament. It was the shortest-lived Portuguese national government since the Carnation Revolution. Since then, the left-wing parties, led by the Socialist Party (PS), have formed the government. On 26 November 2015, there was established a PS minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa.\n\nIn the Portuguese legislative of 2019, the centre-left PS of incumbent Prime Minister Costa obtained the largest share of the vote, and the most seats. On 26 October 2019, there was established a new PS minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa. In the snap 2022 election the ruling PS won an outright majority. Following the Operation Influencer police searches, in November 2023, António Costa resigned and snap elections were called for 10 March 2024, which were won by the Democratic Alliance.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first constitution was created in 1822 (following the Liberal Revolution of 1820),[5] followed by a second in 1826, followed by a third in 1838 (after the Liberal Wars),[6] a fourth in 1911 (following the 5 October 1910 revolution),[6] and a fifth 1933 (after the 28 May 1926 coup d'état).[6]\n\nPortugal's 25 April 1976 constitution reflected the country's 1974–76 move from authoritarian rule to provisional military government to a representative democracy with some initial Communist and left-wing influence. The military coup in 1974, which became known as the Carnation Revolution, was a result of multiple internal and external factors like the colonial wars that ended in removing the dictator, Marcelo Caetano, from power. The prospect of a communist takeover in Portugal generated considerable concern among the country's NATO allies. The revolution also led to the country abruptly abandoning its colonies overseas and to the return of an estimated 600,000 Portuguese citizens from abroad. The 1976 constitution, which defined Portugal as a \"Republic... engaged in the formation of a classless society,\" was revised in 1982, 1989, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2004.\n\nThe 1982 revision of the constitution placed the military under strict civilian control, trimmed the powers of the president, and abolished the Revolutionary Council (a military body with legislative veto and quasi-judicial powers). The country joined the European Union in 1986, beginning a path toward greater economic and political integration with its richer neighbors in Europe. The 1989 revision of the constitution eliminated much of the remaining Marxist rhetoric of the original document, abolished the communist-inspired \"agrarian reform\", and laid the groundwork for further privatization of nationalized firms and the government-owned communications media. The 1992 revision made it compatible with the Maastricht Treaty.\n\nThe current Portuguese constitution provides for progressive administrative decentralization and calls for future reorganization on a regional basis. The Azores and Madeira archipelagos have constitutionally mandated autonomous status. A regional autonomy statute promulgated in 1980 established the Government of the Autonomous Region of the Azores; the Government of the Autonomous Region of Madeira operates under a provisional autonomy statute in effect since 1976. Apart from the Azores and Madeira, the country is divided into 18 districts, each headed by a governor appointed by the Minister of Internal Administration. Macau, a former dependency, reverted to Chinese sovereignty in December 1999.\n\nI and II Constitutional Governments (1976–1978)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Socialist Party, under the leadership of Mário Soares, rose to power after the 1976 legislative elections and formed the I Constitutional Government. However, this government faced a lot of problems due to the country's economic situation, and in 1978, the II Constitutional Government, a coalition between the Socialists and the Democratic and Social Centre, was sworn in. The coalition only lasted eight months and Mário Soares resigned.[7]\n\nIII, IV and V Constitutional Governments (1978–1980)\n\n[edit]\n\nPresident Eanes then nominated the III Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Alfredo Nobre da Costa, which was sworn in on late August 1978, but lasted just three months as it failed to gain Parliamentary support.[8]\n\nThe IV Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Carlos Mota Pinto, was sworn in on late November 1978, but, like the previous government, lasted very little, eight months, due to its failure to pass policies in Parliament.[9]\n\nThe president then swore in the V Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, the first and still only female prime minister in Portuguese history. The government managed the country until the early elections of December 1979.[10]\n\nVI, VII, VIII Constitutional Governments (1980–1983)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Democratic Alliance, under the leadership of Francisco Sá Carneiro, won the 1979 legislative elections by a big margin and the VI Constitutional Government was sworn in on January 1980. Sá Carneiro's tenure was short lived as he died in a tragic plane crash in December 1980.[11]\n\nIn January 1981, the Social Democratic Party, the main party within the Democratic Alliance, elected Francisco Pinto Balsemão as leader and the VII Constitutional Government was sworn in.[12] Internal issues within the Alliance forced a new government to take office, the VIII Constitutional Government, in September 1981, also led by Pinto Balsemão. Balsemão resigned in late 1982.[13]\n\nIX Constitutional Government (1983–1985)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Socialist Party, under the leadership of Mário Soares, returned to power after the 1983 legislative election and formed a Central Bloc government, the IX Constitutional Government, between the two main parties, the Socialists and the Social Democrats. Soares resigned in June 1985 after the Social Democrats withdrew from government.[14]\n\nX, XI and XII Constitutional Governments (1985–1995)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Social Democratic Party, under the leadership of Aníbal Cavaco Silva, rose to power after the 1985 legislative elections and formed a minority government. However, the government lost the confidence of Parliament in April 1987 after losing a non-confidence vote.[15] After this, President Mário Soares called an early election for July 1987.\n\nThe 1987 early elections were held on 19 July and resulted in a landslide majority government for the Social Democrats, the first time a party won a majority on its own in democracy.[16] The XI Constitutional Government, the first one to finish a full 4-year term in democracy, was sworn in on 17 August 1987. During this term, the PSD government initiated a big program of liberalization and privatization of several sectors of the economy.[17]\n\nIn the 1991 election the Social Democrats were returned again to power and, also, with an absolute majority. It was the third consecutive election victory for the PSD, a record in democracy. The XII Constitutional Government was sworn in on 31 October 1991. After 1992, the economy fell into a recession and despite the recession being over by mid 1994, the government was badly hit and Cavaco Silva decided to not run for a fourth term as prime minister.[18] Cavaco Silva's 10-year tenure as prime minister is the longest, so far, in democracy.[19]\n\nXIII and XIV Constitutional Governments (1995–2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Socialist Party, under the leadership of António Guterres, came to power following the October 1995 legislative elections. The Socialists later won a new mandate by winning exactly half the parliamentary seats in the October 1999 election, and constituting then the XIV Constitutional Government. Socialist Jorge Sampaio won the February 1996 presidential elections with nearly 54% of the vote. Sampaio's election marked the first time since the 1974 revolution that a single party held the prime ministership, the presidency, and a plurality of the municipalities. Local elections were held in December 1997.\n\nPrime Minister Guterres continued the privatization and modernization policies initiated by his predecessor, Aníbal Cavaco Silva (in office 1985–1995) of the Social Democratic Party. Guterres was a vigorous proponent of the effort to include Portugal in the first round of countries to collaborate and put into effect the euro in 1999. In international relations, Guterres pursued strong ties with the United States and greater Portuguese integration with the European Union while continuing to raise Portugal's profile through an activist foreign policy. One of his first decisions as prime minister was to send 900 troops to participate in the IFOR peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. Portugal later contributed 320 troops to SFOR, the follow-up Bosnia operation. Portugal also contributed aircraft and personnel to NATO's Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. Guterres resigned in December 2001 after a disappointing result in the local elections.[20]\n\nXV Constitutional Government (2002–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the results of the 2002 early election, the XV Constitutional Government, led by José Manuel Durão Barroso, leader of the Social Democratic Party, in coalition with the People's Party, whose leader, Paulo Portas, became Minister of Defence, was sworn in on April 2002. This government lasted two years because, in June 2004, Durão Barroso announced his resignation in order to become President of the European Commission.[21]\n\nXVI Constitutional Government (2004–2005)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter José Manuel Durão Barroso accepted the invitation to be the next European Commission President, a new government had to be formed. Though opposition parties called for general elections, President Jorge Sampaio named Pedro Santana Lopes, the new Social Democratic Party leader, as prime minister, who thus formed a new government, in coalition with the People's Party. However, in December 2004, due to several controversies involving the government, the President dissolved the parliament and called for early elections. Santana Lopes resigned after the announcement of the President's decision.\n\nXVII and XVIII Constitutional Governments (2005–2011)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the elections on 20 February, the Socialist Party obtained its largest victory ever, achieving an absolute majority for the first time in the party's history. Prime Minister José Sócrates was sworn in by President Jorge Sampaio on 12 March. To many's surprise, Sócrates formed a cabinet made up of roughly half senior members of the Socialist Party and half independents, notably including Diogo Freitas do Amaral, founder of the right wing People's Party, who assumed office as Ministry of Foreign Affairs (he later resigned due to personal issues).\n\nIn the elections on 27 September 2009, The Socialist Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister José Sócrates, won the largest number of seats, but did not repeat the overall majority they gained in 2005. Sócrates was reconducted but lost his majority. The 2010 European debt crisis led Portugal to ask for a bailout from the IMF and the European Union. This situation led to the resignation of José Sócrates as prime minister and the President dissolved parliament and called an early election for June 2011.\n\nXIX and XX Constitutional Governments (2011–2015)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the elections held on 5 June 2011, the Social Democratic Party won enough seats to form a majority government with the People's Party. The Government was led by Pedro Passos Coelho. It had 11 ministers and was sworn in on 21 June.\n\nThe Portuguese legislative election of 2015 was held on 4 October. The results display a relative victory of the right-wing coalition, but they also display a combined victory of the left-wing parties (including the Socialist Party), with a hung parliament (a right-wing single winner and a left-wing majority parliament). After the election, the XX Constitutional Government of Portugal had Pedro Passos Coelho (PSD) as the prime minister and lasted from 30 October 2015 to 26 November 2015. However, the Government Programme was rejected by the Parliament. It was the shortest-lived Portuguese national government since the Carnation Revolution.\n\nXXI, XXII and XXIII Constitutional Governments (2015–2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 21st cabinet of the Portuguese government since the establishment of the current constitution. It was established on 26 November 2015 as a Socialist Party (PS) minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa.\n\nThe Portuguese legislative election of 2019 was held on 6 October 2019. The centre-left Socialist Party (PS) of incumbent Prime Minister Costa obtained the largest share of the vote, and the most seats. The XXII Constitutional Government of Portugal was sworn in on 26 October 2019 as a Socialist Party (PS) minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa. In October 2021, the budget proposed by the government was rejected by Parliament, leading President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to call an early election for January 2022.[22]\n\nThe 2022 early elections were held on 30 January 2022. The election resulted in an absolute majority for the Socialist Party, the second in its history.[23] However, the government swearing in was postponed because of a rerun in the overseas constituency of Europe, and the XXIII Constitutitional Government, led by Prime Minister António Costa, was only sworn in on 30 March 2022.[24] António Costa resigned on 7 November 2023, following the Operation Influencer police searches into government contracts surrounding lithium and hydrogen businesses.[25] The President dissolved parliament and called early elections.[26]\n\nXXIV Constitutional Government (2024–)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the elections held on 10 March 2024, the Democratic Alliance, alliance between the Social Democratic Party, People's Party and the People's Monarchist Party, won enough seats to form a minority government. The Government led by Luís Montenegro has 17 ministers and was sworn in on 2 April 2024.\n\nPolitical powers\n\n[edit]\n\nPortuguese branches of government\n\nÓrgãos de soberaniaSemi-presidential republicFormation25 April 1976 ( )Founding document1976 ConstitutionCountryPortugalPresident of the RepublicHolderMarcelo Rebelo de SousaSeatBelém PalaceLegislative branchLegislatureAssembly of the RepublicSpeakerJosé Pedro Aguiar-BrancoDeputy SpeakerTeresa Morais,\n\nMarcos Perestrello,\n\nDiogo Pacheco de Amorim,\n\nRodrigo SaraivaAssembly members230Meeting placeSão Bento PalaceExecutive branchPrime MinisterLuís MontenegroMain bodyGovernmentVice Prime MinisterCurrently noneAppointed byPresident of the RepublicHeadquartersSão Bento MansionMain organCouncil of MinistersDepartmentsMinistries and State SecretariatsJudicial branchCourtConstitutional CourtPresidentJosé João AbrantesSeatRatton PalaceOther courts and presidentsSupreme Court of Justice (João Cura Mariano),\n\nSupreme Administrative Court (Dulce Neto),\n\nCourt of Auditors (José Tavares)\n\nGovernment in Portugal is made up of three branches originally envisioned by enlightenment philosopher Baron de Montesquieu: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each branch is separate and is designed to keep checks and balances on the others. The President's powers, however, do not fall into either of the traditional three, forming instead a sort of \"moderating power\" over the government and the legislature.[2]\n\nThe four main organs of the national government are the President, the Government (which includes the prime minister and the Council of Ministers), the Assembly of the Republic (Parliament), and the judiciary, made up of different hierarchies of courts (the Supreme Court of Justice and its lower courts, the Supreme Adminsitrative Court and its lower courts, the Constitutional Court and the Court of Auditors).\n\nPresident\n\n[edit]\n\nThe President, elected to a 5-year term by direct, universal suffrage, is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Presidential powers include appointing the prime minister and Council of Ministers, in which the President must be guided by the assembly election results; dismissing the prime minister; dissolving the assembly to call early elections; vetoing legislation, which may be overridden by the assembly; and declaring a state of war or siege, only with the approval of the assembly and on government advice.\n\nThe Council of State, a presidential advisory body, is composed of:[27]\n\nThe President of the Assembly of the Republic\n\nThe Prime Minister of Portugal\n\nThe President of the Constitutional Court of Portugal\n\nThe Ombudsman of Portugal\n\nBoth Presidents of the regional governments of the autonomous regions (Madeira and Azores)\n\nFormer Presidents of the Republic\n\nFive citizens appointed by the President of the Republic\n\nFive citizens appointed by the Assembly of the Republic\n\nThe president, according to the election results, names the party that shall form a government, whose leader is appointed prime minister. The prime minister names the Council of Ministers, and the ministers name their Secretaries of State. A new government is required to define the broad outline of its policy in a program and present it to the assembly for a mandatory period of debate. Failure of the assembly to reject the program by a majority of deputies confirms the government in office.\n\nMain office-holders Office Name Party Since President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa Social Democratic Party 9 March 2016 Prime Minister Luís Montenegro Social Democratic Party 2 April 2024\n\nPresidential elections\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2021 Portuguese presidential election\n\nCandidatePartyVotes%Marcelo Rebelo de SousaSocial Democratic Party–People's Party2,531,69260.67Ana GomesIndependent supported by People Animals Nature–LIVRE540,82312.96André VenturaChega497,74611.93João FerreiraPortuguese Communist Party–The Greens179,7644.31Marisa MatiasLeft Bloc–Socialist Alternative Movement165,1273.96Tiago Mayan GonçalvesLiberal Initiative134,9913.23Vitorino SilvaReact, Include, Recycle123,0312.95Total4,173,174100.00Valid votes4,173,17498.00Invalid votes38,0180.89Blank votes47,1641.11Total votes4,258,356100.00Registered voters/turnout10,847,43439.26Source: Comissão Nacional de Eleições\n\nLegislative branch\n\n[edit]\n\nLegislative power is exercised by the Assembly of the Republic, which is the parliament of Portugal, although the Government also has a more limited ability to legislate on some matters (on others, Parliament has exclusive legislative competence). It is also the body which holds the Government accountable and has the means to remove it from office at any time, as described earlier, primarily through a motion of no confidence, although alternative methods exist.[3]\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of 230 deputies (that is, members of parliament). Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of proportional representation, deputies serve terms of office of 4 years, unless the president dissolves the assembly and calls for new elections.[3] According to the constitution, members of the assembly represent the entire country, not the constituency from which they are elected.\n\nPolitical parties in legislative elections\n\n[edit]\n\nFor other political parties, see List of political parties in Portugal.

The Government is formed after the President appoints the prime minister based on election results, as described earlier – traditionally, the leader of the most voted party.\n\nThe Government can only remain in place for as long as the Parliament allows: the Parliament can remove the Government at the beginning by approving a motion of rejection to the introductory Government programme, or at any time by approving a motion of no confidence, either of which is achieved by a simple majority; the Government may also, of its own initiative, choose to present at any time a motion of confidence, which acts as the opposite of a motion of no confidence: if rejected, the Government is removed. Finally, the Government also relies on Parliament to approve the state budget, which also allows Parliament to indirectly force the Government to resign by rejecting its budget proposal. Thus, the Government, although not directly elected, is held accountable before Parliament, which is proportionally representative of the people.[3] Typically, once the Government is removed from office, the President will call a snap election (also known as an early election).\n\nJudicial branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe national Supreme Court is the court of last appeal in civil and criminal matters, which is described by the Constitution as \"the senior organ in the hierarchy of the courts of law\". There is a separate system of courts for administrative and fiscal matters, for which the court of last appeal is the Supreme Administrative Court. During war time, the law provides for there being military courts. A thirteen-member Constitutional Court reviews the constitutionality of legislation. There is also a Court of Auditors.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Subdivisions of Portugal\n\nThere are two autonomous regions (regiões autónomas, singular região autónoma) with limited legislative powers besides the administrative ones: Azores and Madeira. As purely administrative divisions, there are 18 districts (distritos), 308 municipalities (municípios) and 3,091 civil parishes (freguesias). The districts are Aveiro, Açores (Azores)*, Beja, Braga, Bragança, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Évora, Faro, Guarda, Leiria, Lisboa, Madeira*, Portalegre, Porto, Santarém, Setúbal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and Viseu.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nPortugal portal\n\nAssembly of the Republic\n\nForeign relations of Portugal\n\nMember of the European Parliament\n\nSinistrisme\n\nPolitics of France (similar system of Government)\n\nPolitics of Romania (similar system of Government)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
