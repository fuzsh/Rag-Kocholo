Therefore, this research aims to seek in the nineteenth century the social context in which women lived in the city of Campanha, in Minas Gerais, Brazil so that through their participation potentiate the spheres of education in history. The general aspect of education seeks to find agents that determine conduct important and positive increases in the individual culture of relationships, working as a fundamental axis, assisting in the reaization of ideas and questions that affect the whole process of knowledge, progress, work and freedom. Social change through education led to the woman in the interaction between professional qualification and the need to achieve in a democratic context. Therefore, educational transitions are examined and discussed as also approach the current concepts, depicting the social progress of a joint education aiming to work, freedom of expression and especially the country’s progress, in the recognition of differences these are found in dimensions of justice. This research views the social problems, integrating the concept of education and citizenship, in order to put yourself in the other and in the process of reconstruction of history, to combat inequality with responsibility. The great complexity leading social factors allows in a reflection on the theoretical points of the evolution of knowledge for disclosure of the factors proving hypotheses and meet cultural production, focusing on the question of the subject, freedom, work and progress. Francisca Senhorinha, a teacher from the city of Campaign, who fought for education and for social causes in favor of the rights of the citizen, expresses her burden of feeling before the existence of the things of the world and stands in the unfolding of social struggles in favor of the emancipation of women and their insertion in society. Francisca Senhorinha recreates a new language in the ways of education and positions herself in a questioning of women's rights, in which her voice is entirely significant for the effectiveness of social struggles in favor of women and the disadvantaged. The nineteenth century, in the period from 1873 to 1889, responds to external stimuli that are essentially a more prominent view of reality whose social struggles have been rigorously manifested, characterized in a harmony between freedom and progress of the nation. Before the radical questioning of reality, the nature of construction for the empowerment of women and their integration in society, XIX century manifests itself in many facets according to the positioning of people to add value on personal and professional fulfillment. Trends XIX century, whose tonic materializes the causes of education, with the significant order freedom, work and progress, coalesces on traditions, in perfect relationship with reality and approach each by the human conscience for the communion of the universal right. In this sense, this research approaches the paths of education in Minas Gerais, in the city of Campaign, which intensifies women's struggle for their rights.\n\nALMEIDA, CÃ¡rmen Dolores AvÃ³ BaiÃ£o Ferreira de, The Dissemination of Photography in Portugal, 18th Century: Protagonists, Pratices and Knowledge Circulation Networks, PhD in History and Philosophy of Science submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Maria de FÃ¡tima Nunes, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/21269)\n\nKeywords: Center; Dissemination of knowledge; Communication; Scientific culture; Photography; History of science; Laboratory; Periphery; Popularization of science; Knowledge networks\n\nAbstract: While a movement for the renewal of the History and Philosophy of Science began in the early 1970s, the historiography of photography abandoned the traditional approach inspired by the canons of art history (based on Newall Beaumont's model), a collection of works having appeared whose authors are now not the scientists of the 19th century, the pioneers of the historiography of photography, or curators, art critics or photographers from the 1940s to the 1970s, but historians, philosophers and a small number of few sociologists, while the reassumption of the scientific and technical nature of photography is patent, as well as a certain abandonment of discourses on its artistic aspect and also those contained in semiotic works, in the discourse of the document, of the reproduction of \"what was”. At the same time, during the past decade, increasing importance has been given to the spread and popularization of science and technology, both in centers of importance and regions of peripheral importance in Europe, as well as case studies, which in historiographic terms, increase our understanding of the \"peculiarities\" of these aspects in countries which hitherto have had little importance as far as the production of scientific literature is concerned. The appearance of these studies in countries or regions of peripheral importance as compared with traditional centers of learning, allow for the in-depth study of the training and dissemination of interpretative frameworks that determined photographic use and practice in a wide range of social, economic and geographical contexts, and could pave the way for the entry of photography and photographers to the field of the history of scientific culture and scientific dissemination. It is within this framework that we seek to investigate the dissemination, development and popularization of photographic practice in Portugal and, in particular, the Alentejo region: a small peripheral region, located in a country with a profile of peripheral importance, throughout the 19th century. We seek to adopt a transversal approach focused on three levels of analysis: the influence of a radiating center of new discovery (particularly France and Britain); Portugal, with emphasis on the great occasions and figures of 19th-century national photographic history; and the Alentejo.\n\nALVES, Daniel Ribeiro, Republic behind the Counter. Shopkeepers of Lisbon in the final phase of the Monarchy (1870-1910), PhD in History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by LuÃ­s Nuno Espinha da Silveira, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/4658)\n\nKeywords: History; Lower-middle-class; Petty bourgeoisie; Shopkeepers; Republicanism; Lisbon; 19th century; 20th century\n\nAbstract: About the petty bourgeoisie in contemporary Portugal there isn’t an overall research work that serves as a pivot to the emergence of more advanced work, or even a series of articles that encourage a line of research to shed some light on this sector of society and on its economic and political role in the last two centuries. For the period covered by this text, this relative scarcity is particularly strange, if one takes into account what some authors refer to have been the role, for example, of shopkeepers in the social and political conjuncture of the final period of the monarchy. However, in most cases, these references are vague and restricted to the mere indication that retailers were a social group where Republicans had ensured a good representation. Despite these testimonies of what has been the involvement of shopkeepers in the republican movement, little is said about why, how and when the link between small business and republicanism took place. Through a detailed analysis of the development of small businesses in Lisbon, about the political and social discourse of the shopkeepers, their class interests, their electoral participation and their relationship with politicians in the final phase of the monarchy, this work is intended to point out one possible path for those explanations. A path to the Republic that was not predetermined, that could even have been another, substantially different, that started shaping up in the early 1890s and that was already crystallized in the first decade of the twentieth century.\n\nAMADO, Maria do Castelo Teixeira Malta Romeiras da Costa, Hide and seek: Normality issues and global discourses on blind school modern projects (late 18th-19th centuries), PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Jorge Ramos do Ã, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/8140)\n\nKeywords: Blindness; Normation; Modernity; Self-government; School\n\nAbstract: The present work intends to redirect and reposition several questions related to the birth of schools conceived for the blind, which happened simultaneously in several locations of the modern western world. This very same event may also by related with the global tendency for the school to become an institutional process of taxonomical classification and establishment of a self-control economy over the citizens being taught and socially captured, as well as with the discourses of desire of those same citizens, concerning their own integration in a space of individual power determination and development. By working with documents from three different case studies, coming from diverse political, geographical and social situations (the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles in Paris, the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the United Kingdom and the Istituto per I Poveri Ciechi in Milan, I was able to find patterns in diversity. This empiric enrichment led me, on the footsteps of Deleuze, Derrida and Foucault, to rethink the attainability of body normalization through the normation of pedagogic and social discourses. Likewise, my question ponders the identification of common possibilities between different movements of institutional teaching, oriented for bodies with diversified sensorial input perception, paving parallel paths towards a same citizenship model. At the same time, it also awakes me to the leading of those bodies onto a provocative desire to be equal, turning each person into a participant of both a personal disciplinary web and also a labyrinth of indetermination, as powerful as self-knowledge exclusion itself.\n\nANDRADE, Joel Carlos de Souza, In demand of Sebastianism in Portugal and in Brazil: a comparative study (19th-20th centuries), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Fernando JosÃ© de Almeida Catroga, 2015 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/26814)\n\nKeywords: Sebastianism; Portugal; Brazil; Comparative study\n\nAbstract: This study aims to compare the manifestations of Sebastianism in Portugal and in Brazil, on the 19th and 20th centuries. It is true that they are prior to these periods in their more gullible strands, facet in which the spread of founding texts, particularly in Trovas de Bandarra, was being assimilated by popular classes that, in a more orthodox or heterodox way, lived, individually or as sects, the denial of the death of D. Sebastian in AlcÃ¡cer-Quibir, in 1578, in the expectation of his inevitable return. We also wanted to highlight the common background to Portugal and Brazil from the point of departure of the phenomenon. However, it was our intention to highlight this difference: while in Brazil its \"religious\" and popular dimension, especially in certain poor and more isolated regions, continued over the course of the 19th century. In the metropolis, the critical distance was accompanied by the extinction of various incarnations of \"D. Sebastian\", which, sooner than in Brazil, has transformed it into myth, whose meaning will have to be read in light of the issues of the time: the definition of national identities and their understanding as communities of destiny. In this sense, the effort of this quest was to analyse and describe the object in a comparative perspective, in order to detect their contiguities and their differences in Portugal and in Brazil. Challenge that led us to explore a methodology that would be able to reveal the discursive sedimentation of the Sebastic plot in its different legitimated repertoires. With it, we avoided the ambition of making \"the history of Sebastianism\", or to explain its \"origin\", or to see the Brazilian experience as a mere \"appendix\" of the Portuguese, or, even, of diluting it in the debate about the so-called \"Portuguese-Brazilian culture\", where, if we might add, the issue has passed a little way off of scholars. However, it also did not take into account that Sebastianism is heir to a rich range of discourses that, directly or indirectly, broadened the semantics of terms that, in the mythology concerned, have value for themselves, as was the case of words such as \"D. Sebastian\", \"Sebastianists\" and \"Sebastianism\". With this perspective we wanted to prove that, if the myth was judged as an object of curiosity by foreigners, for many Brazilian and Portuguese intellectuals, during the last decades of the 18th century its continuity, even if more mitigated, caused concern, particularly at a time when nations sought in technique and science the engines of progress and emancipation of the people. Moreover, if there were many writings which, then, helped to intellectualise Sebastianism - seeing it, even from a idiosyncratic dimension -, few were those who saw in it substance for reflection, from where they could take important lessons about the identity processes and the historicity of their production and reproduction. It is within this framework that we have privileged the writings of Oliveira Martins, in the case of Portugal, and those of Euclides da Cunha, in relation to Brazil, both fitted with a broad theoretical framework and that took advantage of the possibilities offered by the emergence of new social sciences, particularly those who theorized the various evolutionisms and the risk of its degeneration. From the first, we retook the Sebastic repertoire and applied it a multidisciplinary treatment, in line with a cultural anthropology of the myth and with the concepts of nation and nationality, opposed to the scientific vision of the Positivists. From the second, who dialogued with Oliveira Martins and with the previous Brazilian Sebastic experiences, we reinterpreted its interpretation of the episode of Canudos, in the conflictual stage of the establishment of the Republic in Brazil, in an immense laboratory where Euclides da Cunha aimed to understand the Brazilian nationality, without concealing the positive force of the Sebastic component in the set of some ancient practices still held in the hinterlands of Northern Brazil. From all this it has been confirmed that the Portuguese specificities, soon turned Sebastianism into a cultural myth, whose survival has mitigated itself into an attentiveness own of those who wait, not so much in its action, but the emergence of the impossible, the expected redemption, like a \"regressive utopia\", of the evils of the homeland. In Brazil, for its part, the Sebastic demonstrations of the eighteen hundreds had a more popular, apocalyptic and sacrificial imprint. However, they also gained an intellectualised nature, turned towards action, and whose permanences are still perceived as one of the more lasting references of Portuguese culture. From where everything that is exposed is not disconnected from the continuing debate on the construction of Brazil as a nation.\n\nASSIS, JosÃ© LuÃ­s, Military Scientific Journals (1849-1918): Exchanges and Circulation of Technical-Scientific Knowledge, PhD in History submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Maria de FÃ¡tima Nunes and AntÃ³nio Pedro Vicente, 2011\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nAUGUSTO, MÃ³nica Sofia Botelho Lima, Municipality: Tarouca 1808-1830, PhD in History submitted to the Department of Tourism Heritage and Culture of the Universidade Portucalense, supervised by Ana SÃ­lvia Albuquerque Nunes, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/11328/600)\n\nKeywords: Tarouca; Ucanha; VÃ¡rzea da Serra; Municipalism; Local Power; Society\n\nAbstract: From 1808 to 1830, in the beginning of the 19th century, Tarouca, Ucanha and VÃ¡rzea da Serra were three municipalities which today belong to the municipality of Tarouca. Tarouca was a manorial municpality, belonging to the Earls of Tarouca, donataries of the town, whilst Ucanha and VÃ¡rzea da Serra were royal municipality. The election system of the town executive of Tarouca, in particular the Aldermen and Attorneys, contrary to what is registered in the majority of the municipalities, does not evolve into a system of election through agenda, but the system of election through “pelouros”. Those chosen to perform the duties of Aldermen and Attorney are also present in other prestigious positions at the local level. The municipalities of Ucanha and VÃ¡rzea da Serra are similar in what concerns their jurisdiction. Both are regal municipalities, and according to elections, both use clearance agendas and regal nomination. The prominent role in these municipalities belongs to the Informers and the Voters who repeated these functions several times and were able to control the whole electoral process and the actual composition of the senate. In relation to the social and professional level of the holders of town council posts, there is a difference between the municipalities of Ucanha and VÃ¡rzea da Serra. While in the first occupations related to military structure are predominant, in the latter professions related to the land, especially farmers prevail.\n\nÃVILA, Leandro Adelino Andrade Cardoso, The National High School of Angra do HeroÃ­smo in the final decades of the Monarchy (1880-1910): the course of an insular lycee institution, PhD in Insular and Atlantic History (15th-20th centuries) submitted to the School of Social Sciences & Humanities of the Universidade dos AÃ§ores, supervised by Carlos Alberto da Costa Cordeiro, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.3/4571)\n\nKeywords: Academic Community; High School Instruction; Azores; Amenities; Culture\n\nAbstract: The Luciano de Castro's amendment pursued to grant a new course to the Portuguese high school education, however, it was Jaime Moniz's legislation that teminated the chaotic status of the lyceum education. Nevertheless, the asymmetry between the two lyceums carried on putting them in different categories. In this interconnection, the angrense high school strove for the improvement of this specific category for decades. The intention was to administer the complete lyceum education and several arguments were used in order to legitimate this pretension. In the extent of the archipelago, everything was done so that this concept would take effect and that at the same time it would be a factor of centrality and appreciation of the district itself. In this field, this and other matters acquired political influences. The role of the district authorities, the political parties and the chancellor's prestige were also influent aspects. Besides the gap when it comes to the amenities and the elitist character of the students, the angrense lyceum was yet an important cultural and intelectual centre of the district, impacting and being impacted by it's surroundings. Timewise, the angrense high school reality in the national context was crucial as it can contribute to the holistic enlightenment of the Portuguese high school entity interlocking the particularities of an insular lyceum.\n\nBEATO, Carlos Alberto da Silva, High schools and sciences (1836-1860): A study on the process of creation of the disciplines of physical and natural sciences in Portuguese lyceums, PhD in Education: History of Education submitted to the Institute of Education of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Joaquim AntÃ³nio de Sousa Pintassilgo, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/5486)\n\nKeywords: High School; Science Subjects; Science Teachers; Materials and Lab Equipment; Textbooks\n\nAbstract: This study aims to make the history of science subjects in Portuguese high schools in the period between 1836 and 1860, i.e. the first twenty-five years of their existence. Based primarily on archive material, the work unfolds in three parts dealing respectively with the introduction of the disciplines of physics, chemistry and natural history in high schools, particularly in Lisbon, Porto and Coimbra; the science teachers, their training and procedural processes; and the science classes in high schools, their material conditions and available equipment, textbooks and programs and pedagogies used. It was concluded that the process of introduction of science subjects in high schools was a very controversial process, especially in Lisbon‘s high school, where this occurred only at a later date, nearly at the end of the period considered in this study. Another aspect that is emphasized is that although the methods and procedures varied and with them, also the demand for skills over the study period, all teachers and candidates for the post were the possessors of top-level academic training. The materials provided to equip the laboratories and offices of the science classes did not always meet the teachers needs or wishes, which was a restrictive factor for the programs, which were defined locally, nor did they meet the pedagogical practices. In what textbooks are concerned it was found that most of them were in French, with encyclopedic features, which aside the language barrier, gave each teacher the possibility to design a program according to their preferences.\n\nBELO, Alberto JosÃ© Grilo, The Chamber of Peers in the Age of the Great Political Reforms (1870-1895), PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Maria de FÃ¡tima BonifÃ¡cio, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/7469)\n\nKeywords: Bicameralism; Upper House; Peerage\n\nAbstract: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the Chamber of Peers and its articulation with the remaining sovereignty organs, namely with the executive branch between 1870 and 1895. A period wherein the political system, in two of its essential pieces - the electoral system and the Chamber of Peers - suffered the deepest reforms since the establishment of constitutional monarchy in 1834. Composed exclusively by members for life and hereditary of royal appointment, the Portuguese Upper House has become an anachronism in the context of European Bicameralism. Therefore, the composition of the Second Chamber was also the main target of criticism. More than its powers and functions is its organizational structure which is more repeatedly called into question. Theoretically, the Chamber of Peers should play a moderating and stabilizing mission of the constitutional monarchy. However, due to its historical genesis, it was sometimes a disturbing factor of regime stability. This unusual protagonism of the Upper House forced the governments to resort to the famous “fornadas”. Even so it was there that sometimes were overturned. This Portuguese originality was not due to the ingratitude of the Portuguese Peerage solely. To some extent such originality was related to the way the Peerage expressed its independence. But it was also a consequence of the fact that governments, at least until the early 1880s, are threatened by an absent majority that only appeared in the Chamber in exceptional circumstances, that is, in the most important votings.\n\nBIGUELINI, Elen, I have been writing a lot: Women who wrote in Portugal (1800-1850), PhD in History: Economies and Societies submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Maria AntÃ³nia Lopes, 2017\n\n(https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/79402)\n\nKeywords: Women history; Social cultural history; Women writers; First half of the XIX century; Feminist literary criticism\n\nAbstract: “I’ve been writing a lot and I still have much to write” has professed D. Augusta Franzini in a letter to her father. This phrase could have been uttered or written by many other Portuguese authoresses from the early XIX century. These women were not the first ones to write, but they’ve done so despite male desire to keep them in the house. Their designated place was the home and its private functions. Writing was a deviation of that. Still, many women have put their pens to paper and leaving behind their intimate thoughts and poetic or prose creations. This thesis inserts itself in the area of Women’s History as well as that of Social and Cultural History. It attempts to find women who have written and published in Portugal from 1800 to 1850. Portuguese, Brazilian and French women, as well as an Argentinian, have left their opinions of the world in a great variety of works. Ninety-five names and ten anonyms have been found in Brazilian and Portuguese libraries and archives. Their names are mostly unknown. Some have been completely erased from History despite their rather large volume work since only initials and pseudonyms remain. Others, more accepted by their contemporaries, have been added to the Literary History which allowed some information from their daily lives to have survived. Others still have left little, but enough information, to permit some knowledge of who they were, but not much. Feminist Literary Criticism, specifically Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert’s concept of Anxiety of Authorship, allows the understanding of the fear these women have felt of being accepted by their male pears and the general public as well as that of seeming like a bluestaking. These ladies have written in plenty of different styles and formats: from poetry, to romance (both as books and as feuilleton), to newspapers. Through these they have become part of the Portuguese literary culture, slowly finding their space, which would become much greater in the second half of the century. The themes they chose to write about are also part of the focus of this thesis that wishes to comprehend what they wished to say and how they decided to do so. Subjects revolved around the revolved female day-to-day life (maternity, love and marriage) were extremely common. But these writers have also used their texts as critics to Society and its treatment of women, especially in regards to seduction and rape. History, slavery as well as the supernatural are themes that can also be found in the works of women writer from this period, despite not being labelled as feminine. Even though many of their names have disappeared, their work has been read and even defended by some of their male colleagues. Others opposed their talents completely. But still books written by women have been sold and read even across the ocean, where they were accepted and printed even in Brazilian lands. An extensive list of authoresses and their books accompanies this work, that has the principal objective of making these names known to Portuguese history and literature. Be them better or worse books, more or less productive writers; all of them deserve to be remembered by women’s history, by literature and Social and Cultural History since society and cultures are protagonized both by men and women being a product of their lives and desires.\n\nBRANCO, Susana Antas Fernandes Videira, A legal reading of the social question: Contribution to the history of political ideas in contemporary Portugal (1820-1890), PhD in Law: Legal History submitted to the Faculty of Law of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Pedro Barbas Homem, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/6767)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nCARVALHO, Marcos AntÃ´nio, Drinking aÃ§ai, eating codfish: Profile and practices of Portuguese sociability in BelÃ©m do ParÃ¡ between the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Maria da ConceiÃ§Ã£o Coelho de Meireles Pereira, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/63200)\n\nKeywords: Portuguese immigration; Belem do ParÃ¡; Portuguese institutions; Portuguese press in immigration; Portuguese sociability in ParÃ¡\n\nAbstract: The peak period of the extraction of rubber in the Amazon would bring economic prosperity to the region, albeit short-lived. BelÃ©m do ParÃ¡ and Manaus live what regional historiography classifies as its belle Ã©poque. With the activity of the rubber comes the urbanization of Belem, from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century. With it also come the changes in the capital of ParÃ¡ State, concerning material life, the organization of geographic space and the behavior of people who lived in the capital. These changes in behavior and management were caused, among other factors, by the euphoria of the economy of gum elastic and the movement of the port of Belem with the arrival of European immigrants, especially those of Lusitanian origin. The time economic, political and social context of the city of Bethlehem are used to compile the cyclical framework of research of the Portuguese presence in the region. Through the research of immigration legislation located in the Public Archives of ParÃ¡ and posture presented in the reports of the provincial governments of the period between 1890-1914 can be identified questions that guided the local policy on immigration. Tabulation and analysis of the qualifications issued by the Portuguese Consulate filed at GrÃªmio LiterÃ¡rio e Recreativo PortuguÃªs and present information to build the profile of Portuguese immigrants in BelÃ©m do ParÃ¡. Experiences and sociability of the Portuguese community are analyzed through its newspapers: O Caixeiro e A Voz do Caixeiro.

This industry was mainly composed by two structures - the Army Royal Arsenal in Lisbon and Oporto’s Royal Arsenal. Besides these places, the war supplies was also made by other industries such as the gun powder’s factories, foundries and textiles, according to Army contracts. In this written work, several perspectives are analysed concerning the Portuguese industry in the beginning of the 19th century. Previous studies on this matter are referred to and reasons for the industrial delay in this period are presented, which strongly affected the defence industries in Portugal. Facing serious political and economical conflicts in the beginning of the century, such as the Guerra das Laranjas and the Napolonic Wars that led to the French invasion, the Portuguese military industries were not able to present an effective and efficient answer to the army needs. Therefore, it was England that took the leading role in the reorganisation of the Portuguese Army investing large amounts of money and material. This support was achieved thanks to Sir Arthur Wellesley’s efforts who persuaded both the British and the Portuguese governments and his plan was accordingly followed by William Carr Beresford and Miguel Pereira Forjaz. Despite the Portuguese arsenals’ reorganisation in 1809 (soon after the period of the French domination from 1807 to 1808), these industries were not able to fulfill the basic needs of an army in campaign as far as the infantry light weaponry are concerned. Despite the enormous effort to manufacture large quantities of other materials, which were also important for the logistics, it was necessary to import arms, uniforms and tissues from England. This situation proves us that the Portuguese wool industries which were tremendously affected by the war were recovering very slowly. The arsenals were also facing old manufacture processes and fruitless attemps of new machinery and different mecanization systems. Facing the campaigns from 1807 to 1811, there were not opportunities to create modern and effective national industries because the arsenals were actually a kind of an intermediate warehouse for the large quantities of war material arriving from England which was sent afterwards to the countless units in campaign. Yet, all the people who worked countless hours during endless days in these old factory systems with severe organizational and technical problems, deserve to be remembered after 200 years of the Pensinsular War have passed.\n\nCOSTA, Maria Bertolina, Â«Liberdades SertaniasÂ» in MaranhÃ£o.

Regions like ParÃ¡, MaranhÃ£o, PiauÃ­, Bahia and Pernambuco, witnessed the first turmoil and the effects of the 1820 Revolution that unfolded in Portugal and would continue throughout the 19th century. To the common political vocabulary were added ancient words taking new meanings along with new terms, even though their meaning varied, depending on the events and the actors. A hot debate commences in the Luso-Brazilian world under the motto of liberal ideals and constitutionalism, one fueled by the ever-increasing circulation of leaflets, pamphlets and newspapers issued from Lisbon or printed in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, only to produce an explosive climate in MaranhÃ£o, ParÃ¡ and Pernambuco. From 1822, Brazil’s status as an independent nation as well as the need for some adjustments to the new political pact were perceived in MaranhÃ£o as a source of new opportunities, a moment for liberal ideals to be extolled. Meanwhile, Brazil was witnessing the emergence of contradictions within the broad constitutional spectrum. Confronted with arbitrary and despotic initiatives taken by the Portuguese liberals, the Brazilian political elite managed to join the growing animosity against the royal Courts, despite ideological differences among its groups; in their turn, the Courts interpreted such manifestations as a sign of opposition to the liberal ideology. As far as the elite of MaranhÃ£o is specifically concerned, constitutionalism would later evolve to become secessionism. The political emancipation of Brazil (1822) brought to light some different manners of combining tradition and political modernity in a unique way, which resulted in various projects and political activities shaped by the underlying opposition between the different social groups, and reflecting the different economic, political and racial interests. Newspapers became the vehicle whereby MaranhÃ£o’s Coimbra graduates launched discussion of ideas, criticism and complaints, in the context of the power struggle going on between liberals (Â«Bem-ti-visÂ») and the conservatives (Â«CabanosÂ») that resulted in the Balaiada upheaval. The political discourse emerging from these social outcasts combined a strong social content with the protests and the clichÃ©s typically used in liberal speech, and all of this was used in the Manifestos and revolutionary proclamations, like the 1824 “RevoluÃ§Ã£o Pernambucana” and the 1831 “Setembrada” in MaranhÃ£o. These were, therefore, the polarities that shaped the clashes in the historical process of the rebel movement in the Brazilian province of MaranhÃ£o, known as Â«Balaiada” (1838-1841).\n\nCOSTA, PatrÃ­cia Carla Rodrigues Mota da, Mineralogy, Geology, Metallurgy and Art of Mines in Industrial Education in the City of Oporto (1864-1974), PhD in Geology submitted to the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Pedro M. Callapez and Helder I.

This investigation intends to analyze the development of these areas of study at Escola do Porto and its eventual contribute to the scientific and technological progress in fields applied to industry, including the extractive and the transformation of raw material of geological origin. The industrial teaching in Portugal has been going through several structural and programs changes which accompanied consecutive policies decreed by central administration but also the scientific and technological progresses that have been registered in this area over more than 160 years. After a shy arise of industrial development and practical and applied teaching, promoted by the reformist vision of MarquÃªs de Pombal, a key figure of central administration between 1750 and 1777, the leaders of the first half of the XIX century were not capable of continuing his effort effectively. Therefore, the country by mid-eight hundreds did not have a modern industry working at full speed and qualified workers. The consecutive periods of conflict and political instability also contributed for this fact. With the creation of the MinistÃ©rio das Obras PÃºblicas, ComÃ©rcio e IndÃºstria on 30 August 1852, within the Regeneration, a new period of significant development of national economy began having as a major participant the minister Fontes Pereira de Melo. Previously, with the reforms that followed the definitive advent of Liberalism, there had also been created some schools directed for professional training but it was only at the end of 1852 that occurred the real start of industrial teaching in Portugal. The leaders of AssociaÃ§Ã£o Industrial Portuense had a great knowledge of the national industrial reality, and mainly of Porto city, so they anticipated the government and created their own industrial school called Escola Industrial Portuense in November 1852. Nevertheless, the state intervention did not take long and the industrial teaching became official with the Decree-Law of 30 December 1852, through which it were created the Instituto Industrial de Lisboa and Escola Industrial do Porto. The first global reform of the industrial teaching, in 1864, settled an important turnover at this instruction level. Porto School was named Instituto Industrial, as well as the Lisbon School, having been introduced new areas of study in the curricula (subjects of Mineralogy, Geology, Metallurgy and Mining), new courses (Mining Conductors, processed in three years, 1st class, and four years, 2nd class) and auxiliary facilities for teaching (laboratories and cabinets). The students training started to be composed by a theoretical field complemented by another of practical and experimental framework. Within the period being studied there were several teachers responsible for these subjects. We distinguish AntÃ³nio LuÃ­s Ferreira GirÃ£o, Manuel Rodrigues Miranda JÃºnior, JosÃ© Diogo Arroyo, Roberto Bellarmino do RosÃ¡rio Frias, Celestino Maia and Artur Mendes da Costa as some of the most important leadership of these areas at School during the period under analysis. The subjects suffered several reforms and changes according to the development of the industrial teaching and the contemporary needs of industry. Obviously, these factors influenced the syllabus contents of these subjects, changing also their names through the ages. At the beginning the area subjects only contemplated Mines, Docimasy and Metallurgy. With the 1886 reform there were introduced contents of Mineralogy and Geology in the course plans, maintaining a separated path until 1974. The recommended manuals were also a reference source to understand the adopted theories and the influence of the French school and its translations. Practice was associated to the cabinets and laboratories were experiments were performed and other works, not forgetting the field visits with the aim of making the students became aware of the epoch industrial reality. The first auxiliary teaching facility created for these areas was the Mineralogy Cabinet, following the Mines Art Cabinet, the Metallurgical Laboratory and the Natural History Cabinet. For a more efficient learning the practice was performed based on specimens, models, instruments, parietal tables and maps, acquired mainly abroad, in specialized shops worldwide recognized such as Les Fils d’Ãmile Deyrolle (Paris), F. Krantz (Bona), Theodor Gerdorf (Freiberg) or J. Digeon (Paris), allowing to draw the history of learning of Geological Sciences, Mining Engineering and Metallurgical Engineering and associated to the history of industrial teaching in Portugal. In short, the presence of this kind of collections shows an advance scientific knowledge and a share of ideas and technics which allowed a country like Portugal to develop the industrial teaching having as a reference the nations more technological developed such as England, France or Germany. The creation of the industrial teaching in Portugal established therefore an important step on the development of the country, at a time in which the industry and the communication means were fully growing and, with a higher traveling facility, the share of knowledge was becoming inevitable. Therefore, and with over more than 160 years of history, the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and its several collections (museological, documental and bibliographic) are an inevitable reference for the comprehension of the development of teaching in Porto city and in Portugal.\n\nCOUTINHO, LourenÃ§o Nobre da Veiga Pereira, The King in the “RegeneraÃ§Ã£o” period: Constitutional powers and political practice (1852-1885), PhD in History: Change and Continuity in a Global World (PIUDHist - Inter-university Doctoral Programme in History) submitted to the Faculty of Human Sciences of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by JosÃ© Miguel Pereira Alcobio Palma Sardica, 2018\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The doctorate thesis titled “O Rei na RegeneraÃ§Ã£o: Poderes constitucionais e prÃ¡tica politica (1852-1885)” (The King in the “RegeneraÃ§Ã£o” period: Constitutional powers and political practice: 1852-1885) is aimed at identifying and understanding the role assigned to and played by the constitutional Kings during the historic period of the “RegeneraÃ§Ã£o”, that is, from 1852, the year of the Additional Act which translated the goals of the political movement borne out of the field marshall Duke of Saldanha's pronunciamento (military declaration, 1851), up until 1885, the year of approval of the Additional Act that limited the responsibilities of the moderating power and laid down the conditions to foster the rotating alternation of two major governing parties: the “Regenerador” and the “Progressista” (Regenerator and Progressive parties). The dissertation is divided into two main parts. Part I focuses on the evolving theories about the royal powers since the old regime until the liberal era, and looks into how the three monarchic constitutions dealt with those powers. In its turn, Part II consists of an interpretative analysis of the major political events that took place during the reigns included in said chronological period, mostly those in which the King made use of the important prerogatives entrusted to the moderating power. Finally, the author seeks to respond to the questions that guided the thesis itself: What was the King's role during the time of the liberal regeneration? Did the King stand as a factor of political stability or of political instability during the period under analysis? Overall, the conclusion is that the King, while never forgoing the wide-ranging powers conferred upon him by the Constitutional Charter, exercised a wise and sensible interpretation of the same and, during a political period lacking other strong constitutional references, stood as the guarantor of institutional balance and political stability.\n\nCOUVANEIRO, JoÃ£o LuÃ­s Serrenho FrazÃ£o, The Higher School of Letters (1861-1911): in the beginnings of Human Sciences in Portugal, PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by SÃ©rgio Campos Matos, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/7500)\n\nKeywords: Higher Education; Humanities; Social Sciences; Academic Prosopography\n\nAbstract: Opened in 1861, the Higher School of Letters was the first establishment in Portugal that specifically targeted the higher education in History, Philosophy and Literary Studies. The consolidation process of this institution was slow, but its legacy was indelible and persisted well beyond 1911, when the Faculty of Letters of the Universidade de Lisboa was created, which was its continuer, more than its heir. The focus of this dissertation is to systematize the characteristics, the curricular structures and the pedagogical tendencies of the Higher School of Letters, relating them to the cultural, social, political and economical contexts that determined them. The Higher School of Letters had the responsibility to prepare the young students for University, and to train teachers for the secondary schools and candidates for public administration. Thus, it assumed a dual function, joining the scientific and professional education. I tried to understand to which extent the institution fulfilled its goals and contributed to the improvement of the education system and to the training of qualified personnel. The professors and the students of the Higher School of Letters that could be counted among the illustrious Portuguese names of Science, Literature and Politics were numerous. They were relevant in their era and influenced the subsequent generations. Socially characterising the student population and outlining the social functions this institution had, with this research I also tried to focus on the relationship between the higher education of the Humanities and Social Sciences and the formation of the Elites, the consolidation of the liberal State, and the construction of the identity.\n\nCRIVELENTE, Maria AmÃ©lia Assis Alves, A Place for Valentim: “... in the states of Brazil”.

In order to achieve this goal, we evaluated the reception of the foreign forensic psychiatric science in our country; defended the uniqueness of the Portuguese case, particularly through the protagonism of JÃºlio de Matos; studied, in the considered chronological period, case studies of the use of “defence of insanity” in some of the aforementioned author’s works, as well as in the Archives of University of Coimbra, the Institutes of Legal Medicine of Coimbra and Lisbon, and Torre do Tombo. This work is divided into two parts. In the first part we contextualized the International History of Forensic Psychiatry, especially with regard to Europe, investigating its reception in Portugal, mainly through the originality of JÃºlio de Matos. We also studied the issue of psychiatric care legislation and regulations, promulgated between the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century in our country, which decreed the measures to be taken as to the destiny of insane criminals. In this context, we sought to understand the utopian dimension of such legislation which, despite the changes brought by the establishment of the Republic, kept presenting a great inconsistency between what was written and what was practiced. In the second part, we studied, in general, the cases of the use of “defence of insanity” examined by the Coimbra’s Medico Legal Council, between 1900 and 1926, which were researched at the Archives of University of Coimbra and the Institute of Legal Medicine of Coimbra. Among them, we selected five for an in depth analysis, preserving however, the identity of such individuals, by using the initial letters of their names. Furthermore, we also investigated three relevant case studies that figured prominently in the media at the time: Rodrigo de Barros Teixeira dos Reis, who murdered Sousa Refoios in 1905 (this case was complemented with the files that we found at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Coimbra), Lieutenant Aparicio Rebelo dos Santos, who killed Miguel Bombarda in 1910 (case complemented with the files researched at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Lisbon and the information gathered in the Archive of Torre do Tombo); JosÃ© Julio da Costa, the murder SidÃ³nio Pais in 1918 (case complemented with information found at the Archive of Torre do Tombo).\n\nCRUZ, Isabel Maria Neves da, From the Practice of Chemistry to Practical Chemistry: development of the practice of chemistry in the Portuguese curricula (1852-1889), PhD in History and Philosophy of Science submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Mariana de Jesus Valente and Ana LuÃ­sa Janeira, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/17568)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Since practice is “the act or effect of practising”, “application”, “execution” it is understood as practice of chemistry, the act of practicing, applicating or executing Chemistry. In Portugal, there were signs that in several scientific educational institutions, they tried to follow the teaching model oriented to the lab which was created by Liebig, when in 1872, the chemist AntÃ³nio Augusto de Aguiar (1838 - 1887) funded, in the Industrial and Commercial Institute of Lisbon, the teaching of Practical Chemistry, act which was without precedents in this country. This study, intends to clarify the concept of Practical Chemistry, based on the example of the Course created by AntÃ³nio Augusto de Aguiar and through this concept, understand and interpret the development of the Chemistry practice in the Portuguese curricula from 1852 to 1889.\n\nDAMAS, Carlos Alberto de Oliveira, The Baron of Rendufe and nineteenth century liberalism: the politician and the diplomat, 1820-1848, PhD in History submitted to the History, Arts and Humanities Department of the Universidade AutÃ³noma de Lisboa, supervised by JosÃ© Maria Amado Mendes and LuÃ­s JosÃ© Rodrigues LeitÃ£o TomÃ©, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/11144/2986)\n\nKeywords: XIX century; Liberalism; Diplomacy; International Relations; Biographic History; Prussia; Spain; France\n\nAbstract: This PhD. thesis focuses on the historical biography of SimÃ£o da Silva Ferraz de Lima e Castro (1795-1857) who, from 1821 to 1841, held in Lisbon the positions of Corregidor, Intendant of the Police, Deputy and Senator and, between 1842 and 1848, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Portugal in Berlin, Madrid and Paris. This biographical history contextualizes and problematizes the individual activity of a State agent, exercised in a transition from the absolutist to the constitutionalist regime, identifying the crucial role of their actions and relate them with political, economic and geographical strategies of Portugal. In the reconstitution of his career is scrutinized his view of the world to understand what role he played in the political element of the time. Following an analysis proper to highlight the more significant facts emerging from the intersection of the Foreign Affairs archives of Prussia, Spain and Portugal, accompanied by the study of the political system and characters that inhabit the phenomena, contextualizing the facts to quest the regularities trend detected in the missions. Placed in the context of the most relevant events to understand of the social and political process, developed in contexts that are determined or influenced by the political, economic, social, cultural and financial, national and international ones, the results of the research allow to conclude on the importance of the study of the individual activities that, analysed in a micro history perspective, can contribute to a more concrete vision of historical events of the first half of the XIX century.\n\nDORES, Hugo GonÃ§alves, A Mission for the Empire: Missionary Politics and the “New Imperialism” (1885-1926), PhD in History: Change and Continuity in a Global World (PIUDHist - Inter-university Doctoral Programme in History) submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Costa Pinto, Miguel Bandeira JerÃ³nimo and AntÃ³nio Manuel Antunes de Matos Ferreira, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/15606)\n\nKeywords: Portugal; Africa; Mission; Colonial empire; Missionary policy; Concordat; Protestantism; Portuguese Republic; Holy See; International Law\n\nAbstract: This study intends to understand the historical process of the constitution of a missionary policy in the Portuguese colonial empire, in a period marked by an increasing internationalization of religious and missionary issues in imperial and international contexts, with the affirmation of missionary freedom and religious tolerance as fundamental principles in the European “civilizational” work in the African colonial spaces. The analysis of the complexity of a process that relates “mission” and “empire”, in their multiple historical expressions and geographical manifestations is based on three main dimensions which were essential to the debate undertaken by the actors of the time: the Catholic dimension, with the centrality of the Patronage question and the pursuit of a concordatory solution as an auxiliary to the consolidation of Portuguese imperial sovereignty in Africa; the Protestant dimension, seen as a “threat” to the empire, addressing the perceptions formed over its character as “heretical”, and specially, as “foreigner”, which were crucial to the Portuguese rhetoric; he Republican dimension, with the ups and downs of the definition of a nationalizing missionary policy and the limits of the applicability of a particularly notable ideological legislative strategy. Covering the period from the Berlin Conference (1885) to the publication of the Statute of JoÃ£o Belo (1926), this study aims to assess the place of the Portuguese missionary project in the historical dynamics of the “new imperialism”, focusing on the historical events and processes that promoted and conditioned the formulation of a missionary policy in the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa.\n\nDUARTE, Rui Manuel Costa Fiadeiro, SebastiÃ£o Sanhudo: press, humor, caricature and Oporto from the second half of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, PhD in Heritage Studies submitted to the School of Arts of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by GonÃ§alo Mesquita da Silveira de Vasconcelos e Sousa and Laura Lucinda de Oliveira Castro, 2015\n\n(http://hdl.handle.net/10400.14/20509)\n\nKeywords: History of the press; History of humor; History of caricature; History of Porto; History of the historic cafÃ©s of Porto; Lithography; Caricature; SebastiÃ£o Sanhudo\n\nAbstract: This research has the desideratum to promote an insight into SebastiÃ£o Sampaio de Sousa Sanhudo and its heterogeneous work as a caricaturist, lithographer and publisher. To achieve that we started from the general to the particular, in order to better portrait his life and his vast production. In the first chapter we synthesize a history of the press, focusing on the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. We registered this art’s multiple advances, or setbacks, generated over time, for this is the medium used to shape general or specific issues - in particular with regard to humorous illustrated publications and aperiodic titles of solidarity and humanistic character in which the author intervened. The second chapter sheds a comprehensive study on the entire history of humor in general and caricature in particular. We seek to portrait the art of humor in illustrated humor journalism by inserting it into a broader plan, comparing it with all the areas where humor was spread, over time, in order to fully understand its position and relevance. The third chapter presents an historical insight of the city of Porto - through its social, commercial, economic, cultural, health and hygiene, historical and sociological changes, the urban novelties and those generated by material progress, and the coeval experience of its people and the city’s institutions -, revealing a great part of what constituted the city, perhaps still preserved till nowadays as unique or very genuine. In this chapter we also include what could be considered as the most updated research, systematization and study of the historic cafÃ©s of Porto, in all its aspects, given their vast social relevance. The last chapter elaborates a survey on the life and works of SebastiÃ£o Sanhudo. We follow his life, education and activity as an industrial lithographer, attesting the relevance and uniqueness of his craftsmanship. He was indeed one of the most authentic portraitists and lithographers of his time. We also scrutinize all the vast, and ill-assorted, artistic production of the man that edited one of the very few longest-lived humorous illustrated periodicals, analyzing each of its productions, revealing its capital importance and prominence in the panorama of illustrated humor and caricature in Portugal.\n\nESTEVES, Alexandra PatrÃ­cia Lopes, Between Crime and Prison: Violence and Marginality in the Alto Minho (1732-1870), PhD in History: Contemporary History submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho, supervised by Maria Marta Lobo de AraÃºjo, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/11894)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The aim of this work is to characterize the violence, the criminality and the role of gaols in Alto Minho, round the years between the end of the Ancient Regime and 1870’s. Due to the extent and complexity of the task it was divided in three parts, always keeping in mind its tight connections. In the first part we have tried to understand and describe the violence affecting the rural communities in the district of Viana do Castelo. We aimed to discover and understand the particularities of this district, to learn the daily lives of its inhabitants, to identify the most important spaces and moments of conviviality and the grounds of more harsh behaviours. Violent behaviours mean not only physical aggression, but also the use and impact of words, so we took it in account as an instrument of offence in the society of Alto Minho. In the second part we have drawn a view of the crimes commited in the district of Viana do Castelo, according to offences against people, against the property or the State, against the public order or security, as well as the reasons impelling to criminal behaviour. Side by side with a non-planned criminality, almost spontaneous, there was another, organized and pre-thought, which took advantage of the political instability which characterized the first half of the XIX century in Alto Minho. It was led by gangs of brigands and robbers, filling with terror the inhabitants and the authorities. We have studied the leaders of those mobs and their ‘modus operandi’ mainly those who reached some notoriety. As Galiza stands close to Alto Minho we also learned about the role of the inhabitants of this Spanish country district in the crimes commited as well as the interest and the treatment that the press from the region paid to criminal activities. In the third part we have studied the jails and their awful conditions that made imprisonment more painful for the condemned, either men and women or children. These jails were rather places of punishment leaving out any chance of regeneration for the convicted. In order to confirm this statement we have studied the jails of Alto Minho, focusing our attention on the living conditions of those imprisoned, their daily lives and the role of authorities. By then, prisons were usually the destination for the poor or the delinquent of the society, so generating and worsening their poverty. For that reason we have also analysed the role of the State in order to mitigate the misery and help those in prison and the ‘MisericÃ³rdias’ as charitable institutions.\n\nFAUSTINO, JosÃ© Alfredo Paulo, The population of town of Chaves between 1780 and 1880, PhD in History: Historical Demography submitted to the Institute of Social Sciences of the Universidade do Minho supervised by Carlota Santos and Maria Norberta Simas Bettencourt Amorim, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/1822/35661)\n\nKeywords: Chaves; TrÃ¡s-os-Montes; Demography; Population; Society\n\nAbstract: This study analyzes the evolution of the demographic behavior of an urban parish of TrÃ¡s-os-Montes, a former military square, bordering Galicia, the town of Chaves, between 1780 and 1880. In this process, we used the parish sources (records of baptism, marriage and death), which are stored in the District Archives of Vila Real. In turn, the methodology of 'Reconstitution of Parishes' enabled us to organize the information acquired from the parochial registries in a demographic \"database\", using genealogical patterns of the residents in the town of Chaves. From this \"database\", we observe the evolution of the different demographic variables of nuptiality, fertility and mortality, as well as their influences on population equilibrium at a certain level of growth. As an important urban center of TrÃ¡s-os-Montes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Chaves had a desirable economic and social dynamism, characterized by the intense flow of people and goods coming from other parts of TrÃ¡s-os-Montes, from Minho, and even from Galicia. Moreover, its strategic borderland position in the northern part of the country, regularly accommodated over 2000 military personnel who had a remarkable impact in local demographics. All these factors have transformed this old burg in a converging place of the most diverse people whose significant milestones were recorded in distinct parochial registries, mainly on the occasion of marriage and death. In fact, the influence of geographical mobility is very significant in all other socio-demographic behaviors. The lack of the existence of specific sources presented us with an indirect approach to its study which was based on ‘entries’ at the time of celebration of marriage and at the individual's place of residence at the time of death. The study of mortality was also affected by the lack of a systematic recording of the mortality of children under seven years of age, until 1850, thus precluding the longitudinal approach of the levels of mortality and life expectancy of ‘flavienses’. However, the analysis of the actual mortality crisis, considered by some as the regulatory variable of the demographics of the Old Regime, deserved our special mention, eventually revealing the specific features of the history of this population. This study provides evidence of a demographic 'system' characterized by an early age at first marriage for both women and for men, a persistent definitive celibacy, increased medium protogenesic and intergenesic intervals, and consequently, low rates of legitimate fertility, contrasting with a high rate of illegitimacy and a large number of illegitimate children. Simultaneously, we compared the various indicators obtained from each variable with other parishes already studied, among which, rural CalvÃ£o of this county, and urban GuimarÃ£es.\n\nFERNANDES, Paula Guilhermina de Carvalho, Work and accommodation in Oporto at the end of the Old Regime.

The methodology included synchronous and longitudinal analysis based on censuses (between 1800 and 1832-33), aimed at shuttling between the general and the particular. Customs movement and migrations were examined in the exploration of the economic and social integration of Porto in the various regions. The results revealed traditional trends (but also various emergencies), in the habitat, which was thoroughly characterized, as well as in major socio-economic traits. Porto maintains a standard of modern society - craft production and a heavy social stratum without occupational designation, which nearly double the number of trade-related people and triple those linked to restaurant services, personal services, security and related tasks. Developments in the labor structure in the period indicate increase in the latter group as well as professional and technical workers, emerging signs of contemporaneity. In production, there is a diversification of crafts and a decline of those more traditional in favor of those with demand, such as textiles. Social geography reveals change, moving from the river to the north, east and west, redesigning the meanings of the city. There are signs of dynamism in migration movements and even in customs, with a corroborative behavior of the notion that Porto would have made recovery business and circuits relatively soon after the beginning of century crisis.\n\nFERREIRA, Carla Maria Sequeira, The Upper Douro between free trade and protectionism: the Â«Douro wine issueÂ» in the national economy, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Jorge Fernandes Alves and Gaspar Martins Pereira, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/50418)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The present Doctoral thesis in History aims to understand the conditions and mechanisms of transition from the protectionist model of State intervention to the liberal regime, as well as the return to regulatory measures for the wine sector, the economic basis of the Douro demarcated region, between the ‘RegeneraÃ§Ã£o’ period and the beginning of the ‘Estado Novo’ (1852-1932). The economic, social and institutional evolution of Douro region over the period considered is characterized, as well as the interests at play and the degree of conflict the with other Portuguese winegrowing regions and other economic agents brought on by the wine sector issue, raised by the ‘questÃ£o vinhateira’. An analysis is conducted of the consequences of the liberal legislation and the regional demands for State intervention, which developed from the mid-1870s and persisted for several decades, at a time of agricultural and commercial crisis leading to continuous political and social unrest. The research intends to understand the different strategies implemented to bolster regional production in relation to the commercial sector, in the search for solutions to the Â«Douro issueÂ» (viticulturist and commercial associativism, defence of the Â«regional brandÂ», demand for legislative proposals). The debates between free traders and protectionists on the wine sector issue affected not only the Douro region but the country as whole, from Governments and political groups in Parliament to economic interest groups. They ultimately reveal the political and economic forces at play, and we seek to determine the degree of influence regional clienteles came to have on the decisions taken by central power, both in implementing the liberal model as well as in terms of the new forms of regulation.\n\nFERREIRA, JoÃ£o Pedro Rosa, Correcting by laughter. Humor in Portuguese periodical press (1797-1835), PhD in History and Theory of Ideas submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by JoÃ£o LuÃ­s Lisboa, 2018\n\n(http://hdl.handle.net/10362/43440)\n\nKeywords: History of ideas; Cultural history; History of reading and publishing; Periodical press; Humor studies; Public opinion; Eighteenth to nineteenth centuries\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this thesis is to explore the impact of humorous processes on the emergence of modern Portugal, from the onset of the systematic use of those processes in the periodical press, from the publication of Almocreve de Petas (1797-1800) to the issue of O Quinquilheiro in 1835, shortly after the Portuguese civil war. Humor in the periodical press is analyzed from an interdisciplinary perspective and its targets are identified in their political, social and cultural contexts. The nuanced approach allows showing the role of humor in the crystallization and integration of the otherness of its targets - as a phenomenon of the new and the different becomes a butt of a joke its otherness is being acknowledged, thus making the discovery of alterity in the diversity possible. Amongst other aspects under study is the role of humor in the building of public opinion and in the insertion of Portugal in the Western European cultural crossroads. Concurrently, the role of reading and publishing in the global processes of affirmation of written culture and the circulation of periodicals in the European and Transatlantic space are explored. The research also looks into the boundaries of humor and the fine lines between the licit and the illicit, truth and falsehood, serious and risible, as well as oral and written humor forms. Finally, the work is intended to discern the place of humor in the development of printed communication in Portugal during the transition from Absolutism to the Liberal state and to grasp the social and political contradictions of humor in that period.\n\nFERREIRA, Jorge Eurico GonÃ§alves de Sousa, The Mission and the Action of the Portuguese Military Nurses (From the Restoration War to the Great War), PhD in Nursing: History and Philosophy of Nursing submitted to the Institute of Health Sciences of Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa, supervised by Margarida Maria da Silva Vieira, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.14/12371)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Following a path of Historical research which has a logical, rational, discursive nature, we try to find out what the mission and action of the Portuguese nurses was, since 1640 until 1918 - since the Restoration War until the end of the Great War. In 1642 King D. JoÃ£o IV decides that the number of nurses in the Hospitals and “MisericÃ³rdias” must be enough and establishes a portable hospital that could attend the army during campaigns. Thus, we accept the hypothesis that nurses could be in the front line taking care of the sick and injured soldiers. We also accept the hypothesis that the Military Royal Hospitals followed the norms and standards recommended by S. JoÃ£o de Deus regarding the patients separation according to the nature of disease, the change of bed linen and pyjamas and the hospital’s wards ventilation, because this was the practice of the religious brothers and are present in their norms. The first known Portuguese written document for the teaching of nurses is dated 1741 and was written by Father Frei Diogo de Santiago of S. JoÃ£o de Deus Order, and was entitled “Religious Postilla and Art of Nursing”. Through the documental analysis we accept the hypothesis that the teaching nurses was effective during the XVIIIth century. We also accept the hypothesis of existing principles that guide nursing at the present time, such as caring foundations, the need of through knowledge regarding the patient health condition, the register of activities, and the concerns about security in medicine administration, as well as the need of nurses respect their competence area. With these Frei Diogo’s de Santiago advices, we accept the hypothesis that time nurses already had their own competence area in the provision of health care. During the Peninsular War, military nurses had already some kind of training/education since the military hospitals should be organized in a way that they might become “real Schools of Surgical Medicine” - in which health minor officials should be trained, so they could be useful to themselves and to the Royal Service. Thus, all the Major, Ordinary and Supernumerary nurses would be withdraw from Assistant Surgeons. This training/education continued in the Army and later in the Navy. Through the analysis of the different health military services regulations, we confirm the hypothesis that there was a progressive loss of the autonomy regarding health care over the centuries we studied.\n\nFERREIRA, Jorge Miguel Quintino Gomes, From Seismicity to the Science of Earthquakes: For the History of Seismology in Portugal, PhD in History and Philosophy of Science submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Augusto JosÃ© dos Santos Fitas, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/11401)\n\nKeywords: History of science in Portugal; History of seismology; Public dimension; Seismicity\n\nAbstract: Historically and by instrumental observation, we can record earthquakes with some frequency in the country territory, more often in the South area and in Azores and occasionally with catastrophic consequences. By scientific and technical repercussions we can highlight two of them: Lisbon 1755, by the questionnaire nationwide distributed (a systematic survey of the destructive consequences), by the idea of wave propagation within the earth of the vibration arising from a seismic source (communication to the Royal Society), and by the measures in seismic prevention adopted in the reconstruction of Lisbon; and Benavente 1909, by the need of a seismological service, whose organization national authorities (partially) accomplished only in 1946 with the foundation of the ServiÃ§o MeteorolÃ³gico Nacional. This work is a study in history of the science of earthquakes and in history of seismology, in Portugal, from 1755 until mid-twentieth century, emphasizing the relationship between the seismicity (seismic events), the impact on public opinion, the march of scientific knowledge, and consequent development of the science of earthquakes.\n\nFERREIRA, Nuno Alexandre Martins, The institutionalization of nautical education in Portugal (1779-1807), PhD in History: History of the Discoveries and Expansion submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Francisco Contente Domingues, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/10963)\n\nKeywords: Nautical Teaching; XVIIIth and XIXth Centuries; Cosmographer-in-chief; Academies\n\nAbstract: The aim of this thesis is to study the institutionalization of nautical teaching in Portugal between 1779, the year of creation of the Royal Marine Academy, and in 1807, the transfer of the Court to Brazil. In the second half of the 18th century, the changes in nautical teaching emerged within the education reform initiated by King Joseph I and developed by his daughter, Mary I. The cosmographer-in-chief lesson disappeared to give place to a more professional structure enhanced by the emergence of academies, created specifically for this purpose, which would be the precursor of polytechnic education in Portugal. The first step in pilotage teaching was given in Oporto with the creation of a nautical class in 1762 and later on with the appearance in Lisbon of the Royal Marine Academy (1779) and the Royal Marine Guards Academy (1782) and, in Oporto, of the Royal Academy of Marine and Commerce (1803). In addition to the cities of Metropolis, by the early years of the 19th century the Portuguese nautical teaching already knew a geography that extended to the State of India and Brazil. The first part will present the context of the changes of nautical teaching according with the reforms of the second half of the 18th century, especially the end of the cosmographer-in-chief lesson and of the Sphere Class, and the reform of the Universidade de Coimbra. The second part is dedicated to the creation of the academies, their curricula, teachers, and dynamic operation. Finally, in this part, we present the issue of duplication or fusion of the academies of Lisbon and the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazilian colony, a fact that would influence the structuring of the nautical teaching in the early decades of the XIXth century.\n\nFIGUEIREDO, JoÃ£o de Castro Maia Veiga de, Politics, Slavery and Witchcraft in Angola (18th and 19th Centuries), PhD in History: Empire, Politics and Postcolonialism submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Fernando Catroga, 2016 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/29906)\n\nKeywords: Slavery; Fetish; History of Angola; Historical anthropology\n\nAbstract: This dissertation proposes to trace the variation of political attitudes towards feitiÃ§aria [sorcery/witchcraft] beliefs, from the middle of the 18th until the end of the 19th century. From Portuguese colonial agents to the innumerous local petty elites involved in the successive projects of economic exploration of the Angolan hinterland, a large number of case studies will be taken into account, demonstrating an underlying continuity amid change: there was always a strict correlation between a given attitude towards feitiÃ§aria, and the position of its author towards the slave trade. With this in mind, the approach adopted in this investigation combines methods from Cultural History, Historical Anthropology, and Symmetric Anthropology. From this eclectic choice of heuristic methods, ensues a dissertation which has a number of chapters with the History of Colonial Law and Administration as its backbone, intermingled with a number of others, which deal mostly with issues situated within the domains of Anthropology, Cultural and Social History, History of Art, History of Science, Literary Studies, and Sociology. We thus hope to prove that, besides the strict correlation between slavery and political stances towards feitiÃ§aria beliefs, another conclusion can be reached: as the arguments in favor of the maintenance of forced labor in the colony became increasingly based in “naturalist” and “racialist” “proofs”, and the previous history of cultural and sociological contact between Portuguese colonial agents and black African populations was forgotten, a progressive subordination of the African locals was accompanied by a concomitant demise of Portuguese international hegemony.\n\nFINA, Rosa Maria Canarim Rodrigues, The idea of night in portuguese culture (XVIIIth to XXth centuries), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by JosÃ© Eduardo Franco, AntÃ³nio Ventura and Roger Ekirch, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/25043)\n\nKeywords: Night; Society; Urban History; Enlightenment; Fin-de-siÃ¨cle; Cultural History\n\nAbstract: This thesis aims to study the night in the Portuguese culture between the eighteenth and early twentieth century. Such temporal and conceptual scope requires a structured and well-argued work. Thus moving us in the field of Portuguese cultural history, we intend to determine, in the first part, the concept of night at its mythological and foundational nature in general European culture then in particular the Portuguese, necessarily going through the popular traditions and superstitions. Then we light our historical focus on the eighteenth and nineteenth century Lisbon and study the nocturnal social and cultural environments and how they were changing over the centuries. We contemplate, in the city after the earthquake, the European Enlightenment influence, Pombal deed as well as specific urban changes such as law enforcement and later the controversial appearance of public lighting. During the nineteenth century, the social models were up carving in its difference as well as night time experiences, which, through a growing number of theaters and other distractions, are utterly reconciled with the street. In another path, we recovered in our dissertation fourth part the symbolic and metaphorical concept of the night and look through this lens at the Portuguese literature of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, trying to appraise some of the most important authors. In a similar vein, though once again extending the scope to European culture, we reflect on the concept of power and pessimism - which we consider a twentieth century characteristic - considering either concept in its correlation with the night.\n\nGAMEIRO, Fernando LuÃ­s, Elites and Education.

Firstly, it characterises the European context in which modern teaching systems emerged and it focuses on the analysis of the processes of segmentation that separate classic and technical teaching. It reviews literature on Portuguese educational reformism, centred on classic and technical teaching. Secondly, it analyses the process of segmentation in Ãvora, capital of a region that is characterised by agriculture, which is essentially extensive and commercial, home to the education institutions our study focuses on: the Liceu and the Industrial School. Thirdly, school facilities are characterised; then, public behaviour of educators, namely that of headmasters and teachers, highlighting their public intervention; it characterises the demand in these institutions - the emphasis is placed on geographic mobility, considering students' birthplace and their parents' residence; a study on students' backgrounds and parents' occupational profiles is carried out. Eventually, the academic and professional itineraries of Liceu students' are reconstituted, within the formerly described chronological arch.\n\nGRAES, Isabel, From the Supreme Court of Justice to the deconstruction of judiciary in the 19th century, PhD in Law: Legal History submitted to the Faculty of Law of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Pedro Barbas Homem, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/5155)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nKOROBTCHENKO, JÃºlia Platonovna, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Administrative Reform and the Social Body (1834-1910), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Adriano AscensÃ£o Pires Ventura and Ana Maria Homem Leal de Faria, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/33403)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal - the object of our study - suffered a great transformation with the advent of the Constitutional Monarchy (1834-1910). The effort to modernize, and to assume the implementation of the modern/rational administrative system led to a legislative effort of administrative reform. This process was characterized by the reorganization of the organic and functional structure of the Secretariat of State, by the functional specialization, the bureaucratization of the dispatch system, the organization of the personnel boards and professional career within the institution, the professionalization (meritocracy) and the organization of the foreign network of diplomatic legations and consulates. The transition process of the internal organic structure of the Secretariat of State from a horizontal model of subsequent departments, organized by a geographical logic, gave place to a hierarchical structure in a vertical model, divided in two great thematic areas of work: the General Department of Politics and Diplomacy and the General Department of Commerce and Consular Affairs. These two General Departments were later also subdivided in sub-departments and sections. This way it was evidenced the functional specialization and labor division. The board of personnel was organized by a hierarchic model classified by class and categories, multiplying the levels of career ascension, and resulting in the emergence of a professional career. One of the most important measures introduced was the meritocratic model of recruitment based on a public service exam. From the model of public administration management, we took on the fundamental question, and ultimate function of the institution, which is the administration of the Foreign Policy. The network of diplomatic legations and consulates was adapted to the necessities of the century of economic, technologic, ideologic and commercial progress. Portugal, as an integral part of the European model in expansion, in a period of high imperialism shaped its external representation to its own constraints and national interests. On one hand, Portugal lived a severe economic and final crisis, on the other hand there was a need to defend the patrimonial, historic and geopolitical heritage and, at the same, the will to be integrated in the international community, in the concert of Europe. Diplomacy and its executive corps (diplomatic corps) was in tune with the political, social and economic transformations of the XIXth century. Without losing its aristocratic composition, this social corps redefined its own identity. Come into play factors, not only, of social status, but also, of political interests. It is without a doubt a social elite at the service of the constitutional regime in which the ideals of the old aristocracy (already shattered during the XVIII century) give way to a new titular nobility, with the possibility of social ascension by the diplomatic service. The diplomatic field, during this time, had a very strong connection to the political and administrative elite. The diplomats were present at the benches of Parliament, fought in the war for the interests of their country and maintained closely linked to the law, judiciary and humanities fields. Several high political personalities went into the diplomatic practice and, vice-versa, the diplomats were appointed to ministerial and governmental positions. Notwithstanding, the process of professionalization lead to the emergence of the career diplomat with a path from the recruitment to promotion to a higher rank, with rights to temporary leave, fixed income and retirement. In this manner, we present a study of the institutional organization and personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the scope of almost a century, focusing in the aspects of transition into the modernity.\n\nLEAL, Manuel Maria Cardoso, Party rotation in Portugal: the learning of political alternation (c.1860-1890), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Ernesto Castro Leal, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/24291)\n\nKeywords: Liberalism; Political parties; Conservatives-Progressists; Right-Left; Rotation (Rotativismo)/Alternance; Constitutional Monarchy; Public Opinion\n\nAbstract: This thesis aims mainly to understand how the first party system was built in Portugal and how it evolved into the rotation of two parties, in the period between 1860 and 1890. That rotation was assured between two moderate parties, one conservative and another progressist, or one center-right wing and another center-left wing, both obeying the basic political rules. But it consisted of a constant strife between a party inspired by an unitarian spirit and another party wishing to assert an alternative. In the 1850’s there were some governmental transitions, driven by the king, between the same political forces of future rotation; but this was really accomplished in the end of the 1870’s, boosted by the public opinion, not only by the king. The general acceptance of the rotation principle that was reached in the 1880’s meant a victory of bipartidism over one party’s predominance. The rotation of 1860-1890 was more than a symbol of Portuguese Constitutional Monarchy; it was also part of general evolution of representative systems in Europe.\n\nLEITE, Rita Alexandra Borda de Ãgua MendonÃ§a, Text and authority: Sociocultural and religious diversification with the Biblical Society in Portugal (1804-1940), PhD in History and Culture of Religions submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Manuel Antunes de Matos Ferreira and JosÃ© Augusto Martins Ramos, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/29992)\n\nKeywords: Authority; Bible; Colporteurs; Religious competition; Bible Society\n\nAbstract: In the transition of modernity, between the 18th and 19th centuries, the reference to the Bible played a role on the expansion of Christianity, being a differentiation factor between the currents that existed and those which emerged meanwhile. A part of that history was promoted by the Bible Societies which appeared in that period. The object of this thesis is the appreciation of the complex process of implantation of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) in Portugal and the analysis of the Bible dissemination problematic as well as of the cultural impact imposed by the prosecution of this project. Thereafter, a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of that institution was pursued, not only within its limits, but also regarding the shaping of its goals and their pursuit within the context of the Portuguese society. This process is analysed from the foundation of the BFBS (1804) to the first Portuguese Bible Congress (1940). With its programme of dissemination of the Bible, which was supported by the development of an extensive network of collaborators, by the establishment of an Agency in Lisbon, by the implementation of the colportage system and by the establishment of the “Bible DepÃ´ts”, the BFBS led a pioneer action in the Portuguese society, developing its work in a specific field of confrontation of legitimacies, namely the liberty to publish, the free access to the biblical text in vernacular languages, and the right to publish several Bible versions in the same language. In that sense, the history of the Bible Society allows us to monitor a dynamic of circulation within the Portuguese society which, in spite of being centred around the edition of the biblical texts, goes beyond the religious field, precisely because that sacred text tended, by its nature, to enhance dynamics of conflict. Indeed, the Bible introduced important concepts such as those of Truth and Authority in the cultural debate and led them to be confronted them with those of Liberty and Consciousness, which were differently perceived, combined and opposed by the various receivers of that biblical message and advocates and opposers of that project. The trajectory of the Bible Society in Portugal and its Bible dissemination programme were an active part of the process of religious recomposition which took place in the 19th and 20th centuries in the country. During that period the Bible Society promoted the first Christian interfaith and evangelical interdenominational experiences in Portugal and constituted itself as a benchmark of frontier between those who appropriated themselves of its action in order to promote the protestantization of the country and those in the catholic field who opposed that project basing themselves in the specific relationship of the roman Catholicism with the Bible and in the hegemonic position that same church had in the Portuguese religious and cultural context. Actively intervening in that differentiation process, the role of the Bible Society also developed itself in the extensive complexification of the religious system which was part of the construction of the liberal society in Portugal.\n\nLEONARDO, AntÃ³nio JosÃ© Fontoura, The Institute of Coimbra and the Evolution of Physics and Chemistry in Portugal from 1852 to 1952, PhD in Physics submitted to the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Carlos Fiolhais and DÃ©cio Martins, 2011 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/16388)\n\nKeywords: Institute of Coimbra; History of Physics; History of Chemistry; History of science education; University of Coimbra\n\nAbstract: With the present work we aim to demonstrate the influence of the Institute of Coimbra (IC) on the evolution of physics and chemistry in Portugal from 1852 to 1952. The IC was a scientific and literary society that was created in 1852 within the University of Coimbra, having started publishing the periodic O Instituto, which compiled the memoirs from its associates. The initial part of this work corresponds to the history of this institution, with over 130 years of existence and 141 volumes of its journal published. Our main analysis focused on the scientific activities of the members of the IC, on the articles on physics and chemistry published in its journal, and on the conferences organized and the national and international relations established by the IC. Regarding physics, we highlighted the history of telegraphy and its impact on the standardization of electrical units; we describe the meteorological observations made in Coimbra, the creation of its observatory, and the adoption of the first methods of forecasting the weather in Portugal and in Europe; we examine the implementation of a section of solar astrophysics in Coimbra, in the early twentieth century, and the opposition to the Einstein’s relativity theory, among other issues. In the context of chemistry, we revised the history of the application of toxicological analysis and the emergence of forensic chemistry in Coimbra; we study the evolution of the chemical analysis of mineral waters and public water supply in Portugal and we outline some of the episodes relating to the attempts to implement metallurgical methods in the country and the emergence of the chemical industry. Based on the contents of O Instituto, it was possible to describe the various reforms of secondary education in Portugal, with greater emphasis on the teaching of physics and chemistry, in the view of the IC members, some of whom were protagonists in the various projects on this level of education organization. We assessed the level of science teaching in the Faculties of Philosophy and Mathematics from UC, based on the curricula of the disciplines of Physics and Chemistry and the reforms that were implemented until 1911, mainly from published sources in O Instituto. Given that most primary sources are articles from O Instituto, we undertook a quantitative analysis of the scientific dissemination in this journal and drafted ideographic and onomastic indexes of the articles related to Physics and Chemistry. To make this work reproducible, we implemented some lesson plans where contents of the history of science in Portugal appear linked to the syllabus of the discipline of Physics and Chemistry of secondary education.\n\nLIMA, PÃ©ricles Pedrosa, The court in Brazil and Portuguese periodicals (1808-1821), PhD in History: Modern and Contemporary History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by AntÃ³nio Ventura, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/7692)\n\nKeywords: Monarchy; America; Newspaper; Emancipation\n\nAbstract: Between 1808 and 1821 the Portuguese Monarchy set up residence in America, away from the revolutionary movements in Europe. The newspapers published in London and Lisbon sought to inform on the main news on Brazil, Portugal and the world. Thus were launched the seeds of Brazilian political emancipation.\n\nLOBÃO, Carlos Manuel Gomes, A Port City - Horta between 1800 and 1926.
