        "text": "I do think that a Brazilian focused empire would take more of an interest in Africa particularly Angola. For much of the XIX century Portugal was cash strapped and the Miguelist wars did not help. Until the 1850s most of Angola's trade was with Brazil, with most exports being slaves. I could envision the a segment of the upper class in the Kingdom of Brazil wanting to engage in the \"New Imperialism\" and being closer to Angola certainly helps. In the 1830s Brazil began settling freed and rebellious slaves in present-day Benin and Togo.\n\nThese freed slaves were referred to as Portuguese and in 1885 Portugal did sign a treaty with the King of Dahomey to make the region a Portuguese protectorate. This along with claims between Casamance River in present-day Senegal to the Nunez (Nunes) River to the south in present-day Guinea were ceded to France in exchange for French recognition of the claims to the \"pink map\". With more Brazilian explorers and administrators, the Portuguese Empire might be able to push its claims inland earlier.\n\nWith a less cash-strapped empire, the governor of Timor would not have to sell Eastern Flores, Lomblen, Adonara, Solor, Alor and Pantar to the Dutch, and they may take a more aggressive posture in dealings with the Dutch in Timor itself, making the Portuguese-controlled area larger.\n\nSo Brazil would be more powerful and aggressive in the colonial game and could attach these light red areas to the map.\n\nIn Africa, attach dahomey and expand the pink map to include southern Congo, Madagascar and parts of Tanzania.\n\nIn the east, expand the timor and annex eastern indonesia, perhaps reaching the larger islands such as papua new guinea and celebs\n\nIn short, the Portugal-Brazil union would be a major player in the colonial game at the level of France and only behind the British Empire.\n\nPedro I/IV was an admirer of Napoleon and had long wanted to assume the title of Emperor. Being fairly liberal the most ideal title would be to adopt the title \"Emperor of the Portuguese\". This would be like Napoleon's Emperor of the French, or Louis-Philippe's \"King of the French\". Also, the rulers of Belgium adopted \"King of the Belgians\" as did those of Greece \"King of the Hellenes\" for their new kingdoms. Official documents would refer to the \"Portuguese Empire\". They would of course retain the title of King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves etc. Many Brazilian intellectuals had argued in the early 1820s that their pátria (fatherland) was composed of various parts of territory around the globe united in the person of the king, so this new title would be more appropriate. This was also when the term \"overseas province\" was first used to describe the other territories of the empire. The idea was despite the king's subjects throughout the disparate geographic were united. Meanwhile, Portugal retained a special place as \"the cradle of the nation\" from which a global empire was born. As a result, the \"Kingdom of Portugal\" and \"Kingdom of Brazil\" would be constituent parts of a larger \"Portuguese Empire\".\n\nOne of the complaints that the Portuguese elites had during the 1808-1821 period was that the length of time it took to send requests to the king in Rio de Janeiro took too long. Salvador da Bahia would have probably been a better choice as the imperial seat, but Rio de Janeiro was much more prominent as it was near the economic heart of Brazil., The Kingdom of Portugal like the provinces of Brazil will have to have its own assembly and essentially functioning as any of the provinces of Brazil did with its own autonomous legislature in Lisbon. However, being a kingdom it would be ruled by a \"Regent\" rather than a governor, and be directly responsible to the Emperor/King rather than Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWith Brazil being dominant in Angola the establishment of a transcontinental empire linking it to the possessions in East Africa would be accomplished with much greater ease. Also, its status as a penal colony means that it will get a large amount of convicts from Brazil past the 1820s. Eventually, Angola would be elevated to the status of a \"kingdom\" within the Portuguese Empire. In 1886, the name Angola was used to refer to this territory, so I imagine it would be the most appropriate here. Lord of Guinea was another title of the Portuguese Crown. Perhaps a Kingdoms of Guinea and Dahomey can emerge. It might also be populated with more liberated slaves, and have a stronger creole component, much like Sierra Leone.\n\nI don't see Madagascar becoming Portuguese as the French were already dominant there. The same with Celebes (Sulawesi) or Moluccas where the Dutch had an older presence. If there is a Emperor/King whom is as ambitious as Leopold II of Belgium, New Guinea or even Cochin China is possible, but I imagine they will focus on Africa. Portugal's presence in Moçâmedes was founded in 1840 by settlers from Pernambuco. A more likely expansion would be into present-day Namibia, as Portugal's claim went down to Cape Frio, but this was ceded to Germany in 1885 along with the territory south of Kilwa in present-day Tanzania. Additionally, they will move to reestablish a claim to Cabinda before 1885, as well as a claim over the territories that had been part of the Kingdom of the Kongo along with the territories of the Lunda people that extend into the present-day Congo.\n\nAs reported by Viriato in a previous post; Lisbon could revolt but Brazil would keep Portugal strong with the support of the British, and Lisbon's rebels could seek help from Spain or France to intervene as France intervened in Spain in 1823.\n\nthe most likely in my opinion would be: that portugal was kept by brazil during the 19th century, but when the 20th century arrived, portugal would declare independence similarly to ireland and become a republic.\n\nBrazil would make use of the rhetoric of being the natural successor of the Portuguese empire to justify the union, while Portugal at the same time would make use of the rhetoric of being a European nation and would seek independence as a republic.\n\nThe comparison with Ireland is much different as the Portuguese from Metropolitan Portugal would not be a marginalised and disenfranchised people with a different religion and language and customs. That is not to say that revolts are not possible, particularly early on as the elite want Brazil to return to its pre-1808 mercantilism system. Early on in the 1820s you have two factions in Portugal, or rather in Lisbon and Porto. The liberal bourgeois whom would look to England for assistance and the conservatives backed by the powerful church and old nobility looking to absolutist France and Spain. The liberals are going to probably win out, but in return will have to give up an pretense of having he old order restored. A compromise might be a personal union, with joint navy, foreign ministry and common currency.\n\nRevolts were not unknown throughout XIX century Europe, but usually they were relegated to Lisbon or Porto, as the rest of the country stagnated and the literacy rate was probably less than 10% outside of the cities. North of the Tagus River, the Portuguese economy particularly in the small towns and cities was economically dependent on the emigration to Brazil. The remittances sent from Brazil were so significant that as early as March 1875 Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins, a deputy in the Cortes stated that Portugal was completely financially and economically dependent on Brazil. This only increased as Portuguese emigration there increased progressively, so much so that in 1890 when remittances were disrupted due to the revolution in Brazil, the lack of foreign exchange caused a financial crisis in Portugal. By 1910 in districts like Bragança one in six young men emigrated to Brazil with around one-third returning, many with small fortunes, building hospitals, schools and providing much needed capital to areas with a mediaeval economy. Between 1890 and 1930 alone over 1 million Portuguese left for Brazil. Any revolt might would seriously hamper one of the economic backbones of an already fragile economy.\n\nMy take is the Portuguese character would be even more fatalistic and resigned to their fate, not dissimilar to how many perceive of themselves as a tiny powerless nation within the European Union. Throughout much of the XIX and XX centuries it was said that Portugal needed the empire in Africa or else it would be reduced to a Spanish province, if they revolt they're left without that. The country produced little of value, and without coal, iron ore missed industrialization. The poverty can be reflected whereby 1930 its literacy rate the lowest in Europe than one-third of its people able to read or write. By comparison, Spain, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and the USSR were all above 50% by that year, the only country in Europe with a less educated population was Albania. Lisbon and to a lesser extent Porto were able to modernize, but in the case of Lisbon much of this wealth came from the imperial economy and the civil service, banking and shipping linked to the colonial empire. By the 1920s, the diamond monopoly in Angola and the labour agreement between Mozambique and South Africa provided income directly to Lisbon. With the navy on the royal family's side Portugal would probably even lose the Atlantic Islands as these archipelagos would be even more dependent on emigration to Brazil than the mainland.\n\nWith enough autonomy and a greater reliance on settling much larger numbers Portuguese peasant families, particularly those from the islands in southern Brazil, I imagine this can function as a large safety valve for any revolutionary activity. One has to remember that between 1870 and 1930 the economically active population in Portugal continued to decrease to just over 50%, meaning there were not enough jobs to support the population growth. The government would probably set a larger budget to financially assist immigration to Brazil from Portugal, something that did not occur after 1822.\n\nThe comparison with Ireland is much different as the Portuguese from Metropolitan Portugal would not be a marginalised and disenfranchised people with a different religion and language and customs.

It is one thing for a nation like France to be able to maintain sparsely populated French Polynesia in the long run, it would be another for the United Kingdom to maintain New Zealand and its millions of inhabitants until the 21st century.\n\nThe long-term trend is independence, but still maintaining ties between these nations, perhaps Portugal and Brazil maintain the same monarch and create a Commonwealth of Portuguese nations.\n\nOr is the Brazil-Portugal union a unique case in history, in which a nation was composed of two territories separated by an ocean of distance and both with millions of inhabitants remained united and survived until the 21st century?"
