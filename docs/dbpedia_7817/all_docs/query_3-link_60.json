        "text": "By Silas Morgan\n\nOrlando Sentinel\n\nLAKE COUNTY, Fla. — One of the two Lake County Sheriff’s deputies injured in a deadly ambush Friday was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from the agency.\n\nHarold Howell was shot in the late night encounter that killed fellow deputy Bradley Michael Link in Eustis. A third deputy, Stefano Gargano, remains in the hospital after four surgeries, but has been upgraded from critical to stable condition.\n\nIn the new statement, Lake Lt . John Herrell said Howell was released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon and is now resting and recovering at home. Howell released his own statement thanking the community for their support and asking that they support Link and Gargano’s families as well.\n\n“To everyone in Lake County , as well as state and even nationwide — I have seen and heard your prayers, love and support,” he said. “I want to thank each and every one of you. Please continue to support the family and friends of deputies Link and Gargano through this most difficult time.”\n\nThe ambush is being blamed on the Sulpizio family, who allegedly lured the deputies into their home. Mother Julie Ann was arrested outside the home prior to the armed confrontation. According to Sheriff Peyton Grinnell, father Michael and daughters Cheyenne and Savannah shot at the deputies when they entered the home, then the three killed themselves at the end of a long standoff.\n\nJulie Ann Sulpizio has been charged with first-degree murder. She says her family was inspired by God.\n\n—"
