        "text": "Bernardino Luís Machado (born March 28, 1851, Rio de Janeiro—died April 29, 1944, Porto, Port.) was a Brazilian-born political leader who was twice president of Portugal (1915–17, 1925–26).\n\nA professor at Coimbra University, Lisbon, from 1879, Machado was elected twice to the chamber of peers as representative of the university (1890, 1894). He was also minister of public works (1893) and created the first labour court in Portugal. In 1902, after espousing republicanism, he was elected president of the governing board of the Republican Party. With the overthrow of the monarchy (1910), he served as minister of foreign affairs (1910–11), deputy to the constituent assembly and senator (1911), and minister (later ambassador) to Brazil (1912). While he was prime minister and minister of the interior in 1914, he wished to commit Portugal to the side of Great Britain in World War I, but Portugal did not formally join the Allies until March 1916. Elected president on Aug. 6, 1915, he was overthrown by the rightist revolution of Dec. 8, 1917. He became president again on Dec. 11, 1925, but was once more deposed (May 28, 1926) by a military revolt, which soon brought Gen. António Oscar de Fragoso Carmona to power. Machado went into exile, but in 1940 he was allowed to return home."
