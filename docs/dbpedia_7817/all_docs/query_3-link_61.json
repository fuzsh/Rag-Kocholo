Christopher Mendoza\n\nPortuguese and U.S. Marines recently exchanged crisis response tactics during an exercise here that could be used to protect other NATO countries.\n\nApproximately 60 U.S. Marines with Special-Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Africa joined the Portuguese Marines, the Fuzileiros, to rehearse clearing rooms, fast rope techniques, weapons familiarization, and live-fire ranges near Lisbon, Portugal, April 7-13, 2015.\n\n“I hope there are more opportunities to work together with the U.S. Marine Corps,” said 2nd Sgt. Nunoel Faustino, an assaultman with the Fuzileiros. “We’re going to need you guys, as you will probably need us, one day. We are all NATO, so we have to help each other.”\n\nThe similar capabilities and tactical prowess between the allies made them fast friends and an undeniable force. The two NATO members were tested while their skills were on display for their final exercise, a joint raid on a simulated enemy compound. Special guests observing the raid included the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, Robert Sherman; several Portuguese military dignitaries from across the services; and Col. Thomas Savage, the SPMAGTF-CR-AF commanding officer.\n\nThe fluidity and expertise in the integrated exercise was evident as the audience observed the seamless final event.\n\n“I can see us working together in the future,” said Lance Cpl. Joshua Willis, a team leader with SPMAGTF-CR-AF. “Honestly, I hope I get to work with them in the future. They take their job seriously and they really know what they’re doing. I wouldn’t hesitate to go into combat with these guys.”"
