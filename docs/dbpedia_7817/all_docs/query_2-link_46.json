        "text": "The Office of the Sheriff is more than 1,000 years old. From the beginning of English and Scottish law, the Sheriff's Office was the local center for the administration of justice. The word \"reeve\" meant an administrative officer and the word \"shire\" was the equivalent of a county. Therefore, the first office title was \"Shire-Reeve\" which in time was shortened to the word \"Sheriff\" as we know it today. In Macomb County, the first sheriff was James Fulton, who took office in 1818.\n\nMany of Macomb County’s sheriffs were pioneers, community leaders and prominent citizens. The office has a rich history, spanning more than 200 years, with movie-ready stories of deputies engaging in gun battles with bootleggers, smashing slot machines with axes on raids and solving murder mysteries.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office implemented its first motorcycle unit in 1920 to patrol Gratiot Ave., the first paved road in the county, and enforce the 25 mph speed limit. Deputies did not wear uniforms until 1926, and it was not common for the sheriff to wear a uniform until the 1970s.\n\nDuring Sheriff George Smith’s term, which ran from 1923 until 1926 and 1933-1936, the department began using in-car radios via the Detroit Police system. Sheriff Smith was also the first to keep the department open 24 hours a day, as it had previously closed between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.. One of the first overnight patrols was an immediate success when the deputies spotted a fire in a farmhouse near Utica and was able to extinguish the blaze before it spread.\n\nThe first sub-station was established in 1927 in Center Line. The station was later moved to Warren and operated until 1952.\n\nThe Macomb County Sheriff’s Office was the first agency in the United States to transport prisoners via airplane. In 1931, Sheriff Wylie Wilkinson used an airplane to transport two prisoners from Mount Clemens to the State Prison in Jackson to avoid gang members trying to break them out along the land route.\n\nThe 1950s saw enormous growth, not only for the county, but for the Sheriff’s Office as well. Sheriff Harley Ensign progressively grew his force, from 43 deputies in 1954 to 80 by 1957. Sheriff Ensign also recognized the need to regularly police the county’s busy waterways and began patrolling in his own boat. In 1956 he was able to purchase a county-owned department boat and establish the regular Marine Patrol.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office merged with the city of Mount Clemens police in 2005 and the village of New Haven police in 2013, with the Sheriff assuming policing responsibilities for those communities.\n\nThe first jail for the county was built onto the back of the Sheriff’s house in what is now Marine City, as the county at that time also encompassed St. Clair County. A new jail was built in Mount Clemens in 1819, and there were several others until 1881, when a new jail and Sheriff’s Office was built at Northbound Gratiot at Cass Avenue on the banks of the Clinton River. The building would also later house the Mount Clemens Police Department in the basement and remained the home of the Sheriff’s Office until the current location on Elizabeth Road was erected in 1954.\n\nThe new jail cellblocks contained 12 dormitory-style cells, which would sleep as many as 12 prisoners, with nearly two dozen segregated cells for hardened criminals. There were two small apartments provided: one for the Sheriff and one for the matron.\n\nIn 1969 the jail was found to be inadequate for the growing community and again in need of additional space. The jail was built with a capacity of little more than 100 prisoners when it opened in 1954, whereas the average enrollment per day in the 1960’s was 150. New additions were added in 1970 and again in 1977, increasing the jail’s capacity to 354 inmates.\n\nIn 1987, the 12-story “tower” portion of the jail was completed, and in 1998, another 200-bed jail annex was added. Despite the nearly constant additions, the jail was frequently over capacity with nearly 1,500 inmates at times.\n\nCurrently, plans are moving forward to build a central intake facility which would include a new mental health housing area and eliminate many of the structures from the 1950s and 1970s.\n\nA special thank you to Macomb County Historian Cindy Donahue for her research and assistance.\n\nSheriff Joachim Matthews\n\nEOW: Friday, Dec. 2, 1910\n\nCause of death: gunfire\n\nSheriff Matthews was shot and killed while attempting to serve a cruelty to animals warrant at a farm in Harrison Township. A 14-year-old boy in the house was ordered by his mother to fire a rifle through the door as Sheriff Matthews knocked. Hit in the chest, the Sheriff was able to drive his horse and wagon back to town where he collapsed on the floor of the office and succumbed to his wounds. The boy and his mother were charged with murder. During their trial the mother testified that she thought the man at the door was a burglar and ordered her son to shoot. The boy was acquitted and charges against his mother were dismissed.\n\nSheriff Matthews was 60 years old at the time of his death. His son, John Matthews, was undersheriff and continued to serve with the department. Four months after his father’s death, John was shot in the head while in pursuit of a suspect on Lake Saint Clair.\n\nDeputy Sheriff John Matthews\n\nEOW: Sunday, April 16, 1916\n\nCause of death: gunfire\n\nSon of former Sheriff Joachim Matthews, John had previously served as undersheriff for four years, sheriff for 33 days after his father was murdered and was a deputy for four years. On April 11, 1911, Sheriff Harris, Undersheriff Culver and Deputy Matthews attempted to serve a warrant on Sandy DeHartier for robbery. He had been working on a farm in Harrison Township and was suspected of some thefts in the area. The officers found DeHartier fishing on a sailboat in the channel near Conger Bay. Deputy Matthews borrowed a rowboat and tried to talk the suspect into coming in. DeHartier raised a shotgun and yelled to Matthews, “you’ll never get any closer to me than you are now!” DeHartier fired from less than 20 feet, striking Deputy Matthews on the right side and head. The suspect fled across Lake St. Clair, leading to the formation of a posse of both American and Canadian authorities. He was later shot and killed in an exchange of gunfire with deputies in Harrison Township.\n\nDeputy Matthews never fully recovered from his wounds and died from complications in 1916 at the age of 37. He was survived by his wife, mother and three brothers.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Clarence LaCroix\n\nEOW: Tuesday, Aug. 25, 1925\n\nCause of death: Motorcycle crash\n\nDeputy LaCroix was killed in a motorcycle accident while on patrol. He was riding west on Nine Mile Road near Van Dyke. when an automobile turned in front of him. The motorcycle was hurled into a ditch after brushing the auto, then fell on top of him. Attendants from the Detroit Police ambulance who took the call said that his neck was broken, and he lived but a short time afterwards. No charges were brought against the driver of the vehicle.\n\nDeputy LaCroix was known as an expert cyclist. He had served as a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army in France with the American Expeditionary Forces for 22 months during World War I. He was buried with military honors, having won honorable mention overseas, a military firing squad, buglers corps, color guard, and both a police and sheriff escort accompanied the American Legion in the procession to the St. Peters Cemetery.\n\nDeputy LaCroix was survived by his wife and two daughters and was 29 years old.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Edwin Wormsbacher\n\nEOW: Monday, Sept. 3, 1934\n\nCause of death: Motorcycle crash\n\nDeputy Wormsbacher left his home in Mount Clemens on his way to police the Romeo Peach Festival. As he traveled up North Avenue on his department motorcycle, he glanced at a passing vehicle near 24 Mile Road and did not see that the car ahead of him had come to a stop. Deputy Wormsbacher struck the rear of the automobile and was thrown through the back window. He succumbed to his injuries five hours later at Saint Joseph’s Hospital in Mount Clemens.\n\nDeputy Wormsbacher was 30 years old and left behind a wife and two young children, one of whom went on to become a Mount Clemens police officer. Deputy Wormsbacher’s father, John, was appointed as a deputy upon his son’s death.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Theodore Radlinski\n\nEOW: Wednesday, Feb. 7, 1940\n\nCause of death: Motor vehicle crash\n\nDeputy Theodore “Todge” Radlinski was struck by an automobile as he walked across Van Dyke Ave. at Nine Mile Road at 2:30 a.m. on Jan. 28, 1940. He was critically injured and succumbed to his injuries 11 days later.\n\nDeputy Radlinski, assigned to the Warren substation, was a very popular figure in the community. He had served full time with the department for Sheriff Havel since January 1, 1937. Previously he had severed as a special deputy for Sheriffs Moore and Wilkinson. Deputy Radlinski was 31 years old and was survived by his mother, three brothers and two sisters.\n\nPatrolman Robert Ahrens\n\nMount Clemens Police Department\n\nEOW: Thursday, Nov. 1, 1973\n\nCause of Death: Gunfire\n\nPatrolman Ahrens was shot and killed after responding to a jewelry store holdup alarm at 82 Macomb Place. He entered the store alone and was shot and killed after exchanging gunfire with three suspects who were in the process of robbing the business. One of the suspects was later shot and killed during the standoff with authorities. The other two were apprehended and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nPatrolman Ahrens had been with the agency for four years and was 28 years old.\n\nLieutenant Gornicki currently serves as the detective lieutenant in charge of the Sheriff’s Enforcement Team (S.E.T.) and oversees MCSO personnel assigned to special units dedicated to fugitive apprehension, narcotics, auto theft, and computer crimes (D.F.A.T., F.B.I., D.E.A., C.O.M.E.T., M.A.T.S., M.A.C.E.).\n\nLt.
