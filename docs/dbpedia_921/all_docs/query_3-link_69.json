        "text": "CHAPTER V.\n\n_The death of Sir Thomas Booby, with the affectionate and mournful\n\nbehaviour of his widow, and the great purity of Joseph Andrews._\n\nAt this time an accident happened which put a stop to those agreeable\n\nwalks, which probably would have soon puffed up the cheeks of Fame, and\n\ncaused her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town; and this was no\n\nother than the death of Sir Thomas Booby, who, departing this life, left\n\nhis disconsolate lady confined to her house, as closely as if she\n\nherself had been attacked by some violent disease. During the first six\n\ndays the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slipslop, and three female\n\nfriends, who made a party at cards: but on the seventh she ordered Joey,\n\nwhom, for a good reason, we shall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her\n\ntea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Joseph to her, bade him sit\n\ndown, and, having accidentally laid her hand on his, she asked him if he\n\nhad ever been in love. Joseph answered, with some confusion, it was time\n\nenough for one so young as himself to think on such things. \"As young as\n\nyou are,\" replied the lady, \"I am convinced you are no stranger to that\n\npassion. Come, Joey,\" says she, \"tell me truly, who is the happy girl\n\nwhose eyes have made a conquest of you?\" Joseph returned, that all the\n\nwomen he had ever seen were equally indifferent to him. \"Oh then,\" said\n\nthe lady, \"you are a general lover. Indeed, you handsome fellows, like\n\nhandsome women, are very long and difficult in fixing; but yet you\n\nshall never persuade me that your heart is so insusceptible of\n\naffection; I rather impute what you say to your secrecy, a very\n\ncommendable quality, and what I am far from being angry with you for.\n\nNothing can be more unworthy in a young man, than to betray any\n\nintimacies with the ladies.\" \"Ladies! madam,\" said Joseph, \"I am sure I\n\nnever had the impudence to think of any that deserve that name.\" \"Don't\n\npretend to too much modesty,\" said she, \"for that sometimes may be\n\nimpertinent: but pray answer me this question. Suppose a lady should\n\nhappen to like you; suppose she should prefer you to all your sex, and\n\nadmit you to the same familiarities as you might have hoped for if you\n\nhad been born her equal, are you certain that no vanity could tempt you\n\nto discover her? Answer me honestly, Joseph; have you so much more sense\n\nand so much more virtue than you handsome young fellows generally have,\n\nwho make no scruple of sacrificing our dear reputation to your pride,\n\nwithout considering the great obligation we lay on you by our\n\ncondescension and confidence? Can you keep a secret, my Joey?\" \"Madam,\"\n\nsays he, \"I hope your ladyship can't tax me with ever betraying the\n\nsecrets of the family; and I hope, if you was to turn me away, I might\n\nhave that character of you.\" \"I don't intend to turn you away, Joey,\"\n\nsaid she, and sighed; \"I am afraid it is not in my power.\" She then\n\nraised herself a little in her bed, and discovered one of the whitest\n\nnecks that ever was seen; at which Joseph blushed. \"La!\" says she, in an\n\naffected surprize, \"what am I doing? I have trusted myself with a man\n\nalone, naked in bed; suppose you should have any wicked intentions upon\n\nmy honour, how should I defend myself?\" Joseph protested that he never\n\nhad the least evil design against her. \"No,\" says she, \"perhaps you may\n\nnot call your designs wicked; and perhaps they are not so.\"--He swore\n\nthey were not. \"You misunderstand me,\" says she; \"I mean if they were\n\nagainst my honour, they may not be wicked; but the world calls them so.\n\nBut then, say you, the world will never know anything of the matter; yet\n\nwould not that be trusting to your secrecy? Must not my reputation be\n\nthen in your power? Would you not then be my master?\" Joseph begged her\n\nladyship to be comforted; for that he would never imagine the least\n\nwicked thing against her, and that he had rather die a thousand deaths\n\nthan give her any reason to suspect him. \"Yes,\" said she, \"I must have\n\nreason to suspect you. Are you not a man? and, without vanity, I may\n\npretend to some charms. But perhaps you may fear I should prosecute you;\n\nindeed I hope you do; and yet Heaven knows I should never have the\n\nconfidence to appear before a court of justice; and you know, Joey, I am\n\nof a forgiving temper. Tell me, Joey, don't you think I should forgive\n\nyou?\"--\"Indeed, madam,\" says Joseph, \"I will never do anything to\n\ndisoblige your ladyship.\"--\"How,\" says she, \"do you think it would not\n\ndisoblige me then? Do you think I would willingly suffer you?\"--\"I don't\n\nunderstand you, madam,\" says Joseph.--\"Don't you?\" said she, \"then you\n\nare either a fool, or pretend to be so; I find I was mistaken in you. So\n\nget you downstairs, and never let me see your face again; your pretended\n\ninnocence cannot impose on me.\"--\"Madam,\" said Joseph, \"I would not have\n\nyour ladyship think any evil of me. I have always endeavoured to be a\n\ndutiful servant both to you and my master.\"--\"O thou villain!\" answered\n\nmy lady; \"why didst thou mention the name of that dear man, unless to\n\ntorment me, to bring his precious memory to my mind?\" (and then she\n\nburst into a fit of tears.) \"Get thee from my sight! I shall never\n\nendure thee more.\" At which words she turned away from him; and Joseph\n\nretreated from the room in a most disconsolate condition, and writ that\n\nletter which the reader will find in the next chapter."
