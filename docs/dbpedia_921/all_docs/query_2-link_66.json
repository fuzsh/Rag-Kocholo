        "text": "A Short Description Mustafa Zeki Çıraklı, who is an academician, a critic, a translator but before anything else a literary thinking individual, intends to give a clear picture of novel as a field of art by describing Henry Fielding's , who is one of the most outstanding writers of English literature and a leading figure of the genre, thoughts in detail. He takes us into a magical journey in the history of narration and makes us understand what a novel is by analysing Fielding's novel Tom Jones because of its literary quality as well as its extraordinary and innovative position. The book consists of three different parts. After an introductory section, the writer focuses on the depiction of human nature and the history of comic-epic narratology in the first part. The second and, to me the most important part of the book, mainly sheds light upon Fielding's novel Tom Jones and the essays about the history of the genre which enable the reader to grab the core meaning in his understanding of narrative. The last part of the book named Reading Henry Fielding in a (Post)modern age is presented instead of a conclusion section and aims to create a link between the reading behaviours of readers and the birth of the genre. Throughout the book, one can find a competent analysis of a progressive writer's ideas and ideals; and of course, it can be considered as a well-prepared handout for Turkish readers with its stimulating approach in terms of novel as a field of art. A Climax in English Literature In order to understand the book deeply, it will be much better to go back to the history of novel because the writer wants to illustrate the gorgeous birth of the genre especially in terms of English Literature but in general, for the world literature itself. As it is widely accepted, Cervantes's Don Quixote is the first example of the genre. Therefore, the writer clearly describes the similarities and differences between Don Quixote and Tom Jones as well as those between Cervantes and Fielding by referring some other critics as well. According to the writer, Tom Jones, which is accepted as a masterpiece ahead of its time by many scholars, is important not only because of its literary style and fiction but also of its historical background. He defines the book as a \"history of England where great changes and transformations were taking place (p14)\" and suggests that the book can possibly be read allegorically like any other literary pieces of works. On the other hand, he refers to the name of the book The history of Tom Jones and defines the book as a historiography of Fielding and adds that Fielding had aimed to narrate not human beings but their habits and manners (p 15) which consisted of his supplies. As a Bildungsroman and a picaresque novel Tom Jones, is described as an example of a new genre which includes some common points with previous approaches like its being a burlesque one but blends many traits to narrate a multi-dimensional and a polyphonic story (p 16). Fielding's style is suggested to have been borrowed from Cervantes and it is suggested that he tried to combine comic features with traditional epic style which is intentionally done by him and this leads him to be a milestone in terms of the understanding of novel as a prose."
