        "text": "Weightlifting: Solfrid Koanda makes history for Norway by winning women's 81kg\n\nSolfrid Koanda (NOR) has won the women's 81kg weightlifting event, just Norway's second ever medal in any weightlifting event and first since a gold in 1972.\n\nIt's also the first medal in women's weightifting for Norway â€“ and she did it by lifting a snatch of 121kg and a clean & jerk Olympic record 154kg.\n\nHer total of 275kg was also a new Olympic record. Sara Ahmed (EGY), won silver on 268kg while bronze went to Neisi Dajomes (ECU).\n\nGolf: Lydia Ko completes medal set with gold\n\nThe medallists are set and it's a procession now for Lydia Ko.\n\nAll she has to do is not drop a shot on this tricky last par 5.\n\nShe has a putt for birdie for gold on the 18th. And makes it. She puts her hand to her mouth as she realises she is Olympic champion.\n\nAt 27, she has done enough to earn LPGA Hall of Fame induction. Ko wipes away the tears as she walks off the green at 18.\n\nSilver to Germany's Esther Henseleit two shots back on -8, and bronze to People's Republic of China's Lin Xiyu on -7.\n\nDiving: Cao Yuan (CHN) wins men's 10m platform gold!\n\nCao is the back-to-back Olympic champion!\n\nHe becomes the first diver since Greg Louganis (USA) in 1988 to win consecutive gold medals in this event, and he does so with style, posting a whopping total of 547.50.\n\nBut he was pushed all the way by Tamai Rikuto (JPN), who was just 2.75 points behind Cao before botching his fifth dive. The Japanese was able to recover for his final dive - a back 2Â½ somersaults 2Â½ twists in the pike position - that earned him an incredible 99.00 points and the silver medal (Japan's first medal in Olympic diving in history).\n\nBronze is won by Noah Williams (GBR); the Briton had two of the best dives in the final two rounds to surge into third place.\n\nðŸ¥‡Cao Yuan (CHN): 547.50\n\nðŸ¥ˆTamai Rikuto (JPN): 507.65\n\nðŸ¥‰Noah Williams (GBR): 497.35\n\nRhythmic gymnastics: People's Republic of China win group all-around gold!\n\nThe team event in rhythmic gymnastics has just finished, and it's China that have won their first ever medal in this event - and it's gold!\n\nThey were in a strong position after 5 hoops portion of the event, receiving a top score of 36.950. Defending champions Bulgaria had a dropped hoop in their routine, pushing them down into seventh. China then had the third-highest score in the three ribbons+two balls section, which was enough for them to win gold.\n\nIt's a first ever medal for Israel in this event as they take silver, with a second successive bronze for Italy after they finished third in Tokyo.\n\nðŸ¥‡People's Republic of China: 69.800\n\nðŸ¥ˆIsrael: 68.850\n\nðŸ¥‰Italy: 68.100\n\nModern pentathlon: Olympic records set in women's semi-finals\n\nFor the first time at an Olympic Games, we have semi-finals in modern pentathlon to determine our finalists. And just as we did yesterday for the men, we've had new Olympic records today for the women, thanks to a change in the rules resulting shorter Laser Run segment, down to 3km from 3.2km.\n\nIt means we've seen both the Olympic record for the Laser Run and for Overall Points re-written today.\n\nLithuania's Laura Asadauskaite remains the Olympic record holder in the Laser Run, breaking her own Tokyo 2020 record of 602 points by scoring 630 points for an 11:10.90 segment.\n\nAnd Great Britain's Kerenza Bryson broke her compatriot Kate French's overall score record with 1402 points in Semi-Final A earlier today.\n\nGolf: Lydia Ko clear at top as Morgane Metraux struggles\n\nWe have a clear leader in the women's golf competition, with the final round well underway.\n\nIt's New Zealand's Lydia Ko, who already owns Olympic silver and bronze from the last two Games, three shots clear of the pack sitting at 10-under overall through eight holes today. If Ko takes gold, she will earn the last point she needs to qualify for the LPGA Hall of Fame.\n\nOvernight co-leader Morgane Metraux of Switzerland has had a day to forget so far, carding five-over-par through the first eight holes, while Ko and Metraux's playing partner Rose Zhang of USA has also dropped two shots.\n\nGermany's Esther Henseleit and Yin Ruoning of People's Republic of China are tied for second at seven-under.\n\nNotably, Canada's Brooke Henderson is in the medal mix despite having carded two over-par rounds to start this tournament. She is three-under for the day and in a tie for fifth at five-under.\n\nWeightlifting: Liu Huanhua (CHN) wins men's 102kg gold!\n\nLiu is simply a cut above!\n\nThe 2023 world champion hit a 186kg snatch to share the lead with Garik Karapetyan (ARM) heading into the clean & jerk portion of the competition, and only needed one attempt there to stick a monster 220kg lift, giving him a 406kg total that would not be beaten.\n\nSafe in the knowledge that the gold was his, Liu decided to stick 233kg in the bar in an attempt to break in his own world record in the lift (232kg, set in April this year) and total (413kg).\n\nYou could hear a pin drop inside South Paris Arena 6 as the 22-year-old stepped to the platform, but although Liu managed to stand up the clean after a herculean effort, he simply didn't have enough strength left to stick the jerk - despite the best efforts of a raucous crowd cheering him on.\n\nStill, he walks away as the Olympic champion!\n\nðŸ¥‡Liu Huanhua (CHN): 406kg\n\nðŸ¥ˆAkbar Djuraev (UZB): 404kg\n\nðŸ¥‰Yauheni Tsikhantsou (AIN): 402kg\n\nSport climbing: Janja Garnbret wins second Olympic gold\n\nThis is absolutely remarkable from Japan's Mori Ai!\n\nShe slowly but surely makes her way up the Lead wall, making up for her below-part Boulder performance.\n\nMori has to reach three holds from the top to move into the lead past Great Britain's Erin McNeice. And she does just that, reaching the second-highest hold and only falling as she attempts to move to the Top!\n\nThe crowd and her teammate and Tokyo 2020 medallist Nonaka Miho applaud from below. A big standing ovation. Mori is into the lead on 135.1 points.\n\nUp next is Brooke Raboutou of the USA, second after Boulder. She needs to get just shy of the 60-point area to move past Mori into the lead.\n\nAnd she does just that. But she falls at the 72-point hold! The realisation finally hits Raboutou that she is guaranteed a medal and there's a release of emotions as she wears a massive smile before she goes to hug her fellow finalists. 156.0 points.\n\nTwo climbers left. And Jessica Pilz of Austria, who was one of the four athletes within a shout of bronze, has her medal! 88.1 on the lead wall before she falls gives her a total of 147.4 points. The same show of emotions that Raboutou displayed have now struck Pilz. She runs over to the Austrian support team and they engulf her in a bear hug.\n\nThere is a standing ovation for Janja Garnbret. Can she win her second Olympic gold, despite the injury from Boulder? She needs the 72-point hold for the win.\n\nShe's done it! No top but Janja Garnbret is a two-time Olympic champion!\n\nThe Slovenian collapses to her knees and breaks down in tears as the crowd give her a standing ovation. A scream of joy as the sobs come. She pumps her fists and blows a kiss to the crowd. Raboutou runs to her and gives her a big hug. 168.5 points for Garnbret.\n\nCanoe sprint: Lisa Carrington (NZL) wins women's kayak single 500m gold!\n\nLisa Carrington is incredible!\n\nThe 35-year-old has just powered through to win the 500m in an Olympic-best time of 1:47.36 - her third gold medal of Paris 2024 and eighth of her Olympic career. With the gold, she has now tied Birgit Fischer as the canoe athlete with most Olympic gold medals in history!\n\nSpeaking after the race, Carrington said: \"â€œI just turn up to do my best, love the paddling, love the racing. Always wanting to perform my best and thrive for my best has also given me so much joy.\"\n\nSilver goes to Tamara Csipes; it's the Hungarian's third medal of these Games after winning silver in the women's kayak double 500m and bronze in the women's kayak four 500m.\n\nBronze for Emma Aastrand Jorgensen of Denmark, who now becomes the most decorated Danish woman in Olympic history with four medals.\n\nðŸ¥‡Lisa Carrington (NZL): 1:47.36\n\nðŸ¥ˆTamara Csipes (HUN): 1:48.44\n\nðŸ¥‰Emma Aastrand Jorgensen (DEN): 1:49.76"
