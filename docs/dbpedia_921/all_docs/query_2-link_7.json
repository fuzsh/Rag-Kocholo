I.\n\nOf writing lives in general, and particularly of Pame|la; with a word by the bye of Colley Cibber and others.\n\nIT is a trite but true observation, that examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts: and if this be just in what is odious and blamea|ble, it is more strongly so in what is amiable and praise-worthy. Here emulation most effectually operates upon us, and inspires our imitation in an irresistable manner. A good man therefore is a standing lesson to all his acquaintance, and of far greater use in that narrow circle than a good book.\n\nBut as it often happens, that the best men are but little known, and consequently cannot extend the usefulness of their examples a gre•••• 〈◊〉〈◊〉; the\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nwriter may be called in aid to spread their history farther, and to present the amiable pictures to those who have not the happiness of knowing the originals; and so, by communicating such valua|ble patterns to the world, he may, perhaps, do a more extensive service to mankind, than the per|son whose life originally afforded the pattern.\n\nIn this light I have always regarded those bio|graphers, who have recorded the actions of great an•• worthy persons of both sexes. Not to men|tion these ••••cient writers which of late days are little 〈◊〉〈◊〉 being written in absolete, and, as they are generally thought, unintelligible languages, such as Plutarch, Nepos, and others, which I heard of in my youth; our own language affords many of excellent use and instruction, finely calcu|lated to sow the seeds of virtue, in youth, and very easy to be comprehended by persons of moderate capacity. Such are the history of John the Great, who, by his brave and heroic actions against men of large and athletic bodies, obtained the glorious appellation of the Giant-killer; that of an earl of Warwick, whose christian name was Guy; the lives of Argalus and Parthenia; and, above all, the history of those seven worthy personages, the Champions of Christendom. In all these, delight is mixed with instruction, and the reader is al|most as much improved as entertained.\n\nBut I pass by these and many others, to mention two books lately published, which represent an ad|mirable pattern of the amiable in either sex. The former of these which deals in male-virtue, was written by the great person himself, who lived the life he hath recorded, and is by many thought to have lived such a life only in order to write it. The other, communicated to us by an historian\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nwho borrows his lights, as the common method is, from authentic papers and records. The reader, I believe, already conjectures I mean the lives of Mr. Colley Cibber, and of Mrs. Pamela Andrews. How artfully doth the former, by insinuating that he escaped being promoted to the highest stations in church and state, teach us a contempt of world|ly grandeur! how strongly doth he inculcate an absolute submission to our superiors! Lastly, how completely doth he arm us against so uneasy, so wretched a passion as the fear of shame! how clearly doth he expose the emptiness and vanity of that phantom, reputation!\n\nWhat the female readers are taught by the me|moirs of Mrs. Andrews, is so well set forth in the excellent essays or letters prefixed to the second and subsequent editions of that work, that it would be here a needless repetition. The authentic history with which I now present the public, is an in|stance of the great good that book is likely to do, and of the prevalence of example which I have just observed: since it will appear that it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his sister's virtues before his eyes, that Mr. Joseph Andrews was chiefly enabled to preserve his purity in the midst of such great temptations. I shall only add, that this character of male-chastity, though doubtless as desirable and becoming in one part of the human species, as in the other, is almost the only virtue which the great apologist hath not given himself, for the sake of giving the example to his readers.\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nCHAP. II.\n\nOf Mr. Joseph Andrews, his birth, parentage, edu|cation, and great endowments; with a word or two concerning ancestors.\n\nMR. Joseph Andrews, the hero of our ensuing history, was esteemed to be the only son of Gaffer and Gammer Andrews, and brother to the illustrious Pamela, whose virtue is at present so famous. As to his ancestors, we have searched with great diligence, but little success; being un|able to trace them farther than his great-grand|father, who, as an elderly person in the parish re|members to have heard his father say, was an ex|cellent cudgel-player. Whether he had any an|cestors before this, we must leave to the opinion of our curious reader, finding nothing of sufficient certainty to rely on. However, we cannot omit inserting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath communicated.\n\nStay, traveller, for underneath this pew Lies fast asleep that merry man Andrew; When the last day's great sun shall gild the skies, Then he shall from his tomb get up and rise. Be merry while thou can'st: for surely thou Shall shortly be as sad as he is now.\n\nThe words are almost out of the stone with anti|quity. But it is needless to observe that Andrew here is writ without an s and is, besides, a Chris|tian name. My friend moreover conjectures this to have been the founder of that sect of laughing philosophers, since called Merry Andrews.\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nTo wave therefore a circumstance, which, though mentioned in conformity to the exact rules of bi|ography, is not greatly material; I proceed to things of more consequence. Indeed it is suffici|ently certain, that he had as many ancestors as the best man living; and perhaps, if we look five or six hundred years backwards, might be related to some persons of very great figure at present, whose ancestors within half the last century are buried in as great obscurity. But suppose, for argument's sake, we should admit that he had no ancestors at all, but had sprung up, according to the modern phrase, out of a dunghill, as the Athe|nians pretended they themselves did from the earth, would not this Autokopros have been justly en|titled to all the praise arising from his own vir|tues? Would it not be hard, that a man who hath no ancestors, should therefore be rendered incapa|ble of acquiring honour; when we see so many who have no virtues, enjoying the honour of their forefathers? At ten years old (by which time his education was advanced to writing and reading) he was bound an apprentice, according to the sta|tute, to Sir Thomas Booby, an uncle of Mr. Booby's by the father's side. Sir Thomas having an estate in his own hands, the young Andrew•• was at first employed in what in the country they call keeping birds. His office was to perform the part the ancients assigned to the god Priapus, which deity the moderns call by the name of Jack-o'Lent: but his voice being so extremely musical, that it rather allured the birds than terrified them, he was soon transplanted from the fields into the dog-ken|nel, where he was placed under the huntsman, and made what sportsmen term Whipper-in. For\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nthis place likewise the sweetness of his voice dis|qualified him; the dogs preferring the melody of his chiding to all the alluring notes of the hunts|man, who soon became so incensed at it, that he desired Sir Thomas to provide otherwise for him; and constantly laid every fault the dogs were at, to the account of the poor boy, who was now trans|planted to the stable. Here he soon gave proofs of his strength and agility, beyond his years, and constantly rode the most spirited and vicious horses to water, with an intrepidity which surprized eve|ry one. While he was in this station, he rode se|veral races for Sir Thomas, and this with such ex|pertness and success, that the neighbouring gen|tlemen frequently solici••••d the knight to permit little Joey (for so he was called) to ride their match|es. The best gamesters, before they laid their money, always enquired which horse little Joey was to ride; and the bets were rather proportion|ed by the rider than by the horse himself; especi|ally after he had scornfully refused a considerable bribe to play booty on such an occasion. This ex|tremely raised his character, and so pleased the lady Booby, that she desired to have him (being now seventeen years of age) for her own foot-boy. Joey was now preferred from the stable to attend on his lady, to go on her errands, stand behind her chair, wait at her tea-table, and carry her prayer-book to church; at which place his voice gave him an opportunity of distinguishing himself by singing psalms: he behaved likewise in every other respect so well at divine service, that it recommended him, to the notice of Mr. Abraham Adams the curate, who took an opportunity one day, as he was drink|ing a cup of ale in Sir Thomas's kitchen, to ask the young man several questions concerning religion;\n\ndescription Page 19\n\nwith his answers to which he was wonderfully pleased.\n\nCHAP. III.\n\nOf Mr. Abraham, Adams the curate, Mrs. Slipslop the chambermaid, and others.\n\nMR. Abraham Adams was an excellent scholar. He was a perfect master of the Greek and Latin languages; to which he added a great share of knowledge in the Oriental tongues, and could read and translate French, Italian, and Spanish. He had applied many years to the most severe study, and had treasured up a fund of learning, rarely to be met with in a university. He was besides a man of good sense, good parts, and good nature; but was at the same time as entirely ignorant of the ways of this world, as an infant just entered into it could possibly be. As he had never any intention to de|ceive, so he never suspected such a design in others. He was generous, friendly, and brave to an excess; but simplicity was his characteristick: he did, no more than Mr. Colley Cibber, apprehend any such passions as malice and envy to exist in man|kind, which was indeed less remarkable in a coun|try parson, than in a gentleman who hath past his life behind the scenes a place which hath been sel|dom thought the school of innocence; and where a very little observation would have convinced the great apologist, that those passions have a real exist|ence in the human mind.\n\nHis virtue, and his other qualifications, as they rendered him equal to his office; so they made him an agreeable and valuable companion, and had so much endeared and well recommended him to a bi|shop,\n\ndescription Page 20\n\nthat at the age of fifty, he was provided with a handsome income of twenty three pounds a year: which, however, he could not make any great figure with; because he lived in a dear county, and was a little incumbered with a wife and six children.\n\nIt was this gentleman, who having, as I have said, observed the singular devotion of young Andrews, had found means to question him concerning several particulars; as how many books there were in the New Testament? which were they? how many chapters they contained? and such like; to all which, Mr. Adams privately said, he answered much better than Sir Thomas, or two other neigh|bouring justices of the peace could probably have done.\n\nMr. Adams was wonderfully solicitous to know at what time, and by what opportunity the youth became acquainted with these matters: Joey told him, that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodness of his father, who, though he had not interest enough to get him into a charity-school, because a cousin of his father's landlord did not vote on the right side for a church-warden in a borough|town, yet had been himself at the expence of six|pence a week for his learning. He told hi•• like|wise, that ever since he was in Sir Thomas's fami|ly, he had employed all his hours of leisure in read|ing good books; that he had read the Bible, the Whole Duty of Man, and Thomas a Kempis; and that as often as he could without being perceiv|ed, he had studied a great book which lay open in the hall-window, where he had read,\n\nas how the devil carried away half a church in sermon-time, without hurting one of the congregation; and as how a field of corn ran away down a steep hill with all the trees upon it, and covered another\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nman's meadow.\n\nThis sufficiently assured Mr. Adams, that the good book meant could be no other than Baker's Chronicle.\n\nThe curate, surprized to find such instances of in|dustry and application in a young man, who had never met with the least encouragement, asked him, if he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education, and the not having been born of parents, who might have indulged his talents and desire of knowledge? To which he answered\n\nHe hoped he had profited somewhat better from the books he had read, than to lament his condition in this world. That for his part, he was perfectly con|tent with the state to which he was called, that he should endeavour to improve his talent, which was all required of him, but not to repine at his own lot, nor envy those of his betters.\n\nWell said, my lad, replied the curate, and I wish some who have read many more good books, nay, and some who have written good books themselves, had profited so much by them.\n\nAdams had no nearer access to Sir Thomas or my lady, than through the waiting gentlewoman; for Sir Thomas was too apt to estimate men merely by their dress, or fortune; and my lady was a woman of gaiety, who had been bless'd with a town edu|cation, and never spoke of any of her country neigh|bours by any other appellation than that of the Brutes. They both regarded the curate as a kind of domestick only, belonging to the parson of the parish, who was at this time at variance with the knight; for the parson had for many years lived in a constant state of civil war, or, which is perhaps, as bad, of civil law, with Sir Thomas himself and the tenants of his manor. The foundation of this quarrel was a modus, by setting which aside, an ad|vantage\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nof several shillings per annum would have ac|crued to the rector: but he had not yet been able to accomplish his purpose; and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the suits than the pleasure (which he used indeed frequently to say was no small one) of reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants, though he had at the same time great|ly impoverished himself.\n\nMrs. Slipslop the waiting-gentlewoman, being herself the daughter of a curate, preserved some re|spect, for Adams; she professed great regard for his learning, and would frequently dispute with him on points of theology: but always insisted on a defe|rence to be paid to her understanding, as she had been frequently at London, and knew more of the world than a country parson could pretend to.\n\nShe had in these disputes a particular advantage over Adams: for she was a mighty affecter of hard words, which she used in such a manner, that the parson, who durst not offend her by calling her words in question, was frequently at some loss to guess her meaning, and would have been much less puzzled by an Arabian manuscript.\n\nAdams therefore took an opportunity one day, af|ter a pretty long discourse with her on the essence, (or, as she pleased to term it, the incence) of matter, to mention the case of young Andrews; desiring her to recommend him to her lady as a youth very susceptible of learning, and one whose instruction in Latin he would himself undertake; by which means he might be qualified for a higher station than that of a footman; and added, she knew it was in his master's power easily to provide for him in a better manner. He therefore desired, that the boy might be left behind, under his care.\n\n\"La, Mr. Adams,\" said Mrs. Slipslop,\n\ndo you,\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nthink my lady will suffer any preamble about any such matter? She is going to London very con|cisely, and I am confidous would not leave Joey behind her on any account; for he is one of the genteelest young fellows you may see in a sum|mer's day, and I am confidous she would as soon think of parting with a pair of her grey mares; for she values herself as much on the one as the other.\n\nAdams would have interrupted but she proceeded:\n\nAnd why is Latin more necessitous for a footman than a gentleman? It is very pro|per that you clergymen must learn it, because you can't preach without it: but I have heard gentle|men say in London, that it is fit for nobody else. I am confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it; and I shall draw myself into no such delemy.\n\nAt which words her lady's bell rung, and Mr. Adams was forced to retire; nor could he gain a second opportunity with her be|fore their London journey, which happened a few days afterwards. However, Andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully to him for his intended kindness, which he told him he never would forget, and at the same time received from the good man many admonitions, concerning the regulation of his future conduct, and his perseverance in innocence and industry.\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\nWhat happened after their journey to London.\n\nNO sooner was young Andrews arrived at Lon|don, than he began to scrape an acquain|tance with his party-coloured brethren who en|deavoured to make him despise his former course\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nof life. His hair was cut after the newest fashion, and became his chief care: he went abroad with it all the morning in papers, and dressed it out in the afternoon. They could not, however, teach him to game, swear, drink, nor any other genteel vice the town abounded with. He applied most of his leisure hours to music, in which he greatly improved himself; and became so perfect a con|noisseur in that art, that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an opera, and they never condemned or applauded a single song contrary to his approbation, or dislike. He was a little too forward in riots at the play-houses and assem|blies: and when he attended his lady at church (which was but seldom) he behaved with less seem|ing devotion than formerly: however, if he was outwardly a pretty fellow, his morals remained entirely uncorrupted, though he was at the same time smarter and genteeler than any of the beaus in town, either in or out of livery.\n\nHis lady, who had often said of him that Joey was the handsomest and genteelest footman in the kingdom, but that it was pity he wanted spirit, began now to find that fault no longer; on the contrary, she was frequently heard to cry out, Ay, there is some life in this fellow. She plainly saw the effects which the town-air hath on the soberest constitutions. She would now walk out with him into Hyde-Park in a morning, and when tired, which happened almost every minute, would lean on his arm, and converse with him in great fami|liarity. Whenever she st••pt out of her coach, she would take him by the hand, and sometimes, for fear of stumbling, press it very hard; she admit|ted him to deliver messages at her bed-side in a morning, leer'd at him at table, and indulged him\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nin all those innocent freedoms which women of figure may permit without the least fully of their virtue.\n\nBut though their virtue remains unsullied, yet, now and then some small arrows will glance on the shadow of it, their reputation; and so it fell out to lady Booby, who happened to be walking arm-in-arm with Joey one morning in Hyde-Park, when lady Tittle and lady Tattle, came accident|ally by in their coach. Bless me, says lady Tittle, can I believe my eyes? Is that lady Booby? Sure|ly, says Tattle. But what makes you surprized? Why, is not that her footman, replied Tittle? At which Tittle laughed and cried, An old business, I assure you, is it possible you should not have heard it? The whole town hath known it this half year. The consequence of this interview was a whisper through a hundred visits, which were separately performed by the two ladies the same afternoon, and might have had a mischievous ef|fect, had it not been stopt by two fresh reputations which were published the day afterwards, and en|grossed the whole talk of the town.\n\nBut whatever opinion or suspicion the scanda|lous inclination of defamers might entertain of la|dy Booby's innocent freedoms, it is certain they made no impression on young Andrews, who ne|ver offered to encroach beyond the liberties which his lady allowed him. A behaviour which she imputed to the violent respect he preserved for her, and which served only to heighten a something she began to conceive, and which the next chapter will open a little farther.\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nCHAP. V.\n\nThe death of Sir Thomas Booby, with the affecti|onate and mournful behaviour of his widow, and the great purity of Joseph Andrews.\n\nAT this time, an accident happened, which put a stop to those agreeable walks, which probably would have soon puffed up the che••ks of same, and caused her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town; and this was no other than the death of Sir Thomas Booby, who departing this life, left his disconsolate lady confined to her house, as closely as if she herself had been attacked by some violent disease. During the first six days the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slipslop, and three female friends, who made a party at cards: but on the seventh she ordered Joey, whom, for a good reason, we shall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her tea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Joseph to her, bade him sit down, and having accidentally laid her hand on his, she asked him, if he had ever been in love? Joseph answer|ed with some confusion, it was time enough for one so young as himself to think on such things. As young as you are, replied the lady, I am con|vinced you are no stranger to that passion; 'Come Joey,' says she, 'tell me truly, who is the happy 'girl whose eyes have made a conquest of you?' Joseph returned, that all the women he had ever seen, were equally indifferent to him. 'O then,'\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nsaid the lady,\n\nyou are a general lover. Indeed, you handsome fellows, like handsome women, are very long and difficult in fixing: but yet you shall never persuade me that your heart is so in|susceptible of affection; I rather impute what you say to your secrecy, a very commendable qua|lity, and what I am far from being angry with you for. Nothing can be more unworthy in a young man than to betray any intimacies with the Ladies.\n\n'Ladies!' madam, said Joseph,\n\nI am sure I never had the impudence to think of any that deserve that name.\n\nDon't pretend to too much modesty, said she, for that sometimes may be impertinent: but pray, answer me this question. Suppose a lady should happen to like you; suppose she should prefer you to all your sex, and admit you to the same familiarities as you might have hoped for, if you had been born her equal, are you certain that no vanity could tempt you to discover her? Answer me honestly, Joseph; have you so much more sense, and so much more virtue, than your handsome young fellows generally have, who make no scruple of sacrificing our dear reputation to your pride, without considering the great obligation we lay on you, by our condescension and confidence? Can you keep a secret, my Joey?\n\n\"Madam, 'says he,\n\nI hope your ladyship can't tax me with ever betraying the secrets of the family; and I hope, if you was to turn me away, I might have that character of you.\n\nI don't intend to turn you away, Joey, said she, and sighed, I am afraid it is not in my power.\n\nShe then raised herself a little in her bed, and discovered one of the whit|est necks that ever was seen; at which Joseph blushed. 'La!' says she, in an affected surprize,\n\ndescription Page 28\n\nwhat am I doing? I have trusted myself with a man alone, naked in bed; suppose you should have any wicked intentions upon my honour, how should I defend myself?\n\nJoseph protested that he never had the least evil design against her. 'No,' says she,\n\nperhaps you may not call your designs wicked; and perhaps they are not so.\n\n—He swore they were not.\n\nYou misunderstand me,\n\nsays she;\n\nI mean, if they were against my honour, they may not be wicked; but the world calls them so. But, then, say you, the world will never know any thing of the matter; yet would not that be trusting to your secrecy? Must not my reputation be then in your power? Would you not then be my master?\n\nJoseph begged her ladyship to be comforted; for that he would never imagine the least wicked thing against her, and that he had rather die a thousand deaths than give her any reason to suspect him. 'Yes,' said she,\n\nI must have reason to suspect you. Are you not a man? and without vanity I may pre|tend to some charms. But perhaps you may fear I should prosecute you; indeed I hope you do; and yet heaven knows I should never have the confidence to appear before a court of justice; and you know, Joey, I am of a forgiving temper. Tell me, Joey, don't you think I should forgive you?\n\n'Indeed, Madam,' says Joseph,\n\nI will never do any thing to disoblige your ladyship.\n\n'How,' says she,\n\ndo you think it would not dis|oblige me then? Do you think I would willing|ly suffer you?\n\nI don't understand you, Madam,\n\nsays Joseph. 'Don't you?' said she,\n\nthen you either are a fool or pretend to be so; I find I was mistaken in you. So get you down stairs, and never let me see your face again: your pre|tended\n\ndescription Page 29\n\ninnocence cannot impose on me.\n\n'Ma|dam,' said Joseph,\n\nI would not have your lady|ship think any evil of me. I have always endea|voured to be a dutiful servant both to you and my master.\n\n'O thou villain!' answered my lady,\n\nWhy didst thou mention the name of that dear man, unless to torment me, to bring his precious memory to my mind,\n\n(and then she burst into a fit of tears.)\n\nGet thee from my sight, I shall never endure thee more.\n\nAt which words she turned away from him; and Joseph retreated from the room in a most disconsolate condition, and writ that letter, which the reader will find in the next chapter.\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\nHow Joseph Andrews writ a letter to his sister Pamela.\n\nTo Mrs. Pamela Andrews, living with squire Booby.\n\nDear Sister,\n\nSINCE I received your letter of your good lady's death, we have had a misfortune of the same kind in our family. My worthy mas|ter Sir Thomas died about four days ago; and, what is worse, my poor lady is certainly gone distracted. None of the servants expected her to take it so to heart, because they quarrelled al|most every day of their lives: but no more of that, because you know, Pamela, I never loved to tell the secrets of my master's family; but to be sure you must have known they never loved one another; and I have heard her ladyship wish his honour dead above a thousand times: but no\n\ndescription Page 30\n\nbody knows what it is to lose a friend till they have lost him.\n\nDon't tell any body what I write, because I should not care to have folks say I discover what passes in our family: but if it had not been so great a lady, I should have thought she had had a-mind to me. Dear Pamela, don't tell any body: but she ordered me to sit down by her bed-side, when she was in naked bed; and she held my hand, and talked exactly as a lady does to her sweet-heart in a stage-play, which I have seen in Covent-Garden, while she wanted him to be no better than he should be.\n\nIf Madam be mad, I shall not care for staying long in the family: so I heartily wish you could get me a place either at the squire's, or some o|ther neighbouring gentleman's, unless it be true that you are going to be married to parson Willi|ams, as folks talk, and then I should be very wil|ling to be his clerk: for which you know I am qualified, being able to read, and to set a psalm.\n\nI fancy I shall be discharged very soon; and the moment I am, unless I hear from you, I shall return to my old master's country-seat, if it be only to see parson Adams, who is the best man in the world. London is a bad place, and there is so little good-fellowship, that the next-door neighbours don't know one another. Pray give my service to all friends that enquire for me; so I rest\n\nYour loving brother, JOSEPH ANDREWS.\n\nAs soon as Joseph had sealed and directed this letter he walked down stairs, where he met Mrs. Slipslop, with whom we shall take this opportunity\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nto bring the reader a little better acquainted. She was a maiden gentlewoman of about forty-five years of age, who having made a small slip in her youth, had continued a good maid ever since. She was not at this time remarkably handsome; being very short, and rather too corpulent in body, and some|what red, with the addition of pimples in the face. Her nose was likewise rather too large, and her eyes too little; nor did she resemble a cow so much in her breath, as in two brown globes which she car|ried before her; one of her legs was also a little shorter than the other, which occasioned her to limp as she walked. This fair creature had long cast the eyes of affection on Joseph, in which she had not met with quite so good success as she probably wish|ed, tho', besides all the allurements of her native charms, she had given him tea, sweetmeats, wine, and many other delicacies, of which, by keeping the keys, she had the absolute command. Joseph, how|ever, had not returned the least gratitude to all these favours, not even so much as a kiss; tho' I would not insinuate she was so easily to be satisfied: for surely then he would have been highly blameable. The truth is, she was arrived at an age when she thought she might indulge herself in any liberties with a man, without the danger of bringing a third person into the world to betray them. She imagin|ed, that by so long a self-denial, she had not only made amends for the small slip of her youth above hinted at: but had likewise laid up a quantity of merit to excuse any future failings. In a word, she resolved to give a loose to her amorous inclina|tions, and to pay off the debt of pleasure she found she owed herself, as fast as possible.\n\nWith these charms of person, and in this dispo|sition of mind, she encountered poor Joseph at the\n\ndescription Page 32\n\nbottom of the stairs, and asked him if he would drink a glass of something good this morning. Joseph, whose spirits were not a little cast down, very rea|dily and thankfully accepted the offer; and together they went into a closet, where having delivered him a full glass of ratifia, and desired him to sit down, Mrs. Slipslop thus began:\n\nSure nothing can be a more simple contrast in a woman, than to place her affections on a boy. If I had ever thought it would have been my fate, I should have wished to die a thousand deaths ra|ther than live to see that day. If we like a man, the lightest hint sophisticates. Whereas a boy proposes upon us to break through all the regula|tions of modesty, before we can make any oppres|sion upon him.\n\nJoseph, who did not understand a word she said, answered, 'Yes, Madam;—' 'Yes, Madam,' replied Mrs Slipslop, with some warmth,\n\nDo you intend to result my passion? Is it not enough, ungrateful as you are, to make no return to all the favours I have done you: but you must treat me with ironing? Barbarous monster! how have I deserved that my passion should be re|sulted and treated with ironing?\n\n'Madam,' an|swered Joseph,\n\nI don't understand your hard words: but I am certain, you have no occasion to call me ungrateful: for so far from intending you any wrong, I always loved you as well as if you had been my own mother.\n\n'How, sirrah!' says Mrs. Slipslop in a rage:\n\nYour own mother? Do you assinuate that I am old enough to be your mother? I don't know what a strippling may think: but I believe a man would refer me to any greensickness silly girl whatsomdever: but I ought to despise you rather than be angry with you, for\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nreferring the conversation of girls to that of a wo|man of sense.\n\n'Madam,' says Joseph,\n\nI am sure I have always valued the honour you did me by your conversation; for I know you are a wo|man of learning.\n\n'Yes, but Joseph,' said she, a little softened by the compliment to her lear|ning,\n\nIf you had a value for me, you certainly would have found some method of shewing it me; for I am convicted you must see the value I have for you. Yes, Joseph, my eyes, whether I would or no, must have declared a passion I cannot con|quer.—Oh! Joseph!\n\nAs when a hungry tigress, who long has tra|versed the woods in fruitless search, sees within the reach of her claws a lamb, she prepares to leap on her prey; or as a voracious pike of immense size, sur|veys thro' the liquid element a roach or gudgeon, which cannot escape her jaws, opens them wide to swallow the little fish; so did Mrs. Slipslop prepare to lay her violent amorous hands on the poor Jo|seph, when luckily her mistress's bell rung, and de|livered the intended martyr from her clutches. She was obliged to leave him abruptly, and to defer the execution of her purpose till some other time. We shall therefore return to the lady Booby, and give our reader some account of her behaviour, after she was left by Joseph in a temper of mind not greatly different from that of the inflamed Slipslop.\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\nSayings of wise men. A dialogue between the lady and her maid; and a panegyric, or rather satire, on the passion of love, in the sublime stile.\n\nIT is the observation of some antient sage, whose name I have forgot, that passions operate diffe|rently on the human mind, as diseases on the body, in proportion to the strength or weakness, soundness or rottenness of the one and the other.\n\nWe hope therefore a judicious reader will give himself some pains to observe, what we have so greatly laboured to describe, the different operations of this passion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of the lady Booby, from those which it effect|ed in the less polished and coarser disposition of Mrs. Slipslop.\n\nAnother philosopher, whose name also at present escapes my memory, hath somewhere said, that re|solutions taken in the absence of the beloved object, are very apt to vanish in its presence; on both which wise sayings, the following chapter may serve as a comment.\n\nNo sooner had Joseph left the room in the man|ner we had before related, than the lady, enraged at her disappointment, began to reflect with severity on her conduct. Her love was now changed to disdain, which pride assisted to torment her. She despised herself for the meanness of her passion, and Joseph for its ill success. However, she had now got the better of it in her own opinion, and deter|mined immediately to dismiss the object. After much tossing and turning in her bed, and many so|liloquies, which, if we had no better matter for our\n\ndescription Page 35\n\nreader, we would give him; she at last rung the bell as above-mentioned, and was presently attended by Mrs. Slipslop, who was not much better pleased with Joseph than the lady herself.\n\nSlipslop, said lady Booby, when did you see Jo|seph? the poor woman was so surprized at the un|expected sound of his name, at so critical a time, that she had the greatest difficulty to conceal the confusion she was under, from her mistress; whom she answered, nevertheless, with pretty good confi|dence, though not entirely void of fear or suspicion, that she had not seen him that morning.\n\nI am a|fraid,\n\nsaid lady Booby,\n\nhe is a wild young fel|low.\n\n'That he is,' said Slipslop,\n\nand a wicket one too. To my knowledge he games, drinks, swears, and fights eternally: besides, he is horri|bly indicted to wenching.\n\n'Ay!' said the lady,\n\nI never heard that of him.\n\n'O madam,' answer|ed the other,\n\nhe is so lewd a rascal, that if your ladyship keeps him much longer, you will not have one virgin in your house except myself. And yet I can't conceive what the wenches see in him, to be so foolishly fond as they are: in my eyes, he is as ugly a scarecrow as ever I upheld.\n\n'Nay,' said the lady, 'the boy is well enough.'—\n\nLa, Ma'm, cries Slipslop, I think him the ragmatical|lest fellow in the family.\n\n'Sure, Slipslop,' says she,\n\nyou are mistaken: but which of the women do you suspect?\n\n'Madam,' says Slipslop,\n\nthere is Betty the chambermaid, I am almost convict|ed, is with child by him.\n\n'Ay!' says the lady,\n\nthen pray pay her her wages instantly. I will keep no such sluts in my family.\n\nAnd as for Joseph, you may discard him too.\n\nWould your ladyship have him paid off immediately?\n\ncries Slipslop,\n\nfor perhaps, when Betty is gone, he may\n\ndescription Page 36\n\nmend; and really the boy is a good servant, and a strong healthy, luscious boy enough.\n\nThis morning,\n\nanswered the lady with some vehe|mence. 'I wish Madam,' cries Slipslop,\n\nyour ladyship would be so good as to try him a little longer.\n\nI will not have my commands disput|ed,\n\nsaid the lady;\n\nsure you are not fond of him yourself.\n\n'I Madam?' cries Slipslop, reddening, if not blushing.\n\nI should be sorry to think your ladyship had any reason to respect me of fondness for a fellow; and if it be your pleasure, I shall ful|fil it with as much reluctance as possible.\n\nAs little, I suppose you mean,\n\nsaid the lady;\n\nand so about it instantly.\n\nMrs. Slipslop went out, and the lady had scarce taken two turns, before she fell to knocking and ringing with great violence. Slip|slop, who did not travel post-haste, soon returned, and was countermanded as to Joseph, but ordered to send Betty about her business without delay. She went out a second time with much greater alacrity than before; when the lady began immediately to accuse herself of want of resolution, and to appre|hend the return of her affection with it's pernicious consequences: she therefore applied herself again to the bell, and resummoned Mrs. Slipslop into her presence; who again returned, and was told by her mistress, that she had considered better of the mat|ter, and was absolutely resolved to turn away Jo|seph; which she ordered her to do immediately. Slipslop, who knew the violence of her lady's tem|per, and would not venture her place for any Ado|nis or Hercules in the universe, left her a third time; which she had no sooner done, than the little god Cupid, fearing he had not yet done the lady's bu|siness, took a fresh arrow with the sharpest po•••• out of his quiver, and shot it directly into her\n\ndescription Page 37\n\nheart: in other and plainer language, the lady's passion got the better of her reason. She called back Slipslop once more, and told her, she had re|solved to see the boy, and examine him herself; therefore bid her send him up. This wavering in her mistress's temper probably put something into the waiting-gentlewoman's head, not necessary to mention to the sagacious reader.\n\nLady Booby was going to call her back again, but could not prevail with herself. The next con|sideration therefore was, how she should behave to Joseph when he came in. She resolved to preserve all the dignity of the woman of fashion to her servant, and to indulge herself in this last view of Joseph (for that she was most certainly re|solved it should be) at his own expence, by first insulting, and then discarding them.\n\nO Love, what monstrous tricks dost thou play with thy votaries of both sexes! How dost thou deceive them, and make them deceive themselves! Their follies are thy delight! Their sighs make thee laugh, and their pangs are thy merriment!\n\nNot the great Rich, who turns men into mon|keys, wheelbarrows, and whatever else best hu|mours his fancy, hath so strangely metamorphosed the human shape; nor the great Cibber, who con|founds all number, gender, and breaks thro' every rule of grammar at his will, hath so distorted the English, language, as thou dost metamorphose and distort the human senses.\n\nThou puttest out our eyes, stoppest up our ears, and takest away the power of our nostrils; so that we can neither see the largest object, hear the loudest noise, nor smell the most poignant per|fume. Again, when thou pleasest, thou canst make a mole-hill appear as a mountain; a Jew's\n\ndescription Page 38\n\nharp sound like a trumpet, and a daizy smell like a violet. Thou canst make cowardice, brave, ava|rice generous, pride humble, and cruelty, tender|hearted. In short, thou turnest the heart of man inside out, as a juggler doth a petticoat, and bring|est whatsoever pleaseth thee out from it. If there be any one who doubts all this, let him read the next chapter.\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\nIn which, after some very fine writing, the history goes on, and relates the interview between the lady and Joseph; where the latter hath set an example, which we despair of seeing followed by his sex, in this vicious age.\n\nNOW the rake Hesperus had called for his breeches, and having well rubbed his drow|sy eyes, prepared to dress himself for all night; by whose example his brother rakes on earth like wise leave those beds, in which they had slept away the day. Now Thetis, the good housewife, be|gan to put on the pot in order to regale the good man Phoebus, after his daily labours were over. In vulgar language, it was in the evening when Joseph attended his lady's orders.\n\nBut as it becomes us to preserve the character of this lady, who is the heroine of our tale; and, as we have naturally a wonderful tenderness for that beautiful part of the human species, called the fair sex; before we discover too much of her frail|ty to our reader, it will be proper to give him a lively idea of the vast temptation, which overcame all the efforts of a modest and virtuous mind; 〈◊〉〈◊〉 then we humbly hope his good-nature will rather\n\ndescription Page 39\n\npity than condemn the imperfection of human vir|tue.\n\nNay, the ladies themselves will, we hope, be in|duced, by considering the uncommon variety of charms, which united in this young man's person, to bridle their rampant passion for chastity, and be at least as mild as their violent modesty and virtue will permit them, in censuring the conduct of a woman, who, perhaps, was in her own dispositi|on as chaste as those pure and sanctified virgins, who, after a life innocently spent in the gaieties of the town, begin about fifty to attend twice per diem at the polite churches and chapels, to return thanks for the grace which preserved them formerly amongst beaus, from temptations perhaps less pow|erful than what now attack the lady Booby.\n\nMr. Joseph Andrews was now in the one and twentieth year of his age. He was of the highest degree of middle stature. His limbs were put to|gether with great elegance, and no less strength. His legs and thighs were formed in the exactest proportion. His shoulders were broad and braw|ny; but yet his arms hung so easily, that he had all the symptoms of strength without the least clum|siness. His hair was of a nut-brown colour, and was displayed in wanton ringlets down his back. His forehead was high, his eyes dark, and as full of sweetness as of fire. His nose a little inclined to the Roman. His tee•••• white and ••en. His lips full, red, and soft. ••is beard was only rough on his chin and upper lip; but his cheeks, in which his blood glowed, were overspread with a thick down. His countenance had a tenderness joined with a sensibility inexpressible. Add to this the most perfect neatness in his dress, and an air,\n\ndescription Page 40\n\nwhich to those who have not seen many noblemen, would give an idea of nobility.\n\nSuch was the person who now appeared before the lady. She viewed him some time in silence, and twice or thrice before she spake, changed her mind as to the manner in which she should begin. At length, she said to him,\n\nJoseph, I am sorry to hear such complaints against you; I am told you behave so rudely to the maids, that they cannot do their business in quiet; I mean those who are not wicked enough to hearken to your solicitations. As to others, they may perhaps not call you rude: for there are wicked sluts who make one ashamed of one's own sex; and are as ready to admit any nauseous familiarity as fellows to offer it; nay, there are such in my family; but they shall not stay in it; that impudent trollop, who is with child by you, is discharged by this time.\n\nAs a person who is struck through the heart with a thunderbolt, looks extremely surprised, nay, and perhaps is so too—thus the poor Joseph received the false accusation of his mistress; he blushed and looked confounded, which she misinterpreted to be symptoms of his guilt and thus went on:\n\nCome hither, Joseph: another mistress might discard you for these offences; but I have com|passion for your youth, and if I could be certain you would, be no more guilty—Consider, child, (laying her hand carelesly upon his) you are a handsome young fellow, and might do better; you might make your fortune.\n\n—\n\nMadam, said Jo|seph, I do assure your ladyship, I don't know whe|ther any maid in the house is man or woman. Oh fie! Joseph\n\nanswered the lady,\n\ndon't com|mit another crime in denying the truth. I could pardon the first; but I hate a lyar.\n\n'Madam\n\ndescription Page 41\n\ncries Joseph,\n\nI hope your ladyship will not be of|fended at my asserting my innocence: for by all that is sacred, I have never offered more than kis|sing.\n\n'Kissing!' said the lady with great dis|composure of countenance, and more redness in her cheeks, than anger in her eyes,\n\ndo you call that no crime? kissing, Joseph, is as a prologue to a play. Can I believe a young fellow of your age and complexion will be content with kissing? No, Jo|seph, there is no woman who grants that, but will grant more; and I am deceived greatly in you, if you would not put her closely to it. What would you think, Joseph, if I admitted you to kiss me?\n\nJoseph reply'd,\n\nhe would sooner die than have any such thought.\n\n'And yet, Joseph,' returned she,\n\nladies have admitted their footmen to such famili|arities; and footmen, I confess to you much less deserving them; fellows without half your charms: for such might almost excuse the crime. Tell me therefore, Joseph, if I should admit you to such freedoms, what would you think of me?—tell me freely.\n\n'Madam,' said Joseph,\n\nI should think your ladyship condescended a great deal be|low yourself.\n\n'Pugh!' said she,\n\nthat I am to answer to myself: but would not you insist on more? Would you be contented with a kiss? Would not your inclinations be all on fire rather by such a favour?\n\n'Madam,' said Joseph,\n\nif they were, I hope I should be able to controul them, without suffering them to get the better of my virtue.\n\n—You have heard, reader, poets talk of the statue of surprize; you have heard likewise, or else you have heard very little, how surprize made one of the sons of Croesus speak tho' he was dumb. You have seen the faces, in the eighteen-penny gal|lery, when through the trap-door, to soft or no mu|sick,\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nMr. Bridgwater, Mr. William Mills, or some other of ghostly appearance, hath ascended with a face all pale with powder, and a shirt all bloody with ribands; but from none of these, nor from Phidias, or Praxiteles, if they should return to life—no, not from the inimitable pencil of my friend Hogarth, could you receive such an idea of surprize, as would have entered in at your eyes, had they be|held the lady Booby, when those last words issued out from the lips of Joseph.—'Your virtue! (said the lady recovering after a silence of two minutes)\n\nI shall never survive it. Your virtue! Intolerable confidence! Have you the assurance to pretend, that when a lady demeans herself to throw aside the rules of decency, in order to honour you with the highest favours in her power, your virtue should resist her inclination? that when she had conquer|ed her own virtue, she should find an obstruction in yours?\n\n'Madam,' said Joseph,\n\nI can't see why her having no virtue should be a reason a|gainst my having any: Or why, because I am a man, or because I am poor, my virtue must be sub|servient to her pleasures.\n\nI am out of pati|ence,\n\ncries the lady:\n\nDid ever mortal hear of a man's virtue! Did ever the greatest or the gravest men pretend to any of this kind! Will magi|strates who punish lewdness, or parsons who preach against it, make any scruple, of committing it? And can a boy, a stripling have the confi|dence to talk of his vir••ue?\n\n'Madam,' says Jo|seph,\n\nthat boy is the brother of Pamela, and would be ashamed that the chastity of his family, which is preserved in her, should be stained in him. If there are such men as your ladyship mentions, I am sorry for it; and I wish they had an opportu|nity of reading over those letters, which my father\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nhath sent me of my sister Pamela's; nor do I doubt but such an example would amend them.\n\nYou impudent villain,\n\ncries the lady in a rage,\n\ndo you insult me with the follies of my relation, who hath exposed himself all over the country up|on your sister's account? a little vixen, whom I have always wondered my late lady Booby ever kept in her house. Sirrah! get out of my sight, and prepare to set out this night; for I will order you your wages immediately, and you shall be stripped and turned away.\n\n—'Madam,' says Jo|seph,\n\nI am sorry I have offended your ladyship, I am sure I never intended it.\n\n'Yes, sirrah,' cries she,\n\nyou have had the vanity to misconstru•• the lit|tle innocent freedom I took in order to try, whe|ther what I heard was true. O' my conscience, you have had the assurance to imagine, I was fond of you myself.\n\nJoseph answered, he had only spoke out of tenderness for his virtue; at which words she flew into a violent passion, and, refusing to hear more, ordered him instantly to leave the room.\n\nHe was no sooner gone, than she burst forth into the following exclamation;\n\nWhither doth this vi|olent passion hurry us? What meannesses do we submit to from its impulse? Wisely we resist its first and least approaches; for it is then only we can assure ourselves the victory. No woman could ever safely say, so far only will I go. Have I not exposed myself to the refusal of my footman? I cannot bear the reflection.\n\nUpon which she ap|plied herself to the bell, and rung it with infinite more violence than was necessary; the faithful S••ip|slop attending near at hand: To say the truth, she had conceived a suspicion at her last interview with her mistress; and had waited ever since in the anti|chamber, having carefully applied her ears to the\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nkey-hole during the whole time that the preceding conversation passed between Joseph and the lady.\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\nWhat passed between the lady and Mrs. Slipslop, in which we prophecy there are some strokes which eve|ry one will not truly comprehend at the first reading.\n\nSLIPSLOP, said the lady, I find too much reason to believe all thou hast told me of this wicked Joseph; I have determined to part with him instantly; so go you to the steward, and bid him pay him his wages.\n\nSlipslop, who had pre|served hitherto a distance to her lady, rather out of necessity than inclination, and who thought the knowledge of this secret had thrown down all dis|tinction between them, answered her mistress ve|ry pertly,\n\nShe wished she knew her own mind; and that she was certain she would call her back again, before she was got half-way down stairs.\n\nThe lady replied,\n\nshe had taken a resolution, and was resolved to keep it.\n\n'I am sorry for it', cries Slipslop;\n\nand if I had known you would have punished the poor lad so severely, you should never have heard a particle of the matter. Here's a fuss, indeed, about nothing\n\n'Nothing!' re|turned my lady;\n\nDo you think I will counte|nance lewdness in my house?\n\nIf you will turn away every footman,\n\nsaid Slipslop,\n\nthat is a lover of the sport, you must soon open the coach|door yourself, or get a set of mophrodites to wait upon you; and I am sure I hated the sight of them even singing in an opera.\n\n'Do as I bid you', says my lady,\n\nand don't shock my ears, with your beastly language.\n\n'Marry-come-up,' cries Slip|slop,\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nPeople's ears are sometimes the nicest part about them.\n\nThe lady, who began to admire the new style in which her waiting-gentlewoman delivered her|self, and by the conclusion of her speech, suspect|ed somewhat of the truth, called her back, and de|sired to know what she meant by the extraordinary degree of freedom in which she thought proper to indulge her tongue. 'Freedom!' says Slipslop,\n\nI don't know what you call freedom! Madam; servants have tongues as well as their mistresses. Yes, and saucy ones too, answered the lady; but I assure you I shall bear no such impertinence. Impertinence! I don't know that I am imper|tinent,\n\nsays Slipslop. 'Yes indeed you are,' cries my lady;\n\nand unless you mend your man|ners, this house is no place for you.\n\nMan|ners!\n\ncries Slipslop,\n\nI never was thought to want manners nor modesty neither; and for places, there are more places than one; and I know what I know.\n\nWhat do you know, mistress?\n\nanswered the lady.\n\nI am not oblig|ed to tell that to every body,\n\nsays Slipslop, any more than I am obliged to keep it a secret.' I desire you would provide yourself, answered the lady. 'With all my heart,' replied the waiting|gentlewoman; and so departed in a passion, and slapped the door after her.\n\nThe lady too plainly perceived that her waiting|gentlewoman knew more than she would wil|lingly have had her acquainted with; and this she imputed to Joseph's having discovered to her what passed at the first interview. This therefore blew up her rage against him, and confirmed her in a resolution of parting with him.\n\nBut the dismissing Mrs. Slipslop was a point not so ea••y to be resolved upon: she had the utmost,\n\ndescription Page 46\n\ntenderness for her reputation, as she knew on that depended many of the most valuable blessings of life; particularly cards, making curt'sies in pub|lic places, and, above all, the pleasure of demolish|ing the reputations of others, in which innocent amusement she had an extraordinary delight. She therefore determined to submit to any insult from a servant, rather than run a risk of losing the title to so many great privileges.\n\nShe therefore sent for her steward, Mr. Peter Pounce; and ordered him to pay Joseph his wages, to strip off his livery, and turn him out of the house that evening.\n\nShe then called Slipslop up, and after refreshing her spirits with a small cordial which she kept in her closet, she began in the following manner:\n\nSlipslop, why will you, who know my passi|onate temper, attempt to provoke me by your answers? I am convinced you are an honest ser|vant, and should be very unwilling to part with you. I believe likewise you have found me an indulgent mistress on many occasions, and have as little reason on your side to desire a change. I can't help being surprized therefore, that you will take the surest method to offend me: I mean repeating my words, which you know I have al|ways detested.\n\nThe prudent waiting-gentlewoman had duly weighed the whole matter, and found on mature deliberation, that a good place in possession was better than one in expectation. As she found her mistress therefore inclined to relent, she thought proper also to put on some small condescension; which was as readily accepted: and so the affair was reconciled, all offences forgiven, and a present of a gown and petticoat made her as an instance of her lady's future favour.\n\ndescription Page 47\n\nShe offered once or twice to speak in favour of Jo|seph: but found her lady's heart so obdurate, that she prudently dropt all such efforts. She consider|ed there were some more footmen in the house, and some as stout fellows, tho' not quite so handsome as Joseph: besides, the reader hath already seen her ten|der advances had not met with the encouragement she might have reasonably expected. She thought she had thrown away a great deal of sack and sweet|meats on an ungrateful ra|scal; and being a little in|clined to the opinion of that female sect, who hold one lusty young fellow to be near as good as another lusty young fellow, she at last gave up Joseph and his cause, and with a triumph over her passion high|ly commendable, walked off with her present, and with great tranquility paid a visit to a stone-bottle, which is of sovereign use to a philosophical temper.\n\nShe left not her mistress so easy. The poor lady could not reflect without agony, that her dear repu|tation was in the power of her servants. All her comfort, as to Joseph, was, that she hoped he did not understand her meaning; at least, she could say for herself, she had not plainly express'd any thing to him; and as to Mrs. Slipslop, she imagined she could bribe her to secrecy.\n\nBut what hurt her most was, that in reality she had not so entirely conquered her passion; the little god lay lurking in her heart, tho' anger and disdain so hoodwinked her, that she could not see him. She was a thousand times on the very brink of revoking the sentence she had passed against the poor youth. Love became his advocate, and whispered many things in his favour. Honour likewise endeavour|ed to vindicate his crime, and pity to mitigate his punishment; on the other side, pride and revenge spoke as loudly against him; and thus the poor lady\n\ndescription Page 48\n\nwas tortured with perplexity, opposite passions dis|tracting and tearing her mind different ways.\n\nSo I have seen, in the hall of Westminster, where serjeant Bramble hath been retained on the right side, and serjeant Puzzle on the left, the balance of opinion (so equal were their ••ees) alternately incline to either scale. Now Bramble throws in an argu|ment, and Pu••••••e's scale strikes the beam; again, Bramble shares the like fate, overpowered by the weight of Puzzle. Her Bramble hits, there Puz|zle strikes; here one has you, there t'other has you, 'till at last all becomes one scene of confusion in the tortured minds of the hearers; equal wagers are laid on the success, and neither judge nor jury can possibly make any thing of the matter; all things are so enveloped by the careful serjeants in doubt and obscurity.\n\nOr as it happens in the conscience, where ho|nour and honesty pull one way, and a bribe and ne|cessity another.—If it was our present business only to make similies, we could produce many more to this purpose: but a simile (as well as a word) to the wise. We shall therefore see a little after our hero, for whom the reader is doubtless in some pain.\n\nCHAP. X.\n\nJoseph writes another letter: His transactions with Mr. Peter Pounce, &c. with his departure from lady Booby.\n\nTHE disconsolate Joseph would not have had a•• understanding sufficient for the principal sub|ject of such a book as this, if he had any longer mis|understood the drift of his mistress; and indeed that he did not discern it sooner, the reader will be pleased\n\ndescription Page 49\n\nto apply to an unwillingness in him to discover what he must condemn in her as a fault. Having there|fore quitted her presence, he retired into his own garret, and entered himself into an ejaculation on the numberless calamities which attended beauty, and the misfortune it was to be handsomer than one's neighbours.\n\nHe then sat down and addressed himself to his sis|ter Pamela, in the following words:\n\nDear sister Pamela,\n\nHOPING you are well, what news have I to tell you! O Pamela, my mistress is fal|len in love with me—That is, what great folks call falling in love, she has a mind to ruin me; but I hope I shall have more resolution and more grace than to part with my virtue to any lady upon earth.\n\nMr. Adams hath often told me, that chastity is as great a virtue in a man as in a woman. He says he never knew any more than his wife, and I shall endeavour to follow his example. Indeed, it is owing entirely to his excellent sermons and advice, together with your letters, that I have been able to resist a temptation, which he says no man complies with, but he repents in this world, or is damned for it in the next; and why should I trust to repentance on my death-bed, since I may die in my sleep? What fine things are good advice and good examples! But I am glad she turned me out of the chamber as she did: for I had once almost forgotten every word parson A|dams had ever said to me.\n\nI don't doubt, dear sister, but you will have grace to preserve your virtue against all trials; and I beg you earnestly to pray, I may be enabled\n\ndescription Page 50\n\nto preserve mine; for truly it is very severely at|tacked by more than one: but, I hope I shall co|py your example, and that of Joseph my name|sake: and maintain my virtue against all tempta|tions.\n\nJoseph had not finished his letter, when he was summoned down stairs by Mr. Peter Pounce, to re|ceive his wages; for, besides that out of eight pounds a year he allowed his father and mother four, he had been obliged, in order to furnish himself with mu|sical instruments, to apply to the generosity of the aforesaid Peter, who on urgent occasions, used to advance the servants their wages: not before they were due, but before they were payable; that is, perhaps, half a year after they were due, and this at the moderate praemium of fifty per cent▪ or a little more; by which charitable methods, together with lending money to other people, and even to his own master and mistress, the honest man had from no|thing, in a few years amassed a small sum of twenty thousand pounds or thereabouts.\n\nJoseph having received his little remainder of wa|ges, and having stript off his livery, was forced to borrow a frock and breeches of one of the servants: (for he was so beloved in the family, that they would all have lent him any thing) and being told by Pe|ter, that he must not stay a moment longer in the house than was necessary to pack up his linen, which he easily did in a very narrow compass; he took a very melancholy leave of his fellow-servants, and set out at seven in the evening.\n\nHe had proceeded the length of two or three streets, before he absolutely determined with him|self, whether he should leave the town that night, or, procuring, a lodging, wait till the morning. At last, the moon shining very bright helped him to come\n\ndescription Page 51\n\nto a resolution of beginning his journey immediate|ly, to which likewise he had some other induce|ments; which the reader, without being a conjurer, cannot possibly guess, till we have given him those hints, which it may be now proper to open.\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\nOf several new matters not expected.\n\nIT is an observation sometimes made, that to in|dicate our idea of a simple fellow, we say, he is easily to be seen through: Nor do I believe it a more improper denotation of a simple book. Instead of applying this to any particular performance, we chuse rather to remark the contrary in this history, where the scene opens itself by small degrees; and he is a saga ous reader who can see two chapters before him.\n\nFor this reason we have not hitherto hinted a matter which now seems necessary to be explained; since it may be wondered at, first, that Joseph made such extraordinary haste out of town, which hath been already shewn; and secondly, which will be now shewn, that instead of proceeding to the habitation of his father and mother, or to his beloved sister Pa|mela, he chose rather to set out full speed to the lady Booby's country seat, which he had left on his jour|ney to London.\n\nBe it known then, that in the same parish where this seat stood, there lived a young girl whom Joseph (tho' the best of sons and brothers) longed more im|patiently to see than his parents or his sister. She was a poor girl, who had formerly been bred up in Sir John's family; whence, a little before the jour|ney to London, she had been discarded by Mrs.\n\ndescription Page 52\n\nSlipslop on account of her extraordinary beauty: for I never could find any other reason.\n\nThis young creature (who now lived with a far|mer in the parish) had been always beloved by Jo|seph, and returned his affection. She was two years only younger than our hero. They had been ac|quainted from their infancy, and had conceived a very early liking for each other, which had grown to such a degree of affection, that Mr. Adams had with much ado prevented them from marrying, and persuaded them to wait, till a few years service and thrift had a little improved their experience, and en|abled them to live comfortably together.\n\nThey followed this good man's advice, as indeed his word was little less than a law in his parish; for as he had shewn his parishoners by an uniform be|haviour of thirty-five years duration, that he had their good entirely at heart; so they consulted him on every occasion, and very seldom acted contrary to his opinion.\n\nNothing can be imagined more tender than was the parting between these two lovers. A thousand sighs heaved the bosom of Joseph; a thousand tears distilled from the lovely eyes of Fanny, (for that was her name) tho' her modesty would only suffer her to admit his eager kisses, her violent love made her more than passive in his embraces; and she often pulled him to her breast with a soft pressure, which tho' perhaps it would not have squeezed an insect to death, caused more emotion in the heart of Jo|seph, than the closest Cornish hug could have done.\n\nThe reader may perhaps wonder, that so fond a pair should during a twelvemonth's absence never converse with one another; indeed there was but one reason which did, or could have prevented them; and this was, that poor Fanny could neither\n\ndescription Page 53\n\nwrite nor read; nor could she be prevailed upon to transmit the delicacies of her tender and chaste pas|sion, by the hands of an amanuensis.\n\nThey contented themselves therefore with fre|quent enquiries after each other's health, with a mutual confidence in each other's fidelity, and the prospect of their future happiness.\n\nHaving explained these matters to our reader, and, as far as possible, satisfied all his doubts, we return to honest Joseph, whom we left just set out on his travels by the light of the moon.\n\nThose who have read any romance or poetry an|tient or modern, must have been informed, that love hath wings; by which they are not to understand, as some young ladies by mistake have done, that a lover can fly; the writers, by this ingenious allego|ry, intended to insinuate no more, than that lovers do not march like horse-guards; in short, that they put the best leg foremost; which our lusty youth, who could walk with any man, did so heartily on this occasion, that within four hours, he reached a famous house of hospitality well known to the west|ern traveller. It presents you a lion on a sign-post: and the master, who was christened Timotheus, is commonly called plain Tim. Some hath conceived that he hath particularly chosen the lion for his sign, as he doth in countenance greatly resemble that mag|nanimous beast, tho' his disposition favours more of the sweetness of the lamb. He is a person well re|ceived among all sorts of men, being qualified to render himself agreeable to any; as he is well ver|sed in history and politicks, hath a smattering in law and divinity, cracks a good jest, and plays won|derfully well on the French horn.\n\nA violent storm of hail forced Joseph to take shel|ter in this inn, where he remembered Sir Thomas\n\ndescription Page 54\n\nhad dined in his way to town. Joseph had no soon|er seated himself by the kitchen fire, than Timothe|us, observing his livery, began to condole the loss of his late master; who was, he said, his very parti|cular and intimate acquaintance, with whom he had cracked many a merry bottle, aye many a dozen in his time. He then remarked, that all those things were over now, all past, and just as if they had never been; and concluded with an excellent observation on the certainty of death, which his wife said was indeed very true. A fellow now arrived at the same inn with two horses, one of which he was leading farther down into the country to meet his master; these he put into the stable, and came and took his place by Joseph's side, who immediately knew him to be the servant of a neighbouring gentleman, who used to visit at their house.\n\nThis fellow was likewise forced in by the storm; for he had orders to go twenty miles farther that evening, and luckily on the same road which Jo|seph himself intended to take. He therefore em|braced this opportunity of complimenting his friend with his master's horses, (notwithstanding he had received express commands to the contra|ry) which was readily accepted, and so after they had drank a loving pot, and the storm was over, they set out together.\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\nContaining many surprizing adventures which Joseph Andrews met with on the road, scarce credible to those who have never travelled in a stage-coach.\n\nNOTHING remarkable happened on the road, till their arrival at the inn to which the hor|ses\n\ndescription Page 55\n\nwere ordered; whither they came about two in the morning. The moon then shone very bright; and Joseph making his friend a present of a pint of wine, and thanking him for the favour of his horse, notwithstanding all entreaties to the contrary, proceeded on his journey on foot.\n\nHe had not gone above two miles, charmed with the hopes of shortly seeing his beloved Fanny, when he was met by two fellows in a narrow lane, and ordered to stand and deliver. He readily gave them all the money he had, which was somewhat less than two pounds; and told them he hoped they would be so generous as to return him a few shil|lings, to defray his charges on his way home.\n\nOne of the ruffians answered with an oath, yes, we'll give you something presently: but first strip and be d—n'd to you.—Strip, cry'd the other, or I'll blow your brains to the devil. Joseph re|membering that he had borrowed his coat and breeches of a friend, and that he should be asham|ed of making any excuse for not returning them, replied, he hoped they would not insist on his cloaths, which were not worth much, but consider the coldness of the night. You are cold, are you, you rascal! says one of the robbers, I'll warm you with a vengeance; and damning his eyes, snapt a pis|tol at his head: which he had no sooner done, than the other levelled a blow at him with his stick, which Joseph, who was expert at cudgel-playing, caught with his, and returned the favour so suc|cessfully on his adversary, that he laid him spraw|ling at his feet, and at the same instant received a blow from behind, with the but-end of a pistol from the other villain, which felled him to the ground, and totally deprived him of his senses.\n\nThe thief, who had been knocked down, had\n\ndescription Page 56\n\nnow recovered himself; and both together fell to belabouring poor Joseph with their sticks, till they were convinced they had put an end ••o his misera|ble being: They then stript him entirely naked, threw him into a ditch, and departed with their booty.\n\nThe poor wretch, who lay motionless a long time, just began to recover his senses as a stage|coach came by. The postilion hearing a man's groans, stopt his horses, and told the coachman, he was certain there was a dead man lying in the ditch; for he heard him groan. 'Go on, sirrah,' says the coachman,\n\nwe are confounded late, and have no time to look after dead men.\n\nA lady, who heard what the postilion said, and like|wise heard the groan, called eagerly to the coach|man, to stop and see what was the matter. Upon which he bid the postilion alight, and look into the ditch. He did so, and returned,\n\nThat there was a man sitting upright as naked as ever he was born.—O J—sus,\n\ncry'd the lady,\n\nA naked man! Dear coachman, drive on and leave him.\n\nUpon this the gentlemen got out of the coach; and Joseph begged them to have mercy upon him: For that he had been robbed, and almost beaten to death. 'Robbed,' cries an old gentleman;\n\nLet us make all the haste imaginable, or we shall be robbed too.\n\nA young man who belonged to the law answered,\n\nHe wished they had passed by with|out taking any notice; but that now they might be proved to have been last in his company; if he should die, they might be called to some ac|count for his murder. He therefore thought it advisable to save the poor creature's life, for their own sakes, if possible; at least, if he died, to prevent the jury's finding that they fled for it.\n\ndescription Page 57\n\nHe was therefore of opinion, to take the man in|to the coach, and carry him to the next inn.\n\nThe lady insisted,\n\nThat he should not come into the coach. That if they lifted him in, she would herself alight: for she had rather stay in that place to all eternity, than ride with a naked man.\n\nThe coachman objected,\n\nThat he could not suf|fer him to be taken in, unless somebody would pay a shilling for his carriage the four miles.\n\nwhich the two gentlemen refused to do. But the lawyer, who was afraid of some mischief happen|ing to himself if the wretch was left behind in that condition, saying, no man could be too cauti|ous in these matters, and that he remembered very extraordinary cases in the books, threatened the coachman, and bid him deny taking him up at his peril; for that if he died, he should be indicted for his murder; and if he lived, and brought an acti|on against him, he would willingly take a brief in it. These words had a sensible effect on the coach|man, who was well acquainted with the person who spoke them; and the old gentleman above|mentioned, thinking the naked man would afford him frequent opportunities of shewing his wit to the lady, offered to join with the company in giv|ing a mug of beer for his fare; till partly alarmed by the threats of the one, and partly by the pro|mises of the other, and being, perhaps, a little moved with compassion at the poor creature's con|dition, who stood bleeding and shivering with the cold, he at length agreed; and Joseph was now advancing to the coach, where, seeing the lady, who held the sticks of her fan before her eyes, he absolutely refused, miserable as he was, to enter, unless he was furnished with sufficient covering, to prevent giving the least offence to decency. So\n\ndescription Page 58\n\nperfectly modest was this young man; such migh|ty effects had the spotless example of the amiable Pamela, and the excellent sermons of Mr. Adams, wrought upon him.\n\nThough there were several great coats about the coach, it was not easy to get over the difficulty which Joseph had started. The two gentlemen complained they were cold, and could not spare a rag; the man of wit saying, with a laugh, that charity began at home; and the coachman, who had two great coats spread under him, refused to lend either, lest they should be made bloody; the lady's footman desired to be excused for the same reason, which the lady herself, notwithstanding her abhorrence of a naked man, approved; and it is more than probable, poor Joseph, who obstinate|ly adhered to his modest resolution, must have pe|rished, unless the postilion, (a lad who hath been since transported for robbing a henroost) had vo|luntarily stript off a great coat, his only garment, at the same time swearing a great oath (for which he was rebuked by the passengers)\n\nThat he would rather ride in his shirt all his life, than suffer a fel|low-creature to lie in so miserable a condition.\n\nJoseph, having put on the great coat, was lifted into the coach, which now proceeded on its jour|ney. He declared himself almost dead with the cold, which gave the man of wit an occasion to ask the lady, if she could not accommodate him with a dram. She answered with some resent|ment,\n\nShe wondered at his asking her such a question; but assured him she never tasted any such thing.\n\nThe lawyer was enquiring into the circumstan|ces of the robbery, when the coach stopt, and one of the ruffians putting a pistol in, demanded their\n\ndescription Page 59\n\nmoney of the passengers; who readily gave it them; and the lady, in her fright, delivered up a little silver bottle, of about a half pint size, which the rogue, clapping it to his mouth, and drinking her health, declared it held some of the best Nan|tes he had ever tasted: this the lady afterwards assured the company was the mistake of her maid; for that she had ordered her to fill the bottle with Hungary-water.\n\nAs soon as the fellows were departed, the law|yer, who had, it seems, a case of pistols in the seat of the coach, informed the company, that if it had been day-light, and he could have come at his pistols, he would not have submitted to the robbe|ry; he likewise set forth, that he had often met highwaymen when he travelled on horseback, but none ever durst attack him; concluding, that if he had not been more afraid for the lady than for himself, he should not have now parted with his money so easily.\n\nAs wi•• is generally observed to love to reside in empty pockets, so the gentleman, whose ingenuity we have above remarked, as soon as he had parted with his money, began to grow wonderfully face|tious. He made frequent allusions to Adam and Eve, and said many excellent things on figs, and fig-leaves; which, perhaps, gave more offence to Joseph than to any other in the company.\n\nThe lawyer likewise made several very pretty jests, without departing from his profession, He said,\n\nIf Joseph and the lady were alone, he would be more capable of making a conveyance to her, as his affairs were not fettered with any incum|brance; he'd warrant, he soon suffered a recove|ry by a writ of entry, which was the proper way to create heirs in tail; that for his own part, he\n\ndescription Page 60\n\nwould engage to make so firm a settlement in a coach, that there should be no danger of an eject|ment;\n\nwith an inundation of the like gibberish, which he continued to vent till the coach arrived at an inn, where one servant-maid only was up in readiness to attend the coachman, and furnish him with cold meat and a dram. Joseph desired to alight, and that he might have a bed prepared for him, which the maid readily promised to perform; and being a good-natured wench, and not so sque|mish as the lady had been, she clapt a large faggot on the fire, and furnishing Joseph with a great coat belonging to one of the hostlers, desired him to sit down and warm himself, whilst she made his bed. The coachman, in the mean time, took an opportunity to call up a surgeon, who lived within a few doors: after which, he reminded his pas|sengers how late they were, and after they had ta|ken leave of Joseph, hurried them off as fast as he could.\n\nThe wench soon got Joseph to bed, and promised to use her interest to borrow him a shirt; but ima|gined, as she afterwards said, by his being so bloo|dy, that he must be a dead man: she ran with all speed to hasten the surgeon, who was more than half drest, apprehending that the coach had been overturned and some gentleman or lady hurt. As soon as the wench had informed him at his win|dow, that it was a poor foot-passenger who had been stript of all he had, and almost murdered; he chid her for disturbing him so early, slipped off his clothes again, and very quietly returned to bed and to sleep.\n\nAurora now began to show her blooming cheeks over the hills, whilst ten millions of feathered songsters, in jocund chorus, repeated, odes a thou|sand\n\ndescription Page 61\n\ntimes sweeter than those of our laureat, and sung both the day and the song; when the master of the inn, Mr. Tow-wouse, arose, and learning from his maid an account of the robbery, and the situation of his poor naked guest, he shook his head, and cried, good lack-a-day! and then ordered the girl to carry him one of his own shirts.\n\nMrs. Tow-wouse was just awake, and had stretch|ed out her arms in vain to fold her departed hus|band, when the maid entered the room.\n\nWho's there? Betty?\n\n'Yes, Madam.'\n\nWhere's your master?\n\nHe's without, Madam; he hath sent me for a shirt to lend a poor naked man, who hath been robbed and murdered.\n\nTouch one, if you dare, you slut,\n\nsaid Mrs. Tow-wouse;\n\nyour master is a pretty sort of a man to take in naked vagabonds, and clothe them with his own clothes. I shall have no such doings.—If you offer to touch any thing, I'll throw the chamber-pot at your head. Go, send your master to me,\n\n'Yes, Madam,' answered Betty. As soon as he came in, she thus began:\n\nWhat the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Tow-wouse? Am I to buy shirts to lend to a set of scabby rascals?\n\nMy dear, said Mr. Tow|wouse this is a poor wretch.\n\n'Yes' says she,\n\nI know, it is a poor wretch; but what the devil have we to do with poor wretches? the law makes us provide for too many already. We shall have thirty or forty poor wretches in red coats shortly.\n\n'My dear,' cries Tow-wouse, this man hath been robbed of all he hath' Well then,' says she,\n\nwhere's his money to pay his reckoning? Why doth not such a fellow go to an ale-house? I shall send him packing as soon as I am up, I assure you.\n\nMy dear said he, 'common charity won't suffer you to do that.'\n\ndescription Page 62\n\nCommon charitty, a f—t!' says she,\n\ncommon charity teaches us to provide for ourselves, and our families; and I and mine won't be ruined by your charity, I assure you.\n\n'Well,' says he,\n\nmy dear, do as you will when you are up; you know I never contradict you.\n\n'No,' says she,\n\nif the devil was to contradict me, I would make the house too hot to hold him.\n\nWith such like discourses they consumed near half an hour, whilst Betty provided a shirt from the hostler, who was one of her sweethearts, and put it on poor Joseph. The surgeon had likewise at last visited him, and washed and drest his wounds, and was now come to acquaint Mr. Tow-wouse, that his guest was in such extreme danger of his life, that he scarce saw any hopes of his recovery.—'Here's a pretty kettle of fish,' cries Mrs. Tow|wouse,\n\nyou have brought upon us! We are like to have a funeral at our own expence.\n\nTow|wouse, (who notwithstanding his charity, would have given his vote as freely as ever he did at an election, that any other house in the kingdom should have quiet possession of his guest) answered,\n\nMy dear, I am not to blame: he was brought hi|ther by the stage-coach; and Betty had put him to bed before I was stirring.\n\n'I'll Betty her,' says she—At which, with half her garments on, the other half under her arm, she sallied out in quest of the unfortunate Betty, whilst Tow-wouse and the surgeon went to pay a visit to poor Joseph, and enquire into the circumstances of this melancholy affair.\n\ndescription Page 63\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\nWhat happened to Joseph during his sickness at the inn, with the curious discourse between him and Mr. Barnabas the parson of the parish.\n\nAS soon as Joseph had communicated a parti|cular history of the robbery, together with a short account of himself and his intended journey, he asked the surgeon, if he apprehended him to be in any danger: To which the surgeon very honest|ly answered,\n\nHe feared he was; for that his pulse was very exalted and feverish, and if his fever should prove more than symptomatic, it would be impossible to save him.\n\nJoseph fetch|ing a deep sigh, cried,\n\nPoor Fanny, I would I could have lived to see thee! but God's will be done.\n\nThe surgeon then advised him, if he had any worldly affairs to settle, that he would do it as soon as possible; for tho' he hoped he might recover, yet he thought himself obliged to acquaint him he was in great danger; and if the malign concoction of his humours should cause a suscitation of his fe|ver, he might soon grow delirious and incapable to make his will. Joseph answered,\n\nThat it was impossible for any creature in the universe to be in a poorer condition than himself: for since the robbery, he had not one thing of any kind whatever, which he could call his own. I had, said he, a poor little piece of gold, which they took away, that would have been a comfort to me in all my afflictions; but surely, Fanny, I want nothing to remind me of thee. I have\n\ndescription Page 64\n\nthy dear image in my heart, and no villain can ever tear it thence.\n\nJoseph desired paper and pens to write a letter, but they were refused him; and he was advised to use all his endeavours to compose himself. They then left him; and Mr. Tow-wouse sent to a cler|gyman to come and administer his good offices to the soul of poor Joseph, since the surgeon despaired of making any successful applications to his body.\n\nMr. Barnabas (for that was the clergyman's name) came as soon as sent for; and having first drank a dish of tea with the landlady, and afterwards a bowl of punch with the landlord, he walked up to the room where Joseph lay; but finding him asleep, re|turned to take the other sna••er; which when he had finished, he again crept softly up to the cham|ber-door, and having opened it, heard the sick man talking to himself in the following manner:\n\nO most adorable Pamela! most virtuous sister! whose example could alone enable me to withstand all the temptations of riches and beauty, and to preserve my virtue pure and chaste, for the arms of my dear Fanny, if it had pleased heaven that I should ever have come unto them. What riches, or honours, or pleasures can make us amends for the loss of innocence? Doth not that alone afford us more consolation, than all worldly acquisitions? What but innocence and virtue could give any comfort to such a miserable wretch as I am? Yet these can make me prefer this sick and painful bed to all the pleasures I should have found in my la|dy's. These can make me face death without fear; and though I love my Fanny more than ever man loved a woman, these can teach me to resign my|self to the divine will without repining. O thou delightful charming creature! if heaven had in|dulged\n\ndescription Page 65\n\nthee to my arms, the poorest, humblest state, would have been a paradise; I could have lived with thee in the lowest cottage, without en|vying the palaces, the dainties, or the riches of any man breathing. But I must leave thee, leave thee for ever, my dearest angel! I must think of another world; and I heartily pray thou may'st meet com|fort in this.\n\n—Barnabas thought he had heard e|nough; so down stairs he went and told Tow-wouse he could do his guest no service; for that he was very light-headed, and had uttered nothing but a rhapsody of nonsense all the time he stayed in the room.\n\nThe surgeon returned in the afternoon, and found his patient in a higher fever, as he said, than when he left him, though not delirious; for not|withstanding Mr. Barnabas's opinion, he had not been once out of his senses since his arrival at the inn.\n\nMr. Barnabas was again sent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another visit. As soon as he entered the room, he told Joseph,\n\nHe was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: in the first place therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his sins.\n\nJoseph an|swered,\n\nHe hoped he had; but there was one thing which he knew not whether he should call a sin; if it was, he feared he should die in the commission of it; and that was the regret of parting with a young woman, whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart strings.\n\nBarnabas bad him be as|sured,\n\nthat any repining at the divine will was one of the greatest sins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal affections, and think of better things.\n\nJoseph said,\n\nThat neither in this world nor the next, he could forget his Fanny; and that\n\ndescription Page 66\n\nthe thought, however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half so tormenting, as the fear of what she should suffer, when she knew his misfor|tune.\n\nBarnabas said,\n\nThat such fears argued a diffidence and despondence very criminal; that he must divest himself of all human passions, and fix his heart above.\n\nJoseph answered,\n\nThat was what he desired to do.\n\nHe then questioned him concerning his forgiveness of the thieves.—Joseph, with a very heavy sigh, replied, He feared\n\nthat was more than he could do: for nothing would give him more pleasure than to hear they were taken.\n\n'That,' cries Barnabas,\n\nis for the sake of Justice.\n\n'Yes,' said Joseph,\n\nbut if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I should at|tack them, and kill them too, if I could.\n\n'Doubt|less answered Barnabas,\n\nit is lawful to kill a thief: but can you forgive them as a christian ought?\n\nJoseph desired to know what that forgive|ness was. 'That is,' answered Barnabas,\n\nto forgive them as—as—it is to forgive them as—in short it is to forgive them as a christian.\n\nJoseph replied, 'He forgave them as much as he could.' Well, well, said Barnabas, 'that will do.' He then demanded of him,\n\nif he remembered any more sins unrepented of; and if he did, he desired him to make haste and repent of them as fast as he could: that they might repeat over a few prayers together.\n\nJoseph answered,\n\nHe could not recol|lect any great crimes he had been guilty of, and that those he had committed he was sincerely sorry for.\n\nBarnabas said that was enough, and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was master of, some company then waiting for him be|low i•• the parlour, where the ingredients for punch were all in readiness; but no one would squeeze the oranges till he came.\n\ndescription Page 67\n\nJoseph complained he was dry, and desired a lit|tle tea; which Barnabas reported to Mrs. Tow|wouse, who answered,\n\nShe had just done drinking it, and could not bear to be slopping all day;\n\nbut ordered Betty to carry him up some small beer.\n\nBetty obeyed her mistress's commands; but Jo|seph, as soon as he tasted it, said, he feared it would increase his fever, and that he longed very much for tea: To which the good-natured Betty answered, he should have tea, if there was any in the land; she accordingly went and bought him some herself, and attended him with it: where we will leave her and Joseph together for some time, to entertain the reader with other matters.\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\nBeing very full of adventures, which succeeded each other at the inn.\n\nIT was now the dusk of the evening, when a grave person rode into the inn, and committing his horse to the hostler, went directly into the kitchen, and having called for a pipe of tobacco, took his place by the fire-side; where several persons were likewise assembled.\n\nThe discourse ran altogether on the robbery which was committed the night before, and on the poor wretch, who lay above in the dreadful conditi|on in which we have already seen him. Mrs. Tow|wouse said,\n\nShe wondered what the devil Tom Whipwell meant by bringing such guests to her house, when there were so many ale houses on the road proper for their reception. But she assured him, if he died, the parish should be at the expence of the funeral.\n\nShe added,\n\nNothing would serve the fellow's turn but tea, she would assure him.\n\nBetty, who was just returned from her charitable of|fice,\n\ndescription Page 68\n\nanswered, she believed he was a gentleman, for she never saw a finer skin in her life.\n\nPox on his skin!\n\nreplied Mrs. Tow-wouse,\n\nI suppose that is all we are like to have for the reckoning. I de|sire no such gentlemen should ever call at the Dra|gon,\n\n(which it seems was the sign of the inn.)\n\nThe gentleman lately arrived discovered a great deal of emotion at the distress of this poor creature, whom he observed to be fallen not into the most com|passionate hands. And indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no utterance to the sweetness of her tem|per, nature had taken such pains in her counte|nance, that Hogarth himself never gave more ex|pression to a picture.\n\nHer person was short, thin, and crooked. Her forehead projected in the middle, and thence de|scended in a declivity to the top of her nose, which was sharp and red, and would have hung over her lips, had not nature turned up one end of it. Her lips were two bits of skin, which, whenever she spoke, she drew together in a purse. Her chin was peaked; and at the upper end of that skin, which composed her cheeks, stood two bones, that almost hid a pair of small red eyes. Add to this a voice most wonderfully adapted to the sentiments it was to convey, being both loud and hoarse.\n\nIt is not easy to say, whether the gentleman had conceived a greater dislike for his landlady, or compassion for her unhappy guest. He enquir|ed very earnestly of the surgeon, who was now come into the kitchen, whether he had any hopes of his recovery? he begged him to use all possible means towards it, telling him,\n\nit was the duty of men of all professions, to apply their skill gratis for the relief of the poor and necessitous.\n\nThe surgeon answered,\n\nhe should take proper care;\n\ndescription Page 69\n\nbut he defied all the surgeons in London to do him any good.\n\n'Pray, Sir,' said the gentle|man, 'What are his wounds?—Why,\n\ndo you know any thing of wounds?\n\nsays the surgeon (winking upon Mrs. Tow-wouse)\n\nSir, I have a small smattering in surgery,\n\nanswered the gen|man. 'A smattering,—ho, ho, ho!' said the sur|geon, 'I believe it is a smattering indeed.\n\nThe company were all attentive, expecting to hear the doctor, who was what they call a dry fel|low, expose the gentleman.\n\nHe began therefore with an air of triumph:\n\nI suppose, Sir, you have travelled.\n\nNo really Sir,\n\nsaid the gentleman.\n\nHo! then you have practised in the hospitals perhaps.\n\n—'No, Sir,'\n\nHum! not that neither? Whence, Sir, then, if I may be so bold to enquire, have you got your knowledge in surgery?\n\n'Sir', answered the gen|man,\n\nI do not pretend to much; but the little I know, I have from books.\n\n'Book!' cries the doctor.—'What, I suppose you have read Galen and Hippocrates!' 'No, Sir, said the gentleman. 'How! you understand surgery,' answers the doc|tor, 'and not read Galen and Hippocrates' 'Sir,' cries the other,\n\nI believe there are many surgeons who have never read these authors.\n\nI believe so too,\n\nsays the doctor,\n\nmore shame for them: but thanks to my education I have them by heart, and very seldom go without them both in my pocket.\n\n'They are pretty large books, 'said the gentleman. 'Aye,' said the doctor,\n\nI believe I know how large they are better than you.\n\n(At which he fell a winking, and the whole compa|ny burst into a laugh.)\n\nThe doctor pursuing his triumph, asked the gentleman,\n\nif he did not understand physic as well\n\ndescription Page 70\n\nas surgery.\n\n'Rather better,' answered the gen|tleman. 'Aye, like enough,' cries the doctor, with a wink. 'Why, I know a little of physic too.' I wish I knew half so much,' said Tow-wouse, I'd never wear an apron again.'\n\nWhy I be|lieve, landlord,\n\ncries the doctor,\n\nthere are few men, though I say it, within twelve miles of the place, that handle a fever better.—Veniente ac|currite merbo: that is my method.—I suppose, brother, you understand Latin? A little,\n\nsays the gentleman.\n\nAye, and Greek now I'll warrant you: Ton dapomibo••inos polufloshoio Thalasses. But I have almost forgot these things, I could have repeated Homer by heart once.\n\n—\n\nIsags! the gentleman has caught a Traytor,\n\nsays Mrs. Tow-wouse; at which they all fell a laughing.\n\nThe gentleman, who had not the least affection for joking, very contentedly suffered the doctor to enjoy his victory; which he did with no small sa|tisfaction: and having sufficiently sounded his depth, told him,\n\nhe was thoroughly convinced of his great abilities; and that he would be obliged to him, if he would let him know his opinion of his patient's case above stairs.\n\n'Sir,' says the doctor,\n\nhis case is that of a dead man—The contusion on his head has perforated the in|ternal membrane of the occiput, and divelicated that radical small minute invisible nerve, which coheres to the pericranium; and this was an|tended with a fever at first symptomatic, then pneumatic; and he is at length grown deliriuus, or delirious as the vulgar express it.\n\nHe was proceeding in this learned manner, when a mighty noise interrupted him. Some young fel|lows in the neighbourhood had taken one of the thieves, and were bringing him into the inn. Bet|ty\n\ndescription Page 71\n\nran up stairs with this news to Joseph: who begged they might search for a little piece of bro|ken gold, which had a ribband tied to it, and which he could swear to amongst all the hoards of the richest men in the universe.\n\nNotwithstanding the fellow's persisting in his innocence, the mob were very busy in searching him, and presently, among other things, pulled out the piece of gold just mentioned; which Betty no sooner saw, than she laid violent hands on it, and conveyed it up to Joseph, who received it with rap|tures of joy, and hugging it in his bosom, declared, he could now die contented.\n\nWithin a few minutes afterwards, came in some other fellows, with a bundle which they had found in a ditch, and which was indeed the cloaths which had been stripped off from Joseph, and the other things they had taken from him.\n\nThe gentleman no sooner saw the coat, than he declared he knew the livery; and, if it had been taken from the poor creature above stairs, desired he might see him: for that he was very well ac|quainted with the family to whom that livery be|longed.\n\nHe was accordingly conducted up by Betty: but what, reader, was the surprize on both sides, when he saw Joseph was the person in bed; and when Joseph discovered the face of his good friend Mr. Abraham Adams!\n\nIt would be impertinent to insert a discourse which chiefly turned on the relation of matters al|ready well known to the reader: for as soon as the curate had satisfied Joseph concerning the perfect health of his Fanny, he was on his side very inqui|sitive into all the particulars which had produced this unfortunate accident.\n\ndescription Page 72\n\nTo return therefore to the kitchen, where a great variety of company were now assembled from all the rooms of the house, as well as the neighbourhood: so much delight do men take in contemplating the countenance of a thief.\n\nMr. Tow-wouse began to rub his hands with pleasure, at seeing so large an assembly; who would he hoped, shortly adjourn into several apartments, in order to discourse over the robbery, and drink a health to all honest men. But Mrs. Tow-wouse, whose misfortune it was commonly to see things a little perversely, began to rail at those who brought the fellow into her house; telling her husband,\n\nthey were very likely to thrive, who kept a house of entertainment for beggars and thieves.\n\nThe mob had now finished their search; and could find nothing about the captive likely to prove any evidence; for as to the cloaths, tho' the mob was very well satisfied with that proof; yet, as the surgeon observed, they could not convict him, be|cause they were not found in his custody; to which Barnabas agreed, and added, that these things were bona waviata, and belonged to the lord of the man|nor.\n\n'How,' says the surgeon,\n\ndo you say these goods belong to the lord of the manor?\n\n'I do,' cried Barnabas. 'Then I deny it,' says the surgeon.\n\nWhat can the lord of the manor have to do in the case? Will any one attempt to persuade me that what a man finds is not his own?\n\nI have heard (says an old fellow in the corner) justice Wiseone say, that if every man had his right, whatever is found belongs to the king of London.\n\nThat may be true,\n\nsays Barnabas,\n\nin some sense: for the law makes a difference between things stolen and things found: for a thing may be stolen that\n\ndescription Page 73\n\nnever is found; and a thing may be found that ne|ver was stolen. Now goods that are both stolen and found are waviata; and they belong to the lord of the manor.\n\nSo the lord of the manor is the re|ceiver of stolen goods,\n\n(says the doctor;) at which there was a universal laugh, being first begun by himself.\n\nWhile the prisoner, by persisting in his inno|cence, had almost (as there was no evidence against him) brought over Barnabas, the surgeon, Tow|wouse, and several others to his side; Betty inform|ed them, that they had over-looked a little piece of gold, which she had carried up to the man i"
