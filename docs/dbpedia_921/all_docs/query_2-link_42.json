        "text": "HAVING had such a smashing financial and critical success with his screen version of Henry Fielding's \"Tom Jones.\" Tony Richardson was, one suspects, a bit reluctant to make a film based on \"Joseph Andrews,\" Fielding's second greatest novel, a work that originated as Fielding's answer to what he saw as the hypocritical pieties of Samuel Richardson's \"Pamela.\"In the mid-18th century, \"Pamela\" enjoyed the kind of success that today is had only by the work of Victoria Holt and those other Gothic novelists who continue to sell the idea that virtue is its own reward, often accompanied by a large fortune.In \"Pamela,\" which was published in 1740, Richardson told the inspiring tale of Pamela Andrews, a serving girl who tenaciously held onto her virginity until her employer, the rich Mr. Booby, came across with a marriage license. Several years later, Mr. Fielding turned this story wildly upside down in a novel about Pamela's brother, Joseph, a serving boy who is as innocent as his sister but not nearly as calculating, who must fight off all sorts of lewd advances and whose triumph is one of true virtue rather than greed.Not wanting to appear to be repeating himself, Mr. Richardson waited nearly 15 years before turning to \"Joseph Andrews.\" The funny, stylish, infinitely cheerful film, which opens today at the Festival and other theaters, is well worth the wait. \"Joseph Andrews\" is not a sequel to \"Tom Jones\" in any literal sense, though it shares with that earlier movie its 18th-century period and its exuberant high spirits.In addition \"Joseph Andrews\" contains more great (and more greatly funny) character performances than any film I've seen in years. It's one of the few movies around now that truly lifts the spirits, not only because it is so good-humored but also because the humor is laced with so much wit and wisdom.Peter Firth, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in \"Equus,\" is marvelously earnest and innocent in the title role. He is the calm eye that is the center of a hurricane of extraordinary characters who tumble around him in all sorts of adventures involving mistaken identities, coincidental meetings on country lanes, stolen babies, lust, true love, gypsies, highwaymen, evil squires, urban corruption and rural pleasures.Foremost in this cast of characters is the single-mindedly lecherous Lady Booby, Joseph's employer, played by Ann-Margret at the top of her magnificent form, a lady who goes after the unsuspecting Joseph with something of the purpose of a warped missionary. She looks great and she is enchantingly funny, but so is almost everyone else in a cast so big I really don't know where to begin, since I'm sure to leave out someone important. It's one of those films in which even the smaller roles are as beautifully and as memorably done as the larger ones.There is, for example, John Gielgud's brief and hilarious appearance as the doctor who is called in at one point to minister to Joseph's wounds but who examines, instead, a corpse, taking some while to realize that the patient is, in fact, \"no more.\" There are also Beryl Reid as Mrs. Slipslop, Lady Booby's servant, a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver attempting to be dainty; the incomparable Michael Hordern as Parson Adams, the well-meaning clergyman who defends Joseph at all costs; Natalie Ogle, as Fanny, Joseph's virginal true love, and Karen Dotrice, who is most comic as the prissy and successful Pamela Andrews.There is in the entire film just one shot that I wish someone had cut out, but I won't describe it since it may go unnoticed by others. The film is otherwise an almost perfect blending of beauty, romance and adventure, of landscapes too lovely to believe alternating with the kind of gritty period detail that prompts one character to say of a street jam in the resort city of Batti, \"The only things that move here are the bowels of the horses.\"Mr. Richardson, as the director, and Allan Scott and Chris Bryant, who wrote the screenplay, based on Mr. Richardson's screen story, have captured the particular, very special charm of Mr. Fielding's narrative style, which never holds onto one adventure for a second too long. Thus Joseph's escapades open, one out of the other, with the effortlessness of a dream. Even the flashbacks, which we see through what seems to be a fish-eye lens, move the narrative forward at a breakneck pace that never falters.The movie year, which has not been great so far, looks a great deal richer today.\n\nMisadventures GaloreJOSEPH ANDREWS, directed by Tony Richardson;??? by ???
