If the irony is\n\ndepreciatory, posterity is but too likely to say, \"Many a true word is\n\nspoken in jest;\" if it is encomiastic, the same ruthless and ungrateful\n\ncritic is but too likely to take it as an involuntary confession of\n\nfolly and vanity. But when Fielding, in one of his serio-comic\n\nintroductions to _Tom Jones_, described it as \"this prodigious work,\" he\n\nall unintentionally (for he was the least pretentious of men)\n\nanticipated the verdict which posterity almost at once, and with\n\never-increasing suffrage of the best judges as time went on, was about\n\nto pass not merely upon this particular book, but upon his whole genius\n\nand his whole production as a novelist. His work in other kinds is of a\n\nvery different order of excellence. It is sufficiently interesting at\n\ntimes in itself; and always more than sufficiently interesting as his;\n\nfor which reasons, as well as for the further one that it is\n\ncomparatively little known, a considerable selection from it is offered\n\nto the reader in the last two volumes of this edition. Until the present\n\noccasion (which made it necessary that I should acquaint myself with\n\nit) I own that my own knowledge of these miscellaneous writings was by\n\nno means thorough. It is now pretty complete; but the idea which I\n\npreviously had of them at first and second hand, though a little\n\nimproved, has not very materially altered. Though in all this hack-work\n\nFielding displayed, partially and at intervals, the same qualities which\n\nhe displayed eminently and constantly in the four great books here\n\ngiven, he was not, as the French idiom expresses it, _dans son\n\nassiette_, in his own natural and impregnable disposition and situation\n\nof character and ability, when he was occupied on it. The novel was for\n\nhim that _assiette_; and all his novels are here.\n\nAlthough Henry Fielding lived in quite modern times, although by family\n\nand connections he was of a higher rank than most men of letters, and\n\nalthough his genius was at once recognised by his contemporaries so soon\n\nas it displayed itself in its proper sphere, his biography until very\n\nrecently was by no means full; and the most recent researches, including\n\nthose of Mr Austin Dobson--a critic unsurpassed for combination of\n\nliterary faculty and knowledge of the eighteenth century--have not\n\naltogether sufficed to fill up the gaps. His family, said to have\n\ndescended from a member of the great house of Hapsburg who came to\n\nEngland in the reign of Henry II., distinguished itself in the Wars of\n\nthe Roses, and in the seventeenth century was advanced to the peerages\n\nof Denbigh in England and (later) of Desmond in Ireland. The novelist\n\nwas the grandson of John Fielding, Canon of Salisbury, the fifth son of\n\nthe first Earl of Desmond of this creation. The canon's third son,\n\nEdmond, entered the army, served under Marlborough, and married Sarah\n\nGold or Gould, daughter of a judge of the King's Bench. Their eldest son\n\nwas Henry, who was born on April 22, 1707, and had an uncertain number\n\nof brothers and sisters of the whole blood. After his first wife's\n\ndeath, General Fielding (for he attained that rank) married again. The\n\nmost remarkable offspring of the first marriage, next to Henry, was his\n\nsister Sarah, also a novelist, who wrote David Simple; of the second,\n\nJohn, afterwards Sir John Fielding, who, though blind, succeeded his\n\nhalf-brother as a Bow Street magistrate, and in that office combined an\n\nequally honourable record with a longer tenure.\n\nFielding was born at Sharpham Park in Somersetshire, the seat of his\n\nmaternal grandfather; but most of his early youth was spent at East\n\nStour in Dorsetshire, to which his father removed after the judge's\n\ndeath. He is said to have received his first education under a parson of\n\nthe neighbourhood named Oliver, in whom a very uncomplimentary tradition\n\nsees the original of Parson Trulliber. He was then certainly sent to\n\nEton, where he did not waste his time as regards learning, and made\n\nseveral valuable friends. But the dates of his entering and leaving\n\nschool are alike unknown; and his subsequent sojourn at Leyden for two\n\nyears--though there is no reason to doubt it--depends even less upon\n\nany positive documentary evidence. This famous University still had a\n\ngreat repute as a training school in law, for which profession he was\n\nintended; but the reason why he did not receive the even then far more\n\nusual completion of a public school education by a sojourn at Oxford or\n\nCambridge may be suspected to be different. It may even have had\n\nsomething to do with a curious escapade of his about which not very much\n\nis known--an attempt to carry off a pretty heiress of Lyme, named\n\nSarah Andrew.\n\nEven at Leyden, however, General Fielding seems to have been unable or\n\nunwilling to pay his son's expenses, which must have been far less there\n\nthan at an English University; and Henry's return to London in 1728-29\n\nis said to have been due to sheer impecuniosity. When he returned to\n\nEngland, his father was good enough to make him an allowance of L200\n\nnominal, which appears to have been equivalent to L0 actual. And as\n\npractically nothing is known of him for the next six or seven years,\n\nexcept the fact of his having worked industriously enough at a large\n\nnumber of not very good plays of the lighter kind, with a few poems and\n\nmiscellanies, it is reasonably enough supposed that he lived by his pen.\n\nThe only product of this period which has kept (or indeed which ever\n\nreceived) competent applause is _Tom Thumb, or the Tragedy of\n\nTragedies_, a following of course of the _Rehearsal_, but full of humour\n\nand spirit. The most successful of his other dramatic works were the\n\n_Mock Doctor_ and the _Miser_, adaptations of Moliere's famous pieces.\n\nHis undoubted connection with the stage, and the fact of the\n\ncontemporary existence of a certain Timothy Fielding, helped suggestions\n\nof less dignified occupations as actor, booth-keeper, and so forth; but\n\nthese have long been discredited and indeed disproved.\n\nIn or about 1735, when Fielding was twenty-eight, we find him in a new,\n\na more brilliant and agreeable, but even a more transient phase. He had\n\nmarried (we do not know when or where) Miss Charlotte Cradock, one of\n\nthree sisters who lived at Salisbury (it is to be observed that\n\nFielding's entire connections, both in life and letters, are with the\n\nWestern Counties and London), who were certainly of competent means, and\n\nfor whose alleged illegitimacy there is no evidence but an unsupported\n\nfling of that old maid of genius, Richardson. The descriptions both of\n\nSophia and of Amelia are said to have been taken from this lady; her\n\ngood looks and her amiability are as well established as anything of the\n\nkind can be in the absence of photographs and affidavits; and it is\n\ncertain that her husband was passionately attached to her, during their\n\ntoo short married life. His method, however, of showing his affection\n\nsmacked in some ways too much of the foibles which he has attributed to\n\nCaptain Booth, and of those which we must suspect Mr Thomas Jones would\n\nalso have exhibited, if he had not been adopted as Mr Allworthy's heir,\n\nand had not had Mr Western's fortune to share and look forward to. It is\n\ntrue that grave breaches have been made by recent criticism in the very\n\npicturesque and circumstantial story told on the subject by Murphy, the\n\nfirst of Fielding's biographers. This legend was that Fielding, having\n\nsucceeded by the death of his mother to a small estate at East Stour,\n\nworth about L200 a year, and having received L1500 in ready money as his\n\nwife's fortune, got through the whole in three years by keeping open\n\nhouse, with a large retinue in \"costly yellow liveries,\" and so forth.\n\nIn details, this story has been simply riddled. His mother had died long\n\nbefore; he was certainly not away from London three years, or anything\n\nlike it; and so forth. At the same time, the best and soberest judges\n\nagree that there is an intrinsic probability, a consensus (if a vague\n\none) of tradition, and a chain of almost unmistakably personal\n\nreferences in the novels, which plead for a certain amount of truth, at\n\nthe bottom of a much embellished legend. At any rate, if Fielding\n\nestablished himself in the country, it was not long before he returned\n\nto town; for early in 1736 we find him back again, and not merely a\n\nplaywright, but lessee of the \"Little Theatre\" in the Haymarket. The\n\nplays which he produced here--satirico-political pieces, such as\n\n_Pasquin_ and the _Historical Register_--were popular enough, but\n\noffended the Government; and in 1737 a new bill regulating theatrical\n\nperformances, and instituting the Lord Chamberlain's control, was\n\npassed. This measure put an end directly to the \"Great Mogul's Company,\"\n\nas Fielding had called his troop, and indirectly to its manager's career\n\nas a playwright. He did indeed write a few pieces in future years, but\n\nthey were of the smallest importance.\n\nAfter this check he turned at last to a serious profession, entered\n\nhimself of the Middle Temple in November of the same year, and was\n\ncalled three years later; but during these years, and indeed for some\n\ntime afterwards, our information about him is still of the vaguest\n\ncharacter. Nobody doubts that he had a large share in the _Champion_, an\n\nessay-periodical on the usual eighteenth-century model, which began to\n\nappear in 1739, and which is still occasionally consulted for the work\n\nthat is certainly or probably his. He went the Western Circuit, and\n\nattended the Wiltshire Sessions, after he was called, giving up his\n\ncontributions to periodicals soon after that event. But he soon returned\n\nto literature proper, or rather made his _debut_ in it, with the\n\nimmortal book now republished. The _History of the Adventures of Joseph\n\nAndrews, and his Friend Mr Abraham Adams_, appeared in February 1742,\n\nand its author received from Andrew Millar, the publisher, the sum of\n\nL183, 11s. Even greater works have fetched much smaller sums; but it\n\nwill be admitted that _Joseph Andrews_ was not dear.\n\nThe advantage, however, of presenting a survey of an author's life\n\nuninterrupted by criticism is so clear, that what has to be said about\n\n_Joseph_ may be conveniently postponed for the moment. Immediately after\n\nits publication the author fell back upon miscellaneous writing, and in\n\nthe next year (1743) collected and issued three volumes of\n\n_Miscellanies_. In the two first volumes the only thing of much interest\n\nis the unfinished and unequal, but in part powerful, _Journey from this\n\nWorld to the Next_, an attempt of a kind which Fontenelle and others,\n\nfollowing Lucian, had made very popular with the time. But the third\n\nvolume of the _Miscellanies_ deserved a less modest and gregarious\n\nappearance, for it contained, and is wholly occupied by, the wonderful\n\nand terrible satire of _Jonathan Wild_, the greatest piece of pure irony\n\nin English out of Swift. Soon after the publication of the book, a great\n\ncalamity came on Fielding. His wife had been very ill when he wrote the\n\npreface; soon afterwards she was dead. They had taken the chance, had\n\nmade the choice, that the more prudent and less wise student-hero and\n\nheroine of Mr Browning's _Youth and Art_ had shunned; they had no doubt\n\n\"sighed deep, laughed free, Starved, feasted, despaired,\" and we need\n\nnot question, that they had also \"been happy.\"\n\nExcept this sad event and its rather incongruous sequel, Fielding's\n\nmarriage to his wife's maid Mary Daniel--a marriage, however, which did\n\nnot take place till full four years later, and which by all accounts\n\nsupplied him with a faithful and excellent companion and nurse, and his\n\nchildren with a kind stepmother--little or nothing is again known of\n\nthis elusive man of genius between the publication of the _Miscellanies_\n\nin 1743, and that of _Tom Jones_ in 1749. The second marriage itself in\n\nNovember 1747; an interview which Joseph Warton had with him rather more\n\nthan a year earlier (one of the very few direct interviews we have); the\n\npublication of two anti-Jacobite newspapers (Fielding was always a\n\nstrong Whig and Hanoverian), called the _True Patriot_ and the\n\n_Jacobite's Journal_ in 1745 and the following years; some indistinct\n\ntraditions about residences at Twickenham and elsewhere, and some, more\n\nprecise but not much more authenticated, respecting patronage by the\n\nDuke of Bedford, Mr Lyttelton, Mr Allen, and others, pretty well sum up\n\nthe whole.\n\n_Tom Jones_ was published in February (a favourite month with Fielding\n\nor his publisher Millar) 1749; and as it brought him the, for those\n\ndays, very considerable sum of L600 to which Millar added another\n\nhundred later, the novelist must have been, for a time at any rate,\n\nrelieved from his chronic penury. But he had already, by Lyttelton's\n\ninterest, secured his first and last piece of preferment, being made\n\nJustice of the Peace for Westminster, an office on which he entered with\n\ncharacteristic vigour. He was qualified for it not merely by a solid\n\nknowledge of the law, and by great natural abilities, but by his\n\nthorough kindness of heart; and, perhaps, it may also be added, by his\n\nlong years of queer experience on (as Mr Carlyle would have said) the\n\n\"burning marl\" of the London Bohemia. Very shortly afterwards he was\n\nchosen Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and established himself in Bow\n\nStreet. The Bow Street magistrate of that time occupied a most singular\n\nposition, and was more like a French Prefect of Police or even a\n\nMinister of Public Safety than a mere justice. Yet he was ill paid.\n\nFielding says that the emoluments, which before his accession had but\n\nbeen L500 a year of \"dirty\" money, were by his own action but L300 of\n\nclean; and the work, if properly performed, was very severe.\n\nThat he performed it properly all competent evidence shows, a foolish,\n\ninconclusive, and I fear it must be said emphatically snobbish story of\n\nWalpole's notwithstanding. In particular, he broke up a gang of\n\ncut-throat thieves, which had been the terror of London. But his tenure\n\nof the post was short enough, and scarcely extended to five years. His\n\nhealth had long been broken, and he was now constantly attacked by gout,\n\nso that he had frequently to retreat on Bath from Bow Street, or his\n\nsuburban cottage of Fordhook, Ealing. But he did not relax his literary\n\nwork. His pen was active with pamphlets concerning his office; _Amelia_,\n\nhis last novel, appeared towards the close of 1751; and next year saw\n\nthe beginning of a new paper, the _Covent Garden Journal_, which\n\nappeared twice a week, ran for the greater part of the year, and died in\n\nNovember. Its great author did not see that month twice again. In the\n\nspring of 1753 he grew worse; and after a year's struggle with ill\n\nhealth, hard work, and hard weather, lesser measures being pronounced\n\nuseless, was persuaded to try the \"Portugal Voyage,\" of which he has\n\nleft so charming a record in the _Journey to Lisbon_. He left Fordhook\n\non June 26, 1754, reached Lisbon in August, and, dying there on the 8th\n\nof October, was buried in the cemetery of the Estrella.\n\nOf not many writers perhaps does a clearer notion, as far as their\n\npersonality goes, exist in the general mind that interests itself at all\n\nin literature than of Fielding. Yet more than once a warning has been\n\nsounded, especially by his best and most recent biographer, to the\n\neffect that this idea is founded upon very little warranty of scripture.\n\nThe truth is, that as the foregoing record--which, brief as it is, is a\n\nsufficiently faithful summary--will have shown, we know very little\n\nabout Fielding. We have hardly any letters of his, and so lack the best\n\nby far and the most revealing of all character-portraits; we have but\n\none important autobiographic fragment, and though that is of the highest\n\ninterest and value, it was written far in the valley of the shadow of\n\ndeath, it is not in the least retrospective, and it affords but dim and\n\ninferential light on his younger, healthier, and happier days and ways.\n\nHe came, moreover, just short of one set of men of letters, of whom we\n\nhave a great deal of personal knowledge, and just beyond another. He was\n\nneither of those about Addison, nor of those about Johnson. No intimate\n\nfriend of his has left us anything elaborate about him. On the other\n\nhand, we have a far from inconsiderable body of documentary evidence, of\n\na kind often by no means trustworthy. The best part of it is contained\n\nin the letters of his cousin, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and the\n\nreminiscences or family traditions of her grand-daughter, Lady Louisa\n\nStuart. But Lady Mary, vivacious and agreeable as she is, had with all\n\nher talent a very considerable knack of writing for effect, of drawing\n\nstrong contrasts and the like; and it is not quite certain that she saw\n\nvery much of Fielding in the last and most interesting third of his\n\nlife. Another witness, Horace Walpole, to less knowledge and equally\n\ndubious accuracy, added decided ill-will, which may have been due partly\n\nto the shrinking of a dilettante and a fop from a burly Bohemian; but I\n\nfear is also consequent upon the fact that Horace could not afford to\n\ndespise Fielding's birth, and knew him to be vastly his own superior in\n\ngenius. We hear something of him again from Richardson; and Richardson\n\nhated him with the hatred of dissimilar genius, of inferior social\n\nposition, and, lastly, of the cat for the dog who touzles and worries\n\nher. Johnson partly inherited or shared Richardson's aversion, partly\n\nwas blinded to Fielding's genius by his aggressive Whiggery. I fear,\n\ntoo, that he was incapable of appreciating it for reasons other than\n\npolitical. It is certain that Johnson, sane and robust as he was, was\n\nnever quite at ease before genius of the gigantic kind, either in dead\n\nor living. Whether he did not like to have to look up too much, or was\n\nactually unable to do so, it is certain that Shakespeare, Milton,\n\nSwift, and Fielding, those four Atlantes of English verse and prose, all\n\naffected him with lukewarm admiration, or with positive dislike, for\n\nwhich it is vain to attempt to assign any uniform secondary cause,\n\npolitical or other. It may be permitted to hint another reason. All\n\nJohnson's most sharp-sighted critics have noticed, though most have\n\ndiscreetly refrained from insisting on, his \"thorn-in-the-flesh,\" the\n\ncombination in him of very strong physical passions with the deepest\n\nsense of the moral and religious duty of abstinence. It is perhaps\n\nimpossible to imagine anything more distasteful to a man so buffeted,\n\nthan the extreme indulgence with which Fielding regards, and the easy\n\nfreedom, not to say gusto, with which he depicts, those who succumb to\n\nsimilar temptation. Only by supposing the workings of some subtle\n\ninfluence of this kind is it possible to explain, even in so capricious\n\na humour as Johnson's, the famous and absurd application of the term\n\n\"barren rascal\" to a writer who, dying almost young, after having for\n\nmany years lived a life of pleasure, and then for four or five one of\n\nlaborious official duty, has left work anything but small in actual\n\nbulk, and fertile with the most luxuriant growth of intellectual\n\noriginality.\n\nPartly on the _obiter dicta_ of persons like these, partly on the still\n\nmore tempting and still more treacherous ground of indications drawn\n\nfrom his works, a Fielding of fantasy has been constructed, which in\n\nThackeray's admirable sketch attains real life and immortality as a\n\ncreature of art, but which possesses rather dubious claims as a\n\nhistorical character. It is astonishing how this Fielding of fantasy\n\nsinks and shrivels when we begin to apply the horrid tests of criticism\n\nto his component parts. The _eidolon_, with inked ruffles and a towel\n\nround his head, sits in the Temple and dashes off articles for the\n\n_Covent Garden Journal_; then comes Criticism, hellish maid, and reminds\n\nus that when the _Covent Garden Journal_ appeared, Fielding's wild oats,\n\nif ever sown at all, had been sown long ago; that he was a busy\n\nmagistrate and householder in Bow Street; and that, if he had towels\n\nround his head, it was probably less because he had exceeded in liquor\n\nthan because his Grace of Newcastle had given him a headache by wanting\n\nelaborate plans and schemes prepared at an hour's notice. Lady Mary,\n\napparently with some envy, tells us that he could \"feel rapture with his\n\ncook-maid.\" \"Which many has,\" as Mr Ridley remarks, from Xanthias\n\nPhoceus downwards; but when we remember the historic fact that he\n\nmarried this maid (not a \"cook-maid\" at all), and that though he always\n\nspeaks of her with warm affection and hearty respect, such \"raptures\" as\n\nwe have of his clearly refer to a very different woman, who was both a\n\nlady and a beautiful one, we begin a little to shake our heads. Horace\n\nWalpole at second-hand draws us a Fielding, pigging with low companions\n\nin a house kept like a hedge tavern; Fielding himself, within a year or\n\ntwo, shows us more than half-undesignedly in the _Voyage to Lisbon_ that\n\nhe was very careful about the appointments and decency of his table,\n\nthat he stood rather upon ceremony in regard to his own treatment of his\n\nfamily, and the treatment of them and himself by others, and that he was\n\naltogether a person orderly, correct, and even a little finikin. Nor is\n\nthere the slightest reasonable reason to regard this as a piece of\n\nhypocrisy, a vice as alien from the Fielding of fancy as from the\n\nFielding of fact, and one the particular manifestation of which, in this\n\nparticular place, would have been equally unlikely and unintelligible.\n\nIt may be asked whether I propose to substitute for the traditional\n\nFielding a quite different person, of regular habits and methodical\n\neconomy. Certainly not. The traditional estimate of great men is rarely\n\nwrong altogether, but it constantly has a habit of exaggerating and\n\ndramatising their characteristics. For some things in Fielding's career\n\nwe have positive evidence of document, and evidence hardly less certain\n\nof probability. Although I believe the best judges are now of opinion\n\nthat his impecuniosity has been overcharged, he certainly had\n\nexperiences which did not often fall to the lot of even a cadet of good\n\nfamily in the eighteenth century. There can be no reasonable doubt that\n\nhe was a man who had a leaning towards pretty girls and bottles of good\n\nwine; and I should suppose that if the girl were kind and fairly\n\nwinsome, he would not have insisted that she should possess Helen's\n\nbeauty, that if the bottle of good wine were not forthcoming, he would\n\nhave been very tolerant of a mug of good ale. He may very possibly have\n\ndrunk more than he should, and lost more than he could conveniently pay.\n\nIt may be put down as morally ascertained that towards all these\n\nweaknesses of humanity, and others like unto them, he held an attitude\n\nwhich was less that of the unassailable philosopher than that of the\n\nsympathiser, indulgent and excusing. In regard more especially to what\n\nare commonly called moral delinquencies, this attitude was so decided\n\nas to shock some people even in those days, and many in these. Just when\n\nthe first sheets of this edition were passing through the press, a\n\nviolent attack was made in a newspaper correspondence on the morality of\n\n_Tom Jones_ by certain notorious advocates of Purity, as some say, of\n\nPruriency and Prudery combined, according to less complimentary\n\nestimates. Even midway between the two periods we find the admirable\n\nMiss Ferrier, a sister of Fielding's own craft, who sometimes had\n\ntouches of nature and satire not far inferior to his own, expressing by\n\nthe mouth of one of her characters with whom she seems partly to agree,\n\nthe sentiment that his works are \"vanishing like noxious exhalations.\"\n\nTowards any misdoing by persons of the one sex towards persons of the\n\nother, when it involved brutality or treachery, Fielding was pitiless;\n\nbut when treachery and brutality were not concerned, he was, to say the\n\nleast, facile. So, too, he probably knew by experience--he certainly\n\nknew by native shrewdness and acquired observation--that to look too\n\nmuch on the wine when it is red, or on the cards when they are\n\nparti-coloured, is ruinous to health and fortune; but he thought not\n\nover badly of any man who did these things. Still it is possible to\n\nadmit this in him, and to stop short of that idea of a careless and\n\nreckless _viveur_ which has so often been put forward. In particular,\n\nLady Mary's view of his childlike enjoyment of the moment has been, I\n\nthink, much exaggerated by posterity, and was probably not a little\n\nmistaken by the lady herself. There are two moods in which the motto is\n\n_Carpe diem_, one a mood of simply childish hurry, the other one where\n\nbehind the enjoyment of the moment lurks, and in which the enjoyment of\n\nthe moment is not a little heightened by, that vast ironic consciousness\n\nof the before and after, which I at least see everywhere in the\n\nbackground of Fielding's work.\n\nThe man, however, of whom we know so little, concerns us much less than\n\nthe author of the works, of which it only rests with ourselves to know\n\neverything. I have above classed Fielding as one of the four Atlantes of\n\nEnglish verse and prose, and I doubt not that both the phrase and the\n\napplication of it to him will meet with question and demur. I have only\n\nto interject, as the critic so often has to interject, a request to the\n\ncourt to take what I say in the sense in which I say it. I do not mean\n\nthat Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, and Fielding are in all or even in most\n\nrespects on a level. I do not mean that the three last are in all\n\nrespects of the greatest names in English literature. I only mean that,\n\nin a certain quality, which for want of a better word I have chosen to\n\ncall Atlantean, they stand alone. Each of them, for the metaphor is\n\napplicable either way, carries a whole world on his shoulders, or looks\n\ndown on a whole world from his natural altitude. The worlds are\n\ndifferent, but they are worlds; and though the attitude of the giants is\n\ndifferent also, it agrees in all of them on the points of competence and\n\nstrength. Take whomsoever else we may among our men of letters, and we\n\nshall find this characteristic to be in comparison wanting. These four\n\ncarry their world, and are not carried by it; and if it, in the language\n\nso dear to Fielding himself, were to crash and shatter, the inquiry,\n\n\"_Que vous reste-t-il?_\" could be answered by each, \"_Moi!_\"\n\nThe appearance which Fielding makes is no doubt the most modest of the\n\nfour. He has not Shakespeare's absolute universality, and in fact not\n\nmerely the poet's tongue, but the poet's thought seems to have been\n\ndenied him. His sphere is not the ideal like Milton's. His irony,\n\nsplendid as it is, falls a little short of that diabolical magnificence\n\nwhich exalts Swift to the point whence, in his own way, he surveys all\n\nthe kingdoms of the world, and the glory or vainglory of them. All\n\nFielding's critics have noted the manner, in a certain sense modest, in\n\nanother ostentatious, in which he seems to confine himself to the\n\npresentation of things English. They might have added to the\n\npresentation of things English--as they appear in London, and on the\n\nWestern Circuit, and on the Bath Road.\n\nBut this apparent parochialism has never deceived good judges. It did\n\nnot deceive Lady Mary, who had seen the men and manners of very many\n\nclimes; it did not deceive Gibbon, who was not especially prone to\n\novervalue things English, and who could look down from twenty centuries\n\non things ephemeral. It deceives, indeed, I am told, some excellent\n\npersons at the present day, who think Fielding's microcosm a \"toylike\n\nworld,\" and imagine that Russian Nihilists and French Naturalists have\n\ngone beyond it. It will deceive no one who has lived for some competent\n\nspace of time a life during which he has tried to regard his\n\nfellow-creatures and himself, as nearly as a mortal may, _sub specie\n\naeternitatis_.\n\nAs this is in the main an introduction to a complete reprint of\n\nFielding's four great novels, the justification in detail of the\n\nestimate just made or hinted of the novelist's genius will be best and\n\nmost fitly made by a brief successive discussion of the four as they are\n\nhere presented, with some subsequent remarks on the _Miscellanies_ here\n\nselected. And, indeed, it is not fanciful to perceive in each book a\n\nsomewhat different presentment of the author's genius; though in no one\n\nof the four is any one of his masterly qualities absent. There is\n\ntenderness even in _Jonathan Wild_; there are touches in _Joseph\n\nAndrews_ of that irony of the Preacher, the last echo of which is heard\n\namid the kindly resignation of the _Journey to Lisbon_, in the sentence,\n\n\"Whereas envy of all things most exposes us to danger from others, so\n\ncontempt of all things best secures us from them.\" But on the whole it\n\nis safe to say that _Joseph Andrews_ best presents Fielding's\n\nmischievous and playful wit; _Jonathan Wild_ his half-Lucianic\n\nhalf-Swiftian irony; _Tom Jones_ his unerring knowledge of human nature,\n\nand his constructive faculty; _Amelia_ his tenderness, his _mitis\n\nsapientia_, his observation of the details of life. And first of\n\nthe first.\n\n_The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his friend Mr\n\nAbraham Adams_ was, as has been said above, published in February 1742.\n\nA facsimile of the agreement between author and publisher will be given\n\nin the second volume of this series; and it is not uninteresting to\n\nobserve that the witness, William Young, is none other than the asserted\n\noriginal of the immortal Mr Adams himself. He might, on Balzac's plea in\n\na tolerably well-known anecdote, have demanded half of the L183, 11s. Of\n\nthe other origins of the book we have a pretty full account, partly\n\ndocumentary. That it is \"writ in the manner of Cervantes,\" and is\n\nintended as a kind of comic epic, is the author's own statement--no\n\ndoubt as near the actual truth as is consistent with comic-epic theory.\n\nThat there are resemblances to Scarron, to Le Sage, and to other\n\npractitioners of the Picaresque novel is certain; and it was inevitable\n\nthat there should be. Of directer and more immediate models or\n\nstarting-points one is undoubted; the other, though less generally\n\nadmitted, not much less indubitable to my mind. The parody of\n\nRichardson's _Pamela_, which was little more than a year earlier (Nov.\n\n1740), is avowed, open, flagrant; nor do I think that the author was so\n\nsoon carried away by the greater and larger tide of his own invention as\n\nsome critics seem to hold. He is always more or less returning to the\n\nironic charge; and the multiplicity of the assailants of Joseph's virtue\n\nonly disguises the resemblance to the long-drawn dangers of Pamela from\n\na single ravisher. But Fielding was also well acquainted with Marivaux's\n\n_Paysan Parvenu_, and the resemblances between that book and _Joseph\n\nAndrews_ are much stronger than Fielding's admirers have always been\n\nwilling to admit. This recalcitrance has, I think, been mainly due to\n\nthe erroneous conception of Marivaux as, if not a mere fribble, yet a\n\nDresden-Shepherdess kind of writer, good at \"preciousness\" and\n\npatch-and-powder manners, but nothing more.\n\nThere was, in fact, a very strong satiric and ironic touch in the author\n\nof _Marianne_, and I do not think that I was too rash when some years\n\nago I ventured to speak of him as \"playing Fielding to his own\n\nRichardson\" in the _Paysan Parvenu_.\n\nOrigins, however, and indebtedness and the like, are, when great work is\n\nconcerned, questions for the study and the lecture-room, for the\n\nliterary historian and the professional critic, rather than for the\n\nreader, however intelligent and alert, who wishes to enjoy a\n\nmasterpiece, and is content simply to enjoy it. It does not really\n\nmatter how close to anything else something which possesses independent\n\ngoodness is; the very utmost technical originality, the most spotless\n\npurity from the faintest taint of suggestion, will not suffice to confer\n\nmerit on what does not otherwise possess it. Whether, as I rather think,\n\nFielding pursued the plan he had formed _ab incepto_, or whether he\n\ncavalierly neglected it, or whether the current of his own genius\n\ncarried him off his legs and landed him, half against his will, on the\n\nshore of originality, are questions for the Schools, and, as I venture\n\nto think, not for the higher forms in them. We have _Joseph Andrews_ as\n\nit is; and we may be abundantly thankful for it. The contents of it, as\n\nof all Fielding's work in this kind, include certain things for which\n\nthe moderns are scantly grateful. Of late years, and not of late years\n\nonly, there has grown up a singular and perhaps an ignorant impatience\n\nof digressions, of episodes, of tales within a tale. The example of this\n\nwhich has been most maltreated is the \"Man of the Hill\" episode in _Tom\n\nJones_; but the stories of the \"Unfortunate Jilt\" and of Mr Wilson in\n\nour present subject, do not appear to me to be much less obnoxious to\n\nthe censure; and _Amelia_ contains more than one or two things of the\n\nsame kind. Me they do not greatly disturb; and I see many defences for\n\nthem besides the obvious, and at a pinch sufficient one, that\n\ndivagations of this kind existed in all Fielding's Spanish and French\n\nmodels, that the public of the day expected them, and so forth. This\n\ndefence is enough, but it is easy to amplify and reintrench it. It is\n\nnot by any means the fact that the Picaresque novel of adventure is the\n\nonly or the chief form of fiction which prescribes or admits these\n\nepisodic excursions. All the classical epics have them; many eastern and\n\nother stories present them; they are common, if not invariable, in the\n\nabundant mediaeval literature of prose and verse romance; they are not\n\nunknown by any means in the modern novel; and you will very rarely hear\n\na story told orally at the dinner-table or in the smoking-room without\n\nsomething of the kind. There must, therefore, be something in them\n\ncorresponding to an inseparable accident of that most unchanging of all\n\nthings, human nature. And I do not think the special form with which we\n\nare here concerned by any means the worst that they have taken. It has\n\nthe grand and prominent virtue of being at once and easily skippable.\n\nThere is about Cervantes and Le Sage, about Fielding and Smollett, none\n\nof the treachery of the modern novelist, who induces the conscientious\n\nreader to drag through pages, chapters, and sometimes volumes which have\n\nnothing to do with the action, for fear he should miss something that\n\nhas to do with it. These great men have a fearless frankness, and almost\n\ntell you in so many words when and what you may skip. Therefore, if the\n\n\"Curious Impertinent,\" and the \"Baneful Marriage,\" and the \"Man of the\n\nHill,\" and the \"Lady of Quality,\" get in the way, when you desire to\n\n\"read for the story,\" you have nothing to do but turn the page till\n\n_finis_ comes. The defence has already been made by an illustrious hand\n\nfor Fielding's inter-chapters and exordiums. It appears to me to be\n\nalmost more applicable to his insertions.\n\nAnd so we need not trouble ourselves any more either about the\n\ninsertions or about the exordiums. They both please me; the second class\n\nhas pleased persons much better worth pleasing than I can pretend to be;\n\nbut the making or marring of the book lies elsewhere. I do not think\n\nthat it lies in the construction, though Fielding's following of the\n\nancients, both sincere and satiric, has imposed a false air of\n\nregularity upon that. The Odyssey of Joseph, of Fanny, and of their\n\nghostly mentor and bodily guard is, in truth, a little haphazard, and\n\nmight have been longer or shorter without any discreet man approving it\n\nthe more or the less therefor. The real merits lie partly in the\n\nabounding humour and satire of the artist's criticism, but even more in\n\nthe marvellous vivacity and fertility of his creation. For the very\n\nfirst time in English prose fiction every character is alive, every\n\nincident is capable of having happened. There are lively touches in the\n\nElizabethan romances; but they are buried in verbiage, swathed in stage\n\ncostume, choked and fettered by their authors' want of art. The quality\n\nof Bunyan's knowledge of men was not much inferior to Shakespeare's, or\n\nat least to Fielding's; but the range and the results of it were cramped\n\nby his single theological purpose, and his unvaried allegoric or typical\n\nform. Why Defoe did not discover the New World of Fiction, I at least\n\nhave never been able to put into any brief critical formula that\n\nsatisfies me, and I have never seen it put by any one else. He had not\n\nonly seen it afar off, he had made landings and descents on it; he had\n\ncarried off and exhibited in triumph natives such as Robinson Crusoe,\n\nas Man Friday, as Moll Flanders, as William the Quaker; but he had\n\nconquered, subdued, and settled no province therein. I like _Pamela_; I\n\nlike it better than some persons who admire Richardson on the whole more\n\nthan I do, seem to like it. But, as in all its author's work, the\n\nhandling seems to me academic--the working out on paper of an\n\ningeniously conceived problem rather than the observation or evolution\n\nof actual or possible life. I should not greatly fear to push the\n\ncomparison even into foreign countries; but it is well to observe\n\nlimits. Let us be content with holding that in England at least, without\n\nprejudice to anything further, Fielding was the first to display the\n\nqualities of the perfect novelist as distinguished from the romancer.\n\nWhat are those qualities, as shown in _Joseph Andrews_? The faculty of\n\narranging a probable and interesting course of action is one, of course,\n\nand Fielding showed it here. But I do not think that it is at any time\n\nthe greatest one; and nobody denies that he made great advances in this\n\ndirection later. The faculty of lively dialogue is another; and that he\n\nhas not often been refused; but much the same may be said of it. The\n\ninterspersing of appropriate description is another; but here also we\n\nshall not find him exactly a paragon. It is in character--the chief\n\n_differentia_ of the novel as distinguished not merely from its elder\n\nsister the romance, and its cousin the drama, but still more from every\n\nother kind of literature--that Fielding stands even here pre-eminent. No\n\none that I can think of, except his greatest successor in the present\n\ncentury, has the same unfailing gift of breathing life into every\n\ncharacter he creates or borrows; and even Thackeray draws, if I may use\n\nthe phrase, his characters more in the flat and less in the round than\n\nFielding. Whether in Blifil he once failed, we must discuss hereafter;\n\nhe has failed nowhere in _Joseph Andrews_. Some of his sketches may\n\nrequire the caution that they are eighteenth-century men and women; some\n\nthe warning that they are obviously caricatured, or set in designed\n\nprofile, or merely sketched. But they are all alive. The finical\n\nestimate of Gray (it is a horrid joy to think how perfectly capable\n\nFielding was of having joined in that practical joke of the young\n\ngentlemen of Cambridge, which made Gray change his college), while\n\ndismissing these light things with patronage, had to admit that \"parson\n\nAdams is perfectly well, so is Mrs Slipslop.\" \"They _were_, Mr\n\nGray,\" said some one once, \"they were more perfectly well, and in a\n\nhigher kind, than anything you ever did; though you were a pretty\n\nworkman too.\"\n\nYes, parson Adams is perfectly well, and so is Mrs Slipslop. But so are\n\nthey all. Even the hero and heroine, tied and bound as they are by the\n\nnecessity under which their maker lay of preserving Joseph's\n\nJoseph-hood, and of making Fanny the example of a franker and less\n\ninterested virtue than her sister-in-law that might have been, are\n\nsurprisingly human where most writers would have made them sticks. And\n\nthe rest require no allowance. Lady Booby, few as are the strokes given\n\nto her, is not much less alive than Lady Bellaston. Mr Trulliber,\n\nmonster and not at all delicate monster as he is, is also a man, and\n\nwhen he lays it down that no one even in his own house shall drink when\n\nhe \"caaled vurst,\" one can but pay his maker the tribute of that silent\n\nshudder of admiration which hails the addition of one more everlasting\n\nentity to the world of thought and fancy. And Mr Tow-wouse is real, and\n\nMrs Tow-wouse is more real still, and Betty is real; and the coachman,\n\nand Miss Grave-airs, and all the wonderful crew from first to last. The\n\ndresses they wear, the manners they exhibit, the laws they live under,\n\nthe very foods and drinks they live upon, are \"past like the shadows on\n\nglasses\"--to the comfort and rejoicing of some, to the greater or less\n\nsorrow of others. But _they_ are there--alive, full of blood, full of\n\nbreath as we are, and, in truth, I fear a little more so. For some\n\npurposes a century is a gap harder to cross and more estranging than a\n\ncouple of millenniums. But in their case the gap is nothing; and it is\n\nnot too much to say that as they have stood the harder test, they will\n\nstand the easier. There are very striking differences between Nausicaa\n\nand Mrs Slipslop; there are differences not less striking between Mrs\n\nSlipslop and Beatrice. But their likeness is a stranger and more\n\nwonderful thing than any of their unlikenesses. It is that they are\n\nall women, that they are all live citizenesses of the Land of Matters\n\nUnforgot, the fashion whereof passeth not away, and the franchise\n\nwhereof, once acquired, assures immortality.\n\nNOTE TO GENERAL INTRODUCTION.\n\n_The text of this issue in the main follows that of the standard or\n\nfirst collected edition of 1762. The variants which the author\n\nintroduced in successive editions during his lifetime are not\n\ninconsiderable; but for the purposes of the present issue it did not\n\nseem necessary or indeed desirable to take account of them. In the case\n\nof prose fiction, more than in any other department of literature, it is\n\ndesirable that work should be read in the form which represents the\n\ncompletest intention and execution of the author. Nor have any notes\n\nbeen attempted; for again such things, in the case of prose fiction, are\n\nof very doubtful use, and supply pretty certain stumbling-blocks to\n\nenjoyment; while in the particular case of Fielding, the annotation,\n\nunless extremely capricious, would have to be disgustingly full. Far be\n\nit at any rate from the present editor to bury these delightful\n\ncreations under an ugly crust of parallel passages and miscellaneous\n\nerudition. The sheets, however, have been carefully read in order to\n\nprevent the casual errors which are wont to creep into frequently\n\nreprinted texts; and the editor hopes that if any such have escaped him,\n\nthe escape will not be attributed to wilful negligence. A few obvious\n\nerrors, in spelling of proper names, &c., which occur in the 1762\n\nversion have been corrected: but wherever the readings of that version\n\nare possible they have been preferred. The embellishments of the edition\n\nare partly fanciful and partly \"documentary;\" so that it is hoped both\n\nclasses of taste may have something to feed upon._\n\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\n\nAs it is possible the mere English reader may have a different idea of\n\nromance from the author of these little[A] volumes, and may consequently\n\nexpect a kind of entertainment not to be found, nor which was even\n\nintended, in the following pages, it may not be improper to premise a\n\nfew words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to\n\nhave seen hitherto attempted in our language.\n\n[A] _Joseph Andrews_ was originally published in 2 vols. duodecimo.\n\nThe EPIC, as well as the DRAMA, is divided into tragedy and comedy.\n\nHOMER, who was the father of this species of poetry, gave us a pattern\n\nof both these, though that of the latter kind is entirely lost; which\n\nAristotle tells us, bore the same relation to comedy which his Iliad\n\nbears to tragedy. And perhaps, that we have no more instances of it\n\namong the writers of antiquity, is owing to the loss of this great\n\npattern, which, had it survived, would have found its imitators equally\n\nwith the other poems of this great original.\n\nAnd farther, as this poetry may be tragic or comic, I will not scruple\n\nto say it may be likewise either in verse or prose: for though it wants\n\none particular, which the critic enumerates in the constituent parts of\n\nan epic poem, namely metre; yet, when any kind of writing contains all\n\nits other parts, such as fable, action, characters, sentiments, and\n\ndiction, and is deficient in metre only, it seems, I think, reasonable\n\nto refer it to the epic; at least, as no critic hath thought proper to\n\nrange it under any other head, or to assign it a particular name\n\nto itself.\n\nThus the Telemachus of the archbishop of Cambray appears to me of the\n\nepic kind, as well as the Odyssey of Homer; indeed, it is much fairer\n\nand more reasonable to give it a name common with that species from\n\nwhich it differs only in a single instance, than to confound it with\n\nthose which it resembles in no other. Such are those voluminous works,\n\ncommonly called Romances, namely, Clelia, Cleopatra, Astraea, Cassandra,\n\nthe Grand Cyrus, and innumerable others, which contain, as I apprehend,\n\nvery little instruction or entertainment.\n\nNow, a comic romance is a comic epic poem in prose; differing from\n\ncomedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being more extended\n\nand comprehensive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and\n\nintroducing a greater variety of characters. It differs from the serious\n\nromance in its fable and action, in this; that as in the one these are\n\ngrave and solemn, so in the other they are light and ridiculous: it\n\ndiffers in its characters by introducing persons of inferior rank, and\n\nconsequently, of inferior manners, whereas the grave romance sets the\n\nhighest before us: lastly, in its sentiments and diction; by preserving\n\nthe ludicrous instead of the sublime. In the diction, I think,\n\nburlesque itself may be sometimes admitted; of which many instances\n\nwill occur in this work, as in the description of the battles, and some\n\nother places, not necessary to be pointed out to the classical reader,\n\nfor whose entertainment those parodies or burlesque imitations are\n\nchiefly calculated.\n\nBut though we have sometimes admitted this in our diction, we have\n\ncarefully excluded it from our sentiments and characters; for there it\n\nis never properly introduced, unless in writings of the burlesque kind,\n\nwhich this is not intended to be. Indeed, no two species of writing can\n\ndiffer more widely than the comic and the burlesque; for as the latter\n\nis ever the exhibition of what is monstrous and unnatural, and where our\n\ndelight, if we examine it, arises from the surprizing absurdity, as in\n\nappropriating the manners of the highest to the lowest, or _e converso_;\n\nso in the former we should ever confine ourselves strictly to nature,\n\nfrom the just imitation of which will flow all the pleasure we can this\n\nway convey to a sensible reader. And perhaps there is one reason why a\n\ncomic writer should of all others be the least excused for deviating\n\nfrom nature, since it may not be always so easy for a serious poet to\n\nmeet with the great and the admirable; but life everywhere furnishes an\n\naccurate observer with the ridiculous.\n\nI have hinted this little concerning burlesque, because I have often\n\nheard that name given to performances which have been truly of the comic\n\nkind, from the author's having sometimes admitted it in his diction\n\nonly; which, as it is the dress of poetry, doth, like the dress of men,\n\nestablish characters (the one of the whole poem, and the other of the\n\nwhole man), in vulgar opinion, beyond any of their greater excellences:\n\nbut surely, a certain drollery in stile, where characters and sentiments\n\nare perfectly natural, no more constitutes the burlesque, than an empty\n\npomp and dignity of words, where everything else is mean and low, can\n\nentitle any performance to the appellation of the true sublime.\n\nAnd I apprehend my Lord Shaftesbury's opinion of mere burlesque agrees\n\nwith mine, when he asserts, There is no such thing to be found in the\n\nwritings of the ancients. But perhaps I have less abhorrence than he\n\nprofesses for it; and that, not because I have had some little success\n\non the stage this way, but rather as it contributes more to exquisite\n\nmirth and laughter than any other; and these are probably more wholesome\n\nphysic for the mind, and conduce better to purge away spleen,\n\nmelancholy, and ill affections, than is generally imagined. Nay, I will\n\nappeal to common observation, whether the same companies are not found\n\nmore full of good-humour and benevolence, after they have been sweetened\n\nfor two or three hours with entertainments of this kind, than when\n\nsoured by a tragedy or a grave lecture.\n\nBut to illustrate all this by another science, in which, perhaps, we\n\nshall see the distinction more clearly and plainly, let us examine the\n\nworks of a comic history painter, with those performances which the\n\nItalians call Caricatura, where we shall find the true excellence of the\n\nformer to consist in the exactest copying of nature; insomuch that a\n\njudicious eye instantly rejects anything _outre_, any liberty which the\n\npainter hath taken with the features of that _alma mater_; whereas in\n\nthe Caricatura we allow all licence--its aim is to exhibit monsters,\n\nnot men; and all distortions and exaggerations whatever are within its\n\nproper province.\n\nNow, what Caricatura is in painting, Burlesque is in writing; and in the\n\nsame manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other. And\n\nhere I shall observe, that, as in the former the painter seems to have\n\nthe advantage; so it is in the latter infinitely on the side of the\n\nwriter; for the Monstrous is much easier to paint than describe, and the\n\nRidiculous to describe than paint.\n\nAnd though perhaps this latter species doth not in either science so\n\nstrongly affect and agitate the muscles as the other; yet it will be\n\nowned, I believe, that a more rational and useful pleasure arises to us\n\nfrom it. He who should call the ingenious Hogarth a burlesque painter,\n\nwould, in my opinion, do him very little honour; for sure it is much\n\neasier, much less the subject of admiration, to paint a man with a nose,\n\nor any other feature, of a preposterous size, or to expose him in some\n\nabsurd or monstrous attitude, than to express the affections of men on\n\ncanvas. It hath been thought a vast commendation of a painter to say his\n\nfigures seem to breathe; but surely it is a much greater and nobler\n\napplause, that they appear to think.\n\nBut to return. The Ridiculous only, as I have before said, falls within\n\nmy province in the present work. Nor will some explanation of this word\n\nbe thought impertinent by the reader, if he considers how wonderfully it\n\nhath been mistaken, even by writers who have professed it: for to what\n\nbut such a mistake can we attribute the many attempts to ridicule the\n\nblackest villanies, and, what is yet worse, the most dreadful\n\ncalamities? What could exceed the absurdity of an author, who should\n\nwrite the comedy of Nero, with the merry incident of ripping up his\n\nmother's belly? or what would give a greater shock to humanity than an\n\nattempt to expose the miseries of poverty and distress to ridicule? And\n\nyet the reader will not want much learning to suggest such instances\n\nto himself.\n\nBesides, it may seem remarkable, that Aristotle, who is so fond and free\n\nof definitions, hath not thought proper to define the Ridiculous.\n\nIndeed, where he tells us it is proper to comedy, he hath remarked that\n\nvillany is not its object: but he hath not, as I remember, positively\n\nasserted what is. Nor doth the Abbe Bellegarde, who hath written a\n\ntreatise on this subject, though he shows us many species of it, once\n\ntrace it to its fountain.\n\nThe only source of the true Ridiculous (as it appears to me) is\n\naffectation. But though it arises from one spring only, when we consider\n\nthe infinite streams into which this one branches, we shall presently\n\ncease to admire at the copious field it affords to an observer. Now,\n\naffectation proceeds from one of these two causes, vanity or hypocrisy:\n\nfor as vanity puts us on affecting false characters, in order to\n\npurchase applause; so hypocrisy sets us on an endeavour to avoid\n\ncensure, by concealing our vices under an appearance of their opposite\n\nvirtues. And though these two causes are often confounded (for there is\n\nsome difficulty in distinguishing them), yet, as they proceed from very\n\ndifferent motives, so they are as clearly distinct in their operations:\n\nfor indeed, the affectation which arises from vanity is nearer to truth\n\nthan the other, as it hath not that violent repugnancy of nature to\n\nstruggle with, which that of the hypocrite hath. It may be likewise\n\nnoted, that affectation doth not imply an absolute negation of those\n\nqualities which are affected; and, therefore, though, when it proceeds\n\nfrom hypocrisy, it be nearly allied to deceit; yet when it comes from\n\nvanity only, it partakes of the nature of ostentation: for instance, the\n\naffectation of liberality in a vain man differs visibly from the same\n\naffectation in the avaricious; for though the vain man is not what he\n\nwould appear, or hath not the virtue he affects, to the degree he would\n\nbe thought to have it; yet it sits less awkwardly on him than on the\n\navaricious man, who is the very reverse of what he would seem to be.\n\nFrom the discovery of this affectation arises the Ridiculous, which\n\nalways strikes the reader with surprize and pleasure; and that in a\n\nhigher and stronger degree when the affectation arises from hypocrisy,\n\nthan when from vanity; for to discover any one to be the exact reverse\n\nof what he affects, is more surprizing, and consequently more\n\nridiculous, than to find him a little deficient in the quality he\n\ndesires the reputation of. I might observe that our Ben Jonson, who of\n\nall men understood the Ridiculous the best, hath chiefly used the\n\nhypocritical affectation.\n\nNow, from affectation only, the misfortunes and calamities of life, or\n\nthe imperfections of nature, may become the objects of ridicule. Surely\n\nhe hath a very ill-framed mind who can look on ugliness, infirmity, or\n\npoverty, as ridiculous in themselves: nor do I believe any man living,\n\nwho meets a dirty fellow riding through the streets in a cart, is\n\nstruck with an idea of the Ridiculous from it; but if he should see the\n\nsame figure descend from his coach and six, or bolt from his chair with\n\nhis hat under his arm, he would then begin to laugh, and with justice.\n\nIn the same manner, were we to enter a poor house and behold a wretched\n\nfamily shivering with cold and languishing with hunger, it would not\n\nincline us to laughter (at least we must have very diabolical natures if\n\nit would); but should we discover there a grate, instead of coals,\n\nadorned with flowers, empty plate or china dishes on the sideboard, or\n\nany other affectation of riches and finery, either on their persons or\n\nin their furniture, we might then indeed be excused for ridiculing so\n\nfantastical an appearance. Much less are natural imperfections the\n\nobject of derision; but when ugliness aims at the applause of beauty, or\n\nlameness endeavours to display agility, it is then that these\n\nunfortunate circumstances, which at first moved our compassion, tend\n\nonly to raise our mirth.\n\nThe poet carries this very far:--\n\nNone are for being what they are in fault,\n\nBut for not being what they would be thought.\n\nWhere if the metre would suffer the word Ridiculous to close the first\n\nline, the thought would be rather more proper. Great vices are the\n\nproper objects of our detestation, smaller faults, of our pity; but\n\naffectation appears to me the only true source of the Ridiculous.\n\nBut perhaps it may be objected to me, that I have against my own rules\n\nintroduced vices, and of a very black kind, into this work. To which I\n\nshall answer: first, that it is very difficult to pursue a series of\n\nhuman actions, and keep clear from them. Secondly, that the vices to be\n\nfound here are rather the accidental consequences of some human frailty\n\nor foible, than causes habitually existing in the mind. Thirdly, that\n\nthey are never set forth as the objects of ridicule, but detestation.\n\nFourthly, that they are never the principal figure at that time on the\n\nscene: and, lastly, they never produce the intended evil.\n\nHaving thus distinguished Joseph Andrews from the productions of romance\n\nwriters on the one hand and burlesque writers on the other, and given\n\nsome few very short hints (for I intended no more) of this species of\n\nwriting, which I have affirmed to be hitherto unattempted in our\n\nlanguage; I shall leave to my good-natured reader to apply my piece to\n\nmy observations, and will detain him no longer than with a word\n\nconcerning the characters in this work.\n\nAnd here I solemnly protest I have no intention to vilify or asperse any\n\none; for though everything is copied from the book of nature, and scarce\n\na character or action produced which I have not taken from my I own\n\nobservations and experience; yet I have used the utmost care to obscure\n\nthe persons by such different circumstances, degrees, and colours, that\n\nit will be impossible to guess at them with any degree of certainty; and\n\nif it ever happens otherwise, it is only where the failure characterized\n\nis so minute, that it is a foible only which the party himself may laugh\n\nat as well as any other.\n\nAs to the character of Adams, as it is the most glaring in the whole, so\n\nI conceive it is not to be found in any book now extant. It is designed\n\na character of perfect simplicity; and as the goodness of his heart\n\nwill recommend him to the good-natured, so I hope it will excuse me to\n\nthe gentlemen of his cloth; for whom, while they are worthy of their\n\nsacred order, no man can possibly have a greater respect. They will\n\ntherefore excuse me, notwithstanding the low adventures in which he is\n\nengaged, that I have made him a clergyman; since no other office could\n\nhave given him so many opportunities of displaying his worthy\n\ninclinations.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURES OF JOSEPH ANDREWS AND HIS FRIEND MR\n\nABRAHAM ADAMS\n\nBOOK I.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n_Of writing lives in general, and particularly of Pamela; with a word by\n\nthe bye of Colley Cibber and others._\n\nIt is a trite but true observation, that examples work more forcibly on\n\nthe mind than precepts: and if this be just in what is odious and\n\nblameable, it is more strongly so in what is amiable and praiseworthy.\n\nHere emulation most effectually operates upon us, and inspires our\n\nimitation in an irresistible manner. A good man therefore is a standing\n\nlesson to all his acquaintance, and of far greater use in that narrow\n\ncircle than a good book.\n\nBut as it often happens that the best men are but little known, and\n\nconsequently cannot extend the usefulness of their examples a great way;\n\nthe writer may be called in aid to spread their history farther, and to\n\npresent the amiable pictures to those who have not the happiness of\n\nknowing the originals; and so, by communicating such valuable patterns\n\nto the world, he may perhaps do a more extensive service to mankind than\n\nthe person whose life originally afforded the pattern.\n\nIn this light I have always regarded those biographers who have recorded\n\nthe actions of great and worthy persons of both sexes. Not to mention\n\nthose antient writers which of late days are little read, being written\n\nin obsolete, and as they are generally thought, unintelligible\n\nlanguages, such as Plutarch, Nepos, and others which I heard of in my\n\nyouth; our own language affords many of excellent use and instruction,\n\nfinely calculated to sow the seeds of virtue in youth, and very easy to\n\nbe comprehended by persons of moderate capacity. Such as the history of\n\nJohn the Great, who, by his brave and heroic actions against men of\n\nlarge and athletic bodies, obtained the glorious appellation of the\n\nGiant-killer; that of an Earl of Warwick, whose Christian name was Guy;\n\nthe lives of Argalus and Parthenia; and above all, the history of those\n\nseven worthy personages, the Champions of Christendom. In all these\n\ndelight is mixed with instruction, and the reader is almost as much\n\nimproved as entertained.\n\nBut I pass by these and many others to mention two books lately\n\npublished, which represent an admirable pattern of the amiable in either\n\nsex. The former of these, which deals in male virtue, was written by the\n\ngreat person himself, who lived the life he hath recorded, and is by\n\nmany thought to have lived such a life only in order to write it. The\n\nother is communicated to us by an historian who borrows his lights, as\n\nthe common method is, from authentic papers and records. The reader, I\n\nbelieve, already conjectures, I mean the lives of Mr Colley Cibber and\n\nof Mrs Pamela Andrews. How artfully doth the former, by insinuating that\n\nhe escaped being promoted to the highest stations in Church and State,\n\nteach us a contempt of worldly grandeur! how strongly doth he inculcate\n\nan absolute submission to our superiors! Lastly, how completely doth he\n\narm us against so uneasy, so wretched a passion as the fear of shame!\n\nhow clearly doth he expose the emptiness and vanity of that phantom,\n\nreputation!\n\nWhat the female readers are taught by the memoirs of Mrs Andrews is so\n\nwell set forth in the excellent essays or letters prefixed to the second\n\nand subsequent editions of that work, that it would be here a needless\n\nrepetition. The authentic history with which I now present the public is\n\nan instance of the great good that book is likely to do, and of the\n\nprevalence of example which I have just observed: since it will appear\n\nthat it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his sister's virtues\n\nbefore his eyes, that Mr Joseph Andrews was chiefly enabled to preserve\n\nhis purity in the midst of such great temptations. I shall only add that\n\nthis character of male chastity, though doubtless as desirable and\n\nbecoming in one part of the human species as in the other, is almost the\n\nonly virtue which the great apologist hath not given himself for the\n\nsake of giving the example to his readers.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n_Of Mr Joseph Andrews, his birth, parentage, education, and great\n\nendowments; with a word or two concerning ancestors._\n\nMr Joseph Andrews, the hero of our ensuing history, was esteemed to be\n\nthe only son of Gaffar and Gammer Andrews, and brother to the\n\nillustrious Pamela, whose virtue is at present so famous. As to his\n\nancestors, we have searched with great diligence, but little success;\n\nbeing unable to trace them farther than his great-grandfather, who, as\n\nan elderly person in the parish remembers to have heard his father say,\n\nwas an excellent cudgel-player. Whether he had any ancestors before\n\nthis, we must leave to the opinion of our curious reader, finding\n\nnothing of sufficient certainty to rely on. However, we cannot omit\n\ninserting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath\n\ncommunicated:--\n\nStay, traveller, for underneath this pew\n\nLies fast asleep that merry man Andrew:\n\nWhen the last day's great sun shall gild the skies,\n\nThen he shall from his tomb get up and rise.\n\nBe merry while thou canst: for surely thou\n\nShalt shortly be as sad as he is now.\n\nThe words are almost out of the stone with antiquity. But it is needless\n\nto observe that Andrew here is writ without an _s_, and is, besides, a\n\nChristian name. My friend, moreover, conjectures this to have been the\n\nfounder of that sect of laughing philosophers since called\n\nMerry-andrews.\n\nTo waive, therefore, a circumstance which, though mentioned in\n\nconformity to the exact rules of biography, is not greatly material, I\n\nproceed to things of more consequence. Indeed, it is sufficiently\n\ncertain that he had as many ancestors as the best man living, and,\n\nperhaps, if we look five or six hundred years backwards, might be\n\nrelated to some persons of very great figure at present, whose ancestors\n\nwithin half the last century are buried in as great obscurity. But\n\nsuppose, for argument's sake, we should admit that he had no ancestors\n\nat all, but had sprung up, according to the modern phrase, out of a\n\ndunghill, as the Athenians pretended they themselves did from the earth,\n\nwould not this autokopros[A] have been justly entitled to all the\n\npraise arising from his own virtues? Would it not be hard that a man who\n\nhath no ancestors should therefore be rendered incapable of acquiring\n\nhonour; when we see so many who have no virtues enjoying the honour of\n\ntheir forefathers? At ten years old (by which time his education was\n\nadvanced to writing and reading) he was bound an apprentice, according\n\nto the statute, to Sir Thomas Booby, an uncle of Mr Booby's by the\n\nfather's side. Sir Thomas having then an estate in his own hands, the\n\nyoung Andrews was at first employed in what in the country they call\n\nkeeping birds. His office was to perform the part the ancients assigned\n\nto the god Priapus, which deity the moderns call by the name of Jack o'\n\nLent; but his voice being so extremely musical, that it rather allured\n\nthe birds than terrified them, he was soon transplanted from the fields\n\ninto the dog-kennel, where he was placed under the huntsman, and made\n\nwhat the sportsmen term whipper-in. For this place likewise the\n\nsweetness of his voice disqualified him; the dogs preferring the melody\n\nof his chiding to all the alluring notes of the huntsman, who soon\n\nbecame so incensed at it, that he desired Sir Thomas to provide\n\notherwise for him, and constantly laid every fault the dogs were at to\n\nthe account of the poor boy, who was now transplanted to the stable.\n\nHere he soon gave proofs of strength and agility beyond his years, and\n\nconstantly rode the most spirited and vicious horses to water, with an\n\nintrepidity which surprized every one. While he was in this station, he\n\nrode several races for Sir Thomas, and this with such expertness and\n\nsuccess, that the neighbouring gentlemen frequently solicited the knight\n\nto permit little Joey (for so he was called) to ride their matches. The\n\nbest gamesters, before they laid their money, always inquired which\n\nhorse little Joey was to ride; and the bets were rather proportioned by\n\nthe rider than by the horse himself; especially after he had scornfully\n\nrefused a considerable bribe to play booty on such an occasion. This\n\nextremely raised his character, and so pleased the Lady Booby, that she\n\ndesired to have him (being now seventeen years of age) for her\n\nown footboy.\n\n[A] In English, sprung from a dunghill.\n\nJoey was now preferred from the stable to attend on his lady, to go on\n\nher errands, stand behind her chair, wait at her tea-table, and carry\n\nher prayer-book to church; at which place his voice gave him an\n\nopportunity of distinguishing himself by singing psalms: he behaved\n\nlikewise in every other respect so well at Divine service, that it\n\nrecommended him to the notice of Mr Abraham Adams, the curate, who took\n\nan opportunity one day, as he was drinking a cup of ale in Sir Thomas's\n\nkitchen, to ask the young man several questions concerning religion;\n\nwith his answers to which he was wonderfully pleased.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n_Of Mr Abraham Adams the curate, Mrs Slipslop the chambermaid, and\n\nothers._\n\nMr Abraham Adams was an excellent scholar. He was a perfect master of\n\nthe Greek and Latin languages; to which he added a great share of\n\nknowledge in the Oriental tongues; and could read and translate French,\n\nItalian, and Spanish. He had applied many years to the most severe\n\nstudy, and had treasured up a fund of learning rarely to be met with in\n\na university. He was, besides, a man of good sense, good parts, and good\n\nnature; but was at the same time as entirely ignorant of the ways of\n\nthis world as an infant just entered into it could possibly be. As he\n\nhad never any intention to deceive, so he never suspected such a design\n\nin others. He was generous, friendly, and brave to an excess; but\n\nsimplicity was his characteristick: he did, no more than Mr Colley\n\nCibber, apprehend any such passions as malice and envy to exist in\n\nmankind; which was indeed less remarkable in a country parson than in a\n\ngentleman who hath passed his life behind the scenes,--a place which\n\nhath been seldom thought the school of innocence, and where a very\n\nlittle observation would have convinced the great apologist that those\n\npassions have a real existence in the human mind.\n\nHis virtue, and his other qualifications, as they rendered him equal to\n\nhis office, so they made him an agreeable and valuable companion, and\n\nhad so much endeared and well recommended him to a bishop, that at the\n\nage of fifty he was provided with a handsome income of twenty-three\n\npounds a year; which, however, he could not make any great figure with,\n\nbecause he lived in a dear country, and was a little encumbered with a\n\nwife and six children.\n\nIt was this gentleman, who having, as I have said, observed the singular\n\ndevotion of young Andrews, had found means to question him concerning\n\nseveral particulars; as, how many books there were in the New Testament?\n\nwhich were they? how many chapters they contained? and such like: to all\n\nwhich, Mr Adams privately said, he answered much better than Sir Thomas,\n\nor two other neighbouring justices of the peace could probably\n\nhave done.\n\nMr Adams was wonderfully solicitous to know at what time, and by what\n\nopportunity, the youth became acquainted with these matters: Joey told\n\nhim that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodness of\n\nhis father, who, though he had not interest enough to get him into a\n\ncharity school, because a cousin of his father's landlord did not vote\n\non the right side for a churchwarden in a borough town, yet had been\n\nhimself at the expense of sixpence a week for his learning. He told him\n\nlikewise, that ever since he was in Sir Thomas's family he had employed\n\nall his hours of leisure in reading good books; that he had read the\n\nBible, the Whole Duty of Man, and Thomas a Kempis; and that as often as\n\nhe could, without being perceived, he had studied a great good book\n\nwhich lay open in the hall window, where he had read, \"as how the devil\n\ncarried away half a church in sermon-time, without hurting one of the\n\ncongregation; and as how a field of corn ran away down a hill with all\n\nthe trees upon it, and covered another man's meadow.\" This sufficiently\n\nassured Mr Adams that the good book meant could be no other than Baker's\n\nChronicle.\n\nThe curate, surprized to find such instances of industry and application\n\nin a young man who had never met with the least encouragement, asked\n\nhim, If he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education, and\n\nthe not having been born of parents who might have indulged his talents\n\nand desire of knowledge? To which he answered, \"He hoped he had profited\n\nsomewhat better from the books he had read than to lament his condition\n\nin this world. That, for his part, he was perfectly content with the\n\nstate to which he was called; that he should endeavour to improve his\n\ntalent, which was all required of him; but not repine at his own lot,\n\nnor envy those of his betters.\" \"Well said, my lad,\" replied the curate;\n\n\"and I wish some who have read many more good books, nay, and some who\n\nhave written good books themselves, had profited so much by them.\"\n\nAdams had no nearer access to Sir Thomas or my lady than through the\n\nwaiting-gentlewoman; for Sir Thomas was too apt to estimate men merely\n\nby their dress or fortune; and my lady was a woman of gaiety, who had\n\nbeen blest with a town education, and never spoke of any of her country\n\nneighbours by any other appellation than that of the brutes. They both\n\nregarded the curate as a kind of domestic only, belonging to the parson\n\nof the parish, who was at this time at variance with the knight; for the\n\nparson had for many years lived in a constant state of civil war, or,\n\nwhich is perhaps as bad, of civil law, with Sir Thomas himself and the\n\ntenants of his manor. The foundation of this quarrel was a modus, by\n\nsetting which aside an advantage of several shillings _per annum_ would\n\nhave accrued to the rector; but he had not yet been able to accomplish\n\nhis purpose, and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the suits than\n\nthe pleasure (which he used indeed frequently to say was no small one)\n\nof reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants,\n\nthough he had at the same time greatly impoverished himself.\n\nMrs Slipslop, the waiting-gentlewoman, being herself the daughter of a\n\ncurate, preserved some respect for Adams: she professed great regard for\n\nhis learning, and would frequently dispute with him on points of\n\ntheology; but always insisted on a deference to be paid to her\n\nunderstanding, as she had been frequently at London, and knew more of\n\nthe world than a country parson could pretend to.\n\nShe had in these disputes a particular advantage over Adams: for she was\n\na mighty affecter of hard words, which she used in such a manner that\n\nthe parson, who durst not offend her by calling her words in question,\n\nwas frequently at some loss to guess her meaning, and would have been\n\nmuch less puzzled by an Arabian manuscript.\n\nAdams therefore took an opportunity one day, after a pretty long\n\ndiscourse with her on the essence (or, as she pleased to term it, the\n\nincence) of matter, to mention the case of young Andrews; desiring her\n\nto recommend him to her lady as a youth very susceptible of learning,\n\nand one whose instruction in Latin he would himself undertake; by which\n\nmeans he might be qualified for a higher station than that of a footman;\n\nand added, she knew it was in his master's power easily to provide for\n\nhim in a better manner. He therefore desired that the boy might be left\n\nbehind under his care.\n\n\"La! Mr Adams,\" said Mrs Slipslop, \"do you think my lady will suffer any\n\npreambles about any such matter? She is going to London very concisely,\n\nand I am confidous would not leave Joey behind her on any account; for\n\nhe is one of the genteelest young fellows you may see in a summer's day;\n\nand I am confidous she would as soon think of parting with a pair of her\n\ngrey mares, for she values herself as much on one as the other.\" Adams\n\nwould have interrupted, but she proceeded: \"And why is Latin more\n\nnecessitous for a footman than a gentleman? It is very proper that you\n\nclergymen must learn it, because you can't preach without it: but I have\n\nheard gentlemen say in London, that it is fit for nobody else. I am\n\nconfidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it; and I shall\n\ndraw myself into no such delemy.\" At which words her lady's bell rung,\n\nand Mr Adams was forced to retire; nor could he gain a second\n\nopportunity with her before their London journey, which happened a few\n\ndays afterwards. However, Andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully\n\nto him for his intended kindness, which he told him he never would\n\nforget, and at the same time received from the good man many admonitions\n\nconcerning the regulation of his future conduct, and his perseverance in\n\ninnocence and industry.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n_What happened after their journey to London._\n\nNo sooner was young Andrews arrived at London than he began to scrape an\n\nacquaintance with his party-coloured brethren, who endeavoured to make\n\nhim despise his former course of life. His hair was cut after the newest\n\nfashion, and became his chief care; he went abroad with it all the\n\nmorning in papers, and drest it out in the afternoon. They could not,\n\nhowever, teach him to game, swear, drink, nor any other genteel vice the\n\ntown abounded with. He applied most of his leisure hours to music, in\n\nwhich he greatly improved himself; and became so perfect a connoisseur\n\nin that art, that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an\n\nopera, and they never condemned or applauded a single song contrary to\n\nhis approbation or dislike. He was a little too forward in riots at the\n\nplay-houses and assemblies; and when he attended his lady at church\n\n(which was but seldom) he behaved with less seeming devotion than\n\nformerly: however, if he was outwardly a pretty fellow, his morals\n\nremained entirely uncorrupted, though he was at the same time smarter\n\nand genteeler than any of the beaus in town, either in or out of livery.\n\nHis lady, who had often said of him that Joey was the handsomest and\n\ngenteelest footman in the kingdom, but that it was pity he wanted\n\nspirit, began now to find that fault no longer; on the contrary, she was\n\nfrequently heard to cry out, \"Ay, there is some life in this fellow.\"\n\nShe plainly saw the effects which the town air hath on the soberest\n\nconstitutions. She would now walk out with him into Hyde Park in a\n\nmorning, and when tired, which happened almost every minute, would lean\n\non his arm, and converse with him in great familiarity. Whenever she\n\nstept out of her coach, she would take him by the hand, and sometimes,\n\nfor fear of stumbling, press it very hard; she admitted him to deliver\n\nmessages at her bedside in a morning, leered at him at table, and\n\nindulged him in all those innocent freedoms which women of figure may\n\npermit without the least sully of their virtue.\n\nBut though their virtue remains unsullied, yet now and then some small\n\narrows will glance on the shadow of it, their reputation; and so it fell\n\nout to Lady Booby, who happened to be walking arm-in-arm with Joey one\n\nmorning in Hyde Park, when Lady Tittle and Lady Tattle came accidentally\n\nby in their coach. \"Bless me,\" says Lady Tittle, \"can I believe my eyes?\n\nIs that Lady Booby?\"--\"Surely,\" says Tattle. \"But what makes you\n\nsurprized?\"--\"Why, is not that her footman?\" replied Tittle. At which\n\nTattle laughed, and cried, \"An old business, I assure you: is it\n\npossible you should not have heard it? The whole town hath known it this\n\nhalf-year.\" The consequence of this interview was a whisper through a\n\nhundred visits, which were separately performed by the two ladies[A] the\n\nsame afternoon, and might have had a mischievous effect, had it not been\n\nstopt by two fresh reputations which were published the day afterwards,\n\nand engrossed the whole talk of the town.\n\n[A] It may seem an absurdity that Tattle should visit, as she actually\n\ndid, to spread a known scandal: but the reader may reconcile this by\n\nsupposing, with me, that, notwithstanding what she says, this was\n\nher first acquaintance with it.\n\nBut, whatever opinion or suspicion the scandalous inclination of\n\ndefamers might entertain of Lady Booby's innocent freedoms, it is\n\ncertain they made no impression on young Andrews, who never offered to\n\nencroach beyond the liberties which his lady allowed him,--a behaviour\n\nwhich she imputed to the violent respect he preserved for her, and which\n\nserved only to heighten a something she began to conceive, and which\n\nthe next chapter will open a little farther.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n_The death of Sir Thomas Booby, with the affectionate and mournful\n\nbehaviour of his widow, and the great purity of Joseph Andrews._\n\nAt this time an accident happened which put a stop to those agreeable\n\nwalks, which probably would have soon puffed up the cheeks of Fame, and\n\ncaused her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town; and this was no\n\nother than the death of Sir Thomas Booby, who, departing this life, left\n\nhis disconsolate lady confined to her house, as closely as if she\n\nherself had been attacked by some violent disease. During the first six\n\ndays the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slipslop, and three female\n\nfriends, who made a party at cards: but on the seventh she ordered Joey,\n\nwhom, for a good reason, we shall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her\n\ntea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Joseph to her, bade him sit\n\ndown, and, having accidentally laid her hand on his, she asked him if he\n\nhad ever been in love. Joseph answered, with some confusion, it was time\n\nenough for one so young as himself to think on such things. \"As young as\n\nyou are,\" replied the lady, \"I am convinced you are no stranger to that\n\npassion. Come, Joey,\" says she, \"tell me truly, who is the happy girl\n\nwhose eyes have made a conquest of you?\" Joseph returned, that all the\n\nwomen he had ever seen were equally indifferent to him. \"Oh then,\" said\n\nthe lady, \"you are a general lover. Indeed, you handsome fellows, like\n\nhandsome women, are very long and difficult in fixing; but yet you\n\nshall never persuade me that your heart is so insusceptible of\n\naffection; I rather impute what you say to your secrecy, a very\n\ncommendable quality, and what I am far from being angry with you for.\n\nNothing can be more unworthy in a young man, than to betray any\n\nintimacies with the ladies.\" \"Ladies! madam,\" said Joseph, \"I am sure I\n\nnever had the impudence to think of any that deserve that name.\" \"Don't\n\npretend to too much modesty,\" said she, \"for that sometimes may be\n\nimpertinent: but pray answer me this question. Suppose a lady should\n\nhappen to like you; suppose she should prefer you to all your sex, and\n\nadmit you to the same familiarities as you might have hoped for if you\n\nhad been born her equal, are you certain that no vanity could tempt you\n\nto discover her? Answer me honestly, Joseph; have you so much more sense\n\nand so much more virtue than you handsome young fellows generally have,\n\nwho make no scruple of sacrificing our dear reputation to your pride,\n\nwithout considering the great obligation we lay on you by our\n\ncondescension and confidence? Can you keep a secret, my Joey?\" \"Madam,\"\n\nsays he, \"I hope your ladyship can't tax me with ever betraying the\n\nsecrets of the family; and I hope, if you was to turn me away, I might\n\nhave that character of you.\" \"I don't intend to turn you away, Joey,\"\n\nsaid she, and sighed; \"I am afraid it is not in my power.\" She then\n\nraised herself a little in her bed, and discovered one of the whitest\n\nnecks that ever was seen; at which Joseph blushed. \"La!\" says she, in an\n\naffected surprize, \"what am I doing? I have trusted myself with a man\n\nalone, naked in bed; suppose you should have any wicked intentions upon\n\nmy honour, how should I defend myself?\" Joseph protested that he never\n\nhad the least evil design against her. \"No,\" says she, \"perhaps you may\n\nnot call your designs wicked; and perhaps they are not so.\"--He swore\n\nthey were not. \"You misunderstand me,\" says she; \"I mean if they were\n\nagainst my honour, they may not be wicked; but the world calls them so.\n\nBut then, say you, the world will never know anything of the matter; yet\n\nwould not that be trusting to your secrecy? Must not my reputation be\n\nthen in your power? Would you not then be my master?\" Joseph begged her\n\nladyship to be comforted; for that he would never imagine the least\n\nwicked thing against her, and that he had rather die a thousand deaths\n\nthan give her any reason to suspect him. \"Yes,\" said she, \"I must have\n\nreason to suspect you. Are you not a man? and, without vanity, I may\n\npretend to some charms. But perhaps you may fear I should prosecute you;\n\nindeed I hope you do; and yet Heaven knows I should never have the\n\nconfidence to appear before a court of justice; and you know, Joey, I am\n\nof a forgiving temper. Tell me, Joey, don't you think I should forgive\n\nyou?\"--\"Indeed, madam,\" says Joseph, \"I will never do anything to\n\ndisoblige your ladyship.\"--\"How,\" says she, \"do you think it would not\n\ndisoblige me then? Do you think I would willingly suffer you?\"--\"I don't\n\nunderstand you, madam,\" says Joseph.--\"Don't you?\" said she, \"then you\n\nare either a fool, or pretend to be so; I find I was mistaken in you. So\n\nget you downstairs, and never let me see your face again; your pretended\n\ninnocence cannot impose on me.\"--\"Madam,\" said Joseph, \"I would not have\n\nyour ladyship think any evil of me. I have always endeavoured to be a\n\ndutiful servant both to you and my master.\"--\"O thou villain!\" answered\n\nmy lady; \"why didst thou mention the name of that dear man, unless to\n\ntorment me, to bring his precious memory to my mind?\" (and then she\n\nburst into a fit of tears.) \"Get thee from my sight! I shall never\n\nendure thee more.\" At which words she turned away from him; and Joseph\n\nretreated from the room in a most disconsolate condition, and writ that\n\nletter which the reader will find in the next chapter.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n_How Joseph Andrews writ a letter to his sister Pamela._\n\n\"To MRS PAMELA ANDREWS, LIVING WITH SQUIRE BOOBY.\n\n\"DEAR SISTER,--Since I received your letter of your good lady's death,\n\nwe have had a misfortune of the same kind in our family. My worthy\n\nmaster Sir Thomas died about four days ago; and, what is worse, my poor\n\nlady is certainly gone distracted. None of the servants expected her to\n\ntake it so to heart, because they quarrelled almost every day of their\n\nlives: but no more of that, because you know, Pamela, I never loved to\n\ntell the secrets of my master's family; but to be sure you must have\n\nknown they never loved one another; and I have heard her ladyship wish\n\nhis honour dead above a thousand times; but nobody knows what it is to\n\nlose a friend till they have lost him.\n\n\"Don't tell anybody what I write, because I should not care to have\n\nfolks say I discover what passes in our family; but if it had not been\n\nso great a lady, I should have thought she had had a mind to me. Dear\n\nPamela, don't tell anybody; but she ordered me to sit down by her\n\nbedside, when she was in naked bed; and she held my hand, and talked\n\nexactly as a lady does to her sweetheart in a stage-play, which I have\n\nseen in Covent Garden, while she wanted him to be no better than he\n\nshould be.\n\n\"If madam be mad, I shall not care for staying long in the family; so I\n\nheartily wish you could get me a place, either at the squire's, or some\n\nother neighbouring gentleman's, unless it be true that you are going to\n\nbe married to parson Williams, as folks talk, and then I should be very\n\nwilling to be his clerk; for which you know I am qualified, being able\n\nto read and to set a psalm.\n\n\"I fancy I shall be discharged very soon; and the moment I am, unless I\n\nhear from you, I shall return to my old master's country-seat, if it be\n\nonly to see parson Adams, who is the best man in the world. London is a\n\nbad place, and there is so little good fellowship, that the next-door\n\nneighbours don't know one another. Pray give my service to all friends\n\nthat inquire for me. So I rest\n\n\"Your loving brother,\n\n\"JOSEPH ANDREWS.\"\n\nAs soon as Joseph had sealed and directed this letter he walked\n\ndownstairs, where he met Mrs. Slipslop, with whom we shall take this\n\nopportunity to bring the reader a little better acquainted. She was a\n\nmaiden gentlewoman of about forty-five years of age, who, having made a\n\nsmall slip in her youth, had continued a good maid ever since. She was\n\nnot at this time remarkably handsome; being very short, and rather too\n\ncorpulent in body, and somewhat red, with the addition of pimples in the\n\nface. Her nose was likewise rather too large, and her eyes too little;\n\nnor did she resemble a cow so much in her breath as in two brown globes\n\nwhich she carried before her; one of her legs was also a little shorter\n\nthan the other, which occasioned her to limp as she walked. This fair\n\ncreature had long cast the eyes of affection on Joseph, in which she had\n\nnot met with quite so good success as she probably wished, though,\n\nbesides the allurements of her native charms, she had given him tea,\n\nsweetmeats, wine, and many other delicacies, of which, by keeping the\n\nkeys, she had the absolute command. Joseph, however, had not returned\n\nthe least gratitude to all these favours, not even so much as a kiss;\n\nthough I would not insinuate she was so easily to be satisfied; for\n\nsurely then he would have been highly blameable. The truth is, she was\n\narrived at an age when she thought she might indulge herself in any\n\nliberties with a man, without the danger of bringing a third person into\n\nthe world to betray them. She imagined that by so long a self-denial she\n\nhad not only made amends for the small slip of her youth above hinted\n\nat, but had likewise laid up a quantity of merit to excuse any future\n\nfailings. In a word, she resolved to give a loose to her amorous\n\ninclinations, and to pay off the debt of pleasure which she found she\n\nowed herself, as fast as possible.\n\nWith these charms of person, and in this disposition of mind, she\n\nencountered poor Joseph at the bottom of the stairs, and asked him if he\n\nwould drink a glass of something good this morning. Joseph, whose\n\nspirits were not a little cast down, very readily and thankfully\n\naccepted the offer; and together they went into a closet, where, having\n\ndelivered him a full glass of ratafia, and desired him to sit down, Mrs.\n\nSlipslop thus began:--\n\n\"Sure nothing can be a more simple contract in a woman than to place her\n\naffections on a boy. If I had ever thought it would have been my fate, I\n\nshould have wished to die a thousand deaths rather than live to see that\n\nday. If we like a man, the lightest hint sophisticates. Whereas a boy\n\nproposes upon us to break through all the regulations of modesty, before\n\nwe can make any oppression upon him.\" Joseph, who did not understand a\n\nword she said, answered, \"Yes, madam.\"--\"Yes, madam!\" replied Mrs.\n\nSlipslop with some warmth, \"Do you intend to result my passion? Is it\n\nnot enough, ungrateful as you are, to make no return to all the favours\n\nI have done you; but you must treat me with ironing? Barbarous monster!\n\nhow have I deserved that my passion should be resulted and treated with\n\nironing?\" \"Madam,\" answered Joseph, \"I don't understand your hard words;\n\nbut I am certain you have no occasion to call me ungrateful, for, so far\n\nfrom intending you any wrong, I have always loved you as well as if you\n\nhad been my own mother.\" \"How, sirrah!\" says Mrs. Slipslop in a rage;\n\n\"your own mother? Do you assinuate that I am old enough to be your\n\nmother? I don't know what a stripling may think, but I believe a man\n\nwould refer me to any green-sickness silly girl whatsomdever: but I\n\nought to despise you rather than be angry with you, for referring the\n\nconversation of girls to that of a woman of sense.\"--\"Madam,\" says\n\nJoseph, \"I am sure I have always valued the honour you did me by your\n\nconversation, for I know you are a woman of learning.\"--\"Yes, but,\n\nJoseph,\" said she, a little softened by the compliment to her learning,\n\n\"if you had a value for me, you certainly would have found some method\n\nof showing it me; for I am convicted you must see the value I have for\n\nyou. Yes, Joseph, my eyes, whether I would or no, must have declared a\n\npassion I cannot conquer.--Oh! Joseph!\"\n\nAs when a hungry tigress, who long has traversed the woods in fruitless\n\nsearch, sees within the reach of her claws a lamb, she prepares to leap\n\non her prey; or as a voracious pike, of immense size, surveys through\n\nthe liquid element a roach or gudgeon, which cannot escape her jaws,\n\nopens them wide to swallow the little fish; so did Mrs. Slipslop prepare\n\nto lay her violent amorous hands on the poor Joseph, when luckily her\n\nmistress's bell rung, and delivered the intended martyr from her\n\nclutches. She was obliged to leave him abruptly, and to defer the\n\nexecution of her purpose till some other time. We shall therefore return\n\nto the Lady Booby, and give our reader some account of her behaviour,\n\nafter she was left by Joseph in a temper of mind not greatly different\n\nfrom that of the inflamed Slipslop.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n_Sayings of wise men. A dialogue between the lady and her maid; and a\n\npanegyric, or rather satire, on the passion of love, in the\n\nsublime style._\n\nIt is the observation of some antient sage, whose name I have forgot,\n\nthat passions operate differently on the human mind, as diseases on the\n\nbody, in proportion to the strength or weakness, soundness or\n\nrottenness, of the one and the other.\n\nWe hope, therefore, a judicious reader will give himself some pains to\n\nobserve, what we have so greatly laboured to describe, the different\n\noperations of this passion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of\n\nthe Lady Booby, from those which it effected in the less polished and\n\ncoarser disposition of Mrs Slipslop.\n\nAnother philosopher, whose name also at present escapes my memory, hath\n\nsomewhere said, that resolutions taken in the absence of the beloved\n\nobject are very apt to vanish in its presence; on both which wise\n\nsayings the following chapter may serve as a comment.\n\nNo sooner had Joseph left the room in the manner we have before related\n\nthan the lady, enraged at her disappointment, began to reflect with\n\nseverity on her conduct. Her love was now changed to disdain, which\n\npride assisted to torment her. She despised herself for the meanness of\n\nher passion, and Joseph for its ill success. However, she had now got\n\nthe better of it in her own opinion, and determined immediately to\n\ndismiss the object. After much tossing and turning in her bed, and many\n\nsoliloquies, which if we had no better matter for our reader we would\n\ngive him, she at last rung the bell as above mentioned, and was\n\npresently attended by Mrs Slipslop, who was not much better pleased with\n\nJoseph than the lady herself.\n\n\"Slipslop,\" said Lady Booby, \"when did you see Joseph?\" The poor woman\n\nwas so surprized at the unexpected sound of his name at so critical a\n\ntime, that she had the greatest difficulty to conceal the confusion she\n\nwas under from her mistress; whom she answered, nevertheless, with\n\npretty good confidence, though not entirely void of fear of suspicion,\n\nthat she had not seen him that morning. \"I am afraid,\" said Lady Booby,\n\n\"he is a wild young fellow.\"--\"That he is,\" said Slipslop, \"and a\n\nwicked one too. To my knowledge he games, drinks, swears, and fights\n\neternally; besides, he is horribly indicted to wenching.\"--\"Ay!\" said\n\nthe lady, \"I never heard that of him.\"--\"O madam!\" answered the other,\n\n\"he is so lewd a rascal, that if your ladyship keeps him much longer,\n\nyou will not have one virgin in your house except myself. And yet I\n\ncan't conceive what the wenches see in him, to be so foolishly fond as\n\nthey are; in my eyes, he is as ugly a scarecrow as I ever\n\nupheld.\"--\"Nay,\" said the lady, \"the boy is well enough.\"--\"La! ma'am,\"\n\ncries Slipslop, \"I think him the ragmaticallest fellow in the\n\nfamily.\"--\"Sure, Slipslop,\" says she, \"you are mistaken: but which of\n\nthe women do you most suspect?\"--\"Madam,\" says Slipslop, \"there is Betty\n\nthe chambermaid, I am almost convicted, is with child by him.\"--\"Ay!\"\n\nsays the lady, \"then pray pay her her wage"
