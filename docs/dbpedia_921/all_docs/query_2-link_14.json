        "text": "CHAPTER VI.\n\n_Moral reflections by Joseph Andrews; with the hunting adventure, and\n\nparson Adams's miraculous escape._\n\n\"I have often wondered, sir,\" said Joseph, \"to observe so few instances\n\nof charity among mankind; for though the goodness of a man's heart did\n\nnot incline him to relieve the distresses of his fellow-creatures,\n\nmethinks the desire of honour should move him to it. What inspires a man\n\nto build fine houses, to purchase fine furniture, pictures, clothes, and\n\nother things, at a great expense, but an ambition to be respected more\n\nthan other people? Now, would not one great act of charity, one instance\n\nof redeeming a poor family from all the miseries of poverty, restoring\n\nan unfortunate tradesman by a sum of money to the means of procuring a\n\nlivelihood by his industry, discharging an undone debtor from his debts\n\nor a gaol, or any suchlike example of goodness, create a man more honour\n\nand respect than he could acquire by the finest house, furniture,\n\npictures, or clothes, that were ever beheld? For not only the object\n\nhimself who was thus relieved, but all who heard the name of such a\n\nperson, must, I imagine, reverence him infinitely more than the\n\npossessor of all those other things; which when we so admire, we rather\n\npraise the builder, the workman, the painter, the lace-maker, the\n\ntaylor, and the rest, by whose ingenuity they are produced, than the\n\nperson who by his money makes them his own. For my own part, when I have\n\nwaited behind my lady in a room hung with fine pictures, while I have\n\nbeen looking at them I have never once thought of their owner, nor hath\n\nany one else, as I ever observed; for when it hath been asked whose\n\npicture that was, it was never once answered the master's of the house;\n\nbut Ammyconni, Paul Varnish, Hannibal Scratchi, or Hogarthi, which I\n\nsuppose were the names of the painters; but if it was asked--Who\n\nredeemed such a one out of prison? Who lent such a ruined tradesman\n\nmoney to set up? Who clothed that family of poor small children? it is\n\nvery plain what must be the answer. And besides, these great folks are\n\nmistaken if they imagine they get any honour at all by these means; for\n\nI do not remember I ever was with my lady at any house where she\n\ncommended the house or furniture but I have heard her at her return home\n\nmake sport and jeer at whatever she had before commended; and I have\n\nbeen told by other gentlemen in livery that it is the same in their\n\nfamilies: but I defy the wisest man in the world to turn a true good\n\naction into ridicule. I defy him to do it. He who should endeavour it\n\nwould be laughed at himself, instead of making others laugh. Nobody\n\nscarce doth any good, yet they all agree in praising those who do.\n\nIndeed, it is strange that all men should consent in commending\n\ngoodness, and no man endeavour to deserve that commendation; whilst, on\n\nthe contrary, all rail at wickedness, and all are as eager to be what\n\nthey abuse. This I know not the reason of; but it is as plain as\n\ndaylight to those who converse in the world, as I have done these three\n\nyears.\" \"Are all the great folks wicked then?\" says Fanny. \"To be sure\n\nthere are some exceptions,\" answered Joseph. \"Some gentlemen of our\n\ncloth report charitable actions done by their lords and masters; and I\n\nhave heard Squire Pope, the great poet, at my lady's table, tell stories\n\nof a man that lived at a place called Ross, and another at the Bath, one\n\nAl--Al--I forget his name, but it is in the book of verses. This\n\ngentleman hath built up a stately house too, which the squire likes very\n\nwell; but his charity is seen farther than his house, though it stands\n\non a hill,--ay, and brings him more honour too. It was his charity that\n\nput him in the book, where the squire says he puts all those who deserve\n\nit; and to be sure, as he lives among all the great people, if there\n\nwere any such, he would know them.\" This was all of Mr Joseph Andrews's\n\nspeech which I could get him to recollect, which I have delivered as\n\nnear as was possible in his own words, with a very small embellishment.\n\nBut I believe the reader hath not been a little surprized at the long\n\nsilence of parson Adams, especially as so many occasions offered\n\nthemselves to exert his curiosity and observation. The truth is, he was\n\nfast asleep, and had so been from the beginning of the preceding\n\nnarrative; and, indeed, if the reader considers that so many hours had\n\npassed since he had closed his eyes, he will not wonder at his repose,\n\nthough even Henley himself, or as great an orator (if any such be), had\n\nbeen in his rostrum or tub before him.\n\nJoseph, who whilst he was speaking had continued in one attitude, with\n\nhis head reclining on one side, and his eyes cast on the ground, no\n\nsooner perceived, on looking up, the position of Adams, who was\n\nstretched on his back, and snored louder than the usual braying of the\n\nanimal with long ears, than he turned towards Fanny, and, taking her\n\nby the hand, began a dalliance, which, though consistent with the\n\npurest innocence and decency, neither he would have attempted nor she\n\npermitted before any witness. Whilst they amused themselves in this\n\nharmless and delightful manner they heard a pack of hounds approaching\n\nin full cry towards them, and presently afterwards saw a hare pop\n\nforth from the wood, and, crossing the water, land within a few yards\n\nof them in the meadows. The hare was no sooner on shore than it seated\n\nitself on its hinder legs, and listened to the sound of the pursuers.\n\nFanny was wonderfully pleased with the little wretch, and eagerly\n\nlonged to have it in her arms that she might preserve it from the\n\ndangers which seemed to threaten it; but the rational part of the\n\ncreation do not always aptly distinguish their friends from their foes;\n\nwhat wonder then if this silly creature, the moment it beheld her,\n\nfled from the friend who would have protected it, and, traversing the\n\nmeadows again, passed the little rivulet on the opposite side? It was,\n\nhowever, so spent and weak, that it fell down twice or thrice in its\n\nway. This affected the tender heart of Fanny, who exclaimed, with tears\n\nin her eyes, against the barbarity of worrying a poor innocent\n\ndefenceless animal out of its life, and putting it to the extremest\n\ntorture for diversion. She had not much time to make reflections of\n\nthis kind, for on a sudden the hounds rushed through the wood, which\n\nresounded with their throats and the throats of their retinue, who\n\nattended on them on horseback. The dogs now past the rivulet, and\n\npursued the footsteps of the hare; five horsemen attempted to leap\n\nover, three of whom succeeded, and two were in the attempt thrown from\n\ntheir saddles into the water; their companions, and their own horses\n\ntoo, proceeded after their sport, and left their friends and riders to\n\ninvoke the assistance of Fortune, or employ the more active means of\n\nstrength and agility for their deliverance. Joseph, however, was not\n\nso unconcerned on this occasion; he left Fanny for a moment to herself,\n\nand ran to the gentlemen, who were immediately on their legs, shaking\n\ntheir ears, and easily, with the help of his hand, obtained the bank\n\n(for the rivulet was not at all deep); and, without staying to thank\n\ntheir kind assister, ran dripping across the meadow, calling to their\n\nbrother sportsmen to stop their horses; but they heard them not.\n\nThe hounds were now very little behind their poor reeling, staggering\n\nprey, which, fainting almost at every step, crawled through the wood,\n\nand had almost got round to the place where Fanny stood, when it was\n\novertaken by its enemies, and being driven out of the covert, was\n\ncaught, and instantly tore to pieces before Fanny's face, who was unable\n\nto assist it with any aid more powerful than pity; nor could she prevail\n\non Joseph, who had been himself a sportsman in his youth, to attempt\n\nanything contrary to the laws of hunting in favour of the hare, which he\n\nsaid was killed fairly.\n\nThe hare was caught within a yard or two of Adams, who lay asleep at\n\nsome distance from the lovers; and the hounds, in devouring it, and\n\npulling it backwards and forwards, had drawn it so close to him, that\n\nsome of them (by mistake perhaps for the hare's skin) laid hold of the\n\nskirts of his cassock; others at the same time applying their teeth to\n\nhis wig, which he had with a handkerchief fastened to his head, began to\n\npull him about; and had not the motion of his body had more effect on\n\nhim than seemed to be wrought by the noise, they must certainly have\n\ntasted his flesh, which delicious flavour might have been fatal to him;\n\nbut being roused by these tuggings, he instantly awaked, and with a jerk\n\ndelivering his head from his wig, he with most admirable dexterity\n\nrecovered his legs, which now seemed the only members he could entrust\n\nhis safety to. Having, therefore, escaped likewise from at least a third\n\npart of his cassock, which he willingly left as his _exuviae_ or spoils\n\nto the enemy, he fled with the utmost speed he could summon to his\n\nassistance. Nor let this be any detraction from the bravery of his\n\ncharacter: let the number of the enemies, and the surprize in which he\n\nwas taken, be considered; and if there be any modern so outrageously\n\nbrave that he cannot admit of flight in any circumstance whatever, I say\n\n(but I whisper that softly, and I solemnly declare without any intention\n\nof giving offence to any brave man in the nation), I say, or rather I\n\nwhisper, that he is an ignorant fellow, and hath never read Homer nor\n\nVirgil, nor knows he anything of Hector or Turnus; nay, he is\n\nunacquainted with the history of some great men living, who, though as\n\nbrave as lions, ay, as tigers, have run away, the Lord knows how far,\n\nand the Lord knows why, to the surprize of their friends and the\n\nentertainment of their enemies. But if persons of such heroic\n\ndisposition are a little offended at the behaviour of Adams, we assure\n\nthem they shall be as much pleased with what we shall immediately relate\n\nof Joseph Andrews. The master of the pack was just arrived, or, as the\n\nsportsmen call it, come in, when Adams set out, as we have before\n\nmentioned. This gentleman was generally said to be a great lover of\n\nhumour; but, not to mince the matter, especially as we are upon this\n\nsubject, he was a great hunter of men; indeed, he had hitherto followed\n\nthe sport only with dogs of his own species; for he kept two or three\n\ncouple of barking curs for that use only. However, as he thought he had\n\nnow found a man nimble enough, he was willing to indulge himself with\n\nother sport, and accordingly, crying out, \"Stole away,\" encouraged the\n\nhounds to pursue Mr Adams, swearing it was the largest jack-hare he ever\n\nsaw; at the same time hallooing and hooping as if a conquered foe was\n\nflying before him; in which he was imitated by these two or three couple\n\nof human or rather two-legged curs on horseback which we have mentioned\n\nbefore.\n\nNow, thou, whoever thou art, whether a muse, or by what other name soever\n\nthou choosest to be called, who presidest over biography, and hast\n\ninspired all the writers of lives in these our times: thou who didst\n\ninfuse such wonderful humour into the pen of immortal Gulliver; who hast\n\ncarefully guided the judgment whilst thou hast exalted the nervous manly\n\nstyle of thy Mallet: thou who hadst no hand in that dedication and\n\npreface, or the translations, which thou wouldst willingly have struck\n\nout of the life of Cicero: lastly, thou who, without the assistance of\n\nthe least spice of literature, and even against his inclination, hast,\n\nin some pages of his book, forced Colley Cibber to write English; do\n\nthou assist me in what I find myself unequal to. Do thou introduce on\n\nthe plain the young, the gay, the brave Joseph Andrews, whilst men shall\n\nview him with admiration and envy, tender virgins with love and anxious\n\nconcern for his safety.\n\nNo sooner did Joseph Andrews perceive the distress of his friend, when\n\nfirst the quick-scenting dogs attacked him, than he grasped his cudgel\n\nin his right hand--a cudgel which his father had of his grandfather, to\n\nwhom a mighty strong man of Kent had given it for a present in that day\n\nwhen he broke three heads on the stage. It was a cudgel of mighty\n\nstrength and wonderful art, made by one of Mr Deard's best workmen, whom\n\nno other artificer can equal, and who hath made all those sticks which\n\nthe beaus have lately walked with about the Park in a morning; but this\n\nwas far his masterpiece. On its head was engraved a nose and chin, which\n\nmight have been mistaken for a pair of nutcrackers. The learned have\n\nimagined it designed to represent the Gorgon; but it was in fact copied\n\nfrom the face of a certain long English baronet, of infinite wit, humour,\n\nand gravity. He did intend to have engraved here many histories: as the\n\nfirst night of Captain B----'s play, where you would have seen critics\n\nin embroidery transplanted from the boxes to the pit, whose ancient\n\ninhabitants were exalted to the galleries, where they played on\n\ncatcalls. He did intend to have painted an auction room, where Mr Cock\n\nwould have appeared aloft in his pulpit, trumpeting forth the praises of\n\na china basin, and with astonishment wondering that \"Nobody bids more\n\nfor that fine, that superb--\" He did intend to have engraved many other\n\nthings, but was forced to leave all out for want of room.\n\nNo sooner had Joseph grasped his cudgel in his hands than lightning\n\ndarted from his eyes; and the heroick youth, swift of foot, ran with the\n\nutmost speed to his friend's assistance. He overtook him just as\n\nRockwood had laid hold of the skirt of his cassock, which, being torn,\n\nhung to the ground. Reader, we would make a simile on this occasion, but\n\nfor two reasons: the first is, it would interrupt the description, which\n\nshould be rapid in this part; but that doth not weigh much, many\n\nprecedents occurring for such an interruption: the second and much the\n\ngreater reason is, that we could find no simile adequate to our purpose:\n\nfor indeed, what instance could we bring to set before our reader's eyes\n\nat once the idea of friendship, courage, youth, beauty, strength, and\n\nswiftness? all which blazed in the person of Joseph Andrews. Let those,\n\ntherefore, that describe lions and tigers, and heroes fiercer than both,\n\nraise their poems or plays with the simile of Joseph Andrews, who is\n\nhimself above the reach of any simile.\n\nNow Rockwood had laid fast hold on the parson's skirts, and stopt his\n\nflight; which Joseph no sooner perceived than he levelled his cudgel at\n\nhis head and laid him sprawling. Jowler and Ringwood then fell on his\n\ngreatcoat, and had undoubtedly brought him to the ground, had not\n\nJoseph, collecting all his force, given Jowler such a rap on the back,\n\nthat, quitting his hold, he ran howling over the plain. A harder fate\n\nremained for thee, O Ringwood! Ringwood the best hound that ever pursued\n\na hare, who never threw his tongue but where the scent was undoubtedly\n\ntrue; good at trailing, and sure in a highway; no babler, no overrunner;\n\nrespected by the whole pack, who, whenever he opened, knew the game was\n\nat hand. He fell by the stroke of Joseph. Thunder and Plunder, and\n\nWonder and Blunder, were the next victims of his wrath, and measured\n\ntheir lengths on the ground. Then Fairmaid, a bitch which Mr John Temple\n\nhad bred up in his house, and fed at his own table, and lately sent the\n\nsquire fifty miles for a present, ran fiercely at Joseph and bit him by\n\nthe leg: no dog was ever fiercer than she, being descended from an\n\nAmazonian breed, and had worried bulls in her own country, but now waged\n\nan unequal fight, and had shared the fate of those we have mentioned\n\nbefore, had not Diana (the reader may believe it or not if he pleases)\n\nin that instant interposed, and, in the shape of the huntsman, snatched\n\nher favourite up in her arms.\n\nThe parson now faced about, and with his crabstick felled many to the\n\nearth, and scattered others, till he was attacked by Caesar and pulled\n\nto the ground. Then Joseph flew to his rescue, and with such might\n\nfell on the victor, that, O eternal blot to his name! Caesar ran\n\nyelping away.\n\nThe battle now raged with the most dreadful violence, when, lo! the\n\nhuntsman, a man of years and dignity, lifted his voice, and called his\n\nhounds from the fight, telling them, in a language they understood, that\n\nit was in vain to contend longer, for that fate had decreed the victory\n\nto their enemies.\n\nThus far the muse hath with her usual dignity related this prodigious\n\nbattle, a battle we apprehend never equalled by any poet, romance or\n\nlife writer whatever, and, having brought it to a conclusion, she\n\nceased; we shall therefore proceed in our ordinary style with the\n\ncontinuation of this history. The squire and his companions, whom the\n\nfigure of Adams and the gallantry of Joseph had at first thrown into a\n\nviolent fit of laughter, and who had hitherto beheld the engagement with\n\nmore delight than any chase, shooting-match, race, cock-fighting, bull\n\nor bear baiting, had ever given them, began now to apprehend the danger\n\nof their hounds, many of which lay sprawling in the fields. The squire,\n\ntherefore, having first called his friends about him, as guards for\n\nsafety of his person, rode manfully up to the combatants, and, summoning\n\nall the terror he was master of into his countenance, demanded with an\n\nauthoritative voice of Joseph what he meant by assaulting his dogs in\n\nthat manner? Joseph answered, with great intrepidity, that they had\n\nfirst fallen on his friend; and if they had belonged to the greatest man\n\nin the kingdom, he would have treated them in the same way; for, whilst\n\nhis veins contained a single drop of blood, he would not stand idle by\n\nand see that gentleman (pointing to Adams) abused either by man or\n\nbeast; and, having so said, both he and Adams brandished their wooden\n\nweapons, and put themselves into such a posture, that the squire and his\n\ncompany thought proper to preponderate before they offered to revenge\n\nthe cause of their four-footed allies.\n\nAt this instant Fanny, whom the apprehension of Joseph's danger had\n\nalarmed so much that, forgetting her own, she had made the utmost\n\nexpedition, came up. The squire and all the horsemen were so\n\nsurprized with her beauty, that they immediately fixed both their\n\neyes and thoughts solely on her, every one declaring he had never\n\nseen so charming a creature. Neither mirth nor anger engaged them a\n\nmoment longer, but all sat in silent amaze. The huntsman only was\n\nfree from her attraction, who was busy in cutting the ears of the\n\ndogs, and endeavouring to recover them to life; in which he succeeded\n\nso well, that only two of no great note remained slaughtered on the\n\nfield of action. Upon this the huntsman declared, \"'Twas well it was\n\nno worse; for his part he could not blame the gentleman, and wondered\n\nhis master would encourage the dogs to hunt Christians; that it was\n\nthe surest way to spoil them, to make them follow vermin instead of\n\nsticking to a hare.\"\n\nThe squire, being informed of the little mischief that had been done,\n\nand perhaps having more mischief of another kind in his head, accosted\n\nMr Adams with a more favourable aspect than before: he told him he was\n\nsorry for what had happened; that he had endeavoured all he could to\n\nprevent it the moment he was acquainted with his cloth, and greatly\n\ncommended the courage of his servant, for so he imagined Joseph to be.\n\nHe then invited Mr Adams to dinner, and desired the young woman might\n\ncome with him. Adams refused a long while; but the invitation was\n\nrepeated with so much earnestness and courtesy, that at length he was\n\nforced to accept it. His wig and hat, and other spoils of the field,\n\nbeing gathered together by Joseph (for otherwise probably they would\n\nhave been forgotten), he put himself into the best order he could; and\n\nthen the horse and foot moved forward in the same pace towards the\n\nsquire's house, which stood at a very little distance.\n\nWhilst they were on the road the lovely Fanny attracted the eyes of all:\n\nthey endeavoured to outvie one another in encomiums on her beauty; which\n\nthe reader will pardon my not relating, as they had not anything new or\n\nuncommon in them: so must he likewise my not setting down the many\n\ncurious jests which were made on Adams; some of them declaring that\n\nparson-hunting was the best sport in the world; others commending his\n\nstanding at bay, which they said he had done as well as any badger; with\n\nsuch like merriment, which, though it would ill become the dignity of\n\nthis history, afforded much laughter and diversion to the squire and his\n\nfacetious companions."
