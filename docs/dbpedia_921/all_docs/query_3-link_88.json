        "text": "Their backgrounds were similar since they both were Puritans and well educated. However, their personality was completely different to each other. Although it is not very clear in the beginning of the play, as the story goes on, it becomes clear that they are different. The major difference between these characters is that Reverend Parris is extremely greedy and self-centered. He cares a lot about his reputation in the town rather than being a good minister. In Act 1, this is shown when he is talking to Abigail about her actions in the woods the previous night. He says, “ Abigail, I have fought here three long years to bend these stiff-necked people to me, and now, just now when some good respect is rising for me in the parish, you compromise my very character” (Miller 11). This shows that he is worried about how this whole situation caused by Abigail might ruin his reputation. Additionally, he says, “ It must come out – my enemies will bring it out. Let me know what you done there. Abigail, do you understand that I have many enemies?” (Miller 10). This is another example that shows instead of being worried about the witchcraft itself, he is more worried about his reputation and the minister position. It is also shown that Reverend Parris is more concerned with his salary and wood than his daughter’s health when John Proctor says, “ Mr. Parris, you are the first minister ever did demand the deed to this house” (Miller 30). On the other hand, Reverend Hale is completely opposite from Reverend Parris. As Reverend Hale is introduced, it is mentioned that Hale once gave a woman he does not know “…his kindness and a few days of rest in his own house” (Miller 33). Unlike Reverend Parris, Hale is very kind that he let a woman stay at his house. In the play, he is also described as a very calm guy. When everyone was panicking about the witchcraft, he stayed calm\n\nJoseph Plumb Martin was born “upon the twenty-first of November, in the year of 1760” (Martin 6). His grandparents raised him on their Connecticut farm. Inspired by the Battles of Lexington and Concord he decided to enlist into the army. He was eager to help for the patriotic cause. In June of 1776, at the age of 15, Martin was able to enlist but didn’t want to sign up for a long enlistment. Soldiers at the time were enlisting for a year’s service but he did not like that and thought it was too long a time for him for the first trial, “I wished only to take a priming before I took upon me the whole coat of paint for a soldier” (Martin 16). Orders soon came allowing men to enlist for six months so Martin enrolled in the Connecticut\n\nVoltaire was a famous philosopher that was strongly against an organized religion. A quote from Candide shows Voltaire curiosity of life in general. The quote states, “But for what purpose was the earth formed?” He believed in a more “open” religion rather than a set religion in which you had to strongly abide by. In Candide, the main character comes across many different religious figures in which are depicted as corrupt. This includes the Inquisitor, the Jesuit Baron and the Protestant minister. Voltaire depicts each of these religious figures as self-righteous and morally corrupt. Although, Voltaire does make an exception with the Anabaptist. Anabaptists were often persecuted which led to Voltaire defending them in the novel. James the Anabaptist\n\nThe second character, Arthur Dimmesdale is the epitome of hypocrisy. Hawthorne intended his name to have symbolic meaning, Dimmesdale meaning dim or not very bright. Arthur might be bright in the areas of theology, but when it comes to hypocrisy, he is a fool. Dimmesdale says very near the beginning of the book “What can thy silence do for him, except to tempt him---yea, compel him, as it were---to add hypocrisy to sin?”(Dimmesdale 47). He knows what will happen to him if he endures his sin in private, but he is too weak at this point in the book to admit it. The tapestries of biblical adultery, which are found in Arthur’s room, are hypocritical. These are supposed to help him atone for his sins by making him feel guilty, but he feels no better. Arthur goes and preaches every week on how bad sin is, and how he is the worst sinner of them all. These partial confessions just make him more of a hypocrite. Dimmesdale knows how the parishioners will interpret these confessions; he is not blind to their looks of adoration. Dimmesdale enjoys\n\nJohn Smith is one of the most famous people in American literature history. He was a dedicated man to his country of England, and wanted nothing more than to claim America in the name of the king. During his adventures to the new land he encountered many new things and people including a young Native American woman named Pocahontas. He also wrote many journals enticing people to want to come to America. This shall tell you the story of John Smith from his journeys as a young man all the way to when he finally came to America, and how his writings still influence people to immigrate to America still today."
