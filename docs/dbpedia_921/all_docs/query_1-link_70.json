The children living nearby planned to surprise their aged parents and regretted that one brother, living in far off Missouri, would not be present as they regretted to ask him to come such a distance. Imagine their surprise, when the longed for brother, Joseph Andrews, Jr., and his two daughters arrived from Macon, Mo., Saturday and were, therefore, present at yesterday's event.\n\nThe surprise thus occasioned was almost as great as that of the aged father and mother, who knew nothing of what was in store for them until their children commenced to file in upon them, carrying baskets filled with all the good things that earth affords. A little later the Barton band drew up in front of the house and commenced to play a favorite air. Wild with joy, yet Mr. and Mrs. Andrew had not lived so long not to be ready to adapt themselves to any emergency, and the way they hustled around and showed their appreciation must have reminded them of the day when they first started down life's journey together.\n\nTo make a long story short the day was spent in a way that was glorious to both old and young and will linger long in the memory of all present.\n\nMr. Andrews is 80 years of age and his wife only a few years her husband's junior. Mr. Andrew who now lives a retired life, came to this country with his wife from England, 54 years ago, and located at Barton, where he followed butchering and mining his last work being that of tax collector for his district. He served in the union army and has always been one of the most prominent men in his locality.\n\nThe children present yesterday were: Joseph, of Macon, Mo.; James of Westernport; George, William and Robert, Barton, Mrs. John W. Young, Mrs. Peter Wilson and Mrs. Emory Lewis, of Cumberland, and Mrs. William Somerville, of Barton. Mrs. Calvin Shockey, of McComas, whose husband is superintendent of a coal company, was unable to be present.\n\nPhotos taken when Joseph Mathew Andrews and family came for the anniversary celebration in 1906\n\nA Ride on Dan's Mountain\n\nNell, Joe, & Kate\n\nJoseph, Kate & Nell\n\nYoung Joe\n\nJoseph Andrews on Dan's Mountain\n\nHomes to the left of the tipple.\n\nPossibly a photo of Barton.

Mr. Andrews was born in Brintworth; Wilshire, England on June 6, 1827 and was therefore past 80 years of age. On September 3, 1849, Mr. Andrews was married to Elizabeth Jones of Pontey Parish, England both being residents of that parish. About 1853 Mr. and Mrs. Andrews came to this country and located in Frostburg, this county, remaining there three months, and then removing to Barton, where they have since continuously resided.\n\nMr. Andrews was on of Barton's pioneers, saw the little mining town steadily grow until it became one of the important coal shipping points in Western Maryland and be it said to his credit that the welfare of his adopted town and her citizenship were always uppermost in his thought. Not only had Mr. Andrews served Barton well but Allegany county itself had been the better for his having lived in it. About 1894 he became one of the county tax collectors and was prompt and efficient in the duties of the office. Mr. Andrews was an enthusiastic Republican in politics and in years gone by was frequently called into consultation by the leaders of his party who always welcomed his advice. Long years ago he identified himself with the Methodist Episcopal church at Barton and had been an active member. Ably seconded by his good and devoted wife his home has always been the meeting place for ministers and church workers.\n\nSince being confined to his bed and chair for the past few months his visitors, who have been many, have perhaps received more inspiration upon spiritual lines from his great confidence and trust in an all-wise God. than is often conveyed in a sermon most eloquently delivered.\n\nFro 53 years Mr. Andrews has been a valued member of the Barton Lodge, No. 94 IOOF, and has always been an active exponent of its \"Friendship, Truth and Love\" principles. Two weeks ago last Saturday Mr. Andrews was sufficiently strong to pose for a picture of himself and wife, Mrs. J. W. Young, his daughter, Jas. A. Young, grandchild and Master James Lloyd Young, great grandchild, the picture thus showing four generations.\n\nMr. Andrews is survived by his wife and the following children: Joseph Andrews, located in Macon City, Missouri; James, of Westernport; Mrs. Calvin Shockey of McComas, W. Va., and Mrs. Jno. W. Young, Mrs. Peter Wilson and Mrs. E M Lewis of this city, and Geo. W, W.H., Robert and Mrs. Wm. Somerville, of Barton, and by two sisters, who live in Newport England, and several grandchildren and about seven great Grandchildren.\n\nElizabeth ANDREWS Obituary\n\nThursday April 8, 1909\n\nMrs. Joseph Andrews of Barton died last night at 6:30 - age 79 Funeral services - Saturday 4/10 afternoon - interment Laurel Hill.\n\n8 Apr 1909 - Obit in Evening Times\n\nJoseph C in Macon MO\n\nWilliam, Robert & Florence in Barton\n\nSarah & Amanda in Cumberland\n\nJames in Piedmont\n\nSeemed to have missed Rhoda.\n\nGeorge & Mary Jane had already died."
