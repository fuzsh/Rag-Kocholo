        "text": "Sarah Fielding (born Nov. 8, 1710, East Stour, Dorset, Eng.—died April 9, 1768, Bath, Somerset) was an English author and translator whose novels were among the earliest in the English language and the first to examine the interior lives of women and children.\n\nFielding was the younger sister of the novelist Henry Fielding, whom many readers believed to be the author of novels she published anonymously, although he denied these speculations in print. She lived with her brother following the death of his wife in 1744. That year she published her first book, The Adventures of David Simple, a novel whose comic prose style imitated that of both her brother and his chief literary rival, Samuel Richardson, who was also one of her close friends. With the sequel, The Adventures of David Simple, Volume the Last: In Which His History Is Concluded (1753), she developed a style more distinctly her own, which shows greater intricacy of feeling, fuller development of character, and a reduced reliance on plot.\n\nThe Governess (1749) is didactic and portrays with comic sensibility the hazards of British social life for the moral development of women. Considered the first novel for girls in the English language, it was an immediate success and went through five editions in Fielding’s lifetime while inspiring numerous imitations."
