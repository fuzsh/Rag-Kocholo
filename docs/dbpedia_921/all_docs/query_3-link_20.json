        "text": "Read by John Telfer\n\nunabridged\n\nIn one of the first novels in the English language, we follow the picaresque adventures of Joseph Andrews, a virtuous young man who is keen to maintain his innocence, despite being coerced into bed by nearly every woman he encounters. The episodic journey sees him head home to London with his tutor, Parson Adams, with the aim of finding his sweetheart, Fanny. Much mayhem ensues along the way as they become embroiled in a series of escapades and slapstick brawls. Fielding is an expert satirist and through the many twists and turns of narration, he combines high and low literature with high and low humour to create a witty novel that he aptly named a ‘comic epic poem in prose’.\n\nRunning Time: 13 h 33 m\n\nDownload PDF booklet\n\nMore product details\n\nDigital ISBN:978-1-84379-895-8 Cat. no.:NA0200 Download size:208 MB BISAC:FIC004000 Released:April 2015\n\nListen to this title at Audible.de↗\n\nListen to this title at the Naxos Spoken Word Library↗\n\nDue to copyright, this title is not currently available in your region."
