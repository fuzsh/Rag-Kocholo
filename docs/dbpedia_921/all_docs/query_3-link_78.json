        "text": "Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews is often thought to have inaugurated a tradition of sociological observation in the novel, and it also cultivates a practice of judgment in readers. Yet the social theory that informs Fielding's novel (Thomas Hobbes, Bernard Mandeville) is dominated by a sense of inevitability, whereas judgment concerns the things that can be otherwise. A close reading of Joseph Andrews shows that Fielding does not deploy uncritically the methods and assumptions of a nascent social theory. Rather, he teaches us that those methods and assumptions hold only for the advent of a commercial modernity that renders judgment all but obsolete. Refusing the sentimental (Richardsonian) and aesthetic (Shaftes-burian) responses to this social theory as also complicit in the elision of judgment, Fielding works to transform the emerging novel into a narrative and aesthetic form capable of restoring our capacity for judgment.\n\nA smaller version of this paper was published as “Conversion: Ontological & Secular from Plato to Tom Jones”, Numero Cinq, V: 7, July 2014 and is posted elsewhere on Academia.edu. Its aim is to present some features of conversion as represented over about twenty-five hundred years in the pagan and Christian west in a way which may prove illumining because not expected. Rather than looking at conversion as primarily a religious phenomenon, though not leaving this out, I shall mainly present it as psychic, ontological, and secular. Moreover, although these three aspects can be seen together at almost every point, in order to bring out differences, I shall stress the psychological through Plato’s dialogues, the ontological through Neoplatonic – Peripatetic systems, and the secular through 18th and early 19th century novels of Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding and Jane Austen. The elements touched on from Plato and his Late Ancient and Medieval successors will largely be determined by what is modified or suppressed by our cast of English novelists. The major section on Jane Austen's novels is entitled \"Secularization Completed and the Beginnings of a Critique.\" They are not the loss of conversion in the Christian Platonist tradition but rather such a complete passage into the processes of social and individual life, i.e. secularization, that religious forms need not be represented along side them. Jane Austen is a modern Sophocles in his difference from Euripides and Aeschylus. Indeed, there is a sense in which her novels are the deepest treatments of conversion in the genre.\n\nDuring the 1700s, the English middle class secured economic and political dominance and began bidding for cultural dominance, evolving an ethic of gentility and an aesthetic of ‘naturalness.’ The “record of this process,” argues Nancy Armstrong, is “available in paperback. We call it fiction.” Lamenting that “nothing was well hung in [his] family,” Laurence Sterne’s Tristram interweaves “sense” and “nonsense,” person and text, to fabricate gentility. His character is inextricable from the very text that frets his genteel status with anxiety, tinging it with an eroticism at once veiled and omnipresent. The early 1700s defined a gentleman as “partaking in universal conversation”: “nobody in particular” and thus “an acceptable representative for everybody.” Disseminating this model, Daniel Defoe published The Compleat English Gentleman, and Joseph Addison wrote as Mr. Spectator, who lives “in the World, rather as a Spectator of Mankind, than as one of the Species,” ostensibly discerning “Errors in the Oeconomy, Business, and Diversion of others, better than those [. . .] engaged in them.” From such treatises, two related discourses emerged in the mid 1700s. First, narrative fictions multiplied the gentleman, distinctively middle-class by contrast to both profligate aristocrat and unsophisticated peasant, naturalizing this figure by asserting its “pre-existence in the natural order.” Second, writers distinguished the novel by contrast to tragedy, romance, and comic-burlesque. Prominent in both discourses: Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones and Sterne’s Tristram Shandy. Fielding grants the gentleman fallibility, redeeming his status by sensibility, especially by contrast to a villain who pretends to the gentility delineated by Addison and Defoe. Sterne mocks the stiff formalism of that conception and, like Fielding, grounds the genteel instead in sensibility. And both promote the genre they are fabricating—the novel—in terms very like those with which they define the gentleman."
