        "text": "Allowable shellfish (oysters, clams) harvesting areas are established and managed for public health purposes by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Aquaculture. Shellfish harvesting areas are opened and closed in accordance with the National Shellfish Sanitation Program Guidelines, and the open or closed status applies to both recreational and commercial harvest.\n\nAll harvest prohibited when shellfish harvesting areas are in the closed status as determined by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n\nYou may view maps of these areas and determine the open or closed status at: https://www.fdacs.gov/Agriculture-Industry/Aquaculture/Shellfish-Harvesting-Area-Classification or Shellfish Harvest Areas Map\n\nIf using the Shellfish Harvest Areas Map, be sure to click on your area below for daily status updates:\n\nWestern Gulf: from Pensacola Bay in Escambia County to East Bay in Bay County\n\nCentral Gulf: from St. Joseph Bay in Gulf County to Wakulla County\n\nBig Bend Gulf: from Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County to Citrus County\n\nSouthern Gulf: from Boca Ciega Bay in Pinellas County to Ten Thousand Islands in Collier County\n\nAtlantic Coast: from the Fort Pierce Inlet in St. Lucie County to the Tolomato River in St. Johns County\n\nFor additional information call 850-617-7600.\n\nCan oysters and barnacles be used as bait or chum for sheepshead?\n\nYes, so long as you are adhering to the regulations for each species.\n\nOysters and barnacles are very different when it comes to regulations.\n\nOysters have closed seasons, bag limits, size limits and can only be legally harvested in specific shellfish harvesting areas that are classified as \"approved\" or \"conditionally approved\" and in the \"open\" status. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Aquaculture manages these shellfish harvesting areas.\n\nBarnacles on the other hand do not have size limits or specified bag limits, which means that you can harvest up to 100 pounds per person per day with a recreational saltwater fishing license and you can use them to chum sheepshead. You can also simply scrape them off bridge piles and allow them to sink and attract sheepshead. Do not scrape barnacles from private docks or other private structures without permission of the property owner."
