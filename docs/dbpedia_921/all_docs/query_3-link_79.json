Houses constructed after about 1720 (Second Period homes) are generally distinguishable by symmetry, proportion and interior decoration. Most First Period houses were enlarged or modified to present this Second Period appearance.\n\nRead:\n\nUnited State Department of the Interior, First Period Buildings of Eastern Massachusetts\n\nUnited States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places, First Period Buildings of Eastern Massachusetts, Thematic Resource Nomination\n\nSummary abstracts of the structural history of a significant sampling of First Period Houses at Massachusetts Bay By Abbott Lowell Cummings (1967)\n\nThe Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay, 1625-1725 by Abbott Lowell Cummings\n\nStudy of First Period chamfers by Jim Krypianos\n\nFirst Period houses of the Massachusetts North Shore\n\nFollow the links below to the MACRIS site, where clicking on INV links to a PDF inventory sheet for each House, provided by town historical commissions in the 20th Century.

Most houses have dates based on historical records or tradition and have not been dated by dendrochronology.\n\nThis is a list of houses designated “First Period” by the MACRIS site, Abbott Lowell Cummings, and area historic organizations. Undesignated houses constructed geneally within the First Period are also shown. MACRIS information may not be current.\n\nMost houses have dates based on historical records or tradition and have not been dated by dendrochronology.\n\nAmesbury\n\nStephen Flanders House, 265 Elm St. Amesbury MA (c 1665)\n\nThis house has a marker with the date ‘1665’ prominently displayed on its facade. While such an ancient origin is not indicated by an examination of the exterior, deed records substantiate at least the ownership tradition. In 1650 a Steven Flanders was “admitted a townman on the condition that he “constantly keep the town herd of cows.”\n\nMorrill House, 1 Laurel Pl Amesbury MA c 1720\n\nThe original ownership of the house is unknown, but by 1854 it was owned by A. Morrill, and from at least 1872 through 1884 it was owned and occupied by Albert B. Gale, hatter. Possibly a First Period house, with uneven spacing of bays, one-room depth with a two-story rear lean-to, and flush eaves suggesting its early date.\n\nAME.483 Macy – Colby House, 257 Main St. Amesbury MA by 1745\n\nA house was constructed by Thomas Macy, probably about 1649, and sold to Anthony Colby in 1654. If any of the original house remains is questionable, and the present structure was extensively modified by Obadiah Colby in the early 1740s. Nine generations of Colby’s lived in this house. Thomas Macy was Amesbury’s first town clerk, held many town offices and was involved in numerous land transactions. He left Amesbury in 1659. Typical is the symmetrical three-bay facade, massive center chimney, and rear salt-box lean-to. Another ell, at right angles to the rear northeast corner, dates from the mid-nineteenth century. The room interior has a huge fireplace with brick ovens in the keeping and four smaller fireplaces in the parlor, bedrooms and loom room.\n\nThe Ferry District was one of Amesbury’s earliest settlements, dating from the 17th century. The house bears a plaque reading, Theophilus Foot, 1692, while another source refers to the house as the Blaisdell-Woodman house. A violent tornado occurred August 14, 1773, doing particular damage in the Ferry District, and blowing down “Theophilus Foot’s new house.” By 1854 the property was owned and occupied by Elliot D. Stone, agent, and later his widow.\n\nAME.276 Isaac Morrill House, 48 Portsmouth Rd. Amesbury MA c 1680\n\nIsaac Morrill was the eldest son of seven children of Abraham Morrill. The elder Morrill was one of the area’s first settlers, operating a corn mill and farm and working as a blacksmith. Upon his death in 1662, he left his son Isaac a “new house and 56 acres.” The main house is one bay deep, and a two-story lean-to extends to the rear.\n\nAndover\n\nANV.17 Benjamin Abbot House, 9 Andover St. Andover MA c 1685\n\nOne of the two oldest houses in Andover MA, the Benjamin Abbot House has been lived in since it was built. Benjamin Abbot (1661-1703) was the 8th child of George, an original grantee. In 1685, Benjamin, a carpenter by trade, built his home on the banks of the Shawsheen River. The farm was originally 75 acres. In May, 1692, his neighbor, Martha Allen Carrier was arrested for witchcraft, Benjamin Abbot having named her the cause of his foot swelling and open sore on his side. The house remained in the Abbot family through eight generations, until 1933. Source.\n\nANV.45 Abbot – Baker House, 5 Argilla Rd. Andover MA c 1685\n\nThomas Abbot bought 1662 land “Westerly side of Shawsheen, Northerly side of the road together with The Mansion House and barn in together with the same with tan house and tan fats and all buildings. “from Job Tyler, whom the original Andover proprietors found occupying it. This house, along with the Benjamin Abbot and Ballard-Foster houses, are situated in what was once known as “Happy Hollow”. In 1900, George F Baker, road commissioner who lived here, named the street for his ancestral one at Ipswich; Argilla Road from the Latin for clay. The house is said to contain an early room (kitchen) older than any in the Benjamin Abbot house, dating from 1671. There is the huge central chimney of First Period architecture, this one built on a large rock of hand made brick chimney; 5 fireplaces; wainscotting throughout the house and H&L hinges. Some of the walls are insulated with birch bark and one room has a brick exterior wall, protection against Indian attack.\n\nANV.128 Foster Homestead, 96 Central St. Andover MA c 1720\n\nA complex house of three major periods, the Foster House contains a two story First Period core of three bays with irregular fenestration on the east side, now without the chimney at the south end. About 1750 there was a one room, two story addition of a reused frame. To its north was added a larger two story central chimney house, (c.1790-1800). The only remaining First Period evidence is the frame of the core structure, traditionally dated c. 1660 but with deeds back to 1635. The frame is quirk-beaded on all exposed timbers, and thus must be dated to the early 18th century (perhaps c. 1720). There are three bays in this section, divided on both floors by an exposed quirk-beaded tie beam. Thus the first floor summer beam is transverse although it appears as longitudinal in relation to the later fireplace. The present modern kitchen probably occupies what was once the original chimney bay.\n\nANV.300 Chandler – Abbot House, 88 Lowell St. Andover MA c 1670\n\nThis is believed to be the oldest First Period home still standing in Andover today. The interior rooms on the south facing side on both levels contain huge hand hewn summer beams with chamfered edges and gun-stock post corner beams. Many of the interior wall sheathing are covered with horizontal tongue and grooved or ship-lap wide pine board paneling. The kitchen fireplace is nearly 7′ wide x 5′ high and 42″ deep. The original chimney was removed at some point in the early twentieth century and rebuilt in the early 1960s. The floors are all wide pine boards measuring 12″ to 22″ in width throughout the house. Thomas Chandler was born about 1627, the oldest of five children of William & Annis Chandler of Roxbury, MA. William was a tanner in Roxbury by 1637 and owned an estate of 22 acres. William dies of consumption Feb. 26, 1641 and their mother Annis remarries on July 2, 1643 to John Dane (Dean) of Berkhamstead & Bishop-Stratford England. John had first settled in Ipswich and later to Roxbury. Thomas Chandler’s other siblings were, Hannah, William, John and Sarah. Thomas and his brother William were among some of the most influential men of Andover’s first settlers after the town incorporated in 1646. Continue reading.\n\nANV.420 Blanchard – Upton, 62 Osgood St. Andover MA c 1720\n\nThomas, third son of Samuel and Hannah Blanchard was given this property at the time of his marriage to Rose Holmes, 1699, probably at the same time they gave land at 116 Osgood St. to his sister, Hannah, who married Stephen Osgood the same spring. In its First Period frame, and distinctive type of construction, the Blanchard/Upton house is significant under Criterion C. It is an outstanding example of a well restored classic early 18th century saltbox. The frame is integral throughout, with quirked beading typical of several early 18th century Andover houses. (It was built between the time Thomas Blanchard acquired the land in 1699 and his death by 1740 when his son, Josiah, inherited the farm.) It is thus an excellent example of the integral lean-to roof and plan, with the variant of the upper lean-to extending only some two thirds along the rear and extended at the first floor by one story sheds. The feather-edged sheathing suggests a c. 1730 date, although the house may have been built earlier (c. 1700-1720) and the present interior finish added c. 1730-40 when Josiah Blanchard inherited the property. The frame of the house is quirk-beaded and exposed throughout, with longitudinal summers on the two main first floor rooms and transverse tie beams in the rooms above. There is clear evidence in the cantilevered ties in the east end lean-to that the roof line and rafters are integral. The roof is a typical principal rafter with ridge-pole and purlin system.\n\nANV.547 Abbot – Stinson House, 6 Stinson Rd. Andover MA c 1725\n\nThe Abbott-Stinson house is traditionally dated c.1720-1726. This is consistent with the quirk-beaded frame seen throughout the west side, which was probably the kitchen and kitchen chamber. These elements are similar to the frame of the Parson Barnard House in North Andover (c.1715) and several other early 18th century houses in Andover. It is an excellent example of the transition from First Period exposed, decorated framing to the vernacular Georgian interior finish of the second quarter of the 18th century. The west rooms have exposed summer and tie beams, in the normal longitudinal and transverse directions respectively, both with quirked beads running to the ends without stops. The posts, girts, and plates are also quirk-beaded where exposed. The second floor west side has flared gunstock corner posts.\n\nBeverly\n\nBEV.184 Hazadiah Smith House, 337 Cabot St. Beverly MA 1686\n\nThe Hazadiah Smith House, is a two-and-a-half story, five-bay clapboarded building, two rooms deep with a central chimney plan. The original First-Period House, was a double-cell, central chimney structure; the later addition of rear rooms and new roof has left the central, chimney stack protruding through the front slope below the ridge of the present roof. Hazadiah Smith who moved to Beverly c. 1675 and acquired the parcel of land containing the present house in 1636, was called a “carpenter.”\n\nBEV.185 John Balch House, 448 Cabot St. Beverly MA 1636\n\nJohn Balch was born in 1579 in Bridgewater, England and came to America with Captain Gorges in September 1623, settling with the Dorchester Company at Cape Ann. In 1626 he removed to Salem, Massachusetts with Governor Roger Conant. On January 25, 1635, he was granted, along with Capt William Trask, John Woodbury, Roger Conant, and Peter Palfrey one thousand acres of land at the head of Bass River. When Beverly separated from Salem in 1668 this grant came within the bounds of the new town. He was one of the founders of the Salem Church in 1629 and was among the first to be made freeman in 1631; he was one of the first selectman of Salem and served in other capacities. His home is the only one of the “Old Planters” standing today.\n\nBEV.446 Exercise Conant House, 634 Cabot St. Beverly MA c 1695\n\nExercise Conant sold a house and barn on this land to his cousin John Conant, who sold the house in 1715 to Reverend John Chipman, who built the present house to accommodate his parish duties and his growing family of fifteen children. The Exercise Conant House is the First Period, northern ell of the two-and-a-half story, five-bay Georgian house built by the Reverend John Chipman House, which has a dentilled cornice and an original fine Second-Period, central doorway with fluted pilasters and a broken-arch pediment with pineapple finial in the center. The First Period Conant ell is a single-cell, two-and-a-half story structure, three bays wide, possibly originally oriented north, with chimney to the left. The large chimney stack pierces the roof ridge of the ell at its juncture with the main house and is barely visible rising behind the far right ridge of the roof of the main facade. The roof ridge of the First Period ell, which is 40 degrees in pitch, runs perpendicular to the ridge of the main house. The northern ell of the present structure contains late seventeenth century detailing which identifies it as the single-cell Exercise Conant House reduced to an ell by Reverend John Chipman after 1715. The single room measures 12′ x 19″6″ with an 8′ first floor ceiling.\n\nBEV.445 Beverly Grammar School 50 Essex St. Beverly MA c 1716\n\n50 Essex Street is a small 1 1/2-story cottage, the interior framing of which discloses two bays thought to represent the moved frame of a First Period Beverly schoolhouse. The building today is a four-bay structure with a doorway flanked by two windows to the left and one to the right. The gable end has a single window at the main floor and attic levels. There is a late 19th-century stove chimney in the middle of the later pitched roof. The main room is 21′ wide by 17′ deep, with a frame of either oak or hard pine. The summer tie is quirk-beaded. The two end girts have simple narrow flat chamfers with tapered stops. The corner posts are similarly decorated. Joist spacing is 24″ on centers, and the joists apparently employ the older tusk tenon. The original left front corner post. by the door, has a molded post head. The east room is a later addition, and the original girt separating it from the main room has chamfers only on the inside, since the other originally faced the exterior wall. The split laths of the later, (18th-century?) addition have childrens’ drawings as graffiti, and are said to have been the original pupils1 desks of-the early school.\n\nBEV.87 William Cleaves House, 252 Essex St. Beverly MA 1675\n\nThe original part of this house was erected in 1675 for William Cleaves and has been enlarged with additions and ells.\n\nBEV.195 William Livermore House, 271 Essex St. Beverly MA c 1700\n\nThis house is associated with Livermore Whittredge Sr. and Jr, who were members of the Committee of Correspondence and active privateers during the Revolutionary War. The William Livermore house began as a late First-Period two-and-a-half story, single-cell house to the right of the chimney. A single-cell, two-and-a-half story addition to the left of the chimney early in the Second-Period produced a two-room, central chimney plan. The house was later doubled in size with the addition of a rear file of rooms and a new roof. Consequently, the central chimney stack protrudes through the front slope of the new roof. The original single-cell end of the house is sheathed in vertical boards, while the new addition has horizontal sheathing. The right front rooms of the house exhibit good late First Period features.The second-phase rooms to the left, stairway, and the first-phase right chamber exhibit good early second period details, suggesting a circa 1725-30 construction date for the addition.\n\nBEV.108 Rev. John Hale House, 39 Hale St. Beverly MA 1694\n\nRev. John Hale graduated from Harvard in 1657 and an 1660 became minister at the First Parish Church in Bass River Side of Salem which became Beverly. in 1668. In 1690 he went on the expedition to Canada as Chaplain. In 1692 he, in common with other area ministers, acted as a judge in the Witchcraft Trials. However in October 1692, his pious wife Sarah was accused and remained in jail until just before the birth of their son John who was born Dec. 2, 1692. “The whole community was convinced that the accusers, in crying out upon Mrs. Hale, had perjured themselves the awful delusion ceased.” In 1697, Rev. Hale wrote a work entitled “A Modest Inquiry into the nature of Witchcraft ” in which he asked for pardon “all the errors of his people in the day of darkness.” The next owner Robert Hale, son of John, was an eminent doctor, graduating from Harvard in 1666. His son Robert became the owner of the house in 1719 and served the town and country in its early days. He was commissioned a Colonel and commanded a regiment in the expedition against Louisburg in 1745. In 1755 he was commissioned by Governor Shirley as agent to New Hampshire for an expedition against the French at Crown Point.\n\nBEV.1020, 141 Hale St. Beverly MA c 1712\n\nThis prominent Hale Street house was built in 1712 for Samuel Woodbury, and has been thoughtfully updated while maintaining original features.\n\nBEV.202 John Thorndike House, 184 Hale St. Beverly MA 1702\n\nThe house is associated after 1760 with Captain Joseph Rea, grandson of the original owner, and a prominent militia captain, member of the Committee of Correspondence and Safety. The original single cell 2 1/2 story house with integral lean-to received a single cell 2 1/2 story addition to the left of the chimney late in the First-Period. In the nineteenth or twentieth century, part of the lean-to roof was raised to a shed dormer, and a small two-story gabled ell extended from the right rear.\n\nBEV.199, John Patch House, 245 Hale St. Beverly MA c 1694\n\nJohn Patch was the son of Elizabeth Brackenberry Patch who was the first born English female child of Massachusetts Bay Colony. She was the daughter of Richard Brackenberry who came over on the Abigail with Gov. Endicott in 1628.\n\nBEV.219, Jeffrey Thissel House, 574 Hale St. Beverly MA c 1668\n\nThis house was built c. 1668 for Jeffery Thissel, planter.\n\nBEV.495, William Haskell House, 680 Hale St. Beverly MA c 1688\n\nThis house may have been built in the late 17th century by William Haskell, a mariner who married Ruth, the daughter of Thomas West; her dowry was property, a portion of the 300 acres West inherited from his father John West. who had acquired the land in 1660 from John Blackleach, the original grantee in Beverly Farms (1638)Haskell was from Bristol, England, and had emigrated with two of his brothers; he died in 1694. Some researchers believe the house was built and an orchard planted on the property between 1688 and that date. Ruth then married John Smith; she died before 1701. Before 1708 a sawmill was built next to the house on the brook, known then as Sawmill Brook. Robert Haskell lived in the house after 1712, and others believe he built the house, since no buildings were mentioned in papers of William Haskell’s estate. Six generations of William Haskells lived in this house; they were there until the early 19th century.\n\nBEV.499, Robert Woodberry House, 824 Hale St. Beverly MA c 1700\n\nDeed research has led to a 1699-1707 date for this house, believed to have been built by Robert Woodberry after his marriage to Mary West. daughter of Thomas West. who had inherited 300 acres of Beverly Farms land from his father. Land on which the house stands was Mary’s dowry. John West. father of Thomas, had bought the land in the 1660’s from John Blackleach, the original grantee, who moved to Boston.\n\nBEV.444 Samuel Corning, House, 87 Hull St. Beverly MA c 1700\n\nThe Samuel Corning House exhibits frames of two successive periods, a transverse first floor summer beam supported by molded post heads and story posts, and an overhanging second story. Its frame is decorated with flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops on the 9.5″-wide transverse summer and tie beams. The summers are supported by posts with decorative molded heads. The ties are supported with posts which angle out from the framed overhang within a few inches of the floor. In the entry, the front girt is chamfered with a bevel terminating in a triangular stop. The frame of the ca. 1720 addition is quirk-beaded, and its first floor summer is longitudinal. The roof is the principal and purlin system, at a 45 degree pitch, of pine, and without collars.\n\nBEV.183 William Dodge House, 10-12 Lyman St. Beverly MA 1723\n\nWilliam Dodge, planter, came from England aboard the Lion’s Whelp and arrived in Salem June 29, 1629. He received his first grant of land in 1636 and bought 200 acres on Basse River Side from Peter Palfrey in 1644. That he had a house here is born out by Town Records in 1647. It passed by deed in 1685.\n\nBILLERICA\n\nBIL.173, Dea. Samuel Hill House, 33 Riverhurst Rd. Billerica MA c 1725\n\nThis house was probably built by Deacon Samuel Hill, who inherited the farm from Ralph Hill Jr. in 1695 and died in 1755. It exhibits late First Period transitional beaded summer beams and some horizontal interior sheathing. The first floor rooms both have exposed longitudinal summer beams with quirk beading. All other framing members are boxed. Brick nogging survives in both end walls and the original rear wall. A.L. Cummings found blackened joists in the first and second floor right-hand rooms indicating originally unplastered ceilings. The second floor right-hand chamber also has an exposed, quirk beaded longitudinal summer beam. The chamber has a sawmill-sawn rising brace in the right rear corner, and evidence of another in the left hand corner. The front, rear, and end walls have horizontal sheathing. The left-hand second floor chamber has very fine 18th century marbleized raised-field paneling to the right of the present chimney (original rear wall,) a distinctive and rare survival of a popular 18th century style of painted decoration. The section consists of nine raised-field panels set in three ranks, with marbleizing in both panels and the rails and stiles.\n\nBOSTON\n\nBOS.5804, James Blake House, 735 Columbia Rd. Boston MA 1661\n\nThe Elder James Blake House is a 2 1/2-story, one room deep, Hall & Parlor House of the Post Medieval, First Period style. Dendrochronological testing in 2007 revealed the house was built in 1661. The Blake House is considered Boston’s Oldest House, a Boston City landmark, and a rare example of West County English framing from the early settlement period. The New England oak timber for the Blake House frame was felled in the Winter of 1660-1661, and in the Spring of 1661, shortly after the English Restoration occurred in 1660. The Blake family that first lived in the house is thought to have been Elder James Blake, and his wife Elizabeth Clap(p), a niece of Dorchester pioneer settler Roger Clap(p) who crossed on the ship Mary & John in 1630. The Clap(p)s and most early Dorchester families were from the West Country of England, then a farming, fishing, salt-producing and tide-milling part of England. They were inspired by Rev. John White, known in England as the “Founder of Massachusetts” who preached in Dorset, Dorchester, England, for which Dorchester, Massachusetts was named.\n\nBOS.5388, Paul Revere House, 19 North Sq. Boston MA c 1680\n\nThe oldest portion of the Paul Revere house was built, probably by John Jeffs, to fit into the small irregularly shaped lot. The house was the home of a leading Revolutionary patriot, Paul Revere, from 1770-1S00. The facade of the five-bay house has an overhang supported by the three main crosswise timbers the chimney girt and two summers. In 1907, the Paul Revere Memorial Association purchased the house and extensively restored and reconstructed the structure under the direction of Joseph Everett Chandler, architect. Maintained in excellent condition, the house is open to visitors.\n\nBOS.6136, Pierce House, 24 Oakton Ave, Boston MA 1683\n\nThe Pierce House is one of the last surviving examples of seventeenth-century architecture in the city of Boston. Lived in by ten generations of one family, the house documents the building practices and tastes of the Pierces over three centuries.\n\nBOXFORD\n\nBOX.64 Sawyer House, 21 Endicott Rd. Boxford MA c 1715\n\nThe house was apparently built on land formerly part of the Gov. Endicott grant of the 17th century. Although Sidney Perley assigns the date of first construction to Stephen Gould ca. 1750, the Sawyer House may have been built in the first quarter of the 18th century as a single-cell house that was enlarged to a 5-bay, central chimney, lobby-entrance, two-story, double-cell structure, as the principal rafters show evidence of collars on only the left side for the principal and purlin system. The right side appears to be the earliest core of the much-enlarged house. The early exposed frame of the east main rooms is clearly of the first decades of the 18th century, and the width of the framing and the proportions of the west rooms suggest a similar or slightly later construction date for that section. The rooms at both stories to the right of the lobby entrance and stairs show clear evidence of First Period framing.\n\nBOX.22 John Boardman House, 28 Lawrence Rd. Boxford MA 1730\n\nThe John Boardman House is a First Period house at 28 Lawrence Road in Boxford. The main portion of the 2.5 story saltbox colonial was built as a double cell plan central chimney structure c. 1740 in Saugus. It underwent restoration by Earl Newton and was moved to its present location in 1956. The house is somewhat similar in appearance to the William Boardman house which is still in Saugus. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBOX.61 Phineas Foster, 15 Old Topsfield MA Rd. Boxford MA c 1725\n\nPerley wrote that this house was owned by Solomon Gould after 1765; Phineas Foster in 1799. The main house seems to have begun as a single cell plan in the right-hand (east) half, including the chimney bay, although much of the interior framing in this section is boxed. It then grew to a double cell plan in the late First Period, with a later 18th-century summer-kitchen ell addition. The one-story porch entry is, perhaps, Federal. The central chimney is rebuilt. The three earlier bays have multiple purlins of smaller scantling; the two later bays only three purlins. The older section shows dovetail mortise evidence of having had collars between the rafters; the later section does not.\n\nBOX.19 Isaac Adams House, 161 Spofford Rd. Boxford MA 1702\n\nHistoric Name: Adams, Capt. Isaac House Common Name: Whitney, James Clement House Year Constructed: 1702 Architectural Styles: First Period; Georgian Foundation: Random Laid Rubble; Stone.\n\nBURLINGTON\n\nBUR.3, Francis Wyman House, 56 Francis Wyman Rd. Burlington MA c 1666\n\nThe Francis Wyman House remained in one old New England family’s (the Wymans) possession for the better part of over 330 years. It has a 3-bay front, with its main or front door in the middle of the south façade. With its large central brick chimney, wood cedar shingle roof, hand-planed quartersawn clapboards, 4-square room plan, the Wyman House presents most strongly as a ca. 1730 early Georgian Style colonial house. However, portions of the structure may date to ca. 1666 when it appears an earlier saltbox-style house was located here. The Francis Wyman House is also distinguished for its ca. 1730 hand-hewn frame (which included pit-sawn floor joists beneath the west half of the kitchen—a few removed for museum exhibit purposes in 2011), some early gunstock posts, a puncheon style stair in the basement, feather-edged vertical board walls, and wide pine floors. Major portions of the house were rebuilt, restored, and adapted for new museum use first after the Francis Wyman Association took title to the property between 1899 and 1902—and later following a November 1996 fire.\n\nCONCORD\n\nCON.158, Fletcher – Cuming House, 383 Cambridge Tpk, Concord MA c 1691\n\nPortions of this building may be among the oldest structures in Concord is known to have existed on the site as early as 1691. Some of it was definitely standing by 1724, and thus has the heavy framing of the late First Period. The present form and exterior of the main house, however, are largely Georgian or “Second Period” in their appearance. It has a central chimney, and a symmetrical five-bay facade.\n\nCON.156, Fox House, 455 Cambridge Tpk, Concord MA c 1711\n\nThis house, its earliest section probably built shortly before 1711, stands on a portion of the large farm of Thomas Fox, one of Concord’s original settlers, who owned a considerable part of the East Quarter. His son, Eliphalet Fox (d. 1711,) a Selectman in 1689, married Mary Wheeler in 1665, and later Mary Stone Hunt. The latter’s first husband had been Isaac Hunt.\n\nCON.309, Dane, Thomas House, 47 Lexington Rd, Concord MA: c 1650\n\nThe house may have started out as a three-bay “half-house”, and lengthened to the present six bays in the eighteenth century. The three windows at both stories on the east end of the facade, 6-over-9 sash at the second and 12-over-12-sash at the first. have the projecting frames and, at the first story, the heavy, molded crowns, that are characteristic of the decades from ca. 1740 through 1820.\n\nCON.337, Concord Old Block House, 57 Lowell Rd. Concord MA c 1675\n\nIt is a long-held belief that part of this house, probably the one-room section at the north end that was “the Old Block House,” is Concord’s oldest building. The name comes from its designation as a garrison house, (or place of refuge for colonists in the event of Indian attack), during King Philip’s War of 1675-76. The actual date of its construction, however, is the subject of some speculation. According to some sources, the block house, which originally stood back from today’s Main Street just northeast of the South Burying Ground, had originally been the home of one of Concord’s two founding ministers, the Rev. John Jones, and could thus date to the days of Concord’s first English settlement in 1635-36.\n\nCON.269, Joseph Hosmer House, 572 Main St, Concord MA c 1672\n\nThe Joseph Hosmer House is a five bay central chimney clapboarded structure, two and one half stories high with an eastern latitudinal ell. The core of the structure is a First Period house. The chamfers are different in the eastern and western sides of the house—quarter round and beveled respectively. The east ell was originally a three bay, two story gambrel roof structure, most likely built during the first half of the eighteenth century.\n\nCON.180, Benoni and Thomas Fox House, 472-474 Old Bedford Rd. Concord MA c 1711\n\nIn the eighteenth century this house remained in the possession of the Fox family for several generations, and was standing by 1711 on the large farm of the late Eliphalet Fox, son of seventeenth-century settler Thomas Fox, who had owned an extensive amount of land in the East Quarter where the Old Billerica Road (there was no Bedford then) turned east.\n\nCON.181, Samuel Fox House, 505 Old Bedford Rd. Concord MA c 1702\n\nLike #472, the main part of the house is one-room deep, but its extremely long dimensions suggest that it may have grown from a “single-cell,” or one-room wide, half-house at some time early in its history. Although its frame is undoubtedly of heavy First Period construction, its main aspect today is in the vernacular Georgian, or “Second Period” style of the mid-1700’s.\n\nCON.417, Parkman Tavern, 20 Powder Mill Rd. Concord MA 1659\n\nThis house shows elements of very early 18th century or late 17th century construction. It would seem to have been first a one room deep house, enlarged in the third quarter of the 18th century to its present four-square center chimney proportions. It retain much woodwork from the earliest period, and some up to 1820. In 1771 William Parkman bought the house and operated it as a drover’s tavern.\n\nCON.117, Edward Bulkeley House, 92 Sudbury Rd, Concord MA c 1683\n\nThis house is said to have been standing on the north side of Main Street by 1660; if that is the case, it would be one of Concord’s very earliest First Period houses. A deed referring to the property, with a dwelling on it, records the 1663 transfer of 10 acres of land located on today’s Main Street to Edward Bulkeley by his mother, widow of one of Concord’s founders and its first minister, Peter Bulkeley. Edward Bulkeley followed in his father’s footsteps to become the second minister of the town. He died in 1694, whereupon the property was sold to Jonathan Prescott, a doctor and blacksmith. It remained in the Prescott family for well over a hundred years.\n\nCON.118, Scotchford – Wheeler House, 99 Sudbury Rd. Concord MA c 1699\n\nPart of this house was built after John Scotchford who as an original settler of “Concord Plantation” received his deed of land before 1653. He served as Town Clerk for 11 years, from 1668 to 1679. In January 1696 John and Susanna Scotchford sold their house and barn with six acres of land, along with another lot near Nine Acre Corner, to Deacon Edward Wheeler (1669-1734). The homestead remained in the Wheeler family for over two hundred years. Although traditionally part of the house dates to 1655, the structure probably dates to the time of Deacon Wheeler’s purchase.\n\nCON.177, Wheeler – Minot Farmhouse, 341 Virginia Rd. Concord MA c 1730\n\nOnce reputed to be one of the oldest houses in Concord, it is certainly possible that this building contains at least a portion of a seventeenth-century house. Its outer form as seen today and recorded over the years, however, is consistent with a date in the 1720’s-1730’s. It is a 2 1/2-story, five-bay, one-room-deep house. It was formerly a “saltbox,” with a low rear lean-to and a “jog” on the east end. Cynthia and John lived in the house for a year and a half, and it was here that their son, Henry David Thoreau, was born in 1817. Although he only lived on Virginia Road as a baby, Henry Thoreau had much fondness for this part of town, occasionally walking and picking blueberries here, and mentioning it and its inhabitants frequently in his works. His Journals also recount his mother’s recollections of the farm.\n\nCON.444, Melvin John – Melvin William House, 344 Westford Rd. Concord MA c 1705\n\nThis house has a slight overhang of the attic story at the gable ends, an architectural treatment that was largely discontinued by 1710. The most likely to have built the earliest sections of this house is John himself, with it passing after his death to his son David Melvin, who married Mary Farrar. Both David and his brother Eleazer were involved in the Indian wars of the eighteenth century, David eventually as Captain. Both took part in Capt. Lovewell’s raid into Indian territory in 1725, and were at the assault on Louisburg in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during the French and Indian War.\n\nDANVERS\n\nDAN.179 Rea – Proctor Homestead, 180 Conant St. Danvers MA c 1692\n\nThe house was built on 150 acres of upland in Salem Village along the “country road” or “olde Ipswich roade” which was purchased in 1656 by Joshua Rea, Sr. It was probably erected about 1692 during the witchcraft trials, in which Joshua Rea, Jr., gave testimony for accused witch, John Proctor. In August. 1693, the property was transferred by gift to John Rea, Son of Joshua, Sr., and remained the homestead of the Rea family until 1803. It was sold it in 1804 to Timothy Pickering, the first Secretary of war in 1795, and the second Secretary of State from 1795 to 1800. During his ownership from 1804 to 1806, he pioneered techniques of scientific agriculture.\n\nDAN.104 Rea – Putnam – Fowler House, 4 Elerton Ln Danvers MA c 1700\n\nOriginally a half house with integral lean-to built c. 1700, the house was enlarged by the addition of the east rooms, again with integral lean-to. The facade is marked by a one story pilastered entrance porch of 18th or 19th century construction date, and by a plaster cove cornice at the eave.The slim central chimney is a 19th century replacement of the original. The house was built by Joshua Rea, farmer, c.1700. The extension of the house by a second cell with integral lean-to is typical of evolutionary development of houses in the study area, while the use of pine, rather than oak, for the later frame reflects the acceptance of pine as a suitable wood for framing in the early 18th century.\n\nDAN.116 Porter – Bradstreet House, 487 Locust St. Danvers MA c 1700\n\nThe tract of land on which the house was built was the 500 acres granted in 1638 to Emanuel Downing by the town of Salem. In 1650 Mr. Downing conveyed it to John Porter of Salem MA, yeoman, (d. 1676) who at one time was the largest land owner in Salem Village. When his son Joseph (1638-1714) married Anna, daughter of Major William Hathorne in 1664, the land was conveyed to Joseph by his father as a marriage portion. Traditionally, this Joseph Porter erected the house in 1650. The posts and beams are of white oak. The present appearance is Georgian (after 1720), but Abbot Lowell Cummings estimated that the oldest part, which is closest to the road, could have been constructed circa 1700, based on a bridled scarf joint on the rear plate.\n\nDAN.245 Prince – Osborne House, 273 Maple St. Danvers MA c 1700\n\nThe previous site of the house was part of the farm owned in the late 17th century by Robert Prince who left it to his two sons in trust to his wife Sarah. Sarah, who eventually married her indentured servant, Alexander Osborne, was accused as a witch and died in prison in 1692. Prince’s estate was disputed between Prince and Osborne heirs until 1720. Eldest son James Prince received a partial settlement in 1696 which included a house, however. It is difficult to pinpoint the construction date from available physical evidence, but it is likely that the left hand rooms, if original to the site, were constructed by c. 1690. First Period framing of different character in the left and right portions of the house is visible in all four front rooms and lobby. The presence of rising brace mortises in the left chimney girt and post is the chief reason to believe that the chimney bay was part of the right hand entity, perhaps at one time a single cell structure (rebuilding in the attic and cellar has obliterated evidence of the house’s growth typically found in those locations). In the left hand room, believed to be the earlier side, the longitudinal summer beam is 12 inches wide and has 1 1/2 inch flat chamfers and triangular curved stops.\n\nDAN.70 White – Preston House, 592 Maple St. Danvers MA c 1722\n\nThe land on which the house sits was part of a lot of land conveyed to Peter Prescott, planter, of Salem MA, prior to 1678. Prescott built a house on his property, but it was apparently gone by 1722 when Thomas Cummings, weaver, sold the land. The next owner of the land was Samuel White who may have built the house during the 1720’s for his occupancy. White was the son of Josiah and Remember (Reed) White. The original portion of the house exhibits “gunstock” posts, chamfered beams, and evidence of white wash. The front half of the house is comprised of the original single cell building on the right and the rooms added still in the First Period to the left of the chimney bay to give the house a nearly symmetrical plan. The house achieved its present form (except for the sun porch built c. 1917) in the mid-19th century when a second file of rooms was built at the rear (or possibly an original lean-to was enlarged upward). At that time the front wall was extended upward to give the building more vertical proportions. The roof was rebuilt with broad eaves and returns, and the building was given its late Greek revival vernacular appearance. The two chimneys which pierce the ridge of the gable roof serve fireplaces at the rear of the front rooms. The central chimney of the original building was removed earlier, allowing the construction of a straight-run staircase.\n\nRebecca Nurse Homestead, 149 Pine St. Danvers MA, 1700\n\nThe house is believed built circa 1700 as a two-story First Period structure. Sections may date to an earlier “mansion house” built in the 1630’s for Townsend Bishop. A lean-to with kitchen was added around 1720. Rebecca Nurse, convicted and executed in the Salem Witch Trials, was the best-known resident. The Putnam family inherited the property in 1784, and remained residents until 1908. In 1981 it was transferred to the Danvers Alarm List Company, an organization for the reenactment of period history.\n\nDAN.71 Guilford House, 23 Nichols St. Danvers MA c 1750\n\nThe Guilford house appears to be a first-period structure with an oak frame, including “gunstock” posts and whitewashed chamfered beams, evident under the present finish. The original house is approximately 24 feet wide by one room-length deep. The saltbox rear and the two-story addition to the west are of more recent date. Family accounts mention that a portion of the present house was moved from the Bradstreet-Porter farm in Putnamville. It would seem possible that in around 1820, Guilford bought this property and moved an older structure here, but just what possible structure it originally was, cannot be ascertained. Levi Gulford (Guilford) was baptized October 30, 1768, married Sarah Marston in January 1797, and was residing in Danvers in 1807.\n\nDAN.77 James Putnam House, 42 Summer St. Danvers MA c 1715\n\nThe James Putnam Jr. House is a First Period 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a gambrel roof pierced by two interior chimneys. The house was built in stages, beginning in about 1715 with two stories, two rooms wide and one deep. To this another structure was added to the front, creating an early Federal style central hall structure. Colonel Timothy Pickering, who leased the house from 1802 to 1804, when he was serving as United States Senator. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.James Putnam had been taught a trade and he in his turn taught his soul the same trade that of bricklayer, and deeded to his son James Putnam junior bricklayer land in Danvers In 1721.\n\nESSEX\n\nESS.42 Brown-Cleveland House, 23 Belcher St. Essex MA 1713\n\nThe Brown-Cleveland House is a 1 1/2 story central chimney house, added to on the North and East sides. Deeds and newspaper articles show the house to have been built about 1713. Carved, exposed wooden frame, with beaded chamfers typical of the period 1710-1725 are featured throughout the house. The 3″ x 4″ joists at 24″ centers, hand split lath, hair clam shell plaster, hand wrought nails and lapped exterior sheathing are typical of the period\n\nESS.1 George Giddings House, 66 Choate St. Essex MA 1690\n\nOne of the oldest houses in the County, and with rare plank construction. Birthplace of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s grandmother. Both the house and the barn are estimated to have been built in the 1690’s. The house was originally built as a single two story structure with a large chimney on one side, which was then widened with the addition on the other side of the chimney. In the 19th century the central chimney was removed, the entry of the house was reoriented from south to north by the addition of a new central door on the north face, The property has a rare First Period barn and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n109 Eastern Ave, the Burnham House, Essex MA c 1690\n\nThe date of erection for this house is based upon the character of style and construction which reveals that the left-hand portion of “half-house” plan with integral lean-to is the earlier, built probably between 1685 and 1695. The right-hand unit with rooms at the front and rear was added apparently toward the end of the first quarter of the eighteenth century. The rear lean-to wall was then or subsequently raised to a full two stories and the entire structure was re-roofed, wholly or in part. Converted in the 1960’s to a restaurant, the original building has been considerably enlarged. (Description by Abbot Lowell Cummings)\n\nESS.79 Choate House, Hog Island Essex MA c 1730\n\nThe Choate House, a property of The Trustees of Reservations, is part of the Cornelius and Mine S. Crane Wildlife Refuge, some 700 acres donated in 1974 by Mrs. Mine S. Crane. The property includes Hog (Choate) Island, Round Island, Long Island, Deans Island and Dilley Island as well as surrounding salt marsh. John Choate was born in Groton, Boxford, Colchester, England and came to America in 1643 at the age of nineteen. By 1667 he and his wife had begun buying property and built a small farm on the island between the Ipswich mainland and Crane Neck. In 1725 Thomas Choate built his homestead, and a few years later he built the present Choate House for his son Francis and his wife. In the early 1800’s a district school was located on Hog Island near the Choate House. On Sundays religious services were held at the Choate House. Rufus Choate, lawyer, orator, U.S. Senator and Congressman/was born at Hog Island in 1799. Choate Island is accessible only by boat.\n\nESS.21 Lt. Samuel Giddings House, 143 John Wise Ave, Essex MA 1678\n\nThis house was built in 1668 by Captain Samuel- Giddings who came as a military adviser in the Indian Wars not as a settler. However, he liked it so much that returned to build a house of the typical 17th century. Two and a half framed one room with chimney on West end, thatch roof. Later another room was added to west end of house making four rooms and an attic. Old clapboards, before the addition was added are still present in the attic. The land surrounding this house has been continuously farmed.\n\nESS.87 Benaiah Titcomb House, 189 John Wise Ave, Essex MA c 1700\n\nThis house was dismantled and moved from Newburyport in 1911 and is particularly significant for its original, First-Period staircase possibly the finest of a surviving few, the surviving evidence for the exterior plaster cove cornice, the completely intact and exposed interior frame from both its first and second phase, and the hewn overhangs which were continued along the sides when the second-phase lean-to was added.\n\nThe four girts and the small post at the right of the fireplace supporting the chimney girt have continuously running wide quirk beads (1.25″). The longitudinal summer beam (11″ x 11″ x 16′) is decorated with flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops (which are now missing at the end wall side). The ceiling joists are 21″ apart. Above the lintel of the reconstructed hearth is a large plaster cove rising up to the chimney girt. The raised-field paneled chimney wall and door are possibly original and transitional to the Second-Period. Over the modern casement of the end wall is a cut into the girt indicating that it had previously received Second-Period sash.\n\nESS.19 David Burnham House, Pond St. Essex MA c 1685\n\nThe eight acres of land around Tubbytown Farm were granted to John and Thomas Burnham as a pension for services in the Pequot War. Thomas Burnham, known as Lieut. Thomas Burnham settled in the falls section of town. He was a selectman in 1647 and served on the town committee and was also Deputy to the General Court in 1683, 1684 & ’85. He had a sawmill on Chebacco River in 1667- His second son, John owned the grant of land on which the present house is built. John died in 1704, He had nine children, the youngest son, David is said to have built this house. He was a shipbuilder by trade and came from a family of shipwrights. The house was restored under the supervision of George Francis Dowe, curator of the Essex Institute of Salem in 1924. The great fireplace of the original kitchen, the largest in Essex County, 9 feet 5 inches wide, was discovered. A rare form of lattice window was copied from the Metropolitan Museum of New York and used to replace the sash windows which had been installed at some renovation during in the past. In 1927 an old chicken coop moved from down the road, added to the side as a library. Later, Russell Kettel of the Concord Antiquarian Society added two large wings from a servants’ quarters and gardeners cottage.\n\nGEORGETOWN\n\nGEO.7 Hazen – Kimball House, 225 East Main St. Georgetown MA c 1710\n\nThe Hazen House at 225 East Main Street, built ca. 1720 is architecturally representative of First Period building technology in Eastern Massachusetts. Samuel Hazen acquired land in the vicinity below Pen Brook in 1725, building a house upon it sometime thereafter. Examined by architectural historians from Boston University in 1985-1986, the dwelling was felt to merit inclusion on the survey of First Period buildings of Eastern Massachusetts. The First Period portion of the Hazen-Kimball-Aldrich house is a 2 1/2 story 5 bay central chimney structure with an added lean-to. The right-hand rooms and chimney bay of the house comprise the original single cell 2 1/2 story dwelling. The left-hand rooms were added within a few years of the first construction and the lean-to followed probably by the mid 18th century. The house’s chamfered late First Period frame is exposed in two rooms, and there is clearly visible evidence of the stages in the building’s growth. In the right-hand room, there is an exposed longitudinal summer beam, with flat chamfers and extremely long lamb’s tongue stops.The attic reveals a purlin roof. The rafters are slightly larger in the earlier (right-hand portion) of the roof.\n\nGEO.15 Dickinson – Pillsbury House, 170 Jewett St. Georgetown MA c 1700\n\n170 Jewett Street, better known as the Dickinson-Pillsbury-Witham house, is the least altered First Period house extant in Georgetown. Typical of its era are the massive central chimney, small narrow windows (six-over-six light sash with heavy muntins) and second floor overhang. This projects but an inch or so, as it is hewn rather than framed, indicative of the house’s lateness within the First Period (1630-1730). The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Dickinson-Pillsbury-Witham house, as it is known, is locally believed to have been built some time before 1700 by James Dickinson; it is known to have been standing by 1704, when it came into the possession of Samuel Dickinson. It was purchased in 1801 or 1802 by Paul Pillsbury from his uncle Oliver Dickinson. Pillsbury was an inventor of considerable ingenuity, devising machines for shelling the kernels from ears of corn and for stripping the bark from felled trees, as well as for pegging shoe soles. The last invention was of particular importance, given Georgetown’s early prominence as a center of footwear manufacture.\n\nGEO.17 Adams – Clarke House, 93 West Main St. Georgetown MA c 1725\n\nThe land on which this house was built was purchased by John Adams in 1714 from the Prime family, early settlers of Old Rowley. The house was built by John Adams or his son William between that time and ca.1730. Researchers from Boston University in 1985-1986 assigned it a date of ca. 1725, based on its ground floor transverse summer beams (a characteristic of First Period work in Essex County).\n\nGLOUCESTER\n\nGLO.1072, Herrick Ella Proctor House, 257 Concord St. Gloucester MA 1690\n\nThe Herrick House began as a single cell structure consisting of the left hand rooms and chimney bay. The right hand file of rooms was added in the 18th century. First Period features are seen in the left hand rooms and attic. In the left hand room, the longitudinal summer beam, the only framing member exposed, has 1 3/4″ wide quarter-round chamfers, flat collars and concave taper stops. The room retains at least one wall of original clay plaster. In the early 20th century the house was remodeled as a hospital.\n\nGLO.1055, Davis – Freeman House, 302 Essex Ave, Gloucester MA c 1709\n\nThe Davis-Freeman House was constructed by 1712 and has plank frame construction. All four of the original rooms and lobby retain exposed framing members. The summer beams and summer tie beams have flat chamfers, 1 1/2″ wide, and well-executed lamb’s tongue stops. All other major framing members, posts, girts, plates, and ties, have inch wide flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops. Chimney girts in the downstairs rooms are additionally embellished with lamb’s tongue stops on either side of the summer beams. The house was operated as a tavern for most of the 18th century. Tavern keepers included John Procter, Samuel Rust keeper in 1738, and his son Benjamin Rust. From c. 1860 until 1929, the house was owned by Robin Freeman and his descendants. Freeman was a black who escaped from slavery in South Carolina, made his way north, where he was eventually able to purchase the house. The building saw use as a hostelry again in the 20th century. It was restored and operated as the Stage Coach Inn in the 1930’s.\n\nGLO.773, Anthony Bennet House, 41 Gee Ave, Gloucester MA 1679\n\nOwners of this house report that the structure first belonged to Anthony Bennett. According to Babson’s History, Bennett, a carpenter, probably came from Beverly where he was living in 1671. He received a grant of land on the east side of the Mill River in 1679 where he built this house. In addition to being a carpenter, Bennett also owned one fourth of a sawmill believed to be at Goose Cove. He died in 1691. In 1719, his son John successfully petitioned the town to build a corn mill on Pulling Mill Brook (also called Bennett’s Stream). These mills remained in the Bennett family until 1805.\n\nGLO.1088, William Haskell House, 11 Lincoln St. Gloucester MA c 1700\n\nThe Haskell House house is closely associated after 1927 with the important local Boston sculptor, A.H. Atkins, who restored the house and encouraged published interest in it. The structure was briefly owned by the Cape Ann Historical Society, which operated it as a house museum, and features an intact First Period chimney, frame, and unusual and simple interior finish. In the first-floor left hand room, which is only 11 feet wide, both joists and summer beam run longitudinally. The summer beam, c. 6 inches wide and deep, is only slightly larger than the joists. The fireplace, 7 feet, 4 inches wide by 4 feet 11 inches high has two rear corner ovens and a smoke panel. The room has other early finishes: doors and their hardware, and an apparently original small cupboard on the rear wall.\n\nGLO.762, Thomas Riggs House, 27 Vine St, Gloucester MA c 1661\n\nThe Riggs House is very important as one of the few remaining first period houses in Riverdale. Oriented south, as were most first period dwellings, this structure was “built in two parts. The gable-roofed portion dates to 1661 and the gambrel-roofed part was added in 1700. Both parts are examples of timber frame construction, with the gable roofed section said to be built of squared pine logs 15 inches thick. Thomas Riggs first appeared in Gloucester as a grantee of land at Goose Cove in 1658, and built the gable-roofed portion of this house. Trained as a scrivener in England, Riggs was town clerk from 1665 to 1716 a selectman for over 20 years, and a representative to the General Court in 1700.\n\nGLO.309, Whittemore House, 179 Washington St, Gloucester MA 1700\n\nThe house is important for its association with Fitz Hugh Lane (1804-1865), noted painter of marine subjects. Lane’s first studio was in the left-hand (west) room of the Whittemore house when the house was owned by his brother. Evidence of First Period framing is seen in each of the four front rooms. In the right hand room, there is an approximately 1 foot wide longitudinal summer beam with 1 1/4″ flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops. Joists are c. 24″ on centers. There are flat chamfers on all three outer wall girts, but no chamfer on the chimney girt. In the left hand room, there is a longitudinal summer beam with broad quarter-round chamfers. Stops of undetermined shape are present on the summer beam. In the left hand chamber, there is an exposed summer tie beam with 1 1/4″ flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops.\n\nGLO.1008, White – Ellery House, 247 Washington St, Gloucester MA 1710\n\nBuilt in 1710 by the Rev. John White, an influential minister, the house exhibits a certain elegance and refinement commensurate with the owner’s position in the community: the framed overhang, the very elaborate chamfering, particularly of the first floor frame (it is the only example in the survey where all of the horizontal beams, not just the summer beams, are decorated with the costly quarter round chamfer), and the size of the structure with its integral lean-to. The rare survival of three kinds of painted decoration adds significantly to our limited knowledge of less permanent forms of embellishment of First Period houses, while the incorporation of certain Renaissance-inspired features places the house among the earliest examples of transitional architecture.\n\nGLO.764, Joslyn – Wharf House, 551 Washington St, Gloucester MA 1679\n\n551 Washington St. was built by Henry Joslyn. Joslyn’s father, also Henry, came to New England around 1634 and by 1638, he had settled at Black Point (now Scarborough), Maine where he played an important role in the politics of the province. The younger Joslyn also lived in Maine, at Falmouth, but was driven from that town by Indian attacks and came to Gloucester in 1675.\n\nIn 1678 he married Bridget Day and in the next year received a grant of land between the lots of Timothy Somes and Thomas Riggs on which he built this house. In 1693 Joslyn sold the house to Nathaniel Wharf who had married Riggs’s daughter. This is one of 3 first period houses standing in Riverdale, the others being 41 Gee Ave, and the Riggs House on Vine St. The building is oriented with gable roof flank end to the street and features a symmetrically arranged 5-bay facade with a massive center chimney.\n\nGLO.753, Norwood – Hyatt House, 704 Washington St, Gloucester MA c 1664\n\n. Clay plaster walls, early iron hardware and heavy framing timbers and floor joists visible in the cellar indicate that within this house is the remaining core of a 1664 building that was expanded into the present structure in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In his work The Gloucester Guide: A Retrospective Ramble, Jospeh E. Garland dates this house to 1664, the year after Francis Norwood settled at Goose Cove on land granted to him from the Town of Gloucester and land that he purchased from John Pearce. Norwood is believed to have fled England, along with his father, during the restoration of Charles II. Francis Norwood married Elizabeth Coldom (daughter of Clemont Coldom) on October 15, 1663 and had nine children: Thomas 1664; Francis 1666; Elizabeth 1669; Mary 1672; Stephen 1674; Deborah 1677; Hannah 1679; Joshua 1683; Caleb 1685; and Abigail 1690. Francis Norwood died in 1709 leaving his dwelling house to his widow and sons, Francis and Caleb\n\nGLO.1041, 1 Wesley St, Gloucester MA c 1700\n\nAccording to a 1917 map of Riverdale as it appeared in 1741, this house was the property of Samuel Allen and Isaac Elwell. Allen was the son of Joseph Allen, a blacksmith who settled in Gloucester and lived near the original meetinghouse at the Green. In 1726, Samuel married Rachel Day, whose family continued to own property in Wheeler’s Point well into the 19th century. Elwell was the great grandson of Robert Elwell who lived in Gloucester as early as 1635 and was prominent in town affairs. In 1738, Isaac married Susanna Stanwood, again from a family with extensive roots in the Riverdale area. This house is one of two First Period dwellings in Wheeler’s Point, the other being the Wheeler House at the end of the Point. Oriented with its gable roof flank end to the street facing south, the structure has a center chimney and an asymmetrically arranged 4-bay facade.\n\nGLO.1101, 349 Western Ave, Gloucester MA c 1691\n\nThis house dates from c. 1691 and may be the earliest surviving, structure at Fresh Water Cove. It features a three bay facade, a center entry, center chimney and a slight overhang at the gables.\n\nGLO.1024, Dyke – Wheeler House, 144 Wheeler St. Gloucester MA c 1720\n\nThe Dyke-Wheeler House at 144 Wheeler Street is a First Period house built about 1720 according to the MACRIS site and has undergone alterations recently. The original chimney was removed and replaced by a wooden box on the roof, enclosing pipes.The house was at one time believed to have been built earlier, in the 1660s, by a man named Richard Dyke. It is one of two First Period houses surviving on Wheeler’s Point, named for a later owner. The lean-to was added c. 1800. 1800. First Period features are visible in the right and left hand chambers. Framing in the right hand chamber presents an unusual combination of quirk beading and flat chamfering. The end tie beam has an inch wide flat chamfer and lamb’s tongue stops. Corner posts have flat chamfers and no stops. The rear plate begins at the end wall with a flat chamfer, but a third of the way along the beam, the flat chamfer becomes a quirked bead (see photograph). The rest of the framing, including the one exposed brace, is quirk-beaded. The frame of the right hand room also incorporates a ship’s knee to brace the front chimney post and chimney tie beam. In the left hand chamber the front and rear plates are exposed and quirk-beaded. During restoration of the house, a quirked bead was observed on the longitudinal summer beam in the left hand room.\n\nHamilton\n\nHAM.28 Emeline Patch House, 918 Bay Rd. Hamilton MA c 1725\n\nThe Patch House was built about 1680 and added to about 1720, and was moved back from the road in the late 1940’s. The front (north) rooms comprise the original double cell house. The late First Period Frame of this house is visible only in the right-hand front room and lobby. The longitudinal summer beam of the right-hand room has flat chamfers and tapered stops. Rafters of the original principal rafter, common purlin roof are still in place on the front slope of the roof.The house retains many well executed Second Period finishes, including fireplace walls of raised field paneling in the left and right rooms.\n\nHAM.69 Austin Brown House, 1028 Bay Rd. Hamilton MA c 1725\n\nThis house began as a double cell house. A lean-to was added in the 18th century. A photograph taken in 1898 shows the house clapboarded, with a two story lean-to and ell to the left. The ell to the right was added by 1907. In 1915, the house was again enlarged and stuccoed to create a Colonial Revival style country estate. First Period features, in the form of an exposed decorated oak frame, are visible in the left-hand room and in the right-hand and left-hand chambers. In the left-hand room, the 12 inch wide longitudinal summer beam has flat chamfers and tapered stops. In the right-hand and left-hand chambers, the 9 inch wide summer tie beams have flat chamfers and taper stops.The left-hand room is decorated with a fireplace wall of Second Period raised-field paneling in which there is an oven door to the left of the firebox.\n\nHAM.38 Brown House, 76 Bridge St. Hamilton MA c 1670\n\nThe construction date of the earlier side, between 1662 to 1673 places the Brown House among the earliest houses surveyed. The house is representative of construction in the third quarter of the 17th century in the configuration of its chamfers and shadow molded sheathing, and in the retention of the principal rafter/principal purlin roof framing system. That roof system, derived from East Anglian practices, was supplanted almost completely after the third quarter of the century by the principal rafter/common purlin system. The roof also retains a rare example of diagonal wind brace between rafter and principal purlin, a feature found in the Fairbanks house of 1637. The house has a rare original cyma-molded overhanging girt and two large drops.\n\nHAM.70 Woodberry – Quarrels House, 180 Bridge St. Hamilton MA c 1690\n\nThe plank frame construction is representative of a larger group of First Period Houses in Northern Essex County and the structure embodies the distinctive framing characteristics of that sub-group of First Period buildings. In the original cell of the house, the right-hand room displays an ample longitudinal summer beam with wide quarter-round chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops. Joists 20 inches on centers are set into butt cogs in the summer beam, but rest on top of flat-chamfered front and rear girts.The house was updated in the Federal period, probably losing its central chimney at that time. Fireplaces in the rear of the downstairs rooms have Federal trim, as does the small three-run staircase in the entry bay. A mid-19th-century barn adds to the historic significance of the property.\n\nHaverhill\n\nHVR.275 Hazen – Spiller House, 8 Groveland St. Haverhill MA c 1724\n\nThe Hazen-Spiller house is a rare surviving example of First Period brick masonry construction with a through-hall-plan. First Period features in the form of oak ceiling framing originally exposed, although undecorated, and a fireplace with rear corner ovens, are seen in the.first floor rooms. The ​2 1⁄2-story building is made of brick laid in English bond, with end chimneys and a central hall layout. The house was acquired in 1911 by early preservationist William Taylor, who took notes detailing the buildings First Period features. In 1915 Taylor sold the house to Wallace Nutting, who operated the house as a museum.\n\nHVR.274 Dustin House, 665 Hilldale Ave Haverhill MA c 1700\n\nThe Dustin House is a 2 1/2 story brick structure, 3 bays wide and two rooms deep. The walls of the house are laid up in Flemish bond on the south (street) and east sides. The house is one of a very small number of First Period masonry buildings to survive in eastern Massachusetts. First Period features in the form of ceiling framing are seen on both floors. The house is divided into a larger east room and a smaller west room on both floors. In the east room there is a relatively large summer (c. 9″ x 9″) with flat chamfers, simple lamb’s tongue.\n\nHVR.21 Ephraim Davis House, Merrimack Rd. Haverhill MA c 1705\n\nThe Ephraim Davis House is a 2 1/2 story structure with rear lean-to. The right hand room, chamber, and chimney bay comprise the original part of the house dating, according to local history, to 1705. The house has been unoccupied since 1929 and is being used as a barn. The frame, precisely decorated with beveled chamfers, lamb’s tongue stops and pips, embodies distinctive characteristics of design and construction.\n\nHVR.273 Emerson House, 5-9 Pentucket St. Haverhill MA c 1730\n\nThis building, which was originally located on the corner of Winter and Pecker streets was moved to its present location at the time of significant development of nearby Vine Street. Stylistic analysis indicates that the present structure was built sometime after the Pecker family acquired title to all the land between 1720-30, and before they sold it to John Cogswell in August 1764. Nehemiah Emerson, who bought the land in 1787, most likely built the left side of the house. His daughters acquired the house in 1832, and by 1859 mention in their wills of a new house on the old site indicates that the original house had been moved to its present location.The original late First Period single room plan house is the right hand portion of the present building. The core of the house probably reached its present form late in the 18th century.\n\nIpswich\n\nIPS.468 Giddings – Burnham House, 43 Argilla Rd. Ipswich MA c 1685\n\nThe Giddings-Burnham house is representative of First Period construction in the last quarter of the 17th century in beam chamfering, joist spacing, and framing system. However, the house incorporates certain conservative features which link the house to carpentry practices in the earliest years of settlement. These features are the wattle and daub wall fill, the use of flat-wise joists in the cellar and the two story lapped studs in the north wall. The presumed builder of the present house, Carpenter Thomas Burnham, was an elderly man by the time the house was built. George Giddings, who was granted the land in 1635, sold the property with dwelling house to Thomas Burnham in 1667. Burnham was sixty-two in 1680, the earliest date Cummings felt the house could have been built on the basis of style.\n\nIPS.464 Tilton-Smith House, 168 Argilla Rd. Ipswich MA c 1725\n\nThe “Tilton-Smith House” at 168 Argilla Road in Ipswich was awarded the 1999 Susan P. Conley award. Built circa 1720 by Abraham Tilton Jr., a 1998 fire took away much of its original frame, but the owner totally rebuilt the home with attention to historical detail and authentic 18th century craftsmanship. He saved what was salvageable from the burned structure and replaced the rest with period materials salvaged from 18th and 19th century structures throughout New England. The 12-by-38-foot keeping room still has the original 18th-century wood floors, with pit-sawn pine planks 20 inches wide and 22 feet long. The rebuilt walk-in fireplace has twin beehive ovens and a pot rail.This house has a preservation agreement with the Ipswich Historical Commission. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.633 Isaac Goodale House, 153 Argilla Rd. Ipswich MA c 1695\n\nThis colonial home was built in West Peabody in approximately 1695 by Isaac and Patience Cook Goodale. In 1928 it was reconstructed at 153 Argilla Road near Russell Orchards in Ipswich by Robert Lincoln and Susan Goodale. First Period elements include 5 fireplaces and a large central chimney, diamond leaded pane casement windows, hand carved raised paneling, a steep pitched roof, bare clapboards and trim, board and batten doors, and chamfered summer beams. Continue reading.\n\nRobert Kinsman house, 49 Candlewood Rd. Ipswich MA 1721\n\nRobert Kinsman constructed this First Period house in 1714.The home has been greatly expanded over the years. Stephen Kinsman inherited the house in 1726, and with his wife Elizabeth Russell brought up a family of twelve children. They dwelt in the old Robert Kinsman homestead until 1767 when he sold his farm, 47 acres and buildings to Samuel Patch. According to Thomas Franklin Waters, “it was said” that the old Robert Kinsman dwelling burned sometime after it was sold to Samuel Patch, and that this house was built by his son John Patch in 1800, but the story is not supported by any documentation or by the apparent age of the house. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.18 Thomas Dennis House, 7 County St. Ipswich MA c 1670\n\nShoreborne Wilson, a cooper, built a house and a cooper’s shop on this site about 1660. Thomas Dennis bought the property in J.663 (8:69) and added an adjoining parcel in 1671 (3:201). The rear ell of the present house dates from that period, with wide chamfers on the summer beam and unusual unpainted horizontal feather-edged sheathing. The early house appears to have been a typical one-over-one room floorplan 17th century half-house, facing due south with an end chimney. Thomas Dennis was a cabinetmaker and carver, and he is today one of the most renowned artisans of 17th century America. His works (or those attributed to him) are displayed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Essex Institute, Salem MA, Bowdoin College, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.19 Benjamin Dutch House 9 County St. Ipswich MA c 1705\n\nThe early ownership of this property is unclear, but it was part of Benjamin Dutch’s estate, and probably was owned by him in the late 17th century. A house was on the lot by 1714, and occupied by Dutch’s daughter and son-in-law, Though most of the trim on the house is Federal in character, certain first period features remain that suggest the present house was begun in Benjamin Dutch’s time. Framing elements from that period are visible, and both butterfly and strap hinges can be found. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.16 Rogers and Brown House, 83 County Rd. Ipswich MA c 1665-1750\n\nThe main part of the house was built before 1750, abutting the Heard House across from South Green at the corner of County Street. The builder is recorded to have been Major Ammi Ruhami Wise, who was the son of Rev. John Wise. It became the residence of Dr. Samuel Rogers, The house was sold to Asa Brown who moved it to the current location on County Road in 1837 so that the Old South Church could be built facing the Green. (The South Parish church burned in 1977.) Continue reading.\n\nIPS.55 Capt. Matthew Perkins House, 8 East St. Ipswich MA c 1709\n\nThe Captain Matthew Perkins House at 8 East St. in Ipswich was the winner of the 1991 Mary Conley Award. The house dates to about 1710 and was formerly known as the Norton-Corbett House. The 1st period 2-story structure has a timber frame, clapboard siding, an elaborate pilastered chimney, a rear ell, post-medieval overhangs front and side, and one of the best Jacobean staircases in New England. The land on which the house sits was at one time part of an orchard lot and was sold to Matthew Perkins, a weaver and soldier, by Major Francis Wainwright in 1701.The house was probably built about this time. Key features of the house include molded overhangs, a front staircase with Jacobean balusters, and a fireplace in the attic, which was partially finished from the very beginning. There is evidence to suggest that additional original details survive under the 18th and 19th century trim in several principle rooms. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.61 Jordan – Snelling House, 30 East St. Ipswich MA c 1700\n\nFrancis Jordan, mentioned as an Ipswich resident as early as 1634, was the first owner of this lot. He was also the first recorded Town Whipper, a service for which he *as paid 20 shillings a year. His dwelling house is mentioned on this site by 1646. In 1655, one Jeffry Snelling was in occupancy on the site. He had the twin distinctions of receiving a whipping in 1650 “for divers lyes,” and also serving as Town Whipper. The first deed to mention a house on the site dates from 1708 (20:109), and it refers specifically to an “old house.” Waters theorizes that the present house was built subsequent to 1708, but notes that the architecture does indicate an early period. The exact period of the house remains undetermined, and the evidence is confused by years of alterations. Structural evidence reveals that the house was built in two stages, and that the west side is the earliest portion. The two story enclosed porch was attached to the front facade in 1968. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.52 Hodgkins – Lakeman House, 72 East St. Ipswich MA c 1690\n\nWilliam Hodgkins probably built this house before 1700. In 1718 he sold the dwelling to Archelaus Lakeman and the property remained in the Lakeman family for almost 200 years. The Lakemans were a sea-faring family with extensive wharves and warehouses on the property and on the Town Wharf across the street. The house was restored in 1951. The chamfered frame was exposed in one room and the original fireplace was revealed. Some third period trim is extant as well. Arthur Johnson is said to have taken a wall of paneling from the house and it is now installed in the Lakeman-Johnson house on upper East Street. A pre-Revolutionary wall painting was removed as well, and is now located In the Whipple House. Original rafters from the earliest construction reveal that the house was only one room deep. The rafters were lengthened later to cover the the two story rear lean-to. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.68 Andrew Burley House/ Tavern 10 Green St. Ipswich MA c 1688\n\nAndrew Burley bought this land in 1683 and built a house shortly thereafter. Captain John Smith, captain of a fishing schooner, apparently liked the location of the house, midway between the Meeting House and the wharves on the Ipswich River. He bought the house in 1760 and opened a tavern in the building. He operated the tavern there for thirty years. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.465 Thomas Low House, 42 Heartbreak Rd. Ipswich MA c 1700\n\nThe original house was a double cell structure, to which the lean-to was added and then presumably raised in the 18th century. The current east wing was built in 1981, more or less replicating an earlier east wing. The only First Period features currently in the house are a single chimney post with crude chamfer and the collar beams in the attic (survey data indicates collar beams disappear as a feature of the roof framing of one room deep houses before the end of the First Period). Chimney bay dimensions, size of summer beam boxes, steep roof pitch and overhangs at the gable end in combination also indicate First Period construction. East and west room dimensions are 16 feet wide by 19 feet deep. The chimney bay is an ample ten feet wide. One chimney post visible in a closet appears to have an intentional flat chamfer. The longitudinal summer beam in the east room and the summer tie beam in the west chamber have boxes that are 14 inches wide. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.469 James Burnham House, 45 Heartbreak Rd. Ipswich MA c 1690\n\nDeed research by the Rev. Thomas Franklin Waters of Ipswich in the early 20th century strongly suggests the house was one of three owned by James Burnham before 1703 on Heartbreak Road: 1) the house Burnham acquired from Samuel Road in 1677 [2]; 2) a new house Burnham built before 1687 [3]; or 3) another house in which James Burnham lived in 1703. Physical evidence of First Period construction includes: 1) joist spacing of 17 to 18 1/2 inches (among houses examined by Cummings, those with comparable joist spacing were all built before 1683; 2) steep roof pitch; 3) nearly 20 feet square room dimensions (consistent with other major 17th century buildings in Ipswich); 4) extreme width of summer beam boxes on both floors, suggesting that the enclosed summer beams are among the widest on record; 5) the disparity in wall width between the first and second floors on the three outer walls of the right-hand room. The right-hand room and chimney bay comprise the earliest part of the house. The left-hand rooms and the rear ell were added in the 18th century. A 20th century, 2 story porch abuts the west end. The house retains First Period massing with steeply pitched roof and the original central chimney. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.138 Joseph Willcomb House, 13 High St. Ipswich MA c 1668\n\nThe Joseph Willcomb House was built by John Edwards, a tailor, in 1669. It has a massive oak frame, central chimney and clapboards typical of other First Period houses on High Street. The dining room boasts a cavernous firebox and beehive oven. There is a rear ell and a Beverly jog. Some walls display the original wide-board paneling, which was exposed when plaster was removed during restoration. The parlor retains its 17th Century floor and hearth. Continue Reading\n\nIPS.137 Thomas Lord House, 17 High St. Ipswich MA c 1658-1700\n\nThe Thomas Lord house at 17 High Street in Ipswich features original chamfered summer beams, unpainted feather edge paneling in the front rooms and hall, an original saltbox frame, center chimney and five cooking fireplaces with bake ovens and large hearths. The saltbox roof slopes down to one story in the rear. The front entry features the original stairway and paneling. Typical of many early homes, the windows are 6 panes over 9 (cottage style). View MACRIS This First Period house stayed in the Lord family for generations. The lot was granted to Robert Lord who arrived as one of the first European settlers of Ipswich in 1634 and served as town clerk until his death in 1683. The property was transferred to Robert Roberts and then to Thomas Lord, a cordwainer (shoe maker) who built this house in 1658. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.117 Philip Call House, 26 High St. Ipswich MA c 1659\n\nThe Phillip Call House at 26 High St. in Ipswich is a 2 story timber-frame First Period house built by cordwainer Philip Call about 1659, enlarged around 1725. It was probably at first a one over one “half house” with the front door on the right side. The evolution of this property to its current twelve rooms is an outstanding example of careful adaptions of various periods over four generations. Pleasant surprises were awaiting when the house was purchased by the current owners in 1967. Its careful restoration uncovered a chamfered 17th century summer beam and 17th century field paneling behind newer walls. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.134 Edward Brown House, 27 High St. Ipswich MA c 1650\n\nEdward Brown was the original owner of this site in 16 39, and a portion of the present house may date from the period of his ownership (c. 1650). The oldest part of the house is the east side, which began as a one-room over-one-room floor plan. The summer beam and chimney girt of the main east room have simple 1 inch chamfers, and there is pin evidence for a casement window in the front hall. On the door leading to the hallway is a re-used early cock’s-head hinge. In the mid-18th century the west side of the house was built, completing the common central chimney, two-over-two configuration. Later a rear lean-to was added. Most of the present trim dates to the 18th century and early 19th century. The significant architectural features of this house are protected by a Preservation Agreement between the owners and the Ipswich Historical Cornmission. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.119 Waldo – Caldwell, John House, 33 High St. Ipswich MA c 1660-1700\n\nJohn Caldwell bought a house-and land from Cornelious Waldo in 1654 and he removed the old house and built a new house t as a two-over-two-room, central chimney plan house, with massive summer beams, a huge fireplace, and heavy chamfered frame. All these features correspond to a substantial house of the 1660’s. A lean-to was added at a later date, and has since been replaced, Early 18th century details include fine sheathing in the chambers, the front stairs, and the present chimney. The attic stairway is also of considerable age, and is fastened with roseheaded (handwrought) nails. The Waldo-Caldwell House was restored in 1956 and is protected by a Preservation Agreement between the owners and the Ipswich Historical Commission. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.129 Daniel Lummus House 41 High St. Ipswich MA 1686\n\nThe Daniel Lummus House at 39-41 High Street is a recent addition to known 59 First Period Houses in Ipswich (Colonial era homes built between 1625 and 1725). After it was purchased by Al Boynton and Kathy Bruce, they discovered that it was full of first period elements that would date before 1720, as early as 1686. Kathy and Al have dedicated much of their time and energy to renovating the property. They received the 2012 Mary Conley Award for historic preservation from the Ipswich Historical Commission. Ipswich architect Mat Cummings discovered hand-made plaster lathe, chestnut flooring, paneling similar to the nearby Day Dodge House, and a large hidden brick fireplace. Exceptional features in this house include bolection molding around the fireplace on the second floor, and some good raised field paneling. The ell was added about 1900 and the lean-to was raised to 2 stories about 1930. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.125 Jonathan Lummus House, 45 High St. Ipswich MA c 1712\n\nJonathan Lummus bought Captain Symon Stacy’s land and dwelling in 171 (24:236). This was the same parcel granted to Thomas Dudley, Governor, It is said that Lummus built his new house (soon after his purchase) on cellar of the Dudley house. Lummus served in King Philip’s War in 1675 was appointed a tithing man by the town in 1700. The house underwent a careful restoration in 1964. The early frame remains and the original window opening can be determined. Two walls of excellent 18th century paneling exist on the second floor. Nogging has been exposed in the two front rooms. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.124 Kingsbury – Lord House, 54 High St. Ipswich MA c 1660\n\nHenry Kingsbury, the earliest known owner of this lot, is first mentioned in Ipswich Records of 1638. The oldest elements of the present house are usually dates c. 1660, the year Kingsbury sold a house and lot to Robert Lord (2:10), but they may date from earlier in Kingsbury’s ownership. Robert Lord was an active Ipswich citizen. He was charged with keeping the public ways clean and he initiated fire laws for Ipswich – inspecting chimneys himself. Between 1648 and 1683 he served as the First Clerk of the Quarter Sessions Court. Lord was a cordwainer by trade and signed the Loyalist petition in 1666. The house remained in the family until 1820, when Ephraim B. Harris, a housewright, bought the property. The west end of the house is probably the earliest. Among the visible first period details are chamfered timbers in the stone chimney foundation. Second and third period additions were built, and most of the trim is of Federal origin. Key features of this house include a hidden room, 10 fireplaces with delicate Federal details (added by the Lords when they redecorated in 1790). Three hundred years of stylistic variations harmonize well in this house. Continue reading\n\nIPS.159 John Kimball – Lord – House 77 High St. Ipswich MA c 1690\n\nRichard Kimball owned this lot in 1637. The property passed to John Kimball, and the present house dates stylistically from the time of his ownership, in 1696 he sold the property to another Richard Kimball (12:114), and it stayed in Kimball hands through most of the 18th century. The Lord’s acquired the house in 1784 (142:213), and were in possession through the 19th century. The house is an excellent example of growth, particularly in its collection of rear additions, and stylistic evolution. Ralph Burnham restored the house in the 1930’s and it was called “The House of Pine and Oak” for its exposed beams and ceilings. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.151 John Brewer House, 82 High St. Ipswich MA c 1690\n\nThe first owner of this site was John Brewer, and the corner itself was called Brewer’s Corner in the early 18th century. Brewer sold the corner lot, with a house, to Daniel Low in 1717 (32:237). Several early features of the present house indicate it is the dwelling Brewer sold to Low, and probably dates from the late 17th century. The frame is West Anglian in type, a narrow summer beam in one of the first floor rooms has a 1 1/2″ wide chamfer, and the front room contains a great fireplace hidden behind the present opening. The central hall and second floor rooms display beaded Federal detail, and the rear extensions were probably built when those renovations were made. John Brewer was an active citizen in Ipswich’s first century. He built a fort around Meeting House Green in 1661, and in 1683 served as Town Clerk, While in that office he recopied the two old town book. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.149 Tuttle – Lord – Shatswell House 88-90 High St Ipswich MA c 1700\n\nThe oldest section of the Tuttle – Lord – Shatswell house at 88 High Street in Ipswich is said to have been built before 1690 as the home of John Shatswell, who came to join the Ipswich settlement in 1633 with his wife and four children. He was granted this piece of land and built the original small dwelling near the existing one. Shatswell was appointed a surveyor of the land upon which other homes were built, and is the earliest person in Ipswich to whom the title of Deacon was given. This House is one of the oldest residences in town and remained in the family by inheritance from the time of the original grant. This house was the home of Col. Nathaniel Shatswell, famous for his command of Union troops during the Battle of Harris Farm during the Civil War.This lot was owned by Simon Tuttle in the early 18th century, and several late first period features of the house date it to that period. These include unusual horizontal feather-edged wainscotting and West Anglian type framing. The roof has been raised in the rear, but the original rafters survive. One of the upstairs rooms contains mid-18th century raised field paneling on the fireplace wall. The west end of the house -was added by Capt. John Lord in the 1820’s, upon his marriage, completing the present elongated structure. Three families then occupied the house, sharing one narrow kitchen. Captain Lord was known as “India John.” He was Captain of the ship “Francis” which sailed to the East Indies. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.155 Simon Adams House, 95 High St. Ipswich MA c 1710\n\nSimon Adams, a weaver and veteran of King Philip’s War owned this property in 1707, according to a deed of the adjoining property. This “half-house” was originally extended as a lean-to over the rear rooms. Perhaps at the same time the rear roof was raised to cover a full two stories and Georgian trim was added. Surviving elements of that trim include a cornice in the front room, and some fine raised-field paneling On the fireplace wall in the rear chamber. The staircase and the majority of the trim in the house are later. Around 1919 the east ell was added. Simon Adams was born in Ipswich on 1655 to William Adams and Elizabeth Stacy (source). Simon Adams was a weaver by trade and a soldier in the campaign against “King Philip,” the hostile Indian chief and his followers at Narragansett. The first mention of the house at this spot is in the ancient deeds of the adjoining (Jewett) property in 1707, but it could have been as early as 1678. Simon Adams grew up near the present Ipswich train station in his father William’s house. We read in Ipswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony that in 1678, “Simon Adams, a weaver, conveyed to John Kimball, wheelwright, a house and land, “which lyeth next and doth adjoyn with Capt. Appleton, his land toward ye southwest and next unto Ensign French, his land, toward the norwest which said house and land was my father, Will Adams, his homestead.” Simon Adams Sr. died in Ipswich on October 17, 1723 and Hannah died May 6, 1727.

Originally the house was a cottage, with a one room over one room floor plan.The house was later expanded to a typical two room, central chimney plan, and eventually the roof was raised and side and rear additions were made. The original portion of the present house is the western part. The frame in the first floor west room is of the H—type, an early structural technique. Only three known examples are known in this country. In the west attic the chimney bears the mark of the original, lower roof (which covered the 1 1/2 story house), and the rafters have mortises for corresponding low collar beams. Other first period features that are visible include huge fireplaces, a very early back door, and some vertical sheathing.

Kimballs lived in this house for generations, serving in the Indian ‘wars, Revolutionary and Civil wars, and figuring prominently in Ipswich history. Interesting exterior features of the Kimball House include a 12″ overhang along the front cornice at the roof line and an early molded gutter. In 1946 the house was restored, which included removing the beam casings and later additions, and opening the fireplaces. The original portion of the house has a basic central chimney floor plan, with two rooms on each story. The entry hall is dominated by a first-period stairway stained a rich tobacco brown color. The keeping room on the left has a great chamfered summer beam while the walls are covered with vertical wide-boarded tongue and groove sheathing, all in the same deep hue. The room on the right of the hall is Federal, with white painted delicate trim, and the bedrooms contain some fine 18th century paneling. Thus three major architectural periods are represented in one house.

The present house resembles the John Kimball house beside it, which was built around 1715 on a portion of the lot originally purchased by Caleb Kimball. It is likely that “The House with Orange Shutters” was erected about the same time, for Caleb Kimball, son of the 1665 purchaser. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.104 John Kendrick House, 3 Hovey St. Ipswich MA c 1670\n\nJohn Kendricks owned a large lot here in 1665, and the Town Records report that on July 30, 1668 Kendricks was granted the liberty to fell eight white oak trees. The first deed that records a house on the site dates from 1702, when Kendricks sold the property to his son (15:114). Waters states that “The venerable house still standing may be the Kendricks house” and stylistic evidence supports a date of about 1670. Important first period fabric includes rare fragments of a three part casement window frame in the southern gable, rear rafters of the original roof that are visible in the attic, and remnants in the chimney stack of what must have been a handsome pilaster. Roof repairs in 1978 uncovered evidence at the tie beams’ ends of a plastered cove cornice. This house is subject to preservation easements, under a Preservation Agreement held by the Ipswich Historical Commission. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.470 Paine – Dodge House, 49 Jeffrey’s Neck Rd. Ipswich MA c 1695\n\nConflicting historical and architectural evidence makes it difficult to accurately date the house. There was a dwelling on this property by 1689, as Robert Paine, Sr., built a house here for his son, Robert Paine, Jr. in ca. 1665. The construction and finish techniques found in the house re more commonly found after 1700; thus there is some conjecture that this house was built ca. 1702, when Robert Paine’s daughter Elizabeth married Daniel Smith. The house retains much of the original floor plan. The first floor, right hand room has exposed framing. The longitudinal summer beam exhibits a bevel chamfer with lamb’s tongue stops on the south face of the beam, but no stops on the north face. Other visible framing members exhibit a very narrow bevel chamfer, or none at all. The mill-sawn joists are 20″ to 21″ apart on center and fit into butt cogs. Studs, hidden within the plaster walls, are pegged to the girts approximately every 28″. The first floor left hand room has early and very large size bolection molding around the fireplace opening. This type of molding was made ca. 1700-1720, and may be original to the house. Three generations of the Paine family made their home here, including Robert Paine, foreman of the Salem witch trial jury in 1692. The house became part of Greenwood Farm, an early 20th Century summer retreat for the Robert G. Dodge family. The property is now owned by the Trustees of Reservations which offers weekend tours.

There is a wing to the right hand side and a large ell to the rear. The house is composed of two earlier houses moved on to the site and restored by Daniel S. Wendell. The main body of the house was dismantled and moved from an earlier Ipswich site abutting the Choate Bridge. The left-hand rooms and chimney bay comprised the original part of that structure. That single cell building was probably moved onto the Choate Bridge site between 1734 and 1736 and enlarged at that time by the addition of the right-hand rooms. In the 19th century the building became known as the Ross Tavern. The rear ell, originally the Collins-Lord house on High Street (just south of 33 High Street), was also dismantled and moved by Wendell. In 1940, a kitchen wing was added to the right-hand side of the two reconstructed and restored 17th century houses and a small lean-to was built next to the ell at the left rear. The house was restored to a high style First Period appearance by Daniel Wendell on the basis of very specific physical evidence. The clapboarded exterior has gables on the front and rear facades (restored from evidence of mortises in the plate), and a deep two story entrance porch originally was proven by mortises on the outer face of the framing). All the gables have molded verge boards (unweathered ends of the purlins on the exterior indicated an original verge board). There are elaborately embellished overhangs at the second story on three sides and in each of the gables. The second story overhang had been closed in for a number of years before the house was dismantled. Wendell found three cyma molded overhanging girts, mitered at the corners (the posts above have a right angled tenon which helps to hold the mitered ends together). The girts are supported from beneath at the centers by the projecting rounded ends of the T shaped summer beams of the left-hand room. At the corners, the overhanging girts are supported by brackets (restored on the basis of impressions in the wood on the underside of the girts, but with conjectural profiles). Continue reading\n\nShatswell Planters Cottage, 52 Jeffreys Neck Rd. Ipswich MA c 1646\n\nThe Shatswell family is one of the earliest to arrive in Ipswich MA. A small building that was moved to the Collins-Lord property on Jeffreys Neck Road is believed to have been the original planters cottage of John Shatswell or his son Richard. It may have been built as early as 1646, in which case it would be the oldest structure in Ipswich. Continue reading.\n\nIPS.467 Labor in Vain Road House, Labor in Vain Rd. Ipswich MA c 1725\n\nThe main body of the “Beloselski” House on Labor-in-Vain Road is 5 bays wide, one room deep and 2 1/2 stories high with a rear lean-to which may be integral. The house was extended by an ell to the left rear c. 1810 and by a full lean-to dormer in the late 19th or early 20th century. A second ell of 2 stories and a screened porch were added to the rear, very likely in conjunction with use of the building in the 20th century as the club house for the Labor-in-Vain country club. First Period features, in the form of an exposed, decorated frame, are seen in the right-hand room and chamber. In the right-hand room, the longitudinal summer beam, the chimney girt, the front (south east) corner post and the chimney posts have inch-wide flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops. The chimney post has the added embellishment of a taper stop near the floor. In the right-hand chamber, all the framing is exposed and has inch-wide flat chamfers and lamb’s tongue stops. Rising braces are exposed in the rear wall of this room, but whether their presence indicates plank frame construction is unknown. In the lobby the staircase is embellished with a handrail molded on both sides and with possibly original turned balusters, of early Second Period style profile. The balusters are similar in profile to those found in the Smith house nearby at 142 Argilla Road. In the attic, a principal rafter/common purlin roof made with oak timbers is visible.

Ipswich MA c 1678\n\nAn Irish tanner named Thomas Hart arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on the ship Desire from Baddow, Essex County, England. He was briefly indentured to tailor John Brown in Boston. After ending his servitude in 1637, Thomas Hart settled in Ipswich and by 1639 had become a proprietor. In 1640 he built a one-room starter home, and gradually expanded it. Thomas Hart was widely respected and was one of the town’s first selectmen and a town clerk. Thomas Hart, senior died in 1673 and is buried in the Old Burying Ground along with his wife Alice who lived until 1682. Th"
