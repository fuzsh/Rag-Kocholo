        "text": "The North Star Auto Theatre opened as a single screen theatre on July 19, 1962 with Doris Day in “Lover, Come Back” & Susan Hayward in “Backstreet”. On April 10, 1963 it was renamed North Star Drive-In. It had a capacity for 625 cars, which was soon increased to 800 cars.\n\nOn June 28, 1967 a second screen was added which had a car capacity for 600. The opening movie on the second screen was Dana Andrews in “\"Hot Rods to Hell” & Rock Hudson in “Tobruk”. The North Star Drive-In closed in 1998.\n\nContributed by Andrea"
