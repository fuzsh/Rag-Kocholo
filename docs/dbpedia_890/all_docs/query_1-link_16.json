As of May 2017, it’s still going strong.\n\nSteveFratelli on\n\nI’ll be generous and give it a B minus. I have yet see the new screen. However, it has plenty of charm, decent prices and great snack bat food. They seem to be getting more current films these days. And usually have a triple feature on Labor Day, the last weekend of the season. The one major detractor is location, Colvile is in the northeast corner of the state. About a 80 minute drive from Spokane.\n\nJeffSchafer on\n\nSteveFratelli, as NeonMichael pointed out, they “finished rebuilding its screen in June 2015”. This IS the “new” screen. They got this new “Digital” screen from the Soap Lake Drive-In that closed, so, it is virtually brand-new as of 2015.\n\nMajor Detractor: “About a 80 minute drive from Spokane.”\n\nIt’s 100 miles to the closest Drive-In to me.\n\nI live in the Puget Sound area, and it is 371 miles to this Drive-In. I have gone every year since they re-opened & made a mini vacation out of it.\n\nStay at the Comfort Inn in Colville.\n\nIt’s only about 3.5 miles from the Drive-In.\n\nVery convenient.\n\nBTW ~ This Drive-In, the Auto Vue in Colville, has really good, fresh made pizzas."
