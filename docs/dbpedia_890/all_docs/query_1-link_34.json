        "text": "Last Thursday, country music legend Garth Brooks announced on Good Morning America that he would be hosting a concert event at drive-in theaters across the country on June 27th.\n\n\"This one guy came to me and said, 'Hey, look, we can put 300 drive-in theaters together if you will create a concert solely for the drive-ins. We can have families jump in the car, get them out on Saturday night,\" Brooks said on GMA.\n\nNow, some of those locations have been announced.\n\nUnfortunately, no Kern County locations were on the list. As of Monday, the closest location was the Skyline Drive-in in Barstow. However, additional locations could be added.\n\nTickets for the event go on sale on June 19th and will cost $100, which accounts for one passenger car or SUV.\n\nBrooks warned fans that there aren't a lot of tickets, so they will need to act fast.\n\nNo Kern County locations are listed as part of the event, but there are several California locations (additional locations will be added):\n\nMadera Drive-in: 201 East Lincoln Ave, Madera CA\n\nSkyline Drive-in: 31175 Old Highway 58, Barstow CA\n\nThe Nighlight: 403 F Street, Los Banos CA\n\nLakeport Auto Movie Theater: 52 Soda Bay Road, Lakeport CA\n\nKilburn - San Juan Capistrano: 30743 Av La Pata, San Juan Capistrano CA\n\nSunset Drive-In: 255 Elks Lane, San Luis Obispo CA\n\nConcerts in Your Car: 10 W Harbor Blvd, Ventura CA\n\nWest Wind Sacramento 6 Drive-in: 9616 Oates Dr, Sacramento CA\n\nAlameda County Fairgrounds: Pop-Up Drive in Movies: 4501 Pleasanaton Ave., Pleasanton CA\n\nParamount Twin Drive-in: 7770 Rosecrans Avenue, Paramount CA\n\nMission Tiki Drive-in: 10789 Ramona Avenue, Montclair CA\n\nSouth Bay Drive-In: 2170 Coronado Ave, San Diego CA\n\nFull List of Theaters:\n\nTheater"
