The included carrying case also makes the unit super portable and safe to transport.\n\nSetup was a breeze and the bonus stand helped me angle the projector from the rear corner of the room. The auto keystone correction and focus worked like magic as did the obstacle avoidance as it reshaped to fit next to my thermostat and light switch.\n\nSince I was only projecting onto my white wall and not with a projector screen I was worried the brightness would not be enough and the picture would look washed out but the performance of this unit well exceeded my expectations. I'm sure a projector screen would make it look even better, but I am presently content without one.\n\nI have an LG OLED TV in the main room with an nVidia Shield, so having Google TV built in this projector was familiar and convenient to get all the apps set up.\n\nI would totally buy again, and would easily recommend this to others.\n\nI will reserve my review for the Xming Mini Projector Q1 SE, just to refer to the overall experience of ordering from ForMovie...\n\nI have purchased a mini projector multiple times from ForMovie, mainly because after my friends see the quality of image projected from these little projectors, take the plunge and order one with my help...\n\nAll times, we got confirmation of the purchase immediately and the day after, a link allows you to monitor the status of your order and delivery. Projectors reached us in three working days, well packaged and in great condition. Since they were sent from the EU warehouse of ForMovie, delivery is not subjected to added tax or delay, since customs are bypassed completely.\n\nIn general, ordering from ForMovie is a pleasant and trouble free process, that allows you to have your projector in a matter of days. Enjoy your screenings!\n\nIn general, the procee\n\nThe Formovie THEATER UST is my first projector purchase and it's amazing. My largest standard tv to date was a 58 inch screen which I was happy with until I discovered UST projectors. I was intrigued and did some research but it all kept coming back to this one projector, the Formovie Theatre. I am not disappointed, it is absolutely fantastic in every way and I would recommend it to anyone considering a purchase of a projector especially at this price point.\n\nAll I need now is a dedicated screen, recommendations welcome.\n\nYou will not regret this purchase and you will not go back to regular tv's. This is the new standard."
