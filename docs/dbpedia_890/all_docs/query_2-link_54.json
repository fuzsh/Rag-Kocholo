Located in Vineland, New Jersey, it is New Jersey's only drive-in movie theatre. It is less than a one hour drive from Atlantic City, Philadelphia, and Delaware. Combining the nostalgia of the drive-in movie theatre with modern technologies and healthier food choices, the Delsea Drive-In offers affordable family fun for all ages. The number of drive-ins has fallen from over four thousand to less than four hundred over the past few decades, largely in part to increasing real estate values and the popularity of the fast food industry. The Concession Stand is where the drive-in covers operating expenses. In either your own drive-in experiences or wanting to create drive-in memories for your children or grandchildren remember one thing, \"If you eat here, we'll be here.\"\n\nHistory of the Drive-In Movie Theatre"
