        "text": "The i7 is amazing.\n\nIt’s the flagship BMW. It’s electric. And it can travel 388 miles on a single charge. (And it’s filled with dazzling tech).\n\nBut the BMW i7 also has that screen that everyone is talking about.\n\nThe BMW i7’s theater screen will give you the ultimate passenger experience with a massive back-seat screen.\n\nThe BMW i7’s theater screen is a 31-inch 8K ultra-wide TV screen – with a 32:9 super wide display – that unfolds from the cabin roof to entertain the cruiser’s back seat passengers.\n\nThe i7 is the first BMW to carry the German automaker’s Theater Screen system. The system is the first 8K display ever available in a car. Streaming is handled by an onboard Amazon Fire TV, which can access services such as Hulu, Netflix, and HBO via the vehicles. The system also has “Touch Command” touchscreens similar to those found on your mobile phone inside the rear armrests.\n\nAnd before you express concern about distracted driving, keep in mind that the BMW i7’s theater screen is a backseat experience only.\n\nHere’s how this back-seat screen works:\n\nAt the press of buttons in the arm, resets (as well as displays built into the rear door panels) passengers can deploy the 31.3-inch 8K touchscreen TV.\n\nThe BMW i7’s Theater Screen drops down from the interior roof, covering pretty much the entire width of the rear interior.\n\nAt the same time, blinds for the side and rear windows and panoramic glass sunroof automatically drop down, thus creating an interior theater as the ambient lighting dims.\n\nWhen fully deployed, the BMW i7’s theater screen extends down from the headliner to the front-seat backrests, allowing for viewing perfection. You can play content from your own devices on the Theater Screen or stream content from Amazon or Netflix. You can also use the camera in the display can be used as a tool for video conferencing.\n\nCheck out:BMW is Officially the “Most Considered” Luxury Car Brand in America – Here’s Why!\n\nThen there’s the sound system…\n\nTo keep things quiet, you can use your own Bluetooth headphones for sound or you can select the standard or optional Bowers & Wilkins sound system which fills the rear cabin with pristine sonics.\n\nThe Bowers & Wilkins sound system, which is optional, includes 36 speakers that produce a total of 1,965 watts. And audio signal processing devices found in the front and rear seat backrests vibrate when they pick up the bass frequency.\n\nThe standard system has 18 speakers and 655 watts, which still sounds incredible.\n\nThe BMW i7 xDrive60 starts at $119,300.\n\nAs you might expect, BMW isn’t skimping on the rest of the car either. Everything about it is next level.\n\nThe i7 offers all-electric innovation, visionary design, and powerful driving dynamics – so that you can drive the world and feel at home wherever you go.\n\nThe vehicle is powered by a 536 horsepower 101.7-usable-kWh battery pack that sits between the axles under the body. You can get from zero to 60 in a mere 4.5 seconds and reach an impressive top speed of 149 mph. And with its 388-mile range, this all-electric BMW takes on everything from day-to-day errands to longer weekend drives with confidence.\n\nBest of all you’ll be turning heads where ever you go thanks to the i7’s refined, expressive exterior. Inside, there’s a world of detailed perfection, from the glass controls to the stunning Panoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof.\n\nThe BMW Curved Display extends across the dashboard, which features the all-new BMW Interaction Bar – a sleek, faceted glass bar with ambient lighting. Standard glass controls showcase elegant craftsmanship from every angle.\n\nThe rear seating is so expansive that every passenger enjoys luxurious lounge treatment. With front and rear ventilated, heated, and massage seats covered in Merino Leather, you can expect maximum comfort on every drive.\n\nSo sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!\n\nInterested on a BMW i7?
