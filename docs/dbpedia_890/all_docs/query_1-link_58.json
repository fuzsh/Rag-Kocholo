        "text": "If ever there is a single thing that can trigger nostalgia, it may be the drive-in movie theater. Drive-ins harken back to a time of enjoying warm summer nights, scrambling around on sometimes scratchy speakers to get the sound just right, and buying freshly-made popcorn or corndogs from the concession stand.\n\nThe history of the drive-in dates to a late spring night in June of 1933 when the first one opened in Camden, New Jersey. Moviegoers paid 25 cents per car, plus 25 cents per person, to see Wives Beware, a 1932 British comedy starring Adolphe Menjou and Margaret Bannerman. The plot centers on a husband in an unhappy marriage who fakes amnesia so that he can pursue other women. At the time, the year-old Wives Beware, first released as Two White Arms, was selected so that it wouldn’t conflict with newer major releases of the era.\n\nToday in America – or one could argue simply Americana – just a fraction remains of the 4,063 drive-ins that once existed at their peak of popularity in 1958. Even so, more than 300 drive-in theaters are scattered across rural landscapes and in small towns and big cities in almost all fifty states, a number that will more than likely continue to dwindle as more and more high-tech electronic gizmos and gadgets and streaming services command most of our entertainment attention.\n\nBefore drive-ins go extinct, pack up the lawn chairs, load up on insect spray and snacks, and then take a look at the state-by-state listing below to see if one of these outdoor treasures is near you. For a complete listing of drive-in movie theaters, Drive In Movie provides a comprehensive directory, plus it mixes in fun touches of history and trivia.\n\nAlabama is home to eight drive-ins, most in the northern part of the state in Athens, Boaz, Center, Guin, Henagar, Leeds, and Russellville, but the one anomaly is Continental Drive-in in Wicksburg near Dothan in the far southern reaches of the state.\n\nAlas, Alaska, you have no drive-ins but the star-filled clear skies and Northern Lights provide plenty of natural entertainment.\n\nArizona, your only drive-in is West Wind Glendale 9 Drive-in in Glendale, but you have nine screens from which to choose a movie.\n\nArkansas, the outdoor silver screens are in Fayetteville, Marshall and Mountain View. The single-screen Stone Drive-in in Mountain View has been around since 1965.\n\nCalifornia claims more than two dozen drive-ins in cities to include Barstow, Concord, Imperial Beach, Industry, Lakeport, Madera, Montclair, Paramount, Riverside (it has two), San Jose, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santee, and Twentynine Palms, plus the West Wind Sacramento 6 Drive-in in Sacramento.\n\nColorado’s nine drive-ins are in Buena Vista, Commerce City, Delta, Denver, Fort Collins, Minturn, Monte Vista, and Pueblo, with one more in Montrose, the Star Drive-in that you can enjoy après-ski.\n\nConnecticut’s three drive-ins are at Mansfield, Southington and the Pleasant Valley Drive-in in Barkhamsted. Pleasant Valley is the smallest and oldest of the three and is set on a verdant field of grass.\n\nDelaware joins Alaska in having no drive-in theaters.\n\nFlorida’s drive-ins are in Dade City, Lake Worth , Lakeland, Ocala, Ruskin, and Tampa, and the Swap Shop Drive-in in Fort Lauderdale remains the largest of all of America's drive-in theaters with 14 screens.\n\nGeorgia is on your mind with five drive-ins, including the Starlight 6 Drive-in in Atlanta that’s been around since 1956. Others are in Blue Ridge, Tiger and Trenton in North Georgia, with the Jesup Drive-in in Jesup in South Georgia.\n\nHawaii bid aloha to the last of its outdoor theaters in the 1990s.\n\nIdaho’s several drive-ins number the aptly-named Spud Drive-in in Drigg. Get it? Spuds? Idaho Potatoes? There you go. The Spud is one of the smallest drive-ins in America, accommodating only a hundred cars. Others are in Grangeville, Parma, Rexburg, and Soda Springs.\n\nThe drive-ins of Illinois are in Belleville, Earlville, Galesburg, Gibson City, Litchfield, McHenry, Newton, and Sterling. The Route 66 Drive-in is in Springfield, the state capital. Chicago, big city that it is, has no drive-ins.\n\nIndiana’s long list of 20 drive-ins count in its number the Starlite Drive-in in Bloomington. Others are found in Franklin, Garrett, Georgetown, Huntington, Indianapolis, Knox, Martinsville, Mitchell, Monticello, Plymouth, Rockport, Shelbyville, Spencer, Terre Haute, Thorntown, Valparaiso, Versailles, Wabash and Winchester.\n\nIowa’s Blue Grass Drive-in Theater in Blue Grass is one of the newest drive-ins in America, having opened in 2014. If you don’t like what’s playing, drive to Delmar, Newton or Spirit Lake, whose Superior 71 Drive-in was once a farm.\n\nKansas is more than sunflowers and wheat fields, with drive-ins in Dodge City, Kanopolis, Kansas City, Paola and Dodge City with its South Dodge Drive-in.\n\nKentucky’s handful of drive-ins are in Calvert City, Franklin, LaGrange, Mount Sterling, Paris, Somerset and Stanford. Another, the Skyline Drive-in, is in Greensburg and first opened in the 1950s heyday of drive-ins.\n\nLouisiana, along with Delaware, Hawaii and Alaska, has plenty of cinemas but no drive-ins.\n\nMaine, although a fairly small state, has seven drive-ins, including the Skylite Drive-in in Madawaska, which happens to be the northernmost in America and within a stone’s throw of Canada. Catch outdoor shows in other towns such as Bridgton, Farmington, Hermon, Saco, Skowhegan or Westbrook.\n\nMaryland has only one drive-in, and that is Bengies Drive-in in Middle River. While Bengies may be the only one, it does have the largest screen of all the drive-ins in the country, measuring in at 120 feet wide and 52 feet high.\n\nOnly four drive-ins remain in Massachusetts and are found in Leicester, Mendon, Northfield and Wellfleet Drive-in in South Wellfleet on Cape Cod.\n\nAt one time, Michigan’s Ford Wyoming Drive-in in Dearborn could hold 3,000 cars but that was pared down to about 2,500. The towns and cities of Carsonville, Coldwater, Dowagiac, Flint, Hartford, Honor, Muskegon, and Plymouth also have outdoor cinemas.\n\nMinnesota, the land of 10,000 lakes, has six drive-ins found in Elko New Market, Lake Elmo, Long Prairie, Luverne and Warren. The Starlite Drive-in 5 in Litchfield, while primarily showing first-run movies, sometimes throws back to show old movies and is truly retro in that it accepts only cash and checks.\n\nMississippi’s Iuka Drive-in in Iuka is the only drive-in in the Magnolia State, but it’s been around since 1957.\n\nMissouri is more than the Ozarks with several drive-ins to suit your fancy. They’re located in Aurora, Cadet, Carthage, Cuba, Houston, Lamar, Moberly, Van Buren and Independence, home to the B&B Twin Drive-in.\n\nThe Big Sky Country of Montana has a mere two drive-ins, the Amusement Park Drive-in in Billings and Silver Bow Twin Drive-in in Butte.\n\nNebraska, like Montana above and Nevada below, has only two drive-ins, the Falcon Wood Drive-in in Bellevue and Starlite Drive-in in Neligh, but a third, Quasar Drive-In Theater will open in Valley in the spring of 2020.\n\nNevada’s Westwind Las Vegas 6 Drive-in in North Las Vegas and El Rancho Drive-in in Sparks are the only ones in the entire state.\n\nNew Hampshire has one up on Montana, Nebraska and Nevada with three drive-ins, among them Weirs Drive-in in Laconia, Milford Twin Drive-in in Milford and Northfield Drive-in in Northfield.\n\nNew Jersey has a sole remaining drive-in, Delsea Drive-in in Vineland.\n\nNew Mexico’s Fort Union Drive-in in Las Vegas is the only one in existence in the Land of Enchantment.\n\nNew York is the clear winner with more than two dozen drive-in theaters, listed here for your convenience in alphabetical order: Alexandria Bay, Amenia, Aurelius, Averill Park, Avon, Ballston Spa, Big Flats, Broadalbin, Coxsackie, Delvan, Glenmont, Greenville, Hyde Park, Lockport, Lyons Falls, Massena, Middleport, Middletown, Minetto, North Hoosick, Palatine Bridge, Perry, Portville, Poughkeepsie, Queensbury, Unadilla, Warwick and Watertown.\n\nNorth Carolina once had more than 200 drive-ins, but now just six remain at Albemarle, Eden, Henderson, Shelby and Tabor City. Hounds Drive-in in Kings Mountain defies the trend of closures by opening brand new in 2016.\n\nNo drive-in theaters exist in North Dakota.\n\nOhio was an early runner in the drive-in race, with the Starlight Auto Theater opening in 1937. Today the theaters are found in Amelia, Barberton, Brookville, Chardon, Hamilton, Kenton, Lancaster, Liberty Center, Mansfield, Maria Stein, Middle Point, North Ridgeville, Norwalk, Oregon, Ravenna, Sidney, Strasburg, Tiffin, Vandalia, Wadsworth, Warren and Wintersville. South Drive-in in Columbus can hold 1,100 vehicles, and on weekends, a flea market is held during daylight hours.\n\nIn Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains, has quite a few in places like Chickasha, Oklahoma City, Poteau, Shattuck, Springer and Tulsa. The Beacon Drive-in in Guthrie is one of Oklahoma’s oldest drive-ins, dating to 1950.\n\nJust three drive-ins are in Oregon, the La Grande Drive-in in La Grande, the M&F Drive-in in Milton-Freewater and the 99W Drive-in in Newberg.\n\nPennsylvania’s outdoor theaters include Shankweiler's Drive-in in Orefield, which is America’s second oldest drive-in that opened in 1934. Others are in Butler, Berlinsville, Brookville, Carmichaels, Carrolltown, Clearfield, Connellsville, Dickson City, Dillsburg, Gratz, Grindstone, Hunlock Creek, Indiana, Johnstown, Kane, Lehighton, Mifflintown, Montgomery, Moon, Mount Pleasant, Newville, North Vandergrift, Northumberland, Portage and Waterford.\n\nTiny Rhode Island hosts two drive-in theaters, Rustic Tri-View Drive-in Theatre in North Smithfield and Misquamicut Drive-In Theater in Westerly.\n\nSouth Carolina has only three, Highway 21 Drive-in in Beaufort, Auto Drive-in in Greenwood and Monetta Drive-in Theatre, nicknamed the Big Mo, in Monetta.\n\nSouth Dakota’s Roy's Black Hills Twin Drive-in in Hermosa is another fairly new drive-in, having opened in 2012. Others in South Dakota are found in Gregory, Miller, Mobridge, Redfield and Winner.\n\nTennessee, one of the great outdoors states in the United States, has quite a few drive-ins, among them Hi-Way 50 Drive-in in Lewisburg that is the Volunteer State’s oldest operating drive-in. For others, drive to Athens, Bristol, Camden, Centerville, Elizabethton, Estill Springs, Lafayette, Maryville, Memphis, Sparta, Watertown and Woodbury.\n\nIf you expected that the number of drive-ins in Texas would be big, you would be correct. From the High Plains theater of Tascosa Drive-in in Amarillo and sweeping through the rest of the state, they’re found at Abilene, Austin, Buda, Clarendon, Ennis, Fort Worth, Gatesville, Graham, Granbury, Hockley, Lubbock, Mercedes, Midland, and New Braunfels. The drive-ins in El Paso and Tyler are adult-only.\n\nUtah’s drive-ins are in Mount Pleasant, Riverdale, Roosevelt, Tooele and Salt Lake City, where Redwood Drive-in Theatre, with its six screens, is the largest in the state.\n\nPretty little Vermont has but three drive-in theaters, and they are Bethel Drive-in in Bethel, Sunset Drive-in in Colchester and Fairlee Drive-in Theatre in Fairlee.\n\nVirginia’s few drive-ins include Starlite Drive-in in Christiansburg, one of about ten in America named Starlite or Starlight. Others are in Hadensville, Lexington, Marion, Norton and Stephens.\n\nWashington’s drive-in theaters are found in Bremerton, Colville, Oak Harbor, Port Townsend, and Shelton with its Skyline Drive-in.\n\nWest Virginia has only five drive-ins, including those at Athens, Chester, Franklin, Meadow Bridge and the Sunset Drive-in in Shinnston and which is the oldest remaining drive-in in the state, having opened in 1942.\n\nWisconsin counts ten drive-ins scattered across the state in Chetek, Chilton, Fish Creek, Jefferson, Monroe, Richland Center, Shawano and Wisconsin Dells. And you have to love the name of this one in Freedom, the Field of Scenes Drive-in."
