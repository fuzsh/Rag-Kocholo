In 1861, when BAM was founded, the term \"academy\" had a slightly different connotation than it does today; it referred to an association or institution for the advancement of art, literature, or science, which BAM certainly endeavored to be.\n\nThe Brooklyn Academy of Music was first created with the intention of presenting music alone. Soon after its inception, however, BAM began to expand its repertoire to present not only music, but also theater, opera, dance, and most recently, film, visual art, and literature.\n\nFor more information, email the BAM Hamm Archives staff at archives@BAM.org .\n\nPurchasing Tickets\n\nWhat are the sales hours?\n\nTickets available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week online at BAM.org\n\nBAM Ticket & Customer Service Hours Mon – Thurs: 12pm – 6pm, Fri: 10am – 2pm\n\ninfo@BAM.org\n\n718.636.4100x1\n\nCinema Tickets\n\nIn person at the BAM Rose Cinemas box office\n\nOpen a half hour prior to the first screening of the day, 365 days a year\n\nI am having problems purchasing tickets online.
