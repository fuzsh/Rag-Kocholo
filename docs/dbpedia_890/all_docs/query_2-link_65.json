With space for 1,100 cars extending across 18 acres! A Cinemiracle Picture Screen sized at 75’ x 130’ was used so that both 35mm and 70mm movies could be shown. The cost of the year round theatre was estimated at $500,000 by Ralph T. Sharp, Inc, the General Contractor for the project. Circle-R electric car heaters were provided during the winter to adventurous movie goers. Michael Chakeres, then vice-president and general manager of Chakeres Theaters, Inc. stated that the new theater would “have first run and subsequent run family-type shows similar to Southland 75 (Drive-In). This is a fast growing area and will serve Brookville, Englewood, Trotwood and other communities.”\n\nMelody 49 began their gala opening with a giant fireworks display, followed by three hit movies, including the incredible undersea adventure ‘Around the World Under the Sea’ starring Lloyd Bridges. In 1982 Melody 49 switched to a sound process with operated through a special cable installed above the drive-in parking area. The movie soundtrack was transmitted through the cable, which broadcasted over an AM frequency that could be picked up by the patron’s car radio. In 1998 this was replaced by an FM frequency.\n\nThe theater changed it name to the Melody 49 Twin in 1987 after a second motion picture screen was added. Taken from Southland 75 after it closed, the smaller screen was set up at the back of the lot and could accommodate approximately 200 cars. So when attendance at the major screen drops off, we can move the film to the smaller screen and bring in a new picture for the major screen, explained Grant Frazee, general manager of Chakeres Theaters at the time.\n\nDid you know?\n\nMelody 49 was the second all-medallion theater in Ohio, meaning that everything was electrically operated, including the heating and air-conditioning.\n\nThe three lane snack bar, designed by architect R. J. McNutt, was built to be capable of serving 2,000 patrons in 30 minutes. Since most refreshments were bought during the ten minute intermission, quick service was of the utmost importance. Automatic food warmers were installed to ensure that the snacks remained hot and delicious.\n\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\n\nA: Please check our website(click here) for the latest schedule.\n\nA: Current pricing is available on our website(click here).\n\nA: Audio is transmitted through an FM radio signal.
