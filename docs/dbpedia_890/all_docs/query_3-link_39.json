        "text": "1. Jesup Drive-In Theater in Jesup\n\nJesup Drive-In has been showing movies on the Georgia coast since 1948. Don’t miss the 1950s-esque car hops – their uniforms will take you back to the days of sock hops and malt shops.\n\nOpen Friday and Saturday through August. Tickets are $8 per person age 12 and up, $4 for children age 6-11, free for children under age 5, or $20 per car load. Concessions are available, and there is a $10 food permit fee per car for those bringing their own picnic.\n\n2. Starlight Drive-In Theatre in Atlanta\n\nSince 1949, Starlight Drive-In has entertained guests on the outskirts of Atlanta. Due to their strategic location and savvy growth decisions, they have remained an Atlanta staple.\n\nDouble features play seven days a week on high-quality digital projection. Tickets are $10 for adults and $1 for kids 5-9 years old. Concessions available. See the website for coupons. No pets.\n\nDon’t miss their swap meet Saturday and Sunday with free parking. Admission is only 50 cents.\n\n3. Swan Drive-In Theatre in Blue Ridge\n\nSwan Drive-In opened in Blue Ridge in 1955. At the time, there was no TV in the city, and demand for the movies was huge. The local businessmen could barely keep up.\n\nIt took much effort and fortitude to build the large drive-in theater, but once it was accomplished, Blue Ridge attracted people from miles around – all seeking to watch a movie on the big screen.\n\nIt was named \"Swan\" because of the beautiful, peaceful birds one of the owners admired while stationed in England during WWII.\n\nBlockbuster new releases and retro classics show year-round every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There is a diner on-site, and car hops deliver to your car during the movie.\n\n4. Tiger Drive In Theatre in Tiger\n\nTiger Drive-In, also in the mountains, originally opened in 1954, closed for a bit in the 1980s, and then reopened in 2004. Catch a flick Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Tickets are $10, and kids 4-11 are $5. Children under 3 are free. Concessions are available, and picnics are encouraged. Kids will love the playground, too.\n\nLooking for a cool camping spot? Bring your RV or tent and sleep at the theater after the movie for $20 for tent camping and $40 for RVs. Or, you can book a stay in one of the theater's three vintage campers, and your stay includes two movie passes!\n\n5. Wilderness Outdoor Movie Theater in Trenton\n\nOn the Georgia/Tennessee border is Wilderness Outdoor Movie Theater, which touts the largest outdoor drive-in movie screen in the world.\n\nDouble features play on weekends three seasons a year; the theatre is closed during winter months. Tickets are $7 – cash only. Ages 3 and under are free. Pets welcome.\n\nPark in your car like a traditional drive-in theater guest, or bring your blanket and chairs to the great lawn while you watch.\n\nOutside food and drink (including alcohol) are not permitted. An extensive selection of concessions are available.\n\nFinal Note: Most of the drive-in theaters are not making money from the movies they show. It’s the concession stand that drives the opportunity for these historic landmarks to stay in business. Please consider purchasing a hamburger, fries, popcorn or funnel cake while you visit. Even if they take credit cards, cash is always better. Let’s work together to see these family adventure spots are still around for the next generation to enjoy!"
