This can be automated instead with startup and shutdown macros.\n\nFix/Solution\n\nExit to the shell and enable \"remote startup\" and \"remote shutdown\" in the network settings of all client consoles in the system\n\nBuild 2 macros, one for MultiConsole power on and one for MultiConsole power off\n\nIn the file browser, navigate to setup>system settings>system\n\nAssign the macros you just built as your startup and shutdown macros"
