        "text": "Water For Elephants\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS April 7th, 2024\n\nWater For Elephants had its final performance for MTC subscribers on April 7, 2024. The critically acclaimed bestselling novel WATER FOR ELEPHANTS comes to vivid life on Broadway in a unique, spectacle-filled new musical. After losing what matters most, a young man jumps a moving train unsure of where the road will take him. He finds a new home with the remarkable crew of a traveling circus and a life—and love—beyond his wildest dreams. Seen through the eyes of his older self, his youthful adventure becomes a poignant reminder that if you choose the ride, life can begin again at any age. Directed by Tony Award® nominee Jessica Stone (Kimberly Akimbo), with a book by three-time Tony nominee Rick Elice (Peter and the Starcatcher, Jersey Boys) adapted from Sara Gruen’s novel, and a soaring score by the acclaimed PigPen Theatre Co., WATER FOR ELEPHANTS unites innovative stagecraft with the very best of Broadway talent in an authentic and deeply moving new musical that invites us all to give ourselves to the unknown.\n\nPoor Yella Rednecks\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS December 3rd, 2023\n\nQui Nguyen, the wildly inventive playwright (and screenwriter for Marvel and Disney) known for his use of pop culture, pop music and puppetry, reunites with his frequent director, May Adrales, for this funny, sexy and brash new play. A young Vietnamese family attempts to put down roots in Arkansas, a place as different from home as it gets. A mom and dad balance big hopes and low-wage jobs, as old flings threaten to pull them apart. It all makes for a bumpy road to the American dream. From the world of Nguyen’s Vietgone, with its comic book and action movie influences, comes a play that melds a deeply personal story with the playwright’s trademark, killer humor. The New York Times hails the writer’s work as “culturally savvy comedy,” and this production shows you why.\n\nJaja’s African Hair Braiding\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS November 19th, 2023\n\nThis dazzling world premiere welcomes you into Jaja’s bustling hair braiding shop in Harlem where every day, a lively and eclectic group of West African immigrant hair braiders are creating masterpieces on the heads of neighborhood women. During one sweltering summer day, love will blossom, dreams will flourish and secrets will be revealed. The uncertainty of their circumstances simmers below the surface of their lives and when it boils over, it forces this tight-knit community to confront what it means to be an outsider on the edge of the place they call home. This extraordinary new play is by the award winning Ghanaian-American playwright Jocelyn Bioh (School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play) and will be directed by Obie winner Whitney White (Our Dear Dead Drug Lord).\n\nPrayer for the French Republic\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS March 3rd, 2024\n\nWinner of the 2022 Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best New Off-Broadway Play, Joshua Harmon’s Prayer for the French Republic bursts onto Broadway after MTC’s highly acclaimed extended, sold-out Off-Broadway run. A celebrated work by the author of Bad Jews and Significant Other, which The Wall Street Journal calls \"easily the finest play of the Broadway season.\" The Chicago Tribune calls Prayer for the French Republic \"gripping and epic,\" and New York Stage Review gives it five stars, stating \"Prayer packs a wallop.\" Directing is David Cromer, a Tony Award® winner for The Band's Visit.\n\nBrooklyn Laundry\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS April 14th, 2024\n\nJohn Patrick Shanley, the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning author of Doubt and the Oscar®-winning writer of Moonstruck, returns to MTC with this world premiere of a new play. Sometimes big things start from little things; in this case, a bag of laundry. Shanley’s latest is about three sisters, a guy who runs a laundry in Brooklyn, and the sometimes savage tricks life plays on them. Tragic and funny by turns, this story will remind you what is important in life... and the sorrow and joy of fully embracing adulthood.\n\nCost of Living\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS November 6th, 2022\n\nWinner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize, Martyna Majok's powerhouse play receives its Broadway premiere after a celebrated run at MTC's Stage I. Hailed by The New York Times as \"gripping, immensely haunting and exquisitely attuned,\" this insightful, intriguing work is about the forces that bring people together, the complexity of caring and being cared for, and the ways we all need each other in this world. Kara Young and David Zayas join acclaimed original stars Gregg Mozgala and Katy Sullivan in this production, again directed by Obie Award winner Jo Bonney.\n\nWhere the Mountain Meets the Sea\n\nFINAL PERFORMANCE WAS November 27th, 2022\n\nFrom acclaimed writer Jeff Augustin (The New Englanders at MTC, \"The Morning Show\") comes a timely story of a son's quest to connect with his father. Lyrical story-telling and live folk songs from The Bengsons weave a tale of searching and longing, family and legacy.
