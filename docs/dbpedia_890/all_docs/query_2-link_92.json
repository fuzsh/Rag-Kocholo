        "text": "The drive-in movie theaters made their way to the Lenawee County scene in the late 1940s, making their mark in local history for approximately 50 years. This week's column takes a look at those I could find information about. The first ones debuted in 1948, one in Adrian and the other in Addison.\n\nLenawee Twin Drive-In, Adrian Township\n\nThe Lenawee Twin Drive-In opened, as the Lenawee Auto Theatre, in June. Located on M-52 north of Adrian, the auto theatre was the first of two to serve the greater Adrian community. The auto theatre eventually adopted the new name of Lenawee Drive-In, and upon receiving a second screen in 1978, was dubbed the Lenawee Twin Drive-In.\n\nWith the construction of the new, enclosed MJR Adrian Cinema 6 on the site in the fall of 1989, the old drive-in was closed and demolished to make way for the MJR parking lot. In 2020, the theater is known as the MJR Adrian Digital Cinema 10, although at this writing it is currently closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStarlite Drive-In Theatre, Addison\n\nThe Starlite Drive-In Theatre north of Addison along U.S. 127 north of Greenleaf Road opened in May 1948 and ran showings until the 1960s, the date of closing which has not been confirmed.\n\nSky Drive-In, Madison Township\n\nThe following year, in May 1949, the Skyview Drive-In on the east side of Adrian in Madison Township opened. The drive-in proved to be a popular hangout spot. In-car heaters were made available in 1959. In September 1961, William C. Jenkins as its manager was named the Showman of the Year by the Allied Theaters of Michigan. Jenkins had been manager since 1956.\n\nThe drive-in, renamed the Sky Drive-In in 1950, included a playground for kids. The drive-in owners by 1985 shifted the market of its variety of movies to that of a strictly \"family drive-in.\" It reopened in the spring of 1986 as Jim-N-Ee's Drive-In Theatre.\n\nAdvertisements for shows ran through the fall of 1986, then nothing. Some sites that track drive-in histories list the Sky Drive-In as closing in 1987. It simply closed at the end of the 1986 season and failed to reopen. The property, 11 acres, was listed for sale in February 1987 for $155,000 as having land development potential. By 1990, the former drive-in was long-abandoned, pieces of sheet metal one by one falling from the once imposing framework. Kohl's eventually bought and developed the property for its Lenawee County store locations.\n\nHilltop Drive-In Theatre, Palmyra Township\n\nLittle can be found on the Hilltop Drive-In two miles east of Adrian along U.S. 223 near Ogden Highway. It operated mostly throughout the late 1940s, starting in 1948. In 1949, the Hilltop offered Spanish-speaking films on Mondays. In 1952, Hilltop, now largely describing the property on the southwest corner of the intersection, was well-known for its dancing. By 1953, the Hilltop Roller Skating Rink was the main advertised attraction. It is said the theatre itself ceased to run in 1955. The skating rink burned in June 1966.\n\nDevils Lake Drive-In, Manitou Beach\n\nIn 1952, the Devils Lake Drive-In, constructed by Drive-In Ministries, dedicated its showings to family-and faith-themed movies. The drive-in was rebuilt in 1965 after taking a direct hit by one of the infamous Palm Sunday tornadoes.\n\nAfter the closing of the Lenawee Twin site in 1989-90, the Devils Lake Drive-In became the last operating one in the county. It would thrive for 18 more years.\n\nIn 2008, the Devils Lake Drive-In was set to open for the summer, but its owners, Terry and Olive Lytle, both died earlier that year. Terry died in Florida April 1 after a short illness. Olive prepared to open the drive-in and the summer schedule was printed and distributed, but she died May 21 while preparing the property for the season. As their surviving families lived out of state, the decision was made to shutter the property. The ticket booth and screen building still stand in 2020, an abandoned reminder of an era that, for now, is resigned to Lenawee County's past chapters.\n\nDan Cherry is a Lenawee County historian."
