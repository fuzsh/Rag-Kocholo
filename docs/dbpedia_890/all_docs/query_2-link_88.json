If you come to the theater on a day that is not on your online ticket you will not be admitted to see the movies. Click the ticket below to buy your tickets online.\n\n1 Ticket per car. This ticket is to include all occupants in the vehicle. Our admissions are still per person, not per car. This is really no different than coming to the ticket booth and paying for however many adults and/or children are in the car."
