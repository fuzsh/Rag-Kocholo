        "text": "Massena’s charming, old-fashioned solo screen “auto theater” has been delighting audiences in the North Country since 1955.\n\nThe 56 Auto Theater is the northernmost drive-in theater in the state of New York. If you're venturing any further north, you might want to pack your passport.\n\nStarting late April and running through September, you can catch a double feature on their big screen every weekend. As the season heats up, they kick it into high gear and show movies every night, from when school lets out until Labor Day. So grab your popcorn, your family or your sweetie, and enjoy the magic of movies under the stars at The 56.\n\nA localized FM radio broadcast provides movie audio. As of this writing, shows start at dusk (approx. 8:45 pm).\n\nGeneral Admission is $8, Lil’ ADKers 12 and under $4 and ages three and under FREE. Well-behaved dogs are also welcome. Check out their website for current showtimes and more information.\n\nDon’t forget to visit the snack bar for hotdogs and hamburgers with all the toppings, fried dough, slushies, popcorn, candy, and so much more."
