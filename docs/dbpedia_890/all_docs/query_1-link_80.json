        "text": "Best Oral Care Products Buying Guide\n\nYour oral health depends on simple dental care habits, such as brushing and flossing. Sam's Club has all the best oral care products you need to protect your oral health.\n\nWhat is Oral Care?\n\nGood oral care is keeping your teeth clean and free of debris, making sure your gum line is pink and does not hurt or bleed when you brush or floss and keeping bad breath at bay.\n\nWhat are oral care products?\n\nToothbrushes, floss and mouthwash are common oral care products.\n\nFind oral care products and bulk oral care products at Sam's Club\n\nSam's Club carries everything you need for dental hygiene such as toothpaste, manual and power toothbrushes, mouthwash, floss, whitening products and denture care all in bulk at members-only prices.\n\nWhat Different Types of Oral Care Products Are There?\n\nThere is a wide variety of oral health care products available to consumers.\n\nManual toothbrushes\n\nThese are your classic toothbrushes made with nylon bristles. There are three main types of toothbrush bristles: soft, medium and firm. Manual toothbrushes also come in a variety of brush head shapes and sizes.\n\nElectric toothbrushes\n\nElectric toothbrushes, also known as a powered toothbrush, run on batteries although some are rechargeable. Electric toothbrushes have bristles that vibrate or rotate to help you remove plaque buildup from your teeth and gums.\n\nToothbrush head replacements\n\nMany electric toothbrushes have replaceable heads. This allows you to reuse the base and customize the perfect toothbrush head for your dental needs.\n\nToothpaste\n\nThere are many types of toothpaste available in the market. Common types of toothpaste include fluoride toothpaste, gel toothpaste, desensitizing toothpaste, anti-plaque toothpaste and whitening toothpaste.\n\nFloss\n\nDental floss is used for plaque removal from the adjacent surfaces of the teeth.\n\nFloss picks\n\nFloss picks are a supplementary tool for flossing. It's a good tool for children or individuals with special care needs to clean the adjacent surfaces of their teeth.\n\nWaterpik\n\nWaterpiks are an electric appliance that uses a stream of water under force to remove food and plaque from between the teeth and massage the gums.\n\nMouthwash\n\nMouthwash is an oral rinse that can be used to prevent tooth decay, reduce the formation of dental plaque and gingivitis or reduce tooth sensitivity.\n\nTeeth whitening\n\nTeeth whitening products are used to lighten tooth stains or tooth color. They usually contain active ingredients such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide.\n\nBrand of oral care products\n\nSam's Club carries the top brands in oral care at exclusive member prices.\n\nManual vs. Electric Toothbrushes\n\nAccording to the American Dental Association (ADA), both electric and manual toothbrushes are effective at removing oral plaque.\n\nManual\n\nPros\n\nAccessible: They are found at grocery stores, pharmacies and even gas stations.\n\nAffordable: Manual toothbrushes are economical. Average prices range from one to three dollars.\n\nCons\n\nBrush too hard: Studies have shown that you are more likely to brush harder with a manual toothbrush. Brushing too hard can damage gums and erode enamel from your teeth.\n\nNot brushing long enough: It's more difficult to know if you're brushing long enough for every session. The ADA recommends brushing for two minutes, twice a day.\n\nElectric\n\nPros\n\nMore effective at removing plaque: The oscillating heads and vibrations remove plaque without the need to brush hard.\n\nEasier for people with limited mobility: The automatic moving bristles do all the work.\n\nBuilt-in timers: Some models have timers to let you know if you've brushed long enough.\n\nLess waste: Replaceable heads means you throw away less plastic.\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive: Prices range anywhere from $15 to $250 per brush, not including the cost of the replacement heads.\n\nVibrations: Not everyone is a fan of the sound and feel of the vibrations.\n\nWhat to Consider when Buying Oral Care Products\n\nWith so many dental care products on the market, it can be hard to decide which products to use. Here are some things to consider when shopping for oral care products.\n\nYour oral care routine\n\nA healthy dental routine should consist of brushing your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and daily flossing and scheduling a professional cleaning with a hygienist twice a year. The right oral care products streamline your oral hygiene.\n\nSpecial oral care needs\n\nToothpaste's function depends on its active ingredients, such as baking soda or hydrogen peroxide for teeth whitening or fluoride and minerals for enamel protection. Toothbrushes are available with soft bristles for gentle cleansing of sensitive teeth. No matter what your needs are, there's an oral care product for you.\n\nFlavor\n\nToothpaste and floss are available in a multitude of refreshing flavors. The most popular flavors are spearmint and peppermint, but cinnamon and fruity flavors are fun choices for kids.\n\nBulk sizes\n\nSam's Club carries bulk sizes for toothbrushes, floss and many other oral care products at member's only prices.\n\nPrice\n\nOral care products are available in a range of prices at Sam's Club.\n\nWhat Brands of Oral Care Products Does Sam's Club Sell?\n\nSam's Club sells all the top brands of oral care products.\n\nCrest: A leading brand of toothpaste and other oral hygiene products made by Procter & Gamble (P&G).\n\nOral-B: Known for their quality toothbrushes, electric toothbrushes, mouthwashes and toothpaste.\n\nListerine: Top brand of antiseptic mouthwash that can kill up to 99.9% of the germs in your mouth.\n\nColgate: Primarily known for its line of toothpaste, Colgate has an entire line of quality oral hygiene products.\n\nPhillips: A leading health technology and the makers of Sonicare electric toothbrushes.\n\nWaterpik: A line of motorized flossers and toothbrushes uses a stream of pressurized, pulsating water to remove plaque, food particles and bacteria from teeth and gums.\n\nDazzlepro: A line of all-in-one cleaning and brightening oral care products\n\nSensodyne: Sensodyne toothpaste and mouthwash helps remineralized sensitive teeth.\n\nFAQ - Oral Care Products\n\nHow often should you brush your teeth?\n\nThe American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste for two minutes each time.\n\nHow to clean a toothbrush?\n\nRinse the brush thoroughly under warm or hot water before and after every brushing.\n\nHow to sanitize a toothbrush?\n\nYou should routinely disinfect your toothbrush to reduce the chance of bacteria buildup, especially after a cold or the flu.
