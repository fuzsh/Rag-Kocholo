        "text": "CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) also called HDMI Control, is a feature on most AVRs that allows for one button control of supported system functions. This feature may also be available on other CEC supported devices such as TVs or projectors. CEC can control power on/off functions, volume control and source switching by sending a command over the connected HDMI cables.\n\nFor CEC to work, all HDMI connected devices must have and support the CEC feature. If you experience AVR sources switching on their own or your AVR powering on or off when your TV is powered on or off, then it's a good bet that CEC is enabled in your AVR and TV. If you do not want these actions to occur please disable the HDMI Control option in the AVR's menu. (GUI: Video -> HDMI Setup -> HDMI Control)\n\nYou can also disable the AVR from automatically switching to the \"TV Audio\" source when a CEC command is detected. To do this, access the AVR's menu and select: Video -> HDMI Setup -> TV Audio Switching -> Off. Disabling this option means you will have to manually select the \"TV Audio\" source when using ARC (Audio Return Channel) with the AVR."
