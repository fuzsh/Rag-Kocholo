        "text": "Movies are an activity in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe player can watch movies by accessing one of the three cinemas in Los Santos.\n\nTivoli Cinema\n\nTen Cent Theater\n\nOriental Theater\n\nWhile the Cinema Doppler can be purchased by the player, movies cannot be seen there. Numerous other cinemas can be found in the city, but they cannot be accessed.\n\nThe player can also bring friends to movies while on activities. Entry costs $20 per person. Most movies are preceded by either a trailer for another film or an advisory about behaviour in the theatre. The player cannot move around once inside, but can move the camera to get a limited view of the theatre and see some of the other people attending the film. The cinema interiors are identical, but the number of people (if any) viewing the film will vary, though never more than a few individuals.\n\nThe movie shown will depend on what time of day the cinema is accessed and will not always correspond with what is on the marquee. The cinemas are unique among player-usable businesses in Grand Theft Auto V as they are not open 24 hours a day; between 10pm and 10am, they cannot be accessed. This also applies to Grand Theft Auto Online. In GTA V, the shown movie will always start from the beginning, whereas in GTA Online, the movies have set show times and thus it is common to enter a movie as it is in progress.\n\nOwing to the length of the films, they can continue to play well after the 10pm closing time, though the player can't re-enter the theater once the showing is over if it is late at night.\n\nIn GTA Online, owners of the Master Penthouse may also view two of the films (Meltdown and Loneliest Robot in Great Britain) in the optional Media Room.\n\nViewable Movies[]\n\nThe Loneliest Robot in Great Britain\n\nScreens from 10am to 12pm\n\nCapolavoro\n\nScreens from 1pm to 5pm\n\nMeltdown\n\nScreens from 6pm to 10pm (unlocks after the mission of the same title is completed)\n\nGallery[]\n\nUnviewable Movies[]\n\nDie Already 4 - A play on action films like Die Hard.\n\nI Married my Dad\n\nLos Santos 2020\n\nNeurotic Toys - Possibly a reference to the Toy Story series.\n\nThe Simian - A parody of disaster films like Rise of the Planet of the Apes. A trailer can be seen before Meltdown.\n\nSequel II - A play on movie sequels in general.\n\nWater Torture IX\n\nGlitch[]"
