        "text": "Brief History of the Van Buren Drive-In Theatre in Riverside, CA\n\nThe Van Buren Drive-In Theatre in Riverside, CA is a historic landmark that has been in operation since 1949. Located at 6250 Van Buren Boulevard, the theatre was originally built to accommodate 400 cars and has since been expanded to accommodate 700 cars. The theatre is named after its founder, Harry G. Van Buren, who owned and operated the theatre until his death in 1976.\n\nThe Van Buren Drive-In Theatre was one of the first drive-in theatres in Southern California and remained in operation until 2008 when it was closed due to declining attendance and competition from newer, multiplex movie theatres. In 2012, the City of Riverside reached a deal with developers to demolish the drive-in theatre and build a new shopping center on the property. However, due to public outcry, the city reversed its decision and instead entered into a long-term lease with a non-profit organization called Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO) with the intention of restoring the theatre to its former glory.\n\nAs of 2019, the Van Buren Drive-In Theatre is undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation project that includes new concession stands, restrooms, and an updated screening area with state-of-the-art digital projection and sound equipment. The renovation project is expected to be completed by 2020."
