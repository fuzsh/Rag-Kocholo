        "text": "U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert was escorted out of a Sunday night performance of the “Beetlejuice” musical in downtown Denver, accused by venue officials of vaping, singing, recording and “causing a disturbance” during the performance.\n\nIn an incident report shared with The Denver Post on Tuesday afternoon, officials with Denver Arts & Venues wrote that two patrons were asked to leave the city-owned Buell Theatre during the performance of the touring Broadway show. They previously were issued a warning during the intermission regarding behavior that prompted three complaints from other theatergoers, the report says.\n\nThe report does not name Boebert as one of the patrons or identify the other person. But her campaign office — while disputing the behavior alleged — confirmed that she was escorted from the Buell on Sunday night during the “Beetlejuice” show.\n\nThe incident report states that after receiving the intermission warning, about five minutes into the second act security officials received “another complaint about the patrons being loud and at the time (they) were recording.” Taking pictures or recording is not permitted at shows.\n\nThe report quotes one of the ushers: “They told me they would not leave. I told them that they need to leave the theater and if they do not, they will be trespassing. The patrons said they would not leave. I told them I would (be) going to get Denver Police. They said go get them.”\n\nThe Republican from Silt is running for a third time in 2024 to represent the 3rd Congressional District, which covers much of western and southern Colorado.\n\nDrew Sexton, the campaign manager for Boebert, told The Post that the second-term congresswoman denied vaping during the show. She did use her cellphone to take a picture of the performance, unaware that photos weren’t allowed.\n\n“I can confirm the stunning and salacious rumors: in her personal time, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is indeed a supporter of the performing arts (gasp!) and, to the dismay of a select few, enthusiastically enjoyed a weekend performance of ‘Beetlejuice,’ ” Sexton wrote in a statement. He noted that The Post’s review of the show last week described it as “zany,” “outrageous,” and a ‘lusty riot.’ ”\n\nBoebert, he wrote, encourages everyone to see the play and its “fantastic cast, tremendous visuals and plenty of loud laughs” — but, he added, “with a gentle reminder to leave their phones outside of the venue.”\n\nDenver Arts & Venues on Tuesday night released security video showing Boebert’s interactions with theater staff as she and her companion were escorted out:\n\nThe report said after the two patrons were escorted out and reached the building’s vestibule, they resisted leaving and said “stuff like ‘do you know who I am,’ ‘I am on the board’ (and) ‘I will be contacting the mayor.’ ”\n\nPolice arrived and stayed in the lobby of the Buell until Boebert and her companion left, according to the report.\n\nWhile Sunday’s incident was resolved without much trouble, Boebert has found herself in trouble before. She was arrested and summonsed at least four times in the years leading up to her election to Congress in 2020.\n\nIn her first month in office, Boebert — known as an avid defender of the Second Amendment — reportedly attempted to walk through newly installed metal detectors, which sounded as she did. She then refused to turn over her bag to Capitol Police, who in turn refused to let her enter House chambers, according to reporters on the scene.\n\nLast summer, her family made headlines when her husband reportedly threatened their neighbors during what the Garfield County sheriff described as a neighborhood disturbance. No arrests were made. In May, Boebert announced that she and her husband were divorcing.\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter."
