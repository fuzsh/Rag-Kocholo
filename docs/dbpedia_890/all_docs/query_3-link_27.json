We offer radio checkouts with a valid photo ID for $5.\n\nWe have a limited amount, so while supplies last! If you don’t want to rent a radio or use your car, bring a portable stereo or radio to use and tune into 89.9FM!\n\nYes! You may come to the first movie or the second if you wish. You will have to pay the same price regardless. If the box office is closed you can enter through the exit (carefully) and a parking attendant will direct you to the concession stand to pay.\n\nAt Golden Age Cinemas, McHenry Outdoor Theater, we do our best to ensure that everyone’s night is as fun and enjoyable as possible. In order to ensure that all cars have an adequate view of the screen we do have a few parking rules.\n\nGOLD POLES: Premier parking for any size vehicle in the front 2 rows for ONLY $5 per vehicle.\n\nRED POLES: Vehicles larger than 67″ will be required to park next to a red colored pole. Red poles are located near the outside, front, and back.\n\nSILVER POLES: Vehicles shorter than 67″ will be required to park next to a silver colored pole. Silver poles are located in the center of the lot.\n\nHATCHES: Any vehicle hatch that is blocking the view of those behind them may be asked to be lowered or shut."
