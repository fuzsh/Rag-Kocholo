To help preserve our historic theatre we’re asking for your help.\n\nFunds raised through this campaign will be specifically used for the purpose of repairing the broken neon tubes, replacing damaged and malfunctioning spot lamps and undertaking repairs to the theatre marquee message boards.\n\nFor a gift of $150.00 toward this campaign, we’ll post your message on the marquee! Please click the link below to find out more about this exciting opportunity and to help us to raise the funds we need to complete this restoration project!"
