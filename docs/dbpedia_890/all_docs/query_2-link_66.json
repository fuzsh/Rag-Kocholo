        "text": "Drive-In Theatre\n\nEnjoy a movie under the stars at our classic Drive-In theatre from 1957! It’s the last of its kind on Cape Cod, and one of about 300 left in the country. Come delight in this one-of-a-kind movie experience!\n\nAdvanced tickets via this link\n\nAdvanced tickets recommended & early arrival for best choice of spots, box office opens at 7PM!\n\nMini Golf Now Open! Play a round before the Show!\n\nFri 8/9 thru Thurs 8/15:\n\nINSIDE OUT 2\n\n(PG) 7:50 PM\n\n&\n\nDEADPOOL & WOLVERINE\n\n(R) 9:30PM\n\nTips\n\nPricing\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n& Other important Information\n\nTips for coming to the DRIVE-IN!\n\n[/expand]\n\nKnow what section to park in according to vehicle size\n\nIn order to try to give every customer a good view, we split up parking by car size. (Please note, it is at the discretion of the field crew and management to determine where your vehicle can park.)\n\nYellow poles: Make up most of the field and are for crossovers, SUV’s, minivans, trucks, and other vehicles of similar height, and also for smaller vehicles with cargo or equipment on the roof.\n\nGreen poles: Located in the very back row and along the side edges, anyone can park here, but mainly they’re for very large vehicles (ie. conversion vans) as well as large vehicles with any cargo, equipment, or racks on the roof (ie. an SUV with a cargo shell).\n\nWhite poles: Located in rows 3 through 5, this small section is reserved specifically for low height cars: sedans, coupes, convertibles, and some station wagons.\n\nCamper parking: In the very back (farthest from the screen) is a section for campers. An attendant can help you park.\n\nTune your radio to 89.5FM\n\nThis station allows you to hear the movie through your car speakers and provides the best sound quality. Worried about running out your car battery? See the next tip!\n\nKeep your car owner's manual handy\n\nIf using the radio to listen to the movie, you’ll need to know how to keep it on while keeping off headlights and other accessories in your vehicle– you may need your car manual for that. Additionally, every car has its quarks with headlights, alarm systems, automatic doors, interior lights, etc. It’s best to have the most accurate info handy to solve issues fast.\n\nRelax and enjoy the show!!\n\nPrices are per person:\n\nOnline Fee $1.50 per person\n\nGeneral Admission (12-61): $15.00\n\nChildren (4-11): $10.00\n\nSenior Citizens (62+): $12.00\n\nLittle ones 3 & under Free! (at DRIVE-IN ONLY)\n\n*Prices subject to change*\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. How does this work?\n\nA. Simply park your car in your designated area (see -above- for parking info), tune your radio to 89.5FM, and enjoy watching a couple of movies on our huge screen from the comfort of your own car!\n\nQ. Does the Drive-In still show in the rain?\n\nA. YES! Rainy nights have many advantages! The picture is actually crisper and clearer on a wet screen. Not to mention, fewer people come so you’ll have more parking options. You may need to run your wipers now and then, or you can back in and open up the hatch—though you may need some extra blankets. (Please be aware that we cannot control the elements and therefore cannot give passes for inclement weather.)\n\nQ. Can I buy tickets ahead of time or reserve a space?\n\nA. We sell advanced tickets for guarenteed admission, but not particular spaces. We advise early arrival for your best choice of space. We cannot allow customers to save spaces. Again, the best way to ensure you have a spot is to come early and park your vehicle.\n\nQ. Can I come for just one movie?\n\nA. Yes! If you come for the first movie you basically get the second one free, though you can leave at any time. You can also come just for the second movie as well, just be aware that if you drive in while the first movie is still running, please stay in the back of the theatre to be courteous to those customers who are already enjoying the show.\n\nQ. How do I listen to the movie?\n\nA. 89.5FM on your car radio will give you the best sound quality. Every vehicle has an option to keep your headlights and other accessories off, with the radio on in order to preserve the battery (“accessory” position of the ignition in older vehicles). See your car owner’s manual—and if the battery does run out, our staff has jumper boxes. We also have the original speaker boxes from 1957, which are fun and nostalgic, but functionality is not guaranteed. If you plan on using the field speakers test yours as soon as you arrive. There is a volume knob, turn it clockwise. You should hear the pre-show music. If you don’t, you may need to move (you must still park next to the proper post). Most speakers work in rows 2-15. Row 0 and 1 have under pavement wiring problems, so no speakers work for 0 and 1. We cannot repair speakers on the spot, but please inform a field crew member if you find one not working.\n\nQ. Is there food?\n\nA. Yes! Our snack bar, in the middle of the field, has concessions (popcorn, candy, nachos), grilled fare (burgers, hot dogs, chicken fingers), drinks (soda, coffee, juice) You can also walk out to the Dairy Bar for soft serve and hard ice cream.\n\nQ. What about bathrooms?\n\nA. Of course! They’re located of either side of the snack bar.\n\nQ. Can I walk out for ice cream and/or mini-golf?\n\nA. Yes!!! A staff member will give you a “re-admittance pass” on your way out.\n\nQ. Can I back my car into a spot?\n\nA. Yes! If you want to put your hatch up, it must remain level with the roof of your car so it doesn’t block other customers behind you. Our staff has string to tie down the hatch and will be happy to assist you.\n\nQ. Can we use lawn chairs?\n\nA. Only if they are directly in front of your vehicle—this is a safety precaution. Also, be aware that you may not be able to see the screen as well and we cannot move another vehicle to accommodate your view. Lawn chairs that sit a little higher off the ground tend to work better.\n\nQ. Is ball-playing allowed?\n\nA. in the very front or very back of the field for any ball-playing or similar activities.\n\nPlease note the following actions are PROHIBITED:\n\nThe use of bicycles, skateboards, roller blades, scooters, etc. are prohibited. This is a safety precaution, as the drive-in area is an active parking lot, and can be even more dangerous in the dark.\n\nBeing on the roof of any vehicle is prohibited. This is both for safety and ensures you do not block the view of other customers behind you.\n\nRunning your vehicle is prohibited. Vehicle emissions are poisonous to those around you.\n\nCooking, Grills, and Fires of any kind are prohibited, as per the town fire marshal.\n\nThe use of car horns is prohibited, as is setting off car alarms. Please be aware of how to disarm your car in order to keep noise to a minimum.\n\nObscene language or profanity directed at any staff member or patron will not be tolerated and will result in immediate ejection.\n\nEntering the premise without paying admission is illegal. Anyone who “sneaks in” will be removed with all persons in the vehicle, without refund or recompense to any individual. Management reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to allow re-entry by any person caught entering the premises without paying admission, or who participates in or facilitates such entry, upon payment of the full admisson price.\n\nKeep your foot off the brake, the lights bother other patrons.\n\nPlease keep the sound to a reasonable volume, our neighbors need tranquility"
