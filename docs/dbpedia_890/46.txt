Be astonished by the mystery surrounding the remarkable Sauto Theater, located in Matanzas

The Teatro Sauto Theater is one of the three main Classical theaters in Cuba. Located on the south side of the Plaza de la Vigía Square of Matanzas, its impressive figure dominates the entire area.

Dating back to 1863, it was designed and built by Italian architect Diego Dell Aglio. In 2011 it had to be refurbished in order to repair the deterioration it had suffered.

The Sauto Theater can house up to 775 spectators, and has a rounded stage that when lifted converts the auditorium into a ballroom.

The construction was built following a Neoclassical style, predominantly the Greek Ionic and Doric classical order.

While contemplating its interior, you’ll find Greek marble statues everywhere, and if you look up, you’ll find frescos and their muses.

The perfection of the construction and its magnificent acoustics make the Sauto Theater a wonderful place where amazing pieces of art are exhibited.

Among some the most important people in the world of art that have performed here is Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova.
