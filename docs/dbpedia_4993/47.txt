Wells Fargo

Founded in 1852, Wells Fargo & Company is a multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California. It is the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by assets of $1.5 trillion and the largest bank by market capitalization. The company also has been rated as the second largest bank in deposits, debit cards and home mortgage servicing.

History

Wells Fargo built its financial entity through a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998. The merger seemed a strategic and farsighted move in its preserving the Wells Fargo's name and trademark âstagecoachâ for the maximum capital value.

At the time after the first acquisition, the company's operation still was confined in in-store branches. There were many such branches located inside commercial buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually are equipped with basic teller services, ATMs, and, if space permits, an office for private meetings with customers.

The formation of the current Wells Fargo financial business started from the controversial buying of Charlotte-based Wachovia. October 3, 2008, Wachovia conceded the agreement of acquisition from Wells Fargo for about $14.8B in an all-stock transaction. This news arrived rightly four days after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to endorse Citigroup to buy Wachovia for $2.1B. Regardless of Citigroup's protest and threat to take legal action, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia 7 times over Citigroup's offer. Furthermore, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo with preferred stock holding 39.9% of the voting power in the company to win more of the shareholder approval.

The acquisition evoked New York state judge issuing a temporary injunction, while the whole event ended with Wells Fargo's incontestable triumph and Citigroup's acquiescent retreat.

Since then, the company has grown from a chain of small banks in Midwest into a national company with a growing global presence, providing banking, mortgage, insurance, investments, and consumer and commercial finance through more than 9,000 localities, around 13,000 ATMs, online, and mobile devices.

Cross-selling

A substantial part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling. Itâs a practice to build customer loyalty buy encouraging them to purchase extended banking products. Customers questioning about their banking account may be suggested with mortgage deals, while mortgage holders can possibly be offered credit card, all for the increasing of the customer's profitability to the bank, and to make it less possible for the customer opt for different bank. Other banks have attempted to follow Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices though with no excellence.

Vision and Value

The company vision is customer satisfaction in their financial needs and economic success. As stated in company reports, the vision has nothing to do with mere business, promoting products or acquiring size for the sake of bigness. It's about building lifelong relationships one customer at a time.

Besides the distinctive vision statement, Wells Fargo has five primary values that are based on its vision and provides the foundation for everything they do. The five values are, People as a competitive advantage, Ethics, What's right for customers, Diversity and inclusion, Leadership.

People

Wells Fargo perceives its employees as team members, rather than individuals that are being hired. The management well understands people naturally aspire to a larger purpose beyond themselves. They want to become treasured resource to be invested in, not expenses to be avoided. Thus seeing a person as a member, building a teamwork spirit are essential to the success in helping customers. The ideal is, Wells Fargo is a relationship company, and the relationships with the customers are only as strong as the relationships with each other. The team members are the most important constituents because theyâre the single most important influence on customers. The company is building the team members to be customers, too.

Ethics

Trust, honesty, and business integrity are essence to reach the highest aspiration of corporate governance. This is even more important in the banking industry because everything that is being done is built on trust. It will not happen with one occasion of a successful business transaction, will not happen in one day or even in one quarter. It's a earned relationship by genuinely constructed relationship. The company, the management, the whole team have to earn that trust every day by behaving ethically; rewarding open, honest, reciprocal communication; and holding themselves accountable for the decisions made and actions taken.

What's right for customers

The customers, external and internal, are friends on coach. The company is advocating and representing its customers' best interests. The promise is assured to protect customers confidential information for their own business purpose, excluding any chance for discredited commercial convenience.

Diversity and Inclusion

It's a strategic imperative that lets the company take advantage of the creativity and innovation that can only be availed from multiple perspectives and allows quick and effective response to customer needs here at home and all across the globe. It's a value also to help to understand customers more comprehensively, perceive business opportunities in new ways and excel in serving the needs of company's growing customer segments.

Diverse representation alone is not the desired outcome. An inclusive culture that is accommodating differences and open to new ideas that is helpful to create a competitive edge in the marketplace is also being cultivated. Otherwise, the true value of diversity will go unrealized.

The company's diversity and inclusion strategy is implemented as: Diverse segment outreach. Diverse Segments team reaches out to diverse communities to help better serve and earn more business from South America, Asian and African American, lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender, Women, People with Disabilities and other important communities.

Supplier diversity

The company integrates supplier diversity into its overall vendor sourcing process, boosting economic development and encouraging job creation in the diverse communities it serves.

Diversity councils

The company's CEO chairs the company's Enterprise Diversity Council, which consists senior executives from across all the divisions and branches of Wells Fargo. Regional and line-of-business diversity councils are also established to support the company's diversity and inclusion efforts.

Leadership

In Wells Fargo, all are called to be leadersâto be the link between the vision of Wells Fargo and its customers. It's not the strongest or most intelligent who survive in this industry but rather those who best adapt to change. Wells Fargo defines leadership as the act of establishing, sharing, and communicating its vision and the art of motivating others to understand and embrace the vision. The company believes, everyone can be a leader.
