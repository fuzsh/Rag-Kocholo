        "text": "History\n\nWells Fargo & Company was founded in 1852 by Henry Wells and William G. Dorman as a banking firm in New York City. In 1864, it merged with another bank to become the National Bank of Commerce. The following year, it moved its headquarters to San Francisco, California during the Gold Rush. In 1903, it became the first bank to use an ATM (automated teller machine) which allowed customers to withdraw cash without interacting with a human teller. During the Great Depression, Wells Fargo played a significant role in providing relief to struggling farmers through its Farm Credit System. After World War II, the company expanded into new markets such as insurance and real estate brokerage. In 1970, it acquired the brokerage firm Wachovia Securities and changed its name to Wells Fargo & Co. In recent years, the company has faced criticism for its involvement in foreclosure practices and settlements related to the mortgage crisis.\n\nBusiness model and operations\n\nWells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, insurance, and mortgage products and services to individuals, businesses, and institutions.\n\nThe company operates through three main segments: Community Banking, Wholesale Banking, and Wealth Management. The Community Banking segment provides retail banking services, including checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit cards, primarily in the western United States.

They also have a variety of business-specific banking solutions for small businesses, mid-size companies, and large corporations. Additionally, they provide merchant services such as payment processing and point-of-sale systems. Overall, Wells Fargo strives to be a one-stop-shop for all of their customers’ financial needs.\n\nFinancial performance\n\nWells Fargo & Company has consistently ranked among the top 10 banks in the United States based on assets.\n\nIn recent years, the company has faced several financial challenges due to scandals and regulatory issues. In 2018, it was fined $1 billion by regulators for opening unauthorized accounts for customers and engaging in other fraudulent practices. This led to a decline in earnings and revenue for the bank.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Wells Fargo remains one of the largest banks in the world, with total assets exceeding $1 trillion as of 2021. The company continues to focus on its core businesses, including commercial banking, consumer banking, and wealth management, while also investing heavily in technology and innovation to stay competitive in the marketplace.\n\nLeadership and management\n\nLeadership and Management\n\nWells Fargo & Company has a diverse leadership team that is committed to driving innovation and growth.
