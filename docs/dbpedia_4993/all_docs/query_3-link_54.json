        "text": "Wells Fargo Center History\n\nThe Wells Fargo Center, one of the busiest arenas in the world, is home of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League, the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association, and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League. After opening its doors for the first time with the World Cup of Hockey on August 31, 1996, the Wells Fargo Center has hosted a variety of nationally-recognized events, including:\n\n1998 U.S. Figure Skating Championships\n\n1999 AHL All-Star Weekend\n\n2000 NCAA Women’s Final Four\n\n2000 Republican National Convention\n\n2001 NCAA Men’s East Regional\n\n2001 NBA Finals\n\n2001 and 2002 ESPN X-Games\n\n2002 NBA All-Star Weekend\n\n2006 NCAA Men’s First and Second Rounds\n\n2008 U.S. Gymnastics Championships\n\n2009 NCAA Men’s First and Second Round Tournament Games\n\n1997 and 2010 Stanley Cup Final\n\n2011 NCAA Wrestling Championships\n\n2013 NCAA Men's Basketball Second and Third Round Tournament Games\n\n2014 NCAA Frozen Four\n\n2016 NCAA Men's Basketball East Regional Tournament Games\n\nSpectrum History\n\nThe Spectrum opened its doors to thousands of events from September 30, 1967, to its closing on October 31, 2009. From NHL to NBA championships with the Flyers and 76ers, to Dorothy Hamill’s first appearance with the Ice Capades and Elvis Presley’s last live performance, the building, known as America's Showplace, hosted just about everything.\n\nConstruction of the arena occurred at a rapid pace so that the city’s first National Hockey League franchise, the Philadelphia Flyers, could compete in the 1967-68 NHL season. Eleven months later, the Spectrum opened house for its first event ever, the Quaker City Jazz Festival. The two-day concert appeared from September 30 to October 1, 1967.\n\n“This building was just an idea 16 months ago”, said Ed Snider at the time. “We got it done in record time.”\n\nFirst night patrons fought huge traffic tie-ups going into the parking lots, delaying the jazz festival by fifty-five minutes.\n\nThe last of six main acts, which included Ramsey Lewis, Hugh Masakela and comedian Flip Wilson, did not finish until 3 a.m. The second performance drew a full house of 17,500 fans. It was the largest indoor audience in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania history. A 12-day run of Holiday on Ice followed. Boxing was the first sporting event at the young building, featuring a Joe Frazier vs. Tony Doyle card, on Tuesday, October 17, 1967.\n\nThe next morning, the official dedication of the Spectrum took place under a canopy by the main entrance. The 76ers played their first game at the Spectrum that night, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, 103-87.\n\nThe Flyers debuted in their new home on Thursday, October 19, 1967 with a 1-0 triumph over Pittsburgh."
