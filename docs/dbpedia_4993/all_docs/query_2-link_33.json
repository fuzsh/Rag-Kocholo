        "text": "Samuel A. Ramirez\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nRamirez & Co.\n\nMy parents were both born in Puerto Rico. I was a page on the New York Stock Exchange. That was my first job on Wall Street.\n\nWith $50,000 and a dream, I started Ramirez and Company investment banking December 1971. My first employee was my wife. I had a handful of accounts.\n\nA good friend felt that Ramirez was very ethnic. He thought it would hurt us doing business. My parents were proud of that name, Ramirez. And I decided, why not Ramirez?\n\nSamuel A. Ramirez, Jr.\n\nCEO\n\nRamirez Asset Management\n\nWhen my father founded the firm, Wall Street was an old boys club.\n\nWe have traditionally had to work twice as hard and for probably less than some of the guys showing up with the top-six business card.\n\nOur biggest areas of business are our municipal bond area. We were the first diverse firm to be given the opportunity to be a co-manager on a New York City transaction, and that was in 1987.\n\nToday, we compete against the biggest banks in the world on a daily basis and we're usually top 10 to 15 in the country.\n\nRandall Lacayo\n\nHead of Diverse Segments\n\nWells Fargo Corporate & Investment Banking\n\nToday Ramirez is the oldest Hispanic-owned investment bank in Wall Street.\n\nWe've brought them in as co-managers on a number of deals for corporate clients. And Ramirez introduces us to clients that we otherwise would have not encountered.\n\nBack to Sam Junior\n\nWe've been in 40 transactions for Wells Fargo over the last 10 years. It's really a partnership that I think has risen to a level of being strategic.\n\nWall Street's becoming a place where people are celebrating diversity.\n\nBack to Randall\n\nIn 2021, Wells Fargo was the first among the nation's six biggest banks to use investment banks owned by minorities and women as joint bookrunners in a debt capital markets transaction.\n\nTo be able to see that transformation, as a Hispanic and part of the LGBTQ community, really means a lot to me.\n\nBack to Sam Junior\n\nI think my father was a trailblazer. And I think there's a lot of trailblazing left to do.\n\nForging What’s Next\n\nSponsored by Wells Fargo bloomberg.com/forgingwhatsnext\n\nWells Fargo Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) and Wells Fargo Securities (WFS) are the trade names used for the corporate banking, capital markets, and investment banking services of Wells Fargo & Company and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, member of NYSE, FINRA, NFA, and SIPC, Wells Fargo Prime Services, LLC, member of FINRA, NFA and SIPC, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., member NFA and swap dealer registered with the CFTC and security-based swap dealer registered with the SEC, member FDIC.
