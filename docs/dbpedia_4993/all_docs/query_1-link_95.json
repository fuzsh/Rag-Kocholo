        "text": "Once upon a time, in 1970, long before America’s banking system was dominated by six giant institutions—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—Dennis Hambek started working as a messenger at the National Bank of Washington in Ellensburg, Washington. Over the years, as his career advanced from messenger to loan officer to branch manager, he had a front-row seat at the transformation of America’s banking system. That first year, the National Bank of Washington was swallowed up by Pacific National Bank of Seattle, which in 1981 was bought by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, which in 1996 was bought by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which in 1999—as the consolidation frenzy was reaching its peak—merged with Norwest, a Minneapolis-based bank, in a $34 billion deal.\n\nWells Fargo, which was founded in 1852 as a stagecoach express to carry valuable goods to and from the gold mines in the West, had a storied brand, so the new, combined company kept that name. But if Norwest’s name didn’t survive, its corporate culture did. Spearheaded by the company’s then C.E.O., Dick Kovacevich, it involved a novel way of thinking about banking.\n\nAs Kovacevich told me in a 1998 profile of him I wrote for Fortunemagazine, the key question facing banks was “How do you sell money?” His answer was that financial instruments—A.T.M. cards, checking accounts, credit cards, loans—were consumer products, no different from, say, screwdrivers sold by Home Depot. In Kovacevich’s lingo, bank branches were “stores,” and bankers were “salespeople” whose job was to “cross-sell,” which meant getting “customers”—not “clients,” but “customers”—to buy as many products as possible. “It was his business model,” says a former Norwest executive. “It was a religion. It very much was the culture.”\n\nIt was underpinned by the financial reality that customers who had, say, lines of credit and savings accounts with the bank were far more profitable than those who just had checking accounts. In 1997, prior to Norwest’s merger with Wells Fargo, Kovacevich launched an initiative called “Going for Gr-Eight,” which meant getting the customer to buy eight products from the bank. The reason for eight? “It rhymes with GREAT!” he said.\n\nThis slogan, however, as experienced by bankers on the ground such as Hambek, was more hard-core than hokey. “We had a lot of longtime customers and a good staff, but the sales pressure kept mounting, mounting, mounting,” Hambek says. “Every morning, we had a conference call with all the managers. You were supposed to tell them how you were going to make your sales goal for the day, and if you didn’t, you’d have to call in the afternoon to explain why you didn’t make it and how you were going to fix it. It was really tense.” Achieving sales goals wasn’t easy. Ellensburg is a small town, and there were seven other banks.\n\nVIDEO: Preet Bharara on Policing Wall Street, the Mob, and More\n\nThat’s when Hambek began to see things that shouldn’t have been happening: bankers persuading customers to take out large loans and then immediately repay part of them so that the banker could get credit for the bigger loan, for instance. In the summer of 2005, a customer named Bill Moore complained to Hambek about a checking account and a savings account—that he had been given but hadn’t asked for and didn’t want. Hambek investigated and discovered that the banker who opened them had entered Moore’s driver’s-license number as “MOOREWF00000” and the date of issuance as January 1, 2000, a holiday when the Washington State Department of Licensing would have been closed, as shown by documents first obtained by Vice News.\n\n“Gaming,” which was defined in the Wells Fargo Code of Ethics as “the manipulation and/or misrepresentation of sales or referrals . . . in an attempt to receive compensation or to meet sales goals,” was supposed to be a big no-no, so Hambek called the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and he told his supervisor what he’d found. “I said, ‘This is blatant gaming,’ ” he recalls, but nobody seemed to care. Later that summer, after 35 years of service, he retired in order to avoid being fired for lack of productivity.\n\nOn December 27, 2005, Hambek sent a letter via certified mail to Carrie Tolstedt, who had become the head of regional banking at Wells Fargo in 2002. In the letter, which would have been passed on to the bank’s legal department, he described the gaming he’d witnessed, and told her that employees were leaving. “It would behoove someone to survey these employees as to the true reason they left the company.” He added, “Upper management is also aware of this, as is the ethics line, yet no action has been taken.”\n\nHambek never got a response to his letter. (Wells Fargo had no comment on this matter.)\n\nIn the ensuing decade, the big banks got even bigger. Wells Fargo swallowed up Wachovia during the financial crisis, to become the country’s third-largest bank by assets, and its soaring stock made it worth almost $300 billion. John Stumpf, a native Minnesotan who could have played a modern George Bailey, took over as C.E.O. when Kovacevich retired, at the end of 2007. He, like Kovacevich, repeatedly cited Wells Fargo’s success at cross-selling as a reason investors should value the bank’s stock—and they believed. “In the eyes of Wall Street, Wells has always been a cut above,” says one longtime bank investor. Unlike the other big banks, it positioned itself as “the bank of the real economy,” i.e., its major business was retail banking for everyday folks, not trading or investment banking for sophisticated investors. It helped that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has long been the bank’s biggest shareholder.\n\nDon’t Bank on It\n\nBut the pretty picture masked a dark reality. On September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a combined $185 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (C.F.P.B.), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the City and County of Los Angeles to settle charges from all three that, as the C.F.P.B. put it, there had been “fraudulent conduct . . . on a massive scale.” (As part of the agreement Wells Fargo admitted no wrongdoing.)\n\nWells Fargo’s own analysis found that between 2011 and 2015 its employees had opened more than 1.5 million deposit accounts and more than 565,000 credit-card accounts that may not have been authorized. Some customers were charged fees on accounts they didn’t know they had, and some customers had collection agencies calling them due to unpaid fees on accounts they didn’t know existed. Gaming was so widespread that it had even spawned related terms, such as “pinning,” which meant assigning customers personal-identification numbers, or PINs, without their knowledge in order to impersonate them on Wells Fargo computers and enroll them in various products without their knowledge. The fraud was not only big, but blatant, with 193,000 non-employee accounts opened between 2011 and 2015 for which the only e-mail domain name listed was @wellsfargo.com, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office.\n\nIn light of all this, the $185 million fine was a pittance—less than Tolstedt and Stumpf had made in the previous five years and a mere 3 percent of second-quarter profits. And Wells, which also announced that it had fired some 1,000 mainly junior employees for gaming, clearly thought it had disposed of a nuisance issue.\n\nBut that was hardly the end of it. Suddenly Wells Fargo employees, such as Hambek, came forward in droves, and America got mad in a way that we hadn’t over other financial scandals. “I think the public expects international financial banks to lose billions in nefarious ways,” says Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point, a prominent boutique investment bank. “But learning that the American checking account has been co-opted has insidious wrinkles. This is supposed to be one of the most trusted things in the world.”\n\nAt congressional hearings in which John Stumpf’s appealing midwestern diffidence suddenly seemed like appalling arrogance, representatives from both sides of the aisle let loose. “Fraud is fraud. Theft is theft,” thundered Texas Republican congressman Jeb Hensarling, “and what happened at Wells Fargo over the course of many years cannot be described any other way.”\n\nNothing changed, so Guitron requested meetings with more senior executives. Overall, she claimed that during her tenure at Wells Fargo she raised concerns on more than 100 occasions, including about a dozen calls to the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and on no fewer than 37 occasions she provided records that supported her complaints. Guitron alleges that her managers began to retaliate, making it harder for her to meet her sales goals. She was fired in January 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Guitron, along with another employee, Judi Klosek, who had made similar complaints, filed a whistle-blower lawsuit. The account printouts Guitron had collected were filed with the court, as were depositions from many other Wells Fargo employees. To cite but two: Irene Perez, who was the lead teller at the St. Helena branch from 2008 to 2011, claimed, “Everyone at the branch . . . was aware of the unethical conduct of bankers.”\n\n“It was normal business practices to use false identification on accounts and to change customers’ names and open new accounts,” said Dreydy Metelin, another personal banker at the branch, in her deposition. “Management made it clear that no employee was allowed to complain about the unethical practices that were going on within the branch.”\n\nMorally Bankrupt\n\nIn 2012, the court ruled in Wells Fargo’s favor, mainly because Wells presented “clear and convincing evidence” that Guitron had, in fact, failed to meet her sales goals, so she would have been fired anyway. She appealed and lost again on the same basis. Her legal bills were more than $42,000, but the court reduced them to $18,675.70 based in part on the “significant difference between Wells Fargo’s resources and Guitron’s ability to pay.” (Wells Fargo would not comment on this matter.)\n\nJulie Tishkoff, an administrative assistant to a Wells Fargo regional president, said, according to her discrimination complaint, that around the same time, in 2005, she observed “fraudulent banking practices,” including bank employees’ “forging customer signatures and fraudulent[ly] opening accounts for customers without their knowledge or consent” and soliciting elderly or otherwise vulnerable customers to take out lines of credit even though they didn’t understand the product.\n\nInevitably, customers began to sue, too. In the fall of 2013, David Douglas filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo and three local employees, alleging that Wells bankers had opened eight accounts he didn’t want or know about, funding them with money from his legitimate accounts. Douglas contacted a Wells Fargo fraud investigator, who assured him they would look into it—but no one ever got back to him. His lawyer, Michael Kade, is currently also representing nine former Wells Fargo employees in a suit against the bank due to go to trial in the fall.\n\nThe lawsuits continued to pile up, and a journalist finally noticed. In December 2013, E. Scott Reckard, then a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, wrote an article titled “Wells Fargo’s Pressure-Cooker Sales Culture Comes at a Cost.” He made the point that the “relentless pressure to sell has battered employee morale and led to ethical breaches, customer complaints and labor lawsuits.” The article caught the eye of Mike Feuer, a Harvard-trained lawyer and politician who had become the Los Angeles city attorney. He was shocked by the revelations in the piece, but he didn’t have subpoena power. So he asked his staff to investigate by doing what he calls “good old-fashioned detective work”—conducting dozens of interviews with current and former Wells Fargo employees and customers, going through court documents, and searching the C.F.P.B. and Federal Trade Commission consumer-complaint databases.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (O.C.C.), which is Wells Fargo’s regulator, also started to get complaints from customers and employees. One of the plaintiffs, Yasmeen Fasheh, began working at a Wells branch in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000. She alleged in a recently filed lawsuit that the pressure to cross-sell resulted in employees’ “impersonating customers” on Wells Fargo computers in order to enroll them in services without their consent, and selling to older customers on the belief that they wouldn’t review their bank statements. She alleged that she finally contacted Lefky Mansi, Wells’s longtime area president for Los Angeles. “You’re just a little ant in the company,” Fasheh alleges he responded. “If I’m going down, you’re going down, as well.” She called human resources too, which, she claims, told her “they were aware that these practices were occurring throughout the company, but there was nothing they could do.” (Wells Fargo declined to comment.)\n\nThe Names of the Games\n\nKen Mac, who worked at Wells Fargo’s Arcadia, California, branch over the summer of 2013, calls his brief stint at Wells “the lowest point of my life.” Mac, a fluent Chinese speaker, says that he got an elderly Chinese woman to sign up for a credit card she didn’t want by telling her “it was confirmation that she stopped by to update her address. I felt sick in my stomach,” he says, “but it was a tough economy, and I was worried, if I lost this job, I would be in a tough financial situation.”\n\nIvan Rodriguez worked at three Wells Fargo branches in California, starting in 2007, and was quickly promoted to be a banker. There was pressure right away, but he knew he was in a sales job, and he thought, It is what it is. But he saw things: bankers changing customers’ phone numbers in the system so, if they complained, no one could get in touch with them; online banking accounts for elderly customers who didn’t know how to use computers. But the worst, he says, was the shredding. In order to get a signature on an account a customer didn’t want, bankers would cut a signature out of an existing account, scan that through, and then shred the evidence. They never got caught, because, in the branches he worked at, the manager would get 24 hours’ notice before Wells Fargo’s auditors came through. Indeed, according to a Wall Street Journal story, the advance notice that auditors were coming was common among Wells’s roughly 6,000 branches; more than a dozen employees told the Journal they’d either forged or seen colleagues forge signatures or shred the papers. (Wells Fargo has said it would eliminate the 24-hour notice of auditor visits.)\n\nOn May 4, 2015, after his investigators had worked the case for 16 months, Feuer, the L.A. city attorney, filed a civil enforcement case against Wells. In the days following, his office got calls and e-mails from more than a thousand Wells Fargo customers and current and former employees describing a “veritable litany of horrific experiences,” as Jim Clark, Feuer’s chief deputy, put it to Congress.\n\n“Anecdotally, the feeling is that everyone knew,” says Jonathan Delshad, a lawyer who has filed a case on behalf of former Wells Fargo employees, and who says that more than 800 people have called his firm. “The better they did at sales, the more they advanced, so it got spread across the company. An entire generation of managers thrived in the culture, got rewarded for it, and are now in positions of power.”\n\nDelshad’s conclusion is echoed in a report done by Wells Fargo’s independent board members, which was released on April 10. “To many employees, the route to success was selling more than your peers,” the report stated.\n\nEven after the L.A. Times story, there were no dramatic changes. “What has mystified everybody and anybody, what other bank managements have asked me, is why, when the L.A. Times story hit, did you not rip the place apart and find out who was pushing these practices?” asks Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who has covered Wells Fargo for over three decades.\n\nThe potential for problems was inherent in the strategy Dick Kovacevich created. Or, as Dennis Hambek says, “I think what Dick Kovacevich implemented was John Stumpf’s downfall.”\n\nKovacevich was a larger-than-life C.E.O. As a Stanford baseball player, he sustained a shoulder injury that thwarted his plan to play in the major leagues. Instead, he earned an M.B.A. and started his career selling consumer products such as toys for General Mills. In the mid-1970s, he was recruited by Walter Wriston, of Citicorp, where he helped change the face of banking by rolling out Citi’s then revolutionary A.T.M.’s. But he was passed over for the top consumer job and was lured to Norwest in 1986. Looking back, a longtime Wells analyst says he is struck by the “enigma” that was Kovacevich. He exuded midwestern values, and in 1993, the year he became C.E.O., he began publishing the Wells Fargo Vision & Values, which featured such homilies as “In hiring, we really don’t care how much a person knows until we know how much they care.” But he also called financial services “the ultimate team sport,” and was extraordinarily intense and aggressive—even arrogant to some. “He was one of the most competitive people I have ever known,” says an executive who used to play tennis with him. “We were evenly matched, but he would win because winning was more important to him than it was to me—and I am competitive!”\n\nAlthough Kovacevich stressed ethics, he also said the most important metric of success was revenue growth. But calling a client a customer and a branch a store had a dark side, as the former executive points out, because it implicitly downgrades the bank’s level of responsibility toward its clients. Yet Kovacevich argued that “when customers vote with their pocket books, we know we’re doing something right.”\n\nStumpf was a different character, more affable than arrogant. “If you were writing a movie script, this is not the guy you would want to play the villain,” says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo. Stumpf was Minnesotan, through and through. He grew up on a farm, one of 11 children, and after college he worked as a repo man. “What got John most excited was talking about his days as a repo man,” says an investor who knows him well. “He has these vivid stories of repossessing cars while another guy would be the lookout guy.” Unlike Kovacevich, who would tell his executives, “The only thing I want to hear is bad news,” Stumpf seemed to be proud that the culture was one of “Minnesota nice.” He “was not perceived within Wells Fargo as someone who wanted to hear bad news or deal with conflict,” noted the board report.\n\nNor was he the kind of C.E.O. to question Dick Kovacevich’s script. Indeed, he appropriated much of it. When asked why Wells Fargo had a cross-selling goal of eight, he’d say, “The answer is: it rhymed with ‘great!’ ”\n\nHe was liked by investors—what wasn’t to like?—but for better and worse, he didn’t have the presence that Kovacevich had had. He was less self-aggrandizing, but he also seemed to some to be more of a big-picture C.E.O. than one who was enmeshed in the dirty minutiae of operations. “I never felt he had a detailed grip on the intricacies of the business,” says an investor. “There was nothing remarkable about the guy,” says another investor. “I always thought [until the scandal] that he was dealt a really good hand.”\n\nParadoxically the hard-core sales culture seemed to intensify once Stumpf took over. In 2010, both the compensation and performance ratings systems were rejiggered so that they were associated with sales goals. Bankers, branch managers, and district managers risked pay cuts and poor performance reviews if they didn’t hit the goals, noted the board report, and employees were ranked against one another.\n\nThe pressure was greatest in California, Arizona, and Florida. Pam Conboy, who ran Wells’s Arizona regional banking from 2007 to 2017 and who had taken Arizona from last place to first in sales rankings, gave a presentation at a 2010 leadership conference in which she encouraged the use of “morning huddles” to discuss the previous day’s sales reports, and told district managers they should call to check on branches multiple times a day. Another executive, named Shelley Freeman, who ran the Los Angeles region until 2009, and then Florida, would have district managers “run the gauntlet”: each would have to dress up in a themed costume and run down the line to a whiteboard to report the number of sales they had achieved. According to the board report, on a per-employee basis, the reports of sales-practice misconduct tripled from the second quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nKovacevich told someone who knows him that he would never have tolerated this treatment of employees, which he has described as “harassment.” He has called the issues during his tenure “infinitesimal.”\n\nJob Wells Done\n\nStumpf had risen through the ranks, and so did Carrie Tolstedt, the daughter of a baker who had started her career at Norwest in Nebraska, in 1986. She and Stumpf were a symbiotic pair. Tolstedt wasn’t flashy either, and impressed investors as a detail-oriented, hardworking operator; a former Wells executive says she “worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.” Stumpf’s support for her was extraordinary. He thought “she was the ‘most brilliant’ Community Banker he had ever met,” the board report noted. In return she delivered the numbers he wanted to see.\n\nTolstedt told investors that customers who had five products with Wells Fargo were three times as profitable as those with three products, while those with eight products were five times as profitable. Additionally, the more accounts a customer had, the less likely it was that he or she would switch to another bank paying higher rates of interest. One investor argues that was a key reason that Wells, for years, had a lower cost of funds than its peers. This was a critical advantage because it allowed Wells to price loans lower than other big banks could and still make the same profit. Said Warren Buffett in a 2009 interview, “The key to the future of Wells is continuing to get the money in at very low costs.”\n\nWells’s stock price soared, and Tolstedt, whose salary was $1.75 million, received more than $20 million in annual bonuses from 2010 to 2015, which was justified in part by the “record cross-sell results” in her division, said Wells in its financial filings. But Stumpf and the rest of the executive team, and soon the board, knew there were issues. It wasn’t just the press and the Los Angeles city attorney. In 2011, a group of bankers who were terminated for sales violations wrote a letter to Stumpf, arguing that their actions had not only been condoned by management in their branch, but that similar things were happening across the bank. Multiple task forces were convened. Lisa Stevens, who became the head of the West Coast region in 2010 and reported directly to Tolstedt, was complaining by 2012 to the bank’s corporate chief risk officer, Mike Loughlin, about “unrealistic sales goals and her frustration with Community Bank leadership,” according to the board report.\n\nWells did take some small steps, and by at least some measures, the sales problem did begin improving in 2013. But Wells’s response was incremental, not Draconian. One explanation is that executives failed to see the scope of the problem because of the way Wells Fargo was structured. Kovacevich had always run the company in a decentralized way, so much so that he’d refer to himself as a “C.E.O. of C.E.O.’s.” Functions such as risk management, legal, and human resources were not run at the corporate level, and employees reported to, say, the head of Community Banking, or the head of Wells’s much smaller business bank. This meant that Tolstedt, in effect, had her own empire, with her own risk-management head, Claudia Russ Anderson, reporting to her, rather than to anyone at the corporate level.\n\nFor corporate executives, the structural difficulty of seeing inside the retail bank was complicated by Tolstedt herself. “She is widely viewed as building a community bank and making it a business success—and it was,” says one person who is familiar with Wells Fargo. “But by all accounts she was mercurial, very wary of others, and apparently not the type that wanted bad news to surface.”\n\nShe viewed the sales model as the key to the community bank’s success, and didn’t want to take any steps that might “impede its operation,” noted the board report, which also alleged she was “obsessed with control.” For instance, when Tolstedt found out that Lisa Stevens had been complaining, she told Stevens to “toe the line.” (Tolstedt declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIt’s convenient now to place the blame on Tolstedt and on Wells’s model, but that’s not the whole truth. Kovacevich, for his part, noted to someone who knows him that the fact that Stevens was complaining was proof that the decentralized model worked. It’s just that no one in leadership wanted to hear it, or as the board report noted, “Many observers expressed their belief that Tolstedt operated the Community Bank in the way she did because she thought Stumpf would approve.”\n\nAnd he did, wholeheartedly. After Feuer filed his suit, Stumpf sent an e-mail to another executive. “I have worked over the weekend with Carrie on the LA issue—I really feel for Carrie and her team,” he wrote. “We do such a good job in this area. I will fight this one to the finish. Do you know only around 1% of our people lose their jobs [for] gaming the system . . . . Did some do things wrong —you bet and that is called life. This is not systemic.”\n\nRelying on the statistic that only 1 percent of employees were being fired annually is an easy way to minimize the problem, because it’s a measure of one thing only: the people who got caught. It didn’t represent those who encouraged gaming, or those who were fired for lack of production, or those who just left because they disapproved of the culture, like Rodriguez. The turnover at the lower levels of the community bank ran at 30 percent to 40 percent annually. Inside Wells, says lawyer Jonathan Delshad, the attitude was “Do what you have to do, but don’t get caught.”\n\nAfter the 2013 Los Angeles Times article, the board, at least according to its own report, got involved. Initially, they believed the problem was relatively small and was being addressed. After Feuer’s office filed its lawsuit in 2015, members of the risk committee asked for another presentation on sales-practice issues. It is unclear who was involved in the presentation, but board members left with the impression that only about 200 to 300 people in Southern California had been terminated. Multiple board members later complained to investigators that they felt “misled.”\n\nBy the end of the year, two directors had told Stumpf over dinner that Tolstedt should go. Finally, on July 12, 2016, Wells announced that she would retire at the end of the year. Stumpf called her a “standard-bearer of our culture, a champion for our customers, and a role model for responsible, principled and inclusive leadership.” Because she was retiring, not being fired, her stock in the company, accumulated over her years at Wells Fargo, was expected to be worth up to $124 million.\n\nBut if Wells could ignore its employees and its customers, and placate its board, its regulators were a different matter. Less than a week after the announcement that Tolstedt would retire, the O.C.C. sent a confidential letter to Stumpf, along with a report on its findings, which concluded that “the Bank’s sales practices were unethical; the Bank’s actions caused harm to consumers; and Bank management had not responded promptly to address these issues.” The O.C.C. had begun coordinating with Feuer’s office, and the C.F.P.B. also joined the fray. In early September they announced the joint $185 million settlement.\n\nNewly Minted?\n\nThere may be no greater testament to the level of delusion inside Wells Fargo than the fact that executives were completely shocked by the outpouring of rage. Finally, Wells announced that it would do what it had long been unwilling to do: eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. On October 12, as the outcry intensified, Stumpf announced he’d step down as C.E.O., and forfeit $41 million. After its investigation, the board stripped him of another $28 million and clawed back $19 million from Tolstedt. After concluding its report, they stripped her of another $47.3 million. (A lawyer for Tolstedt said, “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.”) A handful of other executives, including Claudia Russ Anderson, Pam Conboy, and Shelley Freeman, were fired.\n\nWells Fargo’s new C.E.O. is Tim Sloan, who spent most of his career not in the retail bank working with consumers but rather catering to big business clients before becoming C.F.O. and then C.O.O. Sloan is clearly not a break with the past, but, as a former Wells Fargo executive says, “he is a very different guy” from Stumpf. “No one has ever seen John Stumpf angry, and I literally can’t remember ever hearing him swear,” this person says. “Tim is much more hard-core.”\n\nAlready, Sloan has made many changes. Functions such as human resources are being centralized at headquarters, so information can be dissected in multiple ways. Cross-selling, it seems, has become a dirty phrase. Wells now talks about “Mutual Value Exchange,” which seems to boil down to providing products that customers actually want and use.\n\nWall Street isn’t sure what to think. Wells Fargo’s stock has regained the $30 billion it lost, which is as much a sign of optimism about deregulation in the new administration as anything. But “we gave them too much credit for being Superman in the banking industry,” says one major investor. “Now the cape has come off, and Wall Street is realizing they are just like everyone else and no better than anyone else.”\n\nRegardless of what happens, the story still tells an uncomfortable tale of how business, not just the business of banking, but all business, all too often works in the modern era. “I’m a notary,” Yesenia Guitron tells me. “I can only charge $10 for my services. But I’m told that, if I failed to take someone’s proper identification when I’m notarizing something for them, I could go to jail for 10 years.” How, she wonders, can you square the large consequences she’d have to face for a small misdeed for which she was paid a small amount with the small consequences for large-scale wrongdoing where the people in charge earned fortunes? The short answer is you can’t."
