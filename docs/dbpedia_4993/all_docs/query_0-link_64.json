        "text": "Stock Symbols\n\nNYSE\n\n:\n\nWFC\n\ncompany headquarters\n\nUSA\n\nA US-based multinational banking and financial services company. In 2019, it announced that it would stop financing private prison companies CoreCivic and GEO Group, but its current involvement cannot be verified.\n\nWells Fargo & Co is a US-based multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in San Francisco. It used to be one of several major financiers of private prison and immigrant detention companies, having provided revolving lines of credit, term loans, and bond underwriting services to CoreCivic and GEO Group. In 2019, it announced, along with eight other banks, that it would exit the private prison industry.\n\nIn 2022, CoreCivic signed a new credit agreement. Unlike in previous years, the company's disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding this new agreement only named the administrative agent, Alter Domus. While other lenders are also involved, they are not named. Therefore, it cannot be verified whether Wells Fargo is still involved.\n\nAlso in 2022, GEO Group completed an offer to exchange/purchase certain outstanding notes, revolving credit loans, and term loans from certain lenders. As part of this agreement, the company exchanged its outstanding bonds due in 2023, 2024, and 2026 for newly issued bonds due in 2028. SEC filings do not disclose whether Wells Fargo is still involved in any of these agreements.\n\nThe bank's known past involvement includes:\n\nIn April 2013, CoreCivic issued two sets of bonds—one totaling $325 million, with a maturity date of 2020, and the other totaling $350 million, with a maturity date of 2023. As part of a syndicate of banks, Wells Fargo underwrote both sets of bonds; however, SEC filings do not disclose the proportion of bonds underwritten by the bank.\n\nIn October 2013, GEO Group issued $250 million of bonds, with a maturity date of 2022. Wells Fargo served as the initial purchaser of the bonds, facilitating the sale of the bonds to the buyers.\n\nIn September 2014, GEO Group issued $250 million of bonds, with a maturity date of 2024. As part of a syndicate of banks, Wells Fargo underwrote $31.3 million of bonds.\n\nIn September 2015, CoreCivic issued $250 million of bonds, with a maturity date of 2022. As part of a syndicate of banks, Wells Fargo underwrote $42.5 million worth—the largest portion—of these bonds.\n\nIn April 2016, GEO Group issued $350 million of bonds, with a maturity date of 2026. As part of a syndicate of banks, Wells Fargo underwrote $70 million worth of these bonds.\n\nInvolvement in Cop City\n\nWells Fargo is among the corporate backers of the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF), the nonprofit arm of the Atlanta Police Department, which, together with the City of Atlanta, is constructing a militarized police training compound—known as Cop City—on protected forest land. As of August 2023, Wells Fargo Lead Business Execution Consultant Mitch Graul serves on the APF's Board of Trustees.\n\nOther Controversies\n\nWells Fargo is one of 17 banks that have funded the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The pipeline, constructed by Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners, cost approximately $7.5 billion to build. Spanning 1,172 miles through North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, and Iowa, the pipeline poses environmental threats and violates the Fort Laramie Treaty, which guarantees the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's \"undisturbed use\" of reservation lands surrounding the location of the pipeline.\n\nIn 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines after employees opened millions of bank and credit card accounts—without customers' consent—in an effort to hit sales targets and receive bonuses. Over 5,300 employees were fired as a result of the practice, and Wells Fargo issued some $5 million in refunds to its customers.\n\nIn 2014, Wells Fargo was sued for allegedly targeting Black and Latinx borrowers with predatory high-cost loans that pushed them into default and foreclosure. Two years prior, the company agreed to pay $175 million to settle allegations that it discriminated against Black and Latinx borrowers by steering them into subprime loans or inflated mortgage loans. The bank was also accused of deliberately allowing foreclosed homes in Black and Latinx neighborhoods to lapse into disrepair while maintaining bank-owned homes in predominantly white neighborhoods.\n\nEconomic Activism Highlights\n\nOn April 19, 2018, American Federation of Teachers President announced that the union would \"cut ties\" with Wells Fargo over the company's ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA).
