The content in this post has been approved by the organization it is based on.\n\nA financial system is very crucial for any country, as it regulates all monetary things. The financial services industry, without a doubt, is one of the biggest industries that exist today.\n\nIf we look back at history, it was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which allowed various types of companies operating in the U.S. financial services industry at the time to merge, that was passed in the late 1990s, and it contributed to the term \"financial services\" becoming more common in the country.\n\nOne such financial services company is Wells Fargo. It is an American multinational financial services company, that has its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The firm is also one of the \"Big Four Banks\" of the US, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.\n\nIn this article, you will learn about Wells Fargo, one of the most prominent financial institutions in the United States, its visionary founders, its innovative business model, notable investments, and much more.\n\nWells Fargo - Company Highlights\n\nCompany Name Wells Fargo & Company Headquarters San Francisco, California Sector Financial Services Founders Henry Wells, William George Fargo Founded 1852 Revenue $73.8 billion (2022) Website wellsfargo.com\n\nWells Fargo - About\n\nWells Fargo - Industry\n\nWells Fargo - Founders and Team\n\nWells Fargo - Startup Story\n\nWells Fargo - Mission and Vision\n\nWells Fargo - Name, Tagline, and Logo\n\nWells Fargo - Business Model\n\nWells Fargo - Revenue Model\n\nWells Fargo - Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nWells Fargo - Investments\n\nWells Fargo - Philanthropic and CSR Activities\n\nWells Fargo - Awards and Achievements\n\nWells Fargo - Competitors\n\nWells Fargo - Future Plans\n\nWells Fargo - About\n\nWith nearly $1.9 trillion in assets, Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, locally focused financial services provider.\n\nEstablished in 1852, the company offers banking, investment, and mortgage services as well as consumer and business financing through more than 7,300 locations, 12,000 ATMs, the internet (wellsfargo.com), and mobile banking. The company also has offices in more than 40 nations and territories to support its clients who conduct business in the global economy.\n\nWells Fargo has various subsidiaries, including:\n\nWells Fargo Advisors\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n\nWells Fargo Rail\n\nWells Fargo Securities\n\nWachovia\n\nFirst Union\n\nCoreStates Financial\n\nIn 1998, the original Wells Fargo & Company and the Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation merged to form the current Wells Fargo. Although Norwest appeared to have survived, the combined company adopted the more recognizable Wells Fargo name and relocated to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco.\n\nWells Fargo - Industry\n\nThe global financial services industry was valued at nearly $23,328.73 billion in 2021. In addition, it is anticipated that the value of this industry will grow from $23,328.73 billion in 2021 to $33,313.50 billion in 2026 at a rate of 7.4%. It is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach $45,149.00 billion in 2031.\n\nThe sudden rise of digitization has led to the emergence of financial service software as well. Thus, there is also a demand for workforce optimization solutions to drive the growth of the financial service software market.\n\nWells Fargo - Founders and Team\n\nWells Fargo & Company was established in 1852 by Henry Wells and William G. Fargo, who together with John Butterfield founded American Express, to offer banking services to California then.\n\nHenry Wells\n\nHenry Wells was born in Thetford, Vermont, in 1805. His father, Shipley Wells, was a Presbyterian minister at what is now the First Presbyterian Church of Seneca Falls, New York. His parents had moved to central New York State as part of the Yankee westward migration out of New England.\n\nHenry went to school in Fayette and worked on a farm when he was younger. He began working as an apprentice in 1822 for the Palmyra, New York-based tanners, and shoemakers Jessup & Palmer.\n\nBefore starting in the express industry, Henry Wells worked as a freight agent. By transporting mail for less than the government rate, his companies, which were the forerunners of American Express and Wells Fargo, competed with the United States Postal Service. In the field of higher learning, Wells founded Wells College in Aurora, New York.\n\nHenry Wells passed away in Glasgow, Scotland, two days before his 73rd birthday.\n\nWilliam George Fargo\n\nWilliam G. Fargo was a pioneer American expressman who also served as Buffalo's 27th mayor from 1862 to 1866, all of which occurred during the American Civil War. When Fargo was 13 years old, he stopped attending school and began delivering mail for his native New York village of Pompey. He started working as a freight agent for the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad in Auburn in 1841, acting as an express messenger between Albany and Buffalo. In 1852, he co-founded Wells Fargo & Company with his partner, Henry Wells.\n\nWilliam G. Fargo passed away on August 3, 1881. He is the inspiration for Fargo Avenue in Buffalo, the Fargo Quadrangle at the University at Buffalo, and Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nCharles W. Scharf is the CEO and President at Wells Fargo. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Wells Fargo & Company. Prior to this, he held leadership positions at prominent organizations. Charles served as the CEO of the Bank of New York Mellon from 2017 to 2019 and was also the chairman of its board. He has also served as the CEO and director of Visa Inc. from 2012 to 2016.\n\nCharles has a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and an MBA from New York University.\n\nWells Fargo - Startup Story\n\nThe two founders' passion led them to establish Wells Fargo. It is documented that it was during the technological revolution when Henry Wells and William G. Fargo started their professional lives. An era when more interconnected communities and economies were made possible by trains, canals, and stagecoaches. As a result, there was an increase in demand for trustworthy locations to access money while traveling, as well as safe ways to send payments.\n\nUsing this opportunity, both the founders established a network of offices from California to New York and all over the world, using their practical experience delivering money and valuables by steamboat, railroad, pony ride, and stagecoach. When the economy was changing rapidly, their network offered customers consistency and support. Through a network of agents, it also started offering fundamental financial services like money orders and fund transfers.\n\nBy the end of the California Gold Rush (1855), the company was a leading express and banking company in the West, shipping large quantities of gold as well as supplies and mail. Wells Fargo had 6,000 locations connected to its network by 1910, and by 1918, the company had more than 10,000 communities nationwide.\n\nCustomers wary of transacting with distant partners used Wells Fargo because they knew they could rely on their neighborhood Wells Fargo agent to represent them.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Wells Fargo made a series of acquisitions and introduced many subsidiaries. In May 1995, Wells Fargo became the first significant US financial services company to offer Internet banking.\n\nMuch has changed since the inception of Wells Fargo. Through the ages and every generation, the firm has kept up its tradition of assisting clients in moving forward by offering cutting-edge financial services.\n\nThe firm even has a dedicated museum, the Wells Fargo Museum, in the same place where it first started its business in 1852, in San Francisco. It has all of its artifacts from the past and information on different people who have helped shape what Wells Fargo is today. One can visit the museum between 10 AM to 5 PM for free from Monday to Friday.\n\nWells Fargo - Mission and Vision\n\nWells Fargo always had the goal of serving their customers properly by being a reliable financial service provider to all their finance needs.\n\nThe mission of Wells Fargo is, \"helping customers succeed financially\"\n\nWells Fargo - Name, Tagline, and Logo\n\nWells Fargo's name comes from the two founders' surnames; Henry Wells and William G.
