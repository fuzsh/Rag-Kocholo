        "text": "As one of the largest commercial banks in the country, Wells Fargo is committed to supporting and enriching communities where they operate. Wells Fargo has been a dedicated supporter of Grand Teton National Park Foundation's Youth Engagement Initiative since 2009. We recently had the opportunity to learn more about the bank's long-standing ties to the local community and why they are passionate about supporting youth education in Grand Teton National Park.\n\nTell us about the history of Wells Fargo and when the first branch was established in Jackson Hole.\n\nWells Fargo has a long history of serving Jackson and the entire Wyoming community—dating back to 1914 with the founding of Jackson State Bank, an institution and leadership team that played a vital role in growing and establishing what we have today. Its history and community commitments were consistent with Wells Fargo’s goal to satisfy all our customers’ financial needs and help them succeed financially. In 2008, Wells Fargo acquired United Bancorporation of Wyoming, Inc., and The Jackson State Bank & Trust. Wells Fargo is proud to be the oldest bank serving the Jackson community, with local decision makers and longstanding, deep-rooted relationships in Wyoming.\n\nWhat are Wells Fargo’s community giving priorities, both on a local and national level?\n\nWe’re the bank of putting people and communities first. The bank of rolling up or sleeves and getting involved. We’re the bank of walking the walk and taking action. Wells Fargo and the Wells Fargo Foundation does this by collaborating with national and local nonprofit organizations working to strengthen the resiliency of our communities and our planet with funding priorities that support financial health, housing affordability, small business growth, and sustainability and environmental justice.\n\nWhy is it important to Wells Fargo to give back to the communities where it operates?\n\nGiving back and pouring into the communities we serve is woven into the fabric of Wells Fargo—we are part of the community. When a community succeeds, we all succeed. We are better together. We realize that it takes collective efforts—a “together” approach to foster a community that can thrive, and to advance a more equitable, sustainable, and resilient economy.\n\nWells Fargo has been a generous supporter of Grand Teton National Park Foundation’s youth initiatives since 2009. What is it about these programs that Wells Fargo finds inspiring?\n\nGrand Teton National Park offers an experience unmatched in beauty, complemented only by the appreciation of all those who call it home or are fortunate enough to visit. Wells Fargo supports Grand Teton National Park Foundation's ongoing Youth Engagement Initiatives that are well aligned with Wells Fargo’s focus on diversity and inclusion and our commitment to education and environmental programs. Diversity and inclusion are a business imperative that lets us take advantage of the creativity and innovation that come from multiple perspectives. And we’re committed to responsible environmental stewardship in all our business decisions. Supporting these youth programs provides Wells Fargo the opportunity to demonstrate our beliefs and be part of the long-term solution for sustaining a healthy, balanced community."
