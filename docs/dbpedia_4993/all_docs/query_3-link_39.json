        "text": "Stubborn inflation is taking a toll on the nation’s largest banks.\n\nOn Friday, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo released earnings that were stuttered with indications that despite recent signs of cooling inflation the economy continues to be a drag. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported that their overall deposits fell and they had to hike the average interest rates on checking and savings accounts — good news for borrowers but not for the banks themselves.\n\nMajor banks, like other investors, have had to contend this year with high interest rates. While higher rates help lenders by allowing wider potential profit on loans, they also deter customers from taking on new debt, a big source of revenue for banks.\n\nIndeed, Wells Fargo’s shares closed about 6 percent lower after the bank reported that its net interest income — a closely watched financial metric that essentially measures how much money it makes from lending — fell 9 percent, to $11.9 billion. Loan demand from businesses “remained tepid,” said Charles W. Scharf, the bank’s chief executive.\n\nThe bank reported profit of $4.9 billion, down slightly from a year earlier, on revenue of $20.7 billion, up 1 percent from last year.\n\nThe bank’s recent history of scandals continues to haunt it, with customer remediation costs driving up expenses. Wells Fargo continues to operate under an asset cap, imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018, that prevents it from expanding beyond its current size. The bank has paid billions in fines and customer refunds for misdeeds including creating sham accounts for customers without their consent, wrongfully repossessing some borrowers’ cars and homes and charging improper overdraft fees.\n\n“We’re focused on investing in growing the business,” Mr. Scharf said on a call with analysts. “We’re focused on spending what’s necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
