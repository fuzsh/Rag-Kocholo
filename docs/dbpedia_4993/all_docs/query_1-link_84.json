        "text": "Wells Fargo began when prosperous New York City businessmen Henry Wells and William Fargo saw a great opportunity in the West after gold was discovered. The pair, who had helped to found American Express in 1850, officially created Wells Fargo & Co. on March 18, 1852, with two primary objectives – transportation and banking.\n\nIn California, where no railroads existed, the Wells Fargo & Co Express planned to provide “express” services to the many miners flooding the area and freight services to businesses. Its banking division, Wells Fargo & Co. Bank, advertised financial services and general forwarding businesses for mail, valuable deliveries, and freight.\n\nBy 1855, mining activity had declined in California, and several banks failed. However, Wells Fargo remained, soon to become the dominant express and banking organization in the West. At that time, they were the only company making large shipments of gold and continued to serve miners by delivering mail and supplies.\n\nIn 1857, Wells Fargo helped back the new Overland Mail Company, which provided regular twice-a-week mail service between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, California.\n\nThe Overland Mail Company was organized by men with extensive interests in four leading express companies: Wells Fargo, American Express, United States Express, and Adams Express. John Butterfield, one of the founders of American Express, was made president of the new company, with Wells Fargo being its primary lender.\n\nNicknamed the “Butterfield Line” after its president, the Overland Mail ran 2,757 miles through the Southwest via El Paso, Tucson, and Los Angeles before arriving in San Francisco. The trek over deserts and mountains took about 25 days, stopping only to change horses or for passengers to get food.\n\nHowever, Wells Fargo would still often use its own wagons and guards, as the Overland Mail Company forbade the shipment of valuables. Noted Overland Mail historian Gerald T. Ahnert points out John Butterfield’s Order No. 8 in the Overland Mail’s Special Instructions issued to employees that states, “No money, jewelry, banknotes, or valuables of any nature, will be allowed to be carried under any circumstances whatever.”\n\nJohn Butterfield was forced out as president of the Overland Mail in 1860, and Wells Fargo increased its investment in the company. By the early 1860s, Wells Fargo monopolized the express business in California, sporting some 147 offices.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, the route changed, moving northward across the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains before snaking its way to California.\n\nIn 1866, Wells Fargo expanded its operations again, buying what was then Ben Holladay’s Overland Mail Express and consolidating all the other independent companies on what was known as the “Central Route” to create the largest stagecoach company in the world. They controlled virtually all the stage lines from Mississippi to California. It was 1867 when Wells Fargo finally achieved the total running of a stage line with its logo on the side of a stagecoach. They placed their first order for 30 Concord stagecoaches with Abbot-Downing & Company on April 20, 1867.\n\nWells Fargo was the target of bandits both on trains and on stagecoaches. The first big train robbery occurred in 1870 when the Central Pacific out of Oakland was held up near Truckee, California, and seven masked men got away with $42,000 in gold and gold coins. As a result, Wells Fargo hired James B. Hume as its Chief Detective. Hume was with the company for 32 years and became one of the most famous detectives in the country. During his tenure, it was said: “There are two institutions dangerous for bad men to tinker with — the United States Government and Wells Fargo.”\n\nBy the turn of the century, Wells Fargo had over 3,000 offices in nearly every state and Mexico.\n\nIn 1904, Wells Fargo & Company moved its office to New York City, and the following year, it separated its banking and express operations. Wells Fargo Bank then merged with the Nevada National Bank, forming the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank."
