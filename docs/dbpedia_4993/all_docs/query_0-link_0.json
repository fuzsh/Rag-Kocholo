        "text": "Henry Wells and William G. Fargo began their careers in the middle of a technological revolution. Trains, canals, and stagecoaches created more interconnected communities and economies. Demand grew for secure ways to send payments, and reliable places to access money, especially while traveling.\n\nWells and Fargo used their hands-on experience making deliveries of money and valuables by steamboat and stagecoach to develop a network of offices from California to New York and around the world. The network provided consistency and support for customers in a rapidly evolving economy. Using Wells Fargo, customers wary of doing business with distant partners knew they could depend on the local Wells Fargo agent to act on their behalf.\n\nA lot has changed since 1852. New communities and industries have emerged and grown. Technology has made communication and bank transactions faster than ever before.\n\nAcross time, and in every generation, Wells Fargo has continued helping customers go further by providing innovative financial services to help them get ahead. Through prosperity, depression, and war, customers have turned to Wells Fargo for the solutions they needed to survive and thrive."
