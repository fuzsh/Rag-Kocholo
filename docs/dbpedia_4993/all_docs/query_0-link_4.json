        "text": "Wells, Fargo & Company, established in 1852, had its roots in Harnden & Company, the first of all express carriers. In the year 1841, Vermont-born Henry Wells, whose name was to rank in prominence with that of William F. Harnden and Alvin Adams in the history of the express business, was serving as Harnden's agent in Albany, New York. Many years later he explained how he came to leave Harnden's employ and to become the moving force in the first of several new express enterprises:\n\n“I was in his [William F. Harnden's] employ and recommended him to extend his express line from Albany to Buffalo, and as transportation was offered, to Chicago, [but] Mr. Harnden did not believe that the People were there and he declined. His words of declination were ‘If Mr. Wells chose to run an Express to the Rocky Mountains he might — He [Mr. Harnden] would not do it.’ ”\n\n3 Wells related in 1863 the since famous story of the oyster delivery: James Leidley, the proprietor of the Seneca Street House in Buffalo, asked Wells if he could not bring oysters to Buffalo by express. At first Wells protested, but relented when told that price was no object.\n\n“They were brought,” Wells wrote, “—opened in Albany and brought to Buffalo at the cost of three dollars a hundred — and the arrival of those oysters by Express at Buffalo created a sensation as great as would today attend the coming hither of a section of the Atlantic Telegraph.” (Wells, The American Express, p. 12.)\n\n5 Partners in Wells & Company were, first, Crawford Livingston's widow, to whom he had left his interest, and later Johnston Livingston and Edward T. Winslow. Two receipts of Wells & Company in the Wells Fargo history collection (Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Company, San Francisco) place within a few months the date of the withdrawal of Mrs. Livingston from the company. The first, dated March 30, 1848, gives “H. Wells” and “Mrs. C. C. Livingston” as proprietors. On the second, dated July 24, 1848, Mrs. Livingston's name is crossed out and the words “& Co.” are written after Wells' name.\n\n17 In the seventy-five years between his birth in 1806 and his death in 1881, Morgan was active in many affairs other than his own extensive business interests. He served as Representative from New York in Congress from 18S3 to 1859. During the Civil War he was active in raising, equipping and privately rewarding troops. Through purchase of stock in the New York Times he assisted that newspaper's fight against the Tweed ring. During the latter part of his life he concerned himself largely with educational benefactions.\n\n30 Hunter & Company had earlier handled Adams & Company's exchanges. In 1854 Wells Fargo & Company was to take over Hunter & Company entirely.
