        "text": "Online banking can be helpful for specific services and information, like opening a credit card. But you might prefer to visit a physical location for loans or other banking needs.\n\nFinding your local Wells Fargo branch or ATM is simple. If you’re using a web browser, start at Wells Fargo’s homepage. You’ll see the “ATMs/locations” menu on the upper right-hand side.\n\nOnce you click this, you’ll jump to a page with a helpful map and a place to put your state, city or ZIP code. You can also click on any of the orange states on the map provided — they indicate states where there are branches or ATMs. Wells Fargo mobile app users can also find the same type of branch and ATM map on their phones.\n\nIf you search your area, each location lists if there are branch options or if only ATM locations are available.\n\nIf you’re just looking to deposit or take out money, Wells Fargo’s ATM-only service stations can be found by checking the “ATM Drive Up” or “24-hour ATM” boxes. For investing, banking and loan services, in-person branches may be the better option.\n\nWells Fargo was founded by Henry Wells and William G. Fargo in 1852. The stagecoach logo that’s still associated with Wells Fargo today is a symbol of its beginnings. The company first started as a way to move money safely across the United States with the help of horse-drawn stagecoaches. Now one of the largest banks in the U.S., Wells Fargo has 70 million customers and counting. It also has global locations.\n\nLike other major banks, Wells Fargo accounts are FDIC-insured for the standard deposit insurance coverage limit of $250,000. To get all of your questions answered, Wells Fargo has many contact and self-help options including:\n\nPhone numbers: Wells Fargo has numbers for all of its services listed on its contact page.\n\nIn-person branches: You can schedule an appointment online to meet in person with a banker or investment advisor.\n\nSocial media: Wells Fargo has X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook pages where you can ask questions or find answers to questions other users have submitted.\n\nFAQ pages: For simple answers to commonly asked questions, visit Well Fargo’s customer service page.\n\n>> Related: Get more information in our Wells Fargo review."
