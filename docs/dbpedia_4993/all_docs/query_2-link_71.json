        "text": "On March 18, 1852, Henry Wells and William G. Fargo founded Wells, Fargo & Co. Just like the company in its early years and today, the men who founded it were known for creating innovative solutions to help their customers succeed.\n\nHenry Wells\n\nWells was born Dec. 12, 1805, as the third of four children of itinerant Presbyterian preacher Shipley Wells and Dolly Randall Wells in Thetford, Vermont. Before becoming a leader in the express and banking industries, Wells first worked as an apprentice tanner and shoemaker at the age of 16.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges he faced early in life was coping with a severe stutter. In 1824, Wells visited a speech therapist in Rochester, New York. Taking what he learned from the therapist and integrating his own methods, Wells traveled to several cities to help others with speech impediments."
