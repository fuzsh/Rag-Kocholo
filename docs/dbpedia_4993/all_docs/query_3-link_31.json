        "text": "The IBAN model creates a standard for account numbering among multiple countries. The model requires certain components to be present in all IBANs, but also allows for some flexibility for country-specific requirements. By adding components to existing account numbers, the IBAN improves a bank’s ability to process cross-border payments without having to manually repair transactions or replace existing account numbers. If you do not use the IBAN in countries that require its use, your payments might be returned without processing.\n\nAn IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following:\n\nCountry code – the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) country code\n\nCheck digits – two check digits provided by the issuing financial institution based on a calculation that takes into account the entire IBAN\n\nBank identifier – code that identifies the financial institution and, when appropriate, the branch of that financial institution servicing an account\n\nBasic bank account number (BBAN) – code that identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country\n\nSample IBAN Format\n\nCountry Code Check Digits Bank Identifier Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) GB 76 PNBP 165671 12345678\n\nRefer to the IBAN registry (PDF) for a list of countries that require IBANs and each country’s unique IBAN format.\n\nSWIFT BICs (business identifier codes), which are often called SWIFT codes, are a series of either eight or 11 alphanumeric characters that help to identify a specific financial institution. The number includes a bank code, a country code, a location code, and an optional branch code.\n\nSample BIC\n\nBank Code Country Code Location Code Branch Code PNBP GB 2L XXX (Represents the head office location)\n\nIncluding an IBAN and a SWIFT BIC in wire instructions potentially will keep your wire fees lower because financial institutions in the beneficiary’s country may choose to either charge an additional fee for, or return, wires that do not include these numbers.\n\nRefer to our international resources for more information on SWIFT BIC numbers and other payment directories. Learn more about SWIFT."
