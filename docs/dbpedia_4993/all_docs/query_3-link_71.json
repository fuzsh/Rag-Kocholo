You can schedule an appointment with a banker online or walk into a branch during traditional business hours.\n\nFor specific services, like personal loans or mortgage financing, the hours may vary.\n\nIs Wells Fargo Trustworthy?\n\nThe Better Business Bureau currently gives Wells Fargo an F rating because it has received customer complaints on the BBB website and there has been government action taken against the bank. In the past few years, Wells Fargo has been involved in the following controversies:\n\nIn December 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau required Wells Fargo to pay more than $3.7 billion in a settlement that accused the bank of wrongfully charging fees that led thousands of customers to lose vehicles and homes. The settlement also accuses the bank of wrongfully charging overdraft fees on checking and savings accounts.\n\nIn 2021, Wells Fargo consented to a Cease and Desist order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

However, if you're not a current customer, you can't apply for a personal loan without visiting a branch.\n\nWells Fargo personal loan review External link Arrow An arrow icon, indicating this redirects the user.\"\n\nProduct Details\n\nLoan amounts range from $3,000 to $100,000\n\nTerm lengths range from 1 to 7 years\n\nRate discounts to customers who have a checking account with the bank and who make their loan payments automatically through that account\n\nNon-customers must apply by visiting a branch and talking with a banker\n\nLoans made by Wells Fargo, member FDIC\n\nWells Fargo offers some of the best low-interest personal loans.

If you're looking for a sign-up bonus, Wells Fargo is likely the better choice.\n\nFor checking accounts, Bank of America offers a $200 bonus for new customers who open a new eligible personal checking account online with qualifying activities (offer expires September 30, 2024). This is lower than Wells Fargo's checking bonus. Wells Fargo also offers a substantial savings bonus if you can deposit at least $25,000, while Bank of America doesn't have a savings bonus at all.\n\nIf you take bonuses out of the equation, Bank of America might be the better choice for a savings account. With the Bank of America Advantage Savings Account, you won't have to worry about monthly service fees during the first six months of opening an account. If you get the Wells Fargo Way2Save® Savings Account you'll need to meet certain requirements every month to waive a $5 monthly service fee.\n\nBank of America Review\n\nWells Fargo vs. Chase\n\nChase and Wells Fargo are two of the largest national banks in the US. Your choice between the two might depend on where you live. Otherwise, your decision could rely on differences between bank account features and perks.\n\nYou might favor Wells Fargo over Chase if you're only looking to open a checking account. Wells Fargo makes it easier to waive the monthly service fee than Chase. You can earn a $300 bonus when you open an account and make direct deposits totaling $500 or more within 90 days of coupon enrollment (offer expires on 10/16/2024) with Chase Total Checking® account. While this bonus is easier to earn than Wells Fargo's checking bonus, it's still not quite as high. Chase also doesn't offer a savings bonus.\n\nChase Bank Review\n\nShould You Bank with Wells Fargo?\n\nWells Fargo is a decent option if you want to bank with a brick-and-mortar financial institution. It has an extensive branch and ATM network, so you'll likely find a nearby branch in many states. Wells Fargo also has a variety of bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and loan types. Hence, it may also be worthwhile if you want to bank with one financial institution primarily.\n\nIf you're interested in competitive savings or CD rates, other financial institutions may be more suitable choices. Wells Fargo also has many common bank fees like monthly service fees and overdraft fees. There are ways to waive these fees at Wells Fargo. That said, keep in mind that some banks and credit unions do not charge these fees at all.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Wells Fargo\n\nTo review Wells Fargo, we rated accounts and services using our editorial standards.\n\nAt Business Insider, we rate products on a scale from zero to five stars.
