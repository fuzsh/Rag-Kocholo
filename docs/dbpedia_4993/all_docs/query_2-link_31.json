Through these services customers are able to move money, set up regular payments, manage account details, and apply for financial products without interacting with members of the Wells Fargo team.\n\nThe majority of the Company’s services are provided either in person, through the Company extensive branch network, or over the phone. These channels enable customers to access a greater degree of personal care, with Wells Fargo representatives working with them directly. Wells Fargo also works closely with its commercial and institutional clients, providing bespoke services with a view to establishing longstanding client relationships.\n\nWells Fargo provides ongoing support to its customers, operating a 24/7 customer service teams that can be contacted by customers over the phone or by email, as well as through formal in-person appointments.

Through its subsidiary companies, Wells Fargo provides a range of banking, insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance service.\n\nThe Company has three operating segments: Community Banking, which provides financial products and services to consumers and small businesses, such as checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, and various lending products; Wholesale Banking, which provides financial services to larger businesses; and Wealth and Investment Management, which provides bespoke wealth management, investment advisory, and other private banking services.\n\nKey Partners\n\nWells Fargo collaborates with a range of partners throughout the development and provision of its services. These partnerships include:\n\nSupplier Partners, comprising suppliers of tools, technology and services that support the Company in the development and provision of its services;\n\nStrategic and Alliance Partners, comprising a range of companies, principally banking and technology companies, with which the Company shares resources and collaborates on joint-venture projects; and\n\nBanking Partners, comprising banking and financial institutions that support or supplement the Company’s own banking services.\n\nWells Fargo has recently agreed a number of partnerships, including an agreement with Bank De Oro Unibank to provide remittance services; a financing deal with education organisation Hispanic Scholarship Fund; and a data-sharing tie-up with software firm Xero.\n\nWells Fargo also has a number of supplier diversity partnerships, including with National Minority Supplier Development Council, Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, and National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKey Resources\n\nWells Fargo’s key resources are its financial resources, its branch network and sales infrastructure, its technology and communications infrastructure, its partnerships, and its personnel.\n\nWells Fargo has a branch network spanning more than 6,000 individual branches, in addition to more than 13,000 automated teller machines. The Company also maintains a physical presence in a number of international markets.\n\nSearches of records published by the US Patent and Trademark Office identified 14 patent application filed in the name of Wells Fargo, including applications entitled ‘System and method for a mobile wallet’, ‘Fingerprint check to reduce check fraud’ and ‘Financial services store’. The Company, however, does not depend materially on any one patent.\n\nCost Structure\n\nWells Fargo incurs costs in relation to the operation of its branch and automated teller machine network, the maintenance of its technology and communications infrastructure, the implementation of advertising and marketing campaigns, the management of its partnerships, the payment of professional and banking fees, and the retention of its personnel.\n\nIn 2015 Wells Fargo accrued total non-interest expenses in the amount of $49.97 billion.

The Company attributed this small increase to higher net interest income, gains on sale of debt securities, debit and credit card fees, and trust and investment fees.\n\nIn 2015 Wells Fargo derived the majority of its revenue from the activities of its Community Banking segment, which accounted for $49.34 billion in revenue, derived largely from card fees, lending fees, and service charges. This was followed by the Wholesale Banking Segment, which generated $25.90 billion, with the Wealth and Investment Management segment generating $15.78 billion."
