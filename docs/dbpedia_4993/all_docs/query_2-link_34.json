        "text": "All’s Well that Ends Well(s Fargo): The Creation of Wells Fargo, 1852\n\nMiners, cowboys, and bankers. Welcome to the Wild West.\n\nIt’s 1852, and the American frontier is under siege by fortune-seekers whose shared thirst for gold has led them to a standoff. The United States had acquired vast, untrodden territory from the Mexican-American war four years prior, which sparked a mass exodus of fortune-seekers onto the frontier. Now, after the discovery of gold in 1848, the California gold rush is in full swing, with some 300,000 migrants now teeming among Californian cities. This has had an outsized economic impact—not only in California but also on a national and international scale. Who took the reins of these new riches? Henry Wells and William Fargo did, in large part.\n\nThese two businessmen from New York and Vermont entered the express mail and financial services industries together by co-founding American Express on the east coast. Initially, they had high hopes of it expanding west, but its shareholders were scared off by Adams & Company. Never ones to give up, Wells and Fargo founded Wells Fargo to realize their ambitions. As board members of this burgeoning bank in the flourishing American West, delegates will be tasked with whipping Wells Fargo into high gear by expanding its banking, stagecoach, and express networks. This will be no easy feat. Economic downturns and ghost towns; aggressive competition from banking rivals; resistance from local governments and outlaws all threaten its fate. Each board member will play a vital role in establishing a new order in the Wild West through diplomacy with those who threaten them the most. In doing so, they will not only forge Wells Fargo’s future, but also the future of the American West."
