        "text": "In 2015, the city of Los Angeles sued Wells Fargo for unethical customer conduct, accusing the bank of secretly opening unauthorized accounts that then accrued bogus fees. One year later, Wells is paying for this behavior: the bank announced Thursday that it has reached settlements with city and federal officials totaling nearly $200 million.\n\nWells Fargo said Thursday that it has reached agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles attorney office over allegations that it, among other improper activities, opened deposit accounts and transferred funds without customers' consent. The bank will pay a total of $185 million in fines, plus another $5 million in what it is calling \"customer remediation.\"\n\nA consent decree released by the CFPB Thursday reveals the lengths to which thousands of Wells employees went in order to meet sales quotas. The CFPB investigation determined that, going back to \"at least\" 2011, Wells opened deposit accounts for existing customers without their knowledge or consent and proceeded to transfer money to those accounts from their other accounts; submitted credit card applications in customers' names, also without their knowledge or consent; enrolled people in online banking services they did not ask for, in some cases using email addresses that the customers themselves did not create; and ordered and activated debit cards -- and PIN numbers -- using consumers' information without their knowledge or approval.\n\nWatch on Forbes:\n\nThe CFPB said that its analysis found that Wells employees opened 1,534,280 unauthorized deposit accounts, 85,000 of which accrued a total of $2 million in fees. On the credit card side of things, the CFPB said its analysis unearthed 565,443 unauthorized credit card account applications -- submitted on behalf of clients, without their knowledge, by Wells employees -- 14,000 of which accrued $403,145 in fees.\n\nIt's a rather stunning breach of consumer trust, and one that the CFPB says was driven by an \"incentive-compensation program that made it possible for its employees to pursue underhanded sales practices.\" In prepared comments delivered Thursday, CFPB director Richard Cordray was blunt, slamming these employees for gaming the system and hurting customers in exchange for enriching themselves. \"It is quite clear that these are unfair and abusive practices under federal law,\" he said.\n\nRumblings of account impropriety have been in the open since 2013, when an LA Times investigation first revealed that sales pressures led Wells employees to cut legal and ethical corners. \"Wells Fargo is the nation's leader in selling add-on services to its customers,\" the paper wrote at the time, in an article that would go on to get the attention of the Los Angeles city attorney and lead to the city's 2015 suit against the bank. \"I'm not aware of any overbearing sales culture,\" then-CFO (and current COO) Timothy Sloan told the Times.\n\nAll the while, Wells CEO John Stumpf has been frank about his desire to get Wells credit cards in the hands of his customers. “I am not going to be satisfied until every creditworthy customer who calls us their bank carries our credit card,” he said in 2014.\n\nThe shady consumer practices didn't end at unauthorized debit and credit card accounts: consumers also found that unauthorized lines of credit were opened in their names. FORBES contributor Micheline Maynard reports that this happened to her:\n\nWells, for its part, is finally accepting responsibility for its actions. \"Wells Fargo reached these agreements consistent with our commitment to customers and in the interest of putting this matter behind us,\" the company said in a statement Thursday. \"Wells Fargo is committed to putting our customers’ interests first 100% of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request.\"\n\nWells also said Thursday that an independent, third-party review has, thus far, led to $2.6 million in refunds to affected customers. In addition, disciplinary actions, including terminations, have been taken against managers and employees who engaged in the illegal behavior. A Wells spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that between January 2011 and March of this year, 5,300 people were terminated in connection with this episode.\n\n\"Our entire culture is centered on doing what is right for our customers,\" Stumpf said in a company-wide memo Thursday. \"However, at Wells Fargo, when we make mistakes, we are open about it, we take responsibility, and we take action. Today’s agreements are consistent with these beliefs.\""
