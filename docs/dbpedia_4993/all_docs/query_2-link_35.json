        "text": "Wells Fargo History Museum: What You Will See in This San Francisco Attraction\n\nThe Wells Fargo History Museum is in San Francisco's Financial District. You will find it at the site of the original Wells Fargo Bank location in SF.\n\nWhen I first entered this free museum, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it was only a small area, with a handful of exhibits. I was pleasantly surprised by both the size (two floors) and the quality of the displays.\n\nBefore I walk you through this SF museum, let me tell you a little more about the history of Wells Fargo and its importance to the banking industry.\n\nDisclaimer: I receive a small commission from some of the links on this page.\n\nHistory of Wells Fargo\n\nHenry Wells and William G. Fargo founded the company in 1852 in New York. Both were successful expressmen and excited about the announcement of gold in California in 1848.\n\nThey decided to build an express and banking company that connected the east coast with the gold rush craze on the west coast. Soon after opening their offices in New York, they opened offices in both San Francisco and Sacramento.\n\nOver the years, they built a strong business known for being both reliable and fair to their customers. This reputation allowed them to continue to grow over the years into one of the largest financial institutions in the world today.\n\nInside the Museum\n\nThe Wells Fargo History Museum includes hundreds of items and displays. They range from rare documents to a detailed overview about the Gold Rush of the 1840s and 50s.\n\nInteractive Displays\n\nYou will find several interactive displays throughout the museum. Many are educational and geared toward children and young adults.\n\nThe picture above shows the simulated stagecoach ride interactive exhibit. It's one of the most popular at the museum.\n\nIt's a replica of the original stagecoaches Wells Fargo used.\n\nAfter stepping inside, take a seat and learn what it was like to travel in a stagecoach. It simulates both the sights and sounds from some of the most popular routes.\n\nThe table in the picture above shows the telegraph interactive exhibit. You can take a seat at the table to use the working telegraph and send messages just as they did more than 100 years ago.\n\nRare Photographs, Documents, and Artifacts\n\nThe museum also houses unique documents, photos and other important artifacts.\n\nThis section on the second floor tells the story of Wells Fargo's role in the Pony Express. You can take a close look at some of the original stamps, postcards, and other documents from the 1860s. Simply pull out these panels to take a look.\n\nYou can also see several other artifacts from this time period on the screen right next to it. They are now all electronic, which allows you to easily sort through them and find the documents that interest you the most.\n\nYou also get the chance to see several gold nuggets from the time of the Gold Rush in the late 1800s. In addition, this display has a several pieces of old currency.\n\nYou will find this display on the first floor near the stairs.\n\nGold Rush Exhibit\n\nThe Wells Fargo History Museum is also one of the best places to learn more about the Gold Rush.\n\nOn the second floor, you will find a large exhibit that shows a maps with the locations on where gold was found, an overview of what happened during the time, and additional gold coins from the time.\n\nPanama Pacific Exposition Exhibit\n\nAnother part of the Wells Fargo History Museum that impressed me was their Panama Pacific Exposition Exhibit. It does a great job of telling the story of the Exposition as well as Wells Fargo's role in it.\n\nIt includes a map of the entire Exposition, old photos, and a small interactive video screen with original films from the event.\n\nLearn More with Your Phone\n\nAnother fun feature of this free museum is the free cell phone audio tour. By dialing a phone number, you can hear more audio stories about several of the exhibits. It is in both English and Spanish.\n\nHours, Ticket Prices & Tips to Get Here\n\nThe Wells Fargo History Museum is open Monday through Friday from 10 am to 5 pm. It is closed on weekends and bank holidays.\n\nYou will find it at 420 Montgomery Street in the Financial District. Here is a map showing its location.\n\nAdmission is free for all.\n\nHow to Get Here\n\nFrom Union Square\n\nWalk: The fastest and easiest way to get here from Union Square is to walk. It's about seven blocks from the square.\n\n8-Bayshore Muni Bus: If you don't want to walk that far, you can also pick up the 8 bus on the corner of Geary and Kearny Streets. Take it 5 blocks north to the California Street stop. Walk east one block to Montgomery Street to find the museum.\n\nFrom Fisherman's Wharf"
