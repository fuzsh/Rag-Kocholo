        "text": "The story of who owns Wells Fargo (WFC 1.49%) reads like an American history lesson. It begins with the rise and fall of stagecoach transportation and continues to modern-day corporate mergers and scandals. From humble beginnings, Wells Fargo has grown into a diversified financial services company that manages $1.9 trillion in assets and ranks 47th on Fortune's 2023 list of America's largest corporations.\n\nRead on for the Wells Fargo ownership story, from start-up courier to publicly traded company. You'll also learn who WFC's largest shareholders are today, who's on the board of directors, and how to invest your cash in the company.\n\nWho owns Wells Fargo?\n\nWho is the owner of Wells Fargo?\n\nAs a public company, Wells Fargo is collectively owned by its shareholders. Institutional investors own roughly 76% of WFC's outstanding shares, while insiders own about 0.08%. The institutional investors are mainly mutual fund managers, and the insiders are WFC officers. Specifics on the largest institutional and insider owners are provided in the section below.\n\nWFC has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1962. The IPO was 110 years after the company's founding, when frontier-era entrepreneurs William Fargo and Henry Wells decided to provide courier and banking services to the West Coast during the California Gold Rush.\n\nFargo and Wells initially pitched the West Coast market to American Express (AXP 2.0%), the other company they helped establish. American Express declined, so the pair independently launched Wells, Fargo & Co. The business grew quickly through the expansion and consolidation of other stagecoach lines.\n\nThe stagecoach business would eventually fall to rail transportation. Wells Fargo evolved by rapidly opening new banking offices and using railroads to establish a transcontinental express line.\n\nThat early transformation would be followed by many organizational developments, including mergers, divestitures, and name changes. Five significant milestones are listed below:\n\nIn 1905, Wells Fargo separated its bank from its transportation services. The bank merged with Nevada National Bank to form Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank.\n\nIn 1923, Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank merged with Union Trust Company, creating Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Co. The name was later changed to Wells Fargo Bank.\n\nIn 1960, Wells Fargo Bank merged with American Trust Company, creating the Wells Fargo Bank American Trust Company.\n\nIn 1962, Wells Fargo became listed as a public company on the NYSE.\n\nIn 1998, the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis merged with Wells Fargo. The combined company continued business under the Wells Fargo name.\n\nLargest shareholders\n\nWho are the largest shareholders?\n\nWells Fargo continues today as a public company owned by institutional and individual investors. Below are five top individual insider shareholders:\n\nCharles Scharf owns 800,175 shares or 0.022% of 3.6 billion outstanding shares. At a per-share price of $58, his position is worth $46.4 million. Scharf is Wells Fargo's CEO and president, and is also on the WFC board of directors. Scharf is a longtime banking executive. Before joining Wells Fargo in 2019, he served as CEO of Bank of New York Mellon (BK 0.88%) and CEO of Visa (V 0.39%).\n\nJonathan Weiss owns 376,866 shares worth about $21.8 million. His position amounts to 0.01% of the company's outstanding shares. Weiss is a senior executive vice present for WFC, and is also the CEO of the bank's Corporate and Investment Banking group. Weiss joined the Wells Fargo investment banking team in 2005 and rose to his current role in 2020. He formerly worked for JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.11%) for 25 years.\n\nMichael Santomassimo owns 309,269, or 0.009%, of WFC shares, worth $17.9 million.
