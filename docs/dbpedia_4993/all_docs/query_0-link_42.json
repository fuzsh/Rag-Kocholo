        "text": "History Takes the Stage: 150 years of western lore at Wells Fargo (2009)\n\nWells Fargo & Company occupies a unique place in U.S. history, continuing a proud tradition of serving customers since 1852. Located at Wells Fargo's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, the Archives maintains the documents, photographs, audiovisual materials, art and artifacts that comprise the institutional memory of Wells Fargo and its numerous predecessor and subsidiary companies. The Archives also maintains a special collection of records documenting early California banking institutions, express operations, mining and railroad industries, and early San Francisco history.\n\nArchive materials are prominently featured in each of the nine Wells Fargo History Museums and dozens of historical exhibits located throughout the company’s operational footprint. The Archives also contributes documents, photographs, and historical information to support the company’s blog, Guided by History, which was the first blog launched by a financial institution in the United States.\n\nThe Archives repeatedly proves its value to internal and external clients by providing timely and accurate information about Wells Fargo's past. Archive materials are regularly used to fulfill a variety of requests including: genealogical research; litigation support; historical imagery; evolution of company products and services; long-standing customer and community relationships; career paths of corporate leaders; and reinforcing Wells Fargo's long-standing history of serving diverse communities.\n\nThese examples are only a few of the innovative ways in which the Corporate Archives helps build, leverage and strengthen Wells Fargo’s rich heritage as a corporate competitive advantage. Bringing the brand to life, Historical Services inspires pride and loyalty by connecting team members, customers, and communities with Wells Fargo’s dynamic and unique history that preserves the past, engages the present, and envisions the future.\n\nFor additional information, please visit Wells Fargo’s Historical Services website: http://www.wellsfargohistory.com.\n\nNote: Repository Profilies are provided by the organization.
