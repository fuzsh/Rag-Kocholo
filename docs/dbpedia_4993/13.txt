History

Wells Fargo & Company was founded in 1852 by Henry Wells and William G. Dorman as a banking firm in New York City. In 1864, it merged with another bank to become the National Bank of Commerce. The following year, it moved its headquarters to San Francisco, California during the Gold Rush. In 1903, it became the first bank to use an ATM (automated teller machine) which allowed customers to withdraw cash without interacting with a human teller. During the Great Depression, Wells Fargo played a significant role in providing relief to struggling farmers through its Farm Credit System. After World War II, the company expanded into new markets such as insurance and real estate brokerage. In 1970, it acquired the brokerage firm Wachovia Securities and changed its name to Wells Fargo & Co. In recent years, the company has faced criticism for its involvement in foreclosure practices and settlements related to the mortgage crisis.
