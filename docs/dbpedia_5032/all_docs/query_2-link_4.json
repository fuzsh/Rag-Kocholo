        "text": "See larger map Red = high-speed line\n\nBuy rail map of Europe\n\nMap of Paris showing stations\n\nMy favourite Paris station\n\nThe Gare de l'Est is my favourite Parisian terminus, an elegant station that's much calmer than the hectic Gare du Nord next door, or the bustling Gare de Lyon a mile or two to the south. Opened in 1849 as the Gare de Strasbourg it was renamed the Gare de l'Est in 1854, and in 1883 it witnessed the first departure of the fabled Orient Express. It was expanded to its current size in 1931. As its name suggests, the Gare de l'Est handles trains heading east to Reims, Nancy, Metz, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt & Munich. It also handles the weekly Venice Simplon Orient Express between March & November .\n\nStation overview\n\nWhich platform for your train?\n\nTips for using Paris Est\n\nFood & drink\n\nHotels near the station\n\nMap of Paris showing stations\n\nHow to walk from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de l'Est\n\nHow to walk from the Gare de l'Est to the Gare du Nord\n\nMetro/RER & taxi information\n\nOverview: Station plan Location map\n\nThe Gare de l'Est is a terminus with easy, flat & level access between the street, taxi rank, concourse & platforms, painless to navigate with wheeled luggage. See station plan & see more about the station & its facilities at www.garesetconnexions.sncf.\n\nForecourt: The Gare de l'Est has a large forecourt and very wide facade with western, central & eastern entrances.\n\nThe western entrance, at the left-hand end of that broad facade. The photo is looking roughly north. At the other end of the facade, the eastern entrance is a mirror image of this one.\n\nCentral hall between forecourt & concourse, sandwiched between the western & eastern halls. The left luggage office (Consigne) is on the lower level, tucked away behind an escalator in the northeast corner.\n\nConcourse, looking east from the rue d'Alsace side entrance. The concourse runs the full width of the station, platforms lined up on one side and western, central & eastern halls through archways on the other. Those TV screens list arrivals & departures.\n\nAnother view of the concourse, taken from the balcony opposite platform 11. There are food outlets & seating areas.\n\nPlatforms 2-30 are lined up in a neat row along the concourse, with ticket gates at the entrance to each pair or small group of platforms (visible here on the right).\n\nWhich platform for your train?\n\nPlatforms are numbered 2 to 30 from left to right, starting with platform 2 on the west side, see the station plan.\n\nPlatforms 2 to 12 are designated as the yellow platforms, trains to & from Germany usually use these.\n\nPlatforms 13 to 22 are mainly for suburban trains.\n\nPlatforms 23 to 30 are designated as the blue platforms, also used by mainline trains, trains to & from Germany sometimes use these.\n\nTrains are usually posted on the departure boards 15-20 minutes before departure, but the screens usually indicate whether to wait near the yellow platforms or the blue platforms before an actual number is posted, so you can wait in the right place.\n\nTips for using the Gare de L'Est\n\nTake a moment to wander onto the forecourt and see the beautiful station facade. For more information on the station & facilities see the SNCF website www.gares-sncf.com. You'll find a detailed station plan there.\n\nFirst class lounge\n\nThere's an SNCF Grand Voyageur first class lounge but this is only accessible to holders of SNCF's (or other Railteam members) frequent traveller loyalty card which you probably don't have, or a full-price 1st class Pro fare so is useless for most visitors even if you have a (non-Pro) 1st class ticket.\n\nLeft luggage lockers\n\nThe station has luggage lockers if you want to leave your bags for a few hours or a day, see the luggage lockers page for details. The luggage lockers are on the lower level of the central hall, tucked away in the northeast corner behind an escalator, follow the signs to Consigne. Most lockers take credit cards, some lockers are operated with coins.\n\nTaxis\n\nThere's a well-organised taxi rank on the station forecourt in front of the station. Even if the queue looks long, it moves fast and it won't take much more than 10 minutes to get into a taxi.\n\nMetro. See the Crossing Paris by metro page for metro advice.\n\nFood & drink\n\nThe Brasserie La Consigne (formerly the Brasserie Flo) is the best place in the station for a coffee, beer or meal while waiting for your train. It's just inside the western entrance on the left. It was formerly the station's left luggage office or consigne. Update: The brasserie has closed down, it remains to be seen if another will open in the same space.\n\nLe Cafe de l'Est has also been recommended, a typical Parisian cafe directly across the road from the station, www.cafedelest.com.\n\nThere are plenty of kiosks around the station selling drinks, snacks, baguettes.\n\nThere's a Monop supermarket just across the road from the station forecourt and slightly to the right, useful for buying provisions for your journey at regular high street (rather than station) prices. I have marked it on the station plan above with a red trolley symbol.\n\nHotels near the Gare de l'Est\n\nIf you need to stop overnight, suggested hotels near Paris Gare de l'Est with good reviews include:\n\nLibertel Gare de l'Est Fran√ßais (opposite the station, 3-star);\n\nLibertel Gare du Nord Suede (350m from the Gare de l'Est, 2-star).\n\nThe OKKO Hotels Paris Gare de l'Est, alongside the station, on the side closest to the Gare du Nord.\n\nBack to 'Rail travel to Europe' general page"
