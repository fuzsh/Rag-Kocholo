        "text": "This route is less obvious and a couple of mins longer, but it has two ticks in its box\n\nIt avoids the staircase\n\nIt goes through a busier area, which makes it feel a tad safer.\n\nTake these steps:\n\n(1) When you reach the Gare Du Nord concourse when exiting from the Eurostar, turn to the left.\n\nYou want to head to the far side of the concourse, where the atrium which leads down to the RER trains is located.\n\nGo right when you reach it and exit through the street doors, so that you step outside the front of the station.\n\n(2) You're looking for the 'Rue de Saint Quentin' it's a street that leads ahead away from the station, the 'New Hotel' is on the street corner on the left hand side.\n\nHead down the Rue de Saint Quentin', at the third intersection, you'll come to a tree lined street, the 'Boulevard Du Magenta.\n\n(3) Turn left when you reach the 'Boulevard Du Magenta, and then an then at the next intersection, go left on to the 'Rue du 8 Mai 1945' - you'll see a McDonalds on the street corner\n\n(4) The Gare de l'Est is on the the 'Rue du 8 Mai 1945, it's one block over on the left.\n\nInside the Gare Du Nord there are no signs pointing the way.\n\nWhen you step off a train, you will walk ahead on to the main concourse which spans the station, but head to the left hand side of it (you'll be walking towards the atrium which leads to the parts of the station which are below street level).\n\nWhen you're on the far side of the station, with the atrium behind you, use an exit located across the front of the station (don't use a side exit) and then when you are outside the station, look to the left - a couple of blocks away you will see The Albert Hotel.\n\nAt the end of the street, turn right on to Rue DâAlsace and at the end of this street will be a flight of stairs leading DOWN to the Gare De LâEst â you canât miss the station, which will be over to the left\n\nHowever, think twice about making this journey on foot if you have heavy luggage, the stairs are steep and narrow; hence the suggestion of the alternative route below.\n\nAlso think twice about taking this route outside of daylight hours, this is not the smartest area of Paris.\n\nIt may seem an indulgence to use the Metro, as itâs only a one stop journey on Metro Line 5 (direction Place d'Italie).\n\nHowever, the access to/from Line 5 at both the Gare Du Nord and Gare De Lâest is easier than at most other Metro stations, escalators will help you to manage luggage down and up from the trains.\n\nSo it wonât take any longer than walking and if you can manage this one station hop, there's less of a risk of getting lost.\n\nIf you donât normally mind taking busy Metro trains and are considering walking to save on the cost of a Metro ticket, then our advice is to take the Metro, particularly if you will be making the transfer in the late evenings, or after darkness has fallen.\n\n1: The Silver Segway Tour is a mini-group tour so is ideal for a family or a group of friends.\n\nA guide will help you to take unforgettable photos along the route, which includes the Eiffel Tower â Field of Mars â The National Residence of the Invalids â The Pont Alexandre III â Museum of the Civilisation.\n\n2: The \"Paris And Versailles\" trip is a guided explorer tour that includes accommodation, transport and others and takes 5 days.\n\nWith the In-depth Cultural tour Paris and Versailles, you'll have a 5 days tour package taking you through Paris, France and Versailles.\n\n3: The Montmartre by Night tour of Paris in Citroen 2CV is the Paris excursion with a difference!\n\nYouâll begin your Montmartre by Night tour of Paris with a drive along the Avenue des Champs ElysÃ©es to the Arc de Triomphe, before passing by splendidly illuminated monuments such as the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nYour magical night time Paris excursion continues as you wend your way through Montmartre as you take in some of Parisâs best-known nightlife, including the Moulin Rouge and Pigalle district and then culminates at the SacrÃ© Coeur basilica\n\nAnd to make sure that you enjoy a truly sparkling experience, this Paris excursion comes complete with a complimentary bottle of champagne!\n\n4 This Champagne from Paris day tour will allow you to get acquainted with the region of Champagne, and try the most famous and wonderful drink which reflects the main traditions of France.\n\nGet to see three different Champagne producers, taste seven different types of champagne and enjoy an exquisite 4-course lunch at a vineyard.\n\nThis second version of ShowMeTheJourney is exciting and new, so we are genuinely thrilled that you are here and reading this, but we also need your help.\n\nWeâre striving not to let anything get in the way of providing the most useful service possible, hence a facility has been set up with DonorBox which can be used to support the running costs and make improvements.\n\nInstead of advertising or paywalls, your financial support will make a positive difference to delivering an enhanced service, as thereâs a lot of ideas which we want to make happen.\n\nSo if you have found the info provided here to be useful, please go here to say thank you."
