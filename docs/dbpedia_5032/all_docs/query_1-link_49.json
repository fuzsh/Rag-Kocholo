        "text": "Our one notable stop in Fribourg was to visit the Jean Tinguely Museum, where we stepped on red buttonson the floor to bring his strange art contraptionsto life. Shown above is the most impressive, said to warnof the dangers of consumer society. It made an eerie, wheezy calliope sound when it came to life.\n\nA walking path heads down from Gruyeres. At its base is the town'sparking lot, and to the right (hidden from view) is Ferme du Bourgoz B&B\n\nWe had a fine dinner on our second day in Gruyeres. By thetimewefinished eating, the day-trippers had pretty much cleared out.\n\nThis is how we spent most of our second day, lounging on the patio at Ferme du Bourgoz B&B (a workingfarmhouse) and sipping wine. We did venture up the hillside and into town for dinner -- and meringues!\n\nOn our way to Gruyeres we stopped in Fribourg, stored our bags at the train station, and had alook around. Fribourg is a vibrant universitytown that sits right on the “rostigraben” or linguisticdivide, where inhabitants on the west bank speak French and on the east bank speak German\n\nHere's something that doesn't seem to fit with the rest of Gruyeres: the H.R. Giger Museum, which showcases\n\nthe talents of native Swiss surrealist H. R. Giger, the Academy-Award-winning designer of the Alien films"
