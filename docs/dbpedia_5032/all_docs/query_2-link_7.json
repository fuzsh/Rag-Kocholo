        "text": "The 6 Paris Train Stations That Connect To The Rest Of France\n\nThere are six Paris train stations, or gares, taking passengers to destinations throughout France and the rest of Europe — Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare. France has one of the most developed railway systems in the world and it's easy to see why so many travelers choose to use trains over airplanes or automobile rentals.\n\nThe 19th-Century Gares of Paris\n\nThe railway system is convenient, safe and economical. The six train stations in Paris were built in the mid-to-late 1800s and early 1900s and retain a pleasing period feeling to them. (The exception is Gare Montparnasse, which was rebuilt in the late 20th century.) They look the way train stations should look. With your French train tickets in hand (or in your phone) you'll be traveling from one of the gares below.\n\nRomantic Dinner Cruises In Paris\n\nGare du Nord\n\nGare du Nord, in the 10th Arrondissement, is where you catch the Eurostar to London and other northern destinations in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It also an important hub in the Paris urban transportation network, including the RER and the Paris Metro. The RER train from Charles de Gaulle Airport (line B) connects at Gare du Nord. It's no wonder it's the busiest train station in the world (most likely).\n\nGare du Nord train destination highlights —\n\nTGV to Lille – London\n\nTGV to Brussels – Amsterdam\n\nTGV to Brussels – Cologne – Essen\n\nTGV to Brussels – Ostend\n\nGare de l'Est\n\nGare de l'Est is the near neighbor of Gare du Nord in the 10th Arrondissement, up against the 18th. It's one of the oldest train stations in Paris. This is where you'll leave from if you want to spend the day in Champagne. Trains from Gare de l'Est also head to other eastern points such as Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and even Moscow.\n\nGare de l'Est destination highlights —\n\nHigh-speed train to Berlin\n\nHigh-speed train to Innsbruck\n\nTGV to Reims (Champagne)\n\nTGV to Luxembourg\n\nExperience the Splendor Of Versailles\n\nGare de Lyon\n\nTravel over to the 12th Arrondissement, sort of at the intersection of the Canal St Martin and the Seine, and that's where you'll find Gare de Lyon. Built for travelers coming to Paris to attend Universal Exposition of 1900, this station with a clock tower is the hub for many southern destinations in France as well as cities of Switzerland and Italy. In fact, it's the gateway to the Rhone Valley, Provence, and the French Riviera.\n\nGare de Lyon train destination highlights —\n\nTGV to Lyon\n\nTGV to Avignon – Marseille\n\nTGV to Geneva\n\nTGV to Milan\n\nLe Train Bleu\n\nNamed after a famous train of yesteryear that sped Parisians to the Cote d'Azur, restaurant Le Train Bleu is still found today at Gare de Lyon, and it's still just as magnificent as when it opened in 1901, following a recent multi-year renovation. You're going to be amazed at the restored gilding, carved moldings, chandeliers, paintings, and ceiling frescoes.\n\nGare d'Austerlitz\n\nAcross the river from Gare de Lyon, on the border of the 13th and 5th Arrondissements, is Gare d'Austerlitz, the gateway to the center of France and even the Mediterranean coast. At one time, this was where you'd catch a night train to Spain, but all those legendary (and romantic) sleeper trains have been discontinued.\n\nThe station was built in 1838 when it was known as Gare d'Orléans, the terminus for trains traveling to that French city. Currently Austerlitz, one of the oldest Paris train stations, is being completely renovated and revamped to modernize the station and the neighborhood, to make them more green, and to add tracks for high-speed trains serving southwest France. You'll learn all about it in our guide.\n\nThe Highest-Rated Paris Activities\n\nGare Montparnasse\n\nParis train station Gare Montparnasse was also originally built in 1840 (as Gare de l'Ouest). It is the only train station in Paris to be demolished and rebuilt in the modern era — all part of a complex of office buildings and the Tour Montparnasse skyscraper, in an unfortunate wave of modernization that was in vogue among French politicians in the 1960s and 70s. (International tourists voted the tour the 2nd ugliest building in the world.) Hope is on the horizon, though, with a renovation (perhaps something like the illustration above? in the works.\n\nFrom here you'll access the west and southwest cities including Bordeaux, Tours, Nantes and Rennes. Gare Montparnasse is on Metro lines 4, 6, 12 and 13. It's a major urban terminus.\n\nGare Montparnasse train destination highlights —\n\nNormandy: Granville\n\nTGV to Brittany: Rennes, St. Malo, Brest\n\nTGV to the Loire Valley: Nantes, Angers\n\nCentral France: Chartres, Tours\n\nTGV to Poitou-Charentes\n\nTGV to Aquitaine: Bordeaux, Bayonne, Biarritz\n\nTGV to Midi-Pyrenees: Toulouse, Lourdes\n\nSpain: San Sebastian and Madrid\n\nPortugal\n\nGare Saint-Lazare\n\nImpressionist painters had a soft spot for this train station — both Edouard Manet and Claude Monet chose this railway station as the focus of many of their paintings. There's a famous story of how Monet showed up unannounced, with his painting equipment and his assistant in tow, and demanded to see the station master who was either so impressed or so confused that he \"posed\" the trains to The Master's instructions, blowing steam on his command."
