        "text": "**HEADING INTO THE BACK FOREST FROM FREIBURG BY TRAIN:\n\nAccessing the SchauinslandbahnÂ (Germanyâs longest cable car) from Freiburg Hbf:**\n\n(1) From Freiburg (Breisgau) Hbf take tram line 3 (direction Vauban) or Tram line 5 (direction Rieselfeld) to the Johanneskirche stop.\n\n(2) Connect there to tram line 21 (direction Gunterstal) and take this tram to the terminus at Gunterstal.\n\n(3) At the Gunterstal tram stop you can transfer to bus line 21 (direction Horben). Bus line 21 stops at the funicular base station â âSchauinslandbahn Talstation)\n\nThis sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is, all the connections run fairly frequently.\n\nYou can be tucking into a slice of Black Forest Gateaux and taking in the stunning views at the top of the mountain (one of the highest peaks in The Black Forest) within 90 mins of stepping off a train at Freiburg (Breisgau) Hbf.\n\n....................................................................\n\nThe Three Lakes Railway from Freiburg\n\nTrains travelling east from Freiburg to Neustadt (Schwarz) travel the scenic HÃ¶llentalbahn route and call at Titisee, where connections are available to the beautiful Dreiseenbahn (the Three Lakes Railway) between Titisee and Seebrugg.\n\nThough when heading to Seebrugg from Freiburg you have to wait in Titisee for around 30 mins to make the connection.\n\nThe line takes its name from the three lakes that it passes Titisee, WindgfÃ¤llweiher and Schluchsee.\n\nWhen you board the train at Titisee sit on the right (when facing the direction of travel) to see the views over these lakes.\n\nOn the journey the three lakes will be on left, but the train makes a 180 degree turn when it sets off on its journey.\n\nFeldberg-BÃ¤rental station is one stop from Titisee, it has bus connections to the car park at the base of the Feldberg, the highest mountain in Germany outside of the Alps.\n\nOn certain dates in the year steam trains operated by heritage railway group Interessengemeinschaft 3-Seenbahn e.V. make trips back and forth along The Three Lakes line between Titisee and Seebrugg and the full length of The HÃ¶llentalbahn between Freiburg and Donaueschingen.\n\nAn unusual feature of Freiburg Hbf, is that the tram stops at the station, are up on the bridge that spans the railway tracks.\n\nThis bridge, which is linked to the platforms/gleis at the station by stairs, escalators and lifts (which are behind the escalators), is at the south end of the station â so at the very front of trains arriving from the north (from Karlsruhe, Mannheim etc) and at the rear of trains arriving from Basel.\n\nIf you donât need to take a tram, or want to take a taxi, you can exit the station through its main building.\n\nIt is linked to gleis (platforms/tracks) 2 - 8 by a passage way beneath the tracks.\n\nEscalators and stairs link the gleis (platforms/tracks) to the passage way and there are escalators and a lift up into the main station building.\n\nThe heart of the city is under a 10 min walk from Freiburg (Breisgau) Hbf, walk straight ahead from the main exit on to the street named EisenbahnstraBe.\n\nTrains travelling east from Freiburg to Neustadt (Schwarz) travel the scenic HÃ¶llentalbahn route and call at Titisee, where connections are available to the beautiful Dreiseenbahn (the Three Lakes Railway) between Titisee and Seebrugg.\n\nThough when heading to Seebrugg from Freiburg you have to wait in Titisee for around 30 mins to make the connection.\n\nThe line takes its name from the three lakes that it passes Titisee, WindgfÃ¤llweiher and Schluchsee.\n\nWhen you board the train at Titisee sit on the right (when facing the direction of travel) to see the views over these lakes.\n\nOn the journey the three lakes will be on left, but the train makes a 180 degree turn when it sets off on its journey.\n\nFeldberg-BÃ¤rental station is one stop from Titisee, it has bus connections to the car park at the base of the Feldberg, the highest mountain in Germany outside of the Alps.\n\nOn certain dates in the year steam trains operated by heritage railway group Interessengemeinschaft 3-Seenbahn e.V. make trips back and forth along The Three Lakes line between Titisee and Seebrugg and the full length of The HÃ¶llentalbahn between Freiburg and Donaueschingen."
