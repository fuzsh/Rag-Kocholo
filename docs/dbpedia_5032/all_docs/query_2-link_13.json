        "text": "There are three train stations in Nice, France, and they’re all nice.\n\nNice-Ville is the main station and one of the most beautiful train stations in Western Europe. This busy transport interchange is your gateway to getting around the French Riviera by train, as well as going to Paris Gare du Nord, Monaco, Italy, and more.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Nice’s train stations.\n\nTrain talk: All about Nice’s train stations\n\nHow many train stations are in Nice, France?\n\nThere are three train stations in Nice, France: Nice St-Augustin is near the airport on the west side of the city, Nice-Ville is in the center of the city, and Nice Riquier is on the east side of the city near the port.\n\nWhat is the main train station in Nice?\n\nNice-Ville is the main train station in Nice. It’s located near Avenue Jean Médecin, about a seven-minute walk from the Basilique Notre-Dame de l’Assomption.\n\nIs there a train station at Nice Airport?\n\nNo, there is no train station at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport. There is a free tram line, however, which links Nice Airport with Nice St-Augustin train station, a ten-minute walk away.\n\nImage credit, Getty Images. Location, Nice-Ville Station, France.\n\nWhat’s the best way to get from Nice Airport to city center?\n\nTaking the tram from Nice Airport to Nice St-Augustin then Nice-Ville is the best way to get deep into the city. However, many first-time visitors take the bus from Nice Côte d'Azur Airport to Old Nice to let French Riviera views welcome them to Nice.\n\nWhat to know about Nice St-Augustin\n\nYou can walk or take the free tram to Nice St-Augustin from Nice Airport then hop the train to Antibes. The attractions near this small Nice train station include Nissa’venture outdoor adventure park, the Parc Phoenix animal park, and Asian Arts Museum.\n\nWhat to know about Nice Riquier\n\nA 20-minute walk from the port, Nice Riquier is on the eastern side of the city. You can hop the train to Monte Carlo, Monaco, and Menton, a French commune right on the border with Italy. If you’re famished before your departure, walk to Restaurant JAN for a multicourse Michelin-starred meal or plates of fromage at JAN’s cheese bar next door.\n\nEverything you need to know about Nice-Ville\n\nWhere is Nice-Ville train station?\n\nGare de Nice-Ville is a 19th-century train station located just over a mile from Old Nice and the beaches. After taking the free tram from Nice Airport to Nice St-Augustin train station, Nice-Ville is the next eastern station.\n\nIs Nice-Ville train station busy?\n\nYes, Nice-Ville is a busy station and can feel quite overwhelming for the first-time traveler, especially when you’re trying to purchase tickets at the kiosk and find your platform. Thankfully, you can just download the Trainline app, purchase etickets, and we’ll tell you which platform to find.\n\nImage credit, Getty Images, Giacomo Augugliaro. Location, Côte d'Azur, France.\n\nWhat are some popular Nice-Ville train station routes?\n\nMany travelers use Nice-Ville as a launch point to explore the French Riviera by train, going to Antibes, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez. Others use it to visit Italy and Monaco within minutes of departing Nice-Ville. The train from Paris to Nice is also a popular choice for travelers who want to experience the magic of Paris and bliss of the beach in the same trip.\n\nDo you need a passport to take the Nice-Ville train to Italy or Monaco?\n\nNo, since France and Italy are EU and Schengen countries, you do not pass through border control.

Stamp collectors should visit the tourist office to get their passport inked.\n\nAre there shops and restaurants at Nice-Ville train station?\n\nUnfortunately, what Nice-Ville has in beauty, it lacks in extensive amenities.
