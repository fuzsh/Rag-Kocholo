        "text": "The SNCF railway station is located on Avenue of the Soviet Union, a name that keeps you wondering when you discover the building's architecture! But getting there was easy. I discovered that the area has an interesting network of trains, and opposite the station there is a map of the urban bus network and stops, essential for anyone who has just arrived and wants to travel around Clermont and to its surroundings! In case you need to take a break from travelling, there is a small park a few meters away."
