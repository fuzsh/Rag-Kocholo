        "text": "Towards an ambitious transformation\n\nThe transformation of the Lyon Part-Dieu railway station by 2022, demonstrates its partners’ commitment and its clients’ determination to create an ambitious infrastructure project for the Lyon metropolis, the region and the national rail network.\n\nReinvention of a metropolitan hub\n\nThe Lyon Part-Dieu multimodal interchange is one of the gateways to the city and the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. The nerve centre of daily city business and tourist activities, all the various modes of transport converge in this hub.\n\nThe Lyon Part-Dieu multimodal interchange includes the leading European interchange rail station; the only French railway station ranked as important as the large Paris stations. In addition to accommodating TER services, national and European TGV (high-speed train) lines, not to mention the Eurostar, Lyon Part-Dieu has two unique features:\n\nIt is connected to 3 tram lines, one Metro line, a bus station and the bus line infrastructure, making it the main public transport interchange of the city of Lyon.\n\nIt is also used daily as a “route” to cross the railway lines and travel through the district from east to west.\n\nToday the railway station has multiple uses, serving the shopping centre, providing access to urban transport, as an arrival point for everyday workers, meeting place, etc. The redevelopment of the railway station and the multimodal interchange will make travel easier and offer a better user experience to city dwellers, travellers, shoppers, workers, day-visitors and other regular users.\n\nThe multimodal interchange is included in the reinvention of La Part-Dieu, since it is seen as a showcase by the people of Lyon and abroad. A large-scale building project is underway to design a new future for this metropolitan hub.\n\nGoals\n\nSolving railway station saturation\n\nAt the moment, the railway station cannot meet the growing demands of travellers. It was initially planned for 35,000 travellers a day and today this has more than tripled. The railway station hall is frequented by more than 125,000 people daily. It is frequently saturated every day and this results in uncomfortable over-crowding. 15-year forecasts show a progression in the number of users with up to 220,000 after 2030. By doubling the area, the project offers a long-term solution to the saturation of this railway station.\n\nDeveloping modes of transport together to enhance inter-modality\n\nThe public urban transport stations around the railway station are now frequented by roughly 170,000 users. Nearly 300,000 are expected by 2030. The project aims to relieve congestion in public transport hubs on a long-term basis by facilitating a large increase in the use of bikes and improving access to all soft modes of transport, making them hassle-free, more intuitive and convenient. Easy access by car (taxis, drop-off zone, deliveries, and parking spaces) will also be provided.\n\nInter-modality must enable travellers to experience quick and convenient end–to-end journeys through a seamless interchange. All the developments planned aim to improve passing from one mode of transport to another, making it easier to understand the complementarity of all methods of travel. The multimodal interchange will be designed to provide a continuous high quality service to travellers, whatever mode of transport they choose.\n\nIn relation to the development of the bus service and important lines, the creation of two bus stations are planned on the Vivier Merle side, on the north around the T1 station and on the south in front of the To-Lyon building. The railway station and the Rhônexpress station will also be improved.\n\nFavouring inter-modality involves accepting the railway station’s strategic position in the city.\n\nProviding shops and services satisfying travellers’ needs\n\nThe challenge is to combine city pleasure, convenience and practicality with the high performance expected. With its shops and services in the station, La Part-Dieu has always prioritised use and efficiency. The railway station is also a venue and meeting place in the city centre, with all that is needed to offer a good quality of life in the city. The Béraudier shopping mall and its various services must now address users’ daily travel needs to make them enjoyable and hassle-free. The railway station of the future must also drive urban vitality.\n\nFully integrated in the Lyon Part-Dieu urban project\n\nLyon Part-Dieu’s multimodal interchange redevelopment project is part of the reinventing Part-Dieu project, the aim of which is to make this city nerve centre more practical and functional, offering better services. The project also strives to improve the way in which the railway station fits into the district. Originally designed without coherent connections with the rest of the district, the railway station now offers a window on the city and the heart of Part-Dieu, with a shopping centre, library, Rue Bouchut and simpler pedestrian crossings on Boulevard Vivier Merle. Its connection to the east of the urban area is also improved with the redevelopment of Place de Francfort (square). This facelift to the gateway to the city is also reinforced by an iconic feature of the urban project: the To-Lyon.\n\nBoosting public transport\n\nThe Sytral project plans various alterations that will improve the public transport on offer:\n\nTramlines: the roll-out of additional tram cars according to traffic developments\n\nMetro B: automation of the line in the architect’s plan and the renewal of equipment will improve frequency and capacity.\n\nBus: roll-out of the twin site specific to line C3 on Cours Lafayette\n\nDevelopments\n\nCalendar\n\nThe first Lyon Part-Dieu multimodal interchange developments should be completed by 2022. Other phases will then follow on the North and East sides of the station.\n\nPhase 1: 2017 – 2023\n\nDemolitions beforehand and work on developments at the railway station, Place Béraudier and Place Francfort, as well as Boulevard Vivier-Merle and Avenue Pompidou. Construction of the To-Lyon.\n\nPhase 2: after 2023\n\nCompletion of the alterations to Place Francfort, enhancement of the North section of Place Béraudier.\n\nConstruction work will be carried out as the site continues to operate. It will therefore remain open throughout the redevelopment, since it is essential to maintain services for the 120,000 daily users. Several work phases have been planned with this in mind, so that there is as little impact as possible on the railway station’s daily operation.\n\nA little history\n\nThe Lyon Part-Dieu railway station was brought into operation on 13 June 1983 as part of the urban development project of the historical Part-Dieu mixed development zone (ZAC), with a view to accommodating Paris – Lyon TGVs (high-speed trains), replacing Les Brotteaux railway station. Designed after the introduction of the district’s other infrastructures, it immediately suffered from an absence of urban integration and a design initially focused solely on cars. Urban public transport increased between 1990 and the year 2000 and the railway station must now adapt to new forms of mobility."
