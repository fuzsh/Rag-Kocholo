So, the child's father would have been sent out from the Gare du Nord to the front lines during World War I along with many others. Additionally, in the coming of the First World War edited by R.J. W. Evans and Hartmut Pogge von Strndmann mentions that \"The boulevard seemed to shake with a continuous rumble of Nosie: the sound of hundreds of marching fleet, no fleur au fusil, no patriotic songs, just a steady shuffle, as regiment after regiment headed northwards in the direction of the Gare de L'Est and the Gare du Nord\". [6]\n\nAs a result, life would start to change for men, women, and children that would be in Paris while the war is going on. For instance, on August 22 about 27,000 French soldiers were killed during a fight one day near Belgian.[7] Additionally, the boarders between French and their enemies drew closer to Paris. Thus, there was a fear among the residence that Paris would be sieged very soon. Moreover, there was an allowance given too many households to help get the family through the war. For example, the daily allowance was 1.25 francs with an additional 0.50 for each child under 16. Moreover, the allowance was raised in 1917 to 1.50 francs per day and 1 franc per child because of the moral crisis in both the army and the citizens of Paris.[8] But, women were needed to work factory jobs to make ends meet in the household. On the other hand, working class children in Paris during this time experience forced labour to help the other family members such as picking berries, destroying weeds that could damage the crops and many more were the responsibilities of the school children.[9] In the end, the children in Paris still got impacted by the war because they were a generation too young to fight in World War I but the child would have still witness nationalist discourse."
