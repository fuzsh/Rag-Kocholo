        "text": "How much do you know about these major train stations in Paris? There are seven major train stations in Paris stations for trains that go beyond the Ile de France region. Here you’ll find a map to show the location of the main stations in Paris.\n\nWhich is the most beautiful Paris train station?\n\nWhich is the oldest train station in Paris?\n\nThe 7 major train stations in Paris\n\nGare du Nord. Let’s dive deeper into this station:\n\nThe largest and busiest railway station in Europe is Gare de Nord with 220 million travelers passing through every year. Also the hub for trains arriving and departing Paris on the Eurostar. …\n\nDo not miss this soundtrack from Gare du Nord – You know the sound! it takes you there immediately.\n\nYou’ll find it here on the page (see below)\n\nDid you know?\n\n– The façade of the building is the architectural highlight of the entire structure, topped by a large number of allegorical sculptures. The 8 biggest sculptures are allegorical representations of destinations outside of France. The 9th sculpture in the center of the façade represents Paris. On the lowest tier, are 14 sculptures that represent various cities in France & all across Europe.\n\n– The most remarkable feature of this building was the cast-iron pillars were used as drain pipes so the water could directly flow into the city’s sewers.\n\nGare du Nord in films\n\nThe Gare du Nord has served as a backdrop in numerous French films, such as Les Poupées Russes.\n\nIn Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love, Linda first meets Fabrice in the Gare du Nord when she runs out of resources and is sitting weeping on her suitcase.\n\nIn US movies, both the exterior and the interior of the Gare du Nord are seen in the 2002 film The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon and again in the trilogy’s finale, The Bourne Ultimatum, released in August 2007. It was also seen in Ocean’s Twelve in 2004, and Mr Bean’s Holiday in 2007. The ending of the 2012 movie The Raven by James McTeigue takes place at the station.\n\nScenes of Gossip Girl‘s episode “Double Identity” were shot inside the Gare du Nord.\n\nRemaining 6 Grand Train stations in Paris:\n\n2. Gare de l’Est\n\n3. Gare d’Austerlitz\n\n4. Gare de Bercy\n\n5. Gare de Lyon\n\n6. Gare Montparnasse\n\n7. Gare Saint-Lazare.\n\nConverted train stations in Paris worth knowing\n\nLet’s look at these old Parisian stations which have been saved by becoming restaurants, brasseries, concert halls, or museums. In their heyday, these stations welcomed and farewelled millions of travellers, and then for lack of profitability or attendance, were abandoned, before being reinvented and living a new life today.\n\na. NOW a Museum – THE GARE D’ORSAY\n\nAt the start of WWII, its function was limited to suburban traffic. After the war, the vast majority of the building was abandoned. Saved in 1971 from destruction, it was in 1977 that President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing decided to transform this huge abandoned building into a national museum. Inaugurated in December 1986, the Musée d’Orsay is now the second most-visited museum in Paris, after the Louvre.\n\nMusée d’Orsay – 1 Rue de la Légion d’Honneur, 75007 Paris, Metro: Solferino (line 12), Musée d’Orsay station (RER C)\n\nb. NOW home to Associations – REUILLY STATION\n\nThis former station located at 181 Avenue Daumesnil carried, from 1859 to 1969, millions of travelers on the Vincennes line. Superseded by the RER A, the line closed in inner Paris at the end of the 1960s.\n\nMaison des associations du 12e arrondissement – 181 Avenue Daumesnil, 75012 Paris, Metro: Dausmenil (lines 6 and 8)\n\nc. NOW numerous Hybrid & Cultural Places – PETITE CEINTURE\n\n–Le Hasard Ludique — 128 avenue de St-Ouen – 75018 Paris – La Recyclerie — (former Ornano station), 83 boulevard Ornano – 75018 Paris\n\n– La Gare — 1 avenue Corentin Cariou – 75019 Paris\n\n– La Station — 29 avenue de la Porte d’Aubervilliers – 75018 Paris\n\n– Andia — (formerly Restaurant La Gare), 19 chaussée de la Muette, 75016 Paris\n\n– Le Poinçon — Avenue du Général Leclerc – 75014 Paris\n\n– Le Hasard Ludique — (former Avenue de Saint-Ouen station) – 128 avenue de Saint-Ouen, 75018 Paris, Metro: Porte de Saint-Ouen (line 13)\n\nAnd finally, Brasserie Auteuil — (former Gare Auteuil-Boulogne) – 78 Rue d’Auteuil, 75016 Paris, Metro: Porte d’Auteuil (line 10)\n\nHow many of these stations have you seen? Did you know the stories behind them? Which is your favourite Grand Station? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nI would be very grateful should you decide to subscribe to ‘le Bulletin’ (free or paid).\n\nIt will help me continue to build ‘le Bulletin’ – the weekly newsletter of MyFrenchLife.org Magazine – to be even better.\n\nMerci Mille Fois"
