        "text": "You will need to present to our customer representative: 1) your normal driver's license, issued by your country of residence and held for a minimum period according to local legislation or conditions. It will be requested at every rental. In addition to your normal Driving Licence, your International Driving Licence is also mandatory if your driving licence is written in a language different to the one of the renting country and/or in characters that can not be read in the renting country. Note that your International Driving Licence is valid only if accompanied by your normal Driving Licence. Driving Licences must be valid in the country of rental. 2) your identification document such as your passport (or your national identity card) 3) your valid credit card with an expiry date after the due check-in date. If you use a Europcar prepaid voucher as mean of payment (with a specified value or the mention 'Group & Days apply'), you must also present a credit card for those charges which have not been prepaid (such as extras, refueling charge, deposit). Please check the list of accepted credit cards in the country rental conditions. NOTE: Points 1) and 2) are applicable to all additional drivers, if any.\n\nRules applicable to fuelling and refuelling depend on the country of rental and the type of rental product you have selected. Please carefully check the rules applicable for every rental you make. Usually vehicles are supplied with a full tank of fuel. Below are the three main fuelling and refuelling scenarios: 1. Return the vehicle with the same level of fuel in the tank as it had when you picked it up: We provide you with a vehicle with a full tank of fuel or a determined level of fuel which will be indicated on the Rental Agreement. You return the vehicle with that same level of fuel. You pay nothing to Europcar for refuelling. Please note that Europcar may require you to provide a proof of fuel purchase (receipt). 2. Return the vehicle with less fuel in the tank than it had when you picked it up (refuelling charge): If you have not taken our Full Tank Option (see point 3 below) and the vehicle is not returned with at least the same level of fuel that it had at pick-up time, you will be charged the cost of the missing fuel, plus a refuelling charge. 3. Full Tank Option At vehicle pick up you have the option to pay for the price of a full tank of fuel upfront. The cost of this will depend on the vehicle category. You may return the vehicle with whatever fuel is left in it and you will not be charged for refuelling. Please note, with this option Europcar will not reimburse you for any unused fuel."
