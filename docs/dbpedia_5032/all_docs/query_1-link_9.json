Within the framework of our new design, the Fontaine Jo Siffert by Jean Tinguely is given a dignified setting.The elimination of the canopy offers a historically unique opportunity to create a modern entry to the city for the railway station forecourt of Fribourg. Within the framework of our new design, the Fontaine Jo Siffert by Jean Tinguely is given a dignified setting.\n\nThe balanced proportions of the forecourt of the old and new train station emerge once again as a result of a generous gesture for the public square between the two high-rise buildings. Eliminating the canopy in front of the station gives us the opportunity to link the two areas of the square by means of uniform surfacing and to amalgamate them to create a spacious urban square. In line with the motto “Platz schaffen!” (Make Space), we emphasize the new openness of the railway station forecourt so as to create a concise open space and be able to stage Jean Tinguely’s Fontaine Jo Siffert in a prominent way. Various qualities for spending time are inscribed in the area of the public square in order to address the needs of both residents of the city district and commuters and travellers. Near the fountain, a grove of tall trees accommodates a pavilion with a kiosk and a flower shop. Staging the Bahnhofsstrasse as a new city boulevard further upgrades the railway station forecourt."
