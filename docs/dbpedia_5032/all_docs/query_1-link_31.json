        "text": "Accessible by either private car or public transport, the Hotel is ideally located at the entrance to the city centre. It's a quick trip to the train station and an easy drive to the industrial zones at the outskirts of the city. By car, the \"Fribourg North\" exit on highway A12 is located 2.4 km from the hotel, so it will be easy to reach us. From the highway, take Rue de Morat until the Place de la Grenette. And now you're here!\n\nArrival by train: Fribourg station is served by the Intercity Line that connects Saint-Gall - Zürich Intercity line (airport) - Bern - Fribourg - Lausanne - Geneva (airport). From the train station, you can walk to the hotel in 10 minutes. If you are using public transport, take bus line 1, 2, or 6 and get off at the \"Tilleul\" bus stop.\n\nHôtel de la Rose\n\nRoute de Morat 1\n\nCH - 1700 Fribourg\n\nTél. 0041 26 351 01 01"
