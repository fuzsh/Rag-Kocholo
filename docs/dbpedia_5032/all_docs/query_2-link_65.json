        "text": "“ Don't be bemused, it's just the news. The mayor of Paris will be unveiling the Startrain, right here at the Gare du Nord train station. This ultra-modern train will travel between France and the UK at record speeds, faster than flying by plane! ”\n\n—Nadja Chamack, \"Bakerix\"\n\nThe Gare du Nord, officially known as Paris-Nord, is the train station that the Startrain stops at in Paris, France. \"Gare du Nord\" literally translates to \"Station of the North\". Furthermore, \"Paris-Nord\" simply translates to \"Paris-North\". A real life place, it is the busiest railway station in the western world,[2] serving over 200 million passengers a year.[3]\n\nSee also[]\n\nSee Wikipedia:Gare du Nord\n\nSightings[]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nOthers[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Gare du Nord is actually first seen in \"Animaestro\", after Ladybug cuts off the city's access to watching the akuma battle, and the citizens look up at the station's TVs in surprise.\n\nThe first time the characters actually go to the location is in \"Bakerix\", when Ladybug and Cat Noir have to stop Bakerix from destroying the Startrain.\n\nThe station has large banners on its facade that advertise the Startrain in \"Bakerix\", but they are removed in subsequent episodes, when the Startrain is no longer a brand new installment.\n\nIn \"Miracle Queen\", this is where Marinette finds the locker with Master Fu's letter for her. This is also where she has to say goodbye to him and Marianne when they depart on the Startrain.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences[]"
