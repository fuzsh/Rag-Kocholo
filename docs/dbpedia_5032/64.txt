Book in Advance:

Just like with airfares, train ticket prices tend to rise as the departure date gets closer. Booking weeks or even months in advance can save you a significant amount.

Travel During Off-Peak Hours:

Avoid traveling during peak times such as weekday mornings and evenings. Opt for midday, late evening, or mid-week rides when there's less demand.

Consider Slower Trains or non direct routes:

Express or high-speed trains might save time, but they're often pricier. Opting for regional or slower services can reduce your fare.

Look for Special Deals and Promotions:

Train operators occasionally have promotions or special deals, especially during off-peak seasons. It's worth signing up for newsletters. Additionally, there are sometimes group or return ticket discounts, so consider these options if they fit your travel plans.
