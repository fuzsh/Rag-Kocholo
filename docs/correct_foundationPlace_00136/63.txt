Quality software for document management, pre-press & the graphic arts

Apago, Inc., founded in 1991, is a software company headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, north of Atlanta. We provide retail applications, custom programming, private label OEM products, consultation and support for a diverse customer base.

Our goal is to provide high-quality software solutions to streamline electronic document management and publication workflows. Apago is uniquely qualified in this arena with expertise in PDF, PostScript and high-end graphics file formats like TIFF/IT and Scitex NCT/NLW.

Innovation

Apago works closely with its retail and OEM customers and various industry groups to identify new opportunities. Apago is always innovating. We developed some of the first products for the large format printing and OPI server markets.

Apago's Piktor software was among the first products to produce TIFF/IT filesets. PDF/X Checkup was the first shipping desktop product to create PDF/X files. PDFshrink was released within weeks of Apple's release of MacOS X to address the file size issues with Mac OS X generated PDF documents. PDF Enhancer 3.0 continues this innovation with groundbreaking new techniques like Searchable Outlines to resolve font management issues and Selective Rasterization for reducing complexity and file size in PDF.

International standards

Our company and staff actively support international standards efforts. We have programmers currently working as active members of standards organizations developing and overseeing a host of standards including JDF, PDF/A, TIFF/IT, PDF/X and PPML/VDX.
