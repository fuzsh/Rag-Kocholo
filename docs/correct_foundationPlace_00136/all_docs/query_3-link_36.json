        "text": "Electronic copies of books are becoming increasingly common. Examples of these include noned-itable PDF files, or fully editable books based on the Wiki model17. Electronic books are well suited to engineering; they allow very fast updates, they are easy to access, they do not require the bulk of paper, they are easily searchable, and they allow multiple/alternate sources. So, this begs the question, why are there so few electronic books in use in higher education? In part, this is because many of the commercial books are not available electronically. Although some publishers are exploring ways to make their collections available electronically these efforts are still in their infancy. However, a larger puzzle is in the step away from paper to purely electronic media. For example, consider the following problems. How do you write notes or slip a page into a fixed PDF file? Is the document you are viewing on your machine or on the network? Who can change the docu-ment? What happens i...\n\nResearch has been carried out which aims to improve the understanding of the concept of electrical circuit material through a practicum method using an electric circuit trainer that is made and developed using tools and materials in Merauke. Product development is carried out by making electrical circuit props, if usually the electrical circuit practicum uses a cable as a connection to the electric current on the development that has been carried out the cable is replaced with PCB (Printed Circuit Board). Questionnaire response to the use of dynamic electric circuit props 0.745> 0.05 and learning outcomes / posttest 0.971> 0.05, the questionnaire response data using teaching aids and student learning outcomes are normally distributed. Significance value (Sig.) For each data obtained is greater than the significance value of 0.05. The ttable value = 1.699 and from the table data above shows that tcount 11.045> t table 1.699 with a significance value of 0.00 <0.05 for the influence of the application of dynamic electric props on student learning outcomes, where there is an effect of the application of teaching aids to student learning outcomes."
