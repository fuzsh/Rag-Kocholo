        "text": "1. 2016 Edition\n\n2. Global OfficeWorks supports you with a team of specialized Real Estate Virtual Assistants (VA) and Inside Sales Agents (ISA). While our Inside Sales Agents are setting you appointments with qualified Buyers and Sellers, our Virtual Assistants are managing your administrative tasks, which frees up your time to do what makes you the most money, meeting with Buyers and Sellers! We Provide, Support, Train and Manage your ISA’s and VA’s in our office! Our level of support for your team is unrivaled in the marketplace. We not only help you drastically reduce your employment costs, but our knowledge, systems and support of your VA are not something you can replicate in house. By calling property owners every day, our ISA’s have a proven ability to setup 1-3 listing appointments for you per month, with qualified Sellers who want to list their property now. We can also capture and nurture all your Buyer leads, which may be currently slipping away from you. Our staff are all legally employed, supported, and managed by us, but they work for you. We ensure their productivity, allowing you to work on your business, not work in your business. We are an international company registered with the Colorado Secretary of State, recorded on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s (ASIC) register, and incorporated with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines. Why Use Global OfficeWorks?\n\n3. IN-HOUSE SALES AGENTS  Sellers Setting Listing Appointments with FSBO’s and other unlisted property owners. Our ISA’s call each property owner listed with third party property sales websites to set an appointment with the agent if an owner is interested in listing their property.  Buyers Leads Follow up. Our ISA’s call each attendee who signed into your property inspection. From our qualification process, we determine if they are looking to buy or sell. If so, we set up an appointment for them to meet with an agent. Our ISA calls every Buyer inquiry, qualifies them and if qualified, sets an appointment for them to meet with an agent. REAL ESTATE VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS  Administrative Duties  Marketing and Advertising  MLS and Website Management  Closing and Transaction Management  Prospecting  Customer Relations Management  BPO / REO  Many others How we drive business to yours?"
