Our current mutation testing score measured by Stryker Mutator is at 90%, which is very high and allows us to develop features without fearing of breaking existing usecases.\n\nMichelle CEO of Tech company\n\nWithout docxtemplater we would'nt have been able to ensure data consistency which is what our clients expect. Any time we had an issue, the support team was alway present to respond quickly.\n\nErik Kramer Founder and CEO at Cloud++ B.V\n\nThe docxtemplater module helped our company a lot - it works well, even with a complex setup. I would personally like to thank the author, Edgar Hipp, for quick responses and fixes if they were needed. Edgar generally responded to our emails within a working day and fixed most bugs within 2 working days.\n\nAnonymous Senior Software Engineer, NY-based Web Application Development Company\n\nDocxtemplater has been a spectacular library to use for generating documents from custom templates. It contains a wide array of features, including styling with HTML, images, and merging multiple documents together, all of which we use extensively. Edgar has been quick to respond to any concerns or usecases that we wanted to support, and we appreciate all the work that he has done for this library. We greatly advocate the use of his library, for it is a awesome library backed by an awesome developer!\n\nAllan Ebdrup CTO at Debitoor\n\nOnce again: This is an awesome module!\n\nPaulo Castagnari CTO - Azume\n\nOne of our core features is business proposals generation, which previously we were able to by using the browser's native print for saving an HTML template as a PDF file, however with a very limited degree of customization.\n\nNow, with docxtemplater we are able to offer our customers much more customized business proposals. All of that with an affordable price and unlimited document generation (differently than many other SDKs out there, which are extremely expensive and have really restrictive monthly requests limits).\n\nIf you're are looking for a file templating solution with easy implementation, good support and fair prices, look no further. 100% recommend docxtemplater.\n\n@ssured Sjoerd de Jong Owner - Racido BV\n\nFirst thanks for this lib. Using docx as a template is an awesome smart thing to do, great you made this stuff!\n\nDwight Kelly President at Apago Inc\n\nWe needed a comprehensive templating engine for Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint that allowed us to modify existing documents. Our requirements included updating styles for any element and replacing images & text placeholders. After testing all available commercial and open-source libraries we selected docxtemplater. The docxtemplater team has provided awesome support - answering our questions, fixing problems and continuously improving the product's capabilities. We couldn't ask for a better partner!\n\nMartin Polasek CEO - Inventify\n\nI can highly recommend docxtemplater as a library for generating documents from custom templates. It is easily extendible, very fast and easy to use. Edgar has been extremely helpful and always available to get the most of the library. One of the best support experience I have ever made!\n\nTom Newby CoFounder at ProcurePro\n\nDocxtemplater is a fantastic product that solves a pretty technical problem. Edgar provides high quality support and has been able to resolve some tricky issues for us. Would recommend!\n\nTomas Theunissen Senior developer at MoreApp\n\nWe have been using docxtemplater to generate Word documents for quite a while and it has been a joy to use. Besides this awesome library, the support by the docxtemplater team is one of the best, replying to our question within the hour and even including a fix!\n\n@cades hong-jen kao Full-stack Web Developer\n\nThanks for your time and effort, I really appreciate it :)\n\nAnonymous Senior Frontend Developper - at 22-year old company\n\nFrom a technolgy perspective the software is nice and lightweight, as it just needs to be brought in as a nodejs dependency. Most of the other solutions we looked at required loading a whole application stacking including base operating system, open office, plus bloated Java libraries, which I wasn't keen on.\n\nAndrew Dravucz Senior Product Developer - Athennian\n\nMy team and I primarily work on building and maintaining document generation in Athennian. Thanks to all of docxtemplaters tools available, we are able to have document syntax thats easy to use for both internal and external users. Support has been very responsive and have been able to implement fixes within a day or two of bugs being reported. Would highly recommend docxtemplater for generating documents from templates!\n\nRonny Lewandowski SharePoint-Architect at Zeppelin GmbH\n\nDocxtemplater and especially the HTML module have helped us meet needs that other tools could not by providing a versatile and powerful solution for generating dynamic and customizable documents directly from templates, streamlining our document creation process and providing a seamless integration into our existing systems and workflows. Edgar provides an outstanding support, his tools are awesome.\n\nWhat is the difference between plans and modules ?\n\nDocxtemplater is an open-source project, which has basic features for templating. All paid features are available in modules, for example the HTML module allows inserting formatted text with bold, italic, links. All modules can be bought separately for a yearly fee. There are also three plans, the PRO plan, the ENTREPRISE plan and the PREMIUM plan that gives you access to a set of modules.\n\nDoes the license allow me to use the software in a SaaS product ?\n\nYes, the license model is suitable for Software as a Service businesses. As long as you are the entity running docxtemplater software, you can use the standard licenses.\n\nIf you need to redistribute the software by installing it on your customers servers, this will need a specific \"appliance\" license. The standard license does not allow to redistribute the software. The Appliance license plan is 4500â¬ per year for PRO and 10000â¬ per year for ENTREPRISE version. It allows you to distribute the modules contained in the PRO or ENTREPRISE module as part of your application. You are not allowed to resell the modules as is.\n\nCan I convert the generated document to a PDF file ?\n\nIt is not possible to convert docx to PDF with docxtemplater, because docxtemplater is a templating engine and doesnât know how to render a given document. We recommend to use libreoffice headless for a free tool or PDFTron for a paid alternative.\n\nAbout\n\nDocxtemplater is a product made by Coding Puffin\n\nHello, I'm Edgar Hipp, the creator of docxtemplater. I've been doing Node.JS development for 10 years. Docxtemplater is my full-time job since 2019.
