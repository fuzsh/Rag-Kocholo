        "text": "To open Launchpad, click it in the Dock or open it from your Applications folder. Or pinch closed with your thumb and three fingers on your trackpad.\n\nIf you don't see the app in Launchpad, type its name in the search field at the top of Launchpad. If you have more than one page of apps, you can switch pages by clicking the dots at the bottom of the screen, or by swiping right or left with two fingers on your trackpad.\n\nClick the Delete button next to the app that you want to delete, then click Delete to confirm. The app is deleted immediately.\n\nFind the app that you want to delete, then click to select it. Most apps are in your Applications folder, which you can open by clicking Applications in the sidebar of any Finder window. Or choose Go > Applications from the menu bar in the Finder. Or use Spotlight find and show the location of the app.\n\nIf you're asked for a user name and password, enter the name and password of an administrator account on your Mac. This is usually the name and password you use to log in to your Mac.\n\nYou can't use the Finder to delete apps that are required by your Mac. This includes many apps that are installed by macOS, such as Mail, Music, Books, Notes, Podcasts, Maps, News, and Stocks.\n\nIf you can't delete an app because your Mac says that it's in use, make sure that the app isn't open. If necessary, restart your Mac or start up in Safe Mode, then try again.\n\nUninstalling or deleting an app doesn't remove any documents or other files that you may have created with the app. It also doesn't cancel any subscription that you may have purchased with the app. Learn how to cancel subscriptions for apps that were downloaded from the App Store.\n\nIf your app came with a separate uninstaller app, which usually includes \"Uninstall\" or \"Uninstaller\" in the name, you can open the uninstaller and follow its instructions to remove the app from your Mac."
