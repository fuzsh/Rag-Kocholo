        "text": "In this paper, three novel schemes have been presented for organizing the secret bits inside between words spaces of cover-text before embedding process starts. The primary scheme conceals one bit within each between-words space; the second conceals a group of bits in the assembly of between-words spaces to control the span of cover-text and third scheme designate a lesser number of bits to higher frequencies letters improving payload with a controlled measure of stego-cover-content. Innovative algorithm for implanting and extricating have been proposed for making an interpretation of secret content into a remarkably secured encoded frame thereby acquire secret bits at that point choose any of three bits arranging plans finally inserted into focused locations of PDF cover-file. The proposed extraction process provides authentication of received stego-cover file such that only desired file is acknowledged for the extraction process otherwise fake file is discarded by a recipient. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed technique provides productive algorithms in the term of high payload, enhanced security of hidden information and work well against steganalysis attack.\n\nThis paper describes several innovative PDF document enhancements and tools that can be used when building a digital library. The main result presented in this paper is the PDF re-compression tool, developed using the jbig2enc encoder called pdfJbIm. This re-compression tool enables the size of the original bitonal PDFs to be, on average, downsized by one third. Some modifications to the jbig2enc encoder that increase the compression ratio even further are also described here. Together with another program, the pdfsizeopt.py by Péter Szabó, we have managed to decrease PDF storage size to such an extent that the transmission needs of a digital library were significantly reduced. We report the storage saving results that we have achieved on The Czech Digital Mathematics Library DML-CZ — we have downsized the PDF corpus to 43% of its original size. We also describe pdfsign tool for batch digital signature stamping of PDF documents."
