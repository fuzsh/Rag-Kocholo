EIGHTEENTH EDITION, ep:vist:d tueoughout, and geeatx.y enlaeged. LONDON : • LONGMAN, BROWN, GREEN, AND LONGMANS, PATKRNOSTER-ROW. 1848. I London ; Spottiswoodb and Shaw New-street- Square. 1 INTEODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS TO THE FIRST EDITION. That regard for brevity which I have shown throughout this laborious, but, I trust, not useless Volume, will be evinced, as far as may be consistent with per- spicuity, in my Introductory Observations. The plan of the Work, though novel, is simple ; and its contents, thongh varied, are for the most part such as require little more than a recapitulation of their several heads : in short, if the utility of the design be not apparent, it would be unreasonable to expect that anything which might here be offered could render it so. To discuss the nature or merits of one’s own performances is, indeed, at all times dangerous, inasmuch as it is extremely difficult to say all that may be con- sidered necessary, without incurring the charge of egotism ; and, in truth, I feel so little desire for the kind of notoriety which Authorship confers, that did not experience convince me how Injurious it has been to my interests to evade the literary responsibility attached to my own productions, how humble soever their character, “ THE TREASUHY OF KNOWLEDGE AND LLBKARY OF REFERENCE,” in all probability, would either have been anonymously ushered into the world, or have appeared as the work of another. To what extent I may carry a publication to which I have given so compre- hensive atitle,>ill naturally be determined by future contingencies ; at present it is sufficient to observe, that no inconsiderable progress has been made in preparing suitable materials for a Continuation. But this volume is complete in itself, and, as far as it goes, is intended to supply a deficiency felt by all who have not access to good libraries, or whose means are too limited to purchase larger works of reference ; while it is believed there are not a few who will consider that the unusual portability of a volume, in which so great a mass of useful matter is combined, is a desideratum for the youthful student. Judicious condensation has been my aim throughout ; and, in endeavomnng to avoid pro- lixity, I hope I have not been led into the opposite extreme : how far I have succeeded, the public, whose candour is seldom appealed to in vain, must de- cide. I will therefore no longer trespass on my circumscribed limits, than to make such concise observations ns appear indispensable, in noticing the various contents of the work. As the “ Veto and enlarged Dictionary of the Englieh Language ” forms the main feature of Part I., my observations will properly commence with it ; and, in so doing, I feel no hesitation in premising, that, if its size and price be con- sidered, there is no publication with which it may not safely bear the closest comparison ; for. Independently of having introduced every well-authorized word which the largest Dictionaries contain, I have atlded, from the works of the most correct English writers of the present day, a numerous list of useful and significant words, the definitions of which I have never been able to meet with in any lexicographical work hitherto published. I feel it necessary to lay some stress upon this, because, although I court comparison, I am aware there are few persons who will take the trouble to ascertain the fact by making sucli comparison. But it is not merely the number of Words which a Dictionary may contain that gives to it a value.- In the progress of literature, not only arc new words introduced into every living language, but a modification, and oftentimes a total change, takes place in the meanings of many already in use ; while some grow obsolete, and others, which once, perhaps, formed part of the Introtrurtarj) cSl3^n-bntt0n^. phraseologr of polished society, are destined at a subsequent period to be known only as cant terms or vulgar jargon. Upon this head so much might be said, that I find it difficult to confine my remarks to the brief limits I have pre- scribed for them. I can, however, assure the reader, that in the following pages tliis has been steadily kept in view. On nothing connected with the principles of language is there so great a di- versity as in the rules laid down by different Lexicographers for fixing a correct and uniform system of Spelling j and as few of them invariably abide by their own rules, it can excite no surprise that the want of uniformity and consistency is so apparent. Orthography is, in fact, too often subject to the caprice of authors i or the arbitrary laws of fashion, to be governed for any great length of time on settled principles i and those who have noticed the verbal pedantry that may be discovered in one writer, or the affectation that may be seen in another (to say notlung of the great change that Orthography undergoes, as it were by common consent, in the lapse of a few generations) wUl readily subscribe to the j truth of what I have advanced. j Whoever has devoted his time to the compilation of an English Dictionary, I must confess how much he owes to the mental energy of that profound philo- logist who so pre-eminently overcame the difficulties by which he was sur- roimded -, yet the preceding observations could be abundantly confirmed by a reference to his own erudite work. The laws of language are not immutable ; and the most that can be done to insure their permanence, is to consult analogy and etymological precision, in order to preserve a consistent tmiformity. The practice of the best writers of the present century has been decidedly at variance with many of Dr. Johnson’s examples in Orthography : how useless, then, would it be to resist the popular current, unless, indeed, it had its source in manifest error, and was continued in violation of obvious propriety. Need I illustrate this remark by naming any other instanee than the uniform exclusion of the letter fc, in all such words as critic*, music* public*, &c. ? Modem usage has decided the point, and all the pains which have been taken by the “ improvers ” of Johnson to perpetuate it, have proved useless and euperogatory. I may here remark, that notwithstanding I have inserted many scientific words, and others which are purely technical, it was impossible that the Volume could be rendered perfect in that particular j but I have reason to anticipate that far more terms of art wiU be found contained in it than could be well expected. Should I proceed with my design, an indulgent public will hereafter have to determine, how far a compendious vocabulary of such terms can be rendered compatible with practical utility. Although this is not a “Pronouncing” Dictionary, according to the common acceptation of the term, it will perhaps be expected that, in the Introductory Observations, there should at least be some reference to English Orthoepy. I have endeavoured to give this subject all the attention its importance demands ; and, in so doing, I have minutely examined those unsightly combinations of letters and figures, through the means of which a just pronunciation has been sought to be established. Far be it from me to wish to detract from the merits of any. No small degree of patience was necessary for sucli an undertaking ; and I am ready to admit that much skill and ingenuity have been displayed in the ' various attempts. But, has the end in view been attained ? With becoming I diffidence, I hope, but certainly with a full conviction that I have judged rightly, I I venture to affirm, that an absolute reliance on any of these systems must end in 1 disappointment. By constant reference, or tedious dictation, such modes may | somewhat facilitate orthoepical instruction 5 but even those who have pursued i tliem with most advantage will find, that, instead of having obtained any rational Introtfuftrrry Oft'Jcr&atfnu^. guide for the correct p^onunciatio^ of words, they will often, very often, be left to the mere mechanical operation of the memory. In fact, I have never known an instance of Orthoepy having been studied in this way, in which the learner did not continually discover his own helplessness, as well as the imbecility of the system, either by his want of confidence when he met with a word with which he did not happen to be familiar, or by some ludicrous misconception of his “ pro- nouncing” instructor. Dr. Johnson observes, that “most writers of English Grammars have given long tables of words pronounced otherwise than they are written ; and seem not sufficiently to have considered, that, of English, as of all living tongues, there is a double pronunciation : one, cursory and colloquial ; the other, regular and solemn. The cursory pronunciation is always vague and un- certain, being made different, in different mouths, by negligence, nnskilfulness, or affectation. The solemn pronunciation, though by no means immutable and permanent, is yet always less remote from the orthography, and less liable to capricious innovation. They have, however, generally formed their tables ac- cording to the cursory speech of those with whom they happened to converse, and, concluding that the whole nation combines to vitiate language in one manner, have often established the jargon of the lowest of the people as the model of speech.” For my own part, I consider that a correct pronunciation, like a polite address, is seldom thoroughly acquired without an intercourse with good society, or the advantage of having received instruction, in early life, from persons whose previous habits and studies qualified them for the task ; and such, I presume, are the majority of those who undertake the education of respectable youth. As far as any assistance can be derived from a careful accentuation of the words, that assistance may be found here ; the accentual mark being placed not merely on the emphatic syllable, but on the right letter of that syllable ; and, where the use of the double accent would better explain the intention, it has been invariably adopted. [See also “ Concise Directions ” at the end of Part I.] For a considerable time post I have been collecting and arranging materials for a philological work, in which more than ordinary attention will be paid to rhe- torical acciuacy, and, consequently, to the powers of letters in their various com- binations ; but I found it much too diffuse for my present purpose, and being unwilling to mutilate that which at some future period may appear in a complete form, I was glad to avail myself of the Compendium herein printed, which, under the title of \" The Miniature English Grammar,” * has already received the ap- probation of discerning critics. The “Engiish Verbal Distinctions,” which follow, are, I trust, not less appropriate : the mode of classing them is both novel and discriminative : and I feel satisfied they will be well received by all who take the trouble to examine them. Part n. commences with a iTeio Universal Gazetteer; in which, I believe, all the information really necessary in a work of geographical reference will be found condensed. It cannot be expected that copious descriptions of every place could be given, but no important features have been omitted, nor has anything that could add to its usefulness been overlooked. Appended to the Gazetteer, are se- veral Statistical Tables, which, together with IVic List of Cities, Market-Towns, Boroughs, Sec. of the United Kingdom, have been derived from the best sources for accuracy, and cannot fail to be serviceable. The Compendious Classical Dictionary, it will be seen, is far more compre- hensive than the usual abridged accounts of the Heathen Deities j and, tliough • Upon a close eiamlnallon of thcOnAHMAR, It w.is thought expedient to make some material additions and alterations in various parts. It l», consequently, rather less concise than l«fore ; but the Kdltor humbly presumes that the few auditional pages add to the utility of the volume. A 3 intraHurtorj) c^fi^abation^. it may not contain all that the classical reader might desire, will greatly assist those who have not larger works on the subject. Subjoined to this is a List of Scripture Proper Names, accented, wliich, particularly for youth, will also be found useful. An Analysis of General History comes next. Instead of the usual method of recording the leading events of History, in chronological order, from the Creation downwards, I have arranged them alphabetically ; thereby adapting it to the I general character of the work, as one principally intended for reference ; and con- , densing a vast quantity of matter into a small compass. It is worthy of remark, I too, that although its confined limits precluded the possibility of making it com- plete as a work of reference to Universal History, yet it will materially serve that end, and be a perfect index to the principal occurrences in the history of our own country in particular. The Dictionary of Law Terms was written by me for a former publication. I have now, however, made many additions to it ; and I trust that unprofessional readers will become better acquainted with the meaning of legal terms and phrases by a perusal of tlxis epitome, divested ns it is of all technicalities, than if they even took the trouble to consult professional books. With respect to the various Tabular Addenda with which the work is concluded, I have only to hope that such have been selected as are most useful for general purposes. And now, the body of the Work having passed, as it were, in brief review before me, I come to speak, though last not least, of the novel, and, as it may be thought, whimsical manner in which each page is garnished. If I had no other plea for its I adoption than that of novelty, I should not, great as the attractions of novel^ are, have felt myself justified in travelling out of the beaten path. But I make no scruple in owning, that I am so impressed with the value of those gems of wisdom which have been handed dorvn to us in the form of aimpthegms, that I gladly seized an opportunity of enriching the pages of a book with them, which, unless I greatly overrate its qualities, will find its way into numerous schools and families, and, consequently, meet the eye of youthful readers. To them I would say, that I sincerely hope many of these brief lessons of experience may be en- graven on the tablet of the memory, never to be erased. What are they but the golden remains of antiquity, or the treasures of modem wisdom ? — copious in meaning, yet marked by elegant terseness ; inculcating the precepts of worldiy pradence, yet having a tendency to check vice, strengthen virtue, and lead the mind to a reliance on the Divine Will. We are, perhaps, not duly sensible, how much of whatever good may have marked our career is to be attributed to the influence of some pious, moral, or pmdential maxim with which our youthful minds were imbued. Parents and teachers who appreciate this remark, will hail with satisfaction the opportunity presented by the following pages, of planting the seeds of wisdom in the minds of youth, hereafter to be expanded to a goodly iiarvest ; for Proverbs, however quaintly expressed, contain the essence of some moral truth or practical lesson ; they are drawn from real life, and are generally the fruit of philosophy grafted on the stem of experience. Indeed, although of late years neglected by most writers, they were formerly so greatly held in re- verence, that scarcely a book appeared in which its author did not bear testimony to their value by the free use he made of them. Nay, we are told by Mr. DTsraeli, that “ much later even than the reign of Elizabeth, our ancestors had proverbs always before them, on every tiring which had room for a piece of advice on it. They had them painted on their tapestries, stamped on the most ordinary uten- sils, the blades of their knives, tire borders of their plates, and ‘conned them out of goldsmiths’ rings.’ ” I know it may be objected, that proverbial sayings ft-c- quently contain gross allusions, and inculcate sentiments not always favourable to virtue : That is undeniable i and if I have not shown a due regard to the ex- JEntrniiuctnry OS^rrbnttmt^. elusion of such from this collection, I grant that I must he very ill qualified for the compilation of a ■work that is intended for all classes and all ages. I trust, however, that, though numerous, they are unexceptionable ; and I will conclude my observations on aphoristic precepts in the quaint, but apposite, language of a ■writer of the seventeenth century : “ They walk upon men’s tongues, dance in their fancies, are carried about in their memories, and are reserved for graces of their discourses, when they desire to appear in their festival habits and holiday behaviour.”* I have now only to, say a few words respecting the different descriptions of Mottoes, and to suggest a method or two relative to the manner in which they may be advantageously used in schools. Instead of the Aphorisms and Proverbs which elsewhere throughout the volume environ the subject matter, the “ English Grammar,” “Verbal Distinctions,” and “Phrases,” are surrounded by short sentences, intended as Exercises on Syntax and Style ; each of which is repented in a corrected form, and placed opposite, as a “ Key” to the Exercise. The mar- ginal spaces of the “ English Dictionary ” are occupied by Moral Maxims, alpha- betically arranged throughout ; from which vast stock, an almost inexhaustible supply of new Lines for Writing Copies are furnished, and some of the trite and ofl-repeated sentences now in use may be discontinued. But it is not in this way only that they may be found useful : the judicious Teacher may form them into Lessons to be comniitted to memory ; select from among them many wliich ■will serve ns Themes; or use them in a variety of other ways, which his own expe- rience will point out Selections from the Proverbs of all Nations decorate the pages of the “ Gazetteer.” They are in colloquial phraseology, and, of course, less formal and didactic, but not less apposite (if we regard their application to the every-day occurrences of life) than the moral sentences which garnish the pages of the “English Dictionary.” — \"With the “Classical Dictionary” is com- menced a series of Latin Mottoes, ■with free translations ; and these, which I hope- ■will not be less acceptable than the others, are continued till the “ Dictionary of Law Terms ” is begun ; when a collection of Latin Sentences, recognised as fim- damental maxims of British Law, are given, ■with English translations, and car- ried on to the end of the Volume. Thus it will be seen, that I have attended to something like method in the arrangement of this rather heterogeneous and for- midable phalanx ; but how they will be received, of what use they may be found, and whether the novelty will be regarded like many other novelties as more adapted for ornament than use — I leave to the Public, at wliose tribunal they will be judged, and to whose decision I shall bow with deference ; hoping, ere long, again to appear before them with another volume of “The Treasury of Knowledge,” &c., forming a New TjKivEnsAi, BioonAPuy. SAMUEL MAUNDER. * \"I hare «em It remarked,” «ars Lord Eldon, in hts Anecdote Book, \" that something which in rarlj youth captirates attention, inllucnces future life in all stages.

TO THE SIXTH EDITION THE FOLLOWING WAS PREFIXED. So well received was the first Edition of tliis Work, that on the appearanee of the second the Proprietor had the gratifieation of being able to preface it with the following congratulatory sentence : — “ With scarcely one solitary advertisement to assist the sale, the whole of a large impression of Thb Tabasurt op Xnowi.ex>ob has been purchased by the Public in the space of three months i and at this moment several hundred copies are required of this Edition, to execute orders given for the first.\" He at the same time justly attributed “ the eager demand manifested for it ” to “ the highly favourable reception given to it by every Reviewer under whose notice it had come.” And he further remarked, that, “ independently of the pub- licly-expressed opinions of the critical bench, he hod been honoured by many private testimonies, every way fiattering to his undertaking — some accompanied by ingenious observations and recommendatory hints, and others replete with un- qualified praise j ” while lie assured “ hisliberaljudgeshnd patrons (among whom were several conductors of eminent Schools, whose good opinion was rendered the more valuable by its being the result of arduous professional experienee), that he was resolved to pay the most sedulous attention to its improvement, in order to have that claim on their support in future, which is ever awarded to tliose who diligently strive to maintain it.” Since that period the Author has endeavoured to redeem his pledge, by devoting considerable time and attention to the revision of every portion of this volume ; and he now, rvith increased confidence, presumes to hope that his labour has not been thrown away After eonsulting numerous philological and scientific pub- lications, and diligently collating them with the works which had previously been examined, he has been enabled to add upwards of Ten Thousand “ useful, significant, and well-authorized words ” (with definitions as perspicuous as their indispensable conciseness would admit of) to the \" E.viahobd ENOtisn Dic- tionary ” in Part I. ; thereby rendering it the most copious Vocabulary of the English language extant — not merely in comparison with others of a corre- sponding size, but with any Dictionary of six times its bulk and price. Mow he has performed his task, others must determine j — for him to say more on the subject might be deemed offensive egotism j — to say less would, he thinks, be a mere aff&ctatkm of modesty. He trusts, however, he shall not be charged with either ; yet he must confess, (if he may be allowed to apply to the writers of prefaees a trite, though classical, simile), that while endeavouring to steer clear of the whirlpool of Charybdis, none are in more imminent danger of being wrecked on the roek of Scylla, If, by a happy method of condensation, the Author has been enabled to send forth “ a book remarkable for the mass of useful information it contains,” and, while doing so, has shown a laudable desire to engraft virtuous principles on human acquirements, his cliief aim has been answered. The pressing calls of business or of duty deprive many of the means of pursuing literature or science, in any better way than by desultory rending, aided by books of referenee ; and he who claims the parentage of this volume is not one who disdains tire iium- bler efforts of the intellect, or despises the rudest stepping-stones to learning ; being convinced that every advance, however trifling, which the mind mokes towards attaining perfection, increases tlie rational enjoyments of life. Nor is he singular in his opinion. “ Ignorance.” says the author of Jiasselas, “ is mere privation, by which nothing con be produced : it is a vanity in wlxich the soul sits motionless and torpid for want of attraction : and, without knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget.” — And an eminent poet, wliose knowledge of general literature is on a par with liis manly and har- monious verse, has made the following judicious remarks ; » — • Vide the Inaugural Speech of the late Mr. Thomas Campbell (April IS, 1827), on his having been chosen lord rector of the University of Glasgow. Siitrolructai'i) (iBfi^rrbatt'onS. “ In comparing small learned acquisitions with none nt all, it appears to me to be equally absurd to consider a little learning valueless, or even dan- gerous, as some will have it, as to talk of a little virtue, a little wealth, or health, or cheerfulness, or a little of any otlTer blessing tmder heaven, being worthless or dangerous. “ To abjure any degree of information, because we cannot grasp the whole circle of the sciences, or sound the depths of erudition, appears to be just about as sensible as if we were to shut up our windows because they are too narrow, or because the glass has not the magnifying power of a telescope. “ For the smallest quantity of knowledge that a man can acquire, he is bound to be contentedly thankful, provided his fate shuts him out from the power of acquiring a larger portion — but whilst the possibility of farther advancement remains, be as proudly discontented as ye will with a little learning. F or the value of knowledge is like that of a diamond, it increases according to its magnitude, even much more than in a geometrical ratio One science and literary pursuit throws light upon another, and there is a connection, as Cicero remarks, among them alt — “ ‘ Omnes artes, quae ad humanitatem pertinent, habent quoddam commune vinculum ; et quasi cognatione quadam inter se continentur.’ ” The force of the foregoing extract would be weakened by any additional re- marks ; but the following lines may, perhaps, be allowed to stand in lieu of a more appropriate conclusion : — Where’er the rays of Science cheer mankind. Or I/Caming’s hallowed light illumes the mind. There Knowledge pours her countless treasures forth. And points to Wisdom, Honour, Fame, and Worth ; Tliere splendid talents proud distinction claim. There Genius earns a never-dying name. Virtue asserts her power, and Merit tries No more in vain to bear away the prize ; For Truth and Justice there with Freedom reign. And modest Merit follows in their train. Uarch, 1S3I. ADVEIITISEMENT TO THE SIXTEENTH EDITION. SiNCB the above was written, nitie large Editions of “ The Treasury of Know- ledge” luive been issued — which, while it affords the best proof tliat the kind greeting given to the Work on its first appearance was not undeserved, has encouraged the Author to endeavour to render it still more worthy of tlic public favour.* Until lately, his time has been fully occupied in producing (as parts of one uniform scries, yet quite independent of each other), “ Tlie Biographical Treasmy,\" “ The Literary and Scientific Treasury,” and tlie “ Treasury of History;” which, os they severally appeared, were honoured with flattering notices from various membert of the critical corps ; many of whom generously seized the opportunity to reiterate their former commendations of this fiighly- favourtd volume. To them, therefore, for the uniformly handsome manner in which they have oimmcnted on his labours — and to a liberal Public, for the patronage tlicy have as uniformly bestowed on tlicm — he once more returns his most grateful acknowledgments.

Is almost an intellectual necessity.” [necessary]. — Ru/irer. ENGLISH Grammar is the art of speak- ing and writing the English language with propriety. It consists of four parts j Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody. Orthography teaches the nattu-e and power of letters, and the correct spelling of words. Etymology treats of the several kinds of words. Syntax treats of the construction of sen- tences. Prosody, of pronunciation and poetry. But the most useful parts are Etymology and Syntax ; and to these this short trea- tise is confined. ETYMOLOGY. The words, or parts of speech, that con- stitute the English language, are the Ar- ticle, Noun, Adjective, Pronoun, Relative, Verb, Participle, Auxiliary, Adverb, Pre- position, Conjunction, and Interjection. OF THE ARTICLE. The article is prefixed to nouns, to limit or determine their meaning j as, “ a strait, an isthmus, the ocean.” There are tliree articles ; a, an, and the. A and an are named indefinite, because they denote some one tiling of a kind ; os “ a wren, an eagle.” The is named definite, because it points out some pivrticular thing! us, \"Vie book, the world.” OF THE NOUN. A noun is the name of any tiling in ex- istence, or of which we con form on idea ; as, “ health, happiness, globe, telescope.\" Nouns are of two kinds,propcr and com- mon. Proper nouns arc the names of persons, places, &C.1 ns\" Adam,Edcn, Nile, Egypt. Common nouns are all otlier names ; and may be subdivided into substantive and abstract ; substantive, or names of things substantial, ns “ camels, cedar, amethyst ; ” abstract, or names charac- terized by some quality, ns “ lightness, ve- locity, content.\" A noun is known by its either admitting an article before it, os “ a star, the sky ; ” or making sense without, as in “ youth, beauty.\" Nouns have the properties of gender, number, and case.\" They have four genders ; masculine, fe- minine, common, and neuter. The masculine gender denotes animals of the male kind, as \"boy, tiger.\" The feminine denotes animals of ihe fe- male kind, as \"girl, tigress.\" The common denotes those to which either masculine or feminine is applicable; ' os “ guardian, ward, cousin, lamb, cle- j phant.\" I The neuter denotes lifeless objects ; as “ wisdom, wealth.” Gender is distinguished in three ways:— : 1 . By different words ; as, “ boy, girl ; husband , wife ; father, mother ; son , daugh- . ter; uncle, aunt ; nephew, niece.\" I 2. By a different termination ; as “ heir, ' heiress ; benefactor , benefactress ; hero, heroine ; testator, testatrix.\" j 3. By a noun, a pronoun, or an ailjcc- tivc, prefixed to the noun ; as, “ a man- servant, a maid-servant ; a Ac-ass, a shc- ass; a nude child, aj'emale child.” 1. “ Sometimes, however, by a figure in rhetoric, called personification, we assign sex to things inanimate. Thus, instead of ‘ i< (the moon) rises,’ we say, ‘sAc rises;’ instead of ‘ it (death) advances with hasty steps,’ we say, ‘ Ac advances.’ ; “ This mode of expression, by which we give life and sex to tiling inanimate, forms a striking beauty in our language, rendering it in this respect superior to the languages of Greece and Rome, neither of ■ whudi admitted this animated phraseolo- ; Sy.\"—Crornbie. ! 2. “ The masailine term has a general meaning, expressing both male and fe- male ! and is always employed when the office, occupation, profession, Jtc., and not the sex, of the individual is chiefly to be expressed ; and the feminine term is used in those coses only, in which discrimina- tion of sex is indisjicnsablc. Thus If I say , ‘ The poets of tliis age arc dist inguishe;d more by correctness of taste, than subli- mity of conception,’ I clearly include in the term poets, both male and female wri- ters of iioetry. If I soy, ’ She is the licst poetess In this countiy,’ I assign her the key MY FATHER SENT HIM AND ME TO SCHOOL. KEY. — TO ATTEMPT TO LEARN GRAMMAR IS OF NO U8K.

If I say, ‘ She is the best poet iu this country,’ I pronounce her superior to all other writers of peltry, both male and fe- male. When distinction of sex is neces- sary for the sake of perspicuity, or rvliere the sex is the primary object, the feminine noun must be employed to express the fe- ; male: tlms, ‘ I hear that some authoresses ' arc engaired in tliat work.’ Here the fe- i minine term is indispensable.”— C;-o;«6ie. I Nouns have rivo numbers ; the singular and the plural. I The singular expresses only one object ; as, \" a sctiolar, a preceptor.\" Tliep/uraicxpresses two objects or more; as, \" scholars, preceptors.\" Some nouns have only a singular num- ber; as,\" gold, silver, utility, worth.\" Some singular nouns are made plural, to express varieties of the same things; as, cloth, oil, sugar, tea, wine, &c. Some nouns have only a plural number; as, alms, ashes, dregs, cates, folk, lungs, optics, pincers, pulse (esculent seeds), re- galia, riches. Some nouns are alike in both numbers ; as, apparatus, census, corps, deer, sheep. And some, when used in a plural sense, do not take a plural form ; as, audience, commonalty, divan, laity, populace, re- tinue. 3. Proper names, when used either figu- ratively to express eminence or distinction, or to denote two or more persons of the same name, admit the plural numirer; as, “Every nation has its Hectors, Ccesars, and Alexanders; Solomons, Ciceros, and Lucretias.\" The plural number is usually formed by ad(bng s to the singular ; as vista, vistas ; shrub, shrubs ; alley, alleys. But when the noun ends in ch soft,s,s/i, .«s, or X, the plural is formed by adding cs ; ns. peach, peachej; bolus, boluses; fish, fishes ; glass, glasses ; box, boxes. If the noun ends in ch hard, the addition of s only forms the plural; as, loch, lochs; mnnarch, monarcris. Nouns ending in o preceded by a vowel, have only s added to form the plural ; us, cameo, nuncio, ratio. If preceded by a consonant, they sometimes have es added, us ill buffalo, cargo, volcano; and some- times oiily s, us in portico, solo, rotundo. The nouns beef, calf, corf, elf, half, leaf, bsKfj self sheaf shelf thief wolf, life, kmje, and wife, change the f and fe into Vis; ns, beef beeves; elf, elves; knife, • knives. Sic. : staff makes staves; all other nrmns ending in ffc, ot ff, have only , aslrlcd. ' Nouns ending In y preceded by a cim- so/iont, change the y for ies; as, ally, allies: I — those ending in // preceded by a vowel, I fid low the general rule ; ns, valley, vul- 1 leus. The plurnlsofsomc nouns arc Irregular : ! — T/om makes men; virnnon, women; child, i children; die (a small cnlic), dice; foot, feet : U'sise, geese ; touse, live ; mouse, mice ; I lex, ijxin; Je nny, pence ; twth, teeth. 4. “ Two or more nouns in concordance, ' and forming one complex name, or a name and a title, have the pliual termination annexed to the last only,” as, “ the two ' Miss Thomsons.\" — “Analogy,” Dr. Priest- ley observes, “would plead in favour of another construction, and lead us to say, ‘ the two Misses Thomson;’ for, if the ellipsis were supplied, we should say the two young ladies of the name of Thomson. The latter form of expression, it is true, occasionally ocems ; but general usage, and, I think, analogy likewise, decides in favour of the former ; for, with a few ex- ceptions, and these not parallel to the ex- amples now given, we almost uniformly, in complex names, confine the inflection to the last noun.” — Crombie. Thus, “In the holes and comers where nature keeps her cmioslties, there may be Wrens and Inigo Joneses.\" “The Transatlantic J ohn Sinclairs are yet m ovo.\" By analogy, we ought to say man-traps, mouse-traps, queen-consorts, lord-chancellors, Sic. 5. In speaking of a family Individually, adding the plural termination to the name is inadmissible ; and instead of Mr., Airs., ami the two Miss Lawsons, we ought to say, either, Mr., Mrs., and the two Misses Lawson, or Mr. and Mrs. Lawson and the two Miss Lawsons ; thus making the name strictly applicable to each individual. 6. Names of titles formed of a noun and an adjective require the inflection on the first word : as attomcys-general, knights- errant, coio'ts-martial.” 7. The proper plurals of the words spoonful, mout/ful, and such like, are spoomuls, mouthfuls, and not spoonsfull, mouthsfull ; between which and the pre- ceding there is an essential .difference : thus, “ Two large spoonfuls of this mix- ture to lie taken,” implies, that twice the quantity a spoon will hold is to betaken ; but\" Two large spoonsfull of this mixture to be taken,” may intimate, that the spoons also are to be taken. 8. The words means, news, and pains, are used both as singular and plural nouns. “Asa general mlc for the use of means as either singular or plural, it might render the construction less vague, and the ex- pression therefore less ambiguous, were we to employ it as singular, when the medi- ation or instrumentality of one thing is implied ; and as plural, when two or more mediating causes arc referred to. ‘ He was careful to -observe what means were em- ployed by his adversaries to counternct liis schemes.’ Here means is properly joined with n ))lurnl verb ; several methods of counteraction licing signified. ‘There is not a more effectual means to awaken in us an ambition raised above low pursuits, than to value ourselves as heirs of eter- nity.’ Here the instrumentality of only one thing is implied, and the noun Is therefore used ns singular. “ Is fur more generally used as a singular noun ; but the rule just now re- commended might, perhaiis, lie useful hero also.

Case is that circumstance in which a . noun or a pronoun is placed with relation ; to some verb, preposition, pronoun, or other noun, in the same sentence. I The nominative case simply expresses the name of a thing, and is the subject of ' the verb ; as, “ The e//e infinitely surpasses all the works of human industry.” I The possessive expresses the relation of I property or possession ; and, in nouns in the singular number, is formed by adding to them the letter s preceded by an apos- trophe ; as, “ The days of winter are those of nature's rest ; ” or, if they end in s, nee, or *s, by adding only the apostrophe ; as, “ High on Parnassus' top ; Ulysses' queen : for goodness’ sake ; experience' self shall aid thy lame belief.” In nouns in the plural ending in s, the possessive is formed b^ adding an apos- ■ trophe only ; as “ Studious of peace, their neighbours' and their own.” The o^/ectiiie case generally follows tran- ' sitive verbs and participles, and preposi- ' tions ; as, “ Set your affections on things : above ; ” “ Redeeming the time.\" I Nouns are thus declined : — ' Sing. Man Man’s Man A'aminative case, , Possessive, Objective, ' yominative case. Possessive, Objective, A Parent A Parent’s A Parent Flu. Men. Men’s. Men. Parents. Parents’. Parents. OF THE AD.TECTIVE. The adjective is a word added to noims, ^ to point out their properties, kinds, or : qualities ; as, “ A good name is preferable to frreat nches ; ” \"No pursuit is more de- , lightful, or more diversified, than the at- tentive contemplation of nature.” The only change it undergoes (besides that of number, which applies chiefly to demonstrative adjectives) is on account of comparison, of which the grees lative. there arc three de- positive, comparative, and super- ■rhe positive is the simple form of \"the adjective, and expresses the quality of an object ; as, pure, bright. I. The termination ish, by its lessening yie signification of the positive, may be <tem«l a degree of comparison ; as, damp, dampish, or rather /lamp. Ish and rather, having the same import, ought not to occur in the same sentence. The comparative expresses an Increase or a decrease of the qiiality ; as, purer, brighter, less pure, less bright. J. “ It has liecn questioned, whether prior, superior, and several others, wliich iwve the form of tlie Eatin comparative, should be deemed comparatives. I think they ought not, for these reasons ; first, they have not tlic form of the English comparative ; secondly, they arc never lollowed by than, winch uniformly occom- J»nies the English comparative ; thirdly. It IS not to be conceived, that every ad- jective which implies comparison is there- j fore a comparative, otherwise preferable, \\ (better than), previous (prior to), might be deemed comparatives ; and fourthly, many of these have truly a positive meaning. The interior means simply the inside, as opposed to the exterior or outside; the anterior, the one before, opposed to pos- terior, the one behind.” — Crombie. 3. When two comparative adjectives come together, one compared by moi-e or most, and the other by er or est, the adjective compared by er or est should be placed first. “ Mr. Halleck, one of the most po- pular and sweetest bards of America, is about to rive the world a new poem.” Properly, \"sweetest and most popular ; ” or “ the most popular and the sweetest bard.” 4. When only two persons or things are spoken of comparatively, to use the super- lative is improper. “ And which is best* ” replied Mentor, “a superb city, with a sterile and neglected country ; or a country in high culture, and fruitful as a garden, with a city where decency has taken place of pomp. It ought to have been, “and which is better?\" _ The superlative expresses the greatest mcrease or decrease of the quahtv; as, purest, brightest, least pure, least bright. 5. “ Adjectives whose signification does not admit intension or remission, cannot be compared. Among these are to be reckoned all words expressive of figure, as, circular, square, tnangular, straight, perpendicular; for it is obvious, that if a body ora figure be triangular, or square, or circular, it cannot be more or less so. It is either circular or not circular, triangular or not triangular.” — Crombie. C. Some adjectives have an innate su- perlative meaning, and ought not to have the superlative form superadded ; they will not admit any kind or degree of com- parison 1 and they exclude all intensive words : such are chief, complete, endless, entire, extreme, impossible, infallible, infi- nite, paramount, perfect, right, supreme, toted, universal. The following sentences are consequently incorrect : “ The chiefest among ten thousand ; The completest piece of mechanism ever exliibited ; How end- less IS thy love I Very entire; Far as the earth s extremest bounds ; How impossible it IS to meet the wishes of all minds 1 Hoiv infinite are the works of God 1 How perfect in design I So totally inconsistent with justice^ Fire is a very universal agent in perfecting the arts, and contributing to the comforts of life.” Adjectives of only one syllable are usually comimred by adding r or er, and St or est; os pure, purer, purest ; bright, brighter, brightest. Adjectives of more syllables than one, are for the most jiart compared jiy more and most or very; or less and least; ns, careful, more careful, most or very care- ful; less careful, least careful. Dissylla- bles ending in ;/, as lovely; in le. after a consonant, ns ample; or accented on the latter syllable, ns mlite; easily admit er and cst; as, lovelier, loveliest; ampler, amplest; politer, jwlitest.

In some words the superlative is formed by adding the adverb most to the end of them ; as, foremost, hindmost, uttermost. Some adjectives are compared irregu- larly ; as, good, better, best; bad, worse, worst; little, less, least; much or many, more, most; near, nearer, nearest or next; late, later, latest or last; old, older or elder, oldest or eldest. Demonstrative or definitive adjectives point out precisely the things to wliich they relate : this and that, with their plurals these and those, fonner and latter, and sometimes the indefinite adjectives one and other, are of this denomination. “ Body and soul must part : This wings its way to heaven ; That drops into the grave.” “ Warnings point out our danger ; gno- mons, time : As dtese are useless when the sun is set, So those, but when more glorious reason sliines.” “ Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better artist : in the one we admire the man ; in the other, the work. Theformer hurries us with a commanding impe- tuosity ; the latter leads us with an at- tractive majesty.” Indefinite adjectives express their sub- jects in a general or indeterminate manner. Of this kind are some, other, any, one, all, such. Of these, only one and ofAer admit being varied j one takes the possessive case, as one, one's; and other is declined thus : — Horn, case. Sing. Other, Flu. Others. Possessive, Other's, Others’. Objective, Other, Others. The plural others represents the adjec- tive end the noun ; thus, ” Charity con- ceals the faults and infirmities of others\" — other persons. Distributive adjectives denote several persons or things individually : they are each, every, either, and neither. Each and every refer singly to all the persons or things^ of any number; as, “ Each heart despoil’d of every joy, would still on hope rely.” Either implies one or the other of two only ; “ We hold, O king I in one hand the sword, an olive brancli in the other j peace and war ; — choose either.\" Neither means not either. “ The prin- cess asserted her resolve to live and die w'ith one to whom she was bound by ho- nour and duty : and whom neither would permit her to abandon.” Numeral ailjcctives are either cardinal, as two, three; or ordinal, as second, third. Pronominal adjectives relate to posses- sion or property : tlicy arc my, thy, her, our, your, their; from the pronouns I, thou, she, it. OF TUB FRONOUN. Tlie pronoun is used instead of a noun, to prevent a too frequent reiictilion oi it ; ns, ” Take fast hold of instruction : keep her, for she is tliy life.” ” And Joseph knew his brethren, but tJiey knew not him.\" “ We take no note of time, but from its loss.” | 1 . This is the peculiar use of the pro- I noun : but we often see the pronouns he I and him, they and them, without any noun | for them to represent; thus, “ Bless^ is hr. ■■ that consideretli the poor and needy.” “ He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty.” “ Let him that giveth, do ' it with simplicity ; him that ruleth, with diligence ; him that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.” “ Them that honour me, I will honour ; and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.” The singular pronoun has in such cases gained, as it were by prescription, a right of usage wliich it would be inconvenient to disturb. Not so, theplural pronoun ; and the last preceding example would be perfectly cor- rect, only if expressed tlius : “ Those that honour me ; those that despise me;” the word persons being understood after those. 2. Mr. Bindley Murray says, “We fre- quently meet with those instead of they at the banning of a sentence, and where there is no particular reference to an an- tecedent ; as, ‘ Tlwse that sow in tears, sometimes reap in joy.’ ” Now demon- ^ stratlve adjective pronouns (os Mr. Mur- ray incorrectly calls theml do not always refer to an antecedent ; they refer often to something subsequent, as in this very example. ■ In his eighth rule of SjTitax, Mr. Mur- ray says, “ Every adjective, and eveiy ad- jective pronoun, belongs to a substantive expressed or understood : as, ‘ Few are happy,’ that is, ‘ persons.’ According to Mr. Murray, “ those ” is an adjective pro- , noun; therefore \"those\" ^belongs to substantive expressed or understood,- and , in the example, “ those that sow in tears ” ; belongs indubitably to the sulistantive | persons understood. “ It Ls not, however, i always easy,” adds Mr. Murray, “to say whether a personal pronoun or a demon- strative isjirefcrable in certain construc- tions. ‘ We are not unacquainted with the calumny of them [or tAo.se] who openly ' make use ol the wannest professions.’ 1 1 sliould say, without hesitation, “ the ca- lumny of those ” is preferable. “ They,\" says Mr. Lcnnie lEng. Gram. p. 45.1, “stands for a noun already intro- : duced, and should never be used till the noun be mentioned. Those, on the con- trary, points out n noun not preWously introduced, but generally understood. It is improper, therefore, to say, ‘ They that are truly good must be happy.’ Weshould say, those that are trul)- good : because wc are pointing out a particular class of per- sons, and not referring to nouns prcnously introduced. A noun, when not cxprcs.-ied after this, that, these, and those, is always understood.” Tlic pronouns arc, I, thou, he, she, it ; ire, ye or you, and they. The properties of pronouns are, number, person, gender, and case, I’ronouns hai-e two numlicrs, the siii- giilar and tlie plural ; ond tlircc persons in each. key.

The persons of the plural number are, ire, the first ; we or you, the second ; and tAey, the tliiid. The first person is the person that speaks ; the second, the person spoken to; and the third, the person or thing spoken of. Their genders are distinguished thus: — He is masculine; she is feminine; it is neuter; I, thou, we, and ye or you, are common; and they is masculine, feminine, common, and neuter. They have three cases, and are thus de- clined : — Pers. Case. Singular. Plural. 1st. Horn. I. We. Poss. Mine. Ours. ' ObJ. Me. Us. 2d. Horn. Thou or you. Ye or you. I Poss. Thine or yours.

The possessive cases mine, thine, hers, ours, yours, and theirs, represent the pro- nominal adjective and the noun ; as, “ ’Tis Providence alone secures, in every change, both mine and yours; ” — my life, &c. A reciprocal pronoun is formed by pre- fixing a pronominal adjective, or a pro- noun in the objective case, to the noun self or selves; as, myself, thyself, himself, itsef, ourselves, themselves. Ourself is pe- culiar to the regal style. “ Witness Our- self at Westminster.\" I OF THE RELATIVE. 1 The relative is a conjunctive pronoun, and refers to some preceding noun or pro- noun, called its antecedent: os, “ He preaches well who lives well.” “ V ain, v^ vain , my weary search to find j That bliss which centres only in the I mind.” i The relatives are, who, which, that, what, and whether; thougli the last is almost obsolete, which being generally used in- stead. Who is applied exclusively to persons ; , which, mostly to brutes and things inani- mate j and loAetAer to them all ; ns, “How benevolent Is Oml, who never forsakes the creatures which his hands have made.” as a relative, is used to prevent the too frepuent repetition of who and which; ns. He who has good health is young ; and he is rich that owes nothing.\" “ Air, Yj'ich ail living creatures respire. Is a sub- tile fluid that surrounds our globe.” What is a compound relative, including the antecedent as well ns the relative ; and tneann that which or those which; ns, “So slow the growth of what is excellent! \" *^Ao, which, and what agree with nouns In both numbers i and when used in ask- ing nupstlons, arc calleil interroyatives ; as, • lint who can paint the lover as he stood?” “ Which is the great command- ment in the law?” “Take no thought, saying. What shall we eat ? or what shidl we drink?” Who and tohich admit of inflection ; that is, change of form or of termination, and ore thus declined Singular and Plural. Nominative, Who, Which. Possessive, Whose, Whose. Objective, Whom, Which. OF THE VERB. The verb is the principal word in a sen- tence i it expresses our thoughts and ac- tions, and how we “ live, move, and have our being:” as, “He who promises and delays, loses his thanks.” ‘‘Time, with all its celerity, moves slowly on to him, whose whole employment is to watch its flight.” Verbs are of two kinds, transitive or ac- tive, and intransitive or neuter ; and these are divided into regular, irregular, and defective. 1 . What Mr. L. Murray and many others call passive verbs, we consider as verbs transitive in the passive voice. If a verb will admit the objective cose of a pronoun after it, as in “Educate him well it is transitive. Intransitive verbs, generally, do not admit an objective case after them. “ And the men rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Jo- seph.” Here rose, went, and stood are in- transitive. The properties of the verb transitive are, voice, mode, tense, number, and person. The properties of the verb intransitive are the same, with the exception of voice, which belongs to verbs transitive only. Verbs have two numbers, the singular and the plural ; and three persons in each. Fbice is the active or passive expression of a verb transitive: — the active voice ex- presses action or agency; thus, “ Hope is one of the choicest gifts which Heaven bcstoivs on man.” The passive voice de- notes a being acted upon, and is formed by the past participle of a transitive verb, and an inflection of the auxiliary be; thus, “ He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread.” Mode is a particular form of the verb, showing the manner in which any tiling we think, say, or do, is represented. There are five modes: the indicative, the imperative, the potential, the subjunctive, and the infinitive. The indicative simply asserts i as, “ The moon revolves round the earth, and ac- companies it in its revolution round the sun:”— or it asks a question; ns, “Who guides the migratory swallows flight ?” The imperative commands, exhorts, &c. ; as, \"Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.” “ Know thyself.” “His blood be on us, and ou our chil- dren I ” The potential implies possibility, proba- bility, permission, will, and obligation ; KEY. — MOHR TIIOOI'S ARR AT THIS TIME IlKINO OROANI7.ED.

The criteria of this grammatical stumbling-block are, its re- quiring the presence of another verb to form complete sense, its being preceded by a conjuuetion, its requiring the second and tliird persons singular to be the same as the first, and its expressing ftiture time without the aid of an auxiliary : thus, “ Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house, lest thou weary him, and he hate thee.’’ The infinitive is preeeded by the particle to, expressed or imderstood, and denotes things in a general way, without distinc- tion of number or person ; as, “ It is of importance to the sum of human felicity, not to neglect minute attentions to make the most of life as it passes.” Tense is the distinction of time. “In English, we can express but two tenses by one word ; namely, the present, as advise: and the past, as advised: yet as we often have occasion to divide time into more than two parts, we are obliged to have recourse to auxiliaries, or hclppig words. These enable us to divide the past time into tliree degrees, and to bring in a future, wliich we can divide into two de- grees, making in the whole six divisions of time ; and the particle preter (signifying past), prefixed to the names of some of the tenses, is of singular service in pointing out the tenses reckoned as past.\"— Lindley Murray Examined. Tliere are six tenses j namely, the pre- sent, the prcterimperfect, the pretcrperfect, ■ tlie preterpluperfect, the imperfect future, and the p>erfectfuture\\ The present and prcterimperfect are formed Dy the verb alone, and arc called simple tenses; the rest are formed witli the aid of auxiliaries, and are called compound tenses. Tiie present tense denotes an action or an event now passing, or some circum- stance or property now existing ; as,— “ T/iiiifc wc, or think we not, time hun-ics With a resistless unremitting stream.” “ By ceaseless action, all that is, subsists.\" Tlie preterimpcrfect denotes a finished action or event; ns, “ And Esau rnii and met him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed liim ; and tlicy wept. It denotes also an action or nn event re- Tna.iniii'^ iiicoinplctc tit a certain tinic past; thus, ” Two of them went that day to Em- maus; and wliile they communed and rca- soned iwerc commuydng and reasmiingj, .lesus liimself drew near, and went with them.” Tlie preterjie.rfcct refers to what is past, and also alludes to flme present ; as, — “Ericndshipl how much thou hast de- served froni ihe ! „ Oft hm>e I proved the 1 abours of thy love. The prcterpUri>erfcct ^ represents a cir- cumstance as past, prior to some other circumstance, or some particular time ; as,— “ Scarce had the happy tenant proved the sweets Of the fair spot, when straight he must be gone.” The imperfect future denotes an intend- ed action, or a circumstance that has yet to take place ; as,— “ The storms of wintry time will quickly pass. And one unbounded spring cneircZeall.” The perfect future intimates that some action will or will not be finished, or some event will or will not have taken place, by, at, or before a certain time ; or before some other action or event: as, “Verily, I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel before the Son of Man come.” The tenses also r^resent an action as incomplete or imperfrot; us in the phrase, I am writing: or complete and perfect ; as in the phrase, I have written. OF TIIE AUXILIARY. The auxiliary is used in forming such tenses ns the verb cannot form of itself ; as. “ So hat:e I striven to preach the gos- l>cl. where Clirist was not named, lest I should build on another man’s founda- tion.” The nuxilinrics arc, be, do, have, shall and will, can, may, and must, with their inflections. They arc conjugated as follows BE. The conjujmtion of the nnxilinrv- and the intransitive verb , ai>i>enrs ill Italic OF THE PARTICIPLE. The participle is an inflection of the verb, hav'ing the properties of the verb, the adjective, and the noun. As a verb, it is either transitive dr in- transitive, ns the verb from which it is formed ; thus, “ Havingiood and raiment, let us be therewith content.” “ And so much the more, as we see the day ap- proaching.\" It has five tenses ; two simple and three compound. The simple tenses are, the present, ending in ing, as pleasing : and the past, ending (if the verb is regular) in ed, as pleased:— the compound tenses arc, in the active voice, the post; as, having pleased: and in the passive voice, the pre- sent, as being pleased, and the past, as having been pleased. As an adjective, it describes nouns ; as, “ The pa>-chcd earth welcomes the re- freshing rain ; a feeling heart ; departed worth.\" As a noun, it is always in the present simple tense ; ns, “ What stubbing, digging, ploughing, and harrowing are to land; thinking, reflecting, and examining arc to the mind.” B.l t-i z I key.

A defective verb is one that is used in some only of the mode.s, tenses, and per- sons, and is also irregular. An impersonal verb is one that is con- strued rnth the neuter pronoun il, and is uscil only in the third person singular; as, “ It lightens, it tMinders: ” “ Here the lank miser, cased of a tax it vked the wrctcli to pay, lies cheaply lodged.” A finite verb is a verb in any mode but the infinitive.

S Comijaitriau^ (grammar. 23 tcalkelh securely.\" “ The hair contri- butes very greatly to the beauty of the countenance.” Some adverbs are compared as adjec- tives, either by adding r or er and est; os, late, later, latest; soon,sooner, soonest: or by the aid of more and most, less and least ; as, more happily; most willingly ; less rea- dily, least perceptibly. OF THE PREPOSITION. The preposition is used to connect words ; and is placed chiefly before nouns and pro- nouns, to show the relation they have to some other words : thus, “ The worth of a thing is best known by the want of it.” “ For the purpose o/being scattered by the wind, some seeds ore furnished toith a sort of wings.” OF THE CONJUNCTION. The conjimction is used to connect words and sentences : as, “ Life and death are in the power of the tongue.” “ Good words cost nothing, but are worth much.” Conjimctions are of two sorts, copulative and cU^unctive. The copulative conjunction joins words and sentences, and connects their mean- ings also j thus, “ The sun diffuses light ami life throughout the creation ; and without him, all nature would languish and die.\" The diyunctive conjunction unites words and sentences, but disjoins their meanings j thus, “ Give me neither poverty nor riches ; lest I be full, and deny thee ; or poor, and steal, and take thy name in vain.\" Or and nor are sometimes elegantly put for either and neither, at the beginning of a sentence : — “ Safe in the hand of one disposing Power, Or in the natal or the mortal hour.” “ Nor infancy, in warm caress. Its mother's hope and happiness ; Nor ruddy youth , nor manhood’s prime. Can boast beyond the present time.” OF THE INTERJECTION. The interjection is a word, or words, used to esmress some sudden passion or emotion of the mind ; as, “ The golden hours are i)ast, and I knew not their value : they fled in haste, and,, alas.' they will never return.” “ Throw empires away, and be blameless ; but, oh I husband thy precious hours.” OF SYNTAX. SYNTAX treats of the connection and j proper arrangement of words, in the form- ation of sentences; and isjubject to certain ' rules. A sentence is an assemblage of words making complete sense. * Sentences are ofi two kinds ; simple and compound. ! A simple sentence contains only one subject and one flnitc verb : and makes complete sense without the aid of relative or conjunction : thus, “ Man wants but little here below.” I A compound sentence contains two or more simple sentences, connected by re- latives or conjunctions : thus, “ The sun's vivifying rays may be considered ns an emblem of the happy influence of a truly goofl man, who scatters joy and blessings on all around.” “ Man wants but little here below, run wants that little long.” A phrase is two or more words rightly put together; and forming sometimes port of a sentence, and sometimes a whole one: ss, \" In human hearts,” “ what bolder thought can rise,” “ than man's presump- tion on to-morrow's dawn?” Syntax consists of two parts ; concord and government. Concord is the agreement of one word with another, in gender, numtxjr, case, or person. Government is one word's requiring another to be in a particular case, mo<lc, or tense. RULE I. _ The article o is used before nouns in the singular number, and achectives, begin- ning with any consonant but silent It ; as, “ o bee, a hive, a honeyed tongue.” The article an is used before nouns in the singular number, and adjectives, be- ginning with a vowel or silent h ; ns, “ an autograph, an heiress, an absolute fact,” It is used before h aspirated, also, in words accented on the second or the fourth syl- lable ; as, “ an hyena, an historiogra- pher.” The article the is used before nouns in either number ; os, “ On the sabbath, the slaves and cattle of the Jews had rest. But there are many nouns which do not require an article before them; as, “ 'When avarice enslaves the mind. And selfish views alone bear sway, Man turns a savage to his kind, _ And blood and rapine mark his way.” 1 . When a word beginning with a vowel is coupled with one beginning with a con- sonant, the imjrjinite article should be re- peated ; tlius, “ It is necessary to an easy and o liappy life, to possess our minds in such a manner, as to be well satislled with our own reflections.” 2. “There Is a particular use of the in- definite article which merits attention. In denoting comparison, when the article is suppressed licforc the second term, tlic latter, though it may lie an appellative, assumes tlie character of an attributive, and liccomcs the predicate of the suhject or first term. Thus, If wc say, ‘He Is a KKV MB WAS TMKN TOO YOONO TO FEBI, MIS LOSS, LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN, AND WAS GLAD TO FIND HE BREATHED SO MUCH MORE EASILY EX. — ALL HIS PLAYS ARE PRINTED IN THE ORDER THEY WERE WRITTEN, EX INDEED, MY FRIEND, YOU ARE MISTAKEN. 24 ^ Cnmpcnift'ou^ (Srammar. better soldier than scholar,’ the article being suppressed before the second term, the expression is equivalent to ‘ he is more warlike than learned.’ If, on the con- trary, the second term be prefaced ivith the article, as in ‘ He would make a better soldier than a scholar,’ this term continues an appellative, and forms the other sub- ject of comparison. The meaning accord- ingly is, ‘ lie would make a better soldier than a scholar would make.’ In the for- mer case, the subject, as possessing different qualities in various degrees, is compared with itself ; in the latter, it is compared with something else. These two phrase- ologies are frequently confounded, which seldom foils to create ambiguity.”— Crowi- bie. 3. “ The definite article is used to <hs- tiiiguish between things which are indivi- dually different^ but have no generic name, and things which are, in truth, one and the same, but are characterized by different qualities. For example, if I should say, ‘The red and blue vestments were most admired,’ it might be doubted whether I meant that the union of red and blue in the same vestment was most admired, or that the red and the blue vestments were both more admired than the rest. In strictness of speech, the former is the only proper meaning of the words, though the latter Sentiment is often thus expressed. If the latter be intended, we should say, ‘ the red vestments and the blue,’ or ‘ the red and the blue vestments,’ where the article is repeated. If I say, ‘ the red and blue vestments,’ it is obvious that only one subject is expressed, namely, ‘vest- ments,’ characterised by the two qualities, ‘ redness ’ and ‘ blueness,’ as combined in the subject. Here the subject is one ; its qualities are plural. If 1 say ‘the red vestments and the blue,’ the subjects are plural, expressed, however, by one generic name, vestments. ‘ The lords spiritual and temporal,’ and ‘ the civil and military au- thorities,' are phraseologies objectionable on the same principle. ‘‘ When two or more adjectives are used as epithets to one and the same thing, and the article is not used, the place of the noun ought to show whether both adjec- tives belong to the same thing, or to tlif- ferent things having the same ■ generic name. ‘ Near and remote beauties,’ ‘ things sacred and secular,’ ‘ ancient and modern authors,’ ‘ new and old books.’ This ar- rangement is faulty ;*both epithets cannot belong to the same subject. It should be ‘ near beauties and remote,’ sacred things and things secular,’ ‘ ancient authors and modern,’ ‘new books and old.’ ” — Crowi- bie. 4. “ The indefinite article, thoufrh pene- raily placed before the adjective, as a good man,’ is put after the adjective sucJi; and where the qualifying words, as, how, 80, and ^00 occur, its place, except in m- verted sentences, is between the adjective and the noun ; thus, ‘Such a pyt is Joo STunU a reward for so orent a service. I he definite article is likcwi.se placed Ijemjc the adjective, as ‘ The great globe itselt. All is the only adjective that precedes tlus article ; os. ‘ Happy the man who sees a God employ'd In aW t/ie good and ill that chequer life 1 ” ’ RUHE II. Every nominative case, except the no- ‘ minative absolute, must have a finite verb or an auxiliary, expressed or understood, agreeing with it ; thus, ‘‘No man is great but in proportion as he restrains and sub- dues his passions.” ‘‘Happy Vieu whose improvement has kept pace with the fleet- ing minutes ; who have seized the impor- tant fugitives, and engaged them in the pursuit of wisdom.” That is, ‘‘ Happy ore they.” The nominative case absolute is when a noun or a pronoun is joined to the pre- sent participle, in an independent sentence ; thus, ‘‘ It is remarkable, that an eldest son of the house of Braganza has never reigned; something having always occurred to pre- vent it.*^ Sometimes the participle is omitted : thus, “ Youth lost in dissipation, we deplore. Through life’s sad remnant, what no sighs restore.” That is, “ youth being lost.” Sometimes both the participle and the pronoim are omitted : thus, “ In life embark'd, we smoothly down the tide Of time descend, but not on time in- tent.” That is, “ we having in life embark’d.” A. The nominative case generally pre- cedes the verb, but sometimes it is put after it, or between the auxiliary and the verb. 1. When a question is asked, a com- mand given, or a wish expressed : thus, “Lovest thou me ? ” “ Come unto me, all ye that labour.” ‘‘ May we grow wiser and better as life wears away 1 2. AVhen a supposition is made without a conjunction ; as, “ Were justice followcxl, then would man be good.’ “ Oh, hcul those lips but language! 3. When an intransitive verb is used ; as, “ Sweet IS the remembrance of a wcll-siKmt life.” “ I touched the string on wliich hung all her sorrows.\" 4. When the verb is preceded by the ad- verbs here, there, where, then, thus, &c. ; as, ‘‘ Here lies in dust the Theban obelisk.\" ‘‘ There sleeps the sage in peace, who bailc oppression cease,” “ l»’'/icrc rest the mighty guardians of mankind.” ‘‘ Thus passes all, by Time controlled, to an irremeable doom.” “ Then come, llcflection, nymph of sober mien, teach me to meditate tlie j solemn scene.” !>. To impart strength and vivacity to the expression ; as, *‘ So fiourish'd, bloom- ■ ing, and unseen by all, thesweet iarimVi.” | B. A plural noun or pronoun, connected i by the preposition of with a singular noun - j in the nominative case, is sometimes mis- ' taken for the nominative case, and the verb erroneously made to agree with it ; as in the following examples : — “ Though ’ niimlicrlcss victims, in all the pride of youth and beauty, have prematurely I J key INDEED, MY FRIEND, YOU MISTAKE, KEY. ^ ALL IILS FLAYS ARE PRINTED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN HE CAME UP, AND DESIHKD THE INFANT TO »B GIVEN TO HIM IMMEDIATELY EX. — HIS CHIEF OCCUPATION AND ENJOYMENT WAS CONTROVERSY. ! ^ (grammar. 25 ' dropped into the crave before their eyes, stiU, from the duchess to the housemaid, the si/mmetnj of their ybr»»s continue to be preferred, to the preservation of modesty, health, and even life itself.” “ Although there were no fewer than five persons in the room at.tlre time, not one of them were conscious of the moment of his disso- lution.” Correct thus : “ the symmetry of their forms continues; not one of them was.\" RITLE ill. Two or more nominatives in the sin- gular number, connected by the copulative conjimction and, expressed or understood, require a plural verb ; thus, fame, honour, beauty, state, train, blood, and birth, A)-e but the fading blossoms of the earth.” “ And now ahide faith, hope, charity, these three ; but the greatest of these is charity.” 1. Notwithstanding the intervention of ami, if, through a disuniting word, the predicate be, in sense, applicable to only one of the nominatives, or to both of them taken separately, the verb must be singular if the noun is singular ; thus, “ Wisdom, [and] not years, is the gray hair to man.\" 2. A verb between two nouns in the sin- gular number, joined by a copulative conjunction, must necessarily be in the singular number, being applicable to them both singly, though expressed only to the former : thus, “ The world passeth away, and the lust thereof.” 3. \" It was customary with the writers of antiquity, when the nouns were nearly synonymous, to employ a verb singular ; M, ‘understanding, reason, and prudence M in old men.’ In similar instances, some English authors have employed a verb sin- gular. [‘ I hate the cruel pride and arrogance that makes men boast over a conquered foe.’] I concur, however, with L. Xlurray, in disapproving this phraseo- logy; foreitherthe terms are synonymous, or they are not. If they are, onlv one term should be retained, and a vero sin- gular joined with it ; if not, there arc ns many distinct ideas as terms, and a plural verbsliould be used.” — Crombie. 4. “ In such expressions as the following, it nos l)ccn doubted whether the verb should be in the singular or in the plural number : _ ‘ Every officer and soldier claim a superiority in regard to other in- dividuals.’ Here, I conceive, the phraseo- lojty is correct. The expression, ‘ Every officer and soldier claims,' might signify [ one individual under two different ilesig- , nations. Wlictlierwc should say, ‘ Every 1 ijlficer and every soldier claim,’ is n point more particularly (luestioned. We often hear correct sjieakcrs say in common con- iicrsation, * Every clergyman, and every physician, is liy education a gciitlcmaii ; ’ and tiicre seems to lie more ease, os well as inorc precision, in this than in the other nvsie of expression. It is uiiqiiestioiinhly, 1 however, more agreeable to anaiogy to j^say, ‘arc gentlemen.’ \"_f>om4ic. RULE IV. Two or more nominatives in the sin- gnlar number connected by the disjunctive conjunction or or nor, expressed or under- stood ; or the phrase as well as; require a singular verb : tlius, ‘‘ Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it wdth thy might ; for there is no work, nor device, nor know- ledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thon goest.” ‘‘ The quantity as well as the quality of what he ate or drank, was prescribed, by the laws, to the king. RULE V. Two or more nominatives of different numbers, or of different persons, joined by a disjunctive conjunction, require verbs and auxiliaries to agree ivith the nearer i nominative j as, ‘‘ Some countries are so cold, that neither the trees nor the earth produces fruits that will nourish man.” RULE VI. When two nominatives of different num- bers are joined by a disjunctive conjimc- tion, the latter of them explanatory of the former, the verb must agree with the former; as, \" The Decalogue, or Ten Com- mandments, is in tivo parts.” “ The Au- rora Borealis, or Northern Lights, was first observed in March, 1713-16.” RULE VII. Every nominative having a plural sig- nification, though not a plural form, if conveying the idea of number, must have a plural verb or pronoun agreeing with it ; os, ‘‘ In youth, the multitude pursue plea- | sure as their chief good.” If conveying I the idea of an aggregate body, it must have a verb or a pronoun agreeing with it in the singular number : ns ‘‘ The youthful party was quite delighted.” “ On many occasions, where a noun of number is used, it is very difficult to de- cide, whether the verb should be in the singular or in the plural number : and this difficulty has induced some gramma- rians to cut the knot at once, by asserting that every noun of number, as it con- stitutes one aggregate of many particulars, must always be considered as conveying the idea of unity ; and that, consequently, i the verb and pronoun connected with it, cannot-propcrly be ever used in the plural number. This opinion is contrary to the practice of the best writers, and against ' the rules of the most respectable gram- I marians. Some nouns of number certiiiiily convey to the mind an idea of plurality, 08 nobility, gentry, clergy, commonalty, pea- santry, soldiery, ancestry; others, that of a whole ns one tiling, ns court, army, meet- ing, congregation, parliament, party ; ami others again, sumetimes that of unity, and sometimes that of i)lurality,as, committee, council, enemy, people, public, senate; and on this ground it is warrantahlc, and con- sistent, to apply 11 plural verb and pronoun to the one class, and a singular verb and pronoun to the other. The impropriety of the following eonstnictions must lie immediately perceived : ‘ The nobility, ex- clusive of i7s capacity ns hereditary eoioi- sellor of the crown, forms the pillar to KEY HIS CHIEP OCCUPATION AND ENJOYMENT WEEK CONTllOVnUSY HE CAME UP, AND DESIRED THE INFANT MIGHT BE GIVEN TO HIM IMMEDIATELY THE FOLLOWERS OP MOHAMMED ARE PROHIBITED TO DRINK EITHER WINE OR SPIRITS, EX. — IN ALL ASIA THE RULERS ARB DESPOTIC. 26 ^ (!D0mp£iTtft0u^ ©nglis?) (Srammar. support the tlirone.’ ‘ The commonalty is divitled into several degrees.’ ‘ What reason have the army for proceeding in this manner ? ' ‘ The eongregalion were unusually large and respectable.’ In all these instances respectively, a different verb and pronoun should have been used ; and if the reader would apply them in revising the sentences, he would perceive the propriety of the change.” RUTE vin. Wlien two nouns, or a noun and a pro- ; noun, meaning the same person or tiling, ' come together, they are in apposition, that is, in the same case : thus, “ And Joseph was brought down to Egypt, and sold to Potiphar, on Egyptian, captain of the criiorfl nn Hhn mnL “ rj-n/l Lnt.h invited to become a trustee, in conse- quence of one of the individuals appointed under the wHVs declining to act. I am thy servant Jesse the JiethleltemiU's young- est son.” 4. Little eicplanatory circumstances should never occur between the possessive case and the word which usually follows it : “ There are several handsome mosques witliin the fort ; but no buildings worth notice in its vicinity, except Gholaum Shah’s (the founder of the city) tomb on a hill to the south.” Better, “ except the tomb of Gholaum Shah, the founder of the city, on a hill to the south.” RULE iSi. guard, an officer of Pliaraoh.*’ “ God hath made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler tluoughout the land of Egypt.” RULE IX. When two nouns, or a pronoun and a noun, or a relative and a noun, come to- gether, the latter denoting the property or , possession of the former, the latter requires that the former be in the possessive case : ! as, “ And the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake.” | 1. “ Tliis case is generally resolvable into the objective with the preposition of, as, ‘ the king’s sceptre,’ or, ‘ the sceptre of the king ; ’ ‘ his head,' or, ‘ the head of liim.’ I have said generally, for it is not always thus resolvable. For example, the Christian sabbath is sometimes named ; ‘ the Lord’s day,’ but, ‘ the day of the Lord ’ conveys a very different idea, and denotes ‘ the day of judgment’ lOrom- bie.) “A man o/[t. e. addicted to] plea- sure is a man of [i. e. liable to] pains.” 2. When several nouns in the possessive case, immediately following each other, are governed by a subject as the common i property of them all, the sign of the pos- sessive case is annexed only to the last ; os, ‘‘The Peshwa, Nizam, Rajah of Travan- core, and Coorg Kajah's forces, amounted to about forty thousand men : ” but when a subject belongs individually to several nouns, the posse"
