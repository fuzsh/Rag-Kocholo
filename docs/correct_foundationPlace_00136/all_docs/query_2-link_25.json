Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions? • Has the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 fundamentally altered the way financial service firms think about HR and Recruitment? • Has technology disrupted our assumptions of a best in class recruitment approach? • Is technology playing an incrementally different role? Have there been paradigm shifts and disruptions? • What is next, and what are firms doing to attempt to see around the corner? • Is Workforce Planning real, and what problems does it really solve? • These may all be interesting changes to HR, but what are the real business headlines to stem from this new context? In this session, Oracle along with industry expert and former American Express executive Bertrand Dussert, will address these questions and provide thought starters on many more. We will discuss the latest trends in HR service delivery in global financial service firms, and assess the impact of these developments on recruitment, selection and strategic workforce planning.
