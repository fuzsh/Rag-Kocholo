        "text": "Wednesday 11. November 2009 - Award-Winning Mac Tool to Reduce PDF File Size Comes to Windows\n\nApago Inc., a software technology company that provides innovative solutions to transform digital documents, today introduces PDF Shrink 4.5 for Windows, bringing the award-winning and popular Mac utility to Windows users. PDF Shrink is a must-have for consumers and small businesses that need to produce PDFs at a quality and file size appropriate for use with smartphones, on the Web, as email attachments, or for onscreen reading. PDF Shrink can reduce most PDF filesincluding those created by Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and other common softwareby as much as 90% of their original size. PDF Shrink 4.5 for Windows retails for $35 is available for purchase today at Apagos online store.\n\n“One of the major complaints with PDF is file size,” states Dwight Kelly, president of Apago Inc. “PDF Shrink has been extremely well received on the Mac and weve had a demand for a Windows version for some time. We are pleased to respond to the need of many consumers and businesses by delivering an affordable, easy-to-use windows utility for reducing the size of PDF files.”\n\nFree PDF Shrink Online Tutorial\n\nApago will hold a free online tutorial, which will provide valuable tips and tricks for using PDF Shrink 4.5 for Windows. The webinar will be held on Friday, November 13, 2009 at 11 a.m. EDT. To register, send an email to sales@apago.com or visit www.apago.com.\n\nHow PDF Shrink Works\n\n“PDFs are often created from documents and applications where PDF is an afterthought. We see a lot of PDFs created by enterprise systems with an inefficient structure, redundant or unneeded elements, and images that are much larger than necessary,” explains Barry Bowden, product support manager at Apago. “Even software specifically designed for PDF creation can be a challenge to setup properly without a thorough understanding of all technical options. PDF Shrink is designed to allow everyday users to optimize PDFs created by any application without having to learn new technical jargon.”\n\nPDF Shrink provides four common settings and an easy-to-use “wizard” for creating customized settings. The software allows for multiple settings in order to prepare PDFs for different uses, such as one for preparing documents to send to colleagues via email and a higher-quality setting to prepare files for storage in a content management system.\n\nTo shrink a PDF, simply drag and drop a single PDF file, or a group of PDFs, onto one of the settings. PDF Shrink analyzes the PDF(s) and identifies elements that can be optimized, often without changing the quality of the images. The software can remove embedded fonts and delete unused elements, including metadata, thumbnails, and duplicate data. Keeping up with the latest release is also easy with PDF Shrinks auto update feature.\n\nImages frequently make up the largest portion of a PDFs size. PDF Shrink provides control over the size and quality of images to meet different requirements. Apago includes support for common compression methods, including the sophisticated JPEG2000. PDF Shrink can also protect PDFs with industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized access or to restrict users from changing, printing, or extracting content.\n\nPDF Shrink 4.5 site licenses are available for $875 and an enterprise license covering all locations sells for $3,500. PDF Shrink is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2003 and 2008. Prospective users can download a fully functional, 10-day demo version from the Apago web site at www.apago.com.\n\nhttp://www.apago.com Back to overview"
