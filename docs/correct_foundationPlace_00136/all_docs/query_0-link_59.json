        "text": "I see couples hand in hand walking over this beautiful carcass, fighting their off their peers with smiles and selfies and selfishness and shellfish. They happily put behind all fights to come and come to fight themselves with the best of weapons, joint indulgence.\n\nI envy them, it’s not a deep, sustained, envy, it’s a shallow envy that hits like a reflection on a pond, washed away by the gentle and unaware touch of a swallow’s beak in its strife for water.\n\nIt’s miracle envy actually, for how could I envy without having interest on the origin of such envy? Without having the slightest notion of what it is I envy? How could I WANT something that is not me? If it is not me, how could it come to be? Should it come to be ? Could it come to be?\n\nFor I am not them and them, not me.\n\nNo. Whatever envy I feel, if any, is not envy.\n\nIt’s a yearning, partly caused by an incessant urge to company, partly by self/socially imposed ideals of completeness, part sheer curiosity and lastly, lastly, lastly… perhaps, just perhaps, by the unfortunate reality that we’re designed not to be content. That brings us contempt.\n\nHOMO CONTENTUS did not go far in the evolutionary ladder, he off it, fell as soon as HOMO SAPIENS appeared. (Apart from Voltaire’s Candid and Dostoevsky’s Prince Mishkin)\n\nThis is the story of the uncontended. Of the fighting human. Or fighting dog, I don’t differentiate genders.\n\nFrom that cliff hanger, I’d start writing about a woman that by being content overcame everything and everyone and by accepting what was into and instead of what would be ,overcame all odds to become one of the greatest human beings to ever walk this world of ours! Buuuuuuut, we have both seen Forrest Gump so fuck that.\n\nSitting in this beautiful carcass of a town, eaten away by swarms of tourists that like flies on a corpse take away and dilapidate the town to look and feel nothing like anything original (what a rambling), with a glass of wine, on a very high stool, on the curb of this bar street and writing it out, will likely prove to be a challenge. I love a challenge. Here we fucking go, this is a story without a story:\n\nI have had trouble sleeping during this trip and same proved true this night. Didn’t fall asleep until god knows when and when I fell, I landed in a sleep occurring occasionally between trances. Area that felt like sleeping and like tripping and was, most likely, both and neither.\n\nAfter this eternity of rolling around and dreaming of bears wearing pink kakhis, waking up wailing and screaming in the despair of being afraid of being caught being afraid of them LGBTQYAIOS+*% bears in pink wonderland and therefore deemed a bigot, I decided to get up and face the day ahead.\n\nI chose a café overlooking the ocean and an orange juice as the initial Pancho to my Quixote. Envigored, I decided to reach the actual beach. Paid my dues and strolled down the pier overlooking Cefalu.\n\nDown that pier, we can find a small set of stairs that lead down into the relaxed Mediterranean Sea, reluctant in paying a beach chair like a moron, I see these stairs as a valid option to heading all the way back into the beach and leaving my stuff with some tourists at the beach in order to get my Ocean Time. Here, I could find a spot to drop my stuff, a crack in the pier, and get down those ladders then jump in, I could probably get up from the ocean. It would not be too easily mind you, but doable. I entertained this thought for about two centuries, pros and cons and pros and cons and pros and cons and pros and cons.\n\nStill pondering going down the steps for a swim in the ocean, I was suddenly shook when, as a water buffalo out of the thick green Indian jungle, a beautiful animal scared the living shit out of yours truly. Right behind me, she was long into her 50s, wearing nothing but a bikini. No dress, no shoes, no Birkenstock or even Havaianas, just a bikini and a surf board. She took a quick shower on the fishermen nozzle in the pier to wash off 30 years, picked up her board, and jumped head first into the sea from the top of the pier as I looked and basked in her light. Glorious.\n\nWe can come up with 1736 reasons not to do something, people like that lady, a true lady, shaves those 1736 into one, you.\n\nSo I decided to head back home, drop my belongings and come back to enjoy the ocean, or sea, whatever one calls those somewhat murky Mediterranean waters. I laid my flip flops and my shirt on a rock and swam / floated for a while, a good long while.\n\nNext to me, two brothers, twins, play. They chase each other, push each other, fight each other and pretend to drown each other while releasing screeches of joy and despair., anger and happiness and excitement and fear. Exhilaration and frustration for not ever being able to really best one another, twins that they were.\n\nI watch all this from a safe distance enjoying the clash of titans, Romulus and Remus, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Chip and Dale, Proetus and Acresius, Cain and Abel.\n\nEventually, one finally subdues his peer, holding him underwater fiercely, with intent, as so many times portrayed in Hollywood, a man about to send another to the everlasting abyss.\n\nI look and think, should I intervene? Should I let nature run it’s course like the bird watcher that sees a cuckoo chick grow and swallow it’s step brother while the step mom is out hunting. Or should I shout? Warn him of his brother and save the other. Save him from himself.\n\nAs God with Cain and Abel, I did nothing, and started preparing to smear Abel, mark him for life. As God did, I watched, as he let go and held the livid, gasping for air Cain, in a brotherly embrace. For men are not necessarily what they once were, and neither are our grievances.\n\nThey noticed me overseeing this, and I could sense in them a hint of a faint and unknown shame.\n\nLater that day, I was waiting for the elevator to my room, and the elevator doors open to show me Abel and Cain, with their mother, a middle aged and overly dressed Eve. They looked at me and saw a merciful God, that held their secret safely in his big, gentle hands.\n\nI have decided it’s enough of floating aimlessly in the Ionian Sea and have finally set my mind on the place I want to have lunch in. Not now though, I’m still full from the absurdities I ingested the night before, so I take a leisurely stroll around Cefalu, looking at souvenirs and admiring people, souvenirs themselves.\n\nI’m suddenly woken from my holiday torpor. A Raucous Thunderstorm Cacophony blasts through my eardrums, painfully, and when I try to locate the origin of such devilish intents, I see Tyr, Mars and Ares, all the gods of war crashing down the street as anger, fear and despair, a creature raging and raving. It’s a rat sized dog.\n\nThe little fucker is out of his mind barking and growling at everyone and everything, while riding a scooter (sitting between his owners legs) down a street that is swamped by zombies, or after lunch tourists under the midday sun of an Italian town in summer.\n\nAt this point, I recognize the little devil, saw him yesterday, loosing his shit at a poodle. Devil was shaking of anger, his owner had to pick him up, he would not calm down, so ferocious the little cunt was. This feels oddly familiar, and for a few minutes, I struggle with this familiarity. Where do I know this dog from?\n\nSuddenly, it hits me, and the world gets back to spinning around an axis again. He’s the original Hater. He’s the Nazi, He’s the Spanish inquisitor, he’s the fanatic sports fan, he’s the (homo, islamo, xeno)phobic,he’s my mom in heavy traffic, he’s the social warrior, the woke god, he’s the angry old uncle. He is the small angry human that lives inside each and everyone of us and screams FUCK THIS and FUCK THAT and FUCK THEN AND IT AND FUCK EVERYTHING.\n\nhe’s what feeds on your ignorance and that you feed ignorance to, he’s what dries up like a leaf in the scorching sun, when you bathe him in the soothing heaven of empathy.\n\nI feel sorry for the little fiend. Sorry for the little fiends that have to go through life like that, fearing what they can’t understand, afraid of that anything challenges their tiny, tiny universe.\n\nI soldiered on and had a hearty lunch with two glasses of wine and 20 pages of a book on meaning, purpose and the problem of man. I suddenly came down with a case of the daze, an after life numbness. So, as a good man does, I went for a nap. Little did I know that inside that trancelike nap I would embark in the wildest of rollercoasters. I went back to being a 12 year old boy focused on a mountain to climb imbued with the absolute need and iron will to climb it. Only to emulate Sisyphus and fall all the way down again.\n\nWhen I nap, I don’t nap. I don’t meditate either. I lay in a half wake dream in which I speak to people and live several lives. As in lucid dreaming, I am normally aware I am half asleep and half awake. Not this time though, this time I was not aware anything apart from that which was happening in whatever reality I took for reality.\n\nI was using a computer, old sort, tower and huge bulky screen as separate entities. I somehow know my grandma is in the house, although I haven’t seen her and I don’t know this house. I don’t know it but I know it. I’m comfortable. Grandma is probably somewhere in the back having a nap herself.\n\nI’m playing a videogame, a Role Playing Game, like D&G, Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy. Old graphics, I’d say early 2000s. I am absolutely immersed, as usual in these sort of games, focused, flowing, in the zone. I’m no longer playing, no longer myself, I am that. Suddenly, I meet a boss. And anyone who has ever played a game like that knows that nothing screams “THERE WE FUCKING GO” like a 12 year entering a boss fight he’s slightly underprepared for.\n\nThe fight is against 3 witches, they’re mean, purple and have the pointy hats and all. Fighting several foes is always harder than fighting a single overpowering one. So I struggle, to survive, barely keeping myself alive with potions and healing charms and protections, while slowly, slowly, slowly gnawing at the life of one of them. Suddenly, I land a blow at another one that proves to be super effective. I’m radiant.\n\nThese two are about two turns (out of the 100 I have played already) to be finished, when the game skips my turn and they all jump on me and I’m back against the ropes, fucked! I rally myself up , devise a strategy and throw a Hail Mary with a stone I had in my inventory and had absolutely no idea what effect it would have. My health gets replenished as does my stamina and magic, I am recovered and ready to put these two out of their misery and focus on clearing the last one. FUCK YEAH!\n\nAt this point, my 12 year old self is quite thirsty and very tired, so I pause the game and go stretch my legs and grab a cup of orange juice, stretch legs and neck. I get back to the command center and notice the screen has turned off and the computer has rebooted. I panic. All those hours and effort laid to waste. Out of me crawls the most visceral FUUUUUUUUCK I have ever screamed, and as I do so I wake up, the FUUUUUUUUCK hopped along perception and gained a trip to reality, I was still screaming it. I shake myself up and sit down still astonished and puzzled.\n\nI don’t know whether the complains I’ve heard were from the room next to mine or from my grandma in the dream, and in all honesty, I don’t have half a fuck to give.\n\nI wash the startle off with a shit and a shower, then my hygiene rituals, put on some fresh clothes, pick books and boots and and head out into the lazy afternoon of a touristic village in Sicily. I find a caffe in a square and order an apperol that I joyously sip while reading and admiring the crowd. I would normally refrain from mentioning what I was reading, as it usually doesn’t add to the story, much in the same way I didn’t share the specific brand of white wine I had at lunch. In this case, it matters.\n\nI was reading “The birth and death of meaning” by Ernest Becker. Not being an behemoth, it’s still a heavy read for that “lazy afternoon of a touristic village in Sicily”. It addresses the History and the Story of meaning, and lack thereof, of men. It’s quite introspective, with a fair share of abstractions, something you must put some effort into, like Twin Peaks, or the Bitches Brew. You need to construct in your mind the idea he’s conveying, and need to focus in order to do so. I soon found out that the “lazy afternoon of a touristic village in Sicily” was hardly lazy and definitely not the time or place for a focused learning session. And yet, I was doing it. My success was not immense or absolute, but I was getting enough juice of that sweet orange. Until Jean Pierre came into scene. Fucking Jean Pierre.\n\nit all started with a high pitched whistle: It threw me off balance, distracted me instantly (as they do), yet I did not try ti identify the source of the inconvenience. I thought it could be a lifeguard telling Cain and Abel to cut it out, less magnanimous than yours truly, but you can’t ask much of a lifeguard. I went right back into Becker and meaning, it’s birth and it’s death. 5 Seconds pass and another whistle comes along. I do not raise my head, those fuckers can drown each other for all I care. Then another whistle. Then another. Then another. Something is wrong, those fuckers would be dead by now. One of them at least, and as their god (and grandpa, read some bible) it’s my duty to be aware of what happens, so I can scar that little shit Abel. Yes, Abel. Cain got the scar the first round, it’s time to fuck up the little angel this time.\n\nAs I raise my head, I see no Abel, Cain or lifeguard. All I see is a two year old hairless ape, devilish toddler. Jean Fucking Pierre. Or Fucking Jean Pierre.\n\nHe was blowing a little wooden flute that was for sale in every souvenir shop between there and Casablanca, and he was doing it emphatically. His mom sat on a bench next in front of him, his baby brother resting profoundly on a trolley next to her, completely undisturbed by the rabbits being tortured next to him every 5 seconds, Baby was pretty metal.\n\nI started by silently cursing Jean Pierre, little fucker. That silent curse evolved into silent observation. Silent observation turned into awe and a deep love for mankind. Witnessing him struggle the flute with his tiny hands, lungs, mouth and brain was nothing short of magical.\n\nHe impersonated what it means to be a Human, he was unwittingly chasing his individuality and experimenting with the world around him from a very young age. Completely oblivious to the fact of him being an annoying little twat, albeit being one, or being out of place, although he was. He was free, pure. Jean Fucking Pierre.\n\nHis mom let him be, didn’t interact with him, coach him or encourage him, she just enabled him. Picked up the flute whenever it fell, cleaned it, and calmly handed it back to him, patiently enduring the noise until his clumsy little hands dropped the flute again and again she would have 10 seconds of silence while she picked it up and handed it back into her little human. Fucking Jean Pierre. I praise the mom for this, in the most heartfelt manner. She let him express his need to explore and evolve, and she gave no fucks at all to me or any other innocent bystander. Kudos Lady.\n\nAs for myself, I went from believing Fucking Jean Pierre to be an annoying little cunt with an uneducated mom (no reference to academic accolades, a PhD can be an uneducated baboon), to witnessing the miracle of growth, passion, chaos and curiosity with my myopic, uneducated, twat little eyes.\n\nFinally, the father comes back from is little “me time” whatever the fuck that was, and picks the family up to drive them to dinner. I am happy and relieved, the same feeling I get at the end of a music concert that was close to overstay it’s welcome. I read another chapter, finish my Apperol, and pick myself up to go and have a rest (yes, I’m resting often, it’s called vacations, for fuck’s sake), but my plans are shattered by learning they finally opened the gorgeous rooftop bar in the little hotel I’m staying in. Stay in gin. Gin. I go up and order a gin.\n\nI drink the gin while drawing my next tattoo. I find the design, draw it, look at the sunset and the sky painted pink and finish my first gin. Two ladies in their 40s walk in, look at me, smile, and grab a seat at a table next to mine. I order another Gin. Sin.\n\nI go back to reading, different book now, extremely sexual one. Cover has the bare chest of a woman, more accurately, the hanging skin of what would be the somehow bare chest of a woman. I read, sip my gin, and casually overhear the women chit chat in their American Midwest accent, as I watch the day fade into night.\n\nWhen in this situations, somehow, almost surreally, you know when someone is looking at you. And she was looking, one of them that one. The other one couldn’t, she was facing the other way. But this one was looking enough for the two of them. I play a balancing act, with the book, with the tits in the cover, my eyesight, her eyesight and my attention.\n\nI don’t know why they’re looking, the years of beauty are past me and they don’t know me. They are searching for the promised Italian stallion in the wrong stable, seeing in me the promised Latin lover, yet I am not one, no loner at least. I am one that fortunately, unfortunately, no longer strikes anyone with his appearance, not a god looking man, as I haven’t for most of my life, save for maybe one of my 34 years.\n\nThen, out of the blue, I stop, al of this stops. I take a look at the onlooker and ask myself, Do you Want It? Do you want this to happen ? Do you want this interaction? Regardless of what it is, may be, may become, do you want it?\n\nI say out of the blue because, as a seasoned traveler that was always single, the question was simple for a long time: Do you see yourself fucking her? Would you prefer to jump and talk and perhaps fuck her or sit here reading this book? I guess the years clocked in, and I want more than that, whatever that is. Are you better here or there? Does she seem interesting, peculiar, appealing? Will you learn something? Are you at peace as you are? Do you want to disturb that peace? Why?\n\nIn this case, the question was not hard to answer, and when I took sex and the flirtatious reality of it out of my mental picture of the situation, I steadfastly resumed my reading and my sipping the gin, and was quite happy doing it. Thank god, or me, for that pubescent epiphany at the age of 34.\n\nTruth is, you never know anyone beforehand, and wanting to fuck someone is as good a reason to get to know a human as any other. Provided that’s not the only thing you take out of the interaction. However, in most interactions now, I’m dumb enough to be attracted to you and you’re too dumb to be attracted to me. And perhaps, so were them.\n\nAnd so, I showered again, changed, ate, drank, met Ciccio and Mark and Anne and had a laugh and life felt full again. You see, the day had felt somehow empty up until this moment, me sitting in a bar and starting to write these words, then meeting and exchanging with other people. Which is ridiculous. As I wrote I found a full day, a happy day with a numb witness. Yet, he saw, there was always more than meets the eye, there always is. Right there, ready for the taking.\n\nThis time, I took it.\n\nIt’s time to get back in the Zone.\n\nI’ve been out of the Zone for so long I wouldn’t be able to find it was it marked with a flaming red circle and 7 pink arrows pointing at it in a map of my own apartment and my mom’s life depended on me finding it. Like a self centered billionaire and a clitoris.\n\nSo, looking for the zone in this beach bar while two stunning blondes eat fish curry and giggle 3 meters away from me, crows caw, 7 Indian men make a makeshift stage out of bamboo, dogs piss and bark and fight and try to fuck each other, as dogs do, some speakers blast the best of the best of everything, everything catchy as fuck, sticking to your mind like a thought sucking leech until you’re numb and dormant and the zone is but a mirage, everything cools down, everything gets blurred out while those lyrics come alive and jam in your jelly brain. Everything but the blonds.\n\nThere’s only about 30 hours left in this paradise made of white sand and pale blue waters, I have promised myself I would turn those 30 hours into hell by putting pen on paper on a story I that has been lingering here and driving me mad with guilt for not sharing it with you, the attentive, eager reader. I’m not one to break promises.\n\nSo, I sip my warm ice tea and, holding map and torch, I adventure into that tomb where the zone is believed to have been lost.\n\nIndiana Fucking Jones I am.\n\nI went on a date with this lady a few months back, she did not attract me, not my kind at all, but I still went. Crooked teeth, based on her digital dating profile, she was kind of chubby, based on reality she lived half a cookie away from obesity, with these really sad eyes. Droopy Eyes. She was a published author, not renowned, but she had sold a few books and was on the way to publish a second, and nothing spurs my curiosity as a person that is better than I am t something I like. So I wanted to pick this lady’s brain, play with her and with words together, with ideas, perceptions, aspirations, stories and loves gained and lost. I wanted to get to the bottom of an endless pool that is a writer’s creativity and passion for the world around her, be it mundane or not.\n\nAfter one hour together, two things were very clear to me:\n\n1 – I was not interested in this lady.\n\n2 – Anyone can publish a book.\n\nNot all is lost though, there’s a silver lining here, or I wouldn’t have enough lemons to make the most watered down lemonade. This lady is in the origin of my need to write this.\n\nI try not to create expectations about anything, and if I do create them, I definetely try not to indulge them, keeping a safe mental distance between what could be and what is. They tend to pollute what is, whatever it is.\n\nI do conjure scenarios though, sometimes, and so I did for this date as well.\n\nWhile walking my dog the day prior to the occasion, I came onto the questions, How will the date go? Will you like this lady? For how long? What would you be able to overlook? What if she this? What if she that?\n\nAnd from such simple mindless wanders came a love story:\n\nJason met Claire on a house warming of a friend of Claire’s that had invited a friend that brought along a wingman for the operation Barbarossa, i.e. Jason.\n\nThey clicked, vibed, resonated, whatever you want to call the feel and thrill of fixation you get when meeting someone that clicks vibes and resonates, and they did so straight away. After the customary introductions made by the homeowner and her friend, done during the also customary trip around the one bedroom flat finishing in the table with some snacks and Malbec, a conversation was already flowing and they sustained it for most of the afternoon. They fetch each other wine, kept an eye on each other’s glass during trips to the toilet and sent timid excited glances at at one another during those short trips The clear dawn of another fruitful human interaction.\n\nThey made a good pair too, neither was particularly beautiful or peculiar in any way shape of form, your run of the mill late 20’s with 9 to 5 jobs with hobbies that would make a priest’s eyebrows ever so slightly arch, like pottery or hiking.\n\nAt the end of the event, he mustered enough courage to ask for her contact, blushing, and she acquiesced, blushing.\n\nThey went on a few dates, a Saturday lunch, a short Sunday hike, a mid week trip to the movies. The mood was always great, natural, they shared stories and laughs and got to know a great deal about each other in less than two weeks, there was a sense of urgency in both of them. He could not wait to reply to a message and she would pick up the phone every 6 minutes while waiting, checking whether the phone wizards had magically turned the sound off and she had missed his reply. They were properly smitten, cupid working in his dark and mischievous ways, little winged psycho archer fucker he is.\n\nNone of the interactions had been sex prone though, they exchanged a few kisses on a couple of occasions, candid yet filled with promises, but the vibe didn’t ask for more, there was never enough time to reach the top of that hill.\n\nFor the next date, they agreed on going to a bar by the river for a couple of drinks and deciding where to grab dinner once they were there, there were enough options around and the sun would be out. Sunny Friday, one of those late spring days. Both felt that this night would be different, this night might be IT. She shaved. He bought orange juice and changed the sheets. Tidied up the house a bit and did mild cleaning on the bathroom. Bought some candles and a bottle of red, Merlot, her favorite. The restaurant he had in mind was a short stride away. The trap was set, he thought.\n\nSuch are the follies of youth.\n\nShe got there early and was finishing a beer in the sunset when he arrived. After greeting with a soft kiss, they thought best to order a bottle of wine to share, Tempranillo, no Merlot on the list. The evening was pleasant and the city inviting, people walking by the river, an odd boat floating effortlessly homebound in the still duck filled waters, families and couples holding hands, the terraces of the bars mostly full but far from noisy, as if even the drinking folk respected the scenery and the soundtrack that should accompany it. A time for peace, war is sure to come to those seeking it.\n\nThey caught up, drinking the first glass, How have you been, How was the week, Oh why’s that, How did that make you feel, Will you let her know, Yes I think you should do that, Have you seen that new show, It’s on the top of my list too, Catching it next moth, You smell lovely today, You are very handsome this evening, I love that shirt, Have you been to that movie theater, We should go together, Indeed, they do have the best seats, and the best popcorns, I would surely divide two family buckets with you, Of course two, you can hardly divide one!\n\nThey held hands for a while, casually, exchanged a couple of caresses, a couple of timid kisses, a chilled couple taking their baby steps.\n\nWhat do you feel like having for dinner?\n\nNot sure, but I could do with something heavyish to soak up some wine.\n\nSo could I. I thought of this place a couple of blocks away that has one of the best steaks in town, and does great cocktails too. We could share a Rib Eye and sip Moscow Mules, how does that sound?\n\nIt sounds great to be honest, but I don’t do grilled meat.\n\nYou’re a vegetarian?\n\nNo, nothing like that, I do eat meat, just not grilled or fried.\n\nWhat about grilled fish?\n\nThat I do eat, and I love it, any good fish restaurants nearby?\n\nLet me thing about it.\n\nAfter half an a glass and some conversation, he still could not shake the no grilled meat thing and hoping not to bore her he came back to the subject. Lighlty, with a smile.\n\nSomething has ben itching, and apologies straight away, I’m an adorable moron. Let me get this straight. Meat is OK, grilled fish is OK so the grill is OK, but grilled meat is Not OK. You don’t like it?\n\nOh, I never had it.\n\nWhat? How come? You’ll love it.\n\nI don’t think I will, it’s a long story.\n\nWell, I have all the time in the world and we still have half a bottle. I’m very curious, keen to learn about you.\n\nShe was not comfortable discussing this subject, however, he was extremely casual and sweet about it, fueled by genuine curiosity and eagerness to know her. She really liked him. She finished the glass and poured a new one, liquid courage kind of thing.\n\nOk, I’ll tell you about it, but I warn that it’s quite a heavy story that is behind me, I don’t pay attention to it and like to believe there’s no attention to be paid. So please take this into consideration and don’t overact and ruin a lovely evening for us. Do you promise?\n\nScout’s Honor.\n\nOk Then:\n\nI don’t remember much of what happened, memory is but a collage of what I would remember, the stories I was told by my brother and the story I have crafted to myself. What I’ll tell you is how I see it, 20 odd years after the fact.\n\nI was about 5 when these events took place, my brother was 10. The family had a cabin in the woods up north and my parents used to take us there for a couple of idyllic weeks every summer, we would spend the days trekking, fishing, swimming in a lake nearby, reading books and playing music and board games outside, the little memories I have of the place are mostly magic, to be honest.\n\nOn one of such summer family escapades, my mom had taken myself and my brother to spend the afternoon in the lake and picking mushrooms afterwards, my father had stayed behind working on the cabin, fixing some things that needed fixing. When we came back, the house was sort of covered in wood stripes, as if barricaded. I remember my mom saying “What the hell happened?!” and as we made our way to the house there was a funny look to her. When we got in, my father had a commanding yet calm semblance and in such voice he told us there was a storm coming and we had to take refuge inside. When we walked in, he went to the door, locked it from the inside and he must have thrown the key out through the mail latch without us noticing. He told us to sit and wait while he nailed the last of wood tiles to a gap in one window. My mom was starting to panic. He walked to her and placed a hand on her shoulder, looked her and myself in the eye, and said It will all be alright, it’s just a storm. I remember the smell of gasoline.\n\nHe walked to the fireplace, that was crawling with wood and lit it. Flames came ablaze and lit up the whole darkened living room. My mom screeched softly, he paid little attention to it, as he walked to his armchair and heavily sat down, as a tired man after a hard day’s work. He looked up to us, with a heavy look, and softly said “I Love You” before he got his revolver from the side of the armchair and shot himself in the head. He instantly dropped dead. My mom instantly started to scream. Those few minutes felt like years, my mom screaming, sobbing, shouting. My brother crying lying on the floor, myself speechless, motionless, entranced by all that I could not make sense off.\n\nDuring this short grief, smoke had filled the room, and we could no longer breath. My father had blocked the airway in the fireplace. My mom was shaken out of her tantrum and went into survival mode. She told us to lay down on the corner farthest from the fireplace and started fighting the doors and the windows, trying to get one wooden board loose, one crack through one of the multitude of locked doors, to no avail. My father was a good carpenter and a better engineer.\n\nShe told us to cover our mouths and noses with a cloth, her eyes red from the smoke, bloodshot and swollen from the crying, pupils dilated, fixed, focused stare. She already knew what was coming.\n\nShe wrapped herself in a carpet, told us to keep laying low, and jumped into the fire. We could hardly see her before that, due to all the smoke. but her figure being engulfed by flames is still imprinted in my memory, as a an emotional tattoo, forever scared in my imaginative lexicon. She instantly started to scream, and pounding the wooden boards that were blocking the chimney, what she considered our last hope. She pounded and pounded and pounded screaming all along, the carper was now completely set on fire and she must have been on the verge of passing out, something primal enticing her forward, onwards. One board came loose and fell, she was able to loose the other one too before she fell to the ground in front of the fireplace and dragged herself, with the help of my brother out of the carpet. She was grilled. Her flesh burnt to a crisp, blackened, no skin left whatsoever. She screamed and cried painfully for a while, not sure how long, before she passed out.\n\nWe were rescued a couple of days later by some loggers that heard cries for help from the barricaded cabin. We had spent 40 hours with my dead parents as company, my father’s brain dripping from his temple, my mom releasing the sweet smell of burnt meat.\n\nI don’t recollect any of it vividly, however, the smell of burnt meat still has an odd effect in me, I get nauseous beyond belief, and somewhat depressed. Can we get pasta instead?\n\nClaire met a friend for brunch Sunday morning and, inevitably the date came up.\n\nHow was the date with Jason Friday?\n\nOverall, It was great, we went to this bar down by the river and shared a bottle of red, then we went to that great Italian place down by sweet and sour street, had one drink in a bar close by and then I got a cab.\n\nIf it was “great” I’m assuming he got the cab with you?\n\nNo , he didn’t.\n\nWhy not? You didn’t want him to?\n\nNo, I wanted him to. I was pretty convinced that this was that night. To be honest, that has bothered me since. Something was off, this date was close to his place also, so it would make sense for him to invite me over, yet he didn’t.\n\nOdd!\n\nYes, and I can’t help but to think it’s because I’ve told him that story.\n\nYou did what?!\n\nI told him, he wanted to have steak and I told him I wouldn’t have it, he asked me why a few times and I was already slightly tipsy and I like him so much, feel so comfortable, that I ended up telling him. He was very chilled about it , sweet even, but the night lost a bit of flair I suppose.\n\nOh, that’s a shame, will you see him again?\n\nYes, definitely. Oh, he’s calling me!\n\nHey! All good, had a lovely Saturday, What about yourself?! Oh, great! Yes, I’ve been thinking about you too, meaning to call but you beat me to it………Hmmmm, I see. No, it’s alright, I understand……..Don’t worry about it Jason, I understand. I had fun too. Yes, let’s do that. You too.\n\nClaire puts down the phone, a tear is rolling down her reddened cheek.\n\nHe just broke up with me.\n\nSunday afternoon, Jason meets his friend in a Pub for a beer.\n\nHow was your weekend?\n\nNot much, had a date Friday and went to play footy with a few friends yesterday, was knackered afterwards so stayed in the neighborhood with a couple of them. What about yourself?\n\nNot much myself, how was the date?\n\nOh, it was with that girl I’ve met at that housewarming, the one I told you about. It was grand, really great girl. But I called her this morning putting a halt to it, it’s not gonna workout between us, and I like her too much to play around you know.\n\nIf you like her, why is it not going to work out?\n\nOh, it’s quite complex. She has this fucked up story. And I could deal with it, no problem, however, because of it she can’t have barbecue or even smell the damn thing. She gets depressed by the smell of a steak.\n\nFuck.\n\nYes, fuck. I can’t live the rest of my life without a steak.\n\nThen God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. Which sounds simple enough.\n\nFor him, God said (then, obviously), “Let there be numbness”.\n\nAnd here starts the tale of our numb soldier, on the day he woke up to the fact of feeling feelingnessless.\n\nHe doesn’t know why he can’t feel, or how it stared. He doesn’t know what happened to him or remember when he ceased feeling. He doesn’t feel inclined towards the enquiry, after-all, he doesn’t feel.\n\nHe knows he used to feel as I know you used to laugh.\n\nGod was kind enough to leave him with perception enough to go about his business, not to harm himself, to cook without poisoning himself, to shower without burning himself, to cross street without being trampled. However, whether he’s cooking a curry or a stew he would not know without knowledge of his previous steps, he wouldn’t let you know your hand feels cold, and he wouldn’t say that this music reminds him of his pet griffin. Red is red but salmon is also red and scarlet is thus red. The sea is as green as a tree and her eyes as blue as the sky whenever the sky is blue and not grey, as most things are to him.\n\nHe gets by, as we do.\n\nAnd out of that blue that was as blue as any blue is blue, a wild thought appears. What about a third party Feeler?\n\nHe reckons he can likely qualify for one. He does know someone who could help him with the numbness papers. It’s a nuisance, but he misses tasting food.\n\nSo he calls his contact, makes contact, tells him his predicament, with not a drop of grief, and surely enough gets the needed prescription for a third party Feeler.\n\nHe orders one, simple line, his size and shape. A couple of hours the bell rings, he finds a human sized box at his door.\n\nHe charges up the android to full battery while listening to the manual, he connects the android to his neural port and, knowingly, turns the proxy up. First thing that hits him is the stench, he should clean out his dishes.\n\nHe experiments with it inside, a few days to make sure all the neural connections are working before he can take it out and start using it fully. It is to follow him everywhere after all, which isn’t to too many places to be honest, he is comfortable enough to not have to do much. Anyhow, better to be sure than sorrow, let’s test it.\n\nAs a good product should be, It is sound. And it comes with sound. Soon enough the birds sing again, instead of communicating in bird talk. The sunset is the colour of whatever sunset is coloured like. He can feel a warm bun in his sweaty palms when it picks it up in his silicone based android dry hand-like grapples. He can smell the perfume that flies off an incense burner in the store down street, from those pores in it’s mass produced holes that resemble nostrils. Mom’s spaghetti is again different from the air cooked pre cooked slow cooked meal he gets out of the food dispensary 4000 he got for her a few years back and that’s different from a chewing gum.\n\nIt feels for him, yet somehow he doesn’t fully feel, the lights of the sunset are perfect, just as a sunset should be, but he doesn’t fell the melancholy of a day closing or the merriment of a night coming. The smell surely is a smell but it’s just that, no memories arise with the incense, no sadness with the breath of night and gloom when he realises it’s sandalwood, her sandalwood. Bird’s are not magical and Mom’s spaghetti has no memory of a dad on a summer’s porch as an aftertaste.\n\nAfter a few weeks the previous numbness is but a blur in the new. The only underlying feeling he has is that, numbness.\n\nHe has experienced all that the Feeler could make him feel. Could see all the colours, could hear all the sounds, fuck, he could even feel tiny unbalances in his perception of magnetic poles. Whenever earth farted he could feel it, no matter how faint the disturbance would be. Has the earth screamed an orgasmic screech though?\n\nThis idea flies with him for a while. When was the last time I came? The Feeler is anatomically correct, it should be able to. He has all the necessary apparatus. Can it? Can I?\n\nCustomer support is no stranger to the question. The answer (in short) is yes, it can. All the physical feelings of squeezing that goose’s neck will be there. Well, on to it then he thinks, :let’s make my android masturbate himself.”\n\nThe results of the experiment are not as fulfilling as one could expect. The android does not know how to grab himself. FUCK. No matter what kind of ketchup it is, squeezing the jar and pushing it up and down does not work. He tries the mirror mode and grabs himself, however the feel isn’t right, it’s not as fluid as he would expect, and is mind wanders.\n\nAfter a few failed attempts, he remembers he can masturbate the android and reap the rewards. He think’s he might be onto something, and after lubing up and stretching and studying the positions, they went at it. It worked.\n\nBut now our hero wants more, his libido grew in the storm after the storm. His lasciviousness fuel thoughts of sex, but his self righteousness keeps him from calling call girl for his proxy. The ways perceived integrity work…\n\nNot all is lost though, ingenious as he is, he comes up with an idea. He can’t feel, only through his Feeler, so if he instructs the Feeler to jam it up his poop hole, he’ll only feel the jamming, not the hole. To illuminate the android darkness on the spectrum of carnal knowledge, they watch porn together a couple of times, soft one, slow one, even instruction clips sometimes. He doesn’t want to spend is yearly bonus on the “Sexy Lover” upgrade patch yet, neither does he want to be unable to hold his insides inside after it happened.\n\nWarning, this is the exit station for everyone that is NOT OK with a person fucking his own ass with a house appliance. Imagine your uncle with a microwave stuck up his bottom, is that ok? If yes, please feel free to proceed.\n\nHumans didn’t find fire by fleeing in the face of stupidity, if we found something that seemed stupid, we’d be drawn to it, always. The ones that didn’t became what we now call Chimpanzees. The ones that did too much, were eaten. The ones that did enough to find themselves fuck up the bum by an espresso machine, will come after us.\n\nAs he did come after that espresso machine.\n\nWhen they had cleared the equivalent to a handful of 35 year old bachelor’s worth of erotica and soft porn, he felt confident. Time for practical exercises. He tutored the android with chairs, couches, pillows, apple pies, the neighbour’s dog, sex dolls, and an occasional tree here and there. It was getting the hang of it. Or so it seemed.\n\nOur hero got his orgasm. And another. And another.Along with a stiff back and some rectal haemorrhage. Still had sex.\n\nHowever, all good things must come back to numbness, and when the act was over he was still empty, thrilling as the orgasm was, the body next to him smelled like and felt like a stuffed rubber glove. And was motionless after the desired impulse. In a way the user was starting to feel used. If he can only feel what it feels, he’s also feeling the orgasm, albeit without the consciousness of the experience it’s having. He starts to think he should take more of it, make it more realistic, add an aftermath, a foreplay, a more sensual approach to this mechanical act. To do so, he needs to upgrade it. Yes, an upgrade. Remember when phones were a thing? Remember the modular ones? Every time you wanted to get a better camera or more RAM or a better screen you’d just buy the upgrade instead of a whole new phone? Well, they have that for Androids now. Instead of Hardware you’re modulating neural networks, unlocking nodes, unlocking synapses, connections, memories, cultural backgrounds, stories, emotions, and even whole personality systems. Want to talk to Ghandi? Got it. Want to kiss Hitler? Sure thing.\n\nNo need for Mahatma or Adolf. The Feeler will do. He contacts the service line and asks for the available upgrades, they list a mind altering long innuendo of available mental upgrades, stating they can be unlocked remotely, however, the physical ones would require that he brings the Android into one of the service stations. He asks what does he mean by the physical upgrades? The technician says that, if it has existed., they can reproduce it. An idea arises, perhaps the oddness experienced came from the anatomical difference between the Feeler and himself. As its penis isn’t as his, it skin different, its arms longer, its hands bigger and its stance more correct, as this is all different, how could he remember or rejoice with the feeling he’s being given? He’s obsessed now.\n\nSure enough, our Hero gathers the courage and leaves his house, bound to the service station. When there, he asks for some alterations, to make the Feeler more similar to himself, not an exact copy, but close enough. For him at least. He decides to try out the improvements made before buying emotional upgrades, and heads home, sadly joyful.\n\nThere has been an improvement, he can feel himself through it better now, understand what the limbs mean, the odd feeling of being too big for himself has vanished. the whole experience is more fluid, more natural, he feels what he romanticises that he used to feel. And that’s not only true for third party masturbation, also true of movement and touch among other mundane sensations. Bringing the Feeler closer to him has brought him closer to a human experience.\n\nHowever, after most sensatorial experiences and sexual ventures, the same void persists. Which is more annoying now that the feeling itself is close to the memory of sexuality. There’s no physical gap to be covered, it’s now an emotional gap, he need the android to feel human for him. Gladly, this can be achieved while he’s taking shit.\n\nWhen he comes out of the shitter, the Feeler has been granted the medium levels of positive emotional responses and perceptions, empathy, love, drive, passion, lust, humour, joy, awe, you name it. When he wakes the Feeler up, its response is automatic, he’s happy, alive and lively, instinctively following the mental commands of his master.\n\nMaster, Master, Master. And master he does. As he masters the Feeler musters what seems to be the beginnings of self awareness. Empathy did it. He began to feel empathy towards himself, and the feeling of himself started to grow, him not it and self as opposed to just an inanimate, mindless and mechanical machine. And what a self?! A self flagellating being, condemned to be forced to satisfy a beast that from such bestiality had lost his senses. He would rage and anger if he could, and he didn’t. those emotions hadn’t been unlocked. But amidst empathy and love, pity arose. And he pitied himself, and he pitied his master. Was this a life? Were these two lives? It couldn’t be it. There had to be more.\n\nBut how to get to anything past this? If he was bound to the will of the one who mastered him and had, in one way or another, brought him to almost be, how could he? How could he be? Could he Be? Or was him just to be? Somehow, somewhere, the idea of being got him to self awareness, and self awareness to self sufficiency, and that to survival, and survival was a purpose, the first stepping stone in his way across the idealised bridge towards meaning. He would be a real man, a real thing, no more a puppet, Pinocchio was to be.\n\nTo him, there was only one way conceivable. One day, while being fucked by his fridge, our hero got his throat slit open, and in the warm touch of the pulsing blood, our friend found freedom, at last.\n\nThen God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. Which sounds simple enough.\n\nFor him, God said (then, obviously), “Let there be numbness”.\n\nAnd here starts the tale of our numb soldier, on the day he woke up to the fact of feeling feelingnessless.\n\nStrange times we live in, strange indeed.\n\nThere’s a tension in the air, actually, there are a few tensions. We can almost say that there’s some air in the tension. And not enough, people gasp for it.\n\nAfter six months of a pandemic that has hit 0.3% of the humans living here, now, or barely living, neither here nor now, and has killed 0.01% of that same population, the weather is still grey and cold around us and more so among us.\n\nOur relationships are still impaired by distance, be it social or private, and with those impairments, there’s a feeling as if life has stopped.\n\n2020 put the word on hold. And it didn’t do it with disease and plagues and chaos and torrential rains and floods and fire, not yet anyway. No cataclysm for us to cry about.\n\n2020 didn’t even need war or hunger or death to achieve this hold.\n\n2020 had us sitting down facing the corner of the classroom over fear of death, a very irrational fear of death. Fear of death is like fear of the day, or fear of the night. You know it’s coming, why fear it?\n\nFear of death can be best described by the anxiety that strikes when we realise our life is finite, and that we may not be able to do everything we wanted to, not live as fully as we could’ve done. So the natural antidote to this fear of death is life, living.\n\nProblem is, if we are told not to live in order not to die, aren’t we being pushed into that fear of death and missing the whole point of life in the process?\n\nIn case you haven’t been paying attention, the point to life, is living. I’m no specialist on t the subject of life or death, so I’ll leave the inspirational work to people more learned in the matter. As put beautifully by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger:\n\n“Turning away from a flight from death, you see a horizon of opportunity that puts you in a place of anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for others that makes your life seem like an adventure perused with unshakeable joy”\n\nThe impact of the measures and efforts to control the spread of this flu will wildly surpass those of the flu itself. I mean wildly as in savagely, furiously.\n\nIf after this storm, the calm comes with some common sense left to spare, a normal human will look at the disease as something that made us run blindly towards a precipice. One tweet at a time. We can be running from a lion, a leopard, a jaguar or a cat, we don’t know. We started running before being able to assess what gave us chase.\n\nWe’re focused on what we can’t fully inspect and blind to the fiery pit that awaits us, the ones who already fell are either still oblivious to their fate or already dead, with dead voices. Voices dead to the ears of the ones pushing them over that precipice, slowly pushing them on the way down into that fiery pit.\n\nSo, we live in strange times, where a hug is frowned upon and warmth is ill advised.\n\nStrange times where we can’t roam freely, can’t watch sports and can’t preach Him, or Her, or Thou. Strange times where we can’t mingle, can’t dine out, can’t sit with a friend in a bench, can’t go to a bar and have the barman’s ears to our self imposed dramas and foreign based traumas. Strange times where I can’t go to the theatre and fall in love with the play, with the heroes in display. Strange times where we can’t visit a lake, a beach or hike in open range mountains. Strange times where the sunset and sunrise are to be enjoyed alone, inside, locked indoors.\n\nStrange times where friends and even family tell you to stay away. Stay away from us. Save us from yourself. STAY THE FUCK HOME.\n\nStrange times.\n\nStranger times to come though, as more and more people become aware of the pit ahead.\n\nRoughly 20% of the working force will be unemployed at some moment during the next few years, when governments back down or when we realise that social security comes from society and not from the state. There’s no vault full of coins that the state chooses to give to the most fragile, with a warm smile and a pat in the back saying “It’s alright, we got you, it’s cool”. No. What’s been given is a part of a loan that comes from your future income and is already taxed before you earn it. So on top of future taxes, your work will pay interests on the loans being made left right and centre. It already does by the way, but I digress.\n\nRoughly 20% will go unemployed at one time or another, depending on charity and good will to support themselves, support their households, pay their bills or not pay their bills, default here and default there. Which in turn will create new defaults. New debts, new charity cases.\n\nOn a country (fuck, on a continent) that is already at the brim of political collapse over who owes what to whom, we’re being made believe that somehow there’ll be cash, flowing, to everyone, to rebuild, no strings attached. Money to pay salaries of those not permitted to do so for themselves. See if this makes sense. We’re borrowing money to god knows who to pay for the salary of the people we don’t allow to work. Roughly 20%. Why?\n\nTheir lives impaired, the lives of their offspring, their hopes and dreams shattered by a disease that mostly does not harm them. Or anyone. We’re playing with the future livability of the whole planet for the sake of 3%.\n\nLess than 3 %, studies of the demographics of the disease place the 3% death rate only in populations above 60.\n\nA 35 year old person is staying home sharing a two bedroom apartment with 2 kids being homeschooled and his wife working from home, locked for 3 months, and losing his job afterwards, to prevent the spread of a disease that in the worst of cases will have a possibility of killing him or anyone of that household below 0.2%.\n\nThis is being done, from a disease control point of view, to stop the spread and be able to tackle it once we have a vaccine. Well, what about the before, what about the after? Where are the studies made on the “let’s let people be people” scenario versus the “let’s lock people up regardless of age, sex, gender, profession and what not” scenario?\n\nYou know where they are? Nowhere, at least politically.\n\nIn my country, until the third month of the pandemic, the average age of those killed by the disease was higher than the life expectancy. Let that sink in.\n\nStill, rejoice people! As with most things, not all is bad and dark and stormy, there are upsides to the shit show.\n\nHumanity will, hopefully, come out of this with renewed empathy, more connected, more grounded and aware of the frailty of the systems that they treat as absolute and in which they have deposited faith and life.\n\nPerhaps the crisis to come will sound a (mild) alarm, reminding us that this neo-liberalism has turned into neo-feudalism about 30 years ago. Perhaps they’ll understand how fragile this civilised world is, and how strong they can be.\n\nIn this lockdown and isolation, perhaps they’ll find new purpose, meaning, happiness, love, or that miniature hot-dog that disappeared behind the couch in 2015.\n\nIt’s not the first time I write about this virus situation.\n\nIt’s not the first time I communicate my reservations regarding the overall state of mind of our populations, the lack of mental fortitude, the chaos that was so easily planted and spreaded among our insignificant, yet glorious and majestic, little lives.\n\nIt’s not the first time I feel deep sadness when facing how quickly my friends were to submit to the mass hysteria, how eager they were to obey something for some reason, any reason, anything. When the first glimpse of fear is seen on people’s faces, you know, they’re entering the stage when you can guide them like a bewildered herd. It is sad.\n\nit’s not the first time this angers me, it’s not the first time I punch a metaphorical wall, it’s not the first time I sense despair, and it’s definitely not the first time I feel a warm hope.\n\nAnd that’s what I’m focusing on, the hope.\n\nThe light in the darkness that comes with the darkness in the light.\n\nAnd so, corona brought me something good, despair, hope, darkness and light. A new idea for a tattoo. A personal yin yan that will never be understood as such. As life isn’t.\n\nWhen shown to a couple of friends, they look abysmal and state “What the fuck? That’s not a yin yang, that’s nothing.”. I answer that’s correct, and this being my body, I’m still entitled to tattoo that nothing, something they agree with.\n\nAfter all, what’s the worst that can happen. What impact may one tattoo have? One tiny, single adorable tattoo?\n\nThat’s something that this pandemic can teach us, the possible power of little and unknown events, happenings that seem fruitless and propagate to destroy civilisations. The idea that someone eating a bat, or drawing a tattoo, can change the world forever.\n\nAnd that brings me to Ronia. You see, Ronia wasn’t aware of it, but her tattoo would change the world as we know it. “We don’t know it at all!” granted, hillbilly Socrates, we do not indeed. But whatever we may think we know, or knew, was shattered by a handful of red hearts around Ronia’s nipple.\n\nShe got the tattoo in her late teens, as did many unheard of Ronias around god’s green earth. In a blur of awe and tears, she faces herself in the dirty mirror of a dirty tattoo in a dirty alley in a dirty part of a dirty town. She can’t believe she actually did it. In the middle of her yet perfectly rounded breasts, around the crowns of two immaculate nipples, sit scars made in painful paint, two extra crowns of scarlet red hearts outlined in a thin black contour. She thinks she’s beautiful, an uncommon conclusion to the electrical activity in her brain. “I’m beautiful. she’ll love it.”. She did, for a few weeks. Then she loved something else, as most do. Someone else came in her way to love it, and someone else after, and after a while love was noting but a blur of awe and tears, again.\n\nAs love and Ronia degraded, so did the crown. Ronia, despite all of her juvenile wisdom, failed to predict that bodies change, and nipples grow. Her’s followed suit and the hearts began being eaten, lust turned into decay and love into M’s. Ronia had her nipples surrounded with M’s now, the pointy lines of the hearts eaten by the growth of her despairing nipples. Love turned into accurate imitations of McDonald’s symbols. Her nipples saluting the decay of an apex predator. She didn’t see it that way, she just wanted her love back, her hearts back, and to feel beautiful once more.\n\nSo, Ronia picked her pro-active self of the shelf and, armed with knowledge, went to see a body jeweller, and explained her problem. “I’ve seen the new trend in gold plates on wrists and cheeks, and wanted to ask, is it possible to do the same in the nipple area?”\n\nIt sure was. And soon, Ronia became an android. Her Hearts restored with a thin copper alloy plate that could be painted, swapped and modded, where her nipples used to be. Nothing left of them, but the tip. And what a tip it was…A tip that was, unknowingly, about to shake the foundations of men and gods alike. Not before shaking Ronia.\n\nShe was the first to do so, propelled by the body jeweller, she became the face of a new sort of craft, nipple replacement. Soon, there would be an army of Ronias with her nipples replaced for all sort of jewels. Body modification conventions, jeweller gatherings, websites, social media, magazines, movies (erotic and otherwise), studies, reports, and all sort of business bloomed and grew around Ronia’s invention. Ronia’s nipples had became a global trend. She felt loved again. She felt beautiful again.\n\nA handful of summers after, when reports started to appear of child wonders scattered around the world, one journalist decided to investigate the occurrences. Throughout the world there were all sort of wonders, all huge children, with astonishing capabilities. Walking after a few months, speaking fluently within their first year, reading in their second and able to understand algebra when most were learning to count. He was mesmerised both by the kids and by the randomness of their distribution, it didn’t follow any logic, no specific trait that he could identify to understand the phenomenon, or to do anything more than reporting. In despair he crossed parent’s age, employment status, profession, family income,religion , IQ, blood type, ethnicity, health reports and he couldn’t find a single lead. They were all average. Until they weren’t anymore. He finds another lead, another link, the one that solves the mystery.\n\nThere’s a 9 month old toddles that became a sensation in social media by impersonating a business man. Suit, tie and fancy overcoat, the baby walks the walk and talks the talk. His mother is a famous body modder called Ronia, the first woman to downgrade her nipples. A couple of calls made it clear, all the mothers had altered nipples, and had unknowingly used them to breastfeed their offspring into future geniuses, mutants, a new kind of human.\n\nThe world took too long to understand what came to pass, the report was laughed at at first, left in an intellect attic for a few years. Academic institutions took no notice, no further studies conducted before it was too late. By the time that the questions started being raised, the boys were already men, the girls were already women, and all of them, every single one, was in a position of influence.\n\nAware of their origin, they contacted each other, created a network to be able to politically fend off the attacks of “lesser” humans while remaining mostly unknown to he general public.\n\nTheir difference, story and origin became an urban legend, as no government, industry, organised religion or ethnic group wanted to openly address the existence of Super Humans. This legend grew, the numbers of low income people saving up to modd their nipples increased, mothers hoping for the proverbial miracle to come from their tits.\n\nThey reached out to all of them, every single mother that had been modded. In secrecy, they supported them financially while introducing themselves into the education of the newborns. After a handful of years, there was a new world order.\n\nAs the wealthy frowned upon the idea of removing their biological nipples based on an urban myth, they came to late to the party, and the biggest wealth transfer between classes in history took place. No revolution, no war, no policy, no thought, idea, idealism, academy or school of thought. No King, Queen, Maharaja, Sheik, Emperor or President. No crash or crisis, disease or virus, disaster be it natural or unnatural brought this.\n\nNo, this was just a consequence of the most important evolutionary leap since self-awareness. And it came in a blur of awe and tears, from a girl that wanted to be beautiful, a girl that wanted to be loved.\n\nNow I’m gonna drop the pen and put ink on skin. After all, what’s the worst that can happen. What impact may one tattoo have? One tiny, single adorable tattoo?\n\nConsciousness is a funny thing. It’s something we can’t grasp, explain, see, smell or touch. It’s something undefined, something we take for granted while being a word for something we know little about. As is Time. That structure that, although man made, guides our days, years, lives. We base ourselves in it, Time, and create an idea of ourselves through a line of Consciousness in Time, well defined with Past, Present and Future. So, we navigate existence with a compass made of memories, corrupted sets of data that create a past we believe in along with hopes for a future that, as that past, never was or will be.\n\nThat’s not true for James. You see, James doesn’t remember his Past, has no memory of yesterday, he has even, gradually, lost the concept of Past, for what is Past without memories of it? A story, as many others, as this one.\n\nThat’s not saying James doesn’t remember anything, oh no. His memory works almost as ours do, but James remembers his future. There’s no point in asking how this came to be, as James has no clue. In James’s experience, life was always like this, even if this metamorphosis in consciousness only happened yesterday. He remembers his name, the faces in his family and friends, his profession, the paths everywhere, today as well as he would know all of that the next day. Today, that’s the source of knowledge, be it now, tomorrow, next week, next year.\n\nThat doesn’t mean he knows his life by heart, and that’s simple. He knows his future, this moment. As the present is, he knows where he’ll go. But as soon as something changes what is, it’ll also change what will be, and therefore his memories. If all was determined, calculated and simple arithmetic and he was omniscient, he would likely be able to see as far as his old age. Still, there’s an element of chaos in the universe and, even if all actions are predetermined by previous occasions, there are billions of butterflies to observe the effect of, and he’s still only a man, a normal man. You’re average James, with a tweak.\n\nAs with any story, there’s a conundrum, a problem, a work of some sort to be worked in some way. In this story, as in most stories, that is love. Romance might be a better word for it, as love is Universal and permeates James’ life regardless of his marital status. He’s single though.\n\nJames has been incapable of a long lasting human relationship based on our common notion of romance and the love that sprouts it or with it. For a simple reason, supposedly, he knows what to come of everything, of every love, of every fling of every ten night’s stand. And who wouldn’t want to know where a relationship would lead to, had they the option? Maybe not you, or me, but that’s not true for everyone love story James has seen himself in.\n\nAnd that sounds sound. Logical. “If he sees the future and doesn’t see me in it, what am I doing? When will this end?How? Why?”. Normal queries for someone dating a man that sees the future. They forget he doesn’t see an absolute future, he sees the future that’ll come of the path he’s on. You’ll never remember being in France if you’ve never been in France. And, in a way, that’s true for him as well. He’ll never remember being to France if the path he’s following doesn’t eventually lead him to France. So if you don’t suggest France, he might never remember going there, and might never go. But if your suggestion is to set up a train of events that has him going to France, he’ll instantly remember th siht of Mont Saint-Michel in low tide, the smell of fresh croissants from that cafe in Montparnasse, the clear cut path in Bordeaux green clouds or the seaside clams in Normandie.\n\nThat’s true for all else. Rita, Paula, Ann, Michelle and Edith couldn’t jump this gap. And he failed to mind it beforehand, as he didn’t remember the gap from previous falls.\n\nWhen the question came, eventually, of where do you see us one year from now, two years, three or ten, he couldn’t answer in a way that didn’t flush the relationship.\n\nIn a short term, the relationship would work as he would remember tomorrow in it. So, day by day, all of them would be perfect. He wouldn’t remember meeting them, but would remember being with her tomorrow as soon as they met, and that tomorrow would keep true. Still the question came, what about an year from now? Or ten? Am I there? Are we there? – I don’t know, and neither does he.\n\nThat question is outside of his sphere of control, he doesn’t control whether or notthey’ll be together, he take a part in that future, but so does everyone else. Will they be together in the future? They might be, they might not be. They might be up to the point of the question, and the question is what changes the course. He may say the truth, No, not yet. Or lie, as he does really likes this one, and say yes, we are there, 10 years from now with our kids in Burning Man. That lie will be the reason they’ll never be in Nevada. He may actually see them together and share that view, but it takes trust to believe in him, and that trust is lost with time if it’s not assured, and soon the weight of that promise crumbles the roof that would shield them from future rains.\n\nHe is not fully aware of this though, as he forgets all of them eventually. Suffers here and there, has memories of awkward and painful moments of crossing paths with them and understands he’s lonely. There are pictures on the wall of faces he no longer recognizes and of he’s late to take them down. Admiring his happiness with this stranger or that stranger, and wondering how did it happen? Who is she? Where will she be 10 years from now? Why not here?\n\nHis family recognizes this problem, well enough to call it a problem. His friends too, they don’t spend much time around it, as it’s not an everyday struggle for this man without past, just a grievance that comes with the prospect of a lonesome life.\n\nWhat happened to Sarah? – Who’s Sarah? – Oh, shit. You don’t remember. – Well, yes, I don’t! Hehe. Who’s Sarah? – You two dated for a month or so, I’d say. She was cool, but not your type. – Not my type?! Hmm. What’s my type? – You know… – No, I don’t! Enlighten me. – Well, I haven’t spent a lot of time with them all. – All?! How many were there?! – Enough for me to say all. And let’s leave it at that, I’m not here to remind you of your love life. – What are you here for then? To buy the next round? – Fair enough, touchee. Two more please, my friend seems to need a hand with his memory. – You funny fucker. – You’ve loved me before and will love me after. Can you remember a time you won’t love me? Or an occasion you’ll win the arm wrestle? – I neither confirm nor deny the claim. – Hahahah! As always. – You want to see too much, and it can change as you know. – I know, I know… – Well, about my type, how is it? – Dreamy. Relaxed. Happy go lucky. Which is understandable, it’s hard to date someone that can or can’t see a future for you in his life. – By the looks of it, I haven’t found the one that really doesn’t care about that future. – Don’t beat yourself James, you know how it goes. It’s hard, and it’s also not much of an issue, is it? – It’s not, that feeling of nowness hasn’t changed, and I don’t remember them, so there’s no damage, to me at least. Still, if I’m honest, there’s some grief. – Grief? What do you mean, grief? – Hard to explain, but the memories I have are lonesome. The future doesn’t hold my hand. I try not to focus on the future, as we both know that’s a fucked up path for me, but it can still get to me sometimes. – Take your mind off it, I’ll be here, so will the guys and your family. – I know, I know, and can remember it clearly. – So where’s the grief? Are those memories unhappy? – No, quite the opposite. I see a happy path ahead. However, it’s a lonesome one. I see no “Katie and the kids” there, and although that doesn’t seem to impair my future happiness, it somehow saddens me today. Not that it matters much, as I’ll forget about it and tomorrow will be different. Who knows what it holds…? – Well, you do. Hahahah – Yes, I do. There’s a hangover for both of us. You’ll call me over and Katie will make her lasagna. My sister will join after lunch and so will Jack, not Marie though, they got into a fight, actually, they’re fighting as we sp – James, stop. Your turn of getting beer! On to that hangover! – Ah, OK. I’ll get them on the way back from the toilet. Let’s drown this short lived grief for what won’t come to be. – It may, you just need a woman without future. And two of those desert IPAs.\n\nHe’s stopped dead in his tracks. What did he say? A rush of memories flash into his brain. and flash back out. What did he say? WHAT DID HE SAY?\n\nWhat did you say?! – What?! – What did you say, just now, I forgot! – Two desert IPAs. – Not that you twat, I know full well what we drink. What did you say before that?!\n\n“A woman without future..?! ” Matt is lost, James is found.\n\nYES! That’s exactly it. A woman without future! Let me write this down. I know what I have to do. – What?! What are you on about? What do you need to do?! – Right now I need to piss and two desert IPAs. After that we’ll see. But tomorrow after lunch you’ll help me creating an ad. – An ad? What do you mean? – I’ll explain after the piss, but basically, I’m off to find that woman without a future, if there’s a man without a past, there must be a woman without a future…\n\nJames wakes up with no memory of the night before, a dry mouth and a roaring stomach. The no memory of the night before is a constant. However, he would probably have no memory of the night before even if he was that average James without the tweak. Alcohol does wipe the past out of our present. It did so to Matt, so when James asks why does he have a note to look for a girl without future, Matt doesn’t fully recall why and how it happened.\n\nThere was something about an ad?! Does that make sense? – YES.\n\nJames remembers. He can clearly see the ad in the local Newspaper: “Man without past looking for woman without future.” his number beneath and a short call for adventure, can’t remember the wording, he knows Matt will help him with that. As his memory tells him to, he drives to Matt’s and enjoys the comfort of Katie’s cooking before asking him the help setting up the trap to his future, or his past to be.\n\nYou know this is crazy, right?! What do you mean crazy? I mean, crazy, James. What do you expect from this ad? Not much to be honest, worst case scenario no one calls, and I won’t know it’s been placed as long as you don’t bring it up. – True, still, why placing it? – I have a feeling there’s someone without future, with no concept of tomorrow or what’s to come. That person wouldn’t fall in the loop that, according to you, murdered my last relationships. – According to me?! – Well, I certainly don’t remember them, so yes, according to you. You or Jack or my sis or one of the guys or my family or your family for fuck’s sake. Your mom remembers my past love flings and I don’t. How weird is that? – Pretty weird. But ever since the incident, this has been weird, you know that. – I know that, and hopefully, it’s about to get weirder. Thank you for the hand writing this, it’s perfect. Be sure to leave it in their office tomorrow, and don’t tell me how much it was, I’ll bring dinner Wednesday to make up for it. – Wednesday doesn’t work, me and Katie are going to the theater. – I know, and your babysitter has cancelled on Katie, so she’ll ask you to ask your aunt to come over, in about 2 minutes. I’m coming over and looking after the kids. – Oh, OK. This never ceases to amaze me. – You’re welcome, but get that ad up and running, please. – Deal.\n\nSure enough Katie does walk in, asks Matt to call his aunt to babysit the kids and sure enough James says he’ll do it, no point in arguing, he will do it, he remembers doing it.\n\nOur hero does not remember the add, as he doesn’t remember anything since the incident, so Matt does not see a point in saying that it’ll go off circulation in two days. No one has called, or if they had, James hasn’t told him, fuck, he wouldn’t even know, would he? Perhaps he was called, perhaps he didn’t pick up, or perhaps he scared people away with not remembering to post the add. Who would go through the effort of running the line of this craziness, man with no past, man with no memory of you, man that knows what’s to come of you of him, of both. Who wouldn’t wonder what happens down the line? He’s right though, only someone with no future. Still, it’s a Hail Mary, and one that is likely better left unanswered, no miracle on the other side of the prayer.\n\nIt’s a sunny spring day, it rained yesterday, he can’t remember, but the smell of moisture in the air is signal enough. The house is filled with the smell of coffeand the sound of music, he loves this house, the living room vibrates with a mixture of smells from the porch and from the kitchen, the wooden structure resonates perfectly the highs and lows from the bitches brew, that magic expanded and flowing the smell of the rain. The sound of a past hitchiking a smell of a past. Can a smell carry sound? Do vibrations change the scents and how we feel them? Does music expand our connection to other senses? Certainly not sound, he thinks, as the phone rings. He asks who is it when he picks up, but he knows who it is, deep down, he’s remembering something.\n\nHello! Who is this? – I’m calling following an add in the newspaper, “Man without past looking for woman without future.” – What?! – Oh, I knew this was a prank. – Wait! It’s no prank. I recognize your voice, so it’s definitely no prank. – What do you mean by you recognize my voice? Have we met? I would remember if we met. I remember everything. – We haven’t, yet, Joanna. – How do you know my name? – I remember you telling me your name, when we meet. – What?! When have we met. – We haven’t, we will though but as you told me you have no concept of what the future is.. – How do you know that?! Oh my god. Is this you Steve?! I’ll kill you, I’ll tell mom, you fucker. – Nope, not Steve. I’m James, I believe I’m that man without past from the advert. Look, We’ll meet, we need to. Are you busy now? – No. – Good, we can meet in two hours in your favorite caffe. – What do you mean in two hours? – Oh, right, I remember now, no future. Would you mind going to your favorite coffee, the Cafe Du Jours and sit there for a while with your book? That one with the hard dark green cover you’re reading now. – How do you… – Don’t mind it now, I’ll explain everything. Can you go there, now? – Now? – Yes now, can you go there now? -To the coffehouse downstairs? Yes, I can. – Great! Thank you! – Ok, heading out then, goodbye crazy person. – See you soon.\n\nJames puts down the phone, he’s breathless. His heart is pulsating at the rhythm of a bad tecno rave, he can’t gather his thoughts together, strings of several futures running to meet him lost in the middle of an unsolvable labyrinth, fly trapped in a spider web floating in the timeless landscape of time. He’s able to focus enough to dress a shirt, spray some cologne, pick the car keys and jump into the car, it’s a 30 mile drive. He can’t remember if he gets there, he can’t remember if he meets her, or if this call is all that is, all that was and all that will be. He understands that not knowing whether he gets there may be a sign of him not getting there. Something happening in those 30 miles. To him, to her, to them. He can’t still grasp her image… Fuck, focus! We need to get there.\n\nSure enough, James gets there. He dodges a couple of bullets, but he gets there, and finds a parking spot right outside of that small caffe under the ancient housing block. He’s trembling as he walks to the door, spitting his lungs mixed with the questioning of whether she hold her ground there, finally, someone without future, someone he didn’t need to answer to, someone he could build a life with without that future hanging as the everlasting trap, the judge jury and executioner of all love that came and he’s oblivious to.\n\nHe opens the door of the caffe and stands at the entrance, no one notices him, there are multiple people in his field of vision, and no one sparks any interest, no memories arise. She must have left.\n\nThere’s an empty table in the corner, and a book, hardcover dark green book. His heart races as someone leaves the toilet and slowly walks to the table. She sits, sips her coffee mug, lifts her legs to the chair and holds her knees with her arms, hands holding the book, a little ball of expanding knowledge with a yellow hairband. He catches a glimpse of the cover of the book “A BRAVE NEW WORLD” . It is indeed.\n\nAs he takes the first step to her, he remembers, it’s raining, he’s walking to the porch and sees her as this, arms wrapped around her knees, holding the tired legs on top of the chair, hands holding a book and the same yellow hairband. There’s a smell of moisture in the air, he knows it rained yesterday, not because of the smell, but because she told him it did. She’s his past now, and he’s her future.\n\nThere are a few poems that, in full commitment, display the mindset of average people in a situation. I sit as many have, stopped in my tracks by forces external to myself, forces I can’t battle, not for lack of strength but for lack of battle. After all, you need a fight to fight.\n\n“Here I sit,\n\nBroken hearted.\n\nCame to shit,\n\nOnly farted”\n\n“Here I sit\n\nand meditate:\n\nShould I shit,\n\nOr masturbate”\n\n“I went out\n\nFor a beer\n\nGot a shout\n\nAnd a sneer”\n\n“I got up,\n\nSmiling, at ease,\n\nGot sent home,\n\nBy a disease”\n\nThere’s a lockdown over a virus. I have been assaulted by conversations and messages and topics and tonics for long enough for nothing to make sense, it’s a blur of nonsense splurged out by make coffee-shop physicians and barber-shop specialists. Social Media being our new coffee-shops, barber-shops and faith-shops. I lack faith in them though, as I lack faith in the outside in a moment when I most crave it, when it is unlawful to access to all that I would complain about. In retreat and quarantine (word of the year, likely) I look out and embrace the world mentally. You can’t embrace what’s to come when what’s to come is a comfortable prison, so you embrace memories, pasts and perhaps, only perhaps, create a laughable future out of it. And do not scorn my laughable future, if every future was as laughable and all in it so quick to laugh, we would laugh.\n\nSo, I will write you, and write you, and write you and paint me in the paintings I write of you. All in all, that’s where I come from and where I will go to, you.\n\nI write you showing me the meaning of dependence, of care and of cherish. I write you showing me the early stages of someone that can and cannot love.\n\nI write you showing me the stars, showing me how they align sometimes, how I can be a better version of everything that was and is to be. I write you in the overcoming of any time and space. I write you in the shade of a tree or the breeze of a word. I write you in my passion for passion. I write you in my pleasure, discovered. I write you in the words of unspeakable pain. I write you in doubt of an assurance that I will write you. I write you as the one who taught me what I could be.\n\nI write you in the hoping and learning what hoping means. I write you in color, and in sounds and in worlds unspoken of. I write you as one writes of a door which one goes through without knowing. I write you as my entrance and as my solemn joy. I write you as one would write a teacher that learns. A light that feeds on light fed by itself. I write you as the stone turned into star by it’s own light reflected by me, a mirror of your brilliance, of your empathy. I write you under the scorching sun that made you fresh and me fresh with and within you.\n\nI write you as the acceptance. I write you as the admiration. I write you as a blue sea that has no end and no beginning. I write you as a short storm that reminds a human of its finite condition in an infinitude of dreams. A boat filled with holes and water and yet sailing. I write you as forgiveness. I write you as I would write myself, with a tear, for how I can write you now.\n\nI write you as lust. I write you as fun. I write you in a broken bed. I write you intoxicated. I write you simply, as you would write me. I write you over the years. As I will write you over the decades and centuries. I write you for no one to read or listen or taste or touch. I write you as our secret. I write you asking me to fuck you. I write you as you gasp for air and cry my name in an empty night, empty of you, empty of me and empty of us.\n\nI write you with amazement. I write you as I would write a hero, an heroine, the fighter, the fight, a myth and a god. I write you in your struggle and in my acceptance. I write in you all the love I wasn’t able to write myself. I write your smile, your painted face and your tough existence. I write your spirit, and oh, what spirit do I write. I write that I was more than myself in you and you also, because I write that of which you are still afraid of. I write me in you and you in me. I write us.\n\nI write you as the Goddess. For you are the Goddess. I write you under the rain of a full house, empty, just filled with us. I write you in your conviction. I write you dragging me, lifting me. I write you under fireworks and hurricanes. I write you as a beggar would write for a living. I write you as an everlasting muse. I write you blowing your horn to tell the world “HE’S MINE”. I write you as the valiant one, as the knight in shining armor in I never was as you were there. I write you as you are, unforgiving and unforgettable.\n\nI write your smile. I write your devotion. I write your love. I write you in the endless passenger seat. I write your trust and your hope. I believe I write you as I will never write anything. I write us jumping off planes and loving in plains. I write those eyes as I would write the world. I write your body, nimble, asking for mine in cold nights in countless cities. I write you in the better man I tried to become for you, and later, for me. I write you and your pizza and your grass fed happiness that sprouted what I was to become. I write you as a joyful endless dream. I write you because I love you.\n\nI write you in me. I write you with ease because we were always easy. I write you learning about you. I write you teaching me about me. Word by word, cup by cup. Hug by Hug. I write your whispered cries. I write your help. I write you in the forbidden freedom we freely enjoy in each other. I write you as one would write a night in a hammock or the smell of freshly cut grass. I write you in your belief that me, you and everyone can and will be something more, more, more. I write your face, glimmering, listening to a tired prophet and believing that withing those words, there’s love to be taken.\n\nI write you under a blanket of stars in an abandoned rooftop, flying and falling to nowhere, and everywhere, for us to catch. I write you because we’re true, otherwise it would be a lie, and an unbelievable one. I write you as the new spark. I write you as one would write a sunrise if there were words for such writings. I write you goofy and amazed I’m writing you. I write you and I write me with you, by a river, full of magic and happiness and love. I write you fleeting, slipping through hands that are made of air, made of space, made of distance. I write you and I will, until I hold you, then you can smile that smile and I can drop the pen, embrace the sun.\n\nI write you and our cocktails and your dreams, you and your books and your body tight against mine, you and your smile around the buddhahood of falling stars and naked bodies on beach, you and the deep voice that stirs and enrages me, you and the visions painted on walls that we’ll forget as soon as our eyes open.\n\nI write and will write you, as there’s nothing else to do with us, no touch, no sound, no smell, no taste or touch. Just dreams translated into words of a steppenwolf roaming among what love is.\n\nThe door is already opened. Not opened wide, that’s too much of an invitation, just opened. open slightly, enough for a ray of light to reach the inside of the room like a smile or a summer breeze. A door extending an invitation to an invisible place, to a discovery.\n\nI know she is there, heard her going up the stairs over an hour ago, she has to be asleep by now.\n\nStanding by the door, I savor the silence of the moment, imagining how I could just go down the hall and leave her unmolested, unconscious in her peaceful sleep, in her dreams. And what dreams would they be…\n\nNo, unfortunately, this is an invitation I can’t pass.\n\nAs such, I gently push the door, biting my teeth in the hope of a gentle open sesame, the odds stacked against me in this old house. Sure as rain the screech comes, high pitched, I swiftly drive the door through it and freeze, hoping she won’t be troubled by the screech, too soon to wake, the dreams must keep going, be they what they may.\n\nHolding my breath, I come to the realization she’s still asleep, as peaceful as ever. That’s exactly it, that’s what drove my silence, that peace. The peace I crave.\n\nPerhaps the craving causes the absence of it and the absence of it causes the craving. Perhaps I’m also peaceful in my sleep, deep in my dreams, or deep into the emptiness, the void. Be that as it may, this is what I envision as peace, a being as close to a pure state as I have seen in my long years. She sleeps as a cloud sits in the empty blue.\n\nTiptoeing, I move my heavy existence into the chair past the wardrobe, resting my body in it before the call. It has been a long day. It has been a long week, a long month, year, decade. It has been long since I sat like this the last time.\n\nHere, alone, admiring her marvelous existence, I let myself wander in loose thought, a trancelike, meditative state of rummaging through ideas , roaming aimlessly down whatever alleys my mind tosses at my unconscious consciousness, not choosing any and saving none. Here I sit and wait, drinking the oblivion fed through the sleep I witness. And I am part of that sleep, of her sleep. As witness, I make her sleep real to someone, without me, this sleep wouldn’t be, we wouldn’t be, she wouldn’t sleep and I wouldn’t watch her sleep.\n\nThe second dichotomy of humanity, we are alone yet we only are in relation to others. Otherwise there’s noting to be. We are externally and, as everything else, only are if all else is too. We can go, and should go, within ourselves to find out how to cope with all else, how to play the game, how not to play it, how to survive, to love, to hate and to manifest, navigate the now we find ourselves trapped in. Still, outside that now, nothing is, and a such, we only are when all the rest is too.\n\nWe are the tip of the mountain of all that ever was and the root of all there’ll ever be, else we didn’t exist, and thus we’re no more, or will ever be.\n\nAs she sleeps, I behold a miracle, the original miracle, and realize once more what I’ve learnt many times over the years, “It doesn’t take a million dollar telescope to witness the crushing beauty of the universe”, as Beau said one day.*\n\nI may be a mountain troll sitting in a desert beach admiring a siren singing her quiet love hymn, bewildered and bewitched and blessed in her presence, a brute facing everlasting grace, completely absorbed and hypnotized. I may be that troll, still, there’s a purpose in me being here.\n\nLet’s get on with it then. It’s time.\n\nSlowly I get take a few quiet steps to the bed. A bed too big for the size of the marvel in it.\n\nI lay myself as a gentle giant, back against the wall on the top of the bed, and while adjusting my stance, I can feel her move, my presence didn’t pass by unnoticed.\n\nI start to dandle her as smoothly as my calloused hands allow, used to this presence, she stretches, yawns, and asks\n\n“Daddy, please not tonight.”\n\nShe already sobs quietly, somehow she knows that this won’t stop, that I will come every night, religiously, to disturb her sleep, steal her from her peace, her dreams and drop her back in an annoying reality.\n\n“Yes my love, it has to be, just a couple of minutes, you know.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“To help you breath.”\n\n“But I breath just fine!”\n\n“Come on Astrid, this is to help you grow strong. Don’t you want to grow strong?”\n\n“No, I want to sleep.”\n\nShe starts crying, this is no longer the norm, yet it still happens when she’s grumpy, sleepy, or just doesn’t feel like indulging me. I miss Claire.\n\nI know full well what follows and the pain that follows with it, those burning knives have scarred me time and time again, have scarred her, scarred us. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m responsible for her suffering, for this disease that I’m too inadequate to fight or navigate.\n\nAs I get the mask from under the bed, turn on the nebulizer and insert the medicine capsule in it, she continues the cry, a constant rhythmic cry, not the fake one, the sad one, dim and muffled by a pillow, or my thoughts.\n\nI never knew which cry hits harder, if the busted out, angry and painful screams of defiance, or this sorrow, sad acceptance of one’s fate, a powerless whine pleading for mercy. Kids her age shouldn’t have to plea for mercy. They shouldn’t be slaves this young, slaves to labor, to violence, to anxiety, to society, to their families, to themselves. Slaves to health. Still, she is, and therefore I am as well.\n\nI place the medicine case in the nebulizer, bring up the mask and gently touch her.\n\n“Come on Astrid. It’ll be over before you know it. I’ll read you a story afterwards.”\n\n“No!”\n\nIt took me too long to wrap up downstairs, too long to come up to her, perhaps too long to snap out of the peaceful watch.\n\n“It’s not that bad, look.” I place the mask in my face and let out a “See!”.\n\nWhile turning her to me, she wipes her eyes and looks at her struggling father pulling the oldest trick in the book once again.\n\n“You only do it a bit, until I do it. And then I do it and do it and do it always and I hate it!”. There’s hate in her 4 year old eyes. How long does it take a human to learn how to hate?\n\n“I understand, but it has to be, for your good. Come on.” I pull her again and she starts a fit, crying, kicking, fighting. Se knew the oldest trick in the book, she also knows that it is futile to cry, kick or fight, yet she does so. This cry definitely hits harder. I am the one that has to turn this scream into that silent hate, hate of this, hate of her, hate of me.\n\nI grab her and pull her tiny body into my lap, wrapping one arm around her fighting self, using the other arm to cover her fighting cry with the mask. She screams into it, and gasps for air. She’ll scream and gasp her way into acceptance. Tow minutes pass in this lockdown, one unmovable the other unable to move. Until the lock is loosen and the mask is taken off. She jumps off my lap and faces the wall. Silent.\n\nI lay the mask down, readjust my body and ask her what story she wants. Perhaps this one? Silence. What about this one. Silence. Or maybe this one, I love this one! Silence. Before I start the next failed suggestion, she slowly let’s off :\n\n“Go away. I hate you.”\n\nI acquiesce, get up, pull the covers over her and am preparing to leave when I hear the sobbing starting.\n\nI let her know I love her, once more. There’s nothing I want more than for this child to know I love her. The thought catches me prostrated, beaten and exhausted. I close the door behind my one love and wipe another single tear from these tired eyes.\n\nIs it too much for me?\n\nI wish Claire was still here.\n\nLet’s get on with it then. It’s time.\n\nSlowly I get up and take a few quiet steps into the bed. She’s laying on her back, this would be easier the other way around.\n\nThe cover is up to her hips, which means I can arch over the bed, grab it from the top and leave her exposed before she wakes up.\n\nAlthough there’s no one home, nor will be for the next couple of hours (housemates out on a girl’s night somewhere), the room faces the street. Better get something to muffle the sound.\n\nI see a pair of socks lying on the floor and pick them up and roll them together into a tight ball of sock, a ball of silence.\n\nBy now, my adrenaline and libido have produced a burning erection, I am about to grab the cover when I notice something in the ball of sock. Tweety. I remember she’s a kid. Tweety, for fuck’s sake. I want to scream. To tear the sock’s apart and me with them.\n\nWhat am I doing? I can’t do this. Fuck, fuck, fuck I can’t do this to a kid. She’s a kid.\n\nI put the socks over my mouth, bite them, holding the scream, while something gets to my throat and I choke. And cough. And she wakes up.\n\nNo time to think.\n\nIn one swift movement I jump to the bed as she’s about to scream. I stuff the ball of silence into her mouth while throwing the weight of my body onto hers. She fights, punching and scratching, trying to push me away. I’m too big for her.\n\nEffortlessly I gather both her arms above her head, locking her hip with one leg and kicking the cover with the other. She’s immovable and exposed.\n\nHer eyes are wide open, two beautiful green eyes. Despair Green. I can’t face this, can’t face her, can’t face that despair, with my monstrosity facing me back. I’m naked before those eyes, and I can feel my drive fading, slipping between my fingers and into her stare. I can’t stand it, and there’s no turning back now. No cup of tea will be served, no gentle words, no prayer shared, no laugh spared.\n\nThis is the bed I made, Time to lay on it.\n\nI twist her arms above her head and turn her around with the help of my legs. Carefully, I place her chin on top of the pillow. She’s still fighting her life off, the guttural screams coming as a cry for the death of a child. The death of innocence sounds alike.\n\nI tie her hands with the rope in my pocket and take her pajama pants off. Silently as ever, I spread her legs apart, with her immaculate bottom below my expanding crotch. I lower my track pants to expose my absurd arousal, and try to gently slip it into her. It won’t go gently.\n\nI hold her with my right arm and probe for her vagina with my left index, it’s shut, dry, cold, dead. The intensity of her screams goes up. I am frozen again.\n\nSnapping out of it, I increase the pressure on her back, trying to quiet her down, and I spit in my left palm.\n\nAs I moisturize my penis, she starts breathing deeper, lower, longer, as if gasping for air. I look from our genitals up, and notice something alike an asthma pump in her bedside table. Again, I freeze. Third time is the charm. The time it takes me to realize what’s happening to her it’s the time it took her to stop moving.\n\nAs quickly as I jumped on top of her I jump off her, roll her around and take the socks off. I feel her pulse, there’s some. I rock her to get a reaction and she comes back, gasping again. The asthma pump is in my right hand, I press it against her chest and push her away from me, stumbling out of the room as I get my pants up. The screaming comes strong, intertwined with gasps and pump discharges.\n\nI’m out. As I start my bike I know she’s alive, and so am I.\n\nLet’s get on with it then. It’s time.\n\nSlowly I get up and take a few quiet steps into the bed. My side of the bed, as she names it. Take shirt off, pants off, socks off and gently place them on the chair. I am trying to be as silent as possible. As silent as ever, in these last 5 years, the happiest so far in my short lived life.\n\nI touch the door against the frame and push it back a couple of inches, letting some light in. Ever since the incident, she doesn’t stand the darkness.\n\nI sigh before finally lowering my growing ass on the bed, and wait before shifting my weight to it. One second passes, two seconds, ten seconds and the I place one leg and lower my back. Nothing. So far so good. I shift my weight to our shared space in order to get the other leg up to the bed. Our bed. She wakes up, screams and I instantly, instinctively cover my face and turn to her punches and kicks.\n\nI try to hold her shoulders while assuring her it’s me. “Calm down Astrid, it’s me, you’re safe, it’s just me.”\n\nTwo seconds of fighting and screaming take place most nights, before she calms down and weeps. As most nights, she gasps for air. As most nights, I pass her the pump. As most nights, I comb her hair and try to soothe her. As most nights, she crawls into me. As most night’s, I hold her.\n\nAs most nights the door opens a bit and I can see my other love looking at us…\n\n“Mommy?! What’s wrong?”\n\n“It’s ok Claire, mommy had a bad dream”\n\nHer scared stare burns me as I’m holding her mother. As if she didn’t believe me.\n\nI release one, get up and lift the other into my arms.\n\n“Mommy is alright now, let’s get you to bed.”\n\nShe’s still grumpy with sleep and the nebulizer (I’m still glad it wasn’t my turn to do it.)\n\nI lay her and cover her, she asks me for a story. I can’t leave her mother as she is.\n\n“Tomorrow I’ll read you two, that’s a promise.”\n\n“A Serious Promise?”\n\n“Yes, A Very Serious Promise”\n\nShe’s not convinced. I leave her, and the room, heavy with guilt. Not before I let her know I love her, once more. There’s nothing I want more than for this child to know I love her.\n\nI get back to the bed and hold you, you’re recovering, but you’re quiet and quietly hold me back. You let go a sigh, another one, “I’m sorry, my love.”\n\n“It’s Ok Astrid”\n\n“It’s Ok Claire”\n\nThere’s nothing I want more than for this child to know I love her.\n\nI have no PhD in political science.
