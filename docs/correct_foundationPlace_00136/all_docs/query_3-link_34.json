        "text": "Apago Inc. has released PDFshrink and PDFshrink Lite v2.0. The company said the new version of PDFshrink can reduce the size of most PDF files from 5 to 90 percent their original size.\n\n<?php virtual(“/includes/boxad.inc”); ?>\n\nApago president Dwight Kelly explained that PDFshrink takes the place of plug-ins that work with the full version of Acrobat, such as Apago’s own imageAlter. PDFshrink can work with PDF files generated by the Mac OS X “Save as PDF” function and popular applications like those included with Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, InDesign and Illustrator.\n\nThe new version of PDFshrink and PDFshrink Lite reduce PDF sizes by removing duplicate images and metadata, page thumbnails and Photoshop and Illustrator edit info.\n\nPDFshrink offers control over image compression and resolution, and supports various compression methods to optimize embedded images in PDF files. Annotations, form fields, JavaScripts and digital signatures are all maintained. 2.0 gains more control in compression and resolution choices, and takes full advantage of Mac OS X-based multithreading for faster batch processing. Users can also identify “Hot Folders” to monitor.\n\nPDFshrink Lite is an “economy” version that sports a drag and drop interface and less customizability.\n\nPDFshrink and PDFshrink Lite is compatible with Mac OS X 10.2 or higher, and require a G3 with 128MB RAM or better. PDFshrink retails for US$125 while PDFshrink Lite is $35; registered users of previous versions can upgrade to 2.0 for free. A 10 day trial demo version is available for download."
