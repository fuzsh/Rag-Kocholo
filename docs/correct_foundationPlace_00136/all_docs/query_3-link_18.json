        "text": "Users Put Powerful New Features of PDF Production Tool to Work Immediately\n\nAlpharetta, GA - December 13, 2005 - Apago Inc., a software developer for\n\nthe graphic arts and document management industries, today announces the\n\nimmediate availability of PDF Enhancer 3.1, a powerful production tool for\n\nPDF document assembly and preparation tasks. PDF Enhancer streamlines the\n\ncreation of PDF documents by automating the most common preparation tasks,\n\nincluding assembly, optimization, stamping, cropping, imposition and color\n\ncorrection, which previously required several applications and extensive\n\nmanual labor. The latest upgrade, which was introduced in September at the\n\nPrint 05 tradeshow, adds several important features, including support for\n\nMac OS X version 10.4 (Tiger), font repair, new color correction options\n\nand digital signatures.\n\n\"We are pleased to release an updated PDF Enhancer that incorporates many\n\nnew features and capabilities that our customers requested,\" comments\n\nDwight Kelly, president of Apago. \"With each release, PDF Enhancer is\n\nbecoming the tool for working with PDF files.\"\n\nPDF Enhancer 3.1 user Gareth O'Brien, CEO of Objective Advantage, says, \"We\n\nfound the selective color correction feature extremely useful. One of our\n\nclients has a repository of thousands of EPS logos with RGB colors that are\n\nused by their web-to- print system when creating PDFs. They also have\n\nseveral hundred others that use spot colors with an obsolete, color-naming\n\nconvention. As a result, what should have been 2- color jobs generated up\n\nto 8 plates. To correct these problems, we configured the client's\n\nOANetConnect workflows to use PDF Enhancer 3.1, which eliminated the need\n\nto manually correct the source files=F3a project that would have taken\n\nconsiderable time and effort.\"\n\n)From consumers and small businesses to large magazines and newspapers, PDF\n\nEnhancer 3.1 allows users to build a new document from multiple sources, to\n\ntake \"print-ready\" documents and prepare them for distribution on the\n\nInternet, or simply to modify PDF files to meet specific output\n\nrequirements. PDF Enhancer does this by taking a single, general-purpose\n\nPDF file and targeting it to a specific use. Each \"target\" consists of a\n\ncollection of settings about the optimizations and improvements that will\n\nbe applied to the document. With its industry-standard, ICC-based color\n\nconversion engine, full-featured imposition, page box, and stamping\n\nmanagers, PDF Enhancer provides users with low- to high-volume needs the\n\ntools for repurposing PDF files for optimal use according to the intended\n\noutput target. PDF Enhancer also reduces the size of most PDF files through\n\ntechniques such as image optimization, unused or duplicate element removal,\n\nand analysis of the internal make-up of files to eliminate additional\n\nredundancies.\n\nNew features in PDF Enhancer 3.1 include:\n\n* Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger and Automator support\n\n* Digital signatures to secure documents\n\n* Selective color correction to directly map certain colors to other\n\ncolors; for\n\nexample, CMYK to \"Coke Red\" spot color\n\n* Font repair including rebuilding ToUnicode tables required by the ISO PDF/=\n\nA\n\ndocument archiving standard\n\n* Font conversion to eliminate problematic CID fonts\n\nPDF Enhancer key features include:\n\n* Document Assembly: Build a new document from hundreds to thousands of PDF\n\ndocuments and scanned pages in TIFF and JPEG formats. PDF Enhancer's\n\nMerger makes it easy to select source files and set page order.\n\n* Images and Compression: Minimize PDF file sizes by both reducing image\n\nresolution to match specific quality requirements and compressing the imag=\n\nes.\n\nEnhancer supports both lossy and loss-less compression. The Advanced Serve=\n\nr\n\nEdition supports JBIG2, which can reduce the size of scanned pages by up t=\n\no\n\n90%.\n\n* Resize and Impose Pages: Resize (A4 to letter), crop and rotate pages. Als=\n\no\n\ncreate booklets, n-up and step-and-repeat layouts with the imposition\n\nfeature.\n\n* Stamps, Watermarking and Page/Bates Numbering: Add stamps and watermarks\n\nto the foreground or background of a PDF at any location, angle, size,\n\ntransparency or layer. Include page- or Bates-numbering with complete cont=\n\nrol\n\nover the formatting, location and appearance.\n\n* Fonts: Embed and subset fonts in a PDF file. PDF Enhancer can also convert\n\nfonts to \"outlines\" while retaining full text search capabilities. This\n\nunique and\n\nexclusive feature, called Searchable Outlines, reduces file size and avoid=\n\ns\n\ncompatibility issues with certain font formats including CID.\n\n* Color Management: PDF Enhancer incorporates a professional-grade color\n\nmanagement system that fully supports ICC profiles, including DeviceLink a=\n\nnd\n\nICC 4.0 profiles, and PDF/X to insure the highest-quality color conversion=\n\ns\n\npossible. Users can convert RGB to CMYK for printing, or CMYK to RGB for w=\n\neb\n\nor screen use. The advanced options allow precise control of CMYK to CMYK\n\nconversions.\n\n* Security: Protect PDF files from unauthorized access or use with Acrobat-\n\ncompatible security settings with 40- or 128-bit encryption. The Advanced\n\nServer\n\nEdition can also digitally sign a PDF.\n\n* Metadata: Add or modify metadata, including author information, dates and\n\ncopyrights. PDF Enhancer 3.1 fully supports Adobe's XMP metadata standard.\n\n* Full-featured GUI application is available for Mac OS X and Windows\n\nNT/2000/XP/2003. Command-line Server Editions are available for Windows,\n\nMac OS X, Sun Solaris and IBM AIX. The Windows Server Editions include a\n\nCOM/.NET component.\n\nPricing for Standard Edition is $199, Professional Edition $399, Server\n\nEdition $999, and Advanced Server Edition $1,999. PDF Enhancer 3.1 is\n\navailable as a free upgrade to customers who previously purchased PDF\n\nEnhancer 3.0.
