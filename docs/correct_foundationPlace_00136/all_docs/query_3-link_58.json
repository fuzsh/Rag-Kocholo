        "text": "If you cannot see the \"ng serve\" command running, then you can do the following on Mac OSX (This should work on any Linux and Uni software as well).\n\nps -ef | grep \"ng serve\"\n\nFrom this, find out the PID of the process and then kill it with the following command.\n\nkill -9 <PID>\n\nIf ctrl + c doesn't work use this:\n\nctrl +shift+ c\n\nSometimes people change the behaviour of ctrl + c for copy/pasting so you may need this.\n\nOf course, you should also ensure that the terminal window has keyboard focus, ctrl + c won't work if your browser window has focus.\n\nCan use\n\nkillall -9\n\nThe killall command can be used to send a signal to a particular process by using its name. It means if you have five versions of the same program running, the killall command will kill all five.\n\nOr you can use\n\npgrep \"ng serve\"\n\nwhich will find the process id of ng and then you can use following command.\n\nkill -9 <process_id>\n\nWith Windows 10 / Powershell ctrl + c did not work; Powershell tried to gracefully stop the app.\n\nUsed normal cmd and had no issues stopping the ng serve with ctrl + c.\n\nit is enough to modify something in your text editor and reload localhost. all your connection will be lost nd you have opsibility to ng serve the new project in the console.\n\nI was trying to run this from within the Visual Studio 2017 Package Manager Console. None of the above suggestions worked.\n\nSee this link where Microsoft states \"The solution is not to use package manager for angular development, but instead use powershell command line. \"."
