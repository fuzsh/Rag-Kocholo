        "text": "I ntra party conflict is one of the features of party politics. This is not unconnected with the divergence nature of men that makes them to adopt different approaches in an attempt to achieve the same goal. Thus, though a political party is an assemblage of men with similar view on how best to run a state, the lack of homogeneity in their approach coupled with the series of activities that take place within the party predispose members to articulate divergent interests which sometimes breed intra party conflict leading to factionalization within such a party (Momodu and Matudi, 2013). It therefore follows that, as a social group, conflict is inevitable within a political party. This is more so giving the reality that whenever people come together to pursue a common goal, there is the tendency that some members would pursue their personal interests instead of group’s interest. Nevertheless, a political party should try to aggregate the varying interests of its members and articulate a unified front for achieving its goals. The pursuance of this goal would limit the destructive impact of intra party conflict in the polity. Intra party conflict is a recurrent phenomenon that finds expression in different forms and at different stages in the process of democratization. It is in this context that scholars are really interested in understanding the dynamics of intra party conflicts, particularly in developing democracies where the process of nurturing democratic ethos is very tardy. However, the dimension, multitude and impact of intra party conflict in Nigeria continue to be a worrisome phenomenon to the development of democracy. As Olaniyan (2009: 51) observed, “party politics has adorned the toga of notoriety in Nigeria to the extent that its defining characteristics have been intrigues, bickering, backbiting, schisms and violence”. An examination of the activities of political parties in Nigeria, right from the colonial period to the Fourth Republic, would reveal a disturbing varying degree of intra party crises. Most disturbingly is the experience of the Fourth Republic where party activities are “replete with so much intra-crisis that rather than furthering democratic ethos, have indeed become stumbling blocks to the attainment of stable democratic order” (Eme and Anyadike, 2011: 1). The question that is agitating the minds of analysts and scholars is why do political parties in Nigeria find it difficult to harmonize their divergent views? This chapter seeks to answer this question. Therefore, the chapter is divided into six parts. This section is the introduction. The second part presents a conceptual framework of analysis; the third historicizes intra party conflict in Nigeria; the fourth examines intra party conflicts in the Fourth Republic; the fifth discusses the implications of intra party conflict on democracy and democratization in Nigeria and the last part is conclusion.\n\nA political party is an organised group of people with a sui generis label and possibly an acronym that, primarily recruit, train and field candidates to be elected to vacant public offices by eligible electorates through the constitutional means of periodic election. As an agent of democracy, party ideology remains an essential feature. Reason being that a party's manifesto is drafted based on the adopted ideology which its candidates, if elected, would execute for the greater good of the country. In the Nigerian State, this has not always been the case from the colonial to the post-colonial era. Hence, this informative research paper examines critically the origin and proliferation of political parties in Nigeria from 1923 to 2018, studying closely the first generation political parties that began with a good ideological footing in the 20 th century to most of the 21 st century political parties in the country which are ideologically barren. Embedded in this study is an exposé on the incursion of the military in Nigeria's politics which curtailed the development of political parties and the consolidation of democracy in the country. A major finding of mine was that there is a protracted dearth of ideology in political parties as indicated by most parties' ideologically-unguided manifesto and the defection of their members to another party since the fourth republic began on the 29 th of May, 1999. For this research paper, the historical approach was adopted with the qualitative method of secondary data collection.\n\nSince the return of multi-party democratic governance in 1999, Nigeria has continued to grapple with the problem of national unity, such that she can be described as nation with tripod stand, made up of three blocks, the North, the West and the East that are in a perpetual state of wobble (Ogundiya, 2011). While inter-party conflicts are commonly inevitable in every democratic set up with political party formations, due either to different political ideologies and principles, numbers of such political parties and such relationships that exist within or between them, the functions that political parties play are very crucial in democratic sustenance (Tyoden, 2013). This paper closely portrays the struggles that are contained towards the interparty and conflict that influence the development of democracy in Nigeria since the dawn of the fourth republic in 1999 and hence suggests that, to promote democracy and its consolidation in Nigeria there must be peace and an atmosphere of tolerance, harmonious coexistence and mutual trust among political parties. Such factors as concentration of power at the centre, identity crisis, corruption, social and economic inequality, poverty and hunger, lack of party discipline and tolerance, lack of clear ideologies, money bag politics, use of unguarded and foul languages at campaign grounds, etc, should be a thing of the past if the Nigerian democracy will be stable and consolidated upon.\n\nContrary to the common assumption within the ‘parties-as-agents-of-democracy’ theory that several parties contest for power with more or less equal electoral chances, empirical evidence has shown that this is not always the case. Since multiparty elections do not automatically lead to competitive multiparty systems, as witnessed in several African countries where there have been a rise in the number of electorally dominant parties since the 1990s (Bogaards 2004:173), it is therefore apposite that adequate attention be given to the impacts of dominant parties and dominant party systems on democracy. Political parties exist to perform certain basic functions, which include the organisation of public opinion, the communication of people’s demands to the centre of governmental power, an articulation of the concept and meaning of the broader community to its followers and involvement in political recruitment (Oyediran 1999:142). Consequently, the coming together of three major opposition parties in 2013 signaled, for the first time, a predictable end of one-party dominant system in Nigeria. Although this was not the first time of an attempt at unifying and uniting major opposition parties against a ruling party, dynamics of post-merger success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has remained a true test for the popularity or otherwise of the hitherto dominant Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Unlike before now, the PDP no longer boasts the majority of the states. Similarly, unlike before now, the PDP now, arguably, has the minority membership in the House of Representatives while a likely fate is being prevented from happening in the Senate. It is argued in this chapter that given the waning level of the structural and agential forces and factors that have promoted one-party dominance in the last one and a half decade, a new beginning seems inevitable for a truly competitive multi-party democracy in Nigeria. This projection however hangs on a cautious optimism that the emerging opposition would stand the test of time. This contribution is broken into five sub-headings: introductory note, definitional understanding of parties and party systems, conceptual explanation of the one-party dominant system, empirical factors accounting for rise and fall of the one-party dominant system in Nigeria and the conclusion.\n\nThe central role played by political parties in the development and nurturing of a virile democracy and its consolidation cannot be overstated. Where democracy survives for a long period of time, it is because political parties, among other vital institutions, are well established, and have played the role expected of them. In Nigeria, the return to democracy since 1999 has ushered in a renewed process of democratization and, thus, heralded another opportunity for the country to launch a new strategy towards democracy, after many years of lost opportunities under a prolonged period of military authoritarian rule. This essay examines the nature and character of party politics in Nigeria and its impacts on democratic governance, essentially from historical perspective. It concludes that to advance the democratic project, the Nigerian public needs to gain confidence in its institutions. The public needs to feel that there are organs of the political system that can guarantee fairness and justice and that are not undermined by wealth through corruption. Common citizens must have recourse to democratic institutions in order to express demands and resolve conflicts."
