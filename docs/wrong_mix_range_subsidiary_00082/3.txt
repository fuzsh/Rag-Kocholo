Hi friends, Retirementâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been a ZIMMERBIOMET SALES ASSOCIATE for 40 years and itâ€™s time to put the laser pointer downðŸ˜ƒ.What a wonderful company to work for! I have absolutely loved selling. I have met incredibly smart salespeople and have learned a bunch. You medical sales people are a great group of people. Iâ€™m humbled to be in this space. Itâ€™s time to take a rest and then spend my time with my family. My wife of (48 years) is my rock, I plan on some great travels with her . I wish ALL of you the very best, may God bless you all! Ed
