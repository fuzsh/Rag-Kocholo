Download a free issue! kiplinger.com/go/freekip Dear Client: Washington, July 16, 2021 Joe Biden’s latest goal as president: Become a 21st-century trustbuster and boost competition in the U.S. economy. Much of Biden’s agenda is already clear: Stronger enforcement of antitrust laws, obviously, a goal he shares with the new head of the FTC…Federal Trade Comm…Lina Khan. Greater scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions could not only discourage future dealmaking (bringing MA activity down from record levels) but also result in past mergers being challenged. This worries many tech companies, especially those accused in the past of acquiring upstart companies before they can pose a threat. Think Facebook acquiring Instagram or Google buying YouTube. Knocking down barriers for workers who want to switch jobs or enter new industries. For example, Biden has proposed a ban or limits on noncompete agreements, in which an employee agrees not to start a competing business or work for a competitor for a specified period of time after their contract ends…a widespread practice. Also, protecting consumers and businesses by shifting control of their info to them and away from banks, Big Tech platforms, and others that now profit from it and occasionally abuse it. One example: Online marketplaces, such as Amazon, using the data of businesses that sell on their websites to launch competing products. Furthermore, Biden’s antitrust focus extends far beyond Silicon Valley, which has become a punching bag for both political parties in recent years. Bank mergers are set to face greater scrutiny, with the administration noting that Uncle Sam hasn’t blocked such a transaction in over 15 years. The White House has also taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and the tactics brand-name drugmakers use to stave off generic competition. Ditto, the meatpacking industry, where many processors have been accused of colluding to lower the prices they pay to both poultry and livestock farmers. Biden’s strategy is hardly a slam dunk. Federal agencies that are responsible for overseeing antitrust issues, such as the FTC, already lack the staff and resources to keep up with their current workloads. Many proposals could also face legal hurdles. Plus, tougher antitrust enforcement may have negative consequences, in some cases. Economic concentration has increased in three-quarters of industries in the U.S. At the same time, growing global competition also requires many firms to combine in order to survive, allowing them to take advantage of economies of scale. Still, such efforts reflect a new way of thinking in D.C. about antitrust law that will endure beyond Biden’s presidency and have a real impact on the economy. 1100 13th Street NW, Washington, DC 20005 • kiplinger.com • Vol. 98, No. 28 U.S. average: 9 1 to 2 Maine, Md., Mich., N.H., Pa., S.D., Vt. 3 to 4 Conn., Del., D.C., Iowa, Mass., Minn., Neb., N.J., N.Y., N.D., Ohio, R.I., Va., W.Va., Wis. 5 to 6 Hawaii, Ill., Ind., Mont., N.M., Ore. 7 to 8 Calif., Ga., Idaho, N.C., S.C., Tenn., Wash. 9+ Kan., Ky., Texas (9), Colo.

UPDATE After our September issue went to press, the IRS announced that non-spouse heirs who inherited a traditional IRA in 2020 or later will not be penalized if they forgo a 2023 required minimum distribution (“An Inheritance With Strings Attached,” Sept.). For more, see page 17. Gas Cars vs. Electric Cars I can appreciate the gas-powered vehicle reviews in “The Non-EV Buyer's Guide” (Aug.). However, to those who say EVs have an unfair advantage because own- ers don’t pay gas taxes: Localities are exploring a tax on EV regis- tration or a mileage tax fairly ap- plied to all vehicles. Some people are concerned about the effects of EVs on the power grid, but our interconnected power grid is al- ready perilously strained. Renew- able energy can help contribute to clean power generation by em- ploying smaller, regional power micro-grids that are less suscep- tible to weather and mass failure. Craig Lazinsky, Derry, N.H. I was thrilled to learn that the final Ford Mustang with an in- ternal combustion engine could still be as many as five years away. I’m 70, and as long as my knees and hips allow, I expect another gas-powered Mustang to be my last, best car. Tom Ward, Cumberland, R.I. One thing your article doesn’t men- tion is that residents in the city of Co- lumbus, Ohio, with earned income have to pay a city income tax of 2.5%. This is in addition to other federal and state taxes on wages. H.W., Flushing, Mich. Editor’s note: The Columbus city in- come tax doesn’t apply to retirement income, but it does affect wages of retirees who work part-time. PERSONAL FINANCE IN SCHOOLS High school students need to learn about finances (“An Advocate for Financial Literacy,” Aug.). As a high school senior in 1961, I took a class called Problems of Daily Living. We learned about managing finances, dating, budgeting, renting an apart- ment and acquiring transportation. For Maryland students, it was re- quired, and it benefited me greatly. Robert Hoenes, Marietta, Ga. TOP BANKS The only banks in “The Best Bank for You” (Aug.) that come close to meet- ing my definition of offering good in- terest rates on savings are Discover Bank and TIAA Bank. Two credit unions worth mentioning are Lafay- ette Federal Credit Union and Quo- rum Federal Credit Union. Andy Hanna, Sunland, Calif. We traded one of our three gas- powered cars for a used 2022 Kia Niro EV, and we are pleased. Electricity costs us about 4.1 cents per mile (roughly equivalent to 85 miles per gallon based on a fuel price of $3.50 per gallon), and we can do a day trip to the nearest larger city without need- ing a charge in the middle. When we replace one of our other cars, we plan to buy a plug-in hybrid, allowing us to use electricity alone for driving around town but providing gas-powered capa- bilities for longer trips. Thomas Vaughn, Lafayette, Ind. center, museums, educational oppor- tunities and college sporting events. We’re also very proud of our region’s diversity, quality health care facili- ties, and green spaces and trails—and proud that we house our state’s capi- tal. All this with a cost of living lower than other cities you listed. Dennis Denno and Raina Korbakis, East Lansing, Mich.\n\n9. 6 Kiplinger Personal Finance LISA GERSTNER, EDITOR LISA_GERSTNER@KIPLINGER.COM harder to stash away money for the future, and 62% of respondents to a recent Schwab survey of 401(k) par- ticipants said that inflation is present- ing obstacles to saving for a comfort- able retirement. Inflation concerns hit those who are already retired, too. As editor at large Janet Bodnar points out in her column on page 59, retiree confidence in having enough money to live comfortably through retire- ment is down significantly. Similar worries are common even among those who are reasonably well prepared for retirement. To go from collecting a paycheck to relying on investments and other sources of in- come is a significant leap mentally, and concerns about running out of money can cause workers to miss out on what could be some of their most enjoyable retirement years by unnec- essarily delaying the transition. In our cover story this month, which starts on page 50, senior editor San- dra Block walks readers through the steps to retiring without fear. As with just about any other aspect of managing your personal finances, preparation is key to keeping finan- cial worries at bay. If you feel that your savings are falling short—or you want assurance that your retirement stash will stack up—monitoring your cash flow can give you a better sense of control. Enlisting a financial plan- ner who can take a holistic look at your spending and saving patterns can be a helpful exercise, too. You can search for a fee-only, fiduciary planner at www.napfa.org. A different kind of financial anxi- ety. In the early days of the COVID- 19 pandemic, many customers were extra generous to service workers by leaving tips in instances where they normally weren’t expected—when picking up restaurant takeout orders, for example. In the years since, tip jars and digital prompts for tips on checkout screens have popped up at a range of businesses—and that has left many customers scratching their heads as to whether they are expected to tip, and if so, what the appropriate amount is. If you find yourself in that boat, read “To Tip or Not to Tip?” on page 46, which provides guidelines on setting a tipping strategy. ALLOWEEN is just around the corner, and despite its spooky theme, the festivities that come along with it—carving jack-o’-lanterns, donning costumes, handing out candy (or, in my case, eating a cut of the treats that my kids collect)—are usually more fun than scary. What’s far more frightening for many Americans is the prospect of not having enough money for the future. In the most recent Chapman University Survey of American Fears, 54% of respondents shared that fear, and the same percentage were afraid of economic or financial collapse. Those two fears tied as the seventh most common. (Number one? Cor- rupt government officials.) Such worries often translate into stress. A spring survey from CNBC found that 70% of Americans felt stressed about their personal fi- nances. And having a decent income doesn’t provide immunity—57% of those earning $100,000 or more felt stressed. Inflation was the top con- tributor to financial stress. Although inflation is slowing down, consumers are still feeling the effects of the substantial price increases that started a couple of years ago. (And while lower inflation is desirable in many ways, it means that retirees can expect a smaller cost-of-living in- crease in their Social Security bene- fits next year—for more, see page 9.)

October 2023 9 T HE decline in the inflation rate is welcome news for anyone who needs to pay for groceries, gas or rent. But if you’re retired, you may be disap- pointed to learn how this devel- opment could affect your Social Security benefits. The Kiplinger Letter forecasts that Social Security beneficiaries will re- ceive a cost-of-living increase of 3% for 2024, down from 8.7% in 2023 and 5.9% in 2022. A 3% cost-of-living adjustment will increase the average monthly benefit for retirees to about $1,892, up from $1,837. THE DOWNSIDE TO DECLINING INFLATION After two years of big cost-of-living increases, retirees will likely receive a more modest Social Security raise in 2024. BY SANDRA BLOCK The forecast is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which rose at a 12-month rate of 3% in June, down from 4% in May and 4.9% in April. The 2024 cost-of-living adjustment is based on the CPI-W in the third quarter ILLUSTRATION BY JOHN TOMAC\n\n13. 10 Kiplinger Personal Finance received only a 0.3% increase in 2017 (see the box below.) Still, the more modest cost-of-living adjust- ment will likely renew concerns among some advocates for seniors that the annual increase doesn’t reflect retirees’ actual costs, espe- cially because health care expenses tend to rise faster than overall in- flation. Seniors who rent are also vulnerable, Johnson says. Rents have started to flatten, but average rents were still up more than 8% in June from a year earlier, and rents have risen even more in some high- cost areas, she notes. Now for the good news. Though con- sumer costs have been declining, the Federal Reserve has signaled it’s not ready to shelve its inflation-fighting arsenal. At its meeting in July, the Fed increased short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point to the highest level in 22 years. In comments after the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it’s too soon to determine whether the Fed is done hiking interest rates and that it will make that decision based on how the economy performs in the coming months. For retirees and others who have funds in low-risk investments, there’s an upside to the Fed’s decision to keep in- terest rates elevated. After years of paying little more than air on low-risk accounts, financial institutions are paying interest of about 5% on money market accounts and high-yield online savings accounts. The Fed isn’t ex- pected to cut rates this year, so you should be able to earn Ahead of 2023, so if inflation rises before October, the COLA will be adjusted upward. While the forecast gives retirees a preview of what could happen to their benefits next year, they won’t get the total picture until this fall, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announces Medicare Part B premiums for 2024. Most retirees have their Part B pre- miums automatically deducted from their Social Security payments, so a big increase in premiums can sig- nificantly dampen any cost-of-living increase. That tends to hit people with the lowest Social Security ben- efits the hardest, says Mary John- son, policy analyst for the Senior Citizens League. In its annual report released in March, Medicare’s board of trustees predicted that standard Medicare Part B premiums will increase about 6% in 2024, to $174.80 a month, up from $164.90 in 2023. But recent de- velopments could increase the pre- mium cost, Johnson says. Medicare recently announced plans to cover the medication Lecanemab (brand name Leqembi) for eligible Alzheimer’s patients, which has an estimated cost of $26,500 per year. The Senior Citizens League estimates the cost of administering the drug and mon- itoring it for side effects will increase overall Part B premi- ums by $5 a month. At 3%, the 2024 COLA would still be an increase over the average COLA before the pandemic ignited the inflation rate. In 2016, for example, seniors received no increase in their benefits, and they these rates for a few more months. But if inflation begins to decline in 2024, the Fed will likely cut rates, says Ken Tumin, senior industry an- alyst at LendingTree. And when the Fed cuts rates, banks typically are quick to lower rates on their savings accounts, which means it’s not too soon to start looking at ways to lock in rates on your savings. Certificates of deposit are federally insured for up to $250,000 per de- positor, per institution, and provide a way to lock in an interest rate for three months to five years or more. They typically pay more than bank savings accounts, but in exchange for that premium, you pay a penalty if you withdraw money before the CD matures. (For information on CDs for retirement savers, see “Are IRA CDs Right for You?” on page 48.) Ordinarily, longer-term CDs pay a higher rate than their lower-term counterparts, which makes sense be- cause you’re locking up your money for a longer period. But these aren’t ordinary times. Recently, top-yield- ing one-year CDs paid interest of up to 5.6%, compared with 4.7% for a top-yielding five-year CD. Still, if you think interest rates will fall— and you don’t need the money in the near future—you may prefer the certainty of a five-year CD. One strategy that lets you have it both ways is to invest in a series of CDs of different maturities, known as laddering. For example, you could spread your savings among CDs that mature in one, two, three, four and five years. When your first CD ma- tures, you can cash it out or reinvest it in a new three- or five-year CD and do the same with subsequent CDs. In the current environment, you’ll capture the higher rates shorter-term CDs are paying, but if rates decline, you’ll still have some of your funds locked up in higher-paying CDs. “One nice thing about a ladder is that you don’t have to guess where inter- est rates are going,” Tumin says.

Never give one of these programs your personal informa- tion, such as your Social Security number, date of birth, mother’s maiden name or even your work history. If you provide this kind of information to ChatGPT and ask it to write you a résumé, for example, you never know where the informa- tion will go or whether it’s going to be used for a nefarious purpose.

Social Security numbers were created to record wages and earnings for the IRS and to determine eligibility for govern- ment benefits. Somewhere along the line, people started using them to establish an individual’s identity, and it has proliferated. If the entity ask- ing for your Social Security number isn’t a financial institution, govern- ment agency or employer, you should ask why they need it, what they are going to do with it, how long they’re going to store it and whether they share it with any third parties. If they’re using your Social Security number for identity verification only, you should ask whether there’s an- other way to establish your identity.

Ahead R ETIREMENT may rep- resent a fresh episode of your life, but a surpris- ing twist might be a drop in your credit score. Even if borrowing isn’t on your agenda, your credit score could affect other aspects of your life, ranging from how much you pay for auto insurance to whether you’ll be admitted to an assisted-living facility. Average credit scores tend to increase as consumers get older, peaking in their seventies (see the box on the facing page). To understand why your own credit score might drop after you retire, it’s important to know how credit scores are computed. While your history of paying on time is the largest element of your score, other factors in- clude the amount you owe on your credit cards as a proportion of your card limits (known as your credit-utilization ratio) and the length of your credit history, says Ted Rossman, senior indus- try analyst at Bankrate.com. In addition, if you don’t use a credit card, the issuer may close it be- cause of inactivity. “Retirees’ credit scores often go down be- cause they’re not using credit as actively as when they were younger,” he says. Polish your credit. To keep your score in good shape, use a credit card to make small, regular purchases. This approach will ensure that your credit card re- mains active and contributes positively to your credit score, Rossman says. Diligently pay the bills on time because that’s the most power- ful weapon in your credit score arsenal. On-time payments demonstrate financial responsi- bility and reliability, which are highly regarded by credit scor- ing models. Think twice before closing old or unused credit card accounts. While this may seem like a tidy financial move, it can lead to reduced available credit and an How Retirement Could Hurt Your Credit Score Just as you need to take care of your physical health, you need to monitor your credit fitness.

In June 2023, airfares had dropped by 8.1% from May and by 18.9% over the previous 12 months, accord- ing to the June Consumer Price Index report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Booming supply and changing demand are the two key drivers of the decrease, says Scott Keyes, founder of Going, a web- site that provides airfare alerts and information. “While 2022 was characterized by pilot and plane shortages, airlines have been making steady progress on both fronts this year. More capacity is getting added to the flight system every month, and because aircraft have gotten significantly larger on average over the past decade, the number of available seats is already higher today than pre-pandemic,” says Keyes. And passengers are less willing to pay inflated ticket prices than they were in the summer of 2022, when many of them were embarking on their first trip in years following the pandemic. International travel is another story. Over the summer, the aver- age airfare to Europe was nearly $1,200 per ticket—the highest price in the past six years, ac- cording to travel-booking site Hopper. Flights to Asia had an average ticket price of more than $1,800. To save money, Hopper advises flying midweek, vacationing in the fall shoulder season, and traveling to more off-the-beaten path destinations, such as Reykjavik or Dublin. Planning holiday travel. It’s likely that domestic airfares will continue to sink through the rest of 2023, says Keyes. But prices still tend to run higher in peak holiday periods. To watch for low fares, you can en- ter your itinerary at sites such as Google.com/flights and Kayak.com and receive e-mail alerts when prices drop. You may be able to get the best fares for flights near Thanksgiving and Christmas by booking them early in the fall. If your plans change, you can rest easy knowing that the major U.S. airlines no longer charge ticket-change fees for most fare classes, although you may be charged for same-day requests and some international flights. (Basic economy tickets are typically not refundable or changeable.) LISA GERSTNER AIRLINE TICKET PRICES ARE COMING BACK TO EARTH\n\n20.

This makes many homeowners FROM THE KIPLINGER LETTER A Tight Supply for Home Buyers ʾ Some adult children, grand- children and other non-spouse heirs who inherited a traditional IRA will have more time to take required distributions. A 2019 law requires non- spouse heirs who inherited a traditional IRA in 2020 or later to deplete the account within 10 years after the death of the original owner. Financial planners initially thought non-spouse heirs could wait until year 10 to drain their accounts. However, in early 2022, the IRS released guidance stating that if the original IRA owner died on or after the date he or she was required to take minimum distributions, non- spouse heirs must take RMDs based on their life expectancy in years one through nine and deplete the balance in year 10. Because this guidance created Inherited IRA Relief The average salary increase that organi- zations are budgeting for workers in 2024, according to a survey from benefits con- sultant WTW. That’s lower than the actual 4.4% average salary increase for 2023. 4% ʺ The U.S. Treasury became a little less creditworthy in August after Fitch Ratings cut its rating on U.S. government debt a notch from the top triple-A rating to AA+. Stocks swooned briefly following the news, but Treasury yields moved little, and most experts did not adjust promising outlooks for U.S. financial markets. Fitch cited a high and growing debt burden for the U.S. government and said in its announcement that “re- peated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal manage- ment.” Limited progress in tackling the challenges of rising Social Secu- rity and Medicare costs was another consideration, according to the rating agency. Standard Poor’s marked down U.S. debt slightly (for similar reasons) in August 2011. Stocks were already in a pullback and fell further after the downgrade, but later rallied to finish the year flat. There was no wholesale dumping of U.S. Treasuries. “We continue to advise investors to buy quality bonds, including U.S. government bonds,” said UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Solita Marcelli. A stock market breather would not be surprising after a strong couple of months, said strategists at CFRA Research. Still, CFRA’s 12-month target of 4820 for the SP 500 implies a 5% gain from its July 31 close. ANNE KATES SMITH U.S. Credit Rating Gets a Downgrade confusion, the IRS waived penal- ties for RMDs that should have been taken in tax years 2021 and 2022. That relief was expected to end this year, as we stated in our September article “An Inheri- tance With Strings Attached.” But in mid July—after our September issue went to press—the IRS said it will waive penalties for heirs who forgo a distribution in 2023. Although this guidance allows non-spouse heirs to delay taking distributions, they’ll still be re- quired to empty their accounts within 10 years of the original owner’s death. Financial plan- ners say non-spouse heirs who inherited an IRA after 2019 may want to withdraw just enough each year to remain within their tax bracket to avoid a distribution that could trigger a large tax bill. SANDRA BLOCK reluctant to sell and give up their low interest rates. Mortgage rates will likely fall below 6% by year-end, driven by a drop in the yield of the 10- year Treasury note and declin- ing spreads between Treasuries and what lenders charge on home loans. That should lead to slightly better affordability for buyers and a pickup in selling.\n\n21. 18 Kiplinger Personal Finance INVESTING\n\n22. October 2023 19 NVESTING has become more accessible to more people, but that hasn’t made finding the right broker any easier. If anything, brokerage firms look more alike. Low commissions, for instance, are no longer a differen- tiator—all firms have low costs now. Figuring out which broker is right for you depends on what you need and what you value. You may want a broker that has an array of no- transaction-fee mutual funds at the ready. Maybe you need technical reports on stocks or charting tools that let you slice and dice a stock’s moves. If you’re just getting started, you may want the ability to invest in partial shares of stocks. Or if you don’t know much about investing, a firm with a good robo adviser may suit you best. To help you choose, we rounded up data from 10 brokers who agreed to participate in our annual survey. Every year we invite a number of firms, but to be included, a broker must offer online trading in stocks, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and individual bonds. Half of this year’s participants are well known: E*Trade, Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Three are online brokers with affiliated banks: J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing (Chase Bank), WellsTrade (Wells Fargo) and Ally Invest (the online-only Ally Bank). The remaining two, Firstrade and Interactive Brokers, focus more on trading and are popular with ac- tive investors. Siebert didn’t respond to our invitations; T. Rowe Price and Vanguard declined to participate. Each participant answered dozens of questions in seven categories: commissions and fees; investment choices; smartphone app; tools; HOW THE ONLINE BROKERS STACK UP We compared investment offerings, tools, apps, advice and more to find the best broker for you. BY NELLIE S. HUANG\n\n23. 20 Kiplinger Personal Finance INVESTMENT CHOICES More is definitely more in this cate- gory, which accounted for 20% of the final score. We asked the firms to pony up information on the breadth of investments they offer, including individual corporate and municipal bonds; how many mutual funds cus- tomers can buy without a transac- tion fee; and whether the firms offer fractional-share purchases of stocks and ETFs. Because interest rates are higher this year, we also asked about the income you can earn on cash. In- teractive Brokers won the top spot overall in this category, but Fidelity and E*Trade weren’t far behind. Interactive Brokers offers access to markets in the U.S. and 150 devel- oped and emerging countries. Cus- tomers can choose among 4,610 U.S. mutual funds and pay no trans- action fee. (Schwab comes close to that, with 4,406; E*Trade offers 4,278.) But Interactive’s fractional- share trading in stocks and ETFs stood out. The firm lets its customers buy fractional shares in thousands of stocks and 3,125 ETFs for as little as $1. (Fidelity offers similar access to fractional stock and ETF shares.) Interactive also offers the ability to set up recurring stock and ETF trades—much like regular 401(k) contributions. Fidelity’s sweep accounts (where uninvested cash sits) shone. Among the firms surveyed, the average sweep account interest rate was be- low 1.0% as of the end of May. Low rates from J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing and Merrill Edge (both pay 0.01%) and WellsTrade (0.15% for balances under $1,000,000), among others, were a drag on the average. But at Fidelity, the default sweep account paid 4.75%. Highlights at E*Trade include a gigantic menu of bond choices.

GETTY IMAGES research; advisory services; and user experience. The user experience cat- egory measures how well a company interacts with customers, including via its website or mobile app. Scores in each category depend on informa- tion provided to us by the brokerages, vetted to the best of our abilities. This is a year of transition for some of the firms in our survey. Schwab and TD Ameritrade com- pleted their merger in 2020, but the process of combining their operations continues. By the end of the year, the vast majority of TD Ameritrade customers should be transitioned to Schwab. But because that process was incomplete at press time, the firms asked to be reviewed separately, except in the category of advisory services. E*Trade is also nearing the end of its operational merger with Morgan Stanley, but for the most part this did not impact its responses to our broker survey. And the winner is… Fidelity came out on top in three categories— smartphone app, advisory services and fees—but it won second or third place in every other measure except user experience. E*Trade was an impressive second-place finisher. Though that is a step down from its first-place finish overall last year, E*Trade topped the charts in re- search and finished strongly in the investment choices, smartphone app, user experience and fees categories. Schwab came next, followed by Inter- active Brokers and Merrill duking it out for fourth and fifth (the two firms’ final scores differed by 0.1 point). Below, we provide highlights and lowlights for each category. To see how each firm ranks in individual categories, see the table on page 24. ʾ Fidelity came out on top in three categories: smartphone app, advisory services and fees.\n\n24. October 2023 21 cipal securities on offer. E*Trade customers can also sign up for its automatic investing program for frac- tional purchases of 100 ETFs; the minimum recurring purchase is $25. Firstrade doesn’t offer partial- share trading or money market funds, which hurt its score this year because those criteria were heavily weighted. And its sweep account pays 0.45% in interest—not the low- est of the group, but below average. TOOLS Calculators, charts and screens can make investing easier, more accessi- ble and fun. They don’t have to be graphically snazzy, but they do have to be informative. In this category, which accounted for 20% of the final score, Schwab and Merrill Edge ranked best. Fidelity came in third. Schwab’s breadth of offerings stood out. Schwab checked off nearly every box for the 30-odd questions in this category, from a risk-tolerance ques- tionnaire to a monthly budgeting tool, a calculator for required minimum distributions and a tool to help build a ladder of certificates of deposit. Merrill Edge and Fidelity offer hearty tools for screening ETFs, bonds, mutual funds and stocks. They each have crafted predefined screens for all of these securities, too, which makes it easier for inves- tors who don’t know which criteria to choose among the hundreds avail- able. But, as in years past, Merrill Edge got extra credit for its Idea Builder tool, which helps investors winnow investment ideas for stocks (and sometimes funds and ETFs). The laggards in this category were Firstrade, Ally Invest and Interac- tive Brokers. To be fair, Firstrade and Interactive Brokers have robust active-trader platforms, which we didn’t include in our survey, that are packed with tools. But their main website offerings are more spare. Ally Invest caters more to novice investors. Its stock, ETF and bond screeners aren’t as hardy as the Investing We keep an eye on smaller brokerage firms, in part because they’re shaking up the industry. If not for Robinhood, for instance, we might still be paying commissions on stock and ETF trades. This year, we looked at Betterment, M1 Finance, Robinhood, SoFi and tastyworks. All are digital- only, with no brick-and- mortar branches. Two of them have amassed bil- lions in assets already (the others wouldn’t say). We homed in on investment offerings, mobile apps and tools. Here’s how they stack up in each category. ʾInvestment choices. Overall, SoFi and Robin- hood stood out in this cat- egory, but it was a close race. None of these firms offers mutual funds or bonds, but most allow you to buy fractional shares of stocks and ETFs. Better- ment is an outlier: It’s a robo adviser, and it doesn’t offer the option to buy in- dividual stocks or ETFs. All five firms offer cryp- tocurrency trading, but SoFi provides access to more than 20 digital cur- rencies, including Bitcoin and Avalanche, and Robin- hood has 15 on its roster. The pickings at tastyworks (eight) and M1 Finance (six) were slimmer. (A handful of the big brokerage firms in the main survey offer access to cryptocurrency, but we didn’t give this much weight in the invest- ment choices category.) Only one firm, Robinhood, offers a sweep account for uninvested cash to earn interest (as much as 4.65% for premium Gold customers; 1.5% for non- Gold customers). ʾSmartphone app. Rob- inhood and tastyworks sparkled in this category, in part because of their apps’ bells and whistles, such as education on in- vesting and trading strate- gies, as well as the ability to download account state- ments. If you are looking for investing functionality, however, M1 Finance and tastyworks win. Both apps offer screeners for ETFs and stocks (Robinhood’s app has a stock screener but no ETF screener). At Betterment, you can’t trade stocks or ETFs. ʾTools. You won’t find the panoply of tools that bigger brokerage firms have, but certain firms stood out in small ways. At M1 Finance, there’s a mock portfolio tool that allows you to see past performance. Robinhood and SoFi offer lists of stocks in certain thematic investment categories, which investors can use as a starting point for more research. And M1 Finance, Robinhood and tastyworks have a ques- tionnaire that can help investors pin down their tolerance for risk. Perfor- mance in this category was a mixed bag. Tasty- works won, Robinhood and M1 Finance were tied, and Betterment was the laggard. Its only tools are a retirement “How am I doing” tool and a risk- tolerance questionnaire.

And it doesn’t have a mutual fund screener, bond lad- dering tool or retirement account calculator for required minimum distributions, for instance, which are de rigueur at outfits such as Schwab, E*Trade and Fidelity. SMARTPHONE APP According to some firms, brokerage customers check their accounts on a mobile app as often as they do on a computer. But can you do every- thing on your smartphone that you can do on a computer? For instance, can you pay bills? Not at Interactive Brokers, Firstrade or J.P. Morgan, among others. Can you track your spending? Only at Fi- delity, Merrill Edge and J.P. Morgan. Trade stocks and mutual funds? Not at Ally or Firstrade, and only on an Android phone at TD Ameritrade. We asked each firm about whether those transactions and dozens more could be done within their app. The firms that offered the most function- ality fared well in this category, which accounted for 20% of the final score. Fidelity, Interactive Brokers and E*Trade earned the top marks. A couple of differentiators: Fidelity customers can buy and sell CDs on its app. No other firm we surveyed offers this. And anyone looking to trade bonds using their smartphone app will be disappointed unless they have an Interactive Brokers account. We gave extra points to apps with nimble portfolio-performance reporting—whether each account in- dividually and in the aggregate could be compared with a broad-market benchmark. Only E*Trade, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, Merrill Edge and TD Ameritrade measured up. Schwab lost points in comparison with its peers because it doesn’t have screeners for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds or bonds within its smart- phone app (unlike Ally, E*Trade Interactive and J.P. Morgan). RESEARCH Having access to high-quality re- search can help investors make in- formed decisions. We tried to figure out how much accessible research was available to investors at each firm—from in-depth reports by ana- lysts who pore over balance sheets and income statements and talk with company executives to easy-to- decipher technical and quantitative research. This category accounted for 15% of the final grade. E*Trade’s merger with Morgan Stanley helped E*Trade rise to the top of this category. Customers have easy access to any research report from the investment bank, from top- ics such as why India is booming to whether Apple’s revenues are on the rise in emerging markets. You’ll also get a current take on the market from Morgan Stanley’s lead stock strategists and other “thought lead- ers,” says an E*Trade spokesperson. Schwab took second place here. A quick search for info on several stocks, including Apple, Goldman Sachs and Honeywell, turned up a number of detailed reports from analysts at Argus Research, CFRA Research, Morningstar, Thomson Reuters and MSCI, among others. Firstrade didn’t make the grade in this category relative to the other firms, however. Its customers have access to Morningstar’s thorough analysis for stocks and funds, but that was the only fundamental research available. And it doesn’t offer any help with ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) research. As a subsidiary of Bank of America, Merrill Edge can offer its customers access to high-quality research from BofA Global Research, which gives the firm an advantage over all the other firms but E*Trade. But only certain customers get the reports. “Edge clients need to meet certain relationship qualifiers” to see the research, says a spokesperson. For instance, you qualify if you have at least $100,000 in eligible accounts and are enrolled in the bank’s Pre- ferred Rewards program (which is available to select banking custom- ers with at least $20,000 in an eligi- ble Bank of America account). ADVISORY SERVICES In recent years, demand for invest- ment advice—from the all-digital kind to the old-school, dedicated- adviser kind—has climbed.

Firstrade doesn’t offer any advisory services, so it came in last. This category accounted for 10% of the final score. Robo-advisory services made up the biggest chunk of this category’s score. All firms offer one (except the aforementioned Firstrade), which we define as a service offering auto- mated investment plans that use algorithms to create and manage a diversified portfolio—typically made up of exchange-traded funds— appropriate for your time horizon and tolerance for risk. Half the firms, including E*Trade, Fidelity, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Edge and Schwab, have an enhanced tier of service that allows customers to talk to a human being if necessary—in many cases, a certified financial planner. And all but Firstrade and Interactive offer more-personalized, hands-on advice from a dedicated expert. This level of advice requires higher stakes— between $100,000 and $1 million in investments, depending on the firm— and typically involves a portfolio that holds individual stocks, bonds (in- cluding municipal bonds) and real estate investment trusts. We awarded extra points to firms with these types of enhanced advisory services. Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameri- trade won the day in this category. The robo-advisory offerings from the two firms were standouts. Fidel- ity’s automated investing offering, Fidelity Go, has a $10 minimum to get started, the lowest of the group, and an advisory fee of zero for accounts with less than $25,000 in assets (it charges 0.35% a year for accounts with more than $25,000). Schwab’s robo product, Intelligent Portfolios, is free of annual advisory fees, too, but the minimum is a heftier $5,000. Fidelity’s armada of advisory ser- vices for clients with heftier assets lifted its score in this category, too. Schwab and TD Ameritrade’s wealth advisory offerings (reviewed in com- bination) are equally robust. But the combined firm lost a little ground to Fidelity because its minimum re- quired to have a dedicated adviser, $1 million, is considerably beefier than Fidelity’s minimum, $250,000.

This year, investment choices, tools and smartphone app received the greatest weight, 20% each. Research accounted for 15% of the final score, advisory services and user experience, 10%, and fees, 5%. THE RANKINGS *Schwab and TD Ameritrade were reviewed as one offering in the advisory services category.\n\n28. October 2023 25 Fidelity had an edge, too, thanks to its direct indexing product, a managed account that seeks to repli- cate a stock index by holding indi- vidual stocks, while taking advan- tage of tax-loss harvesting (which involves selling a security at a net loss to reduce or offset capital gains taxes owed from selling profitable investments). Fidelity’s Managed FidFolios has a low, $5,000 mini- mum and charges 0.40% or 0.70% a year, depending on the strategy se- lected. E*Trade, Interactive Brokers and Schwab have direct indexing programs, too, but you must work with an adviser to access them. Interactive Brokers’ robo-advisory service is different from that of the other firms. Rather than a traditional automated investment plan geared to your age and risk tolerance, it offers access to more than 70 digitally managed portfolios, run by outside investment firms and financial com- panies, that invest in either ETFs or a mix of stocks and bonds. Many invest with a theme—ESG Growth or Technology, for example. Others focus on an asset class—Global or Small Cap Broad Market, to name two. These portfolios vary by invest- ment minimum—most require $100, though a few require upward of $10,000—and by annual fees, which range between 0.08% and 0.75%. USER EXPERIENCE How easy is it to get help—by phone, online chat or e-mail—when you need it? Is the website easy to navi- gate? Can you readily find a stock re- search report on the mobile app? Is it easy to figure out how to update your beneficiaries on the website? These are some of the functions we assessed in this category, which accounted for 10% of the final score. Merrill Edge emerged victorious. But J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing, another top finisher in this category, performed best in our tests to measure ease of use for each of the firms’ mobile apps and their dot-com websites. (E*Trade came in second on those particular assessments, but fourth overall in the category.) The test- runs accounted for nearly two-thirds of the overall user-experience score. Merrill Edge’s platforms per- formed above average on our test- runs. But the firm got a leg up for other criteria, including its 3,900 U.S. brick-and-mortar branches (only J.P. Morgan, with 4,700, has more); Merrill Edge’s affiliation with Bank of America helped. Merrill also reported the fastest stock-trade exe- cution speed of all the firms—0.006 second—well above the average of 0.08 second for the group. It won points, too, for having a live person on its chat service online. Schwab and Interactive Brokers also have a live person responding to instant- message queries on their websites. Ally and Interactive Brokers lagged in this category, in part because nei- ther firm did well in our test-drive of its website and mobile app. Ally’s website is neat and uncluttered, but it’s not as easy to navigate as the sites of some of the other firms we sur- veyed. And its CD screener, we found, was not very intuitive. (Ally suffered, too, because it’s an online-only busi- ness—it doesn’t have any branches.) As for Interactive, its smartphone app has impressive functionality, but first-timers may find it difficult to navigate. To be fair, a chunk of Inter- active’s clients opt to download the firm’s desktop platform, Trader Workstation, aimed at active traders. We didn’t review active-trader desk- top applications, which must be downloaded onto your computer. FEES The competition to charge the low- est fees is so fierce among brokers that the scores in this category var- ied by thin margins. We awarded points to firms with the lowest price to trade options, send a wire, buy on margin and get a broker to help with a stock trade, among other things. Fidelity and J.P. Morgan Self-Di- rected came out on top—the differ- ence in their scores was 0.02 point. Close behind J.P. Morgan were Merrill Edge (by 0.52 point) and E*Trade (by 0.55 point). This is why, though low fees matter, the category counts for just 5% of the final score. Firms that lagged got tripped up on whether there was a fee to buy Investing ʾ E*Trade has an enhanced tier of service that allows customers to talk to a human being if necessary—in many cases, a certified financial planner. GETTY IMAGES\n\n29. 26 Kiplinger Personal Finance ʾBest robo. If you’re just starting out and want a modicum of help with in- vestment advice, consider Fidelity Go. It has a low, $10 minimum to get started and zero annual fees for balances below $25,000 in assets. (For accounts with $25,000 or more in assets, it charges 0.35% a year.) Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolios gets a nod, too, because the annual fee is $0 no matter how big the balance, but it requires $5,000 to get started. ʾBest for bond inves- tors. E*Trade's platform has the biggest roster of unique issues for secondary-market cor- porate debt and muni- cipal bonds—more than 100,000 each, which in some cases beats its peers by nearly twofold. E*Trade also has tools to help you build a ladder of bonds or certificates of deposit (a ladder is a portfolio of investments that mature on different dates). Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade also offer tools that help build bond and CD ladders. ʾBest for investors who want access to initial public offerings. Based on past offerings, the best choice is Fidelity, which provided its cus- tomers access to 22 new offerings between the start of 2022 and May 2023; E*Trade came in second, with 11. ʾBest for high-quality research and market commentary. E*Trade customers get unfettered access to Morgan Stanley reports. If you’re reading a recent report on, say, Apple and it cites a previ- ous report—whether it was specifically about the company or why growth in India might fuel revenue gains at Apple—you can click on an embedded link and the report will pop open for you to read. ʾ Best for options trad- ers. Firstrade doesn't charge to trade options contracts. Every other broker has a fee. ʾBest for customers who want a bank-broker- age relationship. Con- necting your bank to your brokerage firm is easy—all brokers allow you to set up an ACH or electronic funds transfer with an ex- ternal bank, most of them with just a few clicks on- line. But it’s another thing to have your banking and brokerage relationship at one firm. At Merrill Edge, if you have a Bank of America account, you can transfer funds instantly between your bank and investment accounts. The higher your combined average daily balance between the two firms, the bigger the perks, too. This includes discounts on annual fees for Merrill Edge’s robo adviser (called Merrill Guided Investing), no fees on certain banking services, and an interest- rate boost on a Bank of America Advantage sav- ings account. ʾBest for investing newbies. Fidelity wins for its robust fractional- share trading. Customers can buy and sell partial shares of nearly all U.S. exchange-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds for as little as $1 per trade. Interactive Brokers comes next, but its website and mobile app aren’t especially friendly for beginners. Schwab offers fractional- share stock trading on any SP 500 member for as little as $5 per trade, but no partial ETF shares are available. and sell U.S. Treasury securities (yes at Ally, Firstrade and Interactive; no everywhere else). Another differen- tiator was payment for order flow. Payment for order flow can pose a conflict of interest because it means brokers are compensated for funnel- ing trades to certain firms, called market makers, to fill orders. Fidel- ity, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Edge and WellsTrade don’t accept payment for order flow; the others do. Interactive Brokers got half credit here. Trades on its Pro platform, where customers fork over a small commission for stock trades but pay lower interest rates to trade on margin, don’t accept payment for order flow. But trades on the firm’s Lite platform do. A couple of developments are worth noting. E*Trade eliminated commissions and transaction fees on mutual funds; it even waives the front-end load for load funds avail- able at the firm. Before the change in late 2022, the firm charged $19.95 to buy and sell shares in a mutual fund, unless it was a member of its no-transaction-fee network. And Ally customers can finally buy shares in no-load funds for free. The firm eliminated its $9.95 charge to buy and sell shares in no-load funds in February. Customers will still pay a sales charge to buy shares in load funds on its broker platform. You can contact the author at Nellie_Huang@kiplinger.com. THE BEST MATCH Which Broker Is Right for You?

But the government’s long effort to strengthen the economy and stanch deflation appears to finally be working. Prices and wages in Japan have started rising. The country’s gross domestic product is on pace to increase 1.4% this year. Efforts to broaden global supply chains beyond China are spark- ing new foreign investment in Japan. And many Japanese com- panies are finally responding to pressure from investors and stock exchange overseers to return more profits to shareholders. Unlocking the cash. Schwab estimates that, in a country where 10-year bonds are paying less than 0.6% and the yield on two-year bonds is slightly nega- tive, companies are sitting on T HE last time the Japa- nese stock market truly sizzled, you could buy a U.S. postage stamp for 25 cents (less than half the cost now) and George Bush (the first one) was in the White House. The Nikkei Stock Average fell more than 75% from its December 1989 peak through September 2012 and still trades below its 34-year-old high. But many experienced inves- tors, including Warren Buffett, are returning to the market, an indication that it might be time for U.S. investors to rediscover what is, after all, the world’s second-largest stock market and third-largest economy. Es- pecially now, “Japan should be part of your portfolio,” says Matt Lamphier, director of research for First Eagle Investments, an investment management firm. The brave souls who bought in a decade ago have profited handsomely. The 225 stocks in the Nikkei have returned more than 11% annualized, on average, about double the return of the MSCI EAFE index of companies based in developed nations out- side the U.S. And since the begin- ning of this year, the Nikkei’s 28.3% total return is handily beating the SP 500’s 20.7% (Prices, returns and other data are as of July 31, unless other- wise noted.) The momentum should con- tinue, says Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. It’s true that Japan’s aging demographics will $2.5 trillion in cash. Low stock prices and big cash hoards mean that many Japanese companies— more than 40% of them, says Schwab—are trading at prices that add up to less than the book value of the business. (Book value measures a company’s tan- gible assets and represents the value shareholders would re- ceive if the company were to be liquidated. Stocks in the SP 500 trade at an average price of four times their book value.) In January, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced it would ask companies trading below book value to develop a strategy to improve their capital manage- ment. As a result, “there is a new commitment to returning more value to shareholders,” Kleintop says. “This is the main driver lifting Japan’s stocks this year.” Rediscovering Japan INTERNATIONAL FUNDS BY KIM CLARK Investing New shareholder-friendly policies should boost the country’s stocks. GETTY IMAGES\n\n32. October 2023 29 Many firms have reinstated or raised dividends, and share buy- backs hit a new record in the first quarter of 2023, Kleintop notes. How should investors find their way back to Japan? Care- fully. Although Japanese stock prices are, on average, still a bar- gain when judged against several U.S. stock price measures, the recent run-up has brought the average Japanese stock price close to the country’s historic average price-earnings multiple of 15.5 times expected earnings. Watch for dips or buy in over time to take advantage of volatil- ity. And, says Kleintop, “this is a time to be broadly diversified.” You may have some exposure to Japan already. Japanese stocks make up 22% of the MSCI EAFE index, for example, a popular benchmark for global and in- ternational index funds. But because of Japanese stocks’ his- tory of underperformance, many managed international funds have minimized their invest- ments in Japan. If you are in- terested in adding some Japan- specific funds to your portfolio, consider these four. WISDOMTREE JAPAN HEDGED EQUITY Overall, the lowest-cost and simplest way to invest in a diver- a result, WisdomTree’s currency- hedged fund has dramatically outperformed its unhedged com- petitors, ranking in the top 1% of its category (Japanese stock funds) for 2021, 2022 and so far in 2023, according to re- search firm Morningstar. It has returned an average of 11.8% over the past five years—more than triple the category average. Of course, currency hedges could dampen returns relative to unhedged funds if the dollar starts to fall against the yen. But hedging allows investors to take currency swings out of the equa- tion and focus just on the poten- tial for stock returns. WISDOMTREE JAPAN HEDGED SMALLCAP EQUITY Japan’s small-company shares are attractive to foreign investors because of comparatively low valuations, high dividend yields and steady returns, says Jeff Weniger, WisdomTree’s head of equity strategy. “Everybody assumes investing overseas is riskier. That hasn’t been borne out.” Historically, he says, the volatility of Japanese small-cap stocks has been lower than the volatility of U.S. small caps. This ETF’s holdings are trading at an average of just 80% of book value—many with cash hoards that bode well for coming divi- dends or buybacks, Weniger says. Japan Hedged SmallCap Equity is one of the broadest small-cap offerings available Investing sified basket of Japanese stocks is through a fund that tracks an index of Japanese stocks. The best-performing Japan-focused fund over the past several years has been WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity. This exchange- traded fund has $2.7 billion in assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.48%. WisdomTree uses a proprietary index that focuses on factors such as dividend pay- outs and export revenues rather than company size. As a result, the portfolio has a 19% stake in small and midsize firms. The fund is also notable for hedging currency swings, pro- tecting U.S. investors against losses when the value of the yen drops against the dollar. Because the Federal Reserve has been raising U.S. interest rates, and the Bank of Japan has been keeping its interest rates low to stimulate inflation and economic activity, the value of the yen has plunged from about 1 cent in mid 2020 to about 0.7 cent in midsummer. As Since the start of 2023, the Nikkei’s 28% total return is handily beating the SP 500’s 21%. Many Japanese companies are finally responding to pressure from investors and stock exchange overseers to return more profits to shareholders.\n\n33. 30 Kiplinger Personal Finance to individual investors. It consists of 739 stocks with positive earn- ings and market values ranging from about $100 million to more than $4 billion. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.58% and has returned more than 27% in the first seven months of 2023, put- ting it in the top 18% of similar funds, according to Morningstar. It ranks in the top 20% over the past one, three, five and 10 years. FIDELITY JAPAN One of the best-performing ac- tively managed, Japan-focused mutual funds (available to indi- vidual investors) over the past three- and five-year periods is Fidelity Japan. Portfolio man- ager Kirk Neureiter’s heavy investment in tech companies (23% of assets) has benefited from the tech industry’s search for suppliers based outside of China. Yet, Japanese tech firms are generally trading at lower price-earnings multiples than similar tech companies in the U.S., he notes. For example, semi- conductor company Renesas Electronics is one of the fund’s top five holdings. The stock also trades in the U.S. as an American depositary receipt (symbol RNECY). The ADR has doubled in the past 12 months but trades at about 19 times ex- pected earnings, compared with an average 31 times for stocks in the SP Semiconductor index. Neureiter says he is engaging with executives to advocate for more shareholder-friendly poli- cies. For most of the past 25 years, executives would defend cash hoards by saying it was nec- essary to plan for emergencies. “They would say, ‘You never know when Mt. Fuji is going to erupt,’ ” recalls Neureiter. “But executives are now taking on the message” about returning more cash to investors. “We are very excited” about the potential for added returns, he says. The Fidelity fund has ranked in the top half of its category for four of the past five full years. It has returned an average of 4.3% annually over the past five years, putting it in the top 21% of simi- lar funds. It charges an expense ratio of 1.13%. T. ROWE PRICE JAPAN This mutual fund has lagged its competitors since 2021 in part because of its focus on growth- oriented companies at a time when value-priced fare has tended to outperform. Manager Archibald Ciganer keeps about 70% of the portfolio in stocks he thinks have healthy earnings- per-share growth prospects. The fund’s top holding is Keyence, which provides automation to factories. Analysts expect earn- ings per share to increase at an annualized rate of 8% over the next three to five years. Though the fund holds Japanese shares, the stock trades in the U.S. as an ADR (KYCCF) and has returned nearly 16% over the past year. The rest of the portfolio, about 30%, is invested in companies whose stocks are poised to bene- fit from changes in corporate governance policies to return more profits to shareholders, says Dan Hurley, a spokesman for the fund. Top-10 holding Hitachi, a diversified conglom- erate with $8.7 billion in cash, raised its dividend by 20% in May. The ADR (HTHIY) has re- turned more than 18% over the past three months. The possibility of cash bonanzas “creates a lot of excitement,” Hurley says. The fund charges 1.02% in expenses. It has returned 7.0% over the past year—a little less than half of the category average. But the fund is worth consider- ing for patient investors.

October 2023 31 Investing ÂȴƲΐ¶ɯɇʠʠЃΐʾʠΐ¶̒ɇʠɄǺͣ STOCKS BY ANNE KATES SMITH A NYONE who has watched Better Call Saul or Frasier is famil- iar with the spin-off concept, in which characters from an exist- ing series branch off in a new show with a different story line. It works sort of the same way in corporate America, when firms split off a part of their business into a new, publicly traded com- pany, usually via a tax-free distri- bution of the stock to sharehold- ers of the original firm. The idea: Capitalize on a sum-of-the parts strategy, in which an underval- ued business unlocks value un- der a new, simplified structure. Stock spin-offs had a strong 2022, although momentum has slowed some this year. Last year, U.S. companies announced 44 spin-offs and completed 20, to- taling $61 billion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs. So far this year, through mid July, nine U.S. spin-offs have been completed, according to financial information provider Dealogic. In theory, spin-offs should be rewarding. Managers of the new company are unfettered by the old organizational chart and are often motivated by performance incentives in a way that was im- possible in a bigger company. And the market may assign a higher valuation to businesses that are less complex and easier to understand, whereas con- glomerates can be penalized. In truth, performance is mixed. GE HealthCare Technologies is up 39% since it began trading on January 4. But ZimVie, a dental and spinal treatment offshoot of medical-devices giant Zimmer Biomet, has lost 64% of its stock value since March 2022. “Spin- offs are not a sure bet,” says Jim Osman, founder and chief execu- tive of The Edge Group, a firm specializing in fundamental anal- ysis of spin-offs and other special situations. Yet, he says, because spin-offs are smaller firms that are under- followed by analysts, investors have more chances to uncover index-beating returns. And spin- offs can be bargains. In a spin-off distribution to parent-company shareholders, “investors gain these shares by default and sell them in the open market pretty much immediately, often making them cheap companies that no one is looking at,” says Osman. “It’s at this point where X marks the spot and you should start digging.” A number of high-profile spin- offs are expected later this year. Osman likes the chances for a few and suggests buying the parent company, pre-spin-off. Among them are 3M (symbol MMM, $112), which will spin off its health care division. The new company will be focused on wound care, health care IT, oral care and filtration products used in the biopharma industry. Danaher (DHR, $255) is shifting toward becoming a pure health care player, so it is spinning off its Environmental and Applied Solutions division, with busi- nesses aimed at protecting re- sources, including global food and water supplies. Kellogg (K, $67) will split in two, sepa- rating its snack and plant-based food business (including Cheez- It and MorningStar Farms) from its North American cereal unit (Frosted Flakes, Special K). For a diverse portfolio of com- panies that have already been spun off, consider exchange- traded fund Invesco SP Spin- Off (CSD, $60), with an expense ratio of 0.65%. The portfolio adds spin-offs with at least $1 billion in market value and holds them for four years. It uses a modified market-cap weight- ing, which skews the portfolio a bit toward larger holdings with- out allowing assets to concen- trate in only the biggest names. The fund’s one-year gain of 10.6% ranks it within the top 21% of mid-cap blend funds. You can contact the author at Anne_Smith@kiplinger.com.

Spread Your Bets Evenly ETF SPOTLIGHT BY ANNE KATES SMITH O VER June and July, the SP 500 gained more than 10%, with the top 10 issues by market value contributing more than 34% of the return. That’s actually a broader advance than earlier in the year, when excluding the top seven companies from the index would have re- sulted in negative returns. So market gains are spreading. Still, tech stocks continue to dominate, contributing roughly one-fourth of the popular benchmark’s return for the two-month period. Index investors looking for value as well as a broader representation of the overall market might consider an equal-weight index, constructed so that no one stock, or a handful of behe- moths, can dominate. Invesco SP 500 Equal Weight ETF lets you spread your bets evenly among the stocks in the SP 500, limiting concentra- tion in mega-cap names and boosting exposure to smaller firms. Over time, such a strategy has paid off. From the end of 2003 (the year the exchange- traded fund debuted) through June 30, the largest 50 stocks in the SP 500 returned roughly 9% per year, on average, according to Invesco; the smallest 50 returned an average of 14%. Small-company stocks typically take off in new bull markets but may have been held back this time by the Federal Reserve’s still-hawkish monetary policy. With the Fed likely having ended its rate- tightening program in July, “mid- and small-cap stocks, as well as the equal-weight 500, will once again take a leadership role,” says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
