"WTF (Where They From)" was worth the wait.

Three years after the release of her last single and seven years after the release of her last music video, Missy Elliott returned to the music scene Thursday with "WTF (Where They From)." She collaborated with Pharrell Williams on the song.

Elliott directed the video with her longtime friend Dave Meyers. Their history is a long one, as he either directed or co-directed her biggest videos, including 2001's "Get Ur Freak On," 2001's "One Minute Man," 2001's "Take Away/4 My People," 2002's "Work It," 2003's "Gossip Folks," 2003's "Pass That Dutch," 2005's "Lose Control," 2006's "We Run This" and 2008's "Ching-a-Ling/Shake Your Pom Pom."

In the futuristic "WTF (Where They From)," Elliott covers herself in mirrors and fuses streetwear with pop art. There's even a scene with marionettes made in the likenesses of Elliott and Williams. Suffice to say, Elliott never runs out of ideas.

Earlier this year, the innovative musician reminded people of her talents when she joined Katy Perry as a performer at the Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show. Elliott had been working behind the scenes for the past few years; her last solo single was 2012's double release, "9th Inning" and "Triple Threat," which were both Timbaland productions. During that time, she continued to produce music for other artists and contributed to Janet Jackson's No. 1 album, Unbreakable.

A snippet of "WTF (Where They From)" has been making waves since late October, when ESPN started using it in NBA commercials. Elliott, who heavily promoted the song on Twitter before signing up for Instagram Wednesday, has yet to announce a title or release date for her next album.
