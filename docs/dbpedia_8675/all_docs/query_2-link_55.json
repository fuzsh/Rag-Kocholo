        "text": "Megan Thee Stallion - \"Circles\"\n\nNot only is Missy Elliott an elite songwriter and dancer, but the icon is also a producer.\n\nCool & Dre and Rick Starr Did It repurposed her production on Jasmine Sullivan’s “Holding You Down (Going in Circles)” for a Megan Thee Stallion track with similar subject matter. Found on 2020’s Good News, Meg’s “Circles” sees the “Houston Hottie” picking up where Sullivan left off, rapping about the perils of a distressed relationship.\n\nThee Stallion also uses the track to tackle bouts with untrustworthy lovers, flipping Elliott’s 2010 composition into a “bad bi**h song” for women in dysfunctional situations. Sticking true to her confidence, Meg’s version finds the emcee unbothered by her unfaithful man’s actions, vowing to “turn up on em.” Cool & Dre and Rick Starr Did It’s track directly samples Jasmine’s chorus and her song’s instrumental, which itself samples The Honey Drippers’ “Impeach the President” (drums), Mary J. Blige’s “Be Happy” (lyrics), and The Firm’s “Affirmative Action” (riff).\n\nMegan Thee Stallion’s “Circles” debuted and peaked at no. 94 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 2020.\n\nBubba Sparxxx - \"Ugly\" (featuring Timbaland)\n\nBubba Sparxxx was on fire when he hit the scene with his debut album, Dark Days, Bright Nights in 2001. “Ugly” was the LP’s lead single and featured an appearance from Timbaland, who also produced the track. With the direction of Timbo, the hit borrowed elements from Missy’s “Get Ur Freak On,” released just a year prior.\n\nThe sample appears at the 3:28 mark in the song, directly lifting the primary composition of “Get Ur Freak On.” Timbaland, who produced both songs, blends each hit and even featured Misdemeanor in the music video for Bubba’s hit, reprising her iconic refrain.\n\nBubba’s “Ugly” also became the second biggest hit of the Georgian artist’s career, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nJ. Cole - \"Best Friend\"\n\nJ. Cole‘s Friday Night Lights is a classic mixtape from the Blog Era, cementing the North Carolina emcee as Roc Nation’s next up. For one of the 2010 project’s tracks, Cole directly sampled the VA native’s work from her debut LP, Supa Dupa Fly. Cole grabbed the Timbaland-produced “Best Friend” and reworked it, imagining it as a pseudo-response to Missy Elliott and Aaliyah‘s original song.\n\nMissy and Babygirl’s version finds the women telling their best friend to leave an unfaithful man. On the contrary, Cole’s version tells the story from the man’s perspective, exploring domestic and emotional abuse within the unstable relationship. While the song didn’t feature Elliott, Jermaine would enlist the musician for “Nobody’s Perfect” from his debut album, Cole World: The Sideline Story, just a year later.\n\nFLO - \"Fly Girl\" (Featuring Missy Elliott)\n\nFYI, FLO is a British trio leading the charge in the girl/boy band renaissance, with heavy early aughts nostalgia, and their second single, “Fly Girl,” which features Missy and samples her hit “Work It.”\n\nJorja Douglas, Stella Quaresma, Renée Downer repurposed the song’s most iconic lines, “If you’re a fly girl, get your nails done, get a pedicure, get your hair did” and “Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup,” to create the foundation for their track’s beat and chorus. The Gen Z ladies took the Missy Elliott appreciation a step further and invited the icon to appear in the video for their club-ready cut.\n\nMisdemeanor spoke about FLO sampling her classic in a press release around the song’s release, praising the rising girl group’s sound. “I remember a few of their fans sent me clips of their performances, and I immediately felt the authentic 90s vibe,” the legend said. “I loved the fact they all sang lead so well—great vocal control—so when I was asked to be a part of the “Fly Girl” record, it was a no-brainer. They used the inspiration from my song “Work It,” and I felt they did it justice. I enjoyed it and I believe they have a long, great career ahead of them.”\n\nDrake - \"Bria's Interlude\" (Featuring Omarion)\n\nAnother song sampling from Missy Elliott‘s debut album is Drake‘s “Bria’s Interlude.”\n\nDrake linked up with Omarion for the So Far Gone fan favorite in 2009, flipping another fan favorite from Missy’s Supa Dupa Fly, “Friendly Skies.” “Friendly Skies” showed off the chemistry between Missy, Tim, and Ginuwine, with production from the first two artists.\n\nDrawing on a sample of Earth, Wind, & Fire’s “New World Symphony,” “Friendly Skies” was an unapologetic R&B song that featured Elliott taking centerstage as a singer. Drizzy’s right-hand man, Noah “40” Shebib, sampled the track, speeding up its opening arrangement and a bit of the songstress’ vocal harmonies. Much like Missy, Drake approaches the cut with an R&B performance while his rapping takes the back seat. He transforms the song into a love letter to Bria Myles, a model he was “smitten” with at the time.\n\n“I was smitten over this girl from LA, and I started writing a song about her,” he told MTV News. “A lot of the R&B [I do] is based on women that come into my life and inspire me to speak to them in song and say what I never would expose on a talking level.”\n\nSmino — \"No L's\"\n\nSmino repurposed Monica’s “Knock, Knock” for one of the standout tracks, “No L’s,” from his third studio album, 2022’s Luv 4 Rent. Missy Elliott had some assistance from Kanye West on the original track’s production, sampling the Masquerader’s “It’s A Terrible Thing To Waste.”\n\nProducer Kal Banx followed suit and sampled the sample, reimagining the 2003 song’s “knock, knock, knock, knock” refrain in the opening moments of their track. Banx also rearranged and slowed down the cut’s piano keys, fitting it into a trap-flavored composition. While Monica’s track was focused on telling her ex to no longer come knocking on her door with his foolishness, Smi uses the material to talk his sh*t.\n\n“My amigo done brought the Casamigos to the party,” he raps on the deep cut. “Send h*es on my side/I been havin’ these h*es on they toes like Crocs/Ironic, the pot was the Crock/Brought the sauce in the stu’ and this bi**h breathin’ fire/Caucasian driver, no top, Greg Popp/But the spurs on that bih we outside/The goal wasn’t guap/It was makin’ more opportunities and opps.”\n\nLAYA - \"Crazy Down\"\n\nMissy’s influence on the game is undeniable. If you’re looking for proof, strands of the legend’s creative DNA can be found in New York City’s rising star, LAYA. The singer’s “Crazy Down” paid homage to the legend, blending lyrics from Brandy’s “I Wanna Be Down” and sampling Elliott’s “Crazy Feelings,” featuring Beyoncé. The sample can be heard at the 1:01 mark, with Missy singing the track’s title. Producers ORA took the vocal performance, slowed it down, and chopped it with a stutter effect, creating the musical foundation for “Crazy Down.”\n\nSpeaking with Rated RnB about her cover for “Sock it to Me” and “Crazy Down,” LAYA opened up about the VA icon and her underrated influence on R&B and her artistry.\n\n“‘Crazy Down,’ was kind of built around that ‘Crazy Feelings’ sample. Then I took this interpolation of Brandy’s ‘I Wanna Be Down’ and did my own thing with it. It’s like this mashup of all my mothers. It just came together so well,” she said. “Missy goes under the radar a lot for her R&B influence. So, I just took ‘Sock it to Me’ as an opportunity as my moment to sing a Missy Elliott song and pay homage in a different light on the record. It’s not the original, nothing will ever be the original, but it was fun to do.”"
