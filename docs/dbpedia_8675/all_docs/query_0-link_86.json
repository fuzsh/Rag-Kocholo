        "text": "Lose Control starts off in a solid black room with dancers. Later, Elliott is seen buried in sand and slowly emerges in front of three other dancers. Elliott's head is added digitally to a different body. The next scene is in an old wooden house and in rows of dancers as they continue to dance. After that there are rows of people dancing outside of a building with the people dressed in vintage clothes and the footage filtered to look very old and grainy with some colors flattened and others oversaturated. They then end up on a desert road near a truck, where a single line of dancers finish dancing. The video then switches over to the song \"On & On\", where three dancers dance in sand as Elliott dances and levitates over a wooden plank, later accompanied by Tommy Lee."
