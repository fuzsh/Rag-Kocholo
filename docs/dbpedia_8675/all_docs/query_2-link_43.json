        "text": "2019 has been a monumental year for Missy Elliott. After getting inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, the 48-year-old music legend has been featured on the Lizzo track \"Tempo\" and just released a new EP, , featuring five new songs. Oh, and she's gearing up to be honored with the Video Vanguard Award at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards. Beloved by all, Elliott made a name for herself in the '90s and early aughts, creating music that young Black women could relate to. And while we'll always love her mega-hits like \"Work It\" and \"Get Ur Freak On,\" new songs off Iconology like \"Throw It Back\" keep us dancing. “Let’s #ThrowItBack to a time when music just felt good and made us want to dance,” Elliott said on Twitter. In honor of that, here are 12 of her greatest songs, ranked.\n\n\"Sock It 2 Me\" is not only one of Elliott's biggest hits of the '90s, but it's beloved for its Mega Man-inspired music video. One of the many collaborations between Elliott and Hype Williams,\"Sock It 2 Me\" peaked at number three on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Song chart and number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMost Memorable Lyric: \"My hormones jumping like a disco / I be popping mess like some Crisco\"\n\nThis clap-heavy track designed to be twerked to is one of the many collaborations between Elliott and Timbaland, and samples several songs: \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" by Santa Esmeralda, \"Magic Mountain\" by War, and \"Potholes in My Lawn\" by De La Soul. The song, which peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100, shows off her lyrical prowess. There's a reason the second verse ends with a literal round of applause.\n\nMost Memorable Lyric: \"I'm under attack like my name was Saddam / I am the bomb from New York to Milan / And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm\"\n\n“Hot Boyz” was a massive success for Elliott, and it was the third and last single from her 1999 album Da Real World. The song peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 18 weeks at number one on the Hot Rap Singles chart. Lyrically, the song focuses on Elliott's desire to find a man with money (and ideally a \"Platinum Visa\") who will also treat her right. Oh, Missy. Searching for a unicorn.\n\nMost Memorable Lyric: \"Can I move with you, do you need some help? / I cook boy, I'll give you more / I'm a fly girl, and I like those\"\n\n“This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive\" turned out to be one of the least-true lyrics of all time considering \"Work It\" peaked at number two for ten weeks in 2002 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart. It can be hard to imagine a world without the word \"badonkadonk,\" for which we can thank Elliott for popularizing in this song. A sound engineer's mistake created the iconic backward lyric in the chorus, and the song lives on in viral video heaven forever.\n\nMost Memorable Lyric: \"If it's 9 to 5 or shaking your ass (Aha) /\n\nAin't no shame, ladies do your thing (C'mon) /\n\nJust make sure you ahead of the game\""
