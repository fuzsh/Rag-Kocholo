        "text": "Post Malone is in his country era.\n\nOn May 10, the \"Rockstar\" singer debuted his new song with Morgan Wallen called “I Had Some Help.”\n\nIn the upbeat country song, the pair sing about a breakup and how they wish their partners would take more accountability for the demise of the relationship.\n\nEssentially, the breakup wasn't all their fault. They had some help in the ending.\n\nIn the chorus, they sing, \"I had some help / It ain’t like I can make this kinda mess all by myself / Don’t act like you ain’t help me pull that bottle off the shelf / Been deep in every weekend if you couldn’t tell / They say, 'Teamwork makes the dream work.'\"\n\nThe music video also showcased a brand new look from Malone, who is mainly for hip-hop or pop-rap music, with songs like \"Circles\" and \"Better Now.\"\n\nIn the music video, Malone wore a pair of suede boots, a Dallas baseball hat and a white button-down shirt with blue jeans and a brown jacket.\n\nIn the comments, fans said they adored Malone's new song and his ability to make music for any kind of genre. He recently collaborated with Beyoncé on her country-inspired album, \"Cowboy Carter,\" and Taylor Swift on her 11th studio album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\"Posty going country is the best thing that could’ve happened to this world,\" one person commented on YouTube.\n\nAnother said, \"The collab I never knew I needed.\"\n\nA third wrote, \"I literally love that Postie is multi-genre artist.\"\n\nOn April 25, Malone teased \"I Had Some Help\" when he played a snippet of the song on Instagram.\n\nImmediately, fans said they liked the tune and couldn't wait for him to drop the full version online.\n\n\"For the love of God, drop the track already,\" one person wrote.\n\nMalone has been teasing his stint into country music for quite some time. At the 2023 Country Music Awards, he sang “John Deere Greene” and “Pickup Man\" alongside Wallen and country music artist Hardy to honor the late Joe Diffie.\n\nThen, according to Billboard, he also confirmed that he was going to make country music when he addressed his fans during the CMA's Twitch livestream.\n\nHe reportedly said, \"Country record is coming. I keep singing a song that we made while I was in Nashville. It’s so f---- sick, but it’s not out.\"\n\nRead the lyrics to 'I Had Some Help'\n\n(Verse 1: Post Malone)\n\nYou got a lot of nerve, don’t you, baby?\n\nI only hit the curb ‘cause you made me\n\nYou’re telling all your friends that I’m crazy\n\nLike I’m the only one\n\nWhy’d you throw them stones if you\n\nHad a wild hair of your own or two?\n\nLiving in your big glass house with a view\n\nI thought you knew\n\n(Chorus: Post Malone)\n\nI had some help\n\nIt ain’t like I can make this kinda mess all by myself\n\nDon’t act like you ain’t help me pull that bottle off the shelf\n\nBeen deep in every weekend if you couldn’t tell\n\nThey say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”\n\nHell, I had some help (Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Verse 2: Morgan Wallen)\n\nYou thought I’d take the blame for us a-crumbling\n\nGo ‘round like you ain’t guilty of something\n\nAlready lost the game that you been running\n\nGuess it’s catching up to you, huh\n\nYou think that you’re so innocent\n\nAfter all the sh!t you did\n\nI ain’t an angel, you ain’t heaven-sent\n\nCan’t wash our hands of this\n\n(Chorus: Morgan Wallen)\n\nI had some help\n\nIt ain’t like I can make this kinda mess all by myself\n\nDon’t act like you ain’t help me pull that bottle off the shelf\n\nBeen deep in every weekend if you couldn’t tell\n\nThey say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”\n\nHell, I had some help (Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Bridge: Morgan Wallen and Post Malone)\n\nIt takes two to break a heart in two, oh\n\nBaby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you\n\nAw, if that ain’t the truth (Oh)\n\n(Chorus: Post Malone & Morgan Wallen)\n\nI had some help\n\nIt ain’t like I can make this kinda mess all by myself\n\nDon’t act like you ain’t help me pull that bottle off the shelf\n\nBeen deep in every weekend if you couldn’t tell\n\nThey say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”\n\nHell, I had some help (Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Help)\n\n(Help)"
