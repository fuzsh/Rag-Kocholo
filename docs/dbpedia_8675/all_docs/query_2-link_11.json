        "text": "Missy Elliot isn’t just an international hip-hop star. She’s now an interplanetary one. NASA transmitted lyrics from Elliot’s 1997 hit “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” to Venus using its Deep Space Network. “To date, the system has transmitted only one other song into space, making the transmission of Elliott’s song a first for hip-hop and NASA,” the space agency said in a statement this week. Elliot is in good company. The other song was “Across the Universe,” by The Beatles. It was transmitted into deep space in 2008.\n\nElliot’s song pulls in lyrics and samples from Ann Peebles’ 1970s soul hit “I Can’t Stand the Rain,” famously covered by Tina Turner in 1984. Elliot is on the road with her “Out Of This World” tour, so it was a perfect time to partner with a space agency. NASA feels a kinship with Elliot’s work. “Missy has a track record of infusing space-centric storytelling and futuristic visuals in her music videos so the opportunity to collaborate on something out of this world is truly fitting,” said NASA’s Brittany Brown.\n\nOne example of Elliot’s space interest can be found in her music video for “Sock It 2 Me,” where she battles flying robots and runs across the surface of a red planet.\n\nNASA beamed “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” through space on July 12 where it traveled 158 million miles to reach Venus. It took about 14 minutes to get there at the speed of light. DSN is part of NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation program and features “an array of giant radio antennas that allow missions to track, send commands and receive scientific data from spacecraft venturing to the moon and beyond.” It’s how many NASA missions phone home.\n\nVenus is sometimes called Earth’s twin. They’re both rocky planets and they’re roughly the same size. But sometimes Venus is called Earth’s evil twin. Its surface is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is covered in sulfuric acid clouds. Despite those downsides, Venus is Elliot’s favorite planet. “I chose Venus because it symbolizes strength, beauty and empowerment and I am so humbled to have the opportunity to share my art and my message with the universe,” Elliot said.\n\nSending the song through space was a marketing tie-in with Elliot’s tour, but it also gave NASA a chance to highlight its upcoming missions to Venus. The DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry and Imaging) and VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography and Spectroscopy) missions are expected to launch within the next decade. The spacecraft will send back data via the DSN about the planet’s atmosphere. They will also capture high-resolution images and map the planet’s surface. NASA wants to understand why Venus is so different from Earth despite the planets’ similarities."
