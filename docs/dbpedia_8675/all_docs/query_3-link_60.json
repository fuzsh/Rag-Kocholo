        "text": "Welcome to Lifestream, where Teen Vogue's writers take music one step further and discuss how the biggest and best songs on your favorite playlists turn into the soundtracks of our lives.\n\nA black trash bag may not mean much to you, but for me, it’s a fashion statement — one I read at a very young age. The garment: a shiny, onyx bodysuit, ballooning a dark-skinned, full-figured black woman. As she stomped and swayed in her marvelously monstrous attire, her mouth spit words of fire and confidence. She, a woman with a body society deems too big, and skin too dark, adorned a bodysuit that expanded on these notions. I stared in wonder at a woman who amplified the qualities that made her unique, who used her style, makeup, and music to reject Western beauty standards. She defined her own standard of beauty by being a boss.\n\nThe garbage bag-sporting goddess is of course none other than Missy Elliot in the “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” music video. My older brother and I, growing up in the ‘90s, were obsessed with music and music videos. Back then, the radio, MTV, and BET were our primary sources for new music, and of course, we owned a cassette player until upgrading to a CD player in our teens (we didn’t see iPods until we were young adults). Having such specific outlets of music meant we found creative ways to savor our favorite songs: like surrounding the radio with a blank cassette tape inside, eagerly waiting to press record when a song we liked played, or watching TRL and MTV’s then countless other music video programs in anticipation of our favorite music video. The best part was hearing a hot new song and imagining what the visuals for it would be.\n\nWe weren’t ready for the “The Rain” video. Everything about Missy moved us: the twitchy, erratic dance moves, fisheye camera shots that made you feel too close to her, but intimate enough to be in her personal space, her cropped haircut, the way her eyes and mouth popped out toward the end of the video. And of course, that amazing trash bag jumpsuit, paired with burgundy shades and a sick, striped metallic headpiece. And oh, the cameos! Diddy, Lil Kim, Timbaland, and Da Brat appeared in this video, among others. Missy arrived right on time: with peers such as Busta Rhymes, the Bad Boy family and SWV, Missy’s music felt prolific and relevant all at once. But her main crew, a mysterious, nonchalant collective of creative souls, The Superfriends (Aaliyah, Timbaland, magoo, Timbaland, Missy), changed the way I listened to music, how I visualized sounds and stories and widened the possibilities of what sexual expression can be.\n\nMissy embodied a weird, animated side of femininity, and proved that feminine sexual expression isn't limited to the narrow box female rappers are put in. Moreover, she expressed Afrofuturism and some of the most influential versions of black girl magic in her music videos, by creating ethereal worlds for us to venture to, with a funky hip hop soundtrack as our guide and black feminist messages as our vehicle to truth.\n\nIn “She’s a B*tch”, Missy plays with the nasty, villainous, stereotypes that surround the persona of being a b*tch — a term that, at one point and still for some, is one of the biggest insults that a woman can receive. It's a dark, dramatic video, with stormy skies, glowing lights, black waters, an all black ensemble, stone studded eyebrows and a cape. Missy finds the empowerment in being feared, intimidated and misjudged: she embodies the word b*tch, transforming it from an insult into an ecstatic compliment; “She's a b*tch/When they say my name/Talk mo' junk but won't look my way/She's a b*tch/See I got mo' cheese/Back on up while I roll up my sleeve,” she sneers, fully aware of her status, abilities and influence. Now, some women relish in the title: the sharp, one syllable word brings music to our ears. Missy is one woman we can thank for that.\n\nMissy is fully aware of how music can challenge common social norms about male and female interactions and relationships. With creepy dolls, a colorful toy house and car, “Beep Me 911” narrates a tale of an unreliable lover and the consequences he faces when he crosses her. The doll symbolism is not in vain here: Missy sings “Why you played on me, wasn't I good enough for you?”, where visually, she uses the toy aesthetic to illustrate the hurt of getting played. We play with toys and dolls, perceive them as objects that we can control because they don’t have agency of their own — they are manufactured for our enjoyment. Similarly, some men play women in relationships, with no respect for their personal and emotional needs, believing that we exist for their pleasure. In “Beep Me 911”, the fear that dolls can come to life and overtake their manipulator drives the story along, and interestingly, Magoo acts as a Ken doll who meets his demise at the wits of sensual, acrobatic action figures that seduce him with their robotic yet hypnotizing movements.\n\nFor Missy, sexuality is a place for women to impress, to reign, to gain pleasure under their own terms, and sometimes in a distinctly unusual dimension. There's “Sock it 2 Me”, where we’re transported to outer space, and Missy dons a suit similar to mega man or a ‘90s video game protagonist. Her lyrics challenge a potential lover, asking him to give her all he’s got. But it isn't one sided: she’s prepared to bring her best as well. Looking back, 1997’s “Sock it To Me” is a great prelude to 2001’s “One Minute Man” where she calls out partners who finish in only 60 seconds, neglecting her pleasure. Yet, “One Minute Man” is exaggerated in a literal way: the setting seems to be an hourly hotel, where lovers pay for a room away from their daily lives. But in her hotel, magic and the unknown thrive: she dances and levitates in front of her man, glides across the floor on her stomach, and even lifts her head clear off her neck. These strange actions would surely turn any potential partner off, but Missy wants someone who can handle all her complexity, eccentricity and disturbia. If they go soft — well, too bad.\n\nAs a child who lived for the surreal and supernatural — I loved werewolves (vampires were too suspect to me), was engrossed in a YA sci-fi series about teen goddesses reincarnate, read Goosebumps books with my older brother like drinking water, and doodled black mermaids, fairies and other mythical humanoid creatures in my notebook — Missy’s world provided me with the representations of myself I was lacking. Black women were rarely the subjects in sci-fi, fantasy and horror flicks, and not many female performers were experimenting with genres and visuals the way Missy was at that time.\n\nOf course, as a kid, I didn't pick up on Missy’s sexual innuendoes or realized how important her messages of female empowerment were to my personal development. Women don't have to express one kind of sexy, and it definitely doesn't have to fit into the prescribed male gaze of what sexy means. We can be weird, strange, unsettling, assertive, straightforward and clever about our sexy. We can be something not yet imagined.\n\nBesides challenging sexual and cultural codes, Missy was all about money — her own, and that of the men she desired. In “Hot Boyz”, she applauds men who are not only fine and talented, but are financially sound and blessed materialistically. It’s no question that financial security is a great quality in a partner, but for too long women have been misjudged for listing that as an important trait in the opposite sex. Here, she’s unapologetic about it — and we know that Missy also has money of her own, so when she calls out men with paper, it isn’t out of competition or caretaking, it’s for compatibility.\n\nMoney is also a topic in “All N My Grill”, where she casually asks “Can you pay my bills? Let me know if you will, cause a chick gotta live”. Here, money isn’t about reliance either, or gold digging, as some may easily perceive — it's a necessity, and perhaps there is an exchange she is seeking from her partner. Missy wants women to know that money isn’t something we should feel ashamed or awkward about discussing in our relationships, and we shouldn’t feel apologetic about wanting it. Especially, since women still earn less than men — and for black and Latina women, even lower.\n\nYet, what I find most impressive and most appreciative about Miss E. is that her aesthetic hasn’t changed. Twenty years is a long time, and during these decades she has faced several ups and downs in her career that affected her musically and personally — the loss of her dear friend and collaborator Aaliyah, health issues, the conversation around her body image, natural changes in music trends.\n\nI was ecstatic when, this January, “I’m Better” erupted online, and even more enthused after watching the music video, which stayed true to her signature style: tons of dope choreography, experimental makeup and attire, and a distant yet familiar otherworldly landscape. The only difference is that it is more modern, but everything about it still screamed Misdemeanor. Although, I do fear that her aesthetic isn’t as appreciated or adored as it was 20 years ago, that her individuality is drowned out in the new pool of artists and sounds.\n\nYet, the greatest lesson Missy has shared with us is the power of being a freak. Take that however you like: be weird, be kinky, be creepy, be strange. All is welcome in her eyes, as long as you are having fun, being true to you, and turning on and up the side of you that exists in the dark. Get your freak on, but don’t get it twisted: being weird is timeless. It will never go out of style.\n\nRelated: America Ferrera Raps Missy Elliott’s “Gossip Folks” on 'Lip Sync Battle'\n\nCheck this out:"
