        "text": "In-demand songwriter, pathbreaking producer, label exec, and video trendsetter Missy Elliott holds the record for most platinum albums by a woman rapper. Elliott forged new paths for women in the music industry and beyond by unapologetically owning her body, her sexual desires, and her Blackness.\n\nThroughout her critically acclaimed and commercially successful career, Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott has been her own woman. She’s carved out her own lane and done it her own way. By 1997, the year she released her debut single, “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),” she had already made a name for herself. The multi-hyphenate superstar is the only female rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, and the first of hopefully many female rappers to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."
