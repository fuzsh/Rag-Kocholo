        "text": "Missy Elliott is an icon living.\n\nIn addition to dropping her Iconology EP, the Grammy-winning trailblazer debuts a video for one of the five tracks, “Throw It Back.” Missy keeps innovating and snatching wigs (“…Till I see their scalps)” in the dance-heavy clip, which opens with a cameo from Teyana Taylor, who schools a young girl on “the innovator of all innovators, the game-changing sensation.”\n\nMissy rolls out the pink carpet as she and her dancers glide down the street in their pink suits and bald scalps. She then uses her braids as a jump rope and gets in formation with her florescent MCM-clad dancers. After riding in a chopped-up car and rocking an “Iconic” chain, she switches into a patent yellow jumpsuit. Misdemeanor the astronaut also plants her flag on the moon, reminding fans that she’s still got it.\n\n“Missy still got them losing control and every night is still ladies night,” she raps.\n\nThe hip-hop icon will receive a special Moonman of her own at Monday’s MTV VMAs. She will be honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award and take the stage for her first performance in 16 years.\n\nWatch her throw it back."
