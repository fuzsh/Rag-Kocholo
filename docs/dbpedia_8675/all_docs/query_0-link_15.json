        "text": "\"Sock It 2 Me\" is the third track on Missy Elliott's debut studio album Supa Dupa Fly and was released as the second single from the album on September 21, 1997 alongside its official music video. It features Da Brat and samples \"Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)\" by The Delfonics.\n\nBackgroud[]\n\n\"Sock It 2 Me\" is the first collaboration beetwen Missy and Da Brat, followed by the shortly after released Not Tonight (Ladies Night Remix).\n\nComposition and Lyrics[]\n\n\"Sock It 2 Me\" was produced by Timbaland (like all of the songs on Supa Dupa Fly) with a tempo of 170 BPM and in the A♭ major scale. The beat directly samples the 1968 single “Ready or Not Here I Come (Can’t Hide from Love)” by the Delfonics, which creates an R&B beat influenced by Hip-Hop, when underlayed by Timbaland's drums.\n\n\"Sock It 2 Me\" was written by Missy Elliott, Da Brat and the songs producer Timbaland. Thom Bell and William Hart, whose song \"Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)\" was sampled, were also given a writing credit. The song features Missy only singing, as many songs on Supa Dupa Fly do, while Da Brat takes over the rapping part. It contains two catchy sung verses by Missy detached by the song's iconic chorus. After Missy's second verse and the chorus being played once, the chorus is repeated again but now in a harsher spoken tone, just for the \"original chorus\" being played once again.This repetition of the chorus creates a tension that supports Da Brat's launch into her rap verse and makes the turning point stand out much more. Da Brat comes through with a fast lined up flow featuring complex and tacked rhyme schemes, bragging about her and Missy, much like Lil' Kim did on the track before, Hit 'Em wit da Hee. After her 14-bar long verse ends, a bridge is being played featuring vocals by Brat in a high voice, which provides a great transition from Brat's verse into the song's outro. It may be important to note that the bridge is reminiscent of Brat's song own album track \"Da Shit Ya Can't Fuc Wit\" off of her 1994 debut studio album Funkdafied. The outro features Da Brat giving praises to Missy, Timbaland and herself. It also may be important to note that the clean version of the track features very differing lyrics by Da Brat in her verse and outro.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nMusic Video[]\n\nDirected by Hype Williams and cleary inspired by the Mega-Man series, the music video contains cameos by Lil' Kim and Timbaland. The video takes place on a planet (most likely Mars) and the main plot is about Missy Elliott and Lil' Kim being chased by robot monsters and later rescued by Da Brat. The music video is one of the most critically acclaimed music videos off all time.\n\nThe video starts of with the moon, which then moves to the lower right corner, only for the Earth to be shown. A white rocket is being shot from the Earth to a planet (which most likely is Mars). A scene which shows Missy standing in front of different planets, who here wears the same spacesuit as she does in the scenes of the main plot, is now introduced and will appear several times throughout the video. Another scene shows Missy with multiple female dancers dancing in an black-red dome. Missy is wearing a red bodysuit with a red hood while the dancers are wearing a different red-black outfit with a red wig. Shots from this scene are interspersed throughout the rest of this video.\n\nNow the main plot of the vidoes continues and the door of the rocket opens and Missy Elliott and co-star Lil' Kim, who both are wearing red-white space suits, are leaving the rocket. Missy's spacesuit has a M on it (standing for Missy) and Kim's has a K on it (standing for Kim). Shortly after, both are seen by two giant yellow robot monsters who now are chasing Missy and Kim. The robots have the letter T on them. As they come closer and closer, Missy and Kim are falling into a hole in the ground. Throughout this scene various shots of Missy and her dancers in the dome and of Missy standing in front of different planets are thrown in.\n\nIn the hole, which has a pink ground, a giant green robot monster is present who Missy is now fighting against. Missy Elliott shots at the robot monster with blue magic, while Lil' Kim is hiding behind Missy's back. After that Missy and Kim find and enter a door which leads them to a long hallway. The robot monster doesn't notice that, as he was being shot by Missy and is now confused where they went. After a while the robot monster notices the door and now chases Missy and Kim. Due to the shooting his arm is \"injured\" and can't move as fast as he wants to. Now Missy and Kim are finding an escape route in the roof and are flying through it. Again throughout this scene various shots of Missy in the dome and her standing in front of the planets are thrown in (From now on those scenes will only be noted if something changes in them).\n\nThen four black-yellow robot monster notice the two of them and are chasing them around. After that, four bigger black-yellow robot monsters with white accents are shooting at Missy Elliott and Lil' Kim which leads them to fall into a purple sea. As Missy is turning back, she sees that now little black-yellow robot mosters are following them. After a while Missy Elliott and Lil' Kim flee out of the sea and think the danger is erased just for them to being seen by four giant four-legged yellow robot monsters, who are flying through the sky. A scene of Timbaland who is dressed up as a professor in front of different planets is thrown in and continues to be shown a couple times later in the video. While the giant robot monsters throw bombs at Missy and Kim, who are again trying to flee, a scene of Da Brat who wears a orange-black spacesuit with orange horns in front of different planets appears. She continues to be shown in front of planets numerous times later in the video, but with a different helmet.\n\nNow Da Brat sees how are Missy and Kim being chased while she's flying in her vehicle and is wearing a similar spacesuit to the one she wore that one time in the other scene. This outfit however has red accents and a different looking shape. After a while she is able to land and let them fly on the back of her vehicle. Long shots of Da Brat standing in front of the planets with her helmet are shown and cover up a lot of the rest of the video. Scenes of Timbaland in front of the planets are also shown. While they are trying to fly away, the four robot monsters aren't letting them go and try to bombad Da Brat, Missy Elliott and Lil' Kim. Despite the dangerous robot monsters Da Brat is still able to rescue the three of them into her or Missy's spaceship which has a big M on it (standing for Missy Elliott). Different to the audio version of the song, the chorus is repeated for a last time, but fades out before the chorus ends. While that happens Missy is dancing with the dancers in the dome. At the end of the video while Missy, Brat and Kim are flying away with the spaceship, the giant green robot monster (from the hole) jumps out of the ground and tries to hit the spaceship, but fails and becomes angry.\n\nMusic Video Information Released September 21, 1997 Filmed Director Hype Williams Production Co Choreographer Hi-Hat Starring Missy Elliott\n\nDa Brat\n\nLil' Kim\n\nTimbaland Length 4:24 Views\n\nReferences[]"
