        "text": "Post by B-Boy on\n\nThe third single from Miss E...So Addictive. It peaked at #13 on the R&B chart and #45 on the Hot 100, way lower than her previous two. The album and single versions feature backing vocals by Kameelah (702) and Tweet respectively.\n\nAccording to an interview, Missy stated it's the flip side of \"Hot Boyz\" as far as content and meaning. Like \"Hot Boyz\", however, she changed the intention of the song when it was released as a single. What started out as a throwback to the R&B duets of the 80s ended up becoming a tribute to Aaliyah.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't too enthused about this song as a single. It was and still is one of the stronger cuts from the album though. I was rooting for \"4 My People\".\n\nPost by Sir Benji on\n\nI love the single version of this.\n\nI never knew there was a full video for \"4 My People\". I believe they were released as a double A-side internationally.\n\nPost by Sounds from the Other Side on\n\nThis song is very beautiful, I love it.\n\nI also love the video version with Tweet extra adlibs.\n\nPost by back2blk on\n\nNever enjoyed Missy slowing it down....I don't think she's a ballad artist....\n\nHOWEVER, Ginuwine and Tweet sound UGH-MAZING on this.\n\nAnd bitch, when 4 My People comes thru on the video, shit gets poppin!!"
