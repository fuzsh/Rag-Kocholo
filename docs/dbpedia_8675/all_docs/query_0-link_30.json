        "text": "Missy Elliott is taking a trip down memory lane while practicing social distancing.\n\nOn Saturday (April 18), the 48-year-old shared an exclusive video of the making of her song “Lose Control,” which was recorded 15 years ago. In the two-minute clip, Fatman Scoop recorded his vocals inside the studio booth while Ciara danced effortlessly to his ad-libs.\n\n“WOW!!! NEVER SEEN BEFORE. This is my session to my song Lose Control 15 YEARS AGO with @ciara & @fatmanscoop. This the first time anyone seeing it & the creation of scoop chants/adlibs that he did by looking at Ciara dancing from in the booth” Elliott wrote alongside the video clip that she posted on social media. “Who would’ve thought this song would end up winning a Grammy.”\n\nIn another tweet, Elliott explained how she came up with the idea for the video. “We did the video based off a style of dance called the Lindy hop. Fatman Scoop did his adlibs watching Ciara dance but Scoop is known for chants that’s why I asked him to be on the song along with Cici,” she wrote.\n\nThroughout her career, Elliott has seen a ton of success from her music. Back in June of 2019, the Virginia native was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. During her emotional speech, Elliott highlighted the importance of never giving up.\n\n“Every time I come up to a podium even with all the work that I’ve done, I don’t know, and I’m assuming it’s just God, I don’t know why I am here. I want to say one thing to the writers, to the upcoming writers, ‘Do not give up.’ We all go through writer’s block. Sometimes you just have to walk away from a record and come back to it. But don’t give up because I’m standing here. And this is big for hip hop, too.”"
