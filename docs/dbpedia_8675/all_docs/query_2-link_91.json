        "text": "Last Updated: 14/02/2023 at 10 am\n\nMissy Elliott hasn’t been on tour since 2015, and even longer since her last headlining tour. But rumours suggest that she will be ending that long hiatus. Find out what’s been said here.\n\nDubbed the “Queen of Rap” by many media outlets, Missy Elliott is an icon within the hip-hop and R&B music genre industry, with a career spanning over three decades.\n\nThe four-time Grammy Award winner is the second best-selling female rap act in history behind Nicki Minaj, but was the first to find major success doing it and paved the way for the likes of Minaj and many others who have come after her.\n\nThere have been fans calling for a new tour for many years now, but rumours now seem to suggest that their calls may be answered sooner rather than later.\n\nWith all the talk going about, we bring you the information of what is known about a possible Missy Elliott tour in 2023, including where she could go and what could be included.\n\nWhen did Missy Elliott last release new music?\n\nMissy Elliott has been releasing steady streams of singles for many years now but hasn’t released a full album since 2005.\n\nShe mainly works with other artists on collaborations, working with the likes of Lizzo in 2019 on ‘Tempo’, Anitta in 2022 with ‘Lobby’, and David Guetta with ‘Trampoline’ in 2022. Her last solo released single was in 2020 with ‘Cool Off’.\n\nDespite not releasing a studio album since 2005’s ‘The Cookbook’, which peaked at number two in the charts and is certified platinum, she has released three compilation albums and one Extended Play since then and now.\n\nThe EP, titled ‘Iconology’, was released in 2019 and was a welcome return to Elliott’s talents even still to this day. The EP was received well by critics, receiving favourable reviews, mostly equating to three out of five stars.\n\nPromotion of the album was kept to a minimum too, with Elliott only announcing the release hours prior on her social media channels.\n\nAdditionally, she was honoured at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards with the Vanguard Award and performed at the ceremony, the first time she had done so in 16 years.\n\nWhen did Missy Elliott last perform?\n\nMissy Elliott has not been on tour since 2015 when she opened for Janet Jackson at a number of shows during her ‘Unbreakable World Tour’.\n\nBefore that, her last tour was a Europe tour in 2010, where she performed at numerous festivals across the summer that year, including in the UK at Wireless and Parklife.\n\nShe has also performed at various other shows and events, such as during the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show with Katy Perry and at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nMost recently, the ‘Work It’ hitmaker performed during the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023, fueling the rumours further that she is ready to head on tour once more this year.\n\nShe also previously performed at the Let's Get Fr.EE festival in 2022 based in New York.\n\nWill Missy Elliott tour in 2023?\n\nAs mentioned, her performance at this year's Grammys, as well as her festival appearance in 2022, has brought people to believe she will be going on tour later this year, or at the very least performing a number of shows.\n\nNothing is confirmed yet in the way of a tour or any other shows except one more festival appearance this year.\n\nMissy Elliot will be performing at the Lovers and Friends festival in Las Vegas in May. This so far is her only other live performance scheduled for 2023, but it leads us to believe that something may be announced soon.\n\nWhile we know no more than that, it does seem as though Missy Elliott is getting back into the swing of live shows, so the hope is there that she will announce either a number of live shows or a full tour at some point soon.\n\nWhere will Missy Elliott’s tour go?\n\nAgain, nothing is confirmed for any live shows, especially in the UK, so everything is purely speculative.\n\nGiven that she has only performed at festivals and award ceremonies as her last live performances, it's fair to assume that she would continue to do that if she came to the UK.\n\nShe has performed at Wireless in the past, and this year's Wireless lineup does have a number of yet-to-be-announced spots. Could one be Missy Elliott?\n\nIf she does announce an arena tour though, it may see her go to some major UK venues in cities such as London, Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham, just to name a few.\n\nWhat will Missy Elliott's tour consist of?\n\nUnless she is bringing out a new album later this year (which is entirely possible after how she released her last EP), Missy Elliott would likely be performing her best songs from over the years.\n\nThis includes hits such as:\n\nWork It\n\nGet Ur Freak On\n\nLose Control\n\nThe Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\n\nPass That Dutch\n\nWith her star power and connections within the industry, she would likely have a number of other top artists join her as special guests.\n\nThis could see long-time collaborator Timbaland come out, as well as Lizzo (who is on tour herself), Ludacris, and Ciara.\n\nHow can I get tickets to Missy Elliott’s tour?\n\nIt's unknown just how popular Missy Elliott still is and whether her shows would sell quickly. But judging by the number of people who want to see her back on stage, it's safe to say each show would have a good turnout.\n\nYou can register your interest in Missy Elliott tour tickets now so show you would like to be informed of any developments if she does announce a tour or any live shows at certain venues.\n\nSeat Unique is the premium ticket marketplace helping fans access official VIP tickets and hospitality packages to a number of top music, sport and cultural events.\n\nWith these premium tickets and packages, you can experience the event you are attending in the best possible way.
