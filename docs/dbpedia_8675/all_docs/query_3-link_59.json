        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nHAMPTON, Virginia — It’s hard to believe that in 2024, legendary Hip-Hop artist and Portsmouth native Missy Elliott is headlining her first tour. This follows a 30-year career that has seen her create iconic hits, soundtracking the lives of a generation, collaborate with the biggest names in music, and innovate pop music, the industry, and the landscape for female rappers following her.\n\nBut here we are, with the Rapper, Singer, Songwriter, and Producer adding another milestone to her career with the “Out of This World – The Experience” tour, a nearly four-hour futuristic journey of Hip Hop and R&B club bangers that continues to shake the roof for generations young and old. Embarking across North America and Canada throughout this summer, Elliott stopped by her home state to rock 757’s Hampton Coliseum on Friday, Aug. 2, which was a packed house.\n\nElliott brought notable music icons along for the ride as famed Producer and Norfolk native Timbaland, a longtime music collaborator of Elliott’s, kicked off the show. Performing hit productions such as “The Way I Are,” “Give It To Me,” “Promiscuous,” and “Pony,” Timbaland showcased just how much he helped define the landscape of Pop, Hip Hop and R&B in his longtime career. His set list also included iconic songs from his work with late R&B singer Aaliyah: “Are U That Somebody?” “Try Again,” and “One in A Million.” From crowd sing-a-longs and even T-shirts depicting the beloved singer, the pain left from her 2001 passing is still deeply felt over 20 years later. Timbaland also gave fans a teaser of a dramatic unreleased track, showing that his creative mind continues to look for new ways to innovate.\n\nThings turned up a notch when R&B singer and songwriter Ciara took to the stage, dressed in stylish red streetwear and a crown cap alongside her fellow red-clad dancers. Bringing her mix of high-energy choreography and smooth vocals, the diva had the crowd hyped with hits such as “Level Up,” “Body Party,” “Ride,” “Goodies,” and the classic “1, two Step.” Before breaking into “How We Roll,” the singer enthusiastically shared her support of Elliott, her longtime collaborator and friend.\n\n“I was so excited to come here tonight guys, because I know how special this place is to my big sister,” Ciara said to the cheering audience. “Yeah, I know how special this place is, and that’s my family … when you see this magic happen in this room tonight, baby this ain’t nothing new. This is just how they roll down here in V.A. baby!”\n\nHip Hop legend Busta Rhymes, alongside Rapper Spliff Star, kept the party going with a master class of rap, bringing an old-school party atmosphere that continues to endure. Performing hits such as “What’s It Gonna Be?!” “Break Ya Neck,” “Make It Clap,” “Touch It” and “I Know What You Want,” the beloved rapper worked and engaged the crowd in a way that many of today’s entertainers struggle to do. Likewise, Busta Rhymes and Spliff Star’s back and forths in between songs were also a hilarious highlight, feeling like a mini-comedy show mixed in with a rundown of Hip Hop and Rap history.\n\nBut as good as they were, Elliott proved why she was the headliner. In an intergalactic Hip Hop spectacle, Elliott brought stylish visuals, vibrant costumes, engaged vocals and energetic choreography to the club bangers that made her a household name: “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),” “One Minute Man,” “Hot Boyz,” “Lose Control,” “Work It,” “Get Your Freak On” and much more. The nonstop sequence of songs felt like a journey of an artist’s hits rather than a put together medley, allowing each song time to breathe for fans and music enthusiasts to experience and enjoy. Despite having three artists along with her for the ride, their spots didn’t take away Elliott’s sparkle as a natural-born entertainer.\n\nThe trip home also saw Elliott have a mini-celebration as she was paid a visit by Hampton Mayor Donnie Tuck, Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, and Congressman Bobby Scott, who showed their love for the superstar. Tuck also declared that Friday, Aug. 2, 2024 has been named as “Out of This World Tour” Day while Bobby Scott presented Elliott with the Congressional Certificate of Community Service for her work in giving back to the community.\n\n“Missy, thank you for all that you do,” said Bobby Scott. “It would be a crime, a misdemeanor, not to recognize you.”\n\nDespite being 30 years into Elliott’s first tour, the Spaceship 757 proved that it is not one to be missed."
