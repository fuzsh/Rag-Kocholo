        "text": "Missy Elliott is almost as well known for her groundbreaking music videos as she is for the songs they accompany.\n\nThe rapper, whose real name is Melissa Elliott, is set to receive a prestigious award in recognition of her innovative music videos over the last 25 years.\n\nShe will take home the Video Vanguard Award at the MTV VMAs, which has previously gone to Janet Jackson, Beyonce, Kanye West, Pink, Jennifer Lopez and Michael Jackson, who the prize is named after.\n\nFor her fans, who have been campaigning for her to receive the Vanguard for several years, the acknowledgement is long overdue.\n\n\"Her presence as a full-figured black woman bursting with creativity was the kind of representation I needed growing up,\" says Leah Sinclair, online editor at The Voice. \"I'm sure many little girls like me looked on in awe to see her style, charisma and talent ooze off the screen.\n\n\"She embraced the weird and the wonderful, which was a rarity among her equally talented but hyper-sexualised peers.\"\n\nElliott went through a particularly successful period in the late 1990s and early 00s, with a positive and playful brand of hip-hop, blending her often humorous lyrics with razor-sharp beats, which she co-produced with her long-term collaborator Timbaland.\n\nShe becomes the first female rapper to win the prize. Slate, the pop culture website, has even called for the award to be renamed after her instead of Michael Jackson, who was accused of sexual abuse earlier this year in the documentary Leaving Neverland.\n\n\"When you watch a Missy Elliott video, you know you're going to get standout looks,\" wrote J'na Jefferson in Vibe in an article last year which argued she should have been recognised by MTV long ago. \"She has continued to wow us with over-the-top, yet always en vogue style and make-up.\"\n\nWe couldn't possibly rattle through all Missy's videos and outfits here, so here's a select few of the videos, outfits and concepts that have helped secure her the Vanguard prize.\n\nSinging in The Rain\n\nMissy's debut single - The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) - was released in 1997, and the song's accompanying video played a key part in making the music industry sit up and take notice.\n\nFortunately, Missy found her own solution for overcoming the bad weather she was rapping about, thanks to the huge shiny black waterproof jumpsuit she wore in the video.\n\n\"The fashion and beauty choices within this video were a love letter to classic 90s beauty trends... with a Missy twist,\" wrote Samantha Callender in Essence.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nAnyone who has lasted as long as Missy has in the music industry would need a good head on their shoulders. And Elliott is such a big fan of her own head, she often removes it from the rest of her body and inflates it, dances with it or juggles it.\n\nThe computer trickery has helped her when she just can't let her body stay in one piece. Writing about One Minute Man, Billboard's Brian Josephs said: \"The Missy-led lobby choreography is crisp, but the video pushes into classic territory when she plops her head and her body starts dancing anyways. The song's guest [Trina and Ludacris] are at home within the ensuing weirdness.\"\n\nSimilarly, Lose Control saw her head memorably appear above sand, under which the rest of her body was submerged, while Get Ur Freak On also saw her head depart her body to sing the second verse.\n\nGoing green\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

As a result, the album in places had a more reflective and sombre tone, including an entire song about Aaliyah.\n\nBut those songs contrasted with tracks that were more positive and uplifting, harking back to 1980s hip-hop. The album was heavy on samples from that decade, and the music videos for the singles also reflected the fashion of the era.\n\nOne single - Gossip Folks - had Missy kitted out in an Adidas tracksuit (although the prominent logo has been blurred for YouTube).\n\nGossip Folks wasn't even the biggest song from that album - as by the time it was released, lead single Work It had already become a worldwide smash, and remains one of her biggest hits to date.\n\nThe video for Work It showed Missy navigating a beehive one minute, while dancing in a deserted playground the next.\n\nHer backing dancers all wore hoodies with the names of R&B and hip-hop artists who had died in recent years, including 2Pac, Big Pun and Lisa \"Left-Eye\" Lopez from TLC, while Missy's own denim jacket paid tribute to Aaliyah.\n\nDrowned in sound\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .
