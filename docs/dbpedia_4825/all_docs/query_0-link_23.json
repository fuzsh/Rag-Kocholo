        "text": "A NEW round of historical research on Sigmund Freud is challenging the legend that has long surrounded the founder of psychoanalysis.\n\nNew revelations depict a Freud who seems at times mercenary and manipulative, who sometimes claimed cures where there were none, and who on occasion distorted the facts of his cases to prove his theoretical points. And, judged by current knowledge and standards, it is a Freud who, at least once, stepped over the line into malpractice.\n\nIn one little-known case that barely missed becoming a major scandal, researchers say, Freud induced two patients to divorce their spouses and marry each other. In addition, he hinted that the man should make a generous donation to his psychoanalytic fund.\n\nThe most startling discoveries, many not yet published, concern some of Freud's most important cases, including patients he referred to as ''Little Hans'' and ''Dora.''\n\n''Each of Freud's published cases plays a role in the psychoanalytic legend,'' said Frank Sulloway, a historian of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is the author of ''Freud, Biologist of the Mind,'' on the origins of Freud's theories. ''But the more detail you learn about each case, the stronger the image becomes of Freud twisting the facts to fit his theory.''\n\nThe new historical work is just the kind of inquiry that Freud dreaded. He burned many of his papers at different points in his life and destroyed most of his case notes. Although the Freud Archives at the Library of Congress recently opened most papers to scholars, some, like his letters to his future wife, Martha, remain under lock and key until at least the year 2000 at the request of the donor, Freud's daughter Anna.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
