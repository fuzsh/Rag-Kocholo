        "text": "Alexander \"Alex\" Robert Hirsch (born June 18, 1985) is an American animator, writer, producer, and voice actor. He is the creator and the executive producer of the American animated television series, Gravity Falls, for which he earned a BAFTA and Annie Awards for.\n\nAlex voiced two of the main characters in the show, Grunkle Stan and Soos, and the main antagonist Bill Cipher and also voiced supporting and recurring characters such as Old Man McGucket, the gnomes, and many others, including Quentin Trembley, Mayor Befufftlefumter, Sev'ral Timez, etc.\n\nAlex also co-authored Gravity Falls: Journal 3 in 2016, which debuted as a No. 1 New York Times Best Seller[2] and remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for forty-seven weeks.[3] In 2018, he wrote Gravity Falls: Lost Legends which also appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list.[4]\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nHirsch was born in Piedmont, California, on June 18, 1985. His parents divorced when he was young.[5] He has a twin sister named Ariel (the inspiration for Mabel Pines, with himself being the inspiration for Dipper)[6] and three half-sisters: Lauren,[7] Katrina, and Jessica. His father is Jewish, and he was raised agnostic, celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah.[8] He placed many of his real-life experiences in the show, such as living in Piedmont, California, and trick-or-treating with his sister Ariel as cats. He also based the series off the summers he and Ariel spent with their great aunt (or graunty) Lois (the inspiration for Stan Pines), at her cabin in the woods, between the ages of 9 and 13.[9] Both he and his sister wished they would go on the daring adventures that Mabel and Dipper go on in the show. He based Mabel on his twin sister, Ariel Hirsch, and Grunkle Stan off of his Grandpa Stan, and based the entire series loosely on his own childhood summers. He gave Mabel a pet pig named Waddles because his sister had always wanted one when she was young.[10]He also enjoyed going to Oregon, and went there often. He was very fond of The Simpsons as a child, and cited this as one of his main influences. After watching the episode \"Bart's Comet\", he attended child therapy.\n\nHe graduated from Piedmont High School where, as a junior, he won the school's annual Bird Calling Contest in 2002[11][12] and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman.[13]He also created a mini animated film for the event titled, Alfred Hitchcluck Presents School House Flock.[14]\n\nAlex went on to attend the Institute of the Arts (CalArts).[15] There, he created a variety of projects and short films including his senior film, Off The Wall, which combined animation and live action, Cuddle Bee Hugs N'Such with Adrian Molina, which was chosen by Nicktoons Network for their original series Shorts in a Bunch. Additional films he made there included Beach Booty, On a Roll and Imaginary Friend. Alex is also credited in working on various other films including Fools Gold by Devin Roth and with him and Sean Jimenez on Bubblebeard (which was made for the second pilot episode of Yo Gabba Gabba! but ultimately not used). He also spent the summer of 2006 working in Portland, Oregon on a later-scrapped animated film for Laika.[16] He graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.[17]\n\nCareer[]\n\nShortly after graduating, he worked at the digital entertainment studio JibJab. He later worked as a writer/storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack where he worked alongside fellow CalArts alumni, J. G. Quintel, Pendleton Ward (who was his writing partner on the show), and Patrick McHale.[18][19]\n\nWhile at CN, Alex's student films were noticed by Mike Moon; an executive at Disney. At a time when Disney Channel was looking to expand its animation production with new talent, Mike offered Alex the chance to develop a show for them. Initially not interested in making a TV show, Alex jumped on the idea, believing it to be a faster means to rise up in the industry and as a chance to develop a sort of Twin Peaks meets The Simpsons type series he imagined.[20] Alex would initially pitch three shows; one about time traveling dolphins, one about time traveling gentleman and finally the concept for what would become Gravity Falls, named after a writing exercise idea he had done with a college friend.\n\nAs part of the deal Alex made with Disney, he would help them develop an upcoming show and they would produce his. With that, Alex would go on to help the pilot for the Disney Channel series Fish Hooks along with William Reiss and serve as a creative consultant on it, as well as where he portrayed Clamantha, her father, Fumble, one of the fish police and a ferret.[1][21] Alex would, in the meantime, develop an early pitch for his show on sticky notes, after with a low budget pilot and next time on reel was made during the summer of 2010 by Toronto based animation studio House of Cool. The series, known as Gravity Falls, would be greenlit for full production in December 2010, after which Alex would hire his own team to help develop it, comprised of various college friends of his, new comers to the industry and long time members.[22]\n\nGravity Falls was inspired by Hirsch's own childhood experiences and his relationship with his own twin sister, Ariel Hirsch, growing up during their summer vacations.[23] He placed many of his real-life experiences in the show, such as living in Piedmont and trick-or-treating with his sister as kids.[24] Dipper Pines, one of the lead characters of Gravity Falls, is based on Hirsch's memory of how it felt to be a kid. When Hirsch was around Dipper's age, he attempted to teach himself backward speech by reversing recordings of his own voice.[25] Hirsch described himself as \"that neurotic kid who would carry 16 disposable cameras everywhere I went.\"[23] The character Mabel Pines was inspired by Ariel.[26] According to Hirsch, Ariel \"really did wear wacky sweaters and have a different ridiculous crush, every week\" in a similar fashion to Mabel.[23] In the series, Mabel acquires a pet pig, just like Ariel had always wanted when she was a child.[27] The character of Grunkle Stan was inspired by Hirsch's grandfather Stan, who according to him \"was a guy that told tall tales and would frequently mess with us to get a rise out of us.\"[23] Hirsch chose Oregon as the setting for Gravity Falls after spending a summer there during college working for the animation studio Laika.[28]\n\nGravity Falls ended in February 2016 after 2 seasons, as Alex went on to pursue other projects.[29] Despite some early reports of him developing an adult animated series for FOX, it was revealed by him in December 2017 that this was not the case.\n\nIn July 2016, Hirsch threw a global treasure hunt (known as \"Cipher Hunt\") for Gravity Falls fans, with clues hidden in the United States, Japan, and Russia. The goal of the hunt was to find a statue of Bill Cipher. After two weeks, fans discovered the statue in Reedsport, Oregon.[30][31] The hunt coincided with the release of Gravity Falls: Journal 3 and Dipper and Mabel and the Curse of the Time Pirates' Treasure!, which were released on July 26, 2016.[32] Journal 3 would eventually become a No. 1 New York Times Best Seller[33] and appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list for nearly a year.[34] A special edition of the book was released on June 13, 2017, and limited to 10,000 copies.[35] The Journal 3 Special Edition contains blacklight writing, parchment pages, a monocle, removable photos and notes, and other features that were not included in the regular edition of the book.[36]\n\nAt D23 in July 2017, Hirsch announced an official Gravity Falls graphic novel. Then on February 15, 2018, 2 years to the day of the series' conclusion, through a series of puzzle pieces on Twitter, the name and cover of the graphic novel were revealed. Gravity Falls: Lost Legends; 4 All-New Adventures! which was written by Hirsch was released on July 24, 2018[37] and also became a New York Times Best Seller.[38]\n\nOutside of Gravity Falls, Hirsch has done voice work for a number of animated series. He was the voice of Officer Concord the Juice Time Juice Box Flavor Cop in the \"Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror\" Phineas and Ferb.[39][40][41] He also provided additional voices to the video game Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes in late 2014. He also voiced Toby Mathews in the Rick and Morty episode, \"Big Trouble In Little Sanchez.\" Alex also voiced a Gravity Falls parody in Wander Over Yonder and the character of Ben Fotino in the Star vs. the Forces of Evil episode \"Booth Buddies.\" He also has voiced characters on We Bare Bears, Kid Cosmic, and as the announcer for the Chelsea Peretti special, One of the Greats.[42]\n\nIn August 2016, it was announced that Hirsch was in negotiations to co-write the live-action Pokémon film, Detective Pikachu, alongside Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel writer Nicole Perlman, however he later revealed on Twitter that he never wrote a page of script, and had no involvement with the film.[43][44] Hirsch was a story contributor to Sony's animated Spider-Man film,[45] Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018).[46] He also has had a voice role in The Angry Birds Movie 2, as well as a special thanks on The Super Mario Bros Movie.\n\nOn August 27, 2018, Hirsch signed a deal with American streaming company Netflix for a multi-year deal, according to Variety.[47] Alex is currently in development on an unknown adult animated series for the company that remains NDA protected as of 2022 with no known release or announcement date as of yet. As of 2022, the show remains stuck in development.[48] Despite several leaks occurring, Alex has remained tight lipped on the series and has not revealed much info regarding it since 2021.\n\nAlex has also contributed to shows and movies created by alumni from the Gravity Falls production team. He provided a guest voice roles for Big City Greens, created by former crew members Shane and Chris Houghton, as well as voiced Mr. Ponds and Frog Soos; toad and frog versions of Grunkle Stan and Soos in a Gravity Falls homage episode called \"Wax Museum\" in the second season of the Disney Channel series Amphibia, created by former Gravity Falls director and storyboard artist Matt Braly. Hirsch has also worked as the voice of King, Hooty, and additional voices on The Owl House, created by Dana Terrace, as well as serving as a creative consultant on it.[49] Alex also has served as co-executive producer on the series Inside Job alongside creator and show-runner Shion Takeuchi.[50] The first half of the first season premiered on October 22, 2021, with the second half releasing on November 18, 2022, with a second season being order on June 8, 2022.[51] However, on January 8, 2023, Takeuchi announced that the series was cancelled, which a representative from Netflix confirmed.[52][53][54] Alex also worked has worked as a story consultant and voice actor in the Sony film The Mitchells vs. the Machines that was directed by Michael Rianda and had a voice role on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which was directed by Jeff Rowe.\n\nAlex also has written a brand new book for Gravity Falls, focusing on Bill Cipher. Titled The Book of Bill, it is to release on July 23, 2024.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 2008, prior to developing Gravity Falls, Alex Hirsch worked with Joe Pitt on an animation blog project called 24 Hour Toons.[55] A theme would be posted to their website every other week at midnight on Friday, after which participants had 24 hours to make a film that followed it. It could be of any medium, so long as it was completed in 24 hours. After which, people would submit a link to the uploaded film on YouTube and it would appear on their site, if submitted within 24 hours.[56][57] It was created by them as a challenge for their colleagues to try and create something animated within a 24 hour period deadline. Several rounds of the project were held until March 2011, likely due to Alex and Joe now working on Gravity Falls and not having time to host it. The site remained up until 2018, with the last theme listed on it being Frozen. Alex himself contributed several animated short films to it, of which only 2 are known to survive; Teddy Roosevelt: You So Crazy and an unnamed film Alex made as compensation for missing that week's film, in which he just plays a minute of the 2007 film Bratz.\n\nFrom 2015 to sometime before April 2022, Hirsch was in a relationship with The Owl House creator Dana Terrace.[58][59][60][61] Hirsch and Terrace have conducted multiple charity live streams together, in which they draw cartoons to raise money for various charity organizations including Planned Parenthood,[62][63] the American Civil Liberties Union,[64][65][66] the Southern Poverty Law Center,[66] the Natural Resources Defense Council (with Ninja Sex Party and Arin Hanson),[67][68][69] Direct Relief (with Ethan Klein),[70][71][72][73] The Trevor Project (with Rebecca Sugar and Ian Jones-Quartey),[74][75] and RAICES (with Daron Nefcy and Eden Sher).[76][77][78] Altogether, these events raised over $270,000 as of 2018.[66] There have been no charity events with the two since, likely due to The Owl House's production, their relationship ending and separate work.\n\nAlex Hirsch is known to be vocal about his political views on social media (prior to Twitter's destabilization by its takeover by Elon Musk). He has made a multitude of statements in expression of those views over the years. Many of his statements have been against former US president Donald Trump during his administration and praise for views against it. In November 2020, following his defeat in that years election, Hirsch prank-called a voter fraud hotline set up by the Trump campaign, by using the voices of multiple Gravity Falls characters to report ballot theft committed by the former McDonald's mascot, the Hamburglar.[79]\n\nIn August 2020, Hirsch praised The Owl House for its LGBTQ+ representation, saying \"Back when I made [Gravity Falls], Disney forbade me from having any explicit LGBTQ+ [representation in the show]. But as of today, thanks to [Terrace] and [her] team there are explicitly queer animated main characters on Disney TV. I'm so proud and happy to say that.\"[80][81] Hirsch has praised Disney for including more LGBTQ+ representation in their shows saying, \"I applaud [Disney's] growth and I applaud every time they make the choice to represent different types of people and tell more stories, and I'm really, really hoping to see in the next few years the feature side of Disney lead that. I would love to see a Disney feature [film], either from Disney or Pixar, that's inclusive in the way that some of the TV shows have started to be.\"[81] Despite that, he also has been vocal in their ongoing negative aspects of it too. In 2022, Hirsch was one of the few creative members to call them out on it, with calling out the hypocrisy and poor handling of LGBTQ+ content across the company by either censoring or removing said content to appeal to conservative families and countries, lack of quality care and lack of the merchandise for Disney Television Animation productions from Disney Consumer Products and lack of the creative freedom with the creative members at Disney's multiple animation studios at the company.[82]\n\nDespite his political views being devise among fans and ongoing issues with Netflix regarding his upcoming series, Alex Hirsch remains a popular and respected individual within the animation community and Gravity Falls community, with a loyal following and interest for what he will make or be a part of next.\n\nWriting credits[]\n\nUnnamed episode (pilot)[]\n\nUnaired pilot\n\nSeason 1\n\n101. \"Tourist Trapped\"\n\n102. \"The Legend of the Gobblewonker\"\n\n103. \"Headhunters\"\n\n104. \"The Hand That Rocks the Mabel\"\n\n105. \"The Inconveniencing\"\n\n107. \"Double Dipper\"\n\n108. \"Irrational Treasure\"\n\n109. \"The Time Traveler's Pig\"\n\n110. \"Fight Fighters\"\n\n111. \"Little Dipper\"\n\n112. \"Summerween\"\n\n113. \"Boss Mabel\"\n\n114. \"Bottomless Pit!\"\n\n116. \"Carpet Diem\"\n\n117. \"Boyz Crazy\"\n\n118. \"Land Before Swine\"\n\n119. \"Dreamscaperers\"\n\n120. \"Gideon Rises\"\n\nSeason 2\n\n201. \"Scary-oke\"\n\n202. \"Into the Bunker\"\n\n203. \"The Golf War\"\n\n204. \"Sock Opera\"\n\n205. \"Soos and the Real Girl\"\n\n206. \"Little Gift Shop of Horrors\"\n\n207. \"Society of the Blind Eye\"\n\n208. \"Blendin's Game\"\n\n209. \"The Love God\"\n\n210. \"Northwest Mansion Mystery\"\n\n211. \"Not What He Seems\"\n\n212. \"A Tale of Two Stans\"\n\n213. \"Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons\"\n\n214. \"The Stanchurian Candidate\"\n\n215. \"The Last Mabelcorn\"\n\n216. \"Roadside Attraction\"\n\n217. \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\"\n\n218. \"Weirdmageddon 1: Xpcveaoqfoxso\"\n\n219. \"Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality\"\n\n220-221. \"Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls\"\n\nOutline credits[]\n\nSeason 2\n\n217. \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\"\n\nRoles in Gravity Falls[]\n\nStan Pines\n\nSoos Ramirez\n\nGnomes including Norman\n\nMabel Pines (Impersonating a pelican)\n\nOld Man McGucket\n\nTate McGucket\n\nDuck-tective\n\nMacaw[83]\n\nSaunterblugget Hampterfuppinshire[84]\n\nPaper Jam Dipper[85]\n\nQuentin Trembley[86]\n\nCackling skulls[87]\n\nSev'ral Timez members\n\nBill Cipher\n\nYumberjacks drive-thru cashier[88]\n\nDippy Fresh\n\nMayor Befufftlefumpter\n\nFord Pines (Impersonating Stan)\n\nShimmery Twinkleheart\n\nNate (Season 2)\n\nVarious others\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn Spring 2007, he created a short film called Off the Wall, which was one of his student films at CalArts. Mike Moon, an animation executive at Disney eventually saw it. Impressed, he asked Alex to pitch the network a television series, which eventually led to both Fish Hooks and Gravity Falls.\n\nHe based Dipper off of himself.\n\nMabel is based off of his twin sister Ariel Hirsch.\n\nHirsch has appeared a few times in the show as himself.\n\nThe bottom half of his face is visible among the photos in the opening theme song.\n\nA caricature of Hirsch is seen in \"Bottomless Pit!\" riding a unicycle, juggling some balls, at the circus, surrounded by crocodiles.\n\nOne of the guys that threw Stan and Goldie out of a casino in \"Soos and the Real Girl.\"[10]\n\nA photo of him is posted among \"Suspicious Townsfolk\" on Dipper's Author board in \"Society of the Blind Eye\" with the word: Who?\n\nOn the cover of a magazine on Stan and Ford's bunk-bed in \"A Tale of Two Stans.\"\n\nInside one of the sky trams in \"Roadside Attraction,\" alonside Rob Renzetti.\n\nAs one of the bodies in Bill's \"throne of frozen agony,\" near the middle in \"Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality.\"\n\nThe reason for Alex Hirsch's many appearances is because the crew enjoys making fun of Hirsch by putting him in the show. This was revealed in \"Between the Pines.\"\n\nAs of 2015, he was dating Dana Terrace. However, in April 2022, Dana hinted in a Tumblr drawing that they broke up.[89]\n\nAlex's college roommate was the show's art director, Ian Worrel.[90]\n\nAlex guest voiced Officer Concord for the Phineas and Ferb Halloween episode called Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror.[91]\n\nHe has joked about the rumors that he is hiding occult symbols in the show on multiple occasions, because they are hidden in plain sight.\n\nAlex has a habit of tweeting misleading \"Facts\" to trick some fans for fun.\n\nAlex prefers Nintendo over Sega and his favorite Nintendo game is Kirby's Pinball Land.[92][93]\n\nAlex named one of the Manotaurs after his full size adult taxidermy buffalo \"Beardy\"[citation needed] which he keeps in his office at Disney and insists people sit on when they take tours.[94]\n\nThe number 618 that appears throughout Gravity Falls is a reference to his birthday, June 18th (otherwise 6/18).\n\nHe created the \"McGucket Hoax\" by leaking a fake photo of Old Man McGucket writing the Journals, which fooled a lot of people into thinking that Old Man McGucket was the Author of the Journals.\n\nHirsch is skilled at bird calling and even went on the Late Show with David Letterman at the age of fifteen to share his talent.[95]\n\nHirsch has a set of rules regarding Dipper and Mabel's relationship which were created at the start of the series due to the writers frequently and incorrectly assuming that the two didn't get along. So far only two rules were revealed which were:\n\nThe first rule is that \"the kids like each other. no matter how much they get on each others nerves, this never changes.\"\n\nHis Grandfather Stan's ashes were illegally spread in a women's room in Caesars Palace so he could \"see the ladies undress forever.\"[96]\n\nHe said in 2013 Comic Con panel that his favorite creatures from the series (season 1) are the Dipper clones.[97]\n\nWhen Alex Hirsch was asked about what it's like working for Disney, he answered that working for a gigantic company is like having 20 siblings sitting at one table and fighting for food. He explained that the main problem of working with Disney is that they have a lot of projects that are much bigger than Gravity Falls and they're often too busy making merchandise for those projects to pay attention to a small part of it like Gravity Falls.[98]\n\nAlex Hirsch really loves to sleep. He didn’t sleep much for 4 years while he was making Gravity Falls, but now he can enjoy sleep at its fullest.[98]\n\nAlex has three to four flannel shirts. He started wearing them because he had a crush on a girl, but she didn't notice him until he went to a party dressed as the lumberjack mascot of \"Brawny\" paper towels. The costume was really ugly, but the girl of his dreams noticed him, and they started dating. Alex concluded that it must have been thanks to be the flannel jacket and started wearing it for luck. His family really hated the jacket and wanted him to burn it, so he promised to burn it if he ever made a TV show. After Gravity Falls came out, he, as promised, went to a desert and burned the jacket. But then he was cold, so he bought another one.[98]\n\nAlex Hirsch always helped or credited in creating merchandise for Gravity Falls. However, the newly released book Tales of the Strange and Unexpected - The Grunkle Stan edition, is the first time he hasn't been a part of in creating, writing or helping with the creation. When the book was first announced in March 2020, he stated on Twitter that he didn't know Disney Press was writing the book and shared his disappointment on how Disney hadn't reached out to him in helping, creating, or even informed him that they were working on a new Gravity Falls related book. . [99]\n\nAdam Dougherty, AKA \"Kreature Kid\" created a realistic version of Stan Pines' head. Alex Hirsch actually saw this and was quite impressed, to the point of even jokingly commenting on it with his Stan Pines voice: \"Well, here he is, ladies and gentlemen! The most attractive man in the universe! Look at that strong jaw, that...beautiful stubble—control yourself, ladies! He's spoken for!\"\n\nArticles and interviews[]\n\nPublication Date Title/Link Animation Magazine Jun 2, 2012 Tales from the Weird Side MTV Geek Jun 15, 2012 Interview: Alex Hirsch Returns To His Weird, Monster-Filled Childhood In Disney's 'Gravity Falls' Collider July 7, 2012 Creator Alex Hirsch Talks GRAVITY FALLS, How He Ended Up Making a Show for the Disney Channel, His Love for TV Animation and More GamerLive.TV Aug 4, 2012 Alex Hirsch and Jason Ritter Talk Disney Channel Gravity Falls Disney Newsreel magazine Aug 10, 2012 Feeling Gravity's Pull New York Times Aug 17, 2012 An Undercurrent of Darkness, Even at Disney TV Guide Aug 22, 2012 Watch My Show: Gravity Falls' Alex Hirsch Answers Our Showrunner Survey Boing Boing Aug 23, 2012 Interview with the creator of Gravity Falls, Disney Channel's fun new cartoon Comics Alliance Aug 24, 2012 Alex Hirsch on 'Gravity Falls,' Mabel's Sweater Collection and TV's Fear of Sincerity A.V.
