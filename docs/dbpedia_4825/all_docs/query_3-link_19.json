Nothing huge. Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic did bring the four symphonies to the United States earlier this season, and the Boston Symphony will be concentrating on familiar Brahms this summer at Tanglewood. Deutsche Grammophon is in the midst of releasing a complete edition of Brahms recordings in eight boxed sets. The Library of Congress is holding an international Brahms conference this month. In various symphony and recital programs, a note will appear to the effect that this or that piece is being played in honor of the Brahms sesquicentennial.\n\nBut on the whole, those pieces would have been played anyway. There has been no announcement of a Brahms retrospective in which less-familiar works would be unearthed. The Brahms year is being observed, but with some restraint. Brahms has not had a major biography in English, nor has this anniversary year sparked one (though there is a new book, published by Cambridge University Press - ''Brahms: Biographical, Documentary and Analytical Studies,'' edited by Robert Pascall - that is very scholarly, full of fearsomely complicated analysis and written in academese). More important will be the publication by the G. Henle Verlag in Munich of the comprehensive catalogue of Brahms's musical themes. Brahms is taken for granted, as he has been for the last few generations. It is the avant-garde creator, the rocker of the boat, the self-advertiser, the man with the loudly proclaimed Divine Mission, who, like Richard Wagner, gets all the attention.\n\nNot that Brahms is neglected in the concert hall. He has remained one of the staples of the repertory. He did not write very much orchestral music, but what he did write, starting with the four symphonies, is very much with us. Pianists continue to lust after the D minor and B flat concertos, just as violinists have to conquer the D major concerto before anybody takes them seriously. Few song recitals do not have Brahms on the program. The F minor piano quintet is ever present in chamber-music recitals, as are the clarinet quintet, the sextets and piano quartets, the three string quartets. Virtuoso pianists could not live without the ''Variations on a Theme by Paganini'' and their more serious brethren regularly trot out the F minor piano Sonata, the ''Handel'' variations and all of those wonderful short pieces from Op. 76 on. Thus, nobody is going to deny the eminent position of Johannes Brahms in the hierarchy of immortals.\n\nIn a day of high Romanticism, Brahms, too, was a Romantic - but with a difference. Where the Schumanns, Chopins, Liszts and Wagners of their day looked to the future, creating new forms and an entirely new harmonic vocabulary, Brahms was content to carry on the legacy left to him by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
