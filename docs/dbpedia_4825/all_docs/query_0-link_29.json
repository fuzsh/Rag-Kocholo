The clinical component during the first year of training is comprised of performing and assisting in oral and maxillofacial surgery at all levels of patient care, including in-patients and ambulatory patients, in both clinic and operating room settings and in the diagnostic and therapeutic phases of care.\n\nOMFS students participate in the Delivery of Clinical Care (DoCC) course where they learn the necessary skills to interact with and examine patients, and will be provided regular feedback for ultimate growth as a professional. Starting early in the first year, students will have clinical experiences both at an outpatient practice and within the continuum of care. The course extends throughout the first year of the program.\n\nAnesthesiology is a two-month rotation in the Department of Anesthesiology where the trainee functions at the resident level. The resident learns principles of anesthesia and delivers anesthesia care to patients from all surgical disciplines.\n\nYear II\n\nThe second year of OMFS training begins in July and consists of the School of Medicine’s core clinical clerkships known as Stage 2 of the medical school curriculum. The resident has no responsibilities on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service during this year. This year is divided into inpatient and outpatient clerkships\n\nof 4 or 6 weeks in length; Radiology and Geriatrics are threaded throughout specific clerkships and Homeweeks. OMFS students are required to attend the orientation to Stage 2 (called Kickoff) in late April/early May as well as the spring and fall Homeweeks A/B. Important curricular content is delivered including content which fulfills the VITAL course requirement. All students must pass the end of year clinical skills assessment before moving on to the next stage in the curriculum.\n\nStudents also complete a longitudinal continuity clinic experience within the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic under the guidance of a surgical preceptor. Students are expected to complete 36 half day sessions during their Stage 2 clinical clerkships. (see above re: Stage 2 Continuity Clinic)\n\nYear III\n\nDuring the third year, the final 10 months of medical school are completed (year 4 of medical school). Requirements include 4 weeks each of emergency medicine, critical care, a sub‐internship (acting internship), five months of elective time (three of which are OMFS), the 2‐week Transition to Residency course and the longitudinal VITAL course. Upon successful completion of these courses and another clinical skills assessment, the trainee will have fulfilled the requirements for obtaining a medical degree, which will be awarded during the regularly scheduled graduation in May. The remaining two months of the year are assigned to an anesthesia rotation.\n\nYear IV\n\nThe fourth year is a general surgery year in the UConn School of Medicine Integrated General Surgery Training Program accredited by the Residency Review Committee for Surgery of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education. This year is comprised of rotations on: general surgery, surgical specialties, trauma surgery, plastic surgery, surgery emergency room, surgery intensive care unit, and two months of oral and maxillofacial surgery.\n\nYear V\n\nThe fifth year consists of six months of continued time on the general surgery service and six months on the OMFS service. For part of the OMFS time, the resident will function at chief resident level.\n\nYear VI\n\nThe sixth year is spent as a chief resident on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service. As chief resident, the trainee has major responsibility for delivery of patient care and for leadership of junior residents. Time is spent as chief resident at each of our affiliated hospitals.\n\nSix Year Resident Schedule 2 New Residents Per Year Year 1 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - 10 months Anesthesia - 2 months Year 2 Medical School Core - 12 Months Year 3 Medical School Core 3 Months Medical School Selective 2 Months Medical School Elective 5 Months (3 Month OMFS) OMFS On service 2 Months Anesthesia - 2 months Year 4 General Surgery - 10 Months OMFS 2 Months Year 5 General Surgery - 6 Months OMFS - 6 Months (Children’s Hospital) Year 6 OMFS Chief Resident - 12 Months\n\nDidactics\n\nThroughout all segments of time assigned to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service, each resident is involved in a comprehensive and carefully planned lecture, conference, and seminar activity specifically designed to meet the educational needs of the surgeon-in-training. The didactic program consists of the following activities:\n\nInstructional Core Lectures: A 1-1/2 hour period is devoted weekly to instruction in basic medical and surgical problems as they apply to oral and maxillofacial surgery. Included is material on such disciplines as microbiology, pharmacology, radiology, as well as orthognathic surgery, trauma, infections, tumor surgery, reconstruction, preprosthetic surgery, implant surgery, and temporomandibular joint disorders.\n\nOral and Head and Neck Pathology: A one hour conference three weeks per month is devoted to a formal course in pathology of the oral and maxillofacial regions. The course is directed by full-time oral pathologists and includes lectures, CPC’s, histopathology slide sessions, and reviews of current biopsy material.\n\nJoint Orthodontic/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Seminar Series: One hour monthly is devoted to a meeting between faculty and residents of both orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery during which either a formal lecture is presented or an interesting orthognathic surgery case is jointly presented and reviewed.\n\nJournal Review and Resident Seminar: Three times monthly, current and classic articles pertaining to oral and maxillofacial surgery are reviewed at a meeting of the residents and faculty. In addition, a resident seminar is conducted during these meetings.\n\nTeaching Rounds: Residents and faculty hold weekly teaching rounds at each hospital during which in-patients and upcoming surgical patients are reviewed.\n\nTrauma Conference: Each month, a trauma conference is held which includes residents and faculty from all of the surgical services involved in trauma care.\n\nQuality Assurance Conference: A two-hour, city-wide conference is held quarterly to review complications encountered in the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Methods of prevention, recognition, and management of problems are discussed.\n\nCraniofacial Deformities Team: A four-hour meeting, including faculty and residents from the various specialties which manage major craniofacial anomalies is held bi-weekly during which patients are examined and treatment planned.\n\nTumor Board: A weekly tumor board is held and attended by faculty and residents, during which patients with malignant diseases are examined and comprehensive treatment discussed.\n\nSurgical Scope\n\nOrthognathics: Full-scope orthognathic surgery is performed in all teaching hospitals, with 75-100 cases performed annually. A surgical-orthodontics seminar in conjunction with the Department of Orthodontics occurs on a monthly basis for treatment planning, case presentation, etc. In addition, residents benefit from the involvement of Dr. Joseph Piecuch, currently the section editor of Orthognathic Surgery/Trauma/TMJ for the International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\nTrauma: The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery covers all oral, maxillofacial and craniofacial trauma for the University of Connecticut, New Britain General Hospital, Saint Francis Hospital, Hartford Hospital, and Connecticut Children’s. A monthly trauma conference is held at Hartford Hospital for discussion of recent trauma cases.\n\nTMJ: Full-scope diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the temporomandibular joints is performed throughout the residency. Treatment ranges from arthrocentesis to arthrotomy/condylectomy and reconstruction with autogenous or prosthetic sources.\n\nPathology: Extensive exposure to pathology of the head and neck occurs throughout the residency program, both while on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service, and while rotating though General Surgery/ENT. Experience in the management of both benign and malignant disease of the head and neck is gained, including their preoperative and postoperative management. In addition, residents benefit from the teaching of Dr. Ellen Eisenberg, currently the section editor of Pathology for the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\nReconstruction: Maxillofacial reconstruction is performed in all teaching institutions for post-ablative or post-traumatic injuries. Treatment ranges from simple autogenous bone grafts to autogenous free-flaps, done in conjunction with the Plastic Surgery Department.\n\nCosmetics: Full-scope facial cosmetic surgery procedures are performed with attendings from both the Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Plastic Surgery Department.\n\nCraniofacial: Residents are an integral member of the Craniofacial Team at Connecticut Children’s, and act as the only surgical resident assigned to cover the craniofacial cases. Exposure includes surgical repair of cleft lip, cleft palate, alveolar cleft repair, orthognathic surgery, distraction osteogenesis, cranioplasty for craniosynostosis, and secondary soft tissue refinements in the maxillofacial region. Surgical procedures occur every Friday, with cases by attendings from both Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Plastic Surgery.\n\nResidents are encouraged to participate in short overseas surgical programs, which are regularly organized by Dr. Topazian and Dr. Martin. Surgical scope on such trips includes dentoalveolar, cleft lip/palate and head/neck pathology. In the past, resident have been involved in programs in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Peru and Ecuador.\n\nOsseointegrated Implants: Residents are extensively involved in treatment planning / surgical placement of osseointegrated implants, and all adjunctive surgical procedures, at UConn Health and Hartford Hospital. In addition, a monthly Implant Conference is held at UConn Health in conjunction with the Departments of Periodontics and Prosthodontics.\n\nAnesthesia/Sedation: Residents are comprehensively trained in the administration of deep sedation/general anesthesia, including 4 months rotating on the University of Connecticut Anesthesia Service, acting as an Anesthesia resident at the respective teaching institutions. Residents administer approximately 600 deep sedation/general anesthetics annually.\n\nDentoalveolar: Extensive, comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis, preoperative planning, and performance of surgical extractions/preprosthetic surgery occurs on a daily basis in each teaching institution.\n\nResearch Requirements\n\nAn important and required part of the resident educational experience at the University of Connecticut Affiliated Program is submission of an abstract for the Annual AAOMS Scientific Session and preparation of a paper suitable for publication. The abstract must be submitted by April 1 of the year prior to completion of the program and the paper completed by the middle of the final year of the program. The abstract and paper may be a report of cases with literature review, a description of a new technique, an essay dealing with any significant aspect of oral and maxillofacial surgery, a report based on a research project, or any other topic approved by the faculty.\n\nBecause of the necessary deadlines, it is essential that each resident choose a topic during the second year. The subject of the paper should be discussed with the assigned faculty advisor. The project does not need to be performed with the assigned advisor; it can be done under the supervision of others among the faculty and attending surgeons community-wide; however, it is the resident’s responsibility to keep the assigned advisor informed of progress on the paper.\n\nThe project must progress to the point that by April 1 prior to the year of program completion an abstract can be prepared and submitted for presentation at the Annual AAOMS meeting; attendance at the meeting is contingent upon the submission of an abstract. The final manuscript for submission for publication will be completed by January 30 of the final year.\n\nThere are two main opportunities for research projects. First, residents may participate in ongoing faculty research projects. Second, the resident with a strong interest in a specific project will be encouraged to design such a project and will receive faculty support of his/her clinical or laboratory experimental endeavors."
