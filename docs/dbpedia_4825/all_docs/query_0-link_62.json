        "text": "Chapter 5. Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\n\nFigure 5.1 Short Run and Long Run Equilibria for a Perfectly Competitive Firm\n\nPositive profits in the short run (πSR > 0) lead to entry of other firms, as there are no barriers to entry in a competitive industry. The entry of new firms shifts the supply curve in the industry graph from supply SSR to supply SLR. Entry will occur until profits are driven to zero, and long run equilibrium is reached at Q*LR. In the long run, economic profits are equal to zero, so there is no incentive for entry or exit. Each firm is earning exactly what it is worth, the opportunity costs of all resources. In long run equilibrium, profits are zero (πLR = 0), and price equals the minimum average cost point (P = min AC = MC). Marginal costs equal average costs at the minimum average cost point. At the long run price, supply equals demand at price PLR.\n\nFigure 5.2 Monopoly Profit Maximization\n\nNote that long-run profits can exist for a monopoly, since barriers to entry halt any potential entrants from joining the industry. In the next section, we will explore market structures that lie between the two extremes of perfect competition and monopoly.\n\n5.2 Monopolistic Competition\n\nFigure 5.3 Monopolistic Competition in the Short Run and Long Run\n\nShort and long run equilibria for the monopolistically competitive firm are shown in Figure 5.3. The demand curve facing the firm is downward sloping, but relatively elastic due to the availability of close substitutes. The short run equilibrium appears in the left hand panel, and is nearly identical to the monopoly graph. The only difference is that for a monopolistically competitive firm, the demand is relatively elastic, or flat. Otherwise, the short run profit-maximizing solution is the same as a monopoly. The firm sets marginal revenue equal to marginal cost, produces output level q*SR and charges price PSR. The profit level is shown by the shaded rectangle π.\n\nFigure 5.4 Comparison of Efficiency for Competition and Monopolistic Competition\n\nFirst, there is dead weight loss (DWL) due to market power: the price is higher than marginal cost in long run equilibrium. In the right hand panel of Figure 5.4, the price at the long run equilibrium quantity is PLR, and marginal cost is lower: PLR > MC. This causes dead weight loss to society, since the competitive equilibrium would be at a larger quantity where P = MC. Total dead weight loss is the shaded area beneath the demand curve and above the MC curve in figure 5.4.\n\nFigure 5.5 Comparisons of Perfect Competition, Cournot, and Monopoly Solutions\n\nThe Cournot price and quantity are between perfect competition and monopoly, which is an expected result, since the number of firms in an oligopoly lies between the two market structure extremes.\n\nFigure 5.8 Kinked Demand Curve Model\n\nIn the kinked demand curve model, MR is discontinuous, due to the asymmetric nature of the demand curve. For linear demand curves, MR has the same y-intercept and two times the slope… resulting in two different sections for the MR curve when demand has a kink. The graph shows how price rigidity occurs: any changes in marginal cost result in the same price and quantity in the kinked demand curve model. As long as the MC curve stays between the two sections of the MR curve, the optimal price and quantity will remain the same.\n\nFigure 5.9 The Dominant Firm Model"
