        "text": "The Morgan houses one of the world’s finest collections of music manuscripts and rare printed scores. In addition to numerous musicians’ letters and first editions of scores and librettos, the holdings include one of the the largest collections of Mahler manuscripts anywhere and substantial holdings of Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Ravel, and Schoenberg. Forty thousand collection items span six centuries and many countries. The Morgan’s materials relating to the lives and works of the dramatist William S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur S. Sullivan form the most extensive archive of its kind. Significant music collections at the Morgan include the Mary Flagler Cary Collection, the James Fuld Collection, and the Robert Owen Lehman Collection on deposit.\n\nAlthough Pierpont Morgan is not on record as evincing any notable interest in music, he did make two important purchases: the two earliest dated letters of the thirteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the manuscript of Ludwig van Beethoven's Violin Sonata no. 10, op. 96, in G Major.\n\nThe Morgan's music collection is the result of the generosity of several donors and lenders. In 1962 the Dannie and Hettie Heineman Collection, a small but exceedingly well-chosen selection of music manuscripts, was placed on deposit and then formally given to the Morgan in 1977. In 1968 the institution became a major repository of music manuscripts with the donation of Mary Flagler Cary's extraordinary collection of manuscripts, letters, and printed scores. In 1972 Robert Owen Lehman put on deposit his collection of manuscript scores, the greatest private collection of its kind. In 2008 the Morgan acquired the James Fuld Collection, by all accounts the finest private collection of printed music in the world.\n\nBrowse full manuscripts in Music Manuscripts Online »\n\nBach used Wolfgang Meuslin's hymn of 1531 as his text, a poetic paraphrase of the 23rd Psalm. Bach composed some 300 Church Cantatas, 200 of which survive today, many of which he wrote as cantor of the school at Thomaskirche and director of church music in Leipzig from May 1723. These vocal compositions with instrumental accompaniments, in several movements, often involving a choir, were used in the liturgy of church services.\n\nCantata 112 has five movements, opening with a serene choral fantasia based on Nicolaus Decius's hymn \"Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr,\" (Alone to God in the Highest be Glory), composed in 1523. As Bach indicates at the top of the sheet, the cantata is scored for four voices, two horns, two oboes d'amore, two violins, a viola, and continuo. It was first performed at Leipzig's Nikolaikirche on April 8, 1731, for the Misericordias Domini, celebrated on the second Sunday after Easter. It is thought that the first movement, considered one of Bach's greatest chorale fantasies, might have been copied from an earlier draft since his penmanship on these pages is so legible and assured. The composer's handwriting becomes increasingly untidy, with many more corrections, as he hurried to complete the score."
