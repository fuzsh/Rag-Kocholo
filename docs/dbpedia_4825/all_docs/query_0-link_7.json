He is also notable for his role in the history of psychoanalysis as the father of Little Hans.\n\nContents\n\nMax Graf DJ SET en Qmulus Sound\n\nMax graff luciano cabral\n\nWorks\n\nReferences\n\nGraf's book Composer and Critic is noted for its amicable style with M. A. Schubart of the New York Times stating, \"Dr. Graf has written a charming, comprehensive, intelligent treatise on music criticism, drawing generously on his own large supply of knowledge and experience.... The only major issue which I cannot reach agreement with Dr. Graf is his manner. He is much too polite. No subject in the world deserves more rudeness than music criticism.\"\n\nIn the introduction to this book, Graf details his original interest in music criticism as having stemmed from attending the lectures of Anton Bruckner in Vienna.\n\nGraf died in Vienna."
