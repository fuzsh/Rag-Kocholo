        "text": "In this series of articles, I will address, not the specifics of how one composer worked versus another. Instead, I am going to take a bird’s eye view of the music composing process.\n\n[Update: 2019] I’ve written some more on the process of composing, and I think you’ll enjoy these articles as well.\n\nFailing Before You Start: The Pre-composition Stage\n\nEveryone’s Doing It, No One is Talking About It: Sketching Music\n\nVideo: Five Minute Speed Composing Session\n\nAll Articles and Videos on Process\n\nThe Composing Process is Personal\n\nThe music composing process is a personal one. Every composer that I have ever met, or read about, has their own unique process. Some, like Mozart, are famed for being able to compose an entire piece of music in their head, and then write it down.\n\nOthers, like Beethoven, struggle with an idea for years, putting down fragments of sketches in notebooks, only to realize the full form of the music years later.\n\nBut where are the consistencies? Is there anything that all composers do, regardless of how they execute their process?\n\nKnow Thyself: Self-Reflection\n\nMy goal is not to give you a roadmap for composing your masterpiece. If I were to attempt that, I would undoubtedly fail.\n\nMy goal is actually to give you insight into your own process of composition.\n\nOne of the great similarities between all of the great composers, was their keen intellect and ability for deep, reflective thought. Not only did they read about and discuss philosophy and the nature of the universe, religion and themselves – they were also very deeply in tune with what they needed to accomplish in their process of composing.\n\nHow Do You Get Your Best Ideas?\n\nSome composers prefer to improvise their compositions, writing freely and letting ideas flow.\n\nOther composers prefer to write down specific themes, and then let their subconscious come back to them later.\n\nStill other composers would work out their music systematically, step by step, using formulas and mathematical equations.\n\nNone of these methods are better or worse than any other. The end result still needs to be music you composed that you can live with, and hopefully enjoy.\n\nIn fact, they are really just ways of generating ideas. Generating ideas is only one step in the process.\n\nMusical Inspiration\n\nFirst, all music must be initially inspired, whether in complete form, in fragments or even in the idea of mathematical equations.\n\nWithout an initial spark, or “fantasy,” as Max Graf calls it, there is no music. This is the inspiration that brings us to compose.\n\nHow composers get this inspiration is as varied as the musical product themselves. Some get it from reading, others observing the world. Many have inspirations from life events.\n\nInspiration may not be in the form of a flash of brilliance in your mind. It may be one note. Or maybe a rhythm. It may just be a word describing an emotion – love, hate, fear. Whatever the inspiration is, you must be able to recognize it.\n\nInspiration may not also come immediately. Many composers are fond of writing down many ideas, improvising, or just playing freely until they hear something they like. Then they’ll write it down or play around with it.\n\nWhat About When I Have No Inspiration?\n\nSometimes, you will not have inspiration. What do you do? You need to stir your imagination. What works for me, is to feed myself with as man sources of potential inspiration as possible. I read about music theory, I try new techniques, I listen to new composers, I’ll play different instruments… but most importantly, I’ll force myself to write down music.\n\nIf you write down music, ideas will come eventually. Sometimes you have to work to be inspired.\n\nRemoving Inhibition\n\nSometimes inspiration is not enough. If it were, then everyone would be a great composer. That is because everyone is inspired by something. Everyone has emotions and almost everyone wants to express themselves in the most true way possible. But the great composer has to be able to do one thing above and beyond others. This is the suppression or even removal of inhibition.\n\nInhibition, or letting the conscious mind throw away ideas before they have germinated into something more powerful, is the enemy of inspiration. Some composers struggle with this more than others, but all great composers have come up with a process of removing inhibition from their minds while composing.\n\nThe first sketches of an inspiration may not be the best you can make with that inspiration. Inhibition will prevent you from even getting those first sketches down.\n\nRaising Your Composition Like a Child\n\nComposing can sometimes be like raising a child. You give birth, and it is the most beautiful thing in the world.\n\nBut after a few hours, you realize that this little thing, poops, cries, scratches, needs to eat, and seems to wake up immediately after you fall asleep.\n\nBut if you tend to its needs, feed it, change it, love it, teach it – you will end up with another fully formed soul, that lives on its own. It creates its own magic.\n\nComposing is the same. Do not suppress your inspiration. There will be plenty of time in the future to say whether or not an idea is worth pursuing. For now, just go with it.\n\nLeave a comment about how you find inspiration and remove inhibition."
