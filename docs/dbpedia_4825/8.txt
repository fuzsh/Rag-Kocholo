Graf Orlock will be issuing what they are describing as their final effort, “End Credits“, on June 23rd. A song from that outing by the name of “Mega City Blues” has emerged online in advance below.

The band commented on this apparent final chapter of their sonic output:

“This record specifically focuses on the apocalypse. Given it will be the last release, it looks like a script that has caught on fire. Songs/films covered in this are Snowpiercer, Children Of Men, Mad Max, Dredd, and Waterworld. Although there seems like a proliferation of post-apocalypse or dystopian films in light of the last couple of years, all of these songs/films/lyrics predate COVID. On top of that, in the style of how the songs/lyrics are put together, typical Jason and Kyle are representing different characters in any given script, transferred into song lyrics.”

Pre-orders for the effort are available via Bandcamp.
