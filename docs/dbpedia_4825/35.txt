Graf Orlock is back with one final release, a 5-track EP called End Credits, out June we via Vitriol Records.

Formed roughly 20 years ago, the band, whose members also play in Ghostlimb, Sweat, Dangers, Daisy Chain, and more, has previously released 5 LPs and 7 EPs.

“This record specifically focuses on the apocalypse. Given it will be the last release, it looks like a script that has caught on fire. Songs/films covered in this are Snowpiercer, Children Of Men, Mad Max, Dredd, and Waterworld. Although there seems like a proliferation of post-apocalypse or dystopian films in light of the last couple of years, all of these songs/films/lyrics predate COVID. On top of that, in the style of how the songs/lyrics are put together, typical Jason and Kyle are representing different characters in any given script, transferred into song lyrics,” the band says in a statement.

Oh, and listen to "Mega City Blues" from the upcoming EP here.

Upcoming shows:

July 22 - Los Angeles, CA @ Slipper Clutch

Sept 16 - NY, NY @ Saint Vitus

Dec 16 - Anaheim, CA @ Chain Reaction
