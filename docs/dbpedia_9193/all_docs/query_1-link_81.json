        "text": "After the tour of Arbanassi I left for Veliko Tarnovo, it began to rain. I arrived at Veliko Tarnovo 3:00pm, it continued to rain.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is a city in north central Bulgaria and the administrative centre of Veliko Tarnovo Province.\n\nSamovodska Charshia (market) square is where the people of nearby Samovoska village came to sell their home-grown produce in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nAfter taking a short rest in the hotel, I went out for a walk in the evening.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is located on the Yantra River and is famously known as the historical capital of the Asen Dynasty, Second Bulgarian Empire, between 1187 and 1256. With its unique architecture, it is attracting many tourists.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo, with a population of 72,938 inhabitance, is an important administrative, economic, educational, and cultural centre of Northern Bulgaria.\n\nThe next morning I went out to explore the historical town of Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nThe monument of Mother Bulgaria is dedicated to those killed in 4 wars – Russo-Turkish 1877-1878 Serbo-Bulgarian 1885, Balkan wars 1912-1913 and First World War.\n\nIn the crypt of the memorial eternal flames are burning, and on top of it the statue of Mother Bulgaria is kneeling with flag in hand. The memorial complex is built in the flower garden with benches.\n\nTsarevets is a medieval stronghold located on a hill with the same name in Veliko Tarnovo. It served as the Second Blugarian Empire’s primary fortress and the strongest bulwark from 1185 to 1393, housing the royal and the patriarchal palaces.\n\nThe Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is a former Eastem Orthodox cathedral in the city of Veliko Tarnovo. Located on top of the fortified Tsarevets hill in the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the cathedral was the seat of the Bulgarian patriarch from its construction in the 11th–12th century to its destruction in 1393.\n\nThe cathedral was mentioned in a number of medieval sources. One of the earliest described the transfer of the relics of Saint Michael the Warrior to the cathedral on the order of Tsar Kaloyan, who ruled 1197-1207. In the late 14th century the last Patriarch of Tarnovo, Saint Evtimiy, referred to it in his writings as the “great patriarch’s Cathedral of the Holy Ascension.”\n\nThe cathedral was destroyed along with everything else in the fortress when the Ottomans captured it in 1393. It was fully reconstructed in 1978-1981, which you will note was during the communist rule of Bulgaria.\n\nI got back to the square of Bulgaria Mother and will be going to roam the old town of Veliko Tarnobo from now on.\n\nI arrived at the boundary between old town and new town, the houses are densely packed on the slope beyond the Yantra River.\n\nI’m going to the monument of the Asen Dynassty and will take some photos.\n\nThe Asen dynasty founded and ruled a medieval Bulgarian state, called in modern historiography the Second Bulgarian Empire, between 1187 and 1256.\n\nThe Asen dynasty rose as the leaders of Bulgaria after a rebellion against the Byzantine Empire at the turn of the year 1185, 1186 caused by the increase in the Imperial taxes.\n\nIt is time to part from Veliko Tarnovo. Farewell! After this I’m going to the next distination Kazanlak, Bulgaria.\n\nA celebrity from Veliko Tarnovo; Sumo wrestler Kotoōshū Katsunori (琴欧洲 勝紀), his legal name is “Karoyan Andō,” Who was born February 19, 1983 as Kaloyan Stefanov Mahlyanov in veliko tarnovo, Bulgarian.\n\nIn January 2014 Kotoōshū obtained Japanese citizenship, a requirement of becoming an elder in the Japan Sumo Association, and he announced his retirement during the following tournament in March. In April 2017 he opened his own training stable, Naruto."
