        "text": "Veliko Tarnovo (Bulgarian: Велико Търново, sometimes transliterated as Veliko Turnovo) is a city in north central Bulgaria and the administrative centre of Veliko Tarnovo Province. Often referred to as the «City of the Tsars», Veliko Turnovo is located on the Yantra River and is famous as the historical capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, attracting many tourists with its unique architecture.\n\nThe old city is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa and Sveta Gora raising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. Tsarevets housed the palaces of the Bulgarian Emperors and the Patriarchate, as well as a number of administrative and residential edifices surrounded by thick walls. Trapezitsa was known for its many churches and as the main residence of the nobility. In the Middle Ages it was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the Tarnovo Artistic School of architecture, painting and literature.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is an important administrative, economic, educational and cultural centre of Northern Bulgaria.\n\nPrehistory and Antiquity\n\nVeliko Tarnovo above the Yantra River\n\nMap of medieval Tarnovo\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, having a history of more than 5 millennia, as the first traces of human presence dating from the 3rd millennium BC are on Trapezitsa Hill.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nVeliko Tarnovo grew quickly to become the strongest Bulgarian fortification of the Middle Ages between the 12th and 14th century and the most important political, economic, cultural and religious centre of the empire. The city was described by Bulgarian cleric Gregory Tsamblak in the 14th century as \"a very large city, handsome and surrounded by walls with 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants«[1].\n\nIn the 14th century as the Byzantine Empire weakened, Tarnovo claimed to be the Third Rome based on its preeminent cultural influence in the Balkans and the Slavic Orthodox world.\n\nAs the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Tarnovo was a quasi-cosmopolitan city, with many foreign merchants and envoys. It is known that Tarnovo had Armenian, Jewish and Roman Catholic («Frankish») merchant quarters[1] besides a dominant Bulgarian population. The discovery of three Gothic statuette heads indicates there may have also been a Catholic church.[2]\n\nOttoman rule\n\nView over Veliko Tarnovo and the surrounding area in the morning\n\nTsarevets and Stara Planina as seen from the village of Arbanassi\n\nKolyu Ficheto's imposing Cathedral of the Birth of the Theotokos, completed 1844 and reconstructed 1913\n\nThe city flourished and grew for 200 years. Тhe political upsurge and spiritual development were discontinued in 1393 on 17 July, when after vigorous resistance to a 3-month siege Veliko Tarnovo was seized and the whole Bulgarian Empire was destroyed by the invader — the Ottoman Empire. Medieval Bulgaria's towns and villages, monasteries and churches, were burnt to ashes.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo, known in the Middle Ages as Tarnovgrad (Търновград) and known during the Ottoman rule as Tırnova, was the location of two uprisings against Ottoman rule, in 1598 (the First Tarnovo Uprising) and 1686 (the Second Tarnovo Uprising), both of which failed to liberate Bulgaria. Tarnovo was a district (sanjak) centre at first in Rumelia Province (eyalet), after that in Silistria Province and finally in Danube Province before becoming part of the Principality of Bulgaria.\n\nTarnovgrad (Tırnova to Ottomans), along with the rest of present-day Bulgaria, remained under Ottoman rule until the 19th century, when national identity and culture reasserted themselves as a strengthening resistance movement. The idea of the establishment of an independent Bulgarian church and nation motivated the 1875 and 1876 uprisings in town. On 23 April 1876, the April Uprising marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman occupation. It was soon followed by the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).\n\nSamovodska Charshiya Street in the Old Town.\n\nLiberated Bulgaria\n\nOn 7 July 1877, Russian general Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko liberated Veliko Tarnovo, ending the 480-year-rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin created a Principality of Bulgaria between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nOn 17 April 1879, the first National Assembly convened in Veliko Turnovo to ratify the state's first constitution, known as the Tarnovo Constitution, the key result of which resulted in the transfer of Parliament from Tarnovgrad to Sofia, which today remains the Bulgarian capital.\n\nIn deference to the city's past, Tsar Ferdinand Saxe-Coburg Gotha chose the St Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo as the place to declare the complete independence of Bulgaria on 5 October 1908.\n\nIn 1965, the city, then officially known as Tarnovo, was renamed to Veliko Tarnovo (Great Tarnovo) to commemorate its rich history and importance.\n\nMain sights\n\nOne of Bulgaria's primary tourist destinations, Veliko Tarnovo boasts many historical monuments and landmarks, such as\n\n* ruins of the castle Tsarevets on the hill of the same name, which housed the royal and patriarchal palace\n\n* Trapezitsa, the second fortress of the inner city on the right bank of Yantra\n\n* Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki\n\n* SS.
