        "text": "By train\n\n[edit]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the major stops on Line 4, which runs north-south from Ruse on the Danube to Stara Zagora in Southern Bulgaria, crossing the Balkan Mountains. Veliko Tarnovo is also very close to Gorna Oryahovitsa (less than 10 km (6.2 mi)), a smaller town known mostly as the junction between that line and the Sofia-Varna line, which runs east-west along the whole length of Northern Bulgaria, from the capital to the Black Sea.\n\nIt's possible to get to Veliko Tarnovo by rail from both Romania and Turkey. Between June and September, the Bosphorus Express international overnight train runs between Bucharest and Istanbul, once daily in each direction (about 21 hr end-to-end). From Bucharest, it departs from the Bucuresti Nord station, crosses the border at Ruse, and takes about 7 hr to Veliko Tarnovo; from Istanbul, it departs from the Halkalı station (not Istanbul's central station!), passes through Çerkezköy and Edirne, and takes about 14 hr to Veliko Tarnovo. Another option for Bucharest is buying a ticket to Gorna Oryahovitsa on the Bucharest-Sofia train (also once daily Jun-Sep). Off-season, rail travel requires changing trains at the border crossings.\n\nMany national trains to Veliko Tarnovo require changing at Gorna Oryahovitsa; in that case, it can be more convenient to just buy a ticket to that town and then take a bus, minibus or taxi from Gorna Oryahovitsa station to Veliko Tarnovo. Assuming that your destination is the tourist information centre on Mother Bulgaria Sqr (ploshtad Mayka Bulgaria), the most direct route is almost exactly 11 km (6.8 mi) long and the taxi fare should be between 8 and 14 лв.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the main roads in Bulgaria runs through the city, so car transport is not a problem to and from the city. Since the town is located relatively in the centre of Bulgaria, it is quite comfortable to stop there for an hour to rest and get a glimpse of the sights.\n\nDriving into and in the New Town is easy, but the roads in the Old Town are smaller, windier, and weren't designed for modern auto traffic, so it'll be easier to travel in the Old Town on foot. Also, you can't drive directly into the Old Town without first driving through the New Town. Bulgarian highway E85 tunnels under the old town as it follows the Yantra River, but it doesn't have direct access to Veliko Tarnovo at the tunnels.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBusses run approximately hourly from Sofia. Several buses daily run from Plovdiv north bus station (18 лв) and from Varna. The small bus station is ~1 km from the centre of town so arrange pickup during winter. The ticket for the busses, departing from Sofia to Tarnovo, costs about 25 лв. The Biomet coach tickets can be bought online (english website).\n\nThere are two minibuses per day to and from Plovdiv. They depart from Bus Station North in Plovdiv at 08:30 and 16:30, and take around four hours. Drop off is on the western edge of Veliko Tarnovo at a somewhat unofficial bus station."
