        "text": "Located in Bulgaria’s heart, Veliko Tarnovo is a testament to the rich tapestry of history, culture, and natural beauty that defines this enchanting Balkan country. With its cobbled streets and medieval architecture, this picturesque town invites visitors to step back in time and immerse themselves in an experience that transcends the ordinary.\n\nPerched on three hills, this city is a cultural gem that seamlessly weaves its historical significance with breathtaking natural beauty. For those passionate about history, Veliko Tarnovo stands as the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, offering a captivating journey through time. Today, it is a thriving student city with a youthful energy that seamlessly blends old and new.\n\nEmbarking on a journey to Veliko Tarnovo from Sofia is a breeze, and we recommend the freedom of a rented car for a fast route with a scenic drive. Most car rentals are very cost-efficient, but for best offers, check out CarRental.deals.\n\nFor those opting for guided tours with Balkan Trails, you should know private transportation is seamlessly arranged throughout your entire tour, ensuring a hassle-free exploration. We advise against taking the train but suggest exploring bus options for convenience and faster rides.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo: Historical Marvels\n\nFormer Capital City\n\nUnearthed by archaeologists, Veliko Tarnovo reveals evidence of a thriving settlement dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE, solidifying its status as one of the oldest cities in Europe. The layers of history embedded in its soil speak volumes about the enduring legacy of this ancient town.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo experienced its zenith during the 12th century when it gained independence from the Byzantine Empire. This period marked the town’s golden era, flourishing for approximately two centuries until succumbing once more to Turkish occupation.\n\nIn a pivotal turn of events, the town regained its freedom in 1877, becoming the capital of Bulgaria for a brief yet significant two-year span before relinquishing the title to Sofia. This tumultuous historical journey shapes Veliko Tarnovo into a compelling destination, where each cobblestone and fortress wall whispers tales of resilience and transformation across the ages.\n\nThe Tsarevets Fortress\n\nPerched majestically atop the hills overlooking Veliko Tarnovo, the Tsarevets Fortress is an iconic symbol of Bulgaria’s medieval glory. Dating back to the 12th century, this formidable fortress served as the stronghold of the Second Bulgarian Empire, playing a pivotal role in the nation’s history.\n\nThe fortress is a captivating blend of architectural prowess and historical significance, surrounded by robust stone walls that once witnessed the ebb and flow of medieval power struggles. Within its fortified confines, visitors can explore the remains of royal palaces, churches, and administrative buildings, each stone bearing the weight of centuries of political intrigue and cultural richness.\n\nReady for a more futuristic experience in such an old structure? Try the dramatic music, multicolored lights, lasers, and chiming bells synchronized in a unique display: The Sound & Light show! This show projects a dazzling display of colored lights coordinated with sounds and music over the Tsarevets Fortress for an unforgettable viewing experience. This is a great thing to do with children, but it is just as entertaining if it’s just adults in attendance!\n\nEntry to the site for adults is priced at 10 Lev and is a worthwhile investment. Visitors can explore the fortification, towers, and various fortress buildings. The panoramic views from the battlements are exceptional, providing an excellent backdrop for capturing memorable photographs. Note that the fortress is set on a hill with a lot of uneven pavement, so good, closed-toe shoes are essential when you explore here.\n\nThe Asenov Quarter\n\nExplore the oldest part of the town in the Asenov Quarter, home to the famous Church of the Holy 40 Martyrs and the intriguing Trapezitsa Fortress ruins. Nestled beneath Tsarevets Hill, the Asenov Quarter emerges as a flourishing hub of creativity in Veliko Tarnovo, making it the ideal destination for those seeking an immersive cultural and artistic experience. This vibrant neighborhood boasts numerous art galleries, studios, and holistic initiatives, creating a dynamic space that celebrates and fosters creativity in various forms.\n\nTrapezitsa Fortress\n\nPerched atop the picturesque Trapezitsa Hill near Veliko Tarnovo, the Trapezitsa Fortress stands as the second tower of the medieval Bulgarian capital, Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nPositioned strategically on the Yantra River’s right side, the fortress boasts natural defenses with rocky slopes and cliffs. Trapezitsa is debated, with some associating it with “table” and others with its trapezoidal-shaped shelf. Excavations in 1884 and 1900 revealed the foundations of 17 churches adorned with frescoes and colorful mosaic floors. Notably, Church No. 8, known as “Ivan Rilski,” housed relics brought by Tsar Ivan Asen I in 1195, offering a glimpse into Trapezitsa’s rich history as a center of nobility and senior clergy.\n\nThe Old Town\n\nVarusha, also known as Veliko Tarnovo’s Old Town, unfolds as a labyrinth of narrow, meandering streets, ancient residences, and breathtaking panoramas. Strolling through this remarkable district feels like a journey through history, immersing you in its unique architectural charm and serene atmosphere. Your time in the enchanting Old Town is certain to be a cherished experience, where every corner reveals a glimpse of the past, inviting you to savor the beauty of a bygone era.\n\nGurko Street, a captivating thoroughfare in Veliko Tarnovo, features traditional Revival Period houses tightly clustered along a steep slope with stunning views of the Yantra River below. The street uniquely blends architectural beauty with nature, offering a mesmerizing glimpse of Bulgarian houses perched on the hill and the Yantra’s meandering path around Sveta Gora Hill, the Boris Denev Gallery, and the Asenevtsi Monument.\n\nSarafkin’s house stands as an architectural gem in Veliko Tarnovo, situated on the historic Gurko Street, contributing to the town’s old revival charm. Originally built in 1861 for the boyar trader Dimo Sarafina, it later became renowned as Sarafkin’s house under the ownership of his wife, Anastasia Sarafkata. In 1981, the house underwent restoration and became part of the Regional Historical Museum-Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nToday, it houses the exhibition “Folk Art of Turnovo’s Region,” showcasing the distinctive features of national art prevalent in Veliko Tarnovo during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The fourth floor hosts separate exposition halls featuring “Crafts,” “Folklore Costumes, Clothes, and Ornaments,” and “Ritual Objects.\n\nThe Stambolov bridge\n\nA historical landmark from 1892. The monument is about 700-800 meters away from the center of the historic area, so it shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes to get here by foot. The first freestanding cast iron bridge in Bulgaria spans a bend of the Yantra River in Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nLegend has it that upon completing the bridge, master builders and workers adhered to Bulgarian tradition, sitting beneath it as the first fully loaded ox and horse carts crossed, symbolizing their confidence in the soundness of their work. In a daring stunt on May 24, 1932, Bulgarian ace pilot Petko Popganchev flew his plane under the bridge, captivating onlookers who cheered and applauded. Some suggest this audacious feat was an unsuccessful attempt to impress a local lady.\n\nThe Mini Bulgaria Park\n\nNot really a historical marvel… yet! But cool enough to be on this must-see list of landmarks!\n\nSituated in close proximity to Veliko Tarnovo’s primary cultural gem, the medieval stronghold Tsarevets, Mini Bulgaria Park, offers a unique perspective right under Baldwin’s Tower. It showcases miniature replicas of Bulgaria’s most iconic landmarks and attractions.\n\nAmong them are the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and the Ivan Vazov National Theatre in Sofia, the Monastery of St. Ivan of Rila, the Bachkovo Monastery of the Dormition of the Theotokos, as well as various palaces and strongholds from Bulgaria’s rich history. This miniature haven allows visitors to marvel at the country’s diverse architectural wonders in one centralized location.\n\nOff-the-beaten-path adventures\n\nArbanassi village\n\nArbanasi, a village just four kilometers from Veliko Tarnovo, boasts a rich history dating back to the 15th century.
