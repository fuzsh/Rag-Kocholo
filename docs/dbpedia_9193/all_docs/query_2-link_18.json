        "text": "All you have to do is just to Like Bulgaria.\n\nBulgaria is located North of Greece and Turkey. And South of the famous Danube which flows through four of Europe's most beautiful capital cities so it can flow into Bulgaria's East border - the Black Sea.\n\nThe sea that the Argonauts had to cross in the quest to find the Golden Fleece. The same Euxeinos Pontos by which shore Ovid was exiled.\n\nThe land that is contemporary Bulgaria was first developed by the Neolithic Era, although human activity can be dated back to the Paleolithic. Two of Europe's oldest cities were established more than 6,000 years ago and are still alive today, being Bulgaria's pride.\n\nThan came the era of Thracians and later the Greeks and Romans. Which were followed by the Bulgars and the First Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantine Empire, Second Bulgarian Empire when the Crusades were crossing the world. Followed by almost 5 centuries as part of the Ottoman Empire and the last 200 years of being a kingdom, a Socialist State and currently EU state.\n\nDefinitely the place where you'll feel the old 'The East meets the West', where the Eastern Orthodoxy meets the Islam. The place where the North spirit meets the South soul.\n\nWhat to see?\n\nSofia\n\nAlthough no grand metropolis, Sofia is nevertheless an attractive and cultured city with plenty to keep you busy for several days or more. Museums, art galleries, theatres, fine restaurants, they’re all here. Sofia is also a surprisingly green city, with huge swaths of parkland within the city boundaries and the ski slopes and hiking trails of mighty Mt Vitosha right on the doorstep.\n\nPlovdiv\n\nPlovdiv's history spans 6,000 years, with traces of a Neolithic settlement dating to roughly 4000 BC, ranking it among the world's oldest cities. Plovdiv was known in the West for most of its recorded history by the Greek name Philippopolis, which was introduced in 340 BC. Plovdiv was originally a Thracian city before later becoming a Greek and a major Roman one. In the Middle Ages, it retained its strategic regional importance, changing hands between the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires. It came under Ottoman rule in the 14th century. In 4 January 1878, Plovdiv was liberated from Ottoman rule by the Russian army and was within the borders of Bulgaria until July, the same year, when it became the capital of an autonomous Ottoman region of Eastern Rumelia. In 1885, it and Eastern Rumelia itself became part of Bulgaria.\n\nPlovdiv is situated in south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the Maritsa River. The city has historically developed on seven syenite hills, some of which are 250 m (820.21 ft) high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as \"The City of the Seven Hills\".\n\nThe city has more than 200 archaeological sites, 30 of which are of national importance. There are many remains from antiquity – Plovdiv is among the few cities with two ancient theatres; remains of the medieval walls and towers; Ottoman baths and mosques; a well-preserved old quarter from the National Revival period with beautiful houses, churches and narrow paved streets. There are numerous museums, art galleries and cultural institutions. Plovdiv is host to musical, theatrical and film events.\n\nThe Ancient theatre is probably the best-known monument from antiquity in Bulgaria. It was built in the beginning of the 2nd century during the reign of the Roman Emperor Trajan. It is situated in the natural saddle between the Dzhambaz Tepe and Taksim Tepe hills. It is divided into two parts with 14 rows each divided with a horizontal lane. The theatre could accommodate up to 7,000 people.\n\nRila Monastery\n\nRila Monastery is the most important spiritual and literary center of the Bulgarian national revival, with an uninterrupted history from the Middle Ages until present times.\n\nRila Monastery was founded in the 10th century by St John of Rila, a hermit canonized by the Orthodox Church. His ascetic dwelling and tomb became a holy site and were transformed into a monastic complex which played an important role in the spiritual and social life of medieval Bulgaria. Destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 19th century, the complex was rebuilt between 1834 and 1862. A characteristic example of the Bulgarian Renaissance (18th–19th centuries), the monument symbolizes the awareness of a Slavic cultural identity following centuries of occupation.\n\nIn its complicated ten-century history the Rila monastery has been the hub of a strong spiritual and artistic influence over the Eastern Orthodox world during medieval times (11th-14th c.). Under Ottoman rule (1400-1878) the monastery influenced the development of the culture and the arts of all Christian nations within the Ottoman Empire. With its architecture, frescos etc. it represents a masterpiece of the creative genius of the Bulgarian people.\n\nArchitectural styles have been preserved on the property as historical monuments of considerable time span (11th-19th c.). The basic architectural appearance is now one of the peak examples of building craftsmanship of the Balkan peoples from the early 19th c. As such it has exerted considerable influence on architecture and aesthetics within the Balkan area.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo\n\nVeliko Turnovo, the medieval capital of Bulgaria, is brought to you with more than 5000 years of history. The houses, stacked one above the other, situated on the slopy hills of the town show a remarkable, unique architectural style. The bridges, unexpectedly flying over the river, palaces and towers, spectacular museums, ancient columns with writings left by our proud rulers, monasteries with unique murals and the Arbanassi fortress-houses.\n\nThe nights are filled with the constant voice of the river, the glitters and dazed lights, playing on the fairy face of the town and the noise of the energy-filled stormy student's life.\n\nFrom its rich historical value, to its thriving modern nightlife and lush natural surroundings that provide many excellent opportunities for outdoor recreational activities, Veliko Turnovo offers you everything you could ever want for the perfect holiday.\n\nMagura Cave\n\nThe Magura Cave is one of the largest and most beautiful caves in Bulgaria. It consists of the main gallery and three side branches. The overall length of the cave is approximately 2500 meters.\n\nAccording to geological studies, The Magura Cave began to take shape about 15 million years ago. In one of the caverns prehistoric paintings have been discovered, carved into the walls and decorated with bat guano (droppings). The paintings depict the silhouettes of women, men dancing and hunting, people wearing masks, animals, stars, tools, and plants. The paintings date from different eras – the early Paleolithic, the Neolithic, the later Neolithic, and the beginning of the Bronze Age. A solar calendar from the late Neolithic found there is the earliest solar calendar discovered in Europe. It is painted on the walls of the sanctuary hall and depicts 5 festivals and 366 days.\n\nThe cave offers one of the richest collections of geological formations, of all shapes and sizes – stalactites, stalagmites, columns, Geodesic formations, cave pearls, and flows of “cave milk”.\n\nThe remarkable Giant Column is over 20 meters high on a 4-meter base. The Fallen Pine is another of the largest stalagmites discovered in Bulgaria’s caves, with a length of over 11 meters and a base that has a diameter of 6 meters.\n\nThe cave is used to make sparkling wine, since the conditions in the cave are similar to those required to produce French champagne.\n\nNear the cave is Rabisha Lake – the largest inland lake in Bulgaria, with a depth of 35-40 meters. The lake is the result of tectonic activity, and the lake and surrounding area, ideal for windsurfing, swimming, hunting, and fishing, are among the country’s most preferred tourist destinations."
