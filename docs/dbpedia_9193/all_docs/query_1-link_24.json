Located in Center Northern Bulgaria, at 221 km from Sofia and 226 km from the Black Sea, Veliko Tarnovo is a place to visit.\n\nWhen I visited the first time Veliko Tarnovo in August 2014, I have never heard of it before and to be totally honest with you I had not organized anything. After, when I opened a guide, I was ashamed to have passed next to so much history and places to visit… I decided to go back and to visit it. It was a real surprise to discover there were a lot of nice places in town and surroundings.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is known as « The Queen of Bulgarian cities ». This historical city is set amidst an amphitheatre of forested hills, in the hollow between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains, divided by the ribboning Yantra River, whose meanderings form 3 peninsulas (Tsarevets, Trapezitsa and Sveta Gora), forming an improbable and atypical area.\n\nThe town is remained in the Bulgarian History and collective memory as the majestic and flourishing capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire. In fact, in 1185, the city became the capital of the Bulgaria State restored by the brothers – boyars Assen & Petar. Those announced the end of Byzantine rule in Bulgaria, which lasted 167 years. For centuries, it was the political, administrative, cultural and spiritual centre of Bulgaria, while the city developed very quickly. Remarkable architectural monuments – as an impregnable fortress -, literature, arts, crafts and painting were created there. Veliko Tarnovo houses are arranged on the heights of the Pre-Balkan, stacked one above the other, situated on the slopy hills of the town show a remarkable, unique architectural style, an imaginary amphitheater.\n\nToday, Veliko Turnovo is an administrative, cultural, historical, tourist and a student centre of Bulgaria.\n\nThe city is a geographical and communication center of the Northern Bulgaria.

Then, it is also the site of Bulgaria’s most prestigious universities with the “Saint Cyril and Methodius” University and the “Vasil Levski” National Military University of Bulgaria. Its population numbers approximately 89 000 inhabitants.
