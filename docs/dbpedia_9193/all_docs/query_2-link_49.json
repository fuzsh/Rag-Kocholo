        "text": "In Sliven, I have my only and last meal in the restaurant at the Park Central Hotel. The staff allowed me to taste the samples of Rossidi wines Eddie gave me, along with a glass of Pinot Noir by Edward Miroglio, another nearby winery. Edward Miroglio not only owns the winery that bears his name, but he also owns this hotel. Miroglio is an Italian textile producer who left his native country of Italy and moved his factories and business to Bulgaria some twenty years ago. Shortly after, he purchased property, planted vines, and invested in his winery.\n\nThe next morning I make my way to Veliko Tarnovo, once the capital of Bulgaria. It’s also the city where in 1879, after its liberation from the Ottoman’s, the country’s first parliament met and adopted the Bulgarian Constitution. At that time, they also voted to relocate the capital to its current home in Sofia.\n\nThe ride to Veliko Tarnovo takes me to the far end of the Thracian Valley and up into the mountains. Fierce and strong headwinds push the bike around, and I have to tuck further behind the small fairing of Doc to give my neck relief and keep my helmet from bouncing around. The winds die as I climb the mountain roads, going through a series of switchbacks.\n\nAs I roll into Veliko Tarnovo, I cross several bridges, and I’m taken back, but the scenic hills dotted with homes, churches, and other impressive buildings. Nestled along the Yantra River, Veliko Tarnovo is one of Bulgaria’s oldest settlements. Its history spans more than 5,000 years, including serving as capital during the second Bulgarian kingdom between the 12th and 14th centuries.\n\nKnown as the “City of Tsars” and famous for its Tsarevets medieval fortress, which sits atop a hill of the same name, the legendary fortress is surrounded by what some call the great wall of Bulgaria. The wall, which towers thirty feet high and twelve feet thick stretches for more than a half-mile around the hill. It was home to and protected the palaces of many Bulgarian emperors or kings and the Patriarch of the church.\n\nEager to explore the fortress and the city, I arrange accommodations at the Arte Hotel, a new and modern facility just a short one-mile walk along the Yantra River to the fortress. The owner of the hotel also owns Hadji Nikoli Inn Restaurant, just a short walk from here. It’s set in a historic building dating back to the mid-1800s and a stunning example of late renaissance architecture. I’m told the restaurant has one of the best wine lists in Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nThe front desk clerk shows me to my secured parking place where I unpack and cover Doc and settle in for a couple of days in Bulgaria’s old capital. By the time I’m unpacked and logged into the wifi, the sky opens up, pouring rain, while roaring thunder rattles the window and whipping wind slams the hotel door open and closed until the staff secures it. I’m sure glad I’m off the bike.\n\nI put off my hike to the fortress until tomorrow because of the nasty weather and instead organize photos and download videos from my various devices—all tasks that get put off with each day because of a packed schedule, and I’m always on the move. Gigabytes of data grows with each day. So a bit of bad weather downtown makes for the perfect excuse—and incentive—to attend to such business.\n\nLater for dinner, I opt to trek down the road a bit to Shtastliveca, a restaurant popular with both locals and tourists. It’s crowded and bustling when I arrive. The rustic interior is cozy and great views from the terrace tables. They seat me at a table in the middle of the dining room, where I watch the friendly waiters whisk about. The chefs plate the food with care, and ingredients are mostly fresh and local.\n\nEven better, I convince the manager to let me bring in and taste two Rossidi wines that Eddie gave me a couple of days ago even though they’d been open. The wine list is impressive and reasonably priced, so I order a bottle to support their business. I explain that I’m working on a project and researching the region and its wines.\n\nI order a shepherds salad made with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, pan-fried eggplant, sweet peppers, and topped with cheese and housemate flat dry sausage with yogurt and walnuts. With the salad, they offer me a basket of freshly baked and still warm bread. It’s delicately seasoned with sea salt, rosemary, and garlic. It’s dangerous. This break is so tasty it’s addicting, and I have to discipline myself, or I’ll devour the whole basket. All of this makes for a delicious accompaniment to the Rossidi egg-fermented chardonnay and pinot noir that I hand-carried here from Sliven.\n\nFor my main course, I choose roasted lamb medallions served with field and porcini mushrooms and vegetables. It’s like a hearty stew, and the creamy mushroom sauce and tender lamb is a perfect pairing with the 2013 Monogram wine, a luscious blend of Rubin and Mavrud from Villa Yustina outside Plovdiv.\n\nA couple from the UK, and curious about the three bottles of wine sitting on my table, take a moment to chat with me. I offer them a taste of the Rossidi Pinot Noir. They like it. The guy admits he wasn’t keen on wine from Bulgaria and prefers beer. After enjoying the Rossidi, he promises to try more Bulgarian wine as they continue their travels.\n\nThere are only a few tables remaining as I leave the restaurant. As I walk out of the dining room I’m reminded of something that I haven’t seen in California in years: ashtrays. Yes, smokers aren’t shunned from many restaurants in this part of the world. Luckily this evening, my table was far from the closest smoker.\n\nEarly the next morning, Veliko Tarnovo treats me with blue skies and mild temperatures. My coffee and the made-to-order breakfast included with my room here at the Arte Hotel gives me the energy and sustenance. So I take the mile or so walk to the Tsarevets fortress.\n\nThe medieval enclave is impressive and in great condition. I wander and admire the compound and its massive walls. Sitting high above the Yantra River, I decide to fly—that is to unpack and launch my drone to capture a few photographs of the castle, river, and surrounding area. It’s obvious I’m not the only drone pilot who’s launched here as the security guard walks up to me. At first, I wonder if he will ask me not to fly, but no, he wants me to fly it higher—pointing and poking his finger up at the sky. Though the video transmission from the drone was spotty and glitchy. I had a problem seeing just what I was shooting.\n\nI spend most of the day wandering the town, the cobblestoned streets of the old part of town, and admiring the very chill nature of the place. I learn that the owner of the hotel and the restaurant I’ll try this evening is an American ex-pat and that Veliko Tarnovo has perhaps the largest ex-pat population in Bulgaria. Sadly, I won’t have time to verify this as tomorrow I’ve got to get an early start and make it to Varna before noon.\n\nI’m in touch with Marin Atanasov, a sommelier and Bulgarian wine expert who works at the Sea Terrace in Varna. We’ve made a plan to visit Tsarev Brod, a winery (and the name of the village) outside Varna near Shuman. I’ll drop the bike off at a hotel in Varna, and we’ll drive with another of his colleagues from the Sea Terrace restaurant.\n\nThe lovely Hadji Nikoli Inn Restaurant features an outdoor terrace, wine bar, and several cozy dining rooms inside. Other diners occupy most of the outdoor tables, so I choose one of the smaller dining rooms where just one other couple just finished their first course. My server and I discuss wine, and I agree to try a wine made by the Minkov Brothers. I prefer to drink a local varietal, but for tonight the 2015 Oak Tree, a Bordeaux-style blend, will be fine—especially with the juicy entrecôte—a French term for a premium cut of beef that’s not unlike a boneless ribeye—served with potato croquettes and prosciutto-wrapped asparagus.\n\nThe service is impeccable, and the food prepared just as I ordered. Both of my meals, and wines I tried here in Veliko Tarnovo, were excellent. But like all good things, this evening and my time in the old capital must pass, and I’m off to Varna tomorrow as my time in Bulgaria is winding down.\n\nMentioned In This Post\n\nPark Central Hotel – Sliven\n\nbul. “Tsar Osvoboditel” 6\n\nSliven Center, Sliven, Bulgaria\n\n+359 44 501 700\n\nARTE Hotel rooms & apartments\n\nul.
