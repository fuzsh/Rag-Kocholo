        "text": "Founded in February 2016, Foundation for Contemporary Art and Media is a non-profit organization run by Martina Yordanova, Galya Krumova and Petya Krumova. Its headquarters is based in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. The Foundation’s missions are to both support the cultural and creative sector, and to convey the context in which artworks and the general public can meet.\n\nThe organization brings together actions that are initiated by the board of directors to promote the creation of contemporary art: exhibitions, artists' presentations, multicultural projects, publications, art promotion and education towards communities.\n\nThe Foundation’s art policy explores questions relevant to contemporary art, architecture and urbanity. It aims to promote the circulation of cultural and creative works and the mobility of cultural and creative players, in particular artists, transnationally. In 2023 a new project arose in the portfolio of the organization – Iatrus Residency Program.\n\nYou will have uninterrupted, self-managed work time. They will not pressure you to deliver finished work; you can focus solely on research and development of ideas related to the city of Veliko Tarnovo or beyond.\n\nOn two of the weekends in Veliko Tarnovo, you will be mentored by the director of the residency program Martina Yordanova and by other collaborators during your stay depending on your work and interests.\n\nEach session (month) hosts 2 creative practitioners at the same time, from different disciplines, giving the opportunity to artists in residency to gain new ideas and insights that can be applied to creative exploration and the development of their work through peer interaction and discussion groups.\n\nThe house of the Iatrus Residency Program is more than 170 years old and has been completely renovated inside and adjusted to the needs of the residents. Originally it belonged to the Bai, when the Ottoman Empire was ruling these territories (until 1878). It has been among the most precious buildings in the area. Today, in its contemporary state, the house is fully equipped and furnished with everything you could need on a daily basis.\n\nA 180m2 house in the heart of the old town called Varusha South.\n\n2 individual bedrooms\n\n2 working studios connected through a door\n\nA shared living area including kitchen, living room and a big dining room (all spaces are connected)\n\nOne big bathroom\n\nHigh-Speed Wi-Fi\n\nA garden belonging to the property with a total size of 300m2 can be used in various ways\n\nLocated in the city of Veliko Tarnovo, the old capital of Bulgaria, the Iatrus Residency Program is an ideal opportunity to experience both historical and contemporary attitudes and developments. Often referred to as the \"City of the Tsars\", Veliko Tarnovo is located on the Yantra River (from where the name of the residency comes) and is famously known as the historical capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, attracting many tourists with its unique architecture. The old part of the town, where the Iatrus Residency Program also takes place, is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa and Sveta Gora, rising from among the meandering turns of the Yantra, the largest river in Northern Bulgaria. On Tsarevets are the palaces of the Bulgarian emperors and the Patriarchate, the Patriarchal Cathedral, and also a number of administrative and residential edifices surrounded by thick walls. A symbol of the city of Veliko Turnovo and one of the most visited monuments in Bulgaria is undoubtedly the fortress of “Tsarevets”. It is located on the same hill that bears its name and is just a few steps from Iatrus Residency Program.\n\nIn the old town (Varusha South quarter) you will have the opportunity to explore unique cultural memories and many beautiful places that have kept the history of the city for centuries. Numerous churches, museums, cultural monuments, ancient fountains and houses of worship where some of the city’s most respected artists have given life to their work. Varusha South is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Veliko Tarnovo. With its pleasant atmosphere, it attracts young entrepreneurs and artists who bring new modern air to the city. A new wave of renovations of historical buildings and the abundance of high-quality goods and services revitalized this part of the city into a favourite place for relaxation and entertainment among both tourists and Veliko Tarnovians."
