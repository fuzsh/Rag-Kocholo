        "text": "VELIKO TARNOVO - Geography and history\n\nHome to former capital of Bulgaria\n\nTogether with the regions of Pleven, Lovech, Ruse and Gabrovo, Veliko Tarnovo is situated in the North-Central Region of Bulgaria. In addition to the above regions, it also borders on the regions of Targovishte, Sliven and Stara Zagora. Veliko Tarnovo is divided into 10 municipalities, which have in total 333 settlements. Of these, 171 are very small villages (below 50 inhabitants), which is characteristic for this part of the country, particularly for the southern mountainous sections. There are 14 towns in the region, the largest being the regional centre Veliko Tarnovo. Other towns of note include Gorna Oryahovitsa, Pavlikeni and the Danube port of Svishtov.\n\nThe area of the region is 4 662 km2 (4.2% of the national total) and it comprises parts of the Danube Plain, the lower Balkans and the Balkan mountain range. The relief changes from a flat plain around the river Danube to semi-mountainous and mountainous in the southern end of the region.\n\nThis part of Bulgaria has a rich historical past. Remains of the Roman cities Nikopolis ad Istrum and Nove (present-day Svishtov) are situated in the region. Veliko Turnovo entered Bulgarian history in 1185 after the uprising of the Assen and Petar boyars, when Bulgaria overthrew 150 years of Byzantine rule. As the capital of the Second Bulgarian State (1185-1391), the city underwent vigorous economic and cultural growth. A school for religious and literary studies was founded, which today would be known as a university. In 1393 Veliko Turnovo was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and the city was destroyed. After the liberation of Bulgaria (1878), it was again for a short time the capital. In 1878, the first Bulgarian National Assembly (Parliament) was summoned there and approved the first Bulgarian constitution.\n\nRich past but acute shortage of investment\n\nVeliko Turnovo is a region with a well preserved environment, mineral springs, numerous archaeological and ethnic artefacts, which give it great scope for developing its tourist industry. Furthermore, its well-developed road network, manufacturing facilities for the chemical and radio-electronics industry, a considerable scientific potential and skilled labour force are other positive features of the region.\n\nThere are certain barriers, however, which hinder the full utilisation of the afore-mentioned advantages. Among these are the deteriorating demographic situation, the acute shortage of investment capital (the region is among the lowest nationally in terms of per capita foreign investment), and depopulation of the mountainous regions.\n\nIn terms of natural resources, non-metallic deposits (clay, marl, limestone, quartz sand) are of economic importance. Limited deposits of black coal have been found in the Balkan mountain range. The climate is moderately continental. The Yantra river basin is linked to all other rivers in the region. The region's water resources are supplemented by numerous mineral springs (in the village of Voneshta Voda, the towns of Svishtov, Polski Trambesh). Fertile humus soils are found near the Danube, while alluvial soils, suitable for vegetable-growing, are spread along the river valleys. Forests occupy 24% of the area and add to the natural wealth of the region. The arable land had a total area of 466 157hectares, representing 4.2% of the total arable land of the country and 34.9% of the total area of the region (2002 figures)\n\nProcessing industries and intensive agriculture\n\nThe population of the region numbers 289 229 inhabitants (2002 figures), equivalent to 3.7% of the national total. Population density (62 inhabitants per km2 in 2002) is below the national average (70.7 inhabitants per km2). In 2002, as elsewhere in the region, the birth rate was low (7.7 per thousand) and the death rate was high (16.2 per thousand), resulting in a negative natural population growth. The age structure is relatively well balanced, the population under 25 years being a substantially higher percentage of the total compared to the population aged above 65 (28.0% and 18.6% respectively in 2002).\n\nThe employment rate is below national average, and so is per capita GDP. In 2001, the Gross Value Added represented 3.1% of that of the country. Agriculture had a share of 19.3%, while that of industry was 26.6% and the services were responsible for the remaining 54.1%. Food and beverages industries dominate the economic structure. One of the biggest sugar plants in Bulgaria is situated in Gorna Oryahovitsa. Machine tool engineering and metal-processing come next (in Veliko Turnovo, Gorna Oryahovitsa, and Debelets). Gorna Oryahovitsa, Pavlikeni, and Strazhitsa are home to ceramic production. The chemical industry is represented by large enterprises in Svishtov and Veliko Turnovo.\n\nThanks to the rich agrarian and environmental potential there is a well-developed agricultural sector, with vegetable growing the most important sector. Crops, sunflower and sugar beat are grown in the northern plains. Cattle are reared both for meat and milk production.\n\nMajor transit routes dissect the region, including the road from Sofia to Varna and from Rousse to Stara Zagora. There were 935 kilometres of roads in the region (4.8% of the national average), representing a road density of 201 kilometres/1 000 square kilometre (2002 figures). Gorna Oryahovitsa is a major railway junction for Northern Bulgaria, as the Sofia-Varna and Rousse-Stara Zagora-Podkova rail lines intersect here. The airport complex near Gorna Oryahovitsa is used for charter flights.\n\nIn addition to numerous high schools and a range of vocational schools, the Veliko Turnovo University is the second oldest Bulgarian university after the University of Sofia. During the 2002/2003 school year, there were 20 157 students in colleges and universities, representing 56% of the North Central region. There were also 1 280 teachers, or 52% of the regional average.\n\nMedical services are at a high level, with one regional and several district hospitals. Water supply in the region meets the needs of the population. At first of January 2003, the region registered 862 physicians, out of which 23% were all-practical, 190 dentists and 1 559 people with intermediate medical education. Taken together, this represents 24% of the staff of the North Central region."
