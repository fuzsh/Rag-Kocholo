        "text": "Pages: 327-334\n\nThis study is focused on pieces of the so called stone-paste (Qashan) ceramics, found during archaeological excavations on the two citadels in the capital of the Second Bulgarian kingdom. Most of the findings are sherds that come from the Southern part of Trapezitsa. There is also a restored bowl found at area 14 at Tsarvets. Their context is dated to the 13th—14th century. Not numerous artifacts of this kind, among the ceramic assemblage in this context, as stone-paste ware, Celadon ware and Western majolica ware, show that import of decorated luxory ceramic wares to the Bulgarian capital was limited.\n\nThe examples of stone-paste wares presented here were made at important production centres of the Golden Horde in the Lower Volga region and at the workshops of Mamluk Egypt. These evidences of distant trade connections are exotic exceptions among the art ware ceramic assemblage of medieval Tarnovo.\n\nKeywords: Second Bulgarian kingdom, Tsarеvets, Trapezitsa, stone-paste (Qashan) ceramics, trade, Golden Horde, Mamlūk Egypt"
