        "text": "‚ÄúBulgaria üáßüá¨ ~Veliko Tarnovo and the Marvelous Ancient Town, Full of Wonder!‚Äù\n\nIn our travels, it is just this kind of a place we seek.\n\nI love ancient history; the older the better! I love the myths and legends relating to historical places. Then, there are the quaint, charming, and fairytale-like towns, which are the icing on the cake!\n\nHere, in Veliko Tarnovo, we were filled-up! Rolling in to to the city, we do not see the old part right away, but soon, looming high up on the hill, is the Ascension Cathedral; impossible to miss! We set our sites for that direction, as signage is limiting in Bulgaria like most of the Balkans. Like a beacon in the night, (in full daylight) we were drawn to the right place, and it was incredible.\n\nThe Tsarevets Fortress is huge, and at one time, it was even bigger. We found a decent parking spot and began our trek to the Cathedral, which is top-enter of the Fortress. My focus was that Cathedral, so it drove me on to reach it. Its a straight up adventure, but thankfully not too long, though in the heat of summer, it felt too long. I was not disappointed for the effort. The view shows just how European and charming the old town is, plus being inside the Fortress, gave me chills, because I love Castles and Fortresses.\n\nAfter we were done self-touring the Cathedral and the Fortress ruins, we stopped for some cold water, bought from a vending machine in a shaded rest stop, then began our decent. We had already picked our dinner place, before heading up, so after our exploring of all things incredible, we walked in to what felt like ‚Äúgrandmas house,‚Äù and enjoyed a lovely meal, topped off with ice cream cake, because weft celebratory for making it to, yet, another country, during these unusual times! Each day we get to continue living our dream is a gift, and we do not take it for granted.\n\nAfter dinner, we drove around the old town and took more photos of the places we saw from the cathedral views.\n\nLooking around for a room for the night, I was surprised at the prices. 75 euro and up! Since we had seen everything we wanted to see in the ancient town we came to see, it was an easy decision to drive towards our next stop, and find a cheaper hotel on the outskirts; which we did for our budget 30 Euros for the night, with breakfast. We have figured out by now, the weekends, during these summer months are busy, with locals enjoying their vacations. We still choose not to book ahead and take our chances. We joke that at least with the Land Rover, which I have dubbed ‚ÄúThe Beast,‚Äù we would be more comfort able sleeping in full recline positions, if we have to. Im game, but the big guy is not.\n\nHere in Bulgaria, we barely see any masks, including old people. Still, in the grocery store, masks are required, and sometimes inside museums or churches. Out in the open spaces, there is no such thing as social distancing. Tonight, we listened to a bunch of old men, just below our balcony yakking it up and laughing, while children played in the pool, having a grand old time.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice first day in Bulgaria. Switching countries like we do, it always takes till our first stop to feel acclimated and comfortable. We did not like driving in the capital city of Sofia one bit. There are too many one-way streets, dead ends, and strange interception. There is a tram in the mix, too, which intermingles with roadways for cars. It was a bit stressful, and we could not wait to get out! We will have to return when done touring in this country, and there are two places we want to visit, but we plan on those stops at the end, when we are more use to the road rules and behaviours here, after out 18 days.\n\nThough the region was all a Yugoslavian country at one time, the geography is the only thing that is similar, now, and even that changes here, and there, like any place this large, would.\n\nGo To Home Page"
