        "text": "Veliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest cities in the country, and its history dates back more than five millennia, as evidenced by archaeological excavations.\n\nThe heyday of Veliko Tarnovo is associated with the period of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom (1185 - 1393). In 1185, the city was proclaimed the capital of the restored Bulgarian state by the brothers Asen and Peter, who announced the end of the Byzantine rule, which had lasted for 167 years.\n\nThe most significant cultural monument in Veliko Tarnovo is the medieval Tsarevets fortress, located on the peak of the same name, surrounded on three sides by the Yantra River. Excavations show that Tsarevets, although surrounded by a fortress wall, was not a closed fortress, but a real medieval town, in the center of which stood the palace, the church \"St. Petka\", numerous residential and commercial buildings, reservoirs and battle towers. On the highest part of Tsarevets was the residence of the patriarch, and in the immediate vicinity was the Patriarchal Church of the Ascension of Christ.\n\nNext to Tsarevets is another historic hill - Trapezitsa. Its historical wealth is great and not yet fully revealed. Archaeological excavations on the hill continue and new interesting discoveries are coming to light.\n\nApart from its historical hills, Veliko Tarnovo is also known for its numerous Orthodox churches. One of the most emblematic medieval churches is the temple of \"St. Forty Martyrs\", built in honor of the victory of Tsar Ivan Assen II (1218 - 1241) over the Epirus despot Theodore Comnenus (1180 - 1273). The Bulgarian kings Kaloyan (1168 - 1207), Ivan Asen II, as well as many other members of the royal families and the Bulgarian aristocracy are buried in the church. The Orthodox church also houses some of the most significant Old Bulgarian epigraphic monuments - the Omurtag column, the Asen column and the Border column from the Rodosto fortress from the time of Khan Krum (755 - 814).\n\nIn the vicinity of the city there are also some of the most famous Bulgarian monasteries - Patriarsheski, Preobrazhenski, Arbanashki, Plakovski, Kapinovski, Kilifarevsky, etc.\n\nArchitecturally, the appearance of the old part of the city transports visitors to the past. Walking along \"Gurko\" Street or \"Samovodska Bazaar\" (street of crafts), guests of the city have the opportunity to see buildings erected more than 200 years ago, as well as to feel a completely different atmosphere. The bazaar is a kind of ethnographic complex with craft workshops, souvenir shops and galleries.\n\nIt is not by chance that Veliko Tarnovo has been declared the Balkan capital of cultural tourism and has several times won the \"Most Beautiful City\" award in Bulgaria as a result of an annual survey conducted by the media. The city is truly magnificent with its beautiful houses perched amphitheatrically on the banks of the river, rich in history and sights and attractive to guests.\n\nAccommodation options in the city are extremely diverse - private accommodations, hostels, guest houses and hotels up to 4 stars. The city also offers rich opportunities for entertainment and nightlife - discos, bars, restaurants, etc. The town's main street offers a variety of shops, hotels, entertainment and dining options. The restaurants in the city are known for their good cuisine. Here you can try popular Bulgarian dishes and those characteristic of the region.\n\nFor supporters of active recreation, there are a number of eco-trails - Negovanska (in the village of Emen), Preobrazhenska, Arbanashka and others. Eco-trails are marked walking routes in nature, thanks to which tourists are given access to beautiful areas and natural attractions. The area offers opportunities for rock climbing, mountain biking, horseback riding, and the many rivers and dams provide opportunities for fishing and swimming."
