        "text": "City in north central Bulgaria\n\n\"Tarnovo\" redirects here. For the smaller town, see Malko Tarnovo.\n\nNot to be confused with Târnova (disambiguation), Turnovo (disambiguation), or Trnovo (disambiguation).\n\nTown in Bulgaria\n\nVeliko Tarnovo (Bulgarian: Велико Търново, romanized: Veliko Tŭrnovo, pronounced [vɛˈliko ˈtɤrnovo]; \"Great Tarnovo\") is a city in north central Bulgaria and the administrative centre of Veliko Tarnovo Province. It is the historical and cultural capital of Bulgaria.\n\nOften referred to as the \"City of the Tsars\", Veliko Tarnovo is located on the Yantra River and is famously known as the historical capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, attracting many tourists with its unique architecture. The old part of the town is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora, rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. On Tsarevets are the palaces of the Bulgarian emperors and the Patriarchate, the Patriarchal Cathedral, and also a number of administrative and residential edifices surrounded by thick walls.\n\nTrapezitsa is known for its many churches and as the former main residence of the nobility. During the Middle Ages, the town was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. Veliko Tarnovo is an important administrative, economic, educational, and cultural centre of Northern Bulgaria.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most widespread theory for the name's origin holds that its original names of Tarnovgrad (Търновград) and Tarnovo (Търново) come from the Old Bulgarian тръневъ (tranev) or тръновъ (tranov), meaning \"thorny\". The suffix \"grad\" means \"city\" in Bulgarian and in many Slavic languages. In 1965, the word велико (veliko), meaning \"great\", was added to the original name in honour of the town's status as an old capital of Bulgaria. This also helps distinguish it from the town of Malko Tarnovo. In Ottoman Turkish, it was called طرنوه (Modern Turkish: Tırnova).\n\nSymbols\n\n[edit]\n\nThe anthem of the city is Shishman's song, dedicated to the last Bulgarian king of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom. The coat of arms of Tarnovo depicts a figure with three lions. Purple color was used for the flag of the city, because during the excavations in the church St. Forty Martyrs, purple clothes of rulers were found. There is also a key and a necklace of Veliko Tarnovo. [6] The first known coat of arms of the city is from 1921 by Dimitar Bagrilov.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Veliko Tarnovo\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo has an area of 60.9 square kilometres (23.5 sq mi).

[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Tarnovo\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\n\n[edit]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, with a history of more than five millennia. The first traces of human presence, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, were discovered on Trapezitsa Hill.[8]\n\nFirst Bulgarian state\n\n[edit]\n\nTarnovo was a stronghold of the First Bulgarian Empire. A number of coins, specimens and ceramics from the First Bulgarian State were found on the hills on which the capital city of Tarnovgrad stretched.[8] The city was important for the first Bulgarian state. There was an important military garrison in it. In the church of St. Forty Martyrs specimens were found that historians believe are the work of Bulgarians from Volga Bulgaria.[citation needed]\n\nUprising of Asen and Peter\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Uprising of Asen and Peter began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, ruled by the Asen dynasty. Old Tarnovo would serve as the capital.\n\nMedieval Bulgarian rule\n\n[edit]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo, originally Tarnovgrad (Търновград), grew quickly to become the strongest Bulgarian fortification and most prosperous city during the second half of the High and the Late Middle Ages and also most important political, economic, cultural and religious centre of the empire. In the 14th century, the city was described by Bulgarian cleric Gregory Tsamblak as \"a very large city, handsome and surrounded by walls, with 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants\".,[9] the fortress of Tsarevets being the primary fortress and strongest bulwark from 1185 to 1393, housing the royal and the patriarchal palaces.\n\nIn the 14th century, as the Byzantine Empire weakened, Tarnovo claimed to be the Third Rome, based on its preeminent cultural influence in Southeastern Europe.\n\nAs the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Tarnovo was a quasi-cosmopolitan city, with many foreign merchants and envoys. Tarnovo is known to have had Armenian, Jewish and Roman Catholic (\"Frankish\") merchant quarters, besides a dominant Bulgarian population. The discovery of three Gothic heads of statuettes indicates there may have also been a Catholic church.[10]\n\nOttoman rule\n\n[edit]\n\nThe political upsurge and spiritual development of Tarnovo were halted when the Ottoman Empire captured the city on 17 July 1393.[citation needed] The siege lasted for three months, with the Bulgarian Patriarch Evtimiy leading the defence.[11] Three years later, the Ottomans conquered the entire Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBulgarian resistance against Ottoman rule remained centred in Tarnovo (then known as Tırnova) until the end of the 17th century. Two major anti-Ottoman uprisings – in 1598 and in 1686 – started in the city. Tarnovo was consecutively a district (sanjak) capital in the Rumelia Eyalet, in the Silistria Eyalet, and finally in the Danube Vilayet.\n\nTarnovgrad, along with the rest of present-day Bulgaria, remained under Ottoman rule until the 19th century, when national identity and culture reasserted themselves as a strengthening resistance movement. The goal of the establishment of an independent Bulgarian church and nation motivated the 1875 and 1876 uprisings in the city. On 23 April 1876, the April uprising marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman occupation. It was soon followed by the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).\n\nThird Bulgarian State\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 July 1877, Russian general Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko liberated Veliko Tarnovo, ending the 480-year rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin created a Principality of Bulgaria between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Tarnovo. Due to the capture of Tarnovo by Russian forces, the Muslim refugees fled to Anatolia.\n\nOn 17 April 1879, the first National Assembly convened in Veliko Tarnovo to ratify the state's first constitution, known as the Tarnovo Constitution, resulting in the transfer of parliament from Tarnovgrad to Sofia, which today remains the Bulgarian capital.\n\nIn deference to the city's past, Tsar Ferdinand, of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, chose the Forty Holy Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo as the place to declare the complete independence of Bulgaria on 5 October 1908.\n\nIn 1965, the city, then officially known as Tarnovo, was renamed Veliko Tarnovo (Great Tarnovo) to commemorate its rich history and importance.\n\nPeople's Republic of Bulgaria\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring Communist rule, the city underwent considerable changes, with some 10,000 of its population thought to have become members of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) by the end of the 1940s. A number of its churches and private enterprises were closed, while the major industries were nationalized. In the early 1950s, the city underwent an intensive process of urbanization, expanding to the west. From the same period also dates the idea of creating a large urban area in Northern Bulgaria encompassing the neighboring city of Veliko Tarnovo and the towns of Gorna Oryahovitsa and Lyaskovets (popularly known as \"Targolyas\").\n\nIn 1963, the University of Veliko Tarnovo \"St. Cyril and St. Methodius\" opened as one of the largest institutions of higher education in the country. Urbanization continued during the 1970s, as the engineering, electronic, medical, computer, and furniture industries expanded in the region, adding the neighborhoods of Akacia and Kartala to the city's landscape.\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Veliko Tarnovo had a population of 68,783 as of February 2011, while the Veliko Tarnovo Municipality, including the villages, had 88,670.[12]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%188711,314— 191012,469+10.2%193413,963+12.0%194616,223+16.2%195624,648+51.9%196537,276+51.2%197556,522+51.6%198569,605+23.1%199267,540−3.0%200166,897−1.0%201168,783+2.8%202158,507−14.9%Source: Censuses[13][14]\n\nEthnic composition\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the latest 2011 census data, individuals declaring their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:[15][16]\n\nBulgarians: 59,649 (95.5%)\n\nTurks: 2,225 (3.6%)\n\nRoma (Gypsies): 123 (0.2%)\n\nOthers: 258 (0.4%)\n\nIndefinable: 198 (0.3%)\n\nRomanians: 100\n\nUndeclared: 6,330 (9.2%)\n\nTotal: 68,883\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Buzluđa\" (Bulgarian: \"Бузлуджа\") – 19,500 people\n\n\"Kolio Ficheto\" or \"Triagalnika\" (\"Кольо Фичето\"/\"Триъгълника\") – 17,000 people\n\n\"Shirok centar\" (\"Широк център\") – 10,000 people\n\n\"Tsentar\" (\"Център\") – 8,000 people\n\n\"Zona B\" (\"Зона Б\") – 8,000 people\n\n\"Kartala\" (\"Картала\") – 4,800 people\n\n\"Akatsia\" (\"Акация\") – 3,200 people\n\n\"Cholakovtsi\" (\"Чолаковци\") – 4,200 people\n\n\"Sveta gora\" (\"Света гора\") – 3,140 people\n\n\"Varusha North\" (\"Варуша Север\") – 900 people\n\n\"Varusha South\" (\"Варуша Юг\") – 300 people\n\n\"Asenov\" (\"Асенов\") – 800 people\n\n\"Zona A\" (\"Зона А\") – 200 people (also ville zone)\n\n\"Slanchev dom\" (\"Слънчев дом\") – 80 people\n\n\"Veliko Tarnovo hills\" – (being constructed)\n\nVille zone \"Derven\" (\"Дервен\") – 80 people\n\n\"Sveta gora\"\n\nCenter\n\n\"Zona B\"\n\n\"Cholakovtsi\"\n\n\"Varusha North\"\n\nThe ethnic composition of Veliko Tarnovo Municipality is 100,570 Bulgarians, 3,681 Turks and 595 Gypsies, among others.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Culture of Veliko Tarnovo\n\nCulture in the city is still developing when the city is a capital city.\n\nRegional Library Petko Slaveykov\n\nCommunication center \"Nadezhda 1869\"\n\nMusical-dramatic theater \"Konstantin Kisimov\"\n\nArt Gallery \"Boris Denev\"\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nChurch schools have existed in the medieval capital since XV century.
