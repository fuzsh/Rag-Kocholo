        "text": "Veliko Tarnovo - a Bulgarian Durham?\n\nMonday, June 02, 2014\n\nVeliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria\n\nThe hotel we are staying at in Arbanasi is really excellent and is one of the best we have stayed in; very expensive fittings and fixtures and all for 45E. Today we visited Veliko Tarnovo which is just 4 km from Arbanasi.\n\nFirst stop was Tsarevets Hill and Fortress . The fortress and ruins are set in on the bend of the fast flowing Yantra (which means quick) River. The site has been occupied for thousands of years and excavations have revealed Tharacian, Roman, Byzantine ruins long before it became the capital of the 2nd Bulgarian Empire in the 14C. The fortress was ruined by the invading Ottomans until restored by the USSR and one has to say it might not be the most accurate restoration; a heavy touch of Disney seems to be apparent. Never-the-less it's an impressive site and the school children who were running around and dressing up in armour clearly thought it was good.\n\nWe then headed into the main town and parked opposite the State Art Galery (shut on Mondays, bother) and huge Asens monument built by the USSR to commemorate the 2nd Bulgarian Empire. The gallery and monument are also set on a bend in the river and the contrast between the two sides was striking. On one side was the old town with it's quaint overhanging houses and on the other bank a monstrous crumbling hotel, which looks like it was built in the 60's and is staggeringly ugly!\n\nA walk through the old town got to a restored bankers house full of pictures and antiques showing the wealth of the city during the late 19C .\n\nBy then it was time for a late lunch and we retired to a restaurant with spectacular view over the city and river and had a wonderful lunch. The food is seriously beginning to have an impact on our waistlines! We discussed that we hardly ever ate out in Oman, mostly because we thought the restaurants and food was very dull and stupidly expensive for what it was. Since we have been on this trip we have of course eaten out a lot and mostly the food has been very good. Today was one of our best meals (crispy pork on fresh pasta and chicken, stuffed with cheese and peppers, and wrapped in bacon), just excellent food and for the princely sum of 15 E including beer and coffee.... hard to beat.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is a really nice town and I'm glad we came. It's a university town with a lot of culture and reminded us a bit of Durham."
