        "text": "Welcome to Veliko Tarnovo – the old capital of Bulgaria. The town of Tarnovo with its unique fortress Tsarevets was the spiritual and cultural centre of Bulgarian during the Second Bulgarian Kingdom. Among the unapproachable rocks and pinnacles, surrounded by the hills Trapezitsa, Sveta gora and Tsarevets, the town of Veliko Tarnovo combines history themselves, present and future together. Strolling along the narrow streets in the ancient town, we can enjoy the houses, strangely perched one over another, the small workshops on the Samovodska charshia, the houses of the Bulgarian national revival on Gurko Street. The monuments, a symbol of our violent and heroic past, are scattered all over the town – the monument of the Horsemen, raising their swords above all, the monument of Mother Bulgaria, the memorial of the Hung men, also the monuments of Vasil Levski and Velchova zavera, as well as Stefan Stambolov’s Memorial and many others. Here we can bow down to the genius of constructors such as the master Kolyo Ficheto which architectural masterpieces (the church… , the House with the monkey, the Khan of Hadji Hikoli and so on) remain as an eternal token of the Bulgarian greatness. Lots of churches and monasteries contribute to the spiritual life in the old capital. One of the most famous among them is the church “Forty Holy Martyrs” where the king Ferdinand declared the Independence of Bulgaria in 1908. There are a big variety of galleries available for the art connoisseurs (The National Gallery “Boris Denev”, The Exhibition Halls “R. Mihailov”), as well as the unique art-shops and private galleries. A few museums are open for visiting – the Museum Constituent Assembly, the Prison Museum, The Sarafkina House – all of them as seats of culture and spirituality. Among the huge fund of books in the National Library “P. R. Slaveikov” one can find curious and little known legends of Veliko Tarnovo. In the Public Record Office you can learn about the great benefactors of the town, as well as some interesting historical facts. To feel the town at shorter range you should visit the numerous shops, supermarkets and trade centres, more important among them are Centrall Mall Veliko Tarnovo, Praktiker, Technopolis, Technomarket, CBA, Billa, Densi, Iskra Trade Centre, Europe Trade Centre. Also you can watch a mov ie at the Arena cinema, to play bowling or simply to maunder about. Do not miss a walk to the lovely village-reserve of Arbanassi, where unique panoramic views reveal towards Veliko Tarnovo and the mountain Stara planina.\n\nAfter you have sated your cultural and spiritual hunger, done your shopping and gone sightseeing, you can have a bite with relish at some of the restaurants, taverns and pizza places in the town. You can pop in some of the typical beer-houses or night-clubs to take a drink. In the evenings you should visit the discos and clubs and then to spend an unforgettable night at one of the numerous hotels, hostels and guest houses. Do not forget about the most important night miracle – the matchless audio and visual performance “Tsarevets – Sound and Light”, a dramatic luminous and acoustic experience of the historical development of Bulgaria. And this is only a fraction of the Veliko Tarnovo magic – come and have a look.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo - The Old Capital\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the most ancient Bulgarian towns. The picturesque situation and panoramic view of the town, its centuries-old history and culture, its rich cultural and historical heritage wins Veliko Tarnovo the recognition as a historical, cultural and tourist centre of contemporary Bulgaria.\n\nThe town was founded at the foot of the Northern Fore-Balkan Range. Historians date it back to the 4th millennium B. C. The town of Veliko Tarnovo had inherited centuries-old Prehistoric, Thracian and Antique culture and in 1185 it became a centre of the Bulgarian Uprising against Byzantine domination and the capital of the restored Bulgarian state. The m edieval town of Tarnovo was rapidly expanding and developed into the strongest Bulgarian fortress during the 12-14th cc. It became the most significant, political, economic, cultural and religious centre of Bulgaria. The Tarnovo Schools of Literature and Arts were established and developed here. Remarkable architectural monuments were created; miniature and monumental painting, literature, plastic arts and crafts achieved high artistic level.\n\nDuring the 15th-19th centuries period Tarnovo was a symbol of the former Bulgarian state system and stronghold of the Bulgarian national spirit, a leading centre of the struggle for national liberation, for religious and for cultural independence. During the Bulgarian National Revival period in the second half of the 18th and the 19th centuries the town was an important administrative, trade and industrial centre. The rapid economic boom was set as a favorable premise for a dynamic cultural and educational process. Unique monuments of the material and spiritual culture were created."
