Managing Director of International Fair Plovdiv Ivan Sokolov addressed words of greetings to the guests and contestants and his wish was that they come back to Plovdiv as outstanding scientists, managers, and entrepreneurs. Minister of Education, Youth, and Science, Mrs Yordanka Fandakova, thanked the institutions and sponsors and highlighted that updating Informatics education will be a priority to her. The ritual of saluting the flags of the Republic of Bulgaria and of IOI and the performances by the Trakiya Folklore Ensemble received roars of applauses from the crowded hall."
