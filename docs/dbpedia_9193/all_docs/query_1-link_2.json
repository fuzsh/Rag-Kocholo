        "text": "Veliko Tŭrnovo, majestic old town in northern Bulgaria. Veliko Tŭrnovo (“Great Tŭrnovo”) occupies near-vertical slopes above the 800-foot (240-metre) meandering gorge of the Yantra (Jantra) River. The houses, built in terraces, appear to be stacked one atop the other. The river divides the town into three rocky promontories—Sveta Gora, Tsarevets (Carewec), and Trapezitsa. As the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1396), Tŭrnovo was adorned with great splendour, but most of the relics were destroyed by the Turks or by the earthquake of 1911. Ruins of the medieval town have been excavated on the Trapezitsa and Tsarevets hills; the latter, the home of the Bulgarian tsars, is surrounded by thick walls and defenses and accessible only by a drawbridge. Much of the town has been restored as a national historical and cultural monument, with maximum retention of old architecture and town layout.\n\nOnce a prehistoric settlement, Tŭrnovo was later the site of a Roman fortress, probably on Carewec Hill. The Second Bulgarian Empire was proclaimed at Tŭrnovo in 1185, and it remained the imperial capital until 1393, when it was sacked and burned by the Turks. Throughout Ottoman rule it was a cultural and educational centre, a prosperous trading town, and a focus of Bulgarian resistance. Numerous notable personalities in Bulgarian arts, crafts, and sciences lived and worked in Tŭrnovo.\n\nUprisings against the Turks broke out several times. The first Bulgarian constitution was drafted and passed in Tŭrnovo in 1879, and there the independent Kingdom of Bulgaria was proclaimed in 1908 in the Church of the Forty Martyrs (built in 1230 by the emperor Ivan Asen II). Notable also is the 14th-century Church of St. Peter and St. Paul. Among the 11 monasteries located in the area is Sveta Troitsa (“Holy Trinity”). The town has an archaeological museum."
