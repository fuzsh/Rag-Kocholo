The old capital Veliko Tarnovo – Bulgaria

Tarnovo

Veliko Tarnovo was the medieval capital of the 2nd Bulgarian empire. Traces where found of a settlement from 3000 BC. First part of the Byzantine empire, but later independent. Razed to the ground by the Ottoman empire in 1393. In 1877 it was liberated by Russia. It’s a lovely place to be. We went there with some friends in 2012.

Most likely the church of Trier built Burg Ehrenburg. In 1688 the French took the castle and a year later they partly blew it up. Today you can visit it.
