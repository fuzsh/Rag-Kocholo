Veliko Tarnovo was the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396). During the Middle Ages, it was a bustling cultural and economic hub. Today, it’s a popular stopping point for travelers as they make their way from one end of Bulgaria to the other.

This quiet little town still has its medieval castle dominating the skyline (which is the main draw for tourists). There are also nearby hiking trails and monasteries worth exploring too.

It’s a peaceful mountain town and a hub for university students. I loved the cobblestone streets, the views from the castle, the little cafes in the city, and the accessible hiking trails. Visiting here was one of the highlights of my visit to Bulgaria.
