Two-time Australian World Cup midfielder Jason Culina has signed with Sydney FC for the remainder of the A-League season, the club said on Friday. Culina, 32, will link up with Italian superstar Alessandro Del Piero with the Sky Blues after undergoing lengthy rehabilitation from a knee injury that threatened to end his playing career. The skilful midfielder, who has played 58 internationals for his country including the 2006 and 2010 World Cups, said he was grateful for the opportunity to resume his playing career. "It's absolutely brilliant to be back," Culina said. "It's something that kept me awake at night, thinking about playing again so I'm really happy and grateful to have the opportunity to continue my career with Sydney FC. "There were times I thought I wanted to give up but I knew that if I put in the effort and commitment I could get back so I never gave up on the desire to play again." Culina was an Eredivisie winner with Ajax Amsterdam and PSV Eindhoven over a 10-year period before returning home to play for Gold Coast in the A-League in 2009.
