        "text": "Sydney Football Club (FC) was established in 2004 as the inaugural Australian-League (A-League) club representing Australia’s biggest city. In 2008, the club extended its commitment to the sport with the introduction of their first Women's team in the newly-formed W-League. From 2004 until the 2018/19 Season, the club's home ground was the original Allianz Stadium - a 45,500 seat rectangular multi-use venue in the suburb of Moore Park. From 2019 - 2022, the stadium was demolished and rebuilt. During this period, Sydney FC showcased their game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Leichhardt Oval and Jubilee Stadium in Kogarah. In 2022, Sydney FC proudly returned home to the stunning new Allianz Stadium - a state of the art facility with a capacity of 42,500. Sydney FC are the most successful club in the history of the A-Leagues, having won 33 trophies across the A-Leagues Men and Women, Australia Cup, the National Youth League, E-Leagues and Oceania Confederation. Sydney FC has been crowned Champions nine times and Premiers on nine occasions. Sydney FC Women also hold the record for highest attended domestic Women's football match at 11,471. Sydney FC has started to take its brand throughout Asia and the Pacific. Having succeeded in Oceania and at the Club World Championships in 2005, Sydney FC has now qualified for eight AFC Champions League competitions after Australia moved from the Oceania confederation to Asia. Many of the world’s greatest players have donned the Sky Blue shirt, including Italian World Cup winner Alessandro Del Piero,former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke, Brazilian superstar Juninho, Matildas and Chelsea star Sam Kerr, Socceroo legends John Aloisi and Brett Emerton and US Women's National Team winger Meghan Rapinoe.
