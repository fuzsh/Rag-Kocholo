        "text": "I remember a defining moment in my life that shaped who I am today. I was sleeping in my car and I had lost everything. I was a professional footballer at the time, and the league was being shut down for 18 months. My club declared bankruptcy 5 months before our contracts were due to expire. No money, no job, and kicked out of my apartment because I couldn't afford rent. Eventually a tiny room came up at a friend's place and I moved in, living on a diet of beans and noodles. I had a degree but nobody wanted to hire a footballer. I got a job working in a warehouse. Worked overtime. Worked weekends. Played football part-time and started to earn some money. It was a long road back, but I knew if I worked hard and stayed positive, someday i'd get back on my feet. One cold night, as I slept in my car contemplating what my life had become, I made a vow to work harder and smarter than anyone else. I vowed that I would have the career I wanted, and make it to the top. I never wanted to feel like that again. Fast forward 10 years, working at a company I had always admired, and running the Sales team. Why am I telling you this? Because the last few months have been tough on so many people. You'll look back at this time and see what you made of it. Make this your defining moment."
