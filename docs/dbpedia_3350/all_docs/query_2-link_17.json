        "text": "Date: Saturday, January 8Kick-off: 7.00pm AEDTVenue: Sydney Football Stadium\n\nHead-to-headPlayed 5: Wins: Sydney FC 0, Gold Coast 4 Draws: 1\n\nPrevious encounterGold Coast 3-1 Sydney FC, November 2010\n\nHistory:Gold Coast appears to be a bogey side for Sydney FC. Even though the Sky Blues won the double last season, they lost all three matches against Miron Bleiberg's side and have never tasted victory against them in five previous clashes. In their two meetings this season the two sides played out a dour 1-1 draw at the SFS in Round 7, while a double to Joel Porter and another goal to Jason Culina enabled the Gold Coast record a comfortable 3-1 win at Skilled Park in November.\n\nPast five matches:Sydney FC: WLLLLGold Coast: DDLWW\n\nMatch Committee:Sydney will be without striker Mark Bridge (stomach) and experienced defender Hayden Foxe (groin) who both picked up injuries in the victory over Newcastle on Monday. Youngsters Kofi Danning, Rhyan Grant and Brendan Gan have all been added to the squad. With Bridge joining fellow attacker Alex Brosque on the sidelines, Vitezslav Lavicka may be enticed to hand new Finnish striker Juho Makela his first start since joining the club last week.\n\nThe only absentee for the Gold Coast - besides Jason Culina on Socceroos duty - is tough-tackling defender Steve Pantelidis who is serving a one-match suspension. His loss has been softened by the return of Michael Thwaite who also served a one game ban last weekend. Youngster Chris Harold has also been promoted to the squad.\n\nDanger menBruno Cazarine - The injury to Bridge on top of Alex Brosque's current absence means Sydney's goal-scoring hopes will again rest heavily on Cazarine. The Brazilian striker has had a superb debut season in the A-League, netting seven goals from just 15 appearances so far. He scored in the Sky Blues' 3-1 loss to the Gold Coast in their last clash and is sure to again be a handful for Dino Djulbic and Kristian Rees on Saturday night.\n\nAdama Traore - With Culina out of the side the Gold Coast aren't nearly as potent but Traore does possess the ability to be just as destructive as the Socceroos midfielder. The Ivory-Coast born flyer was brilliant in the 0-0 draw against the Glory last time out and his blistering pace and skill makes him hard to contain on the left-hand side. Sydney will need to cut out his service to Bruce Djite and Joel Porter if they are to get their first ever win over the Gold Coast.\n\nAt the end of the dayWhile Sydney have had a torrid time on their home patch in front of dwindling crowds this season, they do have the rare treat of heading into the game on the back of a victory. Those in the inner-sanctum of the club still believe they can make the finals but it's more realistic that they can be a nuisance to teams chasing spots in the top six. The main question is will the Sky Blues still be able to create enough opportunities and score goals without the Killer Bs (Brosque and Bridge) on the pitch.\n\nHaving never lost to Sydney, Gold Coast will have no concerns about taking on the defending champions on their home field. They have the best defence in the league and are well-placed to push for a top-two spot over the closing rounds of the season. But without inspirational skipper Culina there is no doubt they lack penetration and miss his ability to unlock defences with his precise passing.\n\nWith that in mind it's hard to see many goals in this game with the opening goal vital. Whoever gets it is likely to take all three points.\n\nTeamsSydney FC: 1. Liam REDDY (gk), 2. Sebastian RYALL, 3. Stephan KELLER, 6. Hirofumi MORIYASU, 7. Brendan GAN, 8. Stuart MUSIALIK, 9.
