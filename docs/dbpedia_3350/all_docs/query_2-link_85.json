        "text": "07 <strong>Westfields</strong><strong>Sports</strong> F irst In Australia In Australian education there was something missing. There were schools for students with special talents but nothing for gifted sports students. For all talented young sports person there was a competition between education and sport – a competition that led to significant numbers of Australian youth dropping out of sport. There was a strong need for a partnership between education and sport. Founding Principal, Mr Philip Tucker saw there was a need for the establishment of a special school – one that could provide sports persons with a pathway to the Australian Institute of Sport, and to an education that provided for a life after sport. <strong>Westfields</strong> <strong>Sports</strong> provides that pathway. <strong>Westfields</strong> <strong>Sports</strong>, Australia’s first <strong>Sports</strong> <strong>High</strong> <strong>School</strong>, is located in Fairfield West, Sydney, Australia. <strong>Westfields</strong> <strong>Sports</strong> is committed to providing each student with the educational opportunities and quality resources essential for the achievement of personal excellence in scholarship, citizenship, sport and the arts. The extended educational community provides a caring and supportive environment, recognising and rewarding individual and co-operative achievement. The students are our focus. Direct links have been established with the Australian Institute of Sport, universities and major sporting associations. Since the declaration of <strong>Westfields</strong> as a <strong>Sports</strong> <strong>School</strong> on 24 April 1991, the <strong>Westfields</strong>‘ model has been established in all Australian states and has been recognised in European, South Eastern Asia and United Kingdom schools. The Commonwealth Government has described <strong>Westfields</strong> <strong>Sports</strong> as “a project of national significance” Sport is an integral part of the Australian culture – participating, coaching, teaching, spectating and administering. The development of <strong>Westfields</strong> as a <strong>Sports</strong> <strong>School</strong> results in both improved standards and increased levels of participation in sport at local, regional, state, national and international levels. Providing for the planned development of talented sports persons promotes the individual and collective self-confidence of students, enhancing their ability to successfully face the future. Outstanding sports persons from Sydney, New South Wales, other states and overseas, are offered the opportunity to complete their primary and secondary education in a strongly supportive environment. The school has a strong academic and sporting tradition, a reputation for innovation and a staff committed to encouraging personal excellence. The philosophy of the school is to allow talented sports students to pursue their sporting dreams in partnership with their education. The successful development of the school rests on the outstanding work of dedicated staff, talented students and Parent Support Groups.
