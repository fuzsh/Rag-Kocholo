        "text": "Australia's hopes of a bold showing at this month's Confederations Cup have been hit by confirmation that key midfielders Marco Bresciano and Vince Grella will not be released by their Italian club Parma.\n\nParma refused to release the pair as they face Bologna in a Serie A relegation play-off in a clash of dates with the Confederations Cup in Germany, from June 15-29.\n\nNational coach Frank Farina had included Bresciano and Grella in his provisional 23-man squad but bowed to Parma's wishes for the duo to stay in Italy.\n\n\"I decided it was best for the team as they prepare for the Confederations Cup and the World Cup qualifiers later in the year and in the best interests of the players that they not be selected,\" Farina said.\n\n\"It's a difficult situation for all involved. Both players love playing for their country and at the same time feel a responsibility to help their club.\n\n\"It's a shame they'll miss the tournament but it will give others an opportunity to step up.\"\n\nFarina has already lost star attacker Harry Kewell of Liverpool and Birmingham City's left-back Stan Lazaridis with injuries for the Confederations Cup, where Australia have been grouped with hosts Germany, Argentina and Tunisia.\n\nMiddlesbrough striker Mark Viduka is expected to make his return from back and hamstring problems to play for Australia in a friendly international against New Zealand at Craven Cottage in London on Thursday.\n\nApart from Bresciano and Grella, Farina is also without Twente Enschede midfielder Jason Culina, Osasuna striker John Aloisi and Sydney FC striker David Zdrilic for the New Zealand match.\n\nSocceroos:\n\nGoalkeepers - Mark Schwarzer (Middlesbrough, England), Zeljko Kalac (Perugia, Italy), Michael Petkovic (Trabzonspor, Turkey).\n\nDefenders - Kevin Muscat (Melbourne Victory, Australia), Lucas Neill (Blackburn Rovers, England), Tony Popovic (Crystal Palace, England), Ljubo Milicevic (FC Thun, Switzerland), Craig Moore (uncontracted), Tony Vidmar (Cardiff City, Wales), Simon Colosimo (Perth Glory, Australia), Jon McKain (National Bucuresti, Romania).\n\nMidfielders - Tim Cahill (Everton, England), Scott Chipperfield (Basel, Switzerland), Ahmad Elrich (Busan I'Cons, Korea), Brett Emerton (Blackburn Rovers, England), Jason Culina (Twente Enschede, Netherlands), Josip Skoko (Genclerbirligi, Turkey), Luke Wilkshire (Bristol City, England).\n\nForwards - Mark Viduka (Middlesbrough, England), Mile Sterjovski (Basel, Switzerland), John Aloisi (Osasuna, Spain), Archie Thompson (Melbourne Victory, Australia), David Zdrilic (Sydney FC)."
