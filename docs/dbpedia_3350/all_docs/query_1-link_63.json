        "text": "Football Federation Australia has announced the addition of John Kosmina, Jason Culina and Nick Meredith as columnists for the Football Australia digital network.\n\nFootball Federation Australia (FFA) has announced the addition of three new columnists to the Football Australia digital network - former Socceroos captain and Hyundai A-League Club Coach John Kosmina, former Socceroo World Cup midfielder Jason Culina and former NSL player Nick Meredith.\n\nThe new columnists add to the compelling mix of news, official stats, video and analysis on offer on Australian football, covering national teams the Qantas Socceroos and Westfield Matildas to the domestic competitions the Hyundai A-League, Westfield W-League and National Youth League.\n\nFFA-s Head of Corporate Affairs and Communications, Kyle Patterson, said the inclusion of highly-respected columnists Kosmina, Culina and Meredith was another important step in FFA-s digital strategy.\n\n“Fan engagement is at the heart of everything we do and there-s no better way to engage in digital and social media channels than by having the latest news and the best analysis,” said Patterson.\n\n“Our vision two years ago was to make footballaustralia.com.au the no.1 portal for football fans across Australia and we-ve achieved that.\n\n“The announcement shows how we intend to stay no. 1 in the exciting period ahead with a new Hyundai A-League season, the 2014 FIFA World Cup with the Socceroos and the AFC Asian Cup 2015 on home soil.”\n\nOver the past twelve months, footballaustralia.com.au has seen a 50% increase in the levels of web traffic that has given it the no.1 Network ranking for Football websites in Australia*. In addition there are now over one million social media followers on the FFA Network which includes the National Teams, Hyundai A-League, Westfield W-League and all associated clubs.\n\nA former Socceroos captain, John Kosmina played with his heart on his sleeve throughout a decorated career which included two championships with Sydney City - as well as a season with Arsenal. A fearless striker, Kosmina scored the first-ever NSL goal (for West Adelaide), going on to score 135 goals at club level, and 25 for his country. Since hanging up his boots, Kosmina has enjoyed a distinguished coaching career with Newcastle Breakers, Brisbane Strikers, Adelaide United and Sydney FC, and has also developed a powerful media profile across newspapers, radio and television. Kosmina was also inducted into the FFA Hall of Fame in 1999 as one of the first ever inductees.\n\nThoughtful and forthright as a player, Jason Culina intends to stick to his principles through the next phase of his life after announcing his retirement following a short spell with Sydney FC. In an illustrious career which began at Sydney United, Culina ended up playing 333 games and scoring 36 goals for clubs in Australia and The Netherlands, highlighted by three championships and four UEFA Champions League campaigns with PSV Eindhoven, and a title with Ajax Amsterdam. Culina also made 58 appearances for his country, playing in two World Cups.\n\nNick Meredith's opinions are the same as his tackles - fearless. These days an insightful commentator for Fox Sports, Meredith enjoyed a lengthy career in the NSL, highlighted by a championship with his hometown club, Brisbane Strikers. Meredith also played for Sydney Olympic, Newcastle Breakers and Marconi Stallions, accumulating 250 appearances and 28 goals over a 14-year career which began at Brisbane Lions. Following his playing days, Meredith has gone on to be a media pundit on Fox Sports broadcast of the Hyundai A-League. A staunch Queenslander, Meredith has been known to view the world with Maroon-coloured glasses and his columns will most probably be tainted by this view.\n\nJohn Kosmina-s first column has launched on the Football Australia website, click here with Jason and Nick-s to appear in the coming week-s."
