        "text": "First to worst. And to add salt to an already wounded pride, Sydney FC don't have a single player who ranks anywhere near the top of the league this season.\n\nAlex Brosque was picked for last night's friendly against Paraguay, but it was a Socceroos cap won on past performances and potential, not anything done in the first nine rounds of the A-League.\n\nBrosque is a special talent, but he has struggled to find his rhythm since returning from an ankle injury.\n\nNicky Carle, paid big money to replace the retired Steve Corica, has also struggled for fitness and consistency as he battles to find his role with his new club.\n\nMelbourne Victory, the other team in last year's grand final, also have their big names either out of form or off the pitch. Carlos Hernandez has found it much more difficult pulling the strings without his mate Archie Thompson up front.\n\nKevin Muscat, who still plays with a chip on each shoulder at the ripe old age of 37, is always one of the major players in any season and remains Victory's talisman.\n\nAlex Ferguson once said \"Dennis Wise could start a row in an empty room\". I wonder what he'd make of Musky.\n\nVictory coach Ernie Merrick can't wait to have his captain back and, be sure, he will be angrier than ever when he returns from his ankle injury.\n\nWith winless Sydney and Melbourne Victory plumbing unfamiliar depths, some exciting young players have taken the opportunity to step up.\n\nI've rated the top 10 players over the first nine rounds of the A-League; some are young boys likely to carry us towards the 2014 World Cup and beyond.\n\n1. Mathew Leckie - Adelaide United\n\nHe is a young Harry Kewell and Brett Emerton rolled into one exciting package.\n\nLeckie doesn't have the grace of Harry in his prime. What he has is power and pace.\n\nTommy Oar was fast-tracked into the national team first, but the Adelaide teenager might have even more potential. He's bigger, stronger and more powerful than Tommy.\n\nLeckie can also play in defence, midfield, out wide and even up front off a target man, like he does at Adelaide with Sergio van Dijk.\n\nThere are rough edges, but, at 19, he's an exciting talent.\n\n2. Jason Culina - Gold Coast\n\nJason's the best all-round footballer in the country. Many questioned why a player of Jason's ability would leave Europe to join a fledgling A-League club like the Gold Coast last year.\n\nBut such is Culina's professionalism, he hasn't let his standards drop one bit.\n\nJason's work between the two penalty boxes is extraordinary.\n\nIt was a pity that he was bolted to the holding midfield role with the Socceroos under Pim Verbeek, because we didn't see the creative side of his game often enough on the international stage. It was like owning a Ferrari and never driving it on the open road.\n\nCulina's leadership catches the eye. He scores goals, creates them and his example pushes his Gold Coast team-mates to play above themselves. He's a class act.\n\n3. Marcos Flores - Adelaide United\n\nThey say time stops for no man, except when the ball is at the feet of the Argentine.\n\nLast season, Adelaide finished last. Now the Reds are top of the league, unbeaten after nine games. The one difference is Flores.\n\nHe plays a different game to most in the A-League because he has the special gifts that separate the top playmakers -- time and space.\n\nThe Reds couldn't score a goal last season, yet they have 17 at a tick under two per game this time out. And Flores, more known as a creator, has scored arguably the two best goals of the season.\n\nYou can put down the rise of Mathew Leckie and the resurgence of Sergio van Dijk and Lucas Pantelis to the opportunities Flores has created for them.\n\n4. Matt McKay - Brisbane Roar\n\nHe's the midfield heartbeat of the Brisbane Roar. McKay's call-up to the Socceroos shows how good he's been. He does the same thing for his Brisbane team as Culina does for the Gold Coast, inspiring his team-mates with his work rate and direction.\n\nHe's the quintessential box-to-box player.\n\nThe Roar have been a revelation with their intricate passing game, and McKay is central to it. He's such a mobile and talented player.\n\n5. Patrick Zwaanswijk - Central Coast\n\nThe Mariners stopper is the new minister of defence. We can't choke up the A-League by bringing over a host of European veterans way beyond their use-by date because it only serves to handicap the development of our young talent.\n\nZwaanswijk, though, shows there's an exception to every rule.\n\nHe has more than 600 top-flight games in the Dutch league on his resume and he is passing that knowledge on to young Australian players.\n\nDespite being 35, Zwaanswijk is the best defender in the league with his ability to read the game and his composure under pressure.\n\n6. David Williams - North Queensland Fury\n\nNorth Queensland Fury might have a leaky defence, but there are few more exciting teams going forward.\n\nWilliams, 22, is another of the young guns doing exciting things in the A-League.\n\nHe's not the finished article, but the Queensland Academy product has teamed up brilliantly with 21-year-old Isaka Cernak and 20-year-old Chris Payne. All three could be Socceroos down the track.\n\nWilliams has played for his country from under-17s through to under-23s and has won two senior caps. A striker to watch.\n\n7. Paul Ifill - Wellington Phoenix\n\nThis guy is all class. He scores goals, creates goals -- a wonderful player.\n\nIfill is the first name on every game plan when it comes to stopping the Wellington Phoenix. It doesn't seem to work because Wellington haven't lost at home since October 2008.\n\nUnfortunately, that form deserts them when they cross the ditch, but Ifill is always a threat.\n\nThe Barbadian international had a prolific career in England, including playing over 238 games for Millwall. He has been one of the best imports in the six seasons of the A-League.\n\n8. Michael Thwaite - Gold Coast United\n\nMr. Versatility.\n\nThwaite is a coach's dream. He would be the first player on Gold Coast manager Miron Bleiberg's team sheet every week (perhaps second behind Jason Culina). He is a natural defender, but the Gold Coast coach knows he can throw him into the midfield and he will still do the job.\n\nOne of those dependable types who may not do one thing brilliantly, but Thwaite does everything well. He deserved his selection for last night's game against Paraguay.\n\nThe central defence shapes as a problem for Holger Osieck, so Thwaite has the opportunity to nail down a long-term Socceroos spot.\n\n9. Clint Bolton - Melbourne Heart\n\nYes, I have a goalkeeper in my top ten. Bolton proved his worth last year in the grand final penalty shoot-out that brought the trophy to Sydney.\n\nHe's had the difficult assignment of standing between the sticks at a new club, trying to organise a Melbourne Heart defence still getting used to playing together.\n\nThe Heart conceded four goals against Brisbane a few weeks back, but it could have been double that if it wasn't for Bolton.\n\nHe made a couple of great saves from Robbie Fowler against Perth and was their best player in the 1-0 win against North Queensland.\n\nAdelaide's Eugene Galekovic and Brisbane Roar's Michael Theoklitos are good, but Bolton shades them as the premier keeper.\n\n10. Robbie Fowler - Perth Glory\n\nIt's a measure of the man that Robbie stayed in Australia after everything that happened at North Queensland last season.\n\nSydney FC should have signed him as their international marquee player when they had the chance.\n\nSydney's loss has been Perth's gain.\n\nThe former Liverpool star is the A-League's headline act; the player even rival fans want to watch.\n\nAnd he is still a superb player. Perth may have hit a four-game slide, but it was Jacob Burns and Fowler who got them off to their flying start.\n\nDwight Yorke put this competition on the map in the first year with his unique mix of showmanship and football, but Fowler has done his bit with the quality of his play."
