        "text": "With The South Coast franchise, he'd be the Awesome Marquee for them. Too bad he might be a tad too old by the time they come into the league.\n\nThat idea of having a kind of 'Socceroo Marquee' or 'Australian Marquee' or a separate exception for returning Socceroos in the cap, aside or separate from a more refined marquee status (Which in itself could include Aussies, but only Culina-esque exceptions). Would be a great initiative that might see guys like Chippers come back earlier and might also kind of solve/get around this problem we're seeing with guys like J.Griffiths and North signed as Marquees or classed the same as would be Robbie Fowlers and Jason Culinas. Might also mean, like the North scenario, we might avoid seeing defenders being signed as Marquees.\n\nI know there aren't that many Socceroos to go around, but if you have some kind of elite performing Australian qualification, then top league performers/fringe socceroos like J.Griffiths and some others, would fit into that. No doubt on the back of his A-League performances over the seasons to date, Griffiths does deserve in a sense, his increased squad/contract status - but as many of us have discussed, calling him a Marquee (Same breath as Yorke) is a bit much.\n\nGetting back to Nth QLD - I'd love it if the club could have both Fowler (Marquee) AND Chippers (Aus Marquee)! Why not?\n\nThat is still some way off I guess and when we do, we'd be almost like the J-League I reckon, with their Endos and what have you, at home.\n\nOne way around this whole Marquee fiasco, is simply like what the MLS have done. They have reasonably cleve r way called such players 'Designated Players' and many teams have 2 of them. That way all this 'tiered' 'expectation' 'connotation' stuff is diminished or equalised somewhat and also allows for another quality player. Maybe the 2nd for us could be a 'Designated Australian Player?'\n\nThe title Marquee is soo vexxed in itself I guess and it's been almost a curse for this league's clubs in meeting the expectation of that title, that most have either given up trying to and have never tried in the first place.\n\nI really hope that A-League gets smart and decides to go with two Marquee player spots so that we allow teams to get two solid squad players to build around. I'd love Chipperfield to be in a Jets kit (jersey) but the sad point is that we've paid so much for Griffith who I do think needs a contract like this, we've cut our spending in other areas.\n\nOh by the way don't always assume a Marquee player will get people to a game, MLS is learning the hard way about that."
