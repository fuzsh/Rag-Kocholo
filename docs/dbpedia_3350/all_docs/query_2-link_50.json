        "text": "Season Preview: Perth Glory\n\nAs season 8 of the A-League moves ever close, here’s part 6 of our extensive league wide preview, today taking a look at Perth Glory.\n\nLast Season: 3rd place (Grand Finalists)\n\nPerth Glory started out strongly winning their 1st 3 matches and things were going to plan for Ian Ferguson’s men, however that soon halted going on a run of 1 win in 11 matches which put the boss on the hot seat. They turned it around however and won 9 of their remaining 13 regular season matches giving them 3rd spot on the table two home semi-finals. They won both before heading to Gosford and beating the Mariners on penalties to reach the decider.\n\nManager: Ian Ferguson\n\nMany people’s tip –mine included- to be the 1st coach shown the door, Ferguson turned the Glory around from potentially another disappointing season at Christmas to storm home and almost snare a double chance in the finals. There were some reports that owner Tony Sage was about to fire him but im betting he’s glad he didn’t as Ferguson took the Glory to within about 10 minutes of causing a massive boilover in last season’s showpiece game.\n\nA lot of people say Fergie is a 4-4-2 merchant and lacks tactical sophistication and variation, but he disproved that myth last season by switching between his customary 4-2-2 and a 4-3-3 4-5-1 at times last season. The variation was essentially a choice between McGarry and Mehmet but he got it right more often than not last season. Will be interesting to see if he can follow that up again this season.\n\nSquad:\n\n1. Danny Vukovic, 3. Bas van den Brink, 4. Billy Mehmet, 5. Steve Pantelidis, 6. Nick Ward, 7. Jacob Burns, 8. Dean Heffernan, 9. Shane Smeltz, 10. Liam Miller, 11. Adrian Zahra, 12. Ryo Nagai, 13. Travis Dodd, 14. Steven McGarry, 15. Brandon O’Neill, 16. Evan Berger, 17. Chris Harold, 18. Jesse Makarounas, 19. Josh Risdon, 20. Neil Young, 21. Scott Jamieson, 22. Ndumba Makeche, 23. Michael Thwaite.\n\nIns:\n\nNick Ward (Wellington Phoenix), Chris Harold (Gold Coast United), Adrian Zahra (Melbourne Heart), Brandon O’Neill (Perth Glory NYL), Ndumba Makeche (Perth Glory NYL), Scott Jamieson (Sydney FC), Michael Thwaite (Gold Coast United), Ryo Nagai (Cerezo Osaka).\n\nOuts:\n\nViktor Sikora (Released, Retired), Adam Taggart (Newcastle Jets), Andrezinho (Released), Josh Mitchell (Newcastle Jets), Chris Coyne (Released), Tommy Amphlett (ECU Joondalup SC- Football West State League), Todd Howarth (Released), Scott Neville (Newcastle Jets).\n\nKey in: Michael Thwaite\n\nThe addition of Thwaite to play alongside former Gold Coast teammate Bas van den Brink is an astute signing from Ferguson and he will help them in playing out from the back if that is his prerogative this season. He’s also a big upgrade over the often injured Chris Coyne and the hot-headed Steve Pantelidis. I would have campaigned for Vidosic to sign him if he wasn’t our rivals’ captain because he would have fitted in perfectly.\n\nKey out: Andrezinho\n\nMost of Perth’s outs are of little to no consequence and are either older players who couldn’t get fit, or youngsters who couldn’t make the grade, but Andrezinho looked lively at times last season and would be the player missed the most. Ferguson has done a solid job imo to cut the deadwood from his squad and bring in some potentially useful signings.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: Depth.\n\n12 months ago Ferguson said ‘what im trying to do is, im trying to get 2 good players for every position’ and I think it’s fair to say that by A-League standards he’s done that. If you look at the above XI and add in Pantelidis, Heffernan, McGarry, Nagai and Harold that’s a reasonable squad of players to choose from. The only issue is they could have used a more proven option upfront to go with Mehmet and Smeltz.\n\nWeaknesses: Upfront.\n\nYes. Shane Smeltz is a top quality striker –for this level- but if you take a look at the other options there’s some question marks for mine. Mehmet was unconvincing imo for much of the season and if something happens to Smeltz it will be up to him to score the goals. The back-ups of Makarounas and Harold have potential but are both still young and lack experience at A-League level.\n\nOne to watch: Josh Risdon\n\nA long term knee injury to Scott Neville opened the door for the youngster to get some games under his belt and he didn’t look back becoming an ever present over the course of the season, so much so that Neville has had to leave to get some 1st team football. Expect his consistency to improve this season as he heads into his 2nd season as a pro.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 22: Won 14, Drawn 5, Lost 3. Goals for 50, Goals against 26. Goal dif +24.\n\nLast Season:\n\nRound 8: Brisbane Roar 4-0 Perth Glory\n\nRound 15: Perth Glory 3-3 Brisbane Roar\n\nRound 22: Perth Glory 0-3 Brisbane Roar\n\nWhen do we play:\n\nRound 1: Pattersons Stadium\n\nRound 12: Suncorp Stadium\n\nRound 18: Nib Stadium\n\nPre-Season record:\n\nAmaZulu 1-0 Perth Glory\n\nPlatinum Stars 0-1 Perth Glory\n\nBidvest Wits 1-2 Perth Glory Perth Glory 3-0 WA State Team\n\nMelbourne Victory 1-2 Perth Glory\n\nMelbourne Heart 0-5 Perth Glory\n\nSeason Preview: Newcastle Jets\n\nAs season 8 of the A-League moves ever close, here’s part 5 of our extensive league wide preview, today taking a look at Newcastle Jets.\n\nLast Season: 7th\n\nLast season started with the sacking of Branko Culina without having even played a match due to the issues surrounding a contract he gave to his son Jason, and was replaced by former Jets championship winning coach Gary van Egmond. They had what could be described as an inconsistent season with a positive start at home over the early weeks backed up by some poor performances on the road.\n\nThey did however cause Brisbane no shortage of problems last year taking the lead in 2 of the 3 games and ended up winning up here in Brisbane. Roar turned the tables in the two fixtures in Newcastle but not before Newcastle gave them a fright. They were right in finals contention until a poor end to the season, culminating in a final day loss in Sydney handed the sky blues a finals berth at the expense of van Egmond’s Jets. Expect them to be up there contending this season.\n\nManager: Gary van Egmond\n\nVan Egmond –who is in his 2nd stint as Jets boss- is now in his 2nd season and has had the chance to overhaul the squad in his image. Out go some key contributors and in their place arrives some tremendous young talent which he can hopefully for their sake mould into a strong unit. Van Egmond is very much from a similar style as Postecoglou with ball possession and pressing the opposition a focus and it’s something his new team should excel at with so many young, exciting, skilful players at his disposal.\n\nSquad:\n\n1. Ben Kennedy, 2. Scott Neville, 3. Tiago Calvano, 4. Josh Mitchell, 5. Dominik Ritter, 6. Ben Kantarovski, 7. James Brown, 8. Ruben Zadkovich, 9. Emile Heskey, 10. Bernardo Riberio, 11. Connor Chapman, 12. Joshua Brillante, 13. Sam Gallaway, 14. Taylor Regan, 15. Craig Goodwin, 16. Jobe Wheelhouse, 17. James Virgili, 18. Jacob Pepper, 19. Michael Bridges, 20. Mark Birighitti, 21. Marko Jesic, 22. Adam Taggart, 23. Ryan Griffiths, 24. Mitchell Oxborrow, 25. Mitch Cooper, 30. Jack Duncan.\n\nIns:\n\nMark Birighitti (Adelaide United), James Brown (Gold Coast United), Adam Taggart (Perth Glory), Scott Neville (Perth Glory), Craig Goodwin (Melbourne Heart), Joshua Brillante (Gold Coast United), Mitch Cooper (Gold Coast United), Josh Mitchell (Perth Glory), Dominik Ritter (FC Winterthur).\n\nOuts:\n\nMario Simic (Sydney United- NSWPL), Nikolai Topor-Stanley (Western Sydney Wanderers), Kasey Wehrman (Released, Retired), Jeremy Brockie (Wellington Phoenix), Tarek Elrich (Western Sydney Wanderers), Byun Sung-Hwan (Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma), Labinot Haliti (Western Sydney Wanderers), Matthew Nash (Parramatta FC- NSWPL), Ali Abbas (Sydney FC), Francis Jeffers (Tranmere Rovers)\n\nKey in: James Brown\n\nWithout going for the obvious one in recent addition Emile Heskey who imo will be a success, youngster James Brown would seem to be a handy pickup for Gary van Egmond. The young midfielder was one of only a few bright spots on Gold Coast’s final season in the competition and being in a more stable environment should bring the best out of him.\n\nKey out: Jeremy Brockie\n\nThe hard working Kiwi was something of a revelation last season with his goals proving to be a vital part of the Jets game. His versatility to play both wide midfield and upfront will be missed by van Egmond this season.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: Squad\n\nFootball is a squad game and when you look at that of the Jets, it certainly looks a strong one. A host of interesting options in the middle to front third of the pitch should give van Egmond everything he needs to be successful regardless of if he opts for 3 or 4 at the back. When you look at the XI listed above and see the quality not included- Brazilian playmaker Riberio, Josh Mitchell, Marko Jesic and Michael Bridges- there’s no shortage of options for the boss.\n\nWeaknesses: Defence\n\nIf I was going to be critical of one aspect of the Jets squad it would have to be their defence which imo could turn out to be their achilles heal. Ritter from all reports is better as a left sided defender than a central one and if he does play at LB it will be up to one of Mitchell/Chapman/Kantarovski to strike up a solid understanding with Tiago. They could also play a back 3 some weeks which is something im not a fan of typically.\n\nOne to watch: Mitch Cooper\n\nCould have chosen any number of players for this one but I’ve opted for Cooper –aka the kid who was at the centre of the beginning of the end for GCU-. In extremely difficult circumstances for the most experienced players, the young Cooper came in and did an admirable job the Coast’s final games and did enough to show that he’s got the talent to make the grade at A-League level. The rest now is up to him.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 22: Won 8, Drawn 8, Lost 6. Goals for 27, Goals against 24. Goal dif +3.\n\nLast Season:\n\nRound 7: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Brisbane Roar\n\nRound 19: Brisbane Roar 0-1 Newcastle Jets\n\nRound 26: Newcastle Jets 1-2 Brisbane Roar\n\nWhen do we play:\n\nRound 9: Suncorp Stadium\n\nRound 16: Ausgrid Stadium\n\nRound 22: Ausgrid Stadium\n\nPre-Season record:\n\nNewcastle Jets 3-1 Broadmeadow Magic\n\nNewcastle Jets 1-0 Rockdale\n\nNewcastle Jets 2-0 Wellington Phoenix\n\nNewcastle Jets 1-0 Brisbane Roar\n\nSydney FC 1-1 Newcastle Jets\n\nNewcastle Jets 1-1 Western Sydney Wanderers\n\nNewcastle Jets 2-1 Central Coast Mariners\n\nSeason Preview: Melbourne Victory\n\nAs season 8 of the A-League moves ever close, here’s part 4 of our extensive league wide preview, today taking a look at Melbourne Victory.\n\nLast Season: 8th place\n\nLast season was an unmitigated disaster in many ways for Melbourne Victory, the supposed biggest club in the country. 2 managers sacked, disappointing performances and a marquee man who struggled to adapt to the Australian game. They started the season by appointing longtime assistant Mehmet Durakovic to the top job following the departure of Ernie Merrick following a disappointing ACL campaign. In addition Victory brought in Australia’s best known footballer Harry Kewell on a marquee deal following protracted negotiations through the media which became somewhat of a circus.\n\nOn the park the Durakovic lead Victory struggled from the get go and after just 3 wins in 14 games and the team languishing in 8th place Durakovic was replaced by Northern Irishman Jim Magilton. Magilton fared little better achieving just 2 wins for the rest of the season before he too was promptly shown the door, along with a few senior players. Finally marquee man Harry Kewell announced that due to family issues he would be opting out of the remainder of his contract.\n\nManager: Ange Postecoglou\n\nRemember him? The guy who lead us to back to back championships and the longest unbeaten run in Australian Football –all codes- history? Well he’s now the enemy as the new boss of the Victory. Obviously all us Brisbane supporters know about his tactics and how he likes the game to be played, and it’s probably fair to expect the same type of game from his new looked Victory side, however from my understanding he’s leaning towards a different shape. Rather than the standard 4-3-3 that he opted for with Brisbane, im told he’s been trying something of a 4-2-2-2 formation without the use of a genuine #9 in pre-season which will be interesting to watch as the season progresses. Apparently Thompson and Rojas have been operating as wide players with Finkler and Flores operating as duel #10’s/ false #9’s. Interesting.\n\nSquad:\n\n1. Tando Velaphi, 2. Matthew Foschini, 3. Adama Traore, 4. Petar Franjic, 5. Mark Milligan, 6. Leigh Broxham, 7. Guilherme Finkler, 8. Jonathan Bru, 9. Marcos Flores, 10. Archie Thompson, 11. Marco Rojas, 13. Diogo Ferreira, 14. Billy Celeski, 15. Sam Gallagher, 16. Theo Markelis, 17. James Jeggo, 18. Danny Allsopp, 19. Isaka Cernak, 20. Lawrence Thomas, 21. Spase Dilevski, 22. Julius Davies, 23. Adrian Leijer.\n\nIns:\n\nAdama Traore (Gold Coast United), Mark Milligan (JEF United Chiba), Guilherme Finkler (Cricuima Esporte Clube), Jonathan Bru (Moreirense), Marcos Flores (Henan Jianye), Sam Gallagher (Central Coast Mariners), Theo Markelis (Vicenza), Spase Dilevski (Adelaide United), Julius Davies (1899 Hoffenheim).\n\nOuts:\n\nFabio Alves (Sydney FC), Matthew Kemp (West Adelaide- SA State League), Grant Brebner (Moreland Zebras- VPL), Jean Carlos Solórzano (LD Alajuelense- loan return), Rodrigo Vargas (Green Gully-VPL), Tom Pondeljak (St Albans Saints- VPL), Carlos Hernandez (Prayag United- India), Ante Covic (Western Sydney Wanderers), Harry Kewell (released), Ubay Luzardo (Assyriska- Sweden)\n\nKey in: Marcos Flores\n\nThe standout player of season 6 in the A-League is back following a less than spectacular stint in the Chinese Super League. Flores is a known commodity in this league and the creative midfield role and should be able to give Victory a link between Thompson and the midfielders.\n\nKey out: Carlos Hernandez\n\nI could have taken the easy option here and just gone with Kewell, but for mine Victory will miss Hernandez far more. Over the course of his 4 seasons with the club the Costa Rican was in the upper echelon of foreign imports with his long range shooting a highlight, and he won many games on his own boots for Victory. They’ll also miss club stalwart Roddy Vargas and their best player last season Ante Covic.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: System\n\nThe one thing we Roar fans know is that Postecoglou always sends his side out for specific targets and a way of play, and I don’t think we should expect anything different from the Victory lead Postecoglou. Whether or not the system works is a question, but you can be sure that Victory will play true to it every minute of every game.\n\nWeaknesses: Defence\n\nWhile Victory have some interesting and exciting players in the final third of the pitch, at the back they look a little shaky for mine. The 1st choice back 4 of Dilevski-Milligan-Leijer-Traore looks solid but atleast one of the youthful backups will need to step up at some stage this season.\n\nOne to watch: James Jeggo\n\nVictory fans didn’t have a great deal to cheer about last season but the emergence of young centre midfielder James Jeggo was one of the highpoints. Given a run in the side towards the end of the season under Magilton, Jeggo is exactly the type of player Postecoglou likes to work with. Expect a breakout season from the midfield man.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 21: Won 7, Drawn 4, Lost 10. Goals for 27, Goals against 34. Goal dif -7.\n\nLast Season:\n\nRound 5: Melbourne Victory 2-2 Brisbane Roar\n\nRound 13: Brisbane Roar 3-1 Melbourne Victory\n\nRound 22: Brisbane Roar 3-2 Melbourne Victory\n\nWhen do we play:\n\nRound 2: Suncorp Stadium\n\nRound 11: AAMI Park\n\nRound 24: Suncorp Stadium\n\nPre-Season record:\n\nMelbourne Victory 1-4 Olympiacos\n\nPort Melbourne 1-2 Melbourne Victory\n\nOakleigh Cannons 0-3 Melbourne Victory\n\nRichmond SC 4-3 Melbourne Victory\n\nBentleigh Greens 0-1 Melbourne Victory\n\nDandenong Thunder 1-4 Melbourne Victory\n\nTasmania XI 0-4 Melbourne Victory\n\nMelbourne Victory 4-2 Adelaide United\n\nMoreland Zebras 0-3 Melbourne Victory\n\nCentral Coast Mariners 1-1 Melbourne Victory\n\nMelbourne Victory 1-2 Perth Glory\n\nSeason Preview: Melbourne Heart\n\nAs season 8 of the A-League moves ever close, here’s part 3 of our extensive league wide preview, today taking a look at Melbourne Heart.\n\nLast Season: 6th (Lost in week 1 of finals)\n\nHeart’s 2nd year in the competition was a success across the board for Melbourne’s 2nd team. They made the finals for the 1st time and played some solid football throughout the season. Their season started slowly but it really picked up pace through the middle rounds before tailing off slightly towards the end. The 3-0 loss in week 1 of the finals will have no doubt stung and they’d be desperate to get another crack at finals football.\n\nManager: John Aloisi\n\nRookie manager John Aloisi has some big boots to fill after John van’t Schip departed the club in March and was given the nod over fellow assistant coach and former Roar striker Ante Milicic- who has since joined Western Sydney’s coaching panel.\n\nAloisi –who spent last season as Heart’s NYL coach- has no other coaching experience but he has played under some of world football’s best and will be looking to bring what he’s learned to bear for the Heart this year. It’s assumed that he will continue with Dutchman van’t Schip’s preferred system of 4-3-3 designed to get the best out of their wide talents like Dugandzic and Behich.\n\nSquad:\n\n1. Clint Bolton, 2. Michael Marrone, 4. Simon Colosimo, 5. Fred, 6. Patrick Gerhardt, 8. Matt Thompson, 9. Josip Tadic, 13. Jonathan Germano, 14. Golgol Mebrahtu, 15. David Williams, 16. Aziz Behich, 17. Jason Hoffman, 20. Andrew Redmayne, 22. Nick Kalmar, 23. Mate Dugandzic. Unknown numbers: Richard Garcia, Steven Gray, Dylan Macallister, David Vrankovic.\n\nIns:\n\nAndrew Redmayne (Brisbane Roar), Patrick Gerhardt (FK Zelijemaker), Golgol Mebrahtu (Gold Coast United), Steven Gray (Oakleigh Cannons- VPL), Josip Tadic (Lechia Gdansk), Dylan Macallister (Gold Coast United), David Vrankovic (Bonnyrigg White Eagles-NSWPL), Richard Garcia (Hull City)\n\nOuts:\n\nRutger Worm (FC Emmen), Kristian Sarkies (Heidelberg United), Maycon (Pahang), Alex Terra (Dajeon Citizen), Kamal Ibrahim (Heidelberg United), Kliment Taseski (Moreland Zebras), Nikola Roganovic (Green Gully), Adrian Zahra (Perth Glory), Craig Goodwin (Newcastle Jets), Eli Babalj (Red Star Belgrade), Wayne Srhoj (released), Brendan Hamill (Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma), Curtis Good (Newcastle United)\n\nKey in: Richard Garcia\n\nFormer Socceroo squad member Richard Garcia brings with him a wealth of experience from England where he spent a decade with West Ham, Colchester and Hull City. There has been some reports that he’s going to be adopting a more central midfield type role as opposed to where we’re accustomed to seeing him play for the Socceroos in the Right Wing/Striker role. Not sure I am buying that one though.\n\nKey out: Eli Babalj.\n\nLet’s be honest- they’ve got a few departures. Some of those are of no significance, others are big losses. The biggest loss is undoubtedly young striker Eli Babalj who burst onto the scene upfront last term with his goals and all round game drawing comparisons with another big Victorian striker in Mark Viduka. He’s now taken a step similar to big Dukes by heading for the Balkans with Red Star Belgrade. Hopefully his career continues to head in a similar direction to Viduka’s.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: Midfield\n\nHeart’s midfield is right up there with the best in the completion for mine. Last season they lacked a holding midfielder but the addition of Gerhardt seems to have filled that hole. They’re blessed with plenty of creativity, steel and speed through the middle of their side.\n\nWeaknesses: Lack of depth\n\nWhile Heart’s 1st XI doesn’t look terrible they do seem to lack depth in their squad, especially in defence. Having Vrankovic as the only specialist defensive cover is some risk by Aloisi. Perhaps Germano will be converted into a defender? Either way with at least 1 spot open in their squad they should be looking to add another defender. Perhaps they’ll bring someone in to help round out the squad but it’s looking unlikely.\n\nOne to watch:\n\nHeart have sold most of their promising young players but Aziz Behich is still there in the Heart defence for another season. The fullback was linked with a move to Turkey during the close season but has opted to stay and cement himself here in the A-League. His runs down the l;eft side promise to be a threat to all opposition this season.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 6. Won 3, Drawn 2, Lost 1. Goals for 11, Goals against 6. Goal dif +5.\n\nLast Season:\n\nRound 10: Brisbane Roar 1-2 Melbourne Heart\n\nRound 18: Melbourne Heart 1-1 Brisbane Roar\n\nRound 24: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Melbourne Heart\n\nWhen do we play:\n\nRound 6: Aami Park\n\nRound 15: Aami Park\n\nRound 26: Suncorp Stadium\n\nPre-Season record:\n\nVictorian Champions League XI 0-4 Melbourne Heart\n\nPort Melbourne 0-8 Melbourne Heart\n\nMelbourne Knights 0-2 Melbourne Heart\n\nNorthcote City 0-1 Melbourne Heart\n\nMelbourne Heart 1-2 Adelaide United\n\nWestern Sydney Wanderers 0-0 Melbourne Heart\n\nSeason Preview: Central Coast Mariners\n\nAs season 8 of the A-League moves ever close, here’s part 2 of our extensive league wide preview, today taking a look at our old adverseries- Central Coast Mariners.\n\nLast Season: 1st (Lost Preliminary Final to Perth Glory)\n\nPremiers –just- and a model of consistency for most of the season, Arnie’s men claimed the top spot in the league with a 2-1 win up here in Brisbane and never looked back. They were cruising towards the Premiership until Brisbane went down to Gosford and beat them in February. From their they limped over the line with some inconsistent performances before being bounced in the playoffs and flattering to deceive in Asia. The loss of key men Rostyn Griffiths and Matt Simon in the title run in didn’t do them any favours either.\n\nManager: Graham Arnold\n\nDespite being written off as a bad coach following an unsuccessful 2007 Asian Cup with the Socceroos, Arnie has come in and done a magnificent job with the club from Gosford. His belief in his system has seen them be equally as consistent and Brisbane were under Postecoglou and the 2 year battle between the Mariners and their 4-4-2 and Roar’s 4-3-3 were really great matches.\n\nArnold typically deploys a narrow 4-4-2 with the fullbacks overlapping to provide the width. They can be more direct at times but they can also get it down and play on the ground. He may have to tweak his formation/style a little this season as they got found out late on in the A-League season, and in the AFC Champions League.\n\nSquad: 1. Matt Ryan, 2. Daniel McBreen, 3. Josh Rose, 4. Pedj Bojic, 5. Zac Anderson, 6. Patrick Zwaanswijk, 7. John Hutchinson, 8. Adriano Pellegrino, 9. Benie Ibini-Isei, 10. Tom Rogic, 11. Oliver Bozanic, 12. Troy Hearfield, 13. Brent Griffiths, 14. Michael McGlinchey, 15. Brad McDonald, 16. Trent Sainsbury, 17. Anthony Caceres, 18. Nick Montgomery, 19. Mitchell Duke, 20. Justin Pasfield, 21. Mile Sterjovski, 22. James Oates, 23. Adam Kwasnik.\n\nIns: Mitchell Duke (Central Coast Mariners NYL), James Oates (Central Coast Mariners NYL) Anthony Caceres (Central Coast Mariners NYL), Zac Anderson (Gold Coast United), Mile Sterjovski (Dalian Aerbin), Brent Griffiths (Wellington Phoenix)\n\nOuts: Stuart Musialik (released), John Sutton (Heart of Midlothian- Loan Return), Sam Gallagher (Melbourne Victory), Mustafa Amini (Borussia Dortmund- Loan Return), Brad Porter (retired), Alex Wilkinson (Jeonbuk Motors), Trent McClenahan (Sydney FC)\n\nKey in: Nick Montgomery\n\nIn what is largely a young and inexperienced squad, former Sheffield United man Montgomery balances it out slightly with a host of experience in the English League system. The tough tackling central midfielder should go some way to replacing Rostyn Griffiths- whom they missed upon his departure to China.\n\nKey out: Alex Wilkinson\n\n‘Mr Central Coast Mariners’ as he’s been labelled, Alex Wilkinson will be a massive loss in many ways for Central Coast this season. His leadership, defensive ability and love for the club made him a fan favourite and one of the league’s top defenders. He’s now moved on to the K-League for a new adventure. It will be up to former Gold Coast United defender Zac Anderson to step up and fill the boots of Central Coast’s favourite son.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: Continuity\n\nFor 2 seasons now Arnold has largely kept the same core together and they have a terrific understanding of how they play and it’s been the biggest factor in their success. 13 members of the squad have been a part of the Mariners setup under Arnold’s regime since day one so expect more of the same this season.\n\nWeaknesses: Inexperience\n\nIt could be that Arnold has tremendous faith in his young players, it could be their ownership situation or it could be something completely different but this Mariners squad has a lot of players with very little experience in it. When you look beyond the starting 11 and the key reserves there’s a lot of if’s and maybe’s about their group. If one or two of them don’t step up into the top 15 this season it could be left to the core from the previous 2 seasons to carry the load, and do they have another run in them?\n\nOne to watch: Tom Rogic\n\nBurst onto the scene late in the year following his time with the Nike Academy and he was a revelation in the final weeks of the competition. Bigger and stronger than Mustafa Amini, Rogic could be one of the players to watch this campaign if he can find a little more consistency in his performances.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 28: Won 15, Drawn 9, Lost 4.

But after a poor start former boss Rini Coolen was sacked in round 11 with a 3-0 defeat away to Gold Coast being the final straw. Current boss John Kosmina came in and went on a 5 game undefeated run before results headed south again. In Asia they beat Indonesians Persipura Jayaspura to qualify for the group stage containing Pohang, Bunyokor and Gamba Osaka. They ended their season at home in the ACL round of 16 with a 1- 0 win over Nagoya Grampus.\n\nManager: John Kosmina\n\nKosmina took over for his 2nd stint at the Reds at the midway point of the season following a poor start under Dutchman Rini Coolen and his results were mixed. On one hand he guided them through a difficult ACL group and into the Quarter-Finals for the 2nd time in their history, whereas on the other he struggled to find consistency in the A-League and his side finished a disappointing 9th last season.\n\nA lot was made of the brand of football played under Kosmina last season and he adopted a counter attacking 4-5-1/4-3-3 shape at the end of the season and in their Asian campaign and it paid off with the Reds conceding very few goals and becoming very tough to break down. We Roar fans saw that 1st hand as Adelaide came to Brisbane via Uzbekistan and put in a solid defensive showing frustrating Brisbane and heading home with a point that ultimately cost Brisbane a 2nd consecutive Premiers Plate. It’s a big season for Kosmina who has now put his own stamp on the squad and results in the league will be expected.\n\nSquad:\n\n1) Eugene Galekovic, 2) Osama Malik, 3) Nigel Boogaard, 4) Jon McKain, 5) Iain Fyfe, 6) Cassio, 7) Zenon Caravella, 8) Marcelo Carrusca, 9) Sergio van Djik, 10) Dario Vidosic, 11) Bruce Djite, 12 Antony Golec, 13) Teeboy Kamara, 14) Cameron Watson, 15) Jacob Melling, 16) Daniel Bowles, 17) Iain Ramsay, 18) Fabian Barbiero, 19) Jake Barker-Daish, 20) Paul Izzo, 21) Jeronimo Morales Neumann, Fabio Ferreira, 23) Evan Kostopoulos.\n\nIns:\n\nTeeboy Kamara (Adelaide United NYL), Iain Fyfe (Busan I ‘Park), Daniel Bowles (Gold Coast United), Jake Barker-Daish (Gold Coast United) , Evan Kostopoulos (Adelaide United NYL), Marcelo Carrusca (San Martin de San Juan- Argentina), Fabio Ferreira (Dulwich Hill- NSW Super League), Jeronimo Morales Neumann (Independiente)\n\nOuts:\n\nMark Birighitti (Newcastle Jets), Milan Susak (Tianjin Teda), Evgeniy Levchenko (released), Spase Dilevski (Melbourne Victory), Ricardo da Silva (released), Daniel Mullen (Dalian Aerbin), Francisco Usucar (Tecinco Universitario- Ecuador)\n\nKey in: Kosmina has opted for youth in a few of his signings however the Argentine winger Jeronimo Morales Neumann has been scoring freely in pre-season and looks to be a handy addition.\n\nKey out: Milan Susak.\n\nTo be fair Adelaide have kept hold of their best and most important players and those that did leave were mainly backups or players that are easily replaced but the defensive duo of Milan Susak and Daniel Mullen are solid A-League defenders who moved to the Chinese League.\n\nPossible starting line-up:\n\nStrengths: Defence.\n\nThe Reds showed towards the end of last season and especially in the ACL that they have a solid defensive organisation and it was a primary reason why they got through their group phase. With McKain, Fyfe, Cassio, Bowles, Boogaard and of course Galekovic in goals they’ll be tough to break down again.\n\nWeaknesses: Goalscoring\n\nLast season Adelaide were hamstrung by their inability to put the ball into the net with just 26 goals scored in 27 league games. With van Djik and Djite both back despite not striking up a solid combination one of them will need to deliver 10+ goals to get Adelaide back into the finals. Creativity from the wide players in Vidosic, Ramsay, Carrusca, Ferreira and Neumann will also be important in putting it in the net more.\n\nOne to watch: Daniel Bowles\n\nEx-Roar NYL defender Daniel Bowles really kicked on under Miron Bleiberg and Mike Mulvey down the coast last season with his marauding runs down the right side a constant threat in their final weeks in the competition. With Adelaide not having a set right back the opportunity is there for Daniel to cement that spot in the reds backline.\n\nRecord vs. Brisbane:\n\nPlayed 22: Won 6, Lost 8, Drawn 8.

If anyone wants to read the Smith review in full here.\n\nBelow are the recommendations from the report:\n\nRecommendation 1: A-League clubs should develop stronger and deeper links to grassroots.\n\nThis should be achieved through:\n\n1.1 FFA, working with stakeholders, should develop a blueprint for Cooperation Agreements (as required by the club participation agreements and Member Federation Charter) between A-League clubs and member federations to promote community engagement and both oblige and enable A-League clubs to forge deep connections with State leagues and juniors\n\n1.2 Disbursements to A-League clubs should be provided and increased at the level planned, to the extent this can be afforded, with disbursements linked directly to clear performance measures including establishing links to the community\n\nThis is fairly obvious no? Of course the clubs should be engaging the local community, and the FFA can play a major role in that. To be fair I think clubs and the league as a whole have made some good steps in this regard, however more needs to be done to engage the entire football community.\n\nRecommendation 2: FFA should explore ways of further enhancing the existing A-League Committee structure, having regard to the following key principles:\n\n• providing the A-League club owners with a formal structured opportunity to contribute to the strategic decision-making affecting the A-League\n\n• developing an annual operating plan for the A-League in collaboration and consultation with owners and a regular process for reporting against the objectives of the plan\n\n• ensuring that ultimately decisions are made in the overall interests of the league\n\n• ensuring and recognising that given the interdependence of the A-League and other strategic pillars of the game as a whole, particularly the important role that talented player development policy plays in the future success of the A-League, decisions regarding the strategic direction of the A-League recognise and factor in this interdependence\n\nThis is an interesting idea from Smith and I think that the owners of the clubs should absolutely have a major say in the direction the league is heading in, after all they are the ones investing the money in the clubs. The idea of the A-League being independent to the FFA is also a valid one imo, and one which would allow the FFA to focus more on the game as a whole and not just the A-League, similar to how the setup is in England.\n\nRecommendation 3: Until the A-League is self-sufficient, measures supporting clubs’ drive to sustainability should be explored as follows:\n\n3.1 Salary cap reforms including options to freeze or reduce the cap and remove the minimum salary\n\n3.2 Strict application of the ‘capacity to afford’ approval criteria for marquee player qualification to ensure that the risks remain with the owners, for example via balance sheet and profit and loss tests, or bank guarantees\n\n3.3 A review of stadia deals and options to reform stadia costs\n\nThis one is highly contentious and we’ve already seen PFA chairman Brendan Schwab come out vocally rubbishing the concept of lowering the salary cap, and I can see his point about the rise in quality over the past couple of years. Without knowing what each club spends on players per season, its difficult to pass comment but in principal I would be against measures that lower the quality of the league. The stadium deal comment is a valid one but im not sure its practical to get them to provide the same services, at a lower cost.\n\nRecommendation 4: The A-League should remain at ten clubs until it is sufficiently strong financially, or where expansion could be demonstrated to significantly contribute to broader sustainability.\n\nThanks for that captain obvious, the only thing I would add that the next expansion has to be in strategic markets, and not just becuase some rich person wants to invest in a certain market.\n\nRecommendation 5: Any changes in ownership of existing A-League clubs should reflect the importance of extensive community and grassroots links and, where appropriate, have broadly based ownership structures.\n\nAgain, an obvious one.\n\nRecommendation 6: FFA should continue to invest in the non A-League components of its business, including grassroots and women’s football, and protect these business lines from the risk of A-League losses.\n\nAbsolutly, infact imo investment in this area should be viewed as essential given the huge numbers and growth in these areas.\n\nRecommendation 7: Within the constraints of its formal obligations to AFC and FIFA, FFA should prioritise its support for national teams, noting the need to balance short, medium and long-term objectives.\n\nWe saw what the FFA goals were earlier in the week and they absolutly should prioritise those things because the Socceroos are the real money spinner for football in this country, and when they are on the rise and playing well in big games, it provides a big boost to the rest of football.\n\nRecommendation 8: FFA should identify, deliver and report on cost reductions to head office. Plans to increase the workforce should be put on hold, with any salary increases funded via further efficiencies. More efficient approaches to travel and other procurement should be explored.\n\nHard to comment on this without knowing what their costs are, but anything take makes the FFA more cost efficient can only be a good thing.\n\nRecommendation 9: The roll-out of new initiatives or programs should be prioritised, with specific consideration of the funding for and timing of the implementation of the FFA Cup. In the absence of an appropriate level of sponsor and broadcast commitment, serious consideration should be given to delaying implementation.\n\nIt’s been mentioned time and again but this FFA Cup has to come in for a host of reasons but most of all it provides a link between ‘old soccer’ and ‘new football’ which absolutly must happen. I find it hard to believe that the FFA couldn’t find a sponsor for this competition and there is surely more than enough broadcasting interest for the competition from both free to air and subscription television.\n\nRecommendation 10: The review considers governance reform is an important area for improvements that have the potential to deliver tangible benefits for football stakeholders, especially at the grassroots. Accordingly it recommends reform continues to be explored initially through the current joint governance review being undertaken by FFA and its member federations.\n\nI think this is absolutly correct, reform in the governance of the game and making it similar across the board would be an important step. Im lead to believe that the FFA have had some discussions on this with the local federations up here and I would assume they have done likewise with other federations around the country. Again anything that links the local clubs with the A-League can’t be a bad thing.\n\nRecommendation 11: In light of the centrality of World Cup qualification matches to the value of broadcast rights, as far as possible within the broader context of communications policy, the government should minimise changes to the status quo in the short to medium-term (capturing the current and next broadcast deal), enabling FFA to package World Cup qualification matches with the A-League and other Socceroos matches, thereby decreasing reliance on government support.\n\nFine, whichever way will bring in the most $$$ for the game is absolutly the way to go. Personally I would love to get one A-League game a week on free to air but if this is the best way financially than thats what they should do. Also, idk if this is feasable but I would try and get a similar deal to what the Wallabies have- games shown on both free to air (9?) and also on fox sports but thats just my own idea. On the whole thou thids review appears to have produced some good ideas, although alot if it is pretty obvious when you sit down and think about it. Hopefully the FFA takes this on board and the game goes onwards and upwards.\n\nHyundai A-League- Round 1 Review\n\nSeason Preview- Central Coast Mariners\n\nLast season: 2nd\n\nGot within a corner kick from winning their 1st championship before throwing it all away with LOLtastic zonal marking and poorly taken penalties, not that anyone reading this will be complaining. Now the Mariners get the chance to set the record straight this season and with their squad they have every chance.\n\nNew Kit: Hummel\n\nUrgh. Its horrible, wtf is with that stitching, and the arrows down the side, truly horrible. Normally I like Hummel kits –look at the W-League kits\n\nfor a good example of a good Hummel kit) but this 1 is just terrible CCM.\n\nCoach: Graham Arnold\n\nThe former Socceroos boss proved a lot of his critics (myself included) wrong last season by getting the Mariners within a corner kick from the Championship, but now he needs to go on with it this season.\n\nCaptain: Alex Wilkkinson\n\n‘Mr Central Coast Mariners’ as the Fox commentary team call him will once again lead the Mariners out this season, and the defender will no doubt once again produce consistent and solid performances at the back\n\nPossible starting 11\n\nFull squad: 1) Matt Ryan, 2) Daniel McBreen, 3) Joshua Rose, 4) Pedj Bojic, 5) Brad Porter, 6) Patrick Zwaanswijk, 7) John\n\nHutchinson, 8 ) Rostyn Griffiths, 9) Bernie Ibini- Isei, 10) Adriano Pellegrino, 11) Oliver Bozanic, 12) Troy Hearfield, 13) Stuart Musialik, 14) Michael McGlinchey, 15) Brad McDonald, 16) Trent Sainsbury, 17) Michael Baird, 18 ) Alex Wilkinson, 19) Matt Simon, 20) Justin Pasfield, 21) Sam Gallagher, 22) Mustafa Amini, 23) Adam Kwasnik.\n\n*Foreigners in italics.\n\nTransfers In\n\nJustin Pasfield (North Queensland Fury), Troy Hearfield (Wellington Phoenix), Brad McDonald (North Queensland Fury), Adriano Pellegrino (Perth Glory), Stuart Musialik (Sydney FC), Mustafa Amini (Borussia Dortmund- Loan).\n\nTransfers Out:\n\nNik Mrdja (Retired), Patricio Perez (Club Atletico All Boys), Marc Warren (Sheffield United), Chris Doig (Pelita Jaya), Paul Henderson (Sydney Olympic), Jess VanStattan (Released), Mustafa Amini (Borussia Dortmund), Matthew Lewis (Blacktown City Deamons)\n\nKey In: Stuart Musialik\n\nTo be honest I don’t think that any of their ins will define their season, yes they are all good players, but they aren’t the type of players that will go and win games for you. Of them all, Musialik is probably the best player, provided he can get back to the form that he had in Newcastle, and not the rubbish he produced for Sydney last season.\n\nKey Out: Patricio Perez\n\nPerez didn’t really add a lot to the Mariners –certainly less than what Arnold trumpeted he would anyway- but for mine they will miss his creativity in the squad. Well, they’ll miss him a lot more than players such as Mrdja, Henderson, Doig, Lewis and VanStattan.\n\nOne to Watch: Bernie Ibini- Isei\n\nHe broke onto the scene late last season and had a massive impact in last years final series and was a key factor in them jumping to that 2-0\n\nlead in extra time, especially with his pace. This season for mine we can expect to see something special from the African born striker.\n\nStrengths: Strength in depth.\n\nYesterday I wrote about the depth that Adelaide has in their squad, well CCM have an equal amount of options at every position. Adelaide’s\n\ndepth is probably stronger in quality but this is a squad packed full of proven A-League performers. Arnold seems to also be the only coach to have gone to the full quota of 23 players, which is an interesting strategy but they will be up there or there abouts again. The squad is also just about 100% Australian born players which is another good quality about their squad.\n\nWeaknesses: Lack of that 1 quality player\n\nYes, it’s a very good squad with some good footballers and plenty of depth, but it does lack that star power or genuine star player- especially up front. This probably isn’t that big of an issue for CCM thou given they have made 3 grand finals without having a genuine marquee in the squad (Aloisi excepted)\n\nStadium: Bluetongue Stadium\n\nLovely little football ground this 1, very picturesque little ground. The leagues club across the road is very nice for a pre/post match drink and feed.\n\nPreseason form: Played 12– Won 10 Drawn 1 Lost 1\n\nVery impressive preseason form from CCM, very similar to that of the Roar actually, a lot of games vs. local sides and rounding it out against\n\nA-League teams. Trips away to Canberra and New Zealand should help the team bond too.\n\nBlacktown City Demons -3 Central Coast Mariners\n\nGHFA Spirit FC 0-2 Central Coast Mariners\n\nCentral Coast Mariners 1-0 Celtic FC\n\nCentral Coast Mariners 1-1 Young Socceroos\n\nBelconnen United 0-5 Central Coast Mariners\n\nCanberra FC 1-2 Central Coast Mariners\n\nBankstown City Lions 0-3 Central Coast Mariners\n\nDandaloo Lions 0-1 Central Coast Mariners\n\nLack Macquarie Roosters 0-3 Central Coast Mariners\n\nCentral Coast Mariners 1-0 Perth Glory\n\nWellington Phoenix 0-2 Central Coast Mariners\n\nAuckland City FC 3-1 Central Coast Mariners"
