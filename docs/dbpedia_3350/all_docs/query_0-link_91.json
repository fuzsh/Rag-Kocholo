Believe me - New Zealand are about as good as some of the SAPL teams when they try to go toe-to-toe with us when we played the in pre-season, were knocking them off 7-0+ with ease.\n\nSeriously. Dry pitch Pantelis would have put it away, dry pitch Qu would've put his earlier one way, and so forth. God knows what the Victory will do to them if they play to that level next Monday.\n\nyeah thats very true, in playable conditions knights would have got thrashed. the game really should have been abandoned or postponed though it really was unplayable. players getting injured all over the place. lol maybe they should sign ian thorpe for their next home game.\n\nits supposed to be summer yet we have been having that cyclone type rain here for ages, i played tennis in it on saturday.\n\njust like to point out im not a knights fan, i just watch the games cos i live here but im not a supporter at all.\n\ninvisibleman18 said:\n\nSoler said:\n\nWe would have won at least 4-0 if that was dry.

I don't rate him as highly as I do the injured Carl Recchia, but I suspect with the recovered Mark Byrnes, he'd get the nod at left back now, showing the good form of Claeys and Leijer. Muscat, our inspirational captain and definately the best captain in the A-League, is an automatic wherever.\n\nSarkies is going to be a gun player. His set pieces are absolutely tremendous, and I know I've bragged about this before, but he is going to be a solid player. He was sacrificed at half time to reinforce the left hand side, but it didnt work as planned at the start of the second half.\n\nFirst goal, Allsopp set up Kitzbichler who struck the ball with his left into the top right hand corner. Nice goal and nice build up too.\n\nSecond goal was definately the best of the game and one of the goals of the season so far. Great one touch passing between Muscat and substitute Ricky Diaco, and Muscat finishes like a centre forward low and right.\n\nThird goal came almost straight away after, with a scramble in the box after some great dribbling by Richard Kitzbichler. The cross then fell to Diaco, who slotted the ball into the back of the net.\n\nA deserved win, despite the commentators saying New Zealand were unlucky to lose by 3 goals to nil. Funny how they keep saying how New Zealand are unlucky. I don't buy it. I think they just suck.\n\nMy Man of the Match is between either Danny Allsopp or Richard Kitzbichler. I chose Kitzbichler in the end because of his fantastic runs and his goal. I love the way he runs at the opposition defenders. Surely he's guarenteed himself a starting spot for next week.\n\nMelbourne Victory - 5\n\nRichard Kitzbichler\n\nKevin Muscat (Pen)\n\nArchie Thompson\n\nArchie Thompson\n\nKevin Muscat (Pen)\n\nSydney FC - 0\n\nAttendance - 18,206\n\nAbsolutely great performance by the Victory. Sort of lessens the pain from seeing West Brom beat us yesterday.\n\nI listened to the game on SEN, since FOX didn't want to show the game, and it was just pure dominance by Melbourne. I can't talk too much about it, since I haven't seen it, but by the sound of things, Kitzbichler, Allsopp and Thompson were awesome as you'd expect from a 5-0 scoreline. Just a bit disappointed that Danny Allsopp didn't get on the scoresheet.\n\nTalay Ufuk got sent off, but the game was already over before he got his marching orders.\n\nThat puts Melbourne on top of the standings, since Adelaide lost at home 2-4 to Newcastle. Sydney were no match. Disappointing!"
