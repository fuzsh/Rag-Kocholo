        "text": "Mark Rudan, the Western United senior coach, has always been a quiet achiever.\n\nAs a professional player he always let his boots do the talking either as a no nonsense central defender or fullback.\n\nLife after football can be very difficult for many former players but Rudan has made the transition to coaching with total aplomb.\n\nAfter cementing his career with NSW NPL 1 club, Sydney United, where his teams won a number of honours, Rudan turned the fortunes of a depressed Wellington Phoenix in the 2018/19 A-League and recently completed an outstanding, maiden season with debutantes, Western United.\n\nHowever, if you ask Mark Rudan whether life is easy in the cutthroat world of football coaching, he will confirm a consistent work ethic , detailed research, analysis and preparation and superior man management skills are essential in any coaching success story.\n\nIn this interview with Roger Sleeman, Rudan reflects on his playing career, coaching experience and football philosophy.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nYou were part of that amazing Sydney United production line of the 1990’s which included Jason Culina, David Zdrilic, Tony Popovic, Ante Milicic, Paul Bilokapic , Ante Moric and Sean and Mark Babic.\n\nCan this ever be replicated?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nFootball goes in cycles but a lot of things we do now on the pitch were done in the 1970’s.\n\nHowever, these days, there are vast improvements in preparation, player welfare and diet.\n\nPeople try to complicate the game but it can be a very simple if you treat it that way.\n\nIn relation to the golden era at Sydney United, you have to remember there was a strong tradition in the Croatian community and a way for our parents to integrate into the wider community through the football club.\n\nConsequently, we gave everything on the football field in recognition of our heritage.\n\nI remember the youth coaches like former Socceroo, Dennis Yaager who helped me so much and in particular,Maurice Sullivan, the legendary club flanker, who coached me in u14’s and was a great influence on my career because he told me if I put the work in I could make the grade.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nWhen you first came through the Sydney United youth system, did you ever believe you would reach the pinnacle in Australian football coaching?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nWhen I first started playing, coaching was the furthest thing from my mind and I just wanted to be the best player I could be.\n\nI wasn’t blessed with exceptional talent but I possessed an inner determination, resilience and a motivation to get the best out of myself which are qualities often more important than star quality.\n\nToday, I regularly see young talented players who have the skills set but don’t have the necessary qualities to fight for success.\n\nMy identification with coaching really developed when I was in Germany at Allemania Aachen with Jorg Berger, my second coach at the club.\n\nHis understanding of the game and ability to adjust tactics and formation during a game and his man management skills, separated him from any other coach I’d known.\n\nHe was the first person who really made me think coaching could be an option after my playing days were over.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nHow much did Les Scheinflug, coach of the Young Socceroos, influence your philosophy of football at the 1995 finals?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nLes was good because he liked me and that does help when the player has the confidence of his coach.\n\nLes made me vice captain to Mark Viduka which was a great honor.\n\nAlso, he played with a back three which I utilise as a coach today.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nWho was the major influence in your playing career and early development?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nYaager and Sullivan encouraged me to have the belief I could go so far in the game but you needed to follow certain steps to get there.\n\nAfter the 1997 World Cup loss to Iran in Melbourne, I went up to my colleagues from the AIS like Muscat, Horvat, Viduka and Moore who inspired me.\n\nAt the AIS, Ron Smith and Steve O’Connor converted me from midfield to central defence and playing next to Craig Moore was a great plus because he coached me in that position.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nWhat did you learn playing in Japan at Avispa Fukuoka during the 2008 season ,and can you relate your experiences?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nI was 32 years of age when Pierre Littbarski took me there after I was coming out of contract with Sydney FC. Fortunately, John Kosmina was prepared to let me go because there wasn’t a long term future at the club for me.\n\nJapan showed me what true professionalism was. If they could train six times a day they would because you had to drag them off the pitch.\n\nI wished I’d gone there when I was younger because it would’ve developed me as a footballer.\n\nTheir youth system intrigued me and in my first training session in Japan, their first touch, positional play and passing ability were incredible\n\nI watched their Youth Academy players who played 50-60 games from 13’s up, while training every day.\n\nWe talk about overkill and overtraining here but you only have to go there to see how they’ve achieved so much which changed my ideas on the youth system as it should be presented in Australia.\n\nFoe every youth player who we rate in Australia, there are a thousand like them in Japan.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nHow important was your coaching experience at Sydney United?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nSydney United is a high pressure club and I believed if I could cut my teeth for 3-5 years, it would be ideal for my coaching preparation.\n\nI wasn’t a player who had a big name and could get a job easily so I had to do it the hard way with the necessary work input to provide longevity.\n\nThe year before , the club avoided relegation by one point so I was able to change the whole structure of the club , including the youth team setup.\n\nIn the first year we became champions of the NPL and we won the Australian Championship.\n\nAll in all we won two Australian Championships, two Premierships and the Waratah Cup in the five years I was at the club.\n\nIt was a great grounding before I received the offer from Wellington which helped me not to be overawed and end up on the scrapheap in the first year.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nYour efforts at Wellington Phoenix were remarkable?\n\nCan you explain how you did it?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nAt the moment I walked into the club , I could see both players and staff were down.\n\nI spoke to each board member, including chairman Rob Morrison and asked, do you think we can win a trophy?\n\nThere wasn’t much belief but I was optimistic and I wanted to rebuild just as I’d done at Sydney United.\n\nIt was a matter of planning to change the objectives and culture of the football club.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nRoy Krishna was a large part of your success at Wellington.\n\nHow did you extract maximum value from him?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nI knew Roy had natural pace and he could finish.\n\nI got to know him well and particularly his background so I was able to gain his respect and assist in his self motivation.\n\nI changed his role to more of a central striker rather than a winger.\n\nI told him before the season started he would be the leading striker in the A-League but he didn’t believe it.\n\nWe worked hard every day on his positioning, different runs and their timing and his finishing.\n\nThe fact he won the A-League Player of the Year and the Golden Boot in 2018/19, followed by Diamanti winning the player of the year in the recently concluded season were proud moments for me.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nCould you tell us about Diamanti?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nAs a coach, I needed to get the best out of him.\n\nInitially, he called me Mr. as all the Italian players do.\n\nHowever, I had to earn his respect and looking at his record, it was no different when I brought Steve Taylor to Wellington who was managed by some great people like Sir Bobby Robson.\n\nDimanti fitted into the culture of the club but I needed to fit him into the team pattern which he proved many times over.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nA feature of your season at Western United was your ability to blend experience with youth, e.g. Diamanti, Berisha, Durante, Calvert and Paine with Perias, Dillon,Skotidis and Cavallo.\n\nIt was a brave step so were you confident of achieving success?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nLong days up to twelve hours in establishing the new player structure was the norm but as a coach it’s my job to get the best out of all players and develop their full potential for the team\n\nRisdon had been out in the cold for a few seasons but came back to his best and returned to the Socceroo squad.\n\nAlso Paine was challenged and had his best year yet and Burgess came out of his shell and really hit his straps.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nBesart Berisha was a revelation during the season.\n\nHow did you achieve that outcome?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nWe knew he hadn’t played much football in the last twelve months after Victory let him go.\n\nOne conversation with him in Germany convinced me I wanted him for the new club because he revealed the mentality I required for the team to succeed.\n\nBerisha is a great professional who doesn’t like being taken off and he gave me the glare when he was replaced in one match. I spoke to him about the importance of working together which really resonated with him.\n\nHe has that winning mentality and was so important in the winning streak of seven wins in eight games post COVID-19.\n\nYoung players looked up to him because in every moment he demonstrated his quest to improve performance, despite his age.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nThat magnificent goal setup by Dylan Pierias for Steve Lustica against Sydney FC in the second last round of normal competition was a spellbinder.\n\nWhy didn’t Pierias get more game time during the season?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nPierias was previously an out and out winger so we had to improve his aerobic capacity for the wingback position. There’s no doubting his electrifying pace as he cruised past King and Tzavellas to design that goal against Sydney F.C.\n\nThis took all year to develop because he had to be trained in the wing back position and we had to improve his defensive qualities.\n\nThese young players are used to playing a 4-3-3 formation and find it hard to adjust to a 3-5-2 system.\n\n4-3-3 only allows you to play with one striker and this is the reason we’re not producing any good strikers at the moment.\n\nROGER SLEEMAN\n\nWhat is the future of Western United?\n\nMARK RUDAN\n\nIt will be the biggest club in Australia within 5 years because its located in the largest growth corridor in the country and some of the best people in Australian football are on the Board and employed in the Executive.\n\nI have a three year deal and I’d certainly like to be there for the opening game of the new stadium which is two to three years off."
