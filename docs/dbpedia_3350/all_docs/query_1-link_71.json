        "text": "BRANKO Culina is comfortable with his achievements as a coach and is ready for the next chapter in his football career.Culina was yesterday appointed technical director of the Newcastle Jets for the next three years.Essentially, the 51-year-old is a replacement for high performance manager Ian Crook, who left last month to take up an assistant coaching role at English Championship club Norwich.As well as overseeing recruitment, scouting and youth development, Culina will map out the direction of the club.\"It is a huge challenge and one I am looking forward to, especially leading up to the Asian Champions League,\" Culina said. \"It is an exciting time for the club.\"Culina, the father of Socceroo midfielder Jason, guided Sydney FC's ACL campaign in 2007, but after a promising start to his reign, he was controversially sacked nine games into the 2007-08 A-League season the year the Jets won the championship. His short time at Sydney FC followed longer and more successful stints at Sydney Olympic (1998-2001) and Sydney United (1994-97 and 2001-03).He won a National Soccer League premiership at Sydney United in 1996-97 and was named coach of the year.The Sydney sacking left a sour taste, but Culina has moved on.\"This is the next chapter,\" he said yesterday. \"I am 51 years old and have gained years of experience.\"They say, 'Once a coach always a coach', and when I'm in the grandstand watching I'm sure the coach in me will surface. But this [technical director] is where my career is best served.\"Jets owner Con Constantine welcomed Culina's expertise, saying his appointment would give the club more credibility.\"When Ian had to go back to his old club, Norwich, I had a lot of coaches approach us,\" Constantine said.\"I ran some of them past Gary van Egmond, and with his approval, we decided Branko is the man to help take the club forward.\"Van Egmond was also looking forward to working with Culina.\"He has lots of experience,\" he said.\"His teams have always played good football. He believes in the way the game has to be played. I am looking forward to using him as an important resource.\"Remo Nogarotto remains as director of football.Culina's first job will be helping prepare for the ACL, but down the track he will act as a link between the football side of operations and Constantine.\"I am there to give Gary the help and support he needs,\" Culina said. \"He has enough to worry about with regards to preparing the team.\"We have similar philosophies to football. That will make things easier in terms of recruitment. I know the type of player he is after. Rather than waiting until a month before a player comes off contract, we can start the evaluation a year out. \"The development of a youth academy is also very important. \"Culina will commute from Sydney initially but plans to move to Newcastle.\"I think it is important that I am part of the community and know the football landscape,\" he said."
