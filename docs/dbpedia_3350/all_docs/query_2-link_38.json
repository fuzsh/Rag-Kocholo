        "text": "Bear said:\n\nChampions - Sydney FC\n\nPremiers - Sydney FC\n\nMariners position on the ladder - 5th\n\nMariners player of the season - Doig\n\nMariners top scorer - D-Mac\n\nA-League top scorer - Smeltz and Aloi$i\n\nWooden Spoon - Wellington\n\nYoung player fo the season - Travis\n\nHAL Player of the season - Jason Culina\n\nCoach of the year - That bloke from Sydney\n\nOut of the Left Field prediction(s) - Aloi$i will be good. Newcastle and Fury will make the 6.\n\n1. Sydney\n\n2. Melbourne\n\n3. Gold Coast\n\n4. Newcastle\n\n5. Mariners\n\n6. Fury\n\n7. Adelaide\n\n8. Perth\n\n9. Roar\n\n10. Wellington\n\ni hope you dont get slammed for the LoLosi comments but i tend to agree, Kossie's style of play was nothing like what is required for Aloisi to be successful... his time with us was more fruitful because our width gave him more time on the ball in more centralised positions as opposed to sydney last season who played really narrow alot of the time.\n\nFrom what i know of their new coach, he likes to play possession style football which should suit him, we know he isnt the kind of player who is going to make runs off the ball to create something which is what he needed to do last season.\n\nQuestion is, can his confidence return and his knee hold up to it, i think he will be alright this season too.\n\nI've had a gut load of the media (yet again) So I'm changing my predictions and would encourage everyone else to reconsider also. This time I'm going to follow the medias lead and simply call it as I see it from now on. No more agendas or bias, this time its just some genuine good ol football analysis...\n\nChampions- Mariners\n\nPremiers - Mariners\n\nMariners player of the Season - Someone Scottish - or at the very least anglo.\n\nMariners Top Scorer- A scotsman\n\nA-League Top Scorer- A Mariner ...who also happens to be Scotsman\n\nYoung Player of the Year- Scottish\n\nHAL Player of the Year- Scottish\n\nCoach of the Year- Most likely Scottish (Wish I could get odds on that)\n\nOut of Left Field Prediction - Craig Fabiano, Hernadez Foster as he is better known to his friends, is found dead in an alley with a claymore down his throat and a haggis shoved up his arse. His dying words were reportedly about how strongly he recommends that everyone get a brazilian. Unfortunately no one seems to give a crap what Craig Fosters pubes look like except of course for Les. (Word is that he's a big fan of ARSE SHAVEN too.) Be Champions!\n\nTable according to Scottishness...\n\n1. Mariners\n\n2. Melbourne\n\n3. Fury\n\n4. Brisbane\n\n5. Perth\n\n6. Adelaide, The coaches brother once played for a Scotsman.\n\n7. Sydney, they used to have a scotsman.\n\n8. Wellington, they have the kind of countryside that a scotsman could appreciate. Besides a player used to play for them who once played for a scotsman and then left them to once more play for a scotsman.\n\n9. Gold Coast, because like every other club in the world with money... they want to waste the bulk of it on average Brazilians. Much cheaper to waste your money on average scotsman.\n\n10. Newcastle. Like theres anywhere else you can put the jest?"
