        "text": "Fox Sports football commentator Mel McLaughlin previews round 11 of the A-League season and gives you her tips for every game.\n\nThese two have gone backwards and need to get back into the winners' circle fast. The big question is: where have the goals gone? Perth haven’t won since the last time these two met back in round five at nib Stadium. Since then, just a single goal has been conceded in each game, including three losses and two 1-1 draws. Remarkable. And they generally haven’t been outplayed, so there will be some genuine soul-searching going on right now. A goal from Melbourne Heart substitute Golgol Mehbrahtu in the last few minutes of the game was the difference last week, with Perth left to ponder once again what went wrong.\n\nOnly two points separate these two but it’s the Jets in the all-important top six as it stands, but this team haven’t won since round six and have leaked nine goals in four games and scored just three in that time (all in one game).\n\nCrucially for Perth, Michael Thwaite and Scott Jamieson return from Socceroos duty, as does former Glory player now Jet Adam Taggart. But will he feature? Fresh from two goals in the green and gold (the first teenager to do so in over 30 years) he may, but it’s a strange situation, the youngster yet to set the A-League alight but already making his mark for his country. Ryan Griffiths is back from suspension as is Josh Mitchell, while Tiago could be on track to return from injury.\n\nDefensively, Newcastle have continued to have problems so they could do with added steel. I’m stating the obvious, but Emile Heskey and Shane Smeltz both clearly need to get back in the goals.\n\nMy tip: I think Perth will get the win here, but I find these two currently very hard to separate.\n\nMelbourne Victory v Brisbane Roar, AAMI Park, Saturday 5.30pm (EDT)\n\nThis is my pick of the round, and don’t believe anyone who says it’s not about revenge ...\n\nIt’s about passion, pride, proving a point, and surely a touch of revenge. Who could forget what happened the first time these guys met, with Ange Postecoglou on the other side of the fence? Drama, controversy, harsh words, even t-shirts were made and worn (\"In Rado We Trust\" – pretty tacky in my opinion) and the small matter of the 5-0 landslide win to Brisbane. The Roar were highly motivated and wiped the floor against a team that, regardless of missing some key players to international duty, were poor. Postecoglou looked genuinely at a loss to explain what went wrong. Things have changed dramatically since then - Brisbane are equal bottom and have won just two games since, while Victory have improved dramatically and had some big wins. However, that includes a defensively poor performance against Adelaide last week. Leaking four goals was a reminder there is still a way to go if they are to be genuine contenders this season. In fairness, they were missing Archie Thompson, Mark Milligan and Adama Traore, who should make a big difference on Saturday.\n\nHow the Roar didn’t score at Parramatta Stadium was largely due to excellent defending, a great save from Ante Covic, and, quite simply, they were unlucky.\n\nThe intensity needs to return – as does Mitch Nichols to the starting eleven, he was excellent when he came off the bench, and nearly scored an absolute cracker.\n\nMy tip: Except this one to be open, fast and exciting – Melbourne Victory to win.\n\nNMData: A-League Ladder\n\nSydney FC v Western Sydney Wanderers, Allianz Stadium, 745pm Saturday (EDT)\n\nThe second ever Sydney derby – this time, in the Sky Blues’ backyard, and both take in winning form.\n\nSydney FC returned home from the place they have the worst record - Wellington - with all three points. Frank Farina made his full debut as coach, seated on the sideline and two of their most promising younger players, Sebastian Ryall and Rhyan Grant, did the damage. Oh, Alessandro del Piero was out injured. Finally a win and a win without their superstar.\n\nMeanwhile, Western Sydney took down the Champions – they had their own chances early on before keeping out wave after wave of attack, and finally a penalty in the final few minutes saw their marquee man Shinji Ono score his first goal for his team. With that came a much-needed win.\n\nOn Saturday, the Wanderers travel to Allianz Stadium for the first time and a suitably bumper crowd is expected for it. Amazingly it’s fourth vs tenth with just three points separating them, but with Adelaide and Central Coast starting to put space between themselves and the rest points are at a premium. In their first encounter Sydney FC took the points, keeping the first clean sheet of the season and only their second so far.\n\nBrett Emerton and Terry Antonis are back from the successful East Asian Cup qualifiers and with del Piero also doing everything he can in a bid to be fit in time this is where we get a better indication of how Farina plans to use his players. It's a huge occasion for him to test it all out – and he’ll do so without suspended captain Terry McFlynn. As for Sydney's goal scoring options, a solution is seemingly imminent ...\n\nLast week’s goal scorers Ryall and Grant have been two of the stand-outs for the Sky Blues, and Jason Culina’s return continues to be a big positive.\n\nFor the Wanderers, it’s Shinji Ono who has improved week after week and is a key man here, as is the returning Socceroos midfielder Aaron Mooy. Yousef Hersey was our man of the match last week and will also be a big threat down the wing. They did a great job defensively on Brisbane, Ante Covic included, but, as always, they must become consistent at the other end.\n\nDel Piero says his team must continue to fight for their season, while Culina has described this fixture as a tough, technical derby. Their rivals from the west will make life very difficult on Saturday.\n\nMy tip: Sydney FC – this was the hardest to tip!\n\nAdelaide United v Wellington Phoenix, Hindmarsh Stadium, Sunday 5pm (EDT)\n\nEleven points separate Adelaide and Wellington, the Reds making a big statement last Friday with their emphatic win. It was an outstanding performance over Melbourne Victory while the Phoenix were upset and outplayed by Sydney FC at home.\n\nWhere to start with the positives from United’s performance? The cracking goals, youngster Evan Kostopoulos scoring his first goals and sensational performances from revelation Fabio Ferreira and Marcelo Carrusca.\n\nTheir depth is a key factor in their success to date, their bench is generally far superior to that of the opposition, and includes the likes of Jeronimo Neumann, who only this week extended his contract with the Reds.\n\nOn the other hand, the Phoenix had their good run halted by Sydney in their own backyard, Ricki Herbert almost disgusted at his team’s performance, saying they \"failed\" to perform across the board. Whether the display was down to simply an off day remains to be seen, but given their at times dismal away record, every point at home counts. Herbert has largely stuck with the same starting eleven, but has hinted at shaking things up at Hindmarsh. Fans are becoming frustrated with a perceived lack of creativity in the midfield, and grinding out results seems to be starting to wear thin – especially when they’re not even doing that. Dani Sanchez could return from injury, but will he be the difference? Paul Ifill is only showing glimpses of what he can do at the moment as well."
