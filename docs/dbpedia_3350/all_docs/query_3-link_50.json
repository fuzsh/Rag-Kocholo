We have a good mix of talent and I can-t wait to join the team to add some more experience to our playing roster.”\n\nJets Coach, Branko Culina expects the midfielder to be in full contact within the month and available for trials at the back end of the pre-season.\n\n“Last night we were without Jason, Kasey Wehrman, Ben Kantarovski and Nikolai Topor-Stanley so the sooner our key players are on board the better,” the coach said.\n\n“It-s important that Jason returns and he has been progressing well. I expect to see him joining the team within two to three weeks.\n\n“From there it-s important we give him as much game time as possible to have him fit and ready to go for the season proper.”"
