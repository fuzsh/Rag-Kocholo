Mark moved on to Parma in 2002 and helped the club to 5th place and a UEFA cup spot in his first season there. Mark continued scoring for Parma and had established himself as a Socceroos regular.\n\nPerhaps his most memorable moment in the green and gold was his goal against Uruguay in 2005. His goal tied the all important World Cup qualifier at 1-1 (on aggregate) and proved to be vital as the scores stayed locked.\n\nIn 2006, Mark was an important member of the Socceroos World Cup team and played in all of Australia’s matches, a tournament where the Socceroos surprised many and reached the second round. After the World Cup he signed for Serie A side Palmero. Mark played in the 2007 Asian Cup for the Socceroos and was also the target of Manchester City, having a seemingly done deal fall through.
