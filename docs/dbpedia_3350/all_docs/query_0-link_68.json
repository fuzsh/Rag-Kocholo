        "text": "Former Socceroo turned property developer Jason Culina and his interior designer wife Terri have secured their next residential home project.\n\nHaving a history of successfully flipping projects around Putney, they have instead gone to the Hills.\n\nThey have spent $3.85 million on a vast home in Glenhaven, which they intend to renovate.\n\nMORE: Latrell Mitchell’s controversial farm for sale\n\nByron prices plummet in ‘reverse Hemsworth effect’\n\nThe grand English Tudor-style manor was marketed as King of the Hill, being one of the finest houses in the Hills District, by Century 21 The Hills District agents.\n\nSet on 2575 sqm on Binet Way in the Sandhurst Estate, the home was masterbuilt by Binet Homes in the late 1980s.\n\nSpanning two levels, the country-style manor has views to the Blue Mountains.\n\nIt has four bedrooms, a study, and a rumpus room with wet bar, fireplace, high ceilings and exposed beams.\n\nIts established gardens have a salt water, gas-heated pool and jet spa and cabana, plus a championship tennis court.\n\nThe cul-de-sac home, which has sandstone and brick retaining walls, last traded for $3 million just under two years ago when it was bought by well-known fruit and vegetable wholesaler Murphy Moses.\n\nIt was once marketed as Chateau d’Amour, and before that it was known as Arundle Manor.\n\nThe Culina couple have flipped houses in Putney over the years, as well as one in Denham Court.\n\nIn late 2021 they sold a new build at Putney in a joint venture for $3,575,000, then made the move to the Gold Coast, buying a near-new home in Mermaid Beach for $2,775,000, which they retain.\n\nThey sold their revamped Putney home for a tidy profit in 2017 when they wanted $3.2m and secured $3.48m. The home had cost $1.77 million three years earlier.\n\nMORE: Huge interest as Delta Goodrem’s home sold\n\n‘Scare’ tactics Jackie O used to win $20m home ‘war’"
