        "text": "Title-contenders Sydney FC fly across the Tasman with more than just victory over the Phoenix on their mind.\n\nA win in Saturday's early game would take Sydney to the top of the table, temporarily at least, but it would also ensure they leave for home with a share of the record they hold jointly with Ricki Herbert's team.\n\nIn holding Hyundai A-League leaders Melbourne Victory 1-1 at Westpac Stadium in the round-17 opener on Friday night, the Phoenix equalled Sydney's record of 14 successive home games without defeat.\n\nThey face another acid test this week, in a game at Palmerston North.\n\nMelbourne were the only team in the top three not to win in round 17.\n\nSydney closed to within three points of the top of the table with their 4-1 home win over North Queensland Fury with Alex Brosque scoring a goal in each half. They led 4-0 before Terry Cooke got one back.\n\nShane Smeltz was back on the score sheet for Gold Coast United in their 2-1 home win over Central Coast. He scored after 68 minutes to bag the equaliser after Matt Simon had opened. Andrew Barisic grabbed the 77th-minute winner for Gold Coast.\n\nAfter a scoreless first half, visiting Brisbane Roar went ahead in Perth in the 54th minute when Luke de Vere scored. Jamie Harnwell equalised 25 minutes later.\n\nNewcastle Jets were the only team to win on the road. Matt Thompson scored in first-half stoppage time and Jin-Hyung Song slammed home an 82nd-minute penalty, leaving Adelaide at the bottom of the table.\n\nUnlike in Wellington where the home side claimed 12 corners to Melbourne's five, there were only a total of eight in Sydney and Adelaide.\n\nCaptains figured on the goalscoring and yellow card lists across the round. Thompson scored for Adelaide, Rodrigo Vargas for Melbourne and Steve Corica for Sydney while Phoenix captain Andrew Durante was booked. Gold Coast captain Jason Culina was also yellow-carded.\n\nIn the match of round 18, Central Coast are at home to Melbourne in the second of three games on Saturday."
