        "text": "PlayStation4 National Premier Leagues NSW Men’s side Sydney United 58 have moved swiftly in appointing one of its former favourite sons and ex-Socceroo midfielder Jason Culina as head coach for the 2018 season.\n\nThe 37-year-old who made a name for himself with the former NSL giants as well as Sydney Olympic had an illustrious career as a footballer as he played for Dutch giants Ajax as well as FC Twente and PSV where he played in a number of UEFA Champions League matches as well as winning a fair share of silverware before returning to Australia.\n\nHaving been capped 58 times for the Socceroos, after Culina called time on his playing career in the Hyundai A-League, the Melbournian switched his attentions to coaching.\n\nThe elegant midfielder joined the King’s School football coaching staff in 2015 before moving to St Joseph’s College where he became the school’s technical director of football.\n\nMore recently, he took charge of PlayStation4 National Premier Leagues 3 NSW Men’s side Fraser Park alongside his father and well known coach Branko as well as brother Dean where they are fighting for promotion.\n\nThis appointment comes on the back of the club saying farewell to Mark Rudan who has moved on with assistant coach Tomi Vidovic taking charge of the Reds in their Westfield FFA Cup Round of 16 match-up against Heidelberg United next Wednesday."
