        "text": "Where is Lindsay Wilson these days?\n\nIf you're wondering who, then here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Wilson_(footballer)\n\nHe had a decent NSL career, including earning 2 Socceroos caps in 2001, before heading out to Europe. He was with PSV for 4 years but never got a first team cap. He had decent loan stints at some other Dutch clubs as too Kilmarnock in the SPL.\n\nBut since July of 2006, when he trialled with Dundee United but was unsuccessful in gaining a contract, he's pretty much disappeared from the radar!\n\nHis Wikipedia entry reflects the little information there exists about his where abouts post 2006.\n\nI ask because he obviously seems/seemed a decent calibre player, the kind of player who'd be a reasonable pick up for an A-League side. And he caught my eye again, as he started out at the Canberra Cosmos and if Canberra gets an A-League team in 2011,then Wilson would be 31 then, so still good for a couple seasons atleast, if they wanted to pick him up.\n\nOk, getting capped for Australia back in the days when we wre in Oceania, may not seem such a big deal. But still, he played Dutch 1st Tier, with FC Volendam and SPL, with Kilmarnock. So he was no slouch, that's for sure.\n\nHe's only 29 now - at the peak of his career, one would think! But he disappeared a good 2 years ago now.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nStill in Europe somewhere? Back here in State League? Retired from Football?\n\nI'm on the case.\n\nSo far I've discovered that he was on loan to Kilmarnock, with the most recent article dated April 28th, 2006, claiming that his loan period from PSV was almost up - the next logical place to search for me now is PSV.\n\nI'll get back with more info soon\n\n31st August, 2006\n\nAnd a further PDF summary shows much the same news repeated, later on:\n\n11th September, 2006\n\nHe really does seem to disappear after that, but I'll keep searching. At least we've managed to fill in a bit of a gap. Looks like he was still in Holland, last we saw.\n\nMore updates: Wilson was eyeing a chance to play for Dundee United after being released from PSV and was actually trialling with them for a period of time as they went on a tour through Denmark. He was later informed that his trial would not continue.\n\nSince then, I've also lost the hunt, mate. I guess after Kilmarnock in 2006, he had intentions of sticking around in Scotland somehow, eyeing off the chance to be called up for the Socceroos if he played enough football, but it didn't eventuate.\n\nCase Findings: The guy's in Siberia somewhere. The trail stops cold after the 2005/2006 SPL Season with Kilmarnock. Links to Dundee United didn't eventuate and a mutual agreement to end his tenure at PSV were the last major points of his career - which has all but vanished for 2 years.\n\nIt IS a bit of a mystery, isn't it? We've had mysteries over a couple other notable stars who faded - like that highly touted 13-14 yo Adam Hardy of Marseille (Who even featured on SBS when he moved), who we subsequently never heard from (Never made Marseille Reserves, our Joeys or anything). But thanks to some one on here, we learned he apparently suffered debilitating injury problems, which severely hampered his progress at Marseille and forced him to retire from the game by his mid-late teens. We also learned by his very late teens/very early 20s (time of our inquiry), he was back in Sydney (I think it was) studying at Uni (But still kicking the footy around, but only at social level).\n\nIt's quite sad when such talents fall away like that, due to injury or whatever reason. Jamie McMaster, the 'Other Kewell' (As in other very young Aussie who went to Leeds around the same era), who chose England's youth teams and looked like the nexdt big thing, but fizzled fast come earlier this decade. But atleast with he we always had some idea where he was at, thanks to the comprehensive coverage the English lower leagues and even reserve leagues, get. But yeah, atleast he returned to the A-League and did ok for a while, but last I hear we went to try his luck overseas again, after being released by Central Coast? Either that or playing NSW State League.\n\nBTW Given his pedigree, I'd suggest he be another who'd be seriously worth trialling for these expansion clubs of the A-League. He could still be another prodigal son/comeback kid, if given the chance.\n\nNick Rizzo is another - so touted when with Liverpool and even his season at Palace, but then off to Italy then injuries and anonyomity ensued (Inpart due to lack of first team). But thankfully like Hayden Foxe, Michael Ferrante and others, he's back in Australia, with the A-League.\n\nHopefully guys like Lindsay Wilson and others who may or may not be like those I've mentioned, will return from the wilderness. Hopefully McMaster, Louis Brain, Anthony Doumanis, Bradley Groves and the like, will also get another crack at the A-League, or in Doumanis and Groves' case, Australia's Premier Domestic League.\n\nHeard back yet? But no worries either way ofcourse.\n\nIs he in FM 07, FM 08 or FM 09 though? That IS the question.\n\nAh thanks for that - so I see he's still in the game, though that isn't saying much as I'm not sure if FM deletes that many players from their database unless they're known to them to be retired, deceased or what have you. But not being perfect, dare I say, they can be slow to update some of these things or just overlook them.\n\nSorry what I mean is, while FM and their fairly well informed/scatterbrained database is pretty useful when it comes to this kind of thing, at times coming on such a player in the game may just be a case of their leaving him there due to oversight or just wanting to leave them there as they have no better idea than we as to the player's current status (As a bit like Wikipedia, it's often we, or those like we, who contribute to the game's database/scouting ofcourse).\n\nBut yeah thanks for that - atleast it shows what FM knows and doesn't know, or what have you."
