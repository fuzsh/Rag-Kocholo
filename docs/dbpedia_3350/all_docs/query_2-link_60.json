        "text": "Another week another goal conceded for Sydney FC\n\nAnother week another game against 10 men for Sydney FC\n\nAnother week another win for Sydney FC.\n\nBut are Sydney any good...against 11 men?\n\nThe Crowd.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic to see 25,000 plus decked out in red at Adelaide Oval for football. And don't those Adelaide fans wear the colours. A great sight.\n\nThe Game.\n\nSydney started woeful...again. Easily outplayed last week in Gosford conceding two. In Adelaide, United were slow out of the blocks, maybe the heat, but Sydney were slower.\n\nWhen Adelaide went 1 up through a Kristian Sarkies goal, Sydney were in disarray, and had been for some time.\n\nPasses going astray from midfield. Little sight of Steve Corica or any of the forwards.\n\nAnd both Tony Popovic and Mark Milligan were caught up field for the Adelaide break which Bobby Petta did his best to slow down to give the lads a chance to get back, but it didn't work as headless Chook Ruben Zadkovich collided with Clint Bolton and Sarkies slotted the loose ball\n\nThe Send-Off.\n\nBall over the top by Poppa, Alex Brosque caught it has to be said by Robbie Cornthwaite and the softest of soft red cards awarded by referee Matthew Breeze. It wouldn't have surprised me to see Alex Brosque get booked for milking it.\n\nAnd suddenly Sydney were back in a game they had again looked second best in all night.\n\nGame changed. Sydney slow men, Steve Corica, Poppa and Terry McFlynn were able to get more involved. The confidence of the team lifted immediately in direct proportion to the Adelaide side who seemed to lose the game in that one moment.\n\nThe future\n\nAdelaide are gone surely, but if Bobby Petta can remain fit they may still sneak in the four. Every game is a Cup Final for them. But realistically they are out.\n\nSydney? Who knows? They still look ordinary very ordinary against eleven but who would bet against them.\n\nWell I would:)\n\nHighlights\n\nBobby Petta's performance. A joy in the forward line, away from the wing. Hope he stays fit.\n\nBrendan Santalab's wonderful wonderful goal.\n\nThe red-shirted Adelaide crowd a record in South Australia and another great night to ponder for the future of our wee game in this country.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nI know we're all supposed to get as many beers out as possible today and either go to the MCG today or watch as much cricket on the telly.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nThe Australian's Mike Coward implores us to get to the ground today for the good of the game, to show support for test matches etc.\n\nFine if you love your cricket and clearly many do, but I was wondering if it is time to introduce a full round of A-League football games. There are many Australians who can cope with more than one sport on a given day, even better live sport in their city.\n\nThe cricket is an institution, but it's only played in Melbourne and only during the day.\n\nSo bring on the football in NZ, and Perth where time difference could work favourably. Sydney and Central Coast could also do with a litle football on Boxing Day.\n\nI reckon this country can cope with two sports in one day across the nation, and does anyone outside of Sydney Yacht club really care about that Boat race?\n\nAustralia has changed forever. Cricket, apart from the English tests, isn't really getting the crowds or interest it once was.\n\nSo come on FFA never mind worrying about the AFL and NRL season's let's build tradition and walk right over the summer festivals and the cricket season.\n\nExpand the season with a couple of more teams and throw in a few extra Christmas rounds to liven things up, and watch the cricket administrators chuck in a few more of those fantastic twenty twenty games to get everyone cricket focused.\n\nThe Central Coast/Sydney game showed me many things the other night. But most of all it showed me the value of strategic games placed around the Xmas period.\n\n17,500 in Gosford on the Saturday BEFORE Xmas.\n\nBoxing Day football, it's got a ring\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nThe Heff has been pushed and pushed over the last few weeks as almost a definite starter in the Socceroos Qatar World Cup qualifying game in February.\n\nBut he broke his tibia in the \"classic game\" between the Mariners and Sydney FC on Saturday night.\n\nBut was Dean Heffernan really ready for the job? No way, ask Adam Biddle!\n\nOf course he can't play now but hearing so many experts calling for Heffernan to start at left-back left me wondering what these so-called experts have been watching this season.\n\nHeffernan scored heaps of goals from left-back in season one. Everyone agreed this was amazing for a full-back and amazing for the A-League.\n\nOff to Germany he went but never got a game with Nurnburg Hyundai A-League FC.\n\nWhy not?\n\nAccording to Dean the three ball sessions per day in Germany were significantly different to the one ball session and one gym session per day he has had with the Mariners since he has been back.\n\n\"I'm hoping my touch has improved at least with all that ball work,\" Dean told me at a pre-season game in Canberra in July.\n\nSo now Dean is out, perhaps cooler heads can analyse his performances.\n\nHe's still attacking although not scoring. In recent games against Sydney, where it was party time, and Adelaide away, his forward movement has been important for his team. Although I reckon his forward play hasn't been as effective as it was in season one.\n\nHis defending has been woeful. Discipline problems persist. At free-kicks and corners he can play a very dangerous game of elbowing the opponent in the head. A high-risk strategy.\n\nAnd worryingly to me all season has been his defensive capabilities. Maybe this is why he never got a game in Germany.\n\nAnd Saturday revealed the worst and perhaps most important part of a possible left-sided Socceroos game.\n\nWith the scores at 3-3. The Mariners were back in the game, despite their ten-men. Somehow Tony Popovic had contrived to earn the Mariners a penalty. His experience:) Either way the ten-man were back at 3-3 and looking like a point.\n\nThen Adam Biddle the Sydney FC winger tore away with the Heff, chasing hard. One on one. Pace and experience against Biddle.\n\nA great test for the Qatar game I thought.\n\nBiddle not only got to the ball first, kept it and bashed the Heff off, then managed to waltz around him without even a sniff of Lionel Messi type skill.\n\nAnd the Heff had done nothing, neither forced him wide, held him up or tackled. He didn't even make a foul, very unlike the Heff or any A-League professionals in such a situation but there you go.\n\nBiddle went in and scored. A great goal.\n\nFor me Qatar will probably pose more threat, more pace, skill and more craft than Biddle has yet to show. And the Heff could have been cruelly exposed.\n\nWe need him in the A-League. The Mariners love him. I love to watch him go forward, but he is not an international defender in any one's terms.\n\nDefence first eh Pim and then the rest of the stuff.\n\nDean Heffernan should not be our first choice Socceroo left-back for the home qualifiers.\n\nIf it is to be an A-League player, Nikolai Topor-Stanley or maybe even Matt Thompson from the Jets.\n\nI'd go with Topor-Stanley. A player on the rise, an Olyroo with experience and the outstanding left-back of the A-League this season. And with Asian Champions League football he has played at a higher level than the Heff.\n\nA bit to learn, who hasn't, but he'll be in good shape should we actually get to the World Cup. Still young and raring to go.\n\nFor the Heff hopefully a speedy recovery. Football can be a cruel game. On Saturday night in one of the best domestic football games this country has ever seen, the Heff's season and immediate footballing future was ripped away from him.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nGood to see Steve Bryant, local Canberra football legend, writing a wee post in today's Daily Telegraph.\n\nI don't agree with what he says. I'd rather see Australia playing 14 games of World Cup Qualifiers every four years and MISS out on World Cup qualification then play two games against the fifth placed South American side, even if we are now capable of beating that fifth placed side these days.\n\nGreat to see another Canberra football fan in print....I think that makes two of us now!!!\n\nRead Steve's article below:\n\nSteve writes:\n\nDon't start moaning now about the group of death for us to go through to the World Cup Finals.\n\nThe Australian game has been complaining more than 20 years that it's not fair, yet now we are having a go about the draw for qualifying through Asia.\n\nIn the past, as we all know, we had to realistically play two games-one away and one at home- against the fifth placed South American side.\n\nLooking at that, we can match anybody on our own soil with our right team playing and with the right coach can go to any place in the world and be smart enough to come away in not too bad shape, which I thought was something of a luxury.\n\nNow we are looking at playing full-strength international sides where most of the time we will not have our full complement, in hostile places with immense heat and possibly having to use A-League players who do not have any experience of such environments and maybe just aren't good enough.\n\nWe should have kept quiet about he back door entry we formerly had because most international sides would be laughing if FIFA said to them, \"play two games win on aggregate and you have secured a place in the World Cup.\"\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nThe Beckham fest in February in Hawaii includes J-League Cup Champs Gamba Osaka and American Champs Houston Dynamo's and an Aussie side.\n\nWhich one?\n\nNo-one knows.

The Jets were breaking at pace. Denni outpacing Seb Rayall and finding plenty of space.\n\nBut Victory scored through Carlos Hernandez. Surely if ever a team would get some confidence it would be Victory.\n\nBut the forward threat of Melbourne doesn't concern many these days.\n\nAnd the Jets have a canny coach who works a plan. He may not have the names of Victory, Gary Van Egmond may even have to play the Chairman's picks but he works a system and that is why they are in the top four.\n\nThey also have Joel Griffiths. Held tightly by Matty Kemp, Griffiths moved away to find space and orchestrated one of the goals of the season from Brazilian Denni.\n\nVictory conceded before half-time and again after half-time.\n\nWhat a goal. Griffiths bent it from outside the post. A joy to watch.\n\nAnd Griffiths finished the job as the Victory defence's soft-centre appeared once more.\n\nKevin Muscat was half the player he was last year, Kaz Patafta looked tired, Archie Thompson tried but couldn't finish when required.\n\nVictory were lively in parts, but simply, they are not a team.\n\nConfidence is low across the park and the Jets enjoyed an easy victory.\n\nThe Jets are on a roll. Have the home support to bring the team home in the final games and enough creativity in Denni, Griffiths and Bridge to cause a few problems.\n\nVictory have the Asian Champions League draw tomorrow. But Ernie is still playing the same tactics with or without Fred.\n\nTime to regroup for the Victory, plan for the ACL, but with the current tactics and confidence the fans won't be expecting too much from Australia's biggest club.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nFavourite moments of the Year?\n\nThought it was time to review the year. Australian football had the Asia Cup, the A-League 6-0 Grand Final, Matilda's World Cup and release of the Technical Report. New Players broke through, and the game kicked on to a new level.\n\nHere are my top ten football moments in descending order.\n\nComing in at:\n\n10. John Howard handing over $16 million to the FFA. Finally we can have the Technical Report released, a Coach for the Socceroos, A Women's A-League expected, A Youth League to come, and Christmas still to come:)\n\n9.Collette McCallum bends it like, you know who, to score against Canada in the World Cup.\n\n8. David Carney surprising us all by stepping up to Socceroo level, at left back. The A-League rose a notch with Carney's performances in Asia.\n\n7. Football on Channel Ten. Sydney beat Beckham 5-3. We purists weren't sure but 80,000 at a friendly, pumped on FTA Television. A highlight of sorts.\n\n6. Bruce Djite. Watching Bruce at work is absolutely joyous. coupled with the rise of the young players in the A-League. Robbie Kruse Michael Zullo Nathan Burns and Nikita Rukavystya to name a few. Great to see.\n\n5. Steve Corica's goal away to Shanghai Shenhua in the opening game of Sydney FC's Asian Champions League campaign. The first Australian goal in the ACL. That it was away from home in China was special. That it was a superb goal and a great goal for Australian football merely added to the sense of history.\n\n4. The Olyroos defeating Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and others to reach the Olympics. Well done to Graham Arnold, and Robert Baan. A great achievement, even in the crucial goal in the last game was the hand of Leijer!\n\n3. Lisa De Vanna scores that vital goal against Norway in the World Cup. A breath-taking piece of football, and at such a crucial part of the game.\n\n2. Archie Thompson leaving the field in the Grand Final after having scored 5 for Melbourne Victory in their 6-0 thrashing of Adelaide United. The crowd roared his name as he walked around the stadium with the game still in play. It was amazing to see in the Dome, in the city of AFL. Pinched myself!\n\n1. Cheryl Salisbury stroking the ball home in the last minutes of the crucial World Cup game against Canada. With the score at 2-1 Australia were out. History was made as Lisa De Vanna tricked her way into the box. Salisbury scored. The Matilda's went to the World Cup Quarter Finals for the first time ever.\n\nand joint first...Live on FTA The Matilda's brought the women's game into mainstream Australian sport for the first time. People didn't just talk football, they talked women's football.\n\nMissed any, I'm sure I have..feel free to tell me what I missed and add your favourite moment.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nWe're gonna win the league and now you're gonna believe us...\n\nWould you bet against them?\n\nA seriously depleted Adelaide United side were pushed aside by the cute signing of John Aloisi.\n\nThe Mariners beat Adelaide 2-1 at Hindmarsh tonight. They were strong, organised and not particularly pretty to watch.\n\nAustralia's best team may have one foot in Asia but their percentage play, direct and strong running don't get me out of my big comfy seat too often.\n\nAdelaide nearly always do. But without Nathan Burns, Ange Costanzo, Bobby Petta, Jason Spagnuola, Diego and Bruce Djite in the first eleven it was always going to be a tough ask.\n\nThings were so bad Aurelio Vidmar gave Kristian Sarkies a start. This after telling the world how bad he was!\n\nDid it motivate him? He played okay, but really was out thought and out played by the Mariners midfield.\n\nIf Sarkies was supposed to be the United creative force in the first half, Adelaide's lack of any meaningful attacks must be his concern.\n\nCassio attacked, but unfortunately from just outside his box. Andrew Clark robbed him and John Aloisi scored comfortably.\n\nWhen Sasho Petrovski scored early in the second half it looked like the game was over.\n\nBut Aloisi contrived to miss chances, each one easier than the last. But he made another telling contribution to the Mariners.\n\nHe's fast becoming the best ever returning Socceroo.\n\nAnd Vidmar reacted by bringing on Bruce Djite. In the last twenty minutes the quality of Adelaide's play lifted immediately. Paul Agostino beat the superb Danny Vukovic with a backward header from the penalty spot.\n\nGame on.\n\nTravis Dodd had two great chances to score.\n\nPim Verbeek would have been delighted to see Bruce Djite light up the night.\n\nAnd suddenly Adelaide were in the match. Surely the Mariners couldn't let it slip.\n\nAnd they held on but it was close, when in truth it could have been four or five to the Mariners before United scored.\n\nAdelaide were poor, very poor. Maybe Sarkies should be questioning his coaches tactics. They were dire. The team produced nothing for seventy minutes and then could have snatched a draw.\n\nThe Mariners will not meet many more ordinary sides than Adelaide this season.\n\nAn easy three points, but not a true test of the Mariners quality, given the players missing for United.\n\nBut a foot closer to Asia, and a win over Sydney next week and they'll be six points clear with four to play.\n\nTime to get the passports out for the Scottish Mariners?\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nFebruary 6th. The most important date in the sporting calender next year.The start of the Australian Asian World Cup campaign.\n\nAnd it's a FIFA date.\n\nBut no-one is coming from overseas or so we are told?\n\nWhy not?\n\nThe African guys who play for Chelseas are off for the African Cup for a few weeks in, yes you guesssed it, February.\n\nDiedier Drodgba, Michael Essien and co.\n\nBut the Aussies can't come for a FIFA date.\n\nWhat would it mean?\n\nMissing one game, so they left Europe on a Tuesday or Wednesday if they had no midweek game and were excused the weekend game. Yes excused by their employer to play for their country!\n\nLucas Neill crucial to West Ham, maybe. Tim Cahill crucial to Everton, probably. But is Mark Viduka, Harry Kewell, Brett Emerton, Mark Scharzwer, Josh Kennedy, Michael Beauchamp, Luke Wilkshire and many others so so important to their club that missing one game, just one game for a World Cup Qualifier, not possible.\n\nSurely Nurenburg, Blackburn and even Liverpool could release their Aussies for one game.\n\nAre we being softened up for the inevitable?\n\nSurely one or seven overseas stars could talk with their clubs and get released.\n\nTo say none are available.\n\nDream on. Are we even going to ask, or just rely on the A-League guys.\n\nI don't doubt the ability of the A-League guys but wouldn't mind adding a little bit of depth in a few places.\n\nTell me Pim Verbeek you will ask the question. You will won't you, because just maybe some of the Australians would like to come and play for their National team.\n\nAnd I'm happy to ring round the lads and the managers. Give me the numbers and I'll do it. For my Country!\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nSally Shipard takes to the field for Sydney FC this weekend. Sally updates us on the Inaugural Women’s A-league Challenge and her time in the Beckham Scrum.\n\nSally's post starts here:\n\nThe Inaugural Women’s A-league Challenge commenced 3 weeks ago\n\nIn sunny Newcastle. The Newcastle Jets team defeated Sydney FC 4-2. All players for both teams were notified one week in advance leading in to the opening game.\n\nOne week of preparation was not sufficient enough as most of the girls who had recently competed at the World Cup in China had been resting since their Quarter-final appearance against Brazil.\n\nHowever there were 6 goals, so there was some entertainment for the growing crowd, as spectators began to arrive for the Men’s A-League clash between Central Coast Mariners (CCM) and the Newcastle Jets.\n\nHopefully everyone enjoyed the game, after all the 3 game challenge is a trial to see how the Australian public react to a Female league.\n\nAfter spending a week in Newcastle preparing for the match with my adopted team the Newcastle Jets, I made my way down to Sydney just in time to watch a ‘David Beckham’ training session. I was to complete a few days of work experience with a few different companies before heading home to Canberra.\n\nIt was very exciting to be watching the Galaxy train, although I must admit my eyes were trans-fixed on the mighty Beckham. Which I believe was the case for every journo and photographer who were present.\n\nOn the night of the match, I was in the media box with the journo’s from the Newspapers who were to write their stories for the following days print.\n\nThe majority of them had dead-lines for 12pm that night. It was fascinating to see how it worked. A very male dominated industry was something in which I noticed. Hopefully I will be one of the many women to influence that change. I was able to attend the post-match press conference.\n\nI gained a great insight into the world of media that night and just how much of an impact one guy can have on a countries perspective of Football. Amazing!\n\nOur A-league challenge re-commenced in Brisbane on the weekend just gone, a curtain raiser to the much anticipated Men’s game between the CCM and the Brisbane Roar.\n\nThe way in which the teams are selected for the games are quite simple, whichever Matilda or Young Matilda is available to play they get on the team sheet. The teams are as even as possible in order for the games to be competitive.\n\nIt would have been nice if there were more goals scored, the final score was only 1-0 to the Newcastle Jets.\n\nThe crowd would have been more involved if that were the case.\n\nHopefully this weekend in Sydney the match will be entertaining. As the purpose of these games is to ‘showcase’ what we are capable of and to make a positive impact on the Australian public, we want to prove to the FFA and a potential sponsor that if a Womens A-league competition was established, it would be more than viable.\n\nStay tuned for updates in December\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nCongratulations To Capital Football's Heather Reid on her induction to the FFA's Hall of Fame.\n\nHeather has devoted her life to the game.

Replace your Captain with a Captain, only an older and slower one.\n\nAnd serves you right if Poppa is injured or sent-off between now and the Grand Final. Who are you going to call on then?\n\nThe A-League has built some personality. Kevin Muscat, Matt Mackay, Ange Costanzo are just three who spring to mind.\n\nAll have been here from the start, all play passionately for their clubs. Just what we, the fans, need.\n\nFor Sydney, Mark Rudan has been my stand-out.\n\nLeft out by Littbarski early on. Returned, dignified, to become the face of Sydney FC.\n\nWho can forget the goal he scored in the semi-final against Adelaide in season one.\n\nOr the run only last week in the final minute to win the game for Sydney. Or his performances in the Asian Champions League.\n\nClub Captain. A true blue. A Sydney boy.\n\nAnd then Sydney buy returning Socceroo, albeit belatedly, Tony Popovic. Who after struggling for weeks is starting to look okay.\n\nHe's a lot older than Rudan. And he's shown little commitment to the cause, before his contracts across the World ran out.\n\nNow he's Sydney through and through and Captain as well. At the expense of Rudan.\n\nAnd so Rudan, who's contract runs out this year is off, to Japan on a two year deal.\n\nWill Poppa still be playing in two years? How slow will he be? Is he so much better than Rudan? Not in the A-League, not yet, he isn't.\n\nLoyalty from fans for a new league. Loyalty from players. Loyalty from the clubs. Everyone wants and expects loyalty.\n\nEveryone except Sydney FC.\n\nRudan's contract presumably was an ordinary one given the salary cap, and probably not increased for the coming seasons.\n\nDo you think Poppa is on less than Rudan?\n\nRudan should have been offered a contract for two further years, increaing his current deal, and Poppa should never have been signed.\n\nWill Poppa play two more seasons? Unlikely, not without injuries and further enforced rests due to send-offs. Most of which will be due to his ageing legs.\n\nI have no problem with Poppa personally. Of course, merely Sydney FC.\n\nYou let Dwight Yorke go. Littbarski. And Topor-Stanley and now Rudan.\n\nBuilding loyalty takes awhile. Rudan was one who gave to the Sydney cause in bucket loads. It takes time.\n\nThe Roar away at the end of last season, Shanghai away, A-League Grand Final, were some of Rudan's great fighting performances.\n\nHis reward? Stripped of the Captaincy for Johnny Come Lately, and forced to go and play second division in Japan for two years.\n\nCome on Sydney, for the good of the game. Lift yours.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nQueensland Roar 2. Central Coast Mariners 1\n\nThe Roar are coming, in fact so are everyone else!\n\nThe Mariners were desperate for a win against their nearest challengers and took the lead through a John Aloisi tap in.\n\nThe Fox Sports commentators claimed Matt Simon passed it across goal, but we all knew it was a dreadful dreadful shot which Aloisi tucked home.\n\n1-0 to the Mariners and one foot in Asia.\n\nBut then it all went wrong.\n\nRobbie Kruse attacked Dean Heffernan who is being caught out defensively time and time again this season. Kruse fired the ball in and ageing Tony Vidmar lifted a tired leg and steered it home for an own goal.\n\nThen Kruse played the ball of the match to set Matt McKay free he and Danny Tiatto exchanged passes and Mackay scored with a deflected shot off Tony Vidmar.\n\nCraig Moore and John Aloisi had a great battle, and great games. Matt Simon worked his socks off and caused the Roar's defence a host of problems.\n\nGreg Owens hit the post, and had chance to level it at the death, but the Roar should have been out of sight.\n\nMassimo Murdocha and Matt Mackay are small in height but motor all over the park and set the Roar's tempo. Even on this humid night they never stopped.\n\nThe Mariners couldn't match them and were lucky to take the lead and luckier still to remain within a goal of the Roar all night.\n\nThanks to Danny Vukovic. He was outstanding saving time and time again from anyone who tried to hit the ball as hard and as straight as possible for the Roar.\n\nRobbie Kruse, for me, was the man of the match. A sheer joy to watch. Danny Tiatto played his role well.\n\nThe Mariners missed the creativity of John Hutchison or Tom Pondeljak but tried hard to earn a point.\n\nJustice prevailed. The better team won.\n\nA fiercely competitive game, a great crowd of 16,442, and the league minor premiership and that guaranteed place in Asia is wide open.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\n10,700 turned up in Sydney last night to watch a crucial A-League game between Sydney and Newcastle Jets. Everyone else had spent their money watching David Beckham last week.\n\nIt could have been worse..\n\nIn fact given Sydney had a belated 2 for 1 ticket offer after the Galaxy game, who knows how many would have turned up without it!\n\nThe weather, no trains, poor football, poor location, Sydney people are fickle, are just a few of the reasons given why crowds are so poor.\n\nWhatever the reason the crowd is concerning, very concerning at Sydney FC, given we are three years in, the game was a local derby, and of course 80,000 plus watch Sydney's Beckham friendly the other day.\n\nDid the entertainment game actually devalue the A-League in the eyes of supporters?\n\nEither way, worrying times in Sydney and for the rest of the football community.\n\nWhat is to be done?\n\nWhatever is to be done, it's going to be a slow slow build.\n\nWhat Sydney would give for a first season 25,000 crowd against Melbourne, Adelaide or the Central Coast!\n\nPerhaps the strong first season crowds saw Dwight Yorke shunted and a winning coach in Pierre Littbarski booted. And with that the new fragile supporter base was lost.\n\nImagine building a winning side, in your very first season, and removing the winners, the one man marketing machine in Yorke, and the winning coach Littbarski.\n\nLittbarski even thanked the crowd for their loyalty with a banner before the final game. Big deal? I think so.\n\nHow does a club build loyalty. Don't know, but Sydney seemed to lose it the minute they released these two.\n\nIt's a long, but not impossible, way back. The whole club, the manager, the players and the supporter base have to continue to do their bit, and someone somewhere has to find the key.\n\nIt's there, somewhere, Sydney just have to find it.\n\nWhat's the alternative? How much lower can Sydney go? Let's not go there...just yet!\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nSydney won 1-0 against Newcastle in Sydney last night, Steve Corica scoring in the last minute.\n\nMeanwhile the Wellington Phoenix thumped Perth Glory 3-0 in Wellington.\n\nSteve Corica scored late on, very late. In fact as they say in Newcastle after Griffith's winner last week against The Roar, Stevie did a Joel.\n\n90 plus 2. Great work from Mark Rudan and Terry Mcflynn. McFlynn must have been watching Juninho in training over the last few weeks.\n\nInside the box, most A-League players would have hammered it only to see it blocked by a defender.\n\nNot McFlynn.\n\nHe twisted and scooped when we demanded it to be hit. He placed it, oh so delicately, beyond Tarik Elrich, who turned only to see Steve Corica rising to head home.\n\nMarvellous, marvellous moment.\n\nThe Jets are a well structured side, who won't attack. Not early and never in real numbers. So they are hard to beat, and in Joel Griffiths and Mark Bridge they can cause trouble to any side.\n\nWhen the headless chook of the week Ruben Zadkovich got sent-of for lunging after the Ref had blown for an earlier foul, John Kosmina the Sydney coach could see his season roosted:)\n\nBut somehow Sydney remained strong.\n\nTheir defence being their strong point, remained unchallenged.\n\nA title winning defence? Maybe, just maybe.\n\nThe Jets, lacked Denni, and didn't really contribute to an attacking game. And Sydney well there play is good until the final third where it often breaks down.\n\nMichael Bridges should have scored twice, and he does produce some wonderful link play but Alex Brosque lacks the vision to link and return the ball quickly and effectively with Bridges.\n\nStill Sydney won, their season is alive, and who would bet against them now. Not me.\n\nThe Jets are in trouble. Rumblings over player transfers, Mario Jardel and ongoing garbage between the moneybags Chairman Con Constantine and Coach Gary Van Egmond mean this season could yet implode for the Jets. Who would be against that? Not me!\n\nWellington won 3-0 over a resurgent Glory! No Simon Colosimo, no Jamie Downey, no victory, no surprise.\n\nTwo sent-off for the Glory including Nikolai Topor-Stanley, means Dave Mitchell's messiah like rise over the last few weeks, is no surety to continue.\n\nWith Topor-Stanley and Jamie Harnwell off last night, it will be a weakened Glory that goes to work next week.\n\nFor the Phoenix a comforatable win in front of their home support, finally. And they are off the bottom. Good for them.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nThe Victory desperately need a win and a lift, The Phoenix to face the latest Aussie upstart, Sydney without Juninho but Joel's in town so the entertainment factor is guaranteed, and can the Roar sink the Mariners?\n\nSee the predictions below.\n\nTonight the games start with The Phoenix at home to a renewed Perth Glory.\n\nNikita Rukavtsya. All eyes will be on him. He is starting to set the league on fire.\n\nAustralian Institute of Sport Coach Steve O'Connor told me this week, \"it will be interesting to see how he goes when he fills out, he has a big frame.\"\n\nAnd goals, four now, a more central role under Dave Mitchell be afraid Wellington very afraid.\n\nPhoenix at home are always entertaining. Perth are missing key influence Simon Colisimo.\n\n1-1 this one.\n\nSydney FC v Newcastle Jets\n\n1-1.\n\nSydney still don't score. Steve Corica is older and hasn't produced much this year, and Juninho is injured. So where will the goals come from, the creativity for Alex Brosque?\n\nIt's all on the ageing Corica, so one maybe all Sydney can produce. The Jets are no MLS team. Cheaper no doubt but better.\n\nHope Steve Bigbutt is playing, and how come Super Mario gets criticised for his weight but no-one dares mention Mr Laybutt? How does a player who is playing football get so overweight?\n\nYou tell me?\n\nMelbourne Victory v Adelaide United.\n\nOh my god!Bruce Djite is back, just what Ernie Merrick didn't need. And Victory saviour Nicky Ward isn't available.\n\nThe guy can motor and this may be just what Victory need. But tonight it may all end in tears.\n\nAdelaide have sneaky Nathan Burns coming back into form. An away win with ten.\n\nVictory 0-2 Adelaide.\n\nQueensland Roar v The Central Coast Mariners\n\nMariners don't play well away from home. Have you noticed that?\n\nThe Roar are getting harder to beat at home, although the Jets sorted that last week. The Roar have lost Michael Zullo, Robbie Kruse looks tired and the busy busy Roar could be in trouble again tonight.\n\nWho will convert for the Roar?\n\nWe know who will for the Mariners. And that could be the difference.\n\nRoar 1 Mariners 2.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nIt is my belief that Australian football takes off come February 6th. We've never had the quality and amount competitive international games that we are going to have over the next two years and then beyond.\n\nThe game has an A-League, Asian Champions League, Women's League, Youth League and much much more in place or about to come.\n\nThe man appointed to the most important job in modern Australian sport is Pim Verbeek, a Dutchman.\n\nIt took a while, it might have been our second or even tenth choice who knows, but we have a Coach.\n\nPim is going to live in Australia or at least spend most of his time here. That to me is just as important perhaps than who he is or what he has done.\n\nIt sends a message to all future coaches.\n\nIt shows the respect he is giving the Australia job, also enables him to promote the game in this country, in a way that a long-term European Coach could never do.\n\nHe has been across Asia in various coaching position, and took South Korea to third place in the Asia Cup.\n\nAnd he was missing his best four Korean players, all European based, so perhaps third place was a good achievement.\n\nIt's not an exciting appointment. Won't really raise the profile of the game with non-football fans in Australia, but will long-term if he gets the team through 14 games of qualification and on to the World Cup.\n\nSo he ticks my boxes. A man with plenty of Asian football experience. Also heaps of European experience and he is a man on the rise, or will be if he succeeds with Australia.\n\nAnd he is a coach:) Finally.\n\nAnd well done to Ben Buckley, and the team, for getting someone in quickly after the Dick \"impoverished\" Advocaat debacle.\n\nSo Pim's our man. Good luck Pim.\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only...\n\nCanberra's Andrew Young is the Strength and Conditioning Coach at Fulham in the English Premier League. Which means he gets to sit on the bench at all the grounds in the EPL.\n\nOn Tuesday it was Old Trafford.\n\nRead Andrew's excellent update below on life in the Premiership with Fulham\n\nAs I write, we are between games having just returned from a 0-2 loss away at Old Trafford on Monday night and awaiting another tough game away to Tim Cahill's Everton this coming Saturday afternoon.\n\nCurrently sitting 14th on the table, it has been an interesting season for us here at Fulham FC. Whilst putting in some good performances at home, our nemesis has again been our away form.\n\nAlthough it should be noted that we played the big 4 in our first 7 games away from home, the highlight of which was nearly snatching a win at Stamford Bridge in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in October.\n\nTravelling up on plane up to Manchester at the weekend, I must admit that I was quite hopeful of getting something out of the game. Especially as I was sitting next to Danny Murphy (ex Liverpool & England international) who was a 3 times 1-0 winner away at Old Trafford. He politely reminded me that he scored the winning goal there on all 3 occasions!\n\nWarming the boys up in front of the 75,000 Old Trafford faithful was quite a surreal moment in the context of being a former Canberran playing in front of a 2000 people at Bruce Stadium in the old NSL!\n\nBut in the end, it was really just another game and there was not really any time to lose focus away from preparing the team properly. I have to say that United were superb with the likes of Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney and Giggs always a threat in one on one situations and so solid at the back with Vidic, Evra and co.\n\nIn the end, a Ronaldo brace either side of half time killed us off. On the way back to London after the game, I found out that it was my 100th Premier League game on the bench. Nice ....... but not quite the same as 3 points!\n\nThe hectic traditional Christmas program awaits us later this month when we have games against Wigan (22 December), Spurs (26th), Birmingham (28th) and the Chelsea home derby on New Years day.\n\nThis is a time when club's with smaller playing squads, like ourselves, are really tested to the limit by the big clubs in terms of the effect of injuries, suspensions and fatigue on our squad.\n\nAnd yes, we do have to train on Christmas day! Most of the Premier League clubs then enter the FA Cup 3rd round played in early January. We have drawn Bristol Rovers at home which will be a far from easy encounter as any Premier League scalp is highly prized by lower league clubs.\n\nOlyroo's boy, Adrian Leijer, has settled in really well at Fulham after his transfer from Melbourne Victory earlier in the year. He has obviously been doing a fair bit of travelling helping the Olyroo's to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, even scoring a goal he tells me!\n\nAlthough he has not made his Premier League debut yet, he was on the bench last month at Anfield and travelled with the squad to Old Trafford. He is a great lad and is highly thought of by the coaching staff and is learning his trade every day training alongside the likes of international centre back's Dejan Stefanovic and Carlos Bocanegra.\n\nLike me though, he is starting to miss the Aussie sunshine especially as it currently goes dark at about 3.30pm in the afternoon on training days!\n\nIn recent weeks, our Performance & Sports Science department have received benchmarking and research visits from several Australian professional sporting organisations such as the AIS and AFL clubs Carlton and the Western Bulldogs.\n\nIt was great to spend some time with coaches Rodney Eade and Brett Rattin and the exchange of ideas was very beneficial to both parties. It is great to know that they consider Fulham to be a leader in this field and I am really looking forward to making return visits when I get back to Australia at the end of the season.\n\nIn other news, I was fortunate enough to be involved in the Socceroo's camp and match against Nigeria in London last month. It was great to catch up with all the boys and hear those familiar Aussie accents.\n\nActing National Coach Rob Baan did a great job preparing the team at very short notice and despite missing several key players, we were very happy with the 1-0 win against the No 1 ranked team in Africa.\n\nIt was a thrill for me to take the team out onto Craven Cottage, my home ground at Fulham, although I must admit some of the groundsmen were a bit confused when they saw me!\n\nRob Baan proudly announced after the game that he was now the only undefeated National Team manager in 2 countries ...... apparently he also once caretaker managed Holland for one game and won that game as well!\n\nAnyway, that's my news from London for now. Wishing everyone back home a very happy and warm christmas!\n\nAndrew\n\nRead More...\n\nSummary only..."
