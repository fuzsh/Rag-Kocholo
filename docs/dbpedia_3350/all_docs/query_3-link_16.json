        "text": "HISTORY will repeat itself on Sunday's when Bonnyrigg White Eagles and Rockdale City Suns contest the New South Wales Premier League grand final.\n\n16 years ago, Branko Culina made his then teenage son Jason, the youngest player ever to appear in a grand final, when he came on as a substitute for Sydney United in their 2-0 loss to Brisbane Strikers in the 1997 NSL Grand Final.\n\nCulina junior was just 16 years, 293 days old. On Sunday, at just 33 years old, he'll become one of the youngest coaches to sit on the benches in a senior Grand Final - and again, it's all thanks (rather inadvertently) to his dad.\n\nCulina senior, who has led the Suns to their first-ever Grand Final on the back of penalty shootout wins in all three of its finals matches, will watch from the stands at Penrith Stadium, after being issued with a touchline ban following the win over Sydney United in last week's Preliminary Final.\n\nCulina senior had a verbal exchange with referee, Kris Griffiths-Jones, and although he will be able to prepare the team in the dressing rooms beforehand, he will not be allowed to sit on the benches - leaving his son to take the reigns during the 90 minutes.\n\nJason is only helping out in the assistants role due to regular incumbent, Ivan Petkovic, being overseas on holidays - meaning his first \"lead\" role as a senior coach will be in the pressure cooker of a Grand Final.\n\n\"It's unusual that it has happened like this - I've only been involved for three weeks. I'm just there to be a senior figurehead rather than a coach,\" says Culina junior, who credits the teams success to his father.\n\n\"Rockdale has never made it to the final before, and no-one really gave them a chance at the start of the year. My dad and his team have done a great job. I'd love to follow in his footsteps, and I'm learning from him at the moment.\"\n\nThe former Socceroo, who only recently retired from a long and illustrious playing career, will attempt to get his coaching badges before the end of the year - but is hoping his experience of big games as a player, and particularly of that grand final in 1997, will help the Suns.\n\n\"It was extra special - that year was when I started my career, and that was the game that put my name out there. I scored in the semi-final as well, the youngest-ever Australian I think to score in a finals game. If you can achieve in these games, it sets you apart. My advice will be to enjoy it, but to remember the rewards can be greater - the best players can get picked up by bigger clubs.\"\n\nMeantime, the inaugural NPL National Finals series will kick off on September 29th, with Sydney United taking on Canberra FC. The winners will face Olympic FC from Queensland, with South Hobart and a team from South Australia making up the quintet. The Grand Final is scheduled for the weekend of the 12th/13th October"
