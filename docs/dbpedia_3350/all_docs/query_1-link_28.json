        "text": "Jason Culina's contract at Sydney FC has been terminated following a training ground bust-up with coach Frank Farina.\n\nThe club and player have parted ways by mutual consent, and it is as yet unknown where the Socceroos midfielder will end up.\n\nA Sydney FC statement revealed that the player, his management and Sky Blues CEO Tony Pignata came to the arrangement on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"We would like to wish Jason the best of luck with the rest of his football career,\" said Pignata.\n\nCulina made eight appearances for the Sky Blues, scoring two goals, and thanked Sydney FC for the opportunity to continue his football career.\n\n\"I would like to thank Sydney FC for assisting me with my rehabilitation and my return to football,\" said Culina.\n\n\"I would like to thank the Board, management, coaching staff, players and especially physiotherapist Stan Ivancic.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding my departure are unfortunate but I feel fit and strong and I am determined to continue my playing career in the future.\"\n\nThe situation arose because Culina, 33 this year, refused to swap training shirts with youngster Peter Triantis during training on Friday.\n\nObservers at the training session, which was open to the media and the general public, said Culina reacted angrily to Farina’s request.\n\n\"It was clear from what was going on at training that Frank was trying out his starting line-up against the rest of the squad,\" said a Sydney FC source, who did not wish to be named.\n\n\"During a break, he asked Jason to swap training bibs with Peter Triantis and instead of doing so, Jason angrily threw off the bib, swore at his coach and stormed off the pitch.”\n\nThe incident has cast a shadow at a time when Farina has turned around the club's on-field fortunes, lifting them from the foot of the table and into the top six.\n\n\"Everyone has wanted to see him get back after his terrible injury, but from the team’s perspective, Frank needs to build a culture of confidence, professionalism and a winning mentality,\" said the source.\n\n\"Now (the players) have got a coach who is focussed, experienced and professional, and is prepared to be tough, they’ve got to back his decisions – just as the team has to.”\n\nFarina handed Culina his Socceroo debut in 2005 when he was still national coach."
