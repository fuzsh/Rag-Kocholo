        "text": "Socceroos Head Coach Guus Hiddink has named a full-strength squad for Australia's Powerade Series matches against the Solomon Islands in early September.\n\nSocceroos Head Coach Guus Hiddink has named a full-strength squad for Australia's Powerade Series matches against the Solomon Islands in early September. With a chance to progress to the next round of FIFA World Cup 2006 qualification at stake, Hiddink has taken no chances in selecting his strongest possible squad. \"We won-t be taking any chances with the all important first qualifying matches against the Solomon Islands,\" said Hiddink. \"So we have picked our strongest squad, and all the players are desperate to play, play well, and stake their claim for November and beyond.\" \"It is vital that we defeat the Solomon Islands because otherwise our world cup dreams will be over. If we stumble then there will be no November.\" Included in the 22-man squad are two Hyundai A-League players Sasho Petrovski (pictured above) from Sydney FC and Archie Thompson from Melbourne Victory who will face each other in the opening round of the competition this Sunday at Aussie Stadium. In addition to the squad, five players from Hyundai A-League clubs have been added as train-on squad additions but will be made available to their clubs for their round two matches. \"It is important that the players that are playing in Australia know they are in the running for selection so bringing in these players will give me an opportunity to assess them and also get them used to being in the national team environment,\" added Hiddink. The winner of the home-and away series will earn the right to face the fifth-placed South American nation in November for the final place at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. SBS TV will shown live coverage of the match from Aussie Stadium in Sydney.
