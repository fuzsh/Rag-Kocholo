Veteran Australia midfielder Jason Culina will leave Sydney FC after only eight appearances for the Sky Blues in Australia's A-League.

Sydney released a statement Monday saying the 32-year-old Culina, who came to prominence at PSV Eindhoven before making his international debut in 2005, was leaving the club by mutual consent.

After being sidelined for more than a year after a knee reconstruction, Culina joined Sydney late last year and he thanked the club for assisting with his rehabilitation.

There were no details of his next move. Culina, a regular starter in the last two World Cups, said in a statement: ''The circumstances surrounding my departure are unfortunate but I feel fit and strong and I am determined to continue my playing career.''
