Jason Culina has ended months of speculation about his future, signing a contract with Sydney FC.

Jason Culina has ended months of speculation about his future, signing a contract with Sydney FC.

The sometime Qantas Socceroo has been in training for more than a year as he fought to come return to football from what was at one point considered a career-ending knee reconstruction, and has been working with Sydney physiotherapist Stan Ivancic to get back to full strength.

Although short of match fitness, Culina remains one of the Hyundai A-league-s most talented midfielders and his signature significantly boosts Ian Crook-s options, and could be ready for first-team selection within the month.

Ironically, Sydney are set to face Newcastle Jets this weekend, the club that cut Culina adrift before the start of last season.
