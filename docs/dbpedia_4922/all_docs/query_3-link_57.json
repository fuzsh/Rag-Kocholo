        "text": "Former Mississippi first lady Pat Fordice, ex-wife of the state's first Republican governor in modern times and a tireless campaigner for several charity causes, died Thursday morning at her home in Madison after battling cancer. She was 72.\n\nThe cause of death was not announced.\n\nFamily spokeswoman Stacey Hight said arrangements are pending.\n\nHight said Fordice was surrounded by family at the time of her death at 1:30 am. She is survived by three sons, a daughter and 12 grandchildren.\n\nFordice's ex-husband, Kirk Fordice, served as governor from 1992 to 2000. The Fordices divorced in 2000 after 44 years of marriage. Kirk Fordice died of leukemia in 2004 at age 70.\n\nClose friends remember her as a woman with an adventurous spirit who loved life and her family.\n\nAnd, she's being described as someone who displayed dignity and grace even through difficult periods in her own life.\n\nA friend of Fordice for more than 20 years, Joanna Heidel, said that in these last months, Fordice was always optimistic. Fordice had announced in December that she had cancer. She had declined to be interviewed about her treatment and would not say what kind of cancer she had.\n\nFordice became a public figure after her then-husband Kirk, a brash, millionaire construction company owner, was elected in 1991.\n\nShe was instrumental in bringing two popular international art exhibitions to Mississippi. In 1996, \"Palaces of St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style\" featured tapestries, china, paintings and other glittering objects. Two years later, the \"Splendors of Versailles,\" featured French treasurers.\n\nAmong the reactions to her death:\n\n\"Pat Fordice was the most elegant and gracious first lady Mississippi has ever seen. When she was first lady, she used the resources of that office to promote the mission of Keep Mississippi Beautiful. She was always willing to do whatever she could to improve the lives of Mississippians who she loved so well.\" - Barbara Dorr, executive director of Keep Mississippi Beautiful.\n\n\"Pat Fordice was a model first lady. She represented our state with strength, dignity, and grace. As a respected ambassador for Mississippi, Pat became a symbol for making the state a better place. Her compassion and leadership served as an inspiration to those who knew her, and she will be missed.\" - Gov. Haley Barbour.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened to learn of my friend, Pat Fordice's, death. We shared a friendship that I will always treasure. She was a gracious lady with a great sense of humor and she was a tremendous ambassador for our state. Mrs. Fordice championed many worthy causes that have greatly impacted the lives of many people.\" - Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck.\n\n\"Pat Fordice served as Mississippi's first lady with grace and refinement. Her unwavering strength encouraged Mississippians to persevere during difficult circumstances. Regal yet approachable, she possessed a natural southern elegance that transcended her term and endeared her to our hearts.\" - U.S. Rep. Chip Pickering, R-Miss.\n\n\"Pat was the most gracious of ladies, the perfect hostess, Mississippi's star goodwill ambassador and truly one of the most admired and respected first ladies to ever grace the Governor's Mansion. Pat Fordice's passing leaves a large void in all that is good and representative of Mississippi.\" - State Auditor Phil Bryant.\n\n\"She was tremendously involved with many worthwhile endeavors while serving as first lady and continued to be active and involved after her tenure as first lady ended. She had a caring spirit for everyone. She will be missed. - Senate President Pro Tem Travis Little, R-Corinth.\n\n\"(She) was the epitome of grace and strength, the epitome of what's best about Mississippi.\"- state Sen. Charlie Ross, R-Brandon."
