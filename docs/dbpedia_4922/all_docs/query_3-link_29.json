On the Republican side, businessman Kirk Fordice and state Auditor Pete Johnson are forced into a runoff.\n\nMabus was hoping to become the first Miss. governor in the 20th century to serve consecutive four-year terms. But Fordice will go on to win the GOP runoff and beat Mabus in November, becoming the first Republican governor of the state since Reconstruction."
