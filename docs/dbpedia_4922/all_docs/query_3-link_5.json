        "text": "JACKSON, Miss., Sept. 7 - Kirk Fordice, a no-nonsense businessman who became Mississippi's first Republican governor since Reconstruction, died here on Tuesday at the age of 70.\n\nThe cause was leukemia, his family said.\n\nMr. Fordice was born in Memphis, was educated at Purdue University and became a millionaire through his Fordice Construction Company. He won the governorship by upsetting the Democratic incumbent, Ray Mabus, in the 1991 election and held the post until 2000.\n\nAs governor, he was successful in pushing for spending restraints, tougher sentencing laws and more prisons. But proposals for tax cuts, school choice and term limits stalled in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\n\nHis most raucous debates were over racial issues. Just a few days after his swearing-in, for instance, he threatened in a spur-of-the-moment remark to call out the National Guard if the state was ordered by the courts to spend more money on its three historically black colleges.\n\nMr. Fordice's private life also made headlines several times. In 1993, he disclosed that he was having \"irreconcilable differences\" with his wife of 40 years, Pat. Mrs. Fordice, in a terse press release, said she had no intention of getting a divorce.\n\nThe couple did divorce in 1999, however, and he married his high school sweetheart, Ann G. Creson, shortly after leaving office in 2000, barred by term limits from seeking a third term. They, too, later divorced.\n\nMr. Fordice is survived by a daughter, Angie Roselle, and three sons, Hunter, Dan and Dr. Jim Fordice."
