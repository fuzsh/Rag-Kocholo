        "text": "Angela Jordan enjoyed a comfortable and quiet life in Vicksburg, the\n\nsmall southern town in which she was reared. She was a\n\nthirty-five-year-old mother of three daughters, and a woman with a\n\npolitically liberal bent, when, against all history's odds,\n\nMississippians elected her conservative Republican father, Kirk Fordice,\n\ngovernor in 1991.\n\nSuddenly fate threw the whole Fordice\n\nfamily into the glaring lights of public life. They made headlines,\n\nenlivened the 6 o'clock television news, and provided fodder for every\n\ndinner table conversation and robust political speculation around the\n\nSoutheast. As the Governor and First Lady Fordices' longstanding\n\nmarriage dissolved slowly and publicly over two terms in office,\n\neveryone with a newspaper subscription or a cable connection watched the\n\ntrainwreck and high-profile betrayals."
