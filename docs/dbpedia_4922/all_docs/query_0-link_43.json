        "text": "Jackson, Miss.\n\nThe new report is 400 pages and 100,000 words —\n\none of the bulkiest in memory — and is touted as a reaffirmation of\n\nthe importance of the nation’s historically Black colleges and\n\nuniversities (HBCUs).\n\nFurther Desegregation of Higher Education in the Mississippi Delta\n\nproposes a plan that would move Mississippi further from its racially\n\nseparatist past and into a more diverse, racially inclusive future. It\n\nwas produced as a result of one of the longest-running college\n\ndesegregation cases in the nation — Ayers v. Fordice — by the Board\n\nof Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning.\n\nJames Lyons, the president of Jackson State University, one of\n\nMississippi’s eight HBCUs, called the study, which was released last\n\nmonth, a “good foundation on which to build…. What we’ve done here\n\ntoday is to reaffirm the importance of the nation’s historically\n\nAfrican American universities.”\n\nAyers v. Fordice is a twenty-three-year-old case in which the late\n\nJake Ayers Sr. filed a lawsuit — on behalf of his son and almost two\n\ndozen other Black Mississippi students — that sought to end the\n\nstate’s racially motivated dual system of education. In 1992, six years\n\nafter the elder Ayers’s death, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that\n\nMississippi’s dual system of education was unfair and something had to\n\nbe done about it.\n\nOne of the report’s proposals calls for putting more money into the\n\nstate’s HBCUs in an attempt to make them more attractive to students of\n\nall colors. In particular, the study recommends the establishment of a\n\ncollege of engineering at Jackson State, which will also offer doctoral\n\nprograms in business, social work, and urban and regional development.\n\n“Jackson [State] is one of the few capital cities or metropolitan\n\nregions of its size that fails to offer an engineering program to\n\ncitizens of the region,” the report states. “An engineering program is\n\ncritical to [the] enhancement of Jackson [State]’s ability to attract\n\nand retain business and industry.”\n\nThomas Layzell, Mississippi’s commissioner of higher education,\n\nsaid he likes the idea of a college of engineering, but noted that it\n\ncould cost as much as $9 million over a six- to ten-year period to get\n\nthe college going. That money would have to first be approved by the\n\nstate’s legislature, a historically tight-fisted group that responds\n\nsuspiciously to public spending.\n\n“We anticipate the legislature will be responsive to us,” Layzell said hopefully.\n\nBut Charles Young, the chairman of the Mississippi House of\n\nRepresentative’s Committee on Universities and Colleges, thinks that\n\nthe $9 million price tag may be a hard sell.\n\n“There are members [of the legislature] who are going to be more\n\nconcerned about spending that kind of money than anything else,” he\n\npredicts. “I, for one, am more concerned about making all of our\n\nschools competitive [and] to do what is in line with the Ayers\n\ndecision. But you have to address the financial concerns, too.”\n\nThe study also recommends enhancing a wide array of programs at two\n\nother HBCUs — Delta State and Mississippi Valley State universities. A\n\nstatewide system of satellite schools would be created for both\n\ninstitutions, and their annual building maintenance budgets would be\n\nconsolidated with the rest of Mississippi’s higher education system.\n\nLayzell was quick to note that pulling together the maintenance\n\nexpenses should not be considered a move to gain control over the\n\nstate’s higher education institutions.\n\n“The board concluded early on that it did not make good sense for\n\nthe board to have total control of funding,” he explained. “It’s not\n\npractical.”\n\nReaction to the study in the state’s higher education community appears to be positive.\n\nThat lack of criticism thus far, however, may have to do with the\n\nsize of the report. The study is composed of three separate reports,\n\nand it takes time to wade through the countless charts, graphs, and\n\ninevitably dense committee-style writing.\n\n“The board has worked very diligently to make sure these reports\n\nnot only dealt with the issues of the case, but reflected the board’s\n\ngoals and priorities,” said Rick Garrett, a member of the Mississippi\n\nCollege Board. “We feel they are reflective of what should be happening\n\nin higher education today.”\n\nHowever, there are those who see problems ahead.\n\n“We have some high-quality Black colleges and universities down\n\nthere,” said Thomas Colbert, a banker from Brandon, Mississippi who is\n\nserving a ten-year term on the College Board. “But the competition for\n\nstudents has become ferocious … so now a lot of people are concerned\n\nthat there is going to be an actual demise of the Black schools.\n\n“I see a huge problem,” he continued. “Do you want to get a degree\n\nfrom a 150-year-old institution, or one that is twenty or thirty years\n\nold? Do you want a degree from Ole Miss or some small state school?\n\nThat is the challenge we are facing now, and I don’t know what to do\n\nabout it.”\n\nAt press time, Republican Governor Kirk Fordice had not yet issued\n\na public statement on the proposals. And although Mississippi’s\n\nlegislature will not take up the issue of whether or not to approve\n\nfunding for Jackson State’s new college of engineering until the next\n\nregular session begins early next year, the board remains optimistic\n\nthat most of the report’s findings will eventually be implemented.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 1998 Cox, Matthews & Associates"
