        "text": "A Republican governor sues a Democratic attorney general to try to stop the law official's suit against tobacco companies.\n\n------*------\n\nGov. Kirk Fordice sued his attorney general on Friday to stop a lawsuit against tobacco companies over state-borne health costs, saying the lawyer overstepped his authority.Fordice said the lawsuit was about ``big bucks, big money and big publicity,' not recouping Medicaid funds spent by state taxpayers on indigents with smoking-related illnesses.\n\nAttorney General Mike Moore sued Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. and 12 other cigarette makers in 1994, seeking reimbursement for money the state spent treating the poor for smoking-related illnesses. He has accused the companies of lying and altering research.\n\nSimilar lawsuits against the tobacco industry have been filed in Minnesota, West Virginia and Mississippi.\n\nMoore's colleagues in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Florida have launched similar suits against the industry.\n\nFordice said he was asking the state Supreme Court to order Moore to drop the legal action. The governor said his advisers believe the state's highest court can act under a state law that allows the justices to halt any lawsuit.\n\nLater Friday, Moore responded: ``Our governor has chosen to take the side of an industry that has lied and killed 425,000 people a year in the past 30 years.\n\n``The tobacco companies were looking for a new Marlboro Man and they have found him ... and his name is Daniel Kirkwood Fordice.'\n\nMoore said the issue of his authority to file the lawsuit was settled Aug. 25, 1995, when Jackson County Chancellor William H. Myers ruled the attorney general is the state's legal officer and has sole right to initiate lawsuits on the state's behalf. The ruling has not been appealed.\n\nFordice, a conservative Republican, accepted tobacco industry money during his successful re-election bid in November. Moore, a Democrat who won a third term last fall, received campaign contributions from trial lawyers who have filed product liability lawsuits against tobacco companies.\n\nFordice, who has pressed for limits on damage lawsuits, said the issue was not whether cigarettes are harmful, but one of jurisdiction.\n\nHe said if Moore is attorney for the Medicaid Division and that division is part of the governor's office, then Fordice is Moore's client. The governor said he would have wanted more information before allowing Moore to proceed.\n\nMoore said the Medicaid division is not a party to the lawsuit. He said the lawsuit was filed on behalf of the state of Mississippi.\n\nFordice denied he was influenced by what he called a ``small fraction of 1 percent' of the donations raised for his $3 million 1995 campaign that came from the tobacco industry.\n\nCiting a story in Time magazine that pictured Moore and his chief witness, former B&W executive Jeffrey Wigand, Fordice said the issue is money, not care for the indigent.\n\n``When Mike Moore is in Time magazine, nothing else matters. We're off on another publicity binge like we've seen over the last several years he's been in office.'\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
