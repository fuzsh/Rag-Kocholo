        "text": "In the episodic matter of love, liaisons and Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi . . .\n\nA few weeks ago, it may be recalled, Pat Fordice, the Governor's wife, lamented that her husband of 44 years had bought a $230,000 home outside Jackson, the capital, and, alas, had never invited her to see it.\n\nShe said she knew the new place, where Mr. Fordice was spending weekends, ''wasn't for me,'' as she put it. Still, she rejected all talk of divorce and said that while the Governor had once said there were ''irreconcilable differences'' in their marriage, she intended to continue sharing the official Jackson mansion with him unless he forced her out.\n\nNeither official nor unofficial Jackson was greatly surprised by Mrs. Fordice's hang-tough approach. She had hung equally tough three years earlier when, upon her return from a trip to France, she found that in her absence the Governor had crashed his state-owned car while returning from an afternoon of eating and drinking in a Memphis restaurant with a woman who was not Pat Fordice. Or such was the description of the afternoon given by a waitress.\n\nThe Governor, battered and bandaged, said he could not remember why he was in Memphis that day.\n\nNow the Governor is newly back from another trip, again with a woman who was not Pat Fordice. Or such is the tale being told by news organizations in Memphis and Jackson.\n\nA Jackson television station, WLBT, identified the woman on Tuesday as Ann G. Creson, a Memphis widow who years ago was one of Mr. Fordice's junior high sweethearts. It reported that she and the Governor vacationed together last week in France and were seen kissing on the flight home.\n\nThe report infuriated the Governor, a Republican who was highly critical of President Clinton's conduct during l'affaire Lewinsky and who is now helping direct the Presidential campaign of former Vice President Dan Quayle, whose main issue is family values.\n\nWhen a WLBT-TV reporter confronted Mr. Fordice on Tuesday upon his return from abroad, the Governor, whose term ends in half a year, declared: ''Let me tell you something. You invade my privacy this way, six months from now I'll whip your----. You have no damn business playing these games.''\n\nThen, on Thursday, the Governor's lawyer, Jim Becker, announced that the game, or whatever it is, was over. The Fordices, he said, plan to divorce, and it will be done ''equitably and with dignity.'' After the divorce, Mr. Becker added, the Governor plans to marry Mrs. Creson.\n\nMrs. Fordice plans to hang tough, said her lawyer, L. C. James. ''Right now,'' Mr. James said, ''she is not inclined to see a divorce take place any time in the near future.''"
