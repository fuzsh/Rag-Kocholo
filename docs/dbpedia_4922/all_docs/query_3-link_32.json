        "text": "When Kirk Fordice was driving home his campaign theme of passionate opposition to quotas and government affirmative-action programs in general, he was not just engaging in idle sloganeering.\n\nNor was the new Governor-elect of Mississippi running a copycat campaign, despite what some opponents said about his injecting race into the election and echoing the approach of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi who is running for governor in neighboring Louisiana.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Fordice was the driving force behind a 10-year legal challenge to an Army Corps of Engineers program to set aside some contracts for minority and small businesses, and he was the leader of the industry group that backed a Supreme Court case that ended up outlawing most such minority set-aside programs.\n\nMississippi's first Republican governor in 115 years, is, friends and family members say, a man of \"strong opinions and an outspoken manner.\" The 57-year-old owner of a Vicksburg construction company is a conservative who is no stranger to the White House. He brings to the Governor's mansion a background of nearly 30 years of trying to build the Republican Party in the overwhelmingly Democratic state. In that process his role was mostly as a financial backer, and the only other elected post he has held was country election commissioner.\n\nBut his determination in pressing the case involving the Corps of Engineers speaks volumes about who he is and, some say, how he is likely to govern in the state with its strong Democratic Party and powerful Legislature. Case Was 'Very Personal'\n\nThat case, Fordice v. Marsh, ended with a little-publicized ruling by a Federal judge in July 1990 that the administration of a set-aside program for work on the Mississippi River had been characterized by abuse. It was a victory for Mr. Fordice, one that the Justice Department decided not to appeal.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
