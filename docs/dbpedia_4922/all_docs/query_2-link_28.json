        "text": "An apparent casualty of voters' antipathy toward incumbents, Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi lost yesterday to a political newcomer, Kirk Fordice, a conservative Republican who stressed his opposition to racial quotas. Mr. Fordice will be the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction.\n\nMr. Mabus, a Democrat, was attempting to become the state's first governor to win back-to-back terms. The state dropped a prohibition against successive terms four years ago.\n\nIn a bitterly fought campaign, Mr. Fordice, a 57-year-old construction company president from Vicksburg, called the incumbent a liberal in the Kennedy tradition and charged that he had bloated the state's payroll while neglecting its economy. It was Mr. Fordice's first bid for public office.\n\nAt the last minute, Shawn O'Hara, an independent, threw his support to Mr. Fordice, but Mr. O'Hara's name remained on the ballot."
