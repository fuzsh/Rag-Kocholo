        "text": "Qazi Mir Imdad Ali (1224AH/1809AD – 1295AH/1878AD) was Military officer during Bhonsle Dynasty in 1835 at Nagpur.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMir Imdad Ali was an inherited Qazi by profession from Sakras, District Gurgaon (Haryana). He was merely 5 years when his father Syed Mohammad Ashraf was assassinated (Shaheed) in 1814 by Meo Community at Sakras. It was a time when Mughals were becoming weak and there was almost anarchy and lawlessness all over the state. The government was weakened by successive wars, agrarian crises fueling local revolts, the growth of religious intolerance and British colonialism. Soon after the demise of his father, he migrated from Sakras, where his family lived nearly 500 years, to Tijara.\n\nHis elder brother Haji Mohammad Zainuddin, arranged higher education for him. He learned Arabic and Persian languages apart from general philosophy and knowledge. From many parts of the country, students came to learn various subjects from him. After the revolt of 1857, his interest was only reading and teaching. Maulana Syed Mukarram Hussain (died 1887), the first Mujtahid of Jalali (Aligarh) was also his student in earlier days[1]\n\nBeing courageous in nature and a good horse rider, he was appointed Military officer in 1835 during the Bhonsle Dynasty at the princely state of Nagpur. At that time, Maharaja Senasaheb Subha Chhatrapati Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III was the ruler of the princely state of Nagpur (1818–1853). After the death of Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III on 11 December 1853, the state lapsed and the Nagpur Province became the part of the Central Provinces and Berar and came under the administration of a commissioner under the British central government, with Nagpur as its capital.[2][3][4] In Nagpur, his relative had a Risala (mounted troop) of 100 horse riders with Naqqara and Nishān (insignia). He with other family relatives came back from Nagpur in 1262 AH / 1845 AD. He also served 15th Battalion of Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army at Jalandhar. In this 15th Battalion, his relative Qazi Rahimuddin was Risaldar. Because of literary and courageous nature of Qazi Imdad Ali, Regimental Sergeant Major Sham Fiar respected him too much. He needed a person who could help him in Persian and Urdu. Later on in his life, he started his business of horse trading from Tijara.\n\nBeing an ardent lover of literature, he also maintained a good library of his own books at his residence. He even transcribed a poetic book 'Aakhir Gat' of Hazrat Mohammad Ramzan Shaheed Mohmi (Shahadat 1824) in Urdu. A copy of this book transcribed by him with his signature on 10 February 1849 is available in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences.\n\nHe died on Sunday 22 September 1878 (25th Ramzan 1295AH) at the age of 70 years and was buried at Pana near Bagh MirInji, Tijara, Alwar. At the same family graveyard, his wife Fayyazun Nisan, his son-in-law Mohammad Yusuf and his daughter's son Mohammad Yamin are also buried. Following is a eulogy, narrated by a Persian poet on Qazi Mir Imdad Ali’s death:\n\n“ قاضی ساکرس، آن سید امداد علی\n\nحیف ازعا لم بی مہربہ ناگا ہ رفت\n\nصالحی بود کزین کارگہ شر وفساد\n\nرخت بربست وسوی منزل دلخوا ہ برفت\n\nنالہ ای کرد ز اندوہ وفغانی بکشید\n\nہر کہ بشنید آن سید ذ یجا ہ برفت\n\nبہر تاریخ وفاتش بہ زبان قلمم\n\nپی بہ پی سیصد وھم سیزد ہ بارآ ہ برفت\n\n”\n\nFamily[]\n\nHis family members were of the famous nobility from the region of Mewat, many members had a long tradition of scholarship and military history. After the loss of Syed Mohammad Ashraf, the family of Mir Imdad Ali was shifted to Tijara, where other family relatives were living. The people from ‘Saiyed family’ were very few in the region of Mewat. They were distinct in places like Khairthal, Bahadur Pur and Tijara. According to Major P.W. Powlett (late settlement officer of Ulwar), Mandha (now in Sikar district), was the only Saiyed village in the Tehsil of Tijara. The people are connected with the Khairthal Saiyed, and have been established at Mandha for four or five hundred years. There is a half-built fort in the village, begun by Nawab Faizullah Khan Khanzada of Shahabad, Alwar, who was in power for a time some eighty years ago. He was offended with the Saiyads for refusing a matrimonial alliance with him, and to build his fort he destroyed twenty-two of their masonry houses (Havelis)[5]\n\nQazi Mir Imdad Ali had many family relatives in several places of nearby states of Haryana and Rajasthan such as Khairthal, Rewari, Jhajhar, Ferozepur Jhirka, Bahadur Pur and Tijara.
