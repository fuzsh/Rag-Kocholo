        "text": "This is a study of Pakistani names of persons as they are related to identity and power in Pakistan. The identities to which names may be indexed are religious, sectarian, ethnic, class and modern versus traditional or rural versus urban. Names may be related to one's share in power in the society and may even jeopardise one's existence. Hence, names may be traps from which people escape by using other names which occupy more powerful niches in society.\n\nNames are connected with several societal variables such as identity, power and the belief-system. This study examines the association of the personal names of Pakistani Muslims with perceptions of their religious (including sectarian) identities. Large data bases of names of Muslims in order to find the frequencies of Islamic components in their names will be examined so as to provide an index of religiosity and its type (Sh┘'ah/Sunni/fundamentalist/radical etc). It is suggested that the occurrence of names like Osama [Us┐mah], Saddam [╗add┐m] or Arabic components like—umm (mother of),—ibn (son of) suggests radicalisation. Derivatives from Arabic, whether considered Islamic or not, will also be examined. This analysis along the chronological dimension will suggest whether Pakistani names have become more Islamised from the early years of Pakistan (1947–57) in comparison with the post-Zia ul Haq period (1980–90s). Names may be changed with a view to flagging the desire to take up a new religious identity. Thus the Islamisation and Arabisation of personal names in Pakistan may be an indicator of identity and change in identity construction. \n\nThis article discusses beliefs about personal names and naming practices in Pakistan. it also touches very briefly upon nicknames and how they are used in the society. The focus of the article is how names are connected with several societal variables such as identity, power and belief-system. They are related to rural and urban perceptions of identity, ethnic identities, level of religiosity and its type and social class. Names may be changed with a view to concealing a problematic identity or to integrate with a desiderated group identity. Moreover, changing trends in naming may indicate changes in belief-systems such as increasing Islamization, Arabization or Westernization. In short, names are important indicators of identity and changes in identity construction.\n\nBased on an analysis of a corpus, in this study we examine: (a) the linguistic structure of Muslim personal names, (b) their etymological sources, and (c) some changing patterns among the younger generation. Firstly, we present a typology of the naming patterns by showing that there are four major typesone-part, two-part, three-part, and four-part names. While one-part names are formed from the given name only, the other three types are complex as they are composed of additional names containing honorific titles, caste titles, patronym, and husband's names in case of married women. Secondly, by examining the linguistic sources of one-part and two part names, we show that Muslim names are primarily derived from Arabic and Persian. Our study further shows that while Indian Muslim names trace their origins to Arabic, the structure of their names differs significantly from Arabs and other Muslims especially those in southern India. Finally, we demonstrate a shift in the naming pattern among the younger generation in that some names and honorific titles are declining. We conclude our paper with some possible social factors that may contribute to the shift.\n\nThis paper focuses on situations in which certain Pakistani names become potentially dangerous, embarrassing or impediments to their bearer’s wellbeing. Since the country is predominantly Muslim and has moved towards increased religiosity, sectarian differences, marked to a great extent by components of names, have become increasingly dangerous for their bearers. Increasing intolerance towards Christians and other religious minorities have pushed them towards using names shared with Muslims (called ‘neutral names’). In other cases names are changed, modified or alternative names are assumed in order to appropriate desiderated identities: the modern one; the urban one; the integrated immigrant in Western countries and so on. In short, this is a study of the situations in which names are seen as a danger or a liability and the onomastic destigmatization strategies used by Pakistanis to deal with such situations.\n\nTh is article comprises a twofold attempt: the first is to establish a semantic fi eld that revolves around the concept of siyāsat—roughly equivalent to the political—in Muslim South Asia; the second is to trace semantic shift s in this fi eld and to identify circumstances that may have prompted those shift s. It is argued here that the terms that constitute the semantic fi eld of the political oscillate between two sociolinguistic traditions: a strongly Islamicate Arabic one, and a more imperially oriented Persian one. Another linguistic shift is indicated with the replacement of Persian by Urdu as the dominant literary idiom in and beyond North India since the eighteenth century. Th e aim is to serve only as a starting point for a more intensive discussion that brings in other materials and perspectives, thus helping to elucidate the tension between normative aspirations by ruling elites and actual political praxes by variant socioeconomic groups."
