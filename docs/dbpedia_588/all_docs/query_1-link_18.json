        "text": "Haji Mir Mohammad Zainuddin (d. 1850 AD) was Faujdar during Bhonsle Dynasty at Nagpur.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nHaji Mohammad Zainuddin during the reign of Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III, migrated to Nagpur from Tijara in 1818 as a noble man. At that time, Nagpur was the princely state. In Nagpur, his relative had a Risala (mounted troop) of 100 horse riders with Naqqara and Nishān (Insignia).[1]\n\n'Syed Abdul Ali Adil Nagpuri' narrated a Qat'a (a form of poetry) on his appointment as Faujdar in 1266AH/1849AD in the court of Nagpur state.[2]\n\n“ محب کرم گستر حا ل من\n\nترا خد مت نو مبا رک بود\n\nشود سبز گلزار اقبا ل تو\n\nز آ ب عنا یا ت رب صمد\n\nبود عمر توجاودان مثل خضر\n\nز الطا ف عا م خد ا ئ احد\n\nتو آں کارکن از سر بخردی\n\nکہکرد ند راضی ہمہ نیک وبد\n\nپے سال این جشن فرحت فرز\n\nنمودم بفکر رسا جد و کد\n\nدلم گفت بی ریب سا ل مراد\n\nترا فوجداری مبا رک شود\n\n”\n\nFamily history[edit]\n\nHe was present in Tijara and hence remained alive when his father Syed Mohammad Ashraf was assassinated (Shaheed) in 1814 by Meo Community at Sakras. It was a time when Mughals were becoming weak and there was almost anarchy and lawlessness all over the state. The government was weakened by successive wars, agrarian crises fueling local revolts, the growth of religious intolerance and British colonialism. His family lived nearly 500 years in Sakras (now a town in Ferozepur Jhirka) before the demise of his father. His other family members were of the famous nobility from the region of Mewat, many members had a long tradition of scholarship and military history. After the loss of Syed Mohammad Ashraf, the family of Haji Mohammad Zainuddin was shifted to Tijara, where other family relatives were living.\n\nQazi Mir Imdad Ali was his brother, who was also Military officer during the Bhonsle Dynasty. Mufti Yaqinuddin son of Mufti Imamuddin, and the brother-in-law of Mohammad Zainuddin (actually son-in-law of his uncle Syed Mohammad Shamsuddin) was a renowned scholar and Mufti of Rewari. Being Mufti of the city, he issued Fatwa against the British forces and to support the forces of Rao Tula Ram of Rewari. In consequent to his Fatwa, Muslims of Rewari and nearby villages fought against British invasion and supported with heart and soul the small force of Rao Tula Ram. Many got martyrdom in the fight so called the 'Fight at Narnaul'. After the defeat of Rao Tula Ram on 16 November 1857, Mufti Yaqinuddin and his brother-in-law Abdur Rahman (alias Nabi Baksh) were hanged after brought from Tijara to Delhi. His brother Mufti Nizamuddin was arrested from Rewari and was also hanged in Delhi.\n\nHaji Mohammad Zainuddin was married to Zarifun Nisan (daughter of Fakhruddin ibn Moizuddin) but had no issues. Zainuddin’s father in law Fakhruddin and maternal grandfather Amiruddin were real brothers.\n\nThe son of Fakhruddin, Ghulam Mustafa was employed with a good post at Nagpur. He built a beautiful Haveli at Tijara and went for Hajj in 1264 AH / 1847 AD. After Hajj, he remained in Tijara and died on 18 Moharram 1284 AH / 1867 AD. He had two sons Abdul Majeed and Bayazuddin and one daughter Jamila Begum.\n\nAbdul Majeed's son Abdul Latif (b. 27 Rabi' al-awwal 1271 AH / 1884 AD) was Hafiz Quran and married to Zakirun Nisan (daughter of Abdul Mughni) on 9 Rabi' al-thani 1287 AH / 1870 AD. Abdul Latif had one daughter Sughra and three sons Abdur Rasheed, Mohammad Siddiq and Manzoor Ahmad.\n\nBayazuddin had two sons Mohammad Ismail (married to cousin Sughra daughter of Hafiz Abdul Latif) and Mohammad Shafi (married to the daughter of Kamdar Abdul Matin 'Matin'). The son of Mohammad Shafi, Mohammad Shakil was married to Hasina Begum (sister of Kotwal Wasimuddin and daughter of Hafiz Naseemuddin ibn Qazi Fayyazuddin).\n\nJamila Begum was married to Qazi Hafiz Nasimuddin ibn Qazi Mohammad Fayyazuddin.\n\nHajj[edit]\n\nIn 1832 AD/1248 AH from Nagpur, he went for Hajj along with Qazi Najibuddin (son of Qazi Mohammad Ata) and Arabuddin (son of Qazi-e Ferozepur Jhirka). From Bombay, they took a ship. Before, the departure of the ship, Qazi Najibuddin became ill and died on 13 Shawwal 1248 AH. He was buried at Masjid Maulvi Mohammad Anas. Mohammad Zainuddin and Arabuddin finally went together for Hajj. In the same ship, Maulvi Abu Saeed and Mirza Meena Beg (Risaldar of Tijara) was also present. With reference to Maulvi Mohammad Anas, it seems that the family was quite close to the movement of Hazrat Syed Ahmad Shaheed.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nQazi Syed Rafi Mohammad\n\nQazi Syed Inayatullah\n\nQazi Syed Hayatullah\n\nQazi Syed Mohammad Zaman\n\nQazi Syed Mohammad Rafi (grandfather)\n\nSyed Mohammad Ashraf (father)\n\nGardēzī Sadaat\n\nGhulam Mansoor\n\nQazi Hameeduddin\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nQazi Najibuddin son of Qazi Mohammad Ata was a man of eminence, rich in society and as a leader, he helped many relatives to get important positions at Nagpur.
