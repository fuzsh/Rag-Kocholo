It was a terrifying “final solution” that violated the Geneva Conventions. The Phoenix Program’s civilian targets of assassination were VC\n\ntax collectors, supply officers, political cadre, local military officials, and suspected\n\nsympathizers. Faulty intelligence often led to the murder of innocent civilians, rival\n\nVietnamese would report their enemies as “VC” in order for US troops to kill them. In\n\n1971, William Colby, head of CIA in Vietnam, testified the number killed was 20,857.\n\nSouth Vietnamese government figures were 40,994 dead. CIA officer Ted Shackley\n\nmanaged (600 military and (40-50) CIA liaison officers) who were working with South Vietnamese officers in 44 provinces. Ted Shackley and Robert Komer played key roles in recruiting Phoenix Program personnel. Many Covert Action officers were Cuban\n\nrefugees from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. They ran the CIA’s Counter-Terror (CT) Teams, which were in fact assassination squads. Colby, Komer, and Shackley reported to DCI Richard Helms and the White House. From the beginning the Phoenix Program was\n\nconceived by the White House and supported by the CIA. Phoenix called for “neutralizing” 1800 targets a month. About one third of VC targeted for arrest were summarily executed. Green Berets and Navy SEALs would assassinate suspected VC sympathizers or cadres, as well as South Vietnamese collaborators and double agents. In 1982 an Ex-Phoenix operative revealed that sometimes orders were given to kill U.S.\n\nmilitary personnel who were considered security risks. He suspects the orders came not from “division”, but from a higher authority such as the CIA or the Office of Naval Intelligence.\n\nThe following is testimony of Vincent Okamoto, combat officer (Lieutenant) in Vietnam in 1968, and recipient of Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award conferred by the US Army. Wounded 3 times. “The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist? It’s not like you had their address and telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say, ‘Where’s Nguyen so-and-so?’ Half the time the people were so afraid they would say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take the informant, put a sandbag over his head, poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire around his neck like a long leash, and walk him through the village and say, ‘When we go by Nguyen’s house scratch your head.’\n\nThen that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say, ‘April Fool, motherfucker.’ Whoever answered the door would get wasted. As far as they were\n\nconcerned whoever answered was a Communist, including family members. Sometimes they’d come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people”.\n\nPenetrations into the Viet Cong Infrastructure was accomplished by blackmailing or\n\nterrorizing a member of a targeted individual’s family to gathering information. Every Vietnamese 15 and over had to register and carry identity cards, these records were\n\ncomputerized and eventually it evolved into a highly computerized and statistical means of generating 1800 names a month for the target list, coordinating the information on suspects from 30,000 plus informants. When the strategic Hamlet program failed, CIA and military intelligence concentrated on the Phoenix Program, a terror campaign aimed at the civilian population. Instead of winning hearts and minds, using the threat of assassination and a state of terror to defeat the NV. Many non-political Vietnamese were arrested and tortured and in effect forced into the resistance army. Phoenix Program architect Robert Komer, after leaving the Pentagon said, “I would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved”.\n\nHe called the war “a strategic disaster which cost us 57,000 lives and a half trillion dollars”.\n\nPhoenix USA: The Vietnam War was the formative experience for a generation of CIA\n\nand military intelligence personnel involved in the Phoenix Program. They viewed the military defeat in Vietnam as a betrayal on the home front, a loss of will by domestic\n\npolitical enemies, not a military failure against a nationalist revolution fought as a guerilla war. The Phoenix Program, assassinating suspected VC sympathizers in a\n\nsystematic manner, worked well and is the blueprint for the current black op targeting thousands of loyal Americans using state of the art microwave (MW) and radio frequency\n\nradiation (RFR) weapons. The motivation to suppress domestic dissidents and to assassinate loyal American opposition stems from the perception of dissent against the war as treason. This philosophy is stated very clearly in the MindWar paper written by NSA General Aquino. The DOD has a huge stake in futuristic technology that kills by ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, leaving little or no trace. The indiscriminant killing of the Phoenix Program continues on American soil. The terms soft kill, slow kill and silent kill refer to the new way of killing the enemy in conflicts short of war and the small wars of the future.\n\nThe counterinsurgency doctrine has now been applied to the home front, so that the perceived betrayal of the military in Vietnam will not be repeated. The generation of CIA and military intelligence led by Shackley, Helms, Casey, Abrams, Singlaub, Secord, John B. Alexander, Michael Aquino, Paul Vallely, and others have built the perfect beast, using selective assassination that leaves no trace. The ability to cull the human herd with Silent Kill technology allows a few personalities to remake the entire society in their own image. Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) technology kills with ionizing and non-ionizing radiation or slowly drives the target crazy with silent sound, similar to CIA MKULTRA psychiatrist Ewen Camerons psychic driving technique used to break down the targets personality. The new buzzwords at the Pentagon are silent kill, synthetic telepathy and psychotronics. Another means of attack on targets is the Smirnov patent that uses subliminal suggestion to manipulate human behavior. This patent was purchased by the remote viewing company Psi Tech Corporation. Military intelligence officers involved in developing these “non-lethal weapons” include Col. John B. Alexander, NSA General Michael Aquino, Harold Puthoff, and others, also control Psi Tech. Emotional manipulation is accomplished using Dr. Michael Persinger’s work to remotely project emotional states that the brain entrains or locks onto and emulates. One can broadcast rage or fear at an individual target to manipulate and control them. As if these methods were not enough to torture and murder people, add to this nightmarish toolbox, active gang stalking. CIA created cults and other cause-oriented groups are used to induce further trauma in the target by actively harassing them in public in a neutralization technique described in counterintelligence operations manuals that are aimed at enemy agents. In the race to develop a new weapon system it has always been necessary to test it on human beings. Perfecting the latest weapons designed to kill slowly and silently as well as perfecting the process of controlling the human mind are no\n\ndifferent. Once the weaponry has been perfected on these few thousand people the same techniques will be applied en mass to the general population, and then to humanity as a whole.\n\nCol. John B. Alexander stated in an interview with the Washington Post in 2007, …The military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of MK-ULTRA, the infamous CIA program that involved, in part, slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims. “Until recently, anything that smacked of [mind control] was extremely dangerous” because Congress would simply take the money away, he said. Alexander acknowledged that “there were some abuses that took place,” but added that, on the whole, “I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water”. But September 11, 2001, changed the mood in Washington, and some in the national security community are again expressing interest in mind control, particularly a younger generation of officials who weren’t around for MK-ULTRA. “It’s interesting, that it’s coming back,” Alexander observed. While Alexander scoffs at the notion that he is somehow part of an elaborate plot to control people’s minds, he acknowledges support for learning how to tap into a potential enemy’s brain. He gives as an example the possible use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, for lie detection. “Brain mapping” with fMRI theoretically could allow interrogators to know when someone is lying by watching for activity in particular parts of the brain. For interrogating terrorists, fMRI could come in handy.\n\nAlexander also is intrigued by the possibility of using electronic means to modify behavior. The dilemma of the war on terrorism, he notes, is that it never ends. So what do you do with enemies, such as those at Guantanamo: keep them there forever? That’s impractical. Behavior modification could be an alternative, he says. “Maybe I can fix\n\nyou, or electronically neuter you, so it’s safe to release you into society, so you won’t\n\ncome back and kill me,” Alexander says.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before technology\n\nallows that scenario to come true, he continues. “We’re now getting to where we can do that”. “Where does that fall in the ethics spectrum? That’s a really tough question”.\n\nHISTORY OF US GOVT HUMAN\n\nEXPERIMENTATION:\n\nIn order to understand the current state sponsored human experimentation, it is\n\nnecessary to begin with previous programs that began in the early 1900’s, and continued to the present day.\n\nEUGENICS MOVEMENT\n\nEugenics originated in England with the work of Francis Galton who studied hereditary\n\ntraits in families and began the nature versus nurture debate and its ultimate focus on\n\ntwins to answer the question of what was more powerful heredity or environment. He\n\nproposed positive Eugenics, encouraging the reproduction of eminent men and families.\n\nHe cautioned against drawing premature and harmful conclusions from his work, but like\n\nhis cousin, Charles Darwin, his work was used as justification for some of the greatest\n\ncrimes in history. Negative Eugenics is the application of means to discourage the\n\nbreeding of the―unfit‖, including anti-race mixing marriage laws, segregation\n\n(institutionalization), sterilization, and euthanasia. Eugenics is not a true science and\n\nthough it is dressed up in mathematics to give it legitimacy it has more in common with\n\nthe quack science of Phrenology. Phrenology was the study of the head size and shape to\n\ndetermine intelligence and character.\n\nThe industrial age had thrown millions of people off the farm and into the city to work in low paying factory jobs. The sheer scale of the problems of mental illness, alcoholism\n\nand crime seemed overwhelming. Added to this, millions of Eastern Europeans and Italians came to America and made native the population uneasy. They were viewed as “bad” stock compared to the more―Nordic types that made up earlier waves of immigration from Western Europe. Suggestions for solving these problems took the form of segregation, sterilization, and mass euthanasia, however the Eugenics movement leaders were smart enough to realize that America was not prepared for euthanasia. The Eugenics movement took shape in America with the founding of the Eugenics Recording Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1910 by Charles Davenport with money from the Carnegie Institution. The ERO compiled millions of files on ordinary Americans.\n\nThe adherents of Eugenics included some of the most influential doctors and scientists of\n\nthe era, including Alexander Graham Bell, Luther Burbank, W.M. Kellogg, David Starr\n\nJordan, the President of Stanford University, William Welch of Johns Hopkins University. Professors at Harvard, Columbia, Yale, and other universities taught 375 courses on Eugenics. The hypothesis that mental illness, crime, and poverty were inherited factors and could be cured through negative Eugenics had by the 1920‘s been accepted by American Society as fact. Contests for Fitter family were common at state fairs and Eugenics publications and ideas were widespread.\n\nThis could not have been possible without the hard work of many eminent men and the application of large amounts of money.\n\nThe great fortunes of The Carnegie Institution, The Rockefeller Foundation, Harriman family, Ford foundation, Milbank Memorial Fund, and others funded the ERO, The American Eugenics Society, The American Eugenics Party and others. The American\n\nEugenics movement actively encouraged foreign countries to participate, concentrating most heavily on Germany. The opening address of the Second International Congress of Eugenics in 1921 was repeated in German. Only 3,000 people had been forcibly sterilized by the time the famous case of Buck vs. Bell reached the Supreme Court. Carrie Buck was a 17 year old girl who became pregnant out of wedlock in 1920‘s Virginia. She was ostracized by her community and\n\nher baby Vivian Buck, was reported to the ERO as appearing not normal. Carrie and her\n\nmother‘s files were examined, both had previously been classified as MORONS and court proceedings were begun to have Carrie forcibly sterilized without examination.\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes delivered the verdict of the court in 1927. “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\n\nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765. Three generations of imbeciles are enough”.\n\nThis decision validated Virginia‘s Eugenical Sterilization Act and set in motion the\n\nforced sterilization of 30-60k American citizens. Eventually similar laws were passed in 34 other states. Carrie Buck was not a promiscuous and disruptive moronic slut as she had been portrayed at trial by the testimony of her school superintendent.\n\nShe had been raped by her foster family‘s son. She had been on the honor roll. Her forcible\n\nsterilization was a result of lies, incorrect diagnosis, and a plot to pass the Virginia Law.\n\nA review of the case uncovered a conspiracy between Carrie‘s defense lawyer and the\n\nColony of Virginia to ensure the constitutionality of Virginia‘s new law.\n\nThe state was trying to save money by sterilizing the growing population at its mental health facilities. The greatest impact of Buck vs. Bell was in Germany. In 1933 the Nazi government adopted the Prevention of Hereditarily Ill Offspring Act which was based on Buck vs. Bell and led to the forced sterilization of 375,000 people and the banning of marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Jews. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the Eugenicists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute including the work of Ernst Rudin, a leading psychiatrist who became an architect and prime director of the murderous medical experimentation programs conducted on thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and others. American money also endowed the work of Otmar Freiherr von Verchuer who headed the Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics. He wrote in his Eugenics Journal that ―Germany‘s war would yield a total solution to the Jewish Problem.‖ Verschuer had a longtime assistant. His name was Josef Mengele. On May 30, 1943, Mengele arrived at Auschwitz. Verschuer notified the German Research Society, “My assistant, Dr. Josef Mengele (M.D., Ph.D.) joined me in this branch of research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmführer (captain) and camp physician in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Anthropological testing of the most diverse racial groups in this concentration camp is being carried out with permission of the SS Reichsführer (Himmler).” Mengele began searching the boxcar arrivals for twins. When he found them, he performed beastly experiments, scrupulously wrote up the reports and sent the paperwork back to Verschuer’s institute for evaluation. Often, cadavers, eyes and other body parts were also dispatched to Berlin’s eugenic institutes. Several doctors who had been sent to Auschwitz for aiding Jews were forced to work as his assistants and described him thus…His experiments and observations were carried out in an abnormal fashion. When he made transfusions he purposely used incorrect blood types. He would inject substances and then ignore the results. He did what he pleased and conducted his experiments like a mad amateur. He was not a savant. He had the mania of a collector. He was also fascinated with gypsies and dwarfs as human specimens.\n\nHis experiments, lacking scientific value, were no more than foolish playing and all his activities were full of contradiction.\n\nIn other words, he was a hack with an MD and a Ph.D. in Eugenics, a quack science.\n\n―The toll of Eugenics Laws would fall heavily on non-Jewish Germans as well. The\n\nchronology of events is instructive. First patients in German mental facilities were\n\nsterilized, then it was decided to gas them. CO gas was used in the beginning but was\n\ndiscarded in favor of Zyklon B gas for reasons of economy and effectiveness. Next all the residents of the old age homes in Germany were either starved, given lethal injection,\n\nor gassed and then cremated. Finally German citizens who had physical disabilities, many quite mild or correctable, were euthanized. Between 50,000 and 100,000 were eventually killed.\n\nThe program was referred to as a mercy death however nothing could be farther from the\n\ntruth. Witnesses said that the floor, walls, and even ceiling of the gas chamber were stained with blood, vomit, urine and feces. At the center of the room would be an enormous pile of bodies in the general shape of a pyramid as people struggled to climb on top of each other to reach the last remaining breathable air near the ceiling.\n\nAmerican Eugenics movement leaders went underground and changed the name of their organizations.\n\nThe lifelong friendships between people like Verschuer and the leading members of the American Eugenics Movement continued even after the Holocaust. He and many others were never punished and remained influential men in society. Their portraits hang in many major universities, both in Germany and America. The names of their victims are mostly lost to history. They included the powerless, people who couldn‘t fight back. Carrie Buck‘s daughter died at the age of 8 years old due to an illness. In her short school career she had made the honor roll.\n\nHUMAN RADIATION STUDIES:\n\nIn December 1939 as Europe was poised on the brink of war, two German radiochemists\n\nsplit the uranium atom in their Berlin laboratory.\n\nThey confided the results to Lise Meitner and Otto Fritsch who calculated the released energy at 200 million electron volts for one atom. The significance of the event was understood immediately in scientific communities in all nations. Virtually unlimited energy could be produced in a controlled reaction and an uncontrolled reaction would yield an explosive of incredible power. The University of California at Berkeley was where plutonium 238 half life 86 years and plutonium 239 half life 24,000 years were first created. Seaborg, Segre and McMillan used cyclotrons to produce one microgram of plutonium. After months of work their product could be detected but was too small to be seen. Plutonium was described as a crazy metal, small amounts spontaneously combust in air so it must be handled in an environment free of oxygen. Depending on the chemical form it might be blue, green, purple, yellow, red, brown or pink. Seaborg said ―under some conditions it might be brittle like glass or soft like lead. It will disintegrate at room temperature, undergoing five phase changes between room temperature and the melting point. It is fiendishly toxic, even in small amounts.‖ Robley Evans who studied women exposed on the job to radium wrote that as little two micrograms, two millionths of a gram, was fatal. Ernest Lawrence told government officials that plutonium 239 ―could be used to make a super bomb.‖ It was 1941 and the United States would be in the war in a matter of months. Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Arthur Compton were instrumental in persuading FDR to study the feasibility of building a nuclear bomb. The Manhattan Project was the secret effort to build the atomic bomb. It was a gamble that represented several billion dollars and a significant percentage of the war time budget. The Oak Ridge plant in Tennessee was 56,000 acres devoted to making uranium-235 and the Hanford Washington site made plutonium. These facilities had taken the bench scale process and increased it a billion fold. General Leslie Groves was tapped to head the massive project. He appointed Robert Oppenheimer to be in charge of the design, construction, and testing of the weapon. Los Alamos, New Mexico was chosen as the site of the facility to build and test such a weapon. Quantum Physics was a science that had been invented by twenty year olds and the staff Oppenheimer assembled for the Manhattan Project reflected that. The bomb might not work and if the high explosive failed to ignite the fission reaction $2.5 billion dollars\n\n(1945) worth of plutonium would be scattered across the Jimenez Mountains. Jumbo was the largest fabricated object ever built, designed to contain the plutonium if ignition failed. At dawn on July 16, 1945 the Trinity site witnessed the detonation of the device code named Gadget. The remaining two devices, named Little Boy and Fat Man, were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9th killing approximately 200,000\n\npeople. WWII terror bombing of civilians began with the London Blitz killing 30,000\n\npeople and culminated in the firebombing of Dresden Germany and Tokyo. Napalm was\n\nused in 1,000 plane raids that incinerated approximately 200,000 people. The atomic\n\nbomb did not add to the scale of mass murder of civilian populations, but it certainly made it more efficient. Many of the scientists were appalled at the result, some had urged a demonstration shot.\n\nThe scientists declared publicly that the U.S. possessed only a few\n\nyears head start before another nation followed suit. Many of the scientists and some generals advocated international control and the eventual banning of nuclear weapons.\n\nThose that tried to head off a nuclear arms race in the end failed as events and\n\npersonalities took on a momentum of their own. Edward Teller advocated the super-\n\nheavy, the Hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer objected to the development of the Hydrogen bomb and stated that these were genocidal weapons. He was promptly replaced. Teller assumed the scientific leadership of the weapons program and remained influential for the entire Cold War. The largest Hydrogen bomb ever tested by the U.S. was around 40 megatons, 4,000 times more powerful than the 10 kiloton Hiroshima bomb. The nuclear\n\narms race that followed has resulted in the doctrine of MAD, mutually assured destruction. If either the US or USSR launch any or all of their half of the 20,000 nuclear\n\nweapons they have aimed at each other, then they can rest assured that they too would be completely destroyed in a retaliatory strike.\n\nThe nuclear arms race consumed much of\n\nthe wealth of the US leaving the civilian population living in very real fear that the world could end in a matter of minutes.\n\nNuclear testing began in the Pacific and the continental US. Residents of the Marshall Islands were forcibly relocated and dozens of devices were tested there, some so enormous they obliterated large parts of the islands. Captured and obsolete ships were placed in the blast zone with test animals on board. After the detonations thousands of observers and military moved near ground zero to decontaminate equipment. The military brass wanted to know how equipment and men would fare in a nuclear war. At what point are the ships too hot or the men too poisoned to continue to fight. The Air Force sent planes into radioactive clouds that registered 800 rad per hour or higher adopting lead helmets and special shielding in an effort to protect the pilots. The Army placed troops in trenches 1,000 yards from the blast and immediately after the explosion walked them on line through ground zero in an effort to prepare them psychologically for fighting with nuclear weapons. General James Cooney was the foremost advocate of testing and took authority away from the AEC Atomic Energy Commission for the responsibility of setting exposure limits on troops. Scientists were allowed exposure of no more than 3 rad for a 13 week period while limits for military personnel were officially set at 5 rad per test. The badges given to troops to wear measured only external beta radiation and were not used extensively. The scientists working for the AEC wore protective gear while the troops did not.\n\nThe health effects of radiation were fairly well known to the scientists involved\n\ndue to their animal studies, industrial accidents, and the very public deaths of Madame Curie and others. By the 1920‘s it was known that hundreds of the early pioneers in radiation studies were dead.\n\nA single dose of 350 rad was the human LD-50, the dose that caused death to half those exposed. One millionth of a gram, once inside the human body could cause death.\n\nA nuclear explosion immediately produces Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and X-ray radiation. Hundreds of different radioactive isotopic particles are formed as residual contamination that is absorbed into different body tissues with varying degrees of longevity and toxicity. One example is radioiodine that collects in the thyroid. This kaleidoscope of sources make it difficult to gage what dose has been delivered and to what effect. Inhalation of a small particle of plutonium would collect in the bone marrow and emit energies on the order of 200 million electron volts. The normal energy level of the human cell is 10 electron volts, and under such an assault the cell either dies, becomes inoperable, or grows uncontrollably, in other words, cancer. Arthur Compton and the other physicist knew what had happened to the earlier experimenters with radioactive materials. Compton chose Robert Stone in Berkeley and Joseph Hamilton at Chicago to research the biological aspects.\n\nThe scientists who conducted these experiments were not from the inner sanctum trying to build the Bomb, years 1951 and 1974 studying about 500 patients. The TBI experiments were only a subset of the radiation experiments on human subjects that included plutonium injections,\n\nradioactive isotope studies, and many others.\n\nVanderbilt University Hospital Prenatal Clinic hosted 850 pregnant women to a secret\n\nstudy using radioactive isotopes iron-55 and iron-59. The pregnant women were given a\n\ncocktail and told it was vitamins for their unborn child. Free health care was the lure\n\nused on the economically disadvantaged women. Helen Hutchison was 6 months pregnant and visited the clinic in July, 1946 seeking treatment for nausea. She was given a cocktail by the doctor and told to drink it, that it would make her feel better. Several\n\nmonths after the birth of her daughter her hair fell out and she developed blisters, anemia, and later had life threatening complications after several miscarriages.\n\nHer daughter Barbara was always tired as a child, developed an immune system disorder and skin cancer. Many of the mothers and children exposed to radioactive iron developed strange afflictions, rashes, anemia, blood disorders, and cancer. Paul Hahn, the principle investigator in the study, was a protégé of Stafford Warren and had worked with Robly Evans. Hahn wrote that iron-55 with a half life of 5 years was too hazardous to be given to humans and had no therapeutic value, yet he used it in this study which was partially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Helen Hutchison‘s husband had landed in Europe on D-Day, and had personally helped liberate Buchenwald concentration camp. The Nazi doctors who worked in the camp may have been some of the very men who participated in the radiation experiment on his wife and unborn child. One study conducted at the Fernald State School in Waltham, Massachusetts used\n\nradioactive iron and calcium secretly given to 74 orphans in their oatmeal using the ruse of a nutrition study. Robley Evans produced the radioactive isotopes in the MIT cyclotron and supervised the experiment. The lure used by the MIT scientists was membership in a\n\nscience club that went on school outings to baseball games and even Christmas parties at the MIT faculty club. The scientists may not have believed that the amount of radiation involved was harmful, but they would not have allowed this experiment to be conducted on their own families.\n\nAt Washington State Penitentiary and Oregon State Prison about 200 prisoners had their testicles irradiated with 8 to 600 rads with the lure of a little money and extra privileges.\n\nCarl Heller, one of the world‘s leading endocrinologists, and his protégé C. Alvin Paulsen ran the two studies from 1963 until 1971. These and similar experiments on thousands of people continued for 30 years in the vain search for a biological dosimeter. The identities and ultimate fates of the test subjects will never be known, most going to their graves never knowing they had been used as human guinea pigs by their government. Elmer Allen was designated experimental test subject CAL-13. On July 18, 1947 in a San Francisco Hospital he was injected with plutonium in the left leg. Three days later the leg was amputated at mid thigh. Elmer was a porter for the Pullman Company who injured his leg while stepping off a train. He was diagnosed with a fracture that developed into a cyst. The first test for cancer was negative, a second test indicated\n\ncancer. Unable to work after the amputation, he was forced to return to Italy, Texas with\n\nhis wife and three children. His wife recalled that he began having epileptic seizures, ―he\n\nwould chew the spoon to pieces, his tongue too‖. Elmer began drinking heavily and told his best friend that he had been used as a guinea pig, but no one not even his family\n\ndoctor believed him. The doctor later diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nDuring an effort to collect the bodies of the people injected with plutonium it was\n\ndiscovered to their amazement that 4 of them were still alive.\n\nIn 1973 Austin Bues, from the Center for Human Radiobiology wrote to Elmer and asked him to be in a metabolism study.\n\nHe and his wife were brought to Chicago and Elmer‘s urine and feces were collected for two weeks. The trip was paid for and Elmer received $140 plus $13 a day expenses. X-rays revealed bone damage consisted with radiation. One year after Elmer‘s death the family was contacted by a reporter and learned that Elmer had been a human experimental subject and the family had been lied to for 44 years. Elmer Allen died in 1991, his head stone reads Elmer Allen 1911-1947 CAL-13 1947- 1991 One of America‘s nuclear guinea pigs. On 7 December 1993, Secretary of Energy Hazel O‘Leary ordered her department to open classified files covering projects that had involved the use of human beings as guinea pigs since WWII. A major project was initiated to identify relevant documents. The index itself runs to 150 pages. The following is testimony from Elmer Allen‘s granddaughter before the President‘s Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, March, 1995.\n\nMONARCH: THE NEW PHOENIX PROGRAM\n\nBy Marshall Thomas\n\nONE:\n\nPhoenix Program\n\nTWO:\n\nHISTORY of US Government Human Experimentation:\n\nEugenics\n\nHuman Radiation Studies\n\nElmer Allen Granddaughter Testimony\n\nAgent Orange\n\nTHREE:\n\nCold War\n\nDoolittle\n\nMcCarthyism\n\nOperation Paperclip\n\nReinhardt Gehlen\n\nOperation Mockingbird\n\nOperation Northwoods\n\nFOUR:\n\nMKULTRA-1950’s\n\nBrainwashing- USSR, China, US\n\nHelms, Gottlieb\n\nAllen Dulles\n\nEstabrooks\n\nCameron\n\nMKULTRA-1960’s, 1970’s –\n\nHelms,\n\nAldrich\n\nPandora\n\nDelgado\n\nJolly West\n\nMKULTRA VICTIM TESTIMONY:\n\nValerie Wolfe, Claudia Mullen, Chris DeNicola\n\nProgramming levels\n\nFIVE:\n\nNonlethal weapons\n\nGreenham Common\n\nDOD/DOJ\n\nIraq\n\nSIX:\n\nCULTS\n\nAquino\n\nMoon\n\nFMSF\n\nRemote viewing\n\nSEVEN:\n\nTrojan Horse\n\nEIGHT:\n\nCointelpro\n\nNINE:\n\nCIA Blowback:\n\nGolden Triangle\n\nEd Wilson\n\nKatherine Griggs\n\nGuatemala organ donors\n\nTEN:\n\nDirected Energy Weapons USSR\n\nWoodpecker\n\nELEVEN:\n\nDirected Energy Weapons Scientists\n\nTWELVE:\n\nSDI/HAARP\n\nTHIRTEEN:\n\nMilitary Doctrine\n\nMindWar\n\nThe Aviary\n\nFOURTEEN:\n\nPatents/Spin-offs\n\nImplants\n\nADS\n\nMilliwave radar\n\nFIFTEEN:\n\nCIA/Corporate Proprietaries\n\nSAIC\n\nHadron\n\nDynCorp\n\nOperation Cyclone\n\nSIXTEEN:\n\nLaw\n\nGirard\n\nJohn Glenn\n\nAkwei\n\nMilgram\n\nStreet Theater\n\nTI experience\n\nWeed and Seed\n\nSEVENTEEN:\n\nEnd Game\n\nMONARCH: THE NEW PHOENIX PROGRAM\n\nPhoenix Program:\n\nThe Phoenix Program, created by the CIA in 1967, was aimed at “neutralizing”—through\n\nassassination, kidnapping, and torture, the civilian infrastructure that supported the Viet\n\nCong insurgency in South Vietnam. It was a terrifying “final solution” that violated the\n\nGeneva Conventions. The Phoenix Program’s civilian targets of assassination were VC\n\ntax collectors, supply officers, political cadre, local military officials, and suspected\n\nsympathizers. Faulty intelligence often led to the murder of innocent civilians, rival\n\nVietnamese would report their enemies as “VC” in order for US troops to kill them. In\n\n1971, William Colby, head of CIA in Vietnam, testified the number killed was 20,857.\n\nSouth Vietnamese government figures were 40,994 dead. CIA officer Ted Shackley\n\nmanaged (600 military and (40-50) CIA liaison officers) who were working with South Vietnamese officers in 44 provinces. Ted Shackley and Robert Komer played key roles in recruiting Phoenix Program personnel. Many Covert Action officers were Cuban\n\nrefugees from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. They ran the CIA’s Counter-Terror (CT) Teams,\n\nwhich were in fact assassination squads. Colby, Komer, and Shackley reported to DCI\n\nRichard Helms and the White House. From the beginning the Phoenix Program was\n\nconceived by the White House and supported by the CIA. Phoenix called for “neutralizing” 1800 targets a month. About one third of VC targeted for arrest were summarily executed. Green Berets and Navy SEALs would assassinate suspected VC sympathizers or cadres, as well as South Vietnamese collaborators and double agents. In 1982 an Ex-Phoenix operative revealed that sometimes orders were given to kill U.S.\n\nmilitary personnel who were considered security risks. He suspects the orders came not from “division”, but from a higher authority such as the CIA or the Office of Naval Intelligence.\n\nThe following is testimony of Vincent Okamoto, combat officer (Lieutenant) in Vietnam in 1968, and recipient of Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award conferred by the US Army. Wounded 3 times. “The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist? It’s not like you had their address and telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say, ‘Where’s Nguyen so-and-so?’ Half the time the people were so afraid they would say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take the informant, put a sandbag over his head, poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire around his neck like a long leash, and walk him through the village and say, ‘When we go by Nguyen’s house scratch your head.’\n\nThen that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say, ‘April Fool,\n\nmotherfucker.’ Whoever answered the door would get wasted. As far as they were\n\nconcerned whoever answered was a Communist, including family members. Sometimes they’d come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people.”\n\nPenetrations into the Viet Cong Infrastructure was accomplished by blackmailing or\n\nterrorizing a member of a targeted individual’s family to gathering information. Every Vietnamese 15 and over had to register and carry identity cards, these records were\n\ncomputerized and eventually it evolved into a highly computerized and statistical means of generating 1800 names a month for the target list, coordinating the information on suspects from 30,000 plus informants. When the strategic Hamlet program failed, CIA and military intelligence concentrated on the Phoenix Program, a terror campaign aimed at the civilian population. Instead of winning hearts and minds, using the threat of assassination and a state of terror to defeat the NV. Many non-political Vietnamese were arrested and tortured and in effect forced into the resistance army. Phoenix Program architect Robert Komer, after leaving the Pentagon said, “I would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved”. He called the war “a strategic disaster which cost us 57,000 lives and a half trillion dollars”.\n\nPhoenix USA: The Vietnam War was the formative experience for a generation of CIA\n\nand military intelligence personnel involved in the Phoenix Program. They viewed the\n\nmilitary defeat in Vietnam as a betrayal on the home front, a loss of will by domestic\n\npolitical enemies, not a military failure against a nationalist revolution fought as a\n\nguerilla war. The Phoenix Program, assassinating suspected VC sympathizers in a\n\nsystematic manner, worked well and is the blueprint for the current black op targeting\n\nthousands of loyal Americans using state of the art microwave (MW) and radio frequency\n\nradiation (RFR) weapons. The motivation to suppress domestic dissidents and to\n\nassassinate loyal American opposition stems from the perception of dissent against the\n\nwar as treason. This philosophy is stated very clearly in the MindWar paper written by\n\nNSA General Aquino. The DOD has a huge stake in futuristic technology that kills by ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, leaving little or no trace. The indiscriminant killing of the Phoenix Program continues on American soil. The terms soft kill, slow kill and silent kill refer to the new way of killing the enemy in conflicts short of war and the small wars of the future.\n\nThe counterinsurgency doctrine has now been applied to the home front, so that the perceived betrayal of the military in Vietnam will not be repeated. The generation of CIA and military intelligence led by Shackley, Helms, Casey, Abrams, Singlaub, Secord, John B. Alexander, Michael Aquino, Paul Vallely, and others have built the perfect beast, using selective assassination that leaves no trace. The ability to cull the human herd with Silent Kill technology allows a few personalities to remake the entire society in their own image. Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) technology kills with ionizing and non-ionizing radiation or slowly drives the target crazy with silent sound, similar to CIA MKULTRA psychiatrist Ewen Camerons psychic driving technique used to break down the targets personality. The new buzzwords at the Pentagon are silent kill, synthetic telepathy and psychotronics. Another means of attack on targets is the Smirnov patent that uses subliminal suggestion to manipulate human behavior. This patent was purchased by the remote viewing company Psi Tech Corporation. Military intelligence officers involved in developing these “non-lethal weapons” include Col. John B. Alexander, NSA General Michael Aquino, Harold Puthoff, and others, also control Psi Tech. Emotional manipulation is accomplished using Dr. Michael Persinger’s work to remotely project emotional states that the brain entrains or locks onto and emulates. One can broadcast rage or fear at an individual target to manipulate and control them. As if these methods were not enough to torture and murder people, add to this nightmarish toolbox, active gang stalking. CIA created cults and other cause-oriented groups are used to induce further trauma in the target by actively harassing them in public in a neutralization technique described in counterintelligence operations manuals that are aimed at enemy agents. In the race to develop a new weapon system it has always been necessary to test it on human beings. Perfecting the latest weapons designed to kill slowly and silently as well as perfecting the process of controlling the human mind are no\n\ndifferent. Once the weaponry has been perfected on these few thousand people the same techniques will be applied en mass to the general population, and then to humanity as a whole.\n\nCol. John B. Alexander stated in an interview with the Washington Post in 2007, …The military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of MK-ULTRA, the infamous CIA program that involved, in part, slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims. “Until recently, anything that smacked of [mind control] was extremely dangerous” because Congress would simply take the money away, he said. Alexander acknowledged that “there were some abuses that took place,” but added that, on the whole, “I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water”. But September 11, 2001, changed the mood in Washington, and some in the national security community are again expressing interest in mind control, particularly a younger generation of officials who weren’t around for MK-ULTRA. “It’s interesting, that it’s coming back,” Alexander observed. While Alexander scoffs at the notion that he is somehow part of an elaborate plot to control people’s minds, he acknowledges support for learning how to tap into a potential enemy’s brain. He gives as an example the possible use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, for lie detection. “Brain mapping” with fMRI theoretically could allow interrogators to know when someone is lying by watching for activity in particular parts of the brain. For interrogating terrorists, fMRI could come in handy.\n\nAlexander also is intrigued by the possibility of using electronic means to modify\n\nbehavior. The dilemma of the war on terrorism, he notes, is that it never ends. So what do you do with enemies, such as those at Guantanamo: keep them there forever? That’s impractical. Behavior modification could be an alternative, he says. “Maybe I can fix\n\nyou, or electronically neuter you, so it’s safe to release you into society, so you won’t\n\ncome back and kill me,” Alexander says.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before technology\n\nallows that scenario to come true, he continues. “We’re now getting to where we can do that”. “Where does that fall in the ethics spectrum? That’s a really tough question”.\n\nHISTORY OF US GOVT HUMAN\n\nEXPERIMENTATION:\n\nIn order to understand the current state sponsored human experimentation, it is\n\nnecessary to begin with previous programs that began in the early 1900’s, and\n\ncontinued to the present day.\n\nEUGENICS MOVEMENT\n\nEugenics originated in England with the work of Francis Galton who studied hereditary\n\ntraits in families and began the nature versus nurture debate and its ultimate focus on\n\ntwins to answer the question of what was more powerful heredity or environment. He\n\nproposed positive Eugenics, encouraging the reproduction of eminent men and families.\n\nHe cautioned against drawing premature and harmful conclusions from his work, but like\n\nhis cousin, Charles Darwin, his work was used as justification for some of the greatest\n\ncrimes in history. Negative Eugenics is the application of means to discourage the\n\nbreeding of the―unfit‖, including anti-race mixing marriage laws, segregation\n\n(institutionalization), sterilization, and euthanasia. Eugenics is not a true science and\n\nthough it is dressed up in mathematics to give it legitimacy it has more in common with\n\nthe quack science of Phrenology. Phrenology was the study of the head size and shape to\n\ndetermine intelligence and character.\n\nThe industrial age had thrown millions of people off the farm and into the city to work in low paying factory jobs. The sheer scale of the problems of mental illness, alcoholism\n\nand crime seemed overwhelming. Added to this, millions of Eastern Europeans and\n\nItalians came to America and made native the population uneasy. They were viewed as\n\nbad stock compared to the more―Nordic types‖ that made up earlier waves of\n\nimmigration from Western Europe. Suggestions for solving these problems took the form of segregation, sterilization, and mass euthanasia, however the Eugenics movement leaders were smart enough to realize that America was not prepared for euthanasia. The Eugenics movement took shape in America with the founding of the Eugenics Recording Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1910 by Charles Davenport with money from the Carnegie Institution. The ERO compiled millions of files on ordinary Americans.\n\nThe adherents of Eugenics included some of the most influential doctors and scientists of\n\nthe era, including Alexander Graham Bell, Luther Burbank, W.M. Kellogg, David Starr\n\nJordan, the President of Stanford University, William Welch of Johns Hopkins University. Professors at Harvard, Columbia, Yale, and other universities taught 375 courses on Eugenics. The hypothesis that mental illness, crime, and poverty were inherited factors and could be cured through negative Eugenics had by the 1920‘s been accepted by American Society as fact. Contests for Fitter family were common at state fairs and Eugenics publications and ideas were widespread.\n\nThis could not have been possible without the hard work of many eminent men and the application of large amounts of money.\n\nThe great fortunes of The Carnegie Institution, The Rockefeller Foundation, Harriman family, Ford foundation, Milbank Memorial Fund, and others funded the ERO, The American Eugenics Society, The American Eugenics Party and others. The American\n\nEugenics movement actively encouraged foreign countries to participate, concentrating most heavily on Germany. The opening address of the Second International Congress of Eugenics in 1921 was repeated in German. Only 3,000 people had been forcibly sterilized by the time the famous case of Buck vs. Bell reached the Supreme Court. Carrie Buck was a 17 year old girl who became\n\npregnant out of wedlock in 1920‘s Virginia. She was ostracized by her community and\n\nher baby Vivian Buck, was reported to the ERO as appearing not normal. Carrie and her\n\nmother‘s files were examined, both had previously been classified as MORONS and\n\ncourt proceedings were begun to have Carrie forcibly sterilized without examination.\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes delivered the verdict of the court in 1927. “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\n\nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765. Three generations of imbeciles are enough”.\n\nThis decision validated Virginia‘s Eugenical Sterilization Act and set in motion the\n\nforced sterilization of 30-60k American citizens. Eventually similar laws were passed in 34 other states. Carrie Buck was not a promiscuous and disruptive moronic slut as she had been portrayed at trial by the testimony of her school superintendent.\n\nShe had been raped by her foster family‘s son. She had been on the honor roll. Her forcible\n\nsterilization was a result of lies, incorrect diagnosis, and a plot to pass the Virginia Law.\n\nA review of the case uncovered a conspiracy between Carrie‘s defense lawyer and the\n\nColony of Virginia to ensure the constitutionality of Virginia‘s new law.\n\nThe state was trying to save money by sterilizing the growing population at its mental health facilities. The greatest impact of Buck vs. Bell was in Germany. In 1933 the Nazi government adopted the Prevention of Hereditarily Ill Offspring Act which was based on Buck vs. Bell and led to the forced sterilization of 375,000 people and the banning of marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Jews. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the Eugenicists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute including the work of Ernst Rudin, a leading psychiatrist who became an architect and prime director of the murderous medical experimentation programs conducted on thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and others. American money also endowed the work of Otmar Freiherr von Verchuer who headed the Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics. He wrote in his Eugenics Journal that ―Germany‘s war would yield a total solution to the Jewish Problem.‖ Verschuer had a longtime assistant. His name was Josef Mengele. On May 30, 1943, Mengele arrived at Auschwitz. Verschuer notified the German Research Society, “My assistant, Dr. Josef Mengele (M.D., Ph.D.) joined me in this branch of research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmführer (captain) and camp physician in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Anthropological testing of the most diverse racial groups in this concentration camp is being carried out with permission of the SS Reichsführer (Himmler).” Mengele began searching the boxcar arrivals for twins. When he found them, he performed beastly experiments, scrupulously wrote up the reports and sent the paperwork back to Verschuer’s institute for evaluation. Often, cadavers, eyes and other body parts were also dispatched to Berlin’s eugenic institutes. Several doctors who had been sent to Auschwitz for aiding Jews were forced to work as his assistants and described him thus…His experiments and observations were carried out in an abnormal fashion. When he made transfusions he purposely used incorrect blood types. He would inject substances and then ignore the results. He did what he pleased and conducted his experiments like a mad amateur. He was not a savant. He had the mania of a collector. He was also fascinated with gypsies and dwarfs as human specimens. His experiments, lacking scientific value, were no more than foolish playing and all his activities were full of contradiction.\n\nIn other words, he was a hack with an MD and a Ph.D. in Eugenics, a quack science.\n\n―The toll of Eugenics Laws would fall heavily on non-Jewish Germans as well. The\n\nchronology of events is instructive. First patients in German mental facilities were\n\nsterilized, then it was decided to gas them. CO gas was used in the beginning but was\n\ndiscarded in favor of Zyklon B gas for reasons of economy and effectiveness. Next all the residents of the old age homes in Germany were either starved, given lethal injection,\n\nor gassed and then cremated. Finally German citizens who had physical disabilities, many quite mild or correctable, were euthanized. Between 50,000 and 100,000 were eventually killed.\n\nThe program was referred to as a mercy death however nothing could be farther from the\n\ntruth. Witnesses said that the floor, walls, and even ceiling of the gas chamber were stained with blood, vomit, urine and feces. At the center of the room would be an enormous pile of bodies in the general shape of a pyramid as people struggled to climb on top of each other to reach the last remaining breathable air near the ceiling.\n\nAmerican Eugenics movement leaders went underground and changed the name of their\n\norganizations. The lifelong friendships between people like Verschuer and the leading members of the American Eugenics Movement continued even after the Holocaust. He and many others were never punished and remained influential men in society. Their portraits hang in many major universities, both in Germany and America. The names of their victims are mostly lost to history. They included the powerless, people who couldn‘t fight back. Carrie Buck‘s daughter died at the age of 8 years old due to an illness. In her short school career she had made the honor roll.\n\nHUMAN RADIATION STUDIES:\n\nIn December 1939 as Europe was poised on the brink of war, two German radiochemists\n\nsplit the uranium atom in their Berlin laboratory. They confided the results to Lise\n\nMeitner and Otto Fritsch who calculated the released energy at 200 million electron volts\n\nfor one atom. The significance of the event was understood immediately in scientific\n\ncommunities in all nations. Virtually unlimited energy could be produced in a controlled reaction and an uncontrolled reaction would yield an explosive of incredible power. The University of California at Berkeley was where plutonium 238 half life 86 years and plutonium 239 half life 24,000 years were first created. Seaborg, Segre and McMillan used cyclotrons to produce one microgram of plutonium. After months of work their product could be detected but was too small to be seen. Plutonium was described as a crazy metal, small amounts spontaneously combust in air so it must be handled in an environment free of oxygen. Depending on the chemical form it might be blue, green, purple, yellow, red, brown or pink. Seaborg said ―under some conditions it might be brittle like glass or soft like lead. It will disintegrate at room temperature, undergoing five phase changes between room temperature and the melting point. It is fiendishly toxic, even in small amounts.‖ Robley Evans who studied women exposed on the job to radium wrote that as little two micrograms, two millionths of a gram, was fatal. Ernest Lawrence told government officials that plutonium 239 ―could be used to make a super bomb.‖ It was 1941 and the United States would be in the war in a matter of months. Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Arthur Compton were instrumental in persuading FDR to study the feasibility of building a nuclear bomb. The Manhattan Project was the secret effort to build the atomic bomb. It was a gamble that represented several billion dollars and a significant percentage of the war time budget. The Oak Ridge plant in Tennessee\n\nwas 56,000 acres devoted to making uranium-235 and the Hanford Washington site made plutonium. These facilities had taken the bench scale process and increased it a billion fold. General Leslie Groves was tapped to head the massive project. He appointed Robert Oppenheimer to be in charge of the design, construction, and testing of the weapon. Los Alamos, New Mexico was chosen as the site of the facility to build and test such a weapon. Quantum Physics was a science that had been invented by twenty year olds and the staff Oppenheimer assembled for the Manhattan Project reflected that. The bomb might not work and if the high explosive failed to ignite the fission reaction $2.5 billion dollars\n\n(1945) worth of plutonium would be scattered across the Jimenez Mountains. Jumbo was the largest fabricated object ever built, designed to contain the plutonium if ignition failed. At dawn on July 16, 1945 the Trinity site witnessed the detonation of the device code named Gadget. The remaining two devices, named Little Boy and Fat Man, were\n\nused on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9th killing approximately 200,000\n\npeople. WWII terror bombing of civilians began with the London Blitz killing 30,000\n\npeople and culminated in the firebombing of Dresden Germany and Tokyo. Napalm was\n\nused in 1,000 plane raids that incinerated approximately 200,000 people. The atomic\n\nbomb did not add to the scale of mass murder of civilian populations, but it certainly made it more efficient. Many of the scientists were appalled at the result, some had urged a demonstration shot. The scientists declared publicly that the U.S. possessed only a few\n\nyears head start before another nation followed suit. Many of the scientists and some generals advocated international control and the eventual banning of nuclear weapons.\n\nThose that tried to head off a nuclear arms race in the end failed as events and\n\npersonalities took on a momentum of their own. Edward Teller advocated the super-\n\nheavy, the Hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer objected to the development of the Hydrogen\n\nbomb and stated that these were genocidal weapons. He was promptly replaced. Teller\n\nassumed the scientific leadership of the weapons program and remained influential for the entire Cold War. The largest Hydrogen bomb ever tested by the U.S. was around 40\n\nmegatons, 4,000 times more powerful than the 10 kiloton Hiroshima bomb. The nuclear\n\narms race that followed has resulted in the doctrine of MAD, mutually assured destruction. If either the US or USSR launch any or all of their half of the 20,000 nuclear\n\nweapons they have aimed at each other, then they can rest assured that they too would be\n\ncompletely destroyed in a retaliatory strike. The nuclear arms race consumed much of\n\nthe wealth of the US leaving the civilian population living in very real fear that the world could end in a matter of minutes.\n\nNuclear testing began in the Pacific and the continental US. Residents of the Marshall\n\nIslands were forcibly relocated and dozens of devices were tested there, some so enormous they obliterated large parts of the islands. Captured and obsolete ships were placed in the blast zone with test animals on board. After the detonations thousands of observers and military moved near ground zero to decontaminate equipment. The military brass wanted to know how equipment and men would fare in a nuclear war. At what point are the ships too hot or the men too poisoned to continue to fight. The Air Force sent planes into radioactive clouds that registered 800 rad per hour or higher adopting lead helmets and special shielding in an effort to protect the pilots. The Army placed troops in trenches 1,000 yards from the blast and immediately after the explosion walked them on line through ground zero in an effort to prepare them psychologically for fighting with nuclear weapons. General James Cooney was the foremost advocate of testing and took authority away from the AEC Atomic Energy Commission for the responsibility of setting exposure limits on troops. Scientists were allowed exposure of no more than 3 rad for a 13 week period while limits for military personnel were officially set at 5 rad per test. The badges given to troops to wear measured only external beta radiation and were not used extensively. The scientists working for the AEC wore protective gear while the troops\n\ndid not. The health effects of radiation were fairly well known to the scientists involved\n\ndue to their animal studies, industrial accidents, and the very public deaths of Madame Curie and others. By the 1920‘s it was known that hundreds of the early pioneers in radiation studies were dead.\n\nA single dose of 350 rad was the human LD-50, the dose that caused death to half those exposed. One millionth of a gram, once inside the human body could cause death.\n\nA nuclear explosion immediately produces Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and X-ray radiation. Hundreds of different radioactive isotopic particles are formed as residual contamination that is absorbed into different body tissues with varying degrees of longevity and toxicity. One example is radioiodine that collects in the thyroid. This kaleidoscope of sources make it difficult to gage what dose has been delivered and to what effect. Inhalation of a small particle of plutonium would collect in the bone marrow and emit energies on the order of 200 million electron volts. The normal energy level of the human cell is 10 electron volts, and under such an assault the cell either dies, becomes inoperable, or grows uncontrollably, in other words, cancer. Arthur Compton and the other physicist knew what had happened to the earlier experimenters with radioactive materials. Compton chose Robert Stone in Berkeley and Joseph Hamilton at Chicago to research the biological aspects. The scientists who conducted these experiments were not from the inner sanctum trying to build the Bomb, years 1951 and 1974 studying about 500 patients. The TBI experiments were only a subset of the radiation experiments on human subjects that included plutonium injections,\n\nradioactive isotope studies, and many others.\n\nVanderbilt University Hospital Prenatal Clinic hosted 850 pregnant women to a secret\n\nstudy using radioactive isotopes iron-55 and iron-59. The pregnant women were given a\n\ncocktail and told it was vitamins for their unborn child. Free health care was the lure\n\nused on the economically disadvantaged women. Helen Hutchison was 6 months\n\npregnant and visited the clinic in July, 1946 seeking treatment for nausea. She was given\n\na cocktail by the doctor and told to drink it, that it would make her feel better. Several\n\nmonths after the birth of her daughter her hair fell out and she developed blisters, anemia, and later had life threatening complications after several miscarriages.\n\nHer daughter Barbara was always tired as a child, developed an immune system disorder and skin cancer. Many of the mothers and children exposed to radioactive iron developed strange afflictions, rashes, anemia, blood disorders, and cancer. Paul Hahn, the principle investigator in the study, was a protégé of Stafford Warren and had worked with Robly Evans. Hahn wrote that iron-55 with a half life of 5 years was too hazardous to be given to humans and had no therapeutic value, yet he used it in this study which was partially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Helen Hutchison‘s husband had landed in Europe on D-Day, and had personally helped liberate Buchenwald concentration camp. The Nazi doctors who worked in the camp may have been some of the very men who participated in the radiation experiment on his wife and unborn child. One study conducted at the Fernald State School in Waltham, Massachusetts used\n\nradioactive iron and calcium secretly given to 74 orphans in their oatmeal using the ruse of a nutrition study. Robley Evans produced the radioactive isotopes in the MIT cyclotron and supervised the experiment. The lure used by the MIT scientists was membership in a\n\nscience club that went on school outings to baseball games and even Christmas parties at the MIT faculty club. The scientists may not have believed that the amount of radiation involved was harmful, but they would not have allowed this experiment to be conducted on their own families.\n\nAt Washington State Penitentiary and Oregon State Prison about 200 prisoners had their testicles irradiated with 8 to 600 rads with the lure of a little money and extra privileges.\n\nCarl Heller, one of the world‘s leading endocrinologists, and his protégé C. Alvin Paulsen ran the two studies from 1963 until 1971. These and similar experiments on thousands of people continued for 30 years in the vain search for a biological dosimeter. The identities and ultimate fates of the test subjects will never be known, most going to their graves never knowing they had been used as human guinea pigs by their government. Elmer Allen was designated experimental test subject CAL-13. On July 18, 1947 in a San Francisco Hospital he was injected with plutonium in the left leg. Three days later the leg was amputated at mid thigh. Elmer was a porter for the Pullman Company who injured his leg while stepping off a train. He was diagnosed with a fracture that developed into a cyst. The first test for cancer was negative, a second test indicated\n\ncancer. Unable to work after the amputation, he was forced to return to Italy, Texas with\n\nhis wife and three children. His wife recalled that he began having epileptic seizures, ―he\n\nwould chew the spoon to pieces, his tongue too‖. Elmer began drinking heavily and told\n\nhis best friend that he had been used as a guinea pig, but no one not even his family\n\ndoctor believed him. The doctor later diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nDuring an effort to collect the bodies of the people injected with plutonium it was\n\ndiscovered to their amazement that 4 of them were still alive. In 1973 Austin Bues, from\n\nthe Center for Human Radiobiology wrote to Elmer and asked him to be in a metabolism\n\nstudy. He and his wife were brought to Chicago and Elmer‘s urine and feces were\n\ncollected for two weeks. The trip was paid for and Elmer received $140 plus $13 a day\n\nexpenses. X-rays revealed bone damage consisted with radiation. One year after Elmer‘s death the family was contacted by a reporter and learned that Elmer had been a human experimental subject and the family had been lied to for 44 years. Elmer Allen died in 1991, his head stone reads Elmer Allen 1911-1947 CAL-13 1947- 1991 One of America‘s nuclear guinea pigs. On 7 December 1993, Secretary of Energy Hazel O‘Leary ordered her department to open classified files covering projects that had involved the use of human beings as guinea pigs since WWII. A major project was initiated to identify relevant documents. The index itself runs to 150 pages. The following is testimony from Elmer Allen‘s granddaughter before the President‘s Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, March, 1995.\n\nMONARCH: THE NEW PHOENIX PROGRAM\n\nBy Marshall Thomas\n\nONE:\n\nPhoenix Program\n\nTWO:\n\nHISTORY of US Government Human Experimentation:\n\nEugenics\n\nHuman Radiation Studies\n\nElmer Allen Granddaughter Testimony\n\nAgent Orange\n\nTHREE:\n\nCold War\n\nDoolittle\n\nMcCarthyism\n\nOperation Paperclip\n\nReinhardt Gehlen\n\nOperation Mockingbird\n\nOperation Northwoods\n\nFOUR:\n\nMKULTRA-1950’s\n\nBrainwashing- USSR, China, US\n\nHelms, Gottlieb\n\nAllen Dulles\n\nEstabrooks\n\nCameron\n\nMKULTRA-1960’s, 1970’s –\n\nHelms,\n\nAldrich\n\nPandora\n\nDelgado\n\nJolly West\n\nMKULTRA VICTIM TESTIMONY:\n\nValerie Wolfe, Claudia Mullen, Chris DeNicola\n\nProgramming levels\n\nFIVE:\n\nNonlethal weapons\n\nGreenham Common\n\nDOD/DOJ\n\nIraq\n\nSIX:\n\nCULTS\n\nAquino\n\nMoon\n\nFMSF\n\nRemote viewing\n\nSEVEN:\n\nTrojan Horse\n\nEIGHT:\n\nCointelpro\n\nNINE:\n\nCIA Blowback:\n\nGolden Triangle\n\nEd Wilson\n\nKatherine Griggs\n\nGuatemala organ donors\n\nTEN:\n\nDirected Energy Weapons USSR\n\nWoodpecker\n\nELEVEN:\n\nDirected Energy Weapons Scientists\n\nTWELVE:\n\nSDI/HAARP\n\nTHIRTEEN:\n\nMilitary Doctrine\n\nMindWar\n\nThe Aviary\n\nFOURTEEN:\n\nPatents/Spin-offs\n\nImplants\n\nADS\n\nMilliwave radar\n\nFIFTEEN:\n\nCIA/Corporate Proprietaries\n\nSAIC\n\nHadron\n\nDynCorp\n\nOperation Cyclone\n\nSIXTEEN:\n\nLaw\n\nGirard\n\nJohn Glenn\n\nAkwei\n\nMilgram\n\nStreet Theater\n\nTI experience\n\nWeed and Seed\n\nSEVENTEEN:\n\nEnd Game\n\nMONARCH: THE NEW PHOENIX PROGRAM\n\nPhoenix Program:\n\nThe Phoenix Program, created by the CIA in 1967, was aimed at “neutralizing”—through\n\nassassination, kidnapping, and torture, the civilian infrastructure that supported the Viet\n\nCong insurgency in South Vietnam. It was a terrifying “final solution” that violated the\n\nGeneva Conventions. The Phoenix Program’s civilian targets of assassination were VC\n\ntax collectors, supply officers, political cadre, local military officials, and suspected\n\nsympathizers. Faulty intelligence often led to the murder of innocent civilians, rival\n\nVietnamese would report their enemies as “VC” in order for US troops to kill them. In\n\n1971, William Colby, head of CIA in Vietnam, testified the number killed was 20,857.\n\nSouth Vietnamese government figures were 40,994 dead. CIA officer Ted Shackley\n\nmanaged (600 military and (40-50) CIA liaison officers) who were working with South Vietnamese officers in 44 provinces. Ted Shackley and Robert Komer played key roles in recruiting Phoenix Program personnel. Many Covert Action officers were Cuban\n\nrefugees from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. They ran the CIA’s Counter-Terror (CT) Teams,\n\nwhich were in fact assassination squads. Colby, Komer, and Shackley reported to DCI\n\nRichard Helms and the White House. From the beginning the Phoenix Program was\n\nconceived by the White House and supported by the CIA. Phoenix called for “neutralizing” 1800 targets a month. About one third of VC targeted for arrest were summarily executed. Green Berets and Navy SEALs would assassinate suspected VC sympathizers or cadres, as well as South Vietnamese collaborators and double agents. In 1982 an Ex-Phoenix operative revealed that sometimes orders were given to kill U.S.\n\nmilitary personnel who were considered security risks. He suspects the orders came not from “division”, but from a higher authority such as the CIA or the Office of Naval Intelligence.\n\nThe following is testimony of Vincent Okamoto, combat officer (Lieutenant) in Vietnam in 1968, and recipient of Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award conferred by the US Army. Wounded 3 times. “The problem was, how do you find the people on the blacklist? It’s not like you had their address and telephone number. The normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say, ‘Where’s Nguyen so-and-so?’ Half the time the people were so afraid they would say anything. Then a Phoenix team would take the informant, put a sandbag over his head, poke out two holes so he could see, put commo wire around his neck like a long leash, and walk him through the village and say, ‘When we go by Nguyen’s house scratch your head.’\n\nThen that night Phoenix would come back, knock on the door, and say, ‘April Fool,\n\nmotherfucker.’ Whoever answered the door would get wasted. As far as they were\n\nconcerned whoever answered was a Communist, including family members. Sometimes they’d come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people.”\n\nPenetrations into the Viet Cong Infrastructure was accomplished by blackmailing or\n\nterrorizing a member of a targeted individual’s family to gathering information. Every Vietnamese 15 and over had to register and carry identity cards, these records were\n\ncomputerized and eventually it evolved into a highly computerized and statistical means of generating 1800 names a month for the target list, coordinating the information on suspects from 30,000 plus informants. When the strategic Hamlet program failed, CIA and military intelligence concentrated on the Phoenix Program, a terror campaign aimed at the civilian population. Instead of winning hearts and minds, using the threat of assassination and a state of terror to defeat the NV. Many non-political Vietnamese were arrested and tortured and in effect forced into the resistance army. Phoenix Program architect Robert Komer, after leaving the Pentagon said, “I would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved”. He called the war “a strategic disaster which cost us 57,000 lives and a half trillion dollars”.\n\nPhoenix USA: The Vietnam War was the formative experience for a generation of CIA\n\nand military intelligence personnel involved in the Phoenix Program. They viewed the\n\nmilitary defeat in Vietnam as a betrayal on the home front, a loss of will by domestic\n\npolitical enemies, not a military failure against a nationalist revolution fought as a\n\nguerilla war. The Phoenix Program, assassinating suspected VC sympathizers in a\n\nsystematic manner, worked well and is the blueprint for the current black op targeting\n\nthousands of loyal Americans using state of the art microwave (MW) and radio frequency\n\nradiation (RFR) weapons. The motivation to suppress domestic dissidents and to\n\nassassinate loyal American opposition stems from the perception of dissent against the\n\nwar as treason. This philosophy is stated very clearly in the MindWar paper written by\n\nNSA General Aquino. The DOD has a huge stake in futuristic technology that kills by ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, leaving little or no trace. The indiscriminant killing of the Phoenix Program continues on American soil. The terms soft kill, slow kill and silent kill refer to the new way of killing the enemy in conflicts short of war and the small wars of the future.\n\nThe counterinsurgency doctrine has now been applied to the home front, so that the perceived betrayal of the military in Vietnam will not be repeated. The generation of CIA and military intelligence led by Shackley, Helms, Casey, Abrams, Singlaub, Secord, John B. Alexander, Michael Aquino, Paul Vallely, and others have built the perfect beast, using selective assassination that leaves no trace. The ability to cull the human herd with Silent Kill technology allows a few personalities to remake the entire society in their own image. Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) technology kills with ionizing and non-ionizing radiation or slowly drives the target crazy with silent sound, similar to CIA MKULTRA psychiatrist Ewen Camerons psychic driving technique used to break down the targets personality. The new buzzwords at the Pentagon are silent kill, synthetic telepathy and psychotronics. Another means of attack on targets is the Smirnov patent that uses subliminal suggestion to manipulate human behavior. This patent was purchased by the remote viewing company Psi Tech Corporation. Military intelligence officers involved in developing these “non-lethal weapons” include Col. John B. Alexander, NSA General Michael Aquino, Harold Puthoff, and others, also control Psi Tech. Emotional manipulation is accomplished using Dr. Michael Persinger’s work to remotely project emotional states that the brain entrains or locks onto and emulates. One can broadcast rage or fear at an individual target to manipulate and control them. As if these methods were not enough to torture and murder people, add to this nightmarish toolbox, active gang stalking. CIA created cults and other cause-oriented groups are used to induce further trauma in the target by actively harassing them in public in a neutralization technique described in counterintelligence operations manuals that are aimed at enemy agents. In the race to develop a new weapon system it has always been necessary to test it on human beings. Perfecting the latest weapons designed to kill slowly and silently as well as perfecting the process of controlling the human mind are no\n\ndifferent. Once the weaponry has been perfected on these few thousand people the same techniques will be applied en mass to the general population, and then to humanity as a whole.\n\nCol. John B. Alexander stated in an interview with the Washington Post in 2007, …The military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of MK-ULTRA, the infamous CIA program that involved, in part, slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims. “Until recently, anything that smacked of [mind control] was extremely dangerous” because Congress would simply take the money away, he said. Alexander acknowledged that “there were some abuses that took place,” but added that, on the whole, “I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water”. But September 11, 2001, changed the mood in Washington, and some in the national security community are again expressing interest in mind control, particularly a younger generation of officials who weren’t around for MK-ULTRA. “It’s interesting, that it’s coming back,” Alexander observed. While Alexander scoffs at the notion that he is somehow part of an elaborate plot to control people’s minds, he acknowledges support for learning how to tap into a potential enemy’s brain. He gives as an example the possible use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, for lie detection. “Brain mapping” with fMRI theoretically could allow interrogators to know when someone is lying by watching for activity in particular parts of the brain. For interrogating terrorists, fMRI could come in handy.\n\nAlexander also is intrigued by the possibility of using electronic means to modify\n\nbehavior. The dilemma of the war on terrorism, he notes, is that it never ends. So what do you do with enemies, such as those at Guantanamo: keep them there forever? That’s impractical. Behavior modification could be an alternative, he says. “Maybe I can fix\n\nyou, or electronically neuter you, so it’s safe to release you into society, so you won’t\n\ncome back and kill me,” Alexander says.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before technology\n\nallows that scenario to come true, he continues. “We’re now getting to where we can do that”. “Where does that fall in the ethics spectrum? That’s a really tough question”.\n\nHISTORY OF US GOVT HUMAN\n\nEXPERIMENTATION:\n\nIn order to understand the current state sponsored human experimentation, it is\n\nnecessary to begin with previous programs that began in the early 1900’s, and\n\ncontinued to the present day.\n\nEUGENICS MOVEMENT\n\nEugenics originated in England with the work of Francis Galton who studied hereditary\n\ntraits in families and began the nature versus nurture debate and its ultimate focus on\n\ntwins to answer the question of what was more powerful heredity or environment. He\n\nproposed positive Eugenics, encouraging the reproduction of eminent men and families.\n\nHe cautioned against drawing premature and harmful conclusions from his work, but like\n\nhis cousin, Charles Darwin, his work was used as justification for some of the greatest\n\ncrimes in history. Negative Eugenics is the application of means to discourage the\n\nbreeding of the―unfit‖, including anti-race mixing marriage laws, segregation\n\n(institutionalization), sterilization, and euthanasia. Eugenics is not a true science and\n\nthough it is dressed up in mathematics to give it legitimacy it has more in common with\n\nthe quack science of Phrenology. Phrenology was the study of the head size and shape to\n\ndetermine intelligence and character.\n\nThe industrial age had thrown millions of people off the farm and into the city to work in low paying factory jobs. The sheer scale of the problems of mental illness, alcoholism\n\nand crime seemed overwhelming. Added to this, millions of Eastern Europeans and\n\nItalians came to America and made native the population uneasy. They were viewed as\n\nbad stock compared to the more―Nordic types‖ that made up earlier waves of\n\nimmigration from Western Europe. Suggestions for solving these problems took the form of segregation, sterilization, and mass euthanasia, however the Eugenics movement leaders were smart enough to realize that America was not prepared for euthanasia. The Eugenics movement took shape in America with the founding of the Eugenics Recording Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1910 by Charles Davenport with money from the Carnegie Institution. The ERO compiled millions of files on ordinary Americans.\n\nThe adherents of Eugenics included some of the most influential doctors and scientists of\n\nthe era, including Alexander Graham Bell, Luther Burbank, W.M. Kellogg, David Starr\n\nJordan, the President of Stanford University, William Welch of Johns Hopkins University. Professors at Harvard, Columbia, Yale, and other universities taught 375 courses on Eugenics. The hypothesis that mental illness, crime, and poverty were inherited factors and could be cured through negative Eugenics had by the 1920‘s been accepted by American Society as fact. Contests for Fitter family were common at state fairs and Eugenics publications and ideas were widespread.\n\nThis could not have been possible without the hard work of many eminent men and the application of large amounts of money.\n\nThe great fortunes of The Carnegie Institution, The Rockefeller Foundation, Harriman family, Ford foundation, Milbank Memorial Fund, and others funded the ERO, The American Eugenics Society, The American Eugenics Party and others. The American\n\nEugenics movement actively encouraged foreign countries to participate, concentrating most heavily on Germany. The opening address of the Second International Congress of Eugenics in 1921 was repeated in German. Only 3,000 people had been forcibly sterilized by the time the famous case of Buck vs. Bell reached the Supreme Court. Carrie Buck was a 17 year old girl who became\n\npregnant out of wedlock in 1920‘s Virginia. She was ostracized by her community and\n\nher baby Vivian Buck, was reported to the ERO as appearing not normal. Carrie and her\n\nmother‘s files were examined, both had previously been classified as MORONS and\n\ncourt proceedings were begun to have Carrie forcibly sterilized without examination.\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes delivered the verdict of the court in 1927. “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.\n\nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann. Cas. 765. Three generations of imbeciles are enough”.\n\nThis decision validated Virginia‘s Eugenical Sterilization Act and set in motion the\n\nforced sterilization of 30-60k American citizens. Eventually similar laws were passed in 34 other states. Carrie Buck was not a promiscuous and disruptive moronic slut as she had been portrayed at trial by the testimony of her school superintendent.\n\nShe had been raped by her foster family‘s son. She had been on the honor roll. Her forcible\n\nsterilization was a result of lies, incorrect diagnosis, and a plot to pass the Virginia Law.\n\nA review of the case uncovered a conspiracy between Carrie‘s defense lawyer and the\n\nColony of Virginia to ensure the constitutionality of Virginia‘s new law.\n\nThe state was trying to save money by sterilizing the growing population at its mental health facilities. The greatest impact of Buck vs. Bell was in Germany. In 1933 the Nazi government adopted the Prevention of Hereditarily Ill Offspring Act which was based on Buck vs. Bell and led to the forced sterilization of 375,000 people and the banning of marriage and sexual relations between Germans and Jews. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the Eugenicists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute including the work of Ernst Rudin, a leading psychiatrist who became an architect and prime director of the murderous medical experimentation programs conducted on thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and others. American money also endowed the work of Otmar Freiherr von Verchuer who headed the Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics. He wrote in his Eugenics Journal that ―Germany‘s war would yield a total solution to the Jewish Problem.‖ Verschuer had a longtime assistant. His name was Josef Mengele. On May 30, 1943, Mengele arrived at Auschwitz. Verschuer notified the German Research Society, “My assistant, Dr. Josef Mengele (M.D., Ph.D.) joined me in this branch of research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmführer (captain) and camp physician in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Anthropological testing of the most diverse racial groups in this concentration camp is being carried out with permission of the SS Reichsführer (Himmler).” Mengele began searching the boxcar arrivals for twins. When he found them, he performed beastly experiments, scrupulously wrote up the reports and sent the paperwork back to Verschuer’s institute for evaluation. Often, cadavers, eyes and other body parts were also dispatched to Berlin’s eugenic institutes. Several doctors who had been sent to Auschwitz for aiding Jews were forced to work as his assistants and described him thus…His experiments and observations were carried out in an abnormal fashion. When he made transfusions he purposely used incorrect blood types. He would inject substances and then ignore the results. He did what he pleased and conducted his experiments like a mad amateur. He was not a savant. He had the mania of a collector. He was also fascinated with gypsies and dwarfs as human specimens. His experiments, lacking scientific value, were no more than foolish playing and all his activities were full of contradiction.\n\nIn other words, he was a hack with an MD and a Ph.D. in Eugenics, a quack science.\n\n―The toll of Eugenics Laws would fall heavily on non-Jewish Germans as well. The\n\nchronology of events is instructive. First patients in German mental facilities were\n\nsterilized, then it was decided to gas them. CO gas was used in the beginning but was\n\ndiscarded in favor of Zyklon B gas for reasons of economy and effectiveness. Next all the residents of the old age homes in Germany were either starved, given lethal injection,\n\nor gassed and then cremated. Finally German citizens who had physical disabilities, many quite mild or correctable, were euthanized. Between 50,000 and 100,000 were eventually killed.\n\nThe program was referred to as a mercy death however nothing could be farther from the\n\ntruth. Witnesses said that the floor, walls, and even ceiling of the gas chamber were stained with blood, vomit, urine and feces. At the center of the room would be an enormous pile of bodies in the general shape of a pyramid as people struggled to climb on top of each other to reach the last remaining breathable air near the ceiling.\n\nAmerican Eugenics movement leaders went underground and changed the name of their\n\norganizations. The lifelong friendships between people like Verschuer and the leading members of the American Eugenics Movement continued even after the Holocaust. He and many others were never punished and remained influential men in society. Their portraits hang in many major universities, both in Germany and America. The names of their victims are mostly lost to history. They included the powerless, people who couldn‘t fight back. Carrie Buck‘s daughter died at the age of 8 years old due to an illness. In her short school career she had made the honor roll.\n\nHUMAN RADIATION STUDIES:\n\nIn December 1939 as Europe was poised on the brink of war, two German radiochemists\n\nsplit the uranium atom in their Berlin laboratory. They confided the results to Lise\n\nMeitner and Otto Fritsch who calculated the released energy at 200 million electron volts\n\nfor one atom. The significance of the event was understood immediately in scientific\n\ncommunities in all nations. Virtually unlimited energy could be produced in a controlled reaction and an uncontrolled reaction would yield an explosive of incredible power. The University of California at Berkeley was where plutonium 238 half life 86 years and plutonium 239 half life 24,000 years were first created. Seaborg, Segre and McMillan used cyclotrons to produce one microgram of plutonium. After months of work their product could be detected but was too small to be seen. Plutonium was described as a crazy metal, small amounts spontaneously combust in air so it must be handled in an environment free of oxygen. Depending on the chemical form it might be blue, green, purple, yellow, red, brown or pink. Seaborg said ―under some conditions it might be brittle like glass or soft like lead. It will disintegrate at room temperature, undergoing five phase changes between room temperature and the melting point. It is fiendishly toxic, even in small amounts.‖ Robley Evans who studied women exposed on the job to radium wrote that as little two micrograms, two millionths of a gram, was fatal. Ernest Lawrence told government officials that plutonium 239 ―could be used to make a super bomb.‖ It was 1941 and the United States would be in the war in a matter of months. Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, and Arthur Compton were instrumental in persuading FDR to study the feasibility of building a nuclear bomb. The Manhattan Project was the secret effort to build the atomic bomb. It was a gamble that represented several billion dollars and a significant percentage of the war time budget. The Oak Ridge plant in Tennessee\n\nwas 56,000 acres devoted to making uranium-235 and the Hanford Washington site made plutonium. These facilities had taken the bench scale process and increased it a billion fold. General Leslie Groves was tapped to head the massive project. He appointed Robert Oppenheimer to be in charge of the design, construction, and testing of the weapon. Los Alamos, New Mexico was chosen as the site of the facility to build and test such a weapon. Quantum Physics was a science that had been invented by twenty year olds and the staff Oppenheimer assembled for the Manhattan Project reflected that. The bomb might not work and if the high explosive failed to ignite the fission reaction $2.5 billion dollars\n\n(1945) worth of plutonium would be scattered across the Jimenez Mountains. Jumbo was the largest fabricated object ever built, designed to contain the plutonium if ignition failed. At dawn on July 16, 1945 the Trinity site witnessed the detonation of the device code named Gadget. The remaining two devices, named Little Boy and Fat Man, were\n\nused on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9th killing approximately 200,000\n\npeople. WWII terror bombing of civilians began with the London Blitz killing 30,000\n\npeople and culminated in the firebombing of Dresden Germany and Tokyo. Napalm was\n\nused in 1,000 plane raids that incinerated approximately 200,000 people. The atomic\n\nbomb did not add to the scale of mass murder of civilian populations, but it certainly made it more efficient. Many of the scientists were appalled at the result, some had urged a demonstration shot. The scientists declared publicly that the U.S. possessed only a few\n\nyears head start before another nation followed suit. Many of the scientists and some generals advocated international control and the eventual banning of nuclear weapons.\n\nThose that tried to head off a nuclear arms race in the end failed as events and\n\npersonalities took on a momentum of their own. Edward Teller advocated the super-\n\nheavy, the Hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer objected to the development of the Hydrogen\n\nbomb and stated that these were genocidal weapons. He was promptly replaced. Teller\n\nassumed the scientific leadership of the weapons program and remained influential for the entire Cold War. The largest Hydrogen bomb ever tested by the U.S. was around 40\n\nmegatons, 4,000 times more powerful than the 10 kiloton Hiroshima bomb. The nuclear\n\narms race that followed has resulted in the doctrine of MAD, mutually assured destruction. If either the US or USSR launch any or all of their half of the 20,000 nuclear\n\nweapons they have aimed at each other, then they can rest assured that they too would be\n\ncompletely destroyed in a retaliatory strike. The nuclear arms race consumed much of\n\nthe wealth of the US leaving the civilian population living in very real fear that the world could end in a matter of minutes.\n\nNuclear testing began in the Pacific and the continental US. Residents of the Marshall\n\nIslands were forcibly relocated and dozens of devices were tested there, some so enormous they obliterated large parts of the islands. Captured and obsolete ships were placed in the blast zone with test animals on board. After the detonations thousands of observers and military moved near ground zero to decontaminate equipment. The military brass wanted to know how equipment and men would fare in a nuclear war. At what point are the ships too hot or the men too poisoned to continue to fight. The Air Force sent planes into radioactive clouds that registered 800 rad per hour or higher adopting lead helmets and special shielding in an effort to protect the pilots. The Army placed troops in trenches 1,000 yards from the blast and immediately after the explosion walked them on line through ground zero in an effort to prepare them psychologically for fighting with nuclear weapons. General James Cooney was the foremost advocate of testing and took authority away from the AEC Atomic Energy Commission for the responsibility of setting exposure limits on troops. Scientists were allowed exposure of no more than 3 rad for a 13 week period while limits for military personnel were officially set at 5 rad per test. The badges given to troops to wear measured only external beta radiation and were not used extensively. The scientists working for the AEC wore protective gear while the troops\n\ndid not. The health effects of radiation were fairly well known to the scientists involved\n\ndue to their animal studies, industrial accidents, and the very public deaths of Madame Curie and others. By the 1920‘s it was known that hundreds of the early pioneers in radiation studies were dead.\n\nA single dose of 350 rad was the human LD-50, the dose that caused death to half those exposed. One millionth of a gram, once inside the human body could cause death.\n\nA nuclear explosion immediately produces Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and X-ray radiation. Hundreds of different radioactive isotopic particles are formed as residual contamination that is absorbed into different body tissues with varying degrees of longevity and toxicity. One example is radioiodine that collects in the thyroid. This kaleidoscope of sources make it difficult to gage what dose has been delivered and to what effect. Inhalation of a small particle of plutonium would collect in the bone marrow and emit energies on the order of 200 million electron volts. The normal energy level of the human cell is 10 electron volts, and under such an assault the cell either dies, becomes inoperable, or grows uncontrollably, in other words, cancer. Arthur Compton and the other physicist knew what had happened to the earlier experimenters with radioactive materials. Compton chose Robert Stone in Berkeley and Joseph Hamilton at Chicago to research the biological aspects. The scientists who conducted these experiments were not from the inner sanctum trying to build the Bomb, years 1951 and 1974 studying about 500 patients. The TBI experiments were only a subset of the radiation experiments on human subjects that included plutonium injections,\n\nradioactive isotope studies, and many others.\n\nVanderbilt University Hospital Prenatal Clinic hosted 850 pregnant women to a secret\n\nstudy using radioactive isotopes iron-55 and iron-59. The pregnant women were given a\n\ncocktail and told it was vitamins for their unborn child. Free health care was the lure\n\nused on the economically disadvantaged women. Helen Hutchison was 6 months\n\npregnant and visited the clinic in July, 1946 seeking treatment for nausea. She was given\n\na cocktail by the doctor and told to drink it, that it would make her feel better. Several\n\nmonths after the birth of her daughter her hair fell out and she developed blisters, anemia, and later had life threatening complications after several miscarriages.\n\nHer daughter Barbara was always tired as a child, developed an immune system disorder and skin cancer. Many of the mothers and children exposed to radioactive iron developed strange afflictions, rashes, anemia, blood disorders, and cancer. Paul Hahn, the principle investigator in the study, was a protégé of Stafford Warren and had worked with Robly Evans. Hahn wrote that iron-55 with a half life of 5 years was too hazardous to be given to humans and had no therapeutic value, yet he used it in this study which was partially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Helen Hutchison‘s husband had landed in Europe on D-Day, and had personally helped liberate Buchenwald concentration camp. The Nazi doctors who worked in the camp may have been some of the very men who participated in the radiation experiment on his wife and unborn child. One study conducted at the Fernald State School in Waltham, Massachusetts used\n\nradioactive iron and calcium secretly given to 74 orphans in their oatmeal using the ruse of a nutrition study. Robley Evans produced the radioactive isotopes in the MIT cyclotron and supervised the experiment. The lure used by the MIT scientists was membership in a\n\nscience club that went on school outings to baseball games and even Christmas parties at the MIT faculty club. The scientists may not have believed that the amount of radiation involved was harmful, but they would not have allowed this experiment to be conducted on their own families.\n\nAt Washington State Penitentiary and Oregon State Prison about 200 prisoners had their testicles irradiated with 8 to 600 rads with the lure of a little money and extra privileges.\n\nCarl Heller, one of the world‘s leading endocrinologists, and his protégé C. Alvin Paulsen ran the two studies from 1963 until 1971. These and similar experiments on thousands of people continued for 30 years in the vain search for a biological dosimeter. The identities and ultimate fates of the test subjects will never be known, most going to their graves never knowing they had been used as human guinea pigs by their government. Elmer Allen was designated experimental test subject CAL-13. On July 18, 1947 in a San Francisco Hospital he was injected with plutonium in the left leg. Three days later the leg was amputated at mid thigh. Elmer was a porter for the Pullman Company who injured his leg while stepping off a train. He was diagnosed with a fracture that developed into a cyst. The first test for cancer was negative, a second test indicated\n\ncancer. Unable to work after the amputation, he was forced to return to Italy, Texas with\n\nhis wife and three children. His wife recalled that he began having epileptic seizures, ―he\n\nwould chew the spoon to pieces, his tongue too‖. Elmer began drinking heavily and told\n\nhis best friend that he had been used as a guinea pig, but no one not even his family\n\ndoctor believed him. The doctor later diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nDuring an effort to collect the bodies of the people injected with plutonium it was\n\ndiscovered to their amazement that 4 of them were still alive. In 1973 Austin Bues, from\n\nthe Center for Human Radiobiology wrote to Elmer and asked him to be in a metabolism\n\nstudy. He and his wife were brought to Chicago and Elmer‘s urine and feces were\n\ncollected for two weeks. The trip was paid for and Elmer received $140 plus $13 a day\n\nexpenses. X-rays revealed bone damage consisted with radiation. One year after Elmer‘s death the family was contacted by a reporter and learned that Elmer had been a human experimental subject and the family had been lied to for 44 years. Elmer Allen died in 1991, his head stone reads Elmer Allen 1911-1947 CAL-13 1947- 1991 One of America‘s nuclear guinea pigs. On 7 December 1993, Secretary of Energy Hazel O‘Leary ordered her department to open classified files covering projects that had involved the use of human beings as guinea pigs since WWII. A major project was initiated to identify relevant documents. The index itself runs to 150 pages. The following is testimony from Elmer Allen‘s granddaughter before the President‘s Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, March, 1995.\n\nMONARCH: THE NEW PHOENIX PROGRAM\n\nBy Marshall Thomas\n\nONE:\n\nPhoenix Program\n"
