Almost a year earlier, on November 9th, 1961, Connie recorded an Italian only version. The French version, PERSONNE AU MONDE, had been cut one week before on November 2, 1961.\n\nA6: L'HIVER SERA LONG POUR MOI SANS TOI remained, until the above release, the only foreign language version of BLUE WINTER awaiting release. All other versions had been recorded and released in 1964.\n\nB3: IL MIO AMORE E COSI was recorded in 1966, presumably in October but unconfirmed. An Italian only interpretation of ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD, it has an entirely different production and arrangement to the English version. The song is a French original titled ET SI C'ETAIT VRAI, but has not been recorded by Connie in that language.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------B2: THIS IS MY SONG [CARA FELICITA] the 'live' 1970 Romanian concert track first featured on LAURIE HOUSE LH-8019 CONNIE ITALIANO, was leased to PolyGram for this recording.
