        "text": "Anyone who reads this blog knows I’m partial to vocalists, and, partial to Connie Francis.\n\nConnie is perhaps the greatest of the non-writing female singers. And much like her male counterparts, Elvis and Frank Sinatra, she is a wonderful interpreter of songs.\n\nMuch like Elvis and Sinatra she, also, tackled (almost) anything and everything and could always make it sound like Connie.\n\nCheck out my other comments for detail on her and an idea of her musical voice.\n\nConnie’s big hit making period was the late 1950s – early 1960s. Her last Top 40 had been ‘Be Anything (But Be Mine)” (#25 US Pop 1964).\n\nShe was still a concert draw, popular with the “older crowd”, on television a lot, popular internationally, and had respectable (though non-charting) album sales.\n\nBacharach and David had many hits in the 60s, especially with their favourite vocalist Dionne Warwick and appealed (especially) to the “older crowd”.\n\nIt was inevitable that Connie would cover, and put out an album of Bacharach and David (though the album could equally be called “Covers Dionne Warwick and others”).\n\nConnie, apparently, had already begun to work on this project in April 1968 under the musical supervision of Teddy Randazzo, a former fellow high school student.\n\nRandazzo was a former (late 50s) rock n roller who had success in the mid-60s writing and producing songs for rock and trad pop acts, especially Little Anthony & the Imperials who had a big hit with his \"Goin' Out of My Head\" (#6 US Pop, 1965).\n\nFor whatever reason she was unsatisfied with Randazzo's working methods, and abandoned the project after recording only three songs, \"Lovin' is a Way of Livin'\" , \"Make it Easy on Yourself\", \"The Story of My Life\", which remained unreleased at the time.\n\nThe project was picked up again in October 1968 when she teamed up with German composer, arranger conductor, sometime writer and producer Claus Ogerman with whom she had collaborated previously during the recording of the songs for her movie “Looking for Love” in late 1963 and who arranged and conducted (and occasionally wrote) a number of songs for her from 1962 – 1965.\n\nHis arranging is sophisticated (and contemporary, for trad pop) as you would expect from someone who worked with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Bill Evans, Billie Holiday, Wes Montgomery, Kai Winding, Astrud Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Cal Tjader in the late 50s and 60s as well as doing big pop with Lesley Gore, Little Eva, Gene Pitney and others.\n\nWith his jazzy background, an ear for emotional pop and his skill with spun sugar he is a perfect choice for Connie.\n\nAnd, of course, with its mature sophistication Bacharach and David is perfect material for an almost 30 year old Connie.\n\nAs you would expect she sings the material in her own way. That is, she doesn’t, necessarily pay attention to any of the other hit versions.\n\nShe isn’t as spicy or sultry as Dionne but finds other meaning in the lyrics.\n\nDespite her fine voice, good jazzy arrangements of hit making songs the album and songs failed to put her back in the charts.\n\nThe reviewer at Allmusic says this about the album, “And while she's no Dionne or Dusty, Francis clearly grasps the substance of David's lyrics, investing readings of \"Make It Easy on Yourself,\" \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" and \"Walk on By\" with genuine poignancy. An unexpected delight”. https://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-bacharach-and-david-mw0001883726\n\nThe “delight” is correct … the “unexpected” isn’t. This material may have been written by Bacharach and David but she had dipped into the contemporary trad pop bag before. Likewise, Dionne Warwick may have poll position when it comes to Bacharach and David but, ultimately, Connie is a better singer. Dionne, never really successfully expanded beyond the template set by Bacharach and David. And, Connie leaves Dusty Springfield, for dead. She is more musically ambitious, and her palette wider than Dusty, though Dusty has the “icon” (and hipster tastemaker) tick of approval.\n\nConnie can be restrained and casual (as Bacharach and David songs require) but very few had the vocal power and precision she possessed. She could hit and hold the top notes that others avoided. It’s wonderful to hear her sing.\n\nFemale pop vocalists have become (in part) either, part of a multi tracked vocal chorus, post-Aretha Franklin blues tinged screechers, low key throaty singer-songwriters, ironic speakers, or thin sounding vocalists wrapped around a dance beat.\n\nSure there are others but few sing, and can sing, for the sheer enjoyment of it.\n\nConnie does.\n\nof these songs but Connie certainly puts her own personality into the songs and refuses to slavishly follow….\n\nThere are many supporters for Connie but her light should shine a lot brighter when compared to other singers of the 60s.\n\nAll songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.\n\nTracks (best in italics)\n\nSide one\n\nWhat the World Needs Now – First recorded and made popular by Jackie DeShannon (#7 US Pop, #1 Canada 1965). It has been often covered. Connie has slowed it right down and drawn all \"love\" out of the lyric. A great version, and, still, sadly, relevant, fifty years later.\n\nPromises, Promises – The title song to the 1968 musical of the same name, based on the 1960 film \"The Apartment\". Dionne Warwick (first) recorded and released it in 1968 (#19 US Pop). This is a big production number and quite \"stagey\" on the ear, if that is possible.\n\nThe Look of Love – First recorded by Stan Getz as an instrumental (1966). The song, with lyrics, was originally recorded by Dusty Springfield for the Casino Royale (1967) film (#22 US Pop, 1967). The song has been done by everyone. A great song, a great version, again slowed, but ever so slightly, which accentuates the interplay between lyric and music.\n\nDo You Know The Way To San Jose? – First done by Dionne Warwick who had a hit with it in 1968 (#10 US Pop, #8 UK, #15 Australia). Wonderful with some great keyboard.\n\nTrains and Boats and Planes – First recorded by Bacharach in 1965 (#4 UK). Hit versions followed by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (#12 UK 1965, #47 US Pop 1965), and by Dionne Warwick (#22 US Pop, 1966). Quite beautiful with the right touch of melancholic apprehensive fear.\n\nMake It Easy On Yourself – First a hit for Jerry Butler in 1962 (#20 US Pop, #18 US R&B 1962) and then the Walker Brothers had an even bigger hit with it (#16 US Pop, #1 UK 1965, #1 Canada 1965, #3 Ireland 1965). A gentle samba beat and Connie's emotive vocal over a number of notes make this a winner. One of the great versions of this song.\n\nSide Two\n\nAlfie – The song was a major hit for Cilla Black (#9 UK, #22 Australia, #20 New Zealand, #95 US Pop all 1966), Cher (#32 US Pop 1966), and Dionne Warwick (#15 US Pop, #10 Canada 1967). It has been done often. This is another good version though i can't disassociate it from Michael Caine and its Englishness (despite it being written by Americans).\n\nMedley: This Girl's In Love with You / I Say a Little Prayer – “This Guy’s in Love with You” (its original gender) was first recorded by Herb Alpert who had a hit with it (#1 US Pop, #1 Australia, #1 Canada, #3 UK 1968). The first female version came out the same year from Bacharach-David favourite Dionne Warwick (#9 US Pop, #17 Australia, #7 Canada all 1968). It also charted another two times in the US in 1968 (Tony Mottola #22 US Billboard Adult Contemporary, Eydie Gorme #22 US Billboard Adult Contemporary). It has been often recorded. “I Say a Little Prayer\" was first recorded and released by Dionne Warwick (#4 US Pop, #8 US R&B 1968) before being released by Aretha Franklin (#10 US Pop, #3 US R&B, #4 UK, #8 Australia). I don't know if this song (or the other medley) was intended as a medley or if they just spliced two songs together to keep the record in the right running time area. Either way, it works, the songs are wonderful and the medley seamless … but I would have liked to have heard them on their own.\n\nWanting Things – originally recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1968. Well sung.\n\nWalk on By – First recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1964 (#6 US Pop, #9 UK). Wow, Connie sings this beautifully with emotional links to the teen drama songs she sang in the early 60s, though now, her narrator, is a young adult.\n\nMedley: Blue On Blue / Magic Moments – “Blue on Blue’ was first recorded by Bobby Vinton in 1963 (#3 US Pop, #4 Canada, #7 Australia, #1 Israel). \"Magic Moments\" was one of the first songs written by Bacharach and David. Perry Como had a hit with it in 1958 (#4 US Pop, #1 UK). Another seamless medley with full orchestration, with most of the bells and whistles of 1968.\n\nDon't Make Me Over – originally recorded by Dionne Warwick in August 1962 (#21 US pop, #5 US R&B 1962). Nice, gentle.\n\nSong antecedents:\n\nWhat the World Needs Now\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_World_Needs_Now_Is_Love\n\nPromises, Promises\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promises,_Promises_(musical)\n\nThe Look of Love\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Look_of_Love_(1967_song)\n\nDo You Know The Way To San Jose?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Know_the_Way_to_San_Jose\n\nTrains and Boats and Planes\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trains_and_Boats_and_Planes\n\nMake It Easy On Yourself\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_It_Easy_on_Yourself\n\nAlfie\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfie_(Burt_Bacharach_song)\n\nMedley: This Girl's In Love with You / I Say a Little Prayer\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Guy%27s_in_Love_with_You\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Say_a_Little_Prayer\n\nWanting Things\n\n—\n\nWalk on By\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_On_By_(song)\n\nMedley: Blue On Blue / Magic Moments\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_on_Blue_(song)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Moments\n\nDon't Make Me Over\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Over_(song)\n\nAnd …\n\nThere may be some better versions but everything here is good and distinctive.
