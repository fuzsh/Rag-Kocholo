        "text": "Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday\n\nA Monday, a Monday is very, very good\n\nOr you can kiss me on a Tuesday\n\nA Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would\n\nOr you can kiss me on a Wednesday\n\nA Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best\n\nBut never, never on a Sunday\n\nA Sunday, a Sunday, â€²cause that's my day of rest\n\nMost any day you can be my guest\n\nAny day you say, but my day of rest\n\nJust name the day that you like the best\n\nOnly stay away on my day of rest\n\nOh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day\n\nA wet day, which everyone you choose\n\nOr try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day\n\nA pay day, and see if I refuse\n\nAnd if you make it on a bleak day\n\nA freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest\n\nBut never, never on a Sunday\n\nWriter(s): BILLY TOWNE, MANOS HADJIDAKIS<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
