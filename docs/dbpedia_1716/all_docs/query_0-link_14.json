It was performed in the film by Catherine Deneuve, whose voice was dubbed by Danielle Licari. The English lyrics of the song were written by Norman Gimbel. This version was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song at the 38th Academy Awards held in 1966. In July of the same year, Connie Francis released an English-language cover of the song on her album Movie Greats of the 60s.[2] The cover by Connie Francis was prominently featured in a 2002 episode of the American television series Futurama titled Jurassic Bark.[3] In 1967, Cher also released a cover of this song on her album \"With Love, Ch√©r\".[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
