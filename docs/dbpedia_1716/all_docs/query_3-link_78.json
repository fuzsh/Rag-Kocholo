        "text": "Angélina has been revealed as the artist who will represent France on their return to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest after 15 years away.\n\nThe singer will be performing the bilingual song “Jamais sans toi” (Never without you). She was internally selected to represent France at the competition, having been named the winner of The Voice Kids in France last year. Angélina is 10 years old and will be the first female singer to represent France at Junior Eurovision.\n\nThere had been speculation for a number of weeks regarding whether Angélina would be the French representative in the competition. The singer and her song are to be officially revealed as the French entrant for the competition tomorrow.\n\nMadame Monsieur who represented France at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, will also be taking to the commentary booth this November. The duo will be joining Stéphane Bern as commentators as France returns to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in fifteen years. France previously only participated in the contest once in 2004 when Thomas Pontier finished 6th in Lillehammar.\n\nSource: JuniorEurovision.tv"
