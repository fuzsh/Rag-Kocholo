        "text": "Sunrise and mist whisper through my window\n\nThe world has changed\n\nSome things we remember\n\nOthers they′re gonna treat us strange\n\nThere's a crow circling high\n\nThree hawks are peckin′ in the park\n\nAll the babies stop their cryin'\n\nThere was none laughing at the morning star\n\nWe'll wait ′til tomorrow\n\nRubbin′ our eyes\n\nSee that wasn't a dream\n\nAs time goes by get used to the news\n\nSomewhere in between\n\nThe familiar just isn′t\n\nEven all the moons in the sky\n\nSunburned at Christmas\n\nSnowing at the edge of July\n\nClosing our eyes remember the places\n\nOh, the places we've been\n\nLike old-timey memories\n\nWe can watch over and over again\n\nThat′s where we can go to see each other again\n\nI'll meet you there you can find me my friend\n\nSee you there find me find me\n\nI′ll meet you there my old friend\n\nWriter(s): David A. Schools, Domingo S. Ortiz, Todd A. Nance, John Robert Hermann, John F. Bell, Jimmy Eddie Herring Jr., Duane Trucks<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
