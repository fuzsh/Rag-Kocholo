        "text": "Posted on November 23, 2016 by Ulrike Rettig\n\n\"El Perdón\" – Learning Spanish With a Song\n\nListening to Spanish songs, first with the lyrics, and then without, is a great way to absorb words, phrases, and even grammatical structures.\n\nIn one of our first posts on learning a foreign language with a song, we chose La Paloma, a song which originated in 1861 in Cuba.\n\nNow listen to a much more recent song, \"El Perdón,\" co-written and co-performed by Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias, both popular singers in the Latin pop scene.\n\n\"El Perdón\" became a smash hit upon its release in 2015. The official Spanish YouTube video has had over 650 million views at this time.\n\nThe Creators\n\nNicky Jam (Nick Rivera Caminero) was born in Boston MA, USA in 1981, but moved to Puerto Rico at the age of ten. For the Wiki-bio in Spanish click HERE.\n\nEnrique Iglesias (Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler) was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1975. At age 11, he was sent to live Miami for security reasons. (His grandfather had been kidnapped by the Basque ETA.) See his English Wiki-bio HERE.\n\nYou can of course listen to a song in a foreign language and never get the lyrics. That's fine. Music can be enjoyed on its own.\n\nBut songs can also be a great language learning tool if you pay attention to the lyrics to understand their meaning. So, what makes music such a powerful way of getting language into your brain? It's because songs combine melody, rhythm, and emotion with language. What's on your side is the \"earworm\" effect. A good song will continue playing in your head.\n\nListening to songs in a language you're learning:\n\n• Improves your pronunciation\n\n• Has you mimic intonation\n\n• Helps you memorize vocabulary\n\n• Familiarizes you with idiomatic phrases\n\n• Lets you absorb grammar structures\n\n• Gets you into the rhythm of the language\n\nThe Lyrics\n\nListen to the song again and now follow it by reading the lyrics below. How much can you understand? At the end of the post we have the English translation, so you can check.\n\nEl Perdón\n\nDime si es verdad\n\nMe dijeron que te estas casando\n\nTú no sabes como estoy sufriendo\n\nEsto te lo tengo que decir\n\nCuéntame\n\nTu despedida para mi fue dura\n\nSerá que él te llevo a la luna\n\nY yo no supe hacerlo así\n\nTe estaba buscando\n\nPor las calles gritando\n\nEso me está matando oh no\n\nTe estaba buscando\n\nPor las calles gritando\n\nComo un loco tomando\n\nEs que yo sin ti\n\nY tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nEs que yo sin ti\n\nY tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nVivir si ti, no aguanto más\n\nPor eso vengo a decirte lo que siento\n\nEstoy sufriendo en esta soledad\n\nY aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación\n\nYo sigo insistiendo a pedir perdón\n\nLo único que importa está en tu corazón\n\nTe estaba buscando\n\nPor las calles gritando\n\nEsto me está matando oh no\n\nTe estaba buscando\n\nPor las calles gritando\n\nComo un loco tomando oh\n\nEs que yo sin ti, y tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nEsto no me gusta\n\nEs que yo sin ti, y tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEso no me gusta\n\nEso no me gusta\n\nYo te juré a ti eterno amor\n\nY ahora otro te da calor\n\nCuando en las noches tienes frío oh oh, oh\n\nYo sé que él te parece mejor\n\nPero yo estoy en tu corazón\n\nY por eso pido perdón\n\nEs que yo sin ti, y tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEsto no me gusta, oh no\n\nEs que yo sin ti, y tú sin mi\n\nDime quién puede ser feliz\n\nEsto no me gusta oh yeah, oh\n\nDicen que uno no sabe lo que tiene hasta que lo pierde pero\n\n(Yo sin ti) Vale la pena luchar por lo que uno quiere\n\n(No puedo vivir así) Y hacer el intento\n\n(No quiero vivir así)\n\nRefreshing a Few Grammar Points\n\n1. Gerundio - the progressive form of a verb describing an ongoing action\n\n• te estas casando - you are marrying (inf. casar)\n\n• estoy sufriendo - I am suffering (inf. sufrir)\n\n• estaba buscando - I was looking for (inf. buscar)\n\n• me está matando - it's killing me (inf. matar)\n\n• sigo insistiendo - I keep on insisting (inf. insistir)\n\n2. Adding object pronouns to imperative and infinitive forms\n\n• dime - tell me (imperative form of \"decir\")\n\n• cuéntame - tell me (imperative form of \"contar\")\n\n• hacerlo - to do it (infinitive)\n\n• decirte - to tell you (infinitive)\n\n3. Preterito - simple past form of verbs\n\n• fue - it was (inf. ser)\n\n• supe - I knew (inf. saber)\n\n• aprobó - he approved (inf. aprobar)\n\n• juré - I swore (inf. jurar)\n\nVoices and Dialects\n\nAnother benefit of using songs is that different singers expose you to different voices, accents, or regional pronunciations. Spanish, especially, has many regional dialects. Interesting reference: 10 Spanish Dialects: How Spanish is Spoken Around the World\n\nWhy would it be important to hear different voices, accents, and dialects in the language you're learning?\n\nThink about it: You're probably never going to speak only with people who sound exactly like the person on in your language program.\n\nBoth Enrique Iglesias and Nicky Jam are bilingual, with Spanish first and English learned at the age of 10 or 11. Comparing Enrique's and Nicky's Spanish, you'll notice some differences in pronunciation.\n\nThe Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is part of \"Caribbean Spanish,\" which also includes the Spanish of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and regions along the East coast of Mexico and Central America.\n\nThese are popular destinations both for Americans and many Europeans. Caribbean Spanish \"is characterized by elided middle consonants and omitted final consonants, as well as an aspirated ‘r’ that is pronounced like the Portuguese ‘x.’.\" [10 Spanish Dialects: How Spanish is Spoken Around the World] You'll definitely hear some of that in Nicky Jam's singing.\n\nEnglish Translation of “El Perdón” - Forgiveness\n\nTell me if it's true\n\nThey told me you are marrying\n\nYou don't know how I'm suffering\n\nThis I have to tell you\n\nTell me\n\nYour goodbye was hard for me\n\nIs it that he takes you to the moon\n\nAnd I didn't know how to do it like that\n\nI was looking for you\n\nCrying out in the streets\n\nThis is killing me oh no\n\nI was looking for you\n\nCrying out in the streets\n\nLike a crazy drunk\n\nIt's just that me without you\n\nAnd you without me\n\nTell me who can be happy\n\nI do not like this\n\nI do not like this\n\nIt's just that me without you\n\nAnd you without me\n\nTell me who can be happy\n\nI do not like that\n\nI do not like that\n\nLiving without you, I can't do it anymore\n\nSo I came to tell you how I feel\n\nI'm suffering in the loneliness\n\nAnd even though your dad didn't approve of this relationship\n\nI'll have to keep asking for forgiveness\n\nAll that matters to me is in your heart\n\nI was looking for you\n\nCrying out in the streets\n\nThis is killing me oh no\n\nI was looking for you\n\nCrying out in the streets\n\nLike a crazy drunk oh\n\nIt's just that me without you\n\nAnd you without me\n\nTell me, who can be happy\n\nI don't like that\n\nI don't like that\n\nI promised you eternal love\n\nAnd now another man gives you warmth\n\nwhen you're cold at night oh oh\n\nI know he seems better to you\n\nBut I'm in your heart\n\nSo I'm asking for forgiveness\n\nIt's just that me without you\n\nAnd you without me\n\nTell me, who can be happy\n\nI don't like this oh yeah...\n\n(You without me)\n\nThey say you don't know what you have until it's gone but...\n\n(Me without you) It's worth it to fight for what you love\n\n(I can't live like this) And make an effort\n\n(I don't want to live like this)\n\nIf you like learning and practicing Spanish with songs, we'd suggest that you try out for FREE Language Zen, a great Spanish language learning site, which uses Spanish songs and their lyrics as part of their program. You won't find \"La Paloma\" and \"El Perdón,\" but many contemporary songs on Language Zen. Also read our post \"Language Zen\" - Learning Spanish - A Review.\n\nBio: Ulrike Rettig is the co-founder of GamesforLanguage.com. She is a life-long language learner, growing up in Austria, the Netherlands and Canada. You can follow her on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and leave any comments with contact.\n\nDisclosure: Language Zen is a partner site with revenue sharing should you decide to subscribe.\n\nPosted on January 27, 2015 by Peter Rettig\n\nLa Paloma - Carmen - Cuba: Spanish language connections\n\nThe promising thaw, some time ago, in the relations between Cuba and the U.S. brought to mind that La Paloma, a song that over the years has been adapted and sung in so many languages, actually originated in Cuba.\n\nIn an earlier post, La Paloma Lyrics - Learning Spanish with a Song, we focused mainly on how you can learn some typical Spanish expressions by saying or singing the song's lyrics. In addition, we gave a brief summary of the song's history: Composed around 1860 by the Basque composer Sebastián Iradier after his visit to Havana.\n\nLa Paloma - A Song for the Ages\n\nWhen you google \"La Paloma song,\" you'll find a Wikipedia entry which tells you not only details about the song's motif (the dove), dating back to 492 BC; some of its history (a favorite of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico); early translations into French and German in the 1860's, with new lyrics in different languages, interpretations by famous artists; as well as the many movies in which a version of the song occurs.\n\nLa Paloma is arguably the most frequently played song and melody in the world. I've read that in Zanzibar it's being played at the end of weddings, in Romania at the end of funerals. In Germany it's a sailor's song, made famous by Hans Albers in his movie \"Grosse Freiheit #7\" in 1944.\n\nThe La Paloma - Carmen Connection\n\nWhen digging a little further, I discovered that there's a connection between Iradier's \"La Paloma\" and the \"Habanera\" aria in Bizet's Carmen: \"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle,\" which is said to be very close, melodically, to \"El Arreglito,\" another song composed by Sebastián Iradier. Both are \"habaneras,\" the name used outside of Cuba for the Cuban \"contradanza,\" a type of dance music that became popular in the 19th century.\n\nBizet originally thought El Arreglito was a folk song, only to discover that it had been written by Iradier who had died ten years earlier. Bizet then added a note to the vocal score of \"Carmen\" to acknowledge the source.\n\nCuban Music History and Future\n\nAnother Wiki entry further explains: \"The Cuban 'contradanza' (also called contradanza criolla, danza, danza criolla, or habanera) was a popular dance music genre of the 19th century. ... Its origins dated back to the European 'contredanse,' which was an internationally popular form of music and dance of the late 18th century.\n\nIt was brought to Santiago de Cuba by French colonists fleeing the Haitian Revolution in the 1790's ... During the first half of the 19th century, the 'contradanza' dominated the Cuban musical scene to such an extent that nearly all Cuban composers of the time, whether composing for the concert hall or the dance hall, tried their hands at the contradanza.\"\n\nIt's interesting that the language circle was completed when Iradier brought back the \"habaneras\" from his visit to Cuba, and when Bizet used \"El Arreglito\" for his French opera \"Carmen\". Many of the well-known dance styles such as rumba salsa, mambo, chachacha, reportedly began in Cuba.\n\nIn the coming years the rediscovery of Cuban artists, which began in the 90s with the popular \"Buena Vista Social Club\" album and Wim Wender's 1999 movie about the band, will very likely continue.\n\nAnd, if you're interested in the island's music and are maybe even considering a visit, the MyCubavisit.com website will give you some worthwhile information and insights.\n\nPostscript:\n\n(1) I recently came a across the post of a young Polyglot-in-the making. She suggests four simple steps for learning with songs to improve both your listening and speaking (maybe even singing!) skills.\n\n1. Listen! 2. Sing! 3. Translate. 4. Retranslate\n\nIt's fun AND effective and it works for all languages!\n\n(2) We recently discovered a Spanish language site, Language Zen, which uses Spanish songs a their lyrics as part of their program.

Every January, we'll publish our 10 most popular blogs of the previous year.\n\n2014 has been a wonderful year at GamesForLanguage, not just because we've grown our number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, but - as of December 2014 - our blog has gotten over 36,000 views.\n\nThanks for your interest and support! That's what fuels us - as well as the thousands of monthly visitors that come to our free language learning site.\n\nWe started GamesForLanguage 4 years ago as an experiment combining (fun) games and (serious) language learning for adults - and enlisted native speakers of French, Italian, and Spanish to our team.\n\nYes, language games are very popular with kids, but we've been delighted by the positive and constructive feedback that teens and adults have given us about our approach. We always want to hear from you, and we'll get back to you quickly.\n\nWe look forward to another great year. It'll include creating new courses and lots of new Quick Games.\n\nLast but not least, we're both going for a spurt to fluency in Spanish and for a fresh start with a new language - Swedish for Ulrike and Dutch for Peter. It's a good way to stay sharp and humble, language learning wise.\n\nHere are our 10 most popular blog posts of 2014:\n\nLa Paloma Lyrics – Learning Spanish With a Song\n\n5 Key Steps for Re-Learning a Language\n\nFluency vs. Proficiency in Foreign Language Learning\n\nThree (3) Ways to Better Engage in a German Conversation\n\n3 Steps for Training Your Ear When Learning a Language\n\nLearning French - Cézanne and Banking\n\n12 Social Media Terms When Learning Spanish\n\nSi tu n'existais pas – Learning French with a song\n\nThe “Context Approach” for Language Learning\n\nNot enough time?

Language Learning and Setting Priorities\" made it on the list, as it was only published on December 17, 2014. Apparently this post hit a nerve.\n\nThe La Paloma post has been a front runner since it was published in June 2013. Learning a language via well-known songs is clearly compelling. There are several other websites using this idea.\n\nWe recently published a post on French Social Media terms and are interested to see how it does this year. Social Media sites continue to be great places to practice and improve a language and being familiar with social media language is a good tool.\n\nWe welcome your comments and suggestions for new blog post topics! Wishing you an excellent and fun new language learning year!\n\nPosted on January 21, 2014 by Ulrike Rettig\n\nLearning French with a song: Si tu n'existais pas...\n\nYou may have heard this French song: Et si tu n'existais pas before and always wondered what the lyrics really meant. Here is your chance to learn them and brush up on your French negations and conditionals!\n\nFor anyone who likes music, songs are a versatile and surprisingly effective tool for language learning. Songs support your language learning in many ways. They help you to:\n\n• build your vocabulary and provide context for words and phrases\n\n• improve pronunciation\n\n• boost your memory\n\n• internalize grammar structures\n\n• distinguish word boundaries (see also our blog post Gibberish or language learning)\n\nSi tu n'existais pas (If you didn't exist)\n\nThis 1976 song by the American born, French singer-songwriter Joe Dassin has become hugely popular and is one of my favorites. Dassin (1938 - 1980) was a talented polyglot and recorded songs in Spanish, Russian, German, Greek, Italian, as well as in French and English (many of which you can find on YouTube).\n\nBelow are the French lyrics, and you can find another English translation here.\n\nThe Lyrics of \"Si tu n'existais pas\"\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nDis-moi pourquoi j'existerais.\n\nPour traîner dans un monde sans toi,\n\nSans espoir et sans regrets.\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nJ'essaierais d'inventer l'amour,\n\nComme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts\n\nNaître les couleurs du jour.\n\nEt qui n'en revient pas.\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nDis-moi pour qui j'existerais.\n\nDes passantes endormies dans mes bras\n\nQue je n'aimerais jamais.\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nJe ne serais qu'un point de plus\n\nDans ce monde qui vient et qui va,\n\nJe me sentirais perdu,\n\nJ'aurais besoin de toi.\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nDis-moi comment j'existerais.\n\nJe pourrais faire semblant d'être moi,\n\nMais je ne serais pas vrai.\n\nEt si tu n'existais pas,\n\nJe crois que je l'aurais trouvé,\n\nLe secret de la vie, le pourquoi,\n\nSimplement pour te créer\n\nEt pour te regarder.\n\nFrench Nouns in the Song\n\nIn Dassin's song there are 14 nouns, here listed in the form they appear:\n\n• un monde (a world)\n\n• sans espoir (without hope)\n\n• sans regrets (without regret)\n\n• l'amour (love)\n\n• un peintre (a painter)\n\n• ses doigts (his fingers)\n\n• les couleurs (the colors)\n\n• du jour (of the day)\n\n• des passantes (passers-by)\n\n• mes bras (my arms)\n\n• un point (a point, dot)\n\n• le secret (the secret)\n\n• de la vie (of life)\n\n• le pourquoi (the why)\n\nNegative Structures\n\nIt's well worth internalizing the various forms of French negation, three of which appear in the song:\n\n• Si tu n'existais pas (ne ... pas - not)\n\n• Que je n'aimerais jamais. (ne ... jamais - never)\n\n• Je ne serais qu'un point de plus. (ne ... que - only)\n\nThe Conditional \"if-then\" Structure\n\nThis structure is the backbone of the song. Of the 20 different verbs, 8 are used in the conditional tense. Memorizing the lyrics and singing them is a great way to internalize one of the common \"if-then\" (conditional) structures:\n\nThe \"if-clause\" (which comes up 6 times) is in the imperfect tense:\n\n• si tu n'existais pas - if you didn't exist\n\nThe \"then-claus\" is in the conditional tense:\n\n• dis-moi pourquoi j'existerais (*exister) - tell me why would I exist\n\n• j'essaierais d'inventer l'amour (*essayer) - I would try to invent love\n\n• je ne serais qu'un point de plus (*être) - I would only be one more dot\n\n• je me sentirais perdu (*se sentir) - I would feel lost\n\n• j'aurais besoin de toi (*avoir besoin) - I would need you\n\n• je pourrais faire semblant d'être moi (*pouvoir) - I could pretend to be me\n\n• je crois que je l'aurais trouvé (*trouver) - I think I would have found it\n\nJust imagine, when you are memorizing the lyrics and singing along, you're practicing the language. How much fun is that!\n\nAnd why stop here? Edith Piaf's \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (see our previous post) is another great French song to add to your language learning repertoire.\n\nI recently came across Sidney's post Learning through song made easy, which suggests four steps to improve both your listening and speaking (maybe even singing!) skills. It's fun AND effective and it not only works for Italian, but for French and other languages as well!\n\nPosted on November 06, 2013 by Peter Editor\n\n\"Non, je ne regrette rien\" - Learning French With a Song...\n\nOur June 2013 entry about the Spanish song \"La Paloma\" has been one of our most read blogs for several months now.\n\nHere is the part of our November 2012 blog again, which had suggested Edith Piaf's famous \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" as a wonderful song to learn and practice French with.\n\nListening to foreign songs is an excellent way to memorize key phrases and expressions – and having fun doing it. Find a song you like and binge listen. Sometimes, you may even start humming and repeating the refrains without exactly knowing the meaning.\n\nIn an earlier blog post - 6 Tips for Learning a Foreign Language - we had suggested listening to songs as tip #4, as listening to music and songs can also fuel your enthusiasm for learning a new language. Lifehacker also has several posts about music and lyrics training for learning a foreign language.\n\nNon, je ne regrette rien\n\nMany may remember Edith Piaf's famous song: “Non, je ne regrette rien.” You can hear her on this YouTube clip. English translations of the song, (even if they are not always correct) are easy to find, e.g. here. It's no mystery why many people make listening to foreign songs part of their language learning practice.\n\nWhy songs Works So Well\n\n• Many songs have a refrain. The repetition of the refrain, especially with an “ear-worm” melody, anchors key words in your memory.\n\n• Easy grammar. Key constructions become obvious and you can remember them readily. For example, the phrase “je ne regrette rien” makes it easy to see how negations are constructed in French: ne...rien or ne...pas, or to pick up on the ni...ni (neither-nor) construction.\n\n• Idiomatic phrases. From song lyrics such as “je n'ai plus besoin d'eux” (I don't need them anymore), you can derive related key phrases such as “j'ai besoin” or “je n'ai pas besoin.”\n\n• New vocabulary. And, you may learn some new vocabulary that your typical language course may lack, e.g. “balayé” (swept, “broomed” away), “chagrins” (sorrows), “je me fous” (I don't care).\n\n• Exaggerated sounds. Moreover, songs exaggerate and stress the sounds of some words and thus make them easier to understand and imitate.\n\n• Pronunciation. Also pay particular attention how Edith Piaf pronounces the \"r\". The French \"r\" is not an easy sound for foreigners and has to be practiced!\n\nWhile Edith Piaf's \"Non je regrette rien\" may be particularly memorable and instructional, there are many other French songs and lyrics you can find on the Internet. For example Joe Dassin's song \"Si tu n'existais pas...\" is another favorite of ours for learning French with a song and the topic of this post.\n\nPosted on June 14, 2013 by Peter Rettig\n\nLa Paloma Lyrics – Learning Spanish With a Song\n\nVery likely you've heard “La Paloma” sung in your native language. It's a very popular song.\n\nIn this YouTube video of “La Paloma”, Victoria de los Angeles, one of the great voices of the 20th century, sings the original Spanish lyrics, and the video shows the English translation. (There is also a wonderful Spanish version by Nana Mouskouri here, but without the text, you could listen to later!)\n\nDid you know?\n\n“La Paloma (meaning “the dove”) was composed and written by the Basque /Spanish composer Sebastián Iradier (later Yradier) after he visited Cuba in 1861. (You can read in this Wikipedia entry that the motif of “La Paloma” dates back to an episode that occurred in 492 BC!)\n\nAnd the many different versions in many of the world's languages and performed by many famous singers are a testimony to its popular appeal across cultures and centuries.\n\nThe Original Lyrics\n\nThe original Spanish lyrics of the first verse are below. (Note that you will find other Spanish versions as well.)\n\nCuando salí de la Habana,\n\n¡Válgame dios!\n\nNadie me ha visto salir\n\nSi no fuí yo.\n\nY una linda Guachinanga\n\nAllá voy yo,\n\nQue se vino trás de mi,\n\nQue si señor.\n\nSi a tu ventana llega\n\nUna paloma,\n\nTrátala con cariño\n\nQue es mi persona.\n\nCuéntala tus amores,\n\nBien de mi vida,\n\nCorónala de flores\n\nQue es cosa mía\n\nAy chinita que sí ,\n\nay que darme tu amor\n\nAy que vente conmigo,\n\nChinita, a donde vivo yo.\n\nTypical Spanish Constructs\n\nSome of the lyrics of the original version may be difficult for a beginner, but, with the translation provided in the video, you'll be able to decipher the meaning quite easily.\n\nYou'll also notice a number of typical Spanish constructions, e.g. valgame, trátala, cuéntala, corónala, darme, in which the object is added to the end of the verb. (You can also start paying attention to the spelling of words like \"si\" [if] and \"sí\" [yes])\n\nBy watching the YouTube video with its translation several times you can start memorizing the Spanish lyrics and their English meaning. Not only will the song sound even more beautiful now that you understand it, you'll remember the object constructs next time you see them in other contexts.\n\nAnd when you hear other versions in Spanish (or in other languages) you may also recognize the changes in the lyrics.\n\nPostscript:\n\n(1) We also have posts about French, German, and Italian songs that are fun to listen to – and, when memorized, can remind you of some key aspects of the respective language.\n\n(2) In a January 2015 post, La Paloma - Carmen - Cuba: Spanish Language Connections, we described some interesting connections between Bizet's opera Carmen and La Paloma's author Iradier.\n\n(3) We recently discovered a Spanish language site which uses Spanish songs a their lyrics as part of their program. You won't find \"La Paloma\" but many contemporary songs on Language Zen.

(Even the Shuttle, left, needed some boosters!)\n\nLearning a foreign language as an adult requires you to find those methods and routines that work best for you and that allow you to apply them - ideally - on a daily basis.\n\n5 ways to create a quick language learning moment\n\n1. READ 3-4 sentences ALOUD - preferably from an ongoing book you've been following. Reading aloud (or even in a whisper) gets you to work on your \"mouth mechanics\" - the way you need to move your mouth in order to produce the correct sounds. In the meantime, your brain is registering word order and an idiom or two.\n\n2. Type or WRITE out (copy) a few interesting sentences from a book, magazine, Internet site, etc. Writing out a language is very different from reading it. You become much more aware of structure, spelling, endings, etc.\n\n3. Take a useful sentence from a book or story, MEMORIZE it, and then write it out from memory. It can also be a famous saying. The sentence can be as short or long as you wish. Do this with 2 or 3 sentences, checking back to see if what you wrote was correct.\n\n4. Doodle or DRAW 4-5 objects, such as furniture, clothing, fruit, items on your desk. Then write the name of each item in your new language. Maybe you'll have to look up the words. No-one has to see your drawing, unless you're a Picasso. But the act of creating images and labeling them is a great way to engage your brain.\n\n5. LISTEN for a few minutes to your favorite foreign language song and follow the lyrics closely. Music is a compelling way to experience the rhythm and intonation of a language. (We had posted suggestions for French, German, Italian, and Spanish.)\n\nAny of these 5 quick boosts will keep you learning. For steady progress, nothing can beat a regular learning routine, and these brief techniques can keep you going even in busy times.\n\nPosted on December 13, 2012 by Peter Rettig\n\n\"Dimmi quando...\" - An Italian Song for Language Learning\n\n(Updated 8-25-2017) A previous blog post featured a French song as a prime example for improving one's language skills in a fun way. Some readers asked us about Italian and Spanish language learning songs.\n\nAs the Italian song we have selected “Quando, quando, quando”, an Italian pop song with a bossa nova rhythm.\n\nAlberto Testa wrote the lyrics and Tony Renis (see his picture above), who also wrote the music, performed it first in 1962. Click on Tony's YouTube clip, and the original Italian lyrics you'll find HERE.\n\nPat Boone, Connie Francis, Michael Bublé et al\n\nWhat made this song so well known, was the fact that “Quando, Quando, Quando” was retained in many languages, although the lyrics were modified and adapted.\n\nOver the years, many artists performed the song in English, including, among others, Pat Boone, Connie Francis, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Michael Bublé, who included it in his album “It's Time” in 2005.\n\nThere are well-known versions in German, French, Spanish, and in many other languages, and you can find YouTube clips of quite a few. Click on Michael Bublé's English version here.\n\nTypical Italian\n\nWhat makes this song a good candidate for language learning - apart from the “ear-worm” refrain – are a few typical Italian constructions and the future forms of several verbs:\n\n• dimmi – (tell me!) a word combination of two words “di” (tell!, say!) and “mi” (me), which you may hear quite often in Italy, e.g. in “Dimmi tutto”...\n\n• dirmi – (to tell me) similar as above, but instead of the imperative the infinitive.\n\n• baciandomi – (while kissing me), again a word combination of “baciando” (a gerund of baciare, for those who care) and “mi”.\n\n• the future tense – e.g. “tu verrai” (you'll come), “tu mi bacerai” (you'll kiss me), “attenderò” (I'll wait), “vedrò” (I'll see), “dirai” (you'll say), “lasceremo” (we'll let go), etc.\n\nAnd I'll bet, once you hear this song a few times and understand the Italian lyrics, certain expressions will stay with you.\n\nAnd even if you don't care for “Dimmi quando...”, but are trying to learn Italian - find Italian songs you like and use the web to help you translate them. You'll enjoy them even more when you can sing and understand them!\n\nPostscript: I recently came a across the post of a young Polyglot-in-the making. She suggests four simple steps for learning with songs to improve both your listening and speaking (maybe even singing!) skills.\n\n1. Listen! 2. Sing! 3. Translate! 4. Retranslate!\n\nIt's fun AND effective and it works for all languages!\n\nPosted on November 27, 2012 by Peter Rettig\n\n\"Guten Morgen Liebe Sorgen\" - German song for Language Learning\n\nListening to foreign songs is an excellent way to memorize key phrases and expressions – and having fun with German language learning . Sometimes, you may even start humming and repeating the refrains without exactly knowing the meaning.\n\nIn an earlier blog post - 6 Tips for Learning a Foreign Language - we had suggested listening to songs as tip #4, as listening to music and songs can also fuel your enthusiasm for learning a new language.\n\nLanguage Learning with \"Guten Morgen, liebe Sorgen....\"\n\nThis song was written and first performed by Jürgen von der Lippe in 1987.It's his greatest musical success and he sang it for the next 20+ years, with a refrain that is hard to get out of one's mind.For those who don't speak German at all, this YouTube clip provides a (not always correct) translation.\n\nYou also may understand why the song is still popular in Germany today. And for those who know some German, similar points as above also apply:\n\n• The refrain both with its perfect (Morgen-Sorgen) and partial (da-klar) rhymes is still an ear-worm.\n\n• Expressions such as “na, dann ist ja alles klar” (well, then everything is ok) can easily be remembered.\n\n• Vocabulary such as “behende” (nimbly), “Schwung” (momentum), “Bettvorleger” (rug beside a bed) you probably won't find in your typical language course.\n\n• German has a lot of little words that add meaning to the message, words which often don't translate literally into English. In a song, these may be exaggerated and stressed, and thus be understood more clearly.\n\n• For example, \"schon\" (already) in the line \"seid ihr auch schon wieder da\"; or \"na\" (well) and \"ja\" (indeed), in the line \"na, dann ist ja alles klar.\"\n\nWhich brings me to this question: Which, in your mind, are the English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish songs that make great tools for someone learning the language? Songs that have a refrain and lyrics that are memorable? Drop us a line to contact@gamesforlanguage.com."
