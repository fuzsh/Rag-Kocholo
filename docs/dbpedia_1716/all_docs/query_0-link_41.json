        "text": "Jean-Philippe Smet, known by his stage name Johnny Hallyday, French pronunciation: ​[dʒɔ.ni a.li.dɛ] (born 15 June 1943, Cité Malesherbes, Paris, France) is a French[1]singer and actor.[2] An icon in the French-speaking world since the beginning of his career, he was considered by some[3] to have been the French Elvis Presley. He was married for 15 years to popular Bulgarian-French singer Sylvie Vartan and the two were considered a \"golden couple\" for 20 years. Hallyday has completed 181 tours, had 18 platinum albums, and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.[4] He announced his retirement from performing on 3 December 2007, saying that he would retire in 2009,[5] after a farewell tour. However, Hallyday announced in March 2012 that he would perform inLos Angeles on 24 April, in Quebec City on 10 July and in New York City on 7 October, and he has continued to tour throughout the world (including Europe, North America, and Asia) through 2014.\n\nHallyday remains largely unknown outside of the Francophone world of France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, Guyana, Southeast Asia and Africa thus earning the nickname \"the biggest rock star you've never heard of\" in English-speaking countries.[6][7][8] Nevertheless, at an international level he is still considered as the only non-Anglophone Rock’n Roller having a large international reputation.[9] He was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d'honneur in 1997.[10]\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n3 Personal life\n\n4 Discography\n\n4.1 Studio albums\n\n4.2 Charting albums\n\n4.3 Live albums\n\n4.4 Compilation albums\n\n4.5 Singles\n\n5 Films\n\n6 See also\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nEarly life[edit][]\n\nHallyday's father, Léon Smet (1908–1989), was Belgian; his mother, Huguette Clerc (1920–2007), was French. Hallyday took his stage name from his aunt Desta's husband and dance partner Lee Hallyday, a pseudonym for Lee Ketcham, an expatriate Oklahoman, performer and MC at the Cafe de Paris where Johnny began his singing career. Johnny was raised by Desta and Lee from a very young age, with Lee being his first manager.\n\nCareer[edit][]\n\nInfluenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock revolution, Hallyday became famous in the 1960s for singing rock and roll in French. His debut single, \"Laisse les filles\" was released on the Vogue label in March 1960.[11] His first album, Hello Johnny, was released in 1960.[12] In 1961 his cover of \"Let's Twist Again\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.[13] It topped almost every European chart, although the track did not appear in the UK Singles Chart.[14] He appeared on the American The Ed Sullivan Show with American singing star Connie Francis in a show that was taped at the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris. He also staged many appearances in the Paris Olympia under the management of the late Bruno Coquatrix. For their first concert, The Jimi Hendrix Experience opened for Johnny Hallyday in Évreux on 13 October 1966. Black-and-white footage, also from October 1966, exists of Hallyday partying with Hendrix, his manager Chas Chandler and others.\n\n[2][3]1965\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, Hallyday made a string of albums with Mick Jones and Tommy Brown as musical directors, and Big Jim Sullivan, Bobby Graham and Jimmy Page as session musicians. These are Jeune Homme, Rivière... Ouvre ton Lit (aka Je suis né dans la rue) and Vie. On Je suis né dans la rue, Hallyday also hired both Peter Framptonand the Small Faces. Amongst their contributions are the songs \"Amen (Bang Bang)\", \"Reclamation (News Report)\" and \"Regarde Pour Moi (What You Will)\" which are variations of Small Faces and Humble Pie – which was Frampton's band – tracks and they can be heard playing on the album. Often forgotten is Hallyday's non-LP single and EP track \"Que Je T'aime\" from the same sessions.[15] By 1969 alone, his sales of records exceeded twelve million.[13]\n\nOne of Hallyday's later concerts, 100% Johnny: Live à La Tour Eiffel in 2000, attracted an audience of 500,000 and 9.5 million television viewers (the show was broadcast live on French TV).[16] In December 2005, Hallyday had his third number-one single in France, \"Mon Plus Beau Noël\" (after \"Tous ensemble\" and \"Marie\"), dedicated to his adopted daughter Jade. Shortly before announcing his retirement from touring, he released a blues-flavored album, Le Cœur d'un homme, on 12 November 2007. The album hit #1 in both France and French-speaking Belgium. In addition to the lead single \"Always\", Le Cœur d'un homme features \"T'aimer si mal\", a duet with bluesman Taj Mahal and \"I Am the Blues\", an English-language song written for Hallyday by U2 frontman Bono. His next album, Ça ne finira jamais, released in 2008, another #1 on the French album chart, and its lead single, \"Ça n'finira jamais\", also reached #1. In 2008 he recorded a series of acoustic songs with French musician Drexl Jonez. Hallyday's most recent album, also a #1 hit in France, is Tour 66: Stade de France 2009, a live set recorded at Stade de France during his farewell tour with appearances by Drexl Jonez on the guitar.\n\nFrench movie producers Michèle and Laurent Pétin introduced Johnny Hallyday to Hong Kong film director Johnny To. Hallyday was cast as the main role of To's Vengeance after meeting with the director in early 2008. The shooting began in November 2008 and concluded in February 2009.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life[edit][]\n\nHallyday was introduced to the great chanteuse Édith Piaf in the late fifties and became one of her biggest fans up until her death in 1963. He attended every concert she performed in and was said to have been friends with her throughout his career. In a recent article he claimed that Édith tried to seduce him during a dinner with her in 1960, and resulted in him fleeing from her in despair, but a 1962 photograph of Édith, her husband Théo Sarapo, and Hallyday shows that she earned his trust back. Hallyday performed Édith's 1950 hit \"Hymne à l'amour\" in 1995.\n\nIn November 2005, Hallyday started a procedure to obtain Belgian citizenship but his request was turned down in 2006 because he failed to fulfill the residence requirements. In late 2006, Hallyday announced that he would move his permanent residency to Gstaad, Switzerland to escape the high tax rate imposed by the French government. Swiss law allows wealthy individuals to claim residency if they live six months and one day in the country and then pay a fixed tax based on expenses, such as rent or assets in Switzerland, rather than a percentage of their income. Hallyday has said that he would move his residency back to France if it changes its tax laws.[17]\n\nHe maintains a second home in Los Angeles, where he has been spending increasing amounts of time in recent years, enjoying his relative anonymity in the U.S. In January 2014, Johnny revealed that his current residence was in fact in the United States after an investigation by Swiss journalist showed that Mr. Hallyday did not spend enough time in Gstaad, Switzerland to qualify as a resident. [18] One of his favorite leisure activities is riding his Harley-Davidson on long trips through the California desert, staying in small motels along the way.[6]\n\nHallyday married Bulgarian-French singer Sylvie Vartan on 12 April 1965. Their son David was born on 14 August 1966. Hallyday and Vartan divorced in 1980. He was then briefly married to Babeth Étienne; the marriage lasted less than three months, ending in February 1982. A four-year relationship with French actress Nathalie Baye followed; their daughter Laura Smet was born on 15 November 1983. He was married to his third wife Adeline Blondieau for two years, divorcing her in 1992. He has been married to Laeticia Boudou since 25 March 1996. The couple have adopted two girls from Vietnam: Jade Odette Désirée, born 3 August 2004 (formerly Bui Thi Hoa), in November 2004,[19] and Joy (Maï-Huong), born 27 July 2008, in December 2008. He also has 3 grandchildren through his son David; their names are Emma, llona and Cameron.\n\nHallyday supported Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2007 French presidential election. The Masked Avengers referenced this in their prank call to American vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin when an Avenger impersonating Sarkozy named Hallyday as his \"Special American Advisor\".\n\nIn July 2009, Hallyday was diagnosed with colon cancer,[20] and underwent surgery. On 26 November 2009,[21] Hallyday underwent surgery in Paris to repair a herniated disc. He suffered complications and was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. It was announced that Hallyday had been put into a medically induced coma in order to repair lesions that had formed as a result of the surgery and to relieve his pain. On 17 December, it was announced that Hallyday and his wife had started legal proceedings against Dr. Stephane Delajoux, who had performed the original surgery.[22]\n\nDiscography[edit][]\n\nStudio albums[edit][]\n\nHello Johnny (1960, Vogue)\n\nNous les Gars, Nous les Filles (1961, Vogue)\n\nTête à Tête avec Johnny (1961, Vogue)\n\nSalut les Copains!
