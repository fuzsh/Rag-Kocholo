        "text": "I seem to be on a quest to start threads about neglected musicians. A search of this forum turned up no threads about Johnny Hallyday, “the biggest rock star you’ve never heard of”…\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nInfluenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock revolution, Hallyday became famous in the 1960s for singing rock and roll in French. His first album, Hello Johnny, was released in 1960. He appeared on the American Ed Sullivan Show with American singing star Connie Francis in a show that was taped at the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris. He also staged many appearances in the Paris Olympia.\n\nMany consider Hallyday to have matured into a greater performer in his later years. One of his concerts, 100% Johnny: Live à La Tour Eiffel in 2000, attracted an audience of 500,000 and 9.5 million television viewers (the show was broadcast live on French TV). In December 2005, Hallyday had his third number-one single in France, \"Mon Plus Beau Noel\" (after \"Tous ensemble\" and \"Marie\"), dedicated to his adopted daughter Jade.\n\nShortly before announcing his retirement from touring, he released a blues-flavored album, Le Cœur d'un homme, on 12 November 2007. The album hit #1 in both France and French-speaking Belgium. In addition to the lead single \"Always\", Le Cœur d'un homme features \"T'aimer si mal,\" a duet with bluesman Taj Mahal, and \"I Am the Blues,\" an English-language song written for Hallyday by U2 frontman Bono. His next album, Ça ne finira jamais, released in 2008, was another #1 on the French album chart, and its lead single, \"Ça n'finira jamais\", also reached #1. Hallyday's most recent album, also a #1 hit in France, is Tour 66: Stade de France 2009, a live set recorded at Stade de France during his farewell tour with appearences by Drexl Jonez on the guitar.\n\nHallyday remains largely unknown outside of France, thus earning the nickname \"the biggest rock star you've never heard of\" in English-speaking countries. He was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion d'honneur in 1997.\n\nWho knows and enjoys Hallyday’s music? Favourites, impressions, recommendations? Is language the only barrier to his success in the English-speaking world? Anyone ever see him in concert?\n\nDr. Weber\n\nHalliday is more or less the French Elvis, which everything such a thing implies. He started as a French copycat of the best American rock n' roll singers, and most of his output is overproduced ersatz with many pompous attempts (\"Hamlet Halliday\", a double concept album in which Johnny acts like the prince of Denmark). His entourage has taken advantage of him many times, as he's not, to be frank, very bright especially when he's under the influence of some more or less legal substance.\n\nBut, from time to time, he can be quite moving, especially as a ballad performer, and he's a very charismatic guy. And his failed attempts at being Elvis, something even he realizes, are also part of the stuff that makes him human and endearing.\n\nI'd say that, if he were to die today (he's in the spotlight because of a failed surgery that seems to have been corrected), it would make a bigger wave in France than Michael Jackson's passing.\n\nSylvie Vartan, she's the aunt of American actor Michael Vartan from JJ Abram's Alias!\n\nI'm a Francophile BUT never liked Johnny. One of my uncles from Europe put it best about Monsieur Smet (his real name): He thought he was Elvis, BUT came across more like James Dean! I get TV Cinque(the French TV station) and recently saw old Johnny on there and he was playing something that seemed more relevant to 1989 than 2009!\n\nThe most interesting factoid about Halliday and music is this:\n\nHallyday hired Peter Frampton and the Small Faces to record on his 1969 album Rivière... Ouvre ton Lit. Amongst their contributions are the songs \"Amen (Bang Bang)\", \"Reclamation (News Report)\" and \"Regarde Pour Moi (What You Will)\" which are variations of Small Faces and Humble Pie tracks and they can be heard playing on the album.\n\nSo the old sod was responsible for the breakup of the Small Faces and the ascent of Humble Pie??!! A blind squirrel finds a nut every once and awhile .....\n\nIf anyone wants a great French singer/songwriter check out Michel Jonasz, he's one of France's best. His album La Fableuse Histoire de Mister Swing was actually once mentioned in Stereophile of all places......\n\nFunny to see a topic about \"Johnny\" here on SHF!!\n\nto be honest, I never really liked him, even if he did a couple of good songs.\n\nBut the fact is that he has a very strong fan-base of 40-50-60 year old people who grew up with him in the 60's and 70's. Note that a lot of them discovered rock'n'roll with Hallyday in the early 60's, at a time when in France it was hard to find some \"real\" rock'n'roll records from the US.\n\nI completely agree with the one who said that if he dies, \"it would make a bigger wave in France than Michael Jackson's passing\". Definitively. But it will not be the same people\n\nThe french youth is not especially \"into\" Johnny, at best they have some kind of respect for the long career he had, but not more. Of course there are exceptions, like some american teenagers must like the late Sinatra records! But there is a significant part of the young rock audience that consider Johnny as everything but a rock singer ; that he's just (and always has been, since the beginning) some kind of commercial product to sell to the masses, and the most over-rated artist in France (I am one of them )\n\nYoung french \"rockers\" (including electro and rap addicts) have much more respect for singers like George Brassens, Léo Ferré, Serge Gainsbourg... those 50's-70's singers were not really doing rock music, but they were probably more \"authentic\" and subversive than Monsieur Smet.\n\nBut, it's a fact that Johnny is a really great singer and performer. He doesn't write songs but he also is from the pre-Beatles/Dylan/Brassens generation, from a time when composer and performer were two separate jobs. No one never tells that Edith Piaf was not a good singer because she had songwriters...\n\nI'll take Cabrel and Jonasz anyday of the week over Halliday! He doesn't have the street cred that someone like Gainsbourg has then again Lucien Ginsburg (his real name) never was that great either BUT he had a rakish attitude , good taste in women like Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot and a very Yiddish sense of humor so that made him unique for sure.\n\nHalliday does love the US though. I remember a French friend of mine in grauate school telling me about him hanging out in Vegas, changing his name from Smet AND apeing American rock and Roll. I knew a few of his songs BUT never took him seriously because I became exposed to Jonasz and Cabrel at the same time, who are kinda sorta like the Elton John and Neil Young of France if you will.\n\nI agree with most of the comments above, save for one major point: that outside of France he is a nobody... You have to consider all the other French-speaking countries of the world, Canada for instance (English and French are the two official languages here), where Johnny used to be a very \"popular pop\" figure!\n\nI don't like much his music and thing, though he does good ballads and I find his voice very natural and moving. He sounds like a natural singer to me.\n\nAlso, if legend is true one must give credit to him for having crossed the English Channel and \"discovered\" Hendrix in a club, then got Jimi to open for him on a tour of Europe. Hallyday was at a pretty high point of his popularity then, and this bigger stage exposure for Hendrix on the continent, early on, certainly was an important milestone for him!"
