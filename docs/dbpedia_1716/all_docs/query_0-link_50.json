        "text": "Johnny O’Keefe - To Love (1962)\n\nThe melody of Johnny O’Keefe’s To Love is from La paloma (1859) by the Spanish composer Sebastian Yradier. The lyrics are those first recorded by Ral Donner (see below).\n\nThis was the B-side of Sing, a single on Leedon by Johnny O’Keefe (1935-1978), Australia’s biggest star of the rock’n’roll era, known as The Wild One, The King of Rock’n’Roll or just J. O’K.\n\nAll of the songs listed on this page use the same melody, from Yradier’s La paloma. It has been adapted for many songs over the years, but only a few significant or interesting versions are highlighted here.\n\nTo listen to an early recording of La paloma, jump to here.\n\nAcknowledgement: This page draws almost entirely on original research contributed by Chris Vening.\n\nRal Donner - To Love (1962)\n\nInfluential version\n\nSingle on Gone, recorded May 1961 but released the following year. In the meantime, Elvis’s No More, based on the same Sebastian Yradier melody, La paloma, had been released (see below).\n\nThe lyrics: (also used in Johnny O’Keefe’s 1962 Australian version)\n\nTo love –\n\nIs to feel a thrill that you’ve never known\n\nTo love –\n\nIs to know her lips are for you alone\n\nTo dream –\n\nAnd to see that wild little dream come true\n\nHow sweet\n\nYou were meant for me – I was meant for you…\n\nRal Donner was an Elvis Presley influenced rock’n’roll singer (1943-1984) whose big hit was his 1961 US #4 You Don’t Know What You’ve Got (Until You Lose It). He provided the voice of Elvis in the 1981 biopic This Is Elvis.\n\nSee also I Got Burned.\n\nWe went into the studio with strings and real heavy production; after George heard it he thought it wasn’t the way to go – that it was too much of a departure off of what I had just done. I didn’t realize he got as far as releasing stock copies of that record (Gone 5108) and that’s when he pulled it off the market and sent me to Florida to do the album.\n\nRal Donner on To Love, Goldmine magazine, 1979\n\nFurther reading: Ral Donner at This Is My Story.\n\nBilly Vaughn & His Orchestra - La Paloma (1958)\n\nInstrumental version, single on Dot by the label’s musical director. Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra were often on the charts from the mid-50s to early 60s, notably with Melody Of Love (1954, #2 USA), The Shifting Whispering Sands (1955, #5) and Sail Along Silvery Moon (1958, #8).\n\nFurther reading: Billy Vaughn entries at All Music and Wikipedia.\n\nElvis Presley - No More (2) (1961)\n\nOn RCA Victor’s Blue Hawaii soundtrack album October 1961. The film was released in November 1961.\n\nThe melody is Yradier’s La paloma. The adaptation for Blue Hawaii was inspired by RCA’s success of the adaptation O sole mio for Elvis’s hit It’s Now Or Never.\n\nAn earlier rewrite of La paloma from Britain, also entitled No More, is a different version: see No More (1), below.\n\nThe Presley lyrics:\n\nNo more do I see the starlight caress your hair\n\nNo more feel the tender kisses we used to share\n\nI close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers\n\nA thousand good-byes could never put out the embers …\n\nFurther reading: 1. Notes on No More from David Neale’s Elvis Originals website [archived page]. 2. The composition of No More at the website of co-lyricist and arranger Don Robertson.\n\nI enlisted Hal Blair’s aid and we began work on it. I didn’t have a copy of the music, so I worked it out from memory. This was probably a blessing in disguise, because it took on a unique quality, different from the song I had learned as a child.\n\nDon Robertson\n\nConnie Francis - Your Love (1961)\n\nMGM recording, June 1961, first released in Germany on single, EP and LP. The melody is Yradier’s La paloma. Connie Francis recorded La Paloma in several languages, 1961-62.\n\nThe Your Love lyric (transcribed by Chris Vening):\n\nYour love\n\nIs the one most wonderful thing I own;\n\nYour love\n\nIs the greatest joy I have ever known.\n\nYour smile,\n\nI can see it even when we’re apart;\n\nI feel\n\nLike a part of heaven is in my heart.\n\nI’ll never forget the night that we met, my darlin’.\n\nOne touch of your hand and I heard the church bells chime.\n\nYou kissed me and said you’d love me for ever, darlin’;\n\nForever, my love, that’s such a long, long time.\n\nFor the full discography of Connie Francis versions (included writer credits), compiled by Roger Turner, open this .pdf file (updated Sept 2010). In summary:\n\nYour Love, 1961, English version (on 1961 Italian album Connie Nel Mondo, also on 1962 German single);\n\nLa Paloma, 1961: Italian version (single in Italy, B-side of Ti Conquistero, and on 1962 album Connie in Italia);\n\nJamais, 1962 (rec. 1961): French version (Canadian single, #1 Canada, and album Jamais);\n\nTu Amor, 1963 (rec. 1962), Spanish version (on 1963 Spanish EP Connie Francis and on 1965/66 album Canta en Espanol y en Stereo Vol 2 and on EP);\n\nTeu Amor (1), 1962, Portuguese version (single and on 1962 album Connie Francis Internacional);\n\nTeu Amor (2), 1985 (rec. 1962), Portuguese version (on album Connie Francis, Brazil only).\n\nLa Paloma, 1963 (rec. 1962): Neapolitan version (on 1963 album Mala Femmena & Connie’s Big Hits In Italy);\n\nThank you to Connie Francis discographer Roger Turner.\n\nDean Martin - The Look (1956)\n\nThe lyric:\n\nThe look\n\nAs she passed she flashed that come-hither look\n\nThe look\n\nThat was meant for me and for me alone\n\nThe look\n\nWould be out of place in a children's book\n\nThe look\n\nThat could chip a piece off a heart of stone\n\nAlso recorded by Dean Martin in 1963 as La Paloma, with different lyrics: see below.\n\nWebster Booth - No More (1) (1951)\n\n78 rpm recording by the tenor Webster Booth (1902-1984).\n\nLyrics are by British playwright and songwriter Jack Popplewell (1909-1996). His best known composition is probably the often-recorded If I Should Fall In Love Again (1940).\n\nElvis Presley’s No More (1961), also based on Yradier’s La paloma, is a different version with the same title. See No More (2), above.\n\nChris Vening points at that, although there are similarities between the lyrics of No More (1) and (2), this may be attributable to the use of “stock phrases of romantic ballads” in both versions.\n\nThanks to Webster Booth blogger Jeannie C.

Webster Booth filmography and biography at IMDb.\n\n[Published composition] - La Paloma (1859)\n\nSpanish composer Sebastian Iradier (1809-1865), published as Yradier, is best known for two compositions: the much recorded, performed and reworked La paloma, and El arreglito, famously used as the habanera in Carmen by Georges Bizet who initially believed it was a folk song but later acknowledged it as Yradier’s composition.\n\nCommentary by researcher Chris Vening (contributed):\n\nLa paloma may be the most recorded song in history. First published in Madrid in 1859, it was written by the Basque-born Spanish composer Sebastian de Yradier (or Iradier). He may have written it on a visit to Havana, inspired by the habanera, a style of Cuban dance music performed with sung lyrics.\n\nThe song’s central motif was simple: a dove (la paloma) brings back a final message of love from a sailor who will never return. But as the song spread through Europe and America it picked up new lyrics and ideas. In Mexico it became the anthem of revolutionaries and royalists alike. It became a sailor’s favourite in the seaports of north Germany. It spread to Spain where havaneres flourished on the Catalonian seaboard. In the US it spawned racist parodies and influenced the jazz of Jelly Roll Morton.\n\nLa paloma appears to have been recorded in the US as early as 1896. Since then it has been recorded constantly, in many languages, with widely differing lyrics, and in every possible musical genre and style: military band, light orchestral, operatic, popular, jazz, rock, lounge, reggae, folk and many more. Some of the most popular versions are purely instrumental, like the 1958 US and European hit by Billy Vaughn and his Orchestra.La paloma has inspired several films including its own documentary, the 2008 Sigrid Faltin film La Paloma. Sehnsucht. Weltweit (La Paloma. Yearning. Worldwide).\n\nReferences: 1. James J. Fuld discusses the original publication of La paloma, in his Book of World-famous Music (1966), see relevant excerpt here. 2.

To accompany Sigrid Faltin’s documentary on La paloma, Trikont released La Paloma: One Song For All Worlds, Vols 1-6 [Amazon].\n\nDean Martin - La Paloma (1963)\n\nOn the 1963 Reprise album Dino Latino:\n\nWhen I left Havana nobody saw me go\n\nBut my little gaucho maid who loves me so\n\nShe came down the pathway following after me\n\nThat same little gaucho maid that I longed to see\n\nIn 1956 Dean Martin had recorded The Look, also based on La paloma: see above."
