        "text": "confranfan SUBS\n\n7th Jul 2017\n\nQUALITY RECORDS release\n\nMGM label - LSLP Series\n\nThe following compilations are also exclusive to Canada, and were issued by Quality as a supplementary series of French related material. Although the three Connie Francis albums are clearly consecutive releases in this series, each has a different presentation of catalog number on the sleeve and/or label The postings being made to this site have \"standardized\" the layout of these catalog numbers, providing notes of reference on presentations used by the releases.\n\nA1: JAMAIS [Your Love / La Paloma - French version]\n\nA2: C'EST LUI QUE JE VEUX [Someone Else's Boy - French version]\n\nA3: MONSIEUR TWISTER [Quand Il Twiste / Mr. Twister - French version]\n\nA4: LA SEULE QUI T'AIME [Pretty Little Baby - French version]\n\nA5: LILI MARLENE [French version]\n\nB2: MON COEUR EST UN VIOLON [Love Is Like A Violin - French version]\n\nB3:TANGO DELLA GELOSIA [Jealous Of You]\n\nB4: FAUT PAS FAIRE CA [Too Many Rules - French version]\n\nB5: LA PALOMA [Your Love - Italian version]\n\nAlbum liner and spine display catalog number as LS LP 1 (C)\n\nAlbum front states LSF-LP-1.\n\nLabels state LS.LP-1 (C)\n\nMON COEUR EST UN VIOLIN, translated literally, reads MY HEART IS A VIOLIN. US LP MGM E/SE 4161 MALA FEMMENA, which features the Neapolitan version UN VIOLINO NEL MIO CUOR, provides the track with literal English translation of A VIOLIN IN MY HEART. The official English lyrics version of this song, however, is known as LOVE IS LIKE A VIOLIN.\n\nLiner and labels feature inaccurate title listing of C'EST LUI QUE JE VEUX as CELUI QUE JE VEUX. Liner on the initial release of this album cover erroneously lists MONSIEUR TWISTER as MONSIEUR TWIST.\n\nPresumably, a later edition of this album implemented the use of the \"(C)\" suffix in late 1962. The differing catalog number is displayed on album liner and labels only.\n\nLabels and liner retain inaccuracy of CELUI QUE JE VEUX, but liner has amended MONSIEUR TWIST to read MONSIEUR TWISTER.\n\nAs evidenced by the scans provided, this album was made available in both YELLOW/BLACK label (issued on October 29th, 1962) and BLACK/MULTI COLORED label issued sometime later in 1962/1963 presumably.\n\nI have provided scans of the yellow label edition."
