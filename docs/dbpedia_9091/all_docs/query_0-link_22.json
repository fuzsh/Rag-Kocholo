        "text": "[0:00] [music]\n\nDr. Steven Zucker: [0:05] Ancient Mesopotamiaâ€™s often credited as the cradle of civilization, that is, the place where farming and cities began. It makes it seem so peaceful, but this was anything but the case. In fact, it was a series of civilizations that conquered each other.\n\nDr. Beth Harris: [0:20] Weâ€™re in a room in the Louvre filled with sculpture from the Assyrians, who controlled the ancient Near East from about 1000 B.C.E. to around 500 B.C.E.\n\nDr. Zucker: [0:31] These sculptures, in particular, come from the Palace of Sargon II and were carved at the height of Assyrian civilization in the 8th century B.C.E.\n\nDr. Harris: [0:41] This is modern-day Khorsabad.\n\nDr. Zucker: [0:42] In Iraq.\n\nDr. Harris: [0:44] Various Assyrian kings established palaces at different cities. There were palaces at Nimrud and Assur before this, and after, thereâ€™ll be a palace at Nineveh. These sculptures come from an excavation from modern-day Khorsabad.\n\nDr. Zucker: [1:00] The most impressive sculptures that survive are the guardian figures that protected the cityâ€™s gates and protected the gates of the citadel itself, that is, the area within which were both the temple and the royal palace.\n\nDr. Harris: [1:14] At each of these various gates, there were guardian figures that were winged bulls with the heads of men.\n\nDr. Zucker: [1:20] We think theyâ€™re called Lamassu.\n\nDr. Harris: [1:22] As figures that stood at gateways, they make sense. Theyâ€™re fearsome. They look powerful. They could also be an expression of the power of the Assyrian king.\n\nDr. Zucker: [1:33] They are enormous, but even they would have been dwarfed by the architecture. They would have stood between huge arches. In fact, they had some structural purpose.\n\n[1:42] Itâ€™s interesting to note that each of these Lamassu are carved out of a monolithic stone, that is, there are no cuts here. These are single pieces of stone. In the ancient world, it was no small task to get these stones in place.\n\nDr. Harris: [1:56] Apparently, there were relief carvings in the palace that depicted moving these massive Lamassu into place. Itâ€™s important to remember that the Lamassu were the gateway figures. The walls of the palace were decorated with relief sculpture showing hunting scenes and other scenes indicating royal power.\n\nDr. Zucker: [2:15] This is a Lamassu that was a guardian for the exterior gate of the city. Itâ€™s in awfully good condition.\n\nDr. Harris: [2:21] My favorite part is the crown. Itâ€™s decorated with rosettes, and then double horns that come around toward the top center. Then, on top of that, a ring of feathers.\n\nDr. Zucker: [2:33] Itâ€™s really delicate for such a massive and powerful creature. The faces are extraordinary. First of all, at the top of the forehead, you can see incised wavy hair that comes just below the crown. Then you have a connected eyebrow.\n\nDr. Harris: [2:47] Then the ears are the ears of a bull that wear earrings.\n\nDr. Zucker: [2:51] Quite elaborate earrings.\n\nDr. Harris: [2:52] The whole form is so decorative.\n\nDr. Zucker: [2:55] Thereâ€™s that marvelous, complex representation of the beard. You see little ringlets on the cheeks of the face. As the beard comes down, you see these spirals that turn downward and then are interrupted by a series of horizontal bands.\n\nDr. Harris: [3:10] The wings, too, form this lovely decorative pattern up the side of the animal and then across its back.\n\nDr. Zucker: [3:17] In fact, across the body itself, there are ringlets as well. We get a sense of the fur of the beast and under the creature and around the legs, you can see inscriptions in cuneiform.\n\nDr. Harris: [3:29] Some of which declare the power of the king.\n\nDr. Zucker: [3:31] And damnation for those that would threaten the kingâ€™s work, that is, the citadel.\n\nDr. Harris: [3:35] Whatâ€™s interesting, too, is that these were meant to be seen both from a frontal view and a profile view.\n\nDr. Zucker: [3:41] If you count up the number of legs, thereâ€™s one too many. There are five.\n\nDr. Harris: [3:45] Right, two from the front and four from the side. Of course, one of the front legs overlaps, so there are five legs.\n\nDr. Zucker: [3:52] Whatâ€™s interesting is that when you look at the creature from the side, you see that itâ€™s moving forward. When you look at it from the front, those two legs are static. The beast is stationary. Think about what this means for a guardian figure at a gate.\n\n[4:05] As we approach, we see it still, watching us as we move. If we belong, if weâ€™re friendly and weâ€™re allowed to pass this gate, as we move through it, we see the animal itself move.\n\nDr. Harris: [4:17] Then we have this combination of these decorative forms that weâ€™ve been talking about, with a sensitivity to the anatomy of this composite animal. His abdomen swells and his hindquarters move back. We can see the veins and muscles and bones in his leg.\n\nDr. Zucker: [4:34] There is this funny relationship between the naturalistic and the imagination of this culture.\n\nDr. Harris: [4:39] And the decorative. But all speaking to the power, the authority of the king and the fortifications of this palace and this city.\n\nDr. Zucker: [4:50] They are incredibly impressive. It would be impossible to approach the citadel without being awestruck by the power of this civilization.\n\n[4:57] [music]"
