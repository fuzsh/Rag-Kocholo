        "text": "Suzanne Somers, who gained fame by playing a ditsy blonde on the hit sitcom “Three’s Company” and then by getting fired when she demanded equal pay with the series’ male star — and who later built a health and diet business empire, most notably with the ThighMaster — died on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was one day away from turning 77.\n\nThe cause was breast cancer, Caroline Somers, her daughter-in-law, said.\n\n“Three’s Company,” which premiered in 1977, told the story of two roommates — Chrissy Snow, a secretary, played by Ms. Somers; and Janet Wood, a florist, played by Joyce DeWitt — who welcome a man to join them as a third roommate: Jack Tripper, a culinary student played by John Ritter. Since their landlord would frown on an unmarried man living with two single women, the group pretended that Jack was gay.\n\nHigh jinks ensued. The show featured slapstick comedy, lighthearted misunderstandings and jokey one-liners.\n\nBy the show’s fifth season, “Three’s Company” was one of the nation’s most popular sitcoms.\n\nMs. Somers’s acrimonious contract negotiations with ABC became news in 1982 when she asked for a raise, to $50,000 from $30,000 an episode. In recent years, Ms. Somers repeatedly said that she had sought $150,000, in line with Mr. Ritter’s pay (the equivalent of about $490,000 today).\n\nShe did not get the pay increase. Instead, she was fired.\n\n“I’ve been playing what I think is one of the best dumb blondes that’s ever been done, but I never got any credit,” she told The Times that year. “I did it so well that everyone thought I really was a dumb blonde.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
