        "text": "At the time that \"Thunderbird 6\" was being filmed, the Sydney Opera House was under construction. Construction work could be seen during the shot of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, despite the fact that the movie was set in 2068 (many, many years since the Sydney Opera House was opened). While this probably is an oversight as the Opera House was not completed in real life, it is also possible that it was simply being renovated.\n\nThe newspaper that Lady Penelope reads on the morning of Skyship One's arrival in Egypt clearly shows the date as 11 June 2068. Whilst some sources say the year is 2028, Gerry Anderson has said the series and movies take place a hundred years from when they were filmed.\n\nLady Penelope is so concerned with the fate of the DX 102 airliner crash, she doesn't notice that the second and third paragraphs in the bogus newspaper report of the crash are exactly the same as the first.\n\nWhen the fake Skyship captain puts together the message to ambush International Rescue, he wants them to go to a base in Africa, International Reference 24-04. In the previous movie, \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" the Zero-X plotted crash location is in the United States, International Reference 24-04.\n\nGiven the various sites and stops shown in the movie and using them as the basis for their \"around the world itinerary\" Skyship One did not fly around the world.\n\nThe departure and arrival point is somewhere in the UK. They fly west, flying over New York CIty then west to the Grand Canyon. Then then fly south-east overflying Rio De Janeiro and continue east to a safari stop in Africa. They then fly east to overfly Sydney Australia then turn north west to visit the Pyramids near Cairo, Egypt. The next leg takes them to Switzerland prior to returning to the England (Dover).\n\nSkyship never crosses the Pacific Ocean to complete its advertised \"around the world\" flight.\n\nThe interior of the Whistle-stop Inn has a British pre-war decor instead of having an Alpine/Swiss theming. The same goes for the model trains used to serve the food. Swiss steam trains had a black & red paint scheme."
