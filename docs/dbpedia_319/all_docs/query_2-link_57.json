This year, the vibrant shores of Lake Tahoe will once again serve as the backdrop for an unforgettable gathering of creativity, community, and, of course, adventure.\n\nThe 2nd Annual Lake Tahoe Comic Con is back, promising an exhilarating weekend Sept. 14 and 15.

It’s a place where friendships are forged, ideas are exchanged, and memories are made. Under the umbrella of sponsorship from the International Association of Press and Photographers, Johnson is advocating Childhood Literacy and Art Expression for All Ages by opening up the convention to attendees to create their own vision in art with “Artist Alley,” sponsored by El Dorado Public Library in Tahoe along with story time with Ms. Arnel to promote childhood literacy and highlight Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. Local 10-year-old artist Madison Mora will be on hand to offer inspiration to young artists showcasing their talents.\n\nNationally renowned artists from your favorite comics will be ready to just sit down and have a chat. Oh, yes, they will have celebrities. They’ve invited dozens and are adding more every day ( not to mention our surprise guests).\n\nMeet C. Andrew Nelson who has played Darth Vader since 1994, more than any other actor. Chat with Voice actress Mary Gibbs whose career took off in 2001 when she gave voice to Boo in Pixar’s Monsters, Inc film. Eisner award winner Mel Smith will be on hand along with John Hageman and Manuel Martinez to talk about 10 Ton Press and their incredible line of work including Becoming Frankenstein, Charley & Humphrey, Rock And Roll Biographies.

Dreamwell Comics has even supplied a full-size exact replica of the original Capt.’s chair in the original Star Trek series. Sit in the chair with the bridge behind you and take home an awesome souvenir.\n\nTo make things a little different, Reno-based Coffee N’ Comics are hoping to host a Cosplay Karaoke session, Cosplay For Kindness will be there along with Christine Knoffstetter and Gumi4VCosplay to aid you in your costume making."
