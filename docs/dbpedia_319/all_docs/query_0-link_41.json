        "text": "There are a few ways people know Irving Schwartz. Some are fellow classmates from his time at San Rafael High School in the 1950s. For some, it’s through the civil engineering and land surveying business he started in 1981, or his longtime work with the Marin Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Others might know him from his father’s clothing store for men, Schwartz’s Big and Tall, on Fourth Street in San Rafael.\n\nBut, for car and movie lovers alike, the third generation Marin resident is known for his head-turning white hardtop 1956 Ford Thunderbird that earned fame in Marin resident George Lucas’ 1973 classic movie, “American Graffiti,” which was in part filmed in Marin.\n\nThe San Rafael resident has shown his car multiple times as part of the San Rafael’s May Madness and Bon Air Invitational car shows.\n\nQ How did you get the car?\n\nA I got it on April 1, 2002. When I worked for the County of Marin, I was the resident engineer on the widening of Point San Pedro Road. I would see a man back up this cute car out of his garage and warm it up, and once in a while, he’d drive it around the block. I asked him and he said, “This is my wife’s car.” He bought it for her. He was the original owner. Later, I got a call from someone who wanted me to look at a property on Point San Pedro Road, and I think it’s the same house. I tell the man the story and he said, “That was my uncle. He died and he left me the house,” and he grabbed the garage door handle and opened the garage and adds, “And the car. My wife wants it out of here.” It was out of there quite quickly.\n\nQ What drew you to the car?\n\nA It was a very good-looking classic car. It’s a striking car.\n\nQ How’d you figure out the car’s movie history?\n\nA The man who sold it to me said that he understood it was in the movie, and other people have told me that car was in the movie.\n\nQ What do you enjoy about participating in car shows?\n\nA Mostly just talking to people who want to talk about the car. It’s a great conversation piece.\n\nQ It feels like coming full circle that you showed your car at May Madness near where “American Graffiti” filmed in San Rafael.\n\nA The first time I saw the movie was at the Rafael Theater. The movie shows the Rafael Theater as they drive by and they also show very clearly the store that was my family’s clothing store, with my family’s name on a neon sign in a couple of scenes. That’s fun.\n\nQ What do you love about the car?\n\nA Its looks. I don’t think I would say I am a car guy, it just happened."
