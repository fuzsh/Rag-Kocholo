        "text": "Automotiveness™ Blog: Our Favorite Road-Trip Movies\n\nThe 2023 holiday road-trip season is upon us. According to AAA, some 55 million Americans traveled 50 or more miles from home for Thanksgiving, and about 90% of them went by automobile. That’s a lot of gasoline (and kilowatts), tons of fast food and, in metro areas anyway, too much traffic.\n\nFor those of us staying home and NOT doing battle on the Interstates over the coming weeks, this is a perfect time to buckle up on the couch and enjoy an iconic road-trip movie. Here, in order of their theatrical release, are five of our favorites:\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940, directed by John Ford). The film version of John Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of Dust-Bowl-era Oklahomans migrating by truck to California is gut-wrenching social commentary – and a terrific story, to boot. The cast is one of the all-time great rosters of legends and character actors – including Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, and John Carradine. While many period vehicles make cameos, the singular automotive star is the Joad family’s overloaded Hudson Super Six.\n\nIt’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963, directed by Stanley Kramer). This expansive three-hour tale of a dozen strangers racing each other on the highways of Southern California – to claim some supposed buried cash – featured virtually every living comic actor of renown. Depending on one’s taste, IaMMMMW is either side-splittingly funny, just plain dumb, or both. In addition to the celebrity-studded human cast, the film’s countless four-wheeled luminaries include a Chrysler Imperial convertible, a VW bug, a Dodge M37 tow truck, and a wobbly-wheeled Willys.\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973, directed by George Lucas). Years before his Star Wars franchise exploded on the screen, Lucas put an emphatic stamp on the coming-of-age ensemble-cast genre with this magical film. The narrative is not so much a true road trip as it is a one-night cruise of early ‘60s Modesto, California. The movie catapulted the careers of such notables as Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford. And the cars are spectacular – a hot-rodded 1932 Ford Coupe, a Chevrolet Bel Air Impala, a customized Mercury 2-door and, maybe most notably, a white Thunderbird driven by a then virtually unknown Suzanne Somers.\n\nCannonball Run (1981, directed by Hal Needham). Perhaps the ultimate coast-to-coast car film, this comedy is a fictionalized account of the actual midtown-Manhattan-to-Redondo-Beach contest that was held (clandestinely) between 1971 and 1979. Its headliners are Burt Reynolds, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dom Deluise, Adrienne Barbeau, and Roger Moore. Among the cars being thrashed en route are an 007-esque Aston Martin, a Ferrari 308, a Lamborghini Countach, and a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow.\n\nGreen Book (2018, directed by Peter Farrelly). This Best Picture Oscar™ winner chronicles the true story of the 1962 Deep South concert tour of African American pianist Don Shirley, his driver/bodyguard Frank Vellalonga – and the abject and violent racism they encounter along the way. The cast includes Mahershala Ali (who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar™ for the role of Shirley), Viggo Mortensen, and a gorgeous turquoise Cadillac Sedan DeVille.\n\nSo fire up some popcorn, crank up your streaming service, and celebrate the uniquely American invention of employing road trips as, well, vehicles for great cinematic stories.\n\nHappy Holidays – and safe travels – from Campbell Automotiveness™!"
