He dominated pitching at a time when players were paid little for their talents. Still, Vida was humble and always generous to his fans. We will miss him.\n\n**************************************\n\nMarch 2023\n\nSaint Patrick’s Day Parade\n\nSaturday March 18, 2023\n\nBATOC turns green with envy for all the fun happening in Dublin (Dublin CA that is)\n\nALL PHOTOS – VIEW HERE\n\nALL PHOTOS – VIEW HERE\n\n**************************************\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nSuper Bowl Party\n\nSUNDAY FEB 12, 2023\n\nBATOC cheers for everybody!

Oh, wait. The Guthries didn’t show up. BATOC almost sweeps the baby birds awards! Seriously, BATOC took two of the four categories we entered. PRETTY impressive BATOC! The Verhoeks won the best ’55 award and the Hagers won the very competitive ’56 award. Thanks so much to everyone who attended. You made it a great event. We had 11 cars entered, the other 9 won the “we had a great time” award.\n\nWe met some young Tbird fans on Saturday too. One of them really liked Verhoek’s car, or at least the sign in front of it, another danced for joy in front of a retro, and a third got a lesson in automotive engineering from his Dad. Bill Rose and his nephew Andrew Milman attended, unveiling the 57 they just finished restoring together, a four year effort, and it’s a beauty. Oh, and Suzanne Somers attended with Don Holmes. Suzanne crushed my dream. As a long time fan, I always wanted to meet her, but she just ignored me every time I tried to talk to her.\n\nView More Event Pictures Here\n\n**************************************\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nIronstone Concours\n\nSeptember 23 & 24\n\nWe didn’t get any pictures of the awesome event.

An Odd Bird with the steering wheel on the wrong side didn’t make it to the party. Don Holm’s “Susanne Somers” bird had a wheel fall off on the party lot. (We’re glad neither Don nor Susanne were hurt) Paul and Dave saved the Susanne bird and the Odd Bird made it home again.\n\nWe went on to have a great day. Jack and Sue Mathieson won the prize. We met a motor cycle sculpture and young man who built a hot little Camaro from the ground up! The weather was perfect. The company was grand. Lunch was, …well the food was fine and the company was great 😊.\n\n**************************************\n\nMore August 2022\n\nMorrow Bay Outing\n\nMonday August 15th to 17th – Morrow Bay Drive and Stayover\n\nView more event pictures Here\n\nThank you, Dave and Susan, for a few wonderful days in paradise. After a beautiful drive down to Morrow Bay, Dave and Susan treated us to a delicious dinner catered by the Inn at Morrow Bay, complete with no host bar and great friends. That wrapped up day one. Day two started with breakfast at the amazing Dorn’s Seafood, or for the more adventurous, a whale of a time watching for Whales, dolphins and a host of other sea inhabitants. We spent the day in the quaint city of Morrow Bay, or at the many other attractions like Hurst Castle (when are they going to sell that to me?). They wrapped up the day for us beautify with drinks and pizza on the patio. What a wonderful relaxing few days for all of us (except Dave and Susan :-).\n\nMore pictures from the outing\n\n**************************************\n\nJuly 2022\n\nElkhorn Slough Cruise and Seafood Lunch\n\nSunday July 17th – Elkhorn Slough Outing\n\nGreat time Sunday learning about the wildlife of the Slough.

Great friends, great food, and we were able to maintain our perfect record of letting murderers go free! Never say BATOCers are not compassionate.\n\nThanks to everyone who came out to celebrate the amazing milestone, and special thanks to Skipp Riggs for making it all happen in June of 1956.\n\nView more event pictures HERE\n\nThere are so many great pictures, be sure to view them all on the link above.

A special thank you to all the participants who came out with their cars but did not get onto the field. That was a disappointment to all of us but we all had a great day at the ballpark and an interesting view into the workings of a ball club. It is not simple. If you got to actually watch the pregame show, how did it look?\n\n**************************************\n\nMay 2022\n\nFiloli Mansion and Gardens – 5/16/2022\n\nView all pictures here\n\nThanks to Nick and the whole gang for the great event on Saturday.

It has displays from important wars like World War II, Cold War and Korean War. The Castle Air Force Base was named after Brigadier General Frederick Castle, who died on his 30th bombing mission during WWII. On December 24, 1944, General Castle was killed while leading an air division of B-17’s over Liege, Belgium. He received the Medal of Honor posthumously.\n\n**************************************\n\nMarch 2022\n\nBATOC St Patrick’s day parade – 03/13/2022\n\nLots of time for tasty snacks, relaxing, and socializing before the parade helped make this a fun event.

We drove to the incomparable Presidio where we toured the Walt Disney Family Museum. We learned about the Genius of Walt and his pioneering work. The facility is huge and spectacular. The pictures do not do it justice. Then to the pièce de résistance. Dave and Susan had picked up 60 lbs of fresh crab straight off the boat, a bazillion loves of sourdough straight from Boudin, Toped it off with a wonderful fresh salad and all the fixings for a crab dinner, all out in the Presidio lawn. Nothing to say but W O W ! !\n\nMore pictures HERE\n\n********************************************\n\nDecember 2021\n\nChristmas Party – 11/13/21\n\ngreat dinner and funner gift exchange at the Benicia Yacht Club\n\nAll Christmas Party Pictures, Click Here\n\nJanet again hosted our rowdy crew at the yacht club. We had a delicious dinner and a wonderful time with the club members. Dave got to open about five gifts because he kept opening good stuff and we kept stealing them. We eat until we hurt and then laughed until we hurt some more.\n\n*******************************************************\n\nNovember 2021\n\nBowling for Laughs – 11/1321\n\nBATOCERS strike fear into the pinS at Livermore\n\nAll Bowling for Laughs Pictures, Click Here\n\nWe saw lots of butts trying to knock down those pins. We love Granada Lanes in Livermore, but they have to stop gluing those to the alley.\n\n*******************************************************\n\nOctober 2021\n\nOccidental Drive – 10/17/21\n\nDrive to Bodega Bay, on to Occidental and dinner at the Union Hotel\n\nAll Occidental Pictures, Click Here\n\nIt was a gloomy weekend, but nothing could quell the spirits of our BATOC members as we drove to Occidental. Along the way, we were able to stop at a great photo opportunity in Bodega Bay – a former school that has since been restored by a family, who actually lives there. We finally found our way to Occidental. Founded in 1876, Occidental was a stop on the North Pacific Coast Railroad, connecting Cazadero to the Sausalito ferry. The railway caused a rapid expansion of the timber industry, and by 1877 there were six sawmills in the Occidental area. Trains also brought vacationers from San Francisco.\n\nThe town continues to be a major tourist attraction today. High on the list are the old restaurant\n\nestablishments there. The group had dinner at the Union Hotel, which was established in 1879 and continues to entertain generations of families in Sonoma County. Thanks Dave and Susan for organizing such a wonderful event.\n\n*******************************************************\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nIronstone Concours d’Elegance 9/24-26/21 Murphys, CA\n\nAll Ironstone pictures Click Here\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the best car shows in Northern California. It comes close to the Monterey/Pebble Beach Car\n\nShow, without the auctions and price. The weather was lovely, and we enjoyed our leisurely drive up to Murphys. We had our normal stops along the way – Black Bear in Tracy for breakfast and The Old Corner Saloon in Copperopolis for refreshments.\n\nWe had a great dinner at a local Mexican Restaurant in Angel’s Camp. The next day we showed up bright and early for the car show at Ironstone. It was wonderful as always. There were some spectacular cars there, including our Thunderbirds. In the end, the Guthrie’s took the Blue Ribbon with the Goldenberg’s getting honorable mention!\n\nAfter a fun filled day at the car show, we retreated to Sue and Jack Mathieson’s condominium for a fantastic barbecue dinner. The weather was beautiful, there were deer down below, and everyone had a wonderful time. Thanks to the Mathieson’s for the fabulous hospitality. The next morning we had one more gathering for breakfast, then it was back home with our birds. (oh, there was a stop at Knights Ferry for refreshments too!)\n\n*******************************************************\n\nJuly 2021\n\n*******************************************************\n\nJACK’s DELTA DRIVE -or- on the road again\n\n7/31/21 Rio Vista, Locke and EVERYWHERE in between\n\nAll Pictures Here\n\nWhat a fun day! Jack & Diana Starr did it again. This was the most fun in the most unexpected and unusual places you can imagine. The Club is back into swing!\n\nWe started at the Buttercup and followed Jack along every backroad in California (I’m pretty sure we didn’t miss any). We stopped for a drink (although there is some question about the number our host consumed) in Rio Vista at the infamous Fosters Bighorn, and Jack herded us out and on to Locke and Al’s the Wop. Again, words cannot do justice to the place. We were so excited about the food, we didn’t get pictures, but in a nutshell: think of a BLT or hamburger, then put it on huge pieces of grilled French bread, assembled with great artistry and excess. Got that picture? Now multiply times three and you have Al’s the WOP. I had the “Big ‘Ol Steak” and I’ll just say the name understates the product.\n\nMore pictures – Click HERE\n\nto view the slideshow click the three dots on a photo and select\n\nJULY 2021\n\n************************************************************\n\nOUR FIRST POST-COVID IN PERSON MEETING\n\n7/10/21 Buttercup Inn\n\nIt was so great to see everyone today. In spite if all the exuberant socializing , we still had time to work on this years next events, saw a demo of the history section of the web, and enjoyed a long delayed Buttercup in breakfast.\n\n************************************************************\n\nJune 2021\n\nBATOC 63rd anniversary celebration\n\nShadow Cliffs – Livermore\n\nWow, big time in the hot park today, and no masks required. We had plenty of shade to protect us from the sun on this beautiful day. We celebrated our 63rd anniversary and perhaps as importantly, the first full fledged outing for us since the Covid lockdown last year. Many more to come as the club ramps up again.\n\nMore than 50 of us gathered at the park with old friends, new friends, ribs and chicken and all the “fixins”.\n\nLink to all pictures HERE\n\nAPRIL ’21\n\nSonoma Raceway event\n\nSaturday April 24th\n\nSee all of the event photos HERE\n\nThank you so much Chris Patterson and Renta Hat for this super cool event. We were thrilled to roll our birds onto the raceway. That was the highlight of a super special day. To walk through the pits with all those incredible cars new and old. Hanging with our friends, new and old. A little food a little conversation, and as Elvis said, a little more action. On the track. It must have been embarrassing to the Cobra folks to be blown away by the T-Birds (see below)\n\nOctober ’20\n\nBATOC meeting at Blackhawk Museum\n\nSaturday October 10th\n\nSee all of the meeting photos at the Event Page\n\n*****************\n\nAugust ’20\n\nCovid drive and picnic\n\nSaturday August 8th\n\nALL DRIVE AND PICNIC PICTURES CLICK HERE\n\nThanks to the BATOC board for a very special day of a beautiful drive and great lunch of Togos sandwiches with drinks and snacks galore.

After months of sequestration we were ready to get out of the house. Nick CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED a safe and wonderful drive for us. starting at Our buttercup HOME-BASE, he assembled us all into a 23 car CARAVAN (see: HERDING Cats). It was a Great drive along the BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD SURFACE streets of walnut creek and danville, through the tri-valley hills into downtown livermore and on to Mel’s Diner where he left us to use our own good sense to avoid passing unwanted cooties.\n\nAs often happens on the first spring drive on a hot day, We lost a couple cars when the started to overheat. THe OLSON’S and Mathieson’s both had to pull over and cool down. FORTUNATELY they were both able to make it home, but missed the end of the drive.\n\nThanks again to Nick Verhoek for all the work he did to put this together for us, and not to forget our fearless leader Dave Adams, always in the background keeping us aligned with guidance and advice.\n\nFebruary ’20\n\n2020 Super Bowl Party – (Guthrie)\n\nSunday February 2nd\n\nAll Super Bowl Pictures Click Here\n\nWow, the Guthries did it again. These parties just keep getting bigger and better. WE nominate the Guthries “worlds best hosts”. (if they had just arranged a 49ers win, it certainly would have been awarded without contention, now some little thing the Queen of England did might be serious competition) Let’s see, there were great friends, food, great friends, more food, great friends, what am I forgetting? Ah, football and alcohol, great friends, food… You get the idea.\n\nAll seriousness aside, what a wonderful day it was. Even the final score couldn’t couldn’t dampen the spirit the Guthries instilled. Thank you Maria and Jim!\n\nOur Hosts, Jim and Maria\n\nJanuary ’20\n\nPresidents 2020 Mystery Tour – Escape Room (Adams)\n\nSaturday January 11th\n\nAll Mystery Tour pictures Click Here\n\nA BIG SHOUT OF THANKS TO DAVE AND SUSAN FOR THE MOST AWESOMEST OF TIMES!!\n\nThe mystery was unveiled and we got more than we bargained for. Some of us were taken by terrorists and jailed, some to a carnival, some to a Casino with no way out until we broke the bank. We had to foil the curse of Rumpelstiltskin, and we had to investigate a Chicago murder. All of us were locked up!\n\nSadly we cannot show you pictures of our ordeals as the missions were all classified. We are able to report that, while only one group was able to escape, all were rescued and no PTSD symptoms have surfaced as of this time, perhaps due in large part to a liberal slather of libations, smoked meats and musical fruits immediately after the trauma.\n\nSadly, the musical fruit was too late for our illustrious leader who lacked the gas to reach the enchanted house of Smoke and Musical fruit (aka Back 40 BBQ) and had to be rescued for the second time that day.\n\nStill, some photographic evidence is available prior to our lockup and after subsequent rescues and escapes.\n\nno (Notice this sign is slightly different from the others)\n\nDecember ’19\n\nBATOC Holiday Party (Booth)\n\nSunday December 8th\n\nAll Party pictures Click here\n\nTo the many people who attended, I hope you had as much fun at the party as we did!

The ultimate goal is to educate you on the unbelievable accomplishments of Ford and Shelby American during the 1960’s. They started with nothing and won every major race including Le Mans in the GT class in 1964, and FOUR times in a row over-all from 1966-1969, for a total of FIVE times! It is such a great part of racing history and this legacy must be told!”\n\nLunch and a Movie – FORD v FERRARI\n\nSATURDAY NOVEMBER 16TH (JUST IN TIME TO PUMP YOU UP FOR THE COBRA EXPERIENCE)\n\nMore Ford vs Ferrari pictures HERE\n\nFlyer: Lunch and a Movie\n\ndirections to The Rebel Kitchen Click here\n\ndirections to Livermore theater Click here\n\nRebel Kitchen Menu Click here\n\nTimes and details to follow.\n\nFord vs Ferrari flyer\n\nTHIS IS THE STORY OF CAROL SHELBY’S FIGHT TO BUILD THE FORD MK IV AND RUN IT AGAINST FERRARI AT LE MANS IN 1966.\n\n12 NOON: PARKING AT THE REBEL KITCHEN ACROSS FROM THE THEATER AND A VERY TASTY LUNCH.\n\nCheck out the menu attached.

We were the first ever to receive the “You Got Away With Murder” Award, as no one guessed the killer. As Karma has a way of catching up with us, we discovered a Serial Killer in our midst. Roger Canfield was discovered to be this years killer, and as we learned too late last year, he was also responsible for that murder. Due to the double family feud laws (or is it double jeopardy?) he cannot be re-tried, but we know the truth.\n\nMystery Website: The Murder Mystery Company\n\nDirections: Beebs at Las Positas Golf Course\n\nMay ’19\n\nCTCI Western Classic Roundup\n\nFlagstaff, AZ\n\nWednesday, May 15 through Sunday, May 19\n\nCTCI Convention Report\n\nby Kathy and Tony Lloyd\n\nWe departed for Flagstaff on Sunday, May 12th (Mother’s Day). We sent the first night in Needles, CA. After breakfast, we hit the road once again arriving in Flagstaff around 4 pm. We checked into Little America and got settled in. Tuesday we were on our own and we did a little exploring on our own. we also checked in for the convention. On Wednesday, May 15 Kathy took the bus trip to Sedona and had fun exploring all the little shops. Tony stayed behind and\n\nwashed the car. On Thursday, May 16 it was time to get serious putting the final touches on the car. We once again entered the Touring class. I leaned on the car for four hours and was quite pleased at how the little bird looked. We went back to our room to clean up for the Welcome Party. Tony was having a little problem with his mobility and I was lucky the hotel had a wheelchair that we could use. We got to the welcome party a little early a I wanted to be sure we got a seat. Tony was not doing well and a member of the Arizona Classic Thunderbird Club who is also a Nurse Practitioner told Tony he was suffering from Altitude Sickness. We left the party early as I had to tuck him into bed for a night of good night sleep. I left Tony in bed on Friday morning and proceeded to the judging. After the car was judged there were no other activities for me to participate in so I made my way back to our room as I was feeling a little tired. We both took afternoon naps. That evening was the Western BBQ which featured hamburgers, chicken, sausage, numerous salads plus dessert.\n\nI was not feeling very hungry. After dinner, we were on our way back to our room when I had to step outside for fresh air. Unfortunately, I ended up getting sick. This time it was Kathy’s turn to be tucked in bed. Unfortunately, I ended up getting sick. This time it was Kathy’s turn to be tucked in bed. On Saturday, May 18 I told Tony that I really felt awful and we missed the driving tour and found our way to the local hospital. We were both diagnosed with altitude sickness. Kathy was a little worse than Tony. After promising we were going to leave Flagstaff, the Doctor finally released us. We got back to the hotel where the banquet was\n\njust getting started. We took third place in our touring class. First thing Sunday morning we packed up the car for the trip home. We made it to Barstow, CA and settled in at the Hampton Inn. Monday morning we were back on the road and made it to Bakersfield where we stopped for gas. Tony was not able to get the car started as the starter took a crap. I found a 2014 copy on the CTCI Roster in the trunk and started calling anyone I could find in Bakersfield to answer\n\nthe phone. That’s when we found our guardian angels, Michael and Kathi Parks. This was around noon. Michael had what was necessary to get the starter removed. He took Tony to a rebuilder. Kathi kept Kathy company. Thanks to their help the car was fixed and we were once again on the road home. The one thing we learned this trip is we do not do well in altitude. We do best at sea level.\n\nCinco de Mayo\n\nWell, there wasn’t much planned in May, so we had an impromptu gathering on Cinco de Mayo weekend. This group is always ready to party! We met at Mexico Lindo Restaurant in Pleasanton and had a delicious dinner of Margaritas, Chips, and various Mexican specialties. It was a fun evening.\n\nApril ’19\n\nBATOC Whale Watching Trip\n\nSunday, April 14, 2019 All Day – Moss Landing, CA\n\nGreat time, Great food, BIG whales.\n\nMore Whale Watching pictures\n\nWhat a day on the water. “The High Spirits”, operated by Blue Ocean Whale Watch, and Captain Kate Cummingsteated us like the royalty that Kim Dixon actually is.\n\nKim set us the most fantastic day ever.

Nick Verhoek organized a fun and (don’t tell anyone) educational day at the OAM, We ate and explored and chatted and bought bargain books. Some of us even got to play Indiana Jones on the flying boat “City of Cardiff” that appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark movie. As you can see in the pictures, the guys are nearly indistinguishable from Harrison in our sexy handsomeness. (eat your heart our Blake Shelton).\n\nThe museum had a truly great event. The Friends of Ken Band. played some great music. The folks loved the old birds and planes (not us) and fun was had by all.\n\nFOOD\n\nA food vendor and eating area will be set up so you can spend the day and have lunch.\n\nOpen Cockpit Day invites museum visitors to sit in various aircraft.\n\nSanta Clara Masonic Lodge will off refreshments for purchase.\n\nSt Patrick’s Day Fun Lunch at First Street Alehouse\n\nFirst Street Ale House in Livermore\n\nSaturday, March 16th 12 Noon to 2 PM\n\nSmall group, big fun.

Super Bowl Sunday – Record Setting Victory\n\nMaria and Jim Guthrie threw their annual Super Bowl bash. There was a tremendous turnout with wonderful goodies and fun times for all. Well, you have to hand it to Brady, Belichick and the Patriots – they are a true dynasty. Brady is now the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and Belichick is the oldest coach to win one. They are a great team. The LA Rams didn’t quite have it this year, but being such a young team, we will probably be seeing a lot more of them in the future. We enjoyed celebrating Tony Lloyd’s and Maria Guthrie’s birthdays as well. Thanks to the Guthrie’s for making it a wonderful day!\n\nJanuary ’19\n\nPresidents Mystery Tour\n\nSAT.
