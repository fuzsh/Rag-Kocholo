        "text": "GPM’s Highway Thru Hell greenlit for a 14th season, new scripted film\n\nSidelined: The QB and Me on the way\n\nGreat Pacific Media (“GPM”), a Thunderbird Entertainment Group Inc. (TSXV: TBRD, OTCQX: THBRF) company, is pleased to announce renewals for several of its flagship productions into 2025 and new productions. GPM currently has five series underway with over 50 hours in production.\n\nHighway Thru Hell continues to expand its presence with an historic 14th-season renewal from Bell Media’s Discovery. The new season will begin filming in the winter of 2024. Season 13 is slated to debut on Discovery Canada and The Weather Channel this fall.\n\nProduction is now underway on the film Sidelined: The QB and Me, based on the smash hit Wattpad novel that is being produced and financed by GPM for Tubi, and sold internationally by Blue Fox Entertainment. The movie tells the story of Dallas (Siena Agudong), a burdened but headstrong dancer, who is determined to get into the best dance school in the country — her late mother’s alma mater.\n\nHowever, that dream is suddenly derailed when the cheeky yet secretly grieving football star, Drayton (Noah Beck), crashes into her life with a unique story of his own. Rounding out the cast are James Van Der Beek (Pose, CSI: Cyber, Varsity Blues), Drew Ray Tanner (Riverdale), Deborah Cox (Station Eleven) and Jake Foy (Allegiance). The film is slated to premier on Tubi later this year.\n\nBlue Fox, meanwhile, has closed deals in Germany and Austria (Capelight Pictures), Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and South Africa (Sun Distribution Group), France (SND), Australia and New Zealand (Kismet Movies), Scandinavia (Mis.Label), Switzerland (Praesens-Film AG), Turkey (Videomite), and Eastern Europe excluding Poland (Prorom).\n\nAdditional renewals include Timber Titans, which had a successful debut in early 2024. The docuseries has been greenlit for a second season by Bell Media and will be heading into production this month. Wild Rose Vets, produced by Wapanatahk Media in partnership with GPM, has also been greenlit for a second season by APTN and Blue Ant Media in advance of the first season’s debut in late 2024. Deadman’s Curse season 2 is slated to air this fall on Corus Entertainment’s The History Channel. Season 3 of this docuseries is currently in production. Season 2 of the companion podcast, produced with Curioscast, Deadman’s Curse: Volcanic Gold, premiered this month on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Amazon Music.\n\n“Great Pacific Media continues to move from strength to strength thanks to our incredible teams and strong network partnerships,” said GPM CEO David Way. “Along with the renewal and expansion of our unscripted hits, we’re taking on new genres with an exciting development slate and further delving into scripted films with our latest project Sidelined: The QB and Me.”\n\nABOUT GREAT PACIFIC MEDIA\n\nGreat Pacific Media programs are seen in more than 180 territories, and the Thunderbird Entertainment company specializes in the financing, development, production and co-production of factual, documentary, and reality television, with a growing slate of scripted projects that include Syfy series Reginald the Vampire and feature films Boot Camp and Sidelined: The QB and Me.
