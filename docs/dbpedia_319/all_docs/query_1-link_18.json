        "text": "This article covers logos that contain flashing images.\n\nEditors should list the timestamps, under the videos where such content occurs.\n\nBackground\n\nThunderbird Films was an American film company that was only known to distribute international films, though many aren't known.\n\n1st Logo (June 10, 1923)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, the text \"THE END\" and a two headed bird next to the text\n\nTHUNDERBIRD FILMS\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\n\nat the bottom right corner fades in and out.\n\nTechnique: A still graphic.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the film.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on The Shock.\n\n2nd Logo (1965)\n\nVisuals: Numerous lightning strikes against a blue background. The lightning calms down, as a red thunderbolt abruptly appears at the middle. A split screen effect occurs, revealing a blue thunderbird symbol against a yellow background. The thunderbird symbol zooms in and as it stops, two sets of red text wipes in vertically between the thunderbird symbol. The first set of text at the top reads \"A THUNDERBIRD FILMS\" and the second set of text at the bottom reads \"RELEASE\".\n\nTrivia: The thunderbird symbol according to Native-American culture represents power, protection, and strength. It is often seen as the most powerful of all spirits and can also transform into human form by opening his head up like a mask and taking his feathers off as if they were a mere blanket.\n\nTechnique: Cel animation.\n\nAudio: The sound of thunder for the beginning, a cymbal crashes when the red thunderbolt appears, and an orchestral fanfare as an ending.\n\nAvailability: This was seen on a release of the Italian documentary film Mondo Cane."
