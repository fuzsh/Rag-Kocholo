        "text": "Post Two in my series explaining who's who on a film shoot, and ever wonder who oversees the entire production process? Meet the Executive Producer. The Executive Producer, or EP, is more senior than a Producer and is the person behind the scenes ensuring a film gets made on time, on budget, and at the highest quality. Here‚Äôs what they do: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Funding The EP‚Äôs first mission is often to find the money. Whether it‚Äôs from studios, investors, or brands, they make sure the project has the financial backing it needs to get off the ground. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble the Team The EP hires the director, key crew members, and often the main cast. They bring together the right mix of talent to make the film or video shine. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Manage the Budget Once the money is secured, the EP keeps a close eye on the budget. They ensure that every penny is spent wisely and that there are no nasty financial surprises during the production. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creative Oversight While they might not be involved in the day-to-day creative decisions, EPs have the final say on major creative aspects. They're there to ensure the film stays true to its vision and appeals to its target audience. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Solver in Chief Every production hits a snag or two. The EP is the go-to person for solving problems, smoothing over conflicts, and keeping everything on track. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing and Distribution After the film is made, the EP often plays a role in its marketing and distribution. They work to get the film seen by as many people as possible. Of course, roles and responsibilities can vary due to the type of project. In short though, the Executive Producer is the glue that holds the entire production together. They make tough decisions, manage finances, and ensure the project stays on course. I‚Äôm clearly biased (because I am one!), but having a strong EP is key to any successful production. Looking to hire an elite production crew to shoot a video for your business?

Pictures Lana Wachowki will executive produce, but it will be the first film in the franchise without one (or both) of the sisters directing It‚Äôs time to re-enter the Matrix, only this time with a new director. The Matrix is coming back for a fifth entry, directed and written by Drew Goddard, Warner Bros. announced on Wednesday. Goddard has previously directed Cabin in the Woods and Bad Times at the El Royale. He has even more experience as a writer, with credits like Cloverfield, The Martian, and Netflix‚Äôs Daredevil. In a statement about the movie‚Äôs announcement, Warner Bros. president of production Jesse Ehrman said, ‚ÄúDrew came to Warner Bros. with a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the Matrix world, by both honoring what Lana and Lilly began over 25 years ago and offering a unique perspective based on his own love of the series and characters. The entire team at Warner Bros. Discovery is thrilled for Drew to be making this new ‚ÄòMatrix‚Äô film, adding his vision to the cinematic canon the Wachowskis‚Äô spent a quarter of a century building here at the studio.‚Äù While this will be the first Matrix movie without a Wachowski at the helm, they won‚Äôt be completely uninvolved. Lana Wachowski, who directed The Matrix Resurrections in 2021, will be back as an executive producer on Matrix 5. Lilly Wachowski, who was not involved in the making of the most recent Matrix movie, similarly does not have a role in the upcoming film. There‚Äôs no release date for Goddard‚Äôs Matrix movie yet. ‚≠ê The world's best game studios ship 7x faster with Kaedim3d.com - try it today to turn sketches into game assets in minutes #gdc #gdc2024 #a16z #Games #GameIndustryUpdates #IndieGameDev #VideoGameDevelopment #IndieGame\n\nEveryone is mad at Spotify again cuz they tried to flip the script on Phonorecords IV. But what is this Phonorecords IV, you ask? Phonorecords IV (CRB IV for the cool kids) is the latest contract in the music biz, all about the cash flow for tunesmiths and word weavers coming from those streaming giants we all hate, but vibe to begrudgingly - covering 2023 to 2027. This deal got cooked up after some fast but real talk between the National Music Publishers‚Äô Association (NMPA), the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI), and the Digital Media Association‚Äîyeah, the backwards-hat wearing tech bros repping Spotify and Google. Here's why CRB IV is lit, and why it matters: ‚Ä¢ We're finally seeing a little bump in the payout for songwriters and publishers, with a headline rate of 15.35% for that five-year run. Not much, but better is better. ‚Ä¢ This deal got sealed way faster than the last one, Phonorecords III, which was like an endless encore nobody asked for. ‚Ä¢ The streamers have been hounded for the deets, which they wouldn‚Äôt give up, so SOMEBODY dropped an unredacted version of the agreement for all to peep. Yeah, the plot thickens right about here. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) stamped this bad boy with the official seal of approval. But, not everyone's throwing up peace signs. Some songwriters and their squads are throwing shade, calling for a total redo of how these rates get set - they‚Äôre not feeling the transparency or the terms. Now sure, dive into the nitty-gritty, and you'll find the 411 on stuff like \"family plan‚Äù, \"free trial offering,\" and \"bundled subscription offerings,\" (which to be honest, is a pretty devious play on Spotify‚Äôs part) and penalties, late payments and the rates themselves. But this deal? It's a game-changer for the music makers and their bank accounts for the next few spins around the sun. So, what does Spotify decide to do? They‚Äôre shaking things up by calling its Premium plans 'bundles' now 'cause they're tossing in audiobooks. But here's the kicker (and where it gets confusing too): this switcheroo means the dough rolling out to songwriters is not as fat as the solo sub rate they all thumbs-upped in the CRB IV deal. And yeah, obviously that's got the NMPA throwing some serious side-eye, claiming Spotify's playing them dirty. But wait, there's more. Spotify's dropping a fresh audiobook-only tier and bumping up the price tag on all those Premium plans. And get this, to confuse you on the motivations of Spotify even more, a new 'Basic' tier is on the horizon too, serving up just the beats & podcasts, minus the bookish vibes. This one's apparently gonna stick to the full agreed payout rate for the lyrical geniuses and their paper-chasing pals. Despite stirring the pot, Spotify's all, ‚Äú(Spotify) is on track to pay publishers and societies more in 2024 than in 2023\". And after already sliding nearly $4B to the rights holders in the last two years, maybe, just maybe, things are gonna get better?\n\n3\n\n1 Comment\n\nThe Future of Hollywood is Here! ‚Ä¶or it‚Äôs potential ruin...no big deal.ü§ó David Ellison taking charge of Paramount Pictures is a bigger deal than you might think. He‚Äôs got a chance to do something truly extraordinary. ‚Ä¢ Ellison plans to transform Paramount into a ‚Äútech hybrid‚Äù and he‚Äôs very qualified to do so. He is an experienced film producer and his dad is the co-founder of Oracle. ‚Ä¢ This means heavy use of AI, cloud computing, cutting edge virtual production and visual effects. What it should also mean is smart, savvy and creative marketing. ‚Ä¢ He has a respect for Paramount‚Äôs history, but maintains that nostalgia isn‚Äôt the way forward. So please let‚Äôs not remake Forrest Gump or have 15 more Top Guns. Keep making Mission Impossible though! ‚Ä¢ He‚Äôs gonna trim the fat. An estimated $2 billion of fat. Paramount is gonna be like Survivor for the foreseeable future. Good luck to everyone at Paramount, sharpen your spears and polish your resumes. ‚Ä¢ Can he make Paramount+ compete with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime etc.? No he can‚Äôt, I think I got an offer for 3 free months of Paramount+ for ordering food on Uber Eats, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the path to success. ‚Ä¢ But maybe it can be part of something bigger and better, bundling is all the rage in streaming and sees much less churn. Sony? Starz? Does Microsoft wanna enter the biz? There's no doubt some form of partnership is necessary. All I know is he should do all or at least one of these three things: ‚Ä¢ Be the opposite of what everyone hates. *cough* Max app. *cough* Zaslav. *cough* Be the face of Paramount, endear yourself to the public, let us get to know you and especially your love for film, give us a top 5, show us your Criterion collection! ‚Ä¢ Go hard on video games, you‚Äôll sell more copies of a AAA game than box office tix. I want a Godfather open world GTA style game, a quirky Titanic Simulator where the ship sinks no matter what, and a Terminator survival game (take Last of Us and replace zombies with robots). ‚Ä¢ Focus on incredible stories and innovative filmmaking, give indie artists and student filmmakers a chance to shine on a big stage, let viewers connect with the day to day at the studio. All of this will create a community. And that‚Äôs what should separate Paramount from the other media giants. I've been very critical and dismissive of Paramount over the years(did we really need a remake of Ben-Hur?), but I want it to succeed. It's just too iconic to be salvaged for parts, there's so much history and so much potential. Don't mess it up Dave!\n\n6\n\n1 Comment\n\nMovie theaters break records thanks to Wolverine and Deadpool https://ift.tt/vk09S2E Marvel‚Äôs Wolverine and Deadpool shattered box office records this weekend and movie theater companies are celebrating.

IMAX said its screenings of the movie generated $36.5 million globally, making it its biggest July opening ever and its biggest debut weekend for and R-rated film. Wolverine and Deadpool also broke records at Cinemark for biggest summer weekend debut, largest opening for premium formats and motion seat screenings, and highest concessions revenue since the pandemic.

I am looking forward to investing in the 20,000 title strong media corporation( and counting). I have been waiting for this investment opportunity for a while. I believe we should be able to see this in the next month or two as it has been quite some time since their December 2023 press releases. So get your investing fingers ready for the new ticker coming soon! Building a diverse portfolio across media and entertainment, whilst working in media is such a fascinating aspect of keeping up-to-date with the business and the corporate churn of the executive offices. And we all know there has been quite a churn in that department recently! For example the Disney internal war, anyone?? That certainly was not a smooth transition! - and the votes resulted in the fifth largest shareholder divesting in the company due to a sore EGO. Personally I believe that was a bad move considering the performance numbers. But I certainly had fun buying a few extra shares during that particular downturn. Which is already looking up!) But let‚Äôs see how the House of Mouse performs in the long run when a new lion comes to the block as well as some serious acquisitions between Skydance and Paramount‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say the movies are getting far more interesting! And that‚Äôs not just because we‚Äôre getting a miniature break from another comic book film franchise(and thank goodness for that! Please Hollywood let‚Äôs bring back the golden era of cinema, original content /IP and independent film. I think we had enough remakes for now‚Ä¶ do you hear that Hollywood? Yes your bottom line may be doing well, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time until franchise fatigue once again. And all of these mergers and acquisitions are happening right before the largest predicted economic downturn in US history. Get your rodeo hats and your investing fingers ready. 2025 is going to be a fascinating year financially for Hollywood! Especially with AI encroaching at breakneck speed. #film #finance #investing #media https://lnkd.in/g8JRfhps!\n\n9"
