        "text": "Thursday NightLife: 6:30 pm, 7:30 pm, 8:30 pm, 9:30 pm\n\nCapacity limited, reservations required\n\nExplore five planetarium short films exploring cultural and indigenous astronomy perspectives from around the globe. Each film stands alone as a short story but in combination, they create a longer narrative â€“ organized around themes of \"Finding Patterns\" and developing tools, or as we say, \"To Seek Far.\"\n\nOne Sky Project is an international collaboration focused on increasing understanding about cultural and indigenous astronomy, its historical and modern applications, and how our One Sky connects us all. To learn more visit www.oneskyproject.org.\n\nPLANETARIUM PASSES"
