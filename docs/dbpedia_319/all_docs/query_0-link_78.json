Both were residents at George Whittell Jr.’s magnificent Tudor Revival summer estate, Thunderbird Lodge, built between 1936 and 1939.\n\nIt is one of the best examples of a great vintage waterfront estate on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe from the era when prominent San Francisco families built palatial vacation homes.\n\nThe historic Nevada site consists of a main lodge surrounded by three cottages, a card house, a boathouse, an elephant house, a lighthouse, three garages, and a gatehouse all nestled in a high desert pine forest. Camouflaged into the granite and aquamarine shoreline, highlights of the lodge range from fish tanks embedded in the walls to multiple secret passageways.\n\nSimply put, the lodge is outlandish – elk heads, animal skins, movie projectors, radios, African carvings and a photo of Whittell kissing Bill. The story goes that the lion was Whittell’s closest friend and companion traveling everywhere in George’s Murphy convertible roadster.\n\nWhittell’s immigrant grandparents struck it rich during the California gold rush of the 1850s, not by mining but through shrewd investments in real estate and railroads. His father eventually took over the financial empire and expected young George to toe the family line, attain a proper education, marry the right woman, and succeed in the banking business.\n\nGeorge failed miserably on all accounts. Rebelling against high society, as a teenager he ran off and joined the Barnum & Bailey Circus in Europe. When World War I began, he volunteered as an ambulance driver. Whittell’s parents purchased for him the rank of captain, and for the rest of his life, he preferred to be addressed as Capt. Whittell.\n\nWhen he left the military he inherited a fortune that was the modern day equivalent of $49 billion. The highly eccentric Whittell vowed to never work a day in his life. It’s a goal he realized to the best of his ability throughout his life, dying at the age of 87 in 1969.\n\nThunderbird Lodge was his escape from the world. A notorious bon vivant, Whittell acquired elegant automobiles and fast boats, hosted wild parties and squired casino showgirls around the lake in his lightning-quick, 55-foot mahogany yacht dubbed The Thunderbird.\n\nAnd that’s not all. At one point, Whittell owned more than 100,000 acres on the Nevada side of Tahoe, including 27 miles of shoreline. Whittell cashed out of the stock market just before the 1929 crash and scooped up much of the land from the Carson & Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Co. and other landholders needing cash. He paid 6 cents an acre.\n\nLast summer, my wife, Jane, and I received a fascinating tour of Whittell’s summer lakeside estate. Located not far from Incline Village, it’s a 20 minute drive north from downtown Lake Tahoe to the lodge. Whittell might have been the richest American nobody has ever heard of.\n\n‘He never became famous,’ said Susan Grove of the estate’s Preservation Foundation Society and our tour guide, ‘because he never really did anything. But he was a fantastic land steward. That is why, today, the east side of Lake Tahoe is so lightly developed. George Whittell owned it all.’\n\nThunderbird Lodge sits in isolation on a section of the lake that is rugged and pristine, in sharp contrast to much of the western – or California – side, which is populated by a patchwork of endless homes and commercial property.\n\nThe magnificent estate was designed to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. At the height of the Great Depression, Whittell commanded a legion of Nevada workers to construct his ‘Castle in the Sky.’ Masons from the local Washoe and Paiute tribes constructed the granite stonework, Norwegians did the woodwork and a Venetian ironworker, Anthony Soletti, created the decorative images of birds, squirrels and deer on the exterior. With its steep-pitched roofs, it remains an architectural marvel.\n\nFive small cottages are situated nearby, each a miniature version of the main house. Upstairs, at either end of the house, are two modest bedrooms, one for Whittell and the other for his French born wife, Elia. She rarely visited, spending much of the year in France, and Whittell openly shared his manor with a succession of mistresses and show girls. Whittell’s desire for privacy is evidenced by a 600-foot subterranean tunnel blasted out of solid granite by Cornish miners. Halfway down the tunnel, we paused to peer into the ‘Dungeon,’ a small cell-like enclosure with bars on the door.\n\n‘George told a lot of stories, and many guests who came here left in a highly intoxicated state, so we don’t know which stories we can believe,’ Grove said. ‘But according to one, people who passed out drunk at George’s parties sometimes woke up the next morning in the dungeon, sometimes with Bill the lion licking their face.’\n\nMore than 40 birds lived in the aviary on the front porch of the estate. There is a walkway that crosses a bridge to the ‘card room,’ a cottage where Whittell hosted high-stakes, all-night poker games with the likes of baseball legend Ty Cobb and Howard Hughes. Showgirls from Tahoe’s Cal-Neva Lodge danced on the tables.\n\nAt the far end of the 600-foot tunnel is the largest boathouse on Lake Tahoe, built to house Whittell’s favorite toy, a 55-foot, torpedo-shaped, 70 mph, triple-planked Honduran mahogany speedboat, called the Thunderbird. The vessel resembled his personal DC-2 aircraft and his many Duesenberg automobiles. The engines were later replaced with two V-12 Allison aircraft engines, each with 1,100 horse power, by casino magnate Bill Harrah, when he purchased the boat from Whittell in 1962.\n\nToday, the regal Thunderbird can be seen in her cavernous boathouse carved out of a solid granite hillside. When it was built, the Thunderbird cost $87,000, roughly $1.4 million in today’s dollars. It gets one-quarter mile per gallon. Chartering Tahoe’s grand dame for private cocktail cruises start at $5,000. The revenue helps preserve this iconic vessel for generations to come.\n\nThanks to the Thunderbird Lodge Preservation Society, the lakeside estate is open to the public for tours. While the stone manse and mahogany speedboat are the visible monuments to George Whittell, his real gift remains the wide-open spaces we all enjoy on the east shore of Lake Tahoe.\n\nOriginally Published: May 23, 2014 at 10:47 a.m."
