        "text": "The Legendary El Tovar - Grand Canyon's Premier Lodge\n\nAbout the El Tovar Hotel\n\nThis celebrated historic hotel located directly on the rim of the Grand Canyon first opened its doors in 1905. The hotel was designed by Charles Whittlesey, Chief Architect for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. The Chicago architect envisioned the hotel as a cross between a Swiss chalet and a Norwegian Villa. This was done in an effort to appeal to the tastes of the elite from that era, who at the time considered European culture the epitome of refinement. El Tovar was one of a chain of hotels and restaurants owned and operated by the Fred Harvey Company in conjunction with the Santa Fe Railway. The hotel was built from local limestone and Oregon pine. It cost $250,000 to build, and many considered it the most elegant hotel west of the Mississippi River. In 1987 the Hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark. In the past, the hotel has hosted such luminaries as Theodore Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Western author Zane Grey, President Bill Clinton, Sir Paul McCartney, Oprah Winfrey, and countless others.\n\nToday, El Tovar retains its elegant charm and is widely considered the crown jewel of Historic National Park Lodges. Located directly on the canyon rim, El Tovar features a fine dining room, lounge, gift shop, and newsstand. El Tovar offers guests full bell service, and in-room dining for breakfast and dinner. El Tovar is a world-class travel destination.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe entire hotel is designated non-smoking. If you smoke in the guest room, a charge of $175 will be added. Rates are quoted on a per night basis, and based on double occupancy. Rates do not include current tax, but do include the NPS utility surcharge. Rates, taxes, and surcharges are subject to change.\n\nAccessible rooms: Accessible rooms are available, including some with roll-in showers. To see available ADA-compliant rooms check the “ADA/Accessible Rooms” box in the online reservations application or call Central Reservations (7a-7p MT) at (888) 297-2757.\n\nEl Tovar Hotel\n\n1 El Tovar Road\n\nGrand Canyon, AZ 86023\n\nDirect: (928) 638-2631\n\nDirections"
