        "text": "Thunderbird Films were a Los Angeles based film distributor, who released loads of trailer reels usually on 200ft or 400ft with multiple trailers on each reel.\n\nThe listings are a very varied selection, of both super 8 & 16mm. In fact mentioned in the listings that all titles that are in 16mm are to be available in super 8 too.\n\nCheck out the listings. Not sure if all the titles were released exclusively by Thunderbird Films, or other distributors at the time also released them too."
