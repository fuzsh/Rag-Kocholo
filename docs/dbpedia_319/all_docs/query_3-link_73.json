        "text": "The training field was constructed about 25 miles from Phoenix. The buildings, landscaping, and runways were arranged to approximate a mythical Anasazi Thunderbird from the air, with the control tower forming the bird’s head. The project began in 1939, with the construction of the pilot training facility beginning on January 2, 1941. The training facility was completed in a remarkably short period of 3 months.\n\nThe name of this project, Thunderbird Field, undoubtedly influenced the name choice for Stewart and DeBona’s P-51 racer after the war.\n\nThunderbird Field was eventually incorporated into the Army Air Forces training establishment and trained more than 10,000 pilots during World War II.3\n\nA movie was shot on location at Thunderbird field in 1942 entitled Thunder Birds: Soldiers of the Air. It is a typical wartime enlistment motivational film, with the normal Hollywood inaccuracies, (like taking off in a Stearman and the plane magically becoming a Boeing P-12 in the air). But it is filmed in color and shows what Thunderbird Field looked like in its training heyday.\n\nDuring the pre-war time period, Stewart found work in numerous films from 1936 to 1941. By the time US involvement in WWII was on the horizon, he had played the lead in Capra’s “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” (1939). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Mr. Smith and actually won his first Oscar the following year for “Philadelphia Story”.4\n\nHis firmly established fame as an actor would later become a point of contention when the Army assigned him to non-combat duties.\n\nJust before the United States’ entry into World War II, Stewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the United States Army. However, at the age of 32, he was too old to qualify for aviation cadet training, which would have been his first choice.5 In 1941, after winning the “Best Actor” Oscar for The Philadelphia Story, Stewart’s reported Hollywood income was $12,000 a month. The joke in the industry was that, as a private in the military, he got paid $21 a month, thus taking a huge pay cut of $11,979.”6 While the movie industry may have made a joke of the change of pay, the fact that Jimmy Stewart was willing to leave his movie star income for a private’s salary, demonstrates the sacrifice he was willing to make for his country.\n\nThat Jimmy enlisted was no surprise to his family, whose tradition of military service went back to Fergus Moorhead, a 3rd great grandfather, who served in the Revolutionary War. Jimmy’s maternal grandfather was a general for the Union in the Civil War, and his father Alex, served in both the Spanish-American War and World War I.\n\nStewart’s first attempt at enlistment in November of 1940 was rejected because, at 138 pounds, he weighed 5 pounds less than required for his 6’3” height. Three months later, in February of 1941, Jimmy successfully enlisted and reported for induction on March 22, 1941. Various accounts exist of how he passed the weight requirement, from having a friend man the scales, to loading up on bananas before the weigh-in, but in any case, James Maitland Stewart was now a private in the U.S. Army Air Corps.\n\n3 Bart Barnes Film Hero Jimmy Stewart Dies at 89, Washington Post, Thursday, July 3, 1997; Page A01\n\n4 Together We Served website, https://blog.togetherweserved.com/2021/12/01/jimmy-stewart/ accessed 11-23-2022\n\n5 TResch, John Phillips (2005).

As a college graduate, he was eligible to apply for a commission as an officer. During his 9-month assignment at Moffett Field, now Corporal Stewart completed courses with the goal of obtaining a flying commission, which required 400 logged flying hours. Jimmy was 40 hours short in the 200+ hp aircraft required for a second lieutenant commission. To rectify that deficiency, Stewart logged flight time in high-performance aircraft at his own expense on weekends.\n\nAs Corporal Stewart awaited news of his commission, the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. “A month later he received his commission, and because he had logged over 400 hours as a civilian, he was permitted to take basic flight training at Moffett and received his pilot wings. During the next nine months, he instructed in AT-6, AT-9, and B-17 aircraft, and flew bombardiers in the training school at Albuquerque, N.M.”7\n\nThough Jimmy’s first flying assignment was as a flight instructor, the Army was determined to use Stewart as a recruiting tool. There was little doubt that a star of his stature, wearing a USAAF uniform and pilot’s wings, would be an effective inducement to prospective enlistees. While he did participate in some early war publicity tours in Washington D.C., Jimmy’s interests were to contribute to the war effort as a combat pilot rather than as a recruitment encouragement. With that goal in mind, Lieutenant Stewart enrolled in multi-engine and instrument training upon his return to Moffett Field.\n\nWhen he completed his multi-engine rating, Stewart was assigned to Mather Field for multi-engine instructor pilot training. Now a qualified multi-engine instructor, Stewart went to Kirkland Field near Albuquerque, New Mexico where he flew Beechcraft AT-11s on bombardier cadet training flights. Later, at Mather Field again, he served as a four-engine instructor in both the B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers. Much to his dismay, Stewart stayed stateside for almost two years working as a flight instructor.\n\nFinally in the fall of 1943, now Captain Stewart was selected to be the operations officer of the 703rd Bomb Squadron, 445th Bomb Group destined for England.\n\n7 National Museum of the United States Air Force, https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/196679/brig-gen-james-m-stewart/ accessed 11-23/2022"
