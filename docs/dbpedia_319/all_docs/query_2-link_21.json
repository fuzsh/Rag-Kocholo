        "text": "The Artist\n\nMaynard Dixon once expressed the “real nature” of the American West in a Los Angeles Times interview this way: “That sense of sun and space and silence — of serenity — of strength and freedom — if I can interpret that with what I can master of technical requirements, I will have reached the best of my endeavor.”\n\nDixon took his time realizing that goal, constantly learning about his subject matter through real-life experience. For more than 50 years — from the late 19th-century until his death in 1946 — he produced a body of artworks admired for their sensitivity, masterful technique and lasting relevance. That sense of genuine connection to the land and people of the Southwest makes his lovingly preserved home a worthy stop.\n\n“Dixon understood and painted the inherent modernism of the desert,” says Donna Poulton, curator and co-author of “Painters of Utah’s Canyons and Deserts,” which references Dixon at length. “The minimalism of the cubed landscape appealed to him,” she explains, adding that the “subjectivity in his art was informed by the sparseness of the era and the landscape was an echo not only of the desolation but also the promise. None before him understood the brute grace of the West, and I would venture to say that few since him have been able to capture it so well.”\n\nBorn in Fresno, Calif., in 1875, Dixon was a charismatic figure known for his candor and trademark cowboy attire, including a black Stetson, cowboy boots and a sword cane topped with a thunderbird — his chosen symbol. He traveled extensively, crossed paths with other iconic 20th-century artists, married three times and fathered three children, all while living a life steeped in poetry and Western lore.\n\nAbove all, he was always an artist, beginning with an early career as an illustrator of Old West themes. While his subject matter remained consistent, his art evolved dramatically over time as he developed a distinctive, boldly modern style.\n\n“Why do people say Maynard is a ‘Western’ artist?” asks Paul Bingham, who delivers encyclopedic knowledge of Dixon in a characteristically wry tone. “He is not a Western artist. He is an artist in the West.”\n\nBingham adds that Dixon “uses his subjects to make statements about perspective and composition because they work in the composition as a whole.” Bingham goes on to declare Dixon “the most important modernist in the West. If you look among painters who work in abstraction, the name Maynard Dixon will always come up.”\n\nWhat would it be like to see the world from such an inspired point of view? Time to get a glimpse for yourself.\n\nThe Museum\n\nAs I discovered on my spontaneous visit, Dixon’s home has a magical quality. The log home, guesthouse and studio are imbued with a sense of warmth and creative energy. It’s easy to imagine Dixon and Edith Hamlin — his third wife and fellow painter — sitting by the fire, strolling along the Virgin River, picking apples, or gazing at cream and rust-colored sandstone buttes. As Donna Poulton eloquently puts it: “There is some allure, some calming bewitchery, that the property offers up to you. Time stops with the mountains, the imagination of Dixon painting, the large sky and creek surrounded by cottonwoods — there are few lovelier places on Earth.”\n\nDixon first visited here in 1933 with his second wife, famed Depression-era photographer Dorothea Lange, and their two sons. He and Hamlin eventually moved to Mt. Carmel from San Francisco in 1939, staying in Southern Utah during the summer months. By that time, Dixon’s health was failing, so the couple split their time in the warm, dry environs of the Utah retreat and a winter home in Tucson, Ariz. During those years, they painted landscapes throughout the area including many of Dixon’s popular images of Zion National Park. Upon Dixon’s death in 1946, Hamlin scattered his ashes at Mt. Carmel and installed a memorial plaque on site.\n\nToday the Dixon property is managed by the Thunderbird Foundation for the Arts, a nonprofit established to maintain the home and grounds. Founded in 1999 by Paul Bingham and his wife, Susan, the Thunderbird Foundation provides tours of the property, hosts visiting artists and events and operates the adjacent gallery featuring works for sale by artists focused primarily on Western landscapes. “We bought that property from a passionate perspective,” says Paul, who was Edith Hamlin’s art dealer in San Francisco. Their commitment is evident in every detail, from the organization’s thunderbird namesake and logo, to the contemporary yet rustic aesthetic of the gallery, to placement of objects in and around the Dixon home."
