In fact, some even study cryptozoology, which Merriam-Webster defines as the study of and search for legendary animals. Basically, folkloric creatures whose existence have yet to be proven.\n\nUsing analytics from Wikipedia pages of cryptozoological creatures, Insider Data determined which urban legends Americans can't stop talking about, based on how many edits pages of cryptids received, as well as how frequently the pages are edited.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nBigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and Yeti are among the most popular urban legends, according to the findings. Other cryptids that people can't get enough of are the Mothman, the Mongolian Death Worm, and the Jersey Devil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep reading to explore the stories behind 20 of the most popular legends and their accompanying cryptids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie, is part of a famous tale about a sea monster that lives in Loch Ness, Scotland.\n\nAccording to Scottish folklore, a monster known as Nessie, or the Loch Ness Monster, lurks in a lake called Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, sightings of her may go back to the Pict (ancient people who lived in eastern Scotland), as stone carvings of a \"mysterious beast with flippers\" have been discovered.\n\nThe earliest written mention of the legend comes from the year 565, when a man known as Saint Columba spotted a monster in Loch Ness that was going to attack a man swimming in the lake. Legend has it that Columba successfully commanded the monster to retreat, according to PBS.\n\nIn the 1930s, the legend of the Loch Ness Monster grew in popularity — and though some scientists claim the Loch Ness Monster may be a giant eel, the legend is still widely held onto today. In fact, Nessie has been estimated to bring Scotland £40.7 million ($50.6 million) in tourism money annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe yeti is thought of as a hairy, white-furred creature that lives in the Himalayas.\n\nYeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is supposedly a large and hairy human-like entity that roams the Himalayas.\n\nThe Yeti creature is rooted in folk stories of communities in eastern Nepal that may have once been passed down among generations to scare people from wandering too far into the mountains.\n\nThe first supposed Yeti sighting occurred in 1921, when a British explorer, Charles Howard-Bury, climbed Mount Everest and found large footprints that apparently were described as belonging to a \"man-bear snow-man,\" according to BBC. The legend continued through the mid-20th century, with mountain explorers eager to come across the infamous creature.\n\nDNA of supposed hair, teeth, fur, and feces samples of the legendary Yeti creature show that the folklore is likely based on Himalayan black and brown bears, according to National Geographic — but the legend of the Abominable Snowman continues to live on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first reported chupacabra attack was in Puerto Rico in 1995. Since then, there have been alleged sightings of the blood-sucking critter across North America.\n\nThe legend of the chupacabra, Spanish for \"goat-sucker,\" is believed to have originated in Puerto Rico, where the blood-sucking creature was reportedly first spotted in 1995.\n\nWhen it was first documented, the chupacabra was said to have four legs, wide, dark eyes, and three fingers. It also was described as having spiky hair on its back and small air holes in place of a nose, and being a vampiric creature that drained goats and other small animals of their blood.\n\nIn the late '90s, the story of the chupacabra became local legend in Puerto Rico, with stories of its original sighting appearing on talk shows and in the media.\n\nThe next sighting wasn't until the mid 2000s, according to Benjamin Radford, a paranormal investigator and the author of \"Tracking the Chupacabra.\" That's when the creature supposedly reemerged as a hairless, coyote-esque animal.\n\nWhen alleged cupacabra bodies turned up, scientists DNA tested them, identifying them as normal animals that were affected by sarcoptic mange — their hair and fur had fallen out.\n\nHowever, mysteries and theories about the creature keep the legend alive to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMothman is a winged creature at the center of an iconic legend from a small town in West Virginia.\n\nThe Mothman is part of a local legend in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Made popular by \"The Mothman Prophecies,\" a book by John Keel, the Mothman is thought to resemble a cross between a man and a brown or reddish moth with wings.\n\nLegend has it that the Mothman has been lurking around West Virginia since the 1960s. One of the first purported sightings of the winged creature was on November 12, 1966, when five men were working at a cemetery to prepare a grave for burial and spotted a \"brown human being\" emerge and fly out of the trees.\n\nThe story goes that a few nights later, two young couples spotted the mysterious Mothman creature during a night drive just north of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The Mothman has been a local legend ever since, and the town draws thousands each year to the annual Mothman Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Jersey Devil, a horned, winged, horse-like creature, is thought to roam somewhere in New Jersey's forests.\n\nAlso dubbed the Leeds Devil, this creature is thought of as a winged bipedal horse — a combination that could be described as a horse-like creature with wings.\n\nThe story of the Jersey Devil has been around since the 1700s. The legend states that a woman named Mother Leeds became pregnant with her 13th child, and said \"Let this one be [a/the] devil.\" Once the child was born, it grew hooves, wings, horns, and a tail. It's believed that the legendary animal is indestructible and cannot die, despite being exorcised, shot, incinerated and declared dead.\n\nThe creature is said to have been spotted some 13 times in New Jersey. The state has embraced the legend so much that they named their hockey team after it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kraken is described as a sea monster or giant squid-like animal that lurks in the oceans.\n\nAccording to legend, the Kraken is believed to be a giant sea creature with tentacles that lurks in the depths of the ocean.\n\nThe story of the Kraken supposedly stems from Nordic tales that describe monsters with huge tentacles that roamed the sea. A Danish historian, Erik Pontoppidan, described the creature in detail in an account from 1755, saying the monster was \"round, flat, and full of arms.\"\n\nThen, in 1857, the remains of a creature believed to be a giant squid were spotted by a Danish naturalist, Japetus Steenstrup, who supposedly saw the large sea creature's beak that had washed up on the shores of Denmark.\n\nSteenstrup's observations of the giant squid are believed to be connected to early descriptions of the Kraken — but the tale of the cryptid is still very much alive today.\n\nThe Bunyip is believed to be a giant cat-like creature with horns that is the subject of Australian Aboriginal folklore.\n\nThe Bunyip is said to be a lake and cave animal that lives somewhere in Australia. It stems from an Aboriginal folktale, which describes the creature as a monster that lurks around swamps and lagoons, described as having a long neck and a body similar to that of an ox, hippo, or manatee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgopogo is supposedly a lake monster that swims in the Okanagan Lake, Canada.\n\nCanada's lake monster, known as the Ogopogo and also referred to as N'ha-a-itk or Naitaka, is supposedly lurking in the Okanagan Lake, near Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThough the legend of the Ogopogo has been around for centuries, one of the earliest modern mentions of it was in 1978, when self-proclaimed legend hunter Bill Steciuk spotted what he believed was the mysterious creature while driving over the lake on a floating bridge.\n\nSteciuk now runs Ogopogo Quest, which documents what he calls \"credible reported sightings.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegend has it that the Mongolian Death Worm is a headless worm found in the Gobi Desert that emits electricity and a lethal venom.\n\nAlso known as Allghoi-khorkhoi or Olgoi-khorkhoi, the worm-like creatures are believed to roam the Gobi Desert in China and Mongolia.\n\nThey are described as a red-colored, headless worms that emit electrical charge and a poisonous venom that can lead to instant death for any other creatures that come close. According to Mongolian folklore, the worms hide in the sand, creating underground tunnels of sorts.\n\nThough it appears there has yet to be a documented sighting or encounter with one of these cryptids, lore surrounding the infamous creature lives on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassive felines known as British big cats are said to roam the English countryside.\n\nCalled British big cats or phantom cats, these legendary creatures have been aptly described as very large cats that resemble mountain lions, pumas, or panthers.\n\nIn 1983, a farmer in the southern English countryside supposedly found that 100 of his sheep had been killed over a period of three months by a mysterious animal. The slaughter was said to confirm many people's suspicions of the legendary British big cats, of which sightings have been reported since the 1970s.\n\nIt's believed that the legend comes from a wildcat species that roamed England in medieval times, but some studies from more recent times suggest that the British Big Cat might just be a descendant of the Canadian lynx, a giant cat brought to England more than a century ago. Either way, fears and tales of the large feline figures are still discussed to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hairy, human-like creature known as a Yowie is believed to roam around Australia.\n\nThe Yowie is described as a \"large, hairy, human-like entity\" that roams Australia. The legend of the Yowie stems from Aboriginal tales that describe the beasts as \"hairy men\" lurking around different parts of Australia in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nAustralia's Woodenbong village in New South Wales was supposedly the site of an early Yowie sighting in 1928, when a man named Bob Mitchell supposedly spotted a hairy, gorilla-like monster that was about seven feet tall.\n\nThere were two other reported Yowie spottings in the 1970s in the same region, which has led to Woodenbong being dubbed the capital of Yowie country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fouke Monster is described as a primate creature that was reportedly spotted in the city of Fouke, Arkansas, in the 1970s.\n\nAlso called the Southern Sasquatch, the Boggy Creek Monster, or the Jonesville Monster, this legendary creature has reportedly been spotted in and near the town of Fouke, Arkansas, multiple times over the years.\n\nThe first sighting of the hairy monster was supposedly in 1946, when the creature was seen in nearby Jonesville, Arkansas. It was spotted again the 1960s, according to Animal Planet, but it didn't make headlines until the early 1970s, when it supposedly attacked the home of a local family.\n\nPeople still claim to spot the Boggy Creek Monster today, and he has been the subject of five feature length films including 1972's \"The Legend of Boggy Creek.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp is said to be a scaly reptile creature that lurks in the town of Bishopville, South Carolina.\n\nThe legend of the Lizard Man started with a strange occurrence in the town of Bishopville, South Carolina, in 1988.\n\nThe story goes that a man named Christopher Davis got a flat tire while driving near the Scape Ore Swamp.
