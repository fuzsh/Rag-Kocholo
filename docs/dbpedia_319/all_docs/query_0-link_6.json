The address Lost Memory posted is correct.\n\nThe theater was scheduled for a fall, 1965, opening, according to an item in the May 31, 1965, issue of Boxoffice Magazine. The name had not yet been chosen. The drive-in was being built by National General Corporation, and was slated to accommodate 1,182 cars. The architect was Gale Santocono, of San Francisco.\n\nDishpanHands on\n\nNYozoner I just saw your message, thank you! I was so curious that I went to the State Library to look at the old phonebooks to see if I could find it. It was indeed the one you say, and was listed under “Mather Auto Drive” with the phone number 363-5959. It didn’t list the address other than “Folsom Blvd.” I did see it mentioned in a few old drive-in journals for the trade.\n\nMichaelKilgore on\n\nThe April 6, 1966 issue of Motion Picture Exhibitor, AKA the 1966 Theatre Catalog, gave the new Thunderbird a full page. The photos have already been posted here, and here’s some of the text:\n\nFox West Coast Theatres' new Thunderbird Drive-In represents an investment of approximately $600,000 in land and structures. Architext Gale Santocono of San Francisco drew the plans for the 1,182 car drive-in, located on Folson Boulevard at Sunrise Avenue, east of Rancho Cordova.\n\nIts 74-ft. high screen tower has a special corrugated facing which curbs distortion at extreme side viewing angles. A chain link fence, with redwood fillers, is 22 ft. high to mask auto lights on the Boulevard. The entire ramp field, including driveways, is surfaced in asphalt paving meeting roadway standards."
