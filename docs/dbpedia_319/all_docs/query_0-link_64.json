        "text": "The United States Air Force Thunderbirds are nearing the start of their 2019 air show season, and have already made two public appearances with flyovers of Super Bowl 53 in Atlanta and the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Florida. They’ll make their third public appearance on Sunday, March 3, with a fly over of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and then on Monday, March 4, the team will make its fourth public appearance of the year.\n\nMonday, March 4, the Thunderbirds’ signature Delta formation will fly over the premiere of “Captain Marvel” in Los Angeles around 5:30 PST. However, around 12:15 PST that same day, the Thunderbirds will first conduct a practice flyover of the premiere followed by a round robin over Los Angeles. They’ll fly over the the Santa Monica Pier, Pepperdine University, Hollywood Boulevard, the California Institute of Technology, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and finally, they’ll fly over the home of Major Stephen “Cajun” Del Bagno’s parents just north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Thunderbirds have a newfound connection with Marvel and their newest movie, “Captain Marvel,” after the loss of Major Stephen “Cajun” Del Bagno. Major Del Bagno worked as a consultant for the upcoming film, in which star Brie Larson plays an Air Force pilot who ends up as the hero. Larson trained under Major Del Bagno for her role in the film.\n\nIf you’re anywhere near Los Angeles next Monday, you’ll get one heck of a show both in the morning and in the afternoon. Stay tuned to our website and social media for the latest updates and coverage of Monday’s flyover."
