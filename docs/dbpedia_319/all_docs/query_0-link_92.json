        "text": "By: Jim Benning\n\nRedondo Beach Chamber of Commerce\n\n1 of 1\n\nThe Beach Boys not only produced lasting songs, but they also offered an enticing glimpse of the United States.\n\nEarly 1960s hits such as Surfin’ U.S.A., Catch a Wave and Little Deuce Coupe evoked a world of sunny California beaches, tanned surfers and classic cars. By the mid-1960s, the band was creating increasingly complex music, too, including the multilayered, psychedelic hit Good Vibrations and Pet Sounds, which many critics regard as one of the best pop albums ever recorded. Their music made the band a global phenomenon: In all, the Beach Boys sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Fans can explore Beach Boys history, and the surf scene the band celebrated, in coastal communities near Los Angeles, California. Here are five great places to start.\n\nBeach Boys Historic Landmark\n\n3701 W. 119th St., Hawthorne\n\nMost of the Beach Boys grew up in Hawthorne, a suburb of Los Angeles near the beach. Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson lived in a two-bedroom house on 119th Street, and it was here in 1961, while the Wilsons’ parents were on vacation, that the band recorded its first song, Surfin’.\n\nThe house no longer stands — it was torn down during the 1980s to make way for a freeway — but a historic landmark with a bas-relief of the band now marks the site.\n\nThe Beach Boys Historic Landmark in Hawthorne, a suburb of Los Angeles.\n\nView more\n\nFosters Freeze “Hamburger Stand”\n\n11969 Hawthorne Blvd., Hawthorne\n\nA short drive from the historic landmark is Fosters Freeze, a fast-food stand frequented by the Beach Boys that still serves hamburgers and ice cream. It’s believed that Brian Wilson spotted a young woman driving her father’s Ford Thunderbird here — a sighting that inspired the 1964 hit song Fun, Fun, Fun and its opening lines:\n\nWell she got her daddy’s car\n\nAnd she cruised through the hamburger stand now\n\nDozens of Fosters Freeze restaurants still operate in California.\n\nManhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach\n\nWith their wide beaches, fishing piers and substantial populations of surfers with “bushy bushy blonde” hairdos, these three adjacent coastal towns located several kilometers from the Beach Boys’ childhood home are ideal places to soak up the sunny California beach scene immortalized in the band’s music.\n\nBoth Manhattan and Redondo are mentioned in the Beach Boys’ classic Surfin’ U.S.A. According to the song, if everybody had an ocean, then everybody would be surfing “all over Manhattan” and “Redondo Beach L.A.”\n\nThe only member of the Beach Boys who surfed was drummer Dennis Wilson. Wilson rode a longboard with blue stripes that came from a surf shop in Hermosa Beach called The Outrigger. The shop was at 2606 Hermosa Ave. but is no longer there.\n\nParadise Cove\n\n28128 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu\n\nIn 1962, Capitol Records photographer Ken Veeder shot a series of now-classic photos of the Beach Boys at Paradise Cove, a picturesque spot in Malibu about 50 kilometers from the Hawthorne landmark. Band members wore plaid shirts and khaki pants, and they posed with Dennis Wilson’s surfboard on a yellow pickup truck adorned with palm fronds.\n\nOne of the most famous images from the shoot became the cover of the band’s first album, Surfin’ Safari. Another photo from the session — of barefoot band members standing on the shore and holding the surfboard — appeared a year later on the cover of the album Surfer Girl.\n\nIn fact, Paradise Cove isn’t much of a surf spot — the water is generally pretty calm — but visitors can enjoy a meal in the cafe and take in great views of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nChez Jay Restaurant\n\n1657 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica\n\nOpened in 1959, this restaurant and dive bar located a couple of blocks from the sand in Santa Monica was a favorite hangout of Dennis Wilson. Because the main room has changed little over the years, Chez Jay is an ideal place to end a day exploring Beach Boys history.\n\nAccording to legend, Wilson once started a fight here when he dived over a small wall. Look closely at the many photos hanging in the restaurant, and you’ll spot one of a bearded Wilson at the microphone. He’s wearing a Beach Boys T-shirt."
