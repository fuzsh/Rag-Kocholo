        "text": "Ever since he was a Van Nuys High student who’d hitchhike to the Samuel Goldwyn Studios to polish the rides of TV superproducers Quinn Martin and Aaron Spelling, Mike Hoback’s life has been driven by cars — and Hollywood.\n\nAs a young man, the Panorama City native cared for expensive vehicles belonging to George Kennedy and Farrah Fawcett, Martin Scorsese, Alice Cooper, Robert Redford, Goldie Hawn and countless others.\n\nSince 1982, his Cars on Camera business has provided rare old autos for some 200 films, TV shows and commercials. They range goes from the 1980s “Batman” films to the upcoming season of “American Horror Story.” The 2000 remake of “Gone in 60 Seconds” paid for the house Hoback bought, not far from the one he grew up in.\n\nBut the just-released “Ford v Ferrari” movie, for obvious reasons, is the project Hoback views as the peak experience of his career as a broker between classic auto owner/collectors and the studios that want to put their cars on screen.\n\n“The ‘Batman’ ones were fun, ‘The Green Hornet‘ was OK,” Hoback said. “This was the most fun because I had the most, rare Ferraris on it.”\n\nHoback expressed this in all sincerity, even while a couple of Rolls Royce convertibles and a 1957 Cadillac Eldorado – complete with tailfins and a Mark IV air conditioning unit — gleamed expensively in the driveway of his otherwise modest property. The 1982, magnolia-colored Corniche had just finished standing in for Jerry Buss’ wheels on Adam McKay’s upcoming movie about the 1980s L.A. Lakers, “Showtime.” The others belong to director Richard Donner, whom Hoback’s worked with since the 1988 Bill Murray comedy “Scrooged.”\n\nFor “FvF,” which chronicles the Ford Motor Company’s mid-1960s efforts to build a race car that could challenge the dominant Ferrari line at such punishing contests as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the broker rustled up:\n\nA 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB SEFAC;\n\nA ’57 Ferrari 625/250 Testa Rossa;\n\nA ’62 MG; and\n\nAn array of other vintage ’50s and ’60s sport cars.\n\nMatt Damon plays legendary automotive designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale the pugnacious driver Ken Miles, who together develop the GT that eventually takes on the Italians in James Mangold’s film.\n\nHoback, who claims to have access to more than 2,500 choice rides from Southern California owners, got the Ferraris from Bruce Meyer. He’s a founding chairman of L.A.’s Petersen Automotive Museum – where his Ferraris used for the movie are currently on display with some other relevant vehicles, like the first production Shelby Cobra – and not one to lend out his precious machines for just any show.\n\n“I’ve known Mike over the years,” Meyer said. “He scouts cars for film and I hear from him with regularity. I’m very selective about where I put my cars, I almost never lend my cars, but this particular film resonated with me and the way my cars were being used in the film, I thought I’ll go with it.\n\n“I think Mike does a good job,” Meyer added when asked if Hoback took good care of his vehicles, but noted that for extra protection he sent a guy of his own to mind his “Ford v Ferrari” cars on location. And with good reason, even though Hoback has a sterling reputation for returning the show vehicles he oversees to their owners in the same condition that they were driven or trucked to the set.\n\n“They were both famous cars because they were raced at Le Mans,” Hoback said of Meyer’s Ferraris, one of which he guestimated was worth $40 million now. “It wasn’t a routine show because of the amount of money they had in cars. Every car was worth $1 million-plus.”\n\nOf course, the real Ferraris weren’t driven for the film. They adorned a sequence shot at several locations in Pomona, Pasadena and Glendale that recreated Enzo Ferrari’s villa-like auto factory in Italy. Hoback also provided a Mercedes Gullwing, Lancia, some Jaguars and other Benzes to park in Enzo’s courtyard.\n\nAll of the cars that were raced or prototype-tested in the film were replicas. Not cheap to make, but at least when they got dinged or destroyed, it wasn’t a tragedy.\n\nOne vintage vehicle Hoback brought in, however, was driven in the film – poorly…and on purpose.\n\n“I had a ’62 MG for the scene where Ken Miles, who’s working as a mechanic at the time, tells its owner he doesn’t know how to drive the car right,” Hoback said. “The guy says ‘You don’t treat your customers like this!’ and goes peeling out. The (actual car’s) owner was there the day they shot that; he laughed and said ‘I treat my car worse than this!’”\n\nHoback said he’s never had a problem providing productions with a car they wanted. Asked if he could come up with, say, a rare McLaren racer, the broker said he could think of three.\n\nStudios cover insurance costs and usually pay in the mid-four-figure range per day to rent a classic car. Hoback takes around a quarter of that in commission and the rest goes back to the owner. In the case of “Ford v Ferrari,” that made for a very personally rewarding experience — along with all of the racing history and high style automotive goodness that went with the production.\n\n“I just lost my American Bulldog,” he said, showing a picture of the departed dog Boo. “One thing that was great about this movie was during that time, he got cancer. I was able to give him his cancer treatments, which were a whole lot of money. So the money that I got for ‘Ferrari’ was almost heaven sent.”\n\nHoback has four other dogs; he likes to say he works for them.\n\nBut what, we wonder, does this expert at finding the best and rarest of great automobiles drive himself?\n\nWell, guess you could say it’s kind of a classic.\n\n“I’ve had some classic cars – two Mercedes 600 Pullmans, a ’61 Cadillac, ’60 Thunderbird,” he noted. “But I never have time for my own cars anyway, I’m so busy with everyone else’s cars.\n\n“I drive an ’87 Camry; it ‘s great!” Hoback concluded. “I get in that car and I’m the most comfortable. In the others, people are constantly looking at you and want to take pictures.”"
