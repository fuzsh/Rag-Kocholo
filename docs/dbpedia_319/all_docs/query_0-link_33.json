        "text": "For over forty years, the Beach Boys have been the all-American rock group, promoting surfing, cars, girls and especially California. With many hit records since the early 1960’s and lasting still today, the Beach Boys and their music will never go out of style.\n\nThe Ford Thunderbird is also a lasting piece of American culture. Immortalized in films such as American Graffiti and songs like “Fun, Fun, Fun”, the T-bird has always been one of Ford’s most popular cars. So much so, that recently Ford has introduced a new retro styled Thunderbird that draws its inspiration from this model car.\n\nIn 1991, this 1955 T-Bird, formally owned by Beach Boy, Dennis Wilson, underwent a complete frame-off restoration. As you see, the car is now in better than showroom appearance. The final touch is the hood, autographed by the Beach Boys."
