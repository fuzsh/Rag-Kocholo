        "text": "The MLM - GCI is currently closed for the 2024 cycle and not accepting further applications at this time. Interested applicants are welcome to connect with the Thunderbird Admissions department for updates regarding future MLM - GCI cohorts.\n\nThe Master of Leadership and Management with a concentration in Global Creative Industries (MLM-GCI) is for creatives seeking management training and managers who lead creative teams. It is designed for individuals pursuing global leadership and management careers within film-television-new media, music, gaming, design, architecture, fashion, dance, theater, fine arts, themed entertainment, sports, e-sports, advertising, branding, as well as the Metaverse economy which ranges from Web 3. AI, and Blockchain to Extended Reality (XR) inclusive of immersive technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The program is a unique collaboration with ASU's Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts.\n\nThis 11-month graduate degree program delivers leadership and management fundamentals for success across sectors (business, nonprofit, and government) as well as a digital Global Mindset and holistic approach to the global creative industries.\n\nIn this program, students will gain the hard and soft skills needed to navigate and thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (i.e. finance, accounting, marketing, data analytics, negotiation, cross-cultural communication, etc.) and gain an understanding of how creativity really works. Students attain a comprehensive set of practices that fosters generative and sustainable innovation and implementation geared towards opportunity recognition within tomorrow’s increasingly cross-border and trans-industry marketplace. The program prioritizes industry immersion in every class and focuses on the nexus of art and commerce, emphasizing creativity for managers and management for creatives.\n\nThe MLM-GCI course schedule is a hybrid mix of in-person class sessions and asynchronous online learning modules that students can take at their own pace. Nine of the ten courses take place at the ASU California Center, located in the historic Herald Examiner Building in downtown Los Angeles, and one course is conducted at Thunderbird’s new, most technologically-advanced Global Headquarters in downtown Phoenix, Arizona."
