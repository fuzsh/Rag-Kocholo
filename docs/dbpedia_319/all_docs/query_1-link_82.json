        "text": "The last of the Corpus Christi drive-in theaters came tumbling down on May 4, 1998. That’s when workers razed the 70-foot tall concrete building and screen of Thunderbird Drive-In at 4910 Leopard Street.\n\nThunderbird Drive-In\n\nThe Thunderbird Drive-In opened in the fall of 1948 on the old Highway 9, now known as Leopard Street, near the intersection of Navigation Boulevard. The theater, originally named the Corpus Christi Drive-In, was built by Charles A. (Doc.) Richter. The theater was remodeled and renamed Thunderbird Drive-In in 1967 by Johnny Blocker, who had previously built the Viking Twin, Twin Palms and Surf theaters.\n\nIn a 1997 article, Method Snapka, owner of Snapka’s Drive Inn Restaurant, recalled the heyday of the drive-in theater down the block. Cars lined Leopard Street waiting for Thunderbird to open for a night of cheap family entertainment. (They didn’t mention that drive-ins were also a haven for necking teenagers, and later for adults-only X-rated films).\n\nMore: #TBT: Snapka's Drive Inn has pleased Corpus Christi palates for nearly 70 years\n\nOther drive-in movie theaters\n\nThe first drive-in theater, Texas Drive-In, opened in 1939. Like Thunderbird, it was also on Highway 9, but was west of Navigation Boulevard and was also built by Charles Richter.\n\nThe Twin Palms was in the 4700 block of Agnes Street. The Buccaneer and the Gulf were on South Port Avenue. Ayers Street had two drive-ins also, the Surf at the 4600 block and the Viking Twin in the 5300 block. The Boulevard was on Lexington Boulevard, now South Padre Island Drive, where the Corpus Christi Trade Center stands. Lexington was in the 6200 block of SPID. And further in town, the Osage was on Staples Street at Everhart Road.\n\nMore: #TBT: What's that park called again? The origin of some Corpus Christi park names\n\nThunderbird Flea Market\n\nFor a time in the late ’70s and 1980s, the Thunderbird Flea Market operated on the grounds during the daylight hours Saturdays and Sundays. Vendors came from all over to hawk their wares. There was fresh fruit and honey, kitchen items and furniture, handmade toys and paper flowers, and lots of secondhand clothing. Shoppers and vendors alike loved the atmosphere.\n\n“Sometimes I sell, and sometimes I don’t. It’s all in the luck, but this is the best flea market in town. More people come here,” Ofelia Cantu told a Caller-Times reporter in a Jan. 31, 1980 article.\n\nMore: #TBT: What's that park called again? The origin of some Corpus Christi park names\n\nIn 1990 the Thunderbird market combined with the Stardust Flea Market and continued for several years before petering out.\n\nThe Thunderbird Industrial Park opened after the theater was demolished in 1998. Although it was just another job for the demolition workers, several recalled their childhoods as they operated the wrecking ball. Floyd Green told the reporter about visiting a friend whose backyard had a clear view of the Thunderbird screen.\n\nYou couldn't hear it real well, but you could kind of make out what was going on,\" Green said. \"It's a sad thing to see this go. That's progress, I guess.\"\n\nAllison Ehrlich is the archive coordinator for the Caller-Times. Contact her at allison.ehrlich@caller.com and follow her on Twitter @CallerArchives."
