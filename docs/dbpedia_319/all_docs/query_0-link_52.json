        "text": "I drove past Humberside Airport recently and spotted a giant Thunderbird Three model just randomly sitting in the airport. Of course I stopped for a photo and found it in quite a sorry state but since then I have fallen down bit of a rabbit hole trying to track the history of this brilliant oddity\n\nMy main questions which remain are:\n\nDid this actually come from a movie / TV show as multiple people claim?\n\nWhere did it come from before 2005?\n\nHow big is this model? 30ft, 50ft or 60ft?\n\nIf y'all have anymore info or photos please do share\n\nu/Gr33nLavaLamp let me know about the July 2004 Thunderbirds Three promotion at Trafalgar Square (2004) for the movie. So this is likely the origin of this model.\n\nNeat Timeline\n\n2023 - Thunderbird Three is sitting in Humberside Airport in a sorry state\n\n2009 - Ian Paterson takes a photo of Thunderbird 3 at Humberside Airport\n\n2008 - Thunderbird 3 sold by Blackpool for five-figure sum to anonymous buyer\n\n2006 - Rocket receives Picasso makeover\n\n2005 - Introduced in 2005 as part of the Blackpool Illuminations Festival Of Light.\n\n2004- Trafalgar Square Promotion for movie\n\nSo the complete timeline as I can figure out is this\n\n2023 - Thunderbird Three is sitting in Humberside Airport in a sorry state\n\n2022 - u/kumquat_may posts \" I found Thunderbird 3!\" to Reddit\n\n2021 - Jonathan L. Howard Tweeted an extremely useful tweet about its journey.\n\n2019 - Thunderbird Three is already starting to deteriorate but Chris Procter states that\n\n\"Thunderbird 3 seen here as gate guard at Eastern Airlines offices at Humberside Airport. This 30ft model of Thunderbird 3 was used in the 2015 movie remake of the Thunderbirds and has now become quite an attraction with people on Humberside\".\n\nHowever there was no movie in 2015, only the beginning of an animated TV show so I can only guess he meant the 2004 (oh god it was that long ago) movie\n\n2015 - Humberside Airport Travel announced \"Thunderbird 3 is currently at Humberside Airport\"\n\n2015 - GrimsbyPacer takes picture of Thunderbird 3 at Humberside Airport.\n\n2013 - In Humbar before deterioration\n\n2010 - Chris Hall takes photo of Thunderbird 3 outside the Eastern Airlines hangar at Humberside Airport\n\n2009 - Ian Paterson takes a photo of Thunderbird 3 at Humberside Airport\n\n2008 - Thunderbird 3 sold by Blackpool for five-figure sum to anonymous buyer\n\nAccording to this article its now reported as an 60ft figure but it was sold at auction for at least Â£10,000\n\n2007 - Virtual Globetrotting - daggerwell\n\nRocket from the TV series 'Thunderbirds' erected as part of 'Blackpool Illuminations Festival of Light'. Originally red and white but now painted with images from Pablo Picasso's 'Guernica' and renamed 'Guernica Three'.\n\n2006 - Rocket receives Picasso makeover\n\nThe figure is now reported as 50ft and was apparently introduced in 2005 as part of the Blackpool Illuminations Festival Of Light. In 2006 it was repainted with scenes from Picasso's painting Guernica. Additional photo. Another photo\n\n2005 - Moved to Blackpool as part of The Blackpool Illuminations Festival Of Light.\n\n2004- Trafalgar Square Promotion for movie\n\nAdditional stuff\n\n2009 - Matthew Wells states that\n\nFor several years, Blackpool had a model of Thunderbird 3, taken here between Central and North Piers, it later moved down towards the pleasure beach\n\nI just enjoyed getting to go rambling through old websites and old photos tracking down a niche oddity I found."
