        "text": "It was the time of day when I switch from reporter mode to dad mode, deciphering homework and getting the latest details on playground drama − there's going to be a new girl, and my daughter had already decided to be her best friend.\n\nAfter two weeks of waiting and mostly silence from the producer of the indie psychological horror movie, \"The Beldham\" filming in Bartlesville − and after only texting him every day − I didn't want to be pushy. I finally got the text, \"Possible to come by today? I'll be back on set in 10 minutes.\"\n\nFor the past couple of weeks as filming was going on, I was patiently waiting for my opportunity to visit the set and get photos. In their defense, I was warned that it could be at a moment's notice.\n\nBack to reporter mode and off to the old downtown house most people know as the Manning home, where 90% of the film was taking place.\n\nUpon arriving at the set between Frank Phillips Home and Hope Presbyterian Church, trailers filled the driveway and crew members were busy loading and unloading equipment. A quick negative COVID test gave me the all-access pass I needed.\n\nRandy Wayne, one of the producers, told me there are two types of movies, those with a budget over a million dollars and those under a million − this was under. Even with a \"smaller budget,\" the set had a crew of over 45 and was full of activity.\n\nWayne of Thunderbird Films had moved from Los Angeles to Oklahoma after 18 years of being in the film industry because he \"got to put down roots and still do what I love.\"\n\nI toured the set, met the crew, director and some actors, and enjoyed hearing all about the plot of \"The Beldham\"; sorry, no spoilers.\n\nEvery day, the crew is on set for \"12 hours plus 30\" minutes. They could anticipate each other's movement. I, on the other hand, was often standing in the wrong place and constantly apologizing as the crew flowed around the set moving cameras, lights and set pieces.\n\nThe crew was mainly from Oklahoma, but oddly one was from Canada; she is working to be an audio technician but doing set construction on the next film because she built her own home once.\n\nRichard Song, a set production assistant from Tulsa, got into the movie business because \"a friend of a friend of a friend\" needed help with filming a trailer for the FX series \"Reservation Dogs,\" which is filmed in Oklahoma and streams on Hulu. One day Song hopes to make his own movies, but passion projects don't pay as well for him just yet.\n\nFrom the bartender turned key production assistant to the University of Oklahoma Gaylord College of Journalism major who called my job difficult after she worked 12-hour days for three weeks straight, each crew member I met seemed to fall into the movie game in a similar \"just kinda happened\" way.\n\nOften I would be speaking with the crew and they would suddenly freeze, slightly tilt their head and look off to the side as radio chatter went off in their earpiece; they would either run off or act as if nothing happened. The crew was a family and their love for each other and the film kept them fueled for long hours.\n\nThe whole evening I was there, I kept repeatedly hearing that it was \"Patty's\" birthday and they were getting her a cake. I had no clue who \"Patty\" was, but I did learn she had spent her last three out of four birthdays in Oklahoma working on films. What a trooper, I thought.\n\nI didn't want to ask who \"Patty\" was because I didn't want to spoil the surprise by accidentally asking \"Patty\" about it herself. And nobody wants to be that person.\n\nAfter I gathered with the entire crew outside and the candles to the cake were lit, I felt it was safe. I leaned over to the producer and asked, \"Ummm, who is 'Patty'?\"\n\nWell, it turns out, \"Patty\" is the three-time Emmy Award-winning actress best known for her portrayal as Debra Barone on 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and as Frankie Heck on 'The Middle.'\n\nAs the crew parted to reveal the big surprise, a sudden realization came over me as a grateful Patricia \"Patty\" Heaton came out of her trailer and immediately started hugging everyone along the way to her cake.\n\nNow in the know, I enthusiastically joined the crew in singing a rousing rendition of \"Happy Birthday' to the beaming actress, and I snagged a photo for my collection."
