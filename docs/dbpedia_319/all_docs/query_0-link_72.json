        "text": "Atomic Cartoons is a Canadian animation studio founded in 1999 by Trevor Bentley, Mauro Casalese, Olaf Miller, Adam Ronald, and Rob Davies.[2][3] Based out of Vancouver, British Columbia, it produces service animation for a wide variety of clients, as well as creating its own properties. Since 2015, the company has been owned by Thunderbird Entertainment.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe studio was founded in March 1999 by Trevor Bentley, Mauro Casalese, Olaf Miller and Rob Davies.[5] Sent back to Vancouver after losing his job at Warner Bros. Animation following the cancellation of Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain, Davies received a phone call from Sunwoo Entertainment's Jae Moh to help produce Template:Interlanguage link. Together with former Studio B Productions colleagues Miller and Bentley, as well as animator/character designer Casalese, the four launched Atomic Cartoons to assist in creating the series.[2]\n\nBetween 2004 and 2008, the company produced Atomic Betty for Teletoon in association with Breakthrough Entertainment and Tele Images Kids. Atomic's first fully original creation, the show's titular heroine served as the studio's mascot for a number of years.\n\nIn 2010, Miller left to launch his own studio. The following year, Jennifer McCarron was appointed head of production.[6] On July 8, 2015, Atomic Cartoons was acquired by Canadian production company Thunderbird Films.[4] The three founders remain on board. McCarron was named president and chief executive officer in 2016.[7]\n\nIn December 2018, the company opened a second animation studio in Ottawa, Ontario.[8] Its first project is the Netflix-original The Last Kids on Earth. By June 2020, the Ottawa location is expected to have 130-150 employees.[9]\n\nIn February 2020, Atomic Cartoons opened its third studio in Los Angeles, California.[10]\n\nProductions[]\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited (1999–2001)\n\nCourage The Cowardly Dog (1999–2002, additional storyboards only)\n\nMilo's Bug Quest (1999–2000) (character, prop and background designs, and storyboards)[11]\n\nTimber Wolf (2001)[12]\n\nDoodlez (2002–2004)\n\nMax & Ruby (2002–ongoing, in association with Nelvana, seasons 6–7 only)\n\nAtomic Betty (2004–2008) (for Teletoon)[13]\n\nJohnny Test (2005–2014, seasons 1 and 4-6 only)\n\nCaptain Flamingo (2006–2008) (for YTV)[14]\n\nCrash of the Titans (2007, intro movie only)\n\nWorld of Quest (2008–2009)\n\nClick and Clack's As the Wrench Turns (2008)[15]\n\nCrash: Mind over Mutant (2008, cutscenes only)\n\nBabar and the Adventures of Badou (2010–2015, in association with Nelvana)\n\nTransformers: Rescue Bots (2012–2016, season 1 only)\n\nCaptain Cornelius' Cartoon Lagoon (2012–2014)\n\nRocket Monkeys (2013–2016)[16]\n\nAngry Birds Toons (2013–2016, episodes 41; 43; 45-46; storyboards for episodes 51-52)\n\nElla the Elephant (2013–2014)\n\nMariachi Zombie (2013, scrapped project)\n\nMixels (2014–2016, season 1 & Mixel Moon Madness! only)\n\nSpace Racers (2014–ongoing, uncredited)\n\nChub City (2014, scrapped project)\n\nLittle Charmers (2015–2017, in association with Nelvana)\n\nPirate Express (2015)\n\nFive Alarm Funk 'Robot' (2015, music video)\n\nNico Can Dance!
