        "text": "NEW: Survey results reveal that 72% of voters support #CALeg reforming the Private Attorneys General Act. Voters across the political spectrum support empowering state regulators vs. the current lawsuit-first system. #FixPAGA https://bit.ly/4c4ARwt Voters were initially asked if they would support legislation modeled after the provisions of the PAGA initiative, which is currently eligible for November 2024 ballot. The proposal is supported by 72% of voters, including: 84% of Democrats, 64% of independent voters and 56% of Republicans. After a simulated campaign, with voters hearing equal support and opposition arguments, 64% of voters continue to support the proposal. It’s long past time for #CALeg to act and create a better, fairer system for workers, small businesses and non-profits. #FixPAGA\n\n8\n\n1 Comment\n\nHighlights from the DOJ OpenJustice Los Angeles County Crime statistics: • Violent crimes reported in the county reached 61,193 in 2023 – UP 12% from the 54,600 reported in 2020, the year Gascon took office. • Robberies reported in the county reached 17,635 in 2023 – UP 16% from the 15,221 reported in 2020. • Property crimes reached 256,613 in 2023 – UP 20% from the 213,377 reported in 2020. • Shoplifting in L.A.

The time for action is now, and fortunately, Whittier has a mayor who is committed to restoring safety to their city, unlike Mayor Bass of Los Angeles. While Governor Newsom's directive to clear homeless encampments may not bring about significant change, there is hope for Whittier. The homeless industrial complex, which has squandered taxpayer dollars for over a decade and led to a decline in residents' quality of life, must be dismantled. It's high time for substantial change.

Read our full response here: https://lnkd.in/gVQmgqyd \"The Governor said this #CABudget lays out a long-term, multi-year strategy. Children’s #HealthEquity is always a multi-year strategy. He is making a choice to cut the very programs families depend on to raise healthy, thriving children. Instead, California will spend billions of dollars on tax breaks for high-profit corporations.” - Mayra E Alvarez We're deeply disappointed Gov. Newsom didn't include ➡️$$ to safeguard #HealthCare coverage for young children ➡️thriving wages for community health workers ➡️reliable internet access for families These would build #HealthEquity for historically marginalized communities of color. California has the resources to create #HealthEquity for children & families – now we need the courage. CA must consider new, progressive revenues rather than weaken the critical services families rely on.

This event will feature presentations by the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Attorneys'​ Offices. In the ongoing struggle to protect and advance civil rights, these institutions play a crucial role in upholding the law and ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected and preserved. Please stand with us as we empower our community and forge a safer Washington. This call to action is not just an invitation—it's a moral imperative for everyone who believes in justice and equality. Your presence and support in this monumental effort, united by a shared vision of love and resilience, will ensure our future is undeniably brighter than our past.

She used to run three California agencies: My Donor Cycle, Surrogacy Beyond Borders and Expecting Surrogacy. We have never worked with any of those. Without commenting on the case (as Ms Markowtiz is entitled to the presumption of innocence), intended parents must take extreme care when dealing with surrogacy agencies abroad, including ensuring that thorough due diligence is undertaken. Australian intended parents have been burnt by dodgy surrogacy agencies before in places like the US, Mexico, India and Greece. While most surrogacy agencies are reputable, regrettably some are not. The idea that there is a government guarantee of surrogacy agencies anywhere in the world is fanciful. There remain sharks in the waters, lured by big easy money from those desperate to become parents. Always take care. If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. It is a criminal offence in the ACT, QLD and NSW to enter into commercial surrogacy arrangements overseas. Those living in the NT, SA and WA may also be committing criminal offences in engaging in commercial surrogacy overseas.\n\n1\n\nOver 1,000 organizations across California agree: We must #ProtectFURS Yesterday, through The Children’s Movement of California, over 1,000 organizations signed on and sent a letter to Governor Newsom urging him to keep the Family Urgent Response System in the state budget. The in-person helpline specifically designed to support foster youth and caregivers is currently proposed to be eliminated. This collective show of strength sends the clear message that California should never abandon foster kids to balance its budget. View the letter in its entirety here: https://bit.ly/4adlgcD We are hopeful tomorrow's release of the #CABudget May Revision will show FURS has been reinstated, and the collective voice of over 1,000 organizations has been heard. If it does not, we will remain vigilant and continue fighting for foster youth through all the final budget negotiations.

In a statement, Rebuild Local News President Steven Waldman said, \"This is a historic milestone for the bill… While further negotiations with various stakeholders are expected, this decisive action sends a powerful message: something must be done, and major tech companies must be part of the solution.\" Learn more: https://lnkd.in/gnDcV_E8 #California #Journalism #LocalNews #Tax #Tech #Media #RebuildLocalNews\n\n12\n\nDisability Rights California (DRC) and Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) are urging lawmakers to not pass laws against wearing masks during public protests. People with disabilities have the right to participate in the community safely during the ongoing pandemic. State and local governments are increasingly proposing mask bans as a response to public protest. Mask bans are laws that make it illegal for people to wear masks in public. These laws make it harder and even impossible for disabled people and their allies to access public spaces – including collective actions for the expression of constitutionally protected speech – without fear and harassment. They put disabled people and their family members at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Wearing a mask is not a crime. People who wish to wear a mask to protect themselves from infectious diseases at protests or anywhere else have the right to do so.

Our Election Administration report in Nevada sheds light on the vote counting and certification process in Nevada to support advocates, litigators, and journalists who are best positioned to counter existing threats. Also in the report, you’ll find a detailed timeline of post-vote processes, a research database of election officials, and information about the offices and personnel who oversee counting and certification. https://lnkd.in/eugcmX6f\n\nPublished Friday in our print edition and available now online, “Caught In The Crosshairs” is a new series on gun violence by staff writer Robert J. Hansen. It explores the impact of gun violence on the Black community in Sacramento and was funded by the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2024 California Health Equity Impact Fund. Gun violence remains a major concern in Sacramento, particularly for the African American community which, despite comprising 12.6% of the county's population, represents about 52% of all gun-related deaths. It's important to note the disparity in the resolution of homicide cases, with nearly twice as many cases involving black victims remaining unsolved. Prevention programs such as Advance Peace have shown success in reducing violence, yet more needs to be done. Accessibility of firearms to youth, especially stolen guns, is a major factor contributing to the violence. Strikingly, guns reported as lost or stolen are significantly more likely to be used in a crime. A 2024 UC Davis Health study proposes tracking the movement of firearms for effective prevention. Initiatives such as Brother to Brother are also playing a significant role in mentoring young men to avoid the path of violence. What strategies do you think could effectively reduce gun violence in communities? 🔗: https://bit.ly/3U2WyWp\n\n16"
