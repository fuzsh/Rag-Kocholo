        "text": "This was definitely a prank. Danny and Rusty didn't want Linus in on every meeting, but Linus insisted he be involved. So they pre-arranged with Matsui to start a Zen-type discussion about, basically, nothing. At the end, they were to make it look as if Linus' ramblings almost cost them a job, in the hopes that Linus would back away from his desire to be involved with these types of meetings.\n\nYou may recall at the end of the movie, Linus discusses this meeting with his mom, who refers to it as the \"Lost In Translation\" gag.\n\nI agree with one of the other comments, the whole conversation was nonsense, the real meeting occurred at another time without Linus.\n\nHowever, what I don't get is how Linus, who is supposedly a master thief and very smart, didn't pick up on this immediately. Why would he even try to quote poetry if he realized the conversation had no apparent meaning?\n\nI think the scene was simply written for humor, with no real reasoning behind it, either for Linus or anyone else.\n\nThe number one reason I can think of: Rusty and Daniel just enjoy screwing with Linus, just like their fake fight during Ocean's 11 where they pretend to boot Daniel out of the entire heist.\n\nIt has a meaning, Danny and Rusty told Matsui about their plan. I'll quote it:\n\n\"A doctor who specializes in skin diseases...will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television. Later, he will wake up in front of television...but not remember his dream.\", said Rusty.\n\nThe Doctor he meant is the Night Fox, the plan is to deceive Night Fox, to make him think that everything he does is according to his plan, to make the illusion that the Night Fox has control on Ocean's, where actually has not.\n\n\"If all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery...then Thanksgiving and Halloween...would fall on the same date.\", said Danny.\n\nThe animals here are Danny and his friends, they will try to pretend that they are a bunch of losers and the Night Fox is a lot better than them. If that works, then when they're captured by the police that is also when they have the chance to run away from the law, their exit strategy.\n\nI don't know what Matsui said about her uncle though, that's why I'm here."
