        "text": "Filmmakers Marilyn Swick and Laurie Koons use Plymouth Beach as a location for their children-themed mermaid short 'Ocean Child'\n\nPLYMOUTH — Once the whales started showing up in the waters off Manomet this summer, it was predictable as the tides that mermaids would soon follow.\n\nAnd they did.\n\nOnly they swam a little further up the coast to Plymouth Beach about a month after their fellow, though - no offense - less adorable, mammals had moved on.\n\nTheir arrival didn’t go unnoticed.\n\nSeveral mermaids chilling out on large rocks with their colorful fins and decorated faces is enough to draw attention, but with one of them playing the saxophone, their cover was bound to be blown.\n\n“There were so many people gathered at beach to watch us film,” filmmaker and Plymouth resident Marilyn Swick said. “I think we got the last great weekend in September.”\n\nThe unexpected sight was one of several scenes filmed in Plymouth for the upcoming short film “Ocean Child,” which Swick co-wrote with Laura Koons, her creative collaborator of seven years she met while living in Texas.\n\nOther scenes and scenery were filmed in Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nWhile Hawaii and its beaches are indisputably beautiful and warm, Swick said filming at Plymouth Beach was perfect for what she had in mind.\n\n“We chose Plymouth Beach because the rocky beaches would best serve to showcase our mystical mermaid cove, and we loved the rocks,” she said.\n\nThe cast of “Ocean Child” traveled from Hawaii, around New England, Texas and Virginia for the shoot.\n\nThe storyline follows Hope, a young \"merhuman\" (part mermaid, part human) attending the underwater School of Mermaidology and Neptunism, an enchanted school for people like her.\n\nThe film follows another short of theirs from 2017, “To Wish Upon a Starfish,” which first established Hope’s character and background.\n\nOn the first full moon Hope's 10th birthday, she is gifted with knowledge of her mermaid heritage. She is furthering her mermaid education requirements, which includes learning spells, by attending the school.\n\n“They’re only good spells, only happy things and enchantments,” said Swick, who noted romance comedies, fantasy films and family movies are more to her taste than horror or action flicks.\n\nOn the eve of her 18th birthday, she must choose to either reside with the merpeople or remain human for life.\n\nSwick said the initial short was filmed as a “proof of concept” piece, highlighting the characters and key elements of the idea to present for further development as a full-length film, or as Swick and Koons hope, a series on a streaming service.\n\n“Ocean Child” characters include Queen Amara of the Seven Seas and Aria, the school’s music teacher who sings and plays a magical saxophone.\n\nSwick plays Hope’s grandmother Serena, who was the original Queen of the Seven Seas. She is also a merhuman, as was her son, Hope’s father, but she gave up her mermaid life when she fell in love with a sailor on the Navy ship The Blue Ghost.\n\n“The best part of writing the concept was researching the fascinating mermaid legends and folklore from around the world,” Koons said. “It was so interesting to learn how many remain enchanted by mermaids and how these stories transcend us universally.”\n\nThe latest screenplay has already been winning nominations and awards across the film festival circuits for the past several years, as have a number of her other projects.\n\nSeveral New England-area actors and crew members were brought in for the project, and Swick and Koons are pleased by both the quality of who they found and what their work on the movie represents.\n\n“As female screenwriters, directors and producers, it was important to us that our New England-based crew was primarily female,” Swick said. \"I’m super excited about our mostly female crew. It’s not always easy to find a female cinematographer, sound engineer, gaffer and grip.”\n\nEditing has started already started, she said, adding it is on time to be completed by Dec. 1.\n\n“Ocean Child” will begin its journey in the Academy Award-qualifying film festival circuit in 2023 with the hope it is optioned by one of the networks.\n\nWhile Swick is a SAG-AFTRA actor, screenwriter, songwriter, director and producer, as well as serving on the Board of Women Songwriters Hall of Fame, that’s not her day job, nor is it her only passion.\n\nShe and her husband, Dr, Todd Swick, a neurologist specializing in sleep disorders, were lured north by the state’s host of pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories. They each work in the field for companies based in Boston and Cambridge. She is a senior project manager at Clinilabs, and he is a senior medical director at Takeda.\n\nShe also raises show horses in Texas, where they remain year round.\n\n\"It's too cold up here for them,\" she said.\n\nShe is similarly devoted to her two retired grand champion Dobermans, Zoey and Lexi, the latter of whom plays Hope's trusted companion, mermaid tail and all.\n\nSwick said she and Koons are ready for the work ahead, if for no other reason that they believe their story of self-learning and acceptance is just the right remedy for the times\n\n“It’s a beautiful mystical mermaid story that spans generations, ethnicities ability, ages and genders,” Swick said. “We feel like it’s time for a story like this again.\"\n\nBesides, she asked, \"Who doesn't love a good mermaid story?\"\n\n."
