The festival is organized on the occasion of the Our Ocean World Conference, which is hosted by our country and will take place on the same days in Athens.\n\nThe Our Ocean Film Festival seeks to raise awareness and public participation in the global dialogue on the protection of the marine environment through the Art of Cinema. In this way, viewers of all ages will have the opportunity to enjoy, with free admission, Fiction – Documentary – Animation – Short Videos – Audio & Visual Installations and to talk to the filmmakers – directors of the films, who will be present to present their research and works.\n\nThe outstanding Greek and international productions that will be presented at the festival highlight critical problems – and solutions – for protecting the seas and addressing climate change through ocean conservation.\n\nThe rich screening program includes, among others, the acclaimed documentary DEEP RISING, narrated by Jason Momoa, and introduced by the film’s director Matthieu Rytz and Palau President Surangel S. Whipps Jr. Also screening will be the documentaries Brave Blue World starring Liam Neeson and Matt Damon, BLUE CARBON by Nicolas Brown produced by CNN, and THE PRISTINE SEAS project produced by National Geographic and presented by its creator-explorer, Enric Sala. It is worth noting that several First Screenings will also be presented at the Festival.\n\nThe Our Ocean Conference was launched in 2014 as an initiative of the US Department of State and has now established itself as a global forum for dialogue, bringing together representatives from governments, international organizations, academia, NGOs and young people to take action to protect the oceans. Ten years later, Greece, as the host country of the Our Ocean 2024 Conference, wishes to give an anniversary character and through parallel – cultural activities to involve society in the dialogue for sustainable management and protection of the marine environment.\n\nThe Our Ocean Film Festival is under the auspices of the Ministries of Culture, Environment and Energy, Shipping & Island Policy and will be hosted at the Athens Concert Hall in the Dimitris Mitropoulos Hall from 15 to 17 April, from 12:00 to 21:00, with free admission. The films are subtitled in English.\n\nThe international film festival Our Ocean is organised with the support of the Greek Actors’ Association, the Greek Directors’ Association and the National Centre for Audiovisual Media and Communication.\n\nCommunication sponsors: ERT, Proto Programma 105,8, Athinorama, Athens Voice"
