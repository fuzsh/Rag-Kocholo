        "text": "Everyone try and remain calm as we tell you some very exciting news, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are officially teaming up once again, and this time the Barbie duo will be starring in an Ocean's Eleven prequel. Ok, you can start screaming now.\n\nThe currently untitled movie was first announced in May 2022 and since then we've been desperate to find out more details. What will the film be focusing on? And who can we expect to see staring alongside Margot and Ryan? Here's everything you need to know about the Ocean's Eleven prequel.\n\nWhen was the Ocean's Eleven prequel confirmed?\n\nFans of the Ocean's series will be pleased to hear in May 2022 the Hollywood Reporter confirmed Warner Bros would be heading into production on a prequel for Ocean's Eleven, which was released in 2001 and starred George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.\n\nMargot Robbie was confirmed to be producing and starring in the film and will be producing alongside her husband Tom Ackerley.\n\nDirecting the new movie will be Jay Roach, who previously directed Margot in the 2019 film Bombshell. Carrie Solomon will be writing the script.\n\nWhat is the Ocean's Eleven prequel about?\n\nWhen the film was initially announced all that was mentioned about the plot was that it would be set in Europe in the 1960s.\n\nSince then director Jay Roach has given a few more hints about what we can expect in the movie, telling Associated Press in June earlier this year, \"It’s a heist movie still, but it’s very much a love story.\" He also cited Hitchcock’s To Catch A Thief as an inspiration for the movie.\n\nThe Associated Press has now confirmed the movie will be set in Monte Carlo in 1962.\n\nWho is starring in the Ocean's Eleven prequel?\n\nOur favourite on-screen duo Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are officially set to appear on-screen together after it was confirmed Ryan would also appear in the movie in August 2022.\n\nRoach explained there was some initial hesitation about casting the two together, but knows there's an interest to see their partnership again.\n\n\"Originally there were some questions about whether it would be weird to have [Robbie and Gosling] together again after Barbie. But I think there’s just some pairings you want to see again and again,\" he said.\n\nSo far no other cast members have been announced, and given the film is a prequel to the 2001 film it's unlikely to star the cast members of the other Ocean's films.\n\nWe'll still keep our fingers crossed for a George Clooney cameo though."
