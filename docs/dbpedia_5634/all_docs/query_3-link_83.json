        "text": "⊥ (This Contains Some Plot Spoilers)\n\nThis past weekend, the highly awaited ‘Ocean’s 8’ had a box office opening of $41.5M, beating out ‘SOLO: A Star Wars Story’ & ‘Deadpool 2′ for the #1 spot.\n\nI caught a screening and absolutely loved it! As someone who has always enjoyed the thrill of stealing a lil’ somethin’, somethin’ from capitalist fueled entities. It was a sight to see 8 glamorous, professional criminals pull off the biggest jewel heist in fictional history!\n\nI admittedly have never seen any of the movies in the Ocean’s franchise, which wasn’t an issue at all. ‘Ocean’s 8’ is definitely a stand alone film and rarely makes reference to the characters in the other films. Prior to the film’s release, I knew in my heart that the best part of the movie would be Rihanna. I was right, I just didn’t know how much I was going to love her character 9-Ball.\n\n9-Ball\n\n9-Ball is a master hacker with beautiful faux locs and dry wit. The plan is to rob the famous Met-Gala of it’s jewels on the 1st Monday of May. The Ocean’s team hire 9-Ball to hack into the Met Museum’s camera system. When we first meet 9-Ball, she is brought into headquarters for an interview. She instantly lights a joint and proves to the team that she can easily hack any system. Not only is she able to reconfigure complicated security systems while stoned, but she insists that everyone call her 9-Ball, when no one else has a code name. Yes, sis! Make them say your name!\n\nMaking S.T.E.M Sexy!\n\nOkay so yes, Rihanna’s character is technically a criminal and we have no idea how or why she got into the hacking game. This itself is worthy of a 9-Ball spinoff movie explaining her backstory. In most film’s I’ve seen, hackers are usually presented as either slovenly white males or nerdy Asian males. Usually definitely male tho. I feel like had I seen a smart, funny, and beautiful character like 9-Ball when I was younger, I might have been more interested in computer science. Hopefully girls will see this movie and think to themselves “Hey, I can be a part of a cyber criminal enterprise too!”, graduate at the top of their class, get accepted into M.I.T and discover more legit computer science careers.\n\nHer Fake Met-Gala Look Became One of Her Best Met Gala Moments\n\nJust when the audience starts to think that 9-Ball won’t make an appearance at the Met-Ball, she appears like a vision in red. Her crimson Zac Posen ball gown and her long flowing locs is one of Rihanna’s best Met Gala looks, and it wasn’t even the real event. This look, however, will live on forever in cinematic history and was beautiful enough to give Guiliana Rancic flashbacks of how racist and wrong she was in 2015.\n\nSo if you haven’t seen ‘Ocean’s 8’ yet, what are you waiting for!? Grab your Fenty slides, put on some Fenty lip gloss and check out Rihanna as 9-Ball A.S.A.P!"
