        "text": "This is my understanding of how the robbery took place. Rusty gives Benedict the option of either loosing half the money secretly or loosing the entire money publicly. They were going to take half the money, leaving the other half as hostage, booby trapped. At least that's what they made Benedict believe.\n\nIn the recording of the tape, they were shown packing only half the money while Danny and Yen were actually packing everything. When the swat team arrives, they bring bags filled with the fliers for hookers which they then blew. So it wasn't until the swat team was out of the hotel that they find out that they had actually been robbed of the entire amount.\n\nThe entire heist could have been run from the mock up cameras....with Terry calling in SWAT, and Ocean’s team coming in in SWAT gear and taking the money.\n\nThere was one problem.\n\n'The vault doors and the time table'\n\nIf they had just showed Terry a mock up and he called SWAT, there would be no way for Danny and his team to enter the VOLT. Sure the could use C4, but you’d ruin the money as well.\n\nSo the movie is correct that they needed Yen on the inside to place precision explosives, as well as Danny and Linus in to bag the money up-remember Terry went down to the vault within 2 minutes.\n\nSo in short, pulling the heist would be impossible without entering the real vault.\n\nWhen the swat team and Benedict showed up at the vault after the explosives were detonated, there were no suspects in the vault and no clear way of how they got out (because the three people had joined the swat team). They made the recording so that when Benedict found out it was a recording, it was an explanation to why there were no suspects as he thought that he was not getting robbed at the same time that he saw the recording.\n\nOf course this could just be a stroke of luck as the Belagio inscribed on the floor had been installed earlier that week (Benedict says: \"It was installed on Tuesday\" when talking to Walsh). They could have been unaware of this and not included it in the replica of the vault, or they could have been aware of it and purposely not included it so that Benedict would notice. It is a small plot hole but not as major as the mystery of how the fliers got into the vault that were sent up in the elevator and into the van."
