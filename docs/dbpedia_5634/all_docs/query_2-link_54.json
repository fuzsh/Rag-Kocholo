        "text": "Movie Review\n\nMaster thief Danny Ocean and his crew have been enjoying the fruits of their $160 million heist from a Vegas casino (glorified in Ocean’s Eleven), but suddenly each of them gets a visit from the owner of that casino threatening death if he does not get his money back in two weeks—with interest.\n\nOf course, being the live-for-today kind of guys Ocean’s 11 are, all but one have blown through most of their millions. They need money fast, but they’re so hot they can never work in the States again. So, they reason, why not steal the money they need from the Europeans?\n\nThe task takes them to Amsterdam, where Europol police detective Isabel Lahiri quickly latches onto their trail. (In one of several plot improbabilities, it turns out that Detective Lahiri and Danny Ocean’s right-hand man, Rusty Ryan, have a past.) Ocean’s crew also find themselves in the middle of a turf war with another mysterious master thief who goes by the nom de guerre Night Fox.\n\nAs the unfolding confidence game careens from Amsterdam to Paris to Rome, Ocean tries to coordinate an impossible heist while staying one step ahead of everyone—the cops, rival robbers and the ruthless casino owner.\n\nConclusion\n\nA not-very-good sequel to 2001’s Ocean’s Eleven, itself a remake of the 1960 caper flick starring Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack, Ocean’s Twelve drops all pretense of justifying grand larceny. In the ’01 version, it was “good” crooks robbing a really bad crook. Here they’re in it primarily to save their own skins when that really bad crook decides to get revenge. But they don’t let that get in the way of their egos and pride—never mind greed.\n\nSetting aside for a moment the atrocious moral message of the 2001 film, it at least did a good job of capturing the artistic tone of the 1960 version, both with its ultra-cool musical score and its snappy dialogue. Comparatively, Ocean’s Twelve falls flat on its Botox-injected face. And it contains so many leaps of logic and improbable plot developments (not to mention several unanswered questions) that by the end you’re left shaking your head in confusion. (If you’re still awake.)\n\nEven knowing that, people will still flock to see it. So what is it about heist films that makes them so popular? Stephen Hunter wrote in his New York Times review of The Italian Job, “As is often the case with the caper genre, the criminals are painted as likable rogues whom you’re encouraged to champion simply because they’re good at what they do.” That’s certainly true with Ocean’s Twelve, which does all of that and more, upping the charm ante with a cast crammed with A-listers.\n\nIn the end the crooks get away with their crime—not just with their skin intact, but with bundles of booty and villas on the Côte d’Azure. The final scene shows Danny Ocean’s crew yukking it up in luxury with expensive cigars and flowing champagne. And who joins them? None other than Detective Lahiri, who apparently decides she’d rather live with “likable rogues” than enforce the law—a real crime of a moral."
