It's called Deep Star Six (1989), and its about a deep sea military base which loses contact with its support ship due to a storm, and its inhabitants discover and battle an alien/undiscovered deep-sea creature.\n\nI saw this movie as a kid, at least 15 years ago but I remember it pretty vividly. I'll have to watch it again to see how accurate my memory is :-)\n\nIMDb Storyline:"
