Dive into these ocean documentaries.\n\nCovering over 70% of the Earth’s surface and holding 50-80% of all life, it’s no wonder oceans are the subject of so many documentaries.\n\nFrom hard-hitting films about pollution and overfishing to awe-inspiring projects about marine life, the list is endless. We’ve narrowed it down to the 10 best documentaries about oceans and fish for you to stream online. Enjoy!\n\n1. Watson\n\nThis documentary follows Paul Watson, co-founder of Greenpeace and founder of Sea Shepherd.\n\nFor over 40 years, he’s been uncompromising in his efforts to protect the seas, even if that means arrest or facing violence.\n\nThis brave, relentless eco-activist goes above and beyond to confront poachers and vessels illegally fishing. Watch this compelling documentary for his story.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime\n\n2. Seaspiracy\n\nAll too often, plastic pollution dominates the narrative when it comes to ocean degradation. In Seaspiracy, director Ali Tabrizi uncovers the destructive practices of commercial fishing.\n\nFrom whaling and shark finning to overfishing, the oceans face a myriad of threats from industries that aren’t held to account. This film is sure to make you think twice about eating seafood.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n3.

Blackfish will put you off visiting marine parks again.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n4. A Plastic Ocean\n\nPlastic pollution is a topic we’re all familiar with, but A Plastic Ocean reveals the shocking extent of ocean pollution.\n\nFeaturing over 20 locations documented over four years, the film shows how widespread plastic pollution is. It’s not all doom and gloom, though.\n\nWe also hear from scientists and the people who are pioneering solutions, so there is hope!\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime\n\n5. Chasing Coral\n\nKnown as the rainforests of the sea, corals are often overlooked when it comes to their impact on the health of the oceans.\n\nIn Chasing Coral, a team of divers explore the decline in coral reef populations due to climate change and human activity.\n\nThis stunning, powerful film is a must-watch to understand ocean ecosystems and the true extent of the damage we cause to the oceans without realising it.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n6. The Blue Planet / Blue Planet II\n\nIf you’re a fan of nature and all its wonders, The Blue Planet mini-series is right up your street.\n\nDavid Attenborough narrates the spectacular scenes the oceans have to offer across multiple continents. The series captures the beauty, strength and magic of the world’s oceans, as well as showcasing the ways in which they’re threatened.\n\nWatch on BBC iPlayer\n\n7. Mission Blue\n\nIn need of inspiration? Renowned oceanographer Sylvia Earle is sure to dazzle you with her impressive career and activism.\n\nMission Blue follows her campaign to protect marine life and save the oceans from overfishing, plastic waste and climate change.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n8. The Cove\n\nLearn about dolphin hunting and the Taiji dolphin drive in The Cove.\n\nThe film documents destructive fishing practices which kill thousands of dolphins every year, providing a compelling call to action to end mass killing of these important animals.\n\nThis is a great watch if you want to gain a better understanding of majestic marine life and the threats they face.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime⁠\n\n9. MY OCTOPUS TEACHER\n\nThis Oscar-winning documentary became a viral sensation and won people’s hearts when it landed on Netflix in 2020. Octopus are among the many sealife species who are overlooked or completely forgotten when it comes to discussions about animal welfare.\n\nIt follows the story of filmmaker, Craig Foster who begins diving in a kelp forest off the coast of South Africa, and meets a female octopus who casts a spell on him.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n10. The Last Ocean\n\nThe Ross Sea in Antarctica is said to be the last ‘untouched’ ocean that can teach us about marine ecosystems, but it’s under threat from commercial fishing.\n\nThe Last Ocean documents the fishing industry’s targeting of Antarctic Toothfish and what’s at stake if we carry on disrupting the precious balance of these ecosystems.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime"
