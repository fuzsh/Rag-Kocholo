        "text": "Movie Review\n\nThe well-known and well-liked con artist, Danny Ocean, is gone. Or, at least, most people think he’s met his end and was laid to rest behind that beautiful slab of granite with his name etched in it. One of his last acts, apparently, was to send his old crime-connected compatriot , Rueben, to deliver a message to his sister Deb.\n\nDon’t, Danny essentially says from beyond the grave. Just … don’t. Sure, the crime scheme Deb has in mind is solid and clever, but Danny felt it was sure to land Deb back in the slammer.\n\n“He said you should give it up,” Rueben tells her.\n\nDebbie Ocean, however, has never been one to give up on an idea she’s sunk her teeth into. And even a loved one’s parting words don’t give her pause. She’s convinced that her thieving gambit will work.\n\nShe’s spent years of her most recent incarceration envisioning every angle. Every detail. And each time her mental machinations ended up in failure, she’d rewind and think them through again. After five years, she’d thought of every conceivable loophole, fumble and slip-up; and she’s solved them all. Her plan is perfect. She’ll even be running a con within a con, but nobody else in her crew will need to know that.\n\nDebbie’s BFF, Lou, doesn’t believe the plan could possibly be as flawless as Debbie thinks it is. Lou’s a gifted grifter herself, and she’s certain a jewel theft of the magnitude Deb’s thinking of will involve 20 or more people and hundreds of thousands of dollars in seed money. But Deb Ocean only smiles. “I need seven people and $20,000,” she declares. Her plan is measured, it’s focused. In 12 weeks, she assures Lou, they’ll all be banking a cool $16 million each.\n\nOf course, Deb stepped out through the prison gates yesterday with only $45 in her pocket. But give her a day or two, and everything she needs will fall into place.\n\nDanny’s not the only Ocean who knows how to ebb and flow.\n\nConclusion\n\nBack in the 1960s, the Ocean’s movie franchise plotted out its first big movie heist, featuring a bunch of nattily dressed, ice-coffee-cool male stars. Then in 2001, the inevitable remake of Ocean’s 11—or rather, Ocean’s Eleven—was cranked out, featuring yet another bunch of sharply dressed, attractive men scheming their way through an intricate Vegas swindle. After a couple forgettable sequels, it’s time for some felonious females to step up and join the well-dressed, crime-caper crowd.\n\nThat’s only fair, right?\n\nThe problem is, the Ocean’s con-artist construct is feeling woefully tapped out. And there are far more reasons to skip this pilfer pic then there are to see it.\n\nOcean’s Eight gathers the usual shady content suspects—foul lingo, illicit larceny, boozy tippling and light sensuality. Those things alone will make discerning viewers think twice before settling in with a bucket of popcorn. But on top of that is the fact that the moviemakers have pulled together an ensemble of very capable actresses and given them, pretty much, nothing to do.\n\nThere’s no witty repartee for them to juggle, no inventive cons for them to connive, no thrilling twists to untangle, no real positives to applaud. This whole jewel theft gambit is, well, blandly predictable and pointless. And since this cast of leading ladies represents, justifiably, the cream of today’s Hollywood crop, that might be this movie’s biggest crime."
