The documentary follows the work of people around the world who are committed to protecting the oceans. In projects that sometimes start small but have a big impact.\n\nMy German speaking friends can watch the documentary here: https://www.zdf.de/gesellschaft/plan-b/plan-b-sos-ozean-104.html\n\nThanks to all that helped with the project.\n\nTESTIMONIAL\n\n\"Chris filmed for the German public TV prime-time documentary “SOS Ocean: Help for an endangered habitat”. Therefore the visual demands could not have been higher. His camerawork was outstanding, as was his passionate commitment to telling non-fictional stories about conservation issues in a respectful and engaging manner. I could not have had a better DOP in Africa. I enjoyed every minute.\""
