        "text": "RYAN: Summer movies are in full swing, and up next is “Ocean’s 13.”\n\nCAROLINE: Sadly, I haven’t gotten to see it yet, but this one looks a lot better to me than the previous two have been. Your thoughts?\n\nRYAN: I have been the biggest skeptic about this series because I really hated the second one and was ambivalent about the first. But I’m here to declare, a la Criss Angel, my love – not for Cameron Diaz – but for this film. It was outstanding.\n\nCAROLINE: Oh my God! That’s certainly not what I was expecting to hear you say. I mean, how interesting can it really be to watch George, Matt and Brad tear up the silver screen for a third time?\n\nRYAN: Well, of all the Ocean’s films, this is the one to see. It’s got gorgeous locations and sets, and Steven Soderbergh did a great job directing it. He’s not my favorite director, but this is shot beautifully and the editing is excellent. And it’s surprisingly funny; I actually burst out laughing a few times.\n\nCAROLINE: That’s so great to hear. How are newcomers to the series Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino?\n\nRYAN: They are both great. Ellen Barkin is just killer. Honestly, it’s almost a perfect film. I’d give it A’s across the board.\n\nCAROLINE: I like how in the trailer you see Matt and George in funny disguises. Like Matt’s big fake nose.\n\nRYAN: There are some cool “Mission: Impossible” type moments in this movie. Since we don’t have a new “Mission: Impossible” this summer, let “Ocean’s 13” be it.\n\nCAROLINE: Will do. Bottom line?\n\nRYAN: I loved this movie. Skip the first two and see this one – it’s totally worth it."
