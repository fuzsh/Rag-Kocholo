        "text": "And yes, the heist continues...we got to about 9,500 words into the second draft with a pretty good idea of how Act I was going to go when we started getting ready to write scenes for Act II.\n\nNow, I've written myself into dead ends before by just 'pantsing' along (just writing and seeing what happens), because I didn't know how stories needed to twist and turn so I decided to try and apply the Story Grid principles I’ve been studying by Shawn Coyne and demonstrated by Tim Grahl in the Story Grid podcast. In this case that meant taking a pause to step back and go revisit the master work.\n\nI had attempted to plot the major turning points of Ocean's before but this time I went back and made a table of contents of what exactly happened in each scene. As I went I grouped the scenes into logical segments of action called sequences (represented by the horizontal color palette at the bottom of the graph).\n\nNext I set out to track whether each bit of action brought our Hero, Danny Ocean closer or further away from his main objectives in the movie. He has two: steal the cash (the A-plot) and get the girl (the B-plot).\n\nThis exercise was my attempt to sign a value from -100 to +100 tracking how close or far Danny was getting.\n\nZero serves as the baseline at the start of the movie and serves as the reference point from which every subsequent moment was tracked.\n\n100 represents the accomplishment of said objectives. The following are some interesting findings."
