        "text": "Oceans - Lyrics\n\nFirst Stanza:\n\nYou call me out upon the waters\n\nThe great unknown where feet may fail\n\nAnd there I find You in the mystery\n\nIn oceans deep, My faith will stand\n\n\"And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, \"It is a ghost!\" and they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\" And Peter answered him, \"Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.\" He said, \"Come.\" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, \"Lord, save me.\" Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\" And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, \"Truly you are the Son of God.\" ~ Matthew 14:25-33\n\nRefrain:\n\nI will call upon Your name\n\nAnd keep my eyes above the waves\n\nWhen oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace\n\nFor I am Yours and You are mine\n\n\"For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.‚Äù ~ Romans 10:13\n\n\"So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.\" ~ 2 Timothy 2:22\n\nBridge:\n\nSpirit lead me where my trust is without borders\n\nLet me walk upon the waters\n\nWherever You would call me\n\nTake me deeper than my feet could ever wander\n\nAnd my faith will be made stronger\n\nIn the presence of my Saviour\n\n\"For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.\" ~ Romans 8:13-14\n\n\"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\" ~ Isaiah 40:10\n\nThe Story Behind Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)\n\n\"Oceans\" by Hillsong United tells the story, as told in Matthew 14:22-33, of Peter called by Jesus to walk on the water. The disciple did so, but temporarily lost faith and began to sink, so he was compelled to call on Jesus to rescue him. According to Hillsong, it's a song \"about stepping into the unknown and a song about faith and trust.\"\n\nThe vocalist is Taya Smith, a newcomer to the Hillsong team. She sang the whole song in one take.\n\nHillsong Music is Christian music produced by Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia as well as offshoot churches, Hillsong London and Hillsong Kiev. Hillsong albums are released and distributed by Hillsong Music. The main groups are Hillsong Worship, Hillsong United, Hillsong Young & Free, and Hillsong Kids.\n\nHillsong Church's popularity in Christian praise and worship music stems from the inauguration of the Hillsong Conference in 1986 and the first publication of choruses written by Hills CLC members, especially Darlene Zschech. It is in this context that Hillsong Music was founded in 1991. Their first live worship CD The Power of Your Love was released in 1992. Since then, live praise and worship albums have been produced each year. Other music series include the Worship series, United, Youth Alive, Hillsong Kids, and Instrumental series. They have also released two Christmas albums and several compilation albums. \"What a Beautiful Name\" won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.\n\nSources: Hillsong Wikipedia\n\nWatch some of our favorite performances of this Christian song below!"
