        "text": "This week Steve Soderbergh is back in video stores with \"Ocean's Twelve,\" his hip sequel to his hip remake of the hip Rat Pack movie \"Ocean's 11.\" The whole crew has returned - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle - in a movie that attempts to catch lightning in a bottle a second time.\n\nThe original 1960 \"Ocean's 11\" was a very bad movie that was also very cool. Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and the Chairman of the Board drank, smoked and oozed Vegas charm in a sloppy heist movie.\n\nIn 2001, director Soderbergh (\"Erin Brockovich,\" \"Traffic\") remade \"Ocean's 11\" as an exciting, slick heist movie. He kept all the cool of the original and gave it a better story and a more intricate caper. There were layers upon layers of tricks and cons to obfuscate the actual theft of $160 million from a Vegas casino.\n\n\"Ocean's Twelve\" lacks the story but keeps most of the cool. We pick up where the remake left off; the 11 gang members are all very wealthy and retired into private enterprises. Malevolent casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) pays each of them a visit; he knows they stole his money, and he wants it all back in two weeks or they will die.\n\nThat's $160 million, plus juice (\"juice\" meaning \"vig\" and \"vig\" meaning \"interest\"). So Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan and the boys must hustle through a series of jobs to collect the money - which leads to another problem, as the Night Fox, the world's greatest thief, is out-stealing them. The Frenchman challenges Ocean to a contest of illicit skill.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough plot for you, Pitt's character is also trying to outwit his former girlfriend (Catherine Zeta- Jones). There are a lot of characters and too many storylines, and that ultimately bogs down \"Ocean's Twelve\" and makes it too complicated for its own good.\n\nThe best moments are the quiet character moments. Clooney and Pitt have brilliant chemistry together, and whenever the plot is given a moment's rest, the film has some very funny, charming moments. All the plots and twists and cons take a back seat to the scenes in which everyone is standing around talking - like at the train station, where the thieves try to guess Clooney's real age, or when Clooney and Pitt drink wine and watch a dubbed European version of \"Happy Days.\"\n\n\"Ocean's Twelve\" is a solid movie, a good movie, but not a great one. It lacks a certain something, perhaps because this time around it wasn't a remake but a sequel.\n\n\"Criminal\" is a remake of an Argentine con artist movie called \"Nine Queens.\" These two movies are much smaller than Danny Ocean and his gang. No multi-million dollar heists, just crooks on the street hustling for a few hundred dollars here and there.\n\n\"Nine Queens\" focused on Marcos, a veteran con man and Juan, the gifted rookie he takes under his wing. The two get caught up in a scam involving a rare sheet of stamps. But in a movie like this, you're never quite sure who is on the level.\n\n\"Nine Queens\" is a quiet movie that sneaks up on you. It moves slowly at first, but then the relationship between the teacher and student takes on new dimensions when Marcos's sexy sister gets involved. There are twists and turns galore, and a punch-out ending that is really quite hard to see coming.\n\n\"Criminal\" was remade by the same gang that remade the \"Oceans\" movies; produced by Soderbergh and Clooney, and directed by Gregory Jacobs, a longtime Soderbergh collaborator. And it has a slick look and a loose, jazzy feel as the story unfolds.\n\nThe story is a close riff of the original, with the wise journeyman Richard (played by John C. Reilly, one of those character actors you recognize but can't quite ever remember their name) teaching the hungry young Roberto (Diego Luna, in an underplayed and likable performance) how to run a short con.\n\nRichard gets a call from his sister Valerie, who has an old con/friend of Richard's at her ritzy hotel. The man has a rare piece of currency that he needs to sell that day. For a hefty fee, Richard takes over. He calls in several shady friends to pull off a high risk, high stakes scam. And Roberto, still on his first day, is along for the ride.\n\n\"Criminal\" is one of those movies where no one is quite what they seem. One of the drawbacks of \"Criminal\" is that it is obviously one of those movies, so you suspect everyone.\n\nIn \"Nine Queens\" I got suckered in and stopped trying to unravel the lies, but with \"Criminal\" I could never let my guard down. Everyone is a potential con, every line a potential lie. And it's much harder to be surprised when you're looking for the surprises. However, the cast is top notch. Reilly is a great actor and finally gets a chance to shine in the lead. The early sequences, where he teaches Luna how to run short cons, could be used as an instructional video for aspiring thieves.\n\nThe movie looks good, sounds good, feels good and plays out fast and loose without much down time. It isn't a classic (you have to watch \"Nine Queens\" to see a classic this week), but it will keep you hooked until the end.\n\nMaybe we have run out of good crimes, or maybe Hollywood is just lazy. It's easier to take a movie that's already been made and do it again than to start from scratch, but at least Soderbergh and company are taking interesting films and remaking them in an interesting way.\n\nSend smart remarks to Rewindcolumn@hotmail.com.\n\nOcean's Twelve: EEE (three Es)\n\nCriminal: EEE (three Es)"
