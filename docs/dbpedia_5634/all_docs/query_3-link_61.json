        "text": "Executive director & senior scientist, Center for Whale Research\n\nBalcomb earned a BA in zoology from the University of California, Davis in 1963 and was hired by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be a field biologist in a whale-marking program. He pursued graduate work at the University of California, Santa Cruz with Dr. Ken Norris, a renowned marine mammal biologist. Balcomb served as an aviator and oceanographic specialist in the U.S. Navy. He pioneered photo identification of cetaceans, made the first known observations of living Longman’s beaked whales, and, in the aftermath of a mass stranding of whales in the Bahamas in March 2000, helped prove that naval sonar kills whales.\n\nImogene Powers Johnson Senior Scientist at the Bioacoustics Research Program, Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\nClark helped develop and apply advanced acoustic technology to record and analyze the sounds of wildlife around the globe. His work advances the understanding of animal communication and the health of wildlife populations. He has listened to and studied whales for more than 40 years, with a focus on endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n\nOceanographer, author, and National Geographic Explorer in Residence\n\nEarle has led more than 100 ocean expeditions and logged over 7,000 hours underwater. Named a \"living legend\" by the Library of Congress, she earned a BS from Florida State University and a PhD from Duke University. Earle, who helped develop early SCUBA gear, authored more than 190 publications, including The World is Blue: How our Fate and the Ocean’s are One. In 1990, she was the first woman named chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Her goal is to “ignite public support for the protection of Hope Spots—special places that are vital to the health of the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.”\n\nDirector of marine mammals, NRDC\n\nJasny is a leading expert in the law and policy of ocean noise pollution. For more than a decade, he has directed high-profile litigation, lobbying efforts, science-based policy development, and public advocacy to improve the regulation of this emergent global problem. His work also focuses on securing protection for endangered marine mammals and their habitat, opposing development projects that threaten marine mammals off the U.S. and Canadian coastlines, and improving management of fisheries, whale-watching tourism, and other sectors that impact these vulnerable species. Jasny is the author or coauthor of numerous publications in legal, policy, and scientific journals. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a JD from Harvard Law School.\n\nMusician; human rights & environmental activist\n\nSting (Gordon Sumner) is a musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and activist. He was the principal songwriter, lead singer, and bassist for The Police. He wrote the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical The Last Ship, inspired by his experiences growing up amid the shipbuilding industry in the north of England. He founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund to help save the Brazilian rainforests and protect Indigenous Peoples, and he has supported human rights campaigns for decades.\n\nFounder and codirector, OrcaLab\n\nOriginally from New Zealand, Spong is a neuroscientist and cetologist who has immersed himself in orca research since the 1960s. Early in his career, he studied the captive orcas, Hyak and Skana, at the Vancouver Aquarium where he grew to appreciate their intellect and exceptional use of sound. He later advocated to keep whales out of captivity and in 1970 founded OrcaLab with the goal of studying marine mammals without interfering in their lives and habitat. Spong and his assistants share their research findings from the remote Hanson Island in British Columbia via live streams.\n\nProgram director, Animal rescue, International Fund for Animal Welfare\n\nAs IFAW’s program director for Animal Rescue, Moore directs IFAW’s animal rescue team and collaborates with partner organizations around the globe to save animals in crisis, including disaster response, marine mammal rescue and research, and wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and release.\n\nIn Madagascar, Moore used techniques developed by IFAW's Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team in an attempt to save more than 100 melon headed whales—deep-water animals that had stranded themselves inside an estuary. She also provided guidance in gathering data to determine the cause of the incident.\n\nExplorer, founder & president, Ocean Futures Society\n\nExplorer, editor, environmentalist, and filmmaker Cousteau has dedicated his life to communicating the critical bond between humans and the sea. The son of Jacques Cousteau, he began exploring the ocean as a young boy. He’s produced more than 80 films and received the Emmy and Peabody awards among others. Cousteau organized efforts to care for Keiko, the captive whale of Free Willy fame. In 1999, he founded the Ocean Futures Society. Cousteau is an impassioned diplomat for the environment, traveling the world to meet with everyone from school children to global leaders, urging us all toward positive change.\n\nAuthor, In Pursuit of Silence: Listening for Meaning in a World of Noise\n\nProchnik taught English and American Literature at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

He has led numerous successful campaigns, including those to protect the gray whale birthing lagoon and World Heritage Site at Laguna San Ignacio in Baja California to reduce ocean noise pollution, to protect the popular California State Park at San Onofre, and, most recently, to stop the Pebble Mine in southwestern Alaska. He has twice been selected California Lawyer of the Year in the environmental category.\n\nDirector, Imaginary Forces\n\nDougherty is an American designer and director. Born in Mexico City and raised in California, she is a graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.
