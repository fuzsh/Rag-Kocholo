        "text": "\"Thanks for being my dad.\" \"Thanks for being my son.\" Gravitas has revealed an official US trailer for an Australian coming-of-age drama titled Ocean Boy, which is the rather generic US title for this film. The original Australian title is Bosch & Rockit, which is the name of the two kids that the film is about - and it fits better than something as bland as \"Ocean Boy\". Inspired by true events, the film is stirring, provocative and peppered with laconic Australian humor, a compelling story about the light and shade of life, reflecting strength & vulnerability. In the late summer along the coast, Bosch, a young father goes on the run for drug dealing with his surf gang. In tow is his son, Rockit, who believes he's on a magical holiday. Filmed at iconic Byron Bay, against the canvas of Australia's famous east coast surf beaches and rain forests, Ocean Boy is a raw and unapologetic exploration of unconscious parenting and the deeper themes of love. Starring Luke Hemsworth, Isabel Lucas, Leanna Walsman, & Ramsus King as Rockit. Looks like it might be great.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Tyler Atkins' Ocean Boy, direct from Gravitas' YouTube:"
