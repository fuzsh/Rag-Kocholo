        "text": "You have seen a couple of movies with incredible plots. These plots clearly scream impossible when placed in our everyday environment. Yet, we get so endeared to these stories that we hope to relive the stories partly if not completely. When it pertains to betting, the environment might just be all that matters. The results you get might be more severe than in other cases when you take these stories and plans out of the casinos.\n\nA very good example of such a storyline is that of the 2001 American comedy play centered on a heist. We are quite certain that Ted Griffin (the writer of the story) only expressed his appreciation for the opportunity of flexibility offered to him by the scope of the casino setting\n\n“Ocean’s Eleven” is the first of the Ocean’s Trilogy, comprising Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve, and Ocean’s Thirteen. All of these movies made waves and grossed in a huge return in profits. The Ocean’s franchise ended with a spin-off containing an all feminine lead cast in Ocean’s 8, which was released in 2018.\n\nAbout The Plot\n\nDanny Ocean flags off the plot as he is released from jail on parole. You can bet, a leopard never changes its spots. Just after being released on parole, Danny travels to California, disregarding his parole. In California, he meets with an old-time accomplice and pal, Rusty Ryan. Together, this duo planned a heist on a number of casinos. This act confirms our previous assertion about a leopard never changing its spots.\n\nThey both travel to Las Vegas where they meet with a wealthy mutual friend, Reuben Tishkoff, who himself was a casino owner in the past. At least a bit of his past glory will come in handy, plus his wealth likewise. They set out to rob three different casinos (MGM Grand, Bellagio, and the Mirage), on the same night.\n\nP.S: All of these casinos are owned by Terry Benedict, a sore rival of Reuben. In fact, he was one of the reasons Reuben couldn’t continue his casino business. Now you see there is enough motive for him to support the plan.\n\nThe goal especially for Reuben is to run Benedict out of business as he would lack the required reserve for him to keep operating, after the robbery. On the night scheduled for the heist, there will be a highly awaited boxing contest. This implies that the Bellagio vault will contain well over $160,000,000 that night. Amazing plan you all have got there!\n\nTo get the plan to work, the addition of eight new members is made. These members worked with Rusty and Danny in the past as crime aces. Check below the list of these crime experts:\n\nLinus Caldwell, a youthful and gifted pickpocket\n\nFrank Catton, a charlatan, and a casino worker\n\nVirgil and Turk Malloy, a talented mechanic duo\n\nLivingston Dell, a whiz in electronics and surveillance\n\nBasher Tarr, a specialist in explosives\n\nSaul Bloom, an aged hustler\n\n“The Amazing” Yen, a fulfilled acrobat.\n\nAll these persons by inclusion complete the OCEAN’S ELEVEN!\n\nBefore the day, they strategically scout and explore the three trusted casinos to gain as much information as possible. They learn enough about these casino security procedures, the building, and the staff. The rest of the team build an exact imitation of the vault which will come in handy during the operation.\n\nSpoiler: All of these plans look good on paper, but not as perfect as it turns out after execution. A perfect plan followed to perfection!\n\nWhen the day came, it was nothing but a complete stroll in the Park for this group of robbers. It all went well, save for the arrest of Danny as he is reported to have flouted his parole guides. The rest of the team still escape with their loots. Danny joins them after serving his sentence completely. This denouement is truly sweet and desirable and that explains why this movie is one among the top casino films. Sadly this plan never works as it seems when brought into real life.\n\nThe Way To Earn Money In Casino That Does Not Work In Real Life\n\nThe casino setting and what is obtainable in that sphere of the world is totally different from what you get around you in real life. What is perceived as dubious and incapable of yielding fruitful results in real life turns out to be a perfect and justifiable plan judging by casino rules. The casino world is poles apart from the real-life setting. Be sure to know where you are executing your money-making plan.\n\nLife might be a risk but we cannot guarantee you that it is a similar risk to that of the casino. The way you land a massive win in real life after your endless toils are not similar to the ease the volatility of casino games provides you when you play them.\n\nWhat’s our departing note here?"
