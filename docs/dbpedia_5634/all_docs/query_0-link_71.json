        "text": "Have you ever dreamed of traveling to destinations seen in your favorite movies and TV shows? Many filming locations have become pilgrimage sites for fans. In fact, one in four travelers polled in Expedia’s 2024 Unpack travel trend report stated that screen inspirations influenced their travel decisions more than social media and podcasts.\n\nAmong those jet-setters is influencer Lindsay Silberman, who partnered with Variety and Hotels.com to plan a trip to The Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas after rewatching “Ocean’s Eleven.”\n\n“It was fun to be able to walk through the hotel and immediately spot the locations where all of the iconic scenes took place,” Silberman says. “I also found myself thinking about all the intricacies and logistics required to shoot a major film at The Bellagio. Did they have to shut down the entire property? And for how long? Did any of the staff get hired as extras?”\n\nA remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, the 2001 Steven Soderbergh film was granted permission to use parts of The Bellagio for the production, including the casino floor, conservatory and Fountains, to capture the authentic look and feel of the Sin City setting where Danny Ocean and his 10 accomplices attempt to rob casino owner Terry Benedict.\n\n“Ocean’s Eleven” was among the first motion pictures to film at a functioning hotel and casino, successfully integrating Hollywood fantasy with the real high-stakes atmosphere and excitement of Vegas. The making of the film alone attracted fans to The Bellagio, since the all-star cast and crew also lived there while working.\n\nKnown for her expertise in the travel, beauty and fashion spaces, Silberman has garnered a large following online and on social media. In 2020, she launched Hotel Lobby Candle, a line of luxury candles inspired by her love of fancy hotel lobbies. So, of course, The Bellagio’s hotel lobby bar was one of her must-visit spots.\n\n“My favorite part was having a dirty martini the size of my head at the hotel lobby bar, and then eating shrimp cocktail out of a martini glass,” Silberman says of recreating the Rusty Ryan shrimp cocktail scene.\n\nThough Ocean’s heist crew successfully ended up with millions of dollars, Silberman and her husband Matt had less luck in real life. “I sat down at a blackjack table with a group of old gents from Michigan, walked away after winning $300, and then proceeded to lose it all 30 seconds later in a slot machine,” she recalls of her “quintessential Vegas” experience.\n\nThey capped off their night at the Fountains of Bellagio, which serves as the heist crew’s respite after the job. The depiction of The Bellagio’s atmosphere still inspires travelers, like Lindsay and Matt, to experience the location firsthand and immerse themselves in the world of “Ocean’s Eleven.” Still today, memorable Vegas moments from the film capture the imaginations of audiences and sparks interests from tourists.\n\n“Honestly, the energy of Las Vegas in general — specifically The Bellagio — is pretty unmatched,” shares Silberman, who splits her time between New York City and Miami. “My husband and I kept saying there’s no other place in the world quite like it.”\n\nSilberman, who calls herself a “lifelong hotel lover,” will be releasing new scents and products in early 2024. “My brand, Hotel Lobby Candle, is perfect for anyone who craves the luxury hotel experience in the comfort of their own home,” she says. “Our scents are all inspired by five-star destinations around the world.”\n\nVariety and Hotels.com launched the new “Hotels on Screen” video series to spotlight fictional worlds where real-life hotels were used as locations and sets.
