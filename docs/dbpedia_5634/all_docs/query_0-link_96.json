        "text": "THE TOP 8 PLACES TO VISIT FROM OCEAN’S EIGHT\n\nIf you’re anything like me, you grew up obsessed with Matt Damon in Ocean’s Eleven (2001), you watched the less than perfect sequel, Ocean’s Twelve (2004), and you loved the franchise saver, Ocean’s Thirteen (2007).\n\nWhen you found out there was an all female spin-off featuring Sandy Bullock and Cate Blanchett, did you also almost faint!? Ocean’s 8 (2018), showcases some of the best the NYC has to offer. While Debbie (Sandra Bullock) was in prison she plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 mill Cartier necklace, during NYC’s annual Met Gala. Let heist begin!\n\nAlmost the entire movie was filmed on location. So, as reported by Variety, the production of Ocean’s Eight pumped $63 million of economic activity into New York! You go girls!\n\n1000 5th Ave, New York, NY 10028\n\nThe MET Gala is one of the most exclusive parties in the world, and is regarded as the “the jewel in New York City’s social crown”. It is a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute where the guests are expected to wear outfits relating to that year's theme. The whos-who of celebrities have to be approved and invited by Anna Wintour herself. With the benefit having raised $13 mil in 2018, it’s no wonder Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) wanted to rob it.\n\nThe MET is the backdrop for much of the film. The early recon scenes showcase a lot of the museum exhibits, while the final heist focuses on the glitz of the Gala. The first shot you see of the museum is when Debbie (Sandra Bullock) and Lou (Cate Blanchett) are walking up E 81 ST. They are standing on the corner of E 81 ST and 5th Ave.\n\nWhen you’re leaving The MET, I hope you feel just as glamorous as the women of Ocean’s 8 (2018), who walk out wearing $150 mil worth of stolen diamonds! These steps are iconic, so enjoy them!\n\nThe MET is featured in a bunch of other movies and shows. Most notably Gossip Girl (2007-2012), Hitch (2005), Maid in Manhattan (2002) and Night at the Museum (2006).\n\n144 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003\n\nVeselka Cafe has been open since 1954 in the East Village and locals consider it an “New York Icon”. It’s the home of NY’s most famous perogies, and lucky you, it’s open 24 hours! If you're craving Ukrainian food, you’ve hit the jackpot.\n\nDoes the name “Veselka” sound familiar to you? You might remember it as a hotspot for Brooklynites, Dan (Penn Badgley) and Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) in Gossip Girl (2007-2012).\n\n754 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019\n\nWith its reputation as one of the best department stores in NYC, of course Bergdorf Goodman is where Debbie goes shopping - or should we say, stealing. In this fantastic scene you see her shoplift all our favourite (yet not super affordable) brands like Diana Vreeland, Marc Jacob, and Burberry. It’s also right next door to our next location: the Plaza!\n\n768 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019\n\nThe Plaza is one of the most famous (aka swanky) hotels in NYC. Everyone from Christian Dior to Frank Lloyd Wright to the Beatles to F.Scott Fitzgerald have lived here. It actually is part hotel, and part luxy private residence which is why it is the perfect backdrop for characters like Eloise (from the classic children’s lit series, Eloise) who live at the Plaza.\n\nThe Plaza lobby, bookshop, and elevator are all featured in Ocean’s 8 as we see Debbie con her way into a suite. Yes Sandy! I wanna jump on that bed too. Cheers to that champagne bubble bath looking over Central Park!\n\nIf you think it looks familiar, you might remember it from that memorable scene in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), where Kevin McCallister gets directions.\n\n239 1st Avenue, New York, NY 10003\n\nOne of the best parts of this movie is that you see women eating on screen! That seems kind of random, I know, but there is a reason I mention it. Throughout film history women have notoriously not been depicted actually eating. Let alone eating hot dogs and fries!\n\nDebbie and Nine Ball (Sandra Bullock & Rhianna) go to this famous New York fast food spot while they do recon on the museum’s security team. Papaya Dog has a bunch of location, but the 1st Ave spot is where this scene takes place. They actually have a poster up in their window of Riri & Sandy, so you’ll know where to sit.\n\n1 Idlewild Drive JFK International Airport, NY 11430\n\nIn 1955, Eero Saarinen designed this famous terminal turned hotel. Now known as the TWA Hotel, it embodies the smooth lines and classic material associated with the post-modern architectural style. Saarinen tried to capture the sensation of flying through the building designs, from the organic ceiling and open interior, to the wing-like concrete shell of the roof. Although retrofitted to be a hotel in the mid 2000’s , the TWA Terminal became a symbol of the 1960’s “jet-age”.\n\nThe TWA Flight Centre sets the stage for Rose Weil’s (Helena Bonham Carter) fashion show.The building itself is actually quite famous both in the architecture and film world. You might recognize it from the Leo DiCaprio classic: Catch Me If You Can (2002).\n\n653 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022\n\nRumor has it, the Cartier Mansion was shut down for two full days during the holiday shopping season for filming. I’m sure they felt it was worth it, for the amount of publicity they got through the film. Although the main necklace in the film, the Toussaint, is fictionalized, the rest of the jewels are not! According to a spokesperson, all the other diamonds on screen are real!\n\n2911 Arthur Kill Rd, Staten Island, NY 10309\n\nThe opening scenes of Ocean’s Eight show Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) having her exit interview in prison. Her hair, flawless. One of the most fantastic scenes of the movie is watching her walk away from the prison, dressed like she’d going to a gala. This Staten Island prison has actually been abandoned since 2011. Since then it has been taken over by Broadway Stages, and has been used primarily as a film shoot.\n\nArthur Kill Correctional has been the backdrop for season 6 & 7 of Orange is The New Black (2013-2019), Daredevil (2015-2018) and The Black List (2013 - Current)."
