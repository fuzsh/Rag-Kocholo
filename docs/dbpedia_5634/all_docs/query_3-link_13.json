        "text": "Unveiling\n\nThe DeeP\n\nHow the Ocean Has Made\n\nWaves Throughout the Media\n\nDue to its vastness, endless beauty, and alluring mysteries, the ocean has a longstanding history of being a prominent focal point for science, film, television, art, and literature. From vibrant marine ecosystems to hidden treasures, the alluring wonders of the ocean have served as a canvas for both real and imagined tales.\n\nNo matter your age, there’s an abundance of breathtaking and thalassophobia-inducing media out there waiting to be explored. Join us as we dive into a historical voyage unveiling how the media affects our perception of the ocean, and explore various TV shows and films, suited to all ages, that delve into the deepest corners of the sea.\n\nHow the Media Collides\n\nWith the Ocean\n\nA Historical Exploration\n\nIn the past hundred years, many films and tv shows have taken us on voyages through the ocean, making a significant impact on the media and audiences. While oceanic-themed content has heightened our fascination and curiosity of the deep blue, it’s also induced thalassophobia, leaving audiences fearful of what lies beneath the ocean’s surface.\n\nSo, why is the ocean such a prominent theme throughout the media?\n\nBecause so little of the ocean has been explored, the imaginations of writers and directors often plunge deep into the abyss, conjuring mythical creatures, and reimagining historical tales and sea shanty’s told by explorers and pirates. Aside from fictional narratives, scientific research and sea expeditions have also facilitated a significant focus on the ocean.\n\nThe Challenger Expedition (1872 – 1876) is humanity’s earliest oceanographic program, which unveiled several new discoveries about the sea.\n\nThis expedition was instigated by William Benjamin Carpenter, an English physician, physiologist, and zoologist, who embarked on the four-year exploration under the supervision of Sir Charles Wyville Thomson, a natural historian with a specialty in marine zoology.\n\nDuring their voyage, the two explorers made remarkable discoveries which revolutionized our understanding and awareness of the liquid wilderness. Some examples of their findings included iconic sea creatures, such as the deep sea anemone, deep sea octopus, and the Seamount Squid.\n\niconic sea creatures\n\ndeep sea anemone\n\ndeep sea octopus\n\nthe Seamount Squid\n\nThese discoveries ultimately elevated society’s understanding of the ocean’s biodiversity, sparking a global interest in the deep abyss.\n\nHow Ocean Exploration Has Impacted Film & Cinema\n\nFrom enchanting cinematography to informative documentations, oceanic exploration has supplemented cinema and film in a plethora of incredible ways. While the Ocean often serves as a source of narrative inspiration for many directors, it also provides an engaging outlet for learning.\n\nBelow, is a timeline highlighting pivotal moments in cinema which have been heavily inspired by our understanding of the ocean\n\n1916\n\n1956\n\n1968\n\n1975\n\n1985\n\n1993\n\n1997\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2017\n\n1916\n\nThe first fictional underwater film, ‘20,000 Leagues Under the Sea’, is released. This film is based on the novel by Jules Verne, and tells the story of three sailors who journey through the ocean in search of a whale, but soon fall prisoner to a submarine, entitled ‘The Nautilus’.\n\n1956\n\nFilmmakers Louis Malle and Jacques Cousteau release the first documentary film about the ocean, ‘The Silent World’. The movie was filmed aboard a ship titled the ‘Calypso’, which voyaged for over two years through the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and finally, the Indian Ocean.\n\nAmid its release, the film sparked controversy because of the substantial damage it caused to the sea life, including the accidental death of a young whale and unnecessary massacre of sharks.\n\n1968\n\nDirector Alan Landsburg and filmmaker Jacques Cousteau release the first oceanic documentary television series, ‘The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau’. This 36-episode-long program ran between 1968 and 1976, with each episode showcasing geological phenomena and marine wildlife.\n\n1975\n\nCritically Acclaimed and multi-award-winning director, Steven Spielberg, releases ‘Jaws’. This film is arguably the biggest ocean-themed movie to date, which has significantly altered society’s perception of sharks and ocean safety.\n\n1985\n\nThe Discovery Channel is launched, providing audiences with daily wildlife documentaries. Due to its accessibility and widespread popularity, the Discovery Channel has significantly boosted society’s fascination with ocean-themed documentaries and TV shows.\n\n1993\n\nSimon Wincer releases ‘Free Willy’, one of the first family-friendly sea-life movies, that tells the heartfelt story of a misunderstood orphan boy and a captive orca whale. This film drew attention to the cruelty of captive sea-life, and seemingly inspired younger generations to embrace animal activism.\n\n1997\n\nWorld renowned director, James Cameron, releases one of the highest-grossing films of all time, ‘The Titanic’. This film integrates the tragic true story of the Titanic ship which collided with an iceberg and sank in 1912.\n\nDuring the movie we see an unlikely romance blossom between two young voyagers, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), which poses concern among Rose’s aristocratic family.\n\n2001\n\nSir David Attenborough releases ‘The Blue Planet’, a remarkable docuseries which becomes a landmark in marine exploration.\n\nDuring this 8-episode series, Sir Attenborough narrates an immersive journey through the deepest corners of the ocean, offering up-close and never-before-seen footage of nature’s most complex and mesmerizing aquatic creatures.\n\n2003\n\nDisney-Pixar released one of their biggest selling animated children’s movies, ‘Finding Nemo’. This film tells the story of a lost young clown fish, Nemo, and his worried father, Marlin.\n\n2006\n\nConservationist-led documentary, ‘Sharkwater’, is released, showcasing sharks in an alternative light. This film illustrates the unfortunate dangers that sharks endure everyday due to humanity and demonstrates how misunderstood these marvelous creatures are.\n\n2017\n\nSir David Attenborough releases ‘The Blue Planet II’, a sequel to the original series, showcasing recent discoveries and raising awareness about humanity’s detrimental effects on the ocean, such as increased plastic waste and toxic pollutants.\n\nHow Movies Impact Ocean Research & Engagement\n\nMovies have a substantial impact on society’s perception of the ocean. While Cinema can alter our view of the ocean for the better, stimulating our fascination for aquatic creatures, it can also bring forth fearfulness of the great unknown and encourage hatred against certain species, such as sharks.\n\nAfter the release of ‘Finding Nemo’ (2003) there was a surge in purchases of clownfish, which resulted in both animal and environmental harm. Because of this, the term ‘The Nemo Effect’ began trending.\n\nThis theory argues that the media can alter our perceptions of sea-life for the worst, resulting in detrimental damage to both underwater ecosystems and the environment. This is a primary example of how ocean-themed film and television can facilitate a negative response throughout society.\n\nHowever, mass-hysteria about the ocean isn’t always so bleak. Many progressive documentary filmmakers have created phenomenally insightful films and series, such as ‘The Blue Planet’ (2001).\n\nThis has showcased the magical marvels of the ocean, while simultaneously shedding an important light on how our daily activities, such as plastic consumption, negatively impact the ocean’s ecosystems.\n\nThe ultimate effect of this enlightenment has provoked audiences to embrace sustainable practices, and support charities and conservation projects working tirelessly to save endangered oceanic species.\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nsave ocean save ocean save ocean save ocean\n\nFamous Oceanographers &\n\nMarine Biologists\n\nOceanographers and marine biologists play a fundamental role in enabling society to understand the deep blue and the otherworldly creatures that inhibit it. Their research benefits both society and filmmakers.\n\nWhile there are many notable oceanographers and marine biologists, there are a few who stand out.
