        "text": "Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are set to reunite on the big screen. Following their mega-blockbuster \"Barbie,\" the two costars have been cast in the highly anticipated \"Ocean's Eleven\" prequel, which Robbie will produce alongside her husband, Tom Ackerley, for their production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, per Deadline. LuckyChap executive Josey McNamara is also on board as a producer, and though not much is known about the upcoming film, we have some new insight thanks to McNamara.\n\nSpeaking to GamesRadar+ in October, he said, \"I can't really say much, but I think we're just trying to do right by the franchise. I'm excited for people to experience it when it's ready.\"\n\nThe producer also talked about Robbie and Gosling's next onscreen reunion, adding, \"They're wonderful together. The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.\"\n\nBefore the latest \"Ocean's Eleven\" prequel update, Robbie addressed reports about the Warner Bros. film on Jan. 10 while walking the red carpet at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards. She coyly told Extra of her involvement, \"Word on the street may be correct, yeah . . . not much I can say just yet, but it's likely.\"\n\nThe new \"Ocean's Eleven\" movie is said to feature a storyline set in 1960s Europe. Jay Roach, who also worked with Robbie on the powerful 2019 drama \"Bombshell,\" is directing the film, and Carrie Solomon will write the screenplay, which precedes the 2018 heist comedy \"Ocean's Eight.\" According to The Hollywood Reporter, the ultimate goal was to be in production this year, but the SAG-AFTRA strike likely threw off that schedule.\n\nThe Ocean's films originally began with a star-studded 2001 comedy featuring major celebrities like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. Since then, it's evolved into a franchise; the most recent all-women spinoff, \"Ocean's Eight,\" features big names like Sandra Bullock, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, and Anne Hathaway. No matter the era, the films are known for their comedic flair, adrenaline-fueled plots, and stellar casts. Now, we're excited for Robbie and Gosling to take us back and show us where it all began."
