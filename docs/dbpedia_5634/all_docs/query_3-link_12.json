        "text": "The oceans are not only home to millions of plant and animal species but they also regulate global climate, offer food security and are vital for the economy. However, global warming and marine pollution are two major threats which need to be dealt with. Raising awareness to protect the oceans can be done through visual media, such as good movies or documentaries.\n\nIn this article, we look at 15 ocean documentaries that will change how you look at water bodies. With notable names such as Sir David Attenborough, Alastair Fothergill, Natalie Portman, and Rob Stewart, here is our list of 15 must-watch ocean documentaries.\n\n1. The Blue Planet: A Natural History of the Oceans (2001)\n\nNarrated by Sir David Attenborough and produced by BBC\n\nFrom the highly acclaimed BBC Natural History Unit, The Blue Planet has been the forerunner for documentaries on Earth’s oceans. Aired in September 2001, it is a series of eight episodes. With unimaginable footage, it pioneered underwater photography and pressed the need for informative and interesting documentaries on the topic.\n\nThe Blue Planet won critical acclaim, with multiple Emmy and BAFTA awards over its 2-month run time. Executive producer Alastair Fothergill is a common name when it comes to documentaries on nature, and he teams up well with composer George Fenton to deliver an exciting view of the oceans.\n\nNarrated by Sir Attenborough, the film faced multiple challenges, since oceanography was still a relatively unexplored field. The effort that went in the 5 years it took to film their observations can be appreciated in every 50-minute episode.\n\nSome exciting scenes were blue whale migration routes, the famed sardine run near South Africa, and the hunting of grey whales by orca. The show was a huge success, with a viewership of over 12 million people upon release. It also spawned other documentaries that focused on exploring the ocean.\n\n2. The Blue Planet 2 (2017)\n\nNarrated by Sir David Attenborough and produced by BBC\n\nFollowing the successful release of The Blue Planet in 2001, Blue Planet 2 brought back the original crew 15 years after the first season. The main addition to the team was famed composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nPremiering in early 2018, the show won the National Television Awards and the 2018 BAFTAs. Voiced in the signature style of Sir Attenborough, it focussed on different aspects of the ocean, touching upon pertinent issues such as pollution.\n\nWith filming beginning in 2013, the series revisited some sites to record changes, which took some 4,000 dives and 6,000 hours of underwater footage.\n\nCovering 39 countries, it was released in seven, 50-minute episodes followed by a 90-minute compilation. Some episodes were critically acclaimed for their message, including One Ocean, The Deep, and Mother Pilot Whale Grieves.\n\nThe main impact of this series was the awareness it raised towards plastic pollution. This led to BBC banning single-use plastic on its facilities, followed by this being implemented to some extent across the UK. It also sparked renewed interest in courses on marine biology, dubbed the “Blue Planet Effect”. The series also became a hit in China and coincided with a plan between the UK and China to tackle plastic pollution.\n\n3. Chasing Coral (2017)\n\nDirected by Jeff Orlowski\n\nFollowing the success of Chasing Ice by director Jeff Orlowski in 2012, the production team came together to work on a critically acclaimed documentary that focused on the coral reefs that inhabit Earth’s oceans. A group of scientists, divers, and photographers embarked on a mission to uncover the health of coral reefs.\n\nThey also focused on the impacts of pollution on these corals, including coral bleaching samples which they collected from over 30 countries. Collected by volunteers, the crew of the movie brought together people from diverse locations to help save the reefs.\n\nThe film was a success, winning the coveted Audience Award under the US Documentary section at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. It also sparked renewed interest in marine studies across the US. This success led the team to form the “Chasing Coral Campaign” which aims to sustain coral reefs. As an impact campaign, they use local community support to create positive changes in coral health.\n\n4. Mission Blue (2014)\n\nDirected by Fisher Stevens and Robert Nixon\n\nFollowing the life and efforts of famed marine biologist Dr. Sylvia Alice Earle, Mission Blue is a standout film that highlights the problems plaguing today’s oceans.\n\nIt looks at the problems of pollution, climate change, and overfishing, that threaten several marine species. Along with renowned marine biologist Barbara Block, the film takes on some of the most sensitive issues that need to be addressed today.\n\nWith several hundred hours of underwater footage covering locations such as Bermuda, Ecuador, and the United States, it premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Filmed along with James Cameron and Mike DeGruy, it created a major stir upon release.\n\nThe film went on to be a hit, winning the News & Documentary Emmy Award in 2015. The immense success of Mission Blue and the international awareness it raised, led to the formation of the Sylvia Earle Alliance.\n\nThis Alliance worked towards creating the Mission Blue Campaign and Group that has helped improve marine health.\n\n5. Dolphin Reef (2018)\n\nNarrated by Natalie Portman and directed by Keith Scholey and Alastair Fothergill\n\nVoiced by award-winning actress and wildlife enthusiast Natalie Portman, Dolphin Reef is a heartwarming and touching tale of a dolphin pod.\n\nSpanning the journey of a young bottlenose dolphin named Echo, the documentary covers the upbringing and eventual maturity of young dolphins.\n\nInterestingly, it also covers other marine creatures such as the peacock mantis shrimp, humpback whales, green hump head parrotfish, killer whales, and cuttlefish. The documentary was shot in and around the Red Sea.\n\nThis particular location was chosen since the dolphin pod allowed the divers to approach them. Along with the original dolphin’s tale, this allowed the film to capture other elements of life on a coral reef.\n\nIt won special acclaim as it highlighted the struggles faced by dolphins and coral reefs. Keith Scholey, the director, mentioned how during filming, the crew witnessed over 1/3rd of the coral reef die from pollution.\n\n6. A Plastic Ocean (2016)\n\nDirected by Craig Leeson\n\nA Plastic Ocean is a breakout film that raises uncomfortable questions and makes the viewer realize the extent to which pollution has harmed Earth’s oceans. Shot over several countries and their water bodies, it looks at the impact of plastic pollution and the uncertain future that awaits us all.\n\nCentred around the Pacific Ocean gyre, the crew brought experts, researchers, and scientists to help them collate data. After several hours of filming, they collected enough evidence to show that the oceans were turning toxic with microplastic spreading.\n\nProducer Jo Ruxton had previously taken part in expeditions to witness plastic pollution near San Francisco, which is what inspired the filming of A Plastic Ocean. The team collaborated with the WWF, cetacean expert Dr Lindsay Porter, and microplastic expert Dr Bonnie Monteleone to ensure their documentary covered all the necessary concerns.\n\nWhen the documentary made an impact on people’s perceptions towards single-use plastics, the crew and producers decided to take it to the next stage, by creating Plastic Oceans.\n\nThey organize awareness campaigns, and events to increase impact, create short documentaries on plastic pollution, and raise donations to help clean up our oceans. This campaign has gone on to win acclaim for the role it has played in creating positive changes to marine flora and fauna. Over time, they have expanded operations to the United States, Canada, Chile, Europe, and Mexico.\n\n7. The End of the Line (2009)\n\nDirected by Rupert Murray\n\n“Imagine an ocean without fish. Imagine your meals without seafood. Imagine the global consequences. This is the future if we do not stop, think and act.” With these opening lines, this documentary sets the tone of what is soon to follow. The End of the Line is a standout production that is a must-watch for anyone concerned about Earth’s oceans.\n\nFrom famed director Rupert Murray, this was one of the earliest documentaries that brought to light the situation faced by many underwater species.\n\nCritically examining the problems of overfishing, it covers the extinction of bluefin tuna, the overpopulation of jellyfish, and the reality of inedible fish poisoned by plastic pollution. Spanning 2 years of filming and research, this documentary brings to the fore the seemingly little importance that is given to fish. Filmed with investigative reporter Charles Clover, it raises questions to members of society who can make an impact but choose not to.\n\nThe film ends with a warning note- if the situation is not rectified, there will be no fish by the end of 2048.\n\n8. Sharkwater Extinction (2018)\n\nDirected by Rob Stewart\n\nFilmed and completed by the Rob Stewart Foundation in 2018, Sharkwater Extinction is a film that highlights the dangers sharks face due to overfishing, poaching, and pollution.\n\nFilmed as the sequel to Rob Stewart’s Sharkwater, it focuses on the rampant fishing of sharks to supplement various industries.
