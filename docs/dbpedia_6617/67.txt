Leading global valve specialist, Score Group, has inaugurated a state-of-the-art facility in the industrial port of Haifa, located in northern Israel. This strategic move aims to strengthen existing client support within the region while actively exploring new business opportunities.

The establishment of this facility represents the culmination of extensive development efforts over several years, initially scheduled to open in 2020. However, unforeseen challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic necessitated a postponement.

Spanning an impressive 800 square meters, the facility boasts a comprehensive array of capabilities, including repair, testing, modification, machining, painting, and substantial stock holding. It is further complemented by dedicated office space to support operational functions.

Score Group’s history of engagement with Israel dates back to 2016, marking the successful delivery of their inaugural project within the country. Since then, their team has maintained an unwavering commitment to servicing clients through routine maintenance, shutdown and turnaround (TAR) projects, and critical maintenance scopes. Notably, Score Group’s skilled technicians have been stationed offshore at client installations on a permanent basis for over three years.

With a broad spectrum of sectoral involvement, including upstream and midstream oil and gas, downstream oil refineries, chemical facilities, and power generation plants, Score Group is poised to expand its presence in the region. The newly operational facility in Haifa will enable the company to adopt a proactive approach in supporting key clients within Israel, reducing lead times for supply, repair, off-site testing, overhaul, and modification projects.

Additionally, this permanent establishment in Israel provides an opportunity to cultivate relationships with new clients, positioning Score Group as a significant supplier to the growing energy industry in the country. The facility is also expected to generate employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled workers in the region, facilitating training and development initiatives under the auspices of Score Group.

Ally Marshall, Director of Score’s Israel operations, expressed his enthusiasm, stating; “It’s fantastic to see the Haifa facility come to fruition after the level of work delivered by our team, both on the facility itself and at client assets. We now look forward to not only enhancing our service provision in the region but becoming an integral part of the local community. We’re committed to supporting its growth as much as we can and to building and developing a skilled local team.

“It’s an exciting time for the energy industry in Israel, and Score is thrilled to be a part of it.”

In celebration of the facility’s opening, Score Group was hosting a technology day on-site on Wednesday, October 4th, 2023. This event, free of charge, presented an opportunity to gain insights into the range of services offered in the region, including valve repair and service, emissions elimination, control valve and safety management, actuation and controls, training, and on-site services.
