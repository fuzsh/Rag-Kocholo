        "text": "If you want to understand customer health scores, think about your last doctor visit.\n\nWhile you were there, a nurse probably measured your body temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate. Those vital signs didn't make an exhaustive diagnostic but they gave your doctor a general idea of your health. Even more, they acted as new data points that could be compared to previous vitals, making it easy for your doctor to find dangerous trends.\n\nA customer health score is similar. Itâs an index made up of several âvitalâ key performance indicators (KPIs). It gives you an overall idea of how healthy a customerâs relationship is with your product. It also acts as a fortune-teller, predicting future customer behaviors like renewing or canceling subscriptions.\n\nCustomer health scores can get pretty complicated. Weâve seen some that include dozens of metrics. But it doesnât have to be that way. You can build a useful health score from a handful of inputs. After all, your health score wonât be helpful if no one understands it.\n\nLetâs do exactly that. Weâll use a simple three-step process to create a customer health score based on just four customer health âvital signs.â\n\nStep 1: Choose the Metrics for Your Customer Health Score\n\nFor software developers, a minimum viable product (MVP) is the least complicated version of a product that can still provide value to its users. Weâre going to borrow that method and build an MVP health score using four metrics:\n\nProduct setup\n\nProduct usage rate\n\nNet promoter score\n\nCSM pulse\n\nWe looked at the data from hundreds of customer health scores and realized these KPIs occur commonly. Most likely, it's because they offer a mix of qualitative and quantitative inputs, which gives you a more holistic view of the customer.\n\nProduct Setup\n\nProduct setup (aka product adoption or product implementation) tracks the steps your customer needs to take to get full value from your product.\n\nThere are two ways to look at product setup:\n\nA total number, i.e. how many implementation steps a customer has taken thus far\n\nA percentage of the total steps available, i.e. how far a user has progressed in their adoption journey\n\nAt Vitally, we ask users to create Playbooks, set risk alarms, and integrate with other software. If a user does all these things, we know theyâre getting value out of our product. That's why product setup is a great metric to have in our customer health score.\n\nProduct Usage Rate\n\nProduct usage rate measures how often users engage with your product in some meaningful way over a set period of time.\n\nWhen calculating your product usage rate, you have to do two things:\n\n1. Make sure your usage rate isnât just a measure of someone opening the app\n\nFor example, in a collaboration and productivity app, users should be creating and completing tasks regularly. If theyâre just opening the app and not managing tasks, thatâs probably a sign of trouble.\n\n2. Normalize the usage rate for population\n\nPopulation is the number of people using your app (aka users, seats, or licenses) within a given customer account. Normalizing for population means averaging the number of times your product gets used by the number of users.\n\nAsana has customers that range from a lone consultant to a massive team like Salesforce. If the lone consultant created and completed 10 tasks this week, thatâs a great outcome. But if the entire Salesforce team created and completed only 10 tasks this week, thatâs bad. If you look at the total times a customer account used your product, but you donât adjust for the number of users in that account, the results donât tell the full story.\n\nWant to avoid all of the most common churn prediction mistakes? We created a list along with tips to avoid them >>\n\nTo normalize for usage rate, divide the total uses by the number of users.\n\nLetâs say Salesforce had 100 Asana users in total. Those users created or completed 500 tasks in a day. Their daily product usage rate is 5.\n\nâ\n\nProduct usage rate is an important metric because if someone isnât using your product, theyâre not very likely to keep paying for it.\n\nNet Promoter Score\n\nA net promoter score (NPS) is a customer satisfaction benchmark. Itâs based on a single survey question that gets sent to your customers: âOn a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our product to a friend or coworker?â\n\nCalculating Net Promoter Score\n\nResponses to that question are typically placed into three groups:\n\n1 - 6 = âDetractorsâ\n\n7 - 8 = âPassivesâ\n\n9 - 10 = âPromotersâ\n\nTo calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters (ignoring the passives).\n\nLetâs say Asana sends an NPS survey to 100 users at Salesforce. Of that group, 70% were promoters, 20% were passives, and 10% were detractors. That customer account has an NPS score of 60%.\n\nâ\n\nPeople donât recommend what they donât like, so NPS scores are considered a reliable proxy for customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nCSM Pulse\n\nThe CSM pulse is a subjective grade that your Customer Success Managers (CSMs) give each account they manage. Think of it as a human âgut checkâ on the happiness of your customers.\n\nYou can create just about any scale you want for the CSM pulse. To make things easy, weâll use a 0 to 10 scale for this exercise.\n\nYou can â and eventually should â measure a whole slew of customer engagement metrics like the frequency of CSM-to-customer contacts and the number of service tickets reported. For the first customer health score, the CSM pulse is a simple way to express customer satisfaction in one tidy number.\n\nStep 2: Assign a Common Scale to Each Customer Health Score Metric\n\nOur ultimate goal is to calculate a single health score that reveals the overall health of a customer. One metric to rule them all, as it were.\n\nTo do that, we have to create a common scale for each of the metrics that make up the score. If we donât, the calculation would be impossibleâhow do you reconcile an NPS of 60 with a product usage rate of 5?\n\nItâs pretty easy to do. Our scale is going to consist of three categories, and each gets 0, 5, or 10 points:\n\nPoor (0 points)\n\nConcerning (5 points)\n\nHealthy (10 points)\n\nThen weâll decide what poor, concerning, and healthy means for each metric. Thereâs no hard and fast rule here â a product usage rate of 5 might be healthy for your business but poor for another.\n\nWe created this matrix for our example:\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nLetâs run through this so you can see how it works\n\nYour customer, Salesforce, has these results:\n\nProduct setup rate: 80% â thatâs 10 pointsâ\n\nProduct usage rate: 6 â thatâs 5 pointsâ\n\nNPS score: 32 â thatâs 5 pointsâ\n\nCSM Pulse: 9 â thatâs 10 points\n\nYou now have what you need to calculate a simple customer health score for Salesforce. Just add up all the points and divide by four (the number of metrics weâve used).\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nYou could stop here if you wanted to, but you probably shouldnât. Why not? Because some of the metrics weâve chosen might be better predictors of churn than others â which means youâll want to give them more weight in the overall customer health score calculation.\n\nStep 3: Weighting Your Customer Health Score Metrics\n\nWeighting the metrics in your customer health score will make that score a much better predictor of customer behavior.\n\nWhat if you noticed that 85% of your churned customers had a product usage rate of less than 5? Thatâs a strong correlation. Meanwhile, youâve noted that only 40% of churned customers had a low CSM pulse score â a much weaker correlation. In this case, product usage rate is a better predictor of customer churn.\n\nSo, weâre going to give product usage rate more weight in our customer health score.\n\nWeights (need to add up to 100)\n\nProduct setup rate: 20%\n\nProduct usage rate: 40%\n\nNPS score: 20%\n\nCSM pulse: 20%\n\nMultiply the raw scores by the weighting factors to get our weighted net scores.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nDid you notice what happened? When we weighted the metrics, Salesforceâs health score dropped from 7.5 to 7. They didnât score well in the most predictive category we tracked: product usage rate. If you hadnât weighted the score, you might have missed an important churn signal.\n\nA final note: Your customers' current health score is only a small part of the story. The real insight is in the trend over time. Salesforce might have a health score of 7 right now, and thatâs not too bad. But if it was 8 last month, thereâs cause for concern.\n\nCreating a Customer Health Score: Whatâs Next?\n\nOnce a minimally viable software product is launched, developers typically go back and start iterating on it. Thatâs exactly what you can do with your customer health score.\n\nYou can start by reviewing some of the dozens of other customer and product metrics out there â at Vitally we like data around support tickets, customer engagement with the company, and account growth (like upsells). What youâre looking for are those crystal ball analytics that predict customer behavior.\n\nYou can also look for ways to create new customer health scores for specific customer segments. That way, youâll score new customers differently than established product users.\n\nWant Modern Health Scores?\n\nIf you want to automatically segment your customers and define different health equations for each segment, Vitally can help.
