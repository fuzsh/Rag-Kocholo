        "text": "About Triple-R\n\nSince 1992, the City of Sacramento’s Older Adult Services division has offered a unique daytime support program to meet the social and care needs of people with dementia, while their family members get respite from round-the-clock caregiving. Triple-R Adult Day Centers are licensed by the State of California and operate at three locations.\n\nWhat to expect at Triple-R\n\nAt Triple-R we work to keep life interesting and fun for people with mild to severe memory issues (dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease). We know that everyone is unique; our staff works to discover what makes each Triple-R member special and then gives them the person-centered care they deserve.\n\nA day at Triple-R includes both group and individual endeavors. Building strength and energy levels while doing fun exercises, chatting about the news of the day (or yesterday!), making or tapping a toe to upbeat music, cooking up an afternoon treat, and tending to the garden can all be part of a typical day. And tomorrow will bring more engaging things to do. Our talented staff uses creativity to come up with the perfect project to match individuals’ unique interests and backgrounds. A hot, nutritious meal is provided at noontime, and snacks are offered throughout the day.\n\nAssistance to Triple-R members who have mobility issues or other physical limitations or a need for help in the restroom is always provided with sensitivity. Creating a sense of well-being for all we have the honor to serve is our goal. Challenging dementia behaviors such as wandering, confusion, agitation or mood swings are handled by our state-of-the-art trained staff with skill and compassion. People with mild memory loss may choose to attend Club Refresh, a special center for those in the early stages of dementia.\n\nSupport For Caregivers\n\nCaring for someone with memory loss can be a big challenge and Triple-R strives to be your caregiving partner. We’ll work closely with you to share communication tips and care techniques to use at home. In addition, educational workshops, support groups and even caregiver paint nights are part of Triple-R’s service to the community.\n\n24/7 Alzheimer’s Association Helpline\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association 24/7 Helpline (800-272-3900) is available around the clock, 365 days a year. Through this free service, specialists and master’s-level clinicians offer confidential support and information to people living with the disease, caregivers, families and the public.\n\nFriendship Line California\n\nThis is a toll-free line that provides emotional support to older Californians facing loneliness, isolation and anxiety. The number is 1-888-670-1360.\n\nRespite Support\n\nIf you need in-home respite, please contact our community partner, Del Oro Caregiver Resource Center at (916) 728-9333 for more information about how you can receive additional help while you are providing care for a loved one at home.\n\nQ&A\n\nIs Triple-R licensed?\n\nYes, all three Triple-R sites are licensed by the State of California Department of Social Services, Community Licensing Program. To serve in a licensed Adult Day Program, Triple-R staff submit to a rigorous background check before they are employed by the program.\n\nDo I really need Adult Day services, we seem to be doing fine on our own?\n\nWhile it’s true that no one will ever know your loved one better than you, time and again family members report the benefits of sharing their caregiving challenges with staff and other caregivers as a way to get new ideas or reach solutions for caring for a loved one at home. In particular, staff can help you understand the best communication techniques when talking to someone with dementia. We can be your partner in care and will provide valuable support.\n\nCan Triple-R provide care for someone as advanced as my loved one?\n\nAs specialists in dementia care, Triple-R staff members are prepared to deal with all aspects of memory loss, from mild to severe, including wandering, anxiety, incontinence, mood swings and mobility limitations. During the new member interview process, the Program Coordinator will gather information to develop a thorough Plan of Care to ensure all your loved one’s need are met.\n\nDoes Triple-R provide transportation?\n\nAlthough Triple-R doesn’t provide transportation directly, nearly half of our members arrive by either Paratransit (phone 429-2009) or ACC Rides (phone 393-9026, ext. 333), local van services for seniors. During the New Member interview we can help you arrange for this transportation, if you need it.\n\nAre adult day centers like nursing homes?\n\nOne visit to Triple-R is all you’ll need to see that our centers aren’t institutional, by any stretch of the imagination. Each center is community based – one at a bustling senior center, another on an elementary school campus and the third at a familiar shopping center – giving those who attend the sense that they’re “where the action is.” There are no gates, locked doors or fences at any of our locations. Instead, member safety is ensured with our ratio of one staff person for every four participants.\n\nHow can I address the guilt I feel about needing help in my role as a caregiver?\n\nWe all need a break, no matter how much we enjoy something. Adult day centers are a win-win option for both caregivers and the family member who attends the program. Members enjoy a day full of fun and camaraderie, brightened by interesting activities offered in a warm and caring environment. Caregivers regularly report that their loved one is more relaxed after a day at Triple-R and the scheduled breaks from caregiving make life together at home more enjoyable for everybody.\n\nWhat if my loved one refuses to go?\n\nBecause people with memory loss often develop a strong attachment to their closest family member and can feel anxious when separated from them, most caregivers worry that their loved one will be unwilling to join an adult day program. Triple-R staff have loads of experience with this issue; we’ll lead the way to help new members adjust and feel secure. While many are reluctant to start, nearly all who join quickly look forward to their time at Triple-R – often to the surprise of their family caregiver!\n\nMore Comments from Triple-R's Caregiver Survey\n\nMidtown at Hart Senior Center\n\n“Triple R has been a great help to our family and has enabled my father to maintain his health and well-being, both mentally and physically. Thank you.”\n\n“I can't say enough about how great Triple-R is for my mother/family. The staff is excellent, always kind, gentle and good-natured. They've taken the time to understand my mother's individual personality, which tickles her no end and speaks highly of staff professionalism. Head and shoulders above residential caregiving.”\n\n“You were a wonderful resource for my stepdad as he ended this season of caring for my mom. She loved being there & it freed him up at a time of great need!”\n\nClub Refresh at Woodlake School\n\n“Triple R is a fabulous organization. I truly believe this organization has aided in my mother’s mental health over the last five years. We are very grateful for the care she has been provided.”\n\n“(My mother’s) communication skills are better when she attends your program. You really have a wonderful staff that are so talented. You all have helped me, too, so much. I can’t thank you enough.”\n\n“I felt that Triple R was good for my partner. He did come home more alert and talked about what they had done. He especially liked when they did art projects.”\n\nSouth Land Park\n\n“Everyone is wonderful and Triple-R has been a real lifesaver! Economically, ithas been a cost-effective alternative to in-home care while I work full-time, but the real benefit is how much my dad enjoys the people and the activities! I feel great knowing that he interacts with more than one person while I'm at work, and the staff supports me too. They listen when I have concerns, keep me updated on any issues he's having, and have made helpful suggestions on how I can cope better when I'm feeling frustrated. I can't say enough good things about the program and the staff!”\n\n“The staff is very friendly and seems to connect with my mom. I appreciate their attentiveness.”\n\n“Very positive interactions with staff and environment. My husband is always positive about his time there and perceives it as a happy place.”\n\n“The staff is welcoming with smiles everywhere. Warmth - that is what one feels and when you come to take them home, it is the same feeling - awesome! PS: I must add, we're proud that the city offers this program and at a reasonable price.”\n\nEvery day dozens of older men and women gather together to enjoy one another’s company, perhaps sing along to a favorite song, enjoy old hobbies or try their hand at a new one, laugh and joke with each other – and stay safe. In the meantime, family caregivers get a needed break or head off to work knowing a loved one is in good hands. The daytime support offered at Triple-R Adult Day Centers may be just the Peace of Mind your family is looking for."
