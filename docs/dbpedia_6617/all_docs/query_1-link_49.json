        "text": "The A List 2023\n\nGlobal environmental crises are unfolding before our eyes: biodiversity and ecosystems continue to decline at an alarming rate and 2023 was officially the hottest year on record. The need for high-quality environmental data – the foundation of a net-zero, nature-positive future – has never been more important.\n\nFollowing another record year of disclosure, CDP scored over 21,000 companies on their environmental disclosures.\n\nMore than 400 companies scored an A for their leadership in environmental transparency and performance on climate change, deforestation and water security.\n\n362 companies\n\nmade the 2023\n\nClimate Change A List\n\n31 companies\n\nmade the 2023\n\nForests A List\n\n103 companies\n\nmade the 2023\n\nWater Security A List\n\nSee the CDP Europe A List\n\nWhat is leadership?\n\nBy scoring companies from D- to A, CDP takes them on a journey starting from disclosure, to understanding what to measure and finally how to take tangible, measurable actions.\n\nEven companies that achieve an A – although among the most transparent when it comes to disclosure and performance on climate change, deforestation or water security – are by no means at the end of their environmental journey.\n\nCDP disclosure and the A List play a key role in keeping companies on a journey of continuous environmental improvement. We regularly raise the bar for what qualifies as environmental leadership in line with emerging science, feedback from stakeholders, and market needs for greater environmental transparency. A List companies are those keeping up with these evolving requirements.\n\nDisclosure is an essential first step, not the destination. Whether a company is at the beginning of its journey, working hard to improve its score year-on-year, or leading the way in environmental transparency, comprehensive disclosure serves as a baseline for transition plans and – crucially – enables companies to follow through on their ambitions.\n\nLearn more about CDP scoring in our overview, or read our detailed scoring methodologies below.\n\nMainstreaming transparency\n\nCDP disclosure and scores play a key role in keeping companies on a journey of continuous environmental improvement. In 2023, a record-breaking 23,000+ companies representing at least two thirds of global market capitalization disclosed through CDP – 24% more than last year, and over 140% more than disclosures in 2020.\n\nCDP’s questionnaires are fully aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), and ideally positioned to mainstream the widespread adoption of other emerging frameworks and standards.\n\nThe number of disclosing companies has grown each year since 2003.\n\nMore than 23,000 companies disclosed their climate, forests and water security impacts through CDP in 2023.\n\nOut of over 21,000 companies scored, just under 400 made the A List.\n\nFrom disclosure to action\n\nExplore the benefits of disclosure, how to unlock the power of your supply chain, and how other companies are taking action in the environmental transition.\n\nSearch CDP's database for any company's public response and scores\n\nAll public responses and scores can be viewed through our response search.
