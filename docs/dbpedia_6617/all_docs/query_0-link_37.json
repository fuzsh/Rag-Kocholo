        "text": "Investment Objective\n\nThe Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) are a family of best-in-class benchmarks for investors who have recognized that sustainable business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value and who wish to reflect their sustainability convictions in their investment portfolios. The family was launched in 1999 as the first global sustainability benchmark and tracks the stock performance of the world's leading companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria.\n\nCreated jointly by S&P Dow Jones Indices and SAM, the DJSI combine the experience of an established index provider with the expertise of a specialist in Sustainable Investing to select the most sustainable companies from across 61 industries.\n\nThe indices serve as benchmarks for investors who integrate sustainability considerations into their portfolios, and provide an effective engagement platform for investors who wish to encourage companies to improve their corporate sustainability practices.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe DJSI World applies a transparent, rules-based component selection process based on the companiesâ€™ Total Sustainability Scores resulting from the annual S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). Only the top ranked companies within each industry are selected for inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index family. No industries are excluded from this process.\n\n* Global Indices: Top 10%, Regional Indices: Top 20%, Country Indices: Top 30%\n\nThe composition of the DJSI is reviewed each year in September based on the S&P Global ESG Scores resulting from the annual SAM CSA and is rebalanced quarterly.\n\nIndex family\n\nThe Dow Jones Sustainability Index family comprises global, regional, and country benchmarks as shown in the following list:\n\nDJSI World\n\nDJSI North America\n\nDJSI Europe\n\nDJSI Asia Pacific\n\nDJSI Emerging Markets\n\nDJSI Korea\n\nDJSI Australia\n\nDJSI Chile\n\nDJSI MILA Pacific Alliance\n\nFor Investors who wish to limit their exposure to controversial activities, S&P Dow Jones Indices also offer the DJSI Indices with exclusion criteria such as Armaments & Firearms, Alcohol, Tobacco, Gambling and Adult Entertainment.\n\nAll DJSI indices are calculated in both price and total return versions and are disseminated in real time."
