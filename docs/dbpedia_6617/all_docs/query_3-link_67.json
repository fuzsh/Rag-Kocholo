Complaint submitted\n\nYou submit a complaint, or another government agency forwards your complaint to us. You will receive email updates and can check the status of your complaint.\n\n2. Route\n\nWe'll send your complaint directly to the company so it can review the issues in your complaint. If we find that another government agency would be better able to assist, we will send your complaint to them and let you know.\n\n3.

In some cases, the company will let you know their response is in progress and provide a final response in 60 days.\n\n4. Complaint published\n\nWe publish information about your complaint (without information that directly identifies you) in our public Consumer Complaint Database. With your consent we also publish your description of what happened, after taking steps to remove personal information. Learn more about how we share complaint data.\n\n5. Consumer review\n\nWe will let you know when the company responds. You’ll be able to review the company’s response and will have 60 days to provide feedback about the company's response."
