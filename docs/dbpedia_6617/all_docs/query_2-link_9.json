This acquisition will provide Score with a platform to further develop within the Dutch and wider Benelux marketplace and offer the opportunity to Kampen’s existing customers to access Score’s unique value adding services, including its Emissions Elimination Program (EEP).\n\nScott Will, Score’s Business Unit Director for Europe and Africa, said: “We are delighted to welcome Kampen Valve Care into the Score Group. Kampen has a fantastic reputation in the Netherlands for offering quality valve maintenance services and we are very keen to build and enhance its reputation by introducing our own value adding services and expertise. In particular we see a major opportunity to support our customers in the region to manage and reduce emissions from their operations, both onshore and offshore, by pairing Score’s proprietary emissions detection technology with our unique repair capability.”\n\nAlbert De Jonge, Managing Director of Kampen Valve Care, said: “As I reflect on the past 20 years of Kampen Valve Care’s journey, acknowledging the challenges faced, I would like to express my pride in the accomplishments our team has achieved.\n\n“Now being part of the Score Group, it provides us with new opportunities for growth, allowing us to look towards a promising future.
