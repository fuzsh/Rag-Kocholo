        "text": "Our REACH Model underscores our commitment to world-class service. It’s a formalized approach to driving greater customer experiences that guides our actions, behaviors and interactions with clients.\n\nR – Rethink Your Definition of Customer Service\n\nThe transition from the term “customer service” to “customer experience” has profound implications for how we interact with clients. We consider the entire customer experience, which encompasses every touchpoint of how clients interact with our business.\n\nE – EMPOWER employees to be client advocates\n\nWe are all focused on client success. From company leadership to customer-facing junior-level employees, we all share a commitment to the customer experience, understand its impact and constantly seek to improve it. All employees are empowered to share new ideas or initiatives that may improve the broader customer experience.\n\nA – Adopt Employee-driven Innovation\n\nInnovation in any part of an organization must be driven by employees. That includes big ideas and initiatives that engage customers and enhance their experience. We foster that passion for innovation by providing employees the time, resources and skills to develop new tools and approaches.\n\nC – Cultivate a Culture of Collaboration\n\nWe break down silos and collaborate across the organization to build a better overall customer journey. Our departments rely on each other to provide services and solutions that enhance the customer experience.\n\nH – HELP customers solve big challenges\n\nWe learn the intricacies of our clients’ businesses to help them solve their biggest challenges. The more we know about our customers’ needs, the better suited we are to provide comprehensive solutions."
