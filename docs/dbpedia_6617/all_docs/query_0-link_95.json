        "text": "Synopsis\n\n​Eight months before her death, Fields, whose real first name is Abigail, spoke about the exploitation prevalent in the adult film industry.\n\nA Peruvian adult film star named Thaina Fields was found dead in her apartment.\n\nHer body was recovered from her home in Trujillo on Saturday\n\nThe 24-year-old’s death triggered rumours of possible foul play as months ago Fields had opened up about the abuse she faced in the industry.\n\nEight months before her death, Fields, whose real first name is Abigail, spoke about the rampant sexual abuse & exploitation prevalent in the adult film industry.\n\n“I have suffered sexual harassment and abuse after starting to create adult content,” she told a publication.\n\nFields also revealed that many producers who hired her had tried to take liberties with her. “At first … many thought that by hiring me they could do what they wanted with me, but then I came home, took a bath, and cried,” she said.\n\nFields concluded that it is very difficult to be a “woman and created adult content,” as it exposes her to otherisation and slut shaming.\n\nField’s colleague and close friend Alejandra Sweet paid her a tribute on Instagram. “Guys, I will only tell you to pray for her the people who truly appreciated her and not only saw her out of pure morbidity. From where she is, I am sure she is a little angel, “ she wrote.\n\nShe was also mourned by Milky Peru, one of the companies she worked with. “We can’t believe this, we refuse to be without you, we would like to see you one more time. “We hope someone wakes us up from this bad dream, you will always be in our hearts. Thank you for allowing us to be part of your life,” read a statement on the company’s official Instagram account.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
