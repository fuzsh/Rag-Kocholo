The chosen player selects a chit that their team is unaware of.\n\nStep 3: The player attempts to convey the title of the film to their teammates by acting. But speaking or pointing out any objects is against the rules.\n\nStep 4: If their team correctly guesses the title of the film, they win a point.

The team with the most points wins the game.\n\nRESULT: Charades is a fun, old-fashioned game that encourages nonverbal communication skills.

These 15 items are vital for their survival.\n\nThe challenge is for them to rank these 15 items in order of importance. They must place rank 1 to an essential item, 2 to the next most important item, and so on.\n\nNow, provide each member with a ‘lost at sea’ chart. The facilitator can divide this chart into six columns.\n\nThe 1st column will be a listing of the items in random order.\n\nThe 2nd column will have spaces against each item for the participant to give his/her personal ranking.\n\nThe 3rd column will again have empty spaces for teams to provide their rankings. The 4th column will have the correct orders (provided by the US coast guard). The 5th column will be to calculate the difference between the individual and the correct score.\n\nThe final column will calculate the difference between the team rankings and the correct rankings.\n\nIn the end, there will be two separate rows to calculate the individual and the team’s total score.\n\nThe team with the lowest total score wins the game.\n\nProvide 10 minutes to individual members to rank the items. The next 10 minutes will be given to teams to confer and decide on the importance of items. Teams then must compare the teams' scores with everybody's score. They must discuss with team members the reason for the difference in scores.\n\nRESULT: This is a game that relies heavily on communication and active listening.

Outline the space inside which the objects have been placed. Put a basket in the center of the space and spread out the objects around it.\n\nDivide participants into two groups of equal members. Take note that the number of objects is always twice the number of members in a team.\n\nMake both teams stand on opposite sides of the area. Ask them to choose one volunteer from each team to be blindfolded for the game. Put the blindfolds on both the volunteers.\n\nAfter the blindfolds have been put, teams need to call out objects for their teams. Then the game begins.\n\nThe volunteer for each team must pick up the objects their team calls out and put them in the center basket. Fix a time limit for this challenge (2-3 minutes). However, team members cannot call out objects by its name. They must describe the object to their volunteer.\n\nFor example- a water bottle can’t be called by its name but described as a container, must-have drink in summer and so on.\n\nThe team that first gets all its objects into the basket wins.\n\nRESULT: It paves the way for employees to be more creative, think on their feet, and force them to work together.

However, the team leader suffers from frostbite and can't move physically to help make the shelter. The rest of the team has also been struck by snow blindness and therefore, must be blindfolded.\n\nThe challenge is that teams must build the shelter while keeping their blindfold on. The team leader can’t participate physically but needs to direct the team verbally in helping to make the tent.\n\nThe first one to build the shelter successfully wins.\n\nRESULT: The team that wins will only be able to do that if they have complete faith in their team leader. In a workplace scenario, teams must learn to trust and carry out their leader’s judgment. For the person in charge of leading, it helps him/her to direct members with authority. They can only do that when they can earn their teams’ trust and confidence.\n\nMoreover, since this game relies heavily on communication, the leader will also learn to direct the teams with clarity and precision.\n\n3.
