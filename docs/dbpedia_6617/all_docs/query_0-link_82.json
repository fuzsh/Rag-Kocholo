        "text": "Key takeaways\n\nLenders have minimum requirements for business loans, including revenue, credit history and time in business\n\nThe type of business loan you apply for will impact how hard it is to get\n\nIf you have a strong personal credit score, solid financials and at least a year in business, you may have an easier time securing a business loan\n\nBusiness owners need funds, especially when starting or expanding a company. While many small business financing options are available, loans remain one of the most popular — but just how hard is it to get a business loan?\n\nThe Q4 2023 Small Business Lending Survey found that large banks approved the least amount of business loans, with approval rates at 49 percent. Small banks were significantly more likely to approve loans, with approval rates at 89 percent. Additionally, 24 percent of lenders reported tightening their credit standards, which can make it harder to get a business loan.\n\nFactors that impact business loan approval\n\nWhen making a loan decision, lenders will consider your company’s characteristics and whether they meet the lender’s business loan requirements. Lenders place the heaviest weight on your cash flow, credit history and time in business. They’ll use this information to approve or deny your loan and determine your interest rate.\n\nDon’t get discouraged if your business doesn’t meet all these standards. If you lack in one area but fulfill or exceed other criteria, you may still qualify for a loan.\n\nIndustry\n\nFor lenders, working with companies in consistent and profitable industries is more appealing than loaning money to businesses in riskier industries. For example, lenders typically exclude businesses in the gambling, real estate or adult entertainment industry.\n\nIf you hope to get a government-backed loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration, your company must fit specific industry requirements. Most industries are eligible for SBA funding; exceptions include gambling, multi-level marketing schemes and religious institutions.\n\nTime in business\n\nProving that you can successfully manage a company over time is important to lenders. The longer you’ve been in business, the more favorable your approval odds. From a lender’s perspective, having a track record of successful business management demonstrates that you’ll use your loan responsibly and pay it back on time.\n\nTraditional banks typically look for at least two years of business history when approving a loan. But you might be able to secure financing from other lenders if you’ve been in business for six months or more. Still in the startup stage? Check out the best startup business loans.\n\nLightbulb\n\nBankrate insight\n\nThe 2023 Small Business Credit Survey found that businesses that were more established with higher revenue were more likely to be fully approved for a business loan, line of credit or merchant cash advance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBusinesses with at least $100,000 to $1,000,000 in revenue were 19 percent more likely to be fully approved for a loan compared to businesses with less than $100,000 in revenue. Similarly, businesses aged six years to 20 years were 13 percent more likely to be fully approved than businesses under five years old.\n\nCredit score and history\n\nNo matter what type of loan you’re applying for, your credit history is crucial in determining your eligibility. Having a higher credit score will boost your chances of getting approved for a business loan. Lenders want a clear understanding of how you’ve dealt with debt in the past so they may evaluate your personal and business credit scores when making a loan decision.\n\nThe minimum credit score for a business loan depends on the type of lender. Banks and credit unions may require a score of 700 or higher. Some online and alternative lenders accept credit scores in the mid-500s if your business is otherwise financially healthy.\n\nCash flow\n\nYour company’s cash flow is another essential factor. Lenders need proof that you have enough revenue to keep your business afloat and repay your loan.\n\nLenders often have minimum revenue requirements for loan recipients, with some requiring as little as $10,000 in annual revenue. But traditional lenders will have higher cash flow expectations, with many requiring at least $100,000 in yearly revenue.\n\nLoan amount\n\nSmall business loan amounts range depending on the kind of loan, the company’s cash flow, the type of lender and more.\n\nWhen figuring out how much money to request, be mindful of your current and projected cash flow. You want to be realistic about how much you can afford to borrow — especially if you have a seasonal business or your revenue is inconsistent throughout the year.\n\nThe loan amount you request isn’t necessarily what you will receive. While reviewing your loan application, lenders will consider all the above factors to determine how much you can borrow.\n\nCollateral\n\nSome lenders may require you to provide collateral (such as equipment or inventory) they can claim if you don’t repay your loan. For instance, if you receive an SBA 7(a) loan over $50,000, you’ll need to secure it with business assets.\n\nIf your business collateral’s value doesn’t cover the entire loan amount, you’ll need to put up personal assets to account for the difference.\n\nBusiness plan\n\nNot all lenders require a business plan, but having one is a good idea. Lenders need to properly assess your business’s ability to make money and repay the loan, and a business plan will lay out this information and explain the business’s potential revenue.\n\nIf you have an established business, a lender may only want proof of revenue and cash flow to ensure the business can repay the loan.\n\nDebt\n\nOther debts and financial obligations can impact your ability to afford a business loan. Before applying for a loan, calculate your debt-service coverage ratio, which compares your business’s debt and cash flow. Since lenders use this number to see whether you can afford an additional loan or debt, it’s best to know how lenders may view your business and its financial health. Having a business debt schedule for all your long-term debts is also helpful.\n\nDifficulty of getting a loan by type\n\nIn addition to the above factors, your chances of getting a loan depend on the type of business loan you’re applying for.\n\nWhile factors vary depending on the lender, here are some of the standard requirements and benefits of the most popular loan types.\n\nLoan type Purpose Requirements Benefits SBA loan Growth and expansion of business\n\nFinancial documentation\n\nMinimum credit score\n\nMinimum annual revenue\n\nMinimum time in business\n\nGovernment-backed\n\nCompetitive interest rates\n\nMultiple loan types\n\nExtended repayment periods\n\nTerm loan Cover operating expenses and business purchases\n\nMinimum credit score\n\nCollateral\n\nMinimum annual revenue\n\nMinimum of two years in business\n\nBuilds business credit\n\nImproves cash flow\n\nBusiness line of credit Cover short-term business expenses\n\nCollateral\n\nMinimum of six months in business\n\nOften requires an annual revenue of $100,000\n\nMinimum credit scored\n\nAvoid paying interest if the bill is paid in full\n\nImproved cash flow\n\nBuilds business credit\n\nEquipment financing Purchase business expenses\n\nBusiness credit score\n\nPersonal credit score\n\nMinimum of one year in business\n\nProfit and loss statement\n\nMakes the cost of purchasing equipment more affordable\n\nBuilds business credit\n\nMerchant cash advance Cover short-term business expenses\n\nMinimum annual revenue\n\nMinimum time in business\n\nMinimum credit score\n\nFinancial statements\n\nQuick access to cash\n\nAvailable to all businesses, even those with sub-par credit\n\nLimited paperwork\n\nFlexible approval\n\nInvoice factoring or financing Cover business expenses immediately, instead of waiting for invoices to be paid\n\nMinimum sales volume\n\nMinimum age of your business\n\nFinancial statements, including tax returns\n\nFast access to funds\n\nImproves cash flow\n\nNo credit check for invoice factoring\n\nAlternatives to business loans\n\nSecuring a traditional small business loan can be challenging, and depending on your situation, a bad credit business loan or alternative lending may be better options for securing capital for your business. Consider some of these alternatives to traditional business loans.\n\nBusiness credit card\n\nA business credit card is similar to a personal credit card but restricted to business purposes, and the credit limit is usually higher than what you’ll see with a personal card. Some business owners may prefer a business credit card to a business loan as they avoid paying interest if they pay the bill in full every month, making it more affordable than a loan when managed properly. Additionally, business credit cards can offer rewards and benefits, including a sign-up bonus, an introductory APR or travel rewards.\n\nGrant\n\nGrants are appealing to many business owners as the money doesn’t need to be repaid. But, as a result, it can be competitive and the application processes are long.\n\nFederal and state government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private companies and businesses typically offer business grants.\n\nCrowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding is another way to get the capital to cover startup costs or business needs. Depending on the type of crowdfunding you choose, there is typically no application, credit check or interest to worry about. But crowdfunding platforms do charge fees, including payment processing fees.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending\n\nSimilar to debt crowdfunding, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending allows businesses to borrow money from one or more investors in the form of a loan. If investors agree to fund your P2P loan, the money is repaid with interest, and monthly payments are fixed. An application and a credit check are required, and most sites allow people to get prequalified to confirm potential eligibility before filling out an application.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you’re ready to grow your company, getting a small business loan could be a smart option. While getting a business loan can be difficult since most require strong personal and business credit scores, reliable cash flow and at least two years in business, there are alternatives available to obtain the cash you need.\n\nOnce you determine your business’s needs, be sure to explore all options for business financing — whether that’s traditional business loans or alternative lenders.\n\nFrequently asked questions"
