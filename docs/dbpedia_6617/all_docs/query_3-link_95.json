        "text": "G2 strives to be the world’s most trusted and influential marketplace for software buyers, sellers, and service providers. In addition to G2’s rigorous review moderation process, that trust is earned by applying a consistent set of guidelines, methodologies, and definitions to give buyers the best view of a particular B2B software market.\n\nThis page contains detailed information about G2’s research scoring methodologies, including scoring for software products and service providers, sorting logic, and G2 Market Report inclusion criteria.\n\nG2 Score\n\nG2 uses a proprietary algorithm to rank products based on reviews gathered from the user community as well as data aggregated from online sources and social networks. The result of this algorithm is the G2 Score, which is a standardized score used to compare products within the same G2 category.\n\nScores for a product or service might differ between their corresponding G2 categories due to the reviews analyzed and G2’s scoring normalization process.\n\nThis section describes the discrete scoring methodologies used to calculate the G2 Score for software and service providers.\n\nSoftware\n\nA software’s G2 Score is calculated using two scoring components: Satisfaction and Market Presence.\n\nSatisfaction\n\nG2’s Satisfaction score is derived from the following metrics.\n\nMetric groupMetricDescriptionImportanceReview response dataUser-focused scoresG2 review form questions:\n\nEase of Use\n\nMeets Requirements\n\nQuality of Support\n\nHighAdmin-focused scoresG2 review form questions:\n\nEase of Admin\n\nEase of Setup\n\nEase of Doing Business With\n\nMediumGeneral satisfaction scoresG2 review form questions:\n\nLikelihood to Recommend\n\nDirection of Product\n\nLowSignificanceReview volumeTo assess popularity and statistical significance, review response data is weighted based on the total number of reviews.HighRelevanceReview recencyBecause recent reviews are more relevant to buyers, older reviews are weighted less. For more information, refer to the Review Decay section.HighReview qualityReviews that are more thoroughly completed are weighted more heavily. Each review is assigned a readability score using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease scale.MediumReview sourceReviews collected from current product users or from users who have more experience with the product are given increased weight. Reviews solicited without incentive are also weighted more heavily.\n\nPer the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, vendors should not segment customers to solicit only positive reviews. Any reviews obtained via segmentation violate G2’s Community Guidelines and are subject to removal.\n\nLow\n\nMarket Presence\n\nG2's Market Presence score incorporates metrics derived from G2 reviews and third-party sources. Market Presence is based on data for both products and their corresponding vendors, with increased weight given to product-specific metrics.\n\nThe following table describes several key factors influencing G2’s Market Presence score, listed in order of importance.\n\nMetric groupMetricDescriptionImportanceReview countWeighted review count by categoryThe number of non-business partner reviews attributed to the category. Reviews are weighted based on the same factors used in G2’s Satisfaction score, including review quality, review recency, and review source.HighEmployee count and revenue\n\nRefer to the Scoring appendix for more information.\n\nEmployees on ZoomInfoThe number of employees reported by ZoomInfo.HighEmployees on LinkedInThe number of employees reported by LinkedIn.HighEmployees on CrunchbaseThe number of employees reported by Crunchbase, represented as a range.MediumRevenue on ZoomInfoThe estimated B2B software revenue reported by ZoomInfo.MediumWeb presenceMoz Product Page AuthorityHow well the product’s webpage will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs), predicted by Moz.MediumMoz Vendor Domain AuthorityHow well the vendor’s website will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs), predicted by Moz Domain Page Authority.MediumEstimated Search VolumeThe estimated volume for vendor-branded search terms based on data from STAT Search Analytics and other sources.MediumSEMrush Total TrafficThe sum of organic and adwords traffic, reported by SEMrush (US database only).MediumSpyfu Traffic BudgetThe estimated advertising spend for the vendor’s paid search keywords, as reported by Spyfu (US database only).LowSEMrush Traffic QualityThe monetary value of organic traffic to the vendor’s website, divided by the number of keywords tracked by SEMrush for the website (US database only).LowGrowth, influence, and engagementCrunchbase RankThe Crunchbase rank for the vendor. Crunchbase ranks organizations on several variables, including total funding amount, relationship with other organizations, and pageviews.LowVendor employee growthThe change in employee count since the last time company size was verified on LinkedIn, normalized by company size.\n\nEmployee growth is reported for a vendor 12 months following their first appearance on G2 Grid®.\n\nLowX (formerly Twitter) Product FollowersThe number of followers for a product's primary X handle (if available).LowX (formerly Twitter) Vendor FollowersThe number of followers for a vendor’s primary X handle (if available).LowGlassdoor RatingThe vendor’s employee satisfaction rating on Glassdoor (if available).LowYear FoundedThe year the vendor was founded. Vendors who have been in business longer are weighted more positively.Low\n\nProduct Suites\n\nProduct suites are groupings of products that offer buyers an expanded range of features and functionality, prebuilt integrations, and a simplified vendor relationship. Each G2 Product Suite has its own profile, which can be customized in my.G2.\n\nSuite profiles aggregate the reviews from each of the product profiles in the suite, and each review includes the name of the original product reviewed.\n\nCustomers can write reviews for a product suite, which also appear on the corresponding product profiles.\n\nReviews for product suite profiles do not impact G2 scoring or inclusion criteria for G2 Market Reports for product suites or their associated products.\n\nSimilar to how product suites package G2-listed products together, product suite categories enable buyers to compare solutions with functionality that spans multiple G2 categories.\n\nTo be included in a suite category, a suite must have G2-listed products in all of the required product categories determined by G2’s Market Research team.\n\nTwo types of product categories can be included in a product suite category:\n\nCore categories define the essential features of the product suite category. A solution must offer all the required features of the core categories as defined by G2’s research team.\n\nSupplementary categories are commonly seen in solutions across competitors but are not necessary to the core functionality of the solution. A product suite is not required to have products in any supplementary categories to qualify for inclusion in the suite category.\n\nProduct suites use the same Satisfaction and Market Presence scoring methodology as software products, but scores are aggregated across categories, with core categories receiving greater weight than supplementary categories.\n\nYou can check the requirements for a suite category by navigating to the corresponding category page on G2, and then referring to the core categories listed. For example, to be eligible for a Sales Platforms suite category, your suite must have one or more products in the CRM and Sales Analytics product categories.\n\nServices\n\nA service provider’s G2 Score is calculated using two scoring components: Satisfaction and Market Presence/Proficiency.\n\nSatisfaction\n\nG2’s Satisfaction score for service providers is derived from the following metrics.\n\nMetricDescriptionImportanceReview response dataG2’s service provider review form contains a distinct set of service-focused attributes that assess the provider-client relationship, including Professionalism, Expertise of Team, Responsiveness, Execution Ability, and Communication Skills.HighReview volumeTo assess popularity and statistical significance, review response data is weighted based on the total number of reviews.HighReview recencyBecause recent reviews are more relevant to buyers, older reviews are weighted less.

Each review is assigned a readability score using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease scale.Low\n\nMarket Presence/Proficiency\n\nG2's Market Presence/Proficiency score for service providers incorporates metrics that assess a service provider’s proficiency, experience, and reach.\n\nMetric groupMetricDescriptionImportanceCapabilities and CompetenciesCategory ExpertiseThe number of distinct software competencies associated with an ecosystem service provider, as verified by G2’s Market Research team.\n\nThis metric is only used for providers within child categories of the Ecosystem Service Providers parent category.\n\nHighCompany AgeYear FoundedThe year the company was founded. Service providers who have been in business longer are weighted more positively.MediumGeographic DiversityReviewer CountriesThe number of unique countries represented among a provider’s reviewers.MediumOperating CountriesThe number of countries where a provider conducts business, as reported by ZoomInfo.MediumLanguagesThe number of languages supported by a service provider, as reported by the provider.Low\n\nAccessing your scoring data\n\nYou can access Satisfaction and Market Presence scores for your product via the Competitors tab in my.G2.\n\nmy.G2 displays the raw inputs into G2's Satisfaction and Market Presence scores, which are updated based on the cadences listed in the Metric update frequency section. For more information on how this data is used to calculate your product's G2 score, refer to the Normalization and Employee count and revenue sections.\n\nFor further questions related to data from third-party sources, please contact G2 Support first. You might be required to contact third-party sources directly to request updates.\n\nYou can also visualize the distribution of your product's reviews relative to G2's review decay algorithm from the Review Activity tab.\n\nRefer to the Review Decay section for more information.\n\nScoring appendix\n\nThis section provides supplemental information about G2’s Satisfaction and Market Presence scores.\n\nNormalization\n\nTo ensure buyers understand how your product performs relative to your competitive landscape, G2 weights and normalizes scoring for all products in your category on a 0 - 100 scale.\n\nThis means your product’s rank is determined by both raw scores as well as the distribution of scores across the competitors in your category.\n\nFor example, if multiple products are near the category average, small differences in absolute scores can be assigned extra magnitude during the normalization process to ensure that buyers can easily identify differences between products.\n\nReview decay\n\nTo ensure that Satisfaction and Market Presence scoring maintain relevance to buyers at any point in time, G2 applies a decay to reviews as they age. Decay begins the moment a review is submitted and recalculates daily.\n\nSpecifically, a review decays gradually for the first 90 days and maintains a stronger weight for the first 18 months, after which the rate of decay accelerates. After about three years, the review reaches approximately 3% of its original weight and maintains that weight in perpetuity.\n\nReview decay resets if a reviewer updates their existing review.\n\nBusiness partners\n\nUsers who have a business relationship with a vendor, such as resellers, can often provide valuable insight and are not restricted from leaving reviews on G2. However, because of the potential bias of such relationships, business partner reviews do not impact the star rating, G2 Score, Satisfaction or Market Presence scores, Best Software lists, or other G2 ranking algorithms. These reviews are flagged with a \"Business Partner\" label on the review.\n\nGuest users\n\nUsers who have been invited to use a software outside of their organization or use the software for a one-time or occasional purpose are not restricted from leaving reviews on G2. Guest user reviews do not impact the star rating, G2 Score, Satisfaction or Market Presence scores, Best Software lists, or other G2 ranking algorithms. These reviews are flagged with a \"Guest User\" label on the review.\n\nWeb presence\n\nThis section provides more information about the third-party sources G2 uses to assess web presence:\n\nMoz Product Page Authority predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engine result pages (SERP). G2 uses the authority of pages highlighting the features and functionality of a product to benchmark web presence against both the competitive landscape and other products a vendor might offer.\n\nMoz Domain Authority predicts how well a domain will rank on SERP and tracks the overall strength of a vendor’s website in organic SEO rankings.\n\nSEMrush Total Traffic measures the sum of organic and adwords traffic to a company’s site, reported via the Domain Overview Reports API. G2 uses total traffic as a relative scale (low, medium, high) to evaluate a vendor’s strength in traffic. This API includes US databases only.\n\nSEMrush Traffic Quality measures how well a company ranks organically and the value of their ranking keywords. G2 calculates this metric by dividing SEMrush’s organic cost (the value of their organic traffic if it were purchased through a pay-per-click advertising channel) by the total number of organic keywords for the website. Traffic quality uses a relative scale (low, medium, high) to evaluate a vendor’s strength in organic traffic and SEO.\n\nSpyfu Traffic Budget tracks ad spend by crawling search results, reported via their V1 API. G2 uses traffic budget as a relative scale (low, medium, high) to account for inorganic web presence growth.\n\nSTAT Search Analytics tracks company-branded search terms to measure the overall interest in a product or company and provide a forward-looking measure of how many users or customers a product may have. G2 makes adjustments to the raw search volume numbers to account for searches that may be unrelated to the software product. This information is combined with other web signals to estimate the level of interest in a particular product.\n\nEmployee count and revenue\n\nEmployee count is traditionally used as a proxy for assessing company size, available resources, and a predictor for revenue, as more employees enable greater productivity and output overall.\n\nG2 believes this information is important to convey to buyers to help them assess the success of the software product, expectations on implementation and support, and how established a company is. G2 uses multiple third-party sources — including ZoomInfo, LinkedIn, and Crunchbase — to mitigate inaccuracies in employee count and revenue data.\n\nCompanies that have significant revenue-generating operations outside of B2B software only receive the number of employees estimated to be focused on revenue-generating activities related to B2B software.\n\nFor example, if Delivery Company X has a B2B-facing application for businesses to manage and monitor their package deliveries, but their public financial statements indicate that their delivery management software only accounts for 3% of their revenue, a maximum of 3% of their total employees will be used in Market Presence calculations.\n\nFurther, for large enterprises, G2 maps the organization’s total employee count and revenue to individual products and categories based on the information available, including a combination of weighted review counts and data from third-party sources, such as SERP ranking for individual products.\n\nMetric update frequency\n\nG2 updates first- and third-party data on the following cadence.\n\nSourceUpdate frequencyCrunchbaseDailyEmployee shareDailyG2 review counts and ratingsDailySEMRushWeeklySTAT Search AnalyticsWeeklyX (formerly Twitter)WeeklyGlassdoorMonthlyLinkedinMonthlyMozMonthlySpyfuMonthlyZoomInfoMonthly\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\nWhen a product is acquired, G2 tracks metrics for both the acquiring and acquired organization to support Market Presence calculations.\n\nThe impact of an acquisition will depend both on the date of the acquisition and on the type of acquisition. Changes to web and social metrics, if warranted, will occur as soon as the taxonomy changes are reflected on G2.com. Changes to G2’s employee and revenue estimates are phased in over 18 months from the close of the acquisition.\n\nTo request updates to your company’s metrics following acquisition, please refer to the submission guidelines, then contact G2 Support.\n\nG2 uses the following logic to handle Market Presence updates for mergers and acquisitions:\n\nType of AcquisitionDescriptionFinancial AcquisitionPure financial acquisitions, such as acquisition by a private equity firm, have no direct impact on Market Presence because there is no change to the vendor’s employee count, web presence, or other firmographic details.Subsidiary AcquisitionBusiness operations, website, and branding remain independent. G2 continues to track the employees and revenue for the acquired organization but makes an upward adjustment to these metrics to reflect the additional resources of the parent company. The size of the adjustment depends on the relative size of the two organizations but tends to have a modest impact on Market Presence. Web metrics, social metrics, year founded, vendor employee growth, and Glassdoor ratings continue to reflect the acquired organization. This adjustment is not viewable in my.G2.Divisional AcquisitionBusiness operations are combined, but the acquired organization maintains its own website and branding. This typically results in separate LinkedIn, Crunchbase, and ZoomInfo profiles for the organizations. G2 continues to track the employees and revenue for the acquired organization but makes an upward adjustment to these metrics to reflect the additional resources of the parent company. The size of the adjustment depends on the relative size of the two organizations. Web metrics, social metrics, year founded, vendor employee growth, and Glassdoor ratings continue to reflect the acquired organization. Although the impact is larger than a subsidiary acquisition, the overall change to Market Presence may be modest, as product-specific Market Presence metrics receive the greatest weight in scoring. This adjustment is not viewable in my.G2.Company MergeBusiness operations, websites, and branding for acquiring and acquired organizations are combined, but products can still be purchased independently. Employees and revenue of the acquired organization are gradually phased in to reflect the new employee count and revenue of the acquiring organization. After the phase-in is complete, G2 estimates the share of employees and revenue in the same fashion as all multi-product vendors. Web metrics, social metrics, year founded, vendor employee growth, and Glassdoor ratings are updated shortly after the acquisition is recorded.Product MergeBusiness operations, website, and branding for acquiring and acquired organizations are combined, and each product’s functionality is combined into one offering. All relevant reviews, as evaluated by G2’s research team, are moved to the new, combined product. The combined product inherits the categorization of the old products and the estimated share of employees and revenue dedicated to each category. Employees and revenue of the acquired organization are gradually phased in to reflect the new employee count and revenue of the acquiring organization. After the phase-in is complete, G2 estimates the share of employees and revenue in the same fashion as all multi-category products. Web metrics, social metrics, year founded, vendor employee growth, and Glassdoor ratings are updated shortly after the acquisition is recorded.\n\nSorting\n\nThis section describes the logic used to sort reviews on G2 product profiles, products or services on G2 category pages, and competitors on G2 alternatives pages.\n\nReviews\n\nBy default, reviews on your G2 profile are displayed using G2 Sort, a custom sorting algorithm that incorporates the following data points:\n\nRecency of the review\n\nAmount of feedback provided in the review\n\nAttribution (Did the reviewer keep their name and company public?)\n\nWhether the reviewer is a current user of the solution (included a screenshot)\n\nCommunity engagement with the review\n\nG2 also offers the following review sorting options to buyers:\n\nMost Recent: Sort by date.\n\nMost Helpful: Sort by highest community engagement, including likes and comments.\n\nHighest/Lowest Rated: Sort by star rating.\n\nThe star rating for your product is based on responses to the Likely to Recommend question on the G2 review form.\n\nG2 calculates the average star rating for your product by dividing responses to the Likely to Recommend question in half, then rounding up to the nearest half star.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros and Cons highlights the strengths and weaknesses of products relative to their category.\n\nAll text-based product reviews, including G2 Product Suite reviews, are considered for Pros and Cons. Video reviews and business partner reviews are not included in the analysis.\n\nG2 examines all reviews for a category from the past 18 months, then identifies five common Pros and five common Cons across the category. Pros and Cons are then assigned to a product based on semantic similarity to at least one of their reviews.\n\nPros and Cons are updated every 30 days on the 17th of the month and reviewed by G2 for quality assurance.\n\nIf a product is in multiple G2 categories, the top five Pros and Cons, based on the highest number of associated reviews, across all categories will be displayed.\n\nOverall Review Sentiment\n\nOverall Review Sentiment provides insights from G2 reviews into several measures of customer sentiment for products, product suites, and services.\n\nThe Overall Review Sentiment panel appears when a product, product suite, or service has at least 10 responses to one of the corresponding review form questions.\n\nIf a product, product suite, or service does not have at least 10 responses to any of the corresponding questions, the Overall Review Sentiment panel will not appear on the profile.\n\nReview sentiment data is refreshed daily.\n\nProduct profiles and product suites\n\nG2 displays average responses to the following review form questions in the Overall Review Sentiment panel for products and product suites.\n\nSentiment scaleReview form questionAnswer choicesTime to ImplementHow long did it take to go live?< 1 day, < 1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, > 12 months, NeverEase of SetupEase of SetupAnswer choices range from 1 - 7.Return on InvestmentWhat is your organization's estimated ROI on {reviewed_product} (payback period in months)?6 months or less, 7-12 months, 13-24 months, 24-36 months, 37-48 months, 48+ months, Never Got Full Payback\n\nG2 averages and scales review responses for the corresponding review form questions to generate Overall Review Sentiment charts.\n\nServices\n\nG2 displays average responses to the following review form questions in the Overall Review Sentiment panel for services.\n\nSentiment ScaleReview Form QuestionAnswer ChoicesCommunicationCommunication SkillsAnswer choices range from 1 - 7.ResponsivenessResponsivenessAnswer choices range from 1 - 7.Execution AbilityExecution AbilityAnswer choices range from 1 - 7.\n\nResponses to questions with an answer choice range of 1-7 are converted to a percentage and scaled from 0 to 10.\n\nCategory\n\nBy default, G2 category pages are sorted by your product or service’s G2 Score. For more information on how G2 Score is calculated, refer to the G2 Score section.\n\nG2 also offers the following category sorting options to buyers:\n\nPopularity: Sort by the total number of reviews.\n\nSatisfaction: Sort by Satisfaction score.\n\nTo be eligible for G2 Sort, a category must have at least three products with 10+ reviews. Otherwise, products will be sorted by popularity by default.\n\nAlternatives\n\nG2 alternatives pages enable buyers to find solutions most similar in functionality to the featured product or service.\n\nG2 uses the following logic to sort alternatives:\n\nThe number of categories shared between the featured solution and the competitor (breadth of similarity).\n\nThe number of reviews attributed to each category of overlap (depth of similarity).\n\nThe number of comparisons to the competitor made by G2 users (G2 buyer similarity).\n\nComparisons\n\nG2 profile pages list the top five comparisons performed by users for each product.\n\nReporting\n\nG2 releases seasonal market reports to help buyers learn about trends in software and services, compare review ratings, and find the right solution for their needs.\n\nRefer to G2's Research Agenda to access key dates for upcoming G2 reports, including review submission deadlines and report publication dates.\n\nSeasonal market reports are released at the category level. G2 only offers a report when the entire category meets a specific review threshold. For more information on the requirements for a category to be eligible for each report, navigate to the corresponding section of this documentation using the links below.\n\nG2 currently offers seasonal Grid reports per eligible category (including Segment Grids, Regional Grids, and Momentum Grids), as well as a suite of Index reports (including Usability Index, Results Index, Implementation Index, and Relationship Index).\n\nG2 also publishes an annual Best Software report to celebrate superlative software across G2.\n\nGrid® reports\n\nG2 Grid® helps buyers understand the competitive landscape for a category by plotting each product or service against Satisfaction and Market Presence scores.\n\nG2 also shows live Grids® on category pages that have at least three products with 10+ reviews. Placement on live Grids® is updated daily.\n\nFor a software or service category to be eligible for a Grid® report, it must have at least six products with 10+ reviews, and 150+ reviews overall. To qualify for inclusion, a product or service must have at least 10 reviews in the corresponding category.\n\nTo be eligible for a product suite Grid®, a solution must have 10 or more reviews across the defined core categories. An eligible solution’s positioning will be further influenced by supplementary categories with or more reviews. For more information, refer to the Product Suites section.\n\nSegment Grids®\n\nG2 offers Grids® at the market-segment level, which only includes reviews from reviewers who are employed by a company within a particular market segment. G2 uses the following definitions for market segments:\n\nSmall Business: 50 or fewer employees\n\nMid-Market: 51–1,000 employees\n\nEnterprise: 1,001+ employees\n\nRegional Grids®\n\nG2 offers Grids® for each global region, which only includes reviews from reviewers in the corresponding region. G2 uses the following global regions:\n\nAfrica\n\nANZ\n\nAsia\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nEMEA\n\nEurope\n\nMiddle East\n\nMiddle East & Africa\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nRefer to the Reporting appendix for more information on regional definitions.\n\nMomentum Grid®\n\nG2 offers a Momentum Grid® that highlights products based on growth. The base Market Presence scoring model for this Grid® is adjusted to favor products with large year-over-year changes in employee count, review volume, social following, and web presence.\n\nBoth percent (relative) change and total (absolute) change are considered.\n\nYear-over-year changes are tracked from the product’s first appearance on a Grid®, meaning that the earliest a product can appear on Momentum Grid® is one year following its first Grid® report.\n\nIndex reports\n\nG2 releases a suite of index reports that highlight the success of a product in a particular area of business. A unique, patent-pending algorithm is used to rank products based on responses to specific groups of questions on the G2 review form. To be eligible for an index report, a category must have:\n\n150+ reviews across all products in the category.\n\nAt least six products with 10+ reviews and at least five responses to the report-specific questions described in the following table.\n\nIndex reportReview form questions (listed in order of importance)Usability\n\nEase of Use\n\nEase of Admin\n\nMeets Requirements\n\nWhat percentage of users adopted the product?\n\nResults\n\nMeets Requirements\n\nWhat percentage of users adopted the product?\n\nEstimated ROI\n\nHow likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?\n\nImplementation\n\nHow long did it take you to go live?\n\nEase of Setup\n\nHow did you implement?\n\nWhat percentage of users adopted the product?\n\nRelationship\n\nEase of Doing Business With\n\nQuality of Support\n\nHow likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?\n\nTo qualify for inclusion, a product or service must have at least 10 reviews.\n\nG2 also offers each index report per market segment, which only includes reviews from reviewers employed by a company within a particular market segment. G2 uses the following definitions for market segments:\n\nSmall Business: 50 or fewer employees\n\nMid-Market: 51–1,000 employees\n\nEnterprise: 1,001+ employees\n\nBest Software\n\nEach year, G2 publishes Best Software reports to celebrate top-performing products and vendors across G2.\n\nTo be eligible for Best Software Products and Best Software Companies lists, a vendor must have at least 50 published reviews (in aggregate across all of their G2-listed products) in the preceding calendar year.\n\nOnly reviews submitted between January 1st and December 31st of the preceding calendar year are considered for eligibility and ranking. Once a vendor has 50 reviews in the preceding year, all of their G2-listed products are eligible for inclusion in a Best Software Products list.\n\nBusiness partner reviews count toward the eligibility requirements for Best Software lists, but they are not included in ranking calculations.\n\nTo compare products and vendors across different categories, G2 uses normalized Satisfaction and Market Presence scores. For more information, refer to the G2 Score and Normalization sections.\n\nBest Software Companies\n\nThe top 100 software companies are ranked based on weighted Satisfaction and Market Presence scores. Specifically, G2 aggregates Satisfaction scores across all of a vendor’s products with 5+ reviews in the evaluation period and 10+ reviews overall. Market Presence is aggregated and scored relative to all companies with 10+ reviews.\n\nG2 also releases regional Best Software Companies reports, which highlight the top 50 companies from the corresponding global region. Several factors are used to determine a software company’s region, including where the company was founded, where its executive team resides, and where the majority of its workforce is located.\n\nThe ANZ, France, and Germany regional Best Software Companies lists only require 25 reviews in the preceding calendar year to be eligible.\n\nBest Software Products\n\nThe top 100 products are ranked based on weighted Satisfaction and Market Presence scores. Specifically, the score for a product is first calculated for each category, and then those category scores are combined to create an overall score for the product. The overall score is then weighted based on the competitiveness of each category.\n\nCompetitiveness is determined by how many products are competing in each category and how many reviews those products receive.\n\nG2 also releases the following supplemental Best Software Products reports:\n\nHighest Satisfaction: Ranking is based solely on Satisfaction scores.\n\nFastest Growing Products: Ranking is based on Momentum scores.\n\nSegment: Rankings are based on reviews submitted by reviewers from the corresponding market segment.\n\nBest Software by Function: Rankings are based on reviews from the corresponding top-level G2 categories. Products must have a minimum of 10 reviews within the corresponding category to be eligible.\n\nRookies of the Year: This report includes the top 25 products that were listed on G2 and received their first review during the previous calendar year. To qualify for inclusion, both the product and its corresponding vendor must be newly-listed.\n\nVendors must still meet the Best Software review threshold for their products to be included in a supplemental report. Scores are weighted and normalized similarly to the main Best Software Products report.\n\nAll supplemental Best Software Products reports, with the exception of the Rookies of the Year report, list the top 50 products.\n\nAccessing your reports and awards\n\nYou can access your reports and report-based awards from the Report Library tab in my.G2,\n\nG2 displays draft reports in this tab approximately two weeks prior to each report release.\n\nReporting appendix\n\nReport schedule\n\nRefer to G2's Research Agenda to access key dates for upcoming G2 reports, including review submission deadlines and report publication dates.\n\nRegional definitions\n\nThe following table lists the countries included in each of G2’s regional reports."
