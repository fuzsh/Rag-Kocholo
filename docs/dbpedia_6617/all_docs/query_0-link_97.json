However, certain advanced features may incur fees.

Lastly, Bill Pay allows you to sync your bill data directly to your accounting software.\n\nAs a Mercury customer, you have the option to send USD international wires for free. We offer two options for how those wires are processed. The first, coded as SHA, is standard among most banks and while free to you, may result in intermediary bank fees that are absorbed by your recipient. The second, coded as OUR, gives you the option to pay a flat fee of $15 so that any intermediary fees will be charged back to Mercury, making it more likely your recipient will receive the full amount.\n\nMercury works with two FDIC-insured banks, Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust. You can locate your Mercury account’s banking provider by logging in and viewing the banking partner listed on your Mercury statements.Through each of our partner banks, Mercury customers get access to a sweep network of trusted banks. This sweep network provides up to $5M in FDIC insurance by automatically spreading your deposits across up to 20 different banks, without requiring you to open and manage separate bank accounts.Our Treasury product is offered through an additional partner, Apex Clearing Corp, who is a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer.

Your pay period may be daily or monthly, depending on the average cash balance in your Mercury account. We’ll automatically deduct your full balance from your chosen Mercury account on a date of your choosing. You can also pay off your card early at any time.\n\nMercury has a startup-friendly underwriting model — we understand that our customers may be newly incorporated, retain low cash balances, and have limited credit or banking history. Because all IO customers hold cash within Mercury, we can more accurately understand your financial position, and offer a higher credit limit than what is typically offered to startups by traditional banks.\n\nYour credit limit will be determined by your Mercury account balance. Your limit might increase as your Mercury balance increases, but your credit limit may also decrease. Currently, we reassess your business limit following large withdrawals and deposits.\n\nWe don’t charge annual fees or foreign exchange fees on IO cards . And because you’ll pay off your IO card automatically each month, you won’t incur any interest.Customers have the option to select a paid Mercury plan (starting at $35/month).

Apex Clearing Corp maintains a detailed record of each Treasury customer’s holdings and is prohibited from using any of these funds or securities for its own purposes, and from commingling them with its own customers’ holdings.
