        "text": "-- Completed enrollment in bempikibart atopic dermatitis (AD) Phase 2 clinical trial and increased trial size to 121 patients based on Part B patient demand --\n\n-- Bempikibart Phase 2 topline results in AD and alopecia areata (AA) remain on-track for Q4'24 --\n\n-- Enrolling patients in the Phase 2 basket trial of ADX-097 for complement mediated renal diseases; initial open-label data expected by year-end 2024 and topline results in 2H'25 --\n\n-- Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $107.6 million as of June 30, 2024, expected to provide financial runway through four Phase 2 clinical milestones and into mid-2026 --\n\nWALTHAM, Mass., Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Q32 Bio Inc. (Nasdaq: QTTB) (\"Q32 Bio\"), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing biologic therapeutics to restore immune homeostasis, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and provided recent corporate updates.\n\n\"Q32 Bio made strong progress advancing both bempikibart and ADX-097 in Phase 2 clinical trials,\" said Jodie Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of Q32 Bio. \"We completed enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial of bempikibart in AD, exceeding our initial enrollment target due to strong patient demand, and we look forward to sharing topline results from the Phase 2 clinical trials in AD and AA in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\n\"Additionally, we are enrolling patients in our Phase 2 basket trial of ADX-097 for complement mediated renal diseases. We expect to share initial data from this trial by the end of this year, with topline results expected in the second half of 2025. Plans remain on-track to further expand development of ADX-097 with the initiation of a second Phase 2 clinical trial in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis in the first half of next year, with topline results expected in the second half of 2025.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights\n\nCompleted enrollment in the ongoing SIGNAL-AD Phase 2 clinical trial of bempikibart in AD and increased the trial size to 121 patients based on patient demand, with topline results remaining on-track to be released in the fourth quarter of 2024. Bempikibart is a fully human anti-IL-7Rα antibody that is designed to re-regulate adaptive immune function by blocking IL-7 and TSLP signaling, both of which contribute to inflammation and injury in a diversity of autoimmune disorders. SIGNAL-AD is a two-part Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial evaluating bempikibart in adult patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe AD. Part A was conducted to evaluate safety, PK, and to enable dose selection for Part B of the clinical trial. Part A was completed, but data remains blinded. Part B is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bempikibart as compared with placebo. In Part B, patients were enrolled 1:1 in the bempikibart 200 mg every-other-week (Q2W) subcutaneous (SC) flat dose and placebo arms for 12 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint is the mean percent change from baseline to week 14 in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. Patients will be followed for an additional 12 weeks following completion of treatment. A total of 121 patients were enrolled, including 15 patients in Part A. Total enrollment exceeded the initial target of approximately 100 patients due to Part B patient enrollment demand.\n\nBempikibart Phase 2 clinical trial in AA is on track, with topline results expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. Enrollment was completed in the first quarter of 2024 in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with severe AA treated over 24 weeks. Patients were randomized 3:1 in the bempikibart 200 mg Q2W SC flat dose and placebo arms. The primary endpoint is the mean percent change from baseline on the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score at week 24. Patients will be followed for an additional 12 weeks following completion of treatment.\n\nEnrolling patients in the Phase 2 basket trial of ADX-097 for complement mediated renal diseases. ADX-097 is designed to be a tissue-targeted inhibitor of complement activation while minimizing systemic complement blockade and is currently in a trial for the treatment of patients with renal diseases associated with increased complement activation. The Phase 2 open label clinical trial is evaluating the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of ADX-097 administered subcutaneously in participants with IgA Nephropathy (IgAN), Lupus Nephritis (LN), or C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G). The trial remains on-track, with initial open-label data expected by year-end 2024 and topline results expected in the second half of 2025. Q32 Bio also plans to evaluate ADX-097 in a Phase 2 clinical trial in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV), which is expected to commence in the first half of 2025 with topline results expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nSelected for inclusion in the Russell 3000® Index. Q32 Bio joined the Russell 3000® Index following the conclusion of the 2024 Russell Indexes annual reconstitution in June. The Russell Indexes capture the 4,000 largest U.S. stocks as of April 28, 2024, ranked by total market capitalization.\n\nFinancial Results\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $107.6 million as of June 30, 2024. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, and investments are sufficient to fund operations into mid-2026, through the following four Phase 2 clinical milestones: topline readouts from the bempikibart trials in AD and AA in Q4'24 and topline readouts from the ADX-097 renal basket and AAV trials in 2H'25.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $13.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in expense of $5.4 million was primarily due to higher clinical trial and manufacturing costs associated with the Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the use of bempikibart to treat AA and AD.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in expense of $2.0 million was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense as well as increased consulting and public company-related costs.\n\nNet loss was $17.0 million, or $1.42 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $5.8 million, or $16.69 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nAbout Q32 Bio\n\nQ32 Bio is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing biologic therapeutics targeting potent regulators of the innate and adaptive immune systems to re-balance immunity in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Q32 Bio's lead programs, focused on the IL-7 / TSLP receptor pathways and complement system, address immune dysregulation to help patients take back control of their lives.\n\nQ32 Bio's program for adaptive immunity, bempikibart (ADX-914), is a fully human anti-IL-7Rα antibody that re-regulates adaptive immune function for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. It is being evaluated in two Phase 2 trials for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The IL-7 and TSLP pathways have been genetically and biologically implicated in driving several T cell-mediated pathological processes in numerous autoimmune diseases. Q32 Bio's program for innate immunity, ADX-097, is based on a novel platform enabling tissue-targeted regulation of the complement system without long-term systemic blockade – a key differentiator versus current complement therapeutics. Q32 Bio has completed a first-in-human, Phase 1 ascending dose clinical study of ADX-097 in healthy volunteers.\n\nFor more information, visit www.Q32Bio.com.\n\nAvailability of Other Information About Q32 Bio\n\nInvestors and others should note that we communicate with our investors and the public using our company website www.Q32Bio.com, including, but not limited to, company disclosures, investor presentations and FAQs, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, press releases, public conference call transcripts and webcast transcripts, as well as on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.
