We use product data, strategic methodologies and expert insights to inform all of our content and guide you in making the best decisions for your business journey.\n\nWe reviewed several merchant account companies using a detailed methodology to help you find the five best high-risk merchant account providers. Our ratings consider multiple factors that included having a transparent fee structure, offering contactless payments and invoicing, if advanced features like offshore account support and chargeback monitoring were available, plus real user reviews on third-party websites. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nBest Overall\n\nPaymentCloud\n\n4.6\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPayment methods\n\nCredit card, ACH, eCheck or crypto\n\nEarly termination fee\n\nNone\n\nTransaction fees\n\nAs low as 2.4% plus 10 cents\n\nLearn More\n\nOn PaymentCloud's Website\n\nCredit card, ACH, eCheck or crypto\n\nNone\n\nAs low as 2.4% plus 10 cents\n\nEditor's Take\n\nPaymentCloud is one of the easiest high-risk merchant account providers to use, and it boasts excellent customer service. With this account, you can accept credit card, ACH, eCheck or cryptocurrency payments through POS, mobile or online checkout.\n\nIf you need hardware to swipe or enter cards, PaymentCloud will give you a free retail or mobile EMV terminal when you sign up for a zero-cost credit card processing account (i.e., offer your customer cash payment discounts).\n\nPaymentCloud caters to low-, medium- and high-risk merchants, including:\n\nBail bonds\n\nCruise lines\n\nConsulting\n\nPharmacy\n\ne-pharmacy\n\nAdult products\n\nGentlemen’s clubs\n\nGuns and firearms\n\nLaw offices\n\nNutraceuticals\n\nTech support\n\nTelemedicine\n\nTax prep/accountants\n\nDating sites\n\nCigars and tobacco\n\nJet charter\n\nWho should use it:\n\nPaymentCloud is a good choice for high-risk merchants in a variety of industries, from credit repair to dating sites, especially those with a high volume of monthly sales.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nHighly rated customer support\n\nLots of popular software integrations\n\nSupport for no-cost credit card processing\n\nFees aren’t shared online\n\nMonthly payment gateway fee\n\nFees & Pricing\n\nAs with many high-risk merchant account providers, PaymentCloud doesn’t necessarily provide a one-size-fits-all list of fees. In our research, we saw the following fees mentioned:\n\nVirtual terminal rate/keyed-in rate: 2.9% to 3.4% plus 25 cents\n\nSwiped rate: 2.4% plus 10 cents for swipe\n\nHigh-risk rate: 3.5% to 5% plus 25 cents\n\nIt’s worth noting that the virtual terminal rate is based on the average cost of using Authorize.Net as a payment gateway. PaymentCloud does charge a payment gateway fee of $25 per month.

Pricing for hardware varies between $170 and $400.\n\nIf the lack of fee transparency does not throw you, Durango is a company that can be a great help, especially when you are low on options but want a fair and upfront service provider.\n\nBest for International Merchants\n\nSMB Global\n\n3.8\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

The greater the risk, the harder it will be to find a traditional bank or payment processing service provider. Still, you’re not out of luck, as many vendors specialize in serving high-risk businesses.\n\nReasons a Merchant May Be Considered High-risk\n\nThere are many reasons a payment processing platform may characterize your account as high-risk. Every provider has a different set of criteria, but here are some general guidelines around what may be labeled high-risk:\n\nHigh transaction volume: Merchants may be considered high-risk if they have a high volume of transactions or have a high average transaction rate. If a merchant processes over $20,000 in payments per month or has an average transaction of $500 or more, they may be classified as high-risk.\n\nAccepting international payments: If a merchant sells to customers internationally in countries that are listed as high-risk of fraud, they may be considered high-risk (any country except the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia or the countries in Europe).\n\nNew merchant: If a merchant has never processed payments before or only has a minimal history of processing transactions, they may be considered high-risk because they don’t have a track record.\n\nHigh-risk industry: While a merchant may have a spotless record, they may be labeled high-risk because the industry they are working in is considered to be at a higher risk of fraud, returns or chargebacks. For example, subscription-based companies are labeled high-risk because many people sign up for a trial and forget to cancel their payments. When they look over their statements and see the forgotten charges, they often charge back the payment.\n\nLow credit score: If the merchant has a low credit score, they may be deemed high-risk.\n\nTypes of Businesses Commonly Considered High-risk\n\nIt’s helpful to know ahead of time whether your industry is considered high-risk so you can plan accordingly. Some businesses that typically fall into this category include:\n\nAdult industry\n\nTravel, including airlines, cruises and vacation planners\n\nFurniture and electronic stores\n\nGambling\n\nOnline dating\n\nE-commerce\n\nMultilevel marketing (MLM)\n\nE-cigarette, cannabidiol (CBD) and vape shops\n\nSubscription services and companies with recurring payment plans\n\nDebt collection\n\nHow To Choose a High-risk Account Service Provider\n\nBefore choosing a payment processor, you’ll want to read the contract carefully, as every bank and payment processing platform is different and has different terms for the merchants they label high-risk. As you look for the best high-risk merchant account service provider, keep these considerations in mind:\n\nWho does the vendor accept? Even account providers that specialize in high-risk merchants don’t accept all businesses. If you’re an offshore company, have very poor credit or operate an especially higher-risk business, look for vendors that cater specifically to your circumstances.\n\nHigher fees: Vendors tend to balance their risk in serving your business by charging higher fees than low-risk merchants would pay.\n\nYour credit score matters: A business owner’s or business’s low credit score could impact the approval odds for a merchant account. If you’re being rejected for merchant accounts, you may have to work on your credit score for a better chance.\n\nWhen you apply for a merchant account, you’ll be required to provide business and tax documents. After your application has been processed, your payment provider will assess whether you are a high-risk or low-risk merchant and adapt their plan accordingly.\n\nHigh-risk Means Higher Fees\n\nEvery credit card processing platform is different, but high-risk merchant accounts will be subject to higher fees across the board. Generally, processing fees for all transactions will be higher, sometimes more than double that of low-risk merchant accounts. Although low-risk merchants are also paying a chargeback fee (a fee you pay when a customer disputes the charge directly with their credit card), high-risk merchants generally pay higher chargeback fees.\n\nA high-risk merchant may be obligated to lock into longer contract terms, an early termination fee or a monthly or annual fee. High-risk accounts may also be subject to a rolling reserve, where the payment processor holds a certain percentage of your income until it can further verify your transactions were not fraudulent or at risk of chargeback.\n\nHigh-risk vs. Low-risk Merchant Accounts\n\nThere are a few general characteristics that make a merchant low risk to a payment processor. Low-risk merchants typically have:\n\nLow transaction volume (less than $20,000 per month)\n\nAverage transactions under $500\n\nOperations in one country that is labeled low risk (the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia and the countries in Europe)\n\nOne currency\n\nVery low or zero chargebacks and a low percentage of returns\n\nIndustries labeled low-risk\n\nKeep in mind that your risk status can change as your business develops. For example, if you go through a high period of growth, your provider may start considering your business high-risk. If you expand to work in different countries or shift industries, a payment processor may consider this a change in risk level. If this happens, your payment processor will either change your status or may drop you as a client if they do not support high-risk merchants, at which point you’ll need to find a new provider to process your payments.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo choose vendors that are the best fit for high-risk merchants, Forbes Advisor researched the industry and analyzed several different providers. Businesses operating in high-risk industries will have different needs than most. As a result, we were specifically looking for providers that provide services to these merchants.\n\nThen, we each provider according to how well they scored in five categories of features using 15 different metrics that were weighted to favor features that high-risk small business owners find valuable in a provider. The following is a breakdown of the categories we used to rank the providers that made the top of the list.\n\nPricing\n\nMany consumers value a transparent fee structure. Companies that provide this information up front were rated more highly than if contacting a representative is required. Companies that offered online quotes for their pricing also fared better in our ratings. Pricing accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring.\n\nFeatures\n\nDifferent businesses will have varying levels of needs. Companies that provide versatile options to meet those needs received higher scores. Features we looked for include a reporting dashboard, invoicing, data exports, contactless payments, chargeback monitoring and fast deposits.\n\nAdditionally, having reliable, accessible support, including offshore account support, is crucial when things go awry. Companies with multiple channels of communication available were rated more highly than those that rely solely on limited channels. We weighted features at 60% of our total score.\n\nThird-party Reviews\n\nWe took a look at reviews and recognition from customers and third-party reviewers to see what actual users think of the services. Companies were scored both on the average rating and the number of reviews. The review sites we looked at included the Better Business Bureau (BBB), Capterra and Trustpilot. Reviews given by real users that scored high (4 out of 5 or higher) fared better in our rankings. These accounted for 15% of the total score.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nFor our final review, we looked at a high-risk merchant service provider’s popularity and stand-out functionality as noted by real users to determine our expert’s score, which made up 15% of the total score.\n\nLearn how we test credit card processors.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nStax\n\nFree Trial\n\nNo\n\nOffers\n\nFirst Month Free\n\nPricing\n\n$99 per month, 7 cents to 15 cents per transaction plus interchange rate\n\n1\n\nStax\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Stax's Website\n\n2\n\nNorth Payments\n\nFree Trial\n\nNo\n\nOffers\n\n$0 Setup with Free Equipment + No Cancellation Fee\n\nPricing\n\nZero Cost Processing Options - Guaranteed Cost Savings\n\n2\n\nNorth Payments\n\nLearn More\n\nOn North Payments' Website\n\n3\n\nPayment Depot\n\nFree Trial\n\nNo\n\nOffer\n\nFirst Month Free\n\nPricing\n\n$59 per month, $0.07 - $0.15 per transaction + interchange rate\n\n3\n\nPayment Depot\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Payment Depot's Website\n\n4\n\nPayment Cloud\n\nFree trial\n\nNo\n\nOffers\n\nFree terminal, Zero Fee Processing Options, Dedicated Account Manager\n\nPricing\n\nZero cost processing options, Customized interchange + Pricing\n\n4\n\nPayment Cloud\n\nLearn More\n\nOn PaymentCloud's Website"
