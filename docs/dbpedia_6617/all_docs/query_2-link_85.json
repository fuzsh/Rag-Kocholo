        "text": "Net Promoter Score®, or NPS®, measures customer experience and predicts business growth. This proven metric transformed the business world and now provides the core measurement for customer experience management programs the world round.\n\nThe NPS Calculation\n\nCalculate your NPS using the answer to a key question, using a 0-10 scale: How likely is it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\n\nRespondents are grouped as follows:\n\nPromoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth.\n\nPassives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n\nDetractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.\n\nSubtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters yields the Net Promoter Score, which can range from a low of -100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to a high of 100 (if every customer is a Promoter).\n\nA Core Metric for CEM\n\nUse your NPS as the key measure of your customers’ overall perception of your brand. Because NPS is a leading indicator from growth, it provides the best anchor for your customer experience management (CEM) program. Complement NPS with other metrics and insights from various points along the customer journey, and you have a comprehensive, actionable view of your customer experience performance.\n\nTrusted by Your Workforce\n\nStraightforward and easily understood by everyone from the corner office to the front line, NPS provides a touchstone for engaging your workforce in your customer experience program."
