        "text": "In our latest Industry Insider, we sit down with the CEO of the LiveScore Group, Sam Sadi to talk all about his career so far, life at LiveScore\n\nTell us about yourself, what do you do in your current role and what roles have you done previously?\n\nHello, I’m Sam Sadi, CEO of LiveScore Group. I’ve worked across the sports media and betting industries for over 25 years now, starting with founding my own business Beteurope. I later became Managing Director at Bwin, now part of Entain.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of being LiveScore Group CEO for nearly five years, since its foundation in 2019 shortly before the pandemic. I’m proud to say that during my time at LiveScore Group, we have grown our revenues to close to £200m annually and become a 700-strong team across several countries.\n\nThe organisation’s growth can be attributed to our unique strategy of connecting sports media and betting in one ecosystem, delivering everything a sports fan could need in a seamless experience, whether it’s content, news, or market-leading betting opportunities.\n\nWhat three words would you use to describe your role?\n\nAs most CEOs would say, for me it would be Vision, Strategy and Culture. The challenge is not so much in coming up with those, but in assembling the right team and creating the right environment for them to perform at their best.\n\n“Normal” isn’t a thing in sport, so what does an “average” week look like for you?\n\nIt’s all about managing my schedule as best as possible and finding opportunities to deliver the most value to the business within that time. Generally, this will be about attending meetings and looking for opportunities to make sure we are prioritizing what really matters. Always reserving time for reflection and long-term thinking is also a must.\n\nHow did you end up where you are right now? When did you know you wanted to work in sport?\n\nI grew up in a household where sport was always a priority, both participating and spectating as a fan. However, it was only during my college years that I realized I could apply my passion for sport to create business opportunities.\n\nI am fortunate to have found a way at LiveScore Group to convert my passion into our vision of Fuelling Fans Passion for Sport\n\nWhat is your number one focus when it comes to your work?\n\nWhen it comes to my work, my one constant focus is empowering all LiveScore Group staff to feel truly supported to live our vision of fuelling fans’ passion. Therefore, I focus on different areas at different times, but the key is to make sure everything we do keeps us on track with our vision and that we do it while living our values every day.\n\nWhat’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career so far?\n\nThat success is not a result of talent but of a blend of passion and persistence. If you put enough quality effort into any project, achievement will almost certainly follow.\n\nWhat are you excited about in your industry at the moment?\n\nThere’s so much to be excited about. When I look around the office and see such talent, I know the future is bright, not just for LiveScore Group but beyond and into the wider industry at large.\n\nAlongside individuals advancing through our ranks, whether they are already employed at LiveScore or engaged in our apprenticeship programmes, we anticipate a new chapter unfolding in tandem with the future trajectory of the industry.\n\nWith technological advancements scaling unprecedented heights, we foresee an era where sports enthusiasts will enjoy heightened accessibility to their favourite events, tailored viewing encounters, and enhanced in-stadium experiences facilitated by virtual reality and artificial intelligence. This convergence of sports fandom and technology has been long awaited, and we are thrilled to find ourselves at the centre of it all.\n\nCan you tell us more about the Evolution of Fan report from LiveScore?\n\nThis year, we’ve been celebrating LiveScore’s 25th anniversary, founded in 1998. For over 25 years, we’ve been fuelling fans’ passion for the sport they love and bringing them closer to the action.\n\nTo mark the milestone, we launched Evolution of Fan, a report reflecting on the past 25 years of football fandom as technology has continued to evolve and define how fans interact with and consume the game.\n\nThe report is packed with fascinating insights from nearly 25,000 football fans, looking back at some of the most iconic moments in the game and how fans have engaged with them. From the humble Teletext to real-time score updates, artificial intelligence and spatial computing that we see today, the report covers the breakthroughs alongside the ever-changing tapestry of fan culture, the matchday experience.\n\nThe final section of the report casts an eye back and looks at what lies ahead for football fans as technology and what we can expect to see in the next 25 years in terms of the impact of changing broadcasting, in-stadium experiences, and artificial intelligence.\n\nWhat are some key takeaways from the report for brands/clubs/organisations?\n\nThe report contains several data points harnessed from nearly 25,000 football fans, giving revealing insights into how the fan match experience has evolved alongside technology, allowing us to forecast how this will continue to change.\n\nThe fan match experience is a highly sought-after area for brands to utilise, given the huge audience and interest. As seen in the report, 92% of fans engage with football news and content daily, while 93% believe the ability to keep up to date with football news in real time has positively impacted the game. Though this is no surprise, it indicates that as technology continues to evolve and allow new ways for fans to interact with the game, the market will grow even further.\n\nIf you were to give a piece of advice to someone wanting to do your role or work for LiveScore, what would you say?\n\nI’d say there are two things for anyone wanting to pursue a career in sport. Firstly, discover what you love about sport and find the opportunity within it. Then, ask yourself: Why and how do I love this? Once you’ve figured that out, work as hard as possible to turn your passion into something more.\n\nAny social links you want to plug?\n\nThe big one at the moment that everyone should check out is our Evolution of Fan report. This is the last of our 25th-anniversary celebrations, and we’re delighted to present it to the world."
