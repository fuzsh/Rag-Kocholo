        "text": "In today's busy market, companies compete with customer experience more than their products. The problem is, many fail at understanding what âgood customer experienceâ really means.\n\nA lot of professionals tend to think that to satisfy their customers, they need to razzle-dazzle them. But itâs not like that at all.\n\nWhat the customers really need is smooth, effortless experience.\n\nThe thinking behind the NPS survey is consistent with this aim:\n\nThereâs data to prove this, too. According to Harvard Business Review, a study of more than 75,000 companies revealed that wow-ing customers has much less impact than quick problem-solving and effortless use.\n\nTo find out what your customers want and when they encounter friction, you need to talk to them. The best way to do it is to use customer surveys.\n\nBut thereâs a catch. You donât want the surveys to become yet another friction in customer experience. You need to make them short and sweet but still gather the right data to improve your business.\n\nEnter: the Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveyâthe easiest way to gauge customer loyalty and predict company growth.\n\nIn this article, youâll learn all there is to know about NPS to create the most efficient survey:\n\nWhat's a Net Promoter Score?\n\nWhy do you need an NPSÂ survey for your business?\n\nWhat's a good Net Promoter Score?\n\nHow to collect and read your NPS?\n\nWhat are the NPS questions?\n\nWhat are the NPS best pracitces?\n\nRead on!\n\nWhat Is a Net Promoter Score?\n\nNet Promoter ScoreÂ® (NPS) is a popular CX (customer experience) metric that measures clientsâ sentiment towards the brand based on the answers to one question: âHow likely are you to recommend [company X] to a friend or colleague?â. Itâs typically distributed in a survey form.\n\nFree-to-Use NPS Survey Template\n\nAlthough seemingly simple, NPS is a complex customer experience metric that will help you gauge:\n\nCustomer satisfaction levels\n\nGrowth potential\n\nCustomer experience quality\n\nBrand perception\n\nOrganizational performance\n\nHow to Calculate Net Promoter Score?\n\nTo calculate Net Promoter Score, you need to subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.Â\n\nNPS = % Promoters â % Detractors\n\nItâs important to remember that the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is not expressed as a percentage but as an integer lying between -100 (if every respondent is a detractor) and +100 (if every respondent is a promoter).\n\nFor example, if you have 35% promoters and 20% detractors, the NPS will be +15.\n\nCheck out our free NPSÂ calculator and experiment!\n\nWho Are NPS Promoters?\n\nPromoters are respondents who chose scores of 9 to 10. Theyâre your most loyal customers who are most likely to recommend you to their peers. Promoters leverage your companyâs growthâthey act as brand ambassadors, make recurring purchases, and contribute to word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nWho Are NPS Passives?\n\nPassives are the respondents who chose the scores of 7 to 8. Passives are typically satisfied but uninvolved and easy to be won over by your competition.\n\nWho Are NPS Detractors?\n\nDetractors are respondents giving a 0 â 6 score. Detractors are unsatisfied customers who wonât buy from you again. Theyâre likely to switch to your competition and share their negative opinions, which might drive potential customers away.\n\nWhat Is a Good Net Promoter Score? NPS Benchmarks\n\nThere are no universal NPS benchmarks. Which Net Promoter Score is âgoodâ or âbadâ varies from industry to industry.\n\nAt Survicate, we investigated the average Net Promoter Scores of our customers to create a comprehensive NPSÂ benchmark report. Here's what the benchmarks look like for our client base:\n\nAs you can see, the NPS statistics vary from industry to industry. So to decide what a \"good NPS score\" means for you, you need to stack it against your competitors. Maybe you're lagging behind, maybe you're doing just fine, or maybe you're exceptionally high NPSÂ can become your USPÂ (Unique Selling Proposition)?\n\nAny NPS above 50 is considered extremely good. However, even companies with top NPS scores (approximately 70) still have room for improvement! But no matter where youâre standing, any result greater than 0 is satisfactoryâit means that your customers are more satisfied than dissatisfied.\n\nWhy Net Promoter Score (NPS) Works\n\nFirstly, itâs because of the ways our brains are wired. NPS puts the customer in the center of the survey. Notice itâs âHow likely are you to recommend [company X] to a friend or colleague?â and not: âHow well did [company X] do its job?â\n\nPeople spend approximately 30% â 40% of their conversations talking about themselves, and according to Harvard University research, they get a âbiochemical buzz from self-disclosure.â\n\nSecondly, NPS is so powerful because itâs simple. The shorter the survey, the more actionableâbecause the results are easy to interpret, and people are more eager to participate. Long surveys tend to yield low response rates and volatile results.\n\nWhat is more, NPS introduces a data-driven approach to qualitative customer feedback. Itâs consumer-centric and organized, so it allows you to see the full picture and take action easily.\n\nWhy Is Net Promoter Score Important?\n\nNet Promoter Score is important because it helps you discover the strength of your brand and predict your growth rate. High NPS is a sign that your customers are loyal and likely to recommend your company. And word of mouth is an invaluable form of marketing.\n\nNPS has a very positive effort-to-gain ratio: although âthe ultimate questionâ feels easy to respondents and requires very little time, the results allow you to drive complex conclusions and seek room for improvement.\n\nBut measuring NPS alone is not enough to grow your business.Â Thereâs one condition: you need to act upon the insights gathered in the process and remove the guesswork from your business decisions.\n\nAs Nichole Elizabeth DeMerÃ© argues, you should:\n\nâThink of NPS, or Net Promoter Score, like rocket fuel. If you leave it alone, it wonât do much. But when you load it into a responsive, proactive, customer-driven company: blast off.â\n\nIf you do so, NPS can have many benefits both for the company and the respondent:\n\nThe system is intuitive and straightforward to implement, even for non-technical staff.\n\nItâs easy to comprehend and share across teams and departments. It also doesnât need to be explained to respondents.\n\nItâs an operating management toolâbecause the results are so actionable, it reflects the strengths and weaknesses of any team faster than other KPIs do.\n\nItâs got a high response rate and is time-efficient both for the responder and the surveying party.\n\nItâs comparable over time and easy to benchmark. As long as you keep the survey contents intact (wording, the order of questions, number of questions, etc.), you can compare results with great accuracy.\n\nItâs actionable. Although going through the respondentsâ comments takes a lot of manual work, they are an absolute goldmine of customer insights. Categorize answers given by survey participants (both positive and negative) to detect the strengths and weaknesses of the assessed product or service.\n\nFinally, NPS allows you to identify customers at the risk of churning so you can step in and give them a helping hand.\n\nNPS should be an addition to the performance, acquisition, and monetization KPIs but cannot be treated as their substitute.\n\nHow to Collect Net Promoter Score (NPS) Data\n\nTo measure Net Promoter Score, you first have to set up an NPS survey to gather customer feedback. The easiest way to do it is with the help of NPS software, like Survicate.\n\nSurvicate allows you to run multi-channel NPS surveys. Use it to reach your audience via email, on your website, in your app, or your Intercom messenger. After setting up a free account, you need just a few clicks to start collecting your feedback right away.\n\nSurvicate allows you to run multi-channel and multilingual NPS surveys. You can reach your audience via email, on your website, in your app, or your Intercom messenger. Combined with the various language options, youâll make sure youâre communicating with your audiences in the most convenient way possible.\n\nWith all the responses and data aggregated in the result panel, you will quickly analyze the results and take actionâto reduce churn and drive growth for your business.\n\nYour survey type should depend on your customersâ preferred channels, your business model, and the kind of feedback youâre after.\n\nRelationship vs Transactional NPS SurveysÂ\n\nThere are two approaches to the NPS score:Â transactional and relationship NPSÂ surveys.\n\nRelationship NPS survey concerns your customersâ overall attitude towards your company. Use it to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction and build yearly KPIs based on your NPS benchmarks. Itâs best to run a relationship NPS survey in regular time intervals.\n\nTransactional NPS survey gathers customer feedback right after an interaction with your company. It concerns a specific touchpointâfor example, a chat with customer support or a product purchase. A transactional survey will help you get clear-cut business insights and quickly discover your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nYou also have to choose a distribution channel for your surveyâtypically email or website.\n\nNPS Email Surveys\n\nFree-to-Use NPSÂ Email Survey Template\n\nâEmail surveys use hyperlinks embedded in the email HTML code. A response is counted whenever someone clicks the link to the survey.\n\nYou can send email surveys from regular inboxes or mailing software, with email templates in CRMs like Salesforce, or via marketing automation software like Intercom. Take a look at the top 10 surveys used by Intercom customers for inspiration.\n\nNPSÂ email surveys are helpful when you want to question your customers after theyâve performed a specific activity, i.e., post-purchase survey.\n\nAnswers are recorded in your survey tool database, which takes away the manual work and makes them easy to analyze and compare over time and across different customer segments.\n\nEmail surveys have a high response rate because they require very little time and effort on the respondentâs side. They also donât need any code to run, so theyâre super simple to implement.\n\nThe main drawback is that you need email addresses to get started. If you want to get feedback from a broader audience, run a targeted website survey.\n\nTargeted Website Surveys\n\nWebsite surveys have a larger scale than email surveys because they donât require any client data. You can choose between on-page or pop-up surveys.\n\nThe strength of website surveys lies in targeting. You can show your surveys only to specific customer segments based on their visit frequency, seen pages, or how they reached your site. You can also set up specific triggersâfor example, only show the surveys after the clients make a purchase or when theyâre about to exit your site.\n\nDue to their discreet character, website surveys come with high response rates (up to 58%). You can also customize their looks and position (left, right, bottom, top, or in the center of the screen).\n\nHow to Read Your NPS score? NPS Analysis\n\nNPS Score is an indicator of your future growth or decline. Simply put, if your score is rising, youâre in the clear. If itâs droppingâyou have some work to do.\n\nBut getting just the numerical score out of your NPS surveys is a waste of your resources and customer engagement.Â\n\nHere are four ideas on how to read and analyze your NPS survey results.\n\n1. Check Out the Response Breakdown\n\nNPS is all about the score you get by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.\n\nBut you can get valuable insights from the individual survey score distribution. Just think about it: a detractor that chose â1â will be much different from the one that went with â6.â\n\nCreate a breakdown of how many times your respondents picked each score. If you use Survicate, you will see it automatically in the âResultsâ section.\n\nHere are a few things you should pay attention to:\n\nIs your audience polarized, like in the picture above? Or do you have a lot of lukewarm users? This will help you decide if you need to focus on putting down fires, or activating the undecided.\n\nWhat does the detractor breakdown look like? Are the answers split evenly between each score, or does your audience gravitate towards 1 or 6? Maybe itâs easier than you thought to turn your detractors into promoters, or at least passives?\n\nScored a lot of ones? Try to act on the negative feedback and re-think your product-market fit.\n\nDo you have a lot of enthusiastic customers who chose nine? If the answer is âyes,â focus on activating them.\n\nDo you have a lot of passive customers? Devote your efforts to turning them into promoters.\n\nThese insights will help you find and prioritize growth opportunities.\n\n2.Â Look for Patterns in Open-Ended Question Responses\n\nEvery NPS survey should include open-ended questions that ask your clients to explain their choice and maybe leave a suggestion.Â\n\nRespond to the survey below to see how the open-ended question adds to the numerical NPS question:\n\nItâs unlikely youâll bring every suggestion to life, but you should look for repetitive requests or complaints. If you notice a pattern, itâs time to act! Try to add the feature your clients ask for or fix the elements that frustrate them.\n\n3. Monitor the Responses Based on Customer SegmentsÂ\n\nIf youâre not doing customer segmentation yet, you should start now. By categorizing your clients into different groups, youâll be able to gather even more accurate insights and run targeted campaigns.\n\nTrack the answer distribution across different customer segments and look for patterns. For example, if you measure NPS for B2B SaaS industry, you might discover that your biggest promoters are high-level marketers, while tech leaders dominate your detractors. You can then investigate the reasons behind their opinions to understand your customers better and improve your product.\n\nTo find out which segment the respondent belongs to, ask additional demographic questions in your survey.\n\nFree-to-Use Demographic Survey Template\n\nAnd if you use Survicate, integrate with your CRM to get instant client data.\n\n4. Track Results Over TimeÂ\n\nMonitor how your NPS score changes over time to keep an eye on your customer experience program and better predict your growth.\n\nComparing responses over time will help you find your benchmarks and discover fluctuations. Once you gather a lot of data, youâll be able to investigate the reasons for your gains and losses and take action.\n\nIt's also a good idea to supplement your NPS results with CSAT and CES survey data.\n\nNet Promoter Score Questions\n\nNPS allows you to see your company through the customersâ eyes without the complexity of traditional surveys. Instead of going through lengthy questionnaires, customers are asked âthe ultimate questionâ:\n\n\"How likely is it that you would recommend [company X] to a friend or colleague?\"\n\nWhy this particular question? In 2003, Frederick F. Reichheld introduced the concept of NPS in his article, \"The One Number You Need to Grow.\"\n\nFollowing two years of research, Reichheld found out that the likelihood to recommend the company to your network correlated directly with differences in growth rates among competitors in comparison to other questions he examined in the course of his study.\n\nBut donât underestimate the power of open-ended questions. As former Director of Product at LinkedIn, Sachin Rekhi rightly argues:\n\nâThe most actionable part of the NPS survey is the categorization of the open-ended verbatim comments from promoters & detractors.âÂ\n\nWhenever you run an NPS survey, ask a follow-up question based on the respondentâs initial answer. You can:\n\nAsk the promoters what they enjoy the most about your product;\n\nAsk the detractors whatâs the leading cause of their dissatisfaction;\n\nAsk all respondents to tell you what theyâd add to your product if they could.\n\nSuch categorization is easy thanks to skip logic.\n\nIt enables you to create different paths for the respondents by skipping questions and segmenting users based on previous answers.\n\nSkip logic allows you to ask the smallest number of highly relevant questions and create a personalized experience.\n\nYou can ask different follow-up questions to all three respondent groups (promoters, detractors, passives) based on their previous answers.\n\nSkip logic lets you create a personalized experience for each respondent, shorten your survey, and collect only relevant answers. Youâll categorize the responses better and get more precise insights to act on immediately.\n\nSkip logic is just a subset of Survicate's broad survey logic that applies to all question types in your email, link, website, and in-product surveys, being the most advanced survey logic out there.\n\nð¡ YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: NPS with follow up questions survey template\n\nNet Promoter Score Best Practices\n\nDo you want to get the most out of measuring the Net Promoter Score? Here are a few NPS survey best practices.\n\n1. Turn Feedback Into Action\n\nTo grow your company, measuring NPS is not enough. You have to take action based on your findings.\n\nObserve NPS score fluctuations and act whenever you see big drops. Categorize positive and negative feedback to discover underlying issues.\n\nMake sure to close the feedback loop with your customers. Always let your customers know that you listen to them and act on their suggestions. This is the only way to create a customer-centric company and boost customer experience.\n\n2. Leverage Your Promoters\n\nMany companies tend to focus on the detractors and devote all their energy to fixing their shortcomings. Thatâs a mistake. Your promoters have explicitly told you that theyâre likely to recommend your companyâso why not try and make it happen? Depending on the nature of your business, ask your promoters to leave a review or testimonial, open a referral program, etc.\n\n3. Measure Continuously\n\nYou can only trust your NPS score if you never stop measuring. Youâll get in-the-moment insights, track unexplained variations, and see how your customers feel about the changes you make. Make sure to re-run the NPS survey in regular intervals (once or twice a year - or more often if you have a huge customer base) and stack the numbers against each other.\n\n4. Report and Analyze to Create Benchmarks\n\nDonât forget to report your results in an easily digestible way. Clear data breakdown will let you turn feedback into action. Youâll create benchmarks, see your results across customer segments, and prepare NPS-centric KPIs.\n\nItâs easy to do with the help of the right NPS toolâlike Surivcate and its Insights Hub.\n\n5. Run NPS Surveys at the Right Time and Place\n\nDonât attack your customers with questions at random moments. Make sure your NPS surveys are integrated with the customer journey.\n\nShow the survey after meaningful interactions with your company and choose clients that have already had a chance to experience your service. Think about it this way: if you buy a T-shirt in an online store, you donât recommend it to anyone before you try it on, right?\n\nTargeted website surveys and web app surveys, or automated email flows will help you catch your respondents at the right time.\n\nRemember to keep your surveys short, sweet, and not too frequent to avoid survey fatigue.\n\n6. Solve the Most Common Problems Pointed Out by Detractors\n\nNegative feedback means your client encountered friction with your service. It might happen in a product, on a website, or while talking with your customer service.\n\nAssign each piece of negative feedback to the right stage of the customer journey and purchase path. If you run a transactional NPS survey, check which experience scores the worst on average. Youâll quickly discover your weakest points and will be able to fix them.\n\n7. React to Feedback in Real-Time\n\nDonât ignore your detractorsâ negative feedback. Try to compensate your clients for their bad experiences as soon as possibleâyou might avoid negative online reviews and word-of-mouth.\n\nSurvicate will make it easy for you with notifications and alerts - on Slack, for example.\n\nWhenever a low score appears, your customer support team will be able to react right away.\n\n8. Use Skip Logic to Ask Relevant Questions Only\n\nYour surveys need to be as clear, short, and effortless to submit as possible.Â\n\nWith survey logic, youâll have complete control over which questions your respondents see. For example, thereâs no point in asking a detractor who chose âoneâ about their favorite part of your product.\n\n9. Stay Consistent and Donât Make Many Changes at Once\n\nTesting and tweaking your NPS survey will help you adjust it to your customersâ needs and maximize the response rate.\n\nBut donât introduce too many changes at once! Go with one change at a time. Itâs the only way to make sure your results will be comparable over time.\n\n10. Introduce NPS as a Company-Wide KPI\n\nNPS concerns every interaction your customers have with your company and reflects the overall health of your customer relationships. This is why it should matter to every department.\n\nHereâs what you can do to share the NPS results across teams:\n\nMake it a core business metric. Use it as a growth signal and a motivator for your teams.\n\nShare relevant feedback with relevant teams. For example, if someone pointed out that they had a bad experience with your customer service, they should know and improve. Thatâs the only way to close the feedback loop. If you use both Slack and Survicate, consider setting up an open NPS channel.\n\nGive all the teams access to the NPS results. Theyâll be able to find feedback that matters to them without waiting for a monthly marketing report. Itâs easy to do with Survicate, which offers free unlimited users on each account.\n\nSummary\n\nNet Promoter ScoreÂ® (NPS) is a metric that measures customer satisfaction based on the answers to the following question: âHow likely are you to recommend [company X] to a friend or colleague?â.\n\nThe score is presented on a scale from -100 and +100.Â To calculate NPS, you need to subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.Â\n\nNPS is a company growth indicator. It helps predict how many customers will stay loyal to your brand and spread good word-of-mouth. And the more referrals and recurring customers you have, the better your bottom line.\n\nAlways add open-ended questions to your NPS surveys. Ask your clients to explain their decision: what they liked, what they disliked, and what you could improve to really wow them. Addressing customer feedback will help you continue satisfying your audience over time.Â\n\nRemember to measure NPS regularly and continuously. It will help you prepare benchmarks, set up NPS-related goals, and take action to improve customer satisfaction. Without accurate survey data analysis, youâre shooting blanks.\n\nThe best way to measure NPS is with the help of the right survey tool, like Survicate. It will help you:\n\nquickly set up recurring, automatically triggered surveys (based on a ready-to-grab NPS survey template),\n\ngather and sum up your data,\n\nshare all responses with your co-workers."
