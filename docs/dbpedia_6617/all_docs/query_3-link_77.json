        "text": "Microsoft Secure Score\n\nMicrosoft Secure Score is a measurement of an organization's security posture, with a higher number indicating more recommended actions taken. It can be found at Microsoft Secure Score in the Microsoft Defender portal.\n\nFollowing the Secure Score recommendations can protect your organization from threats. From a centralized dashboard in the Microsoft Defender portal, organizations can monitor and work on the security of their Microsoft 365 identities, apps, and devices.\n\nSecure Score helps organizations:\n\nReport on the current state of the organization's security posture.\n\nImprove their security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.\n\nCompare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nWatch this video for a quick overview of Secure score.\n\nOrganizations gain access to robust visualizations of metrics and trends, integration with other Microsoft products, score comparison with similar organizations, and much more. The score can also reflect when non-Microsoft solutions addressed recommended actions.\n\nHow it works\n\nYou get points for the following actions:\n\nConfiguring recommended security features\n\nDoing security-related tasks\n\nAddressing the recommended action with a non-Microsoft application or software, or an alternate mitigation\n\nSome recommended actions only give points when fully completed. Some actions result in partial points if tasks are completed for some devices or users. If you can't or don't want to enact one of the recommended actions, you can choose to accept the risk or remaining risk.\n\nIf you have a license for one of the supported Microsoft products, then you see recommendations for those products. We show you the full set of possible recommendations for a product, regardless of license edition, subscription, or plan. This way, you can understand security best practices and improve your score. Your absolute security posture, represented by Secure Score, stays the same no matter what licenses your organization owns for a specific product. Keep in mind that security should be balanced with usability, and not every recommendation can work for your environment.\n\nYour score is updated in real time to reflect the information presented in the visualizations and recommended action pages. Secure Score also syncs daily to receive system data about your achieved points for each action.\n\nNote\n\nFor Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Entra related recommendations, the recommendation state will get updated when changes occur in the configuration state. In addition, the recommendation state is refreshed once a month or once a week, respectively.\n\nKey scenarios\n\nCheck your current score\n\nCompare your score to organizations like yours\n\nView recommended actions and decide an action plan\n\nInitiate work flows to investigate or implement\n\nHow recommended actions are scored\n\nEach recommended action is worth 10 points or less, and most are scored in a binary fashion. If you implement the recommended action, like create a new policy or turn on a specific setting, you get 100% of the points. For other recommended actions, points are given as a percentage of the total configuration.\n\nFor example, a recommended action states you get 10 points by protecting all your users with multifactor authentication. You only have 50 of 100 total users protected, so you'd get a partial score of five points (50 protected / 100 total * 10 max pts = 5 pts).\n\nProducts included in Secure Score\n\nCurrently there are recommendations for the following products:\n\nApp governance\n\nMicrosoft Entra ID\n\nCitrix ShareFile\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Identity\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office\n\nDocusign\n\nExchange Online\n\nGitHub\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps\n\nMicrosoft Purview Information Protection\n\nMicrosoft Teams\n\nOkta\n\nSalesforce\n\nServiceNow\n\nSharePoint Online\n\nZoom\n\nRecommendations for other security products are coming soon. The recommendations don't cover all the attack surfaces associated with each product, but they're a good baseline. You can also mark the recommended actions as covered by a non-Microsoft solution or alternate mitigation.\n\nSecurity defaults\n\nMicrosoft Secure Score includes updated recommended actions to support [security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults to make it easier to help protect your organization with preconfigured security settings for common attacks.\n\nIf you turn on security defaults, you are awarded full points for the following recommended actions:\n\nEnsure all users can complete multifactor authentication for secure access (nine points)\n\nRequire MFA for administrative roles (10 points)\n\nEnable policy to block legacy authentication (seven points)\n\nSecure Score permissions\n\nImportant\n\nMicrosoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.\n\nManage permissions with Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control(RBAC)\n\nWith Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control(RBAC), you can create custom roles with specific permissions for Secure Score. Defender XDR Unified RBAC allows you to control which users have access to Secure Score data, the products for which they see Secure Score data (for example, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) and their permission level to the data.\n\nYou can also manage user permissions to access Secure Score data from additional data sources, such as the other products supported by Secure Score, for more information, see Products included in Secure Score. You can view the Secure Score data from the other data sources either alone or alongside the other data sources.\n\nTo start using Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC to manage your Secure Score permissions, see Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control(RBAC).\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, the model is only supported in the Microsoft Defender portal. If you want to use GraphAPI (for example, for internal dashboards or Defender for Identity Secure Score) you should continue to use Microsoft Entra roles. Support GraphAPI is planned at a later date.\n\nMicrosoft Entra global roles permissions\n\nMicrosoft Entra global roles (for example, Global Administrator) can still be used to access Secure Score. Users who have the supported Microsoft Entra global roles, but aren't assigned to a custom role in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC continue to have access to view (and manage where permitted) Secure Score data as outlined:\n\nThe following roles have read and write access and can make changes, directly interact with Secure Score, and can assign read-only access to other users:\n\nGlobal Administrator\n\nSecurity Administrator\n\nExchange Administrator\n\nSharePoint Administrator\n\nThe following roles have read-only access and aren't able to edit status or notes for a recommended action, edit score zones, or edit custom comparisons:\n\nHelpdesk Administrator\n\nUser Administrator\n\nService Support Administrator\n\nSecurity Reader\n\nSecurity Operator\n\nGlobal Reader\n\nNote\n\nIf you want to follow the principle of least privilege access (where you only give users and groups the permissions, they need to do their job), Microsoft recommends that you remove any existing elevated Microsoft Entra global roles for users and/or security groups assigned a custom role with Secure Score permissions. This will ensure that the custom Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC roles will take effect.\n\nRisk awareness\n\nMicrosoft Secure Score is a numerical summary of your security posture based on system configurations, user behavior, and other security-related measurements. It isn't an absolute measurement of how likely your system or data could be breached. Rather, it represents the extent to which you are using security controls in your Microsoft environment that can help offset the risk of being breached. No online service is immune from security breaches, and secure score shouldn't be interpreted as a guarantee against security breach in any manner.\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\nIf you have any issues, let us know by posting in the Security, Privacy & Compliance community.\n\nRelated resources"
