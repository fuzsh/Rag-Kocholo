        "text": "What Is NPS?\n\nThe Net Promoter Score is an index that essentially measures customer loyalty to a product, service, or company. Typically, this number is obtained through a survey that is sent to customers after interaction with a brand. The NPS is easy to gauge, since it is based off of a single question:\n\n“On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our product/service/company to a friend or colleague?”\n\nBased on the number that is given, the customer is then placed into one of the three categories: Promoter, Passive, or Detractor. These categories describe how the customer feels about the product or service, their loyalty to the company, and whether or not they would recommend it. The categories are explained in further detail below.\n\nAfter gaining a response from the customer, it is common to then follow up with an open-ended question to gain more insight:\n\n“What is the primary reason for your score?”\n\nThe creators claim that a company’s Net Promoter Score correlates with revenue growth – companies with high NPS scores tend to grow at more than twice the rate of their competitors.\n\nCalculating NPS\n\nCalculating the NPS is a very simple process. Based on the number that a respondent gives, they are placed into one of the following 3 categories:\n\nPromoters: these are the people who have responded with a 9-10 score. They are very positive towards your product or service, and are very likely to recommend your brand to potential customers.\n\nPassives: these are the people who have responded with a 7-8 score. These customers do not spread negative word of mouth, however, are not very likely to spread positive word of mouth either. The Passives are not included in your overall NPS score because their responses have a net neutral effect.\n\nDetractors: these are the people who have responded with a 0-6 score. They are unhappy with your service, and are likely to damage your brand reputation with negative publicity.\n\nCalculating your company’s overall NPS can be done by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters:\n\n(% of Promoters) – (% of Detractors)\n\nThe Link between NPS and a Company’s Financial Success\n\nToday, markets are becoming more competitive than ever, and customer expectations are at a high. With this in mind, Gerard Kliesterlee, CEO of Royal Philips Electronics, realised he needed to change the culture of his product driven organisation. With help from the chief marketing officer, Geert van Kuyck, he searched for an approach to implement this change that aligned with the company’s strategic philosophy of “sense and simplicity”. After researching approaches taken by various major firms around the world, he landed on NPS. They chose to take this approach because NPS ties directly to revenue growth, and drives action by providing feedback that is specific and immediate.\n\nAfter some investigating, van Kuyck found that there was a strong connection between Philip’s NPS score, compared to their biggest competitor, and their rate of growth relative to competitors in the market. They learned that leading the competition on NPS mattered more than obtaining a specific score. After doing some additional digging, the local research teams found that relative NPS explained 90% of the changes in the market share between Philips and its key competitor. Corporations around the world have done similar analysis and the trends they found were very much similar.\n\nNPS explained roughly 20% to 60% of the variation in organic growth rates among competitors.

The founder of the company, Charles “Chuck” Schwab, had retired the previous year, but was asked desperately to take the reins once again. When he returned to the firm, he found that things were out of control. Not only had the stock price dropped from $40 to $6 in a three year period, but about a quarter of their revenue was coming from overcharging their customers. They had completely lost their way and were treating their clients poorly.\n\nAt first, they focused on cutting costs to get back on track. But by the fall of 2005, they realised they needed to start focusing on their core clients again and mending those relationships. The leadership team decided to start implementing the Net Promoter framework. Senior Executives spread the idea around the firm, and began to test out survey techniques. When the time was right, they launched the survey and called it the “Client Promoter Score”. This marked the beginning of a huge turnaround.\n\nBy 2008, the firm was back on its feet and they had regained their position as a leader in the industry. Their Client Promoter Score rose from -35 percent to 35 percent and their stock had tripled. Some of their major changes included: aggressively reducing prices, eliminating their nuisance fees, increasing their resources for the client-facing staff, and focusing on closing the loop.\n\nWhen interviewed by a news reporter, Schwab explained, “I don’t care what kind of business you’re in. Clients referring us to their friends or relatives is so much more powerful than any advertising we could ever do.”\n\n64% of marketing executives indicated that Word of Mouth is the most effective form of marketing.

The first survey should generally be sent within the first 7-30 days after a customer has interacted with your company. After that, the second survey (or any survey after that) should be sent between 90-180 days after the initial survey. Typically, if your company continues to update its products, it is best to send out surveys more often to get additional feedback. If your company does not regularly update its products, it is not needed as often.\n\nWays to Check Your NPS\n\nWhat is a good NPS? A few questions to consider…\n\nIs your score better than your competitors?\n\nIf yes, you have a good score within your industry.\n\nIs it growing?\n\nAn NPS score that is better than your previous score is considered a good score.\n\nDo you keep it above 0?\n\nEven if your negative score is better than a competitors score, generally, a good score is above 0.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that by itself, a Net Promoter Score is quite meaningless. Rather than looking at it as a quantifiable metric to continue to increase, an NPS should be looked as a qualitative metric to analyse and react to.\n\nTip: Ask your survey provider whether they have benchmark NPS data to help you compare your results against others in your region or industry.\n\nWays to Improve Your Score\n\nReach out to Detractors with a personal contact. Sending the Detractors a personal email asking them about what went wrong is a great way to re-engage with them. It is important to make connections with them to show that your care and also helps to prevent future unwanted circumstances.\n\nSome example follow up questions include:\n\nWhat is one thing that we should change to make things better for you?\n\nWhat most dislike about our product or service?\n\nEngage with Passives before they leave. Reaching out to Passives is important because you can gain insight on how to close the gap and turn them into Promoters of your product or service. Because Passives typically do not provide open-ended feedback, you may want to consider offering an incentive or holding an online competition to close the feedback loop.\n\nAn example follow up question includes:\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback. What is one thing that we could do to make you more likely to recommend us?\n\nExpress gratitude to your Promoters. You cannot take this customer segment for granted. Reach out to them with gratitude for their loyalty to your product, service or company. Make it known to them that you appreciate their business. A few ways to close the feedback loop with the Promoters is to offer them free merchandise, perks for referring people, or discounts on upgrades.\n\nAn example follow up question includes:\n\nThank you for your feedback! We are so glad you enjoy our product. If you were recommending this product to a friend, what reason would you give them to test it out?\n\nContact your non-respondents. Typically, non-respondents are the largest customer segment a company will have, and often times, this segment is overlooked. It is crucial to try to re-engage with these customers and gain more insights from them. The best way to reach out to the non-respondents is through a live conversation or a short personal email."
