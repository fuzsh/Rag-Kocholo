        "text": "What Is a Business Credit Score?\n\nA business credit score, also called a commercial credit score, is a number that indicates whether a company is a good candidate to receive a loan or become a business customer. Credit scoring firms calculate business credit scores based on a variety of factors, including credit history, size and age, and legal woes.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nA company's business credit score is a number that reveals whether it is a good candidate for loans or to be a business customer. It is calculated by three business credit scoring firms.\n\nBusiness credit scores range from 0 to 100 and are based on credit information (bill paying habits and more); public records of liens, bankruptcies, and the like; and demographic information about a company.\n\nIt's possible to improve your business credit score by paying company bills on time, maintaining a healthy credit utilization ratio, and working with entities that report trades and payments to the credit bureaus.\n\nNegative information can remain on your business credit report and affect your score for anywhere from three years, for example, for negative trade data, to nine years and nine months for a bankruptcy.\n\nHow a Business Credit Score Works\n\nIf a company wants to take out a loan to purchase equipment, one factor the lender considers is the business’ credit score. The lender also looks at the business’ revenue, profits, assets and liabilities, and the collateral value of the equipment the company plans to purchase with the loan proceeds. In the case of a small business, the lender might check both the business’ and owner’s credit scores, since the personal and business finances of small business owners are often closely intertwined.\n\nThe three major business credit scoring firms are Equifax, Experian, and Dun & Bradstreet, and each uses a slightly different scoring method. Unlike consumer credit scores that follow a standard scoring algorithm and range from 300 to 850, business credit scores range from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the lower the risk. Experian calls scores above 75 “excellent.” Generally, a business will be seen to have good credit if it pays its bills on time, stays out of legal trouble, and doesn’t incur too much debt.\n\nHow a Business Credit Score Is Calculated\n\nExperian lists three main areas of interest in the calculation of business credit scores.\n\nCredit: This is a company’s credit obligation information derived from its suppliers and lenders. It includes a business’ number of trade experiences, unpaid balances, repayment history, credit utilization ratio, and trends over time.\n\nPublic records: This is compiled from legal filings in local, county, and state courts and includes any liens, bankruptcies, or judgments, with information on how recent they are, how often they have occurred, and their dollar amounts.\n\nDemographic information: This refers to a company’s background information, including its size, years on file, and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, which is assigned by the U.S. government. The data comes from many sources, including state filing offices, public records, credit card companies, collection agencies, corporate financial information, and marketing databases.\n\nAll of the above information is used in combination with other data, including “actual trade payment experiences submitted by payees, [other] public record information, collections information, and company background and comparative data that places a company’s payment performance in context within its industry,” according to Experian. Ultimately, your score is arrived at using “a statistically derived algorithm [that is] designed to determine risk.”\n\nHow to Use a Business Credit Score\n\nWhat if Company A is considering taking on Company B as a client and wants to know the likelihood that Company B will pay its invoices in full and on time? No business wants to do hours and hours of work for a client only to receive no payment. Company A can check Company B’s business credit score first, then agree to do business only if Company B’s credit score shows that it has a strong history of paying its suppliers. Company A can even purchase a subscription service to monitor Company B’s credit score on an ongoing basis. If the score drops significantly, Company A can lower its risk by discontinuing its business with Company B or requiring payment in advance.\n\nSimilarly, Company C, a wholesale supplier, might want to check the business credit score of Company D, a manufacturer, before shipping out a truckload of goods with an invoice granting Company D 30 days to pay. If Company D has a high credit score, this arrangement would seem to have low risk, but if it has a low credit score, Company C may want to ask for payment up front before shipping any goods.\n\nHow to Improve Your Business Credit Score\n\nThere is no guaranteed method of improving your business credit score, but there are certain practices you can follow that are likely to bolster it.\n\nCheck your business credit report regularly: It’s important that the information in your report be true and timely.\n\nPay your bills on time: Your payment history is a vital part of calculating your score.\n\nMaintain a healthy credit utilization ratio: This is the amount of your total credit that you are using expressed as a percentage. Anything above 30% is too high; 20% is probably a better goal.\n\nDo business with entities that report trades and payments to credit bureaus: Not all business creditors or vendors report their trade information or payments. Make it a point to try to work with those that do.\n\nHow Long Does Negative Data Stay on My Business Credit Report?\n\nAs long as negative data remains on your business credit report, your credit score will be affected by it. Experian says that it “uses standard industry and government guidelines for keeping data on file,\" and lists these guidelines as:"
