        "text": "There are many ways to measure how customers feel about your product or service, and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) is one of the most popular methods.\n\nIn this article, we’ll define what CSAT is, why it’s important, and how to measure it. We’ll also look at the relationship between CSAT scores and customer expectations.\n\nWhat is the definition of CSAT?\n\nLet’s start by looking at the CSAT score definition. CSAT stands for Customer Satisfaction and it is one of the core customer service metrics businesses use to measure how customers feel about the product and service.\n\nCustomer service teams use CSAT surveys to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from customers about how satisfied they are.\n\nThis data can then be used to make improvements to both customer service workflows and the product or service a business provides.\n\nKey factors that impact CSAT scores\n\nThere are a few key factors that can impact how your customers respond to CSAT surveys.\n\nThe quality of your product or service\n\nCustomer support responsiveness\n\nCustomer support experience overall\n\nEase of use\n\nTimeliness of delivery or service\n\nValue vs. cost\n\nWhy is measuring customer satisfaction important?\n\nCSAT helps you understand how your customers are feeling about your business. These insights give you powerful data to understand what’s working well and what needs to be improved.\n\nA lot of businesses fall into the trap of assuming they know how customers feel. This assumption can be costly, as you miss out on improving systems, processes, service experiences, and products. If your customers aren’t happy, you want to know, and this is where CSAT shines.\n\nUnhappy customers are more likely to leave and use a competitor. On the other hand, satisfied customers are more likely to stick around and be a champion for your business.\n\nCSAT scores ultimately help you identify opportunities for improving customer retention and growth. Simply put, the happier customers are, the more they will spend and the longer they will remain a customer.\n\nCustomer satisfaction scores also promote a culture of continuous improvement, and this can result in happier employees. Happier employees are then more engaged and motivated to provide better service.\n\nSo happier employees make happy customers, and happy customers make happy employees. This cycle is extremely powerful in building a strong business that customers want to work with.\n\nAs you can see, the benefits of measuring customer satisfaction are broad. Similar (although different) to Net Promoter Score (NPS), CSAT gives businesses a high-level view of customer sentiment.\n\nWhat is a CSAT score?\n\nA CSAT score is typically collected through a survey or feedback form of some sort after or during a customer support interaction. It usually has a 5-point rating system, with the option to leave comments or additional feedback.\n\nExplanation of CSAT score\n\nMost CSAT scores are calculated using a 5-point scale, however, a 10-point scale is also common. The scale might be tied to verbiage such as “very satisfied,” “satisfied,” “neutral,” “dissatisfied,” “very dissatisfied,” and so on.\n\nMany businesses also allow customers to leave comments for additional feedback. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data provides a rich view of how customers are feeling.\n\nNow let’s look at the calculation and formula behind measuring customer satisfaction.\n\nHow CSAT is calculated\n\nCustomers are prompted to participate in a very brief set of survey questions asking for their level of satisfaction. This typically happens during an interaction between the customer and the support team, and most often, when that interaction concludes.\n\nA CSAT survey should be short and sweet, giving the customer the option to select a single rating for how they feel, typically using a five-point scale.\n\nAdditionally, customers might have the option to leave comments/additional feedback. On a five-point rating scale, the lowest level of satisfaction is 1, and the highest level of satisfaction is 5.\n\nOnce CSAT scores are collected, they are aggregated and analyzed to determine the overall customer satisfaction score for your customers as a collective.\n\nCSAT is usually shown as a percentage that represents the company’s CSAT score. Calculating CSAT is simple and is done by looking at the number of positive responses out of 100.\n\n(The total number of satisfied responses) ÷ (Number of total rratings) x 100 = % of satisfied customers.\n\nA high CSAT score indicates customer expectations are being met and customers are, for the most part, happy with your product or service.\n\nA low CSAT score is an opportunity to make improvements to the customer experience in hopes of seeing a positive impact on customer loyalty.\n\nA good CSAT score is usually > 90% and ideally, closer to 94%.\n\nThe relationship between CSAT scores and customer expectations\n\nCustomer service is all about meeting (at the very least) customer expectations. However, to stand out from your competitors, you need to exceed expectations whenever possible. That’s not a small feat, as customer expectations are higher than ever today.\n\nMeeting vs. exceeding customer expectations\n\nIf businesses across all industries share one goal, it is to meet customer expectations. Not doing so hurts customer satisfaction which can impact retention and ultimately, your bottom line.\n\nFocusing on meeting and exceeding customer expectations gives you a competitive advantage compared to customers who are less customer-focused. It ensures your customer service team is well-trained and equipped to handle customer questions and problems, and it ensures your product team is focused on doing quality work.\n\nThis improves your relationship with customers and builds a positive reputation around your company which can spread like wild fire and bring you even more customers. Let’s take a look at an example of meeting vs. exceeding a customer’s expectations.\n\nExample of meeting customer expectations\n\nLet’s say you ordered a new French press and it arrives broken. You call the company and ask for a refund or a replacement. They oblige and expedite you a new French press.\n\nIn this example, the company addresses the problem quickly, and the support team handles the issue with care and empathy. The customer’s expectations have been met.\n\nExample of exceeding customer expectations\n\nLet’s take the same scenario. Except for this time, your replacement French press includes a free bag of coffee.\n\nIn this example, the company exceeds expectations by providing a replacement quickly and going the extra mile to send a free bag of coffee. The free bag of coffee isn’t necessary, it’s the cherry on top. It’s a little something extra to say “Sorry for the problem.”.\n\nExceeding expectations, while sometimes costly, can often have a good return on investment by creating a champion out of the customer. These moments create delightful experiences and lasting memories.\n\nUnderstanding changing customer needs\n\nCustomer needs and expectations change over time. Technological advancements and changes in markets and industries can impact what customers expect from businesses.\n\nCSAT surveys can bring light to changing customer needs and help you implement the necessary things in your product or service for improving customer experiences and building customer loyalty.\n\nFor example, without a CSAT survey, you might not realize that your customers now need and expect initial response times to be within 1 hour whereas they were previously satisfied with longer response times.\n\nRecommended: List of the most important customer service skills\n\nHow to collect CSAT scores effectively\n\nMeasuring CSAT isn’t rocket science, it’s actually quite easy to create a survey and get it implemented within your support workflow.\n\n1. Choose the right survey method\n\nFirst, you need to choose the tool you’ll use to create the survey. There are many tools available that help you measure customer satisfaction easily.\n\nTools like Nicereply, AskNicely, SurveyMonkey, and GetFeedback have been popular with support teams for many years. You can also create your own survey using Google Forms or another survey tool.\n\nOnce you’ve decided which tool you will use, you’ll need to determine the rating scale you will use to collect feedback. If you want more granular data, go with a broader (10-point) rating scale. If you want a simple survey with less granular data to analyze, a 3- or 5-point rating scale might be adequate.\n\nMost CSAT surveys give the responder an option to leave additional comments and this qualitative data can often bring in a lot of rich feedback for not just your support team, but your company as a whole.\n\nA quick note on survey bias:\n\nBeware of survey bias when designing and distributing your survey. There are two types of survey bias:\n\nSelection bias: when results are skewed based on who received the survey.\n\nResponse bias: when results are skewed due to how the actual survey is designed or constructed and it encourages a certain type of answer.\n\nSurvey bias can lead to false understandings which can result in poor business decisions and missed opportunities.\n\n2. Determine the right timing\n\nOnce the survey is designed and ready to go, you need to determine where you will distribute the survey. This is often done at the end of the support exchange, as a follow-up the next day, or X hours after the ticket is closed.\n\nThe goal is to get as many responses as possible. The higher the response rate, the more data you’ll get and the richer those insights will be. Of course, this depends on how much support ticket volume your team handles. It’s ok to experiment with distribution methods and times until you find what works for you.\n\nThe Steps To Implementing the CSAT Survey\n\nDefine Objectives:\n\nClearly outline what you aim to achieve with the CSAT campaign (e.g., understanding satisfaction levels after a product launch or a support interaction).\n\nSelect a Survey Tool:\n\nChoose a survey platform or tool that integrates well with your customer service software and offers ease of use for creating and distributing surveys (e.g., Nicereply, SurveyMonkey, GetFeedback).\n\nDesign the Survey:\n\nCreate a brief survey that includes a clear CSAT question, typically measured on a 5-point scale.\n\nInclude an option for open-ended feedback to collect qualitative insights.\n\nEnsure the survey is mobile-friendly and accessible.\n\nIdentify the Target Audience:\n\nDecide on the customer segments to target (e.g., all customers, customers who contacted support in the last month).\n\nPlan the Distribution Strategy:\n\nDetermine the timing and channels for distributing the survey (e.g., immediately after a support interaction, via email, embedded in the support chat interface).\n\nEnsure the timing is appropriate to capture the most accurate reflection of the customer’s experience.\n\nTest the Survey:\n\nConduct a pilot test with a small group of customers or internally to ensure clarity and functionality.\n\nLaunch the Campaign:\n\nRoll out the survey to the selected audience, monitoring distribution and response rates.\n\nMonitor and Collect Responses:\n\nKeep track of the survey responses and completion rates in real-time.\n\nBe prepared to adjust the distribution strategy if needed to improve response rates.\n\nAnalyze the Data:\n\nAggregate the data to calculate the overall CSAT score.\n\nAnalyze qualitative feedback for additional insights.\n\nLook for patterns or trends related to specific aspects of the customer experience.\n\nShare Insights with the Team:\n\nDistribute the findings with relevant teams (product, customer service, etc.) to inform improvements.\n\nUse Tettra or a similar knowledge base to document insights and actions taken for future reference.\n\nAct on Feedback:\n\nPrioritize actions based on the feedback collected.\n\nImplement changes aimed at improving the customer experience.\n\nFollow Up:\n\nIf applicable, follow up with customers who provided feedback to let them know how their input has been used to make improvements.\n\nThis step reinforces the value of their feedback and can enhance customer loyalty.\n\nRepeat Regularly:\n\nCSAT should be measured continuously or at regular intervals to monitor changes over time and ensure ongoing improvement efforts are effective.\n\nChallenges with CSAT surveys\n\nCustomer satisfaction surveys are meant to measure customer happiness with your support team. A support rep might knock it out of the park — they responded quickly and with empathy, and they went above and beyond to solve the customer’s problems.\n\nStill, the CSAT response from that customer might be negative because of dissatisfaction with the product itself, not the support interaction.\n\nIt’s important to consider this when tying CSAT scores to customer support KPIs.\n\nThe support team doesn’t have full control of the CSAT score, it’s a team-wide effort. Yet, many businesses use CSAT scores as a key performance indicator of how well the support team is doing their job.\n\nMeasuring customer experience with customer satisfaction\n\nWhile CSAT is a dedicated type of customer satisfaction survey, it’s not alone.\n\nSurveys like NPS (Net Promoter Score) and CES (Customer Effort Score) are also common ways of measuring your customers’ perception of your experience.\n\nWhatever type of survey you choose to go with, make sure it is well thought-out, and make sure you’re taking action on the data and insights you receive.\n\nFeedback is a gift. Every piece of it is an opportunity for your company and support team to learn and improve, and CSAT is a great place to start learning more about your customers’ needs and expectations to ensure you’re delivering the best product or service possible.\n\nHow To Use Tettra to Store Your CSAT Scores\n\nTettra’s knowledge base can be a powerful tool for storing and leveraging CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores.
