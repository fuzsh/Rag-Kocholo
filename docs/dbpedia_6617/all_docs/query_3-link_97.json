        "text": "Agent Satisfaction Surveys are a type of survey used to understand the level of happiness customer service teams have in the work they do. These surveys are typically conducted once or twice per year to measure how satisfied customer service agents are. The result of the survey is an Agent Satisfaction Score.\n\nAgent Satisfaction Score is calculated from the results of the Agent Satisfaction Survey. Agent Satisfaction Score (ASAT) is generally positively correlated with Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), meaning the higher ASAT is, the higher CSAT will be. On the other hand, the Agent Satisfaction Score is negatively correlated with agent turnover and absenteeism, meaning turnover and absenteeism decrease as ASAT increases.\n\nAgent satisfaction survey explained\n\nAgent satisfaction is a leading indicator that influences many other customer service metrics. The purpose of measuring ASAT is to proactively identify risks such as burnout or lack of engagement, and ensure the team is happy doing the work theyâve been hired to do.Â\n\nAgent satisfaction is important because it directly impacts customer satisfaction and employee turnover. Being the first point of contact for customers, unhappy agents can lead to problematic or underwhelming experiences for customers. When employees are unsatisfied and donât feel valued, they are more likely to start looking for other job opportunities, resulting in an increase in employee turnover.Â\n\nASAT provides an opportunity to stay ahead of these issues. It ensures customers are getting the best service possible and that employees are treated in a way that motivates and inspires them to continue showing up to do their best work.\n\nAgent satisfaction survey questions\n\nAgent satisfaction surveys can be simple or complex. They will look different from company to company depending on the products or services you provide and how your team works.Â\n\nWith that being said, we recommend starting with some of these questions when creating (the first version of) your ASAT survey.Â\n\nWhat is your current role?\n\nHow long have you been working with us?\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how much do you like your coworkers?\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how much do you like your job function?\n\nHow often do you receive feedback from your manager?\n\nHow satisfied are you with the skills youâre learning?\n\nHow much do you think you are contributing to the companyâs success?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your salary?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your job benefits?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your manager?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your growth opportunities?\n\nHow satisfied are you with the company?\n\nHow can we improve your satisfaction at work?Â\n\nHow would you describe your experience at the company?\n\nMeasuring the success of an agent satisfaction survey\n\nThere are more ways to measure satisfaction than a survey, but itâs a great way to collect measurable data efficiently. What you do with the results of an agent satisfaction survey is what matters most. After conducting a survey, follow up by implementing additional training or policies that support improvements in the areas that need it most.\n\nFor example, your support teamsâ ticket resolution time might be low because theyâre not feeling valued or motivated and theyâre frustrated at work. After implementing new policies and processes to improve the agent satisfaction score, you can look back at historical resolution times and compare them to the new resolution times.\n\nIf you see resolution times decrease after implementing the learnings from the ASAT survey, itâs an indication that the survey efforts were a success.\n\nYou might also have an employee turnover issue at your company, where agents are leaving the company faster than ever. Take what you learn from the ASAT survey and implement ways to make your team more satisfied with the work theyâre doing. Maybe itâs burnt out, maybe itâs a lack of technical knowledge or resources. Whatever the case, use data to understand if the changes youâre implementing are working.\n\nTips for conducting a successful agent satisfaction survey\n\nHere are some basic tips for rolling out an agent satisfaction survey.\n\nImplement technology: Use a survey tool that will help you create the surveys, collect the data, and provide visual reports of the responses. Thereâs a ton of tools out there, but even a simple Google Form is a good place to start.\n\nCarefully choose the questions: Take time to figure out what types of questions you want to include in the survey. Make your agents feel valuable when responding to the survey. Make them feel heard by asking them about their managers, satisfaction with benefits and perks, their salary, and how the company can improve overall.\n\nImprove based on the feedback: Once the survey results are in, take time to analyze the responses and review them with your leadership team, as well as your direct reports. Use this information to then implement new things to help move the needles in the right direction once the next survey is conducted. Take into consideration the feedback they provide so that they can feel involved in the improvement process, this way, they will be more eager to engage in future surveys.\n\nThe agent satisfaction survey process\n\nConducting an ASAT survey is a great way to understand how happy your agents are at work. While you can easily ask your agents about their level of satisfaction with their job, youâll get a deeper level of information by conducting an agent satisfaction survey.Â\n\nConducting a survey takes some planning and preparation. Here are some things to consider.Â\n\nSelect whoâs in charge of conducting the survey\n\nDecide who will facilitate this project. It might be a team lead or someone else at the company not directly involved with the customer service team. Or, you might decide to outsource the survey to a research group separate from your companyâit all depends on what kind of resources you have available.\n\nConduct research to create questions\n\nThe best way to ensure engagement on these surveys is to have thoughtful questions. Think of questions that will not only make the agent feel heard and understood but will also help the company guide its efforts to the most common pain points.\n\nSelect a survey creation toolÂ\n\nOnce youâve drafted the survey questions, youâll need to select a survey tool to use. Your company might have a survey tool theyâve purchased already for other surveys. If youâre selecting a new tool, youâll need to evaluate pricing and features to make sure it will work for you and your company. Some of the best survey tools are Google Forms, Survey Monkey, Survey Planet, HubSpot Surveys, Qualaroo, and many more.\n\nCreate the survey\n\nDial in the types of questions you want to ask based on what the customer service team is experiencing. For example, if you suspect thereâs burnout, ask about whether or not the team is feeling overwhelmed with their workload.\n\nTest the survey\n\nEvery survey should be tested before it is applied to the respective audience. Testing the survey on a few mock respondents ensures the survey will be understood correctly and is working properly. Send the survey to a few employees first to get feedback and see if there are any missing questions or opportunities to improve it, or any technical glitches.\n\nChoose the surveyâs frequency\n\nNormally, this survey is conducted once or twice a year, but this will depend on the amount of feedback you want to collect and how often are you willing to improve.Â\n\nSend it to every customer service team member\n\nSend the survey to every team member including agents, team leads, and managers. Gathering this structured feedback from the entire team creates a holistic view of both individuals as well as the team as a whole.\n\nAnalyze the results\n\nOnce the survey is done, take time to analyze the results and conclude how to improve your agentsâ satisfaction based on the survey responses. You might also decide to share the results with your team to promote a transparent culture.\n\nTake action\n\nCreate an action plan for putting things into practice based on the survey results. This might be changes to policies and processes, new training programs, a redesigned agent onboarding process, or other opportunities for support agents.\n\nAnalyzing ASAT survey results\n\nHave a plan for analyzing and reviewing the data collected in the survey. SurveyMonkey, one of the leaders in the survey tool space, recommend this survey analysis method. If youâre using a Google Form, link the responses to a spreadsheet so you can categorize and organize it.Â\n\nFrom there, you can draw results such as if the team is generally satisfied with the work they're doing, save for some outliers, or if the general sentiment is one of disengagement.Â\n\nStart with looking at quantitative data\n\nThis is the easiest information to analyze since most survey tools will provide an instant visual reference of the results, such as a bar chart or pie graph. Qualitative data takes more time to parse through and understand. Starting with hard numbers will give you an instant indicator of some themes and problem areas.\n\nCorrelate the data\n\nCorrelating data is the process of understanding what responses are related to or influencing one another. For example, you might find that the more tickets an agent is handling, the more likely they are to be feeling burned out at work. This will help you make better-informed decisions by correlating your variables with the answers and visualizing patterns.\n\nUse historical data\n\nIf you have any historical data, make sure itâs readily available so you can compare it with the most recent results from the survey. Comparing new data against old data will help you see if there have been any improvements in agent satisfaction since the last survey was sent.\n\nCreate graphs for better visualization\n\nVisual representations of the data like charts and word clouds help you understand the responses. This is a great way to present the data when sharing it with your team. As weâve mentioned above, your survey tool likely has some built-in data visualization tools.\n\nMake conclusions\n\nDrawing conclusions and sharing these with your management and leadership teams will help get everyone on the same page. Make sure your peers understand the results of the survey so they can help support you in the initiatives you take based on the results.\n\nThe importance of happy support agents\n\nKeeping employees happy is critical to the success of any business. Creating a workplace environment and culture where your support agents feel valued, appreciated, and arenât overworked will ultimately save your company money in the long run.\n\nEmployee happiness = more productivity.\n\nUnhappy employees will likely result in a high turnover.\n\nHappy employees will be more likely to become engaged in your company activities.\n\nIncreased creativity from the team since they will be motivated.\n\nLower absenteeism because they will feel valued at your company.\n\nAddressing agent concerns\n\nTo a certain extent, all feedback is valuable and worth taking into account. That said, there is always the potential for throwaway comments that aren't intended to provide any actual feedback. Generally, as long as there is some constructive quality to the feedback and it isn't just a one-line complaint, it's usually worth bearing in mind.Â\n\nâ Actionable feedback: âThis process is slow and clunky, and if we were to improve it, I would get more done\"\n\nð«Not actional feedback: âI don't like working on these cases.\"\n\nTake action on the responses you can, and dig deeper into responses that arenât clear.Â\n\nBenefits and ROI of ASAT\n\nAs the saying goes, âFeedback is a giftâ. Conducting an agent satisfaction survey will give you and your leadership team helpful feedback to make positive changes within the organization that will ultimately impact the bottom line.\n\nIncreased awareness of team health\n\nWhile 1:1s between agents and their managers might reveal insights about agent satisfaction, these meetings arenât always the best way to get this information. Sometimes agents wonât share feedback about burnout or other struggles out of fear of sounding like theyâre âcomplainingâ. By providing an additional opportunity to submit feedback via a survey, you can sometimes get more honest feedback.\n\nHelps improve the agentsâ satisfaction\n\nTaking action on feedback is the best way to improve your team membersâ satisfaction, which ultimately helps to reduce employee turnover.\n\nMakes your agents feel valued\n\nThe best way to make your employees feel good about their work is to reassure them that your company is willing to improve for them. They want to know youâre listening and truly care about them. Results from an ASAT survey might result in offering new benefits, or reducing workload while maintaining the quality of your service.Â\n\nYou can measure your leadership effectiveness\n\nMeasuring agent satisfaction can be used to indirectly measure the effectiveness of your team leads and managers. For example, low satisfaction might be a result of bad leadership and if ASAT continues to slip after each survey, it might be time for upper management to get involved and evaluate the leadership team.\n\nDisadvantages of the ASAT survey\n\nWhile there arenât many disadvantages to conducting an agent satisfaction survey, it can shine a light on some problems that arenât necessarily controlled by you.\n\nRepeated concerns\n\nSome issues might be out of your control. For example, you might depend on a partner or third party for a certain part of your customer service, and maybe that process involves friction or frequent roadblocks. It might even be a legal process of some sort. While this can cause frustration, itâs important to communicate to your team that there simply isnât much you can do, itâs just the nature of the job.\n\nYou need to act quickly\n\nSome things might be in your control, but they might be a large effort (for example, switching service providers or partners). In this case, you should communicate your plans with your team so they know youâre listening to their concerns. You might not be able to act quickly all of the time, but you can certainly communicate the right information quickly. That said, you should take quick action whenever you can.\n\nIs there an ROI for conducting an ASAT survey?\n\nIdeally, teams with an ASAT survey would see higher employee retention and associate satisfaction if the feedback is acted upon. Often, this type of survey uncovers serious grievances that, once identified, are acted on quickly to the delight of the team.Â\n\nThis not only helps control program costs for hiring but can also lead to better use of resources if training for new hires isn't needed as frequently due to folks staying engaged on their team.\n\nUltimately, measuring ASAT helps protect revenue by keeping customers happy. If customers are faced with working with unhappy agents, customer satisfaction takes a hit and revenue is at risk.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgent satisfaction surveys are a powerful tool to help support teams operate healthily. They teach you things you might not get from having conversations with your team, and they enable you to implement change to become a better place to work. Focusing on improving the workplace for support agents will trickle down to your customers by way of providing a higher level of service.\n\nIf youâre not currently measuring ASAT, start with a simple survey and iterate over time as you learn more about what you need to be asking your agents. By having a survey in place, your agents will feel more valued and this alone can have a positive impact on agent satisfaction.\n\nTaking action on these surveys is the most important part of the process. There are often things directly in your control that you can do or change to improve the happiness of agents, all while maintaining a high level of service.Â"
