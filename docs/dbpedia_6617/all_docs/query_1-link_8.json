The firm conducted an online census survey of all SCORE clients, of whom a total of 15,282 clients responded.\n\nSCORE calculated business starts and non-owner jobs created totals using straight line extrapolation from the total number of survey respondents that reported they used a SCORE service. This survey methodology is based on industry accepted procedures at the time of the survey.\n\nAt this time, SCORE is reviewing survey structure and analysis methodology to ensure it is in line with industry accepted standards and thoroughly reflects, captures and effectively communicates SCORE’s impact. This is in order to support future survey and impact analysis activities.

Our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility allows us to reach new communities and provide valuable expertise and educational services to anyone looking to start or grow a business. Overall, SCORE's small business clients are overwhemingly positive about their experience, with 86% stating they would recommend SCORE to family and friends. That's critical, because when entrepreneurs work with a mentor, they are three times more likely to stay in business. In fact, 90% of SCORE's 'in business' clients were still in business at the end of 2022, and 55% of those clients also reported an increase in revenue.\n\nRECOMMEND\n\n0%\n\nof clients would recommend SCORE to family and friends\n\nIn Business\n\n0%\n\nof ‘in business’ clients were still in business at the end of 2022\n\nRevenue\n\n0%\n\nof ‘in business’ clients reported an increase in revenue\n\nSlide 1\n\n\"Without my mentor and SCORE, I would not have been able to get the funding I needed to grow.\"\n\nBAILAN SPICE\n\nLenora Ebule, Owner\n\nSlide 1\n\n“Working with SCORE, our business has grown fivefold.”\n\nFOUR HILLS FARM\n\nJim Mansfield, Owner\n\nSlide 1\n\n\"[SCORE's] help really prepared me for what was to come and made me feel more confident about being a small business owner.\"\n\nACCESS TRAX\n\nKelly Twichel, Owner\n\nSlide 1\n\n“When we got closer to opening, I think [my mentor] was just as excited as I was.”\n\nSWT FITNESS\n\nSandra Vasquez, Owner\n\nSlide 1\n\n\"With their amazing and seemingly endless resources, SCORE helped me apply for and receive the PPP and EIDL grants and loans made available by the massive recovery efforts the government cobbled together almost overnight.\"\n\nPATH TO PUBLISHING\n\nJoylynn M.

SCORE’s LiveChat feature on SCORE.org also means that small business owners can chat live with a SCORE mentor when they have questions or need guidance to access mentoring or resources.\n\nEmpowering Diversity in Entrepreneurship: SCORE for ALL\n\nRecognizing that diverse backgrounds, different voices and unique needs may call for specialized resources or a personalized approach to mentoring, SCORE for ALL offers customized resources and content specific to entrepreneurs facing unique challenges. Developed in 2021 with hubs for women, Black, Hispanic and veteran entrepreneurs, new hubs were added in 2022 to serve Asian American/Pacific Islander and rural entrepreneurs, with more to come.
