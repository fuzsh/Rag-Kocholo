        "text": "Land of Ashes and Diamonds My Apprenticeship in Poland and 26 Letters from Jerzy Grotowski to Eugenio Barba, Eugenio Barba, Black Mountain Press, 1999 London\n\nBarba met Grotowski in the early days in Opole and the Theatre of 13 Rows and was taken by his work. He documents his observations and impressions, what he did and what Grotowski did, what they talked about and how the most powerful theatrical work of the 1960s and early 1970s came to be.\n\nExcerpt: \"As soon as I arrived Grotowski handed me a pamphlet entitled Mozliwosc teatru (The Possibility of Theatre), fresh from the printers and with his name on the cover. One half of it consisted of texts by Grotowski and Flaszen, and the other of extracts by Polish critics about Teatr 13 Rzedow's productions. Flaszen and Grotowski set out the main points of their vision: that the specific characteristic of theatre consists in the live and immediate contact between actor and spectator; for each production a new way of organizing space has to be found, creating a unity and a physical osmosis which mingle actors and spectators, and favor contact; the performance originates from the contact between two ensembles, that of the actors and that of the spectators; the director has to 'direct' both these ensembles, consciously moulding their interaction in order to reach an archetype, and thereby the 'collective subconscious' of the two ensembles; these become aware of the archetype through a dialectic of apotheosis and derision which is applied to the text.\"\n\nExcerpt: \"To do 'poor theatre' you have to be rich. But Grotowski's wealth was not money. It was the creative resources of the ensemble: of the architect Gurawski, of Flaszen,the devil's advocate; of Krygier and Szajna, the creators of costumes which were bewitching emblems; of Grotowski himself who tore the classics to pieces in search of archetypes. And then there were the actors: Rena Mirecka, Zygmunt Molik, Zbigniew Cynkutis, Antoni Jaholkowski and Ryszard Cieslak. Their voices and gestures fill my senses when I visit them in my memory. The performance is something that happened between them and me and the consequences live on, are transmitted, become embodied in new life.\"\n\nWith Grotowski: Theatre is Just a Form, Peter Brook, Edited by: Georges Banu and Grzegorz Ziolkowski with Paul Allain, January 2009 From early on, Grotowski recognised the double nature of forms. They conceal, but they also protect the life that is within. For this reason, he set up his own barriers, so as to conceal and protect the work he was doing with his dedicated companions in their well-guarded private space. When he eliminated spectators from his theatre, and when he refused to allow writers to describe and evaluate his explorations, this was to prevent mere descriptions from replacing the vivid life of actions. And yet Grotowski, a great reader, an encyclopedic man of learning, knew well how essential in human life it is for understanding to be passed on, for there to be a chain of transmission. His quest was not only in a personal need to force the crust of the earth to open so as to reveal the blazing core hidden in its depths. It was also, in his own chosen field of theatre, to guide others, to help them discover in exact, detailed and repeatable ways what laws, what practices make this deep inner penetration possible. In this way, he could develop a craft that could be transmitted directly, from person to person, a craft that examined the relationship between impulse and action, and made their coming together possible. He carefully separated himself from his explorations, so that they could continue one day without himâ€™. (an extract from the book)"
