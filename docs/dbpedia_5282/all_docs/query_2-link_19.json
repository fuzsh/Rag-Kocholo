        "text": "This year’s Pro Football Hall of Fame induction will be led by the usual archetypes: Peyton Manning, the greatest passer of his generation; the standout receiver Calvin Johnson, known as Megatron; and safeties John Lynch and Charles Woodson, two of the best at their jobs in their day.\n\nBut Bill Nunn Jr.’s contributions to the game were and still are more impactful than any of them, though he will never be as famous.\n\nNunn, who died in 2014 at 89, became the first Black scout and front office executive in the N.F.L. when the Pittsburgh Steelers hired him in 1967 to help recruit players from historically Black colleges and universities. Having covered these schools for years as a sportswriter, Nunn helped turn a moribund Steelers franchise into a dynasty in the 1970s, when they won four Super Bowls, and ushered in an era during which players from H.B.C.U.s dominated the N.F.L. draft.\n\nNunn identified some of the greatest untapped football talent in the country — Joe Greene, Donnie Shell, John Stallworth, L.C. Greenwood, Mel Blount and many others — but he was far more than a scout. He ran Steelers training camp, which gave him a close look at rookies and veterans alike. At times, he recommended that players switch positions, like when he signed Shell, an undrafted rookie linebacker from South Carolina State, and converted him into a safety.\n\nHe also had rookies and veterans share rooms during training camp to build team chemistry and helped many Black players like Shell, who came from the South, adjust to life in Pittsburgh. His role as confidant gave the Steelers a big advantage, but was not the norm for executives at the time.\n\n“You know what made me comfortable?” Shell said. “When I got to training camp, I saw another guy who looked like me who wasn’t a football player.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
