        "text": "Films (author or co-author): Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Manhattan Murder Mystery, For the Boys and Intersection (as writer/director): Simon, Lovesick, The Manhattan Project and Sister Mary Explains It All. Television: The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (head writer) and The Dick Cavett Show (head writer/co-producer).\n\nHe has published in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Playboy and other periodicals, and was the 2006 recipient of the Writers Guild of America’s Ian McLellan Hunter Lifetime Achievement Award. Jersey Boys, his first venture into musical theatre (with co-author Rick Elice), won four Tonys, including Best Musical. The Addams Family, his second theatrical venture (also with Rick), ran over 700 performances on Broadway and had national and international tours. Upcoming projects include musicals about Roy Rogers and the Woodstock Festival of 1969.\n\nRICK ELICE (Book) co-wrote Jersey Boys (winner 2006 Tony Award, 2007 Grammy Award and 2009 Olivier Award for Best Musical) with the great Marshall Brickman; The Addams Family; Peter and the Starcatcher (winner of five 2012 Tony Awards); and The Cher Show (currently on tour in the UK).\n\nIn the pipeline: Water for Elephants, adapted from the popular novel; Silver Linings Playbook, adapted from the popular film; The Princess Bride for Disney; Smash for Robert Greenblatt, Neil Meron and Steven Spielberg.\n\nIn London, Rick’s new play, Doubting Tom, and an original musical, Treasure, written with 2021 Ed Kleban Award-winner Benjamin Scheuer, will be produced in 2024-5. Rick’s book, Finding Roger, An Improbably Theatrical Love Story, is published by Kingswell.\n\nHeartfelt thanks to those whose theatre work makes him grateful for the day he was born: Sondheim, Stoppard, Bennett, Prince, Fosse, Robbins, Nichols, Nunn, Laurents, Stone, Taymor, Papp, Schumacher, Schneider, David, Strong, Gaudio, Valli, McAnuff, Trujillo, Timbers, Coyne, Brickman, and, eternally, Roger Rees. Rick thinks about them a lot. He never thought about Jersey much. He does now.\n\nBOB GAUDIO (Composer) wrote his first hit, “Who Wears Short Shorts,” at 15, for the Royal Teens, and then went on to become a founding member of the Four Seasons and the band’s principal songwriter. He also produced the hit “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers” for Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand (Grammy nomination, Record of the Year) as well as seven albums for Diamond, including The Jazz Singer. Other producing credits include albums for Frank Sinatra, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson and the soundtrack for the film of Little Shop of Horrors.\n\nSeveral songs co-written with Bob Crewe have been cover hits for such artists as the Tremeloes (“Silence Is Golden”), the Walker Brothers (“The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore”) and Lauryn Hill (“Can’t Take My Eyes Off You”). Gaudio produced and co-wrote the Who Loves You album for the Four Seasons and one of Billboard’s longest-charted singles (54 weeks),“Oh, What a Night.” A high point in his career came in 1990 when, as a member of the original Four Seasons, Gaudio was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1995, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, which hailed him as “a quintessential music-maker.”\n\nGaudio co-produced the current hit Broadway show A Beautiful Noise, The Neil Diamond Musical, and the Jersey Boys film with Nick Jonas as Frankie Valli. In 2022, Gaudio’s song “Beggin’” recorded by Månesskin, an Italian rock group, was chosen as Favorite Song of the Year by The American Music Awards. Gaudio is currently working on a project relating to Frank Sinatra’s Watertown album. To this day, Bob Gaudio and Frankie Valli still maintain their partnership…on a handshake.\n\n“New York was pregnant in the fifties,” says Bob Crewe, “gestating with possibilities.” Crewe and music partner Frank Slay became independent writer-producers when the category hadn’t yet been invented. In 1957 they wrote and produced “Silhouettes” for The Rays, which skyrocketed to No. 1. Suddenly, producers in demand, they launched Freddie Cannon’s “Tallahassee Lassie” and Billy & Lillie’s “Lah Dee Da.”\n\nCrewe’s 1960s unprecedented producing success with The Four Seasons birthed a new sound, striking a major chord in American pop. “Sherry,” “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Walk Like a Man,” “Candy Girl,” “Ronnie” – all smashes! When lead Frankie Valli demanded a solo turn, Crewe and Bob Gaudio wrote (and Crewe produced) “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” which eventually became the century’s fifth most-played song.\n\nCrewe ran hot with artists from Vicki Carr, Oliver and Lesley Gore to Mitch Ryder, co-writing with Charles Fox the soundtrack for Jane Fonda’s film, “Barbarella.” Then his own Bob Crewe Generation exploded with Music to Watch Girls By. In 1972 Bob was in L.A., where he revived Frankie Valli with “My Eyes Adored You” by Crewe and Kenny Nolan. They also co-wrote Patti LaBelle’s “Lady Marmalade” (No. 1, July 1975), which was a hit again on the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge (No. 1, June 2001)\n\nDES McANUFF (Director) is a two-time Tony Award-winning director and former artistic director of Canada’s Stratford Festival.\n\nHe is also Director Emeritus of La Jolla Playhouse, where as Artistic Director he staged over 30 productions of classics, new plays and musicals.\n\nHe’s co-founder of Broadway’s Dodgers. Broadway: Ain’t Too Proud, Summer, Doctor Zhivago, Jesus Christ Superstar, Guys and Dolls, Aaron Sorkin’s The Farnsworth Invention, Jersey Boys (Tony and Olivier Awards: Best Musical), Billy Crystal’s 700 Sundays (Tony Award: Best Special Theatrical Event), Dracula the Musical, How to Succeed…, The Who’s Tommy (Tony and Olivier Awards: Best Director), A Walk in the Woods, Big River (Tony Awards: Best Director, Best Musical).\n\nSelected New York: Fetch Clay, Make Man (NYTW), multiple productions at The Public and BAM.
