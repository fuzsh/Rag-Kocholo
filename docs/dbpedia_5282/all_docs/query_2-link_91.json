        "text": "William “Willie” Baker ran the longest operating black-owned business in the Homewood-Brushton area, but he represented much more than that. A Southern gentleman who survived the racist Jim Crow era, Mr. Baker served as a substitute parent for some kids in the neighborhood, as well as an iconic figure and widely admired businessman.\n\nHis free deli sandwiches were the only meal some children would eat that day. At Christmas, he would give away the broken and disused bicycles that he’d spent the year collecting and refurbishing.\n\n​\n\nMr. Baker, 79, of Homewood, passed on April 29 2020 of complications from Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nCharles Henry Cooper (September 29, 1926 – February 5, 1984) was an American professional basketball player. He and two others, Nat \"Sweetwater\" Clifton and Earl Lloyd, became the first African-American players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1950.\n\nCooper was also the first African American to be drafted by an NBA team, as the first pick of the second round by the Boston Celtics. Cooper was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2019.\n\nJohn Brewer was bigger than life—that’s probably because he documented the lives of so many other Black Pittsburghers over the years. An author, raconteur, and collector of oral histories.\n\nAs noted in the biography of him the Pittsburgh Black Media Federation wrote, he could recite the history of the Pittsburgh Trolley System from memory. He knew who owned a long-gone meat market on an East End street that is there no longer—and who worked there, and who they married.\n\n​\n\nBrewer passed on February 13, 2018. He was 73.\n\nIn 1927, Dawson opened the Cardwell Dawson School of Music in the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, which remained open until 1941, as well as organized the Cardwell Dawson Choir.\n\nAfter presenting the opera Aida at the National Association of Negro Musicians convention of 1941, Dawson launched her National Negro Opera Company (NNOC) later that same year with a performance at Pittsburgh's Syria Mosque.\n\n​\n\nIn 1961, Dawson was appointed to the National\n\nMusic Committee by President John F. Kennedy.\n\n​\n\nDawson passed in 1962.\n\n​\n\nOn June 15, 1921 Garner was born in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pa. Following behind his older brother Linton, Garner was playing piano by three years old and quickly becoming accomplished at picking up tunes. At six he began taking lessons. Just a year later, Garner began to play regularly on Pittsburgh’s KDKA radio station with a group called The Candy Kids, and by the age of eleven he was playing on Allegheny riverboats.\n\nIn the early 1950’s Garner was one of the country’s most popular entertainers, On January 2, 1977, he passed away at just 55, buried at the Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh, leaving behind a rich legacy of great music that is still enjoyed today.\n\nNaomi Ruth Sims (March 30, 1948 – August 1, 2009) was an American model, businesswoman, and author. She was the first African-American model to appear on the cover of Ladies' Home Journal, which occurred in November 1968, and is widely credited as being the first African-American supermodel.\n\nShe attended Westinghouse High School and began college after winning a scholarship to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. She also appeared on the cover of the October 17, 1969 issue of Life magazine. This made her the first African-American model on the cover of the magazine.\n\nThe images from the 1967 New York Times fashion magazine cover and the 1969 Life magazine cover were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an exhibition entitled The Model as Muse."
