        "text": "Martin Lawrence (born April 16, 1965, Frankfurt am Main, West Germany [now Germany]) is a star who was featured in the hit television sitcom Martin from 1992 to 1997. He parlayed his success on the small screen into an active film career. He is also credited with popularizing the greeting “wassup?”\n\nLawrence was born in West Germany (now Germany), where his father, a U.S. Air Force serviceman, was stationed. The family soon returned to the U.S., settling in Landover, Maryland. After graduating from high school, Lawrence decided to try his luck as a stand-up comic. He also briefly worked at a Sears call center with future hip-hop duos Salt-N-Pepa and Kid ’n Play. He appeared on the television talent show Star Search in 1986, and, although he did not win the competition, the following year he landed a recurring role on the TV series What’s Happening Now!! (1985–88). Lawrence eventually earned small roles in several films, including Do the Right Thing (1989); House Party (1990) and House Party 2 (1991), with his former coworkers Kid ’n Play; and Boomerang (1992). He served as host of the cable television program Def Comedy Jam from 1992 to 1993.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nOn Martin Lawrence played a radio DJ, and he showed his versatility by playing many supporting characters on the show, often in prostheses or drag.
