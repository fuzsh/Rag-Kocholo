        "text": "Actor Bill Nunn, best known for portraying Radio Raheem in the film, Do The Right Thing, has died at the age of 62.\n\nThe news comes via Spike Lee, who directed Nunn in the 1989 film. Though, the cause of death is currently unknown, Lee says Nunn passed away at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania sometime this morning.\n\nLee and Nunn were both graduates of Atlanta's Morehouse College and first collaborated on Lee's 1988 film, School Daze. They went on to work together on \"Mo' Better Blues\" and \"He Got Game.\" Outside of his partnership with Lee, Nunn started in Sister Act alongside Whoopi Goldberg, made an appearance in the Spider-Man trilogy starring Tobey McGuire, played Duh Duh Duh Man in 1991's New Jack City, and starred in the 2014 Broadway revival of A Raisin In The Sun."
