        "text": "By Chloe DiMario\n\nAs The University of Akron’s Spring 2023 semester comes to an end, so too does the “Acting Like A Hower” UnClass. Throughout the stress of finals week, our class has been busy finishing and reflecting upon our projects from this semester. These projects have all taken surprisingly different directions as can be seen in previous blog posts, and the same could be said for the\n\nexperiences each student has had.\n\nFor the final blog post of this course, I wanted to focus on the experience that students have had in an UnClass and how this structure made for one of the most memorable classes we have all taken. So I took a survey of my classmates.\n\nQ1: Why did you decide to take this class?\n\nThere are many factors that determine who someone would take a class. In many cases, you will have peers of similar interests, backgrounds or majors in your class roster. However, we found that this UnClass was very different. Whether it be a curriculum requirement, a favorite professor teaching it, or a fun class that happens to fit into your schedule, this UnClass has gathered many different students.\n\nMat said that “I took this class with encouragement from Dr. Nunn. I had her for two courses in the fall where I mentioned having a love of acting and theater, and she thought I would find this course interesting- and she was right!” Mat and I have shared a course with Dr. Nunn before and hearing that one of your favorite professors is teaching such a unique style is a guarantee win for students. In fact, the class had a few other students that knew Dr. Nunn prior, but what about everyone else?\n\nSome needed this class as a specific credit such as for Honors Colloquia Credit. CJ offered that, “I decided to take this due to an interest in the Hower family and it was recommended by Linda [Bussey].” CJ has already worked with Hower House and its director, and having that background made for an interesting transition into our class. Many students had diverse interests coming into this course and it is those interests that began to shape our outlook on the class.\n\nQ2: Looking back on our first class in mid-January, what were you thinking coming into this class and what are you thinking as we finish it up?\n\nFirst impressions can make or break a course for some students and my first impression of this course was to ask “why are we already doing work”. I truthfully had no idea what to expect from this class and it was a bit foolish of me to expect just another syllabi reading for our first day. As we dove head first into already scanned documents provided by Dr. Nunn, my excitement only\n\ngrew.\n\nI wasn’t alone with my first day confusion as many students didn’t know what to expect. Mat claimed that “I went into this class with zero expectation. I had no idea what an UnClass was.” And Hannah agreed by saying “ The first class was very interesting because I had no other experience with an “un-class”. I was a little nervous about the lack of structure and free-flowing nature of the course work because I function well with deadlines and more firmly set parameters.”\n\nThis lack of class structure threw a lot of students for a loop and I and many other students were worried about our prior knowledge of the Howers as Karla stated, “I was thinking about how I had no idea who any of the people in the family were in relation to my peers who seemed to know a good bit about the Hower family and Grace Crawford beforehand.”\n\nHowever this confusion did not stop us from pushing forward and enjoying this class to the very end!\n\nKarla: “Now as we finish up it’s interesting to see how much I’ve learned.”\n\nHannah: “As we finish up, I’m very glad to have had this experience as it developed collaboration skills, as well as experiences to think about and approach research in new ways. I felt I had more freedom to examine ideas or leads that would come up, without having to worry about reaching a specific conclusion. Documenting the process of the research, even if it didn’t lead to a specific conclusion, was a valuable learning experience. and highlights the point that primary source research is fascinating .”\n\nMat: “As we come to the end of the semester, I have to say I’m surprised at how invested I’ve become in this class, especially in the archival work, which I hadn’t anticipated at all.”\n\nKatie: “Now I am feeling confident in the work I have produced and excited to share and see my classmates’ projects.”\n\nQ3: What was the most memorable item you found/scanned?\n\nA big part of enjoying this class has come from all of the archival material we worked with. At the beginning of the class, a lot of us expected to be scanning letters or playbills or official documents, but our projects ended up utilizing a wide variety of documents from bank statements to photographs to advertisements and newsletters. This diversity made for interesting and memorable finds.\n\nMelanie said that “I really enjoyed looking at the various membership lists and seeing the different names. Some of them were recognizable (Knight, Polsky, etc.), while others were not. Some of the earlier lists were handwritten on notebook paper, which to me demonstrates the group’s humble beginnings.” Finds such as these were a constant surprise throughout the semester that brought a strange sense of humanity into a class most of us were expecting to be rather technical. Kaden found that “My favorite thing that I found was this picture of a bracelet that Grace had made for her. It was red and the first artifact that I analyzed and was super cool.”\n\nThe little mementos from the Hower family and Weathervane really brought forward a story among dusty, old pieces of paper and creating those stories was one of the most enjoyable experiences from this class. An experience that may not be possible in a regular formatted class.\n\nPhotographs were another big part of the archival document process and we all found ourselves marveling at these little pieces of history captured on film. Hannah (along with the help of Mark Bloom from the UA Archives and Special Collections) found negative of the Dumas Players and said that “The negatives of the Dumas players were really memorable because these were largely hidden in an archival collection that’s not fully processed, and we had no other photographic images available to our group from UA sources. They also show that the Dumas Players were active later than what was originally thought by the earlier research done by Weathervane.”\n\nKatie, upon reflecting on her favorite documents, summed up the experience of working with old photographs perfectly when she said that “I really enjoyed scanning the few photographs from some of the productions. Though not the focus of my project, I think telling stories through photographs is really intriguing.”\n\nQ3: What was the most challenging part of working with these archival documents?\n\nAlthough this class was full of high, enjoyable moments, it had its low points as well. Working with archival materials, regardless of how fun, is a strenuous and challenging process that takes patience and concentration. John claimed that one of the most challenging parts was, “The transcription because Grace’s handwriting is terrible.” This is a sad but real issue with archival materials. Journals and letters were often handwritten and if the person writing happened to have poor penmanship, then it can be a serious struggle to transcribe the text for others.\n\nThere’s also the issue of finding documents that you may need. Hannah ran into this issue during her research claiming that, “The most challenging part of my work with the archival documents was that there are gaps and dead-ends in what I’m trying to research. For example, I would find one document that would answer part of a question, but then there would be missing\n\npages, or only one side of the correspondence, undated or unsourced newspaper articles, etc.” I ran into a similar issue when looking at possible dates for items in the Hower collection. I would discover a document labeled one thing, and then find five other documents of different dates labeled the same way.\n\nAnd, as is the case with the diversity of an UnClass, comes the challenges from a lack of experience. Kaden says that, “The most challenging aspect was interpreting the documents. Since I am a STEM major, it is not my normal area of focus. This has created a “barrier” because I wasn’t familiar with the processes that went behind archival materials.” It can always be hard taking a class outside of your major or skill set, but an UnClass with its open class design is one of the best ways to explore these new skills.\n\nQ4: What was your biggest takeaway from this class?\n\nUnClasses are designed to not be designed. The purpose is for the students to make their own experiences with guidance from a professor. The research, the projects, and the takeaways are all based on the student.\n\nKaden shows that he valued the experience of working outside of his major. “My biggest takeaway from this class was that it is cool to try classes that you normally wouldn’t take. I would have never signed up for this class because I have little interest in archival materials, however, now that I’ve taken a course like this, I would consider taking another.”\n\nMelanie strengthened her researching ability. “This class reminded me just how much there is to research from one topic. From this class there have been three or four main branches of research, but then within the groups there are offshoots of additional research. With my community research, I’ve mapped out where members lived, but you could research each person (their lives, which Weathervane plays they performed in, if they performed with other playhouses, etc.), the neighborhoods themselves, and other things. The list goes on and on with what you could look at.”\n\nAnd Hannah was reminded just how interesting and important doing archival research like this truly is. “My biggest take-away from the class is that archival research is very valuable, but not likely to be easy. You have to be willing to invest time and understand that what you find may lead to more questions than answers at first, but that you are likely to make valuable discoveries\n\nalong the way. You never know what treasure awaits.”\n\nIt goes to show how valuable these UnClasses are and how varied every student’s experience is with this class style. My biggest takeaway is that, despite the stress of working without many guidelines, I can and will find a way to make a fun and beneficial project using my work. This class has taught us all a lot during this too short of a semester and we hope you have enjoyed\n\nkeeping up with all of our work.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our work, please explore the Hower Family Collections and if you ever have a chance, from the “Acting Like a Hower” UnClass, we encourage you to try an UnClass for yourself and experience the excitement for yourself!\n\nBy Mat Cruz\n\nJust a few semesters ago, I switched my major from Statistics to English. I was worried that my time working with data entry and organization would be wasted, that I had taken all those courses for nothing. Strangely, though, I’ve found myself essentially performing data collection and organization for this course as well, which has been incredibly fun! When signing up for the Acting like a Hower UnClass, I hadn’t anticipated being able to apply my prior knowledge. Not only am I finding myself working with what I learned as a stats student, I’m also doing something I’m genuinely passionate about-making information available to everyone who wants it.\n\nThat was why I had an interest in statistics to begin with. I wanted to collect data and information and format it in such a way that it would be easy for a non-mathematically minded person to interpret. Which is almost what I’m doing now, only instead of numerical data, it’s all about people, plays, and Weathervane Playhouse’s colorful history!\n\nBill Kist partially serves as inspiration for the direction this project has taken. He expressed wanting easier ways to find information on people involved in early Weathervane productions. Others, too, have said that it would be great to have an organized system through which you could find information on people and productions put on by the Akron theater. Some might even like to see if there is an overall trend in who performed when and if they had a preferred genre, or if certain genres were more popular during certain years, such as if comedies were especially common during World War II.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous blog post, the first step is organizing the data into a spreadsheet. I made a column for the play number, the title which will contain a link directly to a page of the scanned-in playbill on ContentDM, the director(s) involved, the actors, tech crew, any sponsors listed, musicians, and miscellaneous information that might crop up. My concern with this data is not with documenting the specifics, but in documenting names. If someone was looking for information about N. S. Elderkin, Jr. (a frequent name on these playbills), they could do a simple search function and find each instance of the name. Then, if they are so inclined, they can select each playbill he occurs on and see further details about what he’s done!\n\nHowever, for more visually-minded people, or for those who don’t wish to scroll through a spreadsheet, I am working on another option. The spreadsheet has become rather massive due to the sheer number of names and plays produced, so it could easily become daunting for someone to navigate. The solution I am now working on is using a resource called Palladio, which organizes the information into sort of flowering shapes. In the below example, I took two of the most commonly appearing actors, N. S. Elderkin, Jr. and Paul Strough, and mapped together to see what plays they had performed together. Surprisingly, there were only two!\n\nThis also has its limits, however. Since there are so many names and productions documented, the information can quickly become clustered or hard to navigate without inputting specific parameters. Those parameters can also be frustrating to create, as I had to make an entirely new spreadsheet with the data I wanted as Palladio was not capable of cleaning it up for me. When all of this becomes finalized and accessible, I will likely have to write a tutorial on how to use Palladio most efficiently for anyone who wants a fun, fast way to see just how many productions their loved one was in.\n\nOf course, this is far from including every single production that Weathervane has ever had. I was severely limited by time, given that this UnClass only runs for a semester, and to document every single playbill would be quite a challenge. So I was limited to only the first ten seasons, but hopefully, I have created a comprehendible enough organization system that someone else might be able to pick up where I left off, and eventually, we could have access to an entire online database of Weathervane playbills. Until then, at least there will be a good starting point for people’s searches into either their own family history, or into Weathervane’s.\n\nPlease note that “Acting Like a Hower” blog posts feature archival documents which may contain offensive content.

From various local sources, it is well-established that race relations were rather fraught in Akron during this time period (McClain 1975, 213-230; Endres and Flox 2001, 21-22), which makes the question of the relationship between Grace Hower Crawford and the Dumas Players very interesting. In trying to understand how Grace became involved with the Dumas Players, the issue of race relations has come up often and I want to highlight some of what I’ve found to give some context to why this group and its relationship with Grace Hower Crawford has been so intriguing to me.\n\nFrom the above photo, one can see that Grace Hower Crawford had exposure to people of color from a young age, though we don’t know in what capacity. The Hower Family had servants of color, and Grace travelled widely, gaining exposure to cultures from across the world. There are documents within the Hower Family Papers that show unfavorable views towards some of these cultural groups prior to Grace’s work with the Dumas Players (Hower Family Papers, University of Akron Archives and Special Collections), so what was the difference, or what changed? What drew Grace Hower Crawford to work with this group?\n\nDrawing on playbills and newspaper articles found throughout the Dumas Players folder from Bill Kist along with information from the Hower Family Papers and the Young Women’s Christian Association of Akron (YWCA) collection at the UA Archives, I looked into the YWCA connection with the Dumas Players. I thought maybe this group could have fostered an environment of racial equality and inter-cultural relations that moved this relationship forward. The Dumas Players did indeed hold meetings at the YWCA (Akron Beacon Journal, November 6, 1939 as one example) and perform at the YWCA auditorium (YWCA Collection, Box 42 Folder 1, April 1935 Ys and Other Ys; Hower Family Papers Box D3 Folder 1 as examples). There were even echoes of an official relationship between the group and the YWCA from various articles. Within this Ys and Other Ys newsletter from January of 1935, it seems the Dumas Players may have been considered an official club:\n\nI’ve also found that Grace Hower Crawford was a member of the YWCA, serving as part of the International Institute (Ys and Other Ys Newsletter, March 1935, YWCA Collection) and her work with the Dumas Players at the YWCA goes back to at least August of 1934 (Akron Beacon Journal, August 16, 1934) but from both the YWCA collection in the UA Archives and the YWCA history by Dr. Kathleen Endres and Cheryl Flox, fostering any ideals of a desegregated group or racial equality seems highly unlikely. From an article and survey in the December 1939 Ys and Other Ys newsletter on page 3, you can see how little integration there was in this organization, and it wasn’t until 1950 that “all YWCA facilities were open to everyone, regardless of race” (Endres and Flox 2001, 22).\n\nIt can also be noted from a speech given at a YWCA staff meeting in November of 1938, that from the perspective of the speech writer, African Americans in Akron faced many issues that were not being addressed by organizations including the YWCA, that purported to have missions of support in these areas.\n\nSo, what shaped Grace in the development of her views in working with African Americans? Was she really influenced by the play The Green Pastures, playing in Akron beginning in March 1934 (Akron Beacon Journal, March 5, 1934) as noted in Part I of my last post, or was she already involved with the Dumas Players prior to this time? Did the popularity of the play give the Dumas Players the impetus it needed to move forward with performances to wider audiences as noted in the unattributed news article in that post, or had they already established this goal?\n\nThere are many other lingering questions and still so much unknown about the Dumas Players, its work with Grace Hower Crawford, and its history with the Weathervane, but our group has uncovered some interesting clues to piece together. Our final project will showcase more of the results, which I hope will lead to further research highlighting this important part of Akron’s African American community.\n\nReferences\n\nAkron Beacon Journal. 1934. “’De Lawd’ Rests, Talks About Noah, Moses, Dinner, Actors.” March 5, 1934.

Some aspects being researched are the individual members of the Dumas Players, which was composed of Black actors from the Akron area; Grace Hower Crawford’s connection with the group; and the play, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, which Crawford directed at the Weathervane Playhouse in the summer of 1937.\n\nBelow is a scanned photograph of from Uncle Tom’s Cabin as produced at the Weathervane. We believe that Alfred McMillan, the Dumas Players star, is in this picture, since the scene seems to feature Uncle Tom, a role we know he filled. That said, we cannot completely confirm it, since the back of the photo names the play but not the actors.\n\nWe do know that, in the Weathervane’s production of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the roles of Black people in the story were played by members of the Dumas Players. Given the number of Black characters in the play, this equates to roughly ⅔ of the cast being from the Dumas Players (The Dumas Players folder). The production was historically significant because, in the nineteenth- and even early twentieth-century, Black roles in Uncle Tom’s Cabin were often played by white actors in blackface. Though the play itself was a based on Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 anti-slavery novel, on stage in the nineteenth century the story was often presented as a melodrama that reinforced racial stereotypes, with no Black actors on stage. This history made the involvement of the Dumas Players’ Black actors unusual, and Uncle Tom a particularly difficult role to play.\n\nAlthough most information about Alfred McMillan is unknown, we are actively researching his life beyond his work with the Dumas Players — where he was from, his age, and what happened to him once the Dumas stopped performing together. He was one of the actors most commonly included in the Dumas Players’ cast lists. It’s clear he was a compelling actor that audiences loved. He was an important factor of the Dumas Players’ success and paved the way for other Black actors in the theater community.\n\nIt was historically significant that McMillan played the role of Uncle Tom because he was a main character of the play. By having so much exposure in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the Dumas Players started to gain some recognition from the Weathervane’s audience.\n\nA review of the Weathervane production appeared in the Akron Beacon Journal, written by Edward E. Gloss and published June 22, 1937. Entitled “Uncle Tom’s Cabin Opens at Weathervane; Dumas Players Share Roles,” mentioned the cast, production, and other aspects of the play. The article’s subtitle declares that the casting of Dumas Players alongside Weathervane actors was generally a success, and it points out McMillan in particular. It reads, “Production, rough in spots, challenges interest with mixed cast; Uncle Tom is ably portrayed, Tipsy wins laughs.”\n\nIn the article, McMillan is mentioned a couple times in reference to his role as Uncle Tom. The reviews were positive and great publicity for the Dumas Players, Grace Hower Crawford, and the Weathervane.\n\nGloss sees the play as serious business, even as he states it had often been played for comedy. He begins his review by trying to remind his readers of the comic tone of earlier traveling performances, while also reminding them how controversial the play can be. He says, “Considering that the novel and roving Tom companies fanned the flames of Civil War and succeeding generations swore by the hardy theatrical perennial, levity does not seem appropriate in the[se] remarks.” He doesn’t seem completely sure of what to make of a more serious version of the play, though, and admits he’s never seen a performance with Black actors:\n\n“…I say I have seen worse performances of Uncle Tom’s Cabin which most [playgoers] certainly have and turn to some phases of the Weathervane’s production that pleased tremendously. In casting the production director Grace Crawford recruited players from the Dumas troupe to play her colored roles. I have no memory of a mixed performance.”\n\nGloss singles out McMillan’s performance for praise while admitting that other Dumas Players were not as impressive. He writes, “Alfred McMillan plays Uncle Tom with a sincerity and reverence and to a depth beside which others in the cast, however hard they are working, must suffer in contrast.”\n\nThe review then mentions many of the other cast members names, while clearly linking the play to the Weathervane more than to the Dumas Players: “Uncle Toms Cabin was a Weathervane production. Directed by Grace Crawford. Play based on the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe. On the Weathervane Playhouse stage. ”\n\nWith this semester is almost over, many of the questions that have been asked in past blog posts simply cannot be answered. However, the Dumas Players Group is creating a website to publicly display our findings about the Dumas Players. There will be information regarding Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Alfred McMillan, Grace Hower Crawford’s involvement with the Dumas, and general information regarding the Dumas Players. We look forward to supplying you with the link.\n\nMost sources, except where noted, used in this posting have been leant to the Acting Like A Hower class from Bill Kist, former President of the Weathervane Board of Directors. specifically in the The Dumas Players folder.\n\nReferences:\n\n“The Dumas Players and Grace Crawford.” pp. 1–4. Accessed 4-6-23\n\n“Uncle Tom’s Cabin Opens at Weathervane; Dumas Players Share Roles” Edward E. Gloss, Akron Beacon Journal. Published 6-22-1937.\n\nBy Chloe DiMario\n\nAs this blog’s recurrent readers may know, Grace Hower Crawford was not shy about her desire to travel, and she and her family took many opportunities to explore other countries. The Hower Travel Timeline group has been fortunate to find travel journals, itineraries, cruise tickets, receipts, and so many more documents that have helped to piece together the full extent of the family’s time abroad. However, there is another step to this timeline that needs deeper consideration: the purchases.\n\nMentioned in this previous blog post, a piece in the Hower House collection that has attracted much interest from the staff and visitors is an old Chinese embroidery. It has no date. It has no name. It is simply a red, silk curtain with some people and some animals and some plants, but in reality this piece is anything but simple. What may appear to be a random collection of men and women is actually the story of a festival called the Peach Banquet. Xiwangmu, The Queen Mother of the West and a goddess of longevity, holds this Banquet every 6,000 years to share peaches with other immortals from her immortal peach orchard. This is a popular story that is embroidered as a message of longevity for those who own it.\n\nAnother figure you’ll see on this embroidery is one of the immortals arriving at the banquet. Zhang Gulao, one of the eight daoist immortals, rides in on a donkey that legend claims, upon arriving at his destination, he would fold up like paper until he needed it again. In his arms, there is a fish drum (yugu), a piece of bamboo with two metal beaters. This is one of the attributes of the immortals that each immortal carries with them in their depictions. Take a good look at the embroidery and you might be able to spot all eight.\n\nPlants and animals are another prominent feature of this embroidery and others like it. Insects, birds, fish, and other wildlife have many diverse meanings in Chinese art, depending on how the animals interact with their environment. This next image shows a special spotted deer native to East Asia called the sika deer. The deer is seen as a symbol of longevity because it was thought they would live for a very long time and were the only animals thought capable of locating the fungus of immortality (Ganoderma lucidum or Reishi mushrooms). These deer are often portrayed holding this fungus in their mouths triumphantly, and this embroidery is no different as this sika deer holds a reishi mushroom in its mouth.\n\nAnother prominent animal in Chinese culture is the crane. Thought to have lived for more than one thousand years due to its white feathers, cranes are a symbol of immortality and high rank and are often seen interacting with immortal beings throughout Chinese art. One of the three cranes on this embroidery is sewn into an elegant pose, holding the same reishi mushroom in its beak as the sika deer. To the crane’s left are the branches of a pine tree, a symbol of nobility and longevity as it lives strong throughout any season. When a crane and pine tree are together in Chinese art, the artist is conveying a wish for someone to enjoy the same longevity that the pine tree and the crane have. To the crane’s right is a lotus flower, which holds many meanings throughout Asia and is a very important flower to many cultures. It is a symbol of purity as it grows in muddy areas, but remains clean and beautiful.\n\nAnalyzing the many messages of this embroidery and looking at why an embroidery like this would be made, it can be hypothesized that it was a birthday gift for an older family member. It is unlikely to ever be known if this embroidery was bought by the Howers as a birthday present, or if it had been an item for sale, no longer attached to its original owner. Regardless, it is a testament to hard work and artistic ability as these hand sewn designs tell a deep and immensely cultural story about immortals and longevity. There is still more to be discovered about this piece and many others in the Hower House collection that show just how much the Hower’s traveled the world.\n\nIf this analysis interested you in any way, I encourage you to come visit Hower House once they reopen to see this embroidery and some of the other culturally significant pieces of the collection. You can also check out the book that made this project possible, Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art by Terese Tse Bartholomew. This will provide an in depth consideration of the many symbols and stories found throughout Chinese art.\n\nReferences\n\nBartholomew, Terese Tse. Hidden Meanings In Chinese Art.
