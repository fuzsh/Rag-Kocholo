        "text": "Nunn also appeared in Spider-Man, Sister Act and more.\n\nBill Nunn, the actor who played Radio Raheem in Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, has died at the age of 63. Nunn’s wife told the Associated Press that he had cancer after Lee confirmed his death via social media.\n\nRadio Raheem was almost Lee’s take on a Greek chorus. He wasn’t necessarily the film’s narrator, but he philosophized about love and hate all while touting his boombox in the small section of Bed-Suy, Brooklyn where the film takes place.\n\nWhile Do the Right Thing is almost three decades old, Nunn’s character is a perfect symbol for current events. (And even though the film came out in 1989, I won’t spoil it for you.)\n\nNunn also appeared in Lee’s HBCU musical School Daze, as Daily Bugle editor Robbie Robertson in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy and the excellent New Jack City.\n\nWatch Radio Raheem’s love and hate soliloquy below."
