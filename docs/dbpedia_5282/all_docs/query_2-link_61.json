        "text": "Washington, DC – In an effort to address the growing need for nursing professionals across the nation, Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-NV) and Congressman Zach Nunn (R-IA) introduced the Train More Nurses Act. The bill aims to bolster the nursing workforce and improve pathways for Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) to become Registered Nurses (RNs) while also enhancing career opportunities for health professionals. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senators Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Mike Braun (R-IN). This legislative effort underscores the commitment to addressing the pressing demand for nurses in the healthcare system, contributing to better patient care and healthcare outcomes.\n\nThe Train More Nurses Act directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) to jointly review federal grant programs carried out by both agencies that provide critical support to the nursing workforce. This thorough review will identify opportunities to enhance these programs and provide subsequent recommendations to Congress, particularly in three key areas:\n\nIncreasing Nurse Workforce: The bill focuses on expanding the number of nurses, with a specific emphasis on addressing the shortage in underserved and critical need areas.\n\nStrengthening Career Pathways: To provide nurses with a clear and robust career progression, the bill seeks to strengthen existing career pathways.\n\nImproving LPN to RN Pathways: The bill will help facilitate the transition from Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) to Registered Nurses (RNs).\n\nCongresswoman Titus shared, \"As the demand for quality healthcare across the state continues, Nevada faces a shortage of 4,000 nurses. The Train More Nurses Act is a critical step toward ensuring we can leverage tools to meet this demand and provide the necessary support at the federal level for our healthcare workers. By enhancing career pathways, addressing shortages in underserved areas, and facilitating the transition from LPNs to RNs, we are taking important strides towards bolstering our healthcare workforce and meeting the needs of patients.”\n\n“The nationwide shortage of nurses is hurting Iowa families’ ability to get the care they need,” said Congressman Nunn. “We urgently need to improve the nursing pipeline, and that starts with addressing the need for more nursing faculty, especially in rural and underserved communities.”\n\n“UNLV enthusiastically supports the 'Train More Nurses Act,' which will strengthen nursing education and address pressing workforce shortages, particularly in underserved areas,” said UNLV President Keith E. Whitfield, Ph.D. “The need for skilled nurses and nurse educators in Nevada and nationwide is growing, and we need to do all we can to create pathways for both aspiring and experienced nurses to grow and succeed in the profession. We thank Congresswoman Dina Titus for advocating for the health and well-being of our communities by supporting the 'Train More Nurses Act.'”\n\n\"As a frontline nurse with 26 years of service, I've experienced the staffing crisis firsthand, and know how much the Train More Nurses Act would help,\" said Elizabeth Bolhouse, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at University Medical Center of Southern Nevada and Executive Board Member of the largest healthcare and public service union in the state, SEIU Local 1107. \"We urgently need to improve the nursing pipeline and address the lack of nursing faculty, especially in rural and underserved communities. Supporting more experienced nurses like myself to become faculty, and encouraging other healthcare workers such as LPNs to become registered nurses, would be major steps forward for protecting the health of all Nevadans.\""
