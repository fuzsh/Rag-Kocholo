        "text": "Incumbent Rep. Cindy Axne, Iowa's lone Democrat in Washington, D.C., is fighting to keep her seat in the U.S. House.\n\nThis November, she faces Iowa Sen. Zach Nunn, a Republican and U.S. Air Force official.\n\nNonpartisan election forecasters say the race is highly competitive. Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball expect the district leans Republican.\n\nBoth Axne and Nunn have framed the race as crucial to which party controls the House after the midterm elections.\n\nIowa's 3rd District includes 21 counties in Iowa's southwest corner.\n\nTo help voters, the Des Moines Register sent questions to all federal, statewide and Des Moines area legislative candidates running for political office this year. Their answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nEarly voting begins Oct. 19 for the Nov. 8 election.\n\nMore: A guide to voter rights in Iowa. What you need to know before you cast a ballot\n\nWho is Cindy Axne?\n\nAge: 57\n\nParty: Democrat\n\nWhere did you grow up? West Des Moines\n\nCurrent town of residence: West Des Moines\n\nEducation: Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University, Certified Public Manager Designation, Political Science and Government from Drake University, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism from University of Iowa\n\nOccupation: IA-03 U.S. Representative\n\nPolitical experience and civic activities:\n\nAfter my oldest son lost a lottery system and was told he wouldn’t be going to kindergarten full-time, I fought for all-day kindergarten and won in West Des Moines, ensuring every student opportunity for all-day kindergarten.\n\nI am a long-time lover of animals and advocate against puppy mills in Iowa. I introduced Goldie’s Act — which would amend the Animal Welfare Act and protect dogs in puppy mills.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2014, I worked for the state of Iowa, helping over 20 different state agencies deliver government services more effectively and efficiently in my roles in leadership development , strategic planning and operations and as Division Administrator for the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nSince 2018, I have served as the Congresswoman from Iowa’s Third Congressional District, and have fought to reduce prescription drug prices, lower costs for Iowa families, boost American manufacturing and create new jobs right here in Iowa.\n\nWho is Zach Nunn?\n\nAge: 43\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWhere did you grow up? I’m a lifelong Iowan and grew up on the East Side of Des Moines, and then east Polk County. Our family comes from a century farm with row crops and sheep. We are sixth-generation Iowans.\n\nCurrent town of residence: I live in Bondurant with my wife Kelly, our 4 children and our 2 fosters.\n\nEducation: I graduated from Southeast Polk and then Drake University. I hold advanced degrees in international security from Cambridge University, cybersecurity from Air Command & Staff College, and Strategy and Technology from Air War College.\n\nOccupation: I jointly serve Iowa as a state senator, military officer, U.S. Air Force, and independent consultant working on projects for financial institutions, universities and start-up innovators nationwide.\n\nPolitical experience and civic activities: Following the 9/11 attacks, I joined the U.S. Air Force, deploying on multiple combat tours. In 2014, I won election as state representative, beating an incumbent by 13 percentage points, and again in 2016 by 25 percentage points.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chair: cut crime, passed bi-partisan judicial reform, and combatted human trafficking.\n\nMajority Whip: led largest property tax cut.\n\nElected in 2018, as state senator, flipping a decades-long Democrat seat Republican by 17 percentage points. Passed: largest income tax cut, billions invested in schools, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\nWhat is the most important domestic policy you would champion in Congress?\n\nAxne: Since the day I launched my first campaign for Congress, my mission has been to lower costs for working families here in Iowa. That’s why I spent a good portion of this year fighting for provisions that were included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act to help reinvigorate America’s economy by bringing good-paying jobs back to our shores while fixing our roads and bridges and finally connecting all Iowans to affordable broadband and cutting costs for Iowa’s working families.\n\nThese landmark pieces of legislation also cut prices of prescription drugs including insulin, and cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries — and they are already having a direct impact on Iowans.\n\nNunn: Iowa families are hurting financially and need help now. Hard work needs to be done at the federal level to match Iowa’s economic success.\n\nAt the statehouse, we passed the largest tax cut in Iowa history, allowing Iowans to keep more of their hard-earned money and invest directly in their communities. We’ve balanced the budget and created a surplus, a direct result of common sense conservative leadership.\n\nWe’ve saved Iowans $1.9 billion in taxes, creating a flat tax of 3.9% and eliminating taxes for retirees.\n\nReducing government interference with our lives has benefited Iowa families, we need to make Washington more like Iowa by doing the same.\n\nMore: Gov. Kim Reynolds agrees to 1 debate against Deidre DeJear. She's not the only one to avoid more\n\nWhat is one specific piece of bipartisan legislation you would advocate for in Congress?\n\nAxne: I voted for the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act to help shore up supply chains, create domestic jobs, and save Iowans money by making the semiconductors that run our automobiles, refrigerators and much more in America. We can’t let China dominate this market or allow them to continue to have control over the price of our cars and combines.\n\nI joined a bipartisan majority of the House to advance the National Apprenticeship Act to the U.S. Senate, and I’m still advocating for it today. The bill would expand the Registered Apprenticeship program and create nearly 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years to connect Iowans to in-demand, high-paying jobs through paid skills training opportunities.\n\nNunn: Recognized by Republicans and Democrats with the “Hoover Award” as the most bipartisan legislator, I’ve worked in Iowa’s legislature to combat human trafficking, ensure voter integrity and fight crime.\n\nFamilies are struggling to afford health care due to out-of-control prescription drug prices.\n\nIn Congress, I would work across the aisle to lower the cost of prescription drugs to help patients, families, and providers.\n\nAs proven by work in Iowa, both sides can work together to stop price gouging, foster innovation and ensure access for our rural and urban communities.\n\nIowans are struggling with rising costs and inflation. What can Congress do to help them make ends meet?\n\nAxne: Iowans have been crushed by rising gas and food prices, and I’ve been working to fix this issue for over a year.\n\nI successfully urged President Biden to allow the year-round sale of E15 — a cheaper fuel that supports Iowa’s producers and lowers carbon emissions — and secured millions for biofuels infrastructure in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nI’m also working with Sen. (Chuck) Grassley to tackle the meatpacking monopoly and help Iowa’s producers keep their doors open while driving prices down.\n\nLastly, I’m pushing Congress to act on my two plans to strengthen supply chains, lower food, energy, and prescription drug costs, and create good-paying jobs.\n\nNunn: Inflation is the No. 1 issue harming Iowa families. Every day, I hear from Iowans how the high costs of food, fuel and housing are hurting their day-to-day lives.\n\nThe first step to fixing our economy is to recognize how we got here: Democrats' massive federal spending, tax hikes on all Americans and ending energy independence.\n\nInstead of spending trillions on student loan handouts and new IRS agents, we need to balance the federal budget. We need to invest in American energy and get our supply chain and workforce fixed.\n\nAmericans can lead this recovery with meaningful tax cuts.\n\nMore: This new website aims to help Iowans access treatment for opioid use disorder\n\nCongress passed a bipartisan gun safety law this summer. What further action, if any, should Congress take to address gun violence?\n\nAxne: Everyone deserves to feel safe at school, at work, at the movies, at parades — you name it. I was proud to vote for the first major bipartisan gun legislation Congress has passed in over 10 years that includes stricter background checks, makes sure peer-to-peer gun sales are subject to the same requirements as gun sales that are completed in-store, and more. But, there’s more work that needs to be done.\n\nWe need to get weapons of war off of our streets by reinstating the assault weapons ban, which reduced mass shootings. We also need to invest heavily in mental health care to make sure that we are providing support to those who need it and preventing violence in the first place. We can achieve all of this while respecting law-abiding gun owners.\n\nNunn: I am proud to lead on preserving Second Amendment rights for law-abiding citizens.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees us the right to “keep and bear arms.”\n\nUnquestionably, there are evil people who will stop at nothing to harm others.\n\nThat’s why I‘ve led and passed common-sense legislation to crack down on bad actors, provided billions in funding to protect our children and our schools, enhanced mental health services, and backed our law enforcement, not made them the enemy.\n\nMore: Veterans Home leader's departure, closure policy raise fears; Iowa says no plan to close home\n\nShould Congress pass federal legislation addressing abortion, either to restrict the procedure or to preserve access?\n\nAxne: The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade set our country back decades, and it was the first time that the court ever took rights away. We are now fighting the same battle for reproductive rights as generations of women before us, and I’m leading the charge.\n\nI voted to enshrine the right to choose into law, and it’s time that the Senate do the same by passing the Women’s Health Protection Act to ensure abortion care.\n\nWhile we’re working on this, we need Iowans to make their voices heard at the ballot box and reject far-right politicians who support extreme abortion bans with no exceptions, like my opponent, Zach Nunn.\n\nNunn: Iowans’ voices must be heard. I oppose a federal takeover allowing late-term, on-demand abortions as my opponent voted for.\n\nWith Roe v. Wade overturned, Iowans have the right to craft laws protecting the lives of mothers and babies. I respect the Supreme Court’s ruling to return the issue to the states.\n\nMy voting record is clear: always prioritize the health of the mother and baby.\n\nIn Congress, I support the “Hyde Amendment” to prevent our taxpayer dollars being required to pay for abortions in the U.S., and the “Mexico City Agreement” preventing taxpayer dollars for abortions in foreign countries.\n\nMore: Here's what Sen. Chuck Grassley thinks about a proposed nationwide 15-week abortion ban\n\nWhat policies would you advocate for including in the next farm bill?\n\nAxne: We need to focus on how we can cut the red tape that prevents Iowa’s rural communities, businesses and farmers from accessing federal resources.\n\nCongress needs to continue investing in successful and oversubscribed conservation programs. We need more support for local and regional processing so small and mid-sized farmers have more opportunities to get their product to a local market and not be forced to sell a large monopoly. I will protect against any attempts to make cuts from the vital crop insurance program. I will continue to advocate for more free trade agreements that develop new markets for Iowa agriculture. Another priority is to ensure our family farms stay family farms and are passed on by supporting policy that impacts and encourages more young farmers to get involved.\n\nNunn: As a family of farmers, Iowa agriculture feeds and fuels the world, and I’ll make fighting for agriculture a top economic and national security priority.\n\nThe 2023 bill must include authorization of new biofuel programs with an emphasis on soybean production, price transparency for livestock growers, elimination of burdensome federal regulations, and support farm conservation.\n\nImproving protections for robust crop insurance is critical to the financial security of our farmers and agricultural industries.\n\nAmerica needs year-round ethanol production for energy independence, sustainment and for environmental conservation. Unlike my opponent’s temporary extension, I support permanently lifting the summertime E-15 ban.\n\nMore: Iowa House Democrats unveil campaign agenda: Legalize marijuana, protect abortion rights\n\nWhat is your appraisal of the work of the Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol?\n\nAxne: The attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. An armed group of insurrectionists descended on the Capitol to overturn the results of a free and fair election — injuring hundreds and even killing Capitol Police officers.\n\nThe events of this day and those leading up to it need to be remembered, and the public deserves to know the truth of who was involved and how the attack unfolded so we can begin to heal and restore faith in our democracy and ensure this never happens again. The committee is doing historical work to make that possible.\n\nNunn: January 6 was a tragic day in our country’s history. The rule of law must be upheld and criminal activity prosecuted.\n\nUnfortunately, the Jan. 6 select committee spends excessive time and resources pushing a partisan agenda and playing to the news cameras, with no clear goal.\n\nI have deep concerns about immediate threats to America: an unsecured border, record high crime, unchecked autocrats in China and Russia, U.S. citizens still abandoned in Afghanistan.\n\nAs a combat veteran, I swore an oath to protect our country from both foreign and domestic threats; that’s exactly what I’ll do in Congress."
