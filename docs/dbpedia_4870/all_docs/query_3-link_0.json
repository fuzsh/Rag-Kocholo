        "text": "American politician (1864–1935)\n\nThis article is about the Wyoming senator. For the Pennsylvania representative, see Patrick J. Sullivan (Pennsylvania politician).\n\nPatrick Joseph Sullivan (March 17, 1864 – April 8, 1935) was an American politician. He was the mayor of Casper, Wyoming, from 1897 to 1898 and was a Republican member of the United States Senate from Wyoming from 1929 to 1930.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nSullivan was born on a farm at Kilcrohane, west of Bantry, County Cork, Ireland. He emigrated to America in 1888, landed in New York City, and moved to the Territory of Wyoming where he raised sheep in Rawlins. He moved to Casper in 1892, and became interested in banking, the production of oil, and various other enterprises.\n\nHe was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1894 until 1896, and from 1898 until 1900.[1] He served as the mayor of Casper from 1897 until 1899.[2] In 1912 and 1916 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Wyoming. He was a member of the Republican National Committee from Wyoming in 1924.\n\nOn December 5, 1929, he was appointed as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Francis E. Warren. He served in the US Senate from December 5, 1929, to November 30, 1930, when Robert D. Carey succeeded him.[3] He was not a candidate for the election to fill the vacancy.\n\nThough Mr. Sullivan was a man of law and order, he did reciprocate the voluntary friendship of outlaws of his day. In particular, the Wild Bunch aka Hole in the Wall Gang (led by Butch Cassidy and Harry \"Sundance Kid\" Longabaugh) who respected and were friendly to Mr. Sullivan despite his stand for law and order. (Denver Post - Sunday Morning Edition, March 9, 1930)\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nSullivan died on April 8, 1935, in Santa Barbara, California. He is interred in Highland Cemetery in Casper, Wyoming.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Congress. \"Patrick Joseph Sullivan (id: S001060)\".
