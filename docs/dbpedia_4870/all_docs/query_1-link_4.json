        "text": "CENTENNIAL, Colo. (CBS4) - Pat Sullivan's storied career as a well respected sheriff ended in disgrace as he pleaded guilty to trading meth for sex. Now, Sullivan's name is gone from an Arapahoe County building.\n\nDiscussion among county leaders about changing the name Patrick J. Sullivan Detention Center began after Sullivan was arrested last fall.\n\n\"I asked them to delay it because of some criminal justice matters that were ongoing,\" Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said.\n\n\"Now that the former sheriff has admitted to criminal behavior and been sentenced to a felony crime, I think it's appropriate for the board to go ahead and move on their policy of naming all facilities and specifically the jail.\"\n\nA week ago Sullivan pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine and soliciting a prostitute, bringing an end to the legal case.\n\nOn Tuesday morning the county commissioners removed Sullivan's name from the facility within an hour of making the decision to remove his name.\n\n\"The board of county commissioners voted unanimously at my request to rename the Arapahoe jail to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office Detention Facility,\" Robinson said.\n\nSullivan was sentenced to 38 days in jail and is currently in the detention facility. He should be released April 22 with the credit for time served.\n\nIn the next few weeks, the Arapahoe County Commissioners will discuss if there should be a policy against naming a building after any living person."
