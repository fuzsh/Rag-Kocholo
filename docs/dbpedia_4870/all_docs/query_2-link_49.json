        "text": "Profile\n\nChair of Canadian Commercial Litigation\n\nRecognized as a leading securities and corporate-commercial litigator, Patrick runs an active and varied practice involving shareholder and contractual disputes, oppression matters, takeover battles, defamation claims, civil fraud, trust claims, capital markets, corporate governance issues, complex regulatory matters, and securities violations.\n\nA fierce advocate with a sensible and forthright demeanor, Patrick garners trust and respect among clients, judges, and opposing counsel alike. Employing a results-driven approach and ensuring strategic alignment with clients’ long-term goals have contributed to Patrick’s extensive track record of success in complex, high-stakes and multi-party disputes. Indeed, many prominent members of British Columbia’s business community have, at some point, relied on Patrick’s guidance, advice and expertise.\n\nPatrick leads Whitelaw Twining’s securities law group and is the backbone of the firm’s commercial litigation practice. Those fortunate enough to work with him ubiquitously describe Patrick as an outstanding mentor, generous with his time and palpably invested in the professional development of individual team members and the accomplishments of his team as a whole.\n\nOutside of his professional endeavours, Patrick is a passionate childhood cancer research advocate. Patrick is a founder of the team Finn Foundation and Chairman of the Board of Childhood Cancer Canada. In 2019, Patrick was awarded the Exceptional Leadership in Patient Involvement in Cancer Research and the Governor General’s Sovereign Medal for Volunteers. Patrick is also a member of several national and international scientific teams, committed to advancing innovative treatments to change the face of cancer research.\n\nPatrick enjoys spending time with his family, loudly singing out of tune and off key, and exploring the great Pacific Northwest on his bike – preferably all at the same time."
