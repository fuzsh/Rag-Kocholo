        "text": "Patrick Joseph Sullivan was named for his grandfather, an Irishman. Patrick loved everything Irish and was blessed with the quick tongue and wit of his heritage. He was a master storyteller. He was born January 31, 1943 to his loving parents, Margret Farrell and Edwin Patrick Sullivan to whom he remained devoted though out their lives. In addition to his parents, he was sadly preceded in death by his sister, Louise Sullivan Miller. He is survived by and is forever remembered by his dedicated caregiver who was a son to him, Neil Amog, Sisters, Susan and Denise and Brother Richard, nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, cousins and friends. Pat Sullivan was one of a kind. He was an active union organizer and supporter of Democratic candidates. From childhood, he was never without a companion dog. His best days were spent down the shore. Patrick was cherished and will be sorely missed by all who had the joy of knowing him. He passed away on July 2nd 2021 from complications of a long-term illness. Pursuant to his wishes, a private service will be held in Albuquerque New Mexico where he attended college. May God hold him in the hollow of his hand.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Patrick Joseph Sullivan, please visit our floral store."
