        "text": "SPRINGFIELD — City Parks and Buildings Director Patrick J. Sullivan did his best to share the credit with others as he was honored last week with a lifetime achievement environmental merit award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n“I was just very honored and humbled when I got the call from the EPA that the mayor had nominated me for this award and they had chosen me,” Sullivan said, during an interview with The Republican at his office at Forest Park. “I always had an interest in the field of horticulture and the environment and as I progressed, I tried to make decisions that are basically going to be in the best interest of our environment and for our residents.”\n\nSullivan said credit needs to go to Mayor Domenic J. Sarno for supporting “Going Green” initiatives, and to municipal employees for the focus on environmental protection and energy efficiency related to city parks, open space and buildings.\n\nBeyond protecting parks, the city continues a major, multi-year effort to improve energy efficiency in city and school buildings, having resulted in a 30% decrease in energy use in city buildings since 2007, Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan said he is perhaps most proud of the organic lawn care program in the city, in which the city has reduced the use of synthetic fertilizers in city fields and parks, by replacing them with organic products. The synthetic fertilizers have chemicals that leach into the groundwater and ultimately enter the rivers and streams, he said.\n\nSullivan continues to work on developing plans for a public education program on the impacts of synthetic fertilizers, officials said.\n\nThe EPA summary said that Sarno, in nominating Sullivan “described Patrick’s steadfast work to build an environmentally friendly community.”\n\nSullivan, a Springfield native and resident, has worked for 33 years for the city including as director of parks, buildings and recreation management.\n\nDuring his career, Sullivan has spearheaded more than $80 million in park construction projects, has helped improve ponds and lakes, and has overseen more than $500 million in school renovation projects including roofs, windows, boilers and environmental management systems, the summary said.\n\nSarno, in a prepared release, congratulated Sullivan on “a well-earned and deserved lifetime achievement award.” He called Sullivan his point person on “Going Green” initiatives in Springfield.\n\n“Pat has always been my ‘Green Person,'” Sarno said. “His visionary and practical leadership has not only been good for our environment, but also ‘the bottom line’ of our budget too.”\n\nSullivan said that working within Forest Park is “a dream job in itself.” He recalled that when he began with the department, the current rose garden area was just a “sunken” ground that would fill with water. It was restored to its current beauty, he said.\n\nSome of the buildings were deteriorated and in jeopardy years ago including the Barney Carriage House and old Forest Park Zoo building. The carriage house was fully renovated and the old zoo building is planned as a horticultural learning center.\n\nSullivan was one of nine people in New England, including three people in Massachusetts who received the EPA’s 2020 \"Environmental Merit Award - Lifetime Achievement award for his dedication and support of the environment.\n\nOthers receiving the Lifetime Achievement award in Massachusetts were Margaret VanDeusen of Boston, and the late Barbara Cianfarini of Pittsfield.\n\nThe recipients were honored by teleconference, due to the coronavirus, with Sullivan and Sarno taking part. Those in on remote video call included U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel, and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Martin Suuberg."
