        "text": "Pat Sullivan changed the way Auburn University did business.\n\nAt No.15 on AL.com's list of Top 100 football players, Sullivan is without question one of the best football players in state history. He also might be the most influential of all.\n\nAs the history of Auburn football goes, there was everything before Sullivan, and then there was everything after him.\n\nArguably the most sought after recruit in state history, Sullivan chose Auburn over Alabama in 1968 after a legendary recruiting battle between Auburn coach Shug Jordan and Alabama coach Paul Bryant. Then, beginning with the freshman team, Sullivan defeated Alabama three out of four years. In 1970, he led college football in total offense (2,856) and set an NCAA record for yards per play (8.57). His senior season, he became the first player from Alabama to win the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThose accomplishments place Sullivan in small company among the state's all-time gridiron greats, college or pro. For Auburn, though, Sullivan is uniquely important. He led the Tigers into a new era of college football.\n\nIt was David Housel's job to sell tickets to the show.\n\n\"Pat Sullivan was the Moses of Auburn football,\" said Housel, Auburn's longtime athletics director and historian. \"There have been a lot of Jacobs and King Davids behind him, but Pat Sullivan was Moses.\"\n\nNow a legend himself, Housel graduated from Auburn in the 1960s and began working for the athletic department's ticket office in 1970. Those were busy days. It was Sullivan's junior season, and his popularity pushed ticket sales over $1 million for the first time in school history.\n\nA prep standout at Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic, Sullivan arrived at Auburn in 1968 carrying the weight of tremendous expectations. A modern-day equivalent might be Tim Tebow of the Florida Gators. Sullivan delivered on the hype, and the popularity of Auburn football reached a new mark.\n\n\"The demand for tickets when Pat Sullivan was there enabled Auburn to go to the mandatory season-ticket plan,\" Housel said. \"Prior to that, you ordered individual games. After 1969, to guarantee tickets to an Auburn game, you had to have season tickets.\"\n\nSHUG VS. BEAR\n\nA relentless recruiting battle for Sullivan fed the hype machine his senior year of high school. In those days, the NCAA set few limitations on recruiting, and Sullivan had standing dates with coaches from Auburn and Alabama each week. Each Monday, a coach from Alabama would take Sullivan out to dinner. On Tuesday, a coach from Auburn would do the same.\n\nWednesdays were reserved for other schools.\n\nFridays were for high school games and Saturdays were for visits to universities.\n\n\"My parents didn't let me do anything on Thursday nights,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThere was an early signing period during Sullivan's era, and he committed to Auburn on Dec.15 after his senior season. It was an unlikely event the previous summer that helped Auburn's legendary coach win the affection of Sullivan over Bryant, the king of college football.\n\nIn August, the Dallas Cowboys and the Kansas City Chiefs played an exhibition game at Legion Field. Sullivan accepted an invitation to attend the game with Auburn's coach.\n\nA day later, Alabama called to invite Sullivan to the game with Bryant. Sullivan politely declined.\n\nThe day of the game, Sullivan and Jordan were in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Graymont Avenue when Jordan's car overheated and blew a hose.\n\n\"So the driver said if y'all don't mind walking to the stadium, I'll get the car fixed and come get you,\" Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan and Jordan were walking through the throng of fans when an escort of police motorcycles cut through the traffic. The teams had already arrived at the stadium, so Sullivan asked Jordan who it could be.\n\n\"Boy, that's Coach Bryant,\" Jordan said. \"You can either ride with him or walk with me.\"\n\nSullivan kept walking.\n\nEARLY INFLUENCES\n\nLegion Field was the \"Football Capital of the South\" in those days, and Sullivan was familiar with the stadium long before that recruiting trip.\n\nOnce, he played in a youth football game at the stadium that attracted around 15,000 fans.\n\nEven before high school, Sullivan was a well-known football player in the Birmingham area. He attended Blessed Sacrament in West End, and played on the diocese's Toy Bowl football team run by Catholic brothers. The team's head coach, Brother Christopher Ilg, was a former player for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nBorn John F. Ilg, Brother Christopher died in 2001 after 59 years of religious service. Along with his parents, Jerry and Lorraine, Sullivan has always considered Brother Christopher of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity one of his biggest influences.\n\n\"I have been extremely blessed,\" said Sullivan, who has suffered in recent years due to mouth and throat cancer, but is now cancer free.\n\nSullivan emerged as a star at John Carroll, and he still considers his victory against Ramsay High School his senior season one of the greatest games of his life. John Carroll defeated Ramsay 19-13 at the old John Carroll Field on Montclair Road. Sullivan scored all of the touchdowns and kicked all of the extra points.\n\nThat summer, while playing in a state all-star game, Sullivan knew he and friend Terry Beasley had something special.\n\nBeasley stayed with Sullivan a week before the all-star event, and the two practiced every day at Banks High School. At the time, Banks was the local powerhouse in football and featured a prominent running back named Johnny Musso.\n\n\"I had never thrown to a player like Terry,\" Sullivan said. \"He was so fast.\"\n\nAt Banks High School, and then Tuscaloosa for the all-star game, the famous phrase Sullivan to Beasley began to take shape. Sullivan was named MVP of the all-star game, and a relationship was formed that would cement both Sullivan and Beasley as two of the state's best football players.\n\nDuring their record-breaking junior seasons, Sullivan and Beasley became household names. Beasley was an All-American in 1970 and 1971 and finished his career with 141 receptions for 2,507 yards and 29 touchdowns.\n\nSullivan finished his career with 6,284 yards passing and 57 touchdowns. He also rushed for 18 touchdowns.\n\nPerhaps an undersized quarterback by today's standards (six-foot, 190 pounds), those who played with him say Sullivan's skills as a passer would have translated to the modern game. No one threw a better ball, according to Alvin Bresler, one of Sullivan's receivers.\n\n\"The passing game was born at Auburn in 1969 when Pat Sullivan became the varsity quarterback,\" said Bresler, who was a senior in 1970, or Sullivan's junior season. \"What set him apart was his natural ability to be able to go through all his receivers on the field in seconds. His decision making and ability to get the ball down the field was like a modern-day quarterback.\"\n\nBORN LEADER\n\nSullivan was also an uncommon leader. He commanded Auburn's huddle as an underclassman, and his teammates credit his poise under pressure with leading important comebacks against Alabama.\n\nAuburn's victory against Alabama in 1970 remains one of the greatest Iron Bowls of all time. Auburn trailed 17-0 after the first quarter, but won the game 36-27. It was Sullivan's skills as a leader that made him such a successful football coach.\n\nHe set the foundation for Texas Christian's current success by recruiting LaDainian Tomlinson to TCU, he coached offense at UAB during the Blazers' most successful years and he became Samford's winningest coach in the twilight of his career.\n\n\"Pat Sullivan is etched into the minds of millions of people across the country as the Auburn Heisman trophy winner, but to thousands of us at Samford he is remembered as a transformative football coach who helped student-athletes to achieve success on and off the field,\" said Samford university president Andrew Westmoreland in a statement. \"In talking with young players, I've heard him refer dozens of time to the NFL as 'not for long,' always reminding them that they must prepare for life after football.\n\n\"I've laughed with him after victories and cried with him when confronting personal tragedies in the lives of his students. His reservoir of personal ethics is deep and wide.\"\n\nThe football operations building at Samford bears Sullivan's name. Most recently, NFL receiver Roddy White and some of his former Blazer teammates surprised Sullivan at his home with an impromptu visit.\n\nHow many people in our state's proud college football history are beloved at three different instate institutions like Patrick Joseph Sullivan? That might be the most exclusive list of all.\n\nJoseph Goodman is a senior reporter for Alabama Media Group. He's on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr."
