        "text": "SULLIVAN, Fr. Joseph (Joe) Patrick\n\nMarch 15, 1940 - December 11, 2023\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Fr. Joseph Patrick Sullivan called home to the father Monday morning December 11, 2023 at Montreal's St. Mary's Hospital following a brief illness.\n\nPredeceased by his mother Kathleen Richardson, his father Joseph Sr. his brothers Thomas, Sean, Kevin, Jerry and Terry and his sisters Ellen and Catherine.\n\nHe is survived by brothers Michael and Danny, his brother-in-law Richard and sister-in-law Monique, many nephews, nieces, their children, and many other family members and friends.\n\nA native son of St. Anthony of Padua in Little Burgundy, Fr. Joseph (Joe) Sullivan served a varied and rich ministry that spanned more than five decades. Ordained May 13, 1967, he began his priestly ministry that spring at his home parish of St. Anthony and that summer as chaplain at Trail's End Camp. In the years that followed, he served as assistant at St. Monica, Annunciation, St. Malachy and St. Edmund of Canterbury parishes, during which he also served as chaplain at Marymount, St. Pius X and Pierrefonds Comprehensive secondary schools. In 1977, he began a seven-year mandate as pastor of Transfiguration of Our Lord, during which he also served for two years as part-time chaplain at the Royal Victoria Hospital. He was engaged in full-time hospital chaplaincy work from 1985 to '88, first at the Royal Victoria, then at the Montreal Children's. In 1988, he was appointed pastor of St. John Br√©beuf and in 1994, he was named parochial administrator to the east-end communities of St. Aloysius and St. Philip Neri, serving until 2008. He returned to Transfiguration as administrator until 2010 before retiring, after which he was available for occasional ministry. While in the east-end, Fr. Sullivan also took on a new ministry at Canada's highest security prison facility located in Ste-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, from 1995 to 2005, where he ministered specifically to prisoners housed in the Special Handling Unit.\n\nFr. Joe was very proud of his Irish heritage. He was named Irishman of the year 1989. He was chief reviewing officer of the 1992 St. Patrick's day Parade. He was Chaplain to the United Irish Societies, the Erin Sport Club and Innisfail.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt prayers and condolences to Fr. Sullivan's family, close friends and his brother priests, and all those who were touched by his ministry.\n\nPlease continue to keep in your prayers the members of the Sullivan family, Fr. Joe's close friends, brother priest, and the faith communities he served, during this time of mourning and thanksgiving for his life and ministry.\n\nVisitation: Thursday, January 4, 2024 from 6 p.m. - 9 p.m. at Transfiguration of Our Lord Parish,11775 Filion, Montreal, QC.\n\nA prayer service will be held at 7:30 p.m. presided by Msgr. Francis Coyle, CSS. Funeral Mass: Friday, January 5, 2024 11:00 a.m. at Transfiguration of Our Lord Parish with Fr. Peter Laviolette as the main celebrant.\n\n*A reception will be held in the parish hall following the Funeral Mass.\n\n*In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the charity of your choice."
