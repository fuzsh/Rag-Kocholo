        "text": "WATERBURY – Patrick J. Sullivan, 58, passed away Sunday, Dec. 15, 2013, at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury after a long illness.\n\nHe was born in 1955 in Waterbury shortly after the 1955 flood and was known to quip that the flowing waters were sent to cleanse the earth for his arrival. He attended elementary and high school (Holy Cross High School) in Waterbury and grew up in Wolcott.\n\nHe was known as a force to be reckoned with on the baseball diamond and football field. He attended Mattatuck Community College and Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H. He worked for years in the Connecticut mental health system and later attended culinary school, subsequently finding employment at Lily Lake Inn in Wolcott.\n\nTo all who knew him, Pat was knowledgeable, always with a quick, sometimes biting wit. He enjoyed immersing himself in trivia and, due to his excellent memory, became the family historian.\n\nHe was quick to offer an opinion on any subject and ruffled many-a-feather with his candid insights through the years. He was a student of human nature and the unexpected, sometimes hilarious turns the foibles of mankind would provide.\n\nHe was most passionate about his three children and spent most of his adult life focused on providing nurture, guidance and wise counsel to them. In his waning years he intimated that his greatest sadness was in not having been able to provide yet more fully for their welfare.\n\nHe is survived by his three children, his son, John Sullivan of Thomaston, and his two daughters, Katie and Meaghan Sullivan of Terryville/Bristol. He is also survived by his loving mother, Elaine R. Sullivan, formerly of Wolcott; his sister and brother-in-law, Mary (Sullivan) and Michael Waszkelewicz of Marlborough; his sister, Ann Sullivan of Walpole, N.H.; and his brother and sister-in-law, John Sullivan and Julie Isidro of Middletown.\n\nHe will be missed by three nephews, Brett and Kyle Waszkelewicz and Dan Sullivan, as well as two nieces, Jennifer Sullivan and Michelle (Sullivan) and her husband, James Bittel. Pat also leaves behind recent friends and acquaintances from his residence on Holmes Avenue, Waterbury, a place he was happy to call home.\n\nFuneral arrangements will be managed privately by the family. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Diabetes Association, the American Liver Foundation or the Yale-New Haven Transplantation Center."
