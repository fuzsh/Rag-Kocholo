        "text": "Abstract: Mental health courts offer alternatives to incarceration for persons with severe mental illness who are involved in the criminal justice system. These courts have the dual function of ensuring treatment for persons involved in the court as well as ensuring the safety of the public. Persons with severe mental illness who are involved in mental health courts rely on others for support, such as family members. Others may buttress the participant from engaging in criminal activities and provide for needs of the participant.The supportiveness as well as the composition of one’s network members may play a role in the success of mental health court participants, such as successfully completing the mental health court program and avoiding incarceration. Little research has explored how social support impacts mental health court participants. We explored how the composition and sense of support of network members were associated with mental health court participants’ quality of life. We regressed quality of life on social support and network characteristics of 80 participants in two mental health courts. Findings suggest that perceived support is positively associated with quality of life, and the proportion of family in one’s network was negatively related to quality of life. Findings suggest that persons involved in mental health courts need supportive others in their social networks in addition to family. More research is needed to explore the reasons having a higher proportion of family members in one’s network is associated with lower quality of life. Practitioners need to pay attention to and leverage mental health court participants’ social networks to help improve their quality of life\n\nWhile perhaps not garnering the attention of conditions like cancer or heart disease, or behavioral health conditions such as addiction and mental illness, obesity is emerging as a major health concern across the globe. While statistics vary, reports indicate that upwards of 2/3 of Americans can be considered overweight, while more than 30% can be labeled as obese. In recent years, obesity has become increasingly characterized as a chronic health condition, and as such, it is important to take a comprehensive, and long-term approach to care. Social workers should play a central role in reconfigured models of obesity care and given a growing recognition of this as an emerging social problem, such involvement is both needed, and appropriate.\n\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not fully explain why some who experience war feel as though their assumptive world and sense of meaning has been shattered. Two concepts mentioned in the literature that address this feature of trauma are moral injury and spiritual injury. This work reports on qualitative findings from postgroup interviews with 18 participants who completed a spiritually integrated eight-session group intervention known as Search for Meaning. The group is designed to deal directly with issues of moral and spiritual wounds. This article discusses three main themes related to (a) the group process, (b) spiritual struggles and repair, and (c) the role of the group leaders. The findings support the call for specialized interventions to supplement mainstream PTSD treatments.\n\nAs our understanding of trauma is expanding, greater consideration is being given to factors such as moral injury and spirituality. Moral injury appears to be especially pertinent in the case of war-related trauma, as one may not only be the victim of, or witness to, troubling events but also be the perpetrator of acts that run counter to personal values. For some, moral beliefs and values and key elements of the assumptive world are intertwined with spiritual and religious matters. This article discusses moral injury and repair in the context of spiritually and culturally sensitive practice. Strategies for addressing issues such as moral anguish, loss of meaning, identity disturbance, guilt and shame, forgiveness, and spiritual struggle are discussed.\n\nOver the last decade, there has been increased momentum to bring the worlds of physical and behavioral health care together. Instead of social work education simply reacting to this change, it is imperative that we be proactive and prepare students to be “multilingual,” that is, be able to speak and function in both the worlds of health and mental health so they can move seamlessly into the new world of integrated care. The purpose of this article is to explore curricular and pedagogical strategies needed to prepare graduate social work students for the coming shift in practice toward integrated health and mental health care.\n\nAs our understanding of trauma is expanding, greater consideration is being given to factors such as moral injury and spirituality.
