        "text": "Patrick John Sullivan, 71, of New Cumberland, passed away on Thursday, November 2, 2023 at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Derry Township. He was the son of the late Gerald J. and Anna (Shultz) Sullivan, born on October 21, 1952 in Williamsport.\n\nPat graduated from Williamsport Area High School (Class of 1970) before going on to earn his bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at Penn State University. On October 16, 1976 he married Donna Jean Zarr of Watsontown, PA, his wife of 47 years. He spent his career with the federal government, first working with the Army Corps of Engineers, where his first project was to help design the recreation facilities at Raystown Lake in Huntingdon County. He then worked a short time for the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) in Chicago, Illinois before securing his dream job with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) working as a civil engineer. This career took Pat from Washington D.C., to Syracuse, NY, to Camp Hill, PA and he would retire as the head Airport Planner for the country, splitting time between Camp Hill and Washington, DC.\n\nPat was fascinated by the history of aviation (and his favorite airline, TWA), and he volunteered regularly at the Pennsylvania Railroad archives in Strasburg. He was also a parishioner of St. Theresa Catholic Church, New Cumberland, and a longtime member of the American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE).\n\nIn addition to his wife, Donna (Zarr) Sullivan, he is survived by his children, Sean Patrick Sullivan of Lewisberry, Andrew Joseph Sullivan of Susquehanna Twp. and Amy E. Sullivan of New Cumberland; brothers, Michael J. Sullivan (wife, Mary) of Pottstown and Kevin J. Sullivan (wife, Margaret) of Seattle; a sister, Honora A. Simmons (husband, Richard) of Wellsboro; three sisters-in-law, Deborah Hardman of Linglestown, Linda Zarr of Enola, and Joanne Murray (husband, Michael) of Watsontown; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 11AM on Wednesday, November 8, 2023 at Parthemore Funeral Home & Cremation Services, New Cumberland. A public viewing will take place from 10AM until services begin in the funeral home. Interment will immediately follow in Rolling Green Cemetery, Camp Hill.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a contribution in Pat’s name to either: St. Theresa Catholic Church, 1300 Bridge Street, New Cumberland, PA 17070, or to the Central PA Food Bank, 3908 Corey Road, Harrisburg, PA 17109."
