        "text": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KBAK/KBFX) â€” \"I think we can all say that we should be really proud of ourselves for graduating in a pandemic and just doing the best that we did this year,\"Shanon Lee, Student Body President at Stockdale High School, said.\n\nLee says despite school taught virtually for the majority of the school year, she thinks her graduating class is where they need to be academically and ready for college, thanks to teachers using technology like Google Meet, email and Zoom to communicate with students and help them.\n\n\"Some of my teachers would have office hours after school, so they would open their Zoom meeting up for a certain amount of time for students to just kind of pop in and ask any question,\" Lee, said. \"Having office hours, even if it was through Zoom, it's a lot better than for me personally having no office hours at all.\"\n\n\"The teachers learned a lot about using technology, the kids learned a lot about using technology and we found a lot of innovative software and different ways to do things,\" Scott Odlin, Principal at Stockdale High School, said. \"I saw teachers filming themselves in their classrooms, doing science labs so that the kids could experience them while they were at home.\"\n\nMonday night, 614 Stockdale High Seniors graduated at their football field. In past years the graduation has been held at Mechanics Bank Arena or Bakersfield College's football stadium, but both were unavailable this year. Students were limited to two tickets for parents or guardians to sit with them on the field and two more tickets for loved ones in the stands.\n\nPrincipal Odlin is confident the advanced placement exams students are taking for college will show the students are where they need to be.\n\n\"They're going to take the same AP exam that a lot of previous students have taken, so those scores we're hoping will be comparable to other years of the scores on the AP exam,\" Principal Odlin, said."
