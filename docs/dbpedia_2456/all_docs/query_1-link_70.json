        "text": "Good morning Bakersfield. The Renegade Red and White Roses have starting blooming in my front yard. A lot of white and one solitary red. Saturday, April 7, 2018…a great day to be a Renegade!\n\nLoved seeing Nick Strobel’s discussion on TESS the exoplanet satellite scheduled to be launched and its mind boggling complexity.\n\nBakersfield College Southwest\n\nThe community has been clamoring for a BC presence in the Southwest.\n\nOn Friday, April 6th, College Council met at BC-SouthWest to explore the facility and continue building on our ideas to ramp up class availability and courses for students at this alternative location.\n\nWe had a great morning hearing updates from Nick Strobel about BC’s ISER in preparation for our accreditation visit later this year, hearing from Janet Fulks and Khushnur Dadabhoy regarding transfer pathways, and Liz Rozell and Manny Mourtzanos about the upcoming courses being offered at BC SouthWest.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King\n\nThis Wednesday, America commemorated the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination at a motel room in Memphis, Tennessee. Even though his life was taken at the age of 39, Dr. King’s short life spent fighting for equality in the United States was like a small candle that lit the wicks of millions, inspiring generations that came after him to continue his important work.\n\nEvents commemorating Dr. King’s assassination took place across the country on Wednesday, but the march in Memphis attracted thousands of people who marched a mile and a half in his honor. Details about all of the marches can be found in Jenny Jarvie’s article published in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRegistration Rocks (HUGE THANK YOUS)\n\nRegistration Rocked once again, but this time at 28 of our local high schools on April 5, 2018. Roughly 3,300 fully matriculated high school seniors were invited to register in just one day.\n\nCan you imagine the team effort it took to pull this one off?! Let me introduce you to some key people who made it happen.\n\nTuesday’s training to prepare the various teams that went out to the high schools was led by Steve Watkin and Ashlea Ward.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOn Thursday, the teams deployed to the 28 high schools charged and ready to go! Command Central was staffed with three key people to monitor all the activity and incoming needs. Thank you Michelle Pena, Jennifer Achan, and Steve Watkin.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nDue to the high traffic, by 8:00AM the system glitched and crashed…. but our District Office IT heros, Stephen Kegley and Carl Bowman were on the ball and helped us out immediately. Huge thank you to our partners in IT at KCCD. Zav even called this the Registration War Room.\n\nAt Stockdale High, we were led by our fearless leaders Jonathan Schultz and Josie Gullian. For me, it was a rewarding experience to sit with incoming students and help them firsthand, pick and register for their very first college classes. And while I was assisting students, almost every one of them registered for 15+ units in Fall!\n\nThe two pictures above are with Scott Odlin principal of Stockdale High School. He was so proud of his students. Thank you Scott for letting us work with the Stockdale students.\n\nAll of this could not be possible without our superstars at BC, doing what they do each and every day to serve our students and help them on the path to success.\n\nThank you to our counseling department and the incredible counselors who worked very hard to pull this off.\n\nBarbara Braid for leading group ASEP workshops and triage throughout the week\n\nJonathan Schultz for leading Stockdale high school outreach and then turning around the next day to meet with more high school students in group appointments\n\nMarisa Marquez for mapping all of the transfer pathways at the institutional level while meeting with students individually\n\nKeri Kennedy for accepting, reviewing, and supporting Kern Promise students in between individual student meetings. Leading multiple measures 4.0 application\n\nLaurel Mourtzanos for leading an analysis of high demand courses based on student ed plans to help us be strategic in course offerings\n\nJo Ann Acosta who returned from surgery to process paper problems for students\n\nJulian West and Jonathan Ward for leading African American Mentor Program Open House and getting more high school seniors registered into Umoja and a full load of courses\n\nVictor Diaz, our academic senate Vice President, who is full of life and always brings a positive energy to the center\n\nShohreh Rahman who leads the international student program, providing a safe home for our students who often travel to Bakersfield without a full support system\n\nFabiola Johnson who oversees our at-risk and probation work to ensure one bad semester doesn’t take a student off path entirely\n\nSarah Villasenor who works with our students of concern team and leads communication to keep students on their path\n\nMark Osea, the fearless department chair who has taken on tech projects, works on the curriculum committee, and collaborates with other departments across campus\n\nNew counselors experiencing their first big spring semester registration push and hanging with us like champs: Brynn Schock, Steve Agard, Aneesha Awrey, and Dinorah Castro.\n\nCountless educational advisors for meeting with drop-in students back-to-back: Abe Castillo, Jeff LaForce, Pearl Urena, Josh Shackelford, and others\n\nThe outreach ed advisors for leading high school outreach: Manuel, Josie, Pedro, and Debi\n\nEOPS, DSPS, CTE, Title V, Financial Aid, veterans, and athletics counselors and advisors embedded in the departments providing direction and guidance: Angelica, Cynthia, Manuel, Cathy, Jeff, Vanessa, Pam, Dominica, stig, Evette, Lucy, Venessa, Isabel, Diane, and Armando\n\nOur CSUB Transfer counselors who have office hours on campus: Natasha and Alicia\n\nOur Delano counselors and advisors who ensure rural students have the information they need: Jesus, Veronica, Jessica, Jesse, and Elvira\n\nThe front desk staff and students for quickly processing check-ins, answering calls: Bernadette Martinez, Luz Mendoza, and Jahnea Palfrey\n\nEryn Justice and Jackie Lau gave a well prepared and thoughtful presentation to the Delano Counselors on Concurrent and Dual enrollment as well.\n\nJackie Lau, you are a rock star. I remember being so inspired by your passion and tireless energy as you volunteered countless hours to Measure J. Thank you!\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL Bakersfield College experts, including staff, administrators, counselors, advisors, student workers, and everyone who was either assigned to be at a high school, or assisted students with registration this week.\n\nHigh school staff and students showed a great amount of gratitude for our efforts in continuing to make their transition toward becoming a Renegade a smooth one.\n\nWhat we do is support our students and what that means is life changing. This is guided pathways in action. Thank you!\n\nWe are BC!\n\nAnd the Registration Rocks started with a massive banner for enrollment hanging off the Center for Student Success! What an exciting time to be at BC!\n\nShout out to the Renegades who helped pull this massive endeavor off.\n\nThank you to Dylan Wang, our Graphic Designer and the M&O Team including Corey Garcia, Tim Hernandez, Mitchell Barter, Aaron Kidwell, and Landon Webb.\n\nOpen registration begins April 18th.\n\nPhotographed below is Dylan Wang and the M&O Staff with the banner!\n\nBC Hackathon\n\nBakersfield College is gearing up for the second annual Hackathon. The theme for this year’s Hackathon is Health and Social Justice. Kern County struggles with many public health challenges and health inequities.

Over 30 guests representing various school districts, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private businesses were in attendance. Bakersfield College provided a delicious traditional Mexican breakfast for the guests. As the host organization, we had the opportunity to update the group on what is happening at the college.\n\nI began the presentation by thanking the various school partners in attendance for their support, including DJUHSD Superintendent Terri Nuckols and the entire room for supporting Measure J. In doing so, these people helped to ensure that the community of Delano would be better served by BC and I concluded by discussing new programs coming to Delano.\n\nKCCD Trustee Romeo Agbalog also shared words of appreciation for the group. He noted that as a Delano native he is happy to see all of the great things happening in education for the community’s youth. He made sure to give longtime Delano Campus admissions and records technician, Helen Calip, a shout out. He stated that he was her biggest fan.\n\nAbel Guzman proceeded to inform the group about the enrollment growth at BC Delano in recent years. Additionally, he provided data showing that BC Delano students are just as successful, if not more successful, than all students college wide.\n\nBill Potter concluded the presentation by unveiling the upcoming Measure J construction projects on the BC Delano Campus. The group was excited to learn about the upcoming Learning Resource Center.\n\nThe Delano Community Alliance group is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving needy families in Delano. Bakersfield College is always happy to host the breakfast.\n\nThank you to the Delano Community Alliance, especially Steven Kinsey, Rosalina Rivera, Linda Hinojosa, Sheryl Alexander, Dorsey Driggs, Maribel Reyna, Matthew Cauthron, Abel Guzman, Dr. Terri Nuckols, and Dave Stebbins.\n\nWas happy to see Scott Spielman at the meeting. Scott is on BC’s Pre Law Advisory committee and has done numerous presentations at the college.\n\nSpecial Recognition for BC Programs\n\nBC received special recognition of career education programs with outstanding workforce outcomes. Thank you to Van Ton-Quinlivan, Executive Vice Chancellor, Workforce and Digital Futures.\n\nMultiple programs at BC have been named as Strong Workforce Stars because they have outstanding post-college outcomes in employment, earnings gains, and regional living wages, based on Strong Workforce Program LaunchBoard data. Several programs have earned the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Stars recognition because graduates attained one or more of the following thresholds for economic mobility:\n\nAn increase in earnings by 50% or more\n\nAttainment of the regional living wage by 70% or more\n\n90% or more are employed in a job similar to their field of study\n\nCongratulations to all who contribute to student success in the following programs!\n\nBRONZE STARS (attained threshold outcomes on one metric)\n\nAutomotive Technology: 113% increase in earnings\n\nAnimal Science: 111% increase in earnings\n\nPlant Science: 90% increase in earnings\n\nAgriculture Business, Sales and Service: 90% increase in earnings\n\nForestry: 101% increase in earnings\n\nArchitecture and Architectural Technology: 245% increase in earnings\n\nAdministration of Justice: 81% increase in earnings\n\nCorrections: 73% of students attained the regional living wage\n\nFire Technology: 78% of students attained the regional living wage\n\nCulinary Arts: 163% increase in earnings\n\nHuman Services: 404% increase in earnings\n\nSILVER STARS (attained threshold outcomes on two metrics)\n\nVocational Nursing: 113% increase in earnings and 67% of students attained the regional living wage\n\nElectrician Apprenticeship: 59% increase in earnings and 83% of students attained the regional living wage\n\nIndustrial Technology: Electronics: 76% of students attained the regional living wage and 100%of students are employed in a job similar to their field of study\n\nGOLD STARS (attained threshold outcomes on all three metrics)\n\nRadiologic Technology: 329% increase in earnings, 100% of students attained the regional livingwage and 100% of students are employed in a job similar to their field of study\n\nRegistered Nursing: 226% increase in earnings, 87% of students attained the regional living wage and 97% of students are employed in a job similar to their field of study\n\nOne of our data coaches Elisabeth Sundby created the following bar graph to compare the threshold to achieve this award and BC’s actual performance.\n\nData Coaching\n\nBC’s completion coaching teams serve students through “high touch” (emails, phone calls, texts, group meetings, faculty classroom announcements) within the Learning and Career Pathways, sometimes called meta-majors. This high touch, proactive coaching of students is dependent upon high tech information to determine WHICH students need WHAT information WHEN. Each completion coaching team has a specified data coach, that may be a faculty, classified or management volunteer, who is trained in getting the information to the completion coaching teams. Data coaches fulfill several functions within the completion coaching communities. The Office of Institutional Effectiveness (OIE) provides live, regularly updated data based upon a wide array of variables and demographics, heretofore unavailable simply because their weren’t enough researchers for all the reporting necessary. BC currently has 31 data coaches that receive data training, including FERPA certification, and have a certain knack with data but also have day jobs that intersect closely with students every day.\n\nThe data coaches job is actually three-fold. First, the data coach serves as a “data clarifier.” It is the data coach’s responsibility to help their fellow team members understand the right questions to ask, interpret questions they’re not sure how to ask, and make meaning of data. Second, the data coach serves as a liaison with the Office of Institutional Effectiveness. The data coach communicates and submits data requests to the OIE about the completion coaching community’s information needs, which are developed and fine-tuned in meetings with the rest of the completion team. Third, the data coach may serve as a “reconnaissance unit.” In other words, the data coach retrieves information about student populations, which activates the other completion coaches with targeted and individualized communication to students in need of particular messaging. Much of this work is aligned to the communication plan that helps keep students on track and on target to complete their educational goals with regards to expectations, deadlines and other important information.\n\nThe picture shows a data coach meeting where data is being filtered, retrieved and delivered to the completion coaching communities so that we can reach out to students registering beginning April 4. The message reminds them to register, focusing on core classes, in a timely manner while classes are available. The data and the communication helps the institution get the right students, in the right classes, at the right time. High tech guiding and facilitating, high touch!\n\nBakersfield Life Celebrating BC Faculty\n\nProfessor Josh Ottum was profiled by Jennifer Olague in Bakersfield Life Magazine last Saturday, talking about his career as a songwriter and creating the Commercial Music program at BC.\n\nAfter years spent touring across the US and Europe as a musician and having his music featured on television programs such as “Mad Men”, Josh decided to become a music professor and bring out his students’ full musical potential with classes on recording techniques, live performance and songwriting at BC.\n\nI’d like to thank the Californian for profiling Josh and the Commercial Music program, and I’d like to thank Josh for teaching valuable skills to our local musicians.\n\nBC SGA event\n\nKern County prosecutor Cynthia Zimmer had lunch with BC students on Wednesday and discussed why she wants be the next person in charge of the District Attorney’s office.\n\nBCSGA’s Office of Legislative Affairs hosted Zimmer as part of its Power Lunch series, which has featured prominent local politicians such as Jean Fuller, Vince Fong and KCCD Trustee Romeo Agbalog.\n\nZimmer grew up in Coalinga and was the first person in her family of four to graduate college. She credits her time at West Hills Community College as foundational to the rest of her career, which involved graduating from Cal State Bakersfield and Loyola Marymount Law School.\n\nCelebrating Renegade Athletics\n\nCCCAA Spring Convention Awards\n\nLast week was an exciting time in Renegade sports as two of our student athletes received awards from the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA). March 27-30th, the CCCAA held their Spring Convention in Concord, CA. They awarded Jasmit Thind with a position on the 2017 Men’s Honor Roll and awarded Aisha Maston with induction into the CCCAA Hall of Fame for Track & Field.\n\nThe CCCAA is authorized by State Legislature to establish rules and regulations to administer the athletic activities of CA community college athletics for nearly 25,000 men and women student athletes. Bakersfield College athletics are governed by CCCAA and is one of 18 members of the Western State Conference. You can learn all about Renegade Athletics at gogades.com.\n\nI’d like to introduce you to Jasmit Thind. He was placed on the 2017 Men’s Scholar Athlete Honor Roll. CCCAA selects the winners and honor roll members from nominations made by CA Community Colleges. Candidates must have a minimum 3.5 GPA, participate in two seasons of sport at the college, and show outstanding leadership as an athlete, student or in college and/or community activities.\n\nJasmit, is a two year member of the BC football team with a cumulative 3.95 GPA.

PIQE is a program dedicated to providing families the knowledge and skills to partner with schools and communities to ensure their children achieve their full potential. The parents take part in a nine-week long course that covers topics ranging from four systems of higher education, financial aid, and engaging with high school staff and administrators.\n\nGustavo Enriquez, Jesse Oropeza, and Abel Guzman had the opportunity to speak with the parents for over an hour about all things Bakersfield College related and more. Parents learned about dual and concurrent enrollment opportunities. More importantly they learned that their students can get a head start towards attaining a college education. All three BC representatives shared their own personal journeys as first-generation college students, which resonated with the parents whose children are also all first-generation students.\n\nWe’re always happy to connect with students and parents in the community of Arvin!\n\nRenegades Keeping Busy this Summer!\n\nI love when I hear student success stories and when faculty share their excitement with me. Congratulations to Martha D. who was accepted to The University of Virginia to do freshwater research this summer. This program is through the National Science Foundation and will last 11 weeks. We have a fabulous science faculty. #WeAreBC\n\nJimmy Santiago Baca\n\nThe Levan Center kicked off April’s National Poetry Month with a presentation by Jimmy Santiago Baca, who told the story of how he overcame being abandoned by his parents at the age of two and teaching himself to read and write in prison on the path to becoming one of America’s most celebrated Chicano poets.\n\nBaca, who grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, won the National Book Award for poetry in 1987 for his semi-autobiographical anthology “Martin & Meditations on the South Valley”. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1993 film “Blood In, Blood Out” starring Benjamin Bratt and featuring performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Danny Trejo.\n\nBaca continues to be inspired by the struggles of other Chicanos and Mexican-Americans in his writing. Baca recited one of his poems about a hate crime he witnessed against a Mexican in his neighborhood, and he told the story of how he was able to keep a family from being deported on a train he was taking to Los Angeles for a film production by calling Michael Eisner, Disney’s CEO at the time, and putting him on the phone with immigration authorities.\n\nBaca also invited Vidal Herrera, the subject of an upcoming book he’s writing, to talk about being one of the first Chicano forensic crime scene investigators in America, getting famous from designing the iconic “Welcome to East Los Angeles” poster, and reconnecting with his father after 60 years to put together the missing puzzle pieces of his family’s history.\n\nBaca has 28 books in 31 languages, and he believes that all of them are still in print because he strives to portray the authentic experiences of real people through his writing. “My love for you is why I’m still here,” Baca said.\n\nSee all the photos at BC’s SmugMug.\n\n“Lady Leaders” program by faculty of WHAM\n\nActivist women from across the political spectrum came together at the Levan Center on Thursday night to talk about how they work every day to create the change they’d like to see in the world. This event was the last thing planned for BC’s Women’s History Month programming organized by Roza Garza, Olivia Garcia and the Women’s History and More (WHAM) committee. BC history professor Erin Miller moderated the event, which featured a short presentation by each of the three speakers and a question-and-answer portion from the audience.\n\nCathy Abernathy has worked on Republican election campaigns for over 30 years, starting with the congressional office of Gerald Ford, who was the Speaker of the House before becoming president after Richard Nixon’s resignation. She was the Chief of Staff for Bill Thomas during his time in Congress, and she’s worked on several Republican political campaigns in the California legislature. Aberathy, who is now a frequent political commentator for several local news stations, found working on election campaigns to be the most rewarding part of her career.\n\n“In politics, you really know whether or not you accomplished something by the end of the campaign,” she said.\n\nJessica Flores started volunteering for non-profit causes at a young age, and as she learned more about the struggles that women, people of color and other marginalized groups face in the United States and around the world, she felt a calling to dedicate her life to raising awareness of those struggles. As a progressive political activist, Flores often feels daunted by the magnitude of work that needs to be done in order to enact change, she continues to organize and participate in marches, write letters to politicians and do anything in her power to raise awareness of the issues important to her. “Whatever small way you can contribute, do so, because the revolution needs you,” Flores said.\n\nKimberly Kirchmer grew up in a religious household and attended a Mennonite college in the Midwest, where she was inspired by the compassion of pacifist Christians to pursue a life of advocating for women’s rights causes. A survivor of sexual assault, Kirchmer organized several local productions of the Vagina Monologues in Bakersfield shortly after moving her 13 years ago. She is also President of the Democratic Women of Kern and organized the 2018 Kern County Women’s March, which brought together over 5,000 people and 50 speakers to march for equality. Kirchmer offered a similar message to Flores, pleading for those who want to make an impact on the world around them to go ahead and do it.\n\nSpecial thank you to the WHAM committee for organizing this event and all of the Women’s History Month programming and thank you to our guests for taking the time to inspire our students.\n\nAndrew Kamiti\n\nThanks to the generous support of the Norman Levan Center for the Humanities, anthropology professor Krista Moreland was able to bring renown Kenyan artist Andrew Kamiti to Bakersfield College’s Indoor Theater on April 5th.\n\nShe’s hoping to bring more guest speakers to campus in the future, making BC a local and global nexus. Andrew paints and draws Kenya’s flora and fauna, using art to bring awareness to these beautiful and endangered plants and animals. BC students and members of the community came out to see this self-taught artist, and it was a wonderful night! Before the presentation, the Spanish club and their advisor Prof. Martiza Salgueiro-Carlisle hosted a pizza party for Andrew.\n\nThis cultural exchange was a great experiences for BC students, who shared American and Mexican culture with Andrew, and asked him questions about the tribes and cultures of Kenya. There was a lot of laughing, lot of eating, and a lot of about family, school, food, and travel. The BC students who wish to visit Africa had lots of questions for Andrew. BC faculty were also at this multicultural event, including Sarah Palasch, David Neville, and Gilbert Ayuk. It’s great to see students and faculty together outside of the classroom!\n\nIn his presentation Andrew transported the audience to Kenya through images, videos, and personal stories. His passion for Kenya’s wildlife could be seen in his art and heard in his voice as he shared stories about his homeland. He knows his art subjects so well, like Judy the Chimp and Imani the cheetah. His favorites is Scarface the lion, who he feels represents the spirit of Kenya as he experienced many hardships before finding peace within the pride he shares with his brother Earless. One of Andrew’s favorites things about Kenya today is that it’s such a peaceful place to live, the hardships endured before Kenya’s independence are now a faded memory. He couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. He shared the beauty of Kenya through discussing the National Parks he regularly visits, and his current goal of drawing all the big cats at Maasai Mara National Park.\n\nThe audience learned about the natural wonders of Kenya, and by the end everyone was discussing which was their favorite animal. Andrew also discussed his artistic process, highlighted with slides that showed photographs of animals along with the stages of the drawings of those animals. The audience was able to see how fragile Kenya’s beauty is when Andrew shared photos of Sudan, the last male Northern white rhino, whose recent passing marks the end of his species. It was an entertaining and enlightening presentation that ended with many interesting questions from the audience on the technical aspects of his work, including what media and paper he uses, how he photographs dangerous animals, how he chooses his subjects, and which animals are the most difficult to draw.\n\nThe best question of the night came from Prof. David Neville’s young daughter (and aspiring artist), who asked ‘How do you feel when you’re drawing?’ Andrew gave a big smile as he answered, ‘Happy. I feel happy when I draw’.\n\nHere is a photo of them. Can you see why I’m the luckiest and happiest college president ever?\n\nRenegade Art Show\n\nArt Professor, Diego Gutierrez Monterrubio and his students hold an art show each spring. This beautiful display is put on by the drawing and advanced drawing classes in front of the Fine Arts building. Enjoy these beautiful pictures.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nCan you see why I’m the luckiest and happiest college president ever?\n\nFun Photos\n\nOn Thursday, Sue Vaughn was spotted in the Welcome Center assisting students with registering for classes. #WeareBC!\n\nI also snapped this photo of the Executive Office Staff. These women are smart, hard working, and so beautiful.\n\nAttended the KCCD Leadership Academy graduation on Friday before I rushed off the Delano. Here is the group picture of the graduates thanks to John Hart and then I snapped this picture of Genevieve Graber who makes all this happen.\n\nLiz Rozell and I had a great time making plans for an Early College Program with DJUHSD Superintendent Terri Nuckols. The energy on the room was great even though it was Friday afternoon after a long week. I snapped this picture.\n\nRenegade Pantry\n\nABC23 spotlighted the Renegade Pantry this week, a student assistance program that exists to help maintain the health and welfare of students through organized college, community sponsorship, and donations of nonperishable food, clothing and hygiene items. Special thank you to Tori Cooper for visiting campus to see what we do firsthand.\n\nView the clip here: https://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/kern-county-institutions-help-battle-food-insecurity\n\nRenegade Talks are back\n\nSee you at the Indoor Theater on March 10th. Thank you Andrea Thorson and Todd Coston.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/2142196916023725/\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality."
