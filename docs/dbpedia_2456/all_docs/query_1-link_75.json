        "text": "Audio articles on Wilson County News made possible by C Street Gift Shop in downtown Floresville!\n\nThe Stockdale Independent School District (ISD) has named another lone finalist — the third since April — in its rough road to find a new superintendent.\n\nStockdale ISD board members convened for a special meeting June 20 and named Poth High School Principal Todd Deaver as the district’s lone finalist for the superintendent position. According to state mandate, the district now must observe a 21-day waiting period before they can confirm Deaver’s employment in the role.\n\nThe announcement came a week after the previous lone finalist, Navarro ISD’s Gilbert “Luke” Morales, withdrew from consideration, opting to stay at Navarro ISD, after that board named him as acting superintendent.\n\nPrior to choosing Morales, Stockdale trustees had named former district superintendent Paul Darilek as the lone finalist to replace\n\nDaniel Fuller, who left in March. Darilek rescinded his bid in May, also during the 21-day waiting period.\n\nWhat is meant by ‘lone finalist’?\n\nAccording to Texas Government Code, Section 552.126, Confidentiality of Name of Applicant for Superintendent of Public School District — related to public information: “The name of an applicant for the position of superintendent of a public school district is excepted from the requirements of Section 552.021, except that the board of trustees must give public notice of the name or names of the finalists being considered for the position at least 21 days before the date of the meeting at which a final action or vote is to be taken on the employment of the person.”\n\nIn an informal ruling by the Texas attorney general, this section protects the names of superintendent applicants, but not the finalists. For this reason, Texas school boards often designate a candidate for superintendent as a lone finalist, to provide privacy for other applicants for the position and prevent criticism from the district where they are currently employed."
