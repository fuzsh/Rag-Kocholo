        "text": "Jaydenn C.\n\nThe absolute worse place to send your child. Attendance and staff have attitudes and play \"favoritism\". Had take a breath outside Because I have asthma and was told that I needed to go back inside very rudely and unprofessional way by security. Security also harasses you over passes that are not a year to date that mind you \"teachers\" are supposed to get not \"students\". Staff also has petty beef with students and doesn't act like grown adults. I would never in my life nor do I recommend anyone else to send there child to such a school that treats students unfairly. The way the staff acts is truly ridiculous and childish.\n\nNov 5th, 2019\n\nAmy L.\n\nI was absolutely miserable while attending this school. The environment was incredibly toxic, and I was made to feel like I was completely worthless. However, after leaving, that horrible experience has taught me how to stand up for myself, as I no longer tolerate the sort of behavior I saw there. Throughout the 7 schools I have attended in my life, none have had the overwhelmingly negative and toxic atmosphere I felt there. I hated every second from that school, and have only negative memories from my time there.\n\nJul 10th, 2019\n\nAnnika P.\n\nthis school's the most racially diverse out of ye olde town of bakersf*ck and least likely to have a maga hat-sporting cousin-f*cking student population (try liberty or frontier), but the office staff (excluding krista and like. the principal and whatever) kinda like suck and there's definitely nepotism amongst the teachers (what school doesn't have that). attendance ladies are rude, condescending, and lazy (on more than one occasion i was just standing there waiting for them to get done gossiping for ten minutes so i could get a call slip, and they clearly saw me and did nothing). some teachers are definitely more racist than others. in conclusion school gave me depression but i'm glad i actually got to learn about evolution and didn't go to like bchs\n\nJun 2nd, 2019\n\nC B.\n\nWORST SCHOOL EVER. I wish I never went there. Suspend you for getting punched. And Mrs. D the special education teacher kept me outside in the rain if I didn't have my to do list done by the time I came to her class (idk what I need to work on till I get there usually and I don't have time in other classes!!) then she'll mark you late. At an actual meeting, with patient advocate, both her, the vice principal, the head of the special education.. all told me to give up on going to college since they will never slow down for me, all in front of my father... the next day my migraines started. Not what I wanted from my freshman year. The choir teacher doesn't let you get water except on her breaks when there is a water fountain right there!!! She makes you sing till your throat hurts, it ruined singing for me. There are a few great teachers there though. They made that year bearable by being so kind and understanding my learning disability. I hope it's gotten better since then.. they also punish you for using the bathroom and or being late due to few bathrooms with detention and in school suspension if you don't go!!\n\nOct 12th, 2018"
