        "text": "We believe that an exceptional school innovates, empowers and encourages its leadership in the pursuit of excellence. Together, our Local Governing Board (LGB) brings diverse perspectives to act as a critical friend and a trusted advisor to the Senior Leadership Team, as it seeks to realise its bold ambitions for the School. Our members draw on senior specialisms in finance and law, education, commerce, media, communication and sport, and benefit from the spiritual guidance offered by Reverend Jonathan Wilkes, who has been a member of the LGB for many years.\n\nThe LGB meets four times per academic year to review Surbiton High Schoolâ€™s Strategic Plan within the context of everyday life at School and to discuss any other pressing matters which may arise. Our meetings are dynamic: they aim to provide a balance of support and challenge for the School as we work in partnership with its leadership to anticipate and capitalise on change. Periodically, we are also joined by members of staff who update us on focus areas including Sports, Well-being and Safeguarding, and help to provide us with a full and rounded insight into life at the School."
