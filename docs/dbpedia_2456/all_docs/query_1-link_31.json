        "text": "My name is Patrick Spears and I am the Principal of Actis Junior High School, home of the Americans. After graduating high school, I attended California State University, Long Beach where I majored in Industrial Engineering. I worked in industry for seven years at various companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Western Digital, and Beckman Instruments. My career in education began when I relocated to Bakersfield in 1996. After receiving my teaching credential, I taught 6th grade for part of a year but the bulk of my tenure was spent teaching in junior high school. I taught woodshop, drafting, technology, and video production at Tevis Junior High School until 2005 when I accepted the vice principal position.\n\nEstablished in 1979, Actis Junior High School has a rich tradition of excellence in areas such as academics, music, athletics, as well as maintaining a safe and healthy environment for student learning. My goal for Actis is to prepare all students to be respectful, responsible, and honest in learning and in life. At Actis we believe in providing a rigorous curriculum that meets the needs of individual students academically, physically, socially, and emotionally. Each child will have access to a comprehensive instructional program that provides every opportunity for students to learn and grow. It is our responsibility as educators to provide every possible opportunity for students to gain the knowledge and skill sets necessary to become productive citizens.\n\nMy hope is that those involved in the educational development of young people will work together in creating an American that our city, county, state, and country would be proud of."
