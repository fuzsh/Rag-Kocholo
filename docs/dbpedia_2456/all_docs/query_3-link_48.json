        "meta_description": "Tashawn Yvette Winston, 52, entered glory after a valiant battle with Multiple Myeloma on December 27th. She was born on December 14th, 1971 to Beverly and Elcie Winston, Jr. She attended Garces Memorial High School before heading off to UCLA, like the women in her family before her. From UCLA she earned both a bachelors and masters degree before returning home and beginning her teaching legacy. She went on to earn two additional masters degrees from CSUB.  Tashawn will not be defined by the cause of her death, but rather her reason for living. A beloved daughter, sister, aunt, friend, and mentor, she dedicated her life to education. Devoting 31 years to the Kern High School District, she began her career as a young math teacher at Stockdale High before moving into administration as the Dean of Students at West High, Assistant Principal of both Administration and Instruction at Stockdale High and finally the District’s Director of Instruction. She was dedicated to creating positive changes and spaces for all students and did so through mentoring, community involvement, and the support of programs in Bakersfield. Her investment in young people helped them graduate with academic excellence and social confidence, fortifying them to be successful in life and their postsecondary pursuits.  The simplest pleasures brought her great joy. The “Queen of Green,” she had a great passion for reading, thrifting, the HGTV Network, and was an avid glass and pottery collector.  Tashawn is welcomed by her mother Beverly and her precious schnauzers Sam, Max, and Beau and a host of other witnesses. She is survived by her sister Tanya Winston, niece Chase Wheeler, nephews Julian Wheeler and Julian Wheeler, Jr., her beloved Kern High School District family, extended family, and friends whom she loved dearly.  A scholarship is being created in her honor; we ask that you contact the Office of Instruction at the Kern High School District for more information. (661) 827-3100.
