        "text": "Acriticalreviewofthehelp,\n\nYou seem very knowledgable in general, and about this book specifically. However, I cannot help but feel that some of your criticism is unfair. This book is set in a certain time, when social mores and conventions were far different than today. And to state that African-Americans at that time had a much different inner dialogue than what is portrayed seems somehow disingenuous. How can anyone truly know what was in people’s minds at any time, unless that person wrote down what they were thinking at that time? Also, as this is a reconstruction of a time and place that no longer exists in the same form, certain poetic licenses are a given. Also, I have personal experiences to back up my statements. As such, please read on.\n\nI grew up primarily with African-American kids in the mid 60’s in Watts and Compton, California. I was one of the only white kids there, and I was fairly well accepted. I can remember much of the conversation that swirled around me as basically an observer. And I can tell you that since I was young and quiet, most people spoke about whatever was on their mind, as if I was not there. And that goes both for adults and kids. Consequently, I heard a lot of very insightful dialogue on what people were actually thinking, and I can tell you that, while this was not the deep south, nevertheless many of the views that I overhead, and much of the language, were very similar as to what was portrayed in this novel.\n\nAfrican-Americans’ attitudes were starting to change, but many of the comments that I recall were self-deprecating, or even downright unkind when they were speaking about themselves or their friends. Mind you, I never spent much time around adult men, as they were either at work, or absent from the homes in those poor neighborhoods, so I did not hear as much of their conversations and thoughts as I did the women’s. Even worse though, many of the views that I heard espoused were just plain racist as concerned their attitudes and their views on other African-Americans, especially if they were older people talking about youger ones. However, many of their views on other, older African-American people were the most racist comments that I ever heard when I was growing up. This shocked me quite a lot, considering my age (from six-years-old until my teenage years).\n\nBut I am getting ahead of myself. Let me add a bit more background.\n\nA while after we had first moved to Compton, while I was at my grade school, was when I first heard the “N” word. I did not understand what it meant. However, as I knew that it was said about a young African-American boy named, Ocie, who was my best friend, I turned to someone who I figured would know what it meant: namely, a middle-aged African-American housewife who spent a lot of time outside with other African-American women, gossiping.\n\nShe was always very kind to me, so I felt just fine about approaching her. Also, one of her daughters, who was about my age, and who was my friend, had died of a heart defect a little while before this happened. And as I had no idea what “dead” meant, I would go to their house to look for my friend. However, when she tried to explain to me that her daughter could not come out to play with me, I did not understand. And as other people were doing it, I asked my parents if I could take flowers that I picked to my friend’s house to give to her mom.\n\nI was always a sensitive boy, and precocious far beyond my years. However, since my earliest memories were from Taiwan, where I was raised without television or any entertainment other than what mischief my friends and I could get into outside, I had no concept about the rest of the world. For instance, I knew what Chinese people were, but until we moved to Compton, California, I had no idea what a “black” person was, and had never seen one that I could remember.\n\nConsequently, shortly after we moved to Compton, my mom was walking me to the school to enroll me, when I saw a “black” kid walk past me, and I asked rather excitedly and loudly, “Mom! What is THAT?!” After all, I truly had no idea. Needless to say, my mom was HORRIFIED! She quickly hushed me, and told me not to say another word until we got home, whereupon she would explain everything to me, which she did. Thereafter, I had nothing but African-American friends for many years.\n\nAnyhow, back to my friend’s mom. Her mom was so kind to me, and sort of surprised, I guess, that I brought flowers to her, that she cried when I showed up on her porch. This scared me as, first, I was half expecting her daughter to come running out of the house any moment, having gotten over this “dead” illness and, second, because I had no idea why she would be so upset. After all, her daughter was just sick, and I had even been sick myself. It was no fun, but it wasn’t too bad. And even though her other kids were older and didn’t want to play with me once their sister didn’t come out anymore, nevertheless she invited me to come over for cookies and such anytime that I wanted.\n\nWith this history, and knowing how kind she was to me–always taking the time to talk to me, even if she was busy or talking to the other neighborhood ladies–I never hesitated to go over to her house to ask what in the world did this or that mean? So when I was stumped by what the new-to-me “N” word meant, naturally I went straight to her house to find out.\n\nWhen I asked her, I will never forget the look on her face. She was, I think, a bit surprised, but she also looked almost as if she was going to laugh. She immediately bent over to pick me up, which she had never done before, and which I found a bit odd. I was suddenly mortified, as it dawned on me that if the “N” word needed a lot of explaining, that perhaps it was not a nice word. I think that she could see the apprehension in my face, because she sat on her front porch steps and sat me on her knee with a slight smile. However, what she said to me still affects me to this day. In her usual, kind manner, she looked at me, and started out by addressing me as, “Honey.”\n\n“Honey,” she said, “that is not a nice word. You shouldn’t say it out loud or even think it! Sometimes you will hear white people say it about us colored folks, and sometimes you will hear us colored folks saying it to each other. But, Honey, let me tell you that word is not a “nice” word, and the world would be a lot better off if it was never thought up, or if everyone would just stop saying it.”\n\nBy now I was truly mortified. She was so kind to me that I felt horrible about saying a bad word to her, even though she didn’t seem upset. However, she was a big woman, and I had no idea how bad the “N” word was to say out loud. And even though she was always kind to me, the thought crossed my mind that she might spank me. After all, this was at a point in time when kids were spanked everywhere; in school, at home, and just about everywhere else of which I could think. I started crying and hiding my eyes, as I was embarrassed to look at her. She hugged me and “shushed” me until I stopped crying. Then she said, “Oh, Honey, there’s no harm in asking about something you don’t know!”\n\nI was a bit relieved, but I knew that I was truly out of hot water when she invited me to have some cookies and Kool-Aid on her porch. Of course, I took her up on that, but what she had said was forever burned into my mind, “…the world would be a lot better off if [the “N” word] was never thought up…”\n\nAfter then, and especially as I got older, I made a special effort never to use that word, even when in the company of bigoted high schoolers or other peer groups as I got older. I also became more of a loner, as my views often clashed with the mostly ignorant people with whom I tried to be friends. And just to expand this idea out to its full ramifications for me, I knew what segregation and discrimination was since I was very young. I learned these awful lessons when we first tried to move to the Compton area for my dad’s job as a Navy spokesman for the Compton Naval Draft Intake Center and Recruiting Office, directly next to the railroad tracks that separated Watts from Compton, on Alameda.\n\nMy mom was Jewish. When my dad looked around for apartments in the “white” part of Compton, as this was where he was told to look by other married, Navy personnel, he put in a lot of rental applications in that area. I have another memory that is burned into my memory from back then, and that was the first day that my dad took our whole family to see some of the apartments on a list that he had compiled of where he had filled out applications.\n\nMy dad had been assured by the manager at the first apartment where we stopped that we were “perfect” for a nice apartment that he had available. I remember the landlord looking at the application while we all piled out of the car to see the apartment. However, the landlord suddenly stiffened and called my dad over.\n\nIn those days, there were few enforced laws about what could be asked on an application, and even fewer enforced laws about discrimination. Even though he spoke in a low voice, we all could hear the question that the landlord asked my dad. He asked my dad about my mom’s maiden name, which he had required in the application. My dad told him that it was exactly as he had spelled it, “Rosenberg.” We could see the landlord’s back stiffen, and then he said to my dad that he had forgotten to tell him that the last apartment had already been rented.\n\nMy dad’s face turned bright red. He was no stranger to violence, but he called us over to get in the car. When we passed the landlord, we could hear him mutter under his breath, “F***ing Jews!” My dad was so mad that he started cursing a blue streak, but he drove us to the next apartment on his list. It was now too late, however. Back then the white part of Compton was insular and closed to outsiders.\n\nWe quickly learned that all of the landlords in the white part of Compton had organized something of a “neighborhoid watch,” as concerned potential renters who they felt would ruin their neighborhoods. Jews were one of the races that HAD to be kept out at all costs. Consequently, when we went to the other apartments on my dad’s list, suddenly there were no vacancies.\n\nNow absolutely furious, my dad drove us over to the “black” part of Compton, to an apartment that was near his office, but also directly across the railroad tracks from Watts. We ended up moving into a little cul-de-sac right next to the corner of E. Rosecrans Ave., and N. Rose Ave., next to the fence of the National Guard armory, and behind a church that was on the corner of Rosecrans and Rose.\n\nThis quiet little house, nestled firmly in the center of the “black” side of Compton, was where I grew up for many years. I loved it there so much that when my dad announced that we had to move to his new duty station, I cried myself to sleep for weeks after I heard the hews, and up until we left for good. I was inconsolable, and this frightened my parents, as they had no idea what to do to help me to feel better. Even after we entered our new lives at the beach, I was depressed for a long time. I had spent most of my formative years in Compton, and that was all that I knew about the world. In fact, all of the white kids scared me. They were NOTHING like my African-American friends whom I had to leave behind.\n\nDue to my formative years being spent in Compton, and being there for truly momentous happenings in anyone’s life, but especially an impressionable boy–Bobby Kennedy’s assassination, Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination, the Watts riots, the moon landings, etc.–Compton was my frame of reference for the whole world…and I did not much like the rest of the world back then. I just wanted to go back to Compton.\n\nBut I digress. I want to relate a story to you. This story is one of what people now call reverse racism (which always struck me as being an oxymoron: racism is racism, no matter which way it cuts), and it happened to me. Again, please read on.\n\nOnce we were settled into Compton, my parents decided that they wanted to continue what had become something of a tradition to them. Every Friday night in Taiwan they would go out for drinks and dancing. Now, in Compton, my parents had new best friends, an African-American couple who’s husband was in the Navy with my dad, and who’s wife worked in retail sales. They became very good friends and stayed that way until my parents both died recently.\n\nThe Johnson’s sent very nice sentiments and flower arrangements to my mom’s funeral. Normanda Johnson, the wife of the couple, was devastated. Her best friend of nearly fifty years, and my beloved mother, Lois Hall, had died. And when my dad died, this scenario was repeated for my beloved, hero of a father, Kenneth G. Hall.\n\nAnyhow, once they became friends they all wanted to go out drinking and dancing. It was decided that as their house was in a safer part of town, my sister and I would stay over at their house with one babysitter and their son, until all the adults came home. Back then, The Brady Bunch was number one on Friday nights, and even though we had an African-American babysitter, her favorite show was, what else, The Brady Bunch! There were some other decent kids shows on television back then on Friday nights, so we were allowed to stay up past our bedtime to watch them.\n\nOnce the shows were over, we were ushered into the bedroom. To this day I have no idea why they had so many beds in their son’s bedroom, and I never thought to ask them when I was older, but there was a large double bed, and a bunk bed that had, of course, two beds. My sister and I were to split the bunk bed, with their son in the big bed. But, alas, no sleep was to be had by me.\n\nAlmost as soon as we were in bed, the Johnson’s son, whose name escapes me, attacked me. He was relentless. As we were both small, no one was seriously hurt, but as I said previously, I was a very sensitive child. As such, and since I did nothing that I knew of to provoke him, I could not fathom why he hated me so much, and wanted to harm me. I was too young at the time to examine the situation too closely, but I now feel that he was either jealous for some reason, he just hated white people, or I had triggered his wrath some unknown way. Perhaps I was too quiet, which he took for me not liking him? I was shy, but got along with almost everyone, so that did not make sense to me.\n\nHe kept it up for hours, not letting me sleep. Finally, in desperation, I fled out to where the babysitter was still watching the television. I tried to stay out there with her, but the Johnson’s son followed me out there, and then proceeded to attack me on the couch. Instead of doing anything to stop him, the babysitter looked amused, and told us to take it into the bedroom. I was now terrified! What if I did manage to fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion? Would their son try to seriously harm me once I was totally defenseless?\n\nNeedless to say, I did not get any sleep that night. And despite my extreme objections, my parents still made me go over to his house every Friday night, where the attacks continued unabated. Finally, when my objections rose to near panic, my parents asked what was wrong, so I told them. They found it hard to believe that I was telling the truth, but one night in the past I had come home with a bloody nose, so after considering my story for a while, they finally decided that I was telling the truth. As such, and without telling the Johnson’s why, my parents hired us our own babysitter and kept us at home.\n\nTo this day I have no idea why their son hated me so, but he did a lot of damage to my sense of well-being. I had nightmares for years after these episodes of violence and fear. Also, as he went to the same school as me, he knew my best friend, Ocie. I have no idea what he said to him, but it must have been a lie, as sometime after my parents let us stay home, my best friend, Ocie, would no longer talk to me. When I asked him why, he ignored me, then went over to the Johnson’s son to be his friend.\n\nThis still bothers me to this day when I think about it. I know that I did absolutely nothing to deserve to be treated that way, but I had no idea how to fix it. In all the years that I lived there, Ocie never spoke to me again, which broke my heart. In fact, after my one girl friend died, and my one boy friend ignored me, I started to become something of a loner. I did make other friends after that, but I was always very guarded afterwards. I am still not sure if any of my newer friends ever really got to know me.\n\nYes, racism is an ugly thing, no matter which side it is on. For this reason alone, but along with everything else that I learned by listening, I am more inclined to give the author of this book a pass. After all, wasn’t her goal to try to further the dialogue on racism? In that regard, whatever your objections to the book, I feel that she has earned a right to “quiet enjoyment” as promised in the U.S. Constitution. And let’s face it, even if she got it the slightest bit wrong, she got a lot of it right, and that is what should matter the most.\n\nOkay, I’ll admit it. Even though I definitely do not agree with all of your, well, for want of a better word, “diatribe,” I have to,admit that you make some excellent points. And besides, I laughed my ass of while reading your blog post on the dialogue. That was too funny! Now, having said all of that, I have to reiterate that I was raised in a black neighborhood. Well, THREE black neighborhoods, two of which I moved to on my own, as that is where I felt most comfortable.\n\nI lived in Compton, California, when I was young, in downtown Oakland, California (corner of Fruitvale and East 24th, a predominantly black community), and in the Meharry-Hubbard area in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, which was alternately one of the funniest areas in which I ever lived, and the most harrowing. While in Nashville I was subjected to some of the most garbled language that I have ever tried to understand. I could easily understand “southern talk,” but I found “black” southern talk almost unintelligible at times.\n\nLet me give you a “for instance.” First, I must say that here, as much as anywhere else, I was more accepted by the African-American community more than the redneck one. Of course there were outliers in both communities, but I felt more at home with black people (as they identified themselves, and sometimes called “African-Americans” “uppity ni**ers, much to their own amusement, and accused them of only living in places like New York or Los Angeles). Anyhow, I heard things in Nashville that totally baffled me, and I am VERY good at listening through dialects or accents, such as Irish accents, or Louisiana Bayou accents and dialects, as examples. Other people tell me all the time that people with accents who are speaking, and whom I understood as clear as day, may as well be talking Greek as far as they are concerned, and as much as they understand them, which is not at all.\n\nI think that I got really good at dialects and accents because of the many places that I lived in my life, including many foreign countries. But in Nashville’s Meharry-Hubbard downtown area, which is a teaching hospital and dental school, right smack dab in the center of a ghetto, I often heard things spoken that needed translation. Case in point: One day I was walking with a very pregnant Southern Belle past the hospital. As we passed a black guy sitting on the steps of the included drug rehabilitation center, he said quite plainly, in his thick, black southern accent, “Fi’ing a ha’it?” I say “quite plainly” as I could easily reproduce the sounds, but I had absolutely no idea what he said.\n\nAs the girl was talking to me at the time, she missed what was said. I stopped, and turned to her as, admittedly, I was now intrigued. When I told her that the man asked her a question (which I could tell by the inflection in his voice), she asked me what he said. Being a decent mimic because of my ability to inderstand dialects and accents, I repeated hack to her exactly what I had heard. The Belle laughed, turned to him, and said quite simply, “No!” As we walked away, I asked her what was so funny. She told me that she was partly laughing at me, due to my excellent imitation of the man’s speech, but my inability to understand it, and as a result of the man’s question. “Okay,” I demanded, “What in the heck did he say?!” To which she replied quite amusedly, “He asked me if I was ‘Fixing to have it?'”–the baby, I mean. Suddenly a lightbulb went on over my head, and obviously those, um, “words” made an indelible impression on me, because here it is so many years later, and I still remember exactly what the man asked.\n\nThat was one of the funny times when I lived in Nashville. I won’t get into the harrowing times due to their graphic nature, but I saw guns, robberies, murders, etc. Nashville was a real mixed bag, of that I may assure you. I also have many more funny stories, but I feel that I should have bagged my quota with that masterpiece that I just recited. But my point, while not being as well made as I had hoped, now having shared that last story, is that even though I am not black, I do know how black people talk when there are no people around whom they need to impress in any way. It varies quite a bit by the region of the country where one finds oneself, but their “friend” dialogue is vastly different than their “The Man” dialogue. And I used to mimic them exactly, as this was one of my coping skills, and probably why I was accepted in the black communities as readily as I was.\n\nConsequently, and even though Shakespeare it is not, I have heard a lot of dialogue that is similar to what is in that book. This blog creator is quite obviously very well educated and well studied, but does that equate to the vast majority of the 60’s population of African-Americans being similarly educated and well-spoken? Obviously it does not. Just because one does not like something, and is able to debate very well on that subject, does not make that something untrue. Similarly, the vast majority of African-Americans that I have noted, and who are objecting to the language, are educated, schooled professionals, or middle-class homeowners.\n\nYes, the language at times seems stilted, inarticulate, and even ridiculous at some points, but does that invalidae the premise that uneducated, disenfranchised black people who were living as lower-class serfs, essentially, would speak a kind of pidgin English that I have heard with my own ears? I agree that comparing oneself to a cockroach would be fairly outrageous under any circumstance, as are some other passages, but again, does hating the depiction of their language make it untrue? Has anyone done a thorough vetting of the language and the people who were speaking it back then, and whether older blacks who are from that very society give the language as depicted any validity?\n\nUnless these, and other important questions have been thoroughly researched, I do not feel that it is fair for ANYONE to claim thatbthey know what it was truly like back then. Until\n\nI hear from a large cross-section of that community from that area, and until THEY ALONE invalidate the language unreservedly, then I am going to have to give the benefit of a doubt to the author. Presumably she researched the era and the language, just as any decent, serious author would have done? Has she spoken to this topic? I need answers before I will accept anyone’s blanket condemnation of a “period piece” novel. Many of the exact same charges were leveled at HBO’s “Deadwood,” that is until the very thorough research of that era proved that much of what was depicted was absolutely true, even if proud weterners hated the depiction, and vehemently disagreed. There was some “artistic license” taken, and some of the language was over the top, but that is why it is called a “depiction,” and not a 100% true biography.\n\nOkay, now! I want that homework completed and on my desk by our next session! Class dismissed!"
