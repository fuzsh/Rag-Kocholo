        "text": "Dark secrets and unspoken suspicions come between Zoey and Stevie Rae, putting their friendship - and the House of Night - at risk.\n\nAfter Zoey Redbird and her gang have banished Kalona and Neferet, the fallen High Priestess, from Tulsa, you'd think they'd catch a break. But with Zoey and her sexy Warrior Stark both recovering from a brush with death, and the fledglings struggling to deal with the fallout from Neferet's reign of terror, a break is just not in the forecast. Zoey is haunted by her confusing yet elemental connection with A-ya, the ancient Cherokee maiden who was the only human able to tempt Kalona's body and soul. How will A-ya's pull on her affect Zoey's ability to resist the dangerously seductive immortal? Meanwhile, Stevie Rae, with her super red vamp powers, always thought she could handle the stuff she's been keeping from her BFF. But the mysterious, threatening force lurking in the tunnels under the Tulsa Depot is spreading; Stevie Rae won't confide where she's been and what she's doing, and Zoey is beginning to wonder just how much she can trust the person she always thought would have her back. Will their choices destroy them and will darkness consume the House of Night?\n\nAuthor: P. C.
