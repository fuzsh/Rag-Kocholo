        "text": "Zoey and Stevie Ray’s friendship is hanging by a thread but that is the least of their worries right now. Zoey has just banished Kalona and Nefret. Zoey has to re unite the fledglings after Nefrets’s time of terror and Zoey is getting dreams about A-ya that she should let Kalona back into the world but Zoey is fighting against it.\n\nStevie Ray has kept a lot of things from Zoey but she thought she could handle it. Turns out she can’t. She doesn’t want to tell Zoey that she is helping one of Kalona’s sons. Stevie Ray is starting to act weirder around Zoey so Zoey is starting to question Stevie Ray. If you want to see what happens to Zoey and Stevie Ray read this book.\n\nBy: Jupinder P."
