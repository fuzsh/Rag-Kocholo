He took a step closer and I mirrored his movement by taking a step back. 'Which shall it be? Salvation or doom?' Zoey Redbird, now High Priestess of the shattered House of Night, is doing her best to hold everything together while dealing with her beloved, injured grandmother, her moody boyfriend, her secretive best friend, and the aftermath of the victory over her former mentor and a terrible, beautiful dark angel. But Neferet and Kalona have only been banished, not defeated, and everyone knows they're heading straight for the Vampyre High Council, where Zoey must follow. Zoey might be a High Priestess, but she's still just a teenager. And she's the only hope the world has. - Not suitable for younger readers -",
