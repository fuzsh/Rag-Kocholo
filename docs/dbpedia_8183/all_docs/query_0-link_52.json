        "text": "Hi Mike,\n\nI have a question. It’s nothing deep or extremely spiritual, or as you would put it, a bite of t- bone steak. I’ve just been curious about something for awhile that Jesus said to Satan.\n\nWhen Satan tempted Jesus, Jesus told him “it is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God”, but where is it written? Where would Jesus see in the scripture that that is written? Or is this another example of rightly dividing the word of God?\n\nThanks. Your brother in Christ,\n\nB____\n\nHi B____,\n\nChrist was quoting Deuteronomy:\n\nDeu 8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.\n\nNotice that our coming to see this truth is preceded by suffering “hunger.” I think that God has given you that hunger. Now He will “make you to know that you must live by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.” In other words which you can say with Paul:\n\n1Ti 1:15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\n\n… then you will realize just how deep is the truth revealed in Mat 4:4 and in Rev 1:3.\n\nKeep that hunger!\n\nMat 5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n\nMike"
