        "text": "I‚Äôve been thinking about how there‚Äôs a certain sort of break-your-heart-open quiet that middle grade novels do better than any other age/genre of books I know.\n\nHere are four quiet middle grade books I‚Äôve enjoyed this year, in reverse order of their reading:\n\nJourney of Dreams, by Marge Pellegrino\n\nPart historical novel and part adventure story, this story follows Tomasa, her father, and two siblings as they flee their Guatemalan village in the mid-1980s, crossing two borders in an attempt to find and be reunited with Tomasa‚Äôs mother and brother. The later parts of the story also touch on the sanctuary movement in the United States, which was based in Tucson and still echoes through its politics today, but the focus is on Tomasa and her journey ‚Äî which is told, for all its hardships and horrors, with a surprising and lovely gentleness.\n\nThe Brilliant Fall of Gianna Z, by Kate Messner\n\nIn the past decade-and-a-half I‚Äôve thoroughly imprinted on the rhythms of the southwestern fall, but it was lovely to return, through this book, to the more deciduous version of the season, with its crisp air and crunching leaves. Leaves are an issue for Gianna, who has to collect 25 of them for a leaf collection project (and bring up her science grade) or else lose her place in an upcoming cross-country meet. The story isn‚Äôt about the leaf project so much as all Gianna‚Äôs struggling to deal with as she works on the project, especially with watching her grandmother‚Äôs increasingly frequent moments of memory loss. Along the way, the leaves become metaphors for the various people around Gianna, while Gianna herself always feels very real and true.\n\n(I read The Brilliant Fall of Gianna Z over Rosh Hashanah, and Journey of Dreams over Yom Kippur, both of which seemed appropriate, somehow.)\n\nWhen You Reach Me, by Rebecca Stead\n\nMany reviewers have commented on the startling science fiction twist at the heart of this story, and so I‚Äôm not sure everyone would label this a quiet book. Yet to science fiction readers, I suspect the SFnal twist actually won‚Äôt be all that startling ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt to me. Read this book instead for the small realistic details of growing up in New York City in the late 1970s, and for the quiet shifting of protagonist Miranda‚Äôs world as she navigates family and middle school friendships, all of which feel very true and real.\n\nHeart of a Shepherd, by Rosanne Parry\n\nWhen twelve-year-old Brother‚Äôs father leaves to serve in Iraq with his reserve unit, Brother resolves to keep the family‚Äôs ranch running while his father is away. Again it‚Äôs the small details ‚Äî in this case of ranch life and living in a rural ranching community ‚Äî that make this book shine, and that form a backdrop against which Brother struggles to figure out who he is and what his place is within his family and his world.\n\nSimmering on the stove this afternoon before Yom Kippur: a pot of my grandmother‚Äôs meatball fricasee.\n\nAs I shaped the tiny meatballs (they have to be small‚Äìno rushing here), I found myself thinking of my grandmother‚Äôs apartment in Brooklyn, of how when we went to visit we‚Äôd smell cooking smells from all the way down the hall. I loved that smell; it was tied up in the hugs we‚Äôd greet both my grandparents with; and it filled me with longing for potato pancakes and matzo ball soup and whatever else Grandma might have cooked for us. Her cooking was special; nothing Mom cooked, or that I cooked as I got older, ever quite measured up.\n\nI most strong associate Grandma‚Äôs meatball fricassee with holiday dinners, though. I was an extremely picky eater‚Äìsometime before age 10 I decided I simply would not eat anything new, but would only eat things I‚Äôd tried before. This limited my diet considerably, and the strong-smelling gefilte fish that served as an appetizer at family gatherings was definitely right out.\n\nSo Grandma made me fricassee instead. Everyone else liked it too, and cheerfully ate it alongside their gefilte fish‚Äìbut I always knew the fricassee was there for me. Someone else might either forced me to eat that gefilte fish, or simply shrugged and said I could skip it and fill up on the other courses‚Äìit‚Äôs not as if food was ever in short supply when Grandma was around, after all. But as far as Grandma was concerned, none of those other courses mattered. What was important was that there be something there for me, too.\n\nI was important, was what that really meant. Even then, on some level I understood that.\n\nThe summer before my senior year of high school, I had jaw surgery to correct an underbite. Soon afterwards, while my jaw was still wired shut, Grandma brought fricasee out to me, from her apartment to our house on Long Island. Mom and I added water, put it in a blender, and I was able to have fricassee as I recovered.\n\nSometime after Grandma died Mom sent me a copy of her recipe, and I printed it out on an old dot-matrix printer. The first time I tried that recipe‚Äìyes. That taste: it brought me right back to Grandma and her apartment. Even now, as an unpicky eater who will try anything at least once, nothing else I know tastes quite like Grandma‚Äôs fricassee.\n\nIt takes a long time to shape so many small meatballs. I know that now. Grandma was probably a little faster, but even so, she must have spent a lot more time making me fricassee than I appreciated back then.\n\nThe dot matrix printout is fading. I‚Äôll have to copy it again soon. When I come to some parts of the recipe, especially the part that calls for a ‚Äúhalf glass‚Äù of water, I have to think back, because I know Grandma didn‚Äôt mean a half cup‚Äìshe meant a half glass from one of the glasses in her kitchen. Over the years, as I forget just what size those glasses were, as I forget other small details, my recipe slowly diverges from hers.\n\nYet there‚Äôs still that indescribable something in that taste. To say the something is love is a bit more sentimental than I‚Äôm comfortable with. Better, perhaps to say that love is what I feel as I follow the recipe she followed, love and perhaps something of presence, too. Or of standing here in this place and this time, following what came before.\n\nOr perhaps of simple remembrance‚Äìof Grandma, of a child who knew she mattered, and of whatever else there was between us.\n\nFlap copy for Thief Eyes is beginning to show up online. As authors, we often have trouble describing our work, because we‚Äôre too close to it, so it‚Äôs fascinating to me to see how my editor and publisher ‚Äî who have more distance from my books than I do ‚Äî describe them.\n\nSo here‚Äôs a formal introduction to Thief Eyes. üôÇ\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThe latest YA fantasy book from Bones of Faerie author Janni Lee Simner!\n\nAfter her mother mysteriously disappears, sixteen-year-old Haley convinces her father to take her to Iceland, where her mother was last seen. There, amidst the ancient fissures and crevices of that volcanic island, Haley meets gorgeous Ari, a boy with a dangerous side who appoints himself her protector.\n\nWhen Haley picks up a silver coin that entangles her in a spell cast by her ancestor Hallgerd, she discovers that Hallgerd‚Äôs spell and her mother‚Äôs disappearance are connected to a chain of events that could unleash terrifying powers and consume the world. Haley must find a way to contain the growing fires of the spell‚Äîand her growing attraction to Ari.\n\nJanni Lee Simner brings the fierce romance and violent passions of Iceland‚Äôs medieval sagas into this twenty-first-century novel, with spellbinding results.\n\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nSeeing the marketing copy makes me feel like the characters I once wrote letters to on this blog really are all grown up and living away from home now. üôÇ (Just don‚Äôt tell them that I‚Äôve already remodeled their bedrooms and invited new characters to live there, okay? They‚Äôd hate that.)\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the official author bio, modified to talk about rift valleys instead of deadly plants. For those curious about how these things work, while I don‚Äôt write the flap copy, I do mostly write my bios ‚Ä¶ I gather this varies a lot from writer to writer, though.\n\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nJanni Lee Simner first became fascinated with the Icelandic sagas‚Äîand with the woman whose uncle said she had the eyes of a thief‚Äîduring a visit to Iceland. Standing in the rift valley of Thingvellir with a battered copy of Njal‚Äôs Saga in her backpack, she realized the characters she was reading about had walked the same ground. As the wind blew around her, she sat down and wrote the opening scene of Thief Eyes.\n\nJanni lives more than four thousand miles from Iceland in Tucson, Arizona, where the hot, dry desert weather is about as unlike Iceland as one can get and still be on the same planet. She‚Äôs also the author of four books for younger readers and more than thirty short stories. Janni is currently working on the sequel to her first young adult novel, Bones of Faerie.\n\nTo learn more about Janni, visit her Web site at www.simner.com.\n\nDear Antagonist Who Is Still Kinda Creeping Me Out,\n\nSo, seriously, you need to tell me what you plan to do with all these characters who have fallen under your power.\n\nI appreciate that you‚Äôre a clever antagonist, the sort of antagonist who has surely read the Evil Overlord List and knows better than to reveal all her plans to the protagonist. I admire you for that.\n\nBut I‚Äôm not the protagonist. I‚Äôm the writer. And if you don‚Äôt tell me, then none of your plans will ever come to fruition, because I won‚Äôt be able to tell your story. If you want to have a chance here, you need to at least give me a few hints.\n\nI‚Äôll be here in the corner, reworking the section right before we see you again, whenever you‚Äôre ready to talk.\n\nMe\n\nP.S. Yes, I understand that as the antagonist, your chances of succeeding are slim regardless, and I can appreciate that this, too, may make you reluctant to talk to me. But slim chances are better than no chances, right? Besides, I already let you kill someone. Anything could happen.\n\nP.P.S. Well, okay, anything but that. I won‚Äôt let you do that.\n\nA while back someone ‚Äî maybe sarazarr? ‚Äî blogged about the issues that go with being too eager to assign star ratings to books ‚Äî and everything else, for that matter.\n\nOver on goodreads, I‚Äôve been finding the business of trying to figure out how to rate all the different books I read ‚Äî and love and hate in so many different ways ‚Äî more and more problematic. Because several books might all objectively both wind up being, say, four-star books, yet I really might feel very differently from them ‚Äî one could be a piece of perfect two-hour escapism, another could be a flawed-but-ambitious epic that I‚Äôm still working through my feelings about, a third a book that objectively doesn‚Äôt work at all now but that changed my life when I was thirteen ‚Ä¶ after a while, ratings begin not making much sense, at least as a reader who isn‚Äôt also a professional reviewer.\n\nSometimes I‚Äôll put off rating a book because I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it yet, but the past couple books on goodreads, I tried consciously skipping ratings entirely instead, and commenting on the book instead.\n\nAnd what I found was, by not wasting any energy on trying to rate books, I was able to say interesting (to me anyway) things about them instead. Which is really much more satisfying, more likely to start interesting conversations, and possibly even more useful to anyone who happens to skim my list of books.\n\nIt has me tempted to just delete all my past ratings, stop rating books on general principles, and just stick to talking about them instead."
