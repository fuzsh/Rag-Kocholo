Sadly, the House of Night school for vampyres doesnât feature breaks on its curriculum - even for a High Priestess in training and her gang. Plus juggling three guys is no stress reliever, especially when one is a sexy Warrior so into protecting Zoey that heâs sensing her emotions.\n\nWider stresses lurk too, and the dark force in Tulsaâs tunnels is spreading. Could Stevie Rae be responsible for more than a group of misfit fledglings? And Aphroditeâs visions warn Zoey to stay away from the immortal Kalona and his dark allure - but they also show that only Zoey can stop him. Sheâs not exactly keen to meet up, but if Zoey doesnât go to Kalona heâll exact a fiery vengeance on those closest to her. She just has to find the courage to do whatâs necessary, or everything that's important to her will be destroyed.\n\n- Not suitable for younger readers -"
