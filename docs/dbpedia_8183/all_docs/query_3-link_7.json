But the mysterious, threatening force lurking in the tunnels under the Tulsa Depot is spreading; Stevie Rae won't confide where she's been and what she's doing, and Zoey is beginning to wonder just how much she can trust the person she always thought would have her back.\n\nWill their choices destroy them and will darkness consume the House of Night?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nP.C. Cast is the author of the House of Night novels, including Marked, Betrayed, Chosen, and Untamed.\n\nMs. Cast is a #1 New York Times and USA Today Best-Selling author and a member of the Oklahoma Writers Hall of Fame. With more than 20 million copies in print in over 40 countries, her novels have been awarded the prestigious Oklahoma Book Award, YALSA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers, Romantic Times Reviewers’ Choice Award, the Prism, Holt Medallion, Daphne du Maurier, Booksellers’ Best, and the Laurel Wreath.\n\nMs. Cast was born in the Midwest and grew up being shuttled back and forth between Illinois and Oklahoma, which is where she fell in love with Quarter Horses and mythology. After high school she joined the United States Air Force and began public speaking and writing. After her tour in the USAF, she taught high school for 15 years before retiring to write full time. She now lives in Oregon surrounded by beloved cats, dogs, horses, and family.\n\nKristin Cast is a #1 New York Times and #1 USA Today bestselling author who teams with her mother to write the wildly successful HOUSE OF NIGHT series.

C. And Kristin Cast have made an absolutely amazing [YA] series. The visuals offered by this fantastic duo are entertaining and imaginative, with nonstop action.... This is easily a [YA] series that can entertain adults with action, hot Vampyres, true friendship, budding romance, a Loving Goddess, and a twist of the unexpected.” —HowlingGoodBooks.com (5 stars)\n\n“I loved every one of the books in the [House of Night] series. Tempted is my definite favorite…. This book had me ripping through the pages.” —Teen review on Flamingnet.com\n\n“Move over, Stephenie Meyer.” —People on Hunted\n\n“Zoey Redbird's first-person adventures take on added danger and importance in the latest House of Night release. Forced by circumstance to grow up quickly, Zoey's emotional and spiritual evolution is fascinating. The Cast duo breathes life and vibrancy into the characters and makes each one an integral part of the saga. Awesome and unforgettable as always!” —Romantic Times (4.5 stars) on Hunted\n\n“The Cast duo has done it again! These ladies appear to be an unstoppable force within the world of YA literature… Teenage readers will be drawn to Zoey's everyday, angst-riddled life. Not only does she need to save the world, Zoey needs to solve some major vampyre/human boy drama. These stories are surreal, yet shockingly accurate when it comes to teenagers and their lives.” —TeensReadToo.com (5 stars) on Hunted\n\n“This highly addicting series offers a unique twist on the standard vampyre story....These books will have the reader laughing hysterically and sobbing unreservedly -sometimes all at once.” —VOYA on both Marked and Betrayed\n\n“Teenage issues can seem like life or death, but in this haunting series, House of Night, that's really the case. Through Zoey's eyes readers are led into a world that's getting more complicated by the minute, where friends and enemies can switch positions in a heartbeat. The remarkable Cast duo continues to build a world that you won't soon forget!” —Romantic Times (4.5 stars) on Chosen\n\n“Marked is one of the best coming of age stories to come out of Oklahoma since S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders. It teaches about the beauty of being a social outcast, friendship, and finding your own inner spirituality.” —The Beltane Papers\n\n“Readers will identify with many of the characters, especially the protagonist.” —Library Journal on Marked"
