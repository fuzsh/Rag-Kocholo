For the fourth year running performances of Maragall a casa (Maragall at home) will take place in the house-museum of poet Joan Maragall. The play was written by Josep Maria Jaumà in commemoration of the centenary of the poet’s death, in 2011, and the aim of the author was to provide a brief, though vibrant retrospective on the poet’s life.

The piece is based on articles, poems and correspondence by Maragall and is interpreted by a single actor with the aid of a number of off-stage voices in an attempt to form a picture of the private and public figure of the poet. From the dining room of his house in Sant Gervasi, Maragall relates his experiences, his dreams and his ideology.

Under the direction of Dolors Vilasarau, Maragall a casa can be seen on the first and fourth Mondays of every month and tickets will be on sale in the house-museum itself a few hours before the function or reservations may be made by telephone.

Upcoming performances, on the 27th of January, 10th and 24th of February and the 10th and 24th of March will be followed by an opportunity to visit some of the rooms of the house where Maragall lived from 1899 until the year of his death. The ground floor of the house was given over to the National Library of Catalonia for use as a house-museum.
