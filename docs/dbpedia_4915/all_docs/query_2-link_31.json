        "text": "Introduction\n\nPoetry has played, and continues to play, a remarkable role in unleashing the literary potential of a peripheral language—Catalan—whose medieval heyday lapsed into a three-century vernacular hiatus, only to jump-start with the nineteenth-century burst of vitality throwing open Catalan’s road to recovery. The small but mighty language community (which comprises Catalonia proper, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, the French region of Roussillon, and of course, Andorra) is one of uncanny resilience, uplifted by the Catalan people’s love of the word (I had never seen a poster saying Estima la teva llengua / Love your language before visiting Barcelona) and its indissoluble link to life, and add to this an unending shared delight, and pain, in struggling to safeguard both—the word and the common life—against all historical odds. Today Catalan thrives, but goes on with the struggle, like any peripheral language amid the pandemic cultural daltonism that screens so many peoples from global view.\n\nThis selection of twelve Catalan poets is but a tiny spray of breaking surf, a bantam sampling from over a century’s span, culled in a way that is unique and unmatchable: gleaned from the working projects of present-day translators, whose searching beams sweep the poetic seascapes of the past, or spotlight swelling waves of today.\n\nJoan Maragall wrote the hard-hitting poem “Fatherhood” after a small but deadly bomb was tossed into the orchestra seats during the performance of Gioacchino Rossini’s William Tell in Barcelona’s Liceu Opera House on November 7, 1893. Maragall himself attended the performance, accompanied by his wife, parents and sisters; he composed the poem that same evening at home. Departing from tradition in form and content, the poem signals Mr. Maragall’s enthusiasm for Nietzschean vitalism, and the child’s “barbaric laugh” (laughter often earmarks ingenious rebellion in Maragall) in the final image suggests the thin line between destruction and regeneration.\n\nMiquel Martí i Pol’s early poems “You have discovered that just one instant…” and “One day I will die…” appeared in his prize-winning collection Paraules al vent (Words on the Wind) (1954), and coincide with the spiritual crisis and ensuing break with conventional religious faith that comes through in many of his poems dating from the early and mid-1950s. A threefold reconversion, interpellation–faith–gesture, shifts his poetic aim from the deity to his readers, whom he interpellates as peers, redirecting his faith that his voice might live in theirs, giving completion and fruition to the cycle of the poetic act of poet–poem–reader. The Wayne Cox–Lourdes Manyé translations give proof of the tandem’s expertise as translators and scholars of Martí i Pol.\n\nLluís Solà’s “At a standstill…” is an example of what he calls “lightning poems” (poemes llampec), which in contrast to his “river poems” (poemes riu), condense and minimize the elements to produce a maximized burst of expressive energy. The poem invites various readings of exile, where the grain of sand’s solitude augments, as Mr. Solà has remarked, with having lost also the respective solitudes of all the grains surrounding. Composed circa 2000, the poem, in this reader’s eyes, lends itself—strikingly—to the alarming current situation of stranded Mediterranean-area refugees.\n\nThe two tanka by August Bover are fragments of longer tanka compositions published in Terres de llicorella (Slatelands) (2008) in collaboration with photographer Toni Vidal. Mr. Bover has commented on how he seeks to lyricize the landscapes of Catalonia’s “South” and its distinctive geography—including the well-known wine country, El Priorat—following other Catalan geographies of literary fame such as Jacint Verdaguer’s Pyrenees and Joan Alcover’s Serra de Tramuntana on the island of Mallorca; serving up, as he puts it, southern Catalan “life in draughts of thirty-one syllables,” which are precisely and adroitly recreated in English tanka by poet and translator Kristine Doll.\n\nThe Enric Casasses poem alludes in its title to a popular sardana by prolific composer Pep Ventura (1817–1875), “La donzella de la costa” (“The Damsel On the Shore”), which was in turn spun from the older traditional tune “A la vora de la mar” (“At the Seashore”) in which a damsel boards a ship at a mariner’s behest, not aware that he is the king of England. The poem’s incisive repetition follows the structure of Ventura’s sardana (hence, “To the Tune of…”), and Casasses’ own performance of the poem delights and penetrates in a Sekou Sundiata sort of way. The crossroads theme of this “Road Not Taken” update is autobiographical.\n\nTònia Passola has remarked that what is most important about the road are the steps, and her steps in the summer of 1981 to the Galtaji Temple, with Octavio Paz’s The Monkey Grammarian as her guide, are imprinted indelibly in her poem “Galta”—the poem giving new life to the journey giving new life. More than a visit, “in the company not only of a watching sun,” writes Passola, “but also the warm silence of the pilgrims, the sparkling mischievousness of the monkeys, the running of the children, the joy,” all this, Passola’s answer to Prufrock is masterfully rendered into English by poet and translator Anna Crowe.\n\nThe poem “Twelfth Sonnet” is the concluding sonnet in Hores (Hours), written by Teresa d’Arenys at Can Ruti Hospital between December 18, 2005 and May 7, 2006. Her poetry on the death of loved ones goes back to her early youth, when she wrote her first serious poem following the passing at age twelve of a childhood friend; and her translations of Rilke (1997) were prompted by the passing of her adolescent mentors, writers Fèlix Cucurull and Lluís Ferran de Pol, both natives of her home town Arenys de Mar; to Cucurull, the poet would also dedicate another of the Hores sonnets. Ms. D’Arenys first wrote sonnets while she was studying at university and in contact with poet J. V. Foix. In a sonnet dedicated to her mother, we read the poignant words: “It was an ecstasy and a bursting, and we were the landscape, mother.” Poet and translator Kristine Doll brilliantly recreates the subtle, loving pathos of “Twelfth Sonnet.”\n\nThe short Maria-Mercè Marçal poems from the section “Turning” (Bruixa de dol, 1979) (Witch in Mourning) evince the poet’s prodigious art of compacting powerful, playful, verbal melody and imagery, striking an alchemist’s balance between the mundane and the magical, the cerebral and the sensual. Alluding to the feminist clarion call of the seventies, “A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,” Marçal sings the bittersweet solitude of swimming uncharted waters, often against mainstream currents. “Nothing will be taken from you…” appeared in Raó del cos (The Body’s Reason) (2000), a posthumous collection edited by writer and literary activist Lluïsa Julià. Maria-Mercè Marçal is widely regarded as one of contemporary Catalonia’s most outstanding poetic voices. Translator Kathleen McNerney captures and releases on target the full force of Marçal.\n\nSílvia Aymerich-Lemos, in “Alnus glutinosa” and “Arnica montana,” from her prize-winning collection Balsàmiques (forthcoming) (Balms), couples an intriguing floral taxonomy with engaging, first, Wisława Szymborska, then Bob Marley and Maya Angelou in soul-searching dialogue. Both the rich imagery and the lyricism of her original Catalan are exquisitely rendered into English in her translations accomplished with friend and collaborator Kathleen McNerney, who disavows significant complicity. Ms. Aymerich-Lemos’s French translations of these same poems appeared in the Ottawa literary magazine Mot Dit 8, 2016:10–11.\n\nJosep Checa’s “Awkwardly, you try some nights…” appears in his collection La barberia (The Barber’s) (2016). Alone while others sleep, the poet fathoms his calling and craft, and with a trace of a wink to Seamus Heaney’s “Digging,” both breaks and bonds with the family past, at once like and unlike Grandpa before—and the pinches of tobacco are now the skins of words. On the urgency of the poet’s task Checa writes: “The configuring of today’s world, on the whole, works against poetry, but there are always fissures, and there is a backdrop of emptiness and disquiet that poetry can put right.”\n\nBlanca Llum Vidal’s “Home” appeared in her collection of prose poems, Homes i ocells (Men and Birds) (2012). Critic Sebastià Perelló has remarked how in her poetry “darkness is at work, wagoning in the light that is to lift it,” and this she does starkly, disturbingly, and lovingly. In her more recent collection Punyetera flor (Damn Flower) (2014), poems are fruits of evil that heal and nourish, seeding complacency with fruitful intrusion. She notes how her job as a social worker, dealing with the mentally challenged, provides the needed human contact that compels her to write. Blanca Llum Vidal’s rhythmic layering and cunning wordplay are artfully recreated by translator Megan Berkobien.\n\nMarc Rovira’s “Family Tree,” from his prize-winning collection Els ocells de la llum (Birds of Light) (2015), features an epigraph from the work of pre-Renaissance humanist writer and translator Bernat Metge (c. 1340–1413). The epigraph apparently alludes to Mr. Rovira’s debt to, but departure from, influential poet Gabriel Ferrater (1922–1972), from whom the collection’s title is taken. Rovira has also spoken of his debt to literary giant Josep Carner (1884–1970) and the Mallorcan Spanish-language poet Miguel Ángel Velasco (1963–2010). On translating Rovira, poet and translator María Cristina Hall notes: “Rovira breaks words apart to create polysemy and disjoint verses,” whereby “the broken words force the reader to interpretation, as the words’ components have been revitalized.” Hall’s recreation of these breaks is poetry translation at its best.\n\nYes, Catalan poetry thrives, against all odds, in delight and in pain, giving voice, in living word, to all of this, all this and more. . .\n\nRonald Puppo\n\nCo-Coordinator for Catalan translations\n\nJoan Maragall\n\nTranslated from Catalan by Ronald Puppo\n\nFatherhood\n\nOn coming home from the Liceu Opera House the night of 7 November 1893.\n\nFurious, hate breaks out on the earth,\n\nfrom heads on twisted necks blood pours,\n\nand nerves of steel are advised\n\nwhen off to soirées or to war.\n\nWith each fatal attack — we turn and shudder:\n\ncruelty advances — fear moves back:\n\ndividing the world between them…\n\nEyeing the suckling child — and sighing mother,\n\nthe father knits a brow.\n\nBut the innocent child,\n\nnow sated, releases the drained breast,\n\ngazes at him — then at her,\n\nand lets go a barbaric laugh.\n\nPaternal\n\nTornant del Liceu en la nit del 7 de novembre de 1893.\n\nFurient va esclatant l’odi per la terra,\n\nregalen sang les coll-torçades testes,\n\ni cal anar a les festes\n\namb pit ben esforçat, com a la guerra.\n\nA cada esclat mortal — la gent trèmola es gira:\n\nla crueltat que avança, — la por que s’enretira,\n\nse van partint el món…\n\nMirant al fill que mama, — a la mare que sospira,\n\nel pare

madness of loving, now\n\nthat your body is still agile, and smash\n\nthe amphora that held the ancient scent\n\nto inhale all at once\n\nits overwhelming intensity.\n\nAnd who knows after this test\n\nwhether to live or to die.\n\nHeu esbrinat que en un instant només…\n\nHeu esbrinat que en un instant només\n\npot estimar-se tant com en tota una vida.\n\nHeu esbrinat que el goig és com una

the gait of those men\n\nI don’t recognize yet love.\n\nOne day I will die,\n\nand the afternoon will still shine\n\nin the eyes of the woman\n\nwho leans over to kiss me,\n\nin the timeless music\n\nof any old tune,\n\nor even in the most distinct\n\nand personal of objects,\n\nor perhaps in my verses.\n\nTell me what miracle\n\nmakes the afternoon so sweet\n\nand at the same time so intense,\n\nand to what meadow or cloud\n\ndo I owe this delight,\n\nbecause I feel so alive\n\nin the things that surround me\n\nand know that someone, in time,\n\nwill honor my memory.\n\nUn dia

it’s a house of breaking down to suffer, a suffering that longs to low, to row at love, to row the sea of swollen sea and love tomorrow, a space knotted to time, making space of time in knots, and the cutting knot where one fights who fights with every fight, an abyss that bottoms out in an abyss that’s shoring up the next abyss and a post where one…\n\nCasa\n\nUna escala amb els graons i un

que és un espai nuat al temps que fa del temps l’espai amb nus i el nus tallant on hi ha qui lluita i qui s’hi lluita amb cada lluita, que és un abisme al capdavall d’un altre abisme amb un abisme

She is the author of several books of poetry: Aor (winner of the Amadeu Oller Prize in 1976), Onada (1980), Murmuris (1986), Tuareg: Cants d’amor i de guerra de l’Ahaggar (winner of the Premi Cadaqués a Quima Jaume in 2000), Hores (2008) and Versos de vi novell (awarded the Premi de Poesia La Selva del Camp in 2009). Reflected in the Saharan poems are her extensive travels in North Africa, especially among the Amazighs, whose struggle she voices. Her novel, El quadern d’Agnès Solà (2001), explores alternative religious encounters and the quest for self and place. Bertran’s translations include Rèquiems (1997) by Rainer Maria Rilke.\n\nSílvia Aymerich-Lemos, born in Barcelona, trained in several languages and literatures, with a degree in biology, brings a diversified background to her writing. Her prize-winning poetry has appeared in several anthologies and she has contributed self-translations into French in Forum des Écrivaines et des Écrivains (1995), Le Pan del Muses (2012), and Mot Dit (2016); and into English in Malpaís Review (2013) and The Tree of Peace Turns Green (2016). Her early poetic work, La meva Europa, won the Amadeu Oller Prize in 1985, and her prose narrative Berlin Zoo the Cassà de la Selva Prize in 1990. A tireless cross-cultural literary activist and researcher, Aymerich conducted a study on LabLit and gender in Catalan literature under the patronage of the Department of Culture (2012–13), and is the founder of Multiple Versions, a multi-language project of cooperative translations among contemporary authors.\n\nAugust Bover, born in 1949 in Barcelona, is Emeritus Professor of Catalan Literature at the Universitat de Barcelona, and has been visiting professor at several European universities and the University of California at Berkeley. He has also served as co-director (1995–2009) of Catalan Review. As a poet, Bover often works with painters, plastic artists, photographers and musicians. Along with soprano and cellist Eulàlia Ara, Bover created El Taller Vora Mar (2013), a production of poetry-music programs such as Cloc! i altres sons. His poems—translated into English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish—appear in several anthologies, and he is the author of En pèlag d’amor (1999), L’hivern sota el Cadí (2001), Mojave (2006), Terres de llicorella (2008), and Cloc! (2011). In prose, he published the diary Dotze llunes a Saskatchewan (2013).\n\nEnric Casasses, born in 1951 in Barcelona, renowned self-styled performance poet and troubadour, has published more than twenty-five collections of poetry, as well as translations from English, French and Italian (notably, William Blake, Max Jacob and Giordano Bruno), essays, plays, and fresh-take anthologies. Drawing from an uncanny spectrum of sources ranging from medieval and surrealist to Baroque and Beat, his works distill a savvy blend of colloquial and canonic. Translated into Galician, English, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian, Casasses’ poetry has enjoyed wide popularity and garnered numerous awards, including Catalonia’s 2012 Premi Nacional de Literatura.\n\nJosep Checa, born in 1962 in Caldes de Montbui, began working in a textile factory at age sixteen while attending evening classes to earn his high school degree. He won his first poetry prize in his hometown at age fifteen. He has since published a dozen poetry collections and won several prestigious awards, counterpointing his bread-and-butter job as a farmer with fathering two children and engaging in his vocation as poet and steadfast literary activist. His wife, Esther Obradors, collaborates as his prepublication critic and illustrator. Checa’s poems frequently depict and explore the power of the commonplace in rural and small-town settings, striking and spotlighting hidden niches of self and world, past and present.\n\nJoan Maragall (1860–1911), born in Barcelona, holds an eminent place in the pantheon of Catalan letters not only for his groundbreaking mix of tradition and innovation in poetic theme and form, but also for his prominent role as intellectuel engagé penning bold inquiry into the manifold social and spiritual dislocation that shook the foundations of turn-of-the-century Catalan and Spanish society; not surprisingly, his poetry and essays have wielded enormous influence on subsequent generations. Tangentially, his essays on language and poetry open a critical window on an intriguing particular–universal synthesis from the perspective of Catalan, the peripheral language and culture, from and to which, he has given resounding voice.\n\nMaria-Mercè Marçal (1952–1998), born in Barcelona, studied philology at the Universitat de Barcelona and taught Catalan and literature at the Institut Rubió i Ors in Barcelona. She co-founded the publishing house Llibres del Mall in 1973, and in 1976 she won the Carles Riba prize for her book of poetry, Cau de llunes. Published in numerous poetry journals, her verses have been sung by leading voices of the Nova Cançó such as Marina Rossell, Ramon Muntaner, and Maria del Mar Bonet. Marçal sat on juries of poetry prizes and penned critical articles on other poets, including Felícia Fuster, Clementina Arderiu, and Rosa Leveroni. The epigraph from Cau de llunes points to her sociopolitical stance: A l’atzar agraeixo tres dons: haver nascut dona / de classe baixa i nació oprimida / i el tèrbol atzur de ser tres voltes rebel (I owe three gifts to hazard: to be born woman / of working class and oppressed nation / and the turbid azure of being thrice rebel). She also wrote short stories and a novel, La passió segons Renée Vivien, based on the biography and work of Pauline Mary Tarn (1877–1909).\n\nMiquel Martí i Pol (1929–2003) of Roda de Ter is the most widely read poet in contemporary Catalan literature. His collected works contain over 1,600 pages of poetry, twenty-four volumes of translations, nine books of essays and stories, and several books for children. He collaborated with renowned painter Joan Miró (1893–1983), and before the onset of multiple sclerosis, performed as a folk singer who wrote lyrics and poetry recorded on over forty CDs by leading Spanish and Catalan musicians. Martí i Pol was awarded the Premi d’Honor de les Lletres Catalanes in 1991, the most prestigious literary prize in Catalan literature, and in 1992 was awarded Spain’s highest literary honor: the Medalla de Oro al Mérito en las Bellas Artes. In 2000, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nTònia Passola, born in Barcelona in 1952, took her degree in Art History at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, and teaches Catalan language and literature in secondary school. She is the author of Cel rebel (winner of the Premi Cadaqués a Rosa Leveroni in 2000), La sensualitat del silenci (winner of the Premi Vicent Andrés Estellés in 2001), Bressol (2005), L´horitzó que no hi és (2009) and Margelle d´étoiles (2013, bilingual French-Catalan edition published by L’Harmattan). Passola’s work takes the form of a personal diary. Using memory, imagination and dream, she transcends the limitations of language and creates an extraordinary poetic world. Her poems have been translated into Albanian, Dutch, English, French, Greek, Italian and Spanish. In 2014 she was honored with the Nënë Terezë award in the city of Gjakova in the Republic of Kosovo, and in 2015, the Alexander the Great award on the Greek island of Salamis.\n\nMarc Rovira, born in Barcelona in 1989, studied Catalan and Hispanic literatures and literary theory at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and spent a year abroad at the Université Paris–Sorbonne. He was only twenty years old when awarded the Amadeu Oller Prize in 2009 for his first book of poems, and his subsequent collection Els ocells de la llum won the 2014 Premi de Poesia Les Talúries. As a translator, Rovira has published more than a dozen of Stéphane Mallarmé’s poems into Catalan, part of a larger project of his devoted to translating into Catalan the complete poetic works of Mallarmé.\n\nLluís Solà, born in Vic in 1940, is a poet, playwright, essayist, stage director, editor, and translator. He is founding director of the Centre d’Osona de l’Institut del Teatre and has directed works by Joan Brossa, August Strindberg, Aeschylus, Zeami and others, as well as stage performances of poetry. Solà’s award-winning poetry is collected in the one-thousand-page volume Poesia completa (2016), and his recently published Llibertat i sentit: reflexions sobre la condició humana (2017) serves up rich inquiry into the indispensable place of the arts in the quest for human freedom. As a translator, Solà has published among others works by Franz Kafka, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Peter Handke, Fernando Pessoa, Samuel Beckett, Giuseppe Ungaretti, and Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nBlanca Llum Vidal, despite her Barcelonan roots, grew up in Casserres. Her work—dizzying, voracious, animal-like—incorporates the vocabulary of Catalan mountains and Mallorcan seascapes. She has published several poetry collections, including La cabra que hi havia (Documenta Balear, 2009), Nosaltres i tu (Lleonard Muntaner, 2011), Homes i ocells (Club Editor, 2012), Punyetera flor (LaBreu 2014), and Maripasoula: Crònica d’un viatge a la Guaiana Francesa (Tushita Edicions, 2015).\n\nTRANSLATORS\n\nSílvia Aymerich-Lemos is a poet, novelist, translator, and cross-cultural literary activist.
