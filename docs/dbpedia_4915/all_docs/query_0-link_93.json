        "text": "Francesc Raventós\n\nFirst President of the Executive Committee of the Barcelona Strategic Plan 2000\n\nIn 1987, when Pasqual Maragall was the mayor of Barcelona, a strategic plan was developed for the city. How did it come about?\n\nIn October 1986, Barcelona was nominated the site of the Olympic Games, and municipal elections were held eight months later. Barcelona City Council was won by the list headed by Pasqual Maragall. I was on the list too, and he appointed me Deputy Mayor of Organisation and the Economy. Everyone was enthusiastic about holding the 1992 Olympic Games and the investments that would be made, but there were also fears of paralysis after the Games. The constant question was: “And what about the next day?”"
