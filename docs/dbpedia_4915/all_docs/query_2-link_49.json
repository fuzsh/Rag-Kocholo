        "text": "The mountains\n\nAt the hour of sunset,\n\ndrinking at the fountain’s freshet,\n\nI savoured the secrets\n\nof the mysterious earth.\n\nIn the spring’s inner depths\n\nI saw the virgin water\n\nflower from its dark birthplace\n\nto delight my mouth,\n\nand it entered deep into my breast…\n\nAnd with its clear streamlets\n\npierced me then and there\n\nwith a sweet wisdom.\n\nWhen I arose and looked about,\n\nthe mountain, woods and meadow\n\nseemed different to me:\n\neverything seemed other than it was.\n\nIn the sky’s lovely dying\n\nthere began to shine,\n\namong the crimsoned cloudbanks,\n\nthe white first quarter of the new moon.\n\nAll the world seemed in flower\n\nand I was its soul.\n\nI, the fragrant soul of the meadow,\n\neager to flower and be cut down.\n\nI, the peaceful soul of the flock\n\nwith tinkling bells, half-hidden in the dell.\n\nI, the soul of the woods that murmur\n\nlike the sea, far off on the horizon.\n\nAnd also was I the willow’s soul\n\nthat blesses every font with its clear shade.\n\nI, the dell’s deep soul\n\nwhere mists arise and wake.\n\nAnd the torrent’s restless soul\n\nthat shrieks in shining waterfall.\n\nI was the blue soul of the pond\n\nthat cons the stranger with an alien eye.\n\nI, the soul of the wind that moves all things\n\nand the lowliness of an unfurling flower.\n\nI was the height of mountain crests…\n\nThe clouds caressed me slowly\n\nand in the cloudbank’s overwhelming love,\n\nmy soul serene was forged.\n\nI felt the wild joy of the fountains,\n\nthe gift of snowpacks, surging in my breast\n\nand, in the horizon’s huge unrest,\n\nI felt the tempest’s vast repose.\n\nAnd when the heavens opened round me\n\nand the sun smiled on my green plain,\n\npeople, from afar, stayed the whole day\n\ngazing upon my sovereign beauty.\n\nBut I, quite overcome with troubled longings\n\nof the sea and mountains,\n\nrose firmly to offer heaven\n\nall that was pent-up in my womb and breasts."
