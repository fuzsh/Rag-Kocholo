        "text": "Catalan is spoken by approximately 10 million people. The Catalan language area spans four separate countries: Spain, France, Italy, and Andorra. Its main city is Barcelona. In Spain, the Catalan-speaking areas are Catalunya, País Valencià, Illes Balears (Mallorca, Menorca and Eivissa), and the “franja” of Aragó bordering Catalunya; in France, it is the Rosselló-Catalunya Nord; in Italy, the city of l’Alguer in Sardinia. Catalan is also the official language of Andorra, a tiny country in the Pyrenees.\n\nDespite the repressive policies of the Spanish and French states, Catalan has maintained a high cultural prestige since the Middle Ages and has played a central role in the political re-emergence of Catalonia as “a nation without, or in search of, a state.”\n\nCatalan literature constitutes an extraordinary cultural event that, for multiple reasons, has remained marginal amidst the great European literary traditions. Some prominent writers are Ramon Llull, Ausiàs March, Bernat Metge, Joan Maragall, Josep Pla, Mercè Rodoreda, and Quim Monzó. The Catalan areas have also produced a prominent tradition of art, architecture, and urbanism. Some outstanding figures, among many others, are architect Antoni Gaudí and painters Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí, and Antoni Tàpies."
