        "text": "Limited to 77 copies, of which this is one of 70 numbered copies. A fine copy in fine slipcase. Text in Catalan and English. From the colophon: It was in summer in 1893 that Catalan poet Joan Maragall wrote \"The Cow Gone Blind\". As the story goes, there was a cow by the name of Bonica (pretty one), blind in one eye because a cloudy film had formed over it. As she approached a freshly sown field one day, a herdboy named Janot from the Pau Llebre farmhouse, attempting to dissuade her, threw a rock with such pitiful aim that it struck her good eye, leaving her blind.\n\nOne afternoon during a summer stay in the town of Sant Joan de les Abadesses, the poet and his family took a stroll out to the spring known as Covilar. It was there that they came upon the cow, accompanied by the boy, who explained the cause of the animal's blindness. No sooner had the family returned to their mountain lodgings that Maragall shut himself in his study to write. When he came out again later, the poem was in his hand.\n\nThis edition of \"The Cow Gone Blind\" is illustrated and printed by Elies Plana. Translated into English from the Catalan by Ronald Puppo. The reduction linocut printed on Super Alfa paper by Casa Guarro. Bound by Georgina Aspa. The poem was set in Impressum type."
