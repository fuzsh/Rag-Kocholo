        "text": "The bust of 1913 was dedicated to the memory of Joan Maragall (Barcelona, ​​1860-1911), who died a year and a half before and a really popular figure. For this reason, Illustration Catalana prompted this time a popular subscription which became more frequent contributions from 10 pesetas (made by Francesc Matheu, Miguel de los Santos Oliver, Angel Guimerà, Joaquim Ruyra, Narcís Oller, Gustau Gili, Victor Catalan, Enric Prat de Riba, Count Guell ...), a large participation of Catalan residents in Buenos Aires and Havana, and also the financial support of the City (247 pesetas) and the Council (494).\n\nThe sculpture was again Eusebi Arnau, while the pedestal made him Montaner. The inauguration took place on May 4, 1913 and was in charge of the architect Bonaventura Bassegoda, until then an outside party personality Floral Games. It was a round year as Manuel Folch i Torres, Josep Maria de Sagarra and Jaume Bofill i Mates won awards of poetic call. The outbreak of the First World War ended the custom of placing a bust every May in the Parque de la Ciutadella."
