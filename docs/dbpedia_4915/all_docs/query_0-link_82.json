        "text": "Catalan Narrative 1875–2015 neither outlines a one-hundred-forty-year canonical survey, nor judges the current state of Catalan literature; it rather proposes an eclectic collection of essays with a common underlying thread: proving that \"a cultural studies approach, mobilizing intertextual, interdisciplinary, and translation-related perspectives and methodologies, has much to offer to literary studies\" (1). In short, this compilation of articles pinpoints that multidimensional critical approaches to Catalan literature are much more fruitful and enriching than traditional or chronological ones; because while these are usually reduced to historical perspectives, the ones included in this collection prove the wide variety of interpretative paths that can be taken to describe and understand historical or literary periods. Therefore, this selection of essays accomplishes two main goals: on the one hand, it underscores interdisciplinary approaches as the most productive and insightful, on the other, it displays the most current interpretative trends in Catalan Studies. [End Page 728]\n\nDespite, or perhaps by lacking an obvious structure, Catalan Narrative 1875–2015 becomes an innovative enlightening piece because it adopts a wide variety of approaches to Catalan literary production. Some articles focus on reviewing well-established artistic and cultural movements through new theoretical perspectives. In this group, the work of Joan Ramon Resina, Josep Murgades, Enric Bou, Jordi Larios, and Elisa Martí stands out. These essays either revisit single canonical authors to unravel new compelling re-interpretations or apply more contemporary theoretical frameworks to traditional literary movements in Catalonia. For instance, the contributions of Larios and Martí comprehensively provide new understandings on the writings of Caterina Albert (Víctor Català) and Narcís Oller, respectively. The other essays interpret the Catalan literary tradition through a wide variety of prisms: by adopting an existentialist perspective, Resina's writing observes the representation of death and color on five canonical authors—Joan Maragall, Salvador Espriu, Josep Pla, Pere Quart and Mercè Rodoreda. Murgades's dissertation deconstructs the Noucentisme by positing the ideas of anagogy and analogy as crucial elements in the development of this artistic movement. Finally, in order to reflect on issues of cultural memory, Bou's paper employs the concept of picnolepsy (momentary absences of consciousness) in the literary work of Josep Carner, Marta Rojals and Joan Todó.\n\nHowever, this variousness of criticisms does not end in revisiting the canon; it also grounds on multiple components: the prevalence of intertextuality, the relevance of translation-related research, and the productivity of interdisciplinary work. For instance, Montserrat Lunati's investigation brings to the fore the intertextual connections between two different authors, the novelist Mercé Rodoreda and the poet Maria-Mercè Marçal; in contrast, Dominic Keown's article analyzes the conceptualization of Catalonia as a nation by establishing an intertextual dialogue between the early novels of Albert Sánchez Piñol with \"the alien but more global configuration of British expansionism\" (108). Both essays prove that intertextuality is a fruitful methodological tool for literary and cultural studies. Along the same lines, other works included in the collection delve into the construction of national identity adopting different methodological strategies. The expositions of P. Louise Johnson and Mario Santana re-examine two key authors—Guillem Viladot and Jaume Cabré, respectively—in order to point out the simplistic and reductive creation of historical discourse and the role of objects in the transmission of historical memory. On the other hand, Kathryn Crameri's piece explores how the idea of the Catalan national family is quintessential in the conceptualization of national sentiments by observing a group of novels published between 2008 and 2012, including those by authors such as Alfred Bosch, Víctor Jurado Riba, Jaume Clotet, David de Montserrat, and Albert Sánchez Piñol.\n\nFinally, the last group of essays in Catalan Narrative 1875–2015 are those in which interdisciplinary investigation is central. Here, the work of Helena Buffery and Alan Yates stands out because both articles show how influential translation studies and other translation-inflected methodologies have become in cultural and literary studies..."
