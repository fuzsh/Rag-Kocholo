        "text": "Here is a poem from Joan Maragall in which he goes in for extreme nature-loving, transporting himself into physical raptures of pleasure upon finding a yellow broom tree (ginesta) while hiking up a hill. The yellow broom is considered a nationalist symbol by Catalan nationaists, so this probably goes a long way towards explaining the poet’s unbridled enthusiasm for the tree. Let’s assume so at any rate, rather than any one of the more bizarre possible explanations…\n\nLA GINESTA\n\nJoan Maragall\n\nLa ginesta altre vegada,\n\nla ginesta amb tanta olor,\n\nés la meva enamorada\n\nque ve al temps de la calor.\n\nPer a fer-li una abraçada\n\nhe pujat dalt del serrat:\n\nde la primera besada\n\nm’ha deixat tot perfumat.\n\nFeia un vent que enarborava,\n\nfeia un sol molt resplendent:\n\nla ginesta es regirava\n\nfuriosa al sol rient.\n\nJo la prenc per la cintura:\n\nla tisora va en renou\n\ndesflorant tanta hermosura\n\nfins que el cor me n’ha dit prou.\n\nAmb un vimet que creixia\n\ninnocent a vora seu\n\nhe lligat la dolça aimia\n\nben estreta en un pom breu.\n\nQuan l’he tinguda lligada\n\nm’he girat de cara al mar…\n\nM’he girat al mar de cara,\n\nque brillava com cristall;\n\nhe aixecat el pom enlaire\n\ni he arrencat a córrer avall.\n\nFrom <http://lletra.uoc.edu/especials/folch/maragall.htm>\n\nBu whatever the motivation, the poem describes the poet climbing a hill to meet his lover, enjoying her scent, putting his arms around her and kissing her, tying a bouquet of the yellow flowers with a piece of ivy, turning to look at a view of the sea, and then lifting it in the air to run back down the hill. And the lover is not a girl, it is the broom tree and its yellow flowers.\n\nNature can indeed have truly inspirational powers.\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nA poem for this Sunday or any Sunday by Joan Maragall, the great Catalan poet from the turn of the 20th century. Sunday being the day when you can take a deep breath and appreciate the beauty of the world, realise your happiness and throw off the cares of the working week.\n\n“DIUMENGE”\n\nde Joan Maragall\n\nQui no tinga a la finestra\n\ndos testos de flors germans,\n\nun aucell dins d’una gàbia,\n\ni un cor enamorat,\n\nno sap lo que és benaurança\n\nni podrà saber-ho mai.\n\nI a fe us dic que es bella cosa\n\nel diumenge, al desvetlla’s\n\nveure en les flors la rosada,\n\nsentir l’aucell refilar\n\ni per gaudir-lo amb l’aimia,\n\nun jorn de festa al davant:\n\nAmb l’aimia que us espera\n\nabocada al finestral\n\namb el vestit dels diumenges\n\nque es aquell de colors clars.\n\nJoan Maragall\n\nFrom <http://elglobosblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/diumenge.html&gt;\n\nThis is a poem which celebrates the simple pleasures of awaking on a Sunday with flowers by the window, a bird singing in the gables and a heart full of love. This is indeed enough to bestow happiness, at least for the day when cares can be set aside. The first stanza sets out this scenario as a kind of theoretical set of conditions for happiness, saying that whoever can’t experience this must not be happy.\n\nIn the second stanza a very similar scenario is played out but this time the poet is at the center of the action – he is talking from personal experience and he adds more details – the waking, the dew on the flowers, the bird singing, and his lover alongside him leaning against the window – and they are wearing their bright Sunday best clothes, ready to take their happiness out into the world.\n\nA poem of contentment and optimism indeed.\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nHere is a poem of place by Joan Maragall, and it certainly makes the reader want to visit it. La Fageda d’En Jorda is a site of outstanding natural beauty, a beech forest growing out of an old volcanic lava flow, in an area of long-standing volcanic activity in the Catalan province of Girona, 100 or so miles north-east of Barcelona. Since the poem was written well over 100 years ago, it must have had even more of an unspoilt charm when visited by Maragall.\n\nLA FAGEDA D’EN JORDÀ\n\nSaps on és la fageda d’en Jordà ?\n\nSi vas pels volts d’Olot, amunt del pla,\n\ntrobaràs un indret verd i pregon\n\ncom mai més n’hagis trobat al món:\n\nun verd com d’aigua endins, pregon i clar;\n\nel verd de la fageda d’en Jordà.\n\nEl caminant, quan entra en aquest lloc,\n\ncomença a caminar-hi poc a poc;\n\ncompta els seus passos en la gran quietud\n\ns’atura, i no sent res, i està perdut.\n\nLi agafa un dolç oblit de tot el món\n\nen el silenci d’aquell lloc pregon,\n\ni no pensa en sortir o hi pensa en va:\n\nés pres de la fageda d’en Jordà,\n\npresoner del silenci i la verdor.\n\nOh companyia! Oh deslliurant presó!\n\nFrom <http://lletra.uoc.edu/especials/folch/maragall.htm&gt;\n\nThe poem starts with a question, “Do you know where id the Fageda d’en Jorda”, perhaps not altogether a rhetorical question. But it also gives a natural lead-in to the poem’s description of the place, first situating it on the plain above the city of Olot. The poet then describes it as a green and attractive place, like nowhere else in the world. A place of greenery, but also with clear water.\n\nThe poet then describes how the place draws in the visitor, inciting to walk about and explore, but so caught up in the beauty and the atmosphere that he will soon get lost. But it doesn’t matter, because the visitor is soothed by the silence and calm of the place, such that he may never consider leaving. In fact the visitor can easily become a prisoner of the silence and greenery of this enchanting place. A sweet prison indeed.\n\nPut this on the list for your next visit to Catalunya (I missed it when I lived there some years ago).\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nHere is a poem in Catalan from Joan Maragall, which captures a moment of great beauty and tenderness as the poet gives flowers to his lover. The delicate language, the capturing of subtle interactions between the lovers around the flowers and their reaction to them, make this poem a striking and captivating expression of a moment of love. However, if I have interpreted it correctly, there is a sting in the tail in the final line, which might change the whole interpretation of what goes before. This surprise adds another dimension and additional depth to the poem as a whole.\n\nSending flowers, by Joan Maragall…. Enjoy\n\nENVIANT FLORS\n\nVeig flors, i penso en tu. Faré portar-les\n\na tu pel dolç camí de cada dia;\n\nque omplin d’aromes davant meu la via,\n\ndesprés a vora teu vindré a olorar-les.\n\nGrat ens serà tenir-les davant nostre,\n\na l’hora de parlar de l’amor meu:\n\nvers el gerro florit baixaré el rostre,\n\ntot alçant els meus ulls al somrís teu.\n\nTu triaràs una poncella encesa,\n\nal damunt del teu pit la clavaràs,\n\ni, amb moviment de cígnia bellesa,\n\narquejant el teu coll l’oloraràs.\n\nAl sentir l’alè tebi amb què la mulles,\n\nal frec constant del teu bell rostre ardent,\n\nla rosa adreçarà totes ses fulles\n\ni es badarà desesperadament.\n\nI encara em mig riuràs; mes quan me veges\n\nde tu a la flor, mentres jugueu aixís,\n\nmoure l’esguard, guspirejant d’enveges,\n\nfugirà en sec ton confiat somrís.\n\nFrom <http://perso.wanadoo.es/lipmic/Poecat/maragall.htm#Enviant flors>\n\nThe poem dives into its subject and its creation of mood in the first few words – I see flowers and think of you. And there follows an accumulating collection of association between the flowers, their attributes and the poet’s lover. The scents and colours of the flowers fill the poets senses and make every moment heady with love and passion, all his everyday experiences become expressions of love, “pel dolc cami de cada dia;” And then when he meets her and presents her with the flowers, the poem describes a kind of courtship dance, with first he, and then she lowering their face, raising their eyes, smelling the flowers and each other, totally lost in the moment and in each other.\n\nAnd then there is the kick in the tail, when the poet’s lover seems to wake up, to become aware that he is totally besotted with her and is using the flowers to draw her in – and in the final line the magic moment of harmony and togetherness disappears, as her smile fades away and she becomes dry and stiff.\n\nWith one line the whole mood of what has gone before is altered. Finally, the flowers have not served their purpose.\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nHere is a rather stoically pessimistic poem from Catalan poet Joan Maragall on the nature of love. I hope it does not reflect his real experience.\n\nThe poem is topped and tailed by the same two lines repeated, which gives a nice symmetry to the overall piece, but also seems to disqualify the possibility of evolution towards a more positive view of love. It is as if the poet is stuck with the experience of nourishing his love with absence, suffering, sighs, tears, and adoration from afar. He seems to be creating an ideal vision of his loved one which would be doomed to disappointment if he was physically with his lover.\n\nNodreix l’amor\n\n(Joan Maragall )\n\nNodreix l’amor de pensaments i absència,\n\ni així traurà meravellosa flor;\n\nmenysprea el pas de tota complacència\n\nque no et vinga per via del dolor.\n\nNo esperis altre do que el de tes llàgrimes\n\nni vulles més consol que els teus sospirs:\n\nla paraula millor la tens a l’ànima,\n\ni el bes més dolç te’l daren els zèfirs.\n\nMai seria l’aimada en sa presència\n\ncom és ara en la teva adoració.\n\nNodreix l’amor de pensaments i absència,\n\ni així traurà meravellosa flor.\n\nFrom <http://www.cancioneros.com/nc/8849/0/nodreix-l-amor-joan-maragall-guillermina-motta&gt;\n\nI suppose this is somewhat in the tradition of mediaeval courtly romance, where the knight could only express his love by absenting himself from his lover for long periods in order to seek adventures and perform unlikely acts of heroism or foolhardiness. Like Don Quijote…\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nToday, let’s try another poem in Catalan from Joan Maragall, writing in the early years of the 20th century as part of the Catalan nationalist revival using language and culture as an expression of identity. The poem is an example of art commenting on art, as it was written after attending a performance by a child prodigy pianist of music by Beethoven, presumably in one of Barcelona’s leading concert-halls. It captures both the inspiration from the music itself and also the wonder of it being played by someone very young.\n\n“HAVENT SENTIT BEETHOVEN”\n\nPER MIECIO HORZOWZKY, INFANT\n\nHas tornat a ensenyar-me la puresa.\n\nDel tot jo no l’havia desapresa\n\n(no del tot, criatura, no del tot);\n\nperò ara, als meus anys, la saviesa\n\nde tornar a ésser nin, amb la riquesa\n\nde tot lo món a dintre, jo l’he entesa\n\nper tes mans, criatura, per ton cor.\n\nAmb aquella innocència que el tenien\n\ntes mans de nin, el cor d’aquell gegant!\n\nEl gros aucell, en mans de xic infant,\n\ndebatia ses ales poderoses:\n\nsomreies retenint-lo entre tes mans…\n\nHa volat; i abaixant el front, commoses,\n\ntotes les dones s’han tornat formoses\n\ni tots els homes s’han tornat germans.\n\nJoan Maragall\n\nFrom <http://elglobosblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/havent-sentit-beethoven-de-joan.html&gt;\n\nThe poem is addressed directly to the young pianist, both in the title and in the content of the two stanzas; it contrasts the age and experience of the poet with the youth and purity of the musician, and shows how the poet can learn from the young man to appreciate the beauty of the world through the hands of the young musician. The concepts of child, baby, innocence recur throughout the poem, reawakening the poet’s appreciation of life and beauty.\n\nThe second stanza introduces the metaphor of Beethoven himself as the great bird flapping its wings, but held under control by the small hands of the child – even a child can master the mighty force of Beethoven’s music.\n\nThe final image in the last two lines sums up the impact a great performance can have on an audience – all the women have become beautiful and all the men have become brothers. In other words this great performance by a remarkable young pianist has united the people listening to it in a feeling of harmony and solidarity.\n\nThe Poetry Dude\n\nToday’s poem is in Catalan, so I hope it will be accessible to many followers of this blog. Having once lived in Barcelona, I can read and understand the Catalan language fairly well, so I thought I would like to include some poetry from this region. The poem is by Joan Maragall, writing at the end of the nineteenth century and it is a poem about what it means to be a poet and write poetry, so very relevant to every entry on this blog. The tilte is “L’Oda Infinita”, the Infinite Ode.\n\nL’Oda Infinita\n\nTinc una oda començada\n\nque no puc acabar mai:\n\ndia i nit me l’ha dictada\n\ntot quant canta en la ventada,\n\ntot quant brilla per l’espai.\n\nVa entonar-la ma infantesa\n\nentre ensomnis d’amor pur;\n\ndecaiguda i mig malmesa,\n\njoventut me l’ha represa\n\namb compàs molt més segur.\n\nDe seguida amb veu més forta\n\nm’han sigut dictats nous cants;\n\npro cada any que el temps s’emporta\n\nveig una altra esparsa morta\n\ni perduts els consonants.\n\nJa no sé com començava\n\nni sé com acabarà,\n\nperquè tinc la pensa esclava\n\nd’una força que s’esbrava\n\ndictant-me-la sens parar.\n\nI aixís sempre a la ventura,\n\nsens saber si lliga o no,\n\nva enllaçant la mà insegura\n\ncrits de goig, planys d’amargura,\n\nhimnes d’alta adoració.\n\nSols desitjo per ma glòria\n\nque, si algú aquesta oda sap,\n\nal moment en què jo mòria,\n\nme la digui de memòria\n\nmot per mot, de cap a cap.\n\nMe la digui a cau d’orella,\n\nesbrinant-me, fil per fil,\n\nde la ignota meravella\n\nque a la vida ens aparella\n\nel teixit ferm i subtil.\n\nI sabré si en lo que penses\n\n—oh poeta extasiat!—\n\nhi ha un ressò de les cadences\n\nde l’ocell d’ales immenses\n\nque nia en l’eternitat.\n\nFrom <http://joanmaragalligorina.weebly.com/loda-infinita.html&gt;\n\nThe idea of this poem is that the poet’s whole life is devoted to producing a never-ending ode; an ode that can never be finished. The ode will convey all the sensations and experiences of life, everything blown in on the wind, or shining out in the poet’s view.\n\nThis began in the poet’s infancy and continued in his youth and will go on as long as the poet lives. The poet here is not a creator, he is a transcriber of a force of poetry which comes from outside, which is everywhere in nature and life. The poet merely acts as a channel to capture and set down the poetry of the world, the poet is almost a slave to this force coming from outside of him.\n\nThe poems have cries of joy, bitter pain and hymns of adoration but these are expressed through the poet’s hand without conscious thought or craftsmanship. Poetry is an expression of the force of life and eternity with the poet just the humble intermediary. When the poet dies he hopes the whole poem of life will be revealed to him and whether it will continue into eternity.\n\nThe Poetry Dude"
