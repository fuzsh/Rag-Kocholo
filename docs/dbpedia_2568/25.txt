Senior Cinema Thursday is a monthly event where we screen one of our current features at a special discounted price for seniors held every third Thursday at 10:30am.

We invite senior communities and organizations to take advantage of the special $6 ticket price to bring groups to this program. The Avalon Theatre is wheelchair accessible and provides assisted listening devices to guests with hearing and visual impairments.
