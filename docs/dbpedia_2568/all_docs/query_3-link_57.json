        "text": "Compared to owning a home, low-income senior living options are a great alternative that can save people tons of money.\n\nWhen you look at the cost of living, meals, lawn care—you name it—in the end, it adds up. It’s essential to find quality affordable housing for yourself or your loved ones that suit your needs.\n\nWhether you’re looking for assisted living options, memory care, etc., we’ll lay out reliable low-income senior living options and considerations.\n\nHow to Qualify for Low-Income Housing\n\nLow-income, or subsidized housing, is affordable housing for people or seniors who have low or very low income. Section 202 housing is meant for those aged 62 or better or those with disabilities. Seniors qualify for this program if their income falls under the median income for a particular area (city, county, etc.).\n\nThis can change depending on where you live, so it’s essential to check with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development or a local Public Housing Authority. They will be able to tell you what income limits are for that area. The units you are interested in will also know this information.\n\nSeniors who are part of the CADI or EW waivers also qualify for low-income housing. We accept CADI and EW at Sunflower communities which means we will work closely with people’s case managers to ensure a fully customized living situation that meets both their medical and financial needs.\n\nSome seniors under the age of 62 may also simply be able to apply to affordable housing living options with low-income proof. Many of the below low-income apartments can offer discounted rent with proof of income with a pay stub or other state documentation. Also, proving disability and being unable to work can be considered.\n\nMany senior living options simply go for the real estate market rate and can be high or low depending on location, market trends, and other factors affecting the rent cost. But some seniors may be eligible for financial assistance or qualify for lower-income housing so they can have a steady, beautiful place to live without having to drown in the cost of rent. Here are some of the best low-income senior living options in Minnesota: from all over the state.\n\n15 Low-Income Senior Living Options\n\n1.
