        "text": "A few days ago, I didn't even know this group existed. I randomly stumbled on this recording while searching for something else. I was so impressed by the sound quality of this bootleg recording, as well as the performance, that I'm sharing it straight away.\n\nThe Dukes of September are mainly made up of Donald Fagen of Steely Dan, Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers, and Boz Scaggs from his long solo career. From time to time, some artists who were big in earlier decades have teamed up with others so they can still play larger concert venues. For instance, Bob Dylan shared a billing with Paul Simon for a tour so they could fill the largest stadiums. But this is different. This isn't just a case of one person doing a set of their hits, followed by someone else doing their hits, etc... Instead, all three stars stayed on stage the whole concert and played and/or sang on all the songs. For another, while they did do some of their best known hits, about half of the songs are covers that none of them had previously done on record.\n\nYou can read more about the Dukes of September at the Wikipedia entry here:\n\nThe Dukes of September - Wikipedia\n\nMy short summary is that these three stars went on tour together from 1989 to 1992, along with some other less famous stars, such as Phoebe Snow, Eddie Brigati of the Rascals, and blues legend Charles Brown, under the name The New York Rock and Soul Revue. They released a live album in 1991 entitled \"Live at the Beacon.\" They revived their partnership with a new name and more concert tours from 2010 to 2012, though this time without the other stars. However, two female vocalists were included, Carolyn Escoffery and Catherine Russell, and they sing lead vocals on a few of the songs here.\n\nPersonally, based on this recording, I prefer the Dukes of September over the New York Rock and Soul Revue, and I much prefer this concert bootleg over that other band's live album. It helps that this one is a lot longer, at two hours and eight minutes compared to an hour and six minutes. But also, I think it works better with more of a focus on the three major stars instead of including a bunch of lesser stars. For instance, on \"Live at the Beacon,\" Boz Scaggs only sang lead on one song, whereas here he sang a bunch.\n\nStrangely, the Dukes of September never released any official album, live or studio. They closest they came is a performance recorded in New York City and played as part of \"Great Performances\" on PBS. It was later released as a DVD, but not in any audio format. About half of the songs on that are different than the ones here, so maybe I'll find enough material to post a different concert from this bunch someday.\n\nIt seems Donald Fagen of Steely Dan was the main impetus for this group. His wife was the producer for their tours and those of their earlier incarnation, and Fagen acted as an MC of sorts, doing most of the talking between songs.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the sound quality of this is absolutely fantastic. It's hard to believe it's only a bootleg, because it's recorded and mixed so well that it sounds better than many official live albums. I can only guess that this was professionally done with plans for a possible official album that never came to fruition.\n\nThere's only one snag, and it's a rather big one, in my opinion: the soundboard recording was so very good that not much of the audience could be heard after each song. But there was enough there so that I was able to boost the volume until it more or less sounded like a typical cheering crowd.\n\nIf you're a fan of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, and/or Boz Scaggs, you should check it out. As nice as their versions of their own songs are, I think it's even more interesting hearing this bunch do lots of unexpected cover songs. They played songs by Don Covay, the Grateful Dead, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Aretha Franklin, the Band, Mink DeVille, the O'Jays, the Beach Boys, Thunderclap Newman, and more. I think it's pretty clear they were having an especially good time playing songs other than their same old hits that probably bored them by this point in their careers.\n\n01 Sookie Sookie (Dukes of September)\n\n02 Heighty Hi (Dukes of September)\n\n03 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n04 Donâ€™t Mess Up a Good Thing (Dukes of September)\n\n05 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n06 Shakedown Street (Dukes of September)\n\n07 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n08 You Never Can Tell (Dukes of September)\n\n09 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n10 I've Got News for You (Dukes of September)\n\n11 Green Flower Street (Dukes of September)\n\n12 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n13 Miss Sun (Dukes of September)\n\n14 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n15 I Keep Forgettin' (Dukes of September)\n\n16 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n17 Rock Steady (Dukes of September)\n\n18 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n19 Rag Mama Rag (Dukes of September)\n\n20 The Shape I'm In (Dukes of September)\n\n21 Love TKO (Dukes of September)\n\n22 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n23 I Live the Life I Love (Dukes of September)\n\n24 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n25 Cadillac Walk (Dukes of September)\n\n26 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n27 What a Fool Believes (Dukes of September)\n\n28 IGY [What a Beautiful World] (Dukes of September)\n\n29 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n30 Lowdown (Dukes of September)\n\n31 Takin' It to the Streets (Dukes of September)\n\n32 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n33 Reelin' in the Years (Dukes of September)\n\n34 Love Train (Dukes of September)\n\n35 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n36 Help Me Rhonda (Dukes of September)\n\n37 Peg (Dukes of September)\n\n38 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n39 Something in the Air (Dukes of September)\n\n40 talk (Dukes of September)\n\n41 Sookie Sookie [Reprise] (Dukes of September)\n\nhttps://www.imagenetz.de/hRYQp"
