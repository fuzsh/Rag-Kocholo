The digital projector with 4K capabilities and 65 foot wide screen were installed in 2011 and are sure to amaze. Images are crisp, bright – and big! Especially exciting is the 3D technology that comes with RealD 3D technology. Films and movies presented in RealD 3D immerse you in exciting new worlds, it’s like you’ve stepped into the movie. You won’t just watch the movie – you’ll experience it!\n\nAdd in the six channel digital surround sound and some great movie munchies, and Hastings Museum is the best (and biggest!) Theatre in the region!\n\nThe Theatre is entirely wheelchair and handicapped accessible."
