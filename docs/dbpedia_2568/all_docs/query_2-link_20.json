Magenta is a domestic from the planet Transsexual, in the galaxy Transylvania. Her job is simple: keep the castle clean and prepare all meals. Magenta is fond of her brother Riff Raff and can be seen laughing at the other's misery. She is close friends with Columbia. Magenta is not afraid to put her foot down to get her point across and will be pushy or rude to get what she wants.\n\nBrad: Male, 18-35 (Range: Bari-Tenor, Bb2-G4) Quirky and overly optimistic. An All-American man who proposes to his girlfriend, Janet Weiss. However, on the way to meet his old friend and science teacher, Dr. Scott, Brad Majors ends up with a flat tire on his car.
