        "text": "Do you dream of clowning? It’s time to take those dreams to the next level with this updated resource of top clown schools in the US.\n\nThese opportunities — ranging from drop-in classes to Master of Arts programs — offer creative inspiration, historical perspective, skill development, and valuable feedback to support your path to wearing the red nose.\n\nWhile there’s no right way to become a clown, training completed by Clowns Without Borders (CWB) artists typically includes contemporary circus performance and working in an ensemble. The schools highlighted here celebrate these styles. They also espouse clown qualities we treasure, including vulnerability, authenticity, and presence.\n\nBefore we jump into our list of top clown schools in the US, we’ve got a question for you:\n\nWhat kind of clown will you be?\n\nClowntemplation: Questions to Help You Find Your Best-Fit Clown School\n\n“Clown” means something different for everyone.\n\nYou may not know what kind of clown you want to be, or what kind of clown school you want to attend. And that’s okay.\n\nTo get a clearer picture, we encourage you to continue learning about clowning, how it can foster play and connection, and influence culture. This kind of investigation will give you direction, or at least get you asking interesting questions.\n\nHere are five questions you can ask yourself right now to help bring clarity to your school search.\n\nWait! What about the Rainbow Wigs and Full Makeup?\n\nIf you dream of putting on big shoes and full makeup, definitely check out Mooseburger, Clown Camp, and other listings via the World Clown Association.\n\nYou won’t find that style of clown taught in the places listed below.\n\nWhat will you find?\n\nInspired locations\n\nTalented artist-teachers\n\nPassionate students with whom you can share the journey\n\nLet’s do this!\n\nThe Funniest Education You’ll Ever Get: Top Clown Schools in the US\n\n1. Dell’Arte International – Blue Lake, California\n\nDell’Arte International is a school for theater training, research, and performance of the actor-creator.\n\nCarlo Mazzone-Clementi and Jane Hill wanted to share the European traditions of physical theater training with North American artists and performers. So they founded Dell’Arte in 1971. Since then, Dell’Arte International has gained international recognition.\n\nIts School of Physical Theater teaches actors to develop their use of physical spaces, gestures, and movements while approaching stage performance as poetic expression. Instruction guides students to explore and produce creative works.\n\nOfferings\n\nPhysical theater education is at the core of Dell’Arte’s offerings, which include a Clown Core program, a professional training program, a summer intensive, and a study abroad in Bali. Scholarship opportunities are available.\n\nThe campus is replete with studios, gymnastics/acro classrooms, mask construction area, costume shop, theater, amphitheater, as well as an outdoor wilderness space along the Northern Coast of California.\n\nMany Dell’Arte graduates fill the Clowns Without Borders roster.\n\nLearn more at https://dellarte.com/.\n\n2. Center for Movement Theatre – Washington DC\n\nThe Center for Movement Theatre is a large, gorgeous workspace for practitioners, teachers, and trainers.\n\nDody Disanto instructs students in her physical approach to acting based on the work of the late Jacques Lecoq. Physical theater training compels a student to learn the space — how to use it and body gestures to communicate with maximum clarity and intention for the audience.\n\nAt the core of this style of theater is the use of neutral masks.\n\nThe Neutral Mask\n\nTo best understand neutral mask work, we recommend you sign up for a course. Ha!\n\nA cursory explanation?\n\nStudents wear the neutral mask during training. As soon as they don the mask, pupils must be “at the ready” in the words of Dody Disanto. Ready to play, create, and broaden the physical senses.\n\nLecoq’s neutral masks gradually become smaller as the student’s theater skills become more refined. Eventually, you’ll just wear a clown nose.\n\nOfferings\n\nDody Disanto teaches a monthly drop-in movement clinic, 5-day summer intensives, a bouffon laboratory, neutral mask, and a dynamic studies class.\n\nThe Center is complete with a gym, treatment rooms, and a natural light-filled studio.\n\nLearn more at https://www.thisisthecenter.com/.\n\n3. Celebration Barn Theater – Western Maine\n\nCelebration Barn Theater offers intensives in a beautifully restored horse barn in rural Maine. It’s a neigh-sayers game-changer.\n\nTony Montanaro opened the Celebration Barn in 1972, creating a hub for mastering mime, improvisation, storytelling, and other skills that make great performers shine.\n\nAlumni of the Barn have taken the skills they learned there and have gone on to amazing careers in theater, film, and television. Think Sesame Street puppeteers, writers for Between the Lions, and performers with Cirque du Soleil.\n\nOfferings\n\nCome prepared to play!\n\nParticipants receive quality instruction from talented teachers and exposure to other exceptional actors. Workshops and residencies focus on collaboration and pushing the artist’s creative exploration to the edge.\n\nYou can polish your performance at a retreat with Robert Post; try something new with Principles of Eccentric Performing; dive deep into bouffon and mocking; trigger your imagination with Spymonkey’s Creating Clown Material.\n\nThe Celebration Barn also holds shows on its grounds and features a traveling comedy play.\n\nLearn more at https://celebrationbarn.com/.\n\n4. Pig Iron – Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nPig Iron is an award-winning theater company, best known for its experimental theater.\n\nTouring with its unconventional in-house productions since 2004, Pig Iron Theatre Company creates unique and challenging performances, trains new artists, and asks tough questions about the world around us.\n\nOfferings\n\nPig Iron School focuses on performance acting with full-impact creativity.

USC School of Dramatic Arts, Institute for Theatre & Social Change – Los Angeles, California\n\nUSC School of Dramatic Arts is a clown school that believes that medical clowning is transformative and healing.\n\nMedical clowns help patients feel better by reducing stress and boosting emotional well-being. The Medical Clowning Program at USC uses humor to improve the patient experience in local hospitals, and to shape a “healthier humanity.” The program has certified 25 undergraduate medical clowns and 10 professional performers.\n\nUSC Medical Clowns work outside of hospitals too. They’re partnering with The Children’s Bureau to provide emotional support to children through support groups, making them the first program in the US to use medical clowning in this therapeutic setting.\n\nLearn more at https://itsc.usc.edu/mc-program/about-medical-clowning-2/.\n\n6. Clown Gym – New York City, New York\n\nWhile it sounds like a fun place to work out, Clown Gym is actually a great place for high-quality actor training in NYC.\n\nIt started as a collaborative experiment. It’s grown over the years to become one of the city’s most reliable sources for connecting artists in a community of experimentation, laughter, and play.\n\nJulia Proctor, Director of Clown Gym, draws on her training with respected instructors such as Christopher Bayes and Philippe Gaulier to help students access their natural creativity and generosity in their acting. She encourages students to connect with their spontaneous impulses and build their skills in a supportive and playful community.\n\nClown Gym Offerings\n\nTuesday night drop-in classes are open to all, just register online before actually dropping in. These classes will help you strengthen your existing acting muscles and help you discover others you didn’t even know you had.\n\nIn addition, Clown Gym offers intensives, bootcamps, mentors, and shows.
