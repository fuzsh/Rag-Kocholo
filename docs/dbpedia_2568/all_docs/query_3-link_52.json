        "text": "The Playshop Theatre at Allegheny College was inaugurated by Alice Huntington Spalding in 1929 with her production of Dear Brutus in Arter Hall. In the intervening years, the Playshop has produced over 500 plays including classic works by Shakespeare, Molière, Shaw, Williams, O’Neill, Miller, Wilder, and Coward, contemporary playwrights such as Sam Shepard, Tom Stoppard, Suzan-Lori Parks, Wendy Wasserstein, Tina Howe, Tony Kushner, Caryl Churchill, and Paula Vogel, and musicals including The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, The Pirates of Penzance, and Carousel, as well as original works by faculty, students and visiting artists. In 2009 we moved into our new home in the Vukovich Center for Communication Arts. The Playshop season is now performed in the Gladys Mullenix Black Theatre.\n\nAlum Liz Colarte presents “As Good As It Gets” at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe August 2-24!\n\nWhat do you do when you hate the guy you’re dating, but he only has one eye? What do you stare at when sitting across from an old person whose eyes are constantly dripping in a way that can’t possibly be healthy? What happens when a textbook life doesn’t match up with the story you had in your head? May as well have some gross, wet cake and laugh all the way down. A wet punch of the ordinary and of what we lose when we can’t be satisfied.\n\nIf you’ll be in Scotland, don’t miss it! https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/as-good-as-it-gets A few weeks after the Fringe Festival, the Playshop Theatre will present Liz and her production “As Good As It Gets” September 20-21 as part of Blue and Gold Weekend.\n\nPlayshop Theatre at Allegheny College Presents: “Head Over Heels” April 4-7!\n\nThe Playshop Theatre will present Head Over Heels April 4-7, 2024. The show is directed by Mark Cosdon; Betsy Getschman is the choreographer; Wei En Chan is the music director.\n\nHead Over Heels is a joyously exuberant rock musical! When an oracle’s prophecy threatens its fortunes, Arcadia’s royal family must demonstrate that “love comes first!” This Elizabethan-styled farce, awash in sass and desire, features the music of the Go-Go’s!\n\nTickets are $10 for the general public; $8 for Allegheny employees, senior citizens and non-Allegheny students; free to Allegheny students. Reservations may be made online at the Playshop Box Office or by phoning (814) 332-3414.\n\nYou can view the digital program for Head Over Heels here.\n\nPlayshop Theatre at Allegheny College Presents:\n\n“Eurydice” November 10-12, November 16, 18\n\nThe Playshop Theatre at Allegheny College will present performances of Eurydice in the Gladys Mullenix Black Theatre on the Allegheny College campus (Vukovich Center for the Performing Arts) this November! Join us for this one-hour performance on November 10 & 11 at 8pm, November 12 at 2pm, November 16 at 8pm, and November 18 at 2pm.\n\nEurydice, a contemporary, quirky, and poetic retelling of Orpheus and Eurydice’s classic myth, but from the perspective of its heroine. Playwright Sarah Ruhl captures the struggles of love and grief. Ruhl plants new characters, twists of fate, and moments of choice for Eurydice to navigate. 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of this beloved piece. Join us in the underworld for the Playshop’s immersive 90’s take on this beautifully crafted feminist adaptation.\n\nEurydice features Allegheny students (in order of appearances): Lucy Palmer, Jude Gotschall, Samuel Kagle, Jacob Beaudoin, Bella James, Emily Adams, and Kenzie Smith. The production is directed by Rachel Hoey alongside designers Michael Mehler (Scenic Design), Maddy Segar (Student Costume designer), LeeAnn Yeckley (Technical Direction) Eve Bandi (Guest Lighting Designer) and Grace Leckey (Guest Sound Designer). The production Stage Manager is Jess Duerstein (student manager).\n\nTickets are $10 for the general public; $8 for Allegheny employees, senior citizens and non-Allegheny students; free to Allegheny students.
