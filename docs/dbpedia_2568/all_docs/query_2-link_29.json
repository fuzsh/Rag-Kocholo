        "text": "Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about performance. Well…really all my life since I am a performer, but right now I’m thinking in more academic terms. The department where I work at Bates College is currently working through ideas and thoughts about the theory of performance and how it works with in our own pedagogical approaches. (I get giddy every time I get to use the word “pedagogical.” Not sure why.) There are two standard definitions of “performance.” One is “an act of staging or presenting a play, concert, or other form of entertainment. The other is “the action or process of carrying out or accomplishing an action, task, or function.” You might notice that definition one is a part of definition two, but definition two is not necessarily definition one. (I probably didn’t have to point that out, but it makes me feel smarter when I do.) As a performer based in the first definition, I try hard to make people forget that they are watching the first, but simply experiencing the second. That is the whole concept behind making theatre a mirror unto society.\n\nDuring a recent anti-police brutality march in Lewiston, Maine, I was thinking about the idea of protest as performance with the idea that the protestors are the performers. But you might ask, “Hey smart academic artist-type guy, if that is so, then who is the audience? And why are you in my house?” Well, to answer the second question first, you left the door unlocked. The first question, which I am answering second, will take a bit more of a deeper dive. We could be just performing for ourselves. Protests can be an effective way of galvanizing the thoughts and motivations of a group of like-minded folks looking for inspiration to carry on to a larger struggle. Of course, if that was the case, we could have just got a couple of cases of beer, some hot dogs (or vegan-based tube-shaped meat like products) and grilled them at my house and call it a day. No, there is something larger at play here. Maybe we did it for the police that were holding the traffic and showing a professional amount of restraint. The type of restraint that seemed to be lost elsewhere. While I am sure that many of them were appreciative of the overtime pay, they didn’t necessarily seem to embrace what we were doing, considering the subject matter.\n\nNone of the cops showed any sign of solidarity, but then again, none of them kneeled with protestors and then decided to start busting the heads of those same protestors five minutes later. I’ll take grumpy cooperation over hypocritical displays of solidarity any day.\n\nWhat we were doing with all of this are marching and shouting of slogans was presenting ourselves as subjects that embody a dramatic question that is put forth to the public/audience. That audience were the onlookers and passersby. They have a chance to be moved by the message. Now this brings up two quotes that I’d like to respectfully highjack from Jeffery S Juris who wrote a chapter in the book “Embodying Protest: Culture and Performance with Social Movements” The first quote is, “Cultural approaches to the study of social movements are by now well ensconced in the pantheon of social movement theory as the field has moved beyond the overly rationalist, materialist, and institutional biases of resource mobilization and early political process traditions.” Now…I actually have no idea what this means. I only included it because I thought it sounded impressive (My students do this all the time. I figured I’d give it a shot). Less impressive and more to the point is this, “…the notion of performance can be used in so many ways and to cover so many things that it becomes meaningless.” This statement is a warning, but I also think it works as an end goal in itself. In the effective protest, the performance has that quality of Brechtian alienation in that it confronts the “audience” with its message in a way that temporarily disrupts. The line between “performance” and “reality” becomes meaningless. This may anger the passerby, especially when they’re stuck in traffic just trying to grab a quick Big Mac before heading to their soul-sucking job in a paper-pushing factory. (Seriously, y’all. Why were you complaining? We’re helping to delay your descent into mediocrity by a few minutes.) But now, instead, they are forced to sit in traffic and think about systemic racism and police brutality. “Bummer,” thinks the driver stuck in protest traffic, “Why can’t these protests be more…I dunno…convenient.” Well, my commuter friend, performances that confront are not supposed to be convenient. That’s the point. They take you out of your comfort zone and force you to consider things besides “When is intermission?,” “Will they have peanuts?,” and “How do they remember all those lines?” The Birmingham bus boycott was not a polite affair. It was disruptive and inconvenient to the economy of the city. That was the whole idea. That’s why Rosa Park’s performative butt remained in her seat.\n\nRecently, we’ve seen on display another approach to public performance. One that seeks to counter the protests with a presentation that focuses on power, control, and the All-American desire to be seen going to church. (Note: I didn’t say actually GO to church. That requires work.) It is hard to be a political leader without having mastered the performative. Heck, we let ourselves be talked into thinking that “Trickle-down economics” was a thing by a man whose biggest starring roles were opposite a chimpanzee. That dude got two terms. Another two termer from Arkansas thrilled us by blowing a half-decent sax solo on the Arsenio Hall Show which made us instantly forget about his sexual assault allegations. Still another from a wealthy family in Connecticut had Texans thinking he was more Texan than actual Texans. And that is no small feat. From him we won the grand prize of two near-endless wars and an economy made of balsa wood.\n\nOur current president happens to hold a SAG card, so he knows a thing or two about performance. After all, he had a hit TV series where he played a successful business man who got to judge other business type people and comically fire them on a whim. It’s brilliant piece of fiction. I mean it was fiction, right? Who would hire someone who has had six bankruptcies to their name to be the ultimate boss in a “reality” series based on building a successful business? That would be just absurd.\n\nSo now we have protesters/looters (It’s just SOO much easier to lump them all together. Nuance just slows things down, don’t you think?) right there in Washington D.C. giving folks the impression that something might actually be wrong with something. This “performance” has been disturbing the American people and keeping them up past their collective bedtimes. What is needed is, obviously, a counter-performance. This performance will have the American public as its audience. Or at least the part of the American public that realizes it’s too much work trying to figure out the difference between “protestors” and “looters.” We’re talking about a counter-performance that emphasizes traditional Antebellum American values. One that puts the style over the substance, because substance is just not fun. We need a performance where the style rules and the substance drools.\n\nHere is the scene:\n\nFirst, the president decides that he wants to do something that almost every red-blooded American can get behind, and that is simply going to church…and having a photo opportunity. After all, isn’t that what church is for? Wait…you mean people are actually allowed to go inside? Cool. Anyway, this is a very simple goal that is being opposed by the looter/terrorists roaming the D.C. streets like a scene out of “Escape from NY: D.C. version.” So naturally, these terrorists/super-human mutants must be cleared. Once law enforcement has cleared the area using the gentle tools of persuasion such as polite concussion grenades, tears of sympathy gas, and sparklers-that-go-bang, the way was cleared for the President to show Americans that he is “real people” by walking across the now safe street. Going to St. John’s Lafayette and holding up the Bible for all to see. Church is back! The super-human mutant/Chinese communists operatives couldn’t stop it! The illegal immigrant flu couldn’t stop it! Ok, so the book was held upside down and backwards. You all know what it is. The President didn’t quote anything from the book? So, what? I mean, it’s not like it’s actually supposed to be read, right? Any good performer knows that the quality of a prop is in what it means, not how it’s used. This is performance theory in action. This is worth a dozen college classes in the subject. In the war between style over substance, substance never had a chance.\n\nIn this moment, we are using our platform to amplify the voices in our community that are systematically and often institutionally marginalized. Thank you, Cliff."
