        "text": "Unwind Your Mind: Activities for Persons with Early Dementia\n\nA diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease or other dementia is life changing. Because individuals with dementia often feel isolated and disconnected, it is important that opportunities to participate in community activities that are meaningful, creative, and social are made available to them. Such activity can provide a sense of competence, a reduction in depression, and improved relationships with family members. Studies have shown that arts, crafts, computers and social activities help slow mild cognitive loss by up to 50%. The Community Center, in cooperation with Lutheran Life Village Village of Birchwood and Lori Stock of the Fort Wayne Alzheimer Association, is now offering classes and activities for those with signs of early dementia. A schedule of upcoming classes and programs are NOW available on the Unwind Your Mind link.\n\nSummer Programs (June-August)\n\nPlease note, Preserving Assets for the Future will be on June 24 at 1 pm and NOT June 26th.\n\nFall Programs (September-November)\n\nLegal Counseling\n\nBeers and Mallers, L.L.C. attorneys are at the Community Center on the first Friday morning of every month to answer your legal questions. Please call 427-6460 to make an appointment. This FREE service is offered to people age 50 and over.\n\nDay Dates Time\n\nWed 9/4, 10/2, 11/6 9:20-11 am\n\nLocation: Community Center, 233 W. Main St."
