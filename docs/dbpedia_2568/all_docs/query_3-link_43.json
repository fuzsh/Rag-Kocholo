Please be courteous of your neighbors and abide by your reservation times.\n\nKeep it Clean\n\nWe’re sure you’ll find Dublin’s parks and bikeways to be clean, beautiful places to enjoy with your family. The City strives to keep its parks, playgrounds and bikeways clean and free of litter. Please leave the parks as clean as you find them so that others will enjoy them as much as you do. Disposal of litter in public places is prohibited unless placed in public trash containers or using City-authorized containers as part of the City’s refuse, recycling and yard waste collection programs.\n\nPets\n\nWe know your furry friends enjoy nature as much as you do. We ask you to be safe and courteous with your pets.\n\nAnimals may not run at-large in our parks. All animals must be under the owner’s control at all times. All pets must be securely leashed, kept in a vehicle or suitably caged.\n\nAnimal owners also must pick up and properly dispose of any fecal matter left by their pets. It’s not just courteous — it’s the law!\n\nHorses\n\nHorses are allowed in designated areas of Glacier Ridge Metro Park.\n\nHunting and Fishing\n\nFor the safety of our residents, hunting is forbidden in the City. Fishing is permitted in designated areas, including certain City park ponds and in the Scioto River (with a license). Please fish only in ponds where signs prohibiting fishing are not posted.\n\nRespect our Parks\n\nPlants and animals also are part of the Dublin community. Please respect the plant and animal life and ecosystems of our natural areas. Enjoy the flowers, trees and other flora without picking or damaging plants. Touching or disturbing wildlife, including animal and bird nesting areas and eggs can be dangerous to humans — not to mention our flora and fauna! And please do not damage or remove any property or natural feature, including stones and minerals, earth, wood, and nuts. Take only pictures and leave only footprints in our parks."
