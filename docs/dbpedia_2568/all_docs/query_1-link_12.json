        "text": "watch now\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday's primary contests from coast to coast, each winning hundreds of delegates and moving much closer to clinching their respective parties' nominations.\n\nBiden walked away from the night with at least 1,424 delegates, slightly more than 72% of the total he needs to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump ended the day with a minimum of 946 delegates, or 78% of the 1,215 total he requires in order to formally become the Republican party's presumptive nominee.\n\nYet amid their victorious romps through states like California, Maine and Arkansas, both men lost unexpected contests that highlighted potential obstacles to uniting their parties' most loyal voters behind them.\n\nBiden lost American Samoa's Democratic caucus to political newcomer Jason Palmer, an entrepreneur who has never set foot on the South Pacific islands that make the U.S. territory. Only 91 total votes were cast in the caucus, and Palmer won 50 of them. Biden came away with 41.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley also scored an upset victory over Trump in Vermont's Republican primary, winning 50% of the vote, while Trump secured just 45%.\n\nHaley will drop out of the 2024 presidential race Wednesday, a source familiar with her plans confirmed to NBC News.\n\nHaley won't announce an endorsement Wednesday, two people told NBC News. Instead, she will encourage Trump to earn the support of Republicans and independent voters who backed her, one of the sources said.\n\nLive: NBC News Super Tuesday 2024 Primary Election Results\n\nBelow are NBC's projections for the presidential primary and caucus winners, as of 1:00 a.m. ET Wednesday.\n\nAlabama: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nAmerican Samoa: Jason Palmer wins Democratic caucus\n\nArkansas: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nCalifornia: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nColorado: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nMaine: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nMassachusetts: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nMinnesota: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nNorth Carolina: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nOklahoma: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nTennessee: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nTexas: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nVermont: Haley wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic primary\n\nVirginia: Trump wins GOP contest, Biden wins Democratic race\n\nUtah: Biden wins Democratic primary\n\nIn addition to the presidential race, several down ballot contests Tuesday were closely watched.\n\nNone more so than California's Senate primary, where Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey won the top two spots in a race to fill the seat vacated by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nCalifornia is a deep blue state, so Tuesday's results were especially promising for Schiff. In November, the Trump antagonist will be the only Democrat on the ballot in a state that has not elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since the 1960's.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, Republican Steve Garvey clinch top spots in California Senate primary: NBC\n\nMario Tama | Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff will win California's Senate primary race, followed by Republican former MLB star Steve Garvey, NBC News projects.\n\nThe projected result means Schiff and Garvey will advance to the general election to compete for the Senate seat formerly held by Dianne Feinstein.\n\nSchiff and Garvey defeated a large field of challengers in California's \"jungle primary\" race, where the top two finishers advance, regardless of party affiliation. Among them were Democratic Reps. Katie Porter and Barbara Lee, who both campaigned on progressive platforms.\n\nMario Tama | Getty Images\n\nalifornia is a deep blue state, so Tuesday's results portend especially well for Schiff, who is now the only Democrat in the race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won California in 2020 by nearly 30 points over Donald Trump. The last Republican presidential candidate to win California was George H.W. Bush, in 1988.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nCalifornia Senate primary is too close to call, NBC projects\n\nMark Ralston | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe California Senate primary result is too close to call, NBC projected shortly after polls in the state closed at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nCalifornia has an all-party \"jungle\" primary system, in which the top two candidates, regardless of party, move ahead to the general election.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump wins California Republican primary, Super Tuesday's biggest delegate prize\n\nMike Blake | Reuters\n\nDonald Trump will win California's Republican presidential primary, moving him one large step closer to clinching the GOP nomination, NBC News projects.\n\nThe call came shortly after polls closed at 11 p.m. ET. Trump was widely expected to defeat Nikki Haley in the California primary and win all 169 of its available delegates.\n\nThe Golden State carries the biggest delegate bounty of the 15 states holding primary elections on Super Tuesday, where 865 GOP delegates are up for grabs.\n\nTrump came into the week with 276 delegates. He needs 1,215 to secure the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nBiden wins California Democratic primary, NBC projects\n\nJonathan Ernst | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win California's Democratic primary, NBC News projects.\n\nThe call came moments after polls closed in the state at 11 p.m. ET. There are 424 pledged delegates up for grabs in the state's Democratic primary, more than in any other Super Tuesday race.\n\nBiden was widely expected to easily trounce his few long-shot primary challengers in the Golden State and the remaining contests on the road to the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\n'Our country is dying': Trump paints dark portrait of America in Super Tuesday victory speech\n\nMarco Bello | Reuters\n\nIn a grim Super Tuesday victory speech, Donald Trump portrayed America under President Joe Biden as a country on the brink of death. And he blamed migrants for many of the nation's woes.\n\n\"Our cities are choking to death. Our states are dying. And frankly, our country is dying,\" Trump claimed in a dark, apocalyptic 18-minute speech at his Florida resort home Mar-a-Lago.\n\nA few hundred of his friends and supporters had gathered to celebrate his primary wins.\n\nTrump alleged that Biden and his allies \"want open borders, and open borders are going to destroy our country.\"\n\n\"Our cities are being overrun with migrant crime, and that's Biden migrant crime,\" Trump claimed.\n\nThere is paltry evidence for Trump's accusations. According to an NBC News analysis of 2024 crime data, the U.S. cities that have received the most migrants have experienced decreasing overall crime levels.\n\n\"In some ways we're a third-world country,\" Trump said elsewhere in the speech, singling out the border and elections.\n\nTrump for years has falsely claimed that his loss to Biden in the 2020 election was rigged through widespread voter fraud. He continues to falsely claim he won that election.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nTexas Senate race will pit incumbent Ted Cruz against Democratic Rep. Colin Allred\n\nEmil Lippe | Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Texas Rep. Colin Allred will face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November, NBC News projects.\n\nAllred is the latest Democrat to try to unseat Cruz, who has been in the Senate since 2013. Former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke tried but failed to beat Cruz during the 2018 election.\n\n- Brian Schwartz\n\nWho is Jason Palmer? The little-known Democrat who just beat Biden\n\nThe longshot Democratic challenger to beat President Joe Biden in a Super Tuesday contest was not a Minnesota congressman nor a self-help author.\n\nIt was Jason Palmer, a Baltimore-based venture capitalist.\n\nPalmer took 56% of the vote in American Samoa's Democratic caucus, which is 51 out of the U.S. territory's total 91 votes cast.\n\n\"Honored to announce my victory in the American Samoa presidential primary. Thank you to the incredible community for your support,\" Palmer wrote on X Tuesday night. \"This win is a testament to the power of our voices. Together, we can rebuild the American Dream and shape a brighter future for all.\"\n\nPalmer has worked at Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, according to his campaign website.\n\nPalmer built his campaign platform on boosting small businesses and using his entrepreneurial, capitalist background to \"to transform the federal government to run more like a high-tech, highly-efficient, well-respected business that puts its customers' needs first.\"\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nNikki Haley projected to win upset victory in Vermont GOP primary: NBC News\n\nBrian Snyder | Reuters\n\nNikki Haley is projected by NBC News to win the Republican presidential primary in Vermont.\n\nHaley's projected victory comes two days after her first primary victory, in the District of Columbia\n\nThe former South Carolina governor is the only serious challenger to ex-President Donald Trump in the GOP presidential nomination contest. Haley served as the United States ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration.\n\nVermont has an open primary system, which allows people to vote in the party primary of their choice, regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nPaul Somerset, a Democrat from Montpelier who owns a property management company, told NBC News, \"I voted Republican for the first time in my life because I wanted to vote for Nikki Haley because I would like to see her beat or at least be strong enough to make Trump look weak.\"\n\n\"This is an anti-Trump vote,\" said Somerset. \"I'm not voting for Haley.\"\n\nSomerset, who was one of several Democrats to describe strategically voting for Haley to thwart Trump in the primary, called the former president's bid to return to the White House \"the most dangerous thing I've seen since I've been voting in 1978.\"\n\n\"It scares the hell out of me,\" he said.\n\nVermont has three votes in the Electoral College.\n\nThe last Republican presidential nominee to win Vermont in the national election was former President George H.W. Bush, in 1988.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nBiden: Trump is 'determined to destroy democracy'\n\nNathan Howard | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned that Donald Trump \"is determined to destroy our democracy\" as he said Super Tuesday's results leave American voters \"with a clear choice\" between him and the Republican former president.\n\n\"Are we going to keep moving forward or will we allow Donald Trump to drag us backwards into the chaos, division, and darkness that defined his term in office?\" Biden asked in a statement.\n\n\"Four years ago, I ran because of the existential threat Donald Trump posed to the America we all believe in,\" Biden said. \"Since then, we've made enormous progress: 15 million jobs, wages rising faster than inflation, taking on Big Pharma and the gun lobby — and winning. But we have more to do.\"\n\nIf Trump is returned to the White House, \"all of this progress is at risk,\" said Biden.\n\n\"He is driven by grievance and grift, focused on his own revenge and retribution, not the American people\" said the president.\n\n\"He is determined to destroy our democracy, rip away fundamental freedoms like the ability for women to make their own health care decisions, and pass another round of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy — and he'll do or say anything to put himself in power.\"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nLong shot Jason Palmer defeats Biden in American Samoa Democratic caucus: NBC News\n\nEducation Images | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden will lose the Democratic caucus in American Samoa to little-known candidate Jason Palmer, NBC News projects.\n\nPalmer's victory is a striking outcome for Biden, who has tallied up win after win Tuesday night.\n\nAmerican Samoa, a U.S. territory, only held a Democratic caucus.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nBiden is projected winner in Utah Democratic primary, NBC News projects\n\nGeorge Frey | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win the Democratic primary in Utah, NBC News projects.\n\nThirty delegates are at stake in the primary.\n\nSusan Cissoko, 35, told NBC 5 that she was voting for Biden because of his support for student loan debt relief, his stance on social services, and because of the ethnic makeup of the Democratic party.\n\n\"Although I don't 100% agree with Biden, he aligns more with my perspective and views over [Donald] Trump and the Republican Party,\" Cissoko told the television station while dropping off her mail-in ballot in Provo.\n\nUtah has six votes in the Electoral College, which determines the winner of the presidential election after the popular vote in November.\n\nRepublicans hold a nearly 4-to-1 edge over Democrats in registered voters in Utah.\n\nThe state has voted for a Democratic presidential nominee in the national election just once since 1952.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson won Utah in 1964, when the Democrat garnered 61% of the national vote, the largest percentage of a U.S. presidential candidate since 1820.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump will win Colorado's Republican primary, NBC News projects\n\nJulia Nikhinson | Getty Images\n\nTrump will win Colorado's Republican presidential primary, NBC News projects, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the state's ruling to remove the former president from the ballot.\n\nHe lost the state to Biden by 55.4% to 41.9% in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump once again defeated challenger Nikki Haley, picking up more Republican delegates on the way to the 1,215 needed to win the nomination.\n\nIn December, Colorado's Supreme Court blocked Trump from the ballot in a primary election for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection against the U.S. Capitol. U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled Monday that no state can ban a presidential candidate by invoking the insurrection clause of the Constitution.\n\n—Chelsey Cox\n\nDonald Trump wins Minnesota Republican primary, NBC News projects\n\nChip Somodevilla | Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump has won the Minnesota Republican primary, NBC News projects.\n\n- Brian Schwartz\n\nBiden will win Colorado's Democratic primary, NBC News projects\n\nHelen H.

So I don't think the Massachusetts primary is going to make a ton of difference because the state isn't gonna go for Trump so it's moot. It would be more interesting if we were in Wisconsin,\" Jim Kan, a Massachusetts voter who chose Trump over Haley, told NBC News.\n\n- Brian Schwartz\n\nTrump projected to win Texas Republican primary: NBC News\n\nGo Nakamura | Reuters\n\nDonald Trump is projected by NBC News to win the Texas Republican presidential primary.\n\nThere were 161 delegates at stake in the GOP primary.\n\nThe former president Trump has twice won Texas in the national presidential election.\n\nIn 2016, when he won the White House, Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 52.5% to 43.5% in Texas.\n\nFour years later, Trump bested President Joe Biden by 52.1% to 46.5%.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nPresident Joe Biden projected to win Texas Democratic primary: NBC News\n\nKevin Lamarque | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win the Democratic primary in Texas, NBC News projects.\n\nThere were 244 delegates at stake in the Democratic primary\n\nJimmy Carter was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win in Texas, doing so in 1976 when he was elected to the White House.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nNorth Carolina: Rep.

That is a relatively high number given the fact that primary voters tend to be among their political party's most partisan members.\n\nOverall, election outcomes in Virginia have been steadily shifting to the left over the past decade.\n\nBut the results of the commonwealth's 2021 governor's race cast doubt on whether the Old Dominion has gone entirely blue.\n\nRepublican Glenn Youngkin was elected governor, and he has implemented a conservative policy agenda since he was sworn in.\n\n- Christina Wilkie\n\nBiden wins Virginia Democratic primary, NBC News projects\n\nSaul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win the Democratic primary in Virginia, NBC News projects. The state is crucial to the incumbent's path to reelection.\n\nVirginia is represented by two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. But in 2021, the state's voters elected a Republican, Glenn Youngkin, as governor.\n\nYoungkin's win recalibrated the political balance in a state that has been trending increasingly Democratic in recent election cycles.\n\n— Christina Wilkie\n\nSixty percent of North Carolina GOP voters think Biden did not legitimately win 2020 election: NBC News exit poll\n\nJonathan Ernst | Reuters\n\nOver half of Republican primary voters in North Carolina say they do not think President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election over Donald Trump, according to an NBC News exit poll.\n\nJust 34% of respondents said they thought the Democratic president had won the election fairly.\n\nTrump has spent the past four years stoking false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. His efforts have produced a deep distrust in the integrity of U.S. elections among many Republican voters.\n\n- Brian Schwartz\n\nBiden team says its grassroots fundraising in February set records\n\nJulia Nikhinson | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden's political operation says it had a record grassroots fundraising haul in February.\n\n\"This Super Tuesday, the split screen between our campaign and Donald Trump's operation (if you can call it that!) couldn't be more stark: President Biden continues to see record-breaking grassroots enthusiasm around a historic and winning agenda, while Donald Trump is poised to enter the general election broke, saddled by his unwavering support for the extremism Americans repeatedly reject at the ballot box – undermining our democracy, tax giveaways to the rich, and a national abortion ban,\" Biden's deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a statement.\n\nCNBC asked the campaign for the exact numbers of this fundraising, but they did not reply to questions.\n\n— Brian Schwartz\n\nBiden wins Iowa Democratic caucuses, NBC News projects\n\nAlexander Drago | Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden is projected by NBC News to win the Democratic caucuses in Iowa.\n\nBiden's projected win is his first projected victory in Super Tuesday's primaries and caucuses.\n\n— Dan Mangan\n\nTwice as many Republicans as Democrats voted in a deep blue Virginia county\n\nTom Brenner | Reuters\n\nMore than double the number of Republicans turned out to vote as Democrats in Fairfax County, Virginia, a county that is currently represented by an all-blue delegation.\n\nFairfax County Votes, the official election tracker for the area, reported just before 4 p.m. ET on social media that the Democratic primary has seen 2.7% turnout versus the Republican primary's 5.7%. Virginia's polls close at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThough the party nominees of the 2024 race are nearly a foregone conclusion, Super Tuesday is an important test for unknown variables such as voter turnout, which can be read as an indicator of voter enthusiasm and could be a deciding factor in a Biden-Trump rematch.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nCalifornia Republicans rank the economy as their top issue, NBC exit poll finds\n\nRepublican primary voters in California said the economy is the most important issue for their vote, NBC News exit poll results showed.\n\nThat top issue, selected by a 43% plurality, was followed by immigration, which garnered 39%, in the exit poll.\n\nThe vast majority of those GOP voters, 78%, also said they thought Donald Trump would handle the economy better as president than Nikki Haley.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nIn Utah Republicans caucus, but Democrats primary\n\nSean Pavone | Istock | Getty Images\n\nRepublicans in Utah will select their choice for the party's nominee via caucus, while Democrats there are holding a traditional primary to choose their favorite candidate.\n\nRepublicans will gather at more than 2,300 meetings in precincts across the states to make their pick starting at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nDemocrats are voting during the day, with polls closing at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThere are more than 890,000 registered Republicans in Utah, compared to fewer than 230,000 registered Democrats.\n\n— Dan Mangan\n\nDenver voter: 'Not Biden's biggest fan,' but 'anything's better than Trump or Haley'\n\nMarc Piscotty | Getty Images\n\n\"Anything's better than Trump or Haley,\" Denver voter Melissa Magalif told NBC News, before admitting she's \"not Biden's biggest fan by any means.\"\n\n\"I have been personally impacted by the policies that Trump made when he was president: immigration policies, Muslim ban, his Covid-era policies, and having been personally impacted by those things in a negative way, I just have to go with my gut on this one,\" Magalif told reporter Jillian Frankel about submitting her mail-in ballot for Biden.\n\nBut, she added, the Biden administration will have a lot to answer for concerning its approach to the Israel-Hamas War. Magalif said she is a member of the Jewish-Israeli community and identifies as LGBT.\n\n\"That is kind of what scares me with this election is that because of how they've handled this situation, specifically, and how it's so fresh in everybody's minds, why it could end up going back to Trump,\" she said. \"So I think if they do win, they're gonna have [to rebuild] the trust of the American people.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Sunday called for an immediate six-week cease-fire between Israel and Hamas as part of a deal to release hostages.\n\n— Chelsey Cox\n\nRFK Jr.'s Super Tuesday: Touting support from independents, spreading Covid vaccine misinformation\n\nGary Coronado | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. is not on presidential primary ballots Tuesday due to his status as an independent candidate, but he still touted himself as an alternative to President Joe Biden and Donald Trump as voters went to the polls.\n\nKennedy retweeted an image summarizing a recent Fox News poll leading Biden and Trump by several percentage points among independent voters nationally.\n\n\"It's clear Americans want to break free from the two-party system. Let's unite around our shared values and get down to business,\" Kennedy wrote in that X post. \"Our elected officials spend more time fighting across the aisle than actually improving the lives of their constituents.\"\n\nKennedy, who is a vaccine skeptic, later replied to an X post about Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announcing that an updated Covid-19 vaccine is expected to become available next fall.\n\n\"Because the first nine shots didn't protect you,\" Kennedy wrote.\n\n— Dan Mangan\n\nMark Cuban backs Biden, blasts Trump as 'snake oil salesperson'\n\nBrendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban called Donald Trump a \"snake oil salesperson\" as he praised President Joe Biden's reelection bid.\n\n\"I don't want a snake oil salesperson as President,\" Cuban told the news site Axios via email. \"I'm voting for Biden/Harris over Trump all day every day.\"\n\nCuban told Axios that Trump's voters \"are happy with their snake oil whether it works or not.\"\n\nHe said he would support Biden even if the incumbent president were on his deathbed.\n\n\"If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,\" Cuban said.\n\nCuban, who is now a minority owner in the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, was at the White House on Monday for a meeting about prescription drug costs.

Some of the Trump camp's charm offensive has been directed at her Wall Street donors, the person added.\n\nTrump has beaten Haley in all but one of the primary contests so far, and he is expected to dominate the field on Super Tuesday, when more than 800 delegates are up for grabs.\n\nA spokesman for Trump did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\n— Brian Schwartz\n\nSpousal split screen: First Lady Jill Biden hits campaign trail while Melania Trump stays away\n\nBertrand Guay | Pool | via Reuters\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden is taking a more active role on the campaign trail as her husband, President Joe Biden, seeks another term in office.\n\nBut Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, appears to be keeping clear of the spotlight.\n\nGiorgio Viera | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe former first lady has been almost completely absent from Trump's latest presidential campaign, leaving him on his own as he gears up for a rematch with Biden. She has also declined to accompany her husband to his many court appearances as he fights 91 criminal charges and multiple high-profile civil penalties.\n\nTrump said last fall that his wife will join him \"pretty soon.\" But that hasn't happened in the runup to Super Tuesday.\n\nJill Biden, meanwhile, looks to be taking a more prominent role in the Democratic incumbent's reelection bid.\n\nIn a speech in Atlanta on Friday, she lashed out at Trump over his treatment of women and stance on key women's issues, including abortion rights.\n\n\"How far will he go? When will he stop? You know the answer: He won't,\" she said of Trump. The appearance was the first lady's first stop on a three-day, four-state swing of key electoral battlegrounds.\n\nA spokesperson for Melania Trump did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nFierce battle underway for open North Carolina attorney general seat\n\nEvelyn Hockstein | Reuters\n\nWith North Carolina's Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein pursuing a gubernatorial bid, two lawmakers on Capitol Hill are looking to occupy his current office.\n\nRep. Dan Bishop, a Republican hardliner, is the sole Republican candidate in the state's attorney general race. He leaves behind a seat in a deep-red district that has sparked a GOP race to succeed him, featuring pastor Mark Harris who led a failed congressional run in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Rep. Jeff Jackson is competing on the Democratic side, in part due to the state's redrawn congressional map, which effectively turned his purple district red. Attorney Tim Dunn and Durham County District Attorney Satana Deberry are also in the Democratic running.\n\nIf none of the candidates in the North Carolina primaries secure a 30% majority or higher, the top two will head to a runoff on May 14.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nTrump, Biden and Haley are staying home on Super Tuesday\n\nSource: Kate Santaliz\n\nThis Super Tuesday, the top presidential candidates are working from home.\n\nDonald Trump played golf Tuesday morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, a few minutes' drive from his Mar-a-Lago resort home, a source told NBC News.\n\nTrump's campaign said the former president will deliver a speech at Mar-a-Lago in the evening.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, meanwhile, returned to the White House on Tuesday morning after spending the weekend at Camp David.\n\nHe is slated to convene a White House council meeting in the afternoon to announce new actions to fight \"corporate rip-offs.\"\n\nFormer United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley told CNN on Friday that she will be in her home state of South Carolina on Tuesday night, even though the state already held its primary election, which she lost to Trump.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nCrypto-backed groups spent $13 million on Super Tuesday races\n\nMario Tama | Getty Images\n\nA group of political action committees financed by the cryptocurrency industry spent just more than $13 million on congressional primary contests taking place on Super Tuesday, according to data from AdImpact.\n\nThe data shows that Fairshake, one of three crypto-backed PACs, has spent $9.5 million on television, radio and digital advertisements against Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who is running for California's open Senate seat in a massive primary fight against Democratic front-runner Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nProtect Progress, another crypto-supported committee, spent $1.7 million in support of Shomari Figures, a Democrat running in a primary campaign for Alabama's 2nd congressional district.\n\nDefend American Jobs spent more than $1 million backing two Republicans running for House seats in North Carolina.\n\n— Brian Schwartz\n\nTaylor Swift urges voters to cast ballots for candidates 'who most represent YOU'\n\nAshok Kumar | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nPop superstar Taylor Swift used her hugely popular Instagram account to urge followers to vote in the presidential primaries in her home state of Tennessee and elsewhere.\n\n\"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power,\" Swift wrote in an Instagram Story post. \"If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\nSwift then directed her 282 million followers to the link Vote.org to find information about their polling locations.\n\nThe singer backed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Supporters of former President Donald Trump started criticizing Swift months ago, in the expectation that she would endorse Biden again.\n\nBefore the Super Bowl game in February, Swift was briefly the subject of a bizarre right-wing conspiracy that imagined that her romance with Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce was a stunt designed to help Biden's reelection bid.\n\n— Dan Mangan\n\nWhere Americans are voting today\n\nChip Somodevilla | Getty Images\n\nBelow is an alphabetical list of the states where Americans are casting ballots today.\n\nThe following states are holding both Democratic and Republican primaries:\n\nAlabama\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nMaine\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMinnesota\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOklahoma\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nIn Utah, Democrats are holding a primary while Republicans are holding a caucus.\n\nIn Alaska, Republicans will caucus while Democrats are holding their primary on April 6.\n\nThough Republicans already settled Iowa in the first primary of the season, Democratic ballots have been rolling in since January and are due to be released Tuesday.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nColorado could be one of Haley's rare chances to pick up delegates\n\nHelen H. Richardson | Denver Post | Getty Images\n\nThe Colorado primary could offer Nikki Haley a rare opportunity to add to her delegate count. Former president Donald Trump is currently leading with 276 Republican delegates to Haley's 43.\n\nThe state's 37 delegates are awarded proportionally to candidates who win at least 20% of the vote. According to NBC News, Haley's worst case scenario would still likely be a pickup of 10 delegates.\n\nHaley typically performs better than Trump among Independents and center-right Republicans, according to Republican strategist Susan Del Percio. A third of the total votes cast so far in the Colorado presidential primary came from voters who were unaffiliated with either party, Axios reports.\n\nHaley also draws outsize support from affluent, college-educated Republicans. Nearly half of Colorado's population age 25 and older, 43.7%, have a Bachelor's degree or higher, per the U.S. Census.\n\n— Chelsey Cox\n\nCalifornia Democrats — and one rising Republican — vie for powerful Senate seat\n\nLoren Elliott | Reuters\n\nThe biggest primary race to watch in the nation's most populous state isn't the one for president.\n\nA crush of candidates are vying for the powerful Senate seat formerly held for two decades by Dianne Feinstein, who died in September. Sen. Laphonza Butler, whom Gov. Gavin Newsom picked to temporarily fill the vacancy, has opted not to run to keep the seat.\n\nThe Senate primary in California, which consistently votes blue in statewide contests, has largely looked like a three-way race between Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee.\n\nMario Tama | Getty Images\n\nSchiff, who gained national prominence for his leading role in the first impeachment of then-President Donald Trump, has led the pack in ad spending and polling.\n\nBut Steve Garvey, a Republican former pro baseball player, has seen a late surge in the polls, even though his campaign has placed no TV ads.\n\nThat's likely because the majority of Schiff's broadcasts mention Garvey, while none mention Porter.\n\nGary Coronado | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nIt's a strategy that could pay off massively. California has an open primary, meaning voters can select any party's candidate, and only the top two candidates will proceed to the general election.\n\nIf Schiff winds up competing against Garvey in the general, rather than Porter or Lee, he may have a better shot at winning in California, which hasn't had a Republican senator since 1992.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger\n\nEyes are on North Carolina fight to replace outgoing Gov. Roy Cooper\n\nSaul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina's primaries feature several competitive down-ballot races, including a closely watched gubernatorial primary to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, which could act as a bellwether of the battleground state's leaning in November.\n\nGov. Cooper endorsed the state's Attorney General Josh Stein to be his successor. But before Stein officially secures the incumbent party's nomination, he will have to clear a crowded Democratic field. Stein is up against four opponents including former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Morgan.\n\nIf he is the Democratic nominee, Stein could face a November matchup against Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is leading the GOP pool so far and has Donald Trump's endorsement.\n\nJoe Biden is looking to flip North Carolina after Donald Trump narrowly won the state by just over one percent in the 2020 general election. If Republicans are able to turn Gov. Cooper's seat red, it could signal how the swing state's electorate is thinking about their options at the top of the ticket.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nVermont kicks off Super Tuesday voting bright and early\n\nKate Flock | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSuper Tuesday primary voting began bright and as early as 6 a.m. ET in Vermont, with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump looking to cement their leads over their respective remaining intraparty opponents.\n\nIn the Republican primary, 17 delegates are up for grabs, while in the Democratic contest, there are 16 delegates at stake. Polls will close at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nVermont has an open primary system. Voters can choose in which party primary to vote, regardless of their personal political affiliation.\n\nVermont, which is the second-smallest state by population, will award just three votes in the Electoral College after the presidential election in November.\n\n— Dan Mangan\n\nCalifornia Senate race is already the state's most expensive ever\n\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nThe battle for California's coveted open Senate seat is still a long way from the general election, but the contest is already the state's most expensive Senate race of all time, by far.\n\nSpending on the Golden State Senate race has topped $65.3 million, AdImpact reported on Feb. 29.\n\nThat's 242% more spending than the last three California Senate races combined, according to AdImpact.\n\nThe difference underscores just how competitive the race for late Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat has been compared to other elections in the reliably blue state.\n\n— Kevin Breuninger"
