        "text": "Strangely enough, for someone who takes such delight in words, it would be hard to use just one word to describe Donald Lawrence. For the boy who grew up in Gastonia and the man who took his music worldwide is in a constant state of evolution.\n\nWhen it was recently announced he’d been chosen as a member of the newest class of the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame, Lawrence was listed as a songwriter, record producer, vocal coach and artist.\n\nHe’s a walking contradiction. There’s no way to place Donald Lawrence in a simple box.\n\nFiercely independent and driven - “I’m extremely independent, sometimes to a fault. I do everything myself” - the walls of his Chicago home are lined with Grammys and their gospel music equivalent Stellar awards.\n\nYet, in the next moment, he’s quick to point to others – from a rhythm and blues diva to his drama coach at Hunter Huss High School – for playing a role in his success.\n\nLawrence has performed on stage with Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker’s PTL Ministries at the height of the Christian television station’s power and also coached the pop female super group En Vogue on the eve of their first national tour.\n\nThe first group he formed as a teenager in Gastonia – RD&M – would end up having as much star power as the gospel choir Tri-City Singers, which was made up of Gastonia, Charlotte and Spartanburg, South Carolina, talents whose sound he tweaked and delivered to a worldwide audience.\n\nHe knows to embrace the past, admitting “The Andy Griffith Show” remains one of his favorite TV programs and he even gets a little giddy when talking about meeting the show’s namesake at a past Grammy Awards show.\n\nBut he’s also quick to try something new, even if that’s an idea to implement the beats and sound of “new jack swing” – a fusion of hip-hop, R&B and pop – with the dyed-in-the-wool melodies and words of the traditional gospel songs he grew up singing in a strict Pentecostal church.\n\nOne thing is certain: You’ll not find the 59-year-old Lawrence sitting still.\n\n“I don’t want to ever stop working,” he said during a recent phone conversation. “I think when you stop working, you get old. What I do is not work to me. It’s oxygen. I’m a creator and the minute I stop creating is the minute I die.”\n\nBorn May 4, 1961, in Charlotte, Lawrence spent nearly all of his childhood in Gastonia, from age 2 to his graduation from Huss in 1979. He describes himself as an only child “a product of something that happened between two marriages.”\n\nIt was his mother’s sister, Ozella Dunlap-Brown, and godmother, Mamie Edwards, who raised him.\n\n“I really didn’t grow up with my parents at all,” said Lawrence, who believes he gets that drive to succeed from his aunt and the other female members of the Dunlap family.\n\n“They were very driven, resilient. She made sure that I wasn’t weak, and since there was no father there, that I was very independent. If you don’t have a father figure there, a guy can lose that thing of being a leader. She made sure I was a leader.”\n\nAnother who would play a large role in his life was his cousin, Martha Adams. She served as the director of the youth choir at the Mills Chapel Holiness Church in Gastonia where Lawrence first began to sing and learn to play the piano during church services.\n\n“I love her,” he said of Adams. “She was one person who believed in me very much so. She really pushed me a lot. She let me play when others wouldn’t let me play, especially when I was just starting to learn.”\n\nThe church was central to Lawrence’s upbringing.\n\n“I grew up in a strict Pentecostal church so we didn’t get to do a lot of things, but we made good out of what we did get to do,” he said. “It was definitely a life of music. All of my friends were musical. Some reason I really found a love of music and theater.”\n\nHe believes that love of music and theater is genetic and stems from his father’s side of the family.\n\n“My aunt used to say sometimes, ‘Child, I don’t know where you came from.’ I would just do things that she didn’t understand where I picked it up from,” he said.\n\nAt Huss, Lawrence was a member of the choir taught by longtime instructor Carolyn Spencer.\n\nAs a fluke, he opted to take drama as an elective during his senior year. It proved to be a wise decision as he says Brenda Hewes, the Huss drama teacher, would be a strong influence. She ended up casting him as a lead in one of their productions and he ended up winning Best Supporting Actor in a competition.\n\n“That really kind of woke up the theater music in me. I’ve always loved the telling of stories through music,” he said. “She inspired me like she would never, ever know. I would have loved to have told her.”\n\nHuss’ assistant choir director at the time, Daryl Howell, would also play a key role. He noticed Lawrence’s musical talent and arranged for him to study with voice coach Frances Shafter in Charlotte.\n\n“She (Shafter) took a lot of kids that she thought had potential and would have them audition for the top schools in the world. She knew I loved musical theater,” he said.\n\nIn fact, it was Shafter who took Lawrence on his first plane ride, a trip to New York City to audition at New York University. He was offered a scholarship to study drama at NYU, but instead opted to study at the University of Cincinnati College of Conservatory Music, which at the time had the top musical theater program in the nation. He was one of 12 students selected from more than 700 auditions.\n\n“I was a big dreamer,” he said. “I saw Hollywood. I saw Broadway and I saw records. I saw Grammys. I would dream about that stuff. I would always say, ‘I’m not going to get it just by being here.’ As a kid, I just wanted to get out and go and see what the word was like.”\n\nStudies at the Cincinnati Conservatory were tough for the self-taught Lawrence.\n\n“I didn’t really have any formal training, but I had a great ear,” he said. “What they played, I could write out just from hearing it. Since I was a kid, I always had a really good ear. I used my natural ability to pass some theory courses as I was so underprepared to go to the conservatory. I had a lot of catching up to do.”\n\nBut, again, another would notice Lawrence’s talents. This time it was Worth Gardner, who was the head of the college’s musical theater department at the time.\n\n“He just saw something raw in me,” Lawrence said. “While I was there, he loved my gospel music and we talked about creating a show.”\n\nThe gospel musical “Sing Hallelujah!,” featuring Lawrence’s music under Gardner’s direction, opened with rave reviews at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, where it would be sold out over the next three summers. Among those in the audience were famous musical producers, including Jerry Wexler, who Rolling Stone magazine dubbed “the man who invented rhythm and blues.” The show would eventually make it to off-Broadway, debuting at the Village Gate theater in 1987.\n\n“It was me taking gospel music and putting it to theater,” Lawrence said. “I always had a love of music and theater and it just kind of showed up. I just ended up being more of a producer, director, writer.”\n\nAs a teenager at Huss, Lawrence formed his first group, RD&M, with childhood friends Maria Howell and Robin Rowe-Stewart. The group performed in area churches and also at school talent shows. Lawrence would play the piano and sing tenor, while Howell was alto and Rowe-Stewart sang soprano.\n\nNobody knew then the star power of the three.\n\nHowell would go on to become a jazz singer and made her film debut in “The Color Purple” in 1985. An accomplished singer and composer, Howell has gained fame as an actress with more than 50 credits in movies and TV series. Most recently, Howell had a role in the 2019 Hallmark Christmas movie “A Christmas Love Story” that had several scenes filmed in her hometown.\n\nRowe-Stewart and Lawrence would team up many times over the years. After he graduated college, the two would perform as a singing duet for Jim Bakker’s Praise the Lord (PTL) Ministries for a year and she was also a member of the Tri-City Singers.\n\n“People just saw us as brother and sister,” Lawrence said of Rowe-Stewart. “They knew I would write and she would sing. We ended up working together for many years.”\n\nRowe-Stewart died of breast cancer in February 2002. Ironically, her daughter, Brittany Stewart, performs as a touring musician with Lawrence and is also a featured vocalist with the Tri-City Singers.\n\n“Her daughter sounds just like her,” Lawrence said. “It’s unbelievable. It’s almost like the same voice.”\n\nIt was during his time at PTL when Lawrence got his first big break. R&B singer Stephanie Mills had heard a song he’d written titled “Superman” and had loved it. Soon after, she lost her musical director who had just left for a young artist known as Whitney Houston. So, she asked Lawrence to go on tour with her and serve as her musical director.\n\n“At that time, she was probably at the height of her career,” he recalled. “My goal was to go to Broadway. I had no idea or any aspiration to be out on the road with an R&B act.”\n\nIn a surprising move, Lawrence turned her down.\n\n“I’m a Taurus and we don’t want to be the dumbest ones in the room. I knew they had way more experience than I had. To go out there and be the leader? She wasn’t calling me just to come out and play. She was calling me to be the band leader.”\n\nHe hadn’t listened to R&B music as a child and was not familiar with its different rhythms and beats.\n\n“I said, ‘If you will give me a year to really study your music, come back in a year and I’ll do it.’ I didn’t think there was anyway she’d come back. I mean who does that? I was a nobody.”\n\nBut a year later, Mills approached him again. There was a new album and a new tour waiting his direction.\n\n“I was terrified, but I said, ‘yes,’” he said.\n\nHis work on Mills’ tour would lead to him working with En Vogue, coaching them ahead of their Born to Sing Tour in 1991. More importantly, he believes, it was his time with Mills where his sound evolved.\n\n“One of the reason you have the Donald Lawrence you have now, with all of the unique sounds I do, is because I learned that with Stephanie Mills,” he said. “She took a risk on me and it really opened my ear, my head. She was the one person who really set me on my path when it comes to a professional career. I’m always grateful to her. She just threw me in the water and said, ‘Go, I know you can do it.’\n\n“It’s because I did that in another genre that you get the contemporary urban sound. Had I stayed in my regular frame, you wouldn’t have gotten what you get from me now.”\n\nThe Tri-City Singers was an established community choir made up of singers from the Spartanburg, S.C., area when Lawrence came to them with the idea of making a gospel album in 1990. Lawrence brought along some singers from his hometown and Charlotte, including Rowe-Stewart, and started the process of fine-tuning the sound of 40 new voices.\n\n“I just decided to give them this new sound that I had in my head – it was a blend of theater, blend of Luther Vandross, blend of Andrae Crouch, blend of contemporary urban choir and a blend of New Jack City,” Lawrence said.\n\nAfter spending two years on the road serving as Mills’ musical director, Lawrence had an idea for a new sound in a traditional musical genre.\n\n“I wanted to do a choir that had beats,” he said.\n\nTri-City Singers recorded their first album in May 1991 and “A Songwriter’s Point of View” released in March 1993 with its mix of “new jack swing, theater and gospel.”\n\n“The album was so cutting-edge with beats,” he said. “It was so unique and so ahead of its time.”\n\nFor the next 12 years, Lawrence and the Tri-City Singers would make excellent music, producing nine albums that received critical acclaim and No. 1 singles “Encourage Yourself” and “The Blessing of Abraham.” In 2008, Lawrence’s album “Live - One Last Time” was recognized with the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Gospel Album.\n\nThere was also work with the Company. Rodney Barber, Richard Odom and Terry Philips were part of his group Company and performed as background singers on Mills’ tour. They teamed up for the No. 1 hit “Back II Eden.”\n\nIn 2018, the Tri-City Singers reunited for the album “Goshen.” It has a special place for Lawrence, who calls the album “brilliant.” The album was recognized by the Gospel Music Association’s Dove Award for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year. A song off the album, “Deliver Me (This is My Exodus)” received the GMA’s Dove Award for Traditional Gospel Recorded Song of the Year.\n\n“The brand just keeps living,” Lawrence said. “People don’t want to let it go. People just love the choir.”\n\nAnd he believes the message in “Goshen,” on which he was working on in 2015, applies so much to today’s times of racial unrest and uncertainty brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. He said the album offers a “contemporary spin on the Exodus journey” — a story of oppression and people.\n\n“It’s almost like a foretelling,” he said, noting that it’s his hope that his message reaches those across the world. “I just want to give hope to the hopeless and if someone’s oppressed, I want them to be free, wherever that is.”\n\n“I’m always trying to inspire the world. I try to do messages of hope and empowerment. I think words carry an energy and we should always be mindful of what we speak because we were created to be speaking creatures, that’s how God created. He spoke things in existence. I do believe there’s power in our speech.”\n\nSongwriting remains close to his heart.\n\n“I love putting it together, hearing other people sing. I’ve always loved to write. I just like the whole idea of melody structure and putting the story into song. I’m very much an introvert. I think you really get me speaking when I write these songs.”\n\nLawrence believes there’s plenty more to do in his life.\n\n“I’ve just been one of those people who did multiple things,” he said. “I don’t believe in peaks. I just keep evolving.”\n\nHe just finished work as the song producer on the Lifetime movie “The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel,” which is a biographical film on the highest-selling gospel group in music history.\n\n“Goshen” was lined up to be a theatrical production, opening this past spring at the Broadway Playhouse in Chicago but that’s now been delayed by the pandemic. Plans remain to bring the show to the stage and he hopes it will appear in Charlotte.\n\nHe’s a musical director for the McDonald’s Inspiration Celebration Gospel Tour, which starts up this month. And he hopes to do more movies and would love to have a TV show, a sort of spiritual talk show focused on “spiritual psychology” or do more hosting of gospel choir competition shows.\n\nHe’s humbled by the selection for the Hall of Fame, but also proud in that he hopes it creates a legacy.\n\n“I hope that my voice speaks as an encourager and someone who inspired the least to be able to do great things.”\n\nAnd what of that legacy?\n\n“I would hope they say, ‘Donald Lawrence is an empowerer. He would speak to my potential and cause it to become alive,’ because that’s what happened to me. People spoke to my potential when I grew up.\n\n“And even though you grow up in a small town like Gastonia, Belmont or Shelby, there’s one person that will speak to your potential and you will go and do great things around the world. It doesn’t matter where you start. Small beginnings really make for big, big, big dreams and big goals to happen.”\n\nYou can reach Michael Banks at 704-869-1842, email mbanks@gastongazette.com and follow on Twitter @MichaelBanksNC."
