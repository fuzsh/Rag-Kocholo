        "text": "This article is about the character. For other uses, see Donald Duck (disambiguation).\n\nDonald Duck (or simply referred to as \"The Duck\"[14]) is an animated cartoon character created by Walt Disney as a foil to Mickey Mouse.[15] Making his screen debut in The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934, Donald is characterized as a cocky showboat with a brash and juvenile personality. He is normally depicted wearing a sailor suit, cap and a bow-tie. Along with his semi-unintelligible voice (as famously created by his original voice actor, Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash), Donald's most dominant trait is his short temper, which is predominantly expressed through explosive outbursts and fits of quacking and squawking. Much of Donald's anger stems from his exceptionally bad luck, though his misfortunes are often the karmic result of his own arrogance and greed.\n\nDonald garnered universal acclaim as early in his second appearance Orphan's Benefit and quickly became a mainstay in Disney's short films thereafter. His foibles endeared him to audiences, who found the duck's attitude and struggles to be both relatable and entertaining.[16] Animators and artists were also fond of Donald Duck's stories, as the character was allowed to exhibit more negative traits that couldn't be bestowed upon Mickey or the happy-go-lucky Goofy.[17] Beginning with 1937's Don Donald, Donald earned his own series of cartoons, which would introduce recurring characters, such as his girlfriend Daisy Duck, and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\n\nHaving starred in over 190 films, Donald has appeared in more theatrical films than any other Disney character. Several of his cartoons were honored by the Academy Awards, while other notable accolades include a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and cemented footprints at the Chinese Theatre. Part of Donald's widespread popularity can be attributed to his long-running comic book series under the supervision of renowned artists, such as Ted Osborne, Al Taliaferro, Carl Barks, and Don Rosa. These stories depict Donald as living in the city of Duckburg and have been enjoyed by generations of readers on a global scale.\n\nBackground[]\n\nAccording to Don Rosa's timeline, Donald Duck was born in 1920. According to the cartoon, Donald Gets Drafted (1942), Donald's full name is Donald Fauntleroy Duck (his middle name appears to be a reference to his sailor hat, which was a common accessory for \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" suits). The Quack Pack episode \"All Hands on Duck\", the Legend of the Three Caballeros episode \"Sheldgoose Square Dance\" and Disney's website also stated his full name as Donald Fauntleroy Duck. Donald's birthday is officially recognized as June 9, 1934, the day his debut film was released, but in The Three Caballeros (and its subsequent spin-off), his birthday is given as simply \"Friday the 13th\", while in Donald's Happy Birthday, it is elaborated to be March 13th.\n\nAlthough not shown chronologically, Donald's most youthful appearance was a flashback to when he was a hatchling, featured in the animated TV special \"This is Your Life, Donald Duck\" and the comic book story of the same name. In both the animation and the comic, presented by Jiminy Cricket, Donald was shown hatching from his egg and throwing one of his famous tantrums simultaneously, making the losing his temper his first-ever action as a living creature. Only in the comic, it is shown that Donald got his hat from a sailor when he was a baby when his grandmother took him for his first visit to Duckburg.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDonald has been described as a \"problem child\" by Walt Disney. True to this, he is a rather—albeit humorously—controversial character in nature, with his most famous personality trait being his explosive temper. When angered, Donald will pitch a fit of quacking and bouncing in place while flaunting his fists, usually as a threat to whomever (or whatever) caused him his latest annoyance. He is also arrogant and can be quite the show-off, especially when he is skilled at something. This has a tendency to get him into trouble, however, as he often gets in over his head.[19] Much of Donald's comedy comes from his exaggerated rudeness and the repercussions that come with said rudeness. For example, Donald finds enjoyment in bullying, pranking, and humiliating others for his own amusement. What he cannot tolerate, however, is his victims fighting back against him—as such, these battles often lead to Donald's humiliation.[20][21][22]\n\nIn contrast to these negative traits, Donald is—at his core—a warm and loving character. When not dealing with a problem, Donald can be quite jovial and friendly, and he usually tries his hardest to keep his temper under control for the sake of his own contentment, as well as those around him.[23] Additionally, Donald shares a very loving relationship with Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and treats them as his own children, despite their rivalries. The triplets love their \"Unca Donald\", with a particular scene in the first episode of DuckTales showcasing them having a heartfelt goodbye moment as Donald prepares to leave for the navy. Donald also has shown signs of humility, most notably in Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, when Huey, Dewey, and Louie's pranks ruin Christmas for him and the whole family. When the tree falls on Donald, instead of yelling at his nephews, he stays sadly silent, humiliated, and defeated, while Daisy comforts him. When truly faced with the wrongs of his actions, Donald will accept them and find the strength to bring himself to face his mistakes head-on. One of the most prominent displays of this was in Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, where after vandalizing the Mousey Mall's Christmas display out of holiday fatigue, he was visibly horrified by his actions and spent the remainder of the short willingly paying recompense.\n\nFor all his bravado, Donald is secretly insecure about himself. He takes offense to those who cannot understand his voice and is notoriously envious of Mickey Mouse's popularity. Donald's bad luck also plays a part in his low self-esteem, as he sometimes sees himself as a failure due to his frequent mishaps. Donald tends to hide this with a boisterous veneer, though he has confided in Daisy about his inhibition on occasion. Daisy is also one of the very few Disney characters capable of pacifying Donald's psychotic temper, even though she has a temper of her own.[24][25] What Donald sometimes lacks in confidence; he makes up for with perseverance. His aggressive nature can act as a double-edged sword; while at times a hindrance for him, it has also helped him in times of need.[26] When faced with a threat of some kind, Donald may get frightened and even intimidated, but rather than getting scared, he gets mad and has taken up fights with ghosts, sharks, mountain goats, and even the forces of nature and has usually won. In fact, many shorts and cartoons have shown a significant increase in his physical strength and fighting prowess when pushed far enough. He sometimes portrays qualities of a bruiser, being quick to fight his adversaries.\n\nDonald is often portrayed as having great difficulty holding down a job and can be described as a typical \"jack of all trades, master of none\". His attempts at these professions often go comically wrong, with Donald causing one calamity after another.\n\nDonald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out within given situations. \"What's the big idea?\" is a common one, which Donald sarcastically squawks when burdened by another character. \"Aw, phooey!\" is usually exclaimed as a sign of either apathy or defeat. \"So!\" is Donald's usual declaration when confronting someone (or something) antagonizing him. When excited, Donald will often shout, \"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!\"\n\nVoice[]\n\nDonald's voice is one of the most iconic and identifiable voices in all of animation. His form of speech would be duplicated for other characters, such as his girlfriend, Daisy Duck, and his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. However, over the years, these characters (particularly Daisy Duck) were given more distinct voices of their own, most likely to keep Donald's voice a unique aspect to his character.\n\nAs a running gag in most of Donald's appearances, primarily in animation, the other characters around him (especially Mickey) have difficulties understanding Donald, especially when he's upset or in a panic. This often results in Donald's frustration.\n\nDonald's voice was originated and performed by Vaudevillian performer Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash for over 50 years in more than 155 cartoon shorts from The Wise Little Hen in 1934 through to Mickey's Christmas Carol in 1983, which was Nash's last film as Donald. Clarence also provided Donald's voice in several episodes of Walt Disney's \"Disneyland\" television shows, every episode of the original Mickey Mouse Club from 1955 to 1959, educational films, military training films, 78 and 45 rpm records, radio shows, and television commercials for Donald Duck orange juice and other brand food products. Mickey's Christmas Carol didn't mark his final performance as the duck, as Nash would continue to provide Donald's voice in Donald Duck's 50th Birthday in 1984 and other miscellaneous material until his death in 1985. It was largely Donald's unique and semi-intelligible speech that would cement his image into audiences' minds and help fuel both Donald and Nash's rises to stardom.\n\nDisneyland announcer Jack Wagner voiced Donald in live shows, such as Disney On Ice, in the 1980s.\n\nSince 1985, Tony Anselmo is the current official voice of Donald. An animator for Disney, Anselmo befriended Nash during his early time with the company and was mentored by him on Donald's voice. Nash trained Anselmo with the intention of having Anselmo replace him as the voice of Donald Duck, as Nash had leukemia, which Anselmo was unaware of. He took over the role following Nash's death.[27] Anselmo was later approved by the Disney Character Voice Department, which was created in 1988 by Roy E. Disney to ensure the consistency of Disney classic characters, allowing only one official voice per character.[28] He has voiced Donald in various Disney products and media featuring the character, including television, feature films, theme parks, video games, Disney cruise lines, and consumer products.\n\nIn Mickey and the Roadster Racers/Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures and its spin-off series Chip n' Dale's Nutty Tales and Mickey Mouse: Hot Diggity Dog Tales, and the specials Mickey's Tale of Two Witches and Mickey and Minnie Wish Upon a Christmas, Donald was voiced by Daniel Ross.\n\nIn Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life, Donald's non-speaking vocal effects were supplied by Sylvain Caruso, the official French dub voice of the character since 1989.\n\nDonald's unique and semi-intelligible voice was the focus of the short Donald's Dream Voice, where the detest for the duck's voice prompts him to purchase pills capable of temporarily enhancing his vocal cords incredibly. Leslie Denison provided the sophisticated, suave voice that these pills would give him. A similar instance occurred in the DuckTales episode \"The Shadow War!\", in which Donald's artificially intelligible voice was provided by Don Cheadle. Cheadle reprised the role in the episode \"Quack Pack!\". In the Christmas episode \"Last Christmas!\" from the same series, a time-traveling sequence shows a young Donald, voiced by Russi Taylor, using the same voice she used for Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Dominic Lewis provides his singing voice in the episode \"Louie's Eleven!\" in an uncredited role. In \"The First Adventure!\", Cristina Vee replaces Russi Taylor as the voice of young Donald after the latter's death.\n\nHistory[]\n\n1930s-1940s[]\n\nDonald was created by Walt Disney when he heard Clarence Nash doing a peculiar voice while reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\". Nash described the voice as that of a baby goat. Walt, however, insisted that it was a duck. Using Nash's performance as a reference, Walt's duck character was steadily designed and developed into a character named \"Donald Duck\".[16][29] Donald Duck was first mentioned in a 1931 Disney storybook, while an early design of the character appeared as an illustration in the book's back cover. The character made his first animated appearance in The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934, where he and his friend, Peter Pig, lie their way out of helping the titular little hen tend to her corn. Donald's appearance in the cartoon, as created by animators Art Babbitt and Dick Huemer, is similar to his modern look; the feather and beak colors are the same, as is the blue sailor shirt and hat, but his features are more elongated, his body plumper, and his feet bigger. His iconic voice, done by its originator Clarence Nash, is also the same. Notably, the manner of speech in which the characters' voices are based on their respective animals is used for every character, rather than being a trait belonging solely to Donald. Donald's personality is not developed either; in the short, he merely fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story.\n\nBert Gillett, director of The Wise Little Hen, brought Donald back in his Mickey Mouse cartoon Orphan's Benefit on August 11, 1934. The cartoon features Donald as one of the performers for Mickey's stage show for a group of orphans. Donald's act is to recite the poems Mary Had a Little Lamb and Little Boy Blue, but every time he tries, the mischievous orphans humiliate him, leading the duck to fly into a squawking fit of anger. This explosive personality would remain with Donald for decades to come. Although Orphan's Benefit was Donald's second appearance, the film was the first to significantly develop his character. Many of Donald's personality traits first seen in Orphan's Benefit would become permanently associated with him, such as his love of showmanship, his fierce determination, belligerence, and most famously his easily provoked temper. The film also introduced some of Donald's physical shticks, such as his signature temper tantrum of hopping on one foot while holding out one fist and swinging the other. This was the creation of animator Dick Lundy, who termed this Donald's \"fighting pose\".\n\nDonald continued to be a hit with audiences. The character began appearing in most Mickey Mouse cartoons as a regular member of the ensemble with Mickey, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, and Pluto. Cartoons from this period, such as the 1935 cartoon The Band Concert in which Donald repeatedly disrupts the Mickey Mouse Orchestra's rendition of The William Tell Overture by playing Turkey in the Straw are regularly hailed by critics as exemplary films and classics of animation. Animator Ben Sharpsteen also minted the classic Mickey, Donald, and Goofy comedy in 1935, with the cartoon Mickey's Service Station. After the success of Mickey's Service Station, Donald would often be grouped with Mickey and Goofy in several shorts, where the trio's laughable flaws would cause mayhem to befall upon them. Some of the most renowned include Clock Cleaners (1937), Lonesome Ghosts (1937), and Mickey's Trailer (1938). In late 1935, animator Fred Spencer wrote a comprehensive analysis establishing Donald's personality and physical mannerisms. Spencer was regarded as a leading authority in the early development of Donald's character, having both animated and evolved the duck throughout the 1930s.[30]\n\nDonald was redesigned in 1936 to be a bit fuller, rounder, and cuter, starting from Moving Day (1936). He also began starring in solo cartoons, the first of these being Don Donald, released on January 9, 1937. This short also marked the first appearance of Daisy Duck (here called \"Donna Duck\"), as well as Donald's car, 313. Daisy went on to become Donald's longtime love interest and a recurring co-star in his cartoons, mirroring the relationship between Mickey and Minnie.\n\nDonald's nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, would make their first animated appearance in the 1938 film Donald's Nephews, directed by Jack King (they had earlier been introduced in the Donald Duck comic strip). The nephews were the source of some controversy within the studio. According to Carl Barks, \"Most of us guys in the duck unit felt the introduction of three nephews would hamper the development of Donald's character as it was then being channeled. We couldn't see that it would lead to a sort of duck dynasty completely divorced from the Mickey Mouse influence. I recall some comments about it being too early in Don's career to clutter him with a family.\"[31] Gus Goose, Donald's gluttonous cousin, would later debut in Donald's Cousin Gus (1939), also directed by King.\n\n1940s-1950s[]\n\nBy the 1940s, Donald had surpassed Mickey Mouse as the studio's most popular character. Donald's notoriety was such that Walt Disney referred to the duck as the \"Gable of our stable\", in reference to the renowned Hollywood actor, Clark Gable.[32] Animators found it easier to develop gags and story ideas surrounding Donald in comparison to Mickey, who had been relegated to a \"role model\" in response to negative feedback from parents of the time. According to Jack Hannah, there were several cartoons developed specifically for Mickey, that were later rewritten to instead feature Donald.[17] Hannah explained, \"I remember many stories were started with Mickey, but as soon as they started to rough the mouse up, somebody would come up and say, 'Well, that's more of a Donald Duck story' so they'd turn around and make it a Donald Duck story.\"[17] Furthermore, beginning with 1938's Polar Trappers, Mickey was omitted from a number of the \"team-up\" shorts and Donald would instead appear alongside Goofy as a double act. The \"Donald & Goofy\" pairing would continue until Crazy with the Heat in 1947, though Mickey would return on rare occasions, such as The Whalers (1938) and Tugboat Mickey (1940).\n\nEarly into World War II, Walt Disney was approached by governing bodies to create propaganda films for the purposes of eliciting civic aid in the war effort. Donald Duck, widely regarded as the studio's poster boy of the time, starred in multiple wartime cartoons exemplifying acts of patriotism. Donald's Decision (1941) saw Donald reinvest his savings in war bonds. The New Spirit (1942) and The Spirit of '43 (1943) encouraged timely payment of income tax. Donald Gets Drafted (1942) was the first in a series that chronicled Donald's experiences in the U.S. Army, under the overbearing authority of Sergeant Pete. The most popular of these wartime-era films was Der Fuehrer's Face, released in 1943 and directed by Jack Kinney. Centered on Donald's nightmare as a prisoner forced to serve Nazi Germany, the short became the first, and only Donald Duck cartoon to win an Academy Award. Walt Disney also approved to have Donald serve as a mascot for the Army Air Corps and U.S. Coast Guard, in which he was portrayed as a patriotic pirate. Donald was officially relieved of duty in 1984, receiving an honorable discharge in honor of his 50th anniversary. To commemorate his retirement, a ceremony and parade were held in Torrance, California.[33]\n\nIn 1942, Western Publishing began creating original comic-book stories about Donald and other Disney characters. Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these, a story called Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold (adapted from the storyboards of the unproduced animated film Morgan's Ghost, starring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy). The new publisher meant new illustrators, in this case, Carl Barks and Jack Hannah. Barks soon took over the major development of the comic book adventures of the duck as both writer and illustrator. Under his pen, Donald's everyman persona was further developed, and, aside from comedic stories, Barks' comics would place Donald in longer adventure stories, often taking place in either the fictional city of Duckburg or exotic locations around the world. Pete was the only other major character from the Mickey Mouse comic strip to feature in Barks' new series of Donald Duck comics. As the comics developed, Barks created new characters to inhabit Duckburg alongside Donald and the nephews. Chief among them was Donald's miserly uncle, Scrooge McDuck, whom Barks introduced in the comic story Christmas on Bear Mountain in December of 1947. Other notable relatives included Grandma Duck (1940) and Gladstone Gander (1948).\n\nAfter the success of Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1938), development and early planning had begun for several animated feature films intended to follow suit. However, the disruption of World War II forced Walt Disney Studios into a standstill, only having the limited ability to produce package films and propaganda short subjects. There was a particular interest in the South America market, primarily due to the inability to import cartoons into Occupied Europe as a result of the war. Donald, with his stardom rising, would appear in four of the package films—three of which were set in South America. The first was 1943's Saludos Amigos, which was notable for marking Donald's first appearance in a full-length feature film, as well as introducing the character of José Carioca, a Brazilian parrot. In 1944, Donald and José were paired with a trigger-happy rooster named Panchito Pistoles to form the titular trio in The Three Caballeros. Donald's final two appearances in the package film era included Fun and Fancy Free in 1947 (opposite Mickey and Goofy in the Mickey and the Beanstalk segment) and 1948's Melody Time (alongside José Carioca and the Aracuan Bird).\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, focus within the Donald Duck unit shifted to developing new adversaries for the duck. The most popular were Chip and Dale, a pair of chipmunks who had previously appeared as antagonists to Pluto in Private Pluto (1943) and Squatter's Rights (1946). Donald would first encounter the mischievous rodents in the 1947 short Chip an' Dale, directed by Jack Hannah. The formula proved so popular that the trio would appear together in a total of 18 theatrical shorts between 1947 and 1956. The Aracuan Bird from The Three Caballeros would also return, serving as a foil to Donald in Clown of the Jungle (1947).\n\n1950s-1990s[]\n\nWhile many theatrical short subject series ended production during the 1953-1954 season, Donald Duck continued to appear in theatrical cartoons after that season. Between 1954-1956, the majority of Donald Duck's final cartoons were produced in CinemaScope widescreen format (2:35:1) as opposed to the standard Academy ratio and format (1:37:1), in an attempt for his cartoons to compete against the growing popularity of television at the time. The 1950s also marked Walt Disney's entry into television, in which Donald would become a staple. He was cast as the gong ringer in 1955's Mickey Mouse Club, in which Donald would make numerous attempts to usurp Mickey's spotlight during the \"Mickey Mouse March\". Donald would also make regular appearances in Walt Disney's Disneyland anthology series. Donald's appearances throughout the show were accomplished by combining live-action and animation; in such episodes as \"The Donald Duck Story\" (1954) and \"The Plausible Impossible\" (1956), an animated Donald would directly interact with Walt Disney. In \"A Day in the Life of Donald Duck\" (1956), Donald, having grown disillusioned by fan mail criticizing his voice, engaged in an onscreen fight with his voice actor, Clarence Nash.\n\nIn 1958, Donald co-hosted the 30th Academy Awards ceremony alongside a number of popular film personalities at the time.\n\nThe final Donald Duck short in the original theatrical run was 1961's The Litterbug. When Walt Disney's anthology series was rebranded as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color for NBC in 1961, the studio had since converted to the Xerox animation process as a cost-cutting measure following the financial failure of Sleeping Beauty (1959). Walt Disney was a noted critic of this technique, and was hesitant to feature either Donald or Mickey in the style in fear that it would \"cheapen the character.\"[34] Donald's polymathic uncle, Professor Ludwig Von Drake, was created as a compromise. In \"The Hunting Instinct\" (1961), Walt Disney described Von Drake as hailing from the \"continental branch\" of the Duck family. Donald and the professor would share the screen on numerous occasions thereafter, most extensively in \"Inside Donald Duck\" (1962).\n\nFollowing Walt Disney's death in 1966. Donald would continue to appear in a number of educational films (including Donald in Mathmagic Land, How to Have an Accident at Work, and Donald's Fire Survival Plan) a commercial and, a family educational program until entering retirement.\n\nDonald wouldn't reappear again until the 1983 short Mickey's Christmas Carol, where he played the role of Nephew Fred. This was Clarence Nash's final theatrical portrayal of Donald, before passing away in 1985. The mantle would be passed down to animator Tony Anselmo, whom Nash had trained for the role for several years prior to his death.\n\nIn 1984, Donald reached his 50th anniversary, which was commemorated with several events—Donald Duck's 50th Birthday aired on television; the Academy Awards held a special tribute to Donald, which Clarence Nash attended in Donald's honor; in May, Donald's footprints were marked in cement in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theater.\n\nIn 1987, Donald was the focus of Down and Out with Donald Duck, a television special in which he was fired from Disney due to his unstable temper. That same year, DuckTales premiered on television, on which Donald was an occasional guest star, despite the series starring his three nephews and Uncle Scrooge. Donald's limited role in the series was a result of two factors; for one, the Disney company was very protective of their mainline characters and feared that featuring Donald on daily television would lead to overexposure. In a later interview, some of the crew members of DuckTales mentioned that they had wanted Donald to make more appearances, but that Disney was reluctant to let them do so, recalling the numerous meetings in which they asked whether they could bring Donald onto the show again, and how these requests were only rarely accepted, with David Block jokingly referring to Donald as Disney's \"sacred cow\"[35]. Secondly, it is said that producers believed Donald's voice in thirty-minute episodes would put too much strain on viewers.[36]\n\nIn 1988, Donald appeared at the 60th Academy Awards, where Mickey was set to present the award for Best Short. Believing he was to co-present, Donald joined Mickey on the stage but was furious to find that the position was already taken by a human. Donald was also among the cartoon characters to feature in the live-action/animated hybrid film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), directed by Robert Zemeckis.\n\n1990s-present[]\n\nIn the 1990 short, The Prince and the Pauper, Donald appeared as the valet of the prince (played by Mickey Mouse). Tony Anselmo notably had a hand in animating Donald in the featurette.\n\nIn 1996, Donald was given his own sitcom series as part of the Disney Afternoon block with Quack Pack, in which he is the suburban guardian of a teenage Huey, Dewey, and Louie. The show was poorly received, however, and only lasted for one season.\n\nIn 1999, Donald starred in the Noah's Ark segment of Fantasia 2000—a role inspired by Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprentice. 1999 also marked the debut of Mickey Mouse Works, which gave Donald a new series of made-for-television shorts; one of which, Opera Box, was screened theatrically with Doug's 1st Movie. These shorts were later repackaged in the 2001-03 sitcom House of Mouse, which cast Donald as the titular club's co-owner and doorman.\n\nIn 2002, Donald and Goofy co-starred in Kingdom Hearts, an action role-playing video game developed by SquareSoft. According to series director Tetsuya Nomura, Disney initially campaigned to have Donald serve as the game's main protagonist, while SquareSoft instead wanted to use Mickey. The opposing views were rectified with the creation of an original protagonist, Sora.[37] Donald would nevertheless appear as a major character in the game, and a majority of its follow-up titles, as the cantankerous court magician of King Mickey who, alongside Goofy, aids Sora on his adventures.\n\nIn 2003, Donald was given his own theme park attraction in Walt Disney World, Mickey's Philharmagic. A 4D film developed in collaboration between Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Philharmagic sees Donald jettisoned across various Disney musical sequences in pursuit of Mickey's sorcerer hat. Most of Donald's dialogue is compiled from archival recordings of Clarence Nash. Tony Anselmo recorded only five new lines for the character in this attraction (such as when Donald hums to the tune of the song \"Be Our Guest\"). Along with a brief gag in \"Computer.don\" (2000), the attraction marked one of the earliest examples of Donald appearing in CGI; this was followed by the direct-to-video holiday film Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (2004) and the preschool television series Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006).\n\nIn 2005, Donald received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, joining other characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Snow White. The star is located at 6840 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nIn 2012, Donald appeared in the animated short starring Minnie Mouse, Electric Holiday, as a brief cameo talking to one of the models.\n\nFrom 2013-2019, Donald made regular appearances in a revival series of Mickey Mouse cartoons, directed by Paul Rudish.\n\nIn 2017, a DuckTales reboot premiered on Disney's linear television networks. Loosely inspired by the original Barks comics, Donald is portrayed as a retired adventurer who has since become estranged from Scrooge McDuck following a tragedy involving Donald's sister, Della Duck. In Della's place, Donald has assumed the role of the sole guardian and caretaker of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Despite Donald's best efforts to avoid danger at all costs, the nephews and their inherited sense of adventure draws the family back to Scrooge while gradually unraveling the mystery behind Della's disappearance. When developing Donald's character for the series, Frank Angones cited Bill Farmer's performance as Goofy in A Goofy Movie (1995) as inspiration, regarding it as the \"gold standard\" of humanizing Disney's classic characters. The reboot depicts Donald as wearing a black sailor suit with four gold buttons, reminiscent of his design in the Barks comics. According to Matt Youngberg, Donald was the most difficult character to design for the show; \"when you have a character as iconic as Donald Duck, you can't go too far from his original design, or it's the uncanny valley. As you're trying to change Donald Duck, if he's not still Donald in some way, he's broken.\"[38]\n\nAn all-new animated series starring Donald, Legend of the Three Caballeros, premiered in 2018. Inspired by 1944's The Three Caballeros feature film, the show follows Donald, José and Panchito as they embark on fantastical exploits under the mentorship of Xandra, the Goddess of Adventure. The show portrays Donald as a “reluctant hero”, whose participation in Xandra’s adventures are primarily driven by his own greed and selfish ambition. The serialized story involves an overarching character arc for Donald, in which he must confront his personal shortcomings and become a true hero. According to series' director, Matt Danner, one of the challenges of pitching the show was convincing Disney executives that Donald \"is a pretty bad person.\" Danner explained, \"I made a super cut of Donald's lying, cheating, violent acts, cruelty, torture of small animals, etc. I will never forget the look of shock on their faces.\"[39] When developing the show’s story, the producers were inspired by Don Rosa’s iteration of Donald Duck’s family tree to explore aspects of Donald’s heritage that hadn’t previously appeared in animation, such as Donald’s grandfather Clinton Coot.[40] The show ran for thirteen episodes and lasted for one season.\n\nSince 2019, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios has produced multiple stop-motion animated holiday specials featuring Donald, Mickey and the gang. Donald played the lead role in Mickey and Friends: Trick or Treats (2023), in which his greed inadvertently drives Witch Hazel to unleash a curse that transforms everyone into their Halloween costumes.\n\nDonald was featured in the centennial short film Once Upon a Studio (2023), where Mickey and Minnie gather the Disney characters to take a commemorative group photo. Donald is first seen being forced to hold the elevator door for Flash, the sloth from Zootopia. After Flash finally makes it, the large and huggable Baymax from Big Hero 6 also squeezes into the already-crowded shaft, much to Donald's annoyance. Donald later appears during the finale, seen standing beside Daisy as the Disney characters join together in singing \"When You Wish Upon a Star\".\n\nIn 2024, Walt Disney Animation Studios commemorated Donald's 90th anniversary with the traditionally-animated short D.I.Y. Duck, directed by veteran animator Mark Henn, in which Donald's attempts at home improvement quickly spiral into a series of comical catastrophes. The short utilizes archival recordings of Clarence Nash and is significant for being the studio's first Donald Duck cartoon since 1961's The Litterbug. Donald also starred in an episode of Disney Channel’s How NOT to Draw, which sees multiple incarnations of Donald battling each other over a birthday cake drawn by an offscreen animator voiced by John Stamos. Donald will also be a guest in a live-action/animated hybrid episode of the YouTube talk show Hot Ones.[41]\n\nFilms[]\n\nSaludos Amigos[]\n\nDonald's first film was Saludos Amigos. In the first part of the film, Donald visits the famous real-life lake of Lake Titicaca, located at the border of Peru and Bolivia. He looks around, learns about the lake's traditions and makes a failed attempt at sailing a boat before setting off on a journey through the mountains atop a llama. He panics when the llama is busy walking across a wooden suspended bridge, eventually resulting in his fall. He lands in a pottery shop, shattering some pots and taking others with him.\n\nIn the second, Donald meets and befriends the suave José Carioca, during his trip to Brazil. Being a huge fan of Donald's, José immediately offers to take the duck into a tour through the town, showing him the rhythm of the samba, the fine wine, and one of the popular clubs.\n\nThe Three Caballeros[]\n\nDonald reappears in The Three Caballeros, a 1944 sequel to Saludos Amigos. The film consists of several segments, connected by a common theme. In the film, it is Donald Duck's birthday, and he receives three presents from friends in Latin America. The first present is a film projector, which shows him a documentary on birds. During the documentary, he learns about the Aracuan Bird. The next present is a book given to Donald by José Carioca himself. This book tells of Bahia, which is one of Brazil's 26 states. José shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. Donald and José meet up with several of the locals, who dance the samba. Donald ends up pining for one girl. After the journey, Donald and José leave the book.\n\nUpon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. José shows Donald how to use black magic to return himself to the proper size. After opening the present, he meets Panchito Pistoles, a native of Mexico. The three take the name \"The Three Caballeros\" and have a short celebration. Panchito then presents Donald's present, a piñata. Pancho tells Donald of the tradition behind the piñata. José and Panchito then blindfold Donald and have him attempt to break open the piñata, which eventually reveals many surprises. The celebration ends with Donald Duck being fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a bull (the firecrackers are lit by José with his cigar).\n\nFun and Fancy Free[]\n\nIn the segment Mickey and the Beanstalk, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy portray three commoners living in the wasteland formerly known as the prosperous and beautiful Happy Valley. Living in deep poverty and bordering death by starvation, Donald begins losing his sanity, though Mickey decides to sell their cow in exchange for food. However, he returns with only three beans, said to be magic, much to Donald's complete and utter frustration. After discarding them, the beans grow into a beanstalk, accidentally taking the trio to the castle of Willie the Giant, the villain responsible for the despair their kingdom is facing due to kidnapping their ruler, the Golden Harp. After discovering her, the heroes decide to rescue their queen but are soon discovered. After escaping the chest Willie has imprisoned them in, they retrieve the harp and make way down the beanstalk to the kingdom, though Willie is in hot pursuit. Donald and Goofy cut the beanstalk once they reach its end, sending Willie toppling down to his defeat. With the harp rescued and returned home, peace is restored to the land.\n\nMickey's Once Upon a Christmas[]\n\nDonald appears in the traditional animated Christmas film as a supporting character. He first appears in the first segment, Donald Duck: Stuck on Christmas, where Huey, Dewey, and Louie wish for a Christmas every day. Little did they know, Christmas every day would become mundane and beyond annoying, and although they were aware of the course, Donald and the rest of the family was oblivious. Eventually, in an attempt to end the cycle, the boys decide to \"liven things up\", causing mayhem, playing nasty pranks and destruction throughout one of the repeated Christmas days, unintentionally causing despair to fall upon their well-meaning family. Donald even uncharacteristically blames himself for everything that happened. In the end, the boys finally learn the true meaning of Christmas and do their best to make it the grandest they've ever experienced, going as far as to using their snowboard gifts from Donald to create a new sled-boat, much to their uncle's surprise and happiness, and with their lesson learned, the spell is finally broken. After the last segment, Donald makes a cameo with the other characters, singing a melody of Christmas carols as a grand finale.\n\nFantasia 2000[]\n\nDonald stars in his own segment set to the March \"Pomp and Circumstance\". In this chapter of the feature, he is the assistant to Noah and the husband of Daisy Duck. A powerful storm is near, and Donald must round up all the animals (including two non-anthropomorphic ducks) onto the Ark. While checking, Donald realizes Daisy isn't aboard the ark. He rushes back to the hut to get her and doesn't notice her walk right past him into the ark. However, a giant wave arrives, and Donald runs back to the Ark trying to escape it. From the Ark's window, Daisy witnesses Donald trying to escape the wave and covers her eyes in fear, failing to see Donald jumping aboard at the last minute. When Donald is aboard, he sees his and Daisy's house being swept away with, he thinks, Daisy in it. Both Donald and Daisy believe each other to be dead.\n\nAfter the rain stops, Donald sends out a male dove to check for land, while in the process angrily pulling him away from his mate when he tries to sneak back without leaving. When the female dove starts crying, Donald thinks of Daisy and how much he misses her more and more. Elsewhere on the Ark, Daisy feels the same.\n\nWhen the Ark lands, Donald looks out as the animals climb off. Noah ruffles Donald's head feathers affectionately as he walks by him. Donald pulls out a picture of him and Daisy and looks at it sadly. Daisy is walking down the plank when she realizes that her locket with a picture of her and Donald inside has fallen off its chain. Donald is sweeping inside the Ark and sees the locket on the floor. He and Daisy reach for it at the same time and see each other. They are both overjoyed to see that the other is alive. Daisy kisses Donald as they walk away together, holding hands and admiring their new home under a rainbow.\n\nMickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers[]\n\nDonald is a janitor in Paris, France. Like Mickey & Goofy, he dreams of becoming a musketeer after being rescued by Aramis, Athos, Porthos, & D'artangian as a child. The only thing standing in Donald's way is the fact that he's a complete coward in the face of real danger. Pete, the leader of the musketeers, plots to take over France and after Princess Minnie demands bodyguards he uses Donald, Mickey, & Goofy believing they'll do a terrible job. Donald meets the princess and develops a crush on her assistant Daisy, so he initially strikes a pose to her by saluting her, but she was not interested until the end).\n\nAfter proving themselves worthy by defeating the Beagle Boys, Donald is kidnapped in the middle of the night by the Beagle Boys while Goofy is kidnapped by Pete's lieutenant Clarabelle. The Beagle Boys take Donald to Pete's lair, where the duck is nearly decapitated. Fortunately, he escapes his death and rushes back to the palace to warn Mickey. Mickey, however, wants to stay in his job, but the fear of Pete prompts Donald to quit. Later on, Goofy, who was freed by his newfound love Clarabelle, convinces Donald to change his mind and the duo rushes to help Mickey.\n\nAfter the princess is saved, Donald and Daisy proclaim their mutual love and along with Mickey and Goofy, Donald becomes a royal musketeer.\n\nMickey's Twice Upon a Christmas[]\n\nIn the 2004 computer-animated sequel to Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Donald appears in the first, second, fourth and fifth stories.\n\nIn the first story Belles on Ice, Donald attends the skating competition with Daisy and tries to no avail to calm down his girlfriend when she gets furious at Minnie for being in the spotlight and could do nothing but watch with shock and disapproval as Daisy does everything to out-perform Minnie and when this escalates to Minnie tripping on a Christmas bell, Donald is left saddened by how his girlfriend's actions had accidentally hurt their friend Minnie. However, his mood quickly becomes happy when Daisy makes up with Minnie and works together to make the festival better.\n\nIn the second story called Christmas: Impossible, Donald is pranked by his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, repeatedly. At first, he can tolerate their antics but things get worse and Donald instantly snaps when they stole all the cookies, angrily sending them off to their bedroom without giving them a chance to prove they did not do it and immediately about to rage at his nephews when they shamelessly revealed their act by stating the cookies were delicious, even furiously struggling against his girlfriend and uncle to punish them when Daisy and Scrooge restrained him. His nephews realize they need to put their names on Santa's Good List themselves, as they are on the Naughty List this year. At the end of the segment, Donald's mood gets progressively worse, starting from being annoyed when a piece of the wrapper of Scrooge's Christmas present gets on his head and being desperate to find his present, only to find out his only gift was The Big Book of Manners, leaving him utterly annoyed and not at all being amused by Daisy's laugh, and when Scrooge plays his bagpipes, Donald does not hesitate to unceremoniously rip apart the pages and using them to block his ear.\n\nDonald later appears in his own segment, Donald's Gift, where he is exhausted, wanting nothing more than to relax in peace with a cup of hot cocoa; however, he is annoyed by We Wish You a Merry Christmas playing continuously. Donald tries relaxing with a cup of cocoa until Daisy made him go with her to Mousey's holiday display with the boys. Donald, still tired, becomes increasingly angered when he starts hearing the song from everywhere around him multiple times; this leads to him damaging the Mousey's display in a panic to end it. This causes Daisy and his nephews to turn their backs on him out of absolute disgust for what he did despite his frantic attempts to apologize. After being thrown out of the mall by a police officer who berates his lack of Christmas spirit, Donald, being left alone sadly, contemplates on his actions that had not only cost his family and girlfriend to lose the respect for him but also ruined Christmas celebration in the mall. Guilty and realizing that the unceremonious destruction of the mall's Christmas display is his fault, Donald walks home broken-spirited and can't even muster the spirit to join Daisy, Huey, Louie, and Dewey in a restaurant that sold his favorite hot cocoa. However, he later redeems himself when he finds an off-key chorus attempting to sing the song and although annoyed by their singing, teaches them to sing in harmony, earning him Daisy and his nephews' respect again. After apologizing to everyone for damaging the display, Donald joins the townspeople convened around a Christmas tree singing \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\".\n\nDonald also appears alongside the others in the fifth and final segment of the film Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas, in which he joins the search party for Pluto. After Pluto is found on Mickey's roof by Huey, Dewey, and Louie, everyone (including himself) head into Mickey's house for Mickey's Christmas gathering to sing Christmas carols. Donald, funnily enough, begins to sing We Wish You a Merry Christmas, which he initially showed no appreciation for in the earlier segment.\n\nOther animated films[]\n\nDonald also appears in Melody Time, in the sixth segment called \"Blame It on the Samba\", where he and José are seen moping in a cafe. The Aracuan Bird sees them both and introduces them to the Samba, which manages to cheer them up.\n\nIn Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Donald made an appearance at the Ink and Paint Club competing against his rival and Warner Bros. counterpart, Daffy Duck in a \"dueling pianos\" act, as both are playing \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\". He also appears at the end of the movie when the toon characters look at the melted remains of Judge Doom.\n\nIn The Little Mermaid, Donald made a cameo with Mickey and Goofy at the beginning of the film, in the crowd of merpeople who were waiting for the concert of Ariel and her sisters. They can be briefly spotted before King Triton illuminates the coral chandelier.\n\nIn A Goofy Movie, Donald made a silent cameo appearance where he can be seen hitchhiking with Mickey during the song \"On the Open Road\".\n\nIn James and the Giant Peach, a skeletal duck resembling Donald appears.\n\nDonald was also briefly seen on Weebo the Robot's monitor (via archive footage) in the live-action film Flubber.\n\nIn The Lion King 1½, Donald makes a silhouetted cameo at the end and is heard quacking angrily at Stitch as he bounces on top of Donald's head while making his way to his seat.\n\nDonald appears as a plush toy in Giulia's room in Luca.\n\nTelevision[]\n\nThe Wonderful World of Disney[]\n\nThroughout the 36-year run of the Walt Disney anthology television series, Donald played a central role in many of the specials that originally aired as episodes of the series. These particular specials were all compilation films consisting of various classic shorts featuring Donald, bridged together by new linking animation. Episodes of the series that focused on Donald include The Donald Duck Story, A Present for Donald, A Day in the Life of Donald Duck, At Home with Donald Duck, Donald's Award, Duck for Hire, Two Happy Amigos, This is Your Life, Donald Duck, Kids is Kids, Inside Donald Duck, and Donald Takes a Holiday.\n\nIn On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends, Jiminy Cricket has to call the armed forces to search for Donald and bring him to the studio, and in Mickey's 60th Birthday, Donald demands to be featured in Mickey's birthday special; this leads to Donald being falsely accused of kidnapping Mickey when the mouse seemingly goes missing.\n\nThe Mouse Factory[]\n\nDonald made recurring appearances in the live-action wrap-around skits alongside the other costumed characters and celebrity guests.\n\nDuckTales[]\n\nDonald had a rather small part in the television series DuckTales. There, Donald joins the Navy and leaves his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie with his Uncle Scrooge, who then has to take care of them. Donald appears in two parts of the series premiere \"Treasure of the Golden Suns\", as well as the Season 1 episodes \"Sphinx for the Memories\", \"Home Sweet Homer\", \"Catch as Cash Can\", \"Spies in Their Eyes\", \"All Ducks on Deck\", and \"Till Nephews Do Us Part\". Aside from making physical appearances, Donald is often mentioned by the other characters in the series, usually by the nephews and Scrooge.\n\nDonald makes non-physical appearances in \"Scroogerello\", as an illustration in Webby Vanderquack's wristwatch, and in DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp, where a picture frame of him can be seen briefly in Scrooge's home when Webby wishes that everything was back to normal.\n\nQuack Pack[]\n\nSix years after DuckTales ended, Donald starred in his own Disney Afternoon television show called Quack Pack. This series featured a modernized Duck family. Donald was no longer wearing his sailor suit and hat, but instead wore a Hawaiian shirt (which he would wear again as Maui Mallard in the video game Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow). Following the conclusion of his naval tour of duty (disregarding a single day he was later forced to shore up in the episode \"All Hands on Duck\"), Donald has taken up residence in Duckburg, serves as the primary caretaker of the now-teenage Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and still continues to date Daisy. No other Duck family members besides Ludwig Von Drake appear in Quack Pack, and most of the other Duckburg citizens are now humans and only a small amount of anthropomorphic animals.\n\nIn the series' storyline, Donald works under the narcissistic Kent Powers as a cameraman for the latter's television series entitled What in the World? a new show that features Daisy as a reporter, also working under Kent. Donald's job is often complicated by his fun-loving tendencies, his perpetual bad luck, and the strong contempt directed at him from Kent, who uses every possible opportunity to fire Donald to no avail. Ironically, the one time Kent finally managed to rid himself of Donald, every last replacement turned out to be far worse than him. Unlike the other series, he and Daisy have a more better and steady relationship.\n\nThough the show mainly focused on Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Donald appeared in every episode and several of the episodes revolved around him. These included \"Leader of the Quack\", where Donald was revealed to be the ruler of the country of Quaintinia after accidentally saving the land from a dragon during a vacation. In \"Snow Place to Hide\", Donald's terrible jealousy is put into the front when he suspects Daisy is having a romantic rendezvous with Kent Powers.\n\nMickey Mouse Works[]\n\nDonald next played an important role in Mickey Mouse Works. Here, Donald returns to wearing his blue sailor suit as seen in the later-1940s and 1950s cartoons as his trademark outfit, except that this time his black bow tie is now colored red like in the comics.\n\nIn the Mouse Works shorts, his role was more or less the same as in the classic shorts. In these shorts, though, he garnered a new adversary in the form of a baby turtle named Shelby, whom he would often have to look after and have a hard time doing so. The series also featured Donald in a series of mini-shorts titled Donald's Dynamite, in which his activities are interrupted by the appearance of a bomb that he then has to try and rid himself of.\n\nAt the end of the show's intro in each episode, Donald would attempt to display a large sign reading \"Starring Donald Duck\" or \"Duck Works\" covering the show's logo in an attempt to steal the spotlight for himself, but an accident would occur, harming Donald and ridding the sign.\n\nHouse of Mouse[]\n\nDonald appears once again in the series House of Mouse as a greeter and co-owner of the club. In the series, Donald secretly despises Mickey's role as the leader and wishes to someday be in charge, but lets his friendship proven to be greater. A recurring gag in the series is other characters referring to Donald as \"Dooald\", sometimes by mistake and other times to annoy him.\n\nSeveral episodes revolve around Donald. In \"Donald's Pumbaa Prank\", after an April Fool's revenge joke from Mickey, Donald was corrupted by Pete who claimed Mickey was the enemy. To get back, Donald was to use Pumbaa to stink up the club. However, after Donald learned he was to be given an award that night, he called off the prank and apologized to Mickey for his actions. In \"Dennis the Duck\", Donald was shown to have a disliking for some black-and-white characters. In \"Donald Wants to Fly\", he attempted to gain the ability to fly. The entire evening proved unsuccessful until Peter Pan arrived. With Tinker Bell's pixie dust, Donald was able to live his dream.\n\nIn \"Salute to Sports\", Donald tries to prove that he is a good sport by not losing his temper. He tries to compete in the Olympics with Hercules and performs a martial arts demonstration with Mulan.\n\nDonald also appeared in the show's spin-off films. In Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse, Mickey, the staff, and all the Disney guests are snowed in at the House of Mouse on Christmas Eve. While trapped, the gang decides to have a Christmas party, but Donald doesn't have any Christmas spirit. Everyone then tries to change Donald's mood, only to fail. Eventually, Mickey asks Donald to put the star on the tree, finally giving Donald the Christmas spirit. In Mickey's House of Villains, Donald spent Halloween night trying (and failing) to scare everyone.\n\nMickey Mouse Clubhouse[]\n\nDonald Duck reappears as a main character in the computer-animated series. He joins in nearly every adventure Mickey and friends set off on and helps the gang solve many puzzling problems. But sometimes he loses his temper so to mix-up the problems. He is usually an unwitting target for many of the gags on the show and tends to say \"Why does this always happen to me?\" whenever something bad happens to him. A recurring gag in the series is Donald seeing a Mickey Mouse symbol and muttering to himself \"Why is it always Mickey Mouse?\". Another recurring gag that appears in recent episodes where Donald and Goofy often bicker over childish things.\n\nDonald is also the second main character to be used as a Mouseketool, which took place in the episode \"Mickey's Clubhouse Rocks\".\n\nInterestingly, at the beginning of the series, Donald's temper was a rarity. However, as the series progressed, his temper, attitude, and stubbornness would increase more and more. Many episodes revolve around Donald, including \"Donald's Hiccups\", \"Donald's Ducks\", \"Donald and the Beanstalk\", \"Donald's Brand New Clubhouse\", and \"Space Captain Donald\". In the series, Donald has a new pet and beloved friend and gem, Boo-Boo Chicken. Donald is also the star of the movie/special \"Mickey's Adventures in Wonderland\". Donald is also a major character in the spin-off Mickey Mousekersize and made guest appearances in Minnie's Bow-Toons.\n\nMickey Mouse[]\n\nDonald returns in this animated series starring Mickey and the gang. Unlike most of the main cast who are designed based on the late-1920s and early-1930s B&W cartoons character designs, here Donald resembles much closely to his late-1930s character design, complete with the buttons restored on his sailor shirt while still wearing the same red bow-tie from the comics.\n\nDonald's first appearance in the series was in the episode \"No Service\". In this episode, Donald & Mickey are planning to have a picnic on the beach with Minnie and Daisy and intend on ordering take-out at a snack shack, but Goofy denies serving them, as the shack's policy strictly states \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\". However, Mickey comes up with the idea to have one of the duos wear a full outfit and go into the shack to order take-out for everyone. They draw straws and Donald cheats his way to victory. Taking Mickey's shorts and shoes, Donald heads inside to order but spends much of his time laughing at Mickey's expense while the mouse tries to prevent Minnie and Daisy from seeing him nude. In the end, however, Donald is kicked out of the shack for attempting to pay with a credit card and Mickey's ID, causing his entire outfit to fall off just as Minnie & Daisy arrive, humiliating the duck.\n\nWhile Donald was portrayed as a trickster in \"No Service\", his appearances in \"Stayin' Cool\", \"Potatoland\", and \"Tapped Out\" (where he brutally defeated champion wrestler Pete in a rage) follow his more dominant personality, where he is easily aggravated by the antics of Goofy and the wholesomeness of Mickey, often leading to the duck getting himself harmed and humiliated comically.\n\nDonald can also be extremely selfish at times, such as in \"Wonders of the Deep\", where he initially refused to journey into the ocean to save an endangered Ludwig Von Drake. In \"No\", he initially refused to help Mickey overcome his difficulties in saying the word \"no\". Despite this, Donald can pull through and act with heroism, as he eventually did in both instances.\n\nThe first episode to fully revolve around Donald is \"Flipperboobootosis\", where Donald comes down with a rare foot disease but refuses to have it properly treated because of his fear of the doctor. After several failed attempts to cure the duck themselves, Mickey and Goofy eventually force Donald to the hospital, though it pays off in the end, as the Bear Doctor was able to cure the Flipperboobootosis.\n\nOther episodes where Donald plays a key role include \"The Adorable Couple\", \"Down the Hatch\", \"Bronco Busted\", and \"Split Decisions\". He also had a starring role in \"Captain Donald\", where his deepest, darkest secret is revealed — he can't sail. It was also revealed that Donald got his sailor suit from Daisy because she likes men in uniform.\n\nIn \"Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special\", Donald decides to live out his dream of experiencing Christmas by staying in the north with Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Pluto as opposed to migrating to the south with Daisy and the rest of his family. Being a duck, however, the harsh winter weather sickens Donald to a deadly degree (even though it has never affected him this way in previous productions). By the end, Mickey and the others manage to transfer him to the south, where they learn that Christmas can be celebrated anywhere in the world.\n\nMickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures[]\n\nDonald appears in the madcap racing series taking place in the town of Hot Dog Hills. He works alongside Mickey in a local car garage, and has a transforming roadster modeled after his boat home known as the \"Converting Cruiser\". Unlike the other racers who typically participate for the fun of it, Donald is somewhat obsessed with winning and being praised as the best racer in town (and he has won several races). Despite his determination, Donald still plays fair and square by the rules and shows good sportsmanship.\n\nDuckTales (2017)[]\n\nDonald is a main character in the 2017 DuckTales series. He plays a significantly larger role compared to the original series. This was also the first he wore his white hat since the classic shorts and the first appearance of the black sailor outside of the comic timeline series.\n\nTen years before the start of the series, Donald, Scrooge, and Della were partners and regularly embarked on fantastical adventures. After having explored virtually every known region in the world, Della wanted to explore space. However, she had three eggs that were nearly ready to hatch. This didn't dissuade Della, who still sought to pursue her astronomical goal. Donald scolded his sister for choosing adventure over family, but unbeknown to him, Scrooge had built a rocket ship as a surprise gift to Della in honor of her triplets' birth. Della found out early and stole the rocket before Scrooge noticed. Scrooge tried to guide Della to safety through radio transmissions, but a cosmic storm consumed her ship and rendered her lost. Della's unhatched triplets, meanwhile, were left motherless. Donald claimed custody and raised Huey, Dewey, and Louie as a single parent from the moment they hatched. Blaming his uncle for the loss of his sister, he refused to speak to Scrooge and cut all contact, the two becoming estranged.\n\nA decade later, Huey, Dewey, and Louie had no idea that Scrooge was their great-uncle at the start of the series. In \"Woo-oo!\", Donald prepares for a job interview and, out of desperation, leaves the boys in Scrooge's care for the time being. He gets the job, but the employer is Flintheart Glomgold, who enlists Donald on his search to find the jewel of Atlantis (which Scrooge and the boys are also after). Though they are left in the city for dead by Glomgold, Dewey uses the wisdom he gained from Scrooge to rescue them. Impressed, Donald warmly allows the boys to remain in contact with their great-uncle, as he believes Scrooge will, at the very least, teach the boys how to get out of the dangers they'll inevitably face throughout their adventurous lives. Unfortunately, Donald's home catches fire, which prompts Scrooge to charitably invite his four nephews to live in his mansion while Donald fixes the houseboat, which now resides in Scrooge's pool.\n\nIn \"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\", Huey, Dewey, and Louie discover the truth about Della, just as Donald finishes the boat. Seeing the boys so downhearted prompts him to move the family to Cape Suzette. Before leaving, Webby, Launchpad, and Mrs. Beakley throw a \"going away party\", which is a ploy to convince Donald and the boys to forgive Scrooge and rekindle their broken family. Beakley reveals that Scrooge has been tormented by the loss of Della and almost sent his company into bankruptcy by funding numerous rescue missions to recover her. Donald, finally realizing the love Scrooge has for his family, declares that they've been apart for too long. With Huey, Dewey, and Louie in agreement, they decide to stay in Duckburg. Before they can reunite with Scrooge, however, Magica De Spell takes over the city. Donald leads a heroic rescue mission to stop the sorceress and save his uncle. He rallies together some of Duckburg's residents, easily defeats the shadow versions in battle (including the Gizmoduck's robotic suit), and accidentally destroys Magica's staff, which takes away her power. After the dust settles, the boys reconcile with Scrooge, thus finally bringing their family together again.\n\nIn \"The Town Where Everyone Was Nice!\", he reunites with Panchito & Jose and lies about taking over McDuck industries to impress them. He later confesses and Jose & Panchito confess that they lied as well. They then team up to defeat a murderous flower and Donald kills it with his bad singing.\n\nIn \"Storkules in Duckburg!\", Donald's friend Storkules comes to live with him.\n\nIn \"Last Christmas!\", Dewey travels back in time to find his mom at Christmas. He also meets a teenager Donald, who didn't want to celebrate Christmas with Della at first. Young Donald was also voiced by Russi Taylor, using the same voice used for Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This was one of Taylor's final freshly recorded performances before her death.\n\nIn \"The Golden Spear!\", Donald is trying to rest but keeps getting woken up by adventuring. His family gives him a free cruise vacation for one month. However, he sees Della's rocket ship crash. He goes to look for her but pushes the launch button. The rocket floats up to outer space.\n\nIn \"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\", the rocket crash-lands on the moon, and Donald is taken as a prisoner by the Moonlanders.\n\nIn \"What Ever Happened to Donald Duck?!\", Donald is declared an enemy of the Moon by General Lunaris and thrown in prison. He is broken free by Della's friend Penumbra, who helps him escape. The two stumble upon Lunaris' war room and discover that he has been planning an invasion on Earth even before Della's arrival. Lunaris arrives and taunts Donald, but Donald battles him and eventually escapes the moon on a prototype rocket, but not before warning Scrooge and the kids of the invasion. It's revealed that he felt the world is out to get him, however when Huey, Dewey and Louie were born, he took anger management classes to become a better person.\n\nBy \"Moonvasion!\", Donald has been marooned on an island for months, with nothing but a watermelon he calls \"Melon\" for company (apparently implying that Mickey Mouse is only a figment of his imagination in the reboot). Della and the kids reunite with him after crashing there, before being rescued by Fethry & Gladstone. Donald, Della, Scrooge, and the kids steal a Moon rocket ship and battle General Lunaris in a rocket ship battle. Lunaris nearly eliminates them, but Penumbra crashes her ship into his at the last moment. After this, peace in Duckburg is restored, and Donald resumes life with his family.\n\nIn \"Louie's Eleven!\", he meets Daisy Duck for the first time. Both fund common ground with each other over their desire to be on Eva Glamour's \"It List\" and eventually start a romantic relationship by \"New Gods on the Block!\".\n\nDuring \"The Last Adventure!\", his cousin Fethry accidentally reveals to Della that Donald and Daisy are planning to take the houseboat on their own adventure around the world. While Della was upset about this at first, she eventually realized that Donald needed this long overdue vacation and was ready to go on his own adventure. By the end of the series, Donald decides to take May and June under his wing and bring them along on his trip with Daisy.\n\nLegend of the Three Caballeros[]\n\nDonald serves as the protagonist of the action/adventure series, in which his inexplicably bad luck causes him to lose his job, home and even Daisy on the day of his birthday. Fortunately, Donald inherits the belongings of his great-grandfather, Clinton Coot. This includes a shabby cabana cared for by the Aracuan Bird, as well as countless ancient and priceless artifacts. Unfortunately for Donald, he must share his inheritance with a parrot named José Carioca and a rooster named Panchito—neither of whom have Donald previously met in this continuity. Though initially displeased with this revelation, Donald and his new acquaintances work together to sell Coot's belongings for profit, with help from April, May, and June. Their items catch the interest of the sinister billionaire, Baron Von Sheldgoose, who offers the trio one billion dollars in exchange for their artifacts—so long as it includes a golden atlas. Motivated by their oncoming wealth, the trio scavenges through the home and soon uncovers an ancient book thought to be the atlas that Sheldgoose is after. Strangely, contact with the book unleashes Xandra, goddess of adventure. According to Xandra, Donald, Panchito, and José are descendants of a group of heroes known as the Three Caballeros.\n\nFrom then on, Panchito, José, and a reluctant Donald train under Xandra to pick up their ancestors' mantle and save the universe from Shellgoose and his recently resurrected relative, Lord Felldrake Sheldgoose. All the while, Donald tries to save his relationship with Daisy, though juggling this with his obligation to the Caballeros makes things difficult. By the end of the series, not only was he able to make amends with Daisy when he was able to control his temper during their trip in Paradise, but he was also able to defeat and expose Shellgoose as the crook he is and become the new president of the new Quackmore institute.\n\nChip 'n' Dale: Park Life[]\n\nDonald is a secondary character in the French-American web series Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life, resuming his longtime role as a foil to Chip and Dale.\n\nIn \"Delivery Duck\", Donald is a meal delivery duck who wears himself out delivering so many meal orders to the chipmunks, causing him to have a nervous breakdown.\n\nIn \"Dark in the Park\", Donald is a food vendor in the park. But when it closes down for the night, he gets locked in the park with some scary-looking raccoons. He takes refuge with the chipmunks, who use fireflies to light up the park and fend off the raccoons. The chipmunks then allow Donald to return to his truck, only to become excited about his food supply, which they try to raid, but which Donald tries to defend.\n\nIn \"Choppin' Dale\", Donald saws down trees, until it shocks Dale and makes him chomp down the trees instead. Meanwhile, Chip gives shelter to all the homeless animals who lost their homes due to Dale helping Donald out, until at the end when they finally stop the duck from sawing their tree down.\n\nOther television shows[]\n\nIn the animated opening of the original Mickey Mouse Club television series, Donald was prominently featured. Here, as the \"Mickey Mouse March\" played and the other characters sang along, Donald enviously shouted his name; showing a jealous hatred for the song, as well as a craving for the spotlight. At the end of the theme, Donald would be tasked with ringing the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" gong, only to have some injury befall him each time.\n\nDonald, along with Mickey, appears as a statue in the sculptor's cart at one point in the Adventures of the Gummi Bears episode \"The Sinister Sculptor\".\n\nDonald made a notable cameo appearance in the first episode of Bonkers, where he is taking a walk through the park before getting captured by a mugger. Bonkers D. Bobcat happens upon Donald and, unaware that the duck is being mugged at the moment, asks for a guest part in his next picture before eventually coming to his rescue when Lucky Piquel shows up to nab the mugger.\n\nIn the first episode of 101 Dalmatians: The Series: \"Home is Where the Bark Is\", when the pups chase Cruella back to the Dearly Farm, they ride on top of a subway train. Donald's silhouette can be seen as one of the passengers.\n\nDonald makes a cameo appearance alongside José Carioca in the episode \"Up and Down\" of the animated mini-series It's a Small World: The Animated Series.\n\nDonald makes a cameo in the Gargoyles episode \"Enter MacBeth\", as Hudson watches the Quack Pack episode \"The Really Mighty Ducks\".\n\nDonald's hat appears briefly in the Amphibia episode \"Swamp and Sensibility\" in a rubber duckie Wally had while showering on Wartwood's fountain, as seen on Anne's phone.\n\nDonald, in his 2017 DuckTales design, appears in the Broken Karaoke short \"Sidekicks\", among multiple sidekick characters from other Disney Television Animation series.\n\nPrinted material[]\n\nMain article: Donald Duck in comics\n\nAlthough he made his official debut in the Silly Symphony short The Wise Little Hen, the first incarnation and mention of Donald appeared in a 1931 storybook called The Adventures of Mickey Mouse where he was mentioned by name and an early design of him appeared on the back cover.\n\nWhile Donald's cartoons enjoy vast popularity in the United States and around the world, his weekly and monthly comic books enjoy their greatest popularity in many European countries, mostly in Norway and Finland, but many other countries are right behind - most notably Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nDevelopments under Barks[]\n\nBarks placed Donald in the city of Duckburg, which Barks populated with a host of supporting players, including Gladstone Gander (1948), Gyro Gearloose (1952), Uncle Scrooge McDuck (1947), Magica De Spell (1961), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), The Beagle Boys (1951), April, May, and June (1953), Neighbor Jones (1944), and John D. Rockerduck (1961). Many of Taliaferro's characters made the move to Barks' stories as well, including Donald's cumbersome pet Saint-Bernard dog Bolivar, Grandma Duck, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios, and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald. Scrooge's popularity grew, and by 1952, the character had a comic book of his own. At this point, Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories, and Donald's appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge's reluctant helper, accompanying his rich uncle around the globe. Donald's other primary goal is keeping his relationship permanent with Daisy as the two seem to go through more serious and troubling issues than in the tv shows and movies. Nevertheless, however, the duck couple would get back together no matter what (possibly because Daisy would regret her actions and return her love to Donald).\n\nVideo games[]\n\nMain article: Donald Duck in video games\n\nLike Mickey, Donald has made numerous appearances in video games over the years, both with major and minor roles. With some titles, Donald appears as a supporting character in the storyline, though with most, he appears as the lead, often following a heroic adventure. Some titles include QuackShot, Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers!, and PK: Out of the Shadows.\n\nDonald also appears in a heavy amount of crossover games, such as Kinect: Disneyland Adventures, Disney Party, and Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion.\n\nThe most prominently known game series featuring Donald as a primary character is the Kingdom Hearts series. In this storyline, Donald is the Royal Magician of Disney Castle, until he and Goofy go searching for the King. As such, his weapon of choice is a magical staff that allows him to cast spells. He often provides more advancing the plot and have most in the amount of camera time he has in the series than Mickey. He is still rash and has his aggressive personality, but he is loyal to his friends. Though he initially only cares about Sora (the main protagonist of the series) as a means to track down King Mickey, Donald soon grows to deeply care for him as a friend.\n\nIn Epic Mickey, an animatronic doppelgänger of Donald appears in Wasteland - a world inhabited by forgotten Disney characters.\n\nDonald has also appeared in Disney Infinity: 2.0 Edition as a playable character, exclusive to the Toy Box.\n\nDisney Parks[]\n\nDonald is an extremely common character in the Disney theme parks for meet-and-greets and appears in almost every show and parade.\n\nIn all versions of Mickey's Toontown, Donald's home, Miss Daisy, is available for a walk-in tour. Donald can also be heard speaking and playing \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" on a piano in the line for Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin.\n\nDisneyland Resort[]\n\nIn California, Donald can be found along Main Street, U.S.A. In the past, Donald co-starred alongside Steve Martin in Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years and headlined his own float in Mickey's Soundsational Parade.\n\nWalt Disney World[]\n\nIn Mickey's PhilharMagic, Mickey is the conductor of an orchestra. It was up to Donald to set up the instruments before the start of the show. Donald fell asleep on the job, however, but was woken up by Mickey, who had to rush backstage to finish preparing. As Mickey runs off, he specifically tells Donald not to touch the sorcerer hat. Defying his orders, Donald takes it anyway and begins to play with the now-living musical instruments. Soon enough, Donald provokes them and is attacked. He loses the hat and travels through scenes from various Disney films to try and retrieve it.\n\nIn the defunct stage show Dream Along With Mickey at the Magic Kingdom, Donald states that he does not believe in dreams. Once Maleficent, Captain Hook, and Mr. Smee crash the party, Donald, with the help of Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy uses the power of dreams to foil the three villains. Donald believes again and peace is restored to the kingdom.\n\nIn the Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros in Epcot, Donald Duck has run off, prompting Panchito and José to set off on a frantic search for their missing friend. Donald tours Mexico with José and Panchito riding on a magic sarape, looking for him. Later, Donald meets some Mexican girls, which brings Panchito and José to pull Donald away from those girls and get to their scheduled concert on time.\n\nAt Disney's Hollywood Studios, Donald makes two appearances in Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway. He is first seen at the carnival as a hot dog vendor, struggling with putting mustard on a hot dog before having his feathers taken by a tornado. He later appears in the city as a delivery truck driver, stuck in a traffic jam caused by the runaway train and honking his horn impatiently at the train.\n\nFor meet-and-greets, Donald can be found at Pete's Silly Sideshow at the Magic Kingdom, and can also be seen during Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire and Festival of Fantasy Parade. In 2018, Donald began making regular appearances in Disney's Animal Kingdom for Donald's Dino-Bash.\n\nDonald also had a spell card known as \"Caballero Donald's Piñata\" in the defunct attraction Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom.\n\nTokyo Disney Resort[]\n\nIn Tokyo Disneyland, Donald can be found mainly in World Bazaar, Camp Woodchuck in Westernland, and American Waterfront, but he also appears in many other places all the time, such as Mermaid Lagoon.\n\nIn One Man's Dream II: The Magic Lives On, Donald is in love with Hollywood starlet Daisy Duck. He thinks in order to win her heart, he must become an actor. He tries, but the cast and crew won't stop goofing off. He eventually gives up, until Daisy informs him she likes him the way he is, which pleases Donald.\n\nIn Tokyo Disneyland, Donald headlines the confectionary shop, Duck Family Chocolate Competition, alongside other relatives and close relations. Donald and his family also headline Villa Donaldo Home Shop, in Tokyo DisneySea.\n\nIn April 2024, Donald gained his own limited-time celebration called \"Donald's Quacky Duck City\" which honored the character's 90th birthday.\n\nHong Kong Disneyland[]\n\nIn Hong Kong Disneyland, you are most likely to find Donald on Main Street or at the Fantasy Gardens character greeting area.\n\nDonald has been featured in the musical The Golden Mickeys in which he is involved in several of the song and dance routines.\n\nDisney Cruise Line[]\n\nDonald is a prominent character on the Disney Cruise Line ships; this includes being the star of the AquaDuck attraction. He is also, to date, the only Disney character to ever ride the attraction.\n\nHe is also present on the Disney Fantasy cruise ship's Wishes with Kayla, Brandon, Nicole, and the other high school students.\n\nIt's a Small World[]\n\nDonald, as one of the Three Caballeros, makes a short appearance as dolls in the Mexican area of the Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland versions of the attraction.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhen speaking of Donald, the artists at Walt Disney Animation Studios rarely called the character by name, instead referring to him as \"The Duck\". The moniker was regularly used by Walt Disney during interviews and discussions about Donald.[14]\n\nDonald did call himself \"the Duck\" in the Roadster Racers/Mixed-Up Adventures series.\n\nAppearing in over 150 theatrically released films and shorts, Donald has the record for most theatrical appearances for a Disney character and he is the most published non-superhero comic book character in the world.\n\nA duck skeleton that looks like Donald can be seen in James and the Giant Peach.\n\nA float that looks exactly like Donald Duck appears in the \"Safety Smart in the Water\" episode from the Timon and Pumbaa's Wild About Safety series.\n\nThough Donald has black irises, they sometimes appear to be blue in 2-D artwork or in his 3D models and artworks, such as his Kingdom Hearts III artwork.\n\nDonald Duck is the only popular film and TV cartoon character to appear as a mascot for the sports team of a major American university, namely, the Ducks at the University of Oregon.\n\nIn \"Moonvasion!\" and \"Where's Funny?\", Donald displays the ability to perfectly imitate others. In said episodes, he imitates Mickey and Funny the Funhouse, respectively.\n\nDonald's name and image are used in numerous commercial products, one example being Donald Duck Orange Juice, introduced by Citrus World in 1940.\n\nDonald resembles a species of duck called Crested Duck.\n\nThough he doesn't appear in that series, Donald was mentioned at least twice in Darkwing Duck. In \"Film Flam\", when Drake Mallard refuses to believe something Gosalyn is telling him, he sarcastically remarks \"Yeah right, and I'm Donald... Duck?\". Also, in \"A Star is Scorned\", when Darkwing and Gosalyn arrive at the studio, the security guard thinks that Darkwing is Donald, saying he didn't recognize him without his sailor suit. Later, when trying to get back into the studio, Darkwing and Gosalyn manage to get in disguised as Donald and Louie, respectively.\n\nIn the comic universe, Donald is the first descendant of the three main Duck families (Duck, Coot and McDuck), a trait shared only by his sister and his nephews.\n\nTo mark Donald's 50th anniversary, 50 Pekin ducks followed the costumed character around Disneyland.[42]\n\nDonald originally had a brief cameo in an alternate opening for the 2005 film Chicken Little (film) as Ducky Lucky. The scene can be found on the DVD of the actual movie.\n\nOsamu Tezuka (known as \"The Godfather of Manga\") was a huge fan of the Donald Duck and Scrooge McDucks comics by Carl Barks. Every Christmas, Tezuka would annually send Barks Christmas Cards and letters featuring his characters (such as Astro Boy, Kimba/Leo, and Unico). One Holiday card featured Astro Boy hugging Donald Duck.[3]\n\nDonald's voice can be heard on a television in Prep & Landing.\n\nIn The Muppet Show episode guest-starring Petula Clark, there was a character named Ronald Duck, whose name is a spoof of Donald Duck.\n\nIn Italian version, Donald was renamed \"Paperino\", which comes from \"Papero\", the Italian word for \"Duck\".\n\nDonald Duck was mentioned at the beginning of the live-action Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers movie, but does not physically appear in the film itself.\n\nStoryboard artists for The Owl House attempted to have Donald cameo as a background character, but were vetoed by Disney's Standard & Practices team.[43]\n\nTo celebrate his 90th birthday, Donald made a guest appearance on the YouTube series Hot Ones. He reveals, among other things, that he despises his middle name \"Fauntleroy\", and that only lists it when he is filing his taxes. Additionally, he constantly travels with Mickey who is his designated driver due to his frequent outbursts and antics.[44]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nDonald Duck on Wikipedia\n\nDonald Duck at INDUCKS\n\nDonald Duck character page (Japanese 日本)\n\nMedia Short Films: Mickey Mouse series • Donald Duck series • Goofy series • Pluto series • Chip and Dale series\n\nFeature Length Films: Fantasia • Saludos Amigos • The Three Caballeros • Fun and Fancy Free • Melody Time • DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp • Disney's The Twelve Days of Christmas • A Goofy Movie • Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas • Fantasia 2000 • An Extremely Goofy Movie • Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse • Mickey's House of Villains • Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers • Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n\nTelevision: Mickey Mouse Club • The Wonderful World of Disney • DuckTales • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers • Darkwing Duck • Goof Troop • Quack Pack • Mickey's Fun Songs • Mickey Mouse Works • House of Mouse • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse • Minnie's Bow-Toons • Mickey Mouse • DuckTales • Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures • Legend of the Three Caballeros • Mickey Go Local • The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse • Mickey Mouse Funhouse • Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2.0\n\nDisney Parks Mickey's Toontown • Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway • PLAY!\n\nEntertainment: Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade • Stitch's Interplanetary Beach Party Blast • It’s Very Minnie! • Minnie's Tiara of Dreams • Minnie, We Love You! • Club Mouse Beat • Mickey and Friends: An Extra Big Adventure • Minnie @ Funderland • Quacky Celebration ★ Donald the Legend!\n\nSpring: Disney's Easter Wonderland • Hippity Hoppity Springtime • Usatama on the Run!\n\nSummer: Summer Blast • Disney's Summer Oasis Splash • Mickey's WaterWorks\n\nHalloween: Re-Villains!
