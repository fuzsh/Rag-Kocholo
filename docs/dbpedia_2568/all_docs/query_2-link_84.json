        "text": "About\n\nThe Blue Angels have been enthralling people, across the country and around the globe, for more than 75 years. Now, Amazon MGM Studios and IMAX bring a brand new documentary – The Blue Angels – that will take audiences soaring with the Navy’s elite Flight Demonstration Squadron as never before. Filmed for IMAX, the immersive footage puts you in the cockpit for a firsthand view of the Blue Angels’ precision flying, while the aerial shots deliver a spectacular showcase of the breathtaking maneuvers that have made them the world’s premier jet team.\n\nRATING: PG-13\n\nRUNTIME: 1 hour 34 minutes\n\n***FREE parking is included with your ticket to The Blue Angels***\n\n78 Years of Aviation Excellence\n\nIn 1946, Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Chief of Naval Operations, had a vision to create a flight team in order to raise the public’s interest in naval aviation and increase the Navy’s morale. In the 1940’s, they thrilled audiences with precision combat maneuvers in the F6 Hellcat, the F8 Bearcat and the F9 Panther. During the 1950’s, The Blue Angels refined their demonstration with aerobatic maneuvers in the F9 Cougar and F-11 Tiger and introduced the first six-plane delta formation, still flown to this day! By the end of the 1960’s, they had switched to flying the F-4 Phantom, the only two seat aircraft flown by the delta formation. In 1974, they transitioned to the A-4 Skyhawk, a smaller and lighter aircraft with a tighter turning radius allowing for a more dynamic flight demonstration. In 1986, they celebrated 40 years by unveiling the Boeing F/A-18 Hornet. In 2021, they transitioned to the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet and celebrated 75 years of service.\n\nPurchasing OMNIMAX® Theater tickets helps support STEM and educational programs at the Saint Louis Science Center.\n\nMovie Pricing\n\nThis is a paid experience.\n\nAges\n\nPrice\n\nMembers $13.50* Adults Non-Members (ages 13-59) $16.50 Children $14.50 Seniors (ages 60+) $14.50 Military $14.50\n\n***FREE parking is included with your ticket to The Blue Angels***\n\nJust like all F/A-18s, the F/A-18B Hornet on display outside of the McDonnell Planetarium was manufactured here in St. Louis at McDonnell Douglas, now Boeing Defense, Space & Security. F/A-18s were developed in the 1970s in response to the U.S. military’s requirements for a lightweight fighter jet. The F/A-18B is a dual-seater, twin engine, mid-wing, multi-mission tactical aircraft.\n\nThe Hornet on display was manufactured and delivered to the U.S. Navy in August of 1983. The B model designates it as a training aircraft. This particular aircraft was used for aerial demonstrations by the U.S. Navy’s Flight Demonstration Squadron: the Blue Angels. The jet is a permanent loan from the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida.
