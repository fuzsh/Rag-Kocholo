        "text": "Trump calls for debates with Biden hours after Haley suspends campaign\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for debates with President Joe Biden hours after Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign.\n\nTrump, who did not participate in any GOP primary debates, has previously said he wanted to debate Biden in the general election.\n\nBiden’s campaign responded, saying it’s a conversation they will have “at the appropriate time” and urged the former president to watch Biden’s State of the Union address on Thursday.\n\nThis post has been updated with the Biden campaign’s response.\n\nHere's where the delegate count stands after Super Tuesday\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are leading in delegates as they become their party’s likely nominees, setting up a rematch in November.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced Wednesday she is suspending her presidential campaign following a series of losses on Super Tuesday.\n\nHere’s the latest CNN delegate estimate:\n\nOn the Republican side:\n\nDelegates won on Super Tuesday:\n\nTrump: 783\n\nHaley: 47\n\n24 Republican delegates from Super Tuesday contests are still to be allocated.\n\nA total of 1,215 delegates are required to win the Republican nomination. Here’s how many GOP delegates have been won to date:\n\nTrump: 1,059\n\nHaley: 90\n\nOn the Democratic side:\n\nDelegates won on Super Tuesday:\n\nBiden: 1,381\n\nUncommitted: 11\n\nJason Palmer: 3\n\n25 Democratic delegates from the Super Tuesday contests are still to be allocated.\n\nA total of 1,968 pledged delegates are required to win the Democratic nomination. Here’s how many Democratic delegates have been won to date:\n\nBiden: 1,587\n\nUncommitted: 13\n\nJason Palmer: 3\n\nIn Arizona, Democrats look to drive up turnout in key county\n\nArizona Democrats are facing a dilemma in Pima County. Home to Tucson, the blue county boasts a deep well of Democratic voters, but many with deep uncertainty about President Joe Biden’s age and his administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Read more about that here.\n\nBut state and county Democrats say they have a strategy to target these unenthused voters: Focus on local and state issues to drive up turnout and reap the benefits at the top of the ticket.\n\nAdvocates are gathering signatures to place a state constitutional amendment enshrining abortion rights on the November ballot. They’re hoping to replicate the success of similar efforts across the country since the fall of Roe v. Wade by turning out Democrats, independents and even some supportive Republicans.\n\n“A lot of people have been extremely shocked to see women’s rights reversed after all of these years,” said Corinne Cooper, who has been volunteering since September to get Arizonans to sign the petition.\n\nDemocrats here point to competitive US Senate and House races as a draw for centrist and progressive voters alike, along with the possibility that the party could flip both chambers of the state Legislature – a duopoly they haven’t enjoyed since 1966.\n\nDemocrats are also counting on another factor: fear about what a second Trump presidency would look like. Becky Richards, a 37-year-old Realtor, moved to Arizona from much more Democratic Illinois a few years ago.\n\n“It’s terrifying to see that Trump is basically doing nothing, and still gaining momentum,” she said. “In Arizona, that scares me, in a way, because I see the Trump flags and the MAGA hats and things as you drive through the state.”\n\nIf it comes down to a rematch between Biden and Trump, Richards said that despite her hope for a younger candidate, she’ll vote for Biden “no question.”\n\nMcConnell defends Trump endorsement despite blaming him for Jan. 6 insurrection\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended his endorsement of former President Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee, despite Trump’s barrage of attacks against him and his wife and McConnell’s harsh criticism of the former president after the January 6 insurrection.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump thanked McConnell for the endorsement. The pair have had a rocky relationship over the past few years, but Trump says he’s willing to work with him.\n\n“Thank you, Mitch,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I look forward to working with you and a Republican Senate MAJORITY to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn Arizona, Biden has a problem where he can least afford it\n\nPresident Joe Biden has a problem where he can least afford it: with Democratic voters in Pima County, Arizona. The county, home to Tucson, boasts a deep well of Democratic voters, but many with deep uncertainty about the president’s age and his administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nJust how critical is Pima County? Biden won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes out of more than 3 million cast. He bested Trump by nearly 100,000 votes in Pima County. He’ll need every one of those votes, and maybe more, if he hopes to keep Arizona — and his job — come November.\n\nTucson business owner Jenna Majchrzak, a self-described “reluctant Democrat,” sums up the expected November choice between Biden and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump this way: “It’s hard to vote for someone with multiple felony charges,” she says, “and it’s also very hard to vote for someone that is pro-genocide.”\n\nIt’s an opinion shared by many Democratic voters whom CNN talked to in this diverse county of just over a million residents, with Mexico on its southern border and the Tohono O’odham Nation to the west.\n\nGrady Campbell, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Arizona, is looking forward to voting in his first presidential election. But — and it’s a big one — he’s so put off by the Biden administration’s approach to Israel’s offensive in Gaza that he’s voting for Marianne Williamson in the March 19 Democratic primary.\n\nAnother concern for some Pima County Democrats: Biden’s age.\n\n“It’s not even so much even the mental acuity as it is just kind of being out of touch,” Amanda Bruno, 31, said of the 81-year-old president. “I’d love to see somebody a little bit younger, who’s whose impact will be felt by their generation.”\n\nHow are state and county Democrats responding to the challenge of unenthused voters? Read more about that here.\n\nWhite House implies Biden does not want Trump to receive classified briefings as presumptive GOP nominee\n\nThe White House implied that President Joe Biden still does not want to see former President Donald Trump receive classified intelligence briefings — even as Trump is set to officially become the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIt’s tradition for past presidents to be allowed to request and receive intelligence briefings. In 2021, Biden said he didn’t believe Trump should receive the briefings due to his “erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection.”\n\n“I’d rather not speculate out loud,” Biden previously said when asked what he fears could happen if Trump continued to receive the briefings. “I just think that there is no need for him to have the — the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”\n\nAsked if Biden would do anything to try to block Trump from receiving the briefings, Jean-Pierre declined to answer on Wednesday.\n\n“I don’t have anything to add,” she said, “but the president was very clear about how he felt about that, and I would say those comments certainly do stand today.”\n\nThe nominees of the two major parties have received classified intelligence briefings from top government officials for more than 60 years, a decision aimed at facilitating a smooth transition from candidate to commander in chief.\n\nSupreme Court sets April 25 argument date in Trump immunity case\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on April 25 in the blockbuster case dealing with whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from prosecution in the federal election subversion case.\n\nThe court previously said it would hear arguments in the case during the week of April 22. On Wednesday, it announced that it would hear the case during a rare Thursday session.\n\nThe timing of the case has drawn considerable scrutiny as it could help determine whether Trump faces trial over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election before the November 2024 election.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who brought the criminal charges, has sought to speed up the proceedings over Trump’s immunity claim so that he can bring the matter to trial as quickly as possible.\n\nAn original trial date that had been set for early March already has been postponed.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips ends his presidential campaign and endorses Biden\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips is ending his long-shot Democratic primary challenge to President Joe Biden.\n\nHe thanked his supporters, and urged them to do everything they can “to help keep a man of decency and integrity in the White House. That’s Joe Biden.”\n\nAnalysis: Why Donald Trump is so different from traditional candidates\n\nDonald Trump has put America on notice – his second term would be even more disruptiv e and turbulent than his first.\n\nThe new presumptive Republican nominee booked his place in a general election rematch with President Joe Biden when his distant, last-remaining rival Nikki Haley conceded to reality and suspended her campaign on Wednesday.\n\nThe triumph of the once and possibly future president – an incredible comeback given his attempt to steal the 2020 election and a crush of criminal and civil trials threatening his liberty and fortune – sets up one of the most fateful elections in American history. His demonstrated record of contempt for democratic institutions means that the country’s political, legal and constitutional guardrails are facing a severe new test from a GOP candidate who could be a convicted felon by Election Day and who may see restored executive power as a tool to thwart federal prosecutions.\n\nAnd Trump’s return to the threshold of the presidency will send shockwaves around a world still recovering from his volatile leadership and affinity for autocrats and send a warning to Ukraine, a nation fighting for its survival.\n\nThe reason Trump is so different from a traditional candidate is that he’s not campaigning as a fresh new voice pulsating with optimism for the future or brimming with policy ideas to bring the nation together. He’s portraying America as a dystopian, failed state overwhelmed by lawlessness, urban blight and slipping toward World War III abroad. In a classic trope of dictators, he’s promising to flush out enemies within, vowing revenge on political foes and posing as a strongman while conflating his own personal, political interests with the nation’s.\n\nRead Collinson’s full analysis on Trump here.\n\nHaley’s lone House GOP supporter urges her to unify behind Trump\n\nNikki Haley’s lone House Republican supporter, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, is urging her to help unite the party after she announced she will withdraw from the presidential race, telling CNN that he is speaking with former President Donald Trump later today.\n\n“It’s time to unite. I’ll be supporting President Trump 100%. We got a country (to) save,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n\nNorman, who did not speak to Haley this morning, said he hopes that she will ultimately support Trump.\n\n“We’ll see. Hopefully she will,” he said, adding: “It’s not about Democrat and Republican, it’s about getting this country back on track.”\n\nNorman added that Haley “did a good job” in her campaign, “but the people chose Donald Trump. That’s a good thing that it played out like this.”\n\nIs Nikki Haley the future – or the past – of the Republican Party?\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has emerged from the presidential primary like few losing candidates manage to do – in a far more elevated position than when announcing her candidacy a year ago.\n\nHaley, whose political career spans from the Tea Party to the Trump era, offered a warning about the isolationist movement that is growing inside the Republican Party.\n\nThe question of Haley’s next steps will be answered in the months and years to come. But it speaks to a far larger question about whether her views are the future – or the past – of the GOP.\n\nCongressional Republicans set aside past concerns over Trump and rally behind him as nominee\n\nSome congressional Republicans are putting aside concerns over former President Donald Trump as the party’s nominee and uniting around him following a dominant Super Tuesday showing that led to his last primary challenger dropping out.\n\nSenate GOP Whip John Thune, who has been vocal in the past about his concerns over how Trump will fare with suburban voters, told CNN that he believes the Republican ticket will deliver a unified message.\n\n“We’ll all go out and all help aggressively win those people in suburban areas (and) independent voters. It’s now a … straight up one-on-one,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n\nAnd Rep. John Duarte, a California Republican who represents a district President Joe Biden won last cycle, told CNN that he’s focused on who he is running against and that he plans to endorse Trump.\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who also represents a Biden-won Pennsylvania district, declined to say whether he would be endorsing Trump.\n\nBiden teams look to foreign affairs in hopes of peeling off Haley voters\n\nAs President Joe Biden’s advisers look for ways to appeal to Nikki Haley supporters, one area of potential overlap is emerging: foreign policy and world affairs.\n\nIt’s not an issue traditionally at the center of presidential elections, which usually revolve around domestic matters and the economy. But for the president and his team, America’s role in the world has become a key point of contrast with Donald Trump – fertile ground, they believe, for picking off disillusioned Republicans.\n\nIn his statement making a direct appeal to bring Haley’s voters into the fold, Biden made specific mention of her attempts to call out Donald Trump for “cowering before Vladimir Putin” and for her support of NATO.\n\nLikewise, in her speech announcing the suspension of her campaign, Haley spent time during the brief remarks describing the “moral imperative” of standing with traditional American allies like Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nTo be sure, she wasn’t endorsing Biden’s approach — she said “our world is on fire because of America’s retreat.” But in voicing support for longstanding American alliances and a muscular role abroad, she found herself more aligned with Biden than with Trump, who has questioned NATO’s role and said he would encourage Russia to invade NATO members who don’t meet defense spending targets.\n\nThere is little expectation among Biden’s team that world affairs will drive many votes in November, but in the abstract, they think issues like the war in Ukraine and support for NATO provide a clear point of contrast with Trump. It’s also an issue they believe will resonate with donors – potentially those who contributed to Haley’s campaign – as they look to peel off support.\n\nHowever, even as he looks to appeal to her supporters on foreign policy, he faces discontent within his own party for his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza – an indication that the issue will remain a political flashpoint going forward.\n\n\"A tale of two statements\": Haley aide reacts to the difference in Biden and Trump responses to Haley's exit\n\nNikki Haley’s campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas described the statements from President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Haley’s exit from the race as “a tale of two statements.”\n\nBiden’s statement said there is a place for Haley voters in his campaign. In contrast, Trump invited Haley supporters to join him while saying the former South Carolina governor was “trounced” on Super Tuesday and that most of her donations came from Democrats.\n\nTrump campaign fundraises off Haley's exit from the race\n\nThe Trump campaign blasted out a fundraising text to supporters on Wednesday shortly after former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced she was suspending her campaign, telling them, “It was a hard-fought race, but now it’s time for us to unite as a party and defeat Joe Biden!”\n\n“Nikki Haley ends her campaign!” the appeal read in all caps. “If we’re going to win back the White House, it will be all because of what you do right here, right now.”\n\nThe text said former President Donald Trump is calling on one million supporters to donate following the news.\n\nRNC acknowledges Trump is the presumptive nominee\n\nThe Republican National Committee formally acknowledged former President Trump as the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee for president on Wednesday, shortly after former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley officially dropped out of the Republican primary.\n\nThe statement comes just days before an expected leadership change at the RNC where McDaniel is likely to step down from her post and Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, is expected to succeed her. Trump had endorsed Whatley to lead the RNC and has also said he would install key lieutenants at the organization once he became the presumptive nominee.\n\nOnce a party has a presumptive or formal nominee that party’s national committee normally melds closely with the nominee’s campaign. In this case, the RNC is set to align closely with the Trump campaign going forward.\n\nElon Musk says he's not donating in presidential race\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday shot down speculation that he may provide financial support to former President Donald Trump’s campaign.\n\nThe public declaration comes after the New York Times reported this week that Musk met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. CNN confirmed the meeting with Musk, one of several Trump held with donors in Palm Beach last weekend as he seeks to raise more money for his financially strained campaign.\n\nThis isn’t the first time this cycle Musk has flirted with supporting a presidential candidate only to pull back. Musk once praised Ron DeSantis’ White House bid and infamously hosted the Florida governor’s glitchy presidential campaign launch on X. However, Musk ultimately backed away from DeSantis.\n\nBiden campaign makes an appeal to Haley supporters\n\nPresident Joe Biden made a clear appeal to Nikki Haley’s supporters in the aftermath of her exit from the race, praising her “courage” in standing up to former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden heralded Haley for her role in her party: “It takes a lot of courage to run for President – that’s especially true in today’s Republican Party, where so few dare to speak the truth about Donald Trump. Nikki Haley was willing to speak the truth about Trump: about the chaos that always follows him, about his inability to see right from wrong, about his cowering before Vladimir Putin.”\n\nThe Biden campaign is setting out to earn the votes of moderate Republican voters turned off by Trump. Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said Wednesday there is a “home” for Haley voters with the Biden team in the moments before Haley ended her candidacy.\n\nHaley voters “agreed with Nikki Haley when she stood up to Trump for the chaos, the division, the extremism that he represents,” Tyler told CNN’s John Berman Wednesday morning. Haley voters, he added, “rejected MAGA extremism” in 2020 and 2022, and “are now rejecting Donald Trump and MAGA extremism moving forward.”\n\nRepublicans spent more than $303 million on ads during the presidential primary\n\nNikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign this morning, ending a costly fight for the Republican nomination that drew a total of over $303 million in ad spending from the combined field of GOP candidates and outside groups, and saw the top candidates devote tens of millions to attacking each other.\n\nHaley’s network spent about $82 million on ads, with about $17.9 million coming from her campaign and $64.4 million from SFA Fund, the lead super PAC supporting her bid. In addition, Americans For Prosperity Action, the Koch-aligned super PAC backing Haley, spent about $8 million on ads supporting Haley.\n\nOverall, comparing the lead candidates and their main allied PACs, Haley’s network spent the most on ads in the GOP presidential primary, about $82.3 million. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his super PACs spent the second most, about $60.4 million, while former President Donald Trump and his PACs spent the third most, about $60.8 million.\n\nAccording to the Haley campaign’s most recent fundraising reports and public statements, it likely ended with some untapped resources. Haley’s campaign reported nearly $13 million in cash on hand as of the end of 2023, and had recently announced it raised $12 million in the month of February.\n\nTrump goes after Haley as she drops out and invites Haley supporters to join his movement\n\nAs Nikki Haley suspended her campaign Wednesday morning, former President Donald Trump posted on social media that the former South Carolina governor got “trounced” on Super Tuesday and invited her supporters to join his political movement.\n\n“Nikki Haley got trounced last night, in record setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats, for reasons unknown, are allowed to vote in Vermont, and various other Republican Primaries. Much of her money came from Radical Left Democrats, as did many of her voters, almost 50%, according to the polls,” Trump posted.\n\nHe continued, “At this point, I hope she stays in the “race” and fights it out until the end! I’d like to thank my family, friends, and the Great Republican Party for helping me to produce, by far, the most successful Super Tuesday in history, and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation.”\n\nReminder: Vermont does not have party registration. All voters can choose which primary to vote in.\n\nNikki Haley congratulates Trump without endorsing him as she exits race\n\nNikki Haley congratulated former President Donald Trump during her announcement ending her presidential campaign but stopped short of endorsing him.\n\n“In all likelihood, Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee when our party convention meets in July. I congratulate him and wish him well. I wish anyone well who would be America’s president. Our country is too precious to let our differences divide us,” Haley said.\n\nHaley added, “it is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that.”\n\nNikki Haley: \"The time has now come to suspend my campaign\"\n\nNikki Haley formally announced she is ending her presidential campaign.\n\n“I am filled with gratitude for the outpouring of support we’ve received from all across our great country. But the time has now come to suspend my campaign. I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets,” she said Wednesday in South Carolina.\n\nShe warned Americans about the plethora of problems that lie ahead, saying, “the world is on fire.” The former South Carolina governor emphasized some of the issues she ran on: the threat of national debt to the American economy, the need for small government and the importance of standing by Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel.\n\nHaley also congratulated Donald Trump who, she said, is going to be the likely presidential nominee of the Republican Party.\n\nReflecting back on her campaign, she remarked that her mother, “a first-generation immigrant, got to vote for her daughter for president — only in America.”\n\nBiden campaign official calls American Samoa loss \"silly news\"\n\nThe Biden campaign is shrugging off projections tonight that showed President Joe Biden losing the American Samoa Democratic primary to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, with one campaign official calling it “silly news.”\n\nCampaign officials explained to reporters that a very small number of votes is expected in American Samoa and pointed to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Democratic primary victory there in 2020.\n\nPressed for more details, the Biden campaign official said Palmer had a “platform of being an advocate for American Samoa.”\n\nA Palmer campaign official told CNN the candidate had three full time campaign staffers on the ground but did not visit the island himself, instead appearing virtually at events.\n\nCNN Projection: Trump will win California GOP primary\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will win the California Republican presidential primary, CNN projects, as he closes in on his third straight GOP nomination.\n\nThere were 169 delegates at stake in California tonight.\n\nWho won in 2016 and 2020: Trump won both primaries.\n\nCNN Projection: Biden will win California Democratic primary\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win the California Democratic primary, CNN projects, as he cruises to his party’s nomination for a second term.\n\nThere were 424 pledged delegates at stake in California tonight.\n\nWho won in 2016 and 2020: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016; Biden beat Sanders and others in 2020.\n\nCNN Projection: Nikki Haley will win the Vermont GOP primary\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will win Vermont’s Republican primary, CNN projects.\n\nThere were 17 delegates at stake in the state.\n\nCNN Projections: Competitive House races outside California\n\nOn the ballot Tuesday are primaries for US Senate and governor, but it’s the primaries for the US House – where Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority – that are by far the most important for the balance of power in Washington.\n\nThe outcomes of several House primaries Tuesday will shape just how competitive these key races will be in the general election. Many of those seats are in California. Here are the projected winners of those races outside the Golden State:\n\nNorth Carolina’s 1st District: Laurie Buckhout will win the Republican primary to take on Democratic Rep. Don Davis, CNN projects. The 1st District, which was redrawn last year to become friendlier toward Republicans, is North Carolina’s sole competitive seat after redistricting. Republicans are targeting the seat heading into the fall, and the GOP primary served as a test of the party’s ideological direction. Buckhout, a retired US Army colonel, had the backing of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC tied to House GOP leadership.\n\nTexas’ 15th District: Michelle Vallejo will win the Democratic primary, CNN projects, putting her on track for a rematch against GOP Rep. Monica De La Cruz. Democrats are targeting this South Texas seat, which Trump would have narrowly carried in 2020 under the current lines. Vallejo ran as a progressive last cycle but lost to De La Cruz by 9 points.\n\nTexas’ 34th District: Former Rep. Mayra Flores will win the Republican nomination, CNN projects, setting herself up for a rematch with Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez. Flores was elected to Congress in a special election in June 2022 but lost to Gonzalez in the general election held under new district lines that fall. Flores has received some high-profile endorsements, including from House Speaker Mike Johnson, in her comeback bid in South Texas.\n\nCNN Projection: Biden will win the Vermont Democratic primary\n\nPresident Joe Biden will win the Democratic primary in Vermont, CNN projects.\n\nThere were 16 pledged delegates at stake in the primary.\n\nIn 2020, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic contest. Biden came in second place.\n\nTrump meets with Elon Musk amid fundraising concerns\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is watching the returns Tuesday night with his political team after spending the weekend hosting donors at Mar-a-Lago in Florida as he seeks to raise more money and is deeply concerned about his finances.\n\nHe also met with Elon Musk in recent days, a source familiar tells CNN, though it’s not clear whether the Tesla CEO plans to donate to Trump.\n\nThe meeting with Musk was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nNikki Haley has no public appearances tonight while Trump has invited hundreds of his supporters, donors and elected officials to his Mar-a-Lago club — a Super Tuesday of contrasts for the remaining GOP presidential contenders.\n\nBiden campaign sends out fundraising push as polls begin to close in some states\n\nAs primary polls begin to close in some states, President Joe Biden’s campaign is already looking to the general election and asking donors to chip in to help fight against an “onslaught of attacks,” from former President Donald Trump’s campaign.\n\nThe email, which the campaign blasted out just minutes after polls in Virginia and Vermont closed at 7 p.m. ET, warns that “Trump and his MAGA extremism is a threat to our democracy, and we must do everything we can to defeat him.”\n\nBut it also offers a glimpse into how the Biden campaign has largely approached the GOP field since January’s New Hampshire GOP primary, when campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez announced Trump “has all but locked up the GOP nomination,” before turning the campaign’s attention to the former president and the general election in November.\n\nCNN Projection: Robinson will win North Carolina GOP gubernatorial nomination\n\nNorth Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson will win the Republican nomination for governor, CNN projects, setting up a general election campaign in the Tar Heel State that could mirror the anticipated presidential matchup in a crucial 2024 battleground.\n\nRobinson defeated two other candidates to get the party’s nod.\n\nEndorsed by former President Donald Trump on the eve of the primary, Robinson has been the state’s second-ranked executive since 2021, serving under (and in opposition to) term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Robinson will slide comfortably onto a ticket with Trump in November. A fierce supporter of gun rights and abortion bans, he has also faced accusations of dabbling in antisemitic, misogynist and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.\n\nRead more about the North Carolina governor’s race.\n\nUtah Democrats and Republicans will use different methods to allocate delegates\n\nUtah Republicans have opted to have party-run caucuses to allocate delegates rather than participate in the state-run party.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats have used different processes in recent cycles, in 2020 both parties participated in the state-run primary.\n\nRepublican caucuses will open at 9 p.m. ET and voters can drop off ballots until 11 p.m. ET. Polls in the Democratic primary will close at 10 p.m. ET\n\nBoth party’s methods will allocate delegates to candidates, but there are some key differences between primaries and caucuses:\n\nPrimaries: It’s an election to select candidates, usually for a particular political party, to appear on the general election ballot. Unlike caucuses, they are held throughout the day and always use a private ballot. For Democrats, President Joe Biden is the incumbent. Who can vote in primaries depends on the state. Utah has an open primary, meaning any registered voters can participate.\n\nCaucuses: While the form caucuses take varies from state to state, they are typically held at a specific time and often give voters an opportunity to listen to prospective candidate representatives before registering support for their candidate of choice. In some states, voters organize themselves into groups supporting their candidate, thus making their selection known to others. In other states, voters will write their choice on a piece of people that is then counted. In Utah, only affiliated Republicans may vote but unaffiliated voters may register Republican at the caucuses.\n\nAbout 36% of total GOP delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday\n\nWinning the GOP nomination requires at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, a consequentially large number of Republican delegates are at stake.\n\nIn 13 primaries and three caucuses, 874 delegates, 36% of the Republican total, will be up for grabs, including in California, the state with the most Republican delegates. But we still aren’t even halfway through the primaries.\n\nRead more about how Republicans chose a nominee.\n\nThe key down-ballot primaries happening in California today\n\nCentral to the fight for control of the House chamber is California. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the House, and in California alone, the party is targeting seven GOP-held seats.\n\nHere’s what to know about the key down-ballot races happening in the state Tuesday:\n\n22nd Congressional District: GOP Rep. David Valadao, a perennial Democratic target in a Central Valley district that would have backed Biden by 13 points, is facing competition from both sides Tuesday – two Democrats and one other Republican are also on the ballot. Because it’s a four-way race, both national parties have spent money trying to make sure their preferred candidates don’t get locked out of the November election.\n\n45th District: Held by GOP Rep. Michelle Steel, it offers Democratic voters a choice between multiple candidates in this Orange County seat. Garden Grove Council Member Kim Nguyen-Penaloza has the backing of BOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as a handful of members of the California congressional delegation. Army veteran Derek Tran has his own congressional endorsements, as well as the support of VoteVets, which works to elect progressive veterans to Congress, and the political arm of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition. Biden would have won this district by 6 points. Inside Elections rates the race Lean Republican.\n\n47th District: After Democratic Rep. Katie Porter decided to run for Senate, Republicans hope former state Assemblyman Scott Baugh, who lost to Porter in 2022, will have a better shot at flipping this Orange County seat without challenging an incumbent.\n\n13th District: A rematch of 2022 looms in the Central Valley, with GOP Rep. John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray the only names on the ballot Tuesday. The DCCC has named Gray to its Red to Blue list for competitive challengers. Duarte defeated Gray by just 564 votes in 2022. Biden won the seat by 11 points and Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate: The jockeying for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat began well before she died. Tuesday’s primary will determine which two candidates will advance to November in an election that has seen more ad spending, excluding future reservations, than any other nonpresidential federal contest so far.\n\nKeep reading about other key down-ballot primaries in state on Super Tuesday.\n\nBiden \"will be kept updated\" on Super Tuesday results throughout the night, White House says\n\nPresident Joe Biden “will be kept updated,” throughout the evening as Super Tuesday primary results come in, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\n“I have not spoken to him about his plans tonight. Obviously, he will be kept updated, and he’ll be aware of what’s going on tonight as we see elections happening across the country. I just don’t have anything specific,” she said during the White House press briefing.\n\nBiden returned to the White House from Camp David Tuesday, where he spent the weekend huddled with advisers ahead of Thursday’s State of the Union Address.\n\nThe president has remained out of sight during primary election nights so far this year, foregoing the traditional victory remarks for paper statements from his campaign following primary wins in South Carolina, Nevada and Michigan.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some key demographics in Tennessee\n\nIn Tennessee, 58 Republican delegates are at stake in tonight’s primary election. Here’s the breakdown of education rates, the rural population and income levels across the Volunteer State.\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema announces she's retiring\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona independent, announced Tuesday she will retire at the end of her term this year.\n\nShe blamed growing partisanship and mudslinging in Washington for driving her decision to not run for reelection, only a few weeks after the Senate rejected the bipartisan, negotiated compromise on immigration policy that she had worked on for months.\n\n“I believe in my approach, but it’s not what America wants right now,” Sinema continued. “Despite modernizing our infrastructure, ensuring clean water, delivering good jobs and safer communities, Americans still choose to retreat farther to their partisan corners.”\n\n“It’s all or nothing, the outcome less important than beating the other guy,” she added. “Compromise is a dirty word.”\n\nBiden warns Trump will contest November results if he loses\n\nPresident Joe Biden is bracing for an ugly November in a race against Donald Trump, suggesting that if the former president loses, he will contest the results.\n\nThe president has repeatedly cast Trump as a “loser” on the campaign trail and at closed-door fundraisers. And in a campaign speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, earlier this year, he framed Trump as the “election denier-in-chief.”\n\nBiden’s view is also held by many Americans: In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS out last month, just 25% of Americans say they expect Trump to accept the results if he loses in November as the Republican nominee, down from 37% in October 2020. By contrast, 76% of Americans expect that Biden would concede if he loses, similar to the 71% who said the same four years ago.\n\nTrump’s refusal to concede in 2020 and his election lies led to a violent insurrection at the US Capitol, eventually leading to a federal election subversion case."
