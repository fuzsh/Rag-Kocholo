This, however, is not his story. This is the story of the Puffs who just happened to be there too. Wayne Hopkins is a regular boy who finds he’s a wizard and goes to school in England where he makes two best friends and has adventures. Perhaps this sounds familiar. But, Wayne is sorted as a Puff, a group of well-meaning, loyal outsiders who simply want to learn how to be wizards and avoid attacks by evil wizards. Their heartfelt and epic journey takes the classic story to new places and reimagines what a boy wizard hero can be. A tale for anyone who has never been destined to save the world.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Recommended for mature audiences.

(www.concordtheatricals.com)\n\nThe Wickhams: Christmas at Pemberley\n\nBy Lauren Gunderson & Margot Melcon\n\nDirected by Mary Trotter\n\nPlaywrights Lauren Gunderson and Margot Melcon once again bring Jane Austen’s beloved characters to the stage for a yuletide sequel to Pride and Prejudice. The Wickhams takes audiences to the downstairs servants’ quarters as the newly wed Darcy’s celebrate Christmas upstairs. Mrs. Reynolds, a no-nonsense housekeeper; Cassie, an eager new maid; and Brian, a lovesick footman, are bustling with preparations for holiday guests. The servants find themselves in the midst of a holiday scandal when their work is interrupted by the midnight arrival of the definitely not invited Mr. Wickham—Lydia’s rogue of a husband and Mr. Darcy’s sworn enemy. Before long, old grudges and new misunderstandings reach a boiling point, and the festivities spiral into chaos. Pemberley’s residents struggle to keep the peace without taking sides. The Wickhams is a charming holiday tale that explores the confines of class, privilege, family, forgiveness, and what it truly means to give in the season of giving.\n\nPerformance Dates:\n\nDecember 5-7, 2024 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nDecember 7-8, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nToland Theatre, Lowe Center for the Arts\n\n333 N. 16th Street, La Crosse\n\nAssigned Seating.\n\nONLINE TICKETS: $20 adults; $18 senior citizens/non UWL students/military; $8 UWL students.

The legendary family-run Hotel Messina on the Italian Rivieria has been visited by artists, celebrities, and royalty. But when the owner’s daughter, Hero, weds a dashing young soldier, Claudio, the course of true love doesn’t run smoothly. Fast-flying gossip and thick-headed pride threaten to bring down the fairytale marriage as it goes from swoon to scandal. With honor and friendship on the line, adversaries Beatrice and Benedick put their savage battle of wits on hold to restore order. For Beatrice and Benedict, love is a force they believe they’re above even though their friends can see past their stubborn souls to see the truth hiding in their hearts.\n\nWith fun, warmth, and depth, Shakespeare combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor, shame, and court politics.\n\nPerformance Dates:\n\nFebruary 28-March 1 & March 7-8, 2025 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nMarch 2 & 9, 2025 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nToland Theatre, Lowe Center for the Arts\n\n333 N. 16th Street, La Crosse\n\nAssigned Seating.\n\nONLINE TICKETS: $20 adults; $18 senior citizens/non UWL students; $8 UWL students.

After all, it holds her shiny quarters, movie star sunglasses, and plays a jaunty tune. That is, until Lilly’s purse becomes such a distraction in the classroom that Mr. Slinger takes it away. Lilly is outraged by Mr. Slinger’s “betrayal”, which propels her to some pretty inappropriate reactions. With a little help from her Grammy and her friends Chester and Wilson, Lilly learns that sharing, cooperation, and some crunchy cheese snacks can go a long way. Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the book by Kevin Henkes, join us in Lilly’s colorful world of imagination.\n\nSchool Performance Dates:\n\nApril 2-4, 2025 at 9:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 1:00 p.m.\n\nBeginning Monday, August 25, please contact the UWL Department of Theatre and Dance at 608-785-6701 to register your school group.
