        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. | January 8, 2024 — The Kansas City Symphony announces the collaboration of Kansas City’s own hip hop star, Tech N9ne, together with your Kansas City Symphony on Saturday, May 4 at 8PM at the historic Midland Theatre in Downtown Kansas City, Mo.\n\nOut of the Midwest, Tech N9ne broke all of the rules, subverted expectations, dumbfounded the system, and set a precedent for hip-hop and independent music often imitated (but never duplicated) by generations to follow. At the helm of his own Strange Music proudly based in Kansas City, MO since 2000, he has personally notched four platinum singles, eleven gold singles, and two gold albums. As a whole, the Strange Music catalog also houses 23 RIAA gold and platinum records. Representing the underground, Tech is practically “a regular” on the Forbes Cash Kings list. Beyond gracing the cover of XXL, the stage of ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! and making an appearance on GMA3, he notably performed to 1 million-plus at the parade for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl victory. He holds down the record for “most Top 10 albums” on the Billboard Rap Chart and staked a spot in the Top 5 of the Billboard 200 four times.\n\nAfter three decades in the game, the rapper landed “the biggest hit of his career” with 2021’s “Face Off” featuring Joey Cool, King Iso, and none other than megastar Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Tech N9ne continued his journey in 2023 with the acclaimed BLISS, and then closed out the year by being awarded with a proclamation in Kansas City, MO and being the 1st hip hop artist in the 94-year history of the Country Club Plaza holiday lighting ceremony to flip the switch to kick off the Kansas City Christmas season! Together with your Kansas City Symphony, this incredible evening of music with Tech N9ne will be like no other.\n\nTICKETS:\n\nCall (816) 471-0400, Monday-Friday, 10AM-5PM\n\nVisit kcsymphony.org\n\nIn-person at Shirley Bush Helzberg Symphony House, 1644 Wyandotte St., Kansas City, MO 64108\n\nAbout the Kansas City Symphony\n\nFounded in 1982, the Kansas City Symphony has established itself as a major force in the cultural life of the community. Praised for performances of uncompromising standard, the orchestra is the largest in the region and enjoys a national reputation under the artistic leadership of Music Director Michael Stern. The Symphony performs more than 130 concerts each year, reaching more than 250,000 community members. The Symphony welcomes guests of international acclaim as part of its Classical and Pops series and serves as the orchestra for the Kansas City Ballet and Lyric Opera of Kansas City.\n\nComplementing its full schedule of concerts, the Symphony enriches the lives of Kansas City residents by providing music education opportunities for children and adults, such as KinderKonzerts, Young People’s Concerts, an instrument petting zoo and concert comments. The Mobile Music Box, a popup stage created by the Symphony during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaches thousands of audience members each season with dozens of chamber music concerts throughout the Kansas City metro area.\n\nThe Symphony has released nine highly praised CDs to date with Reference Recordings. The latest release features one-movement symphonies by Samuel Barber, Jean Sibelius and Alexander Scriabin. The Symphony and Michael Stern also have recorded for the Naxos label. Kansas City’s new classical music radio station, 91.9 ClassicalKC, broadcasts Kansas City Symphony performances each week. For more information on the Symphony, please visit kcsymphony.org."
