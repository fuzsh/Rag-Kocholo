        "text": "Is the University of Arkansas test-optional?\n\nThe University of Arkansas will offer test-optional admission, as well as other application pathways.\n\nHowever, please keep the following requirements in mind:\n\nYou will need to submit ACT or SAT test scores by February 1 to be considered for most merit-based scholarships and fellowships.\n\nYou must have ACT, SAT, or Next Generation Accuplace scores on file by May 1 for placement and enrollment purposes during orientation and to comply with state requirements.\n\nWhat are the students like at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville?\n\nLocated in Fayetteville â one of the nationâs best places to live â the University of Arkansas is a destination for students interested in business, engineering, architecture, art, education, and the humanities. Our students have access to internships with some of the worldâs most famous companies. They participate in one-on-one research with renowned faculty and study abroad in more than 50 countries. They learn in small classes, led by professors passionate about the subjects they teach. Best of all, our students have the academic support and career guidance needed to prepare for success after graduation.\n\nWhere will I live on campus?\n\nFreshmen are required to live in University Housing their first year, unless you live within 70 miles of U of A; then you are able to live at home with a parent or legal guardian.\n\nThere are many diverse, on-campus housing options where roommates become lifelong friends and fun activities are just steps away. The university offers Living Learning Communities where students are grouped based on major or interest and can participate in additional programming throughout the year.\n\nRegardless of where you live, you can expect the support of a professional staff dedicated to providing an on-campus experience that will promote academic excellence and personal growth. Please visit our housing website for more information.\n\nWhat about Financial Aid and Scholarships?\n\nThe university is committed to assisting you in finding the means to earn an education here, whether through one of our many scholarship programs or by a combination of loans, grants, and/or work-study opportunities. Learn more at finaid.uark.edu.\n\nOur academic scholarships are awarded between February and April to accepted students with the best grades, strongest coursework, most competitive standardized test scores, and strongest indications of leadership potential and community involvement.\n\nOur counselors are always available to work with students and their families to come up with a plan for financing their U of A education. We encourage you to come and talk with us if you ever feel that finances will get in the way of enrolling in classes or continuing your education.\n\nCan I find a job?\n\nWhen approached wisely, working while in school can be a wonderful opportunity. We recommend that you first seek part-time employment on campus. If you are on financial aid, work study may be a part of your aid package. The Financial Aid Office (in Silas Hunt Hall) has a list of jobs available for these funds.\n\nYou may also work on campus as a regular, part-time employee. In both areas, the range of jobs are huge â from library work to answering telephones to assisting faculty in their labs. To learn about some of these opportunities, call our campus employment hot-line at (479) 575-5627 (JOBS) or view the listings online.\n\nFayetteville and the surrounding Northwest Arkansas region provide excellent employment opportunities as well.\n\nWhen do I register for courses?\n\nAll incoming freshmen will attend New Student Orientation before their first semester on campus, during which time you will meet with academic advisors before finalizing your class schedule.\n\nOnce you begin your freshman year, you will be able to register in advance before leaving for break each semester. You will also have another chance to register for classes before each new semester begins. The process is managed through the university's student information system â UAConnect.\n\nWhat if I need academic help?\n\nCollege advisors are able to connect students with a variety of academic support resources. Libraries, computer labs, mentoring by upperclassmen, the Student Success Center, and more are available to help all students through the academic challenges they may encounter.\n\nInstructors have office hours and are available to meet with you about any concerns or questions regarding course material.\n\nWhat if I get sick?\n\nThe professional staff at the Pat Walker Health Center can take care of almost any medical issue from X-rays to counseling. Primary care physicians, specialists, nurse practitioners, and counselors are on hand to address both routine and emergency medical and mental health issues. Each medical clinic can bill with most major insurance providers. Guidance about billing and insurance is available on the Pat Walker Health Center website.\n\nFor convenient access to prescriptions, there is a pharmacy in the Walmart on Campus location across Garland Ave. from the Health Center.\n\nHow much will it cost for me to attend the U of A?\n\nA higher education is an important and sometimes costly investment. A breakdown of tuition and fees is available through the Office of Financial Aid. We encourage students and their families to use our online Tuition and Fees Estimator to get an idea of the cost associated with attending the U of A.\n\nHow will I get around? Is a car necessary?\n\nThe Razorback Transit System is a great way to get around campus and explore the surrounding town of Fayetteville. It serves the entire campus while also providing access to and from residential neighborhoods, supermarkets, local banks, the Fayetteville Square, Walmart, and the mall, all free of charge.\n\nStudents are allowed to bring their cars to campus. This is convenient for students who wish to go home for the weekend or explore the local area. Students wishing to park a car on campus must purchase a parking permit from Parking and Transit or pay hourly at some locations.\n\nWill I get lost in the crowd?\n\nTransitioning to a large campus can be an exciting and, at times, overwhelming venture. We encourage you to get involved in the campus community by attending sporting events, theatre performances, concerts, films, art exhibitions, and much more. The university offers over 400 Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) based on interests ranging from rock climbing to living optimistically, or you can join Associated Student Government (ASG) to help develop initiatives that benefit all students. To stay active, explore our many club and intramural sports. At the U of A, there is no shortage of opportunities to connect with other students outside of the classroom.\n\nWhat about the quality of the faculty and academic programs?\n\nThe University of Arkansas was recently elevated to the highest possible classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, a status held by only a select number of the top universities in the nation. The hard work and innovative research of our internationally-recognized faculty help the University of Arkansas maintain its status as a leader in academia.\n\nWhen do students declare their major?\n\nMany incoming students are undecided about their major. University core courses, which are common to nearly every major on campus, are designed for flexibility during the first two years. However, you are encouraged to work closely with an advisor to ensure graduation within four years.\n\nSome majors are more defined and structured. If you are interested in architecture or engineering, you should try to decide as early as possible. Architecture students should declare their major at the time of admission, and engineering students should declare their major during the First-Year Engineering program.\n\nDoes the U of A offer any internship or co-op programs?\n\nYes, our students have access to internship and co-op program opportunities in almost every academic program.\n\nCo-ops provide students with a salary as well as practical work experience while they attend classes on campus. Students may even receive academic credit for their co-op experiences.\n\nStudents also have the opportunity for internship and co-op experiences abroad in countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Japan. Many students also pursue internship opportunities with one of the many Fortune 500 companies located in the Northwest Arkansas region.\n\nDoes the U of A offer career placement?\n\nThe Career Development Center (CDC) works hard to help University of Arkansas students be competitive for the jobs they will pursue after graduation. Counselors can help you look for internships, polish your rÃ©sumÃ©, improve your interviewing skills, and more. Each year the CDC organizes multiple career fairs which allow you to interact with representatives from companies across the nation.\n\nShould I pick a major now?\n\nYou do not have to pick a major now. Coursework during the first two years is flexible for most majors. However, students pursuing some majors - such as architecture - are encouraged to declare early. If you are undecided, you should discuss major possibilities during your first semester with an academic advisor.\n\nWhat programs are there for incoming freshmen?\n\nNew Student and Family Programs oversee many programs such as R.O.C.K. Camp, UARK Cardinal Nights, A-Week, and leadership programs to help new students find their place on campus and meet fellow classmates.\n\nWill I feel safe at the University of Arkansas?\n\nCampus safety measures include 90 campus emergency phones connected to central police dispatch, closed circuit security cameras, and electronic doors requiring security cards for access to residence hall. Students who wish for additional assistance can contact Razorback Patrol and request a walking escort. UAPD officers also are available for assistance. Another option for both on-campus and off-campus is Safe Ride, a regularly scheduled van service.\n\nThe Pat Walker Health Center plays a major role in teaching students safety strategies. Programs focus on risk reduction, personal safety, and the safety of others.\n\nIn accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, more information concerning safety along with the annual Clery security report can be found on uapd.uark.edu. The report in its entirety is available for download as a PDF. A paper copy of the report will be provided upon request.\n\nDoes the U of A have an admissions waitlist?"
