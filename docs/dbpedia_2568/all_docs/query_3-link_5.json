Their granddaughter, Ellie, doesn’t have time in her own busy life to ponder the afterlife. But when mortality confronts them, her grandmother’s claim to have gone to heaven and back doesn’t sound so crazy after all. With thoughtful storytelling and quiet wit, Brunstetter looks at beginnings, endings — and an enigmatic angel.\n\nHarold and Maude by Colin Higgins (US)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 6w, 6m)\n\nWriter Colin Higgins adapted his beloved screenplay into this hit stage play about a lonely 19-year-old boy who finally learns how to truly live when he meets a delightfully wacky octogenarian.

What would we remember, and what would we forget, if given the chance? In this richly spare, wondrous new play, Jordan Harrison explores the mysteries of human identity and the limits — if any — of what technology can replace. Marjorie Prime premiered at the Mark Taper Forum/Center Theater Group in Los Angeles in September 2014. The production starred Lois Smith as Marjorie and was directed by Les Waters.\n\nNana’s Naughty Knickers by Katherine DiSavino (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 5w, 3m, 1 any gender)\n\nBridget and her grandmother are about to become roommates.

Gardner, once a famous poet, now is retired. He slips in and out of senility as his wife Fanny valiantly tries to keep them both afloat. They have asked their daughter, Mags, to come home and help them move. Mags agrees, for she hopes as well to finally paint their portrait. She is now on the verge of artistic celebrity herself and hopes, by painting her parents, to come to terms with them and they with her. Mags triumphs in the end as Fanny and Gardner actually step through the frame and become a work of art ineffable and timeless. Painting Churches debuted in 1983 in an off-Broadway production with Second Stage, directed by Carole Rothman, and starring George N. Martin as Gardner, Marian Seldes as Fanny and Elizabeth McGovern as Mags.\n\nQuartet by Ronald Harwood (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 2w, 2m)\n\nCecily, Reggie and Wilfred reside in a home for retired opera singers in Kent, England.

Meanwhile, retired chemist Henry Mitchell develops a blue pill called “Venusia” to increase the libido of menopausal women. The women mix up Bud’s Viagra pills with the Venusia, and we soon discover that it has a strange effect on men: it gives them all the symptoms of menopausal women, complete with hot flashes, mood swings, weeping and irritability! When the mayhem settles down, all the women find their lives moving in new and surprising directions.\n\nSouthern Comforts by Kathleen Clark (US)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 1w, 1m)\n\nIn a sprawling New Jersey Victorian, a taciturn Yankee widower and a vivacious grandmother from Tennessee find what they least expected — a second chance at love.

Taking My Turn was one of the first musicals to deal with aging. The spoken words were collected from interviews with people “in their prime,” which became the basis for the non-linear book. The size of the cast may vary according to the needs of each production.\n\nThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel by Deborah Moggach (UK)\n\n(Drama / 8w, 6m)\n\nBased on the Sunday Times bestseller which inspired one of this century’s most treasured films, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel takes us on a journey to India with an eclectic group of British retirees as they embark on a new life.

Coburn (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Dramatic Comedy / 1w, 1m)\n\nThis winner of the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, which originally starred Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn and was later revived with Julie Harris and Charles Durning, then Cicely Tyson and James Earl Jones, uses a card game as a metaphor for life. Weller Martin is playing solitaire on the porch of a seedy nursing home. Enter Fonsia Dorsey, a prim, self-righteous lady. They discover they both dislike the home and enjoy gin rummy, so they begin to play and to reveal intimate details of their lives.

Ever want to commit a murder? Walter, the playwright’s alter ego in this madcap mystery, demonstrates just how to do someone in — in your imagination, of course!\n\nThe Puzzle with the Piazza by Mark Dunn (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 4w, 1m)\n\nA story of a septuagenarian, who has one jigsaw puzzle among her large collection that she’s never finished. It contains 3,000 pieces and she has less than a day to finish it, because poor health has forced her to move in with her younger sister… without her puzzles. This gentle, bittersweet play explores the fragility of family ties and the often much stronger bonds of friendship that lattice the final years of our lives.\n\nThe Sunshine Boys by Neil Simon (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Comedy / 2w, 5m)\n\nIn Neil Simon’s classic laugh-a-minute comedy, Al and Willie, as “Lewis and Clark,” were top-billed vaudevillians for over 40 years.

The management wants to replace her less-than-thriving gallery with a coffee shop. Always irascible but now increasingly erratic, Gladys is a cause of concern to her daughter, her son-in-law, and her grandson, from whose point of view this poignant memory play is told. A wacky and heartrending look at the effect of senility on a family, The Waverly Gallery was a success in its 2000 premiere at New York’s Promenade Theatre, winning an Obie for legendary Eileen Heckart in the role of Gladys. Nineteen years later, the play premiered on Broadway, earning a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play and a Tony Award for 86-year-old leading actress Elaine May.\n\nThe Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion (US)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Drama / 1f)\n\nIn this dramatic adaptation of her award-winning, bestselling memoir, which The New York Times called “an indelible portrait of loss and grief… a haunting portrait of a four-decade-long marriage,” Joan Didion transforms the story of the sudden and unexpected loss of her husband and their only daughter into a stunning and powerful one-woman play.

Lotta chooses to stay with her old friends rather than go live with her son.\n\nWings by Arthur Kopit (US/UK)\n\n(Full-Length Play, Drama / 5w, 4m)\n\nAn actress’s tour de force, this remarkable play starred Constance Cummings in a Tony-winning performance. Emily Stilson, 70 years old and a celebrated former aviatrix and stunt pilot, suffers a stroke and is plunged into a world of disorientation and grief. Memories flood in between painful attempts to relearn the basic functions of everyday life. Aided by a dedicated young therapist, Emily’s flights of memory and emotion create an evocative portrait of the ability of the human spirit to renew and survive. The stunning musical adaptation of Wings (US/UK), an off-Broadway hit at the Public Theater, is also available for licensing.\n\nFor more great plays and musicals featuring seniors, visit Concord Theatricals in the US or UK.\n\nHeader image: 2015 Playwrights Horizons production of Marjorie Prime (Jeremy Daniel)"
