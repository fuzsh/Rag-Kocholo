        "text": "Your Guide to Benefits for Seniors Over 65\n\nAre you looking for discounts or government benefits for seniors over 65?\n\nIt can be difficult to find many of these senior citizen benefits.\n\nWhether you’re looking for government programs or financial assistance, we’ve started the research for you.\n\nIn this article, we have compiled a list of government benefits and discounts that may be available for seniors in America today.\n\nWhat Benefits Do Seniors Get?\n\nThere are many benefits, programs, and discounts available for seniors over the age of 65.\n\nMany of these programs offer free or reduced-cost options, such as:\n\nHealth care\n\nTransportation services\n\nHousing assistance\n\nPrescription drugs\n\nRecreational activities\n\nFood and dining\n\nNote: This blog post will focus on nationwide senior citizen benefits. However, there may be other benefits that vary by state.\n\nBe sure to check with local and state government agencies to learn more about other opportunities that your particular state may offer in addition to the nationwide benefits below.\n\nTypes of Programs With Benefits for Seniors Over 65\n\nMembers of the senior citizen community are often in need of programs designed for their specific needs.\n\nIf you’re a family member looking to find resources and programs that could benefit your loved one, there are many perks to be found in these types of programs geared toward seniors over 65.\n\nThere is also information about what types of programs might work best for your loved one’s individual needs and interests.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about:\n\nThese types of programs\n\nHow seniors can enroll in them\n\nEligibility requirements\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) is a government agency that provides financial support to seniors over the age of 65.\n\nThe money comes from payroll taxes, which are withheld from every working American’s paycheck.\n\nThe Social Security Administration keeps track of each person who pays into the system.\n\nThen, they make sure you have enough for retirement by investing your money in special securities that can be accessed through the following programs.\n\nMedicare Savings Programs\n\nMedicare Savings Programs are free government benefits for seniors over 65 that can help with the costs of healthcare.\n\nTo assist eligible participants, Medicare Savings Programs help those who have limited resources and incomes pay for some or all of their Medicare expenses, such as:\n\nMedicare premiums\n\nDeductibles\n\nCo-payments\n\nNote: Medicare Savings Programs may vary by state.\n\nSocial Security Retirement Insurance Benefits\n\nIndividuals who meet the following requirements may apply for Social Security Retirement Insurance benefits:\n\nHave earned enough credits\n\nAge 62 or above\n\nU.S citizen or legal immigrant\n\nTake the Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool questionnaire to find out if you are eligible for any of the Social Security benefits.\n\nReverse Mortgage Program\n\nSeniors who meet the following requirements established by the Reverse Mortgage Program may receive a guaranteed monthly income payment:\n\nAge 62 and older\n\nOwn their own home\n\nHave substantial value in home equity\n\nThe HUD Reverse Mortgage Program‘s most appealing features are that the older homeowner does not have to …\n\nRepay any of the money they receive from the reverse mortgage; or\n\nMake interest payments on it\n\n… as long as they live in their home.\n\nMedicare\n\nRetirees should not have to worry about obtaining health coverage or the sometimes hefty out-of-pocket costs of insurance plans purchased through state healthcare exchanges.\n\nHow can these costs be reduced?\n\nYou can join Medicare as soon as you reach age 65.\n\nHere is how Medicare works:\n\nMedicare Part A provides hospital insurance that does not cost anything for most retirees.\n\nMedicare Part B, which covers doctor’s visits and medical care, is $148.50 per month — although some beneficiaries could pay more.\n\nMedicare Part B premiums can be taken from your Social Security payment, so you won’t get a bill.\n\nRetirees may be eligible for the supplemental Medicare Part D, which means that their prescription costs are covered by the government.\n\nThese senior citizen benefits can help those over the age of 65 to live healthier, more financially secure lives.\n\nGovernment Benefits for Seniors Over 65\n\nSome additional government benefits for seniors over 65 are:\n\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), a federal disability insurance program\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), a federal cash assistance program for low-income people who are age 65 or older, blind, or disabled\n\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States of America serving veterans of military conflicts past and present as well as their families\n\nLow-cost prescription drug programs offered by pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy\n\nOther Financial Benefits for Seniors Over 65\n\nMany of us think that the Social Security Administration is the only way for seniors over 65 to receive financial support.\n\nHowever, there are several senior citizen benefits the government is not funding.\n\nSome of these financial benefits include:\n\nSenior discounts\n\nTravel deals\n\nTax deductions\n\nRetirement account limits\n\nInsurance policy conversion\n\nVeteran-Specific Financial Assistance\n\nCheck out the following programs and discounts that may be available for seniors over 65.\n\nSenior Discounts\n\nYou may be able to save money on your next restaurant dinner or retail purchase if you’re willing to be forthcoming about your age.\n\nA variety of places, like …\n\nMuseums\n\nGrocery stores\n\nBowling alleys\n\nMovie theaters; and\n\nOther entertainment facilities\n\n… offer reduced admission fees to individuals who are over a certain age.\n\nAARP (American Association of Retired Persons), a non-profit organization, negotiates discounts for members who can join at age 50.\n\nNote: Senior citizen benefits and discounts are not always advertised, and in many cases, they’re only offered to those who ask about discounts and can show proof of their age.\n\nTravel Deals\n\nYou know how expensive it can be to travel.\n\nHowever, there are several ways that seniors can get great deals on their trips:\n\nSeniors who are over a certain age or AARP members may be eligible to receive a price reduction from hotels and car rental agencies.\n\nSome Amtrak fares are discounted by 10% for passengers aged 65 and older.\n\nSenior citizens who are permanent residents of the United States and are 62 or older can purchase a National Park Service lifetime pass for as low as $80.\n\nImagine visiting the Grand Canyon, Yosemite National Park, or Yellowstone for a fraction of what you would have paid otherwise.\n\nTax Deductions\n\n​​Seniors may claim a higher standard deduction on their taxes than younger individuals.\n\nFor every senior citizen who is 65 or older, the standard deduction could be $1,350; or\n\nIf both spouses in a married couple fulfill the age requirement, the typical deduction might be as high as $2700.\n\nThere are additional deductions for those who are older than a specific age and below a defined income level.\n\nFor example, seniors may also be eligible for deferrals on their property tax, school taxes, or both.\n\nRetirement Account Limits\n\nWorkers aged 50 and older can contribute as much as $26,000 to a 401(k) plan and defer paying income tax on that amount, which is $6,500 more than younger employees and business owners.\n\nThe maximum amount that can be contributed to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is also $1,000 higher for individuals 50 and older, or $7,000.\n\nBut there is a catch…\n\nAfter age 72, you usually must withdraw funds from traditional retirement accounts and pay the resulting tax bill.\n\nHowever, any amount up to $100,000 that individuals who are age 70 1/2 or older move directly from an IRA to a qualifying charity is tax-free.\n\nInsurance Policy Conversion\n\nIf you’ve been helping your loved one go through their paperwork and come across any old life insurance policies, don’t assume they’re worthless.\n\nIn reality, their life insurance may be a valuable resource.\n\nYou may use the cash value of a life insurance policy to help pay for assisted living or long-term care costs if you convert it into a long-term care benefit.\n\nHowever, surrendering or neglecting to renew a policy might result in little cash.\n\nSome companies can buy policies at their current worth.\n\nThe funds are then:\n\nTransferred as a deposit into an FDIC-insured account in the senior’s name.\n\nAllocated tax-free to their care provider every month.\n\nEvery sort of life insurance coverage – from basic to term to group coverage – should work.\n\nTherefore, it’s worth checking out this option.\n\nVeteran-Specific Financial Assistance\n\nThe Veterans Administration (VA) program may be able to assist senior citizens if they served in the active-duty armed forces during a war.\n\nThe VA Non-Service Connected Pension program provides veterans who served in a war with a guaranteed monthly payment.\n\nThis program, called Aid and Attendance, may help pay for the costs of the eligible veterans who are elderly living in:\n\nTheir home\n\nNursing homes\n\nAssisted living; or\n\nIndependent living communities\n\nTo be eligible, applicants must fulfill basic criteria for active federal service during wartime and specific financial criteria such as income and asset limitations.\n\nExplore Educational Resources for Seniors at Senior Services of America\n\nAre you looking for even more information about benefits for seniors 65 or older?\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nOur goal is to make sure that seniors have the opportunity to live their best lives possible, so we provide them with the tools necessary to do just that."
