        "text": "Have you ever wondered what it is like to live in space? Now is your chance to learn how astronauts prepare for life in space at NASA Johnson Space Center.\n\nNew Perspectives is a 20 minute live presentation presented by our Mission Briefing Officers that gives you a glimpse into the lives of astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nIn our ISS replica, you can experience what it is like to live in space. Learn how astronauts exercise, eat and perform research at their home in space.\n\nThis presentation allows audiences to interact with and simulate some of the challenges astronauts must overcome, as well as discover the science behind what it takes to live in space.\n\nSee how astronauts use an arm bicycle to workout in orbit, how they strap themselves to the wall to sleep and learn through X-ray technology how gravity affects the human body.\n\nLearn how astronauts communicate with Earth and whether they use Wi-Fi. Acquire a better understanding of the experiments that go on at the station and how they benefit us on Earth.\n\nRecognize the conditions astronauts must overcome, how astronauts receive supplies to survive and see artifacts that astronauts use daily to survive the seemingly impossible. This interactive presentation gives everyone the opportunity to imagine life as an astronaut.\n\nNew Perspectives is located in our International Space Station Gallery."
