        "text": "Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz took the stage together for the first time on Tuesday as official running mates on the Democratic presidential ticket, with the 2024 election just 90 days away.\n\nThe pair arrived before the more than 12,000-strong crowd at Temple University in Philadelphia to roars of applause.\n\nOnstage, the vice president praised Walz’s Midwest roots as a teacher, veteran, congressman, and governor responsible for policies like free school lunch for kids and protections to codify abortion rights.\n\n“I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future,” Harris said.\n\nWalz, for his part, gave a fiery speech of his own, balancing calls to bring “joy” back to politics with cutting attacks on the GOP campaign, mocking Donald Trump and JD Vance as out-of-touch leaders who were “weird as hell” and lying about their connections to Project 2025. He also made a joke about...that...NSFW rumor about Vance and a couch.\n\nWalz beat out a crowded field of rivals to be the Democratic pick for VP, including Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, who appeared at Tuesday’s rally.\n\nKey Points\n\nKamala Harris picks Tim Walz as her vice president ahead of Philadelphia rally\n\nWalz says it is ’honor of a lifetime’ to join Kamala Harris for 2024 campaign\n\nTim Walz lands a zinger on Vance about that couch story - and attacks him for using Hillbilly Elegy to trash his own community\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Tim Walz unveiled as Harris’ VP pick\n\nNew poll says most Americans haven’t heard of Tim Walz\n\nHarris praises Walz as ‘patriot’ and ‘fighter for the middle class'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 21:48 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nWatch LIVE: Kamala Harris rallies with new VP running mate Tim Walz in Philadelphia\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 21:50 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nHow do Walz and Vance stack up in the polls?\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:00 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz has been chosen to run alongside Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and while current polling shows that most Americans aren’t familiar with him past polling shows he is popular with voters.\n\nUnlike Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, Walz has decades of political experience, having first been elected to represent Minnesota’s 1st district in the House of Representatives in 2006 with 52 percent of the vote.\n\nDespite his experience, an ABC News and Ipsos survey from July found that out of 1,200 Americans, most did not know who Walz was.\n\nAriana Baio looks at the numbers.\n\nTim Walz’s approval rating compared to JD Vance\n\nHarris and Emhoff set to arrive any minute\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:13 , Josh Marcus\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff are expected to arrive in Philly any moment.\n\nEarlier today, they shared this photo of their journey to this high-profile rally.\n\nOn the ground at Harris campaign in Philadelphia\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:15 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nAndrew Feinberg reports from Philadelphia:\n\nThe crowd at the Temple University-owned arena appeared quite racially diverse and varied in age, a notable difference from the older, whiter crowds that frequent rallies for Harris’s opponent.\n\nThe Independent spotted a pair of grey-haired caucasian males sporting shirts declaring themselves to be “Old White Men for Harris and Freedom.”\n\nOne of them, Bernie Strain, said he and his friend Joe Mathis were in attendance “to support the Democratic ticket, supporting the party, and supporting our next president, Kamala Harris.”\n\nAsked about the significance of their shirts, Strain replied: “It’s as clear as the t shirt says. It’s about two old white men liking our Social Security, liking our Medicare, liking our freedom, liking our democracy — we’ll lose it if Trump gets elected.”\n\nHe also told The Independent that his son, a US Marine, had served a pair of tours at the base that was struck by Iran-backed militants in Iraq yesterday.\n\n“He’s no loser and he’s no sucker for serving in the United States’s service, and Trump’s not going to call my son a loser or a sucker. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever,” he said.\n\nStrain added that he “feels” Biden, citing the death of the president’s eldest son, Beau Biden, following a tour of duty in Iraq.\n\n“Joe’s my guy, but we got to win this. He did the best thing he could do. He saved us for four years, and it’s time for a new torch to be passed to a new generation,” he said.\n\nThe debut outing for the 2024 Democratic ticket even attracted a pair of ex-Republican members of Congress.\n\nOne of them, James Greenwood, represented Pennsylvania’s Eighth Congressional District from 1993 to 2005.\n\nHe told The Independent that he understood Biden had to stand down after his debate performance against Trump.\n\n“You’re never going to unsee it, that’s always going to be in the commercials. It’s always going to be on the internet,” he said.\n\nGreenwood, who is involved in the Republicans for Harris coalition affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign, said it was hard to recruit anyone to the pro-Harris GOP effort after the debate, but he described the vibe after Biden stood down as “like an electric charge.”\n\n“You’ve seen it. You know, the excitement, the volunteers, the fundraising, so everyone’s pretty excited,” he said.\n\nGreenwood also told The Independent he’d been “all in” for Harris to select Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, but he also had kind words for the Minnesota governor.\n\n“From what I’ve seen of Governor Walz is that he’s a very down to earth guy, very likable guy, and I think they’ll make a great team,” he said.\n\nAnother former Republican Congressman, Tea Party firebrand turned outspoken Never Trump commentator Joe Walsh, said Walz is just what Democrats need to appeal to working-class voters and shake off the party’s image as a collection of effete elites.\n\n“He’s like an everyman — the Democrats have had trouble with blue collar regular workers and that’s right up Walz’s alley,” he said. “This guy can go into any pool hall, any VFW, and he’s down more than Shapiro is. I disagree with him on a lot of policy, but he’s like a regular guy, and that’s what Democrats have to have.”\n\nWATCH: Harris campaign releases video introducing Walz as running mate\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:22 , Josh Marcus\n\nHow’s the Harris campaign going to introduce Tim Walz to the nation?\n\nToday, we got our first peek.\n\nHere’s a mini bio the campaign released talking about the Minnesota governor’s long career in public service.\n\nShapiro praises ‘battle-tested' Harris at Philadelphia rally\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:32 , Josh Marcus\n\nPennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro is speaking at today’s rally, and he walked out to a huge roar of applause.\n\n“I want you to know I am going to continue to pour my heart and soul into serving you every single day and I’m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America,” the Democrat told the crowd.\n\nHe praised Harris as “courtroom tough” and “battle-tested and ready to go.”\n\nThe Trump years, meanwhile, were marked with “more chaos” and “less freedom,” as well as declining abortion rights, Shapiro said.\n\nMention of JD Vance prompts chants of ‘He’s a weirdo'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:37 , Josh Marcus\n\nAt the mere mention of JD Vance just now, the crowd just erupted into chants of, “He’s a weirdo.”\n\nThat’s more than likely because of Tim Walz, who memorably branded the Trump-Vance campaign “weirdos” in a series of widely seen TV appearances and speeches.\n\nLearn more about the roots of this campaign dig.\n\nHow Tim Walz became beloved by young voters with a message that the GOP is 'weird'\n\nShapiro offers ringing endorsement of Harris-Walz campaign\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:46 , Josh Marcus\n\nJosh Shapiro may’ve just been passed over for being Kamala Harris’s running mate, but he certainly doesn’t sound like it.\n\nThe Pennsylvania governor is in the middle of a pumped-up speech touting the campaign as one defending “real freedom.” He also called Tim Walz a “great patriot” and personal friend.\n\nShapiro argued on Tuesday that the Democrats are the right choice for their positions on reproductive freedom, investments in public education, environmentalism, LBGTQ+ issues and other topics.\n\n“This election is about all of you, and whether or not you’re willing to do this hard work to fight for our freedom,” he said.\n\nTeacher, coach and family man: Tim Walz is the Midwest dad courting the White House\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:47 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe governorship of Minnesota may have launched Tim Waltz onto the national stage – and now into a battle for the White House – but it was the former teacher’s wife who brought him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes in the first place.\n\nGwen Walz, nee Whipple, was born and raised in Minnesota before making a fateful foray after college into teaching across the border in Nebraska; there, she met another young educator and member of the Army National Guard. Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife’s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town – followed by a stop at Hardee’s, naturally – soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota — while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nSheila Flynn has more on the Midwest roots of Walz.\n\nPhotos capture first Harris-Walz rally\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:48 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz were in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first campaign rally together.\n\nHere’s what the scene looked like on the ground.\n\nHarris VP pick Tim Walz under microscope for response to 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:58 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe announcement of Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate has shaken up the 2024 presidential race once again, and it’s also turning the clock back to 2020 when the country was riven by protests following the police murder of George Floyd.\n\nWalz was governor when police in his state pinned Floyd to the ground by his neck for more than nine minutes, sparking massive, sometimes violent, protests and looting across the Minneapolis area and the country.\n\nRepublicans, predictably, have already seized on this moment in Walz’s history, painting him as another soft-on-crime liberal who lost control of their city.\n\n“They make an interesting tag team, because of course, Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020,” JD Vance, Walz’s rival on the GOP ticket, told Fox News on Tuesday.\n\nSo, how did Tim Walz respond to Floyd’s death?\n\nHarris VP pick Tim Walz under microscope for response to 2020 George Floyd protests\n\nThe VP has landed\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 22:59 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris and Tim Walz have taken the stage.\n\nFollow live for the latest news on this pivotal moment in the campaign.\n\nHarris thanks Shapiro and claims him as key ally in campaign for Pennsylvania\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:04 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris just gave a special shoutout to Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.\n\n“I will say Josh is a dear, dear friend and an extraordinary leader,” she said. “He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, look, I am so so invested in our friendship, in doing this together, because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania.”\n\nHarris praises Walz as ‘patriot’ and ‘fighter for the middle class'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:12 , Josh Marcus\n\nAfter talking about her campaign priorities—defending reproductive rights, ensuring middle class prosperity—Harris is now laying out Walz’s qualifications to be vice president.\n\n“I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future,” Harris told the audience in Philadelphia. “A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class. A patriot, who believes as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America.”\n\nBig cheers for Walz record on ACA and free school lunch\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:22 , Josh Marcus\n\nSome of the biggest cheers of the night so far have come when Kamala Harris described Tim Walz’s record on social service programs, which included supporting the Affordable Care Act and making school breakfast and lunch free for Minnesota kids.\n\n“We believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it,” Harris said.\n\nHow Tim Walz’s 1995 DUI arrest changed his life\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:32 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz chose to stop drinking alcohol in 1995 after he was arrested for driving under the influence, a story that has resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Minnesota Governor as her running mate.\n\nOn September 23, 1995, Walz, a 31-year-old, newlywed, high school teacher and football coach, was pulled over doing 96 miles per hour in a 55mph zone. The officer who stopped Walz smelled a “strong odor of alcoholic beverage”, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota’s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio has the details.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz’s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\n‘Thank you for bringing back the joy'\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:42 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is making that case that he and Kamala Harris will be happy warriors on behalf of the middle class and common decency.\n\n“Thank you for bringing back the joy,” Walz began, praising Harris for her uplifting style.\n\nThe Minnesota governor also connected his small town upbringing working on a family farm to the values he said he’ll bring to the White House.\n\n“My mom and dad taught us, show generosity toward your neighbors, and work for the common good,” he said.\n\nWalz said this approach couldn’t be more different than Trump’s.\n\n“He froze in the face of the covid crisis,” Walz said. “He drove our economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump — that’s not even counting the crimes he committed.”\n\nWalz gets personal talking about reproductive care\n\nTuesday 6 August 2024 23:48 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is arguing that the Republican position on abortion rights and other forms of reproductive care go against Minnesota’s golden rule: “Mind your own damn business.”\n\nThe Minnesota governor said there was a time when Republicans believed in freedom, but that has turned out to mean the “freedom to invade your doctor’s office.”\n\nThe Democratic leader also spoke personally about his family’s efforts to conceive a child through IVF, and the long stretches where it seemed the procedure wouldn’t take.\n\nEventually, when their daughter was born, they named her Hope.\n\nWalz savages JD Vance as out of touch and ‘weird as hell'\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:00 , Josh Marcus\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine why Tim Walz once won a state football championship when he was a high school coach.\n\nThe Minnesota governor practically gave a halftime pump-up speech today in Philadelphia, and he reserved his most passionate section for his rivals on the (political) field, savaging Ohio senator and Trump running mate JD Vance as an out-of-touch elite, despite their shared Midwest roots.\n\n“Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a best seller trashing that community,” Walz said, to hoots from the crowd.\n\n“Come on, that’s not what Middle America is,” he continued. “And I got to tell you. I can’t wait to debate the guy ... That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.”\n\nThe Democrat also accused Vance and Trump of being “weird as hell.”\n\nRead more here to learn about why Vance is increasingly coming under fire from even those within his party.\n\n‘Racist’ Mountain Dew, cat ladies — and eyeliner? The ‘weird’ times of JD Vance\n\nWalz accuses Trump campaign of lying about Project 2025\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:15 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is the latest to accuse the Trump campaign of falsely downplaying its links to Project 2025, a model administration document from a conservative thinktank that’s been criticized for its suite of far-right policies.\n\nTrump has claimed he isn’t associated with the proposal, despite JD Vance writing a foreword for a book by the project’s creator.\n\n“Don’t believe him when he plays dumb,” Walz said in Philadelphia. “He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms, to rig the economy to help the super rich. If Trump gets a chance to return, he’s going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago, only this time it’ll be much, much worse.”\n\nVIDEO: Walz claims GOP is breaking the Minnesota ‘golden rule’ on abortion\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:30 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz is hoping to connect his Midwest values to the 2024 campaign.\n\nOn the subject of abortion, Walz said the GOP opposition to abortion goes against Minnesota’s “golden rule,” of “mind your own damn business.”\n\nBest pics from Harris-Walz rally\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:33 , Graeme Massie\n\nTim Walz lands a zinger on Vance about that couch story - and attacks him for using Hillbilly Elegy to trash his own community\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:37 , Graeme Massie\n\nTim Walz attacks Vance about that couch story at first rally as Harris’ running mate\n\nBest pics of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at Philadelphia rally\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:41 , Graeme Massie\n\nWATCH: Tim Walz’s best reactions to Kamala Harris’s speech\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:52 , Graeme Massie\n\nDoug Emhoff and Gwen Walz show off new campaign sign\n\nWednesday 7 August 2024 00:55 , Graeme Massie\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago. Here’s why\n\n01:00 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his “weird” attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: “Walz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee”.\n\nAlmost a year later, after Biden’s debacle of a debate performance, just as Walz and other Democratic governors did a stakeout in front of the White House, I suggested him as a potential running mate for Harris if Biden dropped out. “Veteran, longtime congressman from rural Minnesota. Popular governor who has passed major pieces of progressive legislation,” is how I summarized my reasons why.\n\nMore from Eric Garcia.\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago. Here’s why\n\nICYMI: Democrats react to Tim Walz as VP pick: ‘I don’t know’\n\n01:15 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris has selected Minnesota governor Tim Walz to be her running mate for the 2024 General Election.\n\nIt’s the choice the current vice president mulled over for weeks, before landing on Walz, who beat Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Arizona’s Mark Kelly to be Harris’s top pick.\n\nThe pair are due to step out for their first joint rally this evening in Philadelphia in front of thousands of fellow Democrats.\n\nThe Independent spoke to a few of them and asked them what they thought of Harris’s choice.\n\nDemocrats react to Tim Walz as VP pick: ‘I don’t know’\n\nTrump campaign suspends North Carolina events amid Tropical Storm Debby\n\n01:16 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe Trump campaign has had to postpone two scheduled events for August 8 in North Carolina, as Tropical Storm Debby bears down on the state.\n\nThe Trump-Vance ticket had been scheduled to appear at events in Raleigh and Oakboro on Thursday.\n\nHere’s more on the widespread damage from the storm.\n\nLive updates: Tropical Storm Debby hits South Carolina with over foot of rain\n\nHarris campaign denies ‘ridiculous’ claim it rejected Shapiro as VP pick over faith\n\n01:31 , Josh Marcus\n\nKamala Harris’ campaign has rejected the suggestion that Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro was overlooked as her running mate because of his Jewish faith.\n\nRepresentatives said that the claims were “ridiculous and offensive” and that the vice president would “always combat antisemitism whenever and wherever she sees it.”\n\nHarris announced that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz would be joining the Democratic ticket on Tuesday. Shapiro, who is Jewish, was among several others tipped to be in the running.\n\nSome critics suggested that Shapiro had been sidelined because of his faith. Former Harvard law professor and controversial lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, wrote on X:”Did Harris reject Shapiro because progressives don’t like that he’s Jewish?”\n\nMike Bedigan has the details.\n\nHarris campaign denies claim Shapiro was rejected for VP because of Jewish faith\n\nThe biggest moments from tonight’s Harris-Walz kickoff rally\n\n01:40 , Josh Marcus\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made their debut as the presumptive Democratic presidential ticket, kicking off a campaign against Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of a roaring crowd in Philadelphia.\n\nThe North Star State executive strode on stage in front of an electricfied crowd at Temple University’s Licouras Center on Tuesday just hours after Harris announced him as her running mate, ending the closely watched contest for the next potential vice president by choosing the seasoned midwestern politician, military veteran and former school teacher with a progressive track record.\n\nHarris told the estimated 12,000 people in attendance that she’d “set out to find a partner who can build this brighter future” that she has spoke of from the stump during her weeks-old campaign for the presidency.\n\nShe added that her search for a running-mate led her to look for a “leader who can unite this nation and move us forward,” someone who was “a fighter for the middle class” and a patriot who believes as I do the extraordinary promise of America, a promise of freedom, opportunity and justice not just for some but for all.”\n\nAndrew Feinberg and Alex Woodward have the latest.\n\nTim Walz fires up Democrats in first speech as Kamala Harris’s running mate\n\nPhotos: Tim Walz’s unlikely rise to be the Democratic VP nominee\n\n01:47 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe other VP race: who will play Tim Walz on SNL?\n\n01:55 , Josh Marcus\n\nNow that both campaigns in the 2024 presidential election have settled on their candidates, for now at least, the next question is: who will play them on Saturday Night Live?\n\nMany on X have suggested that SNL vets Maya Rudolph and Steve Martin should handle the Democratic side.\n\nPakistani national with ties to Iran indicted for alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump\n\n02:00 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThe Department of Justice has accused a Pakistani national with ties to the Iranian government with seeking to carry out a murder-for-hire plot targeting US government officials.\n\nAsif Raza Merchant, who is now in federal custody, allegedly traveled to the US to hire hit men to carry out assassinations in August or September, according to an indictment unsealed in New York on Tuesday.\n\nAlex Woodward has the details.\n\nPakistani national indicted for alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump\n\nOpening of Trump campaign office in Georgia descends into chaos\n\n02:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nA fight broke out at the opening of a Trump campaign office in Valdosta, Georgia, police have said.\n\nThe incident took place last week when State Representative John LaHood said he was approached by activist Sam Carnline after speaking at the event, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nGustaf Kilander has the story.\n\nOpening of Trump campaign office in Georgia descends into chaos with fist fight\n\nIs Trump having a ‘public nervous breakdown’? Republicans worry he might be...\n\n03:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nRepublicans are concerned that their party leader Donald Trump is having a “public nervous breakdown” after he made a series of offensive outbursts about Vice President Kamala Harris as he slips behind her in the polls.\n\nPerhaps collapsing under the weight of Harris’ growing campaign support, the former president has made a number of insulting personal attacks against his Democratic rival. Last week, Trump questioned the vice president’s racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists conference. Over the weekend, he accused Harris of having a “low IQ.”\n\nMeanwhile, new polls indicate Trump is slipping behind the vice president in the popular vote and races are tightening in battleground states.\n\nKelly Rissman reports.\n\nRepublicans worry Trump is having a ‘public nervous breakdown’\n\nHow Walz might help – or hurt – Harris’ chances\n\n04:15 , Namita Singh\n\nOpting for the Minnesota governor immediately calms the Democratic Party’s left wing, which was worried that another contender, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, might have pushed the party closer to Israel and disheartened Arab American and younger voters.\n\nSome in Kamala Harris’ inner circle saw Mr Walz as a do-no-harm choice who can keep the party unified heading into the Democratic National Convention opening in Chicago on 19 August.\n\nProgressives are already celebrating Mr Walz’s ability to deliver an unapologetically populist message in the style of a Midwestern dad who recalls the social studies teacher and football coach he once was.\n\nActivists who for months have followed Joe Biden around the country to protest his full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza are hopeful that Mr Walz will help Harris take a more nuanced approach than someone like Shapiro.\n\nBut some critics will point to 2016, when the only other woman to be nominated for president, Hillary Clinton, picked a mild-mannered dad with centrist views and a modest national profile: Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. That ticket lost to Donald Trump.\n\nCori Bush becomes second Squad member to lose her primary\n\n04:23 , Namita Singh\n\nDemocratic representative Cori Bush became the second member of the Squad to lose her primary as county prosecutor Wesley Bell beat her in a grueling and expensive primary on Tuesday evening.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent massive amounts of money to depose Bush in the district where she pulled off an upset victory against a longtime incumbent Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe United Democracy Project, a super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent $9.2m against Bush, according to AdImpact. That made the primary the second-most expensive one of the year after UDP spent millions in opposition to fellow Squad member Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York.\n\nReport:\n\nCori Bush becomes the second Squad member to lose a primary as she’s ousted from seat\n\nCori Bush becomes second Squad member to lose her primary\n\n04:34 , Namita Singh\n\nDemocratic representative Cori Bush became the second member of the Squad to lose her primary as county prosecutor Wesley Bell beat her in a grueling and expensive primary on Tuesday evening.\n\nPro-Israel groups spent massive amounts of money to depose Bush in the district where she pulled off an upset victory against a longtime incumbent Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe United Democracy Project, a super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent $9.2m against Bush, according to AdImpact.

Governor Peggy Flanagan would ascend to the governor’s office, if Harris-Walz defeats Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance in 2024.\n\nFlanagan — a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe — would also become the state’s first-ever female governor.\n\nAlex Woodward has the details.\n\nHarris-Walz could clear path for first-ever Native American woman governor\n\nVance offers battleground counterprogram to Walz\n\n04:49 , Namita Singh\n\nJD Vance is set to follow an overlapping itinerary to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz over the next two days, including stops in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nHis role is to attack the Biden administration’s policies and tear down Ms Harris’ record on the economy, public safety and immigration.\n\nMr Vance got out ahead of the Democrats in Philadelphia on Tuesday, holding an event hours before Ms Harris was to formally introduce her new running mate at a rally.\n\nHe said during his Philadelphia stop that “I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,” but not until after the Democratic convention.Ms Harris’ team seemed to be happy to have Vance making the contrast with the Democrats.\n\n“We appreciate JD Vance providing voters in battleground states exactly the split-screen that defines the choice this November,” said Ms Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak.\n\nMichigan will choose between Democrat Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers\n\n05:18 , Namita Singh\n\nFormer US representative Mike Rogers has secured the Republican nomination for a US Senate seat in Michigan and will face Democratic representative Elissa Slotkin in the November election.\n\nMs Slotkin and Mr Rogers, long considered the front-runners for their respective party nominations, will now shift focus to the general election. Ms Slotkin enters with a massive fundraising advantage and emerges nearly unscathed from a sparse primary, while Mr Rogers has the backing of national Republican groups and former President Donald Trump.\n\nMs Slotkin defeated actor Hill Harper in the Democratic primary, while Republicans chose Mr Rogers over former US representative Justin Amash and physician Sherry O’Donnell. Both candidates will now compete for a seat left open by longtime Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow’s retirement.\n\nThe retiring incumbent joined Ms Slotkin onstage at an event in Detroit shortly after the race was called to endorse her. Ms Slotkin praised Stabenow for her years of service before delivering a speech positioning herself as the “normal” and “rational” candidate.\n\nNorth of Detroit, in Oakland County, Mr Rogers thanked supporters at a watch party for “not giving up on politics.” Like Ms Slotkin, Mr Rogers represented a mid-Michigan swing district in Congress, and he similarly positioned himself as the commonsense candidate in his speech. No Republican has won a US Senate race in Michigan since 1994.\n\nWith Democrats holding a razor-thin majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House, competitive races like those in Michigan are drawing lots of attention.\n\nIt’s a vibes election – and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\n05:19 , Namita Singh\n\nThey’re calling it a vibes election.\n\nVibes are notoriously hard to spot, and they don’t always show up in polls, but as Kamala Harris took to the stage in a cavernous auditorium at Temple University in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her new running mate, they were measurable in the screams and shouts of 12,000 people.\n\nThe replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket by Ms Harris has changed the energy in the room. And Ms Harris’s choice of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate is a sign that she is banking on that energy taking her to the White House.\n\nMy colleague Richard Hall reports:\n\nIt’s a vibes election - and Harris has picked the perfect running mate for the job\n\nWesley Bell defeats 'Squad' member Cori Bush\n\n05:43 , Namita Singh\n\nSt Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell has defeated US representative Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party’s incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nMs Bush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the “Squad,” was seeking a third term in Missouri’s 1st Congressional District, which includes St Louis city and part of St Louis County. Mr Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the US House.\n\nWesley Bell\n\nMs Bush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she’ll no longer be in Congress.\n\n“At the end of the day, whether I’m a congresswoman or not, I’m still taking care of my people,” Ms Bush said.\n\nWhat to know about Tim Walz’s origin story\n\n05:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nThe governorship of Minnesota may have launched Tim Waltz onto the national stage – and now into a battle for the White House – but it was the former teacher’s wife who brought him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes in the first place.\n\nGwen Walz, nee Whipple, was born and raised in Minnesota before making a fateful foray after college into teaching across the border in Nebraska; there, she met another young educator and member of the Army National Guard. Tim Walz had grown up in West Point, a small Cornhusker enclave nearly 300 miles south of his future wife’s hometown, and already counted several years of military service under his belt when he decided to ask Gwen out.\n\nThanks to encouragement from her sister, she agreed; their first date at the only movie theater in town – followed by a stop at Hardee’s, naturally – soon blossomed into a romance, then a 1994 marriage. Exactly 30 years later, the two teachers and their two children now proudly hold the title of First Family of Minnesota — while throwing their hats in the ring for Second Family of America.\n\nFamily – both the one who raised him and the one he’s built with Gwen – has deeply molded Walz’s professional path and political positions.\n\nSheila Flynn has the full story.\n\nTeacher, coach and family man: Tim Walz is the Midwest dad courting the White House\n\nRepublican activist becomes first person to be convicted in Arizona’s fake elector case\n\n05:49 , Namita Singh\n\nA Republican activist who signed a document falsely claiming Donald Trump had won Arizona in 2020 became the first person to be convicted in the state’s fake elector case.\n\nLoraine Pellegrino, a past president of the group Ahwatukee Republican Women, has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of filing a false document, Arizona Attorney General’s Office spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday, declining to comment further.\n\nRecords documenting her guilty plea haven’t yet been posted by the court. Still, court records show Pellegrino was sentenced to unsupervised probation. Before the plea, she faced nine felony charges.\n\nSeventeen other people had been charged in the case, including 10 other Republicans who had signed a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried Arizona in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. Joshua Kolsrud, an attorney representing Pellegrino, said in a statement that his client has accepted responsibility for her actions. “Loraine Pellegrino’s decision to accept a plea to a lesser charge reflects her desire to move forward and put this matter behind her,” Kolsrud said.\n\nWashington state attorney general and Green River Killer detective advance in race for governorship\n\n06:30 , Namita Singh\n\nWashington state’s longtime attorney general and a former sheriff known for his work hunting down the Green River Killer advanced on Tuesday to November’s general election in the battle to become the next governor in a Democratic stronghold that hasn’t had an open race for the state’s top job in more than a decade.\n\nIn high profile congressional races, meanwhile, Democratic US representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez advanced in the 3rd District and will face Donald Trump-endorsed Joe Kent, whom she defeated two years ago. And in the 8th District, Democratic US representative Kim Schrier will go head-to-head against Republican Carmen Goers, a commercial banker.\n\nA congressional race in the 4th District between US representative Dan Newhouse, one of the last remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and two conservative rivals endorsed by the GOP presidential nominee was too early to call.\n\nUnder the state’s primary system, the top two vote-getters in each of the contests advance to the November election, regardless of party. Because Washington is a vote-by-mail state, with ballots due to be postmarked by Election Day, it often takes days to learn final results in close races.\n\nMike Kehoe wins Republican nomination for governorship\n\n06:42 , Namita Singh\n\nMissouri voters have nominated Lt Governor Mike Kehoe to be the Republican candidate for governor, making the governor’s race his to lose.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters in Jefferson City, Mr Kehoe described himself as an “underdog” and said people doubted his campaign from the start.“We proved, once again, the American dream is still alive,” Mr Kehoe said.\n\nMr Kehoe edged out Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Sen. Bill Eigel to win the GOP nomination, a huge advantage in a strongly conservative state currently without any Democratic statewide officials.\n\nMr Kehoe will face off in November against state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, who won the Democratic nomination.Republican governor Mike Parson is barred from seeking reelection by term limits.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Tim Walz unveiled as Harris’ VP pick\n\n06:45 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDonald Trump is leading the Republican party’s meltdown over Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, dramatically claiming that Tim Walz will “unleash HELL ON EARTH.”\n\nHarris announced on Tuesday that she had chosen Walz – the man who coined the now-infamous “weird” moniker for their Republican rivals – to join her on the Democratic ticket to take on Trump and JD Vance in the November election.\n\nThe announcement soon provoked an unhinged reaction from the former president whose campaign fired off a fundraising email warning that “Tim Walz would be the worst VP in history!”\n\nJoe Sommerlad has the story.\n\nTrump leads Republican meltdown as Walz unveiled as Harris’ VP pick: ‘HELL ON EARTH’\n\nKansas' former attorney general wins the Republican nomination for an open congressional seat\n\n06:48 , Namita Singh\n\nA former Kansas attorney general and failed candidate for governor has found at least initial success in his political comeback attempt, winning Tuesday’s Republican primary for an open US House seat.\n\nFormer Kansas attorney general Derek Schmidt prevailed in the primary in the 2nd District of eastern Kansas over Jeff Kahrs, a former top regional federal health official, and Shawn Tiffany, a rancher. Even though Kahrs worked in former president Donald Trump’s administration, Mr Schmidt won Trump’s endorsement.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, former US representative Nancy Boyda, who held the 2nd District seat in 2007 and 2008, defeated Matt Kleinmann, a public health advocate who was a member of the 2008 national champion University of Kansas men’s basketball team.\n\nMs Boyda won the nomination even though she riled up some party activists by positioning herself toward the political center for what she saw as a more viable general election campaign in the Republican-leaning district. She lost her 2008 race for reelection.\n\nMs Boyda was the last Democrat to represent eastern Kansas in Congress, and the district became redder after the GOP-controlled Legislature redrew it two years ago.\n\nMr Schmidt, who is also a former state senator, raised the most money of any candidate, more than $616,000, including more than $119,000 since mid-July alone, according to campaign finance reports.“America needs more effective, conservative voices in public service,” Mr Schmidt said in a statement.\n\n“I will continue to prioritize securing our border, stopping inflation, and rolling back big government’s overregulation and over-taxation of our daily lives.”\n\nWas Tim Walz arrested for a DUI?\n\n07:45 , Josh Marcus\n\nTim Walz chose to stop drinking alcohol in 1995 after he was arrested for driving under the influence, a story that has resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris announced the Minnesota Governor as her running mate.\n\nOn September 23, 1995, Walz, a 31-year-old, newlywed, high school teacher and football coach, was pulled over doing 96 miles per hour in a 55mph zone. The officer who stopped Walz smelled a “strong odor of alcoholic beverage”, according to the police report.\n\nAfter failing a field sobriety test and preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to a local jail in Dawes County, Nebraska.\n\nThe incident took place 11 years before Walz first pursued political office as Minnesota’s First Congressional District Representative.\n\nAriana Baio reports.\n\nThe truth behind Tim Walz’s 1995 DUI arrest and how it changed his life\n\nI predicted a Harris-Walz ticket a year ago. Here’s why\n\n08:45 , Eric Garcia\n\nEric Garcia writes:\n\nThe wait is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally picked her running mate in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz has become a favorite of online progressives recently, largely because of his “weird” attacks on Republicans. But there are also solid policy reasons why Walz is beloved of the left wing of the party. He went from a pro-gun rural Democrat in Congress to a governor who has signed legislation that protects abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, enacted background checks on guns, and expanded free school meals regardless of income.\n\nBack in August 2023, I tweeted: “Walz would be a strong choice for Harris if she were to be the nominee”.\n\nContinue reading..."
