        "text": "A musical theatre performer from East Sussex says a \"thriving\" amateur dramatics scene is helping improve accessibility in the industry.\n\nEastbourne's Sonny Monaghan was given a role in the first UK tour of musical Dear Evan Hansen following an open call for applicants on TikTok.\n\nHe says he is from a working-class family and that the industry is \"not all that accessible for people with similar backgrounds\".\n\nMr Monaghan credits social media and \"a thriving am-dram community\" in Eastbourne, Bexhill, and the surrounding towns for helping people who are not \"going to auditions in London\" or \"getting seen by all the casting agents\".\n\nAlex Adams, the owner of the Royal Hippodrome Theatre in Eastbourne and co-producer at The Rattonians amateur dramatic company, says the town has a \"particularly strong am-dram core running through it\" which is ‘\"unusual\" compared to other areas.\n\nHe says it gives young people \"a real exposure\" to professional theatre and the \"adrenaline of being on a professional stage\".\n\nMr Monaghan, who was cast to play the title role as an alternate, explained that there was \"quite a lot of privilege\" that came with being in musical theatre.\n\nThe actor, who has an agent and has had professional roles, studied musical theatre at college in Lewes rather than at a drama school - which he said would have been \"financially taxing\""
