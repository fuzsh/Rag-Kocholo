        "text": "Hi there.\n\nWe don't know you. But we wanna know you.\n\nOr maybe we do know you, but we don't know you well.\n\nOr MAYBE we do know you well, but you still have some surprises up your sleeve.\n\nWe'd like to fix that.\n\nMany factors go into choosing a season at Mad Horse Theatre Company, including seeking stories that resonate with the community around us. And who better to bring our real community to life on stage than the many dynamic people who make it? There are available roles in all of our selected titles this season, both on and off stage, and now is a great time to get to know each other better while we start the next steps of flushing out the production teams.\n\nWe're inviting you to spend three minutes in a room with the members of the resident ensemble. We want to know who you are.\n\nYou can call it an audition if you'd like.\n\nBring your contrasting monologues. Or don't.\n\nBring a headshot and a resume. Or don't.\n\nBring a design portfolio. Or don’t.\n\nBring a harmonica, a unicycle, your dog -- we're not going to judge, and we're not going to tell you what to do. What you do with your three minutes is up to you. Just remember: we're looking for you to give us a glimpse of what it would be like to work with you - as an artist and as a human.\n\nInterested but unavailable to join us in person? Submit a video, same rules (or non-rules) apply.\n\nLook -- this could be super weird. And if you feel awkward or nervous about it, know that we do, too. But we know we'll be inspired by seeing new faces, hearing new voices, and considering new perspectives -- all of which will be instrumental in helping Mad Horse create the productions that excite, inspire, challenge, and stick with us. This could be the start of something beautiful.\n\nBut for any of that to happen, we’d like to get to know you first.\n\nMad Horse Theatre is committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of our organization. We encourage people of all races, gender-identities, ethnicities, religions, orientations, creeds, neuro-diversities, and physical abilities to attend these auditions."
