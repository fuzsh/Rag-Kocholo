        "text": "Activities for Any Age in St. Louis\n\nThe St. Louis region is rich ways to stay active, at home and out on the town. Whether you’re up for a walking tour or would prefer a comfy seat taking in live entertainment, St. Louis has you covered! Read on to discover popular activities for seniors in the St. Louis area and beyond, from more leisurely options to active and everything in between.\n\nLeisure Activities\n\nLow intensity activities are things that require some movement but you’re still able to be conversational – such as walking.\n\nThese low intensity activities will add pleasure to your leisure!\n\nSee a Broadway Show at the Fabulous Fox Theatre\n\nThe best of Broadway, right here! Sit back, relax, and enjoy a production at The Fabulous Fox Theatre in the Grand Center Arts District. The Fox Theatre features a restored 1929 grandeur with designs in a style known as “Siamese Byzantine.” With flanking columns, the 90-foot lobby is reminiscent of the rock-cut Buddhist monastery halls, and the terrazzo lobby floor is covered with a crimson and gold chenille carpet imported from Czechoslovakia. The entire ambiance harkens back to the golden age of entertainment and is an experience unto itself. The Fox wants all guests to be comfortable and provides such accommodations as wheelchair seating, accessible parking, sight- and hearing-impaired seating, assisted listening devices, and sign language interpreted performances.\n\nVisit the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis\n\nJust minutes from popular and active spots like the Gateway Arch and Forest Park, the Cathedral Basilica offers a quite respite. Here you can learn about the Cathedral Basilica’s rich history, inspiring architecture, and transcendent art. Consecrated in 1926, the Cathedral Basilica boasts beautiful mosaics depicting the life of Saint Louis. Pope John Paul II also visited the cathedral in 1999 after he designated it as a Cathedral Basilica in 1997. You can participate in one of the daily masses, take a guided tour, and just reflect on the historic beauty. Visitors are encouraged to call ahead to ensure tours are available.\n\nEnjoy Music from the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra\n\nThe nation’s second-oldest orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra traces its roots to 1880 and performs in one of the world’s finest concert halls, the 2,683-seat Powell Hall. Whether you prefer Rachmaninoff or the Rolling Stones, there are performances for all kinds of music lovers.\n\nUncover Your Artistic Side\n\nCreative arts are an effective way to express yourself and communicate. Museums and art institutions like COCA and Craft Alliance provide opportunities. The Saint Louis Art Museum also offers light walking – and stools available upon request. There you can view a stunning collection of art from all over the world. Want to bring the arts to you as a leisure activity? Try your hand at a new craft or art form like residents at Richmond Terrace, an LSS Assisted Living community in Richmond Heights, Missouri, have done.\n\nModerate Activities\n\nMaybe you’d like to get up and move, but not too fast or too vigorously?\n\nSt. Louis offers an almost endless array of places to explore that require only moderate activity.\n\nExplore the Missouri Botanical Gardens\n\nSurround yourself with nature at one of the oldest botanical institutions in the United States, the Missouri Botanical Garden. With 79 acres of beautiful horticulture, a 14-acre Japanese Garden, water features, an 1850s home, and one of the world’s largest collections of endangered orchids, you can explore for hours. The Gardens are fully accessible, offering free wheelchair rentals and several family restrooms.\n\nCheer on the Cardinals at Busch Stadium\n\nSt. Louis is a baseball city! Put on something red and get ready to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” while you root for the St. Louis Cardinals. The excitement of a live sporting event can be a mood elevator. Even when a game isn’t scheduled, the stadium offers tours and special events for baseball lovers. Residents of Meramec Bluffs, a Lutheran Senior Services (LSS) Life Plan Community in Ballwin, Mo, cheered on the Cardinals vs. the Cincinnati Reds on Military Appreciation Night recently.\n\nHaunted History Lunch and Tour of the Lemp Mansion\n\nThe Lemp family history is interwoven in St. Louis lore, with the Lemp Mansion at the center of it all. Making the most of the tragic past, the mansion now offers tours and dining. You can even take part in a séance as part of the ghost tour. Note that it is a historic building and may not be fully accessible for all.\n\nHigher-Level Activity\n\nIf you enjoy vigorous activity levels that may make you break a sweat, you’ve got plenty of options in St. Louis.\n\nWe’re Going to the Zoo!\n\nThe Saint Louis Zoo, is recognized as a leading zoo in animal management, research, conservation, and education. It’s also free to visit! With a wide array of animals to see, as well as historic architecture, you can easily spend a fun day here.\n\nGet New Perspectives at the Arch Grounds and Riverfront\n\nThe Gateway Arch is a symbol of St. Louis. But there’s so much more to it than a shiny monument! Take a tram ride 630 feet up to the top to see St. Louis from a perspective usually enjoyed by birds and planes. Celebrate America’s pioneering spirit at the innovative and interactive museum. Take a Riverboat cruise on the mighty Mississippi River and see St. Louis from the water. Visit the restored Old Courthouse and stand in the footsteps of American heroes like Dred and Harriet Scott who sued for their freedom and Virginia Minor who fought for women’s right to vote.\n\nAct Like a Kid Again at the St. Louis Science Center\n\nWe can all feel like kids at the St. Louis Science Center thanks to the interactive exhibits like farming displays featuring live chickens, fun scientific experiment demonstrations, and even a “crime lab.” With multiple levels you can stay active for hours. Or slow down and check out an OMNIMAX film.\n\nThe Hill: Historic Italian Neighborhood\n\nResidents of Meramec Bluffs, an LSS Life Plan Community in Ballwin, Mo, love to visit the historic Italian St. Louis neighborhood known locally as “The Hill.” Kay Zotta, Recreation Center Coordinator, grew up in the neighborhood and loves to show it off to the residents. “They absolutely love this one. It makes my heart happy,” said Zotta.\n\nTeam Sports\n\nTeam sports aren’t just for little leaguers. There are many sports groups that are designed for older adults. Water volleyball has made a huge splash at many LSS communities, with several teams taking medals at the St. Louis Senior Olympics. “It’s not all about winning. It’s fun; it’s good to get to know people and talk with them. There’s a lot of camaraderie amongst the players,” said Charlie Hoffman, a water volleyball player at Meridian Village, located in Glen Carbon, Illinois.\n\nThere’s an Activity for Anyone to Enjoy in St. Louis\n\nWhether you are looking for something to make you sweat or just want a leisurely outing, St. Louis has it! There is an activity for anyone and everyone to enjoy. Spring is just 40 days away so start making your plans now to get active!"
