        "text": "Jack Black Gave An Update On Tenacious D's Future After Kyle Gass's Controversial Remark During The 2024 Spicy Meatball Tour\n\n\"Everybody needs a break sometime.\"\n\nSo, Tenacious D isn't over just yet.\n\nJack Black discussed the band's future with Variety at a premiere of his new film Borderlands, which also stars Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Ariana Greenblatt, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nTenacious D, a comedy rock band featuring Jack and Kyle Gass, has performed since 1994. Their popularity grew after their 2001 debut album, Tenacious D, and the support of other bands like Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.\n\nOn July 14, the absurdly comedic rock music came to a halt in the middle of their Spicy Meatball Tour when Kyle made a controversial comment about the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\nIn a viral video, Jack was seen singing happy birthday to Kyle on stage, and when he asked him to make a wish, Kyle said, \"Don't miss Trump next time,\" referring to 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks who shot at the 45th president at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn an Instagram statement, Jack said he was \"blindsided\" by Kyle's comment and ending the Tenacious D tour. \"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,\" he said.\n\nKyle apologized for the remark on a now-deleted Instagram and emphasized it wasn't rehearsed. \"The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous, and a terrible mistake,\" he said.\n\nTenacious D fans were heartbroken and divided over the decision to end the tour, but Jack's latest comments are a sign of hope for the rock group's return.\n\n\"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime. And we'll be back,\" Jack told Variety.\n\nAs for the fans concerned about what this pause meant for Kyle and Jack's relationship, there's hope on that front as well. \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed,\" Jack said of his bandmate, Kyle. \"These things take time sometimesâ€¦ And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nAnd that's that. The metal lives on!\n\nShare This Article"
