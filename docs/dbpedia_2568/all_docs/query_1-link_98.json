        "text": "Former President Donald Trump took a major step toward the Republican nomination Tuesday night, dominating in states across the country and expanding his delegate lead. He could clinch the nomination as early as next Tuesday.\n\nSo how does clinching March 12 (or earlier if Nikki Haley drops out between now and then) stack up to past nominees?\n\nThe earliest any candidate has been the presumptive nominee was Feb. 18, 2004, when Democrat Howard Dean dropped out and John Kerry remained. Trump could formally clinch the nomination by passing the requisite number of delegates as early as next Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhen candidates became presumptive nominees (from earliest to latest):\n\nFeb. 18: 2004, Kerry, (Dean drops out), March 10, formally clinches\n\nMarch 5: 2008, McCain, formally clinches, (Ron Paul drops out June 13)\n\nMarch 9: 2000, Al Gore, (Bill Bradley drops out), March 15, formally clinches\n\nMarch 9: 2000, George W.

Going into their primaries were 11 Democrats and seven Republicans, all vying for a seat that could tip the balance of power in the U.S. House this fall.\n\nAfter the legal fight, the state of Alabama was required to use the new district map, which gives Black voters a better chance at electing a candidate of their choice. The 2nd District now has a Black voting-age population of nearly 50% and gives Democrats a better chance of picking up another seat in Alabama.\n\nAn Alabama Supreme Court decision that gives frozen embryos the same legal standing as children has further upended the landscape of reproductive rights in America.\n\nThe ruling has effectively halted most in vitro fertilization care in the state as lawmakers scramble to address fallout from the order.\n\nEmerson Woodhall of Mobile said after voting \"it's definitely a huge problem that these decisions are being made by people who are very out of touch\" with the realities of IVF.\n\nElizabeth Goldman, the first Alabama woman to receive a uterine transplant who has shared her IVF journey on social media, visited the Alabama statehouse last week to give lawmakers a human face to a debate about abstract legislation.\n\n\"They have the power to make the decisions that impact my future,\" she said. \"And the hard part is I've worked so incredibly hard and been through some unimaginable things to get to where I'm at, but here it is: The decision lies in their hands.\"\n\nBoth chambers of the Alabama Legislature proposed bills that answer some of the questions posed by the state Supreme Court ruling, and a final version could get approved this week.\n\nThe race that could will be one of the most closely watched, and likely expensive, governor’s races this year.\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson and Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein both won their primaries easily. Robinson has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump and has a similarly brash approach, which plays well with Republican voters. The Democrat, Stein, used his acceptance speech to say his opponent is too extreme for the state.\n\n“Instead of waging job-killing culture wars, let’s grow the economy,” said Stein in a throwback to an argument that helped propel the current Democratic Governor Roy Cooper to office in 2016. The state’s so-called “bathroom bill” back then kicked up controversy and cost the state business. Cooper ran on repealing it and won.\n\nThe results in November could determine the direction that North Carolina goes on everything from abortion access to funding public schools. The Biden campaign hopes it could also help the president win a state that has gone Republican at the top of the ticket every election since 2008, when President Obama won by the narrowest of margins.\n\nToday's Alabama congressional primaries are being run on new district lines after the U.S. Supreme Court found the old map discriminated against Black voters.\n\nThe Republican-led redistricting process in 2021 led to only one of seven districts having a majority-Black population, despite Alabama's population being more than 25% Black.\n\nOllie Davison of Prichard, Ala., said the change is huge for Black residents being able to have their voices heard.\n\n\"Finally, we have an opportunity to elect the candidate of our choice and somebody that's from our community that understands the issues that we go through every day,\" he said.\n\nThe new 2nd Congressional District spans most of South Alabama, from Mobile to Montgomery. Nearly half the residents of this district are Black, and the district is likely to be represented by a Democrat after the November election.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican primaries appear likely to head to a runoff, with no candidate earning more than 50% of the vote.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made a statement on Super Tuesday, writing in a campaign email that tonight's results leave Americans with a \"clear choice.\"\n\n\"Are we going to keep moving forward or will we allow Donald Trump to drag us backwards into the chaos, division, and darkness that defined his term in office?\" asked Biden.\n\nBiden said that he ran in 2020 because of the \"existential threat\" he felt Trump posed to the country, adding that the \"enormous progress\" the U.S. has made since Trump left office is all at risk were the former president to return to the White House.\n\nWhile offering criticism of his predecessor, Biden ended his statement with a message of unity:\n\n“Every generation of Americans will face a moment when it has to defend democracy,\" said Biden.\n\n\"Every Democrat, Republican, and independent who believes in a free and fair America: This is our moment. This is our fight. Together, we will win.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's wins on Tuesday night come as he continues to face legal troubles this election season.\n\nLater this month, Trump's first criminal case is expected to begin trial in a Manhattan courtroom. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York — specifically regarding 11 payments made to former Trump Organization vice president and counsel Michael Cohen during the 2016 election that were described by the Trump Organization falsely as \"legal retainers.\" The payments were found to be reimbursements to Cohen for paying off a former adult film actor who was threatening to go public with charges that she had an affair with Trump. He has denied the affair.\n\nThe criminal charges were a historic first to come down on a former president.\n\nAlthough Trump has pleaded not guilty, the fact of the payments and the false records isn't in dispute. What the district attorney, who brought forth the charges, has to prove is that Trump made them to further other crimes like violating campaign finance law and mischaracterizing the payments for tax purposes.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks, so Trump may not be able to be on the campaign trail as often as he would like as the general election kicks into full steam.\n\nAll told, he is facing a combination of 91 state and federal charges, including several related to his role to stay in office after he lost the 2020 election to Biden. But the charges have done little to dent Trump's popularity among his base. Instead, he often uses the charges to bolster his credentials ahead of a potential rematch with Biden.\n\nThere's been a lot of focus on the races that have been called. But there are also interesting things to see in the races that haven't been. The Associated Press has yet to make a race call in the Republican primary in Vermont, where the race remains incredibly close.\n\nThere are also races still outstanding: Polls will close in California and Utah at 11 p.m. ET. California is known for being a slower state to count its votes and we may not have results quickly, especially in races that are expected to be close, like the U.S. Senate primary. Utah is a state where everyone receives a mail-in-ballot which can delay reporting of results as well.\n\nThere are two other races outstanding: the Alaska Republican caucus which will wrap up at 12 a.m. ET on Wednesday, and the Democratic primary in American Samoa.\n\nIn 2024, a significant number of local election officials are overseeing voting in a presidential election for the first time.\n\nThat makes primary elections, like the many concluding today, even more critical as voting officials use the lower-turnout affairs to figure out problem areas they need to address before the crush of voters they expect to see in November.\n\nA report last year found that in some battleground states, more than half of the local election administrators are new since 2020.\n\n\"The biggest challenge right now facing new election officials is just not having that experience of having run a presidential election,\" Kim Wyman, a former secretary of state of Washington, said at the time. \"It sounds really simple, but it takes months of planning to get there. And without that experience of knowing what to expect and really what to be looking for puts them a little bit at a disadvantage.”\n\nA recent report by the nonprofit news outlet Votebeat found a correlation between turnover in local voting officials and election administration errors in Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd in some cases, officials are dealing with rule changes too and trying to get a sense of how voters will adjust to them.\n\nIn North Carolina, for instance, election officials have been working to get the word out to voters that they need to show voter ID for the first time in a presidential election.\n\nAt a press conference this morning, Karen Brinson Bell, the state’s lead voting official, was optimistic the law hadn’t tripped up many voters before Election Day. Out of close to 700,000 early and mail voters, Bell said just over 200 had to cast provisional ballots due to issues with their IDs.\n\nFor many young Democrats, thinking about another Biden-Trump rematch is underwhelming.\n\n\"I wish we had some new faces! Something else!\" 21-year-old Arianna Dwomoh joked. \"Just anyone else, please!\"\n\nDwomoh, who is from Raleigh, voted for President Biden in 2020. Though she plans to support him again, she's not excited about the decision.\n\nOn the Republican side, though former President Donald Trump leads among all Republicans regardless of age, supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley see her as an ideal alternative.\n\n\"At this point, I feel like it's just a broken record. And I'm kind of frankly tired of hearing about it,\" said Hannah Brown, 24, from Winston-Salem.\n\n\"[I'm] just trying to look at politics in a positive light. And I know, Nikki, unlike Trump and unlike Biden, she's not tied to big politics, which is really refreshing,\" she added.\n\nDespite Brown's support, Trump is overwhelmingly expected to dominate across primaries.\n\nYoung voters could have electoral power this year.\n\nIn recent major elections, Gen Z and millennial voters largely voted for Democratic candidates.\n\nThis year, Americans under 43 are expected to make up nearly half of the electorate. People under 30 had a comparatively high turnout in 2020 and in recent off-year elections.\n\nListen to this story on All Things Considered here.\n\nSocial media users experienced login issues to the Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp this Super Tuesday. Down Detector, which tracks user reports of access, logged over 600,000 disruptions to Facebook just after 10:30 a.m ET.\n\nThough access has largely been restored, the outages are significant in an era when half of U.S. adults are at least sometimes getting their news from social media, according to research published last November by Pew.\n\nFacebook, by far, is the platform that the majority of American adults are turning to for their news. Nearly one-third turn to the site for information, followed by YouTube and then Instagram.\n\nThe platform has previously come under fire for serving as a breeding ground for political conspiracy theories, including the belief that the 2016 election was stolen from former president Donald Trump.\n\nWith access limited on the biggest primary day of the year, many observers have been left wondering what caused the outage. While Meta has acknowledged the disruption in service, the company has yet to offer an explanation beyond a \"technical issue.\"\n\nAs WFAE's Elvis Menayese reports:\n\nForty-two percent of Black registered voters in North Carolina cast a ballot in the 2022 midterm elections, according to an analysis by Democracy North Carolina. That was the lowest turnout of Black voters since 2010, two years after Barack Obama’s campaign spent heavily on mobilizing voters in the state, the report said.\n\n“At the end of the day, we can’t simply run folks based off their race and hope that’s going to gin up turnout without going out and talking to people,” said Drew Kromer, who was elected chair of Mecklenburg County’s Democratic Party last year. “You can’t just run a Black candidate and not go talk to Black voters. You have to talk to people. You have to be in the community. You have to be listening.”\n\nBut race and age are two factors about a candidate that do matter, according to Jocelyn Nolley, chair of the Black Political Caucus of Charlotte-Mecklenburg.\n\nKeep reading on WFAE.org\n\nAbout $305 million has been spent for the Republican nomination, according to data provided to NPR by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nGroups supporting Nikki Haley have spent the most: $96.6 million (SFA Fund Inc. $64.4 million, Haley campaign $17.9 million, Americans for Prosperity Action $13.5 million, Independents Moving the Needle $843,000).\n\nTrump allies are second at $60.9 million (MAGA Inc. $40.2 million, Trump campaign $17.4 million, Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee $3.3 million).\n\nHaley has been able to stay in the race because she’s had a considerable amount of money from Republicans who don’t want to see Trump as president. But donors, like the Koch-backed AFP Action, are starting to pull back.\n\nLoading...\n\nMost of the money spent in this campaign has been on the first two states, Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as on national broadcast and cable – $4 out of every $5.\n\nLoading...\n\nLawmakers in multiple states are working to limit the presence of firearms at polling stations ahead of the presidential election in November.\n\nOn Monday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed Senate Bill 5, which among other measures, \"prohibits carrying firearms within 100 feet of polling places and ballot receptacles,\" according to her office.\n\nLawmakers in Vermont, which is holding its primary today, are considering a similar proposal.\n\nVermont state Rep. Angela Arsenault introduced a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to possess a gun at polling stations in future elections, according to Vermont Public.\n\nLawmakers in Pennsylvania and Michigan are considering similar proposals, according to WESA and WKAR.\n\nAs of September, only 12 states and Washington, D.C., had banned both open and concealed carry of firearms at polling places, according to the Brennan Center for Justice think tank. Several other states allow either open carry or concealed carry but not both.\n\nA Brennan Center survey last year found that 45% of local election officials fear for the safety of their colleagues and that many officials have left the field due to increased threats of violence, harassment and other kinds of abuse.\n\nIndependent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced Tuesday that she will not seek reelection in November.\n\nIn a video posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, Sinema cited the \"anger and division\" of politics today as one reason for her departure after a single term in the Senate. She highlighted bipartisan efforts she has undertaken to improve infrastructure, boost manufacturing and create jobs, but said in today's Senate, bipartisan efforts are \"considered failures,\" and \"compromise is a dirty word.\"\n\n\"I believe in my approach, but it's not what America wants right now,\" Sinema said. \"I love Arizona, and I am so proud of what we've delivered. Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year.\"\n\nArizona's not a Super Tuesday state, but Sinema's announcement has big implications for control of the Senate, since her seat is a key battleground race. The state's voters head the polls for their primary on July 30.\n\nRecent polling showed Sinema in third place in the race behind Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake.\n\nCLAYTON, N.C. — It was a pretty standard Super Tuesday scene outside a polling place in a strip mall. That is, until Monty Bynum pulled up wearing a sequined bomber jacket and dark glasses.\n\nThe 23-year-old R&B artist planted a black and gold yard sign among the more traditional red, white and blue candidate signs.\n\nIt read: “King of NC.” It’s the name of the song Bynum hopes will give him his big break, and he blasted it from a speaker next to his car.\n\nPointing to the candidate yard signs, he explained he was inspired to use the same tactic to get the word out about his music.\n\nAs volunteers handed out flyers outside the polling place, Bynum passed out cards with a QR code to hear his album.\n\n“You can’t be mad at a local musician trying to get listens on his album. I just put so much money into this thing,” Bynum said, before ducking in to cast his own ballot. “For something as polarizing as politics, it’s like, come on — you need something lighthearted to help you guys out.”\n\nActivists in Minnesota hope to send President Biden a protest message similar to the one made at the polls in Michigan last week over the war in Gaza.\n\nIt’s one of several campaigns across the country urging Democratic primary voters to pressure Biden to push for a permanent cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe grassroots group Uncommitted Minnesota is encouraging voters to check the option \"uncommitted\" on their Democratic primary ballots on Super Tuesday.\n\n\"We're just hoping our neighbors come out in hopes that we can see a cease-fire, in hopes we can save lives,\" Uncommitted Minnesota's Jaylani Hussein said Friday after speaking to hundreds of Somali Americans at the Karmel Masjid, a mosque in Minneapolis.\n\nIn addition to speaking at several mosques across the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, the group has been doing national phone-banking and other get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nAbout 13% of voters in Michigan's Democratic primary voted uncommitted last week, far surpassing the group Listen to Michigan's stated goal of getting 10,000 votes. Organizers in Minnesota have not indicated exactly what would constitute a victory for their campaign. They say they hope to get more than the number of people who voted uncommitted in 2020, which was 2,612, according to the Minnesota secretary of state's office.\n\nListen to the full story here.\n\nSuper Tuesday is also a big test for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the Democrat challenging President Biden for their party's nomination.\n\nPhillips tweeted in November that \"if my campaign is not viable after March 5th, I'll wrap it up and endorse the likely nominee — Biden or otherwise.\"\n\nPhillips has not won a primary contest, or delegate, so far. He placed fourth in the Michigan Democratic primary with 2.7% of the vote, behind Biden with 81.2% of the vote, \"uncommitted\" (13.2%) and Marianne Williamson (3%).\n\nThe New York Times reports Phillips voted for himself today at a church in his home state of Minnesota, which he is likely to lose. Phillips himself acknowledged his dim prospects in a tweet earlier this morning, hinting at more to come in the days ahead.\n\n\"As the only candidate not losing to Donald Trump in any poll, I'm grateful for the beautifully orchestrated outpouring of wishes to end my mission to ensure his defeat,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"I'm touched by the thoughtfulness, and will be making decisions over the coming days about how we can best fulfill that objective.\"\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas — Here in Fort Worth, voters — especially Republicans — say immigration and the country’s southern border are among the most important issues driving them to the polls for the state’s primaries.\n\nMark Dobbins, who cast a ballot Friday — the last day of early voting — said he voted for Donald Trump in the GOP primary, partly because of his tougher positions on U.S. immigration policy.\n\n“I think one of the biggest issues that we're facing right now is the illegal immigration crisis,” he said. “The border is effectively open.”\n\nElaine Garrison, who also voted for Trump, says immigration and illegal border crossings have been an issue in Texas for a very long time. But she says she feels like things are out of control.\n\n“I've lived in Texas my whole life and it's always been an issue,” she said. “It's just beyond more so. It's catastrophic.”\n\nJames Henson, a pollster with the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin, says it’s “astounding” how much immigration continues to influence GOP politics at this point.\n\n“The only thing even remotely competitive is the economy,” Henson said. “But as we've seen for the last several cycles, immigration and border security stand very tall and just dominate Republican positions and Republican attitudes.”\n\nThe issue is not just being closely watched by Republicans, though. Henson says more Democrats and independent voters say it's front of mind. He cites recent polling that found a plurality of Texas Democrats support making it harder for migrants to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\n“It's a sign that public opinion is shifting to some degree among Democrats,\" Henson said. \"We don't know how permanent that shift will be, though.”\n\nRoni Harris, who voted for President Biden in the Democratic primary, says immigration is also an important issue for him. And he likes how Biden is handling it.\n\n“He seems to be wanting to compromise and work with other parties on that issue, too,” Harris said. “So, you know, I like that stance.”\n\nSuper Tuesday involves 16 states and one U.S. territory: American Samoa, a 301-mile-long volcanic island chain halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand.\n\nThe territory is composed of seven land masses (five volcanic islands and two coral atolls) and home to more than 43,000 people. It's one of five U.S. territories whose permanent inhabitants are considered U.S. citizens.\n\nThat means those who live there pay some federal taxes but do not have meaningful representation in Congress: American Samoa elects a non-voting member in the House of Representatives but does not have representation in the Senate.\n\n\"While citizens in these territories do vote in presidential primaries, they do not have representation in the Electoral College, rendering their vote more symbolic than consequential,\" says the nonprofit organization Rock the Vote.\n\nAmerican Samoa's Democratic Party holds its caucus today, and Republicans will hold theirs on Friday. The territory has 11 delegate votes in the Democratic National Convention and nine delegates in the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn 2020, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg won American Samoa's Democratic caucus. Republicans backed former President Donald Trump in 2020 and 2016, the last contested Republican caucuses.\n\nGlobal superstar Taylor Swift is using her massive platform to encourage eligible voters to show up for Super Tuesday.\n\nThe singer, currently in Singapore for the Asia-Pacific leg of her record-breaking Eras tour, addressed her 282 million followers in an Instagram story this morning.\n\nShe urged them to vote today in her adopted state of Tennessee and the more than a dozen other states and territories holding nominating contests today.\n\n\"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power,\" she wrote. \"If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\nShe included a link directing U.S.-based fans to Vote.org, a nonpartisan, nonprofit voting registration and get-out-the-vote platform.\n\nSwift has encouraged her fans to participate in politics before — after many years of staying quiet on the topic.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, she broke her silence by endorsing two Democratic candidates up for election in Tennessee. She endorsed Biden for president in 2020 (and many Republicans — including Trump himself — appear to be worried she will do so again).\n\nLast year, Swift posted on Instagram urging people to register to vote — and helped drive a surge in voter registrations on Vote.org.\n\nAfter sweeping all but one of the Republican primaries and caucuses so far, former President Donald Trump is pretty confident that voters will turn up for him if he is the Republican presidential candidate in 2024.\n\n\"They're all going to vote for me again,\" Trump said while speaking to reporters in Londonderry, N.H., in January. \"Everybody.\"\n\nTrump is expected to win big on Super Tuesday, when 16 states make their preference for a presidential candidate known.\n\nBut experts think Haley's relatively strong showing in the Republican primaries may be an issue for the party. Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research, told NPR's Franco Ordonez that he'll be watching two counties in Virginia: Fairfax and Loudoun counties.\n\nThese are large, high-income counties — with a wide swath of college-educated voters — where McHenry sees the potential for a protest vote.\n\n\"If they are voting for Nikki Haley, I think that's a sign of potential trouble for Donald Trump,\" McHenry said.\n\nListen to the full story here.\n\nEveryone's got to eat — including the president of the United States. And lately, President Biden has been sampling it all: boba tea in Las Vegas, burgers and a milkshake in Raleigh, N.C., and ice cream with late-night host Seth Meyers in New York City.\n\nAs Biden has ramped up his travel this election year, he's been making frequent stops to grab a bite to eat or a drink. The smaller settings offer a chance for Biden to do the kind of retail politics he's known for, but the food and drink choices themselves hold significant symbolism.\n\n\"Food is identity and food is inherently political and food is cultural currency. It has the power to connect us and also the power to repulse us. So these are, obviously, very calculated choices about where to go,\" Hunter Lewis, the editor of Food & Wine, told NPR.\n\nBiden's recent stops include burgers and a milkshake from Cook Out, a Southern fast food chain that Lewis described as having a \"cult following.\" He ordered boba tea in Las Vegas' Chinatown. These stops show Biden, 81, is trying to connect with younger voters and shake off concerns about his age.\n\n\"Age is the question right now and so I think going to a Cook Out, going to a boba tea shop, those are smart moves,\" Lewis said. \"He is projecting that he connects with a younger audience and is in the know.\"\n\nBoba tea, a Taiwanese drink that's become hugely popular in the United States, also shows an outreach to Asian American voters, who make up nearly 10% of the population in Nevada, a key state for Biden to win in November.\n\n\"Food is definitely a way to humanize a candidate,\" said Emily Contois, a professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa and the author of the book Diners, Dudes and Diets.\n\nThat's important because American voters tend to be swayed by personality, rather than only focusing on issues, Contois said. And the fact that Biden is choosing establishments that serve foods from different cultures sends a message about his politics, in addition to his personality, she said.\n\nBiden's food stops also draw a contrast with Trump — and have viral potential, for better or worse. Read the full story here.\n\nIowa Democrats held their caucus when Republicans did, on Jan. 15. But they didn't cast their votes for president that day — they met to conduct party business and cast their votes by mail instead.\n\nToday, we find out the unofficial results. They will be announced at 5 p.m. local time on the Democratic Party's website and in a news release, according to Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart.\n\n\"I think that the important thing is that Iowa Democrats will know that this process was smooth, it was easy, it was accurate, it was transparent and that the results are going to be clear to everyone,\" Hart told The Des Moines Register.\n\n\"And when we get that all done, it may seem — I don't know if anti-climactic is the right word — I would just say that we will be relieved that this step of the process is done. And we're proud that we were able to do it in a way that I think is going to be beneficial to Iowa Democrats.\"\n\nIowa Democrats changed their process after their chaotic 2020 caucus, in which technical malfunctions got in the way of producing a clear winner. It was demoted from being the first in the nation in the Democratic Party's primary process as a result.\n\nState Democrats will accept any card postmarked by March 5 and will leave three more days for late cards to be returned, meaning official results will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe Register reports that 19,609 Iowans requested presidential preference cards by the Feb. 19 deadline. Hart told the paper she hopes the return rate will be high, but also described this year as practice for 2028 — when Democrats will have an open seat to fill.\n\n\"I'm very much looking forward to making some improvements as we as we get closer to 2028,\" she said. \"But the focus right now is to get this one right.\"\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Nicole Sidman walked up a long driveway in a hilly suburban neighborhood of Charlotte, campaign flyers in hand, ready to talk about an issue that prompted her to run in the Democratic primary for the state legislature this year.\n\nA chubby white Chihuahua named Frankie came running when she rang the bell. Rebekah Rubenstein opened her door.\n\n\"I know who you are!\" Rubenstein told Sidman. Rubenstein, who has three daughters, quickly told Sidman she plans to vote for her and will bring her 8-year-old daughter to the polls to be part of a moment she described as critical.\n\n\"For my children to be able to have the right — now, in the future, any time — to make the choices about their own bodies is essential,\" Rubenstein said. \"So that's 100% in the forefront of my vote.\"\n\nConcerns about new restrictions on abortion are motivating voters and candidates alike in North Carolina primary races. It's an issue that the Biden campaign hopes will energize voters not just on Super Tuesday, but also in November's presidential election.\n\nOnly one Democratic presidential candidate has won this state in modern times — former President Barack Obama, in 2008, by the narrowest of margins.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper said he believes this issue will put North Carolina in play. He isn't running this time — the state has term limits — but the race to replace him is shaping up to be a barn burner, and the Republican supermajority in the state legislature is on the line, too.\n\n\"When you add issues like reproductive freedom, when you add the biggest governor's race in the country — those things, I think, come together to make North Carolina ground zero in 2024,\" Cooper told NPR in an interview at the governor's mansion in Raleigh.\n\n\"You can care about more than one issue, but this is one where we need to make clear about the stark difference between Republicans and Democrats. Women's reproductive freedom depends on getting Democrats elected across this country and particularly in North Carolina,\" Cooper said.\n\nYou can read the full story and listen to it here.\n\nSuper Tuesday — like Leap Day — only happens every four years. And a lot has happened since the last one. So here's a refresher on some of the lingo we're likely to see today and in the days ahead.\n\nOpen: Registered voters have the option of voting in the Republican or Democratic primary regardless of party affiliation. That said, in some states, a vote may be regarded as a form of registration with the party.\n\nClosed: Only voters registered with the party holding the election can vote. As in, only registered Democrats in a state can vote in that Democratic primary.\n\nThreshold: This pertains to the percentage of the vote needed to earn delegates on a congressional or state level.\n\nProportional: Democratic delegates are proportionally allocated throughout the primary process. For Republican contests, delegates must be allocated and proportioned until March 15.\n\nWinner-take-all: After March 15, Republican contests are allowed to structure the contest as winner-take-all based on at-large delegates or a combination of at-large and congressional district delegates.\n\nCongressional district delegates: What the GOP uses to represent congressional district votes — three delegates are given to each district.\n\nDistrict-level delegates: What Democrats use to represent congressional districts' votes — the number of delegates per congressional district is determined proportionally based on the state.\n\nAt-large delegates: These delegates represent the state-wide vote — which is also proportional to the specific state population.\n\nPLEOs (party leaders and elected officials): A certain number of state political figures who are designated to serve as delegates by the state party (and are officially determined in the late spring).\n\nBiden and Trump have easily won the Democratic and Republican primaries so far, and are projected to claim their parties' nominations once again.\n\nOne of the bigger wild cards this Super Tuesday is how Republican contender Nikki Haley — former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador — will fare.\n\nHaley heads into Super Tuesday just after her first primary victory: Washington, D.C., which she won on Sunday. But that win followed blowout losses in South Carolina and Michigan.\n\nA conservative super PAC backed by the powerful Koch network stopped spending to support Haley after she lost her home state, saying it still endorses her but does not \"believe any outside group can make a material difference to widen her path to victory.\" Haley said this week that her campaign had raised $12 million in February and is continuing to raise money.\n\nHaley has pledged to remain in the race \"until the last person votes,\" telling NPR last month that she'd stay in at least through Super Tuesday.\n\n\"I haven't actually sat down and thought about what comes after that,\" she said. \"But our goal was between South Carolina and Super Tuesday, another 20 states have voted, and that's more of the representation we want, let people's voices be heard.\"\n\nWhen asked this weekend on NBC's Meet the Press whether she will drop out if she loses to Trump on Tuesday, she said she isn't looking \"too far ahead.\"\n\nHaley is losing by about 30 points in an average of national polls to Trump. And while she is a conservative, she tends to perform better among moderate and independent-leaning voters — of whom there don't appear to be enough likely to vote in Super Tuesday states for her to make a real dent.\n\nSuper Tuesday contests are mostly winner-take-all, so without winning more than half of those states, Haley will fall even further behind Trump in the delegate count.\n\nBut the longer she stays in the race, the more she could potentially hurt his prospects. As NPR's Ron Elving explains here: History shows that when the major party nominees for president have not cleared the field of notable challengers before summer, they tend to lose in the fall.\n\nThe first candidate to win 1,215 delegates will win the Republican presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump now leads former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley 273 to 43.\n\nA total of 874 votes — representing 36% of the total — are available between all states that vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe states mostly allocate their delegates in a winner-take-all approach if a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes — meaning that if one candidate sweeps most of the states, they gain a nearly insurmountable lead.\n\n\"And that was part of the intent of the creation of Super Tuesday — to establish a day that is a pseudo national primary to try and get the primary over with and have the party start to unite around one candidate,\" NPR's Domenico Montanaro explains.\n\nThe delegate process is more of a formality on the Democratic side, since President Biden is running as an incumbent. He has 206 of the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nMathematically, nobody can earn enough votes — and thereby, delegates — to officially become the presumptive nominee by the end of Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Associated Press says the soonest that could happen is March 12 for Trump and March 19 for Biden. Republicans will have awarded more than 70% of their delegates by the end of March — just as Trump's criminal trials are getting underway.\n\nIn the meantime, stay up to date with NPR's delegate tracker.\n\nThe first GOP presidential primary to have a real, front-loaded Super Tuesday with lots of states voting fairly early in the process was in 1988.\n\nSince then, every Republican candidate who has won Super Tuesday has gone on to be the nominee.\n\nTake a look at Super Tuesday results from past open presidential primaries — the eventual nominee's name is bolded, and the numbers represent the number of states won:\n\n1988: H.W Bush 16, Robertson 1\n\n1996: Dole 9-0\n\n2000: W. Bush 9, McCain 4\n\n2008: McCain 9, Romney 7, Huckabee 5\n\n2012: Romney 6, Santorum 3, Gingrich 1\n\n2016: Trump 7, Cruz 3, Rubio 1\n\nOn the Democratic side, remember that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders entered Super Tuesday as the front-runner in 2020, and Biden — riding a surge of momentum after winning South Carolina — won a majority of states to make it a two-person race.\n\nDonald Trump has done exceedingly well in this primary with core Republicans, and that gives him a huge advantage today. Only a few of the states voting today have historically had high percentages of independents who participated, according to past exit polls.\n\nOf the nine states that had exit polls conducted in 2016, just two had electorates with less than 60% who identified as Republicans – Vermont and Massachusetts. But they account for just 57 delegates of the 874 up for grabs today. Even if you give Haley California, Colorado and Maine – states that didn’t have exit polls in 2016 but have high moderate populations – it would still be far from enough, just 283 delegates.\n\nAnd even giving Haley those is a stretch. Consider: only 50% of New Hampshire primary voters this year identified as Republicans – and Haley still lost by 11 points.\n\nSo surprise, surprise, you have to win over Republicans to win the Republican nomination.\n\nLoading...\n\nToday's primaries are scattered across multiple states and time zones, so poll closing times are especially varied.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the numbers of delegates at stake and poll closure times, all in Eastern Time:\n\n7 p.m.: Vermont (17), Virginia (48)\n\n7:30 p.m.: North Carolina (74)\n\n8 p.m.: Alabama (50), Maine (20), Massachusetts (40), Oklahoma (43), Tennessee (58)\n\n8:30 p.m.: Arkansas (40)\n\n9 p.m.: Colorado (37), Minnesota (39), Texas (161)* (*First results reported at 8 p.m. ET)\n\n11 p.m. ET: California (169), Utah (40)\n\nSo when will we know the results? The Associated Press has called recent primary contests within minutes of polls closing, but it could take longer this time around.\n\nThe AP says it will declare winners on Super Tuesday \"only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.\"\n\nIt explains that in noncompetitive contests, the AP may be able to determine winners relatively quickly based on factors like the size of the lead in initial returns, the type of contest and who is eligible to participate, and the state's voting history.\n\n\"Once the polls have closed, if initial vote results received from key locations throughout the state confirm that the frontrunner or expected winner is indeed ahead by an overwhelming margin, the AP may declare a winner in that contest,\" it adds.\n\nWhile most eyes will be on the presidential race, particularly for the Republicans, voters in several states will also be making decisions on their final slate of candidates in Senate, House and governors races that can determine political control of Congress and states for the next two to four years.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nCalifornia voters will get their say on the Senate seat long held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, now occupied by Sen. Laphonza Butler. The state has a top-two primary system, meaning the top two finishers, regardless of party, will advance in what's expected to remain a solidly blue seat.\n\nNorth Carolina votes in a high-stakes gubernatorial race. The state legislature is currently controlled by Republicans, and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has reached his term limit — leaving an open seat.\n\nTexas will pick the Democratic challenger to Sen. Ted Cruz, who is seeking a third term. Nine Democratic candidates are looking to be Cruz's opponent in the fall.\n\nAlabama will be voting under a new congressional map that opened a new district in the state's southwest corner. Last fall, a federal court decided on Alabama's new congressional map, which is likely to result in a Democratic member of the U.S. House.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post said California was holding a Democratic Senate primary. It's an open primary, with all candidates on the same ballot.\n\nMore states vote and more delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday than any single day of the primary season.\n\nThis year, voters in 16 states are heading to the polls or wrapping up voting: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. (Voting in the Iowa Democrats’ mail-in caucus also ends today.)\n\nThe main event is on the Republican side — 874 delegates are at stake, more than a third of the total. States are mostly winner-take-all, meaning Donald Trump could take a sizable lead and be well on his way to recapturing the GOP nomination.\n\nToday is Nikki Haley’s last chance to claim enough delegates for the nomination. If she doesn’t win a majority of states, she will fall further behind — and no candidate has become the Republican nominee without winning Super Tuesday since it became a thing on the GOP side in 1988."
