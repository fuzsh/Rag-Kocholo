I have seen somewhere around 50 shows here and it always amazing. I think they mainly do wedding receptions and private events and I bet it's perfect for that just like it is for concerts.\n\nJON H. - CONCERT ATTENDEE\n\nWe have done our company holiday party at the Madrid Theater for the past 3 years. They are fantastic to work with and have a beautiful historic venue. We enjoyed working with Missy and they treated us fantastic.\n\nDAVID M. - BARTS ELECTRIC\n\nWe ADORE the Madrid. You can't beat the theater look, the history, the amazing stage, and the marquee out front with your names on it. It's a perfect spot for a wedding!\n\nTWICE ON SUNDAY - BAND\n\nThe Madrid Theatre was the perfect venue for our wedding. We had a guest list of 350 and wanted to accommodate in downtown Kansas City. The Madrid had enough room to have the wedding and ceremony in one location which was important to us. The venue is so beautiful - there is so much natural decor we did not have a lot of extra decorating to do.\n\nTAYLOR Y. - BRIDE"
