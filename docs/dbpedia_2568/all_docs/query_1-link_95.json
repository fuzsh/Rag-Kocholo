        "text": "More Tenacious D\n\nIn case you missed it: on Saturday (13 July), there was an assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nAs NBC News reported, Trumpâs shooter was identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed at the scene by the Secret Service.\n\nSince then, many American musicians have voiced their thoughts on the matter. John Rich and Travis Tritt claimed that the former Presidentâs political opponents were behind the shooting, while elsewhere in the world of country music, Dave Matthews Band, Cody Johnson, Carly Pearce, and more condemned the violence and harm to democracy that took place.\n\nTenacious Dâs Kyle Gass, instead, thought of telling a joke. The Tribute group are in Australia on their highly anticipated Spicy Meatball tour, starting the run with two dates at ICC Sydney Theatre.\n\nPhoto Gallery: Tenacious D @ ICC Sydney Theatre\n\nOn Sunday (14 July), Tenacious D were performing a sold-out show in Sydney on guitarist Kyle Gassâs 64th birthday. Singer Jack Black kicked off the festivities, presenting a birthday cake carried by a giant robot and leading a âHappy Birthdayâ singalong with the audience.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\nUpon Black asking Gass to make a wish, the guitarist quipped, âDonât miss Trump next time.â\n\nHis comment has been met with criticism from Trump supporters in the U.S., while others have responded by calling out the dangers of gun violence in the U.S. However, as the band were playing in Australia, Gassâs comment was met with laughs from the audience.\n\nTenacious D fans who laughed have been described as âshamefulâ and Gassâs comment as âdisgustingâ by one pundit, but the incident has been divisive across the board. Those who criticised the band have been called âsad little snowflakesâ, while the joke has been described as âsick,â âvile,â and âtwistedâ.\n\nYou can watch the video below.\n\nTenacious Dâs Spicy Meatball tour continues in Newcastle tonight, followed by gigs in Brisbane, Melbourne, and Adelaide, before they head to New Zealand for shows in Wellington and Auckland. The tour ends next Friday (26 July).\n\nAnnounced in February, the official tour news arrived just days after Frontier Touring, the tour promoters, hinted at a 2024 Tenacious D Australian tour.\n\nThe tour promoters teased a tour announcement featuring an animated meatball bounding toward a man wearing a hat. The caption, âThe greatest and best band in the world...â referencing the bandâs beloved 2006 single Tribute."
