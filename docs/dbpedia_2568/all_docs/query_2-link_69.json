When an appointment is required for an EPA Call, members of AEA can request an appointment until all time slots are taken.\n\nUnless another contact is listed in the announcement, please direct all questions to casting@virginiarep.org.\n\nVirginia Repertory Theatre is an equal opportunity employer.
