        "text": "Kary:\n\nTruth? Sanjay's a black belt curry meister. If you wanna win, you'll have to be on top of your game.\n\nPriya:\n\nBig deal, Nina's a curry Ninja. She's not scared of a bam like Sanjay. Bring it on !\n\nBobbi:\n\nYou go, girlfriend\n\nNina:\n\nLet me get this straight: Dad used the restaurant as collateral for a bet?\n\nKary:\n\nNot exactly.\n\nLisa:\n\nHe used half of it.\n\nNina:\n\nOh, that's alright then. Had me worried for a minute.\n\nNina:\n\n[to Priya] He was the one who always said 'Listen to your heart'. He should have listened to his bloody heart, than it might not have packed up on him. [sobbing] How could he? We were gonna do this - together. We were gonna win the hat-trick together! How could he go and just... die? [starts to cry]\n\nPriya:\n\n[cradles her]\n\nNina:\n\n[about her marriage with Sanyay] I mean, they had it all mapped out for me. Marry Sanjay, have lots of little Sanjay's, we'd have the 'Taj' and the 'Jewel'... huh. They saw us as this power cooking couple.\n\nLisa:\n\nSo, who are we up against?\n\nNina:\n\nOkay. 'The Bengal Tiger'.\n\nLisa:\n\nPussycat?\n\nNina:\n\nUnless it is under a new management.\n\nLisa:\n\nIt is.\n\nNina:\n\nAh... 'Bimal's Balti and Dosa House'?\n\nLisa:\n\nLast year's winners.\n\nNina:\n\nHm... and then last, but never least: 'The Jewel in the Crown'\n\nNina:\n\n[sighing]\n\n[looking around]\n\nNina:\n\nIt's in the bag?\n\nLisa:\n\nOh yeah, it's in the bag.\n\nSanjay:\n\nIt'll never happen, you know. The two of you. Not in that way.\n\nLisa:\n\nWhat way, Sanjay?\n\nSanjay:\n\nCome on, her mother will never allow it.\n\nLisa:\n\nShe won't run away again. You know why? Because this time she has someone to stay for.\n\nSanjay:\n\nI won't be too sure about that. I mean, she'd not gonna risk it. She'd lose everything. You really think she wants to lose her family again, even for love? Chances for that are piss poor.\n\nLisa:\n\n[sees a text written underneath the wallpaper: 'Nina + Lorna - True love December 1988'; chuckling] Who is Lorna?\n\nNina:\n\nI don't know, I have no idea!\n\nLisa:\n\n[mumbling] Lorna... Lorna Mullin! I remember Lorna! Captain of the school hockey team, big blue eyes, tall, legs right up to her hocksters. I'm shocked!\n\nNina:\n\n[surprised]\n\nLisa:\n\nI wouldn't have thought she was your type!\n\nNina:\n\nWha-, she WASN'T my type! I was nine! I had a crush on the world and his wife, when I was nine!\n\nBobbi:\n\n[comes in] Me too!\n\nLisa:\n\n[about the little temple] It's beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful monument to eternal love.\n\nNina:\n\nYou don't believe in love.\n\nLisa:\n\nYour dad said some king spent 22 years building it for his queen.\n\nNina:\n\nDead queen. Hah. It's a monument of grief.\n\nLisa:\n\nSame thing. If he was from Nashville, he'd have written a song about it.\n\nLisa:\n\nI really want this, me and you. I've never felt like this before! Let's tell everyone!\n\nNina:\n\nI gotta go. I can't do this just now, Lisa.\n\nLisa:\n\n[looks disappointed]\n\n[later, Nina rushes in the kitchen]\n\nLisa:\n\nI thought you'd done a runner on me.\n\nNina:\n\nNot yet. But I'm thinking about it.\n\nLisa:\n\nOf course you are. That''s what you always do.\n\nNina:\n\nGo on. I need you to know the difference for when you taste mine.\n\nLisa:\n\n[tastest the dish] Mh, it's delicious.\n\nNina:\n\nIt's terrible! They didn't marinate the meat long enough. The longer you marinate it, the more tender it becomes.\n\nBobbi:\n\n[looks like he knows EXACTLY what is going on between the two girls]\n\nNina:\n\nTaste... that.\n\n[feeds Lisa]\n\nNina:\n\nWell?\n\nLisa:\n\nThat's better.\n\nNina:\n\nWhat's better about it?\n\nLisa:\n\n[constantly grinning] I don't know.\n\nBobbi:\n\n[and now he looks as if he is totally sure]\n\nLisa:\n\n[cuts chilli, gets chilli in her right eye, screams]\n\nNina:\n\nOkay, okay, you need to wash it out with cold water immediately!\n\nLisa:\n\nARGH!\n\nNina:\n\nDon't rub it, it'll make it worse!\n\nLisa:\n\nHa, NOW she tells me?\n\nNina:\n\n[washes Lisa's eye with cold water, drys her face] Let me see... Aha, yeah, you'll live. [smirking]\n\nLisa:\n\n[chuckling] You sound like my doctor.\n\nKary:\n\n[comes in] I thought that was meant to be me? What happened?\n\nLisa:\n\nOh, erm, got some Plutonium in the eye.\n\nNina:\n\n[points at the table] Chilli.\n\nKary:\n\n[very self-confident] Cold water. You need to wash it out.\n\nNina:\n\nIs there an echo in here?\n\nRaj:\n\nNina, I hope that full plate is not a reflection on the food.\n\nNina:\n\nOh no, it's lovely, Raj. It's just... I'm not very hungry.\n\nSanjay:\n\nLovely? [... ] Come on, Nina. Be more specific than that. Tell us what you really think.\n\nNina:\n\n[tastes it]\n\nSanjay:\n\nI mean, don't rush it, mind you. Take your time. Wouldn't want you to make another snap decision. - Well?\n\nNina:\n\nTechnically it's very good.\n\nSanjay:\n\nTechnically.\n\nNina:\n\nBut there's something missing.\n\nSanjay:\n\nMissing.\n\nSuman:\n\nNina!\n\nNina:\n\nAll the ingredients are there, I can taste all the flavors. It's just... there's something... I don't know... It's the chemistry, it's not quite right.\n\nNina:\n\n[about her loving Lisa] My mum would never be able to accept it. I don't want to have to run again, Bobbie.\n\nBobbi:\n\nYou can't run for love, Nina-Bina. It just sneeks upon you... when you least expect it.\n\nSuman:\n\nIt's not the 'Taj' that Sanjay's interested in. You know that, don't you. Love isn't the be-all and end-all, Nina.\n\nNina:\n\nI don't believe that. I can't believe that.\n\nSuman:\n\nYou could have learned to love Sanjay, than you you'd never had left.\n\nNina:\n\nMum, look. You know... Dad used to tell me about your honeymoon at the Taj Mahal. And all the time that he talked about it he had this look on his face. THAT'S how I want someone to look when they talk about me. It's not Sanjay's fault, but he could never look like that.\n\n[the Bollywood movie Nina's mother watches]:\n\nIn this world you only love once. You live with this pain of love. You die with this pain of love. What is there to be afraid of when you are in love? To love does not mean you have stolen anything...\n\nKary:\n\nOh, what the hell. There's something I need to tell you, mum. I'm married. Her name's Janice and I pure love her.\n\nSuman:\n\nWell, seems I have a lot to learn about love. [hugs Sanji] My childrem seem to understand it much better than I do.... [looking at Nina and Lisa] Any more bombshells?\n\nNina:\n\n[looks afraid]\n\nLisa:\n\n[looks at Nina]\n\nPriya:\n\nCome on, we gotta go.\n\nSanjay:\n\nIt'll never happen, you know. The two of you. No, ahah.\n\nLisa:\n\nGo off, Sanji.\n\nSanjay:\n\nCome on, her mother will never allow it.\n\nLisa:\n\nShe won't run away again. You know why? Because this time she has someone to stay for.\n\nSanjay:\n\nI won't be too sure about that. I mean, she'd not gonna risk it. She'd lose anything. You really think she wants to lose her family again, even for love? Chances for that are pissed, pal.\n\nLisa:\n\n[sees a text written underneath the wallpaper: 'Nina + Lorna - True love December 1988'; chuckling] Who is Lorna?\n\nNina:\n\nI don't know, I have no idea!\n\nLisa:\n\n[mumbling] Lorna... Lorna Mullin! I remember Lorna! Captain of the school hockey team, big blue eyes, tall, legs right up to her hocksters. I'm shocked!\n\nNina:\n\n[surprised]\n\nLisa:\n\nI wouldn't have thought she was your type!\n\nNina:\n\nWha-, she WASN'T my type! I was nine! I had a crush on the warold and his wife, when I was nine!\n\nBobbi:\n\n[comes in] Me too!\n\nKary:\n\nOh, what the hell. There's something I need to tell you, mum. I'm married. Her name's Janice and I pure love her.\n\nSuman:\n\nWell, seems I have a lot to learn about love. [hugs Sanji] My children seem to understand it much better than I do.... [looking at Nina and Lisa] Any more bombshells?\n\nNina:\n\n[looks afraid]\n\nLisa:\n\n[looks at Nina]\n\nPriya:\n\nCome on, we gotta go.\n\nSuman:\n\nNina?\n\nNina:\n\n[sobbing] She's gone, Ma.\n\nSuman:\n\nThen why are you still here? Don't make the same mistake I did. I loved your dad, but I always knew, in my heart of heart of hearts, he wasn't the one.\n\nNina:\n\n...Raj?\n\nSuman:\n\nTrophies don't matter. The only thing that matters is love. [hugs Nina] Go on, hurry up. And don't you let that girl out of your sight again!\n\nLisa:\n\n[about the little temple] It's beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful monument of eternal love.\n\nNina:\n\nYou don't believe in love.\n\nLisa:\n\nYour dad said some king spent 25 years building it for his queen.\n\nNina:\n\nDead queen. Hah. It's a monument of grief.\n\nLisa:\n\nSame thing. If it comes from love it's worth written a song about it.\n\nLisa:\n\nI really want this, me and you. I've never felt like this before! Let's tell everyone!\n\nNina:\n\nI gotta go. I can't do this just now, Lisa.\n\nLisa:\n\n[looks disappointed]\n\n[later, Nina rushes in the kitchen]\n\nLisa:\n\nI thought you'd run away from me.\n\nNina:\n\nNot yet. But I'm thinking about it.\n\nLisa:\n\nOf course you are. That''s what you always do.\n\nNina:\n\n[about cooking some meat, quoting her father] Remember, every 5 minutes. Leave it any longer and the meat will dry out. And it'll taste like bloody shoeleather. Not that I've tasted shoeleather. Apart from Raj's bloody 'Chicken Shakuti' that is. Which is a crime against humanity.... And shoes.\n\nKary:\n\nOh, what the hell. There's something I need to tell you, mum. I'm married. Her name's Janice and I pure love her.\n\nSuman:\n\nWell, seems I have a lot to learn about love. [hugs Kary] My children seem to understand it much better than I do.... [looking at Nina and Lisa] Any more bombshells?\n\nNina:\n\n[looks afraid]\n\nLisa:\n\n[looks at Nina]\n\nPriya:\n\nCome on, we gotta go."
