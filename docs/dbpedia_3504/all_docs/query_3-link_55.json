        "text": "SUFFOLK\n\nOh please, my good lord, this shallow tale is only an introduction of the praise of her true value. The greatest perfections of that lovely woman, if I had the skill, could make a whole book of beautiful poetry, capable of captivating any dull imagination. What's more, she is so heavenly, so full with a choice of all delights, but she has a modest and lowly state of mind. She is happy to be at your command. And by that I mean she has virtuous, chaste intentions to love and honor Henry as her lord.\n\nSUFFOLK\n\nA dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king, That he should be so abject, base and poor, To choose for wealth and not for perfect love. Henry is able to enrich his queen And not seek a queen to make him rich: So worthless peasants bargain for their wives, As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse. Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship; Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects, Must be companion of his nuptial bed: And therefore, lords, since he affects her most, It most of all these reasons bindeth us, In our opinions she should be preferr'd. For what is wedlock forced but a hell, An age of discord and continual strife? Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss, And is a pattern of celestial peace. Whom should we match with Henry, being a king, But Margaret, that is daughter to a king? Her peerless feature, joined with her birth, Approves her fit for none but for a king: Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, More than in women commonly is seen, Will answer our hope in issue of a king; For Henry, son unto a conqueror, Is likely to beget more conquerors, If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love. Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.\n\nSUFFOLK\n\nA dowry, my lords! Don't disgrace your king so much as to think that he should be so hopeless, low, and poor to choose money over perfect love. Henry is perfectly able to give his queen money and does not need to look for one who would make him rich. Peasants who are worth nothing try to find their wives in such a way. They're like men in the market, selling oxen, sheep, or horse. But marriage should not be dealt with in negotiations between lawyers, and it's not about who we want but who his grace likes. She will be his companion in bed, after all! And therefore, lords, since he likes her the most, for that reason we should prefer her as well, and so she should be our first choice. After all, what is a forced marriage but a never ending battle? While the opposite brings joy and is a way to heavenly peace. Then, who else should be matched with Henry, who is a king, than Margaret, who is the daughter of a king? Her unique physical appearance and her birth makes her perfect only for a king. Her brave courage and fearless spirit, which isn't usually seen in women, will be an answer to our hope of giving a child to the king. Henry, a conqueror's son, is likely to breed more conquerors if he is joined in union with a lady of such courage as Margaret. Give up, then, my lords and here I finish by saying that Margaret shall be queen, and no one but her.\n\nKING HENRY VI\n\nWhether it be through force of your report, My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell; but this I am assured, I feel such sharp dissension in my breast, Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, As I am sick with working of my thoughts. Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France; Agree to any covenants, and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crown'd King Henry's faithful and anointed queen: For your expenses and sufficient charge, Among the people gather up a tenth. Be gone, I say; for, till you do return, I rest perplexed with a thousand cares. And you, good uncle, banish all offence: If you do censure me by what you were, Not what you are, I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will. And so, conduct me where, from company, I may revolve and ruminate my grief.\n\nKING HENRY VI\n\nI don't know if it's because of the power of your account of her, my noble Lord of Suffolk, or because my young days have never been touched with any passion of love's fire, I can't really tell but I am sure that I feel a sharp pain in my chest. I feel passionate alarms of both hope and fear and it makes me sick trying to figure out my thoughts. Therefore, take a ship to France, my lord, and hurry. Agree to any terms and ensure that Lady Margaret will come across the seas to England and here be crowned King Henry's faithful and blessed queen. For your expenses and spending money for the journey, collect taxes from the people. Go, and until you return I will rest here puzzled by a thousand thoughts. And you, good uncle, let go of all your hatred. If you would judge me by your own former recklessness in your youth and not your older age, I know you will forgive me for my sudden change. And so, take me where I may consider and mediate on my melancholy of love alone."
