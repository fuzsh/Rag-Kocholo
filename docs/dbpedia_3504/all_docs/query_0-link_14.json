This romantic comedy movie list can be sorted by cast, year, director, and more. This list of romantic comedy films also contains romantic comedy movie titles that can be clicked on for more information about the film. Don't forget to also check out which comedies are streaming on Netflix Instant and Amazon Prime.\n\nSome of the best romantic comedies are movies that appeal to boyfriends and girlfriends, husbands and wives, and even grandmothers and grandfathers. Though funny at their heart, there's usually a love story intertwined between the jokes and funny or even awkward situations. You'll find The Apartment and When Harry Met Sally as well as newer quintessential comedy romance movies like There's Something About Mary.\n\nThis list answers the questions \"what is a list of all romantic comedies?\" and \"which movies are funny rom coms?\"\n\nRomantic comedy movies have been directed by some pretty famous names, including Natalie Portman and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nRanked by\n\nCameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller\n\nReleased : 1998\n\nDirected by : Robert Farrelly, Peter Farrelly\n\nIn There's Something About Mary, Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) cherishes a high school crush on the radiant Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz). After a prom night debacle, years pass. Now, finding himself still smitten, Ted hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. The comedy unravels when Healy falls for Mary too, weaving a web of deceit to win her heart. A string of comedic misadventures ensues in this Farrelly Brothers' film, blending romance and hilarity in an unforgettable mix that earned Diaz a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nJim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst\n\nReleased : 2004\n\nDirected by : Michel Gondry\n\nIn the mind-bending drama Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) finds his world turned upside down when he learns his ex-girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), has undergone a medical procedure to erase him from her memory. Struck by despair, he decides to do the same. The movie then takes us on an intricate journey through Joel's mind as his memories with Clementine progressively vanish. Renowned for its unique narrative structure and surreal visuals, this film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2005. A poignant exploration of love, loss, and memory, it remains a standout in director Michel Gondry's oeuvre.\n\nWoody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts\n\nReleased : 1977\n\nDirected by : Woody Allen\n\nIn the movie Annie Hall, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic stand-up comedian attempting to comprehend the dissolution of his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film, directed by Allen himself, dissects their love story in a non-linear fashion, teasing out its complex layers. It's a comedy-drama that won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

Trapped in Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day festivities, Phil's initial disdain turns to desperation as he tries to break free from this endless cycle. Directed by Harold Ramis, the film cleverly explores themes of self-improvement and redemption. Co-starring Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson, Phil's producer and eventual love interest, Groundhog Day deftly blends humor with a thought-provoking narrative. This film is a staple of American cinema and a testament to Bill Murray's comedic prowess.\n\nTony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Marilyn Monroe\n\nReleased : 1959\n\nDirected by : Billy Wilder\n\nIn the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) find themselves on the run from Chicago mobsters.

Amidst their high-stakes charade, Joe falls for the sultry Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), while a wealthy admirer relentlessly pursues Jerry, further complicating their predicament. This 1959 Billy Wilder-directed film, celebrated for its impeccable comedic timing and witty script, won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design.\n\nOwen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Christopher Walken\n\nReleased : 2005\n\nDirected by : David Dobkin\n\nJeremy (Vince Vaughn) and John (Owen Wilson) are divorce mediators who spend their free time crashing wedding receptions. For the irrepressible duo, there are few better ways to drink for free and bed vulnerable women. So when Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken) announces the wedding of his daughter, the pair make it their mission to crash the high-profile event. But their game hits a bump in the road when John locks eyes with bridesmaid Claire (Rachel McAdams)."
