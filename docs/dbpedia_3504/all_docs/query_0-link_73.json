If so, where?\n\nI have a fine arts and communications/media background. I also took screenwriting courses, and count artists and filmmakers as close friends. I went to school in Southern California and New York City.\n\nPlease describe your film in 1-2 short sentences.\n\nBRO CRUSH is a visual poem dedicated to FTMs everywhere.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nIt was commissioned by German producer Kiki Petersen for the New York version of his \"Fucking Different\" series.\n\nWhat was the most satisfying aspect in making your film?\n\nCreating visual representation of transgender folks that wasn't tragic or heroic, necessarily. Disseminating images of FTMs that go beyond the mainstream representation of our community as primarily white and middle-class.\n\nWho or what are some of the creative influences that have had the biggest impact on you?\n\nTodd Haynes, Claire Denis, Lynne Ramsay's Morvern Callar. Guillermo Del Toro combines fantasy, horror, and political commentary brilliantly.\n\nAre you working on a new film yet? If so, give us a brief description. If not, is there a genre or subject you are interested in exploring in your next project?\n\nI'm dying to make a werewolf coming-of-age movie, with zombies a very close second.\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nThe Howling by Joe Dante\n\nMorvern Callar by Lynne Ramsay\n\nTrouble Every Day or Beau Travail by Claire Denis\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nTodd Haynes' Poison\n\nThe most recent film I saw in a theatre was:\n\n28 Weeks Later\n\nThe last DVD I watched was:\n\n28 Days Later\n\nCasper Andreas\n\nFILM TITLE: Mormor's Visit\n\nDIRECTOR: Casper Andreas\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nMy name is Casper Andreas. I grew up in Sweden and moved to NYC to study acting. I'm still an actor but lately I have focused mostly on writing and directing. I'm based in New York.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nAs an actor you are always looking for someone to hire you. I always felt so needy when I was just pursuing acting and I hated that feeling. I started writing screenplays and that led to a desire to direct because I could see the scenes play in my head when I wrote, and I felt that I have to direct this!\n\nI have directed three short films and two feature films. I'm shooting my third feature film this summer. I love filmmaking because it's the ultimate creative job!\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nNo. I learned a lot from working with directors as an actor and spending a lot of time on film sets. I actually worked a lot as a stand -in which is an great job to just observe everything that the director is doing, from working with the actors to setting up shots. I took film producing seminars at IFP West when I lived in LA and I read a lot of books. Then I just dived in.\n\nAre you working on a new film yet? If so, give us a brief description. If not, is there a genre or subject you are interested in exploring in your next project?\n\nYes I'm getting ready to start pre-production of my next feature. It's a gay drama titled BETWEEN LOVE & GOODBYE. We are shooting it in September on location in NYC. I just set up an website for the film where I will update the news blog with the latest info on the development of the film. www.lovegoodbye.com\n\nThe first LGBT film I ever saw was:\n\nI think that would be The Crying Game or Heavenly Creatures\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nThat's way too hard to answer. But 3 favorites are A STREETCAR NAMNED DESIRE, THE HOURS, and THE END OF THE AFFAIR\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nThe Talented Mr Ripley.\n\nThe last DVD I watched was:\n\nLittle Children. It's a great film and I actually got a small part in it. I'm playing a cop.\n\nTony Wei\n\nFILM TITLE: Best Men\n\nDIRECTOR: Tony Wei\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nTony Wei: I was born in Taiwan and spent half my childhood playing in the street markets of Taipei and the other half roaming the strip malls of New Jersey. I currently live in NYC.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nAs a kid, I wanted to be a doctor. I studied Neuroscience in college but realized the dogged pursuit of childhood dreams was a foolish endeavor. How can anyone know at the age of six what they should be as an adult? So I became a filmmaker – my fallback plan.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nBesides studying Neuroscience at Brown University, I also majored in Art-Semiotics, which is half film theory and half film production. Now I'm getting my MFA in Film at Columbia University.\n\nPlease describe your film.\n\nMoments before the wedding, the best man gets one last chance to recapture mutual feelings between him and the groom. As they say, \"All the best men are gay…\" but some just need a good reminder.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nThe writer, Jesse Whitnall, is the originator of the idea. A friendship had been the emotional reference, and we placed it in a wedding to further enhance the narrative arc. But the feeling of missing out on true love is a universal heartache that every individual has experienced.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced in making your film?\n\nAn eight-hour shoot on a ten-degree winter's evening. All taking place on a windy NYC rooftop of a twenty-story building.\n\nAre you working on a new film yet? If so, give us a brief description.\n\nAs Director: 1) The Wayward Winds, envisioned as a '50s melodrama, is about transgenders in a time when homosexuality was a crime, 2) Three Wheels, Inc is about the unlikely partnership that forms between a Chinese rickshaw driver and an American tourist. As Screenwriter: Made in Taiwan, a feature about a Taiwanese boy who dreams of becoming a ballroom dancer.\n\nThe first film I have memories of watching as a child was:\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nBrokeback Mountain, because I'm still irritated and baffled as to why it didn't win best motion pic of the year at the Oscars.\n\nDavid Kagan\n\nFILM TITLE: The Process\n\nDIRECTOR: David B Kagan\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nMy name is David Kagan, and I'm a prop and still life stylist, as well as soon-to-be part time MFA student. I live and play in New York City.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nI went to NYU, Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nPlease describe your film.\n\nThe Process is an experimental fairy tale about what one lonely man does to find himself a companion. It's a combination of animation and live action.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced in making your film?\n\nI had $10,000 of film equipment stolen from a van, as well as a mag with a whole day's worth of footage. That kind of sucked.\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:..\n\nTales of the City. It came out on PBS when I was in high school and it kind of ushered me into gay-dom.\n\nThe most recent film I saw in a theatre was:\n\nThe Lives of Others. AMAZING.\n\nNEWDRAFT - EARLY SUBMISSION DEADLINE APPROACHING\n\nWe are pleased to announce that NewDraft: NewFest's Screenplay Competition & Reading Series (formerly in now accepting submissions.

The Story of Queer Cinema (2006) comes...\n\nIndie Sex by award-winning filmmakers Lisa Ades and Lesli Klainberg explores how films have provided a forum to discover society’s deepest and darkest sexual fantasies played out on the big screen. Divided into three parts – Indie Sex: Censored, Indie Sex: Teens and Indie Sex: Extremes – the series delves into sex in movies through innovative verite footage, provocative film clips and compelling on-camera interviews with some of the industry’s leading actors, writers and directors.\n\nFor information on pre-ordering the film through Amazon.com, click here.\n\nIN THEATERS: A WALK INTO THE SEA\n\nA Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol FactoryDirected by Esther Robinson\n\nA Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and The Warhol Factory is director Esther Robinson's personal inquiry into the truth behind her Uncle Danny Williams' mysterious 1966 disappearance. Virtually unknown today, Danny was Andy Warhol's lover, and a promising young filmmaker.\n\nThe discovery of 20 never-before-seen films William's made during his time at the Factory-- and whose many subjects include Andy Warhol, Edie Sedgwick, Paul Morrissey, Brigid Berlin, Billy Name and what may be the earliest known footage of the Velvet Underground— reveals a luminous talent and a stark gap in the historical record. Combined with Robinson's intimate interviews of surviving Factory members, the film gets beyond the icons and quietly dismantles the Warhol myth-making machine, allowing a deeper examination of the human fragility on which Andy Warhol's empire was built.\n\nA Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory opened at the Cinema Village on Friday, December 14th.\n\nFor more information, visit the IMDb page here or its official site.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nGot a question for NewFest?

How many films have you made?\n\nI am drawn to filmmaking as a way to express myself creatively while potentially having a social impact on the outside world. I have made half a dozen short films and music videos, and am currently in pre-production on my first feature.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nI studied film theory in undergrad at Brown University and film production in grad school at NYU.\n\nPlease describe your film in 1-2 short sentences.\n\nTeam Queen is a gender-bending, fire-breathing, tassel-twirling music video for queer-post-punk rockers Triple Creme starring the best of New York burlesque.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nI have always wondered what the high school prom would be like if the cheerleaders were drag queens, the punks breathed fire, and Murray Hill was the school principal.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced in making your film?\n\nPreventing a catfight between Scarlet Sinclair and Scotty the Blue Bunny.\n\nThe first LGBT film I ever saw was:\n\nMy Own Private Idaho\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nMasculin Feminin, A Real Young Girl, Wild Tigers I Have Known\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nHigh Art\n\nLaura Terruso\n\nFILM TITLE: Lesbians: The Music Video\n\nDIRECTOR: Laura Terruso\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nMy name is Laura Terruso and I am a writer, filmmaker and performer based in New York City. I also work as the program coordinator of NYU's Center for Media, Culture and History and the Center for Religion and Media.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nFor me, filmmaking is about self-expression and activism. It allows you to reach so many people and this is something I find very exciting. I work in comedy and what I love about the genre is that it empowers the filmmaker to take something painful or upsetting and turn it into something interesting, creative and hopefully hilarious. I've made three films thus far-- all comedies. I first wrote and produced the short \"His Name is Cosmo.\" Since then I've directed a music video for a song called \"Lesbians\" written and performed by Clay Drinko. And most recently, I wrote, performed and directed a short called \"Castrato Di Matteo's Audition Tape.\"\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nI went to school for journalism at NYU and studied documentary. I wrote \"His Name is Cosmo\" while working as a news writer for a local TV station in Long Island. I made the film with two very talented NYU film school grads: Nicole Opper, the director and Jacob Okada, the cinematographer. I learned so much about narrative filmmaking from being on the set with them. Making the film provided a huge creative outlet for me and I was hooked.\n\nThe first film I have memories of watching as a child was:\n\nMary Poppins.\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nAnnie Hall, Being John Malkovitch and Nights of Cabiria\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nBut I'm a Cheerleader\n\nErin Greenwell & Julie Goldman\n\nFILM TITLE: Commitment Ceremony\n\nDIRECTOR: Erin Greenwell & Julie Goldman\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nEG: Erin Greenwell director and editor Brooklyn\n\nJG: Julie Goldman. Co-director, Writer (song CO-Written with Jason Blanche) Co-Star.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nEG: Doing a living history presentation on Butch Cassady and not getting beat up for it. Tons of shorts, including Commitment Ceremony, a featurette 21, and a feature Big Dreams in Little Hope (MOM).\n\nJG: Mel Brooks, Initially attracted to me the entirety of Entertainment. Blazing Saddles. I have been lots of shorts, and co starred in my first feature with Erin Greenwell and her film Big Dreams In Little Hope.\n\nPlease describe your film in 1-2 short sentences.\n\nEG: Music video about Julie Goldman's right to get more than commitment ceremon-ied!\n\nJG: Music Video that explores the rediculous-ness that GLBT can't get legally married.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nEG: Julie performed the song and I begged her to co-direct the music video with me.\n\nJG: I wrote the song to perform in my stand up act - and it became more and more important while planning my own wedding. And then Erin approached me about doing it as a film. And I said \"HELLS YEAH.\"\n\nThe first film I have memories of watching as a child was:\n\nEG: Some Like it Hot\n\nJG: History of The World Part 1.\n\nThe first LGBT film I ever saw was:\n\nEG: \"Personal Best\"\n\nJG:\"Claire of the Moon\"\n\nAdam Baran\n\nFILM TITLE: Jinx!\n\nDIRECTOR: Adam Baran\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nMy name is Adam Baran, and I wrote and directed \"Jinx!\", a hilarious short screening in the \"Women on the Verge\" program at NewFest. I currently live in New York City where I work as an assistant, and I'm also a staff writer for BUTT Magazine.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nThe first moment I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker was when I was home sick one day when I was about eleven years old. My mom rented Strangers On A Train by Alfred Hitchcock. I couldn't stop thinking about the merry-go-round sequence at the end. I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker after that.\n\nI've made two shorts so far. My first short \"Love and Deaf\" screened at NewFest in 2004 and was released on DVD compilations in North America, France, Germany and Switzerland. It premiered on Here! TV in the US and Pink TV in France in 2006.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nI went to film school as an undergrad at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but that's not to say I'd recommend it to anyone. I remember one of my writing teachers telling me I would be limiting myself if I wrote about gay characters and themes. I thought about her when I was introducing \"Love and Deaf\" in front of 1,500 people at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, during the Frameline Festival.\n\nPlease describe your film in 1-2 short sentences.\n\nWhen Eleanor, a mousey second grader finds herself \"jinxed\" by a bully named Rachel, she's unable to speak until someone says her name. Eleanor sets off on a madcap quest to free herself from Rachel's curse before the 3:00 school bell rings, seeking help from a crazy math teacher, a deranged abstract artist, and a clueless father - with disastrous results.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nI was always the arty gay boy who was more into playing hand-clapping games and making lanyard bracelets with the girls than playing sports with the boys. I wanted to try and explore and exaggerate some of the more absurd aspects of my own childhood. Plus my friends still \"jinx\" me when we both speak at the same time, and so one of them did it one day and I instantly had the idea for the film.\n\nWhat was the most satisfying aspect in making your film?\n\nHaving the chance to work with the incredibly talented young actors, especially the two leads Cassie Blair and Spenser Carrion Leigh who were hilarious and totally on-point throughout the production. I had been really nervous about the challenge of working with kids, but it couldn't have turned out any better than it did.\n\nThe first LGBT film I ever saw was:\n\nDoes Mannequin count? Come on, Meshach Taylor? That's gotta count.\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nVideodrome, Desperate Living, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nShortbus. It really affected me like no other film ever has. I was really emotional for about a week or so after.\n\nCheck back next week for the rest of our Q&A sessions with this month's directors!\n\nNEWDRAFT\n\nWe are pleased to announce that NewDraft: NewFest's Screenplay Competition & Reading Series in now accepting submissions.

There's no better way to relax amidst the chaos than, say, catching the latest film at NewFest/IFC Center's screening THIS Monday (11/26), or, maybe, enjoying the cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, & cool items up for auction at the NewFest Winter Benefit on 12/9. All the details for those two events - as well as the theatrical release of NINA'S HEAVENLY DELIGHTS, two Q&A's with directors DIEGO COSTA and ANDRE HEREFORD, new LGBT DVD releases, and some important reminders about 2008 submission and NewDraft: NewFest's Screenplay Competition & Reading Series - can be found below.\n\nNEWFEST@IFC CENTER\n\nSince July 2006, NewFest has partnered with the IFC Center to present NewFest at the IFC Center, an LGBT programming series once a month, showcasing past festival favorites, specially curated programs, and a local shorts series! NewFest members receive discounted admission to this series!\n\nNewfest returns to the IFC Center on Monday, November 26th @ 8:15 P.M. with two films:\n\nThe Parricide Sessions\n\nDirected by Diego Costa\n\n8:15PM\n\nIn his daring documentary feature debut, filmmaker Diego Costa tries to convince his father to participate in a series of role-playing exercises in which his father would portray Diego's ex-boyfriends. Not surprisingly, dad’s a bit uncomfortable with the idea. Integrating a wealth of home-video footage, The Parricide Sessions examines the dynamics between a gay son and his father, and the complex underpinnings of gay men’s longing for a father figure. In English and Portuguese with English subtitles. 72 min. More information about the filmmaker can be found at his website: Diego Costa\n\nscreening with:\n\nThe Naked-Boy Business, Part 1\n\nDirected by Andre Hereford\n\nAn experimental film exploring straight men’s feelings about the sexualized male body. 7 min.\n\nTicketing:\n\nGeneral admission tickets to the IFC Center are $11.\n\nNewFest at the IFC Center tickets are $8 for NewFest\n\nmembers with member cards and for seniors.\n\nTickets are available at the IFC Center box office the\n\nday of the show, and advance tickets are\n\navailable online at www.ifccenter.com.\n\nDirections:\n\nThe IFC Center is located at: 323 Avenue of the Americas (at West 3rd Street).\n\nFor more information about the IFC Center, please visit their website.\n\nFor more information about NewFest@IFC Center, please visit our website.\n\nDIRECTOR Q&A: DIEGO COSTA & ANDRE HEREFORD\n\nIn celebration of their films playing at the IFC Center this Monday (see above),\n\nNewFest is proud to present two brief Q&A sessions with the men behind the movies:\n\nDiego Costa\n\nFILM TITLE: The Parricide Sessions\n\nDIRECTOR: Diego Costa\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nDiego Costa, originally from Brazil, have lived in America for 10 years. Living in New York City. I also blog at www.DonDiegoOnline.blogspot.com.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nFilmmaking for me has always been an extrapolation of poetry and writing. Definitely not an attempt to entertain, but to speak the unspeakable. To give form to that which, specially for gays, goes silent. I make a conscious attempt not to follow formulaic notions of what cinema must be. Which means I am not very interested in having a regular script or a linear narrative. I made three short films in 16mm while I was getting my film degree in college. I've been very lucky and the films have shown around the world in various film festivals -- in India, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Portugal.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nYes, I got my BA and MFA at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I also was a teaching assistant.\n\nPlease describe your film.\n\nA gay son tries to find similarities between his ex-lovers and his father - all the while exposing the dad to uncomfortable questions and gay situations.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nAfter realizing that most of my boyfriends had the same virtues, and flaws, as my father - I decided to examine the issue with a camera. While trying to marry Freudian theory with real-life queer misery, my goal was to demystify the father figure and open a kind of dialogue that most gay sons could never have with their dads.\n\nAre you working on a new film yet? If so, give us a brief description.\n\nI will probably start working on a similar film, but one that focuses on my relationship with my mother and how I've always wanted to be like her. We live in two different countries, so the logistics are hard to figure out, but it really interests me to use the camera as a link to uncover certain things we learn to keep quiet about. The camera as some sort of psychoanalyzing tool.\n\nThe first film I have memories of watching as a child was:\n\nLabyrinth with David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly\n\nMy top three all-time favorite films are:\n\nCleo from 5 to 7 by Agnes Varda, Alphaville by Jean-Luc Godard, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul by RW Fassbinder\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nIt Wasn't Love by Sadie Benning\n\nAndre Hereford\n\nFILM TITLE: The Naked-Boy Business, part 1\n\nDIRECTOR: Andre Hereford\n\nPlease introduce yourself: Your name, occupation if not a full-time filmmaker, and where you are based.\n\nI'm Andre Hereford, a writer/director and producer who runs a production company in NYC with my bf/partner Riccardo Costa.\n\nWhat initially attracted you to filmmaking? How many films have you made?\n\nI wrote my first story at 9, a gory murder-mystery that freaked out my mother, but won the respect of my teacher and classmates. I've needed to write ever since and came to filmmaking as a young man whose parents shared their love of watching movies with me from an even earlier age. I've directed four shorts (including Naked Boy), produced or co-produced three others, and worked in development and production for Spike Lee on 10 features.\n\nDid you go to film school? If so, where?\n\nGraduated from NYU in 1994 at 20.\n\nPlease describe your film.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek take on straight boys' attitudes about male hotness, featuring man-on-the-street interviews, pop culture collage, excerpts from my own work and brand-new erotic photos and video shot of model A-Rod (um, me) by gay art legend Peter Berlin.\n\nWhere did the idea for your film come from?\n\nThe film was inspired by my decision to start art modeling as a side job and by my subsequent discovery of Peter Berlin's work, which, much to my dismay - given his talent, prowess and influence - was appallingly unknown not just to me and my friends but even to supposed \"art people.\"\n\nAre you working on a new film yet? If so, give us a brief description.\n\nRaising money with producers and my partner to shoot an indie feature, Queen of Harlem, a sexy comedy about an Italian actress who comes to the States to shoot a film in Spanish Harlem and falls hard for the men, the music, the whole vibe of that hot 'hood. Our producer calls it a cross between La Dolce Vita and She's Gotta Have It. There's gay stuff, but it's not specifically a gay story.\n\nThe first film I have memories of watching as a child was:\n\nTwo: The Wiz and Clash of the Titans. Don't have any of those early Star Wars memories that everyone claims, but the other two I remember VIVIDLY.\n\nThe first LGBT film I ever saw was:\n\nParting Glances, late one night on Movie Channel. I was 12, and I wanna cry just thinking about how much I knew but didn't know that the film was about me.\n\nThe one LGBT film that has had the biggest impact on me is:\n\nApartment Zero, crypto-gay as it is, has seeped into every single thing I've written since I saw it at 17 (I'm 33 now).\n\nInterviews reprinted from NewFest @ indieWIRE: http://blogs.indiewire.com/newblog/\n\nWINTER BENEFIT\n\nHK Lounge\n\n405 West 39th Street\n\n(at 9th Ave)\n\nSunday, December 9\n\n6:30-9:00PM\n\nAdmission:\n\n$65 General\n\n$50 NewFest 2008 Member Discount\n\nFor information on NewFest 2008 Membership levels, please click here.\n\nPurchase Tickets Now!\n\nFeaturing a silent auction of unique items perfect for the holiday season, cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, & music by DJ Lina!

Enjoy!\n\nThe Hunger (Tony Scott, 1983): Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon star in this wonderful, often-overlooked classic in the lesbian vampire sub-genre.\n\nInterview with a Vampire(Neil Jordan, 1994): Years before Jake and Heath lit up the screen, there was another powerhouse gay couple: Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Playing bloodthirsty couple Louis de Pointe du Lac & Lestat de Lioncourt, the stars deliver the chills in this dark cinema classic.\n\nVoodoo Academy (David DeCoteau, 2000): Walking the fine line between b-movie schlock and softcore pornography, DeCoteau's horror films are unmistakable.

NewBlog: Parting Glances, LGBT horror, and being our friend!\n\nIT'S ALIVE!\n\nWelcome, LGBT film fans, to NewFest's new weekly blog series. Our big festival may only come once a year, but we're chock-full of other celluloid goodness year-round and we want YOU to know about it. Like, for example, this month's Parting Glances event (details below), featuring the East Coast premiere of the newly-restored print and appearances by film stars Kathy Kinney, Richard Ganoung, and John Bolger. Or our monthly screenings at the IFC Center. Or announcements about our first annual screenplay contest (details coming soon). From our latest events and announcements to the coolest LGBT film releases, our blog's got it all!\n\nPARTING GLANCES\n\nNewfest and Outfest are proud to partner for a special Legacy Project screening, the East Coast Premiere of the restored Parting Glances!\n\nDirected and written by Bill Sherwood, Parting Glances (1986) is the first feature film restoration by the Legacy Project and is among the most beloved LGBT films of the last 25 years. AIDS claimed Bill Sherwood in 1990 before he could complete another film and Parting Glances faced the inevitable limbo and deterioration to which most queer independent films are consigned. The Outfest Legacy Project for LGBT Film Preservation, however, has ensured that Bill Sherwood's legacy, this timely and truly timeless feature, is now safe.\n\nPlease join us for the East Coast Premiere of the restored\n\nPARTING GLANCES\n\nMonday, October 29, 2007\n\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\nWalter Reade Theater\n\n165 West 65th Street, upper levelBetween Broadway & Amsterdam 6:30 pm: Pre-Reception (VIP ticket holders)\n\n7:30 pm: Screening followed by Q&A (all ticket holders)\n\n9:30 - 11:00 pm: Reception (all ticket holders)\n\nScheduled to appear: Kathy Kinney, Richard Ganoung, and John Bolger\n\nTickets:\n\n$100 VIP - Pre-reception, Preferred Seating, Reception\n\n$75 General Admission - General Seating, Reception\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nProceeds from this event benefit:\n\nNewFest, celebrating twenty years serving the New York LGBT film and arts communities, and\n\nThe Outfest Legacy Project for LGBT Film Preservation\n\nFor a personal take on the film by NewFest's own Kerry Weldon, click here.\n\nWant to know more about the film?

Was there something you needed to see again? Did you miss a screening completely? Catch up on some past festival selections new to DVD:\n\nThe Gymnast (Ned Farr, 2006): Dazzling and sexy, this high-flying drama chronicles the journey two women take to grow and to find newfound strength together. (NewFest 2006 - Winner: Audience Favorite)\n\nThe Lair: Season 1 (here! TV, 2007): When the naked corpses of young men begin to turn up with strange neck wounds, Thom, an intrepid young gay journalist, follows clues that lead him to a private gentleman’s club called The Lair... (NewFest 2007 - selection)\n\nOne to Another (Chacun sa nuit) (Pascal Arnold & Jean-Marc Barr, 2006): Suffused with eroticism in every frame, One to Another follows the mysterious disappearance of Pierre, the front man of a local rock band, and his preternatural influence - both sexually and emotionally - over a small group of friends. (NewFest 2007 - selection)\n\nRed Without Blue (Brooke Sebold, Benita Sills & Todd Sills, 2007): As Mark and Clair become adults, they reach new understandings about family, gender, identity, and the bond between identical twins who are no longer identical. (NewFest 2007 - selection)\n\nTimes Have Been Better (Le Ciel sur la tête) (Régis Mussett, 2006): Times Have Been Better creatively inverts the typical coming out narrative by focusing on those who have been come out to more than the person who comes out, making for an inventive comedy. (NewFest 2007 - Winner: Foreign Narrative Feature)\n\nDid I miss your favorite movie?

The only difference about Dracula in this film? Well, he's a she... and she's pretty deranged.\n\nDante's Cove (here!, 2005 - current): Okay, so it's not a movie, but here!'s break-out TV show about a small town & its spooky past makes for a great guilty pleasure.\n\nWhat are your favorite LGBT horror movies?
