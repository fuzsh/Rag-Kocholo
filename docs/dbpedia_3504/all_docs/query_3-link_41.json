        "text": "Allow yourself to be a beginner. No one starts off at the top” It’s okay to not have great results yet. It’s okay to suck in the beginning. It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s okay to fail. But it’s not okay to quit. It’s not okay to throw the towel and say, “it’s not for me.” It’s not okay to give up on your dreams. It’s not okay to live an “okay life” Why? Because you’re meant for greatness. You’re supposed to have a happy ending. You’re supposed to live a blessed life (if you choose to.) Because God has an amazing plan for you, plan to prosper you and not to harm you. So claim it! Believe in God’s promises. Because it never fails. He loves you so much and He delights in seeing you blessed! Keep going! Keep re-starting. Keep committing! Have a blessed weekend! #aimforgreateness #findlifepurpose #achieveit #thinkdigitalbusiness #investormindset #digitalbusinessmentor #learnandearnindigitalspace\n\n🌟 Happy National Take a Chance Day!

Let your imagination soar and set audacious goals for yourselves. The sky is not the limit; it's just the beginning of your journey. 🔹 Embrace curiosity: The world is your classroom, and every experience is an opportunity to learn and grow. Stay curious, ask questions, and never stop seeking knowledge. Embrace new ideas and perspectives, as they will shape your understanding of the world. 🔹 Embrace failure as a stepping stone: Remember, failure is not the end; it's a valuable stepping stone on the path to success. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it as fuel to propel you towards your goals. Your resilience and ability to bounce back will be your greatest strength. 🔹 Surround yourself with positivity: Surround yourself with supportive and like-minded individuals who believe in your dreams. Seek mentors who can guide you, inspire you, and help you navigate the challenges along the way. Together, you can achieve amazing things. 🔹 Embrace your uniqueness: You are one-of-a-kind, with a set of talents and passions that make you special. Embrace your uniqueness and let it shine. Celebrate your strengths, and don't be afraid to take risks and pursue your passions wholeheartedly. 🔹 Believe in yourself: Trust in your abilities and have confidence in what you can accomplish. Believe that you have the power to make a difference in the world. Your dreams are within reach, and with dedication and perseverance, you can turn them into reality. Remember, you have the potential to shape the future and make a positive impact on the world. Believe in yourselves, stay focused, and never underestimate your capabilities. The journey may have its ups and downs, but with determination and a growth mindset, you can conquer any challenge that comes your way. Keep shining brightly, young stars! ✨💪🏼 And remember, the world is eagerly waiting to witness the incredible things you will achieve. Go out there and chase your dreams with unwavering passion and determination!\n\nGlorrrrrry.💃 Today is the last day of the month. Who is as excited to cross over to August as I am? Going into the month of August, I want you to reflect on this 👇 THERE IS NO PERFECT TIME. THE BEST TIME IS NOW. Is there a goal that you have for this month that you were not able to achieve? It's not too late to keep pursuing this goal. A Chinese proverb says \"The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.\" You can go back to that process you left. You won't achieve that goal without going through the process. The process could be stressful and tiring. I lie not, but, I trust you don't want to regret giving up on the process that would bring about your progress in the future. Someone is saying \"The future will be bright. I have God.\" Yes, I know and believe that too, but God will not do for you what He has given you resources and wisdom to do. The progress that the future will bring starts from the process you intentionally go through today. Stop waiting for the perfect time, it's NOW. Stop procrastinating. Stop wasting time on things irrelevant to your purpose and goals. I love you and I'm rooting for your growth. #Empressofimpacts #GodsSpecialEsther #ThePrayingEmpressGodIsBuilding 📸My tired self after my semester exams.\n\nA Thousand Letters to Redemta✨ 💫I have composed a thousand heartfelt letters to my younger self. Sadly, they were all in the confines of my imagination. Undisclosed and hidden like my little secret treasures 🪙 Here is your first letter🛩️ Dear Younger Redemta✨ As I pen this letter I am full of hope that your future is full of blessings and endless possibilities. Here are a few valuable lessons I wish I knew when I was your age. 🌠Embrace continuous learning: Stay curious and never stop learning. Every bit of information you acquire will be a building block for your future. Embrace a growth mindset where you see challenges and failures as stepping stones to your success. By adopting this mindset you will not only achieve your goals but also become a better version of yourself. 💡Build strong support system: Cherish the people in your life. Family, buddies, and mentors will be your great pillars of support and guidance. Invest time in nurturing these connections even when you don't need them in the short term. It's building bridges before you desperately need them. 💎Your health is your wealth: Your physical and mental health are your most precious assets. Make them a priority, for they will enable you to achieve all your dreams. Take care of your health and it will indeed take care of you. Take this advice with a pinch of salt, dearest. 💰Money matters: Plan for your financial future intentionally. Financial security will grant you freedom and peace of mind. Develop good saving culture and align your investment with your financial goals. I will say it again, invest first before impressing. 🪙Finally, stay true to your values. This is what will keep you grounded and propel you forward in a world full of uncertainty. With love and wisdom from your future. Yours Redemta✨ ⭐💫🌟What would you advice your younger self? Feel free to share your words of wisdom and let's grow together. #20dayslinkedinchallengewithhaoma #throwbackthursday #becoming #valuablelessons\n\nI waited 24 long months for my Service Offer to manifest, and it nearly crushed me. *(What to do when things don't happen as fast as you'd like them to)* The hurt was terrible. All my friends moved forward, and I felt left behind, Abandoned. In retrospect, if I had to go over it again, I wouldn't want it any other way. Here were the surface reasons for the wait: •The COVID 19 lockdown •A not-ready Statement of Result •An error in my name My then perceived reason: •A demonic attack The real reason: •My weak character and stamina God needed time to build my spirit and mind. If I had gone the way I was, I would've ruined things in my life, And in others' as well. I would have entered into all sorts of avoidable trouble. Plus, my joy wouldn't have been complete. But the delay saved me. Hear this: Your waiting season is not a tragedy, Neither is it a curse. It is YOUR TRAINING SEASON! Face it with honour. Don't spend any more time crying or complaining. Go through this curriculum in your destiny, and learn the lessons as FAST as you can. Only then will you move forward like a conqueror. The things I gained within and after that season could fill a book: –Strength of spirit and mind –More beauty in character –My 7-figure digital business (+ my future Change project), etc. I'm so glad God put me through it. And I know some will come again in the future. By His Grace, I'll learn and grow and flourish. So, honour those who have moved forward, But stay and grow. It won't crush you. It'll only secure your rise and make you glow brighter. Remember, I'm rooting for you. Keep rising and have a wonderful week ahead⭐️ #nysc #motivation #change\n\nDiscover My 2️⃣3️⃣ Lessons of 23 Years by Devoting 23 seconds….
