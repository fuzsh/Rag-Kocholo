        "text": "The Lost Husband is now a MOVIE starring Leslie Bibb & Josh Duhamel!\n\nIt hit #1 on Netflix in August 2020 and was one of their Top 25 movies of the year! It also hit the Top 10 in over 30 countries around the world in 2020!\n\nPerfect for fans of Jennifer Weiner and Emily Giffin, this tender and heartwarming novel explores the trials of losing what matters most—and how there’s always more than we can imagine left to find.\n\nDear Libby, It occurs to me that you and your two children have been living with your mother for—Dear Lord!—two whole years, and I’m writing to see if you’d like to be rescued.\n\nThe letter comes out of the blue, and just in time for Libby Moran, who—after the sudden death of her husband, Danny—went to stay with her hypercritical mother. Now her crazy Aunt Jean has offered Libby an escape: a job and a place to live on her farm in the Texas Hill Country. Before she can talk herself out of it, Libby is packing the minivan, grabbing the kids, and hitting the road.\n\nLife on Aunt Jean’s goat farm is both more wonderful and more mysterious than Libby could have imagined. Beyond the animals and the strenuous work, there is quiet—deep, country quiet. And despite everything she’s lost, Libby soon realizes how much more she’s found. She hasn’t just traded one kind of crazy for another: She may actually have found the place to bring her little family—and herself—back to life.\n\nThe original paperback . . .\n\nThe movie poster!\n\nShooting is completed for The Lost Husband movie!\n\nRead the article in Variety here.

Yes. Twice.”\n\n–Brené Brown, author of #1 New York Times bestseller Daring Greatly\n\n“Beautifully well-written fiction that focuses on character.”\n\n–The Dallas Morning News\n\n“Generous and love ly . . . this book brims with hope and possibility.”\n\n–Campus Circle Summer Reading List\n\n“Center writes endearingly of love and family in her fourth novel, with lessons about loss, gain, standing up for oneself, and accepting that your best is good enough.”\n\n–Booklist\n\n“Katherine Center’s characters are charming and unforgettable.”\n\n–Fresh Fiction\n\n“Sweet, smart, and inspiring.”\n\n–Bookfinds\n\n“I laughed out loud so many times that my husband and children asked what I was reading”\n\n–Book Junkie\n\n“Katherine has mastered the art of the thoughtful, relationship-oriented page turner.”\n\n—Boston Mamas\n\nCultureMap • Love on a Goat Farm\n\nBrené Brown • “Katherine Center: The Lost Husband”\n\nThe Dallas Morning News • “The Lost Husband”\n\nREADER REVIEWS\n\n“Katherine Center can do no wrong. I freaking love everything I have read by her, and The Lost Husband is no exception. I don’t have anything intelligent or smart or ‘book critiquish’ to say about this; I just loved it so much. The characters are all fantastic, Libby is so compelling and relatable, and I want an Aunt Jean in my life like yesterday. Center’s books give me such warm fuzzies while also slaying me in the heart.”\n\n—MEGAN\n\n“I loved this book the way I love chocolate, and I gobbled it up just as fast. Katherine Center has a gift for creating relatable characters, believable dialogue, and interesting storylines. I came to know these people, like them, and care about them.”\n\n—SHARON\n\n“Katherine can do no wrong. Everything she writes is perfection.”\n\n—MOLLIE\n\n“I absolutely loved it and didn’t want to put it down. I look forward to watching the movie. I definitely recommend this book and can’t wait to read more by Katherine Center because she hasn’t disappointed me yet and I don’t think she will.”\n\n—CGR\n\n“I LOVED this. So far, this is my favorite Katherine Center book. It’s full of heart and soul. Beautiful.”\n\n—SUZANNE\n\n“Gahhhhhhhhhhh!!! I was up all night with this book and then sucked in again this morning. I had to finish it because I knew I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else until I did. . . . The Lost Husband is sweet, poignant, inspiring, and full of heart. And O’Connor? SWOONNNNNNN!!! Loved it. #1 read so far this year!”\n\n—ROBIN\n\n“Another outstanding story by Katherine Center!”\n\n—COLENE\n\n“I’ve read three of Center’s novels including The Lost Husband. What the repeated adjectives of the reviews (sweet, heart-warming, summer read, happy endings) don’t get across is: the craft of her novels—how the words just disappear and you are immersed in the story, which always seems organic and relatable; the moral structure inherent in all her stories; how she handles her characters with the utmost respect for their multifaceted wholeness; and that the endings are more “hopeful,” than happy, because her characters are always on a transformative journey, which in and of itself inspires hope in the reader. I think Center is so good at what she does that it appears ‘seamless’ and consequently her craft is perhaps a bit underestimated and under-rated. Highly recommend her books—you will want to live in them.”\n\n—LARA\n\n“Wonderful story full of losing love and finding love.”\n\n—SUSAN\n\n“This book just made me feel good! ‘Anything was possible. Everything was uncertain.’ I loved it, and I also loved the Netflix film adaptation!”\n\n—ANN\n\n“Five Stars Of Wonderful***** Such a sweet and hopeful story. This is one of those feel good books that leave a big smile on your face after reading it.”\n\n—DEE\n\n“I absolutely LOVED this book from start to finish. I loved the storyline, characters and can get better than living on a goat farm? This was a quick read as I found myself drawn to it and kept wanting to read more! The love the way the author writes and draws you into it ALL. Bravo! 5-stars from me!”\n\n—LIZ\n\n“Another FABULOUS read!”\n\n—LIBBY\n\nAnything was possible. Everything was uncertain. But I knew one thing for sure: is bounced back before, and I would do it again and again and again.\n\n“Katherine Center never disappoints! This is the perfect single setting read to kick off the week. It’s warm, sweet, and heartwarming. It is a book about loss, finding yourself, and finding love.”\n\n—SHUYUN\n\n“Fabulous! This story is the perfect mix of romance and women’s fiction. It’s poignant, funny, honest, real, inspiring, and I just ate the story up.“\n\n—M.L.\n\n“No one understands the human heart the way Katherine Center does. I actually watched the Netflix movie version of this book and was completely enthralled with the story. Knowing that the book is always a thousand times better then the movie I read the book non-stop over a week. I was not disappointed because the book is exquisitely written.”\n\n—ANN-MARGARET\n\n“Katherine Center books never disappoint. Her sense of humor always shines through in her characters and they become so relatable. I find myself laughing out loud when I’m reading.”\n\n—JACKIE\n\n“A beautiful, fun quick read. Loved every word!”\n\n—KAREN\n\n“Another great read by Katherine Center! ❤❤❤ I read this book in one day, couldn’t put it down. Loved each character. Sadness. Happiness. Redemption. Hope. It’s all here in, as said, another great read by Katherine Center! Plus, another beautiful bonus? Josh Duhamel on the cover! And totally picturing him as O’Connor throughout? Total, total bonus! Don’t miss this one!”\n\n—JANET\n\n“Touching and lovely novel about growing and changing after sadness and hopelessness.”\n\n—PAULA\n\n“The sad part of reading this book was I have now read all of Katherine Centers book. I have to wait until July for a new one. I watched the movie before reading the book and they did a great job. I was not disappointed. If you haven’t read one of her books I highly recommend them.”\n\n—ROBYN\n\n“I love how Katherine uses simple words to express complex emotions. An engaging and heartwarming story about loss, love, trust, and starting over!!”\n\n—ANANDITA\n\n“Heartwarming and real. Katherine Center never fails to enthrall the reader, and this book is no exception. I’ve read some of her later works first, but I felt just as at home with this one. You’ll find heartache, loss, and grief alongside lessons of love and family and, finally, discovering what’s true to your heart. Another excellent story.”\n\n—NANETTE\n\n“More great writing by someone who is now a favourite author! A terrific rebuilding story, love it.”\n\n—GAYLIN\n\n“Working my way through Katherine Center’s books and love them all. Such a beautiful storyteller.”\n\n—SARA\n\n“Great story. The dialogue was so well written.”\n\n—DRAMA MAMA READS\n\n“Classic Katherine Center. This woman is a wizard. She had the gift even with her earlier novels. I loved everything about this book. Loved the characters, loved the goats named after famous women, loved the twists, loved the ending, and I definitely loved how everyone called the bully Pee Pants. Read this. You’ll thank me later.”\n\n—HANNAH\n\n“A very enjoyable read. This book manages to cover heavy topics in a way that isn’t painful or sad to read – in fact, it’s very hopeful. The Netflix movie follows the book closely, and both are great!“\n\n—LEAH\n\n“Exactly what I needed, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!”\n\n—ANNIE\n\n“I saw the movie version on Netflix first, then had to read the book. It was better, of course, and such a sweet feel good story. Heartwarming, delightful, and comforting.”\n\n—GINA\n\n“I am just in awe of this book. Katherine Center, you are my new favorite author.”\n\n—STEPHANIE\n\n“Katherine Center is the only author who tempts me into reading her books all in one sitting. This book is my favorite of them all!”\n\n—P.R.\n\n” ‘Even people who love you will knock the hell out of you sometimes. That’s just life. And the more we practice, the better we get at shaking it off.’ (THE LOST HUSBAND – KATHERINE CENTER) This is a wonderful story of facing life’s challenges head-on, living our best lives, and opening our hearts to possibilities. Katherine Center is becoming one of my top go-to authors!”\n\n—JACQUIE\n\n“Another Katherine Center book that I truly enjoyed. Her books are always so down to earth and sweet.”\n\n—AMBER\n\n“I wanted to climb into this book and sit at Aunt Jeans table for lunch and a good talk. I was hard pressed to put this book down and read it over the course of a day and a half. The characters are comfortable people I’d be honored to have as my friends . The setting sounds heavenly and I was in love with this story from the first page.”\n\n—REBEKAH\n\n“I’m a fan of Katherine Center. She’s a wonderful storyteller.”\n\n—APRIL\n\n“Center always does an amazing job at painting real characters so you feel immediately connected. The dialogue sparkles. Their quirks are endearing. This story focuses on parallel narratives with a mother and her young daughter both wrestling with what life is throwing at them and coming out on the other side stronger–growing from the experiences rather than feeling like victims. There is a theme of acceptance running through the story–you can’t change some things, you can’t change some people. But this acceptance isn’t about resignation and defeat; It’s about working with what IS and not letting those things or those people hold you back from your own life journey. This is such a valuable message. It’s also about letting your hair down and not leading such a worrisome, rigid existence. And aside from all that, this is just a super fun read. It teases you with unrevealed secrets. It puts you in the middle of farm life. It will keep you turning the pages. Thumbs up.”\n\n—KIERSTEN\n\n“I saw the movie first, by accident, and loved it. I loved the book just as much! It’s a quick, fun, uplifting book.”\n\n—NINA\n\n“I found so much of myself in this book. It became a cathartic experience; It was reassuring that I wasn’t the only person (even if she was fictional!) that had these feelings and experiences: being raised by a mother who found it impossible to show love, being alone even when in the midst of others, worrying that no matter how much I do it will never be enough. One line from the book that may stick with me forever, though, was “Why couldn’t I ever, ever feel like I belonged anywhere?”. She wrote that line, I felt it. Ms. Center writes brilliantly. She captures the reader from the first line and doesn’t let go until the final word. . . . Reading this book is a breathless ride from start to finish.”\n\n—PEGGY\n\n“I consumed this book in less than 24 hrs!”\n\n—TERESA\n\n“This was my third Katherine Center book and I loved it just as much as the first two. She’s solidly on my favorite author list at this point! Her stories are everything I want in a book I can’t put down.”\n\n—DAWN\n\n“An unforgettable story of love, loss and resilience . . . No spoilers here, just read and enjoy! Katherine Center, I LOVE YOU! Keep’em coming!”\n\n—PAT\n\n” ‘It’s not really what happens to you that matters as much as who you become in response to those things.’ Ultimately, this was about loss, resilience, healing, and rebuilding. Accepting the pain of the past with the hope of the future. Beautifully honest, sweet, and hopeful.”\n\n—DANIELLE\n\n“I love this book. I love the story about this sweet widowed woman who just wants the best for her family . . . Everything about this story is wonderful from the characters and storylines to the feelings I felt as I read this. Katherine Center has become one of my new favorite authors.”\n\n—MARTIE\n\n“This was just the sweetest book. It almost makes me want to take my kids back to when they under 10 so I can get a do-over. (Almost.) There are so many good lessons to be learned and I got such good feelings from it. No blood, guts or violence so it was a refreshing change to real life for me. Read it!”\n\n—LAURA\n\n“I really love Katherine Center’s writing! Her books just draw me in right away!”\n\n—TAMMY\n\n“I had never read Katherine Center before and had received a copy of How To Walk Away in a promotion from a book giveaway and I really liked it and wanted to read more. I am so glad that I did. I loved The Lost Husband. The storyline, the characters and especially the setting. Libby and Jean and O’Conner walked right into my heart. What a delightful book.”\n\n—MARTI\n\n“This was such a bittersweet story but so good! I love how Katherine Center pulls out the positive in all her stories and brings the theme of trying your best and not giving up.”\n\n—DIANN\n\n“I love Katherine Center. This is a great story!”\n\n—CAREY\n\n“I don’t know where K. Center gets her ideas, but her books are unlike any others I’ve read. This is the 3rd book I’ve read by Katherine Center and they have all been great. The plots are unusual, many characters are quirky, and besides sadness, there is always the message of hope.”\n\n—JUDITH\n\n“Amazing book . . . It’s heartwarming and optimistic to read. This is the third book I have read by Katherine Center and I have loved all of them. They offer subtle romance, thoughtful insights about life, great writing and loveable characters.”\n\n—LENE\n\n“Gobbled this one up!”\n\n—AMBER\n\n“I have discovered Katherine Centers books this past year and have found them to be the most relaxing enjoyable reads that soothe me during this pandemic. This book did not disappoint, featuring interesting women who grow as they experience both good and hard times.”\n\n—SHEVAWN\n\n“What a fabulous book full of wonderful characters who I cared so much about. Highly recommend.”\n\n—ANGELA\n\n“I love all Katherine Center books, and The Lost Husband is no exception. I laughed, cried & even felt a little outraged. The story of resilience & learning to cherish what you have instead of what you’ve lost/don’t have is inspiring and encouraging. No matter where you are in your life journey, The Lost Husband will touch your heart & soul. Highly recommend this quick & easy read!”\n\n—AMANDA\n\n” ‘Chick lit’ has seen me through the pandemic (thank you, chick lit), and this sweet story is one of my top picks.”\n\n—KAM\n\n“I had already watched the movie and liked it. Somehow I had low expectations for the book but it was amazing. I had to smile at the description of small town life, especially the parts about the schools and about neighbours helping one another.”\n\n—KAREN\n\n“Center’s best novel yet. Full of warmth and humor and life on a farm and a bit of mystery.”\n\n—DEBORAH\n\n“Katherine Center is my new favorite author. Every one of her books has been my favorite so far. What I like most about her is she gives me hope. She says to me this is so bad right now but it will be okay. You are gonna get stronger and you are gonna forget and move on. Despite everything you are gonna be happy. It is free therapy.”\n\n—SELIN\n\n“Couldn’t put it down. I ❤️ Katherine Center -Excited to watch the movie on Netflix now.”\n\n—CHRISTINE\n\n“I watched the movie of this story recently and when I saw the book I decided to read it as there’s always more comprehensive dialogue and I’m so glad I did… The writer kept me engaged until the end; I love her storytelling!\n\nI highly recommend this book and am now looking for more books from this author.”\n\n—STEPHANIE\n\n“I could definitely read this book over again, just to try to absorb the life lessons in this wonderful book. All the characters are great, especially Libby, Jean, and the kids. Loved this one!”\n\n—DENISE\n\n“The writing was positively addicting (just ask the chores at my house I have ignored for the last 12 hours so I could read.) Center’s dialogue made me laugh out loud on several occasions.”\n\n—BRENDA\n\n“I am always amazed by how an author, who is still fairly young, can be so wise and can bestow her brilliant concepts and beliefs upon her characters. I learn new things, and am left pondering so much about life by the time I finish one of Katherine Center’s novels. Center creates characters who are far from perfect, but they mean well, and when they love, they give themselves over to the hope that it will last. That is a beautiful thing!”\n\n—DANA\n\n“Heartwarming. A smooth, easy read that has you touching on a wide range of emotions, thought provoking, finding hope and a whole lot of love.”\n\n—LEAH\n\n“This is a fantastic book!!! And the author is very talented! I was hooked on the first page and that never changed throughout. What a great story with phenomenal characters. Can’t even begin to list the reasons why I loved it so much because there are so many of them . . . Do you folks out there want a real treat in reading? READ THIS BOOK!”\n\n—CAROL\n\n“I adore Katherine Center’s books. They are always so unique and suck you right in.”\n\n—JULIE\n\n“I love Katherine Center’s novels. They are wonderfully relatable, funny and heartstring tuggers. Her latest, The Lost Husband, is no exception. When it comes down to it, Libby is every woman. Like I said, relatable. Life hasn’t turned out the way she expected yet, despite that fact, she keeps trying her darnedest to keep her family moving forward. . . . Center is a gifted storyteller and I loved this one. It’s a story of hope and never giving up – trying your hardest even in the darkest moments. Because when all is said and done – it’s worth it. Loved it. Highly recommended.”\n\n—MARY\n\n“I watched the movie a few months ago, and it took me a bit to recognize to book. Oh my gosh – I LOVED the book!!! I can see myself reading this again, for sure.”\n\n—BRANDY\n\n“Watching the movie as we speak!! Ugh I LOVE Katherine center. I said it a million times and I’ll say it again. 😂”\n\n—JEANETTE\n\n“This story makes one feel like being wrapped up in a warm cozy blanket of love. It slowly takes you through this very real woman’s journey of loss, discovery and ultimately find her happiness. Loved every word of it!!”\n\n—JULIE\n\n“There’s just something about a Katherine Center book. I’m not sure if it’s how she develops the characters and their eventual romance in spite of their hardships or how real they seem, but this is the second book of hers that I’ve just adored. I can’t wait to read more of them.”\n\n—ANN\n\n“Center’s novels are light and fun, but they run surprisingly deep and are emotionally wise.”\n\n—AMEERAH\n\n“Amazing. There are so many fantastic messages in this book. Life, death, love, hate, forgiveness all rolled into one book. It’s simply amazing. Highly recommended.”\n\n—BRYNN\n\n“This was such a GREAT BOOK! It just has a little bit of everything…and was so well-written. It is such a mysterious and heartwarming story.”\n\n—MONICA\n\n“Fabulous! Made me smile and keep smiling.”\n\n—DOROTHY\n\n“I absolutely loved this book! I cried several times ~ happy tears! I’ve never cried reading about someone cutting hair. It was such a sweet and tender moment. I feel in love with Katherine Center’s How To Walk Away. I decided to read this one when I found out it was being made into a movie. I plan to read the rest of her books. This one was beautiful!”\n\n—ELIZABETH\n\n“Every time I read one of Center’s books, I’m convinced it’s the best thing she’s written, and then the next one comes out and it’s the best thing she’s ever written. She grabs you with the first line and never lets go.”\n\n—E. LATSHAW\n\n“BEST EVERRRR!!!!”\n\n—AURELIE\n\n“Sometimes you read a book that’s exactly what you need even if you didn’t know it. Katherine Center always seems to know exactly what I need. A heartwarming story of how losing it all sometimes leads to finding more than we imagined possible. Well-written, touching and, most importantly, imperfect characters make this story a must read.”\n\n—MELISSA\n\n“I wasn’t expecting to like this book as much as I did, but I read it in 12 hours. It was an incredibly heartwarming story, one that you finish and immediately feel your heart lifted.”\n\n—JEN\n\n“All of Center’s books are so lovely. Honest, real, and very touching. This was another good one for me.”\n\n—SAMANTHA\n\n“I loved this book, more than I expected, I like it when that happens. I slowed my reading down so that I could enjoy the beautiful prose and imagery. I could really feel Libby’s pain and her feeling of loss and her sense of self as the book went on. I enjoyed it so much I am now going to read this author’s other novels.”\n\n—EMMA\n\n“Loved every minute of it!”\n\n—SHERYL\n\n“Katherine Center has the extraordinary ability to place her characters in the most difficult situations, and then weave a tale that is filled with heart and humor, turning a sad story into one that is incredibly uplifting . . . This wonderful book is poignant and funny…a story of resilience, bravery and how sometimes imperfection and loss can somehow make our lives better.”\n\n—SUSAN\n\n“Such a great book. . . . I couldn’t put it down and finished it in 2 days.”\n\n—STEPHANIE\n\n“I have now read all of Katherine Center’s books to date. I loved this one as much as the others. Her characters are so relatable and the story is so realistic. You feel like you’re right there living through the story with them.”\n\n—JILL\n\n“Definitely one of the sweetest, heartwarming love stories out there!”\n\n—LORELEI\n\n“This is my third book to read of Katherine Center’s and she’s three for three.”\n\n—STEPHANIE\n\n“What a great, curl up under a blanket with a warm cup of tea this read was! I thoroughly enjoyed The Lost Husband by Katherine Pannill Center and recommend it to readers who love what I call `a cozy great book.'”\n\n—JULIE\n\n“I adore Katherine Center . . . Her stories seem to have a way of providing comfort. The characters feel familiar but not in that overdone way, they remind me of people that I could be friends with or would want to get to know better. The Lost Husband hooked me in right away, this is a story of learning how to navigate a new path in life that’s different from where you thought you were headed, it’s about embracing not only the positive or happy moments but also acknowledging that the detours helped to shape who you are and if embraced can lead to something wonderful.”\n\n—THERESA\n\n“Great book about rediscovering who you are; quick and wholesome read. Perfect ending.”\n\n—BRITTANY\n\n“I think this close second to How to Walk Away. It was heart warming and inspiring. I loved to see how each of the characters grew, became stronger, overcame obstacles. I didn’t want the book to end.” ❤📚\n\n—BRIANNA\n\n“I loved this book so much.”\n\n—SANDRA\n\n“This was the most delicious beach-read I have indulged in for a long time. What a decadent little read. Thoroughly enjoyable.”\n\n—ELLE\n\n“I loved everything about The Lost Husband and it solidified Katherine Center as one of my favorite authors. There are lines in this book that I know I will remember, refer to and reread again and again. The Lost Husband is going on my “keep” bookshelf right next to her three previous books.”\n\n—KRISTIN\n\n“Five stars. Everybody needs an Aunt Jean; someone to love them always.”\n\n—JULIE\n\n“Another fantastic book by Katherine Center. Man I love this lady’s writing! Her dialogue alone is awesome. She’s become one of my new favorite authors and I’ll keep reading her books. Check her out!”\n\n—ERIN\n\n“I’m a big Katherine Center fan, and this book is one of my favorites of hers. The concept of finding healing in the country on a farm with animals is something I believe in 100%, and aunt Jean is the kind of woman I aspire to be. It’s all about living the simple life! I love how Katherine Center’s characters have to face devastating losses—like Libby’s loss of her husband—and shows how we can get over the unthinkable. She describes with warmth and humor how resilient we really are, and that we are stronger than we think.”\n\n—MIRIAM\n\n“She is most definitely my new favorite author!!”\n\n—KATHY\n\n“Another great story by this author! I just loved it!!!!”\n\n—KAREN\n\n“My goodness, I just love Katherine Center’s books. ❤️ Always heartwarming and about growing in life, usually with a little romance. Thanks for another great book!”\n\n—JENNIFER\n\n“Do yourself a favor and get this one . . . Katherine Center is a wonderful writer. I started this at bedtime and read until I was done. Boom. She hits a dozen sweet spots from family dynamics, including a beautiful twist, and parenting kids to all the classics about love and loss. This one leaves you feeling like you have been in the hands of a master romance writer. I plan to go on a KC binge. Can’t pay a higher compliment than that.“\n\n—CATHERINE\n\n“This might be my new favorite book by a new favorite author. I couldn’t wait to finish it, but at the same time I didn’t want it to end.”\n\n—CARRIE\n\n“This is a sweet tale of new beginnings, hope, motherhood, angst, family secrets, romance, and the goodness of life. If that doesn’t get you weeping in your pillow, well I don’t know what will. The reason this is one of my favorite authors is, she infuses me with hope … not a moment too soon. I always feel like my best friend is telling me a story when I read her books.”\n\n—CLODA\n\n“She is most definitely my new favorite author!!”\n\n—KATHY\n\n“The more I read Katherine Center’s books, the more I am enamored by her fantastic story telling abilities and her writing that just pulls you in from the first page.”\n\n—ANNE\n\n“This book just makes you feel GOOD!! I think I may have found a new fav author to add to the top my list!! The Lost Husband is the 2nd book I’ve read by her. Her style of writing in my opinion is like a friendship, a friend who shares “all the things.” I also love how she adds in a bit of counseling/social work like material in her books that makes me connect with the characters within a chapter or two!”\n\n—HEATHER\n\n“Fabulous story of family, motherhood and finding happiness in the most unlikely places. Currently being filmed and will star Leslie Bibb and Josh Duhamel. Pick up a copy of this sweet novel before it comes out!”\n\n—KAREN\n\n“Great, fast read!! I just couldn’t put this book down. It was exactly what I was looking for this summer!! I highly recommend this novel. Actually, I might have to read it again.”\n\n—A. C.\n\n“Loved every bit of this book!”\n\n—AMBER KAY\n\n“Katherine Center books are always a vacation. The perfect little getaway for your brain to cleanse and decompress from the struggles of life. The Lost Husband is no different. It is sweet, funny and perfect.”\n\n—HANNAH\n\n“This book is so fun to read. There is just the perfect amount of heartache and healing to make you love Libby and her two kids while letting you realize along with Libby that life is about living.”\n\n—ALRASTI\n\n“Katherine Center is a wonderful writer. Every novel she writes is a gem! You will connect with the main character who finds herself a widow too early in life. She is invited to live and work at her aunt’s farm. She learns a lot from her aunt who is a wise woman. I want to be the wild hippy aunt. Center’s characters remind me of Maeve Binchy’s strong characters. When you start the book, you can’t put it down.”\n\n—ELLEN\n\n“Beautiful, perceptive, wise, thought provoking and satisfying. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.”\n\n—JACKIE\n\n“Sometimes you read a book that’s exactly what you need even if you didn’t know it. Katherine Center always seems to know exactly what I need. A heartwarming story of how losing it all sometimes leads to finding more than we imagined possible. Well-written, touching and, most importantly, imperfect characters make this story a must read.”\n\n—MELISSA\n\n“This book reads like poetry. The words take on a meaning that speaks into your life. It’s not the perfect romance, but instead it is the romance and truth of life. It is a novel that takes on the character of life and its story. I was sad to finish it!”\n\n—TAMMY\n\n“Uplifting, insightful, hopeful. Romantic, loving and a very enjoyable easy read.”\n\n—GLENDA\n\n“A super quick read because you won’t want to put it down. A cute story. I can’t wait to go read another by this author. Two thumbs up! Literally read it start to finish in one sitting.”\n\n—STEFFI\n\n“Katherine Center’s fourth novel creates a warm, wonderful world that you want to enter and stay in for a while. You won’t want to put this story down once you start, and Center’s storytelling voice is familiar and accessible such that you feel like you are sitting across the table from your best friend and sharing secrets over your daily morning coffee. I could easily relate to the theme about creating the family you want and making the best of the situation you are in. Cheers to Center for creating another beautiful storyline and set of characters that will stick with you—this is a must-have for your summer reading list.”\n\n—BRYN\n\n“This was the kind of book you pick up and can’t put down! One of the best books I’ve ever read, it’s a definite must read!”\n\n—KHRYSTIE\n\n“Life lessons we all experience are woven throughout this novel in such a way, you simply want to keep reading as the characters could be you. You feel connected with emotions surfacing, knowing your own life is validated.”\n\n—POLLY\n\n“Great character development in all of the books by this author. She makes you cry & laugh at the same time.”\n\n—VICKI\n\n“This was my first Katherine Center book, and I adored it. . . . This is about overcoming the trials of life, but one that leaves you inspired rather than depressed. I adored the setting (a goat farm) and wanted to milk goats with the characters (especially Jean). I saw that this book has been optioned as a movie. Oh, I do hope! I’ve found a new favorite author.”\n\n—A. LANIER\n\n“Cute love story. Libby and O’Connor are great characters! This is the last book of Katherine Center that I read. They are all amazing!”\n\n—ALLISON\n\n“I’ve been wanting to read this one since starting to go through Katherine Center’s backlist last year, but it has taken me a little bit. However, with the news of it being turned into a movie next year (eek! So much excitement!!!), I finally made time and I’m SO glad I did. It was such a delight! Katherine Center is the QUEEN of heartwarming! Time and time again, I’ve read the last page of one of her books and thought, ‘How does she do this every time?”’\n\n—CHIRSANN\n\n“I really enjoyed this book. It was one of those books that you just can’t put down.”\n\n—HALEY\n\n“Beautifully written, characters you care about, a joy to read. A happy ending that comes from really living life despite its imperfections—and yours.”\n\n—ELLEN\n\n“I can’t believe how much I loved this book! I didn’t expect to but there was just something about the story and the characters . . . I couldn’t put it down.”\n\n—KATE\n\n“I couldn’t put this one down.”\n\n—BARB\n\n“This is the 3rd book I’ve read by Katherine Center and I have yet to be disappointed. She has relatable, likable, and interesting characters, a lot of words of wisdom throughout, insightful reflections that I don’t usually find in books, and every book of hers I’ve read so far throws in a slow burning romance. Life on a goat farm with no TV/Internet seems delightful!”\n\n—ERIKA\n\n“Really loved the stories and characters. A perfect read to chase away the blahs!”\n\n—CATHERINE\n\n“I so enjoyed this book. I love the perfectly imperfect characters. Page after page, I couldn’t put it down. I just kept wanting to discover what would happen next! I’m such a fan of Katherine Center and looking forward to evermore!”\n\n—SG\n\n“The Lost Husband is about bravery, resilience, and love. The book could be sappy or, worse, maudlin, but Katherine Center’s writing is so perfect that I feel as though I’ve lost my new friends because I’ve finished.”\n\n—GUIDA\n\n“This book is so wonderful—I read it in two days and was immersed in this wonderful world so completely I didn’t want to come up to breathe. Have never read any of Center’s books before—and she reminds me a little of Elizabeth Berg in that she finds a way to put words to the wordless emotions we all have—the fleeting and enduring feelings that swim around in us that we don’t always feel fully because there are no words. Loved this book and have promptly ordered every one of her other books!”\n\n—CHARISSE\n\n“The central plot is charming, the characters are flawed to perfection, and the undercurrent of happiness as a choice is like a tonic!”\n\n—SUSAN\n\n“I simply am so glad to have seen this author recommended in one of my reader groups! I have read three by her so far and can not stop! . . . A great read that had me laughing and made me happy!”\n\n—DEBBIE\n\n“Get your iced tea ready and send the kids out on play dates because you are going to want to sit a spell and read this book through without interruption. Center has crafted a charmer, introducing likeable, engaging and totally believable characters. There is a lot of real wisdom here, if you choose to ponder it, about living life bravely and authentically, facing challenges, growing from setbacks and taking chances. But if you’d rather just have a fun summer read that will make you laugh and cry out, “Yeah, that’s so true!”, then this is still the book for you. Just make sure you have that iced tea ready.”\n\n—MARIA\n\n“Exactly what I needed to hear.”\n\n—SUSANNAH\n\n“Katherine Center never disappoints.”\n\n—PAT\n\n“It’s an utterly delightful novel about starting over and coming to terms with the fact that life rarely delivers what’s promised while at the same time delivering something just as good if not better.”\n\n—JESSICA\n\n“The Lost Husband” is a story about loss, love and love but most of all it is a beautiful story of a mother dedicated to raising her children in spite of tragedy and challenges. I dare you to put it down!”\n\n—BETH\n\n“This book is absolutely wonderful! It pulled me in so hard I finished it in just a few days – and I almost never finish a book unless I’m on vacation! It has a very endearing story, and is a great balance between being a fun read and also being meaningful and thought-provoking. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of this author’s books and this may be the most captivating yet—which is saying a lot. I can’t wait for her next book!”\n\n—MIMI\n\n“I adored this book and Katherine Center is now an author forever on my TBR list.”\n\n—CYNTHIA\n\n“I love how every one of Katherine Center’s books have an obstacle that feels life ending, but somehow she makes the happy ending seem not so much like a foregone conclusion but more like a journey that was earned.”\n\n—SAMI\n\n“Katherine Center has a real gift for storytelling and I am looking forward to reading many more of her books in the future.”\n\n—MONICA\n\n“Center’s writing style is clean and breezy but smart, it will keep you intrigued without bogging you down. Next best thing to having coffee with your best friend. I highly recommnd this book!”\n\n—LISA\n\n“I loved this book. Honestly, it was pitch perfect. The characters were real and endearing, and struck just the right balance of depth and humor. In fact, I was surprised at how funny they were! I loved their wit, and I appreciated that they weren’t predictable. The story kept me engaged and content. I finished the book in an afternoon–which meant I ignored my two kids for a day, but it was worth it! (Sorry, guys.) I will definitely be seeking out Center’s other books, hoping they are just as good as this one!”\n\n—LADYBUG\n\n“I think this might be my most favorite Katherine Center book so far!”\n\n—TORI\n\n“I loved this book! I loved every character and had a very hard time stopping to make dinner. I couldn’t wait to get back to the story. So good!!! So so good!”\n\n—DENEEN\n\n“Just a pretty flawless lovely summer reading experience for me!”\n\n—PATTY\n\n“Katherine Center is a writer you can count on to give you a story that will stay with you. Her new book, The Lost Husband, is a sweet, charming tale about beginning again. I love how she makes you fall in love with the characters and even makes owning a herd of goats look like a grand idea. Her books completely capture motherhood, with dazzling moments of humor and heartbreak. Reading her books is like sitting at the kitchen table, basking in a ray of sunshine.”\n\n—JANE\n\n“I think this close second to How to Walk Away. It was heart warming and inspiring. I loved to see how each of the characters grew, became stronger, overcame obstacles. I didn’t want the book to end. ❤📚”\n\n—BRIANNA\n\n“A poignant look at motherhood, grief and complex family dynamics. I love Center’s way of writing with a blend of humor and reality and beautiful surroundings. I definitely recommend this story.“\n\n—SHERI\n\n“Few “women’s fiction” writers hold my attention like this author! Few make me feel giddy and grinning like this author! Few have me burning the midnight oil like this author! Few have this author’s talent! . . . So with as much enthusiasm as I can muster, I highly recommend this family oriented/romantic story with completely endearing characters.”\n\n—K.A.S.\n\n“I loved this book a lot. I just love Katherine Center’s writing style and characters.”\n\n—KASSY\n\n“I couldn’t possibly love this book any more. It is the perfect realistic love story. I laughed out loud, I cried real tears. As a mother with a husband whom I adore, this book resonated with me in so many ways. Katherine Center has such a familiar voice that is present in all 3 books that I’ve now read of hers. She has a unique way of making her characters realistic and relatable, even when they don’t resemble anyone you’ve ever encountered in real life. The Lost Husband is a quick read, and highly recommended!”\n\n—MIRANDA\n\n“I don’t think I have words to adequately talk about how amazing this book is! It’s been a long time since I’ve read such a great story with characters that I felt like I was experiencing life with!! I LOVED the entire story and I want an Aunt Jean and I want to be Aunt Jean!!!”\n\n—PAM\n\n“Another great book by Katherine Center.”\n\n—JANET\n\n“Loved this book and didn’t want it to end!”\n\n—LAURA\n\n“I am in LOVE with this book. Such a character driven story with life lessons throughout. I loved the messages, I loved the characters, I loved the humor, I loved the writing, I loved it all. This is my third Katherine Center book and she has delivered every single time. She has quickly climbed to one of my favorite authors.”\n\n—JOANNE\n\n“I read this in a couple of days, and it delivered exactly the mixture of real-life romance, humor, heartbreak and glimpses into human nature that I’ve come to expect from Katherine Center.”\n\n—MONETTE\n\n“I loved this book! I recently discovered Katherine Center and cannot read enough of her books. She’s a brilliant story teller who creates characters with heart and soul. Beautiful story.”\n\n—BARBARA\n\n“Katherine Center has become one of my favorite authors. Her novels are smart, compelling, and captivating.”\n\n—KATIE\n\n“Another book by Katherine Center that I couldn’t put down. She has a way of capturing my attention in the first pages and does not disappoint!! Loved this book!”\n\n—CONNIE\n\n“LOVE, love, love Katherine Center’s writing!! Her characters are so real – and engaging. I just loved Libby and Abby and Tank and Jean and Sunshine… and, of course, O’Connor! Her voice draws me in and doesn’t let go… and I very much respond to her humor, as well! Can’t wait to read another of her novels. I will definitely see the movie version of The Lost Husband.”\n\n—ROBIN\n\n“A must read for sure!”\n\n—PATRICIA\n\n“I really love Katherine Centers writing. Captures me in the first page and gives me a happy feeling when it’s done!!”\n\n—BETH\n\n“This book was absolutely enjoyable to read. I laughed throughout the story! And could completely relate to Libby’s hilarious helicopter parenting! It was such a sweet, feel good book!”\n\n—TRACEY\n\n“Have you ever read a book where you just feel GOOD about life when you are finished? I really think that The Lost Husband is a “feel-good” kind of book . . . A sweet, tender, feel-good kind of read. I found myself enjoying the farm and Libby and Aunt Jean so much that I did not want the story to end.”\n\n—CHARLOTTE\n\n“I loved this book…Read it in 2 days…..Katherine Center is my new go to for a relaxing, interesting, multi-layered story to keep me absorbed and entertained.”\n\n—DOTTIE\n\n“Wow, what a tough and endearing and real-life story. All that about being a parent and being a child and accepting oneself and forgiving and feeling strong after having to be brave — awesome writing and insight.”\n\n—MELISSA\n\n“I recently discovered this author by chance, but I, in two books, I have definitely come to adore her. I do not tend toward light reading generally, but I was in the mood for something sweet and I found just the right thing. Katherine Center’s books read like your best romantic comedy films. Sweet, funny, and hopeful.”\n\n—MICHELLE\n\nSaveSave"
