You inspired me. :)\n\nWhoever it was that told me I had to watch Spider Lilies as part of my Quest to Watch Every Lesbian Movie Ever, Including the Bad Ones (I'm Looking at YOU, Claire of the Moon) is my hero. Spider Lilies was AMAZING. It might actually be one of my favorite lesbian movies I've ever seen, and you can tell from the following list that I've seen a lot of them. Perhaps too many. :)\n\nLoving Annabelle - loved it; a very sad and beautiful story\n\nFingersmith - a long one, but amazing and totally worth the wait\n\nImagine Me & You - cemented my crushes on both Lena Headey and Piper Perabo, plus a great ending\n\nGray Matters - meh; it made me crazy with Bridget Moynahan and Heather Graham, but I didn't like the ending\n\nPuccini For Beginners - as lesbian/straight girl/straight guy triangle movies go, this one is better than average; certainly worth a look\n\nKissing Jessica Stein - just like revolos55 said, this movie is awesome until the very last 10 minutes...\n\nThe Children's Hour - holy crap, demeter94, I'm so happy I'm not the only one who has seen this movie! Audrey and Shirley are very intense, and what a shocker this film turned out to be!\n\nDesert Hearts - it definitely wasn't bad; something about it made me feel weird and uncomfortable, but I don't know what; still a good movie as lesbian movies go\n\nMy Summer of Love - lots of lesbian content, but this movie just creeped me out\n\nThe Hours - I thought it was slow and heavy, but at least Julianne Moore was in it\n\nBut I'm a Cheerleader - HYSTERICAL, and extremely enjoyable\n\nAll Over Me - one of those frustrating, depressing movies that makes you feel unhappy and helpless most of the time, but that might have just been me; an early appearance by Leisha Hailey of The L Word\n\nThe Truth About Jane - for a Lifetime movie, this was pretty good, and I love Ellen Muth\n\nBound - I couldn't really enjoy this one because it was so...ugly, if that's even the right word for it\n\nClaire of the Moon - horribly written, acted, shot, etc. It makes me grimace to even think of it.\n\nIt's In the Water - another Nicole Conn film, and this one is better that Claire of the Moon, but not the best I've ever seen by a long shot\n\nA Girl Thing - okay, I confess that the only reason I liked this miniseries is because of Elle Macpherson (HOT), and it's really not that badly done\n\nFried Green Tomatoes - subtext, my ass; Idgie/Ruth is TEXT in Fannie Flagg's novel, and that's what makes this movie so great\n\nBetween Two Women - a subtle film about post-WWII British women; it was a little too subtle for my tastes, but still an incredibly intense and nuanced film\n\nHeavenly Creatures - lots of slightly scary lesbian content that makes my skin crawl, but it's supposed to be that way\n\nDr. T and the Women - because the gay part is marginal, I didn't put this on the list at first, but I have to say that Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler making out is a beautiful sight\n\nD.E.B.S. - Funny, silly, entertaining, and incredibly hot couple involving Jordanna Brewster. YES.\n\nSaving Face - I love this movie. It was funny and sensitive, and the ending was great. The girls are cute, too. :)\n\nTipping the Velvet - I'm glad I saw this. It was long, but sooooo good. I might be a little bit in love with Flo. But just like Fingersmith, excellent Sarah Waters adaptation.\n\nAimee and Jaguar - I was only so-so about this one. Not sure why, especially given my obsession with studying WWII and the Holocaust. Something about the chemistry between Aimee and Jaguar didn't resonate with me.\n\nSpider Lilies - OH MY GOD. Zero Chou is my favorite. This movie was so AWESOME, and every time I think about the love scene, my stomach gets all wibbly feeling. GUH.\n\nWhen Night is Falling - Beautiful, beautiful film. Great chemistry between the two main female characters.\n\nHigh Art - I would have liked it better if it weren't for all the drug use. Drugs don't fly with me. But hey, Radha Mitchell is cool. :)\n\nNina's Heavenly Delights You win, anomalys. You seriously, seriously win. Along with Spider Lilies, Loving Annabelle, Imagine Me & You, and Fingersmith, this is in my Top 5 Favorite Lesbian Movies So Far. Funny, clever, sweet, cute--I could go on. You should know that I am now officially in love with Shelley Conn. *thud*\n\nFire - Stunning. Absolutely stunning. Charged with passion and social criticism.\n\nLove & Suicide - This is a very low budget, low production quality indie film, but it's pretty decently acted and written, and it has a very long, very effective, very moving love scene. So good I watched the love scene about six times in a row.\n\nAmour de Femme - French movie, awesome chemistry between female leads, but the story is one of those 'married straight woman is torn between two alternatives' movies. And those depress me. :(\n\nWater Lilies - As soon as you mentioned it so_wicked I remembered that I saw it several months ago, even discussed it here. Despite being frustrated, I love this movie.\n\nPersonal Best - SO ANNOYING. I hated it. I don't care that it's like some kind of pillar of lesbian film or something. I did not enjoy it. Bleh.\n\nThe Secrets - OMFG, The Secrets. Apparently I too have a thing for hot Jews, pocabomba. This movie was so heartbreaking and beautiful. It's definitely one I want to own eventually.\n\nTherese and Isabelle - A kind of experimental movie from 1968. Roommates at an all girls Catholic boarding school. Tragic lesbian romance ensues. Great acting. Okay movie.\n\nGoldfish Memory - DO NOT WANT. It started out well, then ended horribly. Kind of. I had an objection to one character in particular who landed at the center of the lesbian content and who pissed me off because she was a hypocrite.\n\nMovies I've still not seen:\n\nLost and Delirious\n\nBetter than Chocolate\n\nGia\n\nWhat's Cooking?\n\nI Can't Think Straight\n\nKiss Me Again\n\nI LOVE FEMSLASH!!2#!2$3!!!1!\n\nSorry, got carried away.\n\nIn closing, I hope you all have been watching the new season of Criminal Minds. Emily Prentiss no longer has bangs because she gave them to JJ. And everyone? The Emily/JJ is BACK. Not only the lingering gazes and occasional noteworthy proximity, but in the latest episode there was KNEE TOUCHING AND CUP OF COFFEE GETTING. JJ had a rough time on the case, and she seems kind of broody on the plane ride back. Then Emily comes over, puts a mug of some comforting hot beverage down on the table in front of JJ, puts down her own mug, and reaches over to pat/rub/touch JJ's knee before sitting down next to her. They don't speak; they don't need to. JJ just smiles gratefully and they sit quietly next to each other. It's back, y'all. Whatever JJ's pregnancy last season drove away, it's BACK. I could die of the squee. :)"
