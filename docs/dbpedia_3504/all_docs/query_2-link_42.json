        "text": "Since I started writing at Autostraddle four years ago, the possibility of naming 250 lesbian movies has gone from a dream to an inevitability. Every year dozens of new LGBTQ+ films are made and every year at least a handful of classics are unearthed. Never in the history of movies have our stories been told in such quantity or with such variety.\n\nThis increase in media led us to double our Best Lesbian, Bisexual, and Queer Movies of All Time list to 200 when I revamped it back in 2020. But with every passing year, every passing update, the list was begging to break out of those limitations. Not even 200 was enough. And when a list gets to be that length the ranking can feel silly — especially when I’m the only one in the voting body who is able to see all the eligible films. That’s why this year we cut our ranked all time list down to the best of the best — just 50 films representing the peak of sapphic cinema. We have then supplemented it with this gargantuan encyclopedia. It currently includes 250 LGBTQ+ films but it’s sure to grow.\n\nThis is not a list of every lesbian, bisexual, or queer movie of all time. It represents only the best feature length narrative films as voted on by our team and myself. Each film has been assigned a loose rating out of four stars — and you’ll notice no film included on this list has less than two and a half.\n\nIt’s possible there are LGBTQ+ films you love, not included here. Maybe we haven’t seen them yet or maybe they just didn’t get a high enough rating. Feel free to keep advocating for your faves, because titles such as Happiest Season and Wild Things didn’t get a high enough score in past years, but made it this year. Our team is ever-changing — and our individual opinions change too.\n\nThis list does not include films about trans men (e.g. Boys Don’t Cry, By Hook or By Crook), films about trans women exclusively interested in men (e.g. Tangerine, A Fantastic Woman), films based on queer books that had their explicit queerness removed (e.g. The Color Purple, Fried Green Tomatoes), or films where the queerness is just subtext (e.g. A League of Their Own, Rebecca). This list also doesn’t include short films, documentaries, or porn — with a handful of exceptions where length/genre lines were blurred. This update was already an enormous undertaking, but my dream is the boundaries of this list will expand in future years to include more of these categories. Any lesbian cinema list without filmmakers such as Barbara Hammer and Jenni Olson will always feel incomplete.\n\nThe headlines says “Lesbian Cinema,” but for us that means any movie with a woman or non-binary person interested romantically or sexually in another woman or non-binary person.\n\nOne last note: There is lesbian cinema on this list not currently available to stream. Some of the greatest works of LGBTQ+ film are not being watched, because people not within our community get to decide which films deserve attention. Many titles on this list were included because I contacted production companies and producers, attended rare screenings, and hunted for DVDs at actual video stores. And still some films — most notably Me siento extraña (1977) — were not included because no one on our team was able to access them.\n\nThere is a world of cinema and a world of queer cinema and there are films from the last hundred years waiting to be discovered. But hey, we’ll keep searching for lost lesbian classics, the industry will keep making more films that include us, and in the meantime why not start with this little ol’ list of TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY movies? By the time you watch them all, we promise there will be more.\n\n8 Women\n\ndir. François Ozon, 2002\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: mystery, musical // Rating: ★★★\n\nThe influence of queer icon Jacques Demy is felt in this murder mystery farce that’s like musical Clue but entirely women and French. Très très Français. This movie feels gay and then it gets explicitly gay and then it gets explicitly gayer. By the end it’s unclear if anyone is straight! The entire cast is perfect and charming — especially Firmine Richard who gets a sad gay ballad and Catherine Denueve whose commitment to playing queer women despite suing Deneuve Magazine is ever surprising.\n\nAdam\n\ndir. Rhys Ernst, 2019\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWhile it stirred controversy before it was even released, award-winning trans filmmaker Rhys Ernst’s debut feature is surprisingly low-key and deeply queer. Based on The L Word writer Ariel Schrag’s even more controversial book, this 2006-set coming-of-age tale takes an original approach to queer storytelling. Many films on this list focus on a queer protagonist navigating a cishet world, but this is the rare film with a cishet protagonist navigating a queer world. The film largely focuses on trans men — including a stand-out performance from Leo Sheng — but it is filled with queer women. It’s as much about bisexuality as it is about transness as several queer women question what it means to date transmasculin individuals as lesbian-identified people in a binary community. It’s a thought-provoking work of art that deserves to be seen before it’s judged. It’s also the only film on this list to feature a butch trans woman — played with a sexy bravado by newcomer Dana Levinson.\n\nAfternoon Breezes\n\ndir. Hitoshi Yazaki, 1980\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWhen Natsuko’s crush is too busy spending her birthday with her boyfriend to accept Natsuko’s gift of a Virgo necklace, Natsuko eats an entire bouquet of roses and then throws it up. That’s how this movie begins. But despite its truly jaw-dropping twists and turns, Hitoshi Yazaki’s tale of lesbian obsession is at its best in its quiet moments. Setsuko Aya’s performance as Natsuko creates humanity where some might find crazy. This is as much a movie about depression as it is about toxic love. Natsuko feels isolated from the straight people around her and from herself — latching onto this ostensibly straight woman is just her way of expressing (or avoiding) that isolation. This is a difficult movie, but there’s so much beauty in even its saddest moments.\n\nAftersun\n\ndir. Charlotte Wells, 2022\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nExactly what Charlotte Wells is doing in her feature debut remains elusive for most of the film’s runtime. The mix of camcorder footage and patient 35mm cinematography. The hazy combination of past and present and an imagined third space somewhere in between. So much of the movie feels casual — a father and his twelve year old daughter on vacation, a slice of life in Turkey — its bold strokes seem incidental. Until they don’t. This is the rare coming-of-age movie about a queer kid who doesn’t yet understand that queerness. Her self-discovery we witness is not first love — it’s deeper knowledge of her parent and therefore half of her herself. This results in a story of queer youth unlike anything we’ve ever seen.\n\nAimée & Jaguar\n\ndir. Max Farberbock, 1999\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nThis is very much a classic Holocaust-era period drama both formally and in structure. But there’s a certain pleasure to watching that kind of respected, serious film with the focus turned to a lesbian love story. The oppression of queerness is often left out of stories from this era and this is a welcome change. Maria Schrader gives an all-time magnetic performance as Felice, a woman so brave she’d risk being killed by Nazis to escape lesbian bed death.\n\nAlice Júnior\n\ndir. Gil Baroni, 2019\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 83 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nAll About My Mother\n\ndir. Pedro Almodóvar, 1999\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 96 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nAll Over Me\n\ndir. Alex Sichel, 1997\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 33 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nAnaïs in Love\n\ndir. Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet, 2021\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nAnaïs is the latest in a recent line of anti-heroines who are far better at fucking the wrong people than getting a job. Call it millennial malaise, call it burnout, call it an annoying expression of privilege, but there’s a reason this character keeps popping up in fiction. And this film is among the best — and gayest — of the genre. More tonally in-line with Old Hollywood screwball and Éric Rohmer comedies than recent dramedy, this film stands out by reflecting the reality of its protagonist’s way of life without punishing her. Plenty of people live selfishly in ways that don’t bring them this level of pleasure. Plenty of people go through life contributing even less than Anaïs without even feeling joy. Maybe we could all learn something from this chaotic bisexual’s insatiable lust for life — either way it sure is fun to watch.\n\nAnnihilation\n\ndir. Alex Garland, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: sci-fi, horror // Rating: ★★★\n\nBeautiful and horrifying, depending on the moment, depending on your perspective, Alex Garland’s haunting sci-fi film is visceral and thought-provoking. A group of women venture into a mysterious zone called the Shimmer where the laws of science seem not to apply. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tessa Thompson are joined by Gina Rodriguez as a soft butch with an undercut, and every lesbian’s favorite cishet man Oscar Isaac. The film is light on lesbian content — the only romantic relationship focused on is between Portman and Isaac — but science fiction is a genre we’re almost always excluded from so this film is noteworthy not only for centering women, but explicitly including a gay woman in the narrative.\n\nAnother Way\n\ndir. Karoly Makk, Janos Xantus, 1982\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, period piece, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nJadwiga Jankowska-Cieslak won the Best Actress award at Cannes for this remarkable film that’s hurt only by its maudlin insistence. Jankowska-Cieslak plays a political journalist in Hungary just after the revolution who begins a relationship with a less radical — and married — writer. They fight to live truthfully, love truthfully, and write truthfully, but the consequences of these transgressions are bleak. It’s a pointed, worthwhile film as long as you prepare yourself for the misery.\n\nAntonia’s Line\n\ndir. Marleen Gorris, 1995\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★\n\nLight on lesbianism but big on feminism, this decades long tale of the fiercely independent Antonia finds room in its utopic female vision for queerness. Antonia’s daughter casually has a love affair with her daughter’s teacher and the teacher being a woman is never a concern. There’s even a short sex scene between the two of them. This Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language film is a tribute to women who chose to be more than expectations — more than simply the wives of men.\n\nAppropriate Behavior\n\ndir. Desiree Akhavan, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 22 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nAtomic Blonde\n\ndir. David Leitch, 2017\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: action // Rating: ★★★\n\nThis proper action movie from one of the directors of John Wick provides the queer Charlize Theron kickass thrill ride of our dreams. It’s impossible to overstate Charlize Theron’s acting or sexiness with Sofia Boutella or the accomplishments of the action choreography. A muddled plot doesn’t really matter when the experience is this great.\n\nAWOL\n\ndir. Deb Shoval, 2016\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nLola Kirke and Breeda Wool give beautiful performances in this melancholy tale of first love in rural America. As the two women try to find a future together, they’re faced with the limitations of their circumstance — caused by homophobia, caused by poverty, caused by the military industrial complex. It’s an at times heartbreaking, at times sexy, and always lived in debut from director Deb Shoval.\n\nBattle of the Sexes\n\ndir. Valerie Faris, Jonathan Dayton, 2017\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: sports, period piece // Rating: ★★★\n\nThe only thing gayer than tennis are haircuts, apparently! Emma Stone stars as Billie Jean King as she faces off against has-been chauvinist Bobby Riggs (Steve Carrell) in the tennis match deemed The Battle of the Sexes. Andrea Riseborough plays King’s hairdresser and eventual girlfriend, and, yes, there is a VERY sexy haircut scene! Haircuts aside, the movie is a sweet, soft feminist sports movie readymade for inspiration. Oh and Alan Cumming plays King’s queer mentor!\n\nBessie\n\ndir. Dee Rees, 2015\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 78 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBetter Than Chocolate\n\ndir. Anne Wheeler, 1999\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nFamous or infamous depending on who you ask, this memorable ensemble comedy about a group of lesbian friends is noteworthy for its silly sex scenes, Ani DiFranco filled soundtrack, and inclusion of a trans woman character. Feminist bookstore, nudity-centric performance art, and sexy body painting are just some of the very lesbian things in this very lesbian movie. It’s not great, but it is ours.\n\nBFFs\n\ndir. Andrew Putschoegl, 2014\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nWith a warm and funny writing from leads Andrea Grano and Tara Karsian, this romcom about two straight best friends who go on a couples retreat only to discover they may have feelings for each other is an absolute delight. The premise lends itself to a lot of great comedy and the movie asks interesting questions about intimacy, sexuality, and friendship.\n\nLes Biches\n\ndir. Claude Chabrol, 1968\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: classics, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nClaude Chabrol’s interest in queer women seems to begin and end with how hot it is to watch us make out — but, to be fair, he’s not wrong. Male gaze abounds in this gender swapped Talented Mr. Ripley, but that doesn’t take away from all its pleasures. Chabrol knows how to make a compelling movie and this is certainly compelling — almost as compelling as actresses Stéphane Audran and Jacqueline Sassard. But be warned: the man takes over as the main love interest for both women.\n\nBirds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn\n\ndir. Cathy Yan, 2020\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: action // Rating: ★★★\n\nFinally after so much subtext, a big budget superhero movie that explicitly includes queer women — in fact, it’s starring one. Cathy Yan’s explosive, misandrist, comic book treat may be light on gay sex and romance, but with a mention of an ex-girlfriend Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn is an on-screen canon bisexual. Add Rosie Perez’s lesbian Renee Montoya and her ex-girlfriend played by Ali Wong and a nice amount of the usual subtext that accompanies a female-led action movie and you’re left with a movie that’s gay by any standard and very gay by a Hollywood standard. Montoya also sets a lovely example for lesbian cops across media by doing the right thing — quitting.\n\nBit\n\ndir. Brad Michael Elmore, 2019\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, horror // Rating: ★★★\n\nThe one and only movie about a trans lesbian joining a lesbian separatist vampire girl gang comes close to living up to its premise. Nicole Maines is incredible as Laurel, charming in moments of awkward romance, and commanding in moments of action. Trans lesbians are still largely absent from the canon of lesbian cinema and this exception is delicious in how casually Laurel is included. Her transness is acknowledged and affects her character and the story, but it doesn’t define her. She also gets an adorable meetcute — that ends with teeth in her neck.\n\nThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant\n\ndir. Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1972\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: classics, drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nGay german auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder was known for his brutality on and off screen and this film is no different. Taking place entirely in the apartment of Petra von Kant, we watch as she treats her assistant Marlene cruelly and falls miserably for model Karin. It’s a cruel movie about cruel women, but the camerawork, costume design, and incredible performances from Margit Carstensen, Hanna Schygulla, and Irm Hermann make it worth it.\n\nBlack Swan\n\ndir. Darren Aronofsky, 2010\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: horror, sports // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNumber 40 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBliss\n\ndir. Henrika Kull, 2021\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nObviously inspired by Lizzie Borden’s Working Girls — more on that later — Henrika Kull’s story of two sex workers in love, trades the hyper-emphasis on the workplace for a greater focus on romance. This is a slow and meandering film, but the performances of Katharina Behrens and Adam Hoya — and their chemistry — keeps it compelling. Thirty-six years after Lizzie Borden’s masterpiece, accurate depictions of sex work are still largely absent from media and this is a welcome return to that low-stakes look at the job as a job.\n\nBlockers\n\ndir. Kay Cannon, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 65 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBlue Gate Crossing\n\ndir. Yee Chih-Yen, 2002\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nWhat begins as a gay Cyrano de Bergerac is complicated when Kerou’s crush’s crush falls for her instead. A love triangle that defers to moments of quiet connection over messy plot dynamics, Yee Chi-Yen’s film is a simple yet moving coming-of-age movie about first love and friendship. The movie is subtle and the power of its emotions may not hit you right away — but days later it just might make your heart swell.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Color\n\ndir. Abdellatif Kechiche, 2013\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nNumber 32 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBlush\n\ndir. Michal Vinik, 2015\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nThis Israeli coming-of-age film draws parallels between protagonist Naama’s burgeoning sexuality and her country’s troublesome politics. While she’s having the usual queer teen experiences of first love, first heartbreak, and first post-heartbreak head shave, she’s also forced to deal with her violent home life and racist father. It’s a tale of intolerance across identities that’s affecting even as it follows familiar beats.\n\nBodies Bodies Bodies\n\ndir. Halina Reijn, 2022\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: horror, comedy // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNumber 98 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBooksmart\n\ndir. Olivia Wilde, 2019\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\n“Last week of high school” teen comedies are an entire subgenre, but it’s rare that they focus on women and even rarer that they focus on queer women. That’s why Olivia Wilde’s debut was such an exciting dose of raunchy humor, female friendship, and adolescent romance. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever are both so good and they are supported by a phenomenal ensemble — especially scene stealer Billie Lourd. Dever’s character is casually queer in a way that wouldn’t have been possible a decade ago and it’s so fun to watch her navigate her crushes and mishaps. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and full of heart, this movie will make you long for a teenagehood you never had and rejoice in a film landscape that’s finally changing.\n\nBorn in Flames\n\ndir. Lizzie Borden, 1983\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: classic, drama, experimental // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 17 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nBound\n\ndir.

Eric Schaeffer, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nOne of the few movies on this list starring a trans woman, Eric Schaeffer’s romcom is the sweet — and messy — love story we deserve. Michelle Hendley is an absolute star as Ricky Jones, a small town girl with a YouTube following and a desire for love. It takes a dalliance with the engaged Francesca to reveal the love she has for her male best friend — and what a dalliance it is! Ricky’s sex scene with Francesca is hot and tender, and while some of us may have been rooting for the two of them to end up together, the whole thing is so sweet you probably won’t mind that she ends up with the friend. And Hendley is just so good — she’s such a pleasure to watch on screen.\n\nBoys On the Side\n\ndir. Herbert Ross, 1995\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhile very 1995 and very obviously written and directed by white men, this post-Thelma and Louise road movie is worthy of reconsideration. Whoopi Goldberg plays Jane, a lesbian who breaks up with her girlfriend and her band and heads across country for a new gig and a new life. She ends up driving with a type-A real estate agent played by Mary-Louise Parker and their initial friction soon gives way to a friendship and something more. Sure, the movie is all over the place — in tone and plot — and Drew Barrymore’s subplot with Matthew McConaughey hurts the film, it’s the chemistry between Goldberg and Parker that provide this film its heart. At a time when most mainstream movies still lived in subtext, this film provided a complex lesbian protagonist to pull at our heart strings.\n\nBreaking the Girls\n\ndir. Jamie Babbit, 2012\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: mystery, thriller // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nA lesbian remake of Strangers on a Train with even more twists and turns, this erotic thriller is certainly delicious. With direction from Jamie Babbit and a script co-written by Guinevere Turner, this has just the right amount of artistry added to its pulp. Recent films have tried to capture the magic of 80s and 90s erotic thrillers, but this film actually does it by doing what those films did best — be hot, be trashy, have sex appeal, have fun.\n\nA Bride for Rip Van Winkle\n\ndir. Shunji Iwai, 2016\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, experimental // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThere is not a minute of this movie where you’ll predict what the next minute holds. But if you give yourself over to Shunji Iwai‘s three-hour dramatic social satire, you’ll experience a strange and beautiful journey. The film begins with the seemingly simple story of a young teacher named Nanami — a singular performance from Haru Kuroki — who is getting ready to marry her boring boyfriend she met online. Embarrassed to not have more family to attend their wedding, she hires actors to pretend. This is just the first of many lies that will be told in this film where reality and fiction are ever-blurred. This is a film filled with tragedy but at its heart is the relationship between Nanami and Mashiro — famous singer Cocco in one of her few acting roles. Who they both are, and who they both are to each other, shifts but their time together lends the film its deepest beauty.\n\nBumblefuck, USA\n\ndir. Aaron Douglas Johnston, 2011\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nPart mumblecore romance, part documentary, this film combines real interviews with the story of a Dutch woman who visits her gay American friend’s small town after he commits suicide. Blaming homophobia for his death, she sets out to learn what it’s like to be gay in this place, but ends up falling in love with a woman and learning firsthand. It’s a lowkey story with some painful turns, but it captures the confused messiness of newly coming out — or dating someone who’s newly coming out.\n\nBut I’m a Cheerleader\n\ndir.

Nadine Labaki, 2007\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nNadine Labaki’s debut directorial work is a romantic comedy about a group of women working in a waxing salon in Beirut. All of the women have different struggles with love — including Rima who is very shy and very gay. It’s a beautiful, funny movie that casually values female emotion in a way we rarely see.\n\nCarmen & Lola\n\ndir. Arantxa Echevarria, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nThere’s an entire subgenre of lesbian movies where two women fall in love and one is overtly gay and the other could fake it through a heterosexual life. But like so many oft-told stories, the repetition of patterns does not inherently imply a lack of ingenuity. Rather, this structure can be used to explore the nuance and specificity of a specific culture and specific characters. Arantxa Echevarria’s Carmen & Lola is just such a film as it focuses on two young Romani women who are being pressured into marriage and struggle to be together instead. Zaira Romero and Rosy Rodríguez play the titular characters and their chemistry further elevates the film. There is an engagement party dance scene that will burn into your memory forever.\n\nCarol\n\ndir.

Milica Tomović, 2021\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★\n\nTaking place entirely at a children’s birthday party, this snapshot of 1993 Belgrade puts a political spin on queer chaos. While the kids dress up as Ninja Turtles, the adults oscillate between heated discussion of current events and even more heated affairs. Yes, this includes a tense love triangle between the birthday girl’s aunt, her leather jacket wearing ex, and the ex’s new young girlfriend. Working on several layers, Milica Tomović creates characters with full enough lives that the drama compels even if the historical relevance is lost on you. But understanding the place and time centers it all the more. Just a bunch of adults acting like children while the society they know falls apart.\n\nCertain Women\n\ndir. Kelly Reichardt, 2016\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 91 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nThe Children’s Hour\n\ndir. William Wyler, 1961\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: classic, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nThis classic of lesbian cinema has a bad reputation due to its influentially tragic ending. But just because the movie is bleak doesn’t mean it isn’t still deserving of praise, reexamination, and even enjoyment. Lillian Hellman’s play is a tragedy in the American theatre tradition and that results in this kind of ending. But before that we get her beautiful writing, complex characters, and dynamic relationships. We get Shirley MacLaine with her pageboy haircut and Audrey Hepburn as her object of desire. This is a masterpiece that paved the way for so many future masterpieces — for better or worse.\n\nThe Chinese Botanist’s Daughter\n\ndir. Dai Sijie, 2006\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nLush and tragic, this is male gaze lesbian melodrama at its finest. The men are abusive, the scenery is gorgeous, and the women are madly in love. Mylène Jampanoï and Xiaoran Li succeed at deepening their simply written character and provide a couple that’s easy to root for even as the plot maddens.\n\nChutney Popcorn\n\ndir.

Leonie Krippendorff, 2020\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nHow much you like Leoni Krippendorff’s lesbian coming-of-age tale about 14-year-old Berliner Nora will likely depend on how much you like lesbian coming-of-age tales in general — and your tolerance for butterfly metaphors. With an urgent, handheld style and dreamy yet realistic tone, Krippendorff’s film is just really beautiful and watchable even as it follows familiar beats. Lena Urzendowsky is excellent as the sad-eyed Nora and Jella Haase is devastating as her crush. This is a beautiful film filled with the kind of panicky intensity that defines early adolescence — and first love.\n\nCodependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same\n\ndir. Madeleine Olnek, 2011\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: sci-fi, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nMadeleine Olnek’s highly relatable comedy about a trio of aliens sent to Earth because they have too many feelings is as funny and weird as that premise suggests. Inspired by low-budget 1950s sci-fi, Olnek’s film has a DIY aesthetic that fits with the often silly script. All of its fish-out-of-water jokes ultimately lead to a story about connection. We all feel like aliens sometimes, but if we’re lucky we just might find another alien to love.\n\nConcussion\n\ndir. Stacie Passon, 2013\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhat begins as a gay twist on the classic story of sex-driven mid-life crise, becomes a deeper exploration of ennui and desire. Despite focusing largely on protagonist Abby’s foray into sex work, the film seems less concerned with representing that profession realistically and more concerned with how the sex (lots and lots and lots of sex!) impacts Abby as a character. Robin Weigert’s performance as Abby anchors the film despite its somewhat silly premise, and Maggie Siff gives a sexy supporting performance as one of Abby’s clients. There’s more to this movie than just the sex, but there is a lot of sex and it’s very well done!\n\nCracks\n\ndir. Jordan Scott, 2009\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: thriller, coming-of-age // Rating: ★★★\n\nTaking its place in the lineage of lesbian films about boarding schools, Jordan Scott’s striking debut feature lands on the side of brutality over eroticism. While Eva Green is arresting as always as the initially charming, eventually horrifying Miss G., the reality of her abuse is allowed to play out. It’s a frightening and effective film with an incredibly talented young cast that includes Juno Temple, Imogen Poots, and María Valverde.\n\nCrush\n\ndir.

Amara Cash, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nAmara Cash’s debut film is a campy, candy-colored, explosion of queerness. A love triangle between aspiring artist Maya, her instagram crush Jasmine, and Jasmine’s sugar daddy, leads to a twisted plot, two twisted romances, and a lot of expected — and unexpected — drama. Cash’s camera and editing is frenetic capturing Maya’s adolescence yearning and building to a new queer aesthetic. The most surprising thing about this movie is its sweetness. There’s an innocence to Maya that’s easy to root for and a sexiness to Jasmine that’s easy to fall for. By pairing the romantic and the taboo, the disturbing and the delicious, Cash creates a truly unique feat of queer filmmaking.\n\nA Date for Mad Mary\n\ndir. Darren Thornton, 2016\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★★\n\nSeána Kerslake makes a difficult character impossible not to love in this unique coming-of-age story. Mary’s discovery of her sexuality threads through every aspect of her self-discovery as she grapples with her recent prison sentence, her best friend’s upcoming wedding, her contempt for her mother, and her new crush. The film balances its subject matter and its tones due to sharp writing and Kerslake’s truly remarkable performance. This is really a gem of a film.\n\nThe Daughters of Fire\n\ndir. Albertina Carri, 2018\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nPorn about making porn questioning how to make porn that’s properly queer and feminist, Albertina Carri’s film succeeds in answering its own question. Poetic and sexy this loosely plotted Argentinian road trip is bound to make you think and come. It’s casual in its inclusivity across body types, gender, and kinks, and ends with one spectacular orgy.\n\nDesert Hearts\n\ndir.

Rick Famuyiwa, 2015\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★\n\nKiersey Clemons plays Diggy, the masc lesbian best friend of Shameik Moore’s Malcolm. They’re geeks and totally unprepared for the drug-deal-induced hijinks that ensue due to Malcolm’s lovesickness over Nakia played by Zoë Kravitz. The script is tight and funny and all of the performances are great. It works as a comedy, a coming-of-age story, and an action movie. Clemons is great as always and her outfits and energy feel authentically queer in a way often absent from mainstream media about teenagers. Also it’s highly relatable to almost ruin your life for Zoë Kravitz.\n\nDos Estaciones\n\ndir. Juan Pablo González, 2022\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nDeliberately paced but never boring, this movie about a butch tequila factory owner and her trans woman hair stylist is a gem. Teresa Sánchez won a special jury prize from Sundance for her performance as the factory owner, Maria Garcia, and it’s easy to see why. Her performance is subtle and arresting, a character created out of moments of quiet. While Sánchez, the other actors, and the stunning cinematography are the primary draw for the film, the film is not lacking in narrative focus. It may be a slow-burn but its unique story is effectively told.\n\nDrifting Flowers\n\ndir. Chou Zero, 2008\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nLesbian filmmaker Chou Zero’s trio of intersecting queer tales are about love, friendship, and identity. As much about gender as it is about sexuality, the film is at its best when focusing on the character Diego played by Chao Yi-lan. In the present Diego is a masc heartthrob, but in the past we see her struggle to define her identity beyond the expectations of woman. It’s a moving film that saves its best section for last.\n\nDrool\n\ndir. Nancy Kissam, 2009\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nAt times delightfully campy, at others rather off-putting, this low-budget comedy stars Girlfriends’ Jill Marie Jones and Mulholland Drive’s Laura Harring as lovers on the run. Kissam has cited John Waters as one of her key inspirations and that’s clear in the boldness of the work and its extremely dark sense of humor. But ultimately the film is rather wholesome as it creates a world where new family structures can arise from abuse.\n\nDry Ground Burning\n\ndir. Joana Pimento, Adirley Queirós, 2022\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, experimental // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nAt once both a documentary about the criminal resistance in Bolsonaro’s Brazil and a dystopic epic about a queer women oil gang, Dry Ground Burning is as mesmerizing as it is indefinable. Real-life sisters Chitarra and Léa play versions of themselves as they grapple with their limited options and the dangers of turning to crime. Some moments feel like a cinema verité portrait of the two women reconnecting after Léa’s six years in prison, other moments feel straight out of an action movie. While hardship is ever-present, the two women still find comfort in family, biological and chosen, as well as some fun nights of queer partying. Reminiscent of Lizzie Borden’s 1983 masterpiece Born in Flames, this is a film with a form as radical as the women at its center.\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy\n\ndir. Peter Strickland, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nNumber 88 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nEmilia\n\ndir. César Sodero, 2020\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nLesbian teachers being inappropriate with students is one of the oldest and most complicated tropes of queer women cinema. Some entries are salacious, some explore the realities of abuse, and some try to do both at once. This film does neither, opting instead for a colder, more observational approach. The titular character is lost in her twenty-something second adolescence ennui and while her emotions don’t justify her repeated bad behavior they do make it compelling to observe. This film works as well as it does because its star Sofia Palomino finds nuance and meaning in every moment. It’s a remarkable central performance you’ll want to watch no matter what Emilia is doing — no matter how sad or uncomfortable it makes you.\n\nEntre Nous\n\ndir. Diane Kurys, 1983\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhile the lesbianism remains implicit, this is still a beautiful movie about love and obligation. Miou-Miou and Isabelle Huppert are heartbreaking as two women whose deep connection pulls them away from the men in their lives. It’s slow and chaste — at least in its queerness — but this delicate film is a tribute to love between women.\n\nEva + Candela\n\ndir. Ruth Caudeli, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nRuth Caudeli’s debut feature is both a devastating breakup film and an announcement of an exciting new talent in queer cinema. Most sad films about queer women are sad due to tragedy or oppression, so it’s a relief to watch a film that’s sad because sustaining a relationship is just really hard! While falling in love and falling out of love, Alejandra Lara and Silvia Varón are brimming with chemistry. It’s painful to watch them fall apart because they make so much sense when they’re together.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n\ndir. Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert, 2022\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, sci-fi, action // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNumber 70 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list.

Read more.\n\nThe Fear Street Trilogy\n\ndir. Leigh Janiak, 2021\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWhat makes The Fear Street Trilogy go from a solid good time to a grand cinematic event is its understanding that intelligence and fun are not antithetical. Like The Slumber Party Massacre Trilogy, Fear Street doesn’t make us choose between campy horror and an engagement with reality. It’s proof that “good politics” are also good storytelling. A lot of slasher movies are about trauma and PTSD but these films go a step further and explore the trauma that can be carried in land and among a community. They are films made by people who know the horror genre and know the horrors that exist in our real world. Together this knowledge results in a trio of movies with more developed characters and more resonate plots than we often see in the genre. This isn’t just horror with queer characters — it’s queer horror. It’s about things that should really scare us — generational trauma and income inequality. Pretty good for a series that also features a devastating kill with a bread slicer.\n\nThe Feels\n\ndir. Jenée LaMarque, 2017\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nConstance Wu playing a lesbian is probably enough of a pitch to get you to watch this breezy Netflix comedy — and it should be! She’s great as always and she has a nice chemistry with co-star Angela Trimbur. The movie is sweet and affirming as it acknowledges how different our bodies function and the necessity for communication during sex. Ever Mainard gives a standout comic performance and provides some much needed butch energy to this gay bachelorette party comedy.\n\nFire\n\ndir. Deepa Mehta, 1996\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nNumber 81 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nThe Firefly\n\ndir. Ana Maria Hermida, 2013\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nA film as much about grief as it is about queer love, Ana Maria Hermida’s debut is about a woman who develops a relationship with her brother’s fiancée in the wake of his death. The two women bond over their shared mourning and shared love and eventually find a way forward together. With magic realist touches and a heavy script, the movie is rich in drama, but it mostly earns its earnest ambitions.\n\nThe First Death of Joana\n\ndir. Cristiane Oliveira, 2021\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nStories of young queers investigating the gay pasts of their relatives is its own subgenre. What is it about these quests that hold so much interest for us in our lives and in fiction? Is it the validation of knowing you’re not the only one? The explanation for why you are the way that you are? The connection to biological family that can become so fraught when coming out in a world that wants you to stay in? As the titular protagonist of Cristiane Oliveira’s beautiful coming-of-age story investigates the life of her late great aunt, she is also investigating herself. It doesn’t really matter what she discovers about this relative. She must learn what so many of us learn — that it really is about the journey.\n\nFirst Girl I Loved\n\ndir. Kerem Sanga, 2016\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nThis coming-of-age drama is as much about consent as it is about queer discovery. Dylan Gelula plays Anne who begins to explore her first lesbian relationship in the aftermath of assault. The film opens itself up to the messiness of the interactions it displays and highlights how our culture’s broken ideas around sex, gender, power, and identity lead to so much pain. It’s a heartfelt, heartbreaking film that still finds time for sweetness. (And it has a great cameo from Cameron Esposito at the end.)\n\nThe Fish Child\n\ndir. Lucia Puenzo, 2009\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nBased on her own novel, Lucia Puenzo’s film is a painful love story about two young queer women separated by race and class. Lala is from a wealthy family and has been having an affair with Ailin, her family’s maid. Their desire to escape pushes them to crime and Lala must face the naïveté of her fantasies while Ailin tries simply to survive. Inés Efron and Mariela Vitale are fantastic and fantastic together and make the film work even when the plot takes some difficult to believe turns.\n\nFlaming Ears\n\ndir. Ursula Pürrer, A. Hans Scheirl, Dietmar Schipek, 1992\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: sci-fi, experimental // Rating: ★★★\n\n“In the year 2700, the year of the toads, Asche was a burnt-out city.” So begins a film that is both a queer artifact of early 90s Austrian cinema and one that still feels daring 30 years later. Despite being shot on super 8, the recent restoration is beautiful — if you can find beauty in punk dystopia. Flaming Ears is about a comic book artist named Spy whose quest for revenge against nymphomaniac/pyromaniac, Volley, gets interrupted when she encounters Volley’s girlfriend, Nun, who happens to be a reptile-obsessed alien in a red latex suit. If that plot summary sounds bonkers, it’s nothing compared to the presentation. This is a true work of avante-garde queer art that features furniture humping, disembodied hands, DIY-looking miniature set pieces, and BDSM sex parties.\n\nForgotten Roads\n\ndir. Nicol Ruiz Benavides, 2020\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance, sci-fi // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThis movie has EVERYTHING. A 70-something lesbian rediscovering her sexuality. Another 70-something lesbian who is married to a man but moonlights as a queer lounge singer. Gays, against all odds, learning how to drive. UFOs. Yes. UFOs. Nicol Ruiz Benavides’ debut film is emotionally accessible and artistically esoteric and that combination makes for an incredible viewing experience. It’s rare to get movies about older queer women — it’s even rarer to get a film about older queer women that takes risks like this film. Lucky for us the risks pay off for a unique and meaningful viewing experience.\n\nThe Four-Faced Liar\n\ndir. Jacob Chase, 2010\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nWritten by and co-starring The L Word: Generation Q showrunner Marja-Lewis Ryan, this is a lowkey dramedy about a group of early twenty-somethings stumbling their way through love. Ryan plays a lesbian who acts just like her straight male bestie and falls for a “straight” girl. As all of their relationships are challenged and reconfigured, the film questions what it is the characters really want and whether they’ll ever find it.\n\nThe Fox\n\ndir. Mark Rydell, 1967\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nOne of the earliest portrayals of a queer women couple on-screen, Mark Rydell’s adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novella of the same name surprises even as it dabbles in tropes. Sandy Dennis and Anne Heywood play Jill and Ellen, two women who live together and raise chickens in a relatively happy partnership. Ellen feels a certain ennui, but Jill’s only concern is the literal fox in their hen house. The metaphor manifests in the arrival of a man named Paul played by Keir Dullea who is terrifying in his determination to split them up. But this poetic, complicated film isn’t the expected 1960s story of a queer woman choosing a man — at least not so simply. The film is as much about gender as it is about sexuality and it deserves a greater reputation as a classic of lesbian cinema due to its performances, its craft, and its commitment to queer complexity in an era where that was so rarely allowed on screen.\n\nFoxfire\n\ndir. Annette Haywood-Carter, 1996\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 55 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nFreak Orlando\n\ndir. Ulrike Ottinger, 1981\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, experimental // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhile Sally Potter’s Tilda Swinton-starring adaptation of the Virginia Woolf classic is a trans cinematic masterpiece, Ulrike Ottinger’s even more unconventional take is a trans masterpiece, a lesbian masterpiece, and a freak masterpiece. Starring Magdalena Montezuma as Orlando and Delphine Seyrig as her subject of desire, this movie told in disjointed, surreal chapters is unlike anything else you’ll ever see. It’s a testament to Ottinger’s skill and creativity that her chaotic vision remains such a delight even when it’s lacking in any logic except her own. Who needs logic when you have a queer gender-bending fantasia?\n\nFresh Kill\n\ndir. Shu Lea Cheang, 1994\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, sci-fi // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWhen we talk about the New Queer Cinema of the 90s, we should talk about Fresh Kill. It’s the exact kind of radical art that defined that movement — just less male and less white. Starring Sarita Choudhury and Erin McCurty as a lesbian couple in Staten Island in an alternate present or near future, the film is a bold critique of capitalism and ecological disaster. Throughout its surreal touches and haywire tangents, its characters live real queer lives. There are so many interesting ideas and stylistic flourishes on display but its the people at its center inhabit these ideas that make it one of the most underrated masterpieces of a decade full of them.\n\nFrida\n\ndir. Julie Taymor, 2002\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nWhile the script is paint-by-numbers Hollywood biopic, this telling of Frida Kahlo’s life is elevated by Julie Taymor’s visual inventiveness and Salma Hayek’s moving performance. The film largely focuses on Kahlo’s relationship with Diego Rivera, but it’s also explicit about her bisexuality with multiple moments of her lusting after or being with women. It doesn’t quite reflect Kahlo’s own unique creativity, but for this genre of movie it’s a success.\n\nGia\n\ndir. Michael Cristofer, 1998\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nNumber 36 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nGirl with Hyacinths\n\ndir. Hasse Ekman, 1950\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: classic, drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nOne of the earliest lesbian movies ever made, this Swedish noir may began with suicide but the central mystery is far more nuanced than how it initially appears. Eve Henning (best known for Ingmar Bergman’s debut Thirst, that has another of cinema’s first lesbian characters) plays Dagmar Brink, a sad and lonely woman whose life comes to a tragic end. Completely alone, she leaves her belongings to her neighbors who begin a Citizen Kane-like quest to learn more about the mystery woman who lived next door and Alex, the supposed love of her life. Now, as we know, Alex is a gay name, so it’s easy for us to guess where they go wrong in assuming Alex is a man. However, the layers of this film go beyond the usual tragic lesbian trope resulting in a work of art that’s more than just ahead of its time.\n\nGirl Picture\n\ndir. Alli Haapasalo, 2022\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nAlli Haapasalo’s coming-of-age movie about three teen girls is told across three Friday nights. The first Friday night Mimmi and her coworker go to a house party where Mimmi encounters Emma and has a magical gay evening. Whether they’re dancing to Perfume Genius and Tove Styrke or having the best sex of their young lives, Haapasalo gives us a young couple that feels authentic and worthy of audience squealing. The ways in which Mimmi and Emma differ feel like ways they can grow together. The story is reminiscent of other coming-of-age movies, but the performances and specificity of the characters — as well as the clever structure — elevate the film as a whole. It’s a snapshot of a moment in time — for these three girls, for girlhood in general.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\ndir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: thriller, mystery // Rating: ★★★\n\nIf there’s one reason the Swedish adaptation remains the favorite among most queer women it’s Noomi Rapace. The movie itself may not be as formally accomplished as Fincher’s redo, but Rapace makes Lisbeth Salander instantly iconic. She’s gritty and fierce in a way so many badass Hollywood heroines are not. There’s nothing pretty about her take on Salander and that makes her all the more alluring.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\ndir. David Fincher, 2011\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: thriller, mystery // Rating: ★★★\n\nMany questioned the necessity for another adaptation of the popular Swedish crime novel, but David Fincher delivered a film that was more polished, more narratively sound, and perfectly attuned to his attention to detail. And can we really have too much Lisbeth Salander? Rooney Mara’s take on the highly competent, ever vengeful, deeply dreamy bisexual hacker is far more vulnerable — possibly weaker, possibly just more human, depending on your affection for the original.\n\nGlen or Glenda\n\ndir. Shirley Wood, 1953\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, experiental // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nShirley Wood is usually known by her deadname and is usually known as the supposed “worst director of all time.” But for anyone who’s trans or is familiar with the trans experience, her debut is a weird and wonderful film about transness made at a time of misinformation. Amidst the formal experimentation, Bela Lugosi playing God, and lots of other weirdness is the story of a woman in love with another woman. It’s remarkable that we have a movie about transness from this era made by an actual trans person. It’s deserving of celebration, not ridicule.\n\nGo Fish\n\ndir. Rose Troche, 1994\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nNumber 24 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nGoldfish Memory\n\ndir. Elizabeth Gill, 2003\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nLike Love, Actually, but Irish, gay, and riddled with commitment issues this ensemble romantic comedy follows the lives and intersecting relationships of several delightfully messy people. Equally split between gay, lesbian, and straight romances, some storylines work better than others, but all of the actors are charming and the film is smarter about love than most of these kinds of romcoms.\n\nGood Manners\n\ndir.

Paul Weitz, 2015\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nLily Tomlin was gifted the part she was born to play in Elle, stubborn wisecracking lesbian grandma of pregnant Sage. As they attempt to get Sage an abortion, Elle is forced to reflect on her own life. Tomlin is so funny and so tender, landing every joke with gusto and every emotional beat with depth. The movie also has a stellar supporting cast with Julia Garner as Sage, as well as Laverne Cox, Marcia Gay Harden, John Cho, Judy Greer, and Sam Elliot. It’s a sweet film that Tomlin makes into something more.\n\nThe Half Of It\n\ndir.

Clea DuVall, 2020\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, comedy // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nMake the yuletide gay! And maybe emotionally abusive? Look, not only did just about every queer online watch this holiday Hulu blockbuster when it was first released, every queer online seemed to have a very strong opinion about it. Was it the lesbian Christmas movie we’ve long-deserved? Or was it a secret horror movie about a girl more concerned with her homophobic family than Kristen Stewart? No one could agree but there are a few things we can agree on: it changed the landscape for lesbian Christmas movies and Aubrey Plaza as Harper is our forever crush. Sure, it would’ve been a fun twist for Plaza and Stewart to end up together. But holiday movies aren’t exactly known for their twists! With a great cast and familiar beats — and again, worth repeating, Aubrey Plaza — this movie seems guaranteed to out-live the discourse.\n\nThe Haunting\n\ndir. Robert Wise, 1963\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThe first and most loyal adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s novel is a remarkable work of understated horror cinema. Julie Harris plays Nell, a bitter and lonely woman who signs up to participate in a study of the paranormal in the wake of her mother’s death. One of the other participants is Theo, a gay woman with ESP and endless confidence. Claire Bloom plays her with an easy charm, and her character ends up being a foil to Nell — queerness as a metaphor for freedom. Due to these stellar performances, some excellent wide angle photography, and Robert Wise’s low-budget horror roots, this film stands out even amongst decades of imitators.\n\nHearts Beat Loud\n\ndir. Brett Haley, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy, musical // Rating: ★★★\n\nReversing the usual parent-child dynamic, this indie comedy casts Kiersey Clemons as a studious teen and Nick Offerman as her dad who just wants to jam. The relationship between their characters is lovely and the music they create together is genuinely good. Clemons is such a joy to watch and listen to and her romance with Sasha Lane is one of the best parts of the film. Unfortunately the subplots given to Offerman are less compelling, but that’s not enough to take away from the movie’s heartwarming charm.\n\nHeavenly Creatures\n\ndir. Peter Jackson, 1994\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama, horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNumber 19 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nThe Heiresses\n\ndir. Marcelo Martinessi, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nSlow and artful, the weight of emotions underneath this film settle in with melancholic surprise. Chela and Chiquita are two older upper-middle class lesbians whose 30 year partnership is interrupted when Chiquita goes to jail due to fraud. Broke and lonely, Chela begins offering rides to her older neighbors — and one younger woman with whom she develops a bond. Ana Brun is stellar as Chela — much of the film is just watching Chela in silence and Brun gives a performance worth watching. This is a sad film without resolutions, but its melancholy is equaled by its power.\n\nHide and Seek\n\ndir. Su Friedrich, 1996\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, experimental // Rating: ★★★★\n\nMixing real interviews with the tale of a fictional twelve-year-old, Su Friedrich creates a moving masterpiece about lesbian childhoods. Conservative narratives pit queerness against children but Friedrich shows the casual queerness of so many of our younger days. There’s an innocent joy to the way she shows the girls interact and a pointed confusion in how being gay makes someone feel different long before they have the right language to understand why. It’s a simple yet remarkable film from an all-time great cinema artist.\n\nHigh Art\n\ndir. Lisa Cholodenko, 1998\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 18 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nHoly Camp!\n\ndir. Javier Ambrossi, Javier Calvo, 2017\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, musical // Rating: ★★★★\n\nThe highest rated musical on this list, Javier Ambrossi and Javier Calvo’s truly unique movie lives up to its English title. But it’s not the camp that surprises — after all this is a movie where God appears singing Whitney Houston songs — it’s the depth. This story of two friends at a Catholic camp takes so many turns and is so filled with queer creativity, you might have no idea what you’ve just watched when the credits role. But the experience of the film — and oh my is it an experience — all serves an exploration about desire, faith, giving oneself to change, giving oneself to horniness, and what can happen when we open ourselves up to the possibilities life presents. The soundtrack is incredible, the visuals are stunning, and the whole thing is just so horny and Catholic and gay. Sorry, did you miss the part where God literally sings Whitney Houston songs??\n\nHoly Trinity\n\ndir. Molly Hewitt, 2019\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWriter/director/producer/star Molly Hewitt’s debut feature about a dominatrix who huffs a magic aerosol can and begins communicating with the dead is a truly inventive work of queer queer queer cinema. With two non-binary leads (Hewitt and Work in Progress/The Politician heartthrob Theo Germaine), imaginative low budget production design and costumes, and the setting of Chicago’s queer scene, Hewitt has made a film with a spirit that recalls the best of the 90s queer cinema. It’s funny, it’s sexy, it’s weird, and, best of all, it’s filled with references and nuance cishet people could never understand.\n\nThe Hours\n\ndir. Stephen Daldry, 2002\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★\n\nBased on Michael Cunningham’s perfect novel, this Oscar-winning adaptation mostly does justice to the trio of intersecting queer stories. Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf and her devastating performance is more than her fake nose. Meryl Streep plays a modern day woman named Clarissa, affectionately referred to as Mrs. Dalloway by her friend who is dying of AIDS-related causes. The middle story is the most explicitly gay. Julianne Moore plays a woman in the 50s desperate to be a better mother, fighting off feelings for her neighbor, and suddenly consumed with the book Mrs. Dalloway. This section feels chaste compared to the book — Moore and Toni Collette lacking a certain chemistry — but overall the movie is still a beautiful meditation on depression, loss, and the desire to live truthfully. Also the score by Philip Glass is incredible.\n\nHouse of Hummingbird\n\ndir. Kim Bora, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 86 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\ndir. Daniel Goldhaber, 2022\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: drama, thriller // Rating: ★★★★\n\nBy transposing the radical ideas of its source material into the structure of a heist movie, this work of cinematic collective action becomes as entertaining as it is important. All movies are propaganda and sometimes explicitly political films can end up feeling cheap and manipulative. There is nothing cheap here — except maybe its well-used indie film budget. The sharp writing is matched by Tehillah De Castro’s cinematography, Gavin Brivik’s score, Daniel Garber’s editing, and one of the best — and queerest — young casts assembled in years. This is like Ocean’s 8 except it’s actually a good movie and the stakes aren’t a necklace at the Met Gala but the fate of our planet. Oh and it’s explicitly gay. Not only is its queer relationship central to the film but there are a lot of queer women involved in the project — actor Sasha Lane, actor and writer Ariela Barer, producer Isa Mazzei. Exciting, meaningful, smart. This is queer genre cinema at its very best.\n\nThe Hunger\n\ndir.

Mary Harron, 1996\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★\n\nDirector Mary Harron and actress Lili Taylor do a phenomenal job capturing Valerie Solanas in all her complications. It’s a portrait of a subculture and a period of time and an exploration of what happens when some outsiders are too outside even for the outsiders. It’s unfortunate that the movie is less successful in its portrayal of Candy Darling, but overall it’s still a stellar film.\n\nI’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing\n\ndir.

Jane Anderson, Martha Coolidge, Anne Heche, 2000\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nThe three stories that make up this iconic HBO film certainly vary in quality. Jane Anderson’s 1961-set tale of a lesbian in mourning is simple and heartbreaking, while Anne Heche’s present day portrayal of Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone having a baby is cringeworthy at best. But it’s the middle section set in 1972 that makes the film what it is. Martha Coolidge’s love story between Michelle Williams and a very butch Chloë Sevigny is fun and sexy and explores questions of class and gender identity within lesbian circles. It also has an incredible supporting cast that includes Natasha Lyonne and Nia Long. The whole film can be watched by completists, but it’s this section that deserves true praise.\n\nImagine Me & You\n\ndir. Ol Parker, 2005\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 15 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nIn Between\n\ndir. Maysaloun Hamoud, 2016\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nThe trio of women at the center of Maysaloun Hamoud’s debut film couldn’t be more different. Leila is a high femme lawyer hoping to find love with a man who won’t control her. Salma is a lesbian DJ with parents desperate to marry her to a man. And Nour is a conservative student engaged to be married. But all three women are stubborn and determined to live lives beyond heteropatriarchy, beyond Israeli-occupation. The film captures the specific pain of managing multiple marginalized identities and provides a path forward – there may be no escape, but we can support each other in the struggle.\n\nThe Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\n\ndir. Maria Maggenti, 1995\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nBefore she was Tina, Laurel Holloman played heartthrob soft butch Randy Dean in this iconic 90s comedy. Paired with Nicole Ari Parker as Evie Roy, Holloman is earnest and charming and bursting with teenage energy. Randy and Evie are adorable together as they fall in love and field hilarious — and painful — responses from their friends and family. All these years later this movie is still just as cute and fun — and it might even make you like Tina.\n\nItty Bitty Titty Committee\n\ndir. Jamie Babbit, 2007\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nIt might be goofy, dated, and a bit all over the place, but there’s still a lot to enjoy in Jamie Babbit’s lesbian movie about a newcomer to a feminist action group. Melonie Diaz plays Anna, a goody two shoes who falls hard for cool girl Sadie and in the process gets radicalized. It’s a fun movie with a great ensemble cast and it’s truly just so gay.\n\nJe Tu Il Elle\n\ndir.

Pullappally, 2004\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThis tale of two women who find friendship as children and forbidden love as adults follows some familiar lesbian movie beats. But Ligy J. Pullappally centers her characters’ unique personalities and their environment’s complex reaction, ultimately ending up with a film that’s authentic and moving and beautiful from beginning to end. Suhasini V. Nair and Shrruiti Menon give very different, equally accomplished performances and their decades long bond is believable in every moment.\n\nJules of Light and Dark\n\ndir. Daniel Laabs, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nWinner of the Grand Jury prize for Outstanding American Feature at Outfest 2019, Daniel Laabs’ debut feature is about two lost individuals forming an unlikely connection. Tallie Medel is phenomenal as Maya, a heartsick lesbian struggling in the aftermath of a car accident. She befriends Freddy, a lonely gay man with an estranged daughter, played by Robert Longstreet and the film cuts back and forth between their two storylines. While a bit underwritten and at times as lost as its characters, the film ultimately works because of its central performances and Laabs’ impressive visual style.\n\nKajillionaire\n\ndir.

Joseph Gai Ramaka, 2001\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, musical // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThis reimagining of the opera Carmen is bursting with energy and sexuality. The titular temptress is made pansexual underlining her freedom and offering quite a few delicious moments. The music is incredible, the visuals are stunning, and Djeinaba Diop Gai’s central performance is as magnetic as this character deserves. While the film still ends in the expected tragedy, this version more than any other seems to really respect Karmen and her sexual freedom.\n\nThe Kids Are All Right\n\ndir.

Robert Aldrich, 1968\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: classic, drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nRobert Aldrich’s film is a landmark of lesbian cinema, but it’s brutal to watch. It perpetuates the trope of the bitter old lesbian with none of the pleasures of similar films. But as a movie it’s quite good with a devastating performance from Beryl Reid. It’s worth watching for her performance and for its historical importance even if it leaves a sour taste.\n\nKiss Me\n\ndir. Alexandra-Therese Keining, 2011\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhile featuring many lesbian movie clichés, Alexandra-Therese Keining’s film stands out due to its writing, its phenomenal lead performances from Ruth Vega Fernandez and Liv Mjönes, and some exceptionally well done sex scenes. The story may be simple, but the chemistry at its core is special.\n\nKissing Jessica Stein\n\ndir. Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, 2001\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNeurotic Jewish comedy but make it bicurious! This romcom written by and starring Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen is a delight from beginning to, well, not quite the end. Yes, the ending is frustrating to most even all these years later, but it doesn’t take away from how funny and genuinely moving most of the film remains. The whole movie has a really joyous warmth to it and Tovah Feldshuh gives an especially tender performance as Jessica’s mom. The landscape of lesbian cinema has widened in the past two decades making this film’s final twist much less egregious — if still disappointing to many.\n\nKnife + Heart\n\ndir. Yann Gonzalez, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nNumber 89 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nKnocking\n\ndir. Frida Kempff, 2021\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: horror // Rating: ★★★\n\nFrida Kempf’s debut narrative feature is a different kind of queer horror movie. It’s about a woman named Molly who leaves a psychiatric hospital to start a new life in a new apartment. Her trauma is hinted at in dreamy flashbacks — kisses from her lover on the beach, the terrifying expanse of the sea. There was an accident. The grief and the guilt — and likely some pre-existing mental illness — caused a psychotic episode. But now she’s trying to be better. This is a simple, effective thriller that largely takes place within the confines of Molly’s claustrophobic apartment. Kempff’s direction and star Cecilia Milocco’s performance place us in Molly’s head. As she unravels, we unravel, and the whole experience is deeply unsettling. This is not a fun genre film. This is a sad and visceral foray into one woman’s mind.\n\nLaurel Canyon\n\ndir. Lisa Cholodenko, 2002\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhile light on queer content, Lisa Cholodenko’s film about a free-spirited record producer and her straight-laced son is an understated and effective drama. Frances McDormand and Christian Bale are great as mother and son and Kate Beckinsale is dreamy as the son’s fiancée who just might have more interest in his mom and her boyfriend than her husband to be.\n\nLeading Ladies\n\ndir. Ruth Caudeli, 2021\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: drama, experimental // Rating: ★★★\n\nThe various plots of Leading Ladies — with their backstabbing, cheating, and litigious consequences — would fit right in on The L Word. And yet they couldn’t feel more different. Director Ruth Caudeli trusts her audience to follow along and to care without forcing or over-explaining any narrative threads. She is a queer woman making work for other queers and that’s felt in every beat. With its handheld cinematography, improvised dialogue, limited setting, and unconventional structure, Leading Ladies feels like a lo-fi experiment as much as it does a feature film. But abandoning the anchors present in most features isn’t a shortcut — it’s a challenge. It’s hard to make life’s quiet dramas riveting — Caudeli and her cast accomplish just that.\n\nLa Leyenda Negra\n\ndir. Patrícia Vidal Delgado, 2020\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nPatrícia Vidal Delgado’s gorgeous Black & White debut feature is political cinema at its best. Telling the story of a queer girl whose immigration status is affected by a new Trump administration policy, Delgado understands that the most effective political films don’t feel like Political Films — they feel like stories about people. Monica Betancourt gives a phenomenal performance as Aleteia, a teenage girl filled with righteous fury at her circumstances and tender love for her new friend and crush, Rosarito played by Kaileil Lopez. Watching Aleteia and Rosarito find unexpected connection and first queer feelings is a delight. They deserve a world without borders and binaries where they can be free to explore the young love blossoming between them. This is a love story, a friendship story, a cry for change. This is a movie about two queer Latinx teenagers who deserve better.\n\nLianna\n\ndir. John Sayles, 1983\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: classic, drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nSurprisingly tender and complicated for a lesbian movie written and directed by a straight man, this classic of queer cinema follows the titular character through her first gay love and heartbreak. Rather than framing Lianna’s coming out as intrinsically tied to her crush on Professor Ruth, she’s forced to reckon with her identity and ultimately do so alone. Linda Griffiths is so lovely to watch on-screen as Lianna navigates her desires and disappointments. It’s a sad movie, but within that sadness is a sense of hope — a sense that someday Lianna will find love and do so as an individual.\n\nLife Partners\n\ndir. Susanna Fogel, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nA twist on the lesbian in love with her best friend trope, Leighton Meester’s Sasha never falls for Gillian Jacobs’ Paige — but she is jealous when Paige starts dating Tim played by Adam Brody. This is a sweet exploration of codependent friendships with casually resonant lead performances and a great supporting cast of Gabourey Sidibe, Abby Elliot, Beth Dover and Kate McKinnon.\n\nLiz and the Blue Bird\n\ndir. Naoko Yamada, 2018\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nA spin-off of the anime series Sound! Euphonium and based on the same novels, Naoko Yamada’s beautiful tale of high school longing is overwhelmed with high school feeling. Mizore is shy and awkward and devastatingly in love with her popular best friend Nozomi. They’re in band together and are tasked with performing a solo based on a story called Liz and the Blue Bird. Yamada cuts between our central story and the titular story itself as they blend the minutely real with fairy tale expanse. The animation is stunning and the attention to detail places us squarely in Mizore’s state of obsession. Queer women are still largely absent from animated movies — especially ones appropriate for children — and this provides one of the rare exceptions. Words like gay and lesbian may not be used but the love and desire is more than explicit. This is a film about letting go of those you love — a message needed by adolescents and us all.\n\nLizzie\n\ndir. Craig William Macneill, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, horror // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nChloë Sevigny was reportedly disappointed with the final results of this long-gestating project, but any movie focusing on a romance between her and Kristen Stewart can’t be all bad. In fact, the movie is pretty good largely because of its two central performances. But as the maudlin tale drags on one is left wondering what might have been if those two performances had a script with a bit more depth and a director with a bit more ingenuity.\n\nLost and Delirious\n\ndir. Léa Pool, 2001\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nLoved by some, hated by others, Léa Pool’s boarding school dyke drama is as heightened as its angsty teens. Piper Perabo plays soft butch heartthrob Paulie Oster who is desperate to sonnet and fence her way into Jessica Paré’s heart. The dialogue is corny and the symbolism is heavy handed, but the story is told through the eyes of Mischa Barton’s younger new student and with that brings a level of naïveté to the whole approach. If you love falcons and feelings this movie might just be for you.\n\nLove and Other Catastrophes\n\ndir. Emma-Kate Croghan, 1996\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nIf Whit Stillman was an Australian lesbian this is the movie he’d have made. But he didn’t have to because Emma-Kate Croghan made it instead! Snappy dialogue and fun performances make for a fun movie that will either endear you or repulse you depending on your tolerance for film students discussing intellectual topics as they navigate their messy love lives. It helps when those film students aren’t all straight and aren’t all men that’s for sure!\n\nLove My Life\n\ndir. Koji Kawano, 2006\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nIf you don’t read the plot description for this otherwise low-key lesbian coming-of-age romance, the coming out scene will be one of the most surprising ever filmed. It’s a twist that adds a fascinating layer to the story and the movie is at its best when exploring this complexity and Ichiko’s relationship to her family. Her chemistry with Eri is really sweet and actors Rei Yoshii and Asami Imajuku are fun to watch in the roles. The plot is a bit convoluted with conflict that feels manufactured, but it’s still very enjoyable.\n\nLove, Spells and All That\n\ndir. Ümit Ünal, 2019\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nÜmit Ünal’s intimate romance tells the story of Eren who returns to her hometown ready to declare her still-burning love for her adolescent girlfriend, Reyhan. But for Reyhan — who holds far less economic privilege — love, especially forbidden love, is something she cannot afford. This conflict is heightened with two phenomenal performances by Selen Uçer as Reyhan and Ece Dizdar as Eren. They embody their characters — and their characters’ histories — in full. The twenty years is felt in every line and glance. There’s also magic in the setting itself. This beautiful Turkish island — with all the weight it holds for these characters — is a location that’s easy to fall in love with. Ünal is patient in his writing and directing. He trusts his actors and his setting and it results in a film that is at once both wholly naturalistic and bursting with fantasy.\n\nThe Lure\n\ndir. Agnieszka Smoczyńska, 2017\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, horror, musical // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nThis genre-bending mermaid musical horror movie was likely not intended to be about a gay trans girl and her straight trans girl best friend — Michalina Olszanska and Marta Mazurek who play the central mermaids, Gold and Silver, are both cis. And yet with its literal bottom surgery and riff on The Little Mermaid — a trans girl favorite — it’s no surprise that it’s left such an impression on the community. But beyond this imposed subtext this is still a weird and wonderful work of queer cinema that includes a sung-through scene of lesbian fish sex that makes The Shape of Water look like Mr. Limpet.\n\nLyle\n\ndir. Stewart Thorndike, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nStewart Thorndike’s tight and terrifying horror movie is as much about grief as it is exploring the messiness of placing a queer woman in the plot of Rosemary’s Baby. The movie asks a lot of questions without providing answers, but what it does provide is a breathtaking horror experience led by an animalistic performance from Gaby Hoffmann.\n\nMa Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\ndir. George C. Wolfe, 2020\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nDirector George C. Wolfe and screenwriter Ruben Santiago-Hudson combine their stage and screen brilliance to create this August Wilson adaptation that knows when to expand and knows when to stew in its theatricality. This is not a film about queerness per say — its focus is more the creation and appropriation of Black art — but Wolfe, Santiago-Hudson, and greatest actress alive Viola Davis ensure the queerness of the film. There is no subtext. Ma Rainey’s relationship with Dussie Mae played by Taylour Paige is made explicit and her queerness is made an integral part of her character. Lesbian romance films are obviously great, but it’s worth celebrating a film that focuses on a queer woman’s art and how race, gender, and sexuality impact how she creates and moves through the world.\n\nMädchen in Uniform\n\ndir. Leontine Sagan, 1931\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: classic, coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 34 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nMake a Wish\n\ndir. Sharon Ferranti, 2002\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, horror // Rating: ★★★\n\nLike The L Word, if it didn’t take six seasons for the dykes to start killing each other, Sharon Ferranti’s lesbian slasher is a delicious gem. Low-budget and pulpy, this movie is certainly not cheap on character development or intracommunity gags. Even the premise — a lesbian goes camping with all her exes who she cheated on because they’re all still friends and then they start dying one by one — feels unique to our world. Considering Rita Mae Brown wrote Slumber Party Massacre, lesbians aren’t strangers to the slasher genre, but this still remains the most lesbian of them all.\n\nManji\n\ndir. Yasuzô Masumura, 1964\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: classic, drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nProof that you can’t judge queer cinema by when it was made, Yasuzô Masumura’s semi-exploitation classic is absolutely bonkers. Sonoko, played with a delightfully unhinged energy by Kyôko Kishida, is a lonely housewife who falls hard for Mitsuko at their “art school for ladies.” Mitsuko is played by Ayako Wakao and she really creates a character worth going crazy for. This is a movie of big gay feelings to an extent that would be troublesome if it wasn’t so delicious. Things only get crazier when Sonoko’s husband gets involved — and even crazier when the poisoning begins. Nothing will prepare you for this movie, so you just have to watch it.\n\nMargarita with a Straw\n\ndir. Shonali Bose, 2014\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nQueer disabled representation is almost non-existent in media which makes this film’s triumphs all the more exciting, and its failures all the more frustrating. It allows its lead character the freedom to make mistakes, to explore her sexuality in all its messiness, and go beyond the narratives usually forced on disabled characters by abled filmmakers. Unfortunately the writers and directors are abled and even more unfortunately so are the lead actresses. One has to wonder if some of the film’s missteps, such as sexualizing a caretaking situation and having the blind character touch faces, as well as some of its more saccharine moments, would’ve been avoided if disabled people were actually involved in the making of the film. The movie is funny and sexy and sweet, but when it comes to disabled representation we still have so much further to go.\n\nMars One\n\ndir. Gabriel Martins, 2022\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★★\n\nNumber 84 on our Best Lesbian Movies of All Time list. Read more.\n\nMemento Mori\n\ndir. Min Kyu-Dong, Kim Tae-Yong, 1999\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, horror // Rating: ★★★★\n\nTechnically the second film in the Whispering Corridors Korean horror series, this film focuses more on the emotions of its trio of queer teen girls than it does easy scares. But this is still a ghost story. Min-ah discovers the shared journal of her classmates Hyo-shin and Shi-eun filled with gay longing. She becomes obsessed with them — the obsession only increasing when Hyo-shin tragically dies. Haunted by Hyo-shin and drawn towards Shi-eun, Min-ah has to confront her own queerness and find a way forward. It’s a melancholy, yet ultimately hopeful film, about adolescence and the possibility of queer futures.\n\nMiao Miao\n\ndir. Cheng Hsiao-Tse, 2008\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nIf you watch this movie hoping for the teen girls at its center to be together you’ll be disappointed. But if you watch this movie to witness the kind of adolescent yearning queer teens know intimately then you’ll be pleased. It’s a classic tale of lesbian girl meets probably bi girl meets probably gay boy who is probably in love with his ex-bandmate. No one really knows what they’re doing or how to express their feelings, but with its poppy soundtrack and jarring editing Cheng Hsiao-Tse seems to embrace the messy adolescent perspective of his characters. The characters feel what they want so deeply, but feeling what you want and articulating what you want are far from the same thing. Adolescence is hard no matter what, but queer adolescence is another level of confusion.\n\nThe Miseducation of Cameron Post\n\ndir.

Michael Rianda, 2021\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, comedy // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWhile Disney is still bragging about their exclusively gay moments and NOT giving Elsa a girlfriend, Sony and Netflix have gifted us with this funny, emotional, and delightfully inventive queer kids movie. Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson) is a teen filmmaker ready to escape her town where nobody understands her and go off to film school to find her people. Unfortunately, her plans get interrupted by her dad — oh and the robot apocalypse. Katie must learn to accept her biological family while still knowing she has a chosen family out there she needs too. Her queerness may be subtle but this is a wildly enjoyable step toward the queer kids movies we deserve.\n\nMommy is Coming\n\ndir.

Paul Weitz, 2022\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nLike their previous work together in Grandma, Paul Weitz and Lily Tomlin’s second collaboration has greater ambitions than showcasing Tomlin’s singular talents. If, ultimately, Tomlin still ends up its greatest success — along with fellow legend Jane Fonda — that’s because there’s just so much talent to show. This traumatic farce explores the decades long effects of sexual assault and homophobia. It’s also a delightful good time. Through most of its runtime, it balances its tones and plots with a deft touch. Despite the occasional misstep in its final act, it’s still a lovely, quietly ambitious movie. As long as Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are still working, they should keep working together — especially with material this rich, nuanced, and just plain hilarious.\n\nMulholland Drive\n\ndir.

Tali Shalom-Ezer, 2017\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nCapital punishment romance is a tough sell, but three stunning performances from Elliot Page, Kate Mara, and Amy Seimetz, and endless chemistry between Page and Mara, make this movie more watchable than its premise. It’s certainly emotional, but rarely maudlin, avoiding too much melodrama by focusing on the characters as people. There are moments of humor and even a few stellar sex scenes.\n\nMy Mother Likes Women\n\ndir. Daniela Fejerman, Ines Paris, 2002\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nFinding a balance between pathos and farce, this movie about three sisters and their newly out mother is a messy delight. Leonor Watling is impossible not to love as the anxious Elvira and while the film is more centered on her than her mother’s queer relationship, it’s still a funny and moving film about figuring out one’s identity. It’s also pretty clear that Elvira herself is bisexual — no matter what her creepy male therapist says.\n\nMy Summer of Love\n\ndir. Pawel Pawlikowski, 2004\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama // Rating: ★★★\n\nWhat begins is a quiet and tender queer coming-of-age love story takes a darker turn, as characters get increasingly untrustworthy and violent. It’s beautifully shot and has moving performances from Natalie Press and Emily Blunt, in her breakout role. It may not be the happiest queer film, but it’s not without hope, and the journey is worth it.\n\nNina’s Heavenly Delights\n\ndir. Pratibha Parmar, 2006\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: comedy, romance // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nThis sweet Indian-Scottish romcom is silly and sentimental, but it’s also a pleasure to watch. It has solid performances from Shelley Conn and Laura Fraser, a fun and breezy script, and a few great dance numbers. Beautiful lesbians and food porn are indeed heavenly delights and this movie has plenty of both.\n\nNope\n\ndir. Jordan Peele, 2022\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: action, horror // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nJordan Peele’s alien invasion masterpiece is so funny and so entertaining that it’s easy to ignore just how audacious it is. Beyond its grand visual achievements, it is structurally inventive and thematically dense. Like Us, this is a film with a lot on its mind in ways that continue to unravel through thought and discussion. Oh and it stars the one and only Keke Palmer getting to play her whole queer self. Maybe someday there will be a director’s cut where she at the very least flirts with Barbie Ferreira but even in the theatrical release she is explicitly queer. It’s not the point and yet in a movie partially about who is centered in film history and who is forgotten, this aspect of her character cannot be ignored.\n\nThe Novice\n\ndir. Lauren Hadaway, 2021\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama, sports // Rating: ★★★★\n\nBefore writing and directing her masterful debut, Lauren Hadaway worked in sound. Once you know this, it makes sense why her film’s rowing instructions get stuck in your head like a pop song. Legs body arms. Arms body legs. It’s dialogue as rhythm, thoughts as rhythm, mental illness as rhythm. This film is not about novice rower Alex Dall as much as it is her. The movie’s sound design and score — along with accomplished cinematography and editing that knows when to cut and when to hold — place us in her mind and body. We don’t need exposition. We want her to win because we are her. We feel her pain because she’s in pain. The oft-told suggestion “show, don’t tell” only uses half of cinema’s tools — Hadaway uses them all. And while none of this technical achievement would work without a performance to match, Hadaway has just that in Isabelle Fuhrman. Together they’ve created a visceral cinematic experience. Nearly forty years after Personal Best, here’s a sweaty queer sports movie that’s as twisted and bloody as we are. Queerness is an escape — it’s everything else that’s the problem.\n\nNovitiate\n\ndir. Margaret Betts, 2017\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama, period piece // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nReligion is often framed as the enemy in queer films making Margaret Betts’ debut all the more unique. Margaret Qualley plays a young woman who decides to become a nun much to her nonreligious mother’s horror. There are clear parallels between this conflict and the conflict many queer people face when coming out. The subtext becomes text and we see how the lines between faith and queerness are not as distinct as we sometimes think. Melissa Leo gives a grand and horrifying performance as the harsh Reverend Mother desperately trying to hold onto her own way of life in the face of Vatican II. Utilizing this specific moment in history, Betts creates a startling film about commitment to self in the face of societal judgement.\n\nOlivia\n\ndir.

Jane Arden, 1972\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama, experimental, horror // Rating: ★★★★\n\nBased on her stage production, A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets, and Witches, Jane Arden’s uncategorizable masterwork was named by Autostraddle as featuring the scariest queer horror movie moment of all time. Far from your average scare fare, this film oscillates between the uncanny terror and joyful surrealism inspired by the headspace of its protagonist with schizophrenia. Arden herself struggled with mental illness and campaigned against the psychiatric treatments of her time. Those experiences are on full display here — the horror coming as much from the external “care” as the protagonist’s inner mental state. Equal parts queer magic, political fury, and arlecchino nightmare clowns, it’s time this underground classic took its rightful place on the surface.\n\nThe Owls\n\ndir. Cheryl Dunye, 2010\n\nUnavailable\n\nGenre: drama, experimental, mystery // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, icon Cheryl Dunye returned with this flawed but interesting work of lesbian cinema. At only a little over an hour, it acts as a comeback for Dunye, a postmortem on 90s queer cinema, an exploration of generation gaps in the queer community, and an examination of the differences between transmasculine people and butch lesbians. It may not work as well as Dunye’s other films appearing further down this list, but it’s still fascinating.\n\nParallel Mothers\n\ndir. Pedro Almodóvar, 2021\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nWomanhood has been a front for so many facets of Pedro Almodóvar’s own life. But in his latest masterpiece womanhood is a front for even more. Janis (Penélope Cruz once again giving birth, playing queer, and doing career best work for Almodóvar) is a photographer whose great-grandfather was killed by Franco’s regime. She gets pregnant and at the hospital meets Ana (Milena Smit), a teenager giving birth at the same time. The years pass and the plot turns with reliably Almodóvarian melodrama. Spoiler: Ana cuts off her hair, dyes it blonde, and becomes super gay. This is a movie about the importance of living in the past — not out of nostalgia, but out of accountability. It’s Almodóvar’s complicated reverence for his mother, unabashed reverence for lesbians, and reluctant reverence for his own femininity, that result in a story where queer women are the only ones capable of interrupting cycles of generational trauma.\n\nPariah\n\ndir.

Pedro Almodóvar, 1980\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: classic, comedy // Rating: ★★★1/2\n\nPedro Almodóvar’s first masterpiece is also his film most focused on lesbians. An irreverent comedy that’s also a sort of rape/revenge movie, this one certainly isn’t for everybody. But if you’re open to its tone — and its content — you’ll find a laugh-out-loud hilarious, surprisingly emotional movie about women trying their best to survive and have some fun along the way. If you’re into movies where a lesbian pees on a cop’s wife then this one is for you!\n\nThe Perfection\n\ndir. Richard Shepard, 2018\n\nOur Review // Watch It\n\nGenre: horror // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nThis isn’t a great film, or even a good film, and it’s offensive in a myriad of ways. But what it lacks in quality and morals it sure does make up for in thrills. If you’re in the mood for a gory shockfest that also has cello playing lesbian sex between Allison Williams and Logan Browning, then this movie won’t disappoint.\n\nPersona\n\ndir.

Ruth Caudeli, 2022\n\nOur Review // Unavailable\n\nGenre: drama, experimental, romance // Rating: ★★★\n\nRuth Caudeli continues her already prolific career of intimate, experimental works of queer expression with this semi-autobiographical tale of a throuple. Caudeli, Silvia Varón, and Ana Mariá Otálora, real-life girlfriends and regular collaborators, all play versions of themselves. Much of the film’s runtime is concerned with the difficulties within the relationship but that never feels like commentary on throuples or polyamory. In fact, it’s long-distance that presents the largest challenge. It’s not that the film shies away from the specific joys and challenges of a throuple — it’s just done in a way that doesn’t attach value or judgment. There is still a lack of grounded queer cinema about polyamory and it’s a thrill to have a movie like this that not only fills that representational gap but does so with Caudeli’s unique cinematic style.\n\nThe Pirate\n\ndir. Jacques Doillon, 1984\n\nWatch It\n\nGenre: drama // Rating: ★★1/2\n\nThis lesbian movie starts the drama at 100 and then turns it up. It’s as French as it is over-the-top as it is gay gay gay. Only the French would cast Jane Birkin in a love triangle with another woman and a man PLAYED BY HER BROTHER. It’s a brutal, unpleasant movie, but its magnetism is undeniable.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\ndir.
