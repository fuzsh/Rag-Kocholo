Yes, there were cheesy moments - but it&apos;s a great romantic comedy for those looking to feel all warm and happy in the end.  Your heart will say, &quot;Awwwwwwwww!&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Loved it, loved it, LOVED IT!",

        "text": "The low rating turned me off initially, but I watched it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I thought this may have fared better on rottentomatoes.com, but it received an abysmal 6% there, only one of sixteen reviewers enjoyed it. :( Nina's Heavenly Delights is by no means challenging, new or groundbreaking, but I agree with everything else said here.. It is charming, sweet, and there's great chemistry between Laura (Lisa) and Shelley (Nina). I felt the story was good and the characters were authentic, and Ronny Jhutti (Bobbi) really cracked me up. :P\n\nreply share\n\nThe only thing really cheesy about this movie was the announcer at the end and the transvestite/gay fellow - sometimes he had humor, other times it's like \"okay\". Frankly, it's not important to me what people do in their own lives, so I'm not judging but Bobby's key role in the film was curing Nina of her insecurity due to her attraction to Lisa and provide the environment Nina's mother would need to get use to, so she may respect Nina's feelings and happiness before her own traditions. However, Nina shouldn't have been so nervous about it. The mother clearly understood Bobby playing by his own rules and was even charmed by his rather quirky yet tasteful sense of humor and attire. People are who they are. Can't change them. Only analyze and change how you feel about them when it matters the most.\n\nAs far as the romance goes, even though it started slowly this felt like love at first sight. I saw the way Nina looked at Lisa with curiosity and the more they chat more the more they clicked in the kitchen and the club.\n\nreply share"
