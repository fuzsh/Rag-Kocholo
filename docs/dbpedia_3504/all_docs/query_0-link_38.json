However, a form of film more readily identifiable with the internationally recognisable rom-com genre than were earlier examples has proliferated in France since the 1990s. On the one hand, this development can be seen in the context of the increasingly transnational nature of cinema. On the other, the phenomenon coincides with a period characterised by an identity crisis unprecedented in human history, one with both a global reach and specific resonance in France, provoked by the movement away from clearly delineated gender roles (Badinter 2010: 12). Since romantic comedy is a genre focused on coupling culture, its French variant can be expected to respond to this crisis. This book seeks to examine the factors behind and implications of the spectacular rise of the rom-com in France in the 1990s and 2000s, as it pertains to the film industry and to the issue of generic definitions, as well as more generally in terms of representations. In probing the significance of the contemporary French rom-com, this study not only takes stock of a new development; it also represents an intervention into the field of French film studies, in that popular cinema (and comedy in particular) originating in France has to date suffered from neglect by scholarly research. According to Richard Abel, ‘most historians would agree that it was the French who almost singlehandedly created film comedy’ (1984: 220). Moreover, Susan Hayward has shown how the genre has consistently outperformed others in the domestic market and, specifically, been a key factor in 1\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n2\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nthe national mainstream cinema’s success since 1990, accounting for at least 50 per cent of domestic box office takings to 2002. Since then, too, the genre has year on year accounted for the lion’s share of production (between 20 and 35 per cent) and comedies have featured in similar proportions in the nation’s annual box office top 20. No wonder, then, that Hayward remarks on the need for ‘an extended analysis of the processes and ideological function of French comedy’, at the time of her writing and still nearly two decades later ‘conspicuous by its absence’ (2005 [1993]: 304–6). By analysing one subgroup within French comedy – and, as we shall see, a significant, pervasive and commercially impactful one – this research represents a contribution towards redressing the balance between French comedy’s enormous popularity and its widespread exclusion from academic enquiry. Prominent precursors to the current French rom-com trend begin appearing as early as the end of the 1980s, with a film by feminist popular auteur Coline Serreau, hit inter-class romance Romuald et Juliette/ Mama, There’s a Man in Your Bed (1989), leading the way. Serreau’s film doubtless influenced the wave of female auteur rom-coms appearing in the 1990s, directed by the likes of Chantal Akerman, Josiane Balasko, Catherine Corsini and Tonie Marshall. By the start of the 2000s, other directors of both genders were making rom-coms that not only achieved domestic success but also relatively substantial international distribution, bringing greater global visibility to the genre. These include Le Fabuleux destin d’Am´elie Poulain/Amelie ( Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001), D´ecalage horaire/Jet Lag (Dani`ele Thompson, 2002), Prˆetemoi ta main/I Do (Eric Lartigau, 2006), Hors de prix/Priceless (Pierre Salvadori, 2006), De vrais mensonges/Beautiful Lies (Salvadori, 2010) and L’Arnacœur/Heartbreaker (Pascal Chaumeil, 2010). These successes cemented the genre’s firmly established status as a relatively common form of French production by the end of the 2000s. So much so, in fact, that the term com´edie romantique has become standardised in press and marketing campaigns and even filtered down to made-for-television films (see for example Germain 2010). Nonetheless, the fact that as recently as 2008 the two French film scholars to remark on the trend, Rapha¨elle Moine and Brigitte Rollet, were still describing it as nascent (Moine 2008) or even ‘an extremely rare and recent phenomenon’ (Rollet 2008: 92) suggests that the speed with which the traditionally foreign genre has caught on has been so dizzying that commentators\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhave had trouble keeping up. This makes a scholarly exploration of the contemporary French rom-com timely. Two further, more specific factors in the rom-com’s French efflorescence emerge from this summary: the number of female directors working in the national industry, and the genre’s commercial potential. As concerns the first of these, a cursory look at the appended romcom filmography of the 1990s and 2000s suggests that at least a third of films (more in the 1990s) were directed by women. This is a high figure even in the context of a country where female directors have been responsible for between 14 and 19 per cent of overall production during the period (compared with 9 per cent in Hollywood in 1998, falling to only 5 per cent in 2010).1 Although filmed romantic comedy was not originally conceived as geared to female audiences in particular, it has consistently been theorised as a genre with specific relevance for women, given their historical circumscription to cultural narratives of heterosexual coupling and family life, and thanks to the substantial roles the format has offered actresses. Moreover, as several rom-com critics have noted, recent decades have seen a turn towards assigning to romcom a more exclusively feminine address in the context of post-Pretty Woman (Garry Marshall, USA 1990) Hollywood (Garrett 2007: 121; Ferriss and Young 2008a; Burns 2011). Mobilising the tropes of romantic comedy has certainly been a factor in the considerable box-office revenues garnered by French women directors, particularly in the 2000s (see also Harrod 2012: 227–8). Indeed, the second immediate explanation for the genre’s burgeoning at this particular time in France concerns precisely the explosive success of the global (primarily Hollywood) genre in the 1980s and 1990s – including in France, where films like When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, USA 1989) and Pretty Woman attracted massive audiences (1.9 and 4 million tickets sold respectively).2 It is unremarkable that French producers and directors should seek to emulate such profitability in their home market, not least given comedy’s popularity during eras characterised by the kind of social division and, latterly, financial crisis that France has known over the period in question. The fact that French comic genres do not typically require huge budgets (by contrast with the situation in Hollywood and with other popular French genres such as heritage biopics [La Mˆome/La Vie en rose (Olivier Dahan, 2007), Coco avant Chanel/Coco Before Chanel (Anne Fontaine, 2009), Yves\n\n3\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n4\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nSaint-Laurent ( Jalil Lespert, 2014)] and special effects films [Micmacs a` tire-larigot/Micmacs ( Jeunet, 2009)]) makes them all the more appealing for commercially-oriented filmmakers. However, this exclusively industrial angle does not tell the whole story. Rather, this study subscribes to the widely held view of genre as ‘a functional interface between the cinematic institution, audiences, and the wider realm of culture’ (Krutnik 1990: 57). This perspective does not ignore the complexities involved in speculating about exact relations between film texts and the social world, and specifically the limitations of top-down, ‘mass society’ theses, which have tended to portray establishment institutions as foisting ideologies upon uniformly uncritical consumers of popular and media culture. These limitations have been foregrounded by now familiar but nonetheless highly significant 1970s studies by such media scholars as Ian Jarvie (1970; 1978) and Andrew Tudor (1974) (or, in a French context, albeit less explicitly and fully, Pierre Sorlin [1977]), as well as the 1990s’ turn towards reception studies, which seek to take stock of audience members’ individual profiles, circumstances and ability to actively interpret films. While such approaches distance themselves from earlier readings that assumed uncomplicated recognition of single patterns of meaning, they nonetheless acknowledge the ongoing value of – inevitably subjective – critical analyses of film texts from a sociohistorical point of view. As Tudor has put it: ‘In dramatising [a society’s] traits the movies participate in a continual and complex social process. [ . . . ] They are both reflection and cause; a link in a closed circle’ (1974: 218). In accordance with the recognition that films both reflect and feed back into social change, this research attempts to sample and shed light on this circular dynamic, and thus contemporary French cultural history, as it is manifested through the phenomenon of national romantic comedy. In so doing it hopes to elucidate the reasons for and implications of the rom-com’s appropriation by French filmmakers in the 1990s and 2000s, as well as the ways in which the genre contributes to film’s widely recognised role in establishing cultural norms – in this case notably, if certainly not exclusively, ‘defin[ing] and demonstrat[ing] socially sanctioned ways of falling in love’ (WrightWexman 1993: ix). In order to begin to ask more specific questions about the genre, however, I will first elaborate on precisely what are the characteristics of the films that have led to the emergence of a French rom-com genre.\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nThe notorious difficulty of generic definition may be particularly acute when it comes to rom-com. Brian Henderson (1978: 1) has suggested that several major generic inventories do not include it as a distinct category because the frequency with which romance and comedy occur across Hollywood production makes this genre extremely hard to pin down. This situation is compounded by the term’s liberal use as a highly ‘saleable’ marketing label as much as any reflection of a film’s content. Nonetheless, various theorists have hazarded attempts to categorise the genre. These range from extreme generalities (Krutnik’s [2002: 133] argument that rom-com pivotally hinges on the question of love) to ‘master’ definitions ( Jeffers McDonald 2007: 9) that are by their nature constricting. One structural feature that recurs in descriptions of the genre and is relevant to pinning down the key traits of the recent French trend is the broadly equal allocation of narrative space to male and female characters (see for example Neale and Krutnik 1990: 139; Rowe 1995: 109). Celestino Deleyto (1998: 137) has qualified this observation with the important caveat that in practice one point of view tends to dominate. Nonetheless, such textual architecture may be viewed as relatively egalitarian in comparison with that of most other Hollywood genres (female-centred melodramas providing an important exception), which, historically, have privileged a focus on men. The contrast with French cinematic history is even starker. According to Moine (2008), the closest French cinema comes to romantic comedy in the classical era is the com´edie boulevardi`ere, or vaudeville comedy. These comedies were generally structured around the amorous adventures of a male character: a star performer, usually from a theatre background, for whom the stories – often theatrical adaptations – were vehicles (see Sellier 1999a). Films starring and directed by Sacha Guitry are emblematic. Female characters in this schema were subordinate, smaller roles played by performers who were less wellknown, and often much younger, than the men with whom they were paired, making them prime examples of the on-screen portrayal of ‘incestuous’ coupling identified with the films of that period by Ginette Vincendeau (1988). The contrast with the contemporaneous Hollywood screwball comedy, animated by feisty heroines and powerful actresses, is apparent. For Moine, the major differences between these\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCorpus and Contexts\n\n5\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n6\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\ntwo filmic frameworks for the exploration of heterosexual love explain the relative absence of US remakes of French films into romantic comedies (she counts only three rom-coms out of more than 70 US remakes of French films ever). Various scholars have similarly identified incestuous and/or misogynistic tendencies in both classical and New Wave French cinema (Burch and Sellier 1996; Sellier 19973 , 1999b; Vincendeau 1992). As Vincendeau (2000b: 113) suggests, it is the relatively equal allotment of narrative subjectivity that has been seen to typify rom-com that even 1960s French cinema was still some way off tolerating. This has for the most part continued to be the case in mainstream comedy at any rate, up until the emergence of the current spate of rom-coms, with male duos reigning even more supremely in France than in Hollywood. Thus since 2000 alone exemplary male buddy comedies – with openly misogynistic elements – including La Beuze/The Dope (Franc¸ois Desagnat and Thomas Sorriaux, 2003), Brice de Nice/The Brice Man ( James Huth, 2005), La Doublure/The Valet (Francis Veber, 2006), Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis/Welcome to the Sticks (Dany Boon, 2008), Rien a` d´eclarer/Nothing to Declare (Boon, 2010) and Intouchables/Untouchable (Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, 2011) have all featured in the box-office top ten. The contemporary cycle of films represents a major change in this regard: it is principally their promotion of female points of view – as well as a light-hearted approach to love viewed at once as miraculous transformation and yet also as socially contingent – that identifies them with the global genre and renders appropriate their analysis from within its purview. Additionally, many films include explicit acknowledgements of their debt to Hollywood, through intertextual references. The promotion of female subjectivity by the French rom-com, taken in conjunction with female filmmakers’ widespread participation in the genre, clearly says something about changing gender roles in contemporary France – as indeed does a high proportion of narratives of female rebellion (as well as, in the 2000s, of male riposte). Such observations begin to add detail to the schematic suggestion made earlier that the genre arises in part from women’s greater access to professional equality in the film industry. As suggested, the ways in which the genre mediates social anxiety arising from such changes is a key concern of this analysis; but it is nonetheless as well to state clearly from the outset that the genre’s explosion is itself viewed\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhere as a measure of acutely heightened tensions around the role of men and women, in couple formations and in society as a whole, in contemporary France. This is perhaps no surprise in a context where gender equality has historically lagged significantly behind that of the US or Britain. For example, French women were not allowed to manage property and income until the early 1900s, nearly a century after most of their North American sisters, and they did not achieve suffrage until 1944, a full quarter of a century behind the latter. In more recent years, too, relative equality in some spheres has been coupled with a firmly embedded loyalty to the notion of gender difference in other aspects of life. For example, a major feature distinguishing French from anglophone schools of feminism historically has been the former’s focus on championing feminine specificity, as opposed to stressing equality. This emphasis on ‘the feminine’, and concomitant celebration of motherhood has arguably posed relatively few challenges to existing designations of gender roles: as Christine Bard (1999a: 304) has chronicled, ‘[those advocating a ‘feminine identity’ were accused] of excessively reinforcing difference to the overall benefit of patriarchy’.4 At the same time, while marriage in Western culture has been in ‘crisis’ for well over a century, it is generally acknowledged that second-wave feminism and the attack on traditional values of the 1960s provoked particular disturbances in the conventions of marriage and intimate relationships. France’s historical allegiance to the Catholic Church may initially have fortified the institution of marriage more solidly against the challenges posed within its borders by liberalism than was the case in Britain or the US. In recent years, though, France has had the lowest per capita annual marriage rate of any country in Europe (around 50 per 10,000 citizens [Hampshire 2008: 398]). In other words, there appears to have occurred in France a delayed reaction to the liberal gains achieved elsewhere over 30 years ago; it is my contention that this reaction is strikingly visible in the unprecedentedly high romcom output of the last 20 years. This sense of social backlash is visible in a certain ‘nervousness’ about romance in the French rom-com that is akin to a sensibility visible in North American culture in the 1970s. Indeed, a distinctive characteristic of the current trend is the prevalence of ‘dark’ elements, associable with both the melodramatic and realist traditions. Looking further back into French literary history sheds additional light on the texture of the contemporary film genre: importantly, a mistrust of\n\n7\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n8\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nlaughter is exemplified within France’s literary and especially dramatic canon by a bias towards narrative-based definitions of comedy (Frederick 1973; Greene 1977) and an adjuvant tendency to include relatively sober material within the category (see Neale and Krutnik 1990: 13–4). Moreover the tendency to mix comedy and drama is still in evidence in French film criticism today, through, for example, the prevalence of the label com´edie dramatique or dramatic comedy – much more common than the closest English-language equivalent comedy-drama (or occasionally dramedy). It is not by chance that when Geoff King (2002: 10) seeks to illustrate global comedy’s potentially melodramatic penchant, he invokes a French film, Serreau’s La Crise/The Crisis (1992). In rom-com, while Hollywood narratives from Sleepless in Seattle (Nora Ephron, USA 1993) to 500 Days of Summer (Marc Webb, USA 2009) are no strangers to melodrama – indeed its presence in the genre may even be on the increase in recent years ( Jeffers McDonald 2007: 85) – it is true that this mode appears to a striking extent as the default second register of the French genre. Se souvenir des belles choses/Beautiful Memories (Zabou Breitman, 2001) is a salient example of this tendency, with the romance being played out in the setting of a mental institution, between a woman with a degenerative brain disease and a man suffering from amnesia after accidentally killing his family. The rom-com’s traditional ‘happy ending’, with the man declaring his love, is undermined by the use of slow-motion and asynchronous sound to evoke the woman’s experience of his words as disconnected. Nonetheless the film’s rom-com identity is acknowledged by Rollet’s inclusion of it in a list of films of the current French cycle (2010). The force of recognising overtly incongruous elements as common in the French rom-com is to broaden the scope of the corpus I propose to analyse here. That is, while on the one hand a crop of films substantially different from predecessors appears in the national cinema in the 1990s and multiplies in the 2000s, it is simultaneously the case that my study relies on a flexible understanding of romcom itself. This creates space for the analysis of films not necessarily ostentatiously identifiable with the global label ‘rom-com’ in a highly self-conscious way alongside those that are: a two-pronged approach to probing the significance of films that engage with contemporary social reality around coupling culture in France. This is consonant with romcom studies globally, where heterogeneity characterises the genre at the\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsynchronic as well as the diachronic level. Pushing the boundaries of the genre in this way reveals the specific new directions being taken by its French version: what happens when the French rom-com a` l’am´ericaine is fully locally integrated, becoming rom-com a` la franc¸aise. To summarise, my interest in the French rom-com spans both purely generic contexts and the social – domains that bear on one another. A major line of enquiry for the research is concerned with the genre’s French specificity, including how this may evolve over the period and the extent to which the genre is naturalised and/or exported, with repercussions for understanding global film traffic. Thinking about the rom-com’s identity raises questions too about the stars who populate it and how we might assess its representational politics. Specifically, my statements about female authorship in the French genre, as well as the newness of privileging female subjectivity to any extent in national comedy, beg several further questions about exactly how the two genders are constructed in films. Is it appropriate to see the rom-com as a particularly feminised genre in France and, if so, in what sense? These questions transcend the simple issue of any split in focus and point of view between the genders, pairing this structural issue with analysis of both story arcs and specific narrative and aesthetic details. In this vein, how does the genre negotiate major contemporary social shifts, particularly those most obviously linked to gender? Notable here are the decline of marriage, the linked extension of singlehood and female autonomy and the increased range of acceptable gender roles today – particularly the rise of the professional woman, which in turn has profound implications for masculinity and for the family, a key unit of social organisation. Do films broadly reflect and embrace such shifts or do they resist, critique or downplay them, as comedy has often been accused of doing? Finally, how are the articulations of these questions inflected by considering production and reception contexts, including films’ status as auteur or mainstream fare – which suggest slightly different target audiences – as well as the issue of gendered authorship? By considering questions such as these and how their answers may evolve over the period in question, the study is centrally concerned with feminism – indeed, takes a feminist approach – while not being exclusively limited to such an optic. It ultimately hopes to pinpoint some of the ways in which the French rom-com has been mediating and shaping perceptions of many key social trends over the past two decades or so, both at home and globally.\n\n9\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n10\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nMethodology and Structure Given its focus on the relationship between film and society, this research walks a delicate line between textual and contextual detail, while pointing to links between the two. At the same time, within film analysis it seeks to strike a reasonable balance between picking out meta-trends across texts and the desire to be more than an encyclopaedic overview of a large body of films. This means it ranges from, on occasion, relatively scientific statements about narrative and aesthetic patterns, to fuller explorations of the possible implications for spectators of concrete textual constructions, the latter through both fairly extended analyses embedded in subsections and separate, even more thoroughgoing case studies of individual films. With respect to both these strategies, while I have already rejected the structuralist framework whereby narrative patterns equate to fixed textual meanings, and am closer to the approach of discourse analysis, with its central emphasis on polysemy and personal circumstances (such as being a female, UK-based researcher) bringing connotations to bear on interpretation (see Ali 2012), I nonetheless propose certain theoretical subject positions, or readings, for consumers of the films in question. Without suggesting such interpretations are the only possible options for viewers, certain popular texts characterised by a high degree of narrative explicitness do seem designed to elicit preferred or dominant readings (see Hall 1980). At the same time, my interpretations are supported by reference to production and especially reception data. The latter are privileged over the former because this analysis is more interested in how films interact with a range of viewers than in authorial intentions, and they typically take the form of press materials, since ethnographic audience studies – including even admissions figures broken down by age or gender – do not by and large exist in France. In other words, the analysis is at the interface of historical materialist and more purely theoretical, textually-based stances. In terms of organisation, the remainder of this book is divided into five chapters and concluding remarks. Chapter 1 surveys the principal directions taken by scholarship on romantic comedy and related genres, including via literary and cultural studies. It begins by examining relevant global scholarship in romance studies; it then discusses work from this context on filmed rom-com itself; next it\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nscrutinises francophone research on the French rom-com and related genres; and finally it returns to focusing once more on exogenous, anglophone perspectives, now on the contemporary French romcom itself. In Chapter 2, I begin examining the corpus itself, here by focusing on romance’s role in contemporary society, globally and especially in France. In the first half of the chapter, this involves putting romance into dialogue with other important societal shifts relating to demographic patterns and to identity in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, as they are negotiated by the French rom-com; in the second, I interrogate the ways in which romantic discourse itself has evolved in films of the corpus. Chapter 3 attempts to isolate the ways in which specific, gendered identities – that is, feminine, masculine and alternative positions – are configured by the genre and how such constructions may be determined by and bear on the roles deemed acceptable for and by French people today. In Chapter 4, I approach rom-com from the point of view of its articulation of concerns about the French family today: an archetypal topos of the domestic popular cinema. Finally, Chapter 5 places the French genre in a transnational context, both in the sense of interrogating in more detail its relation to Hollywood predecessors (both actual and perceived, including via a reception analysis focusing on reviews and other press relating to films) and also by probing its role in feeding back into transnational generic flows, and therefore mass consciousness. It might be noted that the study thus follows a circular logic at both macro and micro levels of structuration. Not only does it track the appropriation and then re-export of a foreign genre by France, but its apprehension of films’ role in reflecting and feeding back into social norms underpins comparable dynamics within several individual chapters. As for the concluding remarks section, this both draws together findings and briefly considers the contribution to these of films that have appeared since the period of the research was concluded at the end of 2000s – a less than four year interlude during which the genre has multiplied beyond all expectations, such that every week the new crop of films in theatres appears to include at least one rom-com. Regarding periodisation, it is worth noting that my choice of individual case studies for this book reflects the fact that it is at the end of the 1990s and especially post-2000 that the home-grown rom-com really begins to take off in France. These studies also illustrate the way in\n\n11\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n12\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nwhich box-office data is an important criterion, but not the only one, for singling out films for analysis. Thus while Amelie and L’Arnacœur were huge global hits, La Bˆuche/Season’s Beatings (Dani`ele Thompson, 1999) was a more modest, largely domestic success. This is partly because I am also interested in generic development itself: an evolution whose interrelation with wider culture is complex. For example, texts with smaller audiences can still make great impact on film culture and therefore influence other directors in ways that filter down into broader patterns. The growth of the home-video market has also attenuated the importance of box-office figures. Finally, it is also the case that a poor box-office performance can be telling about social attitudes. For all these reasons, films have in general been chosen for more sustained analysis through a combination of considering their impact in a quantitative way but also for the relevance of the themes they explore and indeed the different market positions they occupy – within a broadly popular framework, seeking to counterbalance academia’s prioritisation of art cinema. All the same, auteur films are far from ignored: examples like V´enus Beaut´e (Institut)/Venus Beauty Salon (Tonie Marshall, 1999), Quand la mer monte/When the Sea Rises (Yolande Moreau and Gilles Porte, 2004) and Les Chansons d’amour/Love Songs (Christophe Honor´e 2007), to name just a handful, receive considerable attention in various places, in part because of their possible influence within the industry and their prominence in cinephilic culture, as well as the crossover appeal they may have, including due to winning prizes. In any case, admissions figures are provided for all films included in the appended filmography of rom-coms 1990–2010. Finally, a note on bibliographical and filmographical references. In the first case, while source details throughout the book are as complete as possible, a number of daily and weekly press references do not indicate a page number. This is because they were obtained from the database at Bifi (Biblioth`eque du Film) in which the scanning of articles has deleted page numbers. Readers wishing to consult the full articles are directed to the Bifi Library (51 rue de Bercy, 75012 – Paris), which offers fast and convenient online access to the material. The Bnf, Biblioth`eque Nationale de France (Site Franc¸ois-Mitterrand, Quai Franc¸ois-Mauriac, 75013 – Paris) holds full issues of the papers. For film references, within the text I have opted, the first time a film is mentioned, to give the full French title and English translation where available, along with director details and year of production.\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe country of production is included only when this is not France (or France in combination with others).

As we shall see, however, the chapter’s central theme is the deprecation of rom-com as an object worthy of study and its consequent scholarly neglect, globally and in France particularly.\n\nRomantic Comedy in a Global Context There are reasons to believe that romantic comedy as a genre may be especially well equipped to negotiate external cultural developments. As Roberta Garrett has recently observed in a discussion of the contemporary global genre, over the years key rom-com studies have offered ‘a degree of critical consensus [ . . . ] concerning the historical specificity of and formal distinctions between cycles such as the early comedy of remarriage (1920s–1930s), the screwball comedy (1930s–1940s), the sex-comedy (1950s–1960s) and the nervous romance (1970s)’ (2007: 96). In other words, throughout its theorisations rom-com has typically been seen as by definition a genre dealing with the shifts in gender roles and relations that have occurred during different periods. To understand why, we must look beyond the cinema to literary and cultural studies scholarship on comedy and romance.\n\nLiterary and Cultural Studies Approaches The comic component of the rom-com’s identity is important in understanding the genre’s social relevance. A running theme of the 14\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nmany and diverse literary theories of comedy put forward since the Classical period is the latter’s essentially social status and import. This relevance is perhaps most obvious when it comes to satire. In France, critiques of contemporary regimes, philosophies and mores by writers like Voltaire and Diderot are exemplary. But even the most seemingly trivial jokes frequently rely on immediate context for their import. Freud himself, often accused of an ahistorical bent, cannot avoid tying his discussion of the varying conditions in which innuendo might occur to social class, historical era and especially gender, when he designates certain jokes a way of oppressing women (Freud 2002: 96–7). If context is all-important when it comes to comedy, comedy can be profoundly revealing about the social world in which it is produced. Not only does ‘comic insulation’ (Palmer 1987: 45) – the protective layer afforded by comedy’s apparent frivolousness – allow it to broach topics that might be taboo in more ‘serious’ registers; comedy in fact tends to accumulate around such sites of difficulty or anxiety, as jokes exploit the tension generated by these. This makes comic texts potent mediators of a society’s norms and values, both official and internalised. As for romance, this term presents a dualistic profile, as both cultural and fictional narrative. The ubiquity with which the notion of romantic love appears in recent Western fiction is certainly a measure of its enduringly irresistible allure. As observed in a study of literary romance in twentieth-century France, despite the cultural shift away from marriage towards ‘more sequential and complex family structures’, an investment in love as a mutual commitment based on passionate desire and affinity is a major feature of contemporary culture (Holmes 2006: 115). So much so that, as global rom-com scholar Deleyto puts it, ‘we have forgotten that [romance] is [ . . . ] an “invention” of a group of Provenc¸al poets at the end of the eleventh century’ (Deleyto 2003: 167). His discussions here and elsewhere (2009a; Evans and Deleyto 1998) focus on this discourse’s capacity for adapting to circumstance, as is apparent in various other interventions on the subject (see for example Foucault 1981; Giddens 1992; Pearce and Stacey 1995: 12). Michel Foucault’s work as a whole has emphasised the way in which even the most apparently ‘unreal’ (one meaning of romantic in common parlance) stories feed into dominant attitudes, while sociologist of romance Anthony Giddens (1992: 45) – moving away from Foucault’s stress on the overpowering and totalitarian nature of the ideas and models circulated by discourse – has suggested that it is narrative’s\n\n15\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n16\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nvery fictional status that may allow its consumer to use it consciously as a hypothetical model. Certainly it is often within the field of romance that apposite examples of the influence of ostentatiously contrived fiction upon the social world present themselves. To cite one, historians generally agree that novels were the principal means by which a romantic conception of marriage became widespread in nineteenth-century North America (May 1980: 75–6) – the same tendency satirised contemporaneously in France by Flaubert’s Madame Bovary (2002 [1856]). In contemporary French cinema, the realisation that ‘romanticism and realism can co-exist at different levels of our subjectivities’ ( Jackson 1995: 56) is already a hallmark of many auteur films and is particularly highly visible in the contemporary tendency towards imaginative ‘autofiction’ in films by female directors from Ma¨ıwenn to Mia Hansen-Løve, as well as in many rom-coms.1 Romantic fiction’s potential power to infiltrate cultural discourse has not always predisposed it to enthusiastic scholarly or critical appreciation, any more than has comedy’s superficially light-hearted approach to serious subjects. Instead, the rom-com has suffered as a genre from being written off as irrelevant or pernicious, sometimes both at the same time. This is inextricable from the prejudice operating towards most forms of popular diversion as ‘only entertainment’ (Dyer 1992) – especially genres perceived as ‘feminine’, as part of misogynistic currents operating in patriarchal society. In some ways paradoxically, though, second-wave feminism has been pivotal in shaping critical attitudes to the romance genre for several decades in the postwar period, condemning narratives which tend to idealise the heterosexual couple as a tool of patriarchal oppression (see for example Beauvoir, 2004 [1949]; Millet 1969; Firestone 1979 [1971]; Greer 1971). However, works like the literary studies of Tania Modleski (1990 [1982]) and Janice Radway (1991 [1987]), or Ien Ang’s (1985) influential study of the pleasures of viewing the soap opera Dallas, have subsequently rehabilitated romance as a forum for women to explore their identities, emotional lives and life experiences. Such work does not overlook the limitations arguably imposed by the happy ending around coupling constructed by the traditional romance (a point to which I shall return), reasserting the universal law of kinship and a power structure in which woman has always been subordinate; hence Radway concludes that for women romance represents ‘a minimal but nonetheless legitimate form of protest’ (1991: 222).\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nA similar battle over the progressive or revisionist status of femaleoriented romance has been waged in the post-feminist period around the phenomena of ‘chick-lit’, ‘chick television’ and ‘chick-flicks’. Scholars such as Yvonne Tasker and especially Diane Negra (2004; 2008; Tasker and Negra 2007) have suggested that within these genres, whose current manifestations are thought to have proliferated following the success of the British novel Bridget Jones’ Diary (Fielding 1996; see Ferriss and Young 2006: 5), any positive value for female viewers is severely attenuated, in ways that are bound up with the centrality of romance to chick texts. Other analysts of chick culture have placed more emphasis on the substantial pleasures and specific forms of empowerment such narratives offer to female consumers (Ferriss and Young 2008a: 4). Notably, several commentators on the global blockbuster book, television and film series Sex and the City have foregrounded its celebration of female desire and friendship (Henry 2004; Akass and McCabe 2004; Jermyn 2009). While it is undeniable that rom-coms are structurally predisposed towards endorsing heterosexual coupling, and I agree with the view that many post-feminist fictions promote values that are disempowering for a broad spectrum of women, my own position with regard to the politics of romantic comedy is in some respects closer to these latter studies. I seek in any case to interrogate the variegated and complex stories of the French rom-coms under examination in order to assess fully their textual and contextual specificity and historical inscription.\n\nRom-Com as a Cinematic Genre The Sex and the City film franchise provides a prime example of texts around which critical discourse has tended to conflate as more or less synonymous the chick-flick and the rom-com (see Mortimer 2010: 1). While both of these epithets infantilise and trivialise the associative resonances of the films to which they refer through their perky, monosyllabic rhymes, chick-flicks are even more likely to be written off as of limited interest. The film genre designated by these terms brings with it a specific history of cinematic studies. As suggested, critical denigration and neglect have also pervaded scholarship in this area, perhaps even more than in the case of written romance. This situation is in part a function of the culturally illegitimate status of comedy within staged fiction as a whole, which Moine (2002: 17\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n18\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\n27–8) has in France dated back to Aristotle’s designation of it as a low form. In film studies, though, further double standards apply. Firstly, earlier comedy has been the subject of considerably more literature than more recent texts. This may be partly ascribable to the fact that social relevance becomes easier to pick out with hindsight. Kristina Brunovska Karnick and Henry Jenkins (1995: 2) have also pointed out the facility with which comedy, frequently defined by an infantile, ludic quality, becomes a site for nostalgia, perhaps further influencing scholars’ positive attitudes towards comedy of past eras. Additionally, biases in favour of auteurs mean that figures like Buster Keaton or Jacques Tati (who directed as well as starred in their films, a less common tendency in today’s vertically integrated era) receive the most praise and attention from both critics and scholars. Within rom-com studies specifically (and probably talking comedy as a whole), it is certainly rom-coms of the classical ‘screwball’ era that have received the greatest attention in film studies. This cycle of films has been the subject of studies by Stanley Cavell (1981), Wes Gehring (1986), Bruce Babington and Peter William Evans (1989), Tina Olsin Lent (1995), Kathrina Glitre (2001), David R. Shumway (2003b) and others, with some generic inventories privileging only this version of romantic comedy (see for example Schatz 1981: 150–85). These analyses bring out the rom-com genre’s heterogeneity, since within merely one cycle an umbrella term has brought together films as diverse as didactic social comedy Sullivan’s Travels (Preston Sturges, USA 1941) and domestic farce Adam’s Rib (George Cukor, USA 1949), through features ranging from a utopian dissolution of class divisions (ibid) to the promotion of play as an expression of intimacy, reflecting new, post-Victorian ideals of companionate love (Lent 1995; Ruiz Pardos 2000) and a concomitant loosening of restrictions on female freedom, both within texts and through the rise of a slew of actresses to billing on an equal footing with men (Gehring 1986: 5; Rowe 1995: 146; Sarris 1998: 98). Scholarship on more recent rom-com is equally varied but sparser. These features speak respectively to the lack of critical consensus over the contemporary genre’s definition, and its typical status as an object worthy of cultural suspicion and scorn. However, some scholars, in attempting to identify the rom-com, accord relative centrality to the possibility of increased equality across the two genders in the genre’s structural focus. In contrast, many scholars writing from feminist and\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nother perspectives about cinematic romance in general (as in literary studies) have focused on the happy ending of the Hollywood romance as more or less forcing conservative ideologies upon its viewers (Fischer 1989: 243; Neale and Krutnik 1990: 145). While this overstatement was most common in the wake of 1970s post-structuralist-influenced theory, it has subsequently been seriously challenged through the expansion of cultural studies in the 1990s and the move to return agency, historical contingency and social identity to the film viewer. The fact that the happy ending is still commonly associated with rom-coms – Classical definitions of comedy, after all, hinge upon this feature – has allowed negative attitudes to persist; for instance, Rollet’s article on the French rom-com sees the global format in terms of a narrative structure based on obstacles to overcoming supposedly inevitable union, to which she attributes an ‘implicitly reactionary ideology’ (2008: 94). Yet not only has work in film studies emulated the move elsewhere to interrogate romance for the pleasures it can offer female audiences (Stacey 1990) (as Rollet acknowledges [2008: 96]), but Rowe (1995: 8) has defended the rom-com in spite of its default ending, drawing on Mulvey’s (1985) essay ‘Changes: Thoughts on Myth, Narrative and Historical Experience’, in which (revising earlier statements) she suggests that the importance of narrative’s potential lies not in its final resolution but in the upheaval that precedes this. There is evidence this may be particularly true for comedies, given the fact that these films are frequently sold on their humorous moments, as opposed to story elements (King 2002: 87). Similarly, many comedies acquire a cult status that involves repeated viewing and a focus not so much on the ending as on particular sequences. In any case, as I will illustrate, the centrality of the happy ending to romantic comedy has been exaggerated and it is certainly of limited usefulness for the contemporary French genre. Returning to the question of how to conceive rom-com beyond ideology, most incisive is Deleyto’s 2009 The Secret Life of Romantic Comedy, in which he argues for a re-envisioning of genre as a whole and rom-com in particular in terms not, as traditionally, of belonging, but of participation. Borrowing from a wide range of sources including George Lakoff ’s cognitive theory of categories, chaos theory and most importantly Jacques Derrida’s theory of genre, Deleyto argues convincingly for an approach to genre that is both more ambiguous and more pervasive than those traditionally taken in film studies. In\n\n19\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nhis model, all texts can be seen to participate in one or several genres, without these generic affiliations providing the limits of their definition (Deleyto 2009a: 1–17). Deleyto is equally eloquent on the importance of this wide-ranging approach for analysing rom-com. As he notes, of all genres this one is frequently held up as the most trivial and crassly commercial: he cites a recent Sight and Sound review referring to ‘a conviction-free romantic comedy aimed at the teen market’ (ibid: 2), while a definition of romantic comedy as ‘the most vile, insipid, sanity-destroyingly horrible genre in the history of cinema’ thrown up by an internet search on the urbandictionary.com site is equally typical and even more vitriolic. This definition goes on to illustrate the misogynistic association between women and strands of popular culture viewed as execrable, by suggesting that ‘[the rom-com] exists solely for the entertainment of obnoxious, highly sentimental housewives who feel that their gender must consign them to this terrible fate’.2 More relevant to Deleyto’s argument, though, is its citation of consistency of formula as one of the negative features of rom-com. This exemplifies his claim that the rom-com is the victim of a circular argument whereby it is seen to be typified only by those highly conventional films including the most conservative perspectives and therefore it is designated the most conventional and conservative genre. Instead, he argues: The genre of rom-com can [ . . . ] be seen as the intersection of three, closely interrelated elements: a narrative that articulates historically and culturally specific views of love, desire, sexuality and gender relationships; a space of transformation and fantasy which influences the narrative articulation of those discourses; and humour as the specific perspective from which the fictional characters, their relationships and the spectator’s response to them are constructed as embodiments of those discourses (ibid: 45–6).\n\nDeleyto goes on in the same passage to explain that the breadth of this definition illustrates why so many films use rom-com conventions, without necessarily being primarily identifiable with the genre, and that even the absence of one of these features does not necessarily invalidate the appropriateness of the paradigm. In stressing generic hybridity, within film studies Deleyto’s approach is comparable to the new genre criticism of writers including Richard Maltby and also – as he recognises (ibid: 5–6) – Neale and especially Rick Altman. Such models complement his own by focusing on the 20\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nfunctioning of various genres within one film. At the same time, Deleyto goes beyond these theorists’ work in seeing genre as primarily an analytical tool. Providing a kind of limit case for genre itself, this paradigm might appear to beg the question of the appropriateness of delimiting the corpus examined here in generic terms at all, given the wide sweep of texts I will be referencing. It is true that the choice of films discussed in these pages – along with the wider rom-com filmography of the period provided – while not arbitrary, proceeds from a number of informed choices and cannot claim to be an exhaustive enumeration of French films of the period that use romcom conventions. The filmography, instead, lists films of the period under analysis in relation to which the rom-com analytical toolbox proves particularly useful.\n\nRomantic Comedy in France Romantic Comedy in French Film Studies In France, not only is there no branch of film studies equivalent to the originally Anglo-American category of genre studies, but romantic comedy specifically has been seen as simply nonexistent in national filmmaking until very recently. Yet, given the broad understanding of rom-com offered in this chapter, one could in fact argue for approaching many pre-1990 French films from the perspective of the ´ genre. Salient candidates might include the Belle Epoque films of the late 1940s and the 1950s directed by Jacqueline Audry and others, usually considered costume dramas in the tradition de qualit´e, whose critical neglect has been signalled by Genevi`eve Sellier (2005) and more recently Hayward (2010); some New Wave films – especially those which are less well-known like Les Jeux de l’amour/The Games of Love (Philippe de Broca, 1960) and Ce soir ou jamais/Tonight or Never (Michel Deville, 1961), also analysed by Sellier (2010) from the classic rom-com perspective of their negotiation of anxiety about female emancipation, but also some films by Franc¸ois Truffaut and even JeanLuc Godard; and a number of other films from the 1960s to the 1990s by, in addition to de Broca and Deville, such directors as Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Jacques Demy and Eric Rohmer (see Harrod 2014).3 Such scholarly lacunae are inseparable from the snobbery around genre in general and comedy in particular that exists in many French cinephilic institutions. This is partly bound up with the ongoing legacy 21\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n22\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nof both realist (see Hayward 2005: 98) and auteurist models there (see for example Pr´edal 1993: 54). Regarding the former, the status of filmic realism as itself reliant on formal and other conventions is now almost truistic in global film studies (see Hallam and Marshment 2000: 97–121). In any case, stylisation and blatant contrivance have already been shown to be exceptionally poor indicators of fictional texts’ interrelation with and bearing on the external world. As for the promotion of individual, idiosyncratic auteur styles, originally by the New Wave, it is easy to see how this clashes with the appeal to familiarity on which narrower conceptions of genre rest – despite the centrality of genre filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock in elegiac New Wave writings about Hollywood. Moine (2002: 7) further constellates the rejection of genre with a general Gallic tendency to divorce films from their context. Indeed social relevance, especially gendered, is a facet routinely neglected by aesthetically-oriented work even on relatively popular auteurs like Demy, Truffaut or Rohmer. Romantic comedy is likely to suffer at the hands of critics bent on abstraction, notwithstanding the potentially more ‘universal’ elements of romantic discourse, because of its simultaneous, often comic, appeal to specific cultural knowledge. Nor is bias against comedy limited to academics in France. For instance, the genre is frequently excluded from prestigious film awards like the Palme d’Or and the C´esars. One particularly striking omission concerns the fate of 2008 smash hit comedy Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis. Despite attaining the record for the highest grossing French film ever in France, the film was almost absent from the C´esars (and certainly from the even more unapologetically art cinema-oriented Cannes awards). In rom-com, it is more often those films positioned at the auteurist end of the spectrum, usually involving some stylistic experimentation – and often more consonant with a realist or melodramatic mode than with comedy – that achieve greater recognition. Exemplary are the C´esars won by bitter-sweet, naturalistic ensemble piece V´enus Beaut´e (Institut) (Best Film, Best Director, Best Writing and Most Promising Actress for Audrey Tautou) or understated but intermittently visually surreal romance Quand la mer monte (Best Actress for Yolande Moreau, who also directed the film). Such prejudice is further replicated transnationally through distribution: even at London’s Institut Franc¸ais, whose film library is used primarily by Gallic expatriates for home entertainment, auteur films are more likely to be stocked than truly popular fare.\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nA further reason for hostility towards rom-com specifically emerges from this research: its original association with the USA. As Darren Waldron and Isabelle Vanderschelden (2007: 8) have argued, suspicious attitudes towards popular cinema have only been exacerbated in recent years by a French critical tendency among cinephilic critics, such as Jean-Michel Frodon in articles in Cahiers du cin´ema from 2005 onwards, to equate commercial filmmaking with ‘a multifaceted crisis’ linked to inflated production costs and shorter cinema runs. The spectre of Hollywood looms large behind this negative perception of so-called multiplex culture. This negativity is itself partly a question of France’s relatively Leftist politics; in any case the nation has a long history of cultural and trade disputes with the USA centred on the cinema. Pascal Ory (1989) has shown how postwar Franco-centrism developed in the 1980s into cultural-centrism. Lucy Mazdon (2000: 6–8) has moreover charted the way in which a French tendency since World War II to use the US as a foil against which to define itself led, through the issue of culture, to a mobilisation of anti-American discourses, in particular around the 1993 GATT trade agreements, in which cinema featured prominently. At the same time, conversely, as Moine (2002: 27) has also noted, the elevation of comedy from other countries is another not uncommon discourse (see for example Aud´e 1989). Rom-com directors including Ernst Lubitsch and Howard Hawks were prominent among those Hollywood genre filmmakers venerated by the politique des auteurs and US rom-coms are still sometimes championed by the French press where domestic ones are not. This situation appears illogical in a context where the possibility of defining French cinema in any sense against Hollywood is complicated by the fact that: The practice of combining generic features drawn from a national cultural tradition with a form, references and generic paradigms that are at least perceived as belonging to a globalised neo-Hollywood model, constitutes one of the defining tendencies of contemporary French popular cinema. (Moine 2007a: 36)\n\nKing has further pointed out that the global dominance, since the Great War, of Hollywood comedy makes it difficult to pinpoint distinctly national dimensions, ‘so strongly has the Hollywood version become associated with the fundamentals of the form’ (2002: 164). This is 23\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n24\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nalso true of rom-com, which has been perceived as quintessentially American, thanks partially to the US’ place at the forefront of the move towards gender equality. Another major perceived threat to indigenous cinematic quality via popular output is television. Well-known scholar Ren´e Pr´edal’s work is exemplary, asserting that the small screen is ‘contaminating’ and ‘sucking the lifeblood’ from a cinema already beleaguered by ‘the hegemony of US production’ (2008a: 36; see also Sorlin 2005). And once again such prejudices are likely to apply in great measure to (romantic) comedy, since a high proportion of not only artists but also filmmakers have moved into this genre from the arena of television in France in recent decades (Rollet 2010). These are often women, including such commercially successful figures as Val´erie Guignabodet (Mariages!, 2 million tickets sold), Isabelle Mergault (Je vous trouve tr`es beau, 3.4 million) and Lisa Azuelos (LOL [Laughing Out Loud], 3.6 million). The latter observation reflects the fact that many of the same cultural biases rampant in global discourses around rom-com apply in French film studies. The fact that women often come to popular filmmaking in France through television speaks to their exclusion from high French cinephilic culture (see Vincendeau 1987: 9), adding specific appeal to popular genres for them. Indeed, the final nail in the coffin for any specifically French history of romantic comedy studies has been the absence of cultural and gender studies as distinct disciplines in French academic institutions. While I have suggested that it is within this framework that many analyses of the genre have emerged in anglophone contexts, no equivalent has existed in France until very recently – despite the contributions of France-based scholars like Beauvoir, Emmanuel Levinas, H´el`ene Cixous, Monique Wittig, Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray to theories of gender. This bespeaks conservative attitudes towards the issue, explaining the absence of references not only to rom-com but also to romance itself even in books dealing specifically with genre in a French context (see Rollet 2008: 93). It is important to note, however, that in the past two decades gradual changes have slowly begun to emerge in French scholarship. Moine’s pioneering contribution to contemporary global and French genre studies is undoubtedly the most significant body of French scholarship\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nrelevant to this study – alongside, less directly, Sellier’s cultural studies approaches to French cinema of earlier decades. Moine’s extended studies (2002; 2005a) are highly significant in eroding longstanding boundaries – notably the opposition of auteur and popular cinema itself, as problematised by her (2005b) essay examining the emergence of the label com´edie d’auteur, or auteur comedy, in the national press in the early 1990s. Such iconoclastic, cultural studies-informed approaches are also in evidence in the work of French scholars who write in both French and English, including, in addition to Rollet, Vanderschelden and Vincendeau. All these scholars’ contributions to critical thought are helping to bridge the chasm that has, over the years, separated some aspects of French and anglophone critical thought.\n\nFrench Romantic Comedy in Anglophone Film Studies Despite the large body of anglophone work on French cinema, it is still the case that here too a very small proportion has focused on rom-coms or even comedies, with medium-brow genres like the thriller or the heritage film more likely to come under scrutiny.4 As Jenny Lau has noted, ‘the analysis of comedy is an exceptionally difficult task because the recognition of humour depends heavily upon understanding of the complex dynamics involved in the interaction of the symbolic, such as gestures and icons, linguistics and so on, which are defined by their own social and cultural tradition’ (quoted in King 2002: 156). Equally, despite recent rom-com exports, the local referentiality of stars and narrative situations remains a barrier to popular cinema’s international exhibition, alongside French cinema’s ‘arty’ image (see Palmer 2011: 54, 117–20). Add to this global prejudices against rom-com, and the paucity of anglophone scholarship on the French genre comes as no real surprise. By contrast, the French grotesque tradition has been one area accorded some interest in comedy, typically distracting attention from the gendered aspects of humorous film narratives (for example Gordon 2001). This blindness is frequently linked to the male buddy duos which are prevalent in national comedy (see for example Forbes 1992a: 177–84; Harris 1997), in that such a focus tends to ignore buddy films’ generally sexist portrayal of female characters, who are objectified almost as a rule. It does, though, incorporate a degree 25\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n26\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nof interest in the importance of stardom to comedy, picked up in the 2000s by Vanderschelden (2005), examining beur actors’ increased opportunities for substantial success in the genre. Here the rom-com has contributed to the trend, with example cases including Moroccanborn Gad Elmaleh and to a lesser extent the half-Algerian Dany Boon, who – along with Gallic rom-coms stars like Alain Chabat and Edouard Baer – are among the highest paid French actors. The fact that all these actors are also stand-up comics illustrates intersections between romantic and comedian comedy. Indeed, the space the genre creates for women is particularly significant in light of comic theory’s stress on the cultural power of joke-makers. Of course, comedians’ status is subject to considerable variation even within films clearly built around their performance, notably depending on their involvement in the screenwriting and directorial process, and the linked balance between their characters’ construction as either teller or butt of the joke, or between the combination ‘identification and distanciation’ (Neale and Krutnik 1990: 149) typically identifiable with comedy. But in general the accession to a position of relative (discursive) power of groups – notably women – traditionally seen to be disenfranchised within patriarchy is a remarkable and positive development (see Tarr with Rollet 2001: 166–7). The same understanding of jokes has led to many comic theorists noting that one of the major ways in which social groups define themselves is through shared humour, in turn suggesting why the issue of inherited comic forms may be a particularly sensitive one in a nation with a great comic heritage, where the perception of national culture under threat is widespread. It is significant, too, that French culture is often seen as menaced specifically by the USA, the same nation from which the rom-com notionally hails. In this genre, nationalism is a clear candidate for the ‘other less orthodox satisfactions’ of identity for which Frank Krutnik (2002: 142) and others have argued the genre can be an alibi. For all these reasons, the rom-com’s significance for French identity, conceived either nationally or transnationally, is a master theme of this study. It is therefore appropriate to conclude this survey by citing an analysis of French rom-com from a US perspective. The genre is present in all but name in observations by Suzanne Ferriss and Mallory Young about the development of a new European form of romantic chick flick, following the Anglo-American ‘prescriptions’ for such\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANTIC COMEDY – AND ITS DISCONTENTS\n\nfilms. Interestingly, while for Ferriss and Young the pertinence of the anglophone paradigm resides in ‘a far more sanguine view of love’ than that of European forebears, ‘with surprisingly feel-good endings’, these scholars suggest the ‘European’ contribution discernible in their examples is the element of naturalism This study also provides a welcome, industrially-informed overview of movements in European cinema and specifically the disintegration of the old perceived dichotomy between European art versus US commerce, due to the transnational influence of not only Hollywood but also American indie culture, as well as the mass-crossing of European ‘talent’ to North America and the surprisingly high volume of European films receiving wide US distribution (Ferriss and Young 2008b: 176–7). This chapter thus contains the germ of my own key concern: to consider the specificity of the French rom-com while understanding its ultimately markedly transnational position – and in particular positioning.\n\n27\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\n2 Romance Today In this chapter I attempt to place what is broadly understood by the notion of romantic love more fully in its contemporary French context, as it is manifested in and through romantic comedy. I begin in the first section by examining those influences on the genre that might be seen as exogenous, in other words aspects of social change that remain relatively separable from perceptions of love relationships for couples per se, but that nonetheless impact on them in various ways. Grouped together under the umbrella concept of today’s ‘cold climate’, these include new living arrangements (and specifically the move away from community and family that has gathered pace, especially in urban conglomerations, since the Industrial Revolution), as well as the ‘dehumanisation’ of work in the post-Fordist era and the effects of new technologies on courting rituals. Secondly, such changes encompass the far-reaching effects of the so-called death of God, as well as the more recent rise of Allah, on attitudes towards coupling. In the latter half of the chapter I examine the French rom-com’s interaction with changes that have been more fully internalised in ideas circulating around love and relationships themselves. Here the term ‘post-romance’ designates the complex nexus of discourses, both incorporating and transcending traditional romantic ideas, that inform contemporary notions of the couple and of intimate relations between its members.\n\nLove in a Cold Climate1 If, as proclaimed by Anna Gavalda’s best-selling 2004 novel and its C´esar-winning 2007 film version, ‘togetherness is everything’ 28\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANCE TODAY\n\n(Ensemble, c’est tout), then post-modern life, with its increasingly fragmented social organisation, is teetering on the brink of the abyss. The re-imagining of space since modernity has been a major focus of academic enquiry over the last half-century or so. Post-modern histories and theorisations of changes to the organisation of social space chart the way in which urban living’s challenge to traditional community structures has accelerated since the 1980s, largely due to the technical revolution, an idea popularised by the metaphor of the global village. In conjunction with the changes such developments have wrought in the world of work, this spatial reconfiguration has meant that face-toface physical encounters are ever rarer and anonymous communication has become normalised. The perceived resulting disintegration of interpersonal relationships has been a major focus of recent Western fiction as a whole, notably in the strain of social realism prominent in French auteur cinema of the 1990s, associated with such directors as Robert Gu´ediguian, Erick Zonca and Bruno Dumont. It is also remarkable that in an increasingly mobile world, romantic relationships have themselves gained considerable significance as a determinant of living arrangements, in contrast with parental and familial links. As for the decline of religion in the West, while this predates the rise of urbanism, it is the combination of the two that has, arguably, left many human beings consigned to solitude, adrift in a cold modern world. This has clear repercussions for the status of romance today, most obviously providing a compelling explanation for the discourse’s increasing cultural prestige. Thus, in a French context, philosopher Gilles Lipovetsky (1993: 316) describes the (post-)modern ‘era of emptiness’ in terms of ‘individualism a` la carte, hedonistic and psychological, elevating intimate fulfilment to the highest goal of existence’. The comforting presences of both God and community have, in other words, both been replaced by The One, placing huge stress on the love relationship. This is reflected, too, by legislation: in France, the 1999 PaCS (Pacte Civil de Solidarit´e) laws – a milestone in the history of romantic unions in a Catholic country – ratified desire alone as a sufficient basis for a relationship (Holmes 2006: 115).2 Additionally, since the events of 9/11 mobilised the possibilities of the shrinking world to annihilative ends, there has been something of a resurgence of interest in religion, notably Islam, but secondarily, in response to this, perhaps also in Christianity (Wheatley 2014). Indirect though their relationship to cinematic romance may seem, these new developments\n\n29\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\ntoo are making their mark in different ways on the French romantic comedy.\n\nPost-Industrial Pairings The loneliness of singlehood is a subtext of many contemporary romcoms and French examples are no exception. In several cases, this is directly premised on fragmented urban lifestyles; and typically, it is women who are perceived as suffering most from the disintegration of interpersonal structures in post-industrial life. At the same time, urban solitude goes hand in hand with urban freedom and the rom-com also evidences recognition of the new opportunities for romance afforded by life in post-industrial cities. The genre thus frequently envisions the metropolis as a playground of possibilities, typically peopled by what Elle magazine journalist Doroth´ee Werner (1996) has described as a perpetually infantilised twenty-something (and now perhaps also thirty-something) generation. The preeminent, early example of this form of thematically highly post-modern rom-com, also setting up a number of specific subtrends associated with such an optic, is Am´elie. For this reason and in view of its probable role in catalysing the romcom’s French appropriation (see Rollet 2008: 92), I have chosen to open this chapter’s more text-based section by analysing it in detail.\n\nCase Study: Le Fabuleux destin d’Am´elie Poulain/Amelie ( Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001) Directed by crossover popular/auteur director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who was until then known for fantastic, visually sumptuous collaborations with Marc Caro, Le Fabuleux destin d’Am´elie Poulain was by and large French-funded, including through contributions from television channels Canal + and France 3. Drawing over 8.5 million spectators into French cinemas and taking more than $33 million at the US box office alone, the globally distributed mega-hit at home represented not just a financial success but a social phenomenon. Despite sparking considerable critical controversy thanks to a now infamous article by Inrockuptibles editor Serge Kaganski accusing it of promoting a socially and ethnically cleansed vision of France (Kaganski 2001), the iconic Parisian rom-com was embraced by politicians across the spectrum, who publicly declared their love for the film and organised personal 30\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANCE TODAY\n\nscreenings of it (Vincendeau 2001: 22). So influential was Am´elie perceived to be, in fact, it has been credited, by a feature in Biba magazine, with leading to a communitarian tendency in French cities like Paris and Lyon, through the establishment of residents’ associations and the resurgence of small-scale local commerce in the wake of its release (see Austin 2008: 160). Since rom-com was not yet recognised as an indigenous genre in France in 2001, French reviewers and commentators – unlike those in the US and Britain, including in readily available online critiques – did not describe the film in such terms, and nor have any of the various scholarly articles (including Rosello 2002; Scatton-Tessier 2004; Ezra 2004; Moore 2006; Morrissey 2008; Bazgan 2010) and one book (Vanderschelden 2007) dedicated to the film considered it substantially from a generic perspective. Nonetheless, Am´elie is a romantic fairy-tale set in a digitally reconstructed Paris, in which the eponymous female protagonist actively seeks out apparently blissful fusion with an idealised (she has never spoken to him) love object, pornographic DVD rental shop employee Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz). The couple are finally paired atop a scooter for a final sequence whose grainy, home-video look, upbeat music and fast editing style encode ebullient happiness: ‘[as] the end of the film [ . . . ] brings the hitherto star-crossed lovers together, the sheer predictability of their union, the “fabulous”, storybook fulfilment of Amelie’s “destin”, recalls the ending of countless Hollywood films’ (Ezra 2004: 309). The film has, however, simultaneously been correctly identified as ‘well anchored in its socio-historical and cinematic period, exploiting the same issues of loneliness and isolation found in recent French new social cinema’ (Scatton-Tessier 2004: 197). This is most obvious in the narrator’s account of loner Amelie’s cold upbringing, during which her increased heartbeat due to excitement during a physical examination by her emotionally distant doctor father leads to mistaken fears about a heart condition and a cloistered, subdued childhood which has left her inept at relating to others. More generally, the voiceover and dialogue emphasise language’s limited power to reveal people. Hence the narrator’s method of introducing characters by a list of dislikes and dislikes, or a scene in which Amelie’s colleague Gina acquaints herself with Nino via the nonspecific verbiage of proverbs, while Amelie’s father is explicitly depicted as asking her the same old questions and failing to listen to her. Visually, too, Jeunet’s use of crane shots as\n\n31\n\nP1: WQS\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\nFigure 1.

It is the desire to overcome this alienation that propels the plot’s trajectory towards romantic union. In other words, the film subscribes to the rom-com format epitomised by When Harry Met Sally, where romance is prescribed first and foremost as a bulwark against loneliness. Amelie’s solitude is portrayed as deriving in large measure from fragmented post-modern, paradigmatically urban, life. The failure of her own family to nurture her emotionally (also due to her mother’s untimely death) is figuratively extended to Nino’s experience by an ironic interjection in relation to the latter’s habit of putting back together passport-style photos ripped up and discarded by strangers and collecting them in an album. Thus the narrator recounts Amelie’s reaction to this curiosity as, ‘Some family album!’. Indeed, families as a whole are conspicuous by their absence (Morrissey 2008: 107). More generally, the film is explicitly nostalgic for the extended community of Montmartre it depicts as in decline: Amelie’s plots to improve the lives of those around her represent a refusal to accept compartmentalised living of the kind graphically illustrated by shots of her and other inhabitants of her apartment building engaged in everyday activities, simultaneously but on their own [Figure 1]. Wendy Everett has for her part described Am´elie as ‘fractal’, or a ‘filmic portrayal[s] of urban space which is no longer shaped by the linear mappings of modernity, but is posited as both entirely random and yet at the same time structured by complexity, simultaneity, and violent encounters’ (Everett 2005: 159). Conversely, but equally negatively as regards the representation 32\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANCE TODAY\n\nof contemporary urban life, for Jim Morrissey, Jeunet’s film seeks ‘fear[fully]’ (2008: 109) to bring Paris’ chaotic aspects to order by digitally recreating the city through an old-fashioned optic – one that has provoked numerous comparisons with the photographs of Robert Doisneau and the films of Jacques Pr´evert and Marcel Carn´e. Rick Clifton Moore’s discussion of the film’s attitude towards postmodern technology meanwhile invokes the concept of ‘machineness’, to show that in several instances within the film ‘mechanisation in work leads to mechanisation in relations’ (2006: 15). Examples given include the automatism of a Metro employee who stares blankly when Amelie poses a philosophical question and asks for her ticket; the habit of Amelie’s neighbour Collignon, retained from his working days, of punching holes, nowadays in leaves; and the painter Dufayel’s obsessive repainting of the same thing. The film in this way affirms post-Marxist prognostics about the alienating effects of capitalism; as Charles Levin has put it summarising Baudrillard, ‘[man] defines himself through his work – give him back some real work’ (Levin 1981: 12), and Amelie is no exception, introducing herself to Dufayel with the uninspiring label of her job as a waitress. It also suggests the limited place of Art in hypermodernity, since both Dufayel’s and the writer Hipolito’s activities are restricted to dilettantism and a seemingly fruitless search for ‘truth’. Moore further points out the false note sounded by Amelie’s all but obligatory (in rom-com) happy ending, Indeed, our heroine has undergone no major personality change since orchestrating her meeting with Nino through a series of manipulations so convoluted he calls her a ‘borderline sociopath’ (Moore 2006: 16). The narrator’s explanation of both characters’ longing for the sibling they never had desexualises their relationship. Even in the final sequence of implied congress – during which they exchange no words – their interaction is remarkably chaste, as they ritualistically kiss each other, for example, on the eyes, also affirming the film’s celebration of the visible over the inner life. Moore notes that the post-coital shot of Amelie and Nino in bed together is captured from the same angle as an earlier one in which Amelie was shown to be disengaged in sexual encounters, suggesting that this betrays her continued lack of involvement. Although this comparison could in principle be seen to foreground contrast, rather than sameness, Vanderschelden (2007: 35–6) has similarly highlighted the film’s repetitions and circular motifs, such as the merry-go-round\n\n33\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n34\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nand the insistent waltz on the sound-track. Not only that but the film’s major secondary romance, between Amelie’s colleague Georgette and regular customer Joseph, is already falling apart, as he tortures her with jealousy. Moore is therefore justified in dubbing the final sequence ‘a series of seemingly incoherent (or irrational) images’ (2006: 16–17). At this point, Jeunet’s famous playful Flaubertian echo, ‘Am´elie Poulain, c’est moi’ (quoted in Vincendeau 2001: 25) becomes meaningful in a secondary, unintended way. For not only do the similarities between Amelie – manipulator of images and maker of myths – and the film director abound, but just as scores of rural French women ignored the ironies of Madame Bovary’s satire on readers of romantic literature and championed it as sympathetically recounting their lives, so those viewers who left Am´elie feeling warmed inside chose to overlook the hollowness of its conclusion. Like many post-classical Hollywood rom-coms, then, at close inspection Am´elie speaks paradoxically to the inadequacy of romance as a panacea. A statement by Amelie’s boss, for whom ‘passionate love [les coups de foudre] exists but it’s manufactured – and there’s a recipe’, refers self-reflexively to the film’s generic makeup. However, Moore’s discussion stresses overall the ambivalence to technology on display in Am´elie, just as Morrissey’s appraisal of the film’s negative attitude towards the (pro-filmic) city of Paris is counterbalanced by Nicoleta Bazgan’s claims that it in fact ‘is a love story about Paris as well’ (Bazgan 2010: 103). Aesthetically, the film revels in the possibilities afforded by modern technologies, and enormous vibrancy is imparted to the narrative by Jeunet’s exuberant, digitally enhanced vision of Paris as a hyper-modern playground where poetic realism meets virtual reality. Moreover, as also noted by ScattonTessier (2004), dynamic mobility is presented in the narrative as the upside of the post-modern condition, as for example in the many fastpaced shots of Amelie traversing the city by Metro. The manic quality lent these sequences by their rapid editing may betray a desperate need for frenetic activity as distraction from the inner emptiness that threatens at moments of quietude (or on one occasion, for Morrissey, ‘communicate a sense of nausea’ [2008: 106]) but they also invite a certain breathless pleasure for the spectator transported to the four corners of Jeunet’s colourful toy-town metropolis. Indeed, the viewer’s relationship to the film here arguably becomes less analytical than\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANCE TODAY\n\nexperiential, in the manner of the theme park rides that feature in the film and as theorised by some scholars of digital cinema (Bukatman 1998; Balides 2004). Am´elie further reflects in a more positive way the recent shift in patterns of human interaction by having its couple actually meet in the Metro, an example of what Marc Aug´e (1995) has dubbed ‘nonplaces’, or places of transience too insignificant to be regarded as places. Aug´e cites Michel de Certeau’s discussion of spaces, or busy public places, like those inhabited by the characters in these films, to suggest that to frequent such spaces is ‘to be other, and go over to the other, in a place’ (Aug´e 1995: 83): a fusional regression to the experience of infancy that psychoanalysis identifies as driving human desire for the other. Interestingly, Radway’s (1991) ethnographically researched study of popular literary romance in 1980s North America draws on psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow’s work in order to argue for romances’ status as a pleasurable re-enactment of the girl’s Oedipal drama, with a positive conclusion appended. Her description relies in great measure on portrayals of heroines’ loneliness prior to finding heterosexual love. Vincendeau (2005) has identified Audrey Tautou’s star persona – largely but not exclusively since this film – with childlike innocence, while Scatton-Tessier (2004: 203) links the film’s fascination with surface pleasures (such as skimming stones), or petisme, with immaturity. In the same vein, Moore (2006: 14) remarks on the narrative contiguity of Amelie’s child and adulthoods and cites Ellul and R. Stivers’ association of puerility with the kind of ‘technological personality’ he attributes to her. Her depiction certainly fits Freud’s profile of the extremely submissive woman who is, for Moore, one possible result of a poorly resolved Electra complex (see also Roux 2001). The frequently female-gendered nature of post-modern loneliness is perhaps Am´elie’s most important legacy for the French rom-com. However, it sets up additional structuring themes and tropes for the contemporary genre, giving rise to categories for discussion in the rest of this section. These are, in addition to urban solitude, ‘machineness’ in work and social relations and the decline of traditional family and community structures in favour of contingent arrangements based on tenuous networks of more distant relationships, all of which become firmly entrenched features of French rom-coms over the next decade.\n\n35\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n36\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nI. Solitude and the City Am´elie is only one of several French rom-coms to make an ambivalent generic virtue of the new experiences offered by increased mobility today in urban contexts that are given considerable prominence both aesthetically and narratively. For instance, several films of the genre produced in the next few years (as well as at least one earlier one, V´enus Beaut´e [Institut] [1999]), including D´ecalage horaire (2002), Clara et moi/Clara and Me (Arnaud Viard, 2004), O`u avais-je la tˆete? (Nathalie Donnini, 2007) and Je vais te manquer/You’ll Miss Me (Amanda Sthers, 2009), reflect the recent shift in patterns of human interaction by having a couple meet in places of transience – in these films either airports or, in Clara et moi, the Metro. Even more than Am´elie’s Nino, who, in accordance with that film’s preservation of some degree of community, worked in a local DVD shop (albeit for porn), these pairings represent a post-modern twist on the traditional notion of the girl next door – the girl, if you like, in the next-door seat. On the one hand, there is something celebratory in the new potential for cross-cultural dialogue theoretically afforded by the encounters which all these films stage in liminal spaces of possibility – although, unsurprisingly for this genre, in all these examples the couple are both French, white and broadly middle-class. The pleasurably regressive qualities of the non-place in Aug´e’s formulation are again reflected in these rom-coms’ stress on wonder and fantasy – especially where characters’ childlike aspects are emphasised, as in D´ecalage horaire and O`u avais-je la tˆete, both of which are also indebted to Romuald et Juliette in having an uptight businessman rediscover childish abandon through a bubbly and somewhat chaotic female character. However, alongside their partial disavowal of contemporary isolation through blissful fusion across the wide gulf separating strangers, these narratives also speak to the disadvantages of anonymous existences. Notably, in Tonie Marshall’s V´enus Beaut´e, for singleton Ang`ele, her work as a Parisian beautician appears first and foremost a refuge from the unwelcoming winter cityscape, thanks to Marshall’s carefully constructed mise-en-sc`ene. The credit sequence’s neon pink writing against a black background, set to a mournfully twanging guitar, anticipates the contrast between the artificial lights of the salon’s feminised space, where customers take a pause for themselves and undergo ‘magical’ transformations, and the cold, gleaming surfaces of sombre streets and public places. These are\n\nP1: WQS IBBK114-01\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nROMANCE TODAY\n\nglimpsed fleetingly, in low-key lighting that leaves patches of blackness and often also filmed out of focus, suggesting an unknowable world only distantly related to Ang`ele. This sense of the faintly menacing otherness of the city is conveyed by the film’s opening scene, which shows Ang`ele silently tidying up the salon for the night amid the space’s trademark reassuring warm glow, still to the credit music and through the glass of the salon front, which is framed by a darkness threatening to encroach from all sides. As she finally turns off the lights to leave a cold blue hue, a biting violin joins the score at the same moment that the growling sounds and ugly forms of traffic invade the soundtrack and the foreground respectively, before she is whisked off on a bus. It should be noted that such a severe portrayal of Paris contrasts strongly with recent classically romantic portrayals of France’s capital city in films designed for export such as 2 Days in Paris ( Julie Delpy, 2007) or Midnight in Paris (Allen, USA 2011). Nonetheless, depicting city life in a ‘realistic’ way is about more than targeting the urban audiences that make up the majority of cinema-goers in France (as elsewhere). While Ang`ele meets her love interest in a train station, three years later in 2002 Dani`ele Thompson notes in interview that her playful use of a lost mobile phone to bring the central couple together in Charles de Gaulle Airport in D´ecalage horaire gestures towards the serious issue of the communication breakdown endemic in contemporary society (Baudin 2002). This is further (mis-)communicated throughout the film by the central male protagonist F´elix’s verbal confusion, as he speaks in a turbulent Franglais that is the product of his cultural disorientation as a Frenchman living in the USA. In Clara et moi the couple’s first interaction or ‘meet cute’ (see Mortimer 2010: 5–6) (a phrase that again picks up on the regressive elements of romance) echoes Amelie and Nino’s aphasia. Just as Montmartre’s modernday good fairy communicates with her love object through a trail of written messages, so Antoine ( Julien Boisselier), seeing beautiful stranger Clara ( Julie Gayet) opposite him on the train, opts to write a note requesting a date. Since the impossibility of expressing love through a language plagued by clich´e is an increasingly explicit staple of rom-com (Krutnik 2002: 138–9), this neatly avoids the problem, emphasising instead the actors’ faces, shot in endearing close-ups as shy smiles steal across them. This moment of emotional warmth stands out all the more – indeed it was commented on by several reviewers – for its contextualisation in a mise-en-sc`ene whose chilly, grey-toned palette\n\n37\n\nP1: WQS\n\nFROM FRANCE WITH LOVE\n\nIBBK114-01\n\n38\n\nTrim: 138mm × 216mm\n\nTop: 15.3pt\n\nVisual Culture Demy 216 × 138\n\nGutter: 50pt\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\n12:48\n\nand naturalistic lighting, captured at times digitally through a handheld camera, reinforces the social realist codification of the frequently drab Parisian setting. Similarly, the anchorage of events in the real world makes it still more surprising when, at their first date against the romantic backdrop of the Seine by night, in a daring act of generic contortionism, the couple burst into a romantic song complete with dancing. Even within the musical number, however, tonal disjunction is preserved, as the couple’s thin voices, more Demy than George Cukor, accompany inexpert, rather tentative dance steps. These chinks in Clara et moi’s romantic overlay, and the human frailty of Clara’s wavering voice in particular, pave the way for a plot development which brings to the fore the dark side of today’s cultural freedoms: Clara’s diagnosis as HIV positive. Occurring suddenly and without foreshadowing, this development prompts the film to lurch for the remainder of its duration into a melodramatic register. Specifically, although Antoine decides after much soul-searching that his love for Clara transcends the material challenges posed by her affliction, in a shock ending diverging from the rom-com’s typical levelling of difference, it is Clara who rejects Antoine, saying she does not believe he will make her happy, presumably because of his initial failure to support her following her diagnosis. What is interesting is the suggestion that it is precisely those freedoms that have brought Antoine and Clara together – and indeed are celebrated through intimate bedroom sequences replete with aestheticised views of Gayet’s breasts – that finally prove the obstacle to their love. In Clara et moi, then, today’s anonymous urban encounter, emblematically figured as finding love in a non-place, functions ambivalently, as opening up new possibilities only at the cost of old ideals of chaste femininity. This conjunction of ideas constitutes an obvious point at which to return to, and address directly, the ways in which the fragmentation of post-industrial living is represented in gendered ways in the rom-com. Women’s centrality in the romantic drama of solitude is reflected by the cultural currency in France of the notion of ‘Bridget ´ Jones syndrome’ (Anon 2002b; Rollet 2010), while Erika Flahault (1999) has identified anti-feminist images of female solitude as frequent in the French media"
