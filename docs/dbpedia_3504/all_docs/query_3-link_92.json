        "text": "Reposting from last year because it’s too good to leave in the archives.\n\nIn honor of Valentine’s Day, let’s talk about our favorite fictional couples. I asked on facebook and twitter for you to share your favorite fictional couple, and why you love ’em. Here’s what you said:\n\nLiterature\n\n1. Anne and Gilbert, Anne of Green Gables. “I love them because of their long friendship and I love them both as people. Gilbert is a much richer character than many book heroes.”\n\n2. Anne Elliott and Frederick Wentworth, Persuasion. “She gets a second chance to write her wrong, and he forgives.” Also, “because they pined for each other all those years.”\n\n3. Lord Peter and Harriet Vane, in Dorothy Sayers’ Lord Peter mysteries. “Two self-sufficient, intelligent people and a beautiful display of the vulnerability involved in loving and allowing oneself to be loved.”\n\n4. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice\n\n5. Jo and Laurie, Little Women. “I *wish* Jo and Laurie had been a couple.”\n\n6. Jo and Mr. Baehr.\n\n7. Beatrice and Benedict, Much Ado About Nothing. “I love that they were smart and funny and perfectly happy being single, even adamantly so, and then their friends pointed out they might work better together than against one another. Also, the line, ‘Thou and I are too wise to woo peacably.’ “\n\n8. Valancy and Barney Snaith, The Blue Castle.\n\n9. Emma and Mr. Knightley, Emma.\n\n10. Hannah and Nathan Coulter, Hannah Coulter.\n\n11. Claire and Jamie, Outlander.\n\n12. Christy and Todd, the Christy Miller series.\n\n13. Jane and Mr. Rochester, Jane Eyre. “if I’m going literary….”\n\n14. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter.\n\n15. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley, Harry Potter.\n\n16. Peeta and Katniss, The Hunger Games. “She may not have been affectionate, but she was ready to die for him. Peeta was completely selfless.”\n\n17. Wesley and Buttercup from The Princess Bride. “Because nothing says love like a sense of humor.”\n\n18. Margaret Hale and Mr. Thornton, North and South.\n\n19. Pa and Ma Ingalls, Little House series. “I love the way they speak to one another so respectfully and I love that Ma doesn’t complain even when she clearly isn’t thrilled about all the adventuring, but she isn’t a doormat. She makes her thoughts known and when she has to put her foot down, she does and he listens. 🙂 “\n\nTV\n\n20. Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt, Parks and Rec.\n\n21. Eric and Tammi Taylor, Friday Night Lights. “Best portrait of a real (happy!) marriage I’ve ever seen on tv.” (I LOVE their seesaw marriage.)\n\n22. Phil and Claire Dunphy, Modern Family.\n\n23. Matthew and Mary, Downton Abbey. (Sob.)\n\n24, Marshall and Lily, How I Met Your Mother. “Because they seem like a real couple with real problems yet they’re still so great together.”\n\n25. Marshall Dillon and Miss Kitty, Gunsmoke. “My favorite couple that never was…”\n\n26. Jack and Kate, Lost. “…goofy I know but loved that story.”\n\n27. Jim and Pam, The Office.\n\n28. And Michael and Holly, The Office. “I love that he finally found someone who could match his goofiness and who appreciated his sweet thoughtfulness.”\n\n29. Luke and Lorelei, Gilmore Girls.\n\n30. Kevin and Winnie, The Wonder Years\n\n31. Nathan and Hailey, One Tree Hill. “I realize it’s an odd choice, but they married young and grew together. Plus they made it through a lot of adversity.”\n\n32. Veronica and Logan, Veronica Mars. “I love to see Logan melt for Veronica.”\n\nMovies\n\n33. Harry and Sally, When Harry Met Sally. “I like to think that the best husbands were once great friends.”\n\n34. Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, You’ve Got Mail. “They epitomize charm and chemistry.”\n\n35. Miracle Max & his wife Valerie, The Princess Bride. ” ‘I’m not a witch–I’m your wife!’ Must be true love!!!”\n\n36. Bob Rueland and Grace Briggs, Return to Me. ” I love that though they both went through very hard things they were still hopeful and I love how sweetly the romance played out, not your usual sex fueled “romance” that you see so much now, just a sweet, slow falling in love.”\n\n37. George and Mary Bailey, It’s a Wonderful Life. “Love was fun, sacrificial, and constant through good times and bad.”\n\n38. Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore, Fever Pitch. “Just so sweet and cute, with an element of O’Henry’s The Gift of the Magi.\n\n39. Nick and Nora, The Thin Man. “I love that they don’t take each other too seriously and their banter is fabulous.”\n\n40. Mr & Mrs Smith, “…because I secretly fantasize about being a super secret spy with big guns and cool toys.”\n\n41. Anna and the King of Siam. “I love that she is strong and he loves her anyway. I love that she lets him into her heart in spite of her stubbornness.”\n\nEverywhere else\n\n42. Fibber McGee and Molly. “I love how they created a whole show revolving around everyday happenings. It reminds me that marriage is the everyday.”\n\n43. Christine and Rauol, The Phantom of the Opera. “Love that book (and the musical)!!”\n\nWho are your favorite fictional couples?"
