        "text": "Beloved wife, mother, grandma and grandma-great, Carol Reese Nielson, 90, died June 27, 2024 in Orem, Utah. She was born December 17, 1933 to Thomas and Nedra (Watkins) Reese, the oldest of four children. Carol grew up in American Fork, Payson, Lakeview, and Orem, Utah.\n\nCarol’s childhood was a happy one. She was well loved by her parents and grandparents. She helped babysit and care for her three younger brothers. In the 9th grade she lived back east with her maternal grandparents, attending school in Arlington, Virginia. Later on, Carol would visit her grandparents back east again and work at the Pentagon.\n\nDuring her teenage years, Carol worked at the Scera Theater, first as an usher, then as a candy girl, and finally at the ice cream counter. She also helped pick and sort fruit on the family farm. Carol was always very social and outgoing. She enjoyed attending every dance and school activity possible. She often stayed late to chat with her friends, even though she knew she would be grounded for missing curfew. Carol was crowned Miss Orem in 1953.\n\nCarol attended BYU for two years and had a full social life. She was close to her Aunts Nina and Jeanine who were similar in age to her. She roomed with them for a time at BYU.\n\nCarol met Boyd Nielson at the Scera Pool where she was working one summer. Carol and Boyd married on August 19, 1954 in the Salt Lake Temple. They first lived in Orem and then Salt Lake City, before returning to Orem where they made their permanent home. Together they lovingly raised seven children.\n\nCarol had many talents. The ultimate homemaker, she loved cooking, sewing, and canning. She made delicious meals from scratch for her family. She sewed miles of stitches on her green Necchi sewing machine, resulting in darling dresses for her girls. In the summer, she canned hundreds of bottles of produce from her father’s fruit farm. Family was most important to her and everything Carol did was to show her love for them.\n\nEvery child deserves a mother such as Carol. She was always kind, consistent, fair, and willing to help. She taught her children right from wrong. She worried about each child, and was involved in each of their lives. Carol’s children learned from watching her, to be kind to others, to work hard, to play well together, and to do their best. Carol’s teaching and wisdom through the years have blessed their lives immensely. Her legacy will live on through the love each of her children feel for their angel mother. Carol cherished each one of her grandchildren dearly. She enjoyed visiting with them at family gatherings. Her great grandchildren were always a delight for her to see. Family was her greatest treasure.\n\nCarol was always busy doing something. During the years, she spent hours scrapbooking. She produced at least 80 heirloom scrapbooks full of family photos and journaling of time spent together at monthly family dinners, reunions, birthdays, baby showers and trips. She enjoyed creating a cherished pictorial history of a life full of love and happiness.\n\nCarol worked for 29 years as a popular Weight Watcher leader in Orem and Provo. Her classes were consistently well attended. She was always well prepared for her weekly “lectures,” and enjoyed supporting other members through her creativity and warm nature. Carol also had a love of traveling and took many trips with friends or family all over the world. Some of the places she visited were Canada, Mexico, England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Belgium. She also traveled in the United States to New York, Washington DC, Oregon, Washington State, California, Missouri, Hawaii, and Alaska, to name a few. Carol loved people. Whether through her travels, neighborhood, work or church, she made new lifelong friends.\n\nCarol was a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in many church callings including Young Women Presidencies, Relief Society Presidencies, and Primary. Carol and Boyd were consistent in bringing the family together for daily prayer and weekly home evenings. They served as coordinators for the Bel Aire Care Center branch for several years. Carol was always warm, generous, and kind. She truly exemplified a Christ-like life. She testified often to her children and grandchildren about Heavenly Father’s Plan of Salvation. She never missed an opportunity to share family stories with her children and grandchildren, thus passing down family histories. In her last months she often spoke of wanting to be with Boyd again. She had a strong testimony of that next step and her posterity takes great comfort in knowing they are together once again.\n\nCarol is survived by her children: Terry Nielson (Karen), Diane Simmons (Brad), Janet Zobell (Ralph), Chris Wilcox, Linda Nielson, Andrea Nielson, and Condita Washburn. She is also survived by her brothers David and Kent Reese, 18 grandchildren, 52 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren. Carol was preceded in death by her husband Boyd Lamont Nielson, parents Thomas and Nedra Reese, brother Gary Reese, son-in-law Blaine Seamons, and great-granddaughter Paetyn Thomas.\n\nServices honoring Carol will be held Wednesday, July 3, 2024, in the LDS Chapel located at 670 E. 800 N. Orem, Utah. A viewing will be held from 9:30 to 10:30 AM, followed by the funeral at 11:00 AM. Burial will be at the Provo City Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, please contribute to your favorite charity. The family wishes to thank the caregivers who lovingly served and cared for our mother during her final months. Sundberg-Olpin & Wheeler Funeral Home is coordinating funeral arrangements.\n\nCondolences may be expressed to the family on this page."
