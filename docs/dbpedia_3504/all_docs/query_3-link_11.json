        "text": "\"Great LezBritian\" is a fortnightly stroll through the very best of British lesbo-centric entertainment and culture. Plus there will be some jolly good interviews with the top ladies who are waving the flag for gay UK.\n\nLaura Fraser is perhaps the Lip Servant that you will be most familiar with, she has appeared in such films as A Knight’s Tale and Vanilla Sky, plus she’s the only cast member that you may have seen previously locking lips with a lady onscreen. Her previous gay-for-pay outings were in the wonderful ITV drama The Investigator alongside Helen Baxendale, Nina’s Heavenly Delights — you’ve got to love a film about lesbians and curry — and a short film that she couldn’t remember the name of when we met.\n\nIn Lip Service, her character Cat is really the central figure of the show. Although it is an ensemble cast, everything pretty...\n\nL to R: Sharon Small, Orla Brady, and Shelley Conn (1/10/09)\n\nMistresses is a six-episode British drama series coming to BBC America in February about a group of female friends with relationship problems — including Shelley Conn (Nina's Heavenly Delights) as a promiscuous, commitment event planner who falls for one of her clients, played by Anna Torv, who is now the star of the Fox supernatural drama Fringe. (Americans who don't mind some spoilers can read our review of the first season.)\n\nThe show is a hit in the U.K., with a sizeable audience of about 6 million viewers, according to Mistresses executive producer Douglas Rae — \"mainly women, but men buy the DVDs, I suspect looking for extras which aren't on it.\"\n\nMost of the cast (minus Sarah Parish, who plays Dr. Katie Roden), creators, and BBC execs were on a panel on Saturday at the Television Critics Association Winter Tour in L.\n\nRegent Releasing/here!\n\nYou would think that food, sex, songs and cross-cultural comedy would make for a winning cinematic recipe, but in Nina's Heavenly Delights the tasty ingredients add up to an indigestible whole. This tale of an Indian woman's efforts to save her family's Glasgow restaurant is so overly cutesy and precious that it squanders audience goodwill long before its conclusion.\n\nThe title character (Shelley Conn) fled her native Glasgow, as well as the fiance (Raji James) she ditched right before her wedding three years earlier. She returns for her father's funeral, only to find the family's Indian restaurant, the New Taj, on the verge of being lost thanks to an ill-advised bet. Determined to save the day, she enters the restaurant in a televised curry cooking contest, with predictably madcap results.\n\nFeaturing Bollywood-style musical numbers courtesy of Nina's drag queen best friend Bobbi (Ronny Jhutti); a lesbian romance between Nina and another chef (Laura Fraser) that is depicted in a decorous, fade-to-black manner; recurring appearances by the ghost of Nina's father; family conflict courtesy of her sternly disapproving mother and other plot elements too numerous to mention, the film from writer Andrea Gibb and director Pratibha Parmar, displays undeniable heart but little finesse.\n\nThe female leads are gorgeous, and the sheer exoticism of the setting provides some interest. But this combination of melodrama, comedy, music and romance eventually falls under the weight of its endlessly stereotypical characters, dialogue and situations."
