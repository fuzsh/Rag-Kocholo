        "text": "Variety is the success secret for any film festival.\n\nWhether it's focused on animation, international cinema or movies with a political theme, finding the right mix of genres makes the difference between a festival that expands perspectives and fosters dialogue, and one that's more a monochromatic sampling of what's happening on the screen.\n\nIn some years, the Portland Lesbian & Gay Film Festival has felt more like the latter, with an over-representation of documentaries or short films at times crowding out dramas and crowd-pleasing comedies.\n\nThis 11th edition, which kicks off Friday and runs through Oct. 21, takes a more evenhanded approach. This program offers the best mix from recent years of different types of filmmaking. In addition to the range, it nails down the global scope of gay and lesbian cinema, showcasing films from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, in addition to U.S. fare. This internationalism feels exactly right, with satellite culture making the world seem increasingly smaller. What does it mean to be \"out\" here as well as over there? This festival is the place to explore that question.\n\nThe organizers have pulled together the goods. Now it's time to revel in the variety.\n\nNote: Due to a design glitch, a box containing ticket info for the 11th Annual Portland Lesbian & Gay Film Festival wasn't included in Friday's print version of A&E. Here's what you need to know before you go ... and this festival definitely is worth checking out.\n\nThe 11th Annual Portland Lesbian & Gay Film Festival\n\nWhen: Various times Friday-Oct. 21\n\nWhere: Cinema 21, the Hollywood Theatre, Living Room Theaters\n\nTickets: $8 for screenings, except for \"Brand Upon the Brain!,\" $25. Full passes, which include admission to all screenings and parties, $130. Platinum passes, which guarantee seating and allow immediate entry into theaters, $180. Purchase at www.ticketweb.com, 866-468-7623, or at the Cinema 21 box office.\n\nAlso: Opening night party at The Cleaners at The Ace Hotel, $8; closing night party Oct. 20 at Crush, $5.\n\nDetails: www.plgff.org\n\nFor PL&GFF previews, read on...\n\n\"The Curiosity of Chance\"\n\nChance Marquis doesn't fit in. The eccentric gay teenager wears top hats and eye patches to high school, and his style choices make him the source of lunchroom ridicule. Dabbling in drag and having the jock bullies find out about it makes matters worse.\n\nAnd yet Chance isn't the greatest curiosity of this teen comedy, the Portland Lesbian & Gay Film Festival's opening night offering. The setting is the new wave 1980s, and this is an American-style high school in Belgium, with a student body of Army brats and European kids -- an odd cultural cross-pollination. The thick accents of some of the actors and the European setting never entirely mesh with the John Hughes-style comedy, and some of the slapstick, particularly an ongoing bit about a rotund vice principal with body odor, feels forced and unoriginal.\n\nStill, there are some very likable performances, particularly from Tad Hilgenbrinck as the title character; and Brett Chukerman as the soccer-playing hunk next door who befriends Chance after initially aligning himself with a steroid-using thug. When the two join forces to create a band, you get the sense that neither sees the other solely through the gay/straight lenses that other students are so focused on. Who would've guessed they'd make beautiful, platonic music together? And who would've guessed that the Antwerp drag scene was so hair-hoppin'? Like any good student, you learn something new every day.\n\n(90 minutes; unrated, likely PG-13; United States) Grade: B-\n\n7:30 p.m. Friday, Hollywood Theatre. Director Russell P. Marleau and Chukerman will be in attendance.\n\n\"Colma: The Musical\"\n\nWhat's it like to come of age in a town best known for its preponderance of cemeteries, when all you really want to do is sing and dance? That's the dilemma faced by the three main characters in this shot-on-a-shoestring pop musical, set in the actual San Francisco-area town for which it's named.\n\nThe eternal and universal desire to escape small-town origins and establish one's own identity finds a catchy voice in the form of writer H.P. Mendoza, who also stars.\n\n(95 minutes, rated R, United States) B+\n\n6 p.m. Saturday, Hollywood Theatre.\n\n\"No Regret\"\n\nUnderneath its glistening skyscrapers and immaculately clean streets, there's a seedy side of Seoul, South Korea, in which young orphan Sumin finds himself caught. After trying his hand at factory work he slips into a world of prostitution, in a brothel where businessmen show up under the guise of karaoke but are really there for sex with young men.\n\nIt's a grim existence that only grows more depressing when Jaemin, one of his clients, takes an interest in him that borders on stalking. He resists the pursuit, but the relentless chase eventually wears him down and Sumin opens up to the idea of loving someone.\n\nThis is no hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold story, however. Director Leesong Hee-il infuses his story with the struggle between Korean social classes, particularly how money can outweigh emotions and sexuality when it comes to personal relationships. To be together as a couple, poor Sumin and wealthy Jaemin must break a taboo that's bigger than being gay.\n\n(114 minutes; unrated, likely R; South Korea) A-\n\n9 p.m. Monday, Cinema 21.\n\n\"The Bubble\"\n\nLess of a \"gay film,\" per se, and more of a romantic dramedy in which some of the characters happen to be gay, director Eytan Fox's (\"Walk on Water\") paean to cosmopolitan Tel Aviv has solid performances from an engaging cast.\n\nWhether these hipsters are organizing a rave to protest the West Bank occupation or working the days away in restaurants and record stores, they're all too aware of their isolation from the rest of Israel, hence the title.\n\n(117 minutes; unrated, likely R; Israel) B\n\n9 p.m. Tuesday, Cinema 21.\n\n\"For the Bible Tells Me So\"\n\nThe battle between fundamentalist Christians and gay rights advocates is a hot zone in the culture wars, with believers squared off against critics who accuse them of selectively reading the Bible, choosing certain things to proclaim as Scripture-dictated \"abominations,\" while ignoring others (eating shellfish, working on the Sabbath).\n\nSo what happens when fundamentalist families discover that one of their children is gay? This documentary weaves the stories of a several families, ranging from a poor family in the rural South, to former congressman and presidential candidate Dick Gephardt, whose daughter Chrissy came out in the middle of a political campaign. For some parents, reconciling faith with unconditional love for their children isn't easy, forcing a deeper examination of what religious organizations like Focus on the Family teach, and whether it's truly rooted in the Bible.\n\nSome stories are heartbreaking, like one mother's rejection of her daughter's lifestyle that ends with the girl committing suicide. Others inspire, like the support Gene Robinson receives from his parents on his way to becoming the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal church.\n\n(95 minutes; unrated, likely PG; United States) A-\n\n7 p.m. Wednesday, Cinema 21.\n\n\"Nina's Heavenly Delights\"\n\nWhen it comes to great cooking, the best chefs don't rely on recipes. They listen to their hearts. Nina (Shelley Conn), a Scottish woman of Indian descent, certainly embraces that karma when she's whipping up delicious curries. But can she follow the same approach when it comes to wooing the girl she's interested in -- and sorting out her complicated family relationships, particularly with her mother?\n\nThe cooking and personal chemistry come together when Nina sets out to defend her late father's honor in a Glasgow curry cooking contest. Teaming up with love-interest Lisa, and with the help of a Bollywood musical-obsessed video store clerk, she sets out to unleash spices and herbs to create a royal feast that's sure to trounce the competition. The cooking sequences, with shots of lamb chops simmering in ginger-fueled sauces, are the sort of gustatory cinema that you don't want to experience on an empty stomach.\n\nYou can see the ending coming almost from the get-go, but the performances and the glimpse into Scotland's Indian dining scene make for a tasty diversion from the festival's heavier fare.\n\n(94 minutes; PG-13; Great Britain) B\n\n7 p.m. Oct. 19, Cinema 21.\n\n\"Shelter\"\n\nZach (Trevor Wright) is going nowhere fast. He's a graffiti artist who longs to go to an art institute but instead is spinning his wheels acting as a surrogate father to his mixed-up sister's son. When he's not being a pretend dad, he's surfing in the Southern California waves, dreaming of what could be.\n\nThen he meets his best friend's older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe). They surf and knock back beers together, eventually finding solace from loneliness in each other's arms. There's real chemistry between the two actors, and when Zach is forced to decide whether to pursue his art or continue caring for his nephew, he has to consider whether he wants to take shelter in Shaun's life or continue to provide it for others.\n\n(97 minutes; unrated, likely PG-13; United States) B+\n\n8 p.m. Oct. 20, Cinema 21.\n\n\"The Witnesses\"\n\nAIDS has been around for a quarter-century. It's easy to forget just how harrowing the early days of the disease were, when doctors had no idea how HIV was spread and the media cast it as a modern-day version of the plague. This heartbreaking French drama captures that era of fear and uncertainty, with astonishingly good acting.\n\nThe story centers on Manu, a cook who arrives in Paris in the early 1980s and embarks on an affair with a married man, before contracting the disease. As Manu quickly begins to fade, his lover and his wife (played by the breathtaking Emmanuelle Beart) worry over their own health. Could they catch AIDS from a cough or by shaking hands? Of course not, we know now, but \"The Witnesses\" makes the panic of the time feel very real.\n\n(112 minutes; unrated, likely R; France) A\n\n6 p.m. Oct. 21, Cinema 21."
