        "text": "This week over a hundred people decided to turn our faces away from the people the two major parties representing so-called democracy have foolishly offered as examples of leadership in these times and turn our faces, our hearts and our minds to two actual examples of leadership Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. We took the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, a process through which 60,000 disenfranchised citizens created their own embodiment of collective decision making and the Freedom Farm Cooperative a survival project that responded to the terrible policies of corruptly elected leaders by providing access to food sovereignty, affordable housing and education.\n\nWe were real about what we are “sick and tired” of (in the words of Fannie Lou Hamer. We shared our complicated and urgent relationship to the light we need to shine at this time and to close we stepped into the field of freedom Ella Baker activated with her speech at the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Democratic Convention that hailed all of us past, present and future who “believe in freedom.” Here is the poem we created together.

Today as people around the US who have felt despair as their representatives ignored their pleas for peace prepare to vote in a primary election, we remember that our nature is not just choice, but transformation.\n\nIn our workshop we drew on the “Archive of Fire” in my book M Archive: After the End of the World especially the deep teachings of candle calisthenics, inspired by my beloved mentor M. Jacqui Alexander’s “Anatomy of a Mobilization” in her book Pedagogies of Crossing. We looked closely at the fire within us, what air sustains it, what purpose do we burn for, what messages can we hear when we attune ourselves to our light?\n\nEvery message was a message of substantive change. Below is our group poem. May it nourish the fire within you.\n\nThis Fire\n\nBy the participants in “The Character of Fire”: Writing After the End of the World\n\n“The feel of fire is strong, not hot.”\n\n-M.

We wrote about what we want and how big our wants are and how small are wants are and how it feels to have to demand over and over again the very basic dignity we want for everyone. We wrote about what we commit to and how we feel about commitment and how it feels to create our own forms of commitment when patriarchal capitalist commitment has been extracted from us in so many ways. We wrote about our emergent beliefs and the possibilities love is making us brave enough to recognize in ourselves and each other. And then we made this group poem about what we mean when we say we want peace.\n\nLove and gratitude to everyone who participated last night.

Last night I had the glorious honor of being one of the inaugural honorees for Black Feminist Future’s North Star Awards alongside the great Barbara Smith, Dorothy Roberts, my wonder twin Moya Bailey and the amazing organization Snap Co!\n\nToday is my father’s birthday and in honor of his memory and his presence I dedicate this award to him. Here is my acceptance speech from last night.\n\n***********\n\nBlack Feminism Lives!!!! I love you all so much. And that’s my interpretation of this beautiful North Star honor. I hope it means you can feel it. It feels very auspicious to me that this gorgeous event is happening 2 days before my birthday. Because Black feminism is my perpetual rebirth, my true love, my mailing address, my meaning, my reason, my religion, my every breath. And thank you Black Feminist Future for honoring the eternity of the Black Feminism within which we live and breathe and have our being.\n\nTomorrow is my father’s birthday. He would have been 69 years old. And he’s been an ancestor for almost 7 years now. But let me tell you he would have been respecting the boundaries and guidelines of this space and also livestreaming every session because, though he was a straight cis west indian man, he self-identified as a queer black feminist like me. And yes. This was an act of love. An act of support for his queer black feminist daughter. But it was also his own access to the transcendent possibility that keeps us waking up excited to keep creating a black feminist movement. For my father, the queer vision that black feminism possible represented the level of liberation he wanted for himself, and that he like us wants for everyone. And it required of him what it requires of all of us, to grow beyond who we think we are, to lay down all our fears, our coping mechanism, the identities that are too small for us, and that Toni Cade Bambara taught us will not and should not outlive our revolution. The queer potential of black feminism required my father to change jobs and change gods, to surrender all to the possibility of our freedom. Which means that even though he would have lived in the light of my memory regardless, because he was a committed queer black feminist my father found eternity before died.\n\nThis is what I mean when I say BLACK FEMINISM LIVES. Because Audre Lorde taught us that this work didn’t start with us and it will continue after we are gone. Because I’m pretty sure, is this right Beloved Demita Frazier? that the most repeated word in the Combahee River Collective Statement after Black and Women and we and us is ALWAYS.\n\nYou know that from the experience of this weekend and of your own life. Black Feminism is made up of infinite acts of love and each of those acts was dreamed of by our ancestors and impacts our future generations, so therefore each of these decisions we are making these actions we are taking is eternal.\n\nAnd this is why I love you Black Feminist Future, because you honor that eternity in space and time and practice. Thank you for making structures for this infinite love we call black feminism to flow in all directions.\n\nThank you for letting me be part of your/our/this eternal life.\n\nNow, if you would, loved ones, say it back to me. Call and response style. Black feminism lives. Black feminism lives. Black feminism lives!\n\nLast night Black Feminist Film School held a virtual workshop that activated the dinner table scene in the film The Color Purple as a practice space for ancestral listening. Love and gratitude to all the participants who brought their folks, their love, all their senses and their beautiful brilliance together. We had such a great time. We invited specific ancestors to watch the scene with us and noticed what they noticed. We used Sangodare’s Ancestral Reverence as Character Development activity to get to know our ancestors even better and we reveled in the abundance of how ancestral presence and practice is available in every moment.

But the email the university president sent out the lie that it is “unlawful” to strike in the state of New Jersey and then daring to use the term “beloved community” to act as if the very reasonable improvements 94% of faculty and graduate students are requesting, which require the re-allocation of only 1% of the university budget are somehow both impossible and unnecessary, makes me glad that Rutgers has some of the best literary scholars in the world on the case. That type of communication doesn’t feel like a sunrise. I would call it a dumpster fire.\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know, on the very afternoon of my campus visit and actual dumpster fire on a routine garbage train exporting New York City trash around the country got out of hand and spread into brush fires all along the New Jersey transit line, shutting down all trains past Edison, through New Brunswick and beyond. You all know I don’t believe in mere coindicence. All I see is connection.\n\nInspired by the brave connections Evie Shockley’s graduate students made between their most vulnerable breakthroughs and my apocalyptic writing and the generous connections PhD students Ashley Codner and JP Sloan made between my body of work and my way of working and crucial intellectual and spiritual work of their own connections to their beloved family members and ancestors, I too will look for generative connections between a New Jersey brush fire and the lessons we and I need to learn.\n\nM. Jacqui Alexander asks us to “remember the character of fire.” That fire is not only hot, it is strong. And the nature of fire is to transform. Everything. And more and more biologists are recognizing and emphasizing the influence of fire on life on earth itself. The conditions that make our lives and any oxygenated life on earth possible are the same conditions that beckon fire. Because, as biologist Stephen Pyne reminds us “fire is not a substance, it is a reaction that synthesizes its surroundings.” Fire is a writer with a thick black pen, a cloud of hair recognizable even from far away. Or you can call me what Pyne calls me: “an ecological shape-shifter.”\n\nFire is not a component of an environment, it is a crucial connection between the components of an existing environment with a persistent way of making itself known. Which is why we don’t name a fire by what ignites it, but by what sustains it. We name fires after whatever fuels them to grow. A forest fuels a forest fire, the brush feeds a brush fire, and our prodigious production of waste fuels the dumpster fires of the world. A fire, like a perfectly lawful strike, is a reaction to a set of pre-existing environmental factors, a synthesis illuminating those factors, transubstantiating the situation into a path of irrevocable change.\n\nA reasonable response to a fire must shift the conditions the fire signals with its presence, for example the gathered dryness, the piling debris swept under the rug at many universities in the United States where local cost of living goes up, and tuition goes up, but wages don’t. Where racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic practices fail to honor the actual population of students and workers the university purports to serve. The suppression of the small fires, leads to so much underbrush solidarity that the big trees fall. The university evasion of union demands, the suppression of the very existence of unions? Those are the perfect conditions for a fire, thus the nursery rhyme about the fate of the pants of the liar.\n\nThe demands of the union are water. And the river is literally right there. Why do our institutions continually chose to dump more trash excuses and toxic lies on the existing dumpster fire? Maybe it’s for the same reason I used to remember to charge my phone and check my email more frequently than I remembered to eat, or drink water. Or why I am so much more likely to deal with what I have than to risk asking for what I need. Because the bells, alarms, rewards and punishments of capitalism refuse to be ignored, and my ignorance of the wider system, the orbit, the planet in fire, makes me that much more available as fuel.\n\nThere is a science lesson about the different categories of fuel, from the perspective of a fire, because there is a difference between potential fuel, that which would ignite under the most extreme circumstances, and available fuel that which will ignite in THESE conditions, the conditions we find ourselves in NOW.\n\nAll that brush along the New Jersey transit tracks was available to fuel a fire, the moment the dumpster fire exceeded its metal. Kind of like the faculty and students who want to be available to each other, and recognize the need for that even more in the face of institutional lack of accountability. That’s fire too isn’t it? The way the members of this community want to change each other beyond their function to reproduce the institution they all inhabit? The fire in the dumpster changed the temperature of the train, which however could have continued on its destined track. The brush fire though? The brushfire shut down the whole Northeast Corridor, the brush fire changed the day itself.\n\nAnd so I continue to study fire up close. I seek to learn the crucial difference between my potential and my availability. It feels hard to know what I should be available to and when, and what exact conditions ignite me, ignite us after all this time being fuel for a trash situation. From right here, cast aside from the deadening path. But that’s how ignitions works, because suddenly we know. And it’s like we never forgot. I love being brush alongside you, bursting into a shareable flame, scorched out our erstwhile randomness into a unified black char, more fertile ground than ever.\n\nWhat if we embraced fire as the evolutionary message it is. The reason for thick bark on conifers, sturdy seedpods, long distance proliferations, a futuristic reaction to smoke by many species of trees, waxy leaves on bushes adaptation that not only help the rooted withstand but strengthen their lives and their intergenerational connections even after the fire is gone.\n\nWhat if we let ourselves blacken and change? I already love you, bright shapeshifter, and how you always find me at the edge, call out my sweat as soon as you come near. And all I know for sure is you will never be the same and I will never finish knowing you and you swift rewrite my name. You wake me up.\n\nP.S. I love you. I’m with you. I’m always here.\n\nIt was satellite imaging that warned the watchers that this year the Atlantic Sargasso Belt is not only broader than broadway, it is wider than the whole United States. And I wonder if instead of living in the gun-crazed fantasy of someone else’s forefathers, a landscape of terror and cops, I could live on a copper raft of algae as algae, breaking off piece of myself to spread us wider, holopelagic, never touching the bottom of the ocean until I die.\n\nOr is my anxiety sargasstic, keeping me on the surface, while what I do every day, this diving deeper, this grounding work what sargassum breathing as one, a billion tiny air bladders strong, would call the good death. The chance to clear the air of carbon and feed the prescient life underneath I had earlier been protecting with my latticed canopy of reach. When sargassum do wash up on shore they become part of the land, crucial to the structure of sand dunes, preventing shoreline erosion, but only if they have a good burial.\n\nRight now, due multiple people made conditions, including rising ocean temperatures and possibly fertilizer runoff into the ocean the amount of sargassum washing up on the shorelines of the Americas is overwhelming the stewards of beachly whiteness. And like any dead body in the open air in the heat of the sun sargassum becomes toxic. It would not be good for your own air bladder, I call mine lungs, or your braid for you to breath in the rot.\n\nImagine, a species in toxic relationship with planet earth, that’s us, going to the beach to get away from our chloroflourocarbon producing or dependent occupations and being met with masses of dead algae bodies, offering toxicity back in kind. Kind of seems like a message doesn’t it? Karma, a brown philosophy .\n\nWho knows, maybe all the multi-national beauty companies will pivot to seaweed skin products. My cousin Branden says that’s already starting to happen in Mexico. But the impossible to ignore sargassum that meteorologists are tracking like a self-contained hurricane is making me ask myself what in my life needs a journey to the depth, a good burial. Before I can’t take the smell anymore.\n\nAlgae are among our very oldest earth ancestors. It would make sense that they would teach us about death. And so we remember how African Antigone always was and how Jean Rhys’s novel Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) revealed the colonial haunting undergirding European gender relations. When you don’t have a good death or a proper burial there will be a haunting.\n\nIt takes intention and a deep surrendering of ego, linearity and everything else colonialism taught us to value to allow our ancestral connections to be what they can be, what I believe they must be, nourishing fertile ground. Otherwise we live yet another zombie apocalypse movie, haunted by centuries of violence, haunting the air we breathe through cycles of harm and reaction, a noxious context that eats away our brains. (And I think all the Jean Rhys scholars would remind us that every new zombie apocalypse TV show and movie reveals the infusion of African and Caribbean stories of undeath into the western cultural imagination. Another haunting.\n\nI am here immersed in a western culture that ignores and is obsessed by death at the same time, but what I know is that my ancestors deserve a good burial within me. A transubstantiation of vulnerability into love. We, the intentional repositories for our ancestors known and unknown can find intergenerational clarity in deep suffering, and powerful commitment and faith in the acts of love and resistance that came before us.\n\nBut I know that offering my ancestors a long good death, an honored world building role beyond their lifetimes requires me to let my ego die. To let go of my preoccupation with surface attention so I can go below the surface and contribute to the deep ecology of our home. It challenges me to release my fear of intimacy, all my methods for keeping you at the surface and not letting you in. It reminds me that my fantasies of being self contained with my little air bubble body cannot withstand how profoundly entangled we are. It is scary to let go of pieces of myself, that might grow into whole other lives, but that’s the only way we grow.\n\nWhat if every step towards embodied liberation is a good death for the person I was before, sinking to the surface, healing the atmosphere and allowing new life to regenerate. Could I be as algae as that? Could we?\n\nIs this what is so scary to transphobic legislators about trusting trans youth and supportive parents to lead their own evolution? Denials of life-saving healthcare to trans people of all ages disrespect all our ancestors, including the algae. They seek to legislate us into ignoring a spiritual truth: embodiment IS change. Change is life-giving. And how dare they project their fear of transformation itself on the scale of the planet and their own souls onto our sacred teachers, our true leaders, our children. June Jordan says, “children are the way life begins again and again.” And life is never the same. And let me be clear, targeting a group of young people who cannot even vote yet in order to harness the fears of a surface obsessed population fearful of change is not leadership. It is cowardice. It is rotten. It pollutes the very air.\n\nWhat do we do when transformation become impossible to ignore? When the spectrum of being becomes wider than the national imaginary can hold? We go deeper, we love browner, we change the shoreline, we grow.\n\nThis writing is how I give you all my air, tubularly braiding our destinies here on the surface of something we barely understand. And why should we? This is BIG, our connection across oceans. Our surrender of pieces of our selves to a future that will float on without us. And our transformative love to be impossible to ignore forever more, to be visible to all witnesses of all species, even the spies watching through satellites. I want the offering of our compassion to all each others evolutions to take up more space in our imaginations than any national nostalgia. I want the brown interconnection of our boldness to change the topography of our possible shorelines. And so here I am offering air until all this good loving empties me out. And I believe you will still be with me when we go deeper than we know we can go, nutritious to the waiting ground as a welcome falling sky.\n\nP.S. I love you and I’m here. Our Black queer and trans-led Black Feminist Film School team is leading a workshop on ancestral remembrance soon.

Shaped by the slow movements of glaciers across continents? There is something glamorous about that to me. Like Jennifer Lopez’s character in Hustlers.\n\nI know. Ice queen realness. But the closeness of ice, the slow smoothing impact of centuries of solid flow. I fantasize about that feeling. And I’m not even a person who like the cold. Not even for its contrast. Ask my partner what we keep the thermostat on at home. Sangodare will tell you: Caribbean.\n\nAnd yet. And still. And not still, but imperceptibly moving mountains, I love that the surface of earth got some of her curves from the slow roll of ice across miles and millenia. I too have grown beautiful exactly where you tried to freeze me out. I too wear ice over so many parts of my evolution. And now it’s melting.\n\nCan you remember what it felt like when your frozen places became rivers nurturing all kinds of life you couldn’t have previously imagined? Do you remember when what was a weight became a rush and you greened all over? That’s what my journey to turning 40 felt like and now I know why Audre Lorde called herself “a high priestess of 40” in that video after the Broadside banquet. (Thank you Mary Lu Lewis, Michelle Citron and the Lesbian Home Movie Project.)\n\nAudre said she let go of all the pressure she had internalized about who she should be and what she should make happen and what other people thought and BABY! Talk about prolific erotic inspiration, talk about dreams upon dreams we still dreaming. I’m so happy to know exactly what she means.\n\nAnd maybe that’s why I have an issue with dams. Stay with me.\n\nThis hotel I’m staying in, in San Fransisco, has a note printed on the bottom of the mirror, proclaiming the good news that we can drink the tap water because it comes from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir and is the cleanest drinking water in the whole United States.\n\nAnd guess what? I love tap water. Our best way beyond the scourge of plastic bottled water. What usually fills my turquoise tumbler (after flowing through the filter Sangodare bought) is tap water. And I come from public water legacies. As part of the short-lived 1967 Anguillian Revolution, my grandparents prioritized free access to clean water as a collective necessity. Decades later my grandfather (who would have been 110 last week) still spoke of it as their greatest revolutionary achievement, that a poor child, like he had been growing up in Anguilla, could go to the pump and get the water they needed on an island surrounded by salt.\n\nSo why wasn’t I happy to read the note on the bottom of the mirror proclaiming I could drink the tap water in this hotel which they must have had to dig real deep to build up this high? And I have been drinking this tap water, even though strangely the hotel also gives out Aquafina.\n\nI’m angry because I’m here in San Francisco, really only for a night on my way somewhere else, and I know how this city has displaced its Black communities. I watched The Last Black Man in San Francisco like everyone else did (or should). And it just doesn’t feel right to me that while the tap water in Jackson, Mississippi and Flint Michigan and too many more cities is poisonous sludge, this violent dream of a non-Black urban exception brags about having the cleanest drinking water. Of course you &^*(ing do.\n\nWhile Oakland, which I can almost see from here, gets its water through old poorly maintained pipes from the Sierra Nevada and East Bay watersheds, San Francisco gets its water from 187 miles away in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir over next to Yosemite.\n\nAnd what is Hetch Hetchy Reservoir? A drowned valley, dammed up.\n\nMillenia ago a glacier carved a most beautiful valley into earth, Cliffs and dramatic edges, a U-shaped curve in the land. And then when the glacier moved on and the ice melted, what a rich and fertile home for the people. The Sierra Minok, Yokuts, Washoe, Western Mono and Pauite loved ones and more tended the valley in loving relationship for thousands of years. And then. The manifest destiny dream fueled by the San Francisco gold rush unleashed state-sanctioned genocide against the Native people of the area in the mid 1800’s including the Mariposa War, inventing laws that called the beloved people trespassers in their own home.\n\nWas that enough? Was it enough to steal the land these communities had made more beautiful with their living? This place that the white conservationist John Muir called “a grand landscape garden, one of natures rarest and most precious mountain temples,”? No. It is never enough in white supremacist capitalism. In 1913 adding more than insult to massive theft, the far away city of San Francisco built a dam that flooded the whole valley, drowning countless species so that 110 years later this hotel can tell Jeremiah Gumbs’s granddaughter to taste the cleanest drinking water in America? Clearly we do not have the same definition of clean.\n\nThis morning I woke up with a start. Some weird rerouting of sinus fluid to the back of my throat had me sit straight up to keep from drowning again. And dam. Maybe I should have never drank that water. Where is this happening in my life? What ancient treasures am I flooding for convenience, directing water to wherever the gold reside. Who do I push out of my life because their love demands too much of me, without even the good sense to love myself better in their absence?\n\nI’m only here in SF because it’s a gay mecca. But my queer Black life (and all the lives in pinkwashed Israel by the way) deserve better than this stolen lie of clean. I deserve to be curved where I am. Curved and populated by the interspecies miracle of staying. Because the speculative housing market push-out in this and every other city I know can only produce more thirst. Of course we are unquenchable when we sever our deepest relationships and murder our teachers for teaching us what we most need to learn.\n\nOnce upon a time I wore ice and it made me who I am and it melted into every pore and the flow of it still overwhelms me. Once upon a time my curves, a fertile place of welcome growth that could forever surprise me. I call on the high-priestesses and the sages of all ages, I call on the displaced and the reaching. I call on my memory of Spring. A queer symbiosis, an ever changing love, a relationship that grows beautiful in the gaps of where we are. May it be so, again.\n\nP.S. Are you ready to let it flow? Join me in one of these reflective writing courses.\n\n“When this world peels away, the new one is right underneath.”\n\n-Amaru Rufus an earthseedling child (as told to his mother and repeated to me in a reflection by Earthseed Founding Member Zulayka Santiago)\n\nThe overcast sky broke at sunset and the layers of cloud and not-cloud looked like the layers of the earth. Or at least what I think the layers of the earth would look like. But seeing the layers of earth as a visual is an apocalyptic fantasy isn’t it? As they are, the layers of earth are literally inside their own opaque sphere, rightly unavailable to any trick of light, even a sunset from another stage of star.\n\nAnd it stops my breath to know the the strange clouds billowing over Ohio are dredged up stolen minerals somewhere in their radioactive process, raining back into our water supply to show us how toxic this system is, the one that we’ve stitched across this wounded land.\n\nIn all the diagrams that show too neatly demarcated cross-sections of earth, fossils, groundwater, ancient silt, crust, mantle, core, the earth is cut open, overexposed. I feel it like a gash in my gut, which is why I won’t share one of those images here. The rings of a centuries old tree may tell a complicated beautiful story, but I want the tree to live. I’m okay with the mystery.\n\nOr maybe, as usual, this is about me. I want no further wounding. Spare me your curious incisions, too close in reasoning to the drills searching for oil in the oceanic and continental crusts of the earth right now. Stop. So we can live. Do I really have to prove my layers on this planet bleeding out? Stop all the drilling. We wouldn’t need to see the layers if we could learn to feel.\n\nI have to learn to feel these compositional chemically complex layers within me, my thinnest oceanic crust, (still miles thick). The biggest part of me, my multi-various mantle a diverse inheritance of substance under pressure. My lisopheric plates of armor over the muck underneath. What can the asthenospheric parts of me, that slog of me, not solid not liquid not neat teach me now. And what about the hot liquid metal protecting my heavy core?\n\nIt’s complicated in here. When I get heated, under pressure I change chemically, physically. Who you thought I was melts and solidifies again. And if you would learn to recognize what’s going on here you have to look beyond looking. You would have to know who I am. Under this much pressure liquid, under this much pressure solid, at this temperature rock, at this temperature sludge and remember too, I am in orbit inside myself. How can you love the parts of me that you can’t see or even touch?\n\nThere are other ways though. The reason deep earth geologists feel confident about the substantial differences in the concentric layers of earth is that their best way of measuring what is happening under the surface is by calculating the seismic waves that move through from core out to the universe. They have to listen closer and closer to the vibration of earth. Which is what I am trying to do by learning to listen to myself. Which is what I’m trying to do by loving you. I’m listening closely for how we move through this. Because at the end of the day the sky will break, the consequences fall like acid rain. And I need the solid of you, the sludge of you, the malleable the thick. I need the flow of you the metal. I need exactly this, your melting armor and all your heaviest holding close. Because love moves through us like this. Listen. And so much should remain underground. Remain. A sacred mystery. Universe bless me with a heart better than all the Geiger counters. Universe bless me with a listening worth your iron, your nickel your change. Attune me grace, to all the layers of who you are I’ll never see.\n\nP.S. If you are trying to listen to yourself more closely join me in daily practice. I’m here in Stardust and Salt and/or The God of Everyday."
