        "text": "Ed Kuepper was the guitarist and songwriter for The Saints during their legendary first run, and led art/jazz/punk band the Laughing Clowns in the 1980s. He also has a bunch of great solo records, albums with The Aints - an enviable body of recorded work. Ed has assembled a new lineup under the name The Saints 73-78 to tour those first three Saints records this November, and has also been reissuing a number of his solo records on vinyl. Get tickets and tour dates at feelpresents.com and vinyl at edkuepper1.bandcamp.com.\n\nJeff McDonald is the lead singer and guitarist for Redd Kross, the legendary LA pop/punk band, who have just released an 18-song self-titled double album. They are also the subjects of a new documentary and a forthcoming book.\n\nMike Rudd is the frontman of two legendary Australian rock bands: Spectrum, and Ariel. Spectrum landed a #1 single in 1971 with the classic song 'I'll Be Gone', and released the first Australian rock double-album that same year. Check out mikeruddbillputt.com to buy CDs, or see when Mike is playing next.\n\nVan Dyke Parks is an arranger, according to him. He is also a songwriter, solo artist, producer, and -- clearly, obviously -- a genius. He co-wrote the mystical Beach Boys album SMiLE with Brian Wilson. His 1967 debut album Song Cycle is one of the great psychedelic classics of the era. He arranged The Jungle Book song The Bare Necessities. He claims to have owned the first ever Sony Walkman on American soil, gifted to him by the boss of Warner Bros Japan, and used to write 'Sail On Sailor' with Brian. Over 80 or so minutes, Van Dyke discusses working with David Crosby, Randy Newman, Frank Zappa, Daniel Johns, Phil Ochs, Ry Cooder, Judi Collins - and -- clearly, obviously -- Brian Wilson.
