        "text": "Singer, guitarist, and composer Frank Zappa got his start writing avant-garde performance pieces for his high school orchestra in the â50s, before turning to rock. â Zappa and future bandmate Ray Collins cowrote âMemories of El Monte,â which became a doo-wop hit for The Penguins in 1963. â In 1966, his band The Mothers of Invention released the satirical concept record Freak Out, rockâs first-ever two-disc debut album. â The Mothersâ 1971 performance at the Montreux Casino inspired Deep Purple to write one of rockâs greatest anthems, âSmoke On the Water.â â 1974âs Apostrophe (â)âfeaturing the Pop hit âDonât Eat the Yellow Snowââpeaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, giving the Mothers their only Gold record. â âValley Girl,â which Zappa recorded with his 14-year-old daughter, Moon, in 1982, was his first and only Top 40 hit. â He won his first of two Grammy Awards in 1987, when Jazz From Hell was named Best Rock Instrumental Performance. â In 1995, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Lou Reed, and his daughter, Moon, delivered the acceptance speech. â Former New York Philharmonic director and composer Pierre Boulez released the critically acclaimed Boulez Conducts Zappa in 1998."
