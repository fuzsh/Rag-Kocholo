        "text": "Beat conductor and Dallas native Norvis Jr. exploded onto the global electro scene in 2013 with his first EP, Coming Down. Tonight in Brooklyn at 2:30 AM, he’s on a smoked-out stage—sweaty and tranced, working the half-lit buttons of an Akai MPK like he’s time traveling from the cockpit of a Vulcan starship. A sea of dedicated heads nod in the pitch-black-purple space to his array of complex beats. An hour later, we walk to the train station as Norvis discussed process, faith, and his Bandcamp album, Pyrrhic Victory.\n\nGenre-wise, your new joints are hard to categorize. The sounds are complex, like electro got high, met Sam Cooke, and flew him to Pluto for a date.\n\n[laughs] Wave. I was always inspired by R&B break-up-to-make-up songs.\n\nYou drop a lot of tracks. How many unreleased albums do you have total?\n\nProbably like twenty-one to twenty-four.\n\nHow do you decide which ones to put out?\n\nThose twenty-four albums are continuous. They’re never finished. So I may make a song today but categorize it with an album I did a year ago. I might have seventy-five songs on that album. Then I just choose the tracks that say what I want to say in the present. That might be just seven songs. That’ll be the album. Other songs I post on my [Soundcloud] page, I might just be feeling a groove. But it’s not a song; it’s just a groove.\n\nDid your sound develop more when you moved to Brooklyn, or was it established at home in Dallas?\n\nBrooklyn definitely had an effect on my sound, but it was more so the people in Brooklyn—Shawn [Peters], my brother Terence [Nance], who gave me the structure to understand the mechanics of beatmaking. I was mostly into rhythms.\n\nWhat’s wrong with rhythms?\n\nIn my head, I either hear no sound, or ones that sound like they’re falling apart.\n\nRight. They call your tunes “space gospel.”\n\nWell, I have a vocal-performance background from high school, opera, and jazz. I was always in church choir and also was a part of a few African drum and dance ensembles, and that brought in a lot of tonality in terms of rhythm and percussion to me at an early stage. Put the two together…\n\nHow have your beliefs and spiritual experiences influenced your music?\n\nI think folks should take a path where they find their own spirituality. If any type of spiritual experience deeply affects you—religion or whatever it may be—put it into your art. My religion is a mix of anime, Rastafarianism, Hindu, Christianity, Buddhism, and, like, Hitchhiker’s Guide [to the Galaxy]. So when I’m creating sounds, I feel like I’m jumping into a level of ether.\n\nFeature\n\nTommy Boy president Monica Lynch\n\nIcon of the ’80s New York City music scene, hip-hop linchpin and trendsetter, Monica Lynch tells her story to veteran industry insider Carol Cooper.\n\nThursday, December 1, 2022\n\nWritten by Carol Cooper\n\nFeature\n\nPulp actress Meiko Kaji broke out as a star singer\n\nActress/singer Meiko Kaji’s roles in Japanese exploitation films influenced writer-director Quinten Tarantino.\n\nWednesday, November 9, 2022\n\nWritten by Hashim Kotaro Bharoocha\n\nFeature\n\nMusic of the Unseen celebrates two heroes of orchestral funk\n\nBobbie-Jane Gardner and Brian Cross created Music of the Unseen.\n\nWednesday, October 26, 2022\n\nWritten by Allen Thayer\n\nFeature\n\nHip-hop feminist Joan Morgan on hip-hop’s misogyny\n\nHip-hop feminist Joan Morgan on hip-hop’s misogyny.\n\nThursday, May 19, 2022\n\nWritten by Travis Atria\n\nFeature\n\nSuzi Analogue of Never Normal Records\n\nSuzi Analogue’s Never Normal Records prioritizes representation and Black identity inclusive of the entire African diaspora.\n\nWednesday, May 11, 2022\n\nWritten by Karas Lamb\n\nFeature\n\nLady Wray’s heartfelt rebirth on Big Crown Records\n\nLady Wray has a heartfelt rebirth on Leon Michel’s Big Crown Records.\n\nThursday, February 3, 2022\n\nWritten by Jessica Lipsky\n\nFeature\n\nTerri Lyne Carrington tackles gender justice in jazz\n\nFounder of Berklee’s Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington is forging a new path forward from old-school mentalities.\n\nFriday, January 21, 2022\n\nWritten by Jordannah Elizabeth\n\nFeature\n\nMiriam Makeba’s Exile Years\n\nSouth African singer and activist Miriam Makeba’s Exile Years.\n\nFriday, January 14, 2022\n\nWritten by Vuyokazi Mtukela\n\nFeature\n\nGlasgow’s jazz scene emerges out from London’s shadows\n\nGlasgow’s jazz scene emerges out from London’s shadows.\n\nTuesday, January 11, 2022\n\nWritten by Maeve Hannigan\n\nFeature\n\nThe birth and rebirth of Manchester post-punk\n\nThe birth and rebirth of Manchester post-punk.\n\nTuesday, January 11, 2022\n\nWritten by Amelia Fearon\n\nFeature\n\nCulture clash in London has roots in South America\n\nMerging expressions of diaspora provoke young artists to return to their roots to find clarity of artistic expression in today’s London.\n\nTuesday, January 11, 2022\n\nWritten by Violeta Arango\n\nFeature\n\nBoulevards charts a muddy, funky journey\n\nBoulevards latest feels like a “psychedelic rock record with a soul base,” says Blake Rhein of Durand Jones and the Indications.\n\nThursday, February 10, 2022\n\nWritten by Jessica Lipsky\n\nFeature\n\nFrank Zappa’s surrealistic masterpiece film/soundtrack, 200 Motels\n\nCelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Frank Zappa’s kaleidoscopic, surrealistic masterpiece film and soundtrack, 200 Motels.\n\nTuesday, November 30, 2021\n\nWritten by A.
