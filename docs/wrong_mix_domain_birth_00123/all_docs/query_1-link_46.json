        "text": "December 7, 2016\n\nThe first third of this book is really Zappa talking in a tongue in cheek manner about his career. Unfortunately, the second two thirds is more or less ranting about people he didn't like, his politics in the 80s (which I mostly agreed with but that is NOT why I wanted to read this book) and we do not learn much about the evolution of the band over time, why he made certain musical choices, about the riotous concert in Italy, about the MTV Halloween Ball (which got him banned forever from MTV)...unfortunately, I need to find another book - probably not by Frank - if I want to learn about this history of his band and his music because this one is NOT it.\n\nMarch 27, 2015\n\nI greatly enjoyed the first part of this book. Zappa’s humorous look at his early years and musical experiences is entertaining and somewhat informative. As the book progresses, though, it becomes more of a series of rants against his various critics and pet peeves. Several of Zappa’s associates have noted that this account is largely fictionalized, tending to reflect Zappa as a more just and generous character than he actually was. I recommend reading Barry Miles’ “Frank Zappa” first, to break down some of the myths in the autobiography.\n\nThe chapter that is largely transcriptions of his defense before the British high court of justice reveals much about how Zappa can turn a phrase and redirect a conversation, changing something that obviously indicates sex to something that is ambiguous—which is humorous and fascinating. Zappa enjoys his wordplay and excels at it. At another point he asks himself “Am I sexist?” and after a fashion answers that with “Those songs are about stupid men.” (Huh?? How did we get there?) This is definitely stream of consciousness writing, complete with generous and inappropriate use of italics, bold, CAPS, and underlines, which becomes quite annoying after the first 50 pages.\n\nStill, some of the rants might be of interest, depending on your point of view. I, for example, enjoyed the chapter on Church and State very much. The chapter entitled \"Failures,\" about Zappa's ideas and projects that weren’t realized, shows some innovative thinking and conceptualizing, far ahead of his era. Read the book if you like Zappa’s music and/or satire, but feel free to skip sections you’re not enjoying. You can pick up (or leave) his stream of consciousness at any point.\n\nJanuary 10, 2009\n\nWhether you like Frank Zappa's music or not (of course you do), I can't recommend this book enough...it is Hilarious (note the capital \"H\")...he had a terrific perspective on the world, and the most perfect sense of humor. I want to read it again just thinking about it.\n\nFebruary 29, 2012\n\nI started paging through The Real Frank Zappa Book in an effort to generate band name ideas and ended up reading the entire thing cover to cover. I attribute this to three things; Zappa had an interesting life, he had interesting things to say and he was able to talk about things in an interesting manner.\n\nTRFZB is part autobiography and part philosophical exploration, the exploration being of Zappa’s mind in the form of theories, beliefs and ideas. Frankly (HA HA HA HA… sorry, couldn’t help it), I think Zappa was the exact right combination of outside the box thinker and common sense genius that it would take to be a truly positive force in the world of politics, though associating with the slime typically found in those venues would likely have driven him insane or worse. Never mind that politics has descended to a kind of organized sport with a big, dumb Superbowl every four years. At least in football they get to watch more than two teams compete. Anyway…\n\nReading TRFZB took me back to a time (it was first published in 1989) when things were different. Not better or worse but very seriously different. Music was primarily sold on physical media. The interwebs was light years away from its current incarnation as the hip, new opiate for the masses. Nirvana was just a little known band from Seattle. And the government (or their wives, really) were very concerned with the mental health and moral fiber of America’s youth. Who knows what I’m talking about? That’s right, it’s the PMRC!\n\nThe Parent Music Resource Center was the result (if we are to believe the legend) of a bored housewife hearing her daughter’s Prince LP, specifically the song “Darling Nikki” and its masturbation reference and FLIPPING OUT. This bored housewife got her other bored housewife friends together and they set out to deleteriously effect the lives of millions of people. They did this by getting their politician husbands to threaten/intimidate/manipulate organizations like the Recording Industry Association of America to force record labels to put a sticker on their releases warning of lyrical topics deemed unfit for consumption of minors. It was disgusting. It was revolting to watch these idiots use their husband’s political power to make a name for themselves as well as get those husbands’ names in the public eye.\n\nWho was that bored housewife who started all this (if we agree to excuse Prince from any culpability)? Tipper Gore. You know who her husband is? America’s environmental hero, Al Gore.\n\nI’ve never liked Gore and the PMRC is the reason. After the PMRC fervor died down, Al Gore ran for president. Obviously, it was extremely beneficial for his wife to do what she did when she did what she did to all of us. And, of course, we must acknowledge that Tipper is not a bored housewife at all but, in actuality, a black hearted snake oil salesman witch hunter who knows how to work the system.\n\nThis is why, when Gore’s film came out, I was mystified that everyone was lauding him as some kind of hero. I haven’t seen the film (get off my back, I will sooner or later and it better be more interesting than that wretched Fahrenheit 911 movie) but it can’t possibly make up for all the nonsense we had to deal with from Al and Tip. I’m just saying.\n\nDoes anyone remember the blank tape tax? That was where consumers would be charged a tax when purchasing blank tapes because everyone just knew consumers were going to “bootleg” (i.e. make tapes of their friends’ records or cassettes) the industry into bankruptcy. Who was one of the bill’s cosponsors? Al Gore.\n\nGore groupies beware; all is not what it seems in Goreville.\n\nAnother result of the PMRC, if not directly than by default, is something called Back In Control. Remember that fine organization? Back In Control claimed to be able to “de-punk” or “de-metal” your kids. Apparently they were unable to “de-country” or “de-disco” your kids, or were uninterested, in spite of any suggestive lyrics that may have existed in those “genres.” Your kids were taken away to a place where they were essentially brainwashed into being good Christians. It was like any cult, only it was sanctioned by America, mom and her apple pie. I’m done talking about Back In Control because it gives me the willies but, if you aren’t familiar, it makes for as good a bedtime read as any horror story.\n\nI think it’s unfortunate for society that Zappa passed away so young because we could all use a little of his input right now. We still have Jello Biafra but he gets so worked up and crazy! I think Zappa would be able to provide the clear, concise, level headed analysis that we need in today’s intellectually bankrupt era. For example:\n\n“Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is the basic building block of the universe. I dispute that. I say there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic building block of the universe.”\n\nHe’s correct. And that was from 1989. If Zappa were here today, he’d be even more beautiful and powerful than he was then! More than twenty years more beautiful and powerful! His foresight is truly awesome:\n\n“In the future, etiquette will become more important. That doesn’t mean knowing which fork to pick up – I mean basic consideration for the rights of other animals (human beings included) and the willingness, whenever practical, to tolerate the other guy’s idiosyncrasies.”\n\nThat’s proven to be true, especially with the worldwide population approaching seven billion. I’d say etiquette is right up at the top of the list.\n\nBut, what about the music? Zappa’s a music guy, right? Zappa’s reflections on music have always been prescient and insightful. Being a musician, I value the man’s knowledge and experience mightily. Being a consumer, I value his inherent need to challenge the status quo. As a kid, it was empowering to hear Zappa urging me to think for myself and not just go with the flow when it came to how I spent my entertainment dollars. Zappa’s philosophy:\n\n“If it sounds GOOD to YOU, it’s bitchen; and if it sounds BAD to YOU, it’s sh*tty.”\n\nAnd that is exactly true. That simple theory holds water and prevents one from becoming a moneymaking tool for a bunch of rich a*sholes. Remember how the psycho in American Psycho had a CD collection of the current hits and cycled out the old stuff periodically? That’s sociopathic consumerism! I think.\n\nZappa puts forth words of wisdom on a dizzying variety of useful topics, from parenting to politics to education to religion. He also provides perhaps the most entertaining Frank Zappa bio possible, covering childhood, youth, The Mothers, his family and more. He refers to what he does as “amateur anthropology,” which just tickles me to no end. I think he’s incredible and I miss his presence in this crazy old world and I very much wish he had written more. You just know he would be an outstanding guest on The John Stewart Show or The Colbert Report. Hell, I'm sure he'd have his own show.\n\nOddly enough, everything he has to say about politics, finances, religion, education, etc. still holds true today more than twenty years later. And that’s just sad. Remember those Virginia Slims ads? “You’ve come a long way, baby,” they praised. Well, the reverse is true for the world today. This baby has stayed more or less where it started, screaming and crying and sitting in a dirty diaper. We have ipads and Twitter (i.e. diaper rash) but most of the same things are pretty much as bad as they ever were.\n\nI’d like to praise the artwork to be found in TRFZB, all of which was done by one A. West. I figure this isn’t Adam West of Batman/Family Guy fame, but it’s kind of fun to think it is. It’s more fun to have these pictures to accompany the text. They are awesome.\n\nTRFZB is a fantastic read and I consider it something of a classic in the realm of music autobiography. Zappa’s wit is razor keen and dry as the desert. This is such a fun book to read and I’m so glad a happy accident led to me reading it again.\n\nUnfortunately, I still don’t have a band name.\n\nFebruary 27, 2021\n\nZappa the musician and composer is cooler than Zappa the personality, aspiring political figure, memoirist, or social commentator. Not that he was bad at any of those things. If you haven't though, listen to Overnight Sensation, Apostrophe, and if you're still amused try Joe's Garage.\n\nNovember 1, 2012\n\nLet me say right off that I love Frank Zappa. His albums, especially 'Freak Out' and 'We're Only in it For the Money,' were part of the soundtrack of my youth. They added their own secret herbs to the olio of my musical personality. But this book is a disappointment. It's got way, way too much about his appearance before Congress and his disdain for organized religion (though God knows I love zingers against politicians and Jerry Falwell--but just because he's right doesn't make it not boring) and not enough about, you know, his MUSIC. He comes off as arrogant though often funny. There is also a non-chronological lack of flow to the book. I couldn't help but think, Jeez, he must have better stories than these. His Captain Beefheart stories alone, I imagine, would make a better book. Still, there are piquant lines like: “’Conducting’ is when you draw ‘designs’ in the nowhere—with a stick, or with your hands—which are interpreted as ‘instructional messages’ by guys wearing bow ties who wish they were fishing.”\n\nJuly 15, 2008\n\nVery important in my teenage years. Introduced me to a lot of important ideas, none so important as the John Cage bit: \"If John Cage, for instance, says 'I'm putting a contact microphone on my throat, and I'm going to drink carrot juice, and that's my composition,' then his gurgling qualifies as his composition because he put a frame around it and said so. 'Take it or leave it, I now will this to be music.' After that, it's a matter of taste.\"\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nI love the way his mind worked.\n\nFebruary 10, 2014\n\nI read this book so long ago.\n\nIt belonged to my boyfriend at the time, Michael Schneider. We were on a road trip from New Orleans to Milwaukee, where he grew up. We were going to visit his family. I was meeting his family for the first time. We had car trouble and ended up getting stuck in Effingham, Illinois. I read this book while we waited for car repairs. It was hilarious and I laughed out loud a lot. It saved my sanity.\n\nHere's the poem i wrote about that trip, which includes a bit about this book.\n\nOn Our Way to Milwaukee\n\nThe Celica broke down in Effingham, Illinois.\n\nThe problem was the alternator\n\nor radiator\n\nor some such shit.\n\nI remember there was smoke\n\n(or was it steam?)\n\npouring from under the hood,\n\nand we had to pull\n\nonto the dark shoulder of the interstate\n\nand wait for a tow truck to appear.\n\nYou were angry—\n\nyou who were usually so good natured and jovial—\n\nyou cursed your bad luck\n\nand flipped off the car\n\nyou had bought used\n\nonly a few months before.\n\nI took a picture of you—\n\ncomical in your anger—\n\nthinking I’d show it to our children one day,\n\ntell them this was the trip\n\nwhen their mother first met\n\ntheir Wisconsin grandparents.\n\nWe spent the night in a cheap hotel room,\n\nbut were too exhausted to have sex—\n\nquite a waste\n\nfor two dorm-dwelling college students\n\nwho never had enough privacy\n\nor free time.\n\nWe ate breakfast at Arby’s\n\n(or was it Hardee’s?)\n\nand saw a thin, middle-aged man\n\ndressed as the Statue of Liberty.\n\nI realized that New Orleans\n\nwasn’t the only place with\n\neccentrics and freaks.\n\nWe spent the whole hot day\n\nat a gas station garage\n\nwaiting for repairs.\n\nI read your copy of Frank Zappa’s\n\nautobiography\n\nand laughed my ass off.\n\nIn less than a year,\n\nyou dumped me and\n\n–thank goodness—\n\nwe never had any kids\n\nto look at that photo.\n\nAugust 2007\n\nJanuary 19, 2021\n\nI tend to avoid reading books about musicians that are written by other than the actual musicians. Frank Zappa seems to agree with me...\n\n\"One of the reasons for doing this (the book) is the proliferation of stupid books which purport to be about me. I thought there ought to be at least ONE, somewhere, that had real stuff in it.\"\n\nThe first half was light, fun reading about Frank's early life, forming the Mothers of Invention, and their crazy tales of the counter-culture 60s. The second half was Frank's uber cynical diatribes against his favorite targets to include religion and televangelists, big government including proxy wars, IRS and tax exemptions, greedy record label execs, AIDS, communism, colonialism, racism, ignorant rock journalists, CNN, inept parents, selective education, etc, etc. The crest of his anger was his formal statement to Congress regarding the Record Industry Association of America's (RIAA) labeling of certain albums as pornographic. Ironically, none of his sexually explicit lyrics/albums were tagged as porn. Yet Captain & Tennille was! And sadly, none of the tagged musicians showed up for the congressional hearings. Who did? Frank, ofcourse, along with John Denver and Dee Snider, who unfortunately did not scream \"WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT!\"\n\nSome seriously heavy subjects and somewhat depressing...but that's Frank. He not only composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, and orchestral works...his actions (read the book) immortalized him as the poster child of avant-garde and outspoken nonconformity. Now I'm ready to watch the recently released biographical documentary \"Zappa\". Great googly moogly!\n\nNovember 10, 2007\n\nThis is a brilliant and very funny book. It has great insights into the current state of America, music, politics, televangelism, and much more. The biography of Zappa is only a small part of the book. The rest is devoted to his thought on various issues, and deserves reading. An excellent read!\n\nMay 25, 2017\n\nstarted out great, seemed to be full of delightful anecdotes and stories, but in the meantime transformed into boring babbling about pretty much everything. i prefer different streams of consciousness.\n\nMarch 21, 2017\n\nპოლიტიკის მიმართ ოდნავი ინტერესი მაინც რომ მქონდეს იმ ერთ ვარსკვლავს არ ჩამოვაკლებდი ამ ოქრო კაცს <3\n\nSeptember 8, 2018\n\nI bought this because I wanted to read whatever Frank Zappa wanted to write a book about.\n\nOnly, he didn't want to write a book. In fact, the very first sentence reads \"I don't want to write a book, but I'm going to do it anyway, because Peter Occhiogrosso is going to help me.\"\n\nThis book is actually pretty damn cute, oddly enough. I had a little flick through when I first got it, and landed on a page with the title, centered and in bold: \"My Fabulous Wife\", with three photos (there are lots of black and white photos, a full-page illustration for each chapter, and random illustrations scattered around the book), of Gail placed neatly beneath it, followed by a little description of how they met. Adorable. I don't think I would have expected to see anything like that anywhere other than the secret diary of a much younger man. He also references the lyrics of some of his songs and uses them in describing certain events, people, situations, etc.\n\nFrank Zappa was a composer / musician, definitely not a writer, and the way he writes seriously couldn't be further away from the way he speaks. He likes emphasis. Quite a lot. There's so much passionate FORMATTING AND CAPS! Frank couldn't get enough of it. The text is constantly emphasized using capitals, bold, italics, and underlining. He also manages to fit in 11 \"(don't laugh)\"'s into this book. Eleven. Again, cute, but it did get a little jarring after a while, but hey, that's obviously how he wanted it to be, and I wanted to read something by him, so there we go.\n\nThere was a definite sense that he started to get bored and frustrated with the whole book ordeal around three quarters of the way through, and the entire thing derails completely, veering away from the chronology of his life and music, and into pretty much whatever seems to pop into his mind at the time. The lyrical quotations die down, and he babbles passionately about his views on politics, some very.. interesting ideas about health, drugs, and cigarettes (because nicotine isn't really like those other drugs, okie?), and the general state of affairs occurring in the US and government around the time he was writing.\n\nI knew people got tired of the ramblings, as I also did, but I still wanted to read this just because it's the only book he wrote. I decided I'd read this before reading any other book on his life. It's every bit worth it if you just wanted to read something by him.\n\nOctober 26, 2020\n\nZappa was phenomenal. He was a self taught musician and composer. His enormous output ran from rock to jazz to orchestral in recordings, film and performance. His work could be humorous or experimental. The book was written 4 years before his death in 1993.\n\nThe style and attitude are as you would expect. He rambles from thought to thought. There is a lot of satire and great turns of phrase. You learn a bit about him, but more about his opinions on censorship, drug wars, taxes and the music industry. His most biting critiques relate to religion, particularly the televangelists that were popular in the 80’s.\n\nHe writes of the technology used in music (up to 1988 or so) and his experiences with symphony orchestras and unions. Most interesting to me were the parts on his family life and how he and his wife run the business end of his enterprise. Other interesting parts were his (admittedly arrogant) advice to young potential composers and his views on why artists don’t take chances.\n\nThere is a lot of filler. There are song lyrics; an interview; letters to the music industry and officials; a quote from IRS policy; his testimony regarding labeling music for sexual content, and more. 18 pages are devoted to a dialog from a trial in England where the London Symphony Orchestra sought to back out of a contract due to objections about his works – not the works to be used in the performance.\n\nThere is a comic-style drawing on about half the pages… some are funny, some are cute.\n\nI would have liked more on how he got his start. He covers it in sound bites. .. he met this person, he bought a studio, lost the studio, set up another, recruited a band, named it Mothers but had to change it, recorded, etc.\n\nWhere is interesting perspective on 1980’s culture, music industry and politics, this will only be of interest to those who know and appreciate his work.\n\nApril 27, 2021\n\nWhen it comes to biographies there's always a flow to them. You have the standard one that follows the highs and crashing lows of success and then you have the ones that are just revealing enough to make the casual reader feel as if they know the person they''re reading about. Zappa figured since other people were writing about him it why not write his own book about his life. The problem is, it's not a by the numbers bio at all and that's what it makes it so interesting. Instead of a by the numbers tell all, you get Zappa's opinions on a variety of subjects along with some of his early years. It's not exactly a bio at all and more of a book that reveals the thoughts that go on in Zappa's head. The political aspects will no doubt turn off a great many readers, but that's expected. His sense of humor clearly isn't for everyone and for those who aren't fans won't see the point in reading this. More than likely they'll wander off and find another book about Zappa that wasn't written by Zappa. Reading this after his passing the book becomes something else entirely and I'm sure that wasnt something Zappa intended. It was just a way for him to tell his story his way because he was the only one who could tell it accurately. Will the casual fan lile this? Maybe some of it, but not all of it and that's not surprising. Casual fans just want something that goes from point A to point B without a lot of bullshit while the fans want something they can enjoy and feel as if they're close to Zappa and this book achieves that. We all know that he can sometimes be offensive and a bit of an asshole and the book offers no apologies nor does it care what you think. It's Zappa unfiltered, and while those other Zappa books may have more of the mundane stuff they don't contain the spirit of Zappa. That's what makes it so good.\n\nFebruary 7, 2008\n\nWhen I discovered the music of Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention way back in 1970, I wasn't ready for it. W/in a few mnths I was all about it. I was 16 & this was, indeed, the music that got me really excited. It was experimental, it was rock'n'roll, it had some politics, it had some satire, it was complicated, it did the trick for me. I 1st heard the Mothers of Invention live when I skipped school on my graduation day to hitch-hike north of Baltimore to hear them in Harrisburg. THEY WERE GREAT! Very funny, very together. They were also starting to deteriorate into juvenilia. Nonetheless, Zappa continued to crank out the records that I was interested in & a new release was always exciting.. until things like some of those mid-70s live albums came out. Anyway, the more experimental & jazzy Zappa was, the more I liked him; the more \"Titties & Beer\" he got, the more I got bored. Then I lost interest altogether. Shortly before he died he started doing a few things that interested me again - about wch I was quite happy! Then, fuck it!, he died in 1992 - a mere sprat! W/ a zillion recordings left behind but so much more that he cd've done. Too bad.\n\nSo here's an authorized ghost-written autobiography. What Zappa enthusiast cd resist? All that droll commentary, setting the record straight & the like. No doubt, Zappa had alotof stupid bullshit written about him by alotof incomprehending hostile people over the yrs & no doubt it's still almost MIRACULOUS that his music STILL isn't played on rock radio stns while the most producer-created DREK sickens the airwaves unto death, BUT, LET'S FACE IT, Zappa pulled it off w/ balls & perseverance almost unprecedented in the rock music industry. Hats off to his memory!\n\nMay 8, 2008\n\nMusic is the best, and Zappa's music is among the best. What a shame then that most people know him for his reputation for being outspoken, for defending the right to swear on a record and for recording smutty lyrics. That was just the day job. Zappa wasn't interested in fashion, and so he was not that interested in getting airplay on the record-industry controlled airwaves. What comes across clearly in this conversation with Peter Occhiogrosso (doesn't that sound like a name Zappa would invent for one of his songs - sorry Peter) is Zappa's wish to be seen as a composer. Yes he had a few laughs - many of them lovingly recounted for us in these pages - and yes he unapologetically pissed a lot of people off, but he was just annoyed that he couldn't get on with creating something of value for the future because so many resources were being squandered on appalling musical tat. The book reads like a series of anecdotes on pet subjects, and is liberally illustrated with cartoons, photos and bizarre doodles. However, if you are a Zappa fan (and you would have to be talking about the music, not the man) then you really cannot miss this out. It will really help you to catch a glimpse of the way this unique man viewed his life, his art and his surroundings. Not to be missed.\n\nJuly 6, 2011\n\nI always thought Frank Zappa was overrated. I wasn't quite sure why he was famous.\n\nAnyway, this book was boring and full of hot air. I started reading it and after a while I realized it wasn't getting better. I skimmed it, which is pretty easy to do because it is divided into little tiny sections with headings like, \"Why People Don't Understand My Stuff.\" I guess I am one of those people.\n\nShelved as 'filmed'\n\nMay 21, 2015\n\nHERE's a REAL fake=Review ;; one that won't make you hurl.\n\nPlease listen as our Central Scrutinizer saves us from the dangers of Music ::\n\nWelcome to\n\nJoe's Garage -- the whole damn thing!!!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCw2y8...\n\nThe White Zone is for loading and unloading only....\n\nNovember 24, 2012\n\nВ 1988 году издатели из ныне покойного Poseidon Press уломали Фрэнку Заппу написать книгу собственных мемуаров. Получив в качестве литературного негра журналиста Питера Оккиогроссо, Заппа пустился по волнам собственной памяти и породил море качественных и эффектных лулзов. История детства и юности Заппы – безупречная сага coming-of-age. Помесь Хогбенов и фильмов поколения “Бунтовщика без причины”.\n\nПапа устроился метеорологом в Эджвудский арсенал. Во время Второй мировой войны там делали отравляющий газ, а метеоролог, насколько я понимаю, определял направление ветра, когда придет время выпускать эту дрянь.\n\nПапа приносил мне из лаборатории поиграть всякое оборудование: мензурки, оплетенные бутыли с узким горлом, маленькие чашки Петри с ртутью — с шариками ртути. И я вечно со всем этим играл. Весь пол моей спальни был в этой «гадости» — ртуть пополам с катышками пыли. Одна из моих непременных тогдашних забав — высыпать ртуть на пол и колотить по ней молотком, пока не заляпает всю комнату. Я жил в ртути…\n\n…Когда изобрели ДДТ, отец принес домой целый мешок — он в чулане стоял. Нет, я ДДТ не ел, ничего такого, хотя папа сказал, что можно! — предполагалось, что порошок безвреден и убивает только клопов…\n\n…В округе на все лады обсуждался «новый способ» лечения гайморита. Путем запихивания радия в ноздри. (Слыхали что-нибудь подобное?) Родители отвели меня к очередному врачу-итальянцу, и хотя их намерения мне были неведомы, я особого удовольствия не ждал. У доктора было нечто вроде длинной проволоки — фут, а то и больше, — с шариком радия на конце. Он запихнул проволоку мне в нос, а там — в обе пазухи. (Вероятно, следовало проверить, не светится ли в темноте мой носовой платок.)…\n\n…Часть квартирной платы папа покрывал за счет добровольного участия в испытаниях химического (а может, даже биологического) оружия. Называлось «кожная аллергическая проба». Военные не говорили, что накладывают на кожу, а ты соглашался не расчесывать и не заглядывать под повязку, — но за каждую пробу платили десятку. Через пару недель все снимали.\n\nКаждую неделю папа приходил домой с тремя-четырьмя такими штуковинами на руках и на разных частях тела. Не знаю, что это была за дрянь и как она могла повлиять на его здоровье (или на здоровье любого из детей, родившихся после того, как с ним это проделали)…\n\n…Мамина мама не говорила по-английски и поэтому рассказывала нам сказки по-итальянски — к примеру, про «мано пелуса», волосатую руку. «Мано пелуса! Вене куа!» — говорила она страшным «бабушкиным голосом», что должно было означать: «Волосатая рука! Иди сюда!» — а потом пальцами проводила по моей руке. Вот чем занимались люди, когда не было телевидения…\n\nВторая четверть книги – про бытие музыкантом. Предполагалось, что Заппа станет травить байки из собственной жизни, но он всячески избегает это делать, коварно выдавив за всю книгу меньше десятка и почти все безобидные. Про спящего на кухне Джимми Хендриса, про вытаскивающего у него занозу из ноги Мика Джаггера, про Саймона и Гарфункеля, выступающих под именем “Том и Джерри”. И еще про Дюка, да.\n\n…Явились облаченный в смокинг Джон Уэйн с двумя телохранителями, еще один малый и две дамы в вечерних платьях — все очень пьяные. Приблизившись, Джон Уэйн схватил меня, поднял и принялся хлопать по спине с воплями: «Я видел тебя в Египте, ты был великолепен… а потом ты у меня отсосал!»\n\nМне он сразу не понравился.\n\nЗал был переполнен. Выйдя на сцену в начале последнего отделения, я объявил: «Дамы и господа, как вам известно, сегодня канун Дня Всех Святых. Мы ждали сегодня очень важных гостей — к нам должен был прийти Джордж Линкольн Рокуэлл, вождь Американской Нацистской партии, — к сожалению, он прийти не смог, — но зато здесь присутствует Джон Уэйн».\n\nТолько я это сказал, как он встал из-за столика, доковылял до танцплощадки и принялся держать речь. Я протянул вниз микрофон, чтобы всем было слышно; он нес какую-то ахинею, вроде «…и если меня изберут, обещаю…». Тут один телохранитель схватил его и усадил на место. Другой вернул мне микрофон и велел остыть, пригрозив БОЛЬШИМИ НЕПРИЯТНОСТЯМИ.\n\nВ конце представления директор клуба подошел ко мне и сказал: «Будь с Герцогом повежливей. В таком состоянии он начинает швыряться пятидесятидолларовыми купюрами». На пути к выходу я должен был миновать его столик. Когда я шел мимо, он встал и кулаком смял шляпу у меня на голове. Я ее снял и расправил тулью. Это явно вывело его из себя, поскольку он заорал: «Тебе что, не нравится, как я привожу в порядок шляпы?! Да я этим уже сорок лет занимаюсь!» Я вновь нахлобучил шляпу на голову, а он опять ее смял. Тогда я сказал: «Я вам даже не дам возможности извиниться» — и вышел…\n\nНекоторые фрагменты – чистый Филип Дик в его бытовом модусе.\n\n…Джерри было лет тридцать пять — сорок, и он уже не один год числился постоянным пациентом психиатрических лечебниц. Он сидел на амфетаминах. Когда он был ребенком, мать (работавшая в управлении надзора за условно осужденными) подарила ему «Анатомию» Грея. Послушно прочитав книгу, он заметил, что на некоторых изображениях мышц говорится: «Мышца такая-то и такая-то, если имеется…»; вот он и задумал развивать ту мускулатуру человеческого тела, которая «если имеется». Он разработал «систему упражнений» для тех «особых областей», где со времени написания книги никогда не водилось мышечной ткани.\n\nНа культуриста он не смахивал, но был очень силен. Он двумя руками гнул арматуру (стальные стержни для укрепления бетона), кладя прут на загривок. В результате всех этих экспериментов все его тело покрылось нелепыми буграми — однако это было только начало.\n\nВ один прекрасный день Джерри обнаружил в себе любовь — а может, даже страсть — к электричеству. Он любил получать удары током, и его не раз забирали в кутузку, когда ничего не подозревавшие обитатели пригорода обнаруживали, что он стоит у них во дворе, прижавшись головой к электросчетчику только из желания оказаться к нему поближе.\n\nОднажды они с другом по той же причине перепрыгнули через забор на силовую подстанцию «Николс-Кэннон». Друг едва до смерти не поджарился. Джерри остался цел и невредим…\n\n…У Бешеного Билла было хобби. Все манекены были разрисованы и снабжены резиновыми протезами, чтоб он мог их ебать. По праздникам он приглашал к себе народ на «еблю его семейки», куда входил и манекен маленькой девочки (по имени Кэролин Пиздли)…\n\n…По сравнению с Джерри и Биллом, Ленни Брюс был вполне нормален. По словам Джаднича, в то время Ленни имел обыкновение, нарядившись врачом, всю ночь слушать марши Сузы и составлять ходатайства в суд. Вообще, Южная Калифорния была в те дни весьма колоритна — однако парочка республиканских администраций — и остался пшик!\n\nВторая половина книги – про работу, про семью и про политику. Как это обычно бывает в мемуарах, уже без шуток и прибауток, слегка занудно. Вдобавок, согласно собственной позиции, заявленной на первых страницах. Под конец, когда у автора начинается баттхерт в адрес рейгановской администрации, становится просто скучно, но Заппе это легко прощаешь. Он - крутой.\n\n…Автобиографию обычно пишут те, кто считает свою жизнь воистину необыкновенной. Я не считаю свою жизнь необыкновенной ни в каком отношении, однако возможность высказывать в печати всякую чушь о посторонних вещах весьма заманчива.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\nAn entertaining nonlinear life story told in a spectacularly sarcastic, laugh-out-loud writing style that lays bare the inner-workings of the world's most eccentric asshole. The last third of the book can be skipped if you are not interested in semi-irrelevant 80s libertarian political/legal philosophizing.\n\nSeptember 26, 2020\n\nThis is the most complete, and authentic biography of the late, great Frank Zappa. No afficianado of this fantastic composer/rock guitarist can claim their library is complete without this volume. To read this book is to glimpse the true genius that is Zappa, and to recognize what a fantastic impact he had on modern music that continues to this day. As he was fond of quoting the early 20th century experimental percussionist, Edgar Varese, \"The modern day composer refuses to die!\"\n\nNeither will Frank Zappa.\n\nApril 26, 2018\n\nמעט מאד מוזיקאים יכולים להתגאות בגוף עבודות כה גדול ומגוון כמו פראנק זאפה. מעט יותר מוזיקאים , ובמיוחד מוזיקאי רוק, זכו לתואר \"גאון\" עוד בחייהם. פראנק זאפה היה כזה ועוד יותר מכך: הוא היה גם סופר, מחזאי, יצר כ- 10 סרטים, איש משפחה שמרן (מפתיע עד כמה..), סאטיריקן פוליטי מושחז ופעיל פוליטי שנרתם בעיקר למאבק נגדל תאגידים נצלניים ונגד צנזורה, בעיקר מינית, אותה הובילו טיפר גור (אשתו של אל גור סגן נשיא ארה\"ב לשעבר) וחברותיה. כ\"כ זאפה היה כמעט בלתי ניתן להגדרה מבחינה מוזיקלית וכמה מטובי המוזיקאים והנגנים יצאו מ\"בית הגידול\" שלו. כמו לא מעט גאונים, זאפה הלך לעולמו מוקדם מדי ובמקרה שלו בגיל 53 ממחלת הסרטן הארורה.\n\nלדעתי הספר הזה יעניין בעיקר מעריצים של פרנק זאפה המוזיקאי (כמוני..). הספר, שיצא לאור לראשונה בשנת 1996, לוקה בתרגום בעייתי ואפילו מעצבן בעיקר בכל אותם קטעים בהם המתרגם מתעקש לתרגם את שמות האלבומים או הספרים וכו' לעברית... וכך אלבום כמו למשל \"הוט ראטס\" (נרשם בעברית בשל היפוך הכיוון באתר) מובא בספר כחולדות לוהטות... וזה עוד במקרה הטוב כיוון שבדוגמה זו לא ממש בעיה לקורא העברי ההדיוט (בשפה האנגלית) לתרגם אחורנית לאנגלית, אבל מדוע מגיע לי ולשכמותי העונש הזה לתרגם חזרה מעברית לאנגלית האלבום כמו Burnt Weeny Sandwich?..\n\nגם בלי קשר לכך לטעמי יש מקום לתרגום חדש ועריכה מהודקת, במיוחד בפרקים המוקדשים לפעילות הפוליטית של זאפה שבחלקם הגדול מעניינים יותר את הקורא האמריקאי.\n\nמפתיע לגלות שזאפה הגה (ואין לי מושג אם היה הראשון) כבר בשנות השמונים את הרעיון של שינוי המודל העסקי אצל תעשיית המוזיקה ומעבר למכירת קבצים דיגיטליים דרך קווי הטלפון או הטלוויזיה בכבלים. חברות כמו \"ספוטיפיי\" הגשימו את החזון הזה הלכה למעשה הרבה לאחר מותו. עוד פרט שהפתיע אותי הוא זה שזאפה הודה שלמעט השירים שכללו סאטירה פוליטית, אותם הוא נהנה לכתוב, כל שאר השירים שכללו הומור שחלקו \"נמוך\" ולעיתים \"מלוכלך\" לא היו באים לאוויר העולם לולא העובדה שהמוזיקה האינסטרומנטלית איננה פופולרית ולכן היה צורך לבצע התאמות ווקליות וזאת מהפחד לאבד פרנסה...\n\nהספר מבחינת העניין הכללי שלי הן כמעריץ אבל גם כקורא שאיננו אמריקאי צריך לקבל 3 כוכבים, לא יותר מכך. ציפיתי שזאפה יירד לרזולוציות יותר ממוקדות שתכלולנה יותר סיפורים מאחורי הקלעים של הקלטות אלבומים ופרטים פיקנטיים וגם רכילותיים [מה יש, גם אני בן אדם :)] על חברי ההרכבים שלו לדורותיהם ובאופן כללי אנקדוטות מתוך המסעות המוזיקליים שלו לאורך השנים (וכאלו ישנם בספר אבל מעט מדי לטעמי). למרות האמור לעיל העובדה שנתתי בסופו של דבר 4 כוכבים נובעת מהאישיות הכה מיוחדת של זאפה המספר, מהאינטיליגנציה הגבוהה שלו שמשופעת בתובנות שונות ומהכתיבה ההומוריסטית האופיינית לו כל כך בשיריו.\n\nלסיום וכדי להדגים את הפאן העוקצני באישיותו של זאפה, אביא את הציטוט הבא מתוך ראיון ישן:\n\n\"הגדרת עיתונות רוק: אנשים שאינם מסוגלים לכתוב, עורכים ראיונות עם אנשים שלא מסוגלים לחשוב, לצורך הכנת מאמרים עבור אנשים שלא מסוגלים לקרוא\" (פרק 11 עמ' 176)\n\nMay 14, 2015\n\nPublished four years before his death in 1993, this autobiography explores various facets of Zappa’s life including his childhood, career as one of the weirdest musicians in rock music, and censorship battles against Washington legislators. Gifted with the ability to create a clever turn of phrase, Zappa utilizes his own brand of humor to tell his side of the story.\n\nI am a huge fan of Zappa’s music. When I found out he had published a memoir, I immediately wanted to read it. However, I made the mistake of having expectations going into it. What I wanted was a personal reflection of Zappa’s career and educated analyses of the development of traditional and non-traditional music. I did indeed get that, but I also got so much more.\n\nTowards the last third of the book, Zappa’s tone becomes more political and less introspective in terms of a comprehensive history of his life. The shift in tone begins with his recount of the media and political fights against the Parents Music Resource Center during the mid-1980s. Since my belief in the First Amendment principle of freedom of speech is unwavering, I have always found this part of Zappa’s history fascinating. His tireless activism to protect the rights of musicians against censorship is admirable. However, this then gives him a platform to expand on his other ideas as a practical conservative (Yes, he was a conservative). These ideas include a criticism of socialism, anti-union tirades, conspiracy theories about the U.S. government’s involvement with secret wars in Nicaragua, condemnation of television evangelicals, the ramifications of poorly-written tax codes, and anything else he might have an opinion on. Plus, this is the only book I have read ending with telling me to go register to vote.\n\nI did get what I wanted from the book. I got the gross-out road stories as well as the industry secrets only a pioneering veteran of rock would know. Though, I wish it offered those topics in a more substantive way. Zappa was a genius in his own right and is noted for being a very intelligent man. But, that guy sure loved to talk. In fact, he didn’t even write this book. He dictated it, had it transcribed, and then made edits. I felt like someone was ranting at me in book form. Less talk and more rock, I say.\n\nMarch 7, 2008\n\nRegarding my thoughts on Zappa and his excellent ouerve, see my review of Kelly Fisher Lowe's book.\n\nThis autobiography/polemic makes for a zestier read, although the last 50-90 pages of it descend rapidly through stages of acerbic wit from critical observation to rant to diatribe to screed. (You know there's trouble any time a writer begins moving from italics to boldface to BOTH IN ALL CAPS WITH MULTIPLE EXCLAMATION POINTS!!! ) I'm guessing that Zappa lost interest in self-censoring (or the project) after 250 or so pages. No matter. It's otherwise funny and always thought-provoking.\n\nMy favorite insight? Frank Zappa managed to be as productive as he was by routinely staying up all hours of the night and sleeping during the day. (He apparently undertook a constantly circulating schedule of 8-10 hour sleep periods and 14-16-hour waking periods, irrespective of whether these were day or night.) There's a price, of course. Zappa's schedule requires:\n\n(1) A spouse who can and is willing to manage all of your business and household affairs, so you can focus on your art and writings.\n\n(2) Enjoyment of, at best, sporadic contact with your wife and children (depending on the period of your sleep/wake cycle).\n\n(3) Being relegated to eating peanut butter straight from the jar if no other prepared food is ready to hand (Zappa had four kids who ate up whatever they had during the day and neither he nor his wife cooked or cared to invest the time needed to prepare a decent meal).\n\n(4) Being considered completely antisocial, if not outright misanthropic (biographer Barry Miles' conclusion, but note that Zappa cites the classic introvertism of fearing conversation with others as extremely hard work).\n\n(5) Accepting that your self-imposed isolation may reinforce already extreme thought-processes.\n\nAll in all, a marvelous companion to his music.\n\nFebruary 14, 2012\n\nIn the real Frank Zappa Book, we get to hear from the man himself, about his career, music, politics, and variety of other subjects. This is probably not the best written book on all things Zappa, but what we get here is shades of the brand of humor and philosophical thought that is familiar to fans of Zappa. The book, which takes us from Zappa’s Maryland childhood to the present, that is, the ‘80’s in which the book was written, is basically divided into two parts. The first part, Zappa talks about his childhood, moving to California, forming a band and getting a record deal, while in the second, we get mostly get Zappa’s views on the politics, culture, and music that shaped the ‘80’s.\n\nAs a fan of Frank Zappa, I enjoyed this book, which serves as part autobiography and part collection of personal musings. Taken as a whole it does not only provide a glimpse into the man’s views and life, but an insight into the culture of the 60’s, 70’s and the ‘80’s, which provides a context into what Zappa was trying to accomplish with his music, that is, create a form of satire and reflection of society through an artfom rooted in several long standing musical traditions."
