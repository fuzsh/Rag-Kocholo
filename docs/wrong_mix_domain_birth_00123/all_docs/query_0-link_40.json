I have family that lives there. And if my memory is right, I think thats where Warren Cucarillo comes from. From: Jonathan Kiebon <jkiebon@mail.idt.net>\n\nCanarsie is not just a Guitar piece on shut up-n- play it's the Home & birthplace of several notable Zappa alumni i.e Warren(Sophia Warren) Cuccurullo,i Al(Officer Butzis Malkin). From: dankitti99@aol.com\n\nIt's the place where Everyone Looks The Same. From: \"William H. Clements\" <clements@ontos.com>\n\nMy wife says every THING looks the same there. If you go to any street corner in Carnarsie, you see precisely the same configuration of buildings. To Album Refs\n\nTo Global Refs Waitta minute, waitta minute,\n\nI think I like the poem better than the\n\njumping. More poetry, please!\n\n\"Rotten gulls beating with large rubber sails!\n\nWho cares? Now it is light!\"\n\nAlone in the hissing laboratory of his wishes,\n\nMr. Pugh minces among bad vats and jerebaums,\n\nspinneys of murdering herbs,\n\nAnd prepares to compound for Mrs. Pugh\n\nA venomous porridge hitherto unknown to toxicologists\n\nFrom: a930m14m@eds.ecip.nagoya-u.ac.jp (TAN Mitsugu)\n\nAnyway, I've found another piece of information on YCDTOSA Vol.1. It's not my own finding, though. It's from Society Pages #7. I've read the lyrics of Vol.1, and this reading reminded me of an article which was in the 'DIDJA KNOW...' column of SP #7. It says: DIDJA KNOW the origin of that twisted poem (\"Alone in the hissing laboratory of his wishes...etc.\") that Frank recites during the \"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\" suite from YCDTOSA, VOL.1? It comes from \"Under Milk Wood\", a poem by Dylan Thomas. Since Frank misquotes the middle part of the poem, dropping a few words, it would seem that he must have been reciting it from memory. I tried to check it by going to my university's library. Then I did find the quoted paragragh. Here's the original: Alone in the hissing laboratory of his wishes,\n\nMr Pugh minces among bad vats and jeroboams,\n\ntiptoes through spinneys of murdering herbs,\n\nagony dancing in his crucibles, and mixes\n\nespecially for Mrs Pugh a venomous porridge\n\nunknown to toxicologists which will scald and\n\nviper through her until her ears fall off like figs,\n\nher toes grow big and black as balloons,\n\nand steam comes screaming out of her navel.\n\nSource: Society Pages #7, p.52. Dylan Thomas, \"Under Milk Wood\", J.M.Dent & Sons Ltd., London, 1954, p.63. It's interesting that while FZ himself said 'reading a book make me sleep', he did remember Dylan Thomas's poetry. The result of higher education? From: \"Carlton B Morgan\" <carltonb@popeth.freeserve.co.uk>\n\nCheck this out: very shortly after the passage of Dylan Thomas quoted by Frank on \"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\" stage version, another character in the play, Lord Cutglass, \"drinks from a bowl marked Fido\". To Album Refs\n\nTo Global Refs\n\nRight down to the parish of St. Alphonzo.\n\nWhat, another poem?\n\n\"I want a garden.\n\nI want a garden where the flowers have no flowers.\n\nI want a garden where the trees have no leaves.\n\nI want a garden where the tre-weeds don't even grow.\n\nI want a garden.\n\nI want MY garden.\n\nI want the garden where there are no colors.\n\nI want to water that garden.\n\nI'll garden that with my tears.\n\nWhilst that garden was the trees,\n\nWas the leaves, water me with my own.\"\n\n(Sounds like a bunch of kids to me)\n\nOh, you want kindergarten.\n\n\"Hah-ha...\"\n\n(Denny strikes!)\n\nNot bad, not bad. What's the title of that?\n\n\"Broadmoor.\"\n\nFrom: shill@mojo.europe.dg.com\n\nThe guy who sounds deranged is rambling about a garden \"I want a garden\" (This later shows up on the King Kong medley on YCDTOSA vol 3) and makes reference to \"Broadmoor\". This is an institution for the criminally insane/psychotic - a prison hospital in the UK. To Album Refs\n\nTo Global Refs \"Broadmoor\", alright.\n\nWarren, do you know one called Lefrack City?\n\nFrom: scialli@primenet.com (John V. Scialli)\n\nLefrak City (built by a Mr. Lefrak [sic?]) is in Flushing (Queens) New York (or close by [I'm from Jersey so cut me some cheese]). It was the first and \"model\" comglomeration of apartment buildings, fairly low rent with self-contained and close by amenities, markets and such. kinda now, kinda charley, very uglie. From: lantz@primenet.com (Bill Lantz)\n\nRight and during the 2/18/79 Hammy Odeon show while all the poetry reading was going on during Yellow Snow, a part that didn't make YCDTOSA was Warren reciting his little Lefrak City \"poem\" at Frank's request. Maybe that's where you heard it Tony. To Album Refs\n\nTo Global Refs Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,\n\nthank you, thank you, thank\n\nyou, thank you, THANK!\n\nDenny, Ikey, Tommy, Eddie, Petey, Vinnie, Artie,\n\nSophia Warren on guitar,\n\nI forgot your name on poetry\n\nbut thanks for reciting it anyway, thanks for\n\ncoming to the show, hope you enjoyed it, and, goodnight!\n\nSophia Warren is of course funny cross between names of Warren Cuccurullo and italian actress Sophia Loran Also From: ekbergb@mindspring.com (Brian Ekberg)\n\nDoes the bass play the crazy lick during the instrumental section of \"St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast?\" on YCDTOSA Vol. 1? boilthat@aol.com (Boil That) Arthur plays counterpoint during the first bit, then switches to unison with the melody for the last part. It's astonishing. I seem to recall it was one of his audition pieces - is that correct, Arthur?"
