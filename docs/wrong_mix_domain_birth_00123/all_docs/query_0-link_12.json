        "text": "Zappa, Ahmet 1974- (Ahmet Emuukha Rodan Zappa)\n\nPERSONAL:\n\nBorn May 15, 1974, in Los Angeles, CA; son of Frank Zappa (a musician) and Gail Sloatman (a businesswoman); married Selma Blair (an actress), June, 2004 (divorced, June, 2006); children.\n\nADDRESSES:\n\nHome and office—Los Angeles, CA.\n\nCAREER:\n\nMusician, actor, and writer. Member of band \"Z\"; performed with father, Frank Zappa, and brother, Dweezil Zappa, on recordings Shampoo Horn and Music for Pets, and with Leather Dynamite. Host of television programs, including Based On, But Can They Sing?, webRIOT, and Robotica. Actor in film and television, including Roseanne, Mad TV, Children of the Corn V, Too Pure, Jack Frost, Grown Ups, and Ready to Rumble; voice actor on Powder: Up Here and Gen 13. Executive producer of film Fraggle Rock.\n\nWRITINGS:\n\n(Self-illustrated) The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, Random House (New York, NY), 2006.\n\nADAPTATIONS:\n\nThe Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless was adapted for film by Disney Studios.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nAhmet Zappa's childhood in the home of legendary rocker Frank Zappa was unconventional in many ways, and finding time to watch monster movies was a pastime shared by father and son. For the impressionable young Ahmet, such imaginative viewing made a strong impression. \"As a child, what Ahmet desperately needed was an advice book on how to repel monsters, say, when they emerged from under your bed and announced they were about to eat you,\" reported Sharon Krum in the London Guardian. Drawing on his childhood memories, the musician and actor wrote and illustrated The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, his first novel for young readers. \"I wanted to create a book that would have been very useful to me as a child,\" Zappa told Katherine Rushton of the Bookseller, recalling his own elaborate nighttime rituals to ward off monsters. \"This is me celebrating my life. I'm writing what I know.\"\n\nThe Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless takes readers into the lives of Max and Minerva, the children of a \"monsterminator.\" As they help their father fight monsters, they are guided by an encyclopedia-with-attitude named Ms. Monstranomicon. When their father is captured, Max and Minerva set out to rescue him using a bag of tricks that includes concoctions made of cat hair, coffee grounds, and toilet water. While noting that Zappa incorporates some obvious gags, such as naming a castle \"Doominstinkinfart,\" a Kirkus Reviews contributor concluded that \"the lighthearted gross-out humor, lavishly illustrated with photographs and childlike drawings, will provide plenty of silly entertainment.\" Diana Tixier Herald, writing in Booklist, wrote that \"Lemony Snicket fans who relish the strange and yucky will find Zappa's barf-filled romp … monstrously entertaining.\"\n\nZappa struggled with learning disabilities as a child, and as an author he has made it one of his goals to create a text that is accessible to reluctant readers. To raise the interest level, he includes illustrations that depict monsters of all sorts, as well as brief bites of \"factual\" information about the monster world. In fact, Zappa originally conceived The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless as a series of illustrations rather than a novel; when his publisher told him they would only accept the illustrations if there was a story to go along with them, he pressed onward. The resulting text, according to Rushton, is three times longer than that Zappa was required to write. According to a Publishers Weekly contributor, \"Zappa's lively monster doodles and photo-illustrations of the main characters … add kooky, creepy graphic appeal\" to the novel.\n\nOf his literary goals, Zappa stated on his home page: \"My simplest wish was to be able write a book that everyone would enjoy, but more specifically, I wanted to write a book that would empower children to overcome their fears and inspire those who have suffered similar learning disabilities as mine to realize just how wonderful reading a book can be.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, May 15, 2006, Diana Tixier Herald, review of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, p. 59.\n\nBookseller, June 30, 2006, Katherine Rushton, \"Monstrous Parenting,\" p. 23.\n\nGuardian (London, England), July 29, 2006, Sharon Krum, interview with Zappa.\n\nKirkus Reviews, June 15, 2006, review of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, p. 639.\n\nLibrary Media Connection, October, 2006, Betsy Ruffin, review of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, p. 73.\n\nPeople, February 9, 2004, \"Blair Hitch Project,\" p. 22.\n\nPublishers Weekly, June 26, 2006, review of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, p. 52.\n\nSchool Library Journal, July, 2006, Walter Minkel, review of The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless, p. 116.\n\nTime, April 19, 1993, Sophfronia Scott Gregory, \"Making Brotherly Music,\" p. 73.\n\nONLINE\n\nAhmet Zappa Home Page,http://www.ahmetzappa.com (April 28, 2007).\n\nZappa, Ahmet 1974- (Ahmet Emuukha Rodan Zappa)\n\nPersonal\n\nBorn May 15, 1974, in Los Angeles, CA; son of Frank Zappa (a musician) and Gail Sloatman (a businesswoman); married Selma Blair (an actress), June, 2004 (divorced June, 2006); children.\n\nAddresses\n\nHome and office—Los Angeles, CA.\n\nCareer\n\nMusician, actor, and writer.
