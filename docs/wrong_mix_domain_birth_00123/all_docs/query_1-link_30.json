        "text": "Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American multi-instrumentalist musician, composer, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.\n\nIn animation, he was the voice of the Pope in the 1992 Ren & Stimpy episode \"Powdered Toast Man\" and the mail carrier in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"The Box of Imagination,\" which was his final, posthumous, and, in his opinion, greatest role of all time. He has since been known by fans as one of SpongeBob's \"greatest guest stars ever\" thanks to his reputation in the world of music, having appeared on many top 10 lists with other guests like Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, David Bowie, Junior Brown, David Glen Eisley, and even Rex Harrison.\n\nBiography[]\n\nWikipedia page\n\nRoles[]\n\nIncidental 154 (\"The Box of Imagination\")\n\nTrivia[]"
