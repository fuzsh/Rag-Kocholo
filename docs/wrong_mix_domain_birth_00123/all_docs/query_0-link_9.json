        "text": "“50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants — The Cease and Desist Tour” defiantly comes to Rochester for an 8 p.m. Nov. 2 show at the Historic German House Auditorium, 315 Gregory St. The last time Dweezil Zappa tried to play Rochester, two summers ago, he and his band showed up and found the doors to Water Street Music Hall locked after an argument with the venue over money. So no show. Now Zappa is back, and again money is hanging over this tour, which features music drawn from the vast catalog of Frank Zappa. Dweezil had been touring for years as “Zappa Plays Zappa,” which included the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival show as a headliner in Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre. But when Frank Zappa’s widow died last year, control of the estate and Frank Zappa’s music went to the Zappa Family Trust. It’s run by two other Zappa children, Ahmet and Diva, and in the resulting feud Dweezil has been told that he cannot use the name Zappa Plays Zappa. He also risks paying copyright infringement damages of $150,000 each time he plays a song without proper permission. So Dweezil may need your help: Tickets to the seated show ($30.50 advance, $35 the day of show, with VIP tickets $60 advance) are available at uantix.com and ticketfly.com.\n\nThe American Music Festival wraps up its trilogy of contemporary American classical music with Higdon, Copland & Barber at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 3 and 8 p.m. Nov. 5 in Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre, 60 Gibbs St. The wide-ranging series includes the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra debut of Jennifer Higdon’s Grammy-winning Percussion Concerto with the charismatic Scottish percussionist Colin Currie, for whom the piece was written. This final show also features Aaron Copland’s Symphony No. 3, which includes the iconic “Fanfare for the Common Man.” Tickets (ranging from $22 to $99, with students $10), are available at rpo.org, (585) 454-2100, most Wegmans ticket locations and the box office at 108 East Ave.\n\nGov’t Mule, one of the pillars of today’s blues-based rock scene, plays at 8 p.m. Nov. 5 at The Auditorium Theatre, 885 E. Main St. The band is headed by Warren Haynes, a powerhouse of a singer, a writer and, as a guitarist, the man who saved The Allman Brothers, guiding that legendary and combustible outfit through its final decades. Tickets ($32.50 through $63) are available at ticketmaster.com, (800) 745-3000 and the box office.\n\nStephane Wrembel, the French-born, Brooklyn-based jazz guitarist, returns to Rochester to celebrate the release of his new record, Live in Rochester, 8 p.m. Nov. 4 and Nov. 5, at Lovin’ Cup Bistro & Brews, 300 Park Point Place, Henrietta, near the Rochester Institute of Technology campus. Wrembel has been a frequent performer here, showcasing a modern take on the gypsy guitar style reminiscent of Django Reinhardt. Tickets ($20 advance, $25 the day of the show) are available at lovincup.com.\n\nPegasus Early Music presents “Fantasticus” at 4 p.m. Oct. 30 at the Downtown United Presbyterian Church, 121 N. Fitzhugh St. This string music from the 17th century in the Fantastic Style is by Rosenmüller, Schmelzer, Buxtehude and others, including newly discovered works from manuscripts edited by Julie Andrijeski. The musicians are Andrijeski and Boel Gidholm, violins; Beiliang Zhu, gamba; Leon Schelhase, harpsichord; and Deborah Fox, theorbo.

Geva Artistic Director Mark Cuddy calls Mother (And Me) “touching and brilliant and funny, a one-woman tour-de-force.” Tickets (starting at $35) are available at (585) 232-4382 and gevatheatre.org.\n\nGravitational Waves: Opening a New Window on the Universe explains some of the new discoveries about how the universe works, at 7 p.m. Nov. 2 at the Rochester Museum & Science Center, 657 East Ave. Richard O’Shaughnessy, assistant professor of mathematics and a program faculty member in astrophysical sciences and technology at Rochester Institute of Technology, discusses gravitational waves, which create ripples in the universe’s fabric, and how the new discoveries relate to Einstein’s legacy. Admission is $10, with the doors opening at 5:30 p.m. for a pre-talk exploration of the museum. Register at rmsc.org or (585) 697-1942.\n\nFirst Friday is Nov. 4, and among the offerings in the city-wide tour of galleries is Dinah Cox reading from her short-story collection Remarkable at 6 p.m. in the Richard Margolis Studio on the fourth floor of the Anderson Alley Artists’ Building, 250 N. Goodman St. The reading by the BOA Editions Short Fiction Prize winner also features a question-and-answer session with Cox and a book signing. This event is free.

The show also includes Never the Same River by Harry Stafylakis, a SCMR Composition Competition winner. The 4 p.m. Nov. 6 performance is in the CityView Ballroom at Strathallan, 550 East Ave., with a pre-concert talk at 3:30 p.m. Tickets ($35) are available at the door, with students with an ID admitted free.
