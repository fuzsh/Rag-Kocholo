        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nSenieji Trakai (literally: Old Trakai, Polish: Stare Troki) is a historic Lithuanian village located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) east of Trakai. According to the census of 2001, it has 1501 inhabitants – Lithuanians, Poles and Russians.[1] The Saint Petersburg – Warsaw Railway passes through Senieji Trakai.\n\nThe central part of the village is proclaimed an architectural reserve. The main street is dominated by uniform wooden houses, facing it with two-windowed sides.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSometime before 1321, Grand Duke Gediminas transferred the capital of Lithuania from Kernavė to Trakai (today's Senieji Trakai) and erected his brick castle. In 1337 it became a seat of the newly established Duchy of Trakai. Gediminas' son Kęstutis erected a new castle in New Trakai (today's Trakai). Kęstutis' son Vytautas was born inSenieji Trakai ca. 1350.\n\nThe castle in Senieji Trakai was destroyed by the State of the Teutonic Order in 1391. The ruins of the castle were gifted to Benedictine monks by Vytautas in 1405. It is supposed that the present monastery building dating from the 15th century incorporates the remains of the Gediminas' castle.\n\nThe Trakai name, derived from Lithuanian: trakas - \"the glade\", suggests that the castle was built in a hollow area after deforestation.\n\nReferences[]\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nAbout Senieji Trakai Elderate"
