        "text": "Are you planning or organizing holidays to Lithuania? Or, perhaps, you are set on travelling the Baltics this summer? In this article, we will not only list the best cities and towns in Lithuania to visit but also dedicate a separate paragraph to the incredible Lithuania beaches. From the lively old town of Vilnius and the picturesque castle of Trakai to the spacious golden beaches of the Curonian Split – our travel guide to Lithuania will cover the best this country has to offer.\n\nBear in mind that this article is only the first part of our Baltic travel itinerary. In the following articles, you will learn about the holidays in Latvia and holidays in Estonia. Regardless of whether you are arriving on a Baltic sea cruise or simply setting out on a road trip through Baltic countries, this travel guide will help you plan exceptional Baltic holidays.\n\nFor the sake of your convenience, we have divided each section into several elements: a general description of the city, what are the top things to do in that city and their short descriptions, and what are the best options for day trips from that town. That’s something similar to what we did in our article about Norway’s most charming small towns. This way, you can scroll through this article easily and quickly find the sections that interest you. So, let’s get down to business and discover what are the best places to see on your Baltic countries travel.\n\nBy the way, are you planning a trip to Baltic or Nordic countries? We can organize the trip of your dreams. Contact us and tell us your wishes about how this tailored tour should look like, and then we will do the magic.\n\nVilnius\n\nIt is impossible to enjoy the Lithuania holidays without visiting Vilnius, the country’s capital. Especially considering that its old town – just like the old towns of other Baltic capitals – was inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nOnce you find yourself in this city, perhaps the first thing you should do is explore the lively Old Town of Vilnius. Visit its majestic places — from the presidential palaces to orthodox churches and the National Museum of Lithuania. And, indeed, this district is packed with cozy cafés, small underground bars, and restaurants featuring outside seating areas. If you want to marvel at fabulous vistas of the entire Vilnius Old Town, come to the St John’s Church and take a lift up its bell tower.\n\nThe Republic of Uzupis is another cool neighborhood that you should visit on your Vilnius holiday. Once a poor and even dangerous district, it proclaimed an independent republic on 1 April 1997. Today, Uzupis has its own president, foreign ministry, laws, and an army of 12 people, being home to some of the city’s most impressive art. And if you are looking for the best bars in Vilnius, you must absolutely head to this bohemian neighborhood.\n\nThere are a couple of other attractions that you can’t miss on your Vilnius city break. Climb the Gediminas castle tower, the remaining part of the historic Upper Castle that is portrayed in a huge number of artworks in Lithuania. The KGB Museum in Vilnius narrates the horrors of the Soviet occupation and the experiences of the survivors. On top of that, Vilnius is home to some of the country’s holiest places: The Hill of the Three Crosses, the Vilnius Cathedral, and the Gate of Dawn.\n\nIn case you get bored in the capital, there are a couple of amazing day-trip options, such as Trakai with its island castle and Kaunas, the country’s second-largest city. All in all, Vilnius is a major travel destination in the Baltics that you must not overlook. Even if you have just a weekend to spend, be sure to go on a Vilnius city break and explore this beautiful city!\n\nPopulation: 593,436.\n\nTop things to do in Vilnius\n\nThe Old Town of Vilnius\n\nStroll through the cozy, beautiful streets of the UNESCO-listed Vilnius Old Town, one of the largest old towns on the continent. Explore this historical and cultural center of Lithuania.\n\nGediminas Castle Tower\n\nVisit the remaining part of the Upper Castle, which dates back to the 13th century and is situated on the Gediminas Hill. You can reach the top either by lift or on foot.\n\nVilnius Cathedral\n\nExplore the majestic white shrine that embodies Lithuanian baptism – the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus, or simply the Vilnius Cathedral. This holy building was completed in 1783, but it has been reconstructed and rebuilt several times as a result of regular fires in the city.\n\nKGB Museum\n\nLearn about the horrors of the Soviet occupation at the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Rights. In this sobering place, you get a chance to visit the very jail cells where thousands of Lithuanians were interrogated, tortured, and killed in the period between 1958 and 1987.\n\nVilnius TV Tower\n\nGet a fantastic perspective of the city and the surrounding areas while dining in a nice restaurant that serves European cuisine. This restaurant is situated in the upper part of the TV tower in Vilnius, the tallest building in the country. In fact, the restaurant floor makes a full 360-degree rotation every 55 minutes, so you will surely get to enjoy the city view from every angle.\n\nThe Hill of the Three Crosses\n\nClimb to the top of the Hill of the Three Crosses and get to see this impressive 12-meter-high memorial, which has become a symbol of Lithuania’s national identity. The sculpture is dedicated to the legendary event in which local pagans tied a group of Franciscans to the crosses and pushed them down the hill. By the way, you will also get to enjoy fantastic vistas of the Vilnius old town from this place.\n\nThe Republic of Uzupis\n\nVisit the trendy district and appreciate the art and creativity of dozens of artists, poets, and musicians. Called the heart of Vilnius by locals, this self-declared republic once was a poor and dangerous area, but today, Uzupis boasts of being home to some of the finest art galleries, restaurants, and boutiques. Fun fact: this bohemian commune is proud to have its own president, foreign ministry, constitution, laws, and even an army of 12 people.\n\nThe National Gallery\n\nSee the best examples of contemporary and 20th-century Lithuanian art at Nacionalinė Dailės Galerija, or simply NDG. Located just across the River Neris from the city center, this building that once housed the Museum of Revolution was turned into a fantastic art museum. In addition to the gallery, there is a great bookstore and a restaurant that serves European cuisine and offers picturesque vistas.\n\nGate of Dawn\n\nWitness one of Lithuania’s most important religious and cultural monuments and a major site of Catholic pilgrims in this country. This city wall had been constructed at the beginning of the 16th century, and shortly after that, an unknown artist painted a Madonna over the gates to protect the city. The Soviets had a plan to destroy this gate, but miraculously it never came to fruition.\n\nSt John’s Church\n\nTake a lift to the bell tower of St. John’s Church to get an impressive view of the Vilnius Old Town from 60 meters up. Located in the middle of the Old Town of Vilnius and dominating the Vilnius University ensemble, this religious edifice was constructed at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries and was later reconstructed several times.\n\nDay Trips from Vilnius\n\nTrakai. Located just within a 30-minute ride from the capital, this town once was the center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and is home to the impressive castle on an island on Lake Galvė.\n\nKaunas. The country’s second-largest city is located just 100 kilometers west of Vilnius and makes for a perfect destination for a day trip.\n\nKernavė. Located 35 kilometers northwest of Vilnius, this small town was the first capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Kernavė is an ideal place to go for both history geeks and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nKlaipeda\n\nKlaipeda, the third-largest Lithuanian city that lies on the shore of the Baltic Sea, is a perfect choice for your Baltic holidays. The city’s most prominent attraction is its compact old town, much of which, unfortunately, has not been preserved. Historically, the Klaipeda Old Town had been one of the most beautiful places in Northern Europe, but a large part of it was destroyed during the bombings in World War II.\n\nStart your city break to Klaipeda by wandering around the old town’s lovely, cobbled streets. Then, you can take a ferry from Klaipeda to the Lithuanian Sea Museum nearby, where you can learn about the marine life in the Baltic Sea. On top of that, you can enjoy a live show starring multiple sea animals at the adjacent building.\n\nIndeed, Klaipeda doesn’t shy away from offering amazing museum experiences to travelers. A few of them that you should absolutely see include the Castle Museum (dedicated to the history of Klaipeda from its foundation), the Blacksmith’s Museum (you can guess what it is about), and the History Museum of Lithuania Minor (narrates about this region). Another cultural experience – the Sculpture Park – is located somewhat far from the center and represents a cemetery that the Soviets turned into an “artistic creation.”\n\nAnd considering that the city lies by the sea, do not forget to chill out on the city’s beaches! It may be tough to choose a single Klaipeda beach, but some of the most popular ones include Giruliai and Melnrazhe. But many travelers opt to go on a day trip to the UNESCO-listed Curonian Split or to Palanga to the north. To sum it all up: if you would like to set out on a Baltic nature travel, Klaipeda is not to be missed!\n\nPopulation: 158,420.\n\nTop things to do in Klaipeda\n\nThe Old Town of Klaipeda\n\nExplore the relatively compact old town and see the best of what Klaipeda has to offer. For instance, the local “Art Yard” is a cozy arts and crafts place in this city. You will need no more than a couple of hours to explore the entire Klaipeda Old Town.\n\nThe Sculpture Park\n\nStroll through the park, which appears to be one of the most prominent attractions in the city. Located in northern Klaipeda, the sculpture park stands on the site of a former cemetery that the Soviets turned into an art exhibition in 1977. Today, it is home to 116 sculptures that were put up in the park between 1977 and 1991.\n\nThe Lithuanian Sea Museum\n\nSee the main attraction of this museum – its dolphinarium, where you can enjoy live shows starring Black Sea bottlenose dolphins, Steller sea lions, and Baltic seals. Located at the northernmost tip of the UNESCO-listed Curonian Spit, the Lithuanian Sea Museum houses tanks with kaleidoscopic corals, distinctive fish, and spine-chilling crustaceans. You can easily get here by taking a ferry from central Klaipeda.\n\nThe Castle Museum\n\nLearn about the history of Klaipeda and the ancient castle that once stood in the place of this museum. Even though the castle no longer exists, this museum provides tons of interesting information about the country’s third-largest city.\n\nThe Botanical Garden\n\nFind a retreat from the city’s noise and bustle at the botanical garden of Klaipeda University, with its extensive territory and free admission.\n\nDay Trips from Klaipeda\n\nPalanga. This sea resort lies to the north of Klaipeda and has a regular bus connection with it. Even though most travelers come here to experience nightlife and sunbathing, there are other things to do in Palanga as well. Here, for example, you can visit a huge amber museum inside a majestic 19th-century palace.\n\nŠilutė. Located next to the Nemunas Delta Regional Park, Šilutė is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts and those who would like to try birdwatching, angling, and boat tourism.\n\nThe Curonian Spit. The UNESCO-listed Curonian Spit appears to be a long, thin curved spit that stretches 98 kilometers and separates the Baltic Sea from the Curonian Lagoon. It’s undoubtedly one of the best places for Baltic nature travel, and we have even added two towns situated on the spit (Nida and Juodkrantė) to this list of the best Lithuania cities to visit.\n\nNeringa. Another town in the Curonian Spit, the fishing village of Neringa is the most popular destination for a day trip from Klaipeda.\n\nKaunas\n\nWhen planning holidays to Lithuania, there is no way that you can overlook Kaunas. Located within easy reach from Lithuania’s capital (it takes slightly more than an hour to get here on the Kaunas to Vilnius train), the country’s second-largest city is home to a number of unique attractions.\n\nStart your trip by exploring the historic Kaunas old town, which is itself a popular attraction. Here, you can find one of Lithuania’s most extraordinary edifices – the House of Perkunas, dedicated to the pagan God of Thunder and built in an exceptional version of Gothic style.\n\nThere are other important points of interest that are located in the old town (read more about them below): Kaunas Castle, the town hall, and the yard gallery (also known as Kiemo Galerija). To get an exceptional view of the old town, head to the Aleksotas Observation Deck on the other bank of the Nemunas River.\n\nThe art scene in Kaunas is a bright phenomenon on its own. The works of Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis are exhibited at the museum that bears his name. And the city at times seems to be a playground for myriads of street artists who color it into the varying shades of their palettes. On top of that, two religious complexes complement the marvelous architectural ensemble of Kaunas: Pažaislis Monastery and the Cathedral-Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul.\n\nThe city can also boast of having some of the weirdest museums. The Devil’s Museum is the world’s only museum dedicated to Satan, featuring an impressive collection of devilish exhibits from all over the world. And the KGB Atomic Bunker Museum will take you underground, to the shelter that was built during the Soviet period.\n\nIf you would like to venture outside the city, the country’s capital lies just next door. And there are a couple of other decent options for day trips, such as the mineral springs resort of Birštonas. All in all, no Baltic holidays would be complete without this marvelous city on the itinerary!\n\nPopulation: 304,459.\n\nTop things to do in Kaunas\n\nKaunas Old Town\n\nWalk through the charming historic town of Kaunas and its colorful, cobbled streets that never seem to be silenced. Most of the neighborhood’s buildings were constructed in the 15th and 16th centuries, and that’s where the city center was at that time. Don’t miss a genuine gem of the Kaunas old town – a somewhat spooky Perkunas’ House that was designed in Gothic style (find it at Aleksoto g. 6).\n\nKaunas Town Hall\n\nGet a fantastic view of the city from the bell tower of this historic building that dates back to the 1500s. Situated in the old town, the town hall houses a city museum and a vaulted cellar.\n\nKaunas Castle\n\nWitness the remains of the historic 14th-century Kaunas Castle with your own eyes and explore a collection of archaeological exhibits from that period – from the mosaics all the way to crossbows and arrowheads. Seize this opportunity to visit the castle’s prison, where you can try on the metal chains or strap yourself to the shame pole. Pre-booking is advised.\n\nDevil’s Museum\n\nVisit what some may consider the world’s most extraordinary museum, dedicated to the devil himself. Antanas Žmuidzinavičius, a famous Lithuanian artist, has amassed a collection of over 3,000 devils in different forms – from masks to figures to sculptures. Some may be funny, some may be spooky, but visiting this place is one of the best things to do in Kaunas.\n\nThe Ninth Fort\n\nLearn about the tragic pages of Lithuanian history at the 9th Fort of the Kaunas Fortress. This memorial commemorates over 50,000 Lithuanians and Jews who were killed during the Holocaust, and the detailed on-site museum is the place where you can learn about those dark events of the past.\n\nPažaislis Monastery\n\nAppreciate the beauty of this complex, which appears to be one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in Eastern Europe. The mastermind behind it is Italian architect Giovanni Batista Fredianio. At the complex, the beautiful frescoes by Michael Archangel Palonis and exquisite works of sculptors from Lombardia will surely catch your eye.\n\nCathedral-Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul\n\nMarvel at another stunning Gothic edifice in the Kaunas old town – the 17th-century cathedral with a sumptuous interior. The building is renowned for its red brick exterior, in which two prominent styles – Gothic and Renaissance – overlap.\n\nK. Čiurlionis Museum of Art\n\nMarvel at the artworks of the celebrated Lithuanian painter in this museum. Founded in 1921, this is one of the most outstanding art museums in the country, featuring a wide range of exhibits and offering in-depth knowledge about the history of Lithuanian and world art.\n\nKiemo Galerija\n\nDrop by this small and cozy courtyard gallery, which was originally created by Vytenis Jakas.\n\nKGB Atomic Bunker Museum\n\nSet your foot into a genuine nuclear bunker, located 6 meters below the ground and constructed during the period of Soviet occupation. First opened in 2014, this museum exhibits a vast collection of over 1,200 artifacts from different periods, including surveillance devices formerly used by the KGB and the GRU. Tours and visits by appointment only.\n\nDay Trips from Kaunas\n\nVilnius. If you are based in this city, seize this opportunity, take a train from Kaunas to Vilnius, and explore the Lithuanian capital – it has so much to offer!\n\nRumšiškės Ethnographic Museum. Located just 23 kilometers east of Kaunas, this huge open-air museum shows Lithuania’s life during the pre-industrial times. By the way, it is one of the world’s largest museums and has roughly the same territory as Monaco.\n\nBirštonas. This cozy mineral spring resort lies 42 kilometers south of Kaunas, featuring a former castle hill and a fine restaurant with picturesque views from the top.\n\nŠiauliai\n\nOf course, one may say that the Hill of Crosses in Šiauliai, Lithuania, is the only reason why travelers come to this Lithuanian town. The site, adorned with thousands of crosses of different sorts, is today the country’s most popular pilgrimage site. But, even though the Hill of Crosses is undoubtedly a solid reason to come to Šiauliai, there are other things to do in this Lithuanian city as well.\n\nFirst of all, one thing that every traveler in Šiauliai must do is to set out on a museum-hopping trip. Learn about the city’s history and culture at the local Šiauliai Ausros Museum. But on top of that, there are two other peculiar museums that, in our opinion, one should absolutely visit – the one dedicated to cats and the one dedicated to the art of photography.\n\nWhen in Šiauliai, you should not miss to see some of the finest examples of architecture. One of them is the St. Peter and St. Paul’s Church, a 17th-century cathedral that perfectly combines different architectural styles. Another point of interest is the magnificent Chaimas Frenkelis Villa, which is also home to a museum dedicated to a renowned Jewish artist.\n\nBut one can admit that. yes, the Hill of Crosses remains the main attraction for travelers who come to Šiauliai. If you would like to visit this site of pilgrimage, add this city to the travel list of your Lithuania holidays!\n\nPopulation: 108,000.\n\nTop things to do in Šiauliai\n\nThe Hill of Crosses\n\nPay a visit to one of the country’s most famous attractions – the Hill of Crosses in Šiauliai, Lithuania.

Its origins can be traced back to the 19th century when the first crosses were erected in memory of those who were killed during the Lithuanian Uprising against the Russian Empire.\n\nŠiauliai’s Museums\n\nSet out on museum hopping in Šiauliai! The most important and popular museum in this city is Šiauliai Ausros Museum, which tells about the history of Šiauliai and its region. Here, you can learn about the region’s archaeology, ethnology, and art.\n\nThe Photography Museum, as you can well guess, is dedicated to the art of photography, featuring over 150,000 exhibits and covering all the periods of photography history. If you have fluffy pets at home, don’t go past the Museum of Cats. This institution features a diverse collection of artifacts and artworks related to cats from all over the world. The museum’s highlight is a spectacular collection of cat figurines made of different materials and depicting different breeds.\n\nPeter and St. Paul’s Church\n\nAppreciate the striking beauty of this white 17th-century cathedral, which combines Gothic, Baroque, and Renaissance architectural styles. Pay attention to the intricate details of the building’s façade, especially the statues of saints and the depictions of biblical scenes.

Here, you can watch basketball matches of the local club BC Šiauliai, as well as other sports events and performances.

This perfectly preserved villa houses a fascinating museum dedicated to Chaim Frenkel, a famous Jewish artist.\n\nDay Trips from Šiauliai\n\nPanevėžys. Located within a 2-hour drive, this town of around 85,000 people has a rich history and features a picturesque old town, making it ideal for a day trip.\n\nBiržai Castle. It takes around 1.5 hours to drive to this castle from Šiauliai. Here, you can see the reconstructed version of the 16th-century castle that played a major role in the war against Sweden – unfortunately, it had been almost completely ruined and was reconstructed only in the 1980s.\n\nDruskininkai\n\nIf you are in search of Baltic nature travel, Druskininkai may be one of the best Lithuania towns to include in your itinerary. This Lithuanian town is primarily known for its spa and wellness offerings. So, if you want to improve your physical and mental health, don’t hesitate to add Druskininkai to your travel list!\n\nVisiting the town in summer? Aquapark, with its amazing facilities, offers a great opportunity for both fun and relaxation. Happened to find yourself in Druskininkai in winter? Check out snowboarding and skiing activities at the local snow arena! And on top of that, the stunning Dzūkija National Park lies just within a 30-minute drive from the town.\n\nApart from recreation, there are not many things to do in Druskininkai, and all of them you can do in one day. Appreciate the beauty of local churches and visit the MK Čiurlionis Memorial Museum, dedicated to the renowned Lithuanian painter. After all, you can find solitude and excitement in local parks – that’s up to what you prefer more.\n\nAll in all, Druskininkai is all about mineral resorts, spas, and activities.

The Old Trakai Castle is noticeably less imposing than the previous two fortresses, but appears to be an amazing site from a historic perspective. The number of castles couldn’t have been left unnoticed: if you travel to Lithuania in summer, visit the Trakai Castle Festival, which features cultural events, medieval reenactments, and concerts.\n\nThere are quite a few other interesting places in Trakai, Lithuania, such as the sites of the Karaites and an old Gothic church with an abundance of Baroque elements.

However, the role of the Trakai Peninsula Castle has diminished with the construction of the fortress on Lake Galvé, which has become synonymous with this town.\n\nSenieji Trakai Castle\n\nSet out on an hour-long tour through the Old Trakai Castle, another fortress that has served an important role in the defense of Lithuania’s capital.

Located on the shore of the Baltic Sea, this town is one of the most popular sea resorts in Baltic countries. So, if you are planning to embark on a Baltic Sea cruise or enjoy Baltic holidays on a beach resort, Palanga is one of the best options out there.\n\nOnce you find yourself in this town, head to the stunning Palanga beach that reaches 25 kilometers in length and is best remembered for its beautiful Г-shaped pier. However, keep in mind that this beach gets easily crowded in summer. So, if you want to find a cozy spot for sunbathing, it may take a while.
