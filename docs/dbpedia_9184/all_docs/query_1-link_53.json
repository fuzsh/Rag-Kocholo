        "text": "Actually, it is not really complex.\n\nThe real power in the region, despite the mongol conquest, were in the hands of Slavic (rus) city states and dukes. These dukes actually never gave up the will to unify these lands, but none of them became influential, or powerful enough to do so: if one of them was becoming too strong, either the others united against it, or the Golden Horde intervened to stop a possible unification.\n\nNow, enter the lithuanians, roughly the same time as the Golden Horde is weakening. These lithuanians have an army which can turn the tide of a war, and these russian dukes and cities started using them as mercenaries or allies.\n\nThe situation is very similar to what happened when the Ottomans were used in smaller scale conflicts on the Balkans, and the result is very similar: the lituanians got lots of vassals cities, married into the ruling classes, got some cities of their own.\n\nFor them, it was obviously good, but it was good for the locals too: the lithuanians mostly converted to christianity, marriages were common, and most importantly, protected the region from the Golden horde. Best of all, the lithuanians (being relatively low on numbers) had no possiblity to unite all of Rus.\n\nWin-win. (until lithuanians converted to catholic rites that is...)\n\nGenerally this is what we learned about it, for specifics, I think a russian or baltic forum member has deeper knowledge.\n\nI have to say that the western lands of Rus could successfully fought the Mongol troops some years after the Batu pogrom and before the Lithuanians appeared in Ukrainian lands for the firts time.\n\nThe Galician-Volyn Prince Danylo Galitsky (he also held Kiev before Batu raids of 1240 and 1242 when he gor back from Europe) started to oppose the Mongols of Kuremsa shortly after his visit to the capital of the Horde in 1245.\n\nWhile Kiev, Chernigov and Pereyaslav - three major centers of Rus with their lands were under direct Mongol occupation - the Galicia-Volyn principality tried to maintain relative independence from the Mongols in that time and almost succeeded that. Its ruler only once went to the Horde for the label on the board for his ruling (yarlyk) and then took his own line.\n\nDanila Galitsky sent an embassy to Rome, and Pope Innocent IV had promised him full support in the fight against the Mongols. In those years they planned a large joint crusade against the Mongols with the participation of Poland, the Czechia, Pomerania, Serbia and Galicia-Volyn principality. But the campaign did not take place.\n\nIn 1253 the Pope embassy (Legato) crowned Danila Galitsky in Drogochine as a King of Rus.\n\nDetails of coronation here\n\n??? ?? ?????? ???????? ????????? ????? ??????????? IV? - ???? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????, ??????? ????????? ????? ??????-????????????????? ?????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ????????????\n\nSoon Daniel Galitsky troops defeated the troops of the \"three Tatar Murza.\" Being against the Mongols one-on-one, Daniil Galitsky was forced to meet the enormous Mongol army of Burundai, which came after that in his land. Burunday made Danila to demolish all the fortified walls and towers of the cities of the principality. The cities became vulnerable\n\nA year later (1054) the papa legates crowned the Lithuanian Grand Duke Mindaugas.\n\nDanila Galitsky married his son Shvarn to the daughter of Mindaugas. Later Shvarn will govern Lithuanian principality for 3 years and will be one of its early rulers. And further, Volynian part of the large Galicia-Volyn principality will became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Rus and Jemoit, and Galitshina will go to Poland. In mid-14 centuty the Grand Duchy also will get other lands of Rus with Kiev, Chernigov and Pereyaslav - all its three \"capitals\".\n\nUkraine will make a strong impact on the cultural life of that Grand Duchy, bringing to it many of the traditions of Rus. Suffice it to say that the early official language of the Grand Duchy was based on Volyn dialect. Later in its official language will dominate Belarusian dialects. Many Ukrainian gentry will became gentry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nThe whole history of Ukraine and Lithuania in a single state has almost half a thousand years.\n\nwould the ploytheistic nature of the nation, contrasting to every other nations around that are all christian, have to do with the unity of the nation? The constant tension from other countries, as well as Teutonics, would have formed the nation to be united.\n\nYes, the fact that Lithuania was a pagan land surrounded by Christians (many of them hostile like Teutonic and Livonian Knights) was a big reason for the unification of Lithuania in to a strong state. Prior to the Baltic crusades Lithuania had been split up between various regional lords, but in response to the crusades and the sad fate of the Old Prussian people at the hands of the crusaders, the Lithuanian leaders realised that to survive they must form a unified state. This unification is what allowed them the more centralised rulership and military power to expand into Ruthenia.\n\nPaganism played an important part in medieval Lithuanian politics. For example Grand Duke Gediminas, one of the most influential pagan Lithuanian leaders, often used the promise of conversion to Christianity as a means of trying to get the Pope on his side and get him to try and ease the pressure of the Teutonic Knights against Lithuania. There is no evidence that Gediminas seriously considerd baptism for himself. He remained a staunch pagan throughout his life but allowed religious freedom in his lands, including for Christian monks who came to his court as scribes and emissaries (however he forbid them from preaching in sacred places of Lithuanian religion).\n\nGediminas was a clever diplomat who sent many letters to the Pope claiming that even when he (Gediminas) was saying that he planned to accept baptism the Teutonics were still attacking him, and if they were continuing to attack then why should he accept baptism? He was a smart guy who knew how to use the Pope's desire for spreading Christianity to Lithuania as a way to try and turn the Pope's opinion against the Teutonics.\n\nPaganism remained the state religion of Lithuania until 1387. Even when Mindaugas \"accepted baptism\" and was crowned by the Pope in the 1250s he still practiced pagan beliefs, and after he died his successors continued to be pagan. The significance of pagan religion in Lithuanian politics can be said to have lasted until 1387, after which Catholicism became the state religion when Grand Duke Jogaila was baptised and married into the Polish ruling elite.\n\nAfter Jogaila's baptism, nobility gradually became Christian and politics shifted toward a closer orientation with Poland, while many common folk continued to practice pagan beliefs even after baptism.\n\nA great book in the English language has been published on Lithuania during Gediminas' era if you are interested: [ame=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lithuania-Ascending-Cambridge-Studies-Medieval/dp/1107658764/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454368196&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=Lithuania+Rising+S.C+Rowell\"]Lithuania Ascending (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series): Amazon.co.uk: S.

Not to take anything from the Lithuanians, they were able to fight off Teutons and Tatars; effective warriors. Some sources say they themselves learned from the Tatars and raided Polish lands also. The gathering of these lands I believe was they same idea that later Russia would have, to gather the lands of all the Rus (this in fact became a big reason why Poland came into conflict wars with Russia after they United their country with Lithuania). Lithuanians were very much the ppl at the top however they spoke Ruthenian as an official state language and although Pagan at the time I believe it was more about gathering the lands with ppl of their own stock and gaining an empire. The decision to convert to Christianity was after they had already gathered their lands. It's worth to mention that during the Lithuanian expansion during the rule of Mendaugus, he had already been baptised catholic and although he did not force it upon his subjects to conver and not many were ready for it, in the end with internal strife he was assassinated. After the Mongols/tatars were less of a threat it was a free for all between the rising principality of Muscovy and Lithuania, to a smaller extent Poland, but generally Lithuania and Muscovy.\n\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania, Rus and Jemoit have a big reason to be regarded as the successor of the state Rus - if Russia long ago announced a competition for the title of heir of the Rus.\n\nMost part of the Slavic population of Rus including the population - and the territory - of the Rus itself - its \"mother country\" with capital of Rus - became part of the Grand Duchy, too.\n\nIn this case, the Lithuanians, as it seems to me, played the role of \"Varangians\" in a new state - though they had their own native territory in the Duchy and were more numerous than Varangians in Rus. So the main part of the Slavic population of Rus in the 15th century appeared in the territory of the Grand Duchy and took an active part in its evolution.\n\nLater, the Grand Duchy entered into a union with a Slavic state Poland.\n\nPower vaccuum caused by the fall of Kievan Rus. Not to take anything from the Lithuanians, they were able to fight off Teutons and Tatars; effective warriors. Some sources say they themselves learned from the Tatars and raided Polish lands also.

But you said lithuanian spoke rutherian language. Its not true. Only slavs which were part of grand duchy of lithuania spoke that language, lithuanians had their own language, but we didnt had rightings in our language. Lithuanian spoke in lithuanian language, like we speak it now\n\nOther posters already said most things. I just want to point one more time importance of polytheism in rise of Lithuanian state. Being polytheists Lithuanians were very accepting for all other religions. Since there were many gods in Lithuanian pantheon people usually chose to worship just some of them, so worship of any particular deity was seen as personal choice, not some super grievous decision that might get you burned alive is you choose wrong. Most Lithuanian nobility that went to rule Russian cities adopted Orthodox Christianity, but adopted it only in surface manner as one more God that needs to be worshiped. So, when in Kiev they would be Orthodox and back in Vilnius they would be pagan. This acceptance helped to maintain very diverse empire, people from outside came there fleeing persecution. For example there were several waves of Mongol-Tatars who came to Live in Lithuania when religion in their territory changed and they were unwilling to go with it. Unfortunately, after adoption of Roman Catholicism this thing changed and Grand Duchy started to weaken, because of internal tensions. This opened door for the rise of Moscow. If Lithuania would have really adopted Orthodox believes whole history of Central Europe would be different."
