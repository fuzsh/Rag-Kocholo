        "text": "Location\n\nOkay, where is Lithuania? It’s in Europe, a small country nestled in the North Central part, on the Baltic Sea. See red arrow on map above.\n\nIt’s bordered by Latvia, Belarus, Poland, and Russia. It is part of the European Union and the NATO Alliance, so it’s about as European as you can get. The currency is the Euro, currently about $1.20 = €1.00.\n\nIt is considered one of the Baltic States, along with Latvia and Estonia which lie to the north.\n\nLithuania has a population of 2.8 million people, but there’s more all around the world, so Lithuanians consider themselves as being three million strong. Its tri-color flag (trispalvis) is yellow, green, and red. People often get the yellow wrong, it’s a slightly richer shade.\n\nSo if you go way back, the Baltic sea was populated by the Baltic tribes for thousands of years. There’s a map below showing where many of them dwelled (Is dwelled a word? Hmm, Google says it is, so we’re good).\n\nLithuania‘s language (Lithuanian) can be traced back a long way, having roots with archaic features found in the ancient language of Sanskrit, so it is considered to be one of the oldest languages in the world.\n\nIn the 1230s, the Lithuanian tribal lands were united by Mindaugas and the Kingdom of Lithuania was created on 6 July 1253.\n\nDuring the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, including the lands of present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia, extending from the Baltic to the Black seas. Lithuanians are super proud of this. We used to be h-u-u-g-e!\n\nLithuania was the last European country to convert from Pagan religions to Christianity, but the nation still holds some of those pagan traditions very dear to its historical roots.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights of Germany tried to pretend Lithuania wasn’t Christian, and attempted to conquer it. At the battle of of Grunwald/ Žalgiris / Tannenberg (whatever language you want to use) fought on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, Lithuania led by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great was able to rout a superior force and sent the Teutonic Knights packing, becoming the dominant country in Europe at the time.\n\nBut this only lasted until 1795, when after Napolean‘s failed invasion of Russia (never invade Moscow in Winter, lesson #1), Lithuania was invaded right back by the Russian Empire, annexing most of Lithuania's territory. Lithuania pretty much disappeared from the map and the territory remained occupied by Russia until 1918, suffering repression and attempts by Czarist Russia to stamp out the Lithuanian identity, Catholic religion, and language. Several times Lithuanians rose up in revolt only to be crushed by the Russian Army.\n\nFinally in 1917, during the Bolshevik revolution, Lithuanians saw an opportunity to break away from Czarist Russia, and on February 16th, 1918 they declared their independence. The Bolsheviks who by that time had taken over, at first resisted losing Lithuania, but got their asses handed to them in some quick battles, so they relented and allowed Lithuania to exit their new Soviet Union.. Below is a map of what Lithuania was supposed to look like from the Soviet/Lithuanian peace treaty..\n\nBut then our old pal Poland, also newly freed from Russia, tried to re-establish the old union (hey bro, remember us?) and invaded Lithuania, occupying the capital of Vilnius (Wilno in Polish). So between the two World Wars, Lithuania was a wee bit smaller, and the capital was relocated to Kaunas. See map below.\n\nBut during this time Lithuania experienced a renaissance as its culture was rediscovered, song and dance and the arts flourished. The country began to establish its identity as the country proud of their history but thrilled to be able to practice the Catholic religion and their distinct culture without repression or being told what to do. It was awesome! Freedom tasted great!\n\nIt didn’t last long, only 20 years.\n\nIn 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression treaty, and thus the Soviet Union quickly invaded and annexed Lithuania along with Latvia and Estonia while Germany invaded Poland without consequence.\n\nThe Soviets, in order to prevent resistance from the Lithuanian population, began to gather up all government officials, professors, teachers, prominent merchants, business leaders, and their entire extended families, the so-called intelligentsia, and put them on cattle cars and deported them thousands of miles away to labor camps in Siberia. Often rounded up in the middle of the night with no belongings, many died en-route from exposure to the cold. Those who survived were forced to work and live in harsh conditions. They were not allowed to return to Lithuania until 1954 after Josef Stalin died. This has often been considered the Lithuanian Holocaust.\n\nIn 1941 Nazi Germany broke the treaty and launched a surprise invasion of the Soviet Union, occupying Lithuania along the way, and putting Lithuanians under Nazi rule. Some Lithuanians, having secretly fought the Soviets, now turned their attention to fighting the Germans. But the invasion led to the second Lithuanian Holocaust, as thousands of Lithuanian Jews, Gypsies, LGBT, and mentally ill were gathered up in ghettos in the cities, and then sent by train to concentration and death camps. Others were executed on the spot, or in secret prisons like the infamous Ninth Fort.\n\nThough occupied again, Lithuanians still yearned to be free of Soviet occupation and repression. Really, Lithuanian were just plain sick and tired of being occupied.\n\nThen finally, during the Glasnost period of Russia in the late 1980’s, Lithuania saw an opportunity to rekindle the hope for independence, and as the Polish Solidarity movement began to succeed down south, Lithuania too had their Sąjūdis movement for independence. On March 11th 1990, the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania was signed. So we Lithuanians get to celebrate TWO independence days! How neat is that?\n\nBut not so fast. The Soviets tried to put down this independence.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev called the Act of Independence illegal and the USSR demanded revocation of the Act and began applying sanctions against Lithuania including an economic blockade. In addition, on January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the Parliament building in Vilnius along with the Vilnius TV Tower. Unarmed civilian Lithuanians confronted Soviet soldiers. Fourteen people were killed and seven hundred injured in what became known as the January Events.\n\nA lot of other stuff happened before, during, and after, but that’s for another web page. Hope you weren’t bored. Thanks for reading. Quiz at the bar.\n\nOh, and if you want more, here’s a link to a YouTube video called Lithuanian History Rap (Šventinis bankuchenas - Lietuvos istorijos repas). It’s in Lithuanian, but it comes with English subtitles. It’s pretty cool, highly recommended."
