        "text": "Golf Capital Surrounded by Four Capitals Since ancient times people were attracted by locations where the spirit of glorious past was still alive. The nature and history have both left a vivid stamp in this land surrounded by sun-drenched hills of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija's misty forests. Thousands of years ago, moving glaciers formed the land of this territory in such manner that now it is an ideal place for a golf course. Now there lies the nationally protected geomorphologic reserve of Pipiriškės. In the 3rd century, between the lakes of Zarpuvis and Pasamanė, a village near the Juodakalnis mound was founded. What is most significant is that all four historical capitals of Lithuania - Kernavė, Trakai, Kaunas and Vilnius – were founded in almost equal distances from this spectacular location. While centuries ago all the noblemen of Kernavė and Senieji Trakai used to hunt in these fields and lands, now golf players from Lithuania and all over the world have the chance to enjoy playing golf in the heart of this wonder of nature. The Capitals Golf Club Opening In autumn of 2005 the first nine holes were opened to public and on the 6th of July, 2006 The Capitals Golf Club's main building and the other nine holes were set up. On the 7th of July, 2006 the grand opening of the clubhouse and the golf course of 18 holes took place. This date is considered to be the birthday of the club. The Capitals Golf Club is the first professional 18 hole golf course in Lithuania. Achievements In 2008 an American magazine “Golf Inc” ranked The Capitals Golf Club as the best new international project of 2008 (in the whole world except USA). Our project even outran such “giants” as Punta Espada golf club in Dominican Republic designed by Jack Nicklaus or Peter Dye's project of Mission Hills golf course in China. In 2008 the first professional tournament SAS Masters was organized in The Capitals Golf Club.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.capitals.lt/en/\n\nExternal link for The Capitals Golf Club\n\nIndustry\n\nSpectator Sports\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nPipiriskes village, Elektrenai municipality\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n2005"
