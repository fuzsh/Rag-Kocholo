        "meta_description": "The Trakai National Park was designated in 1992 to embrace the historic city of Trakai on Lake Galve, some 25 kilometers outside Vilnius. The total area of the park is 82 sq. kilometers. The most valuable monuments in the park are the Trakai Island castle, the remnants of the peninsula castle and the ancient site of the Senieji Trakai (Old Trakai) castle with a church and village.  It was to the castle of Senieji Trakai that, according to old chronicles, the capital of Lithuania was transferred in the 14th century by the Grand Duke Gediminas. The castle was one of the largest in Lithuania of those times and served as residence for a number of Lithuanian rulers. Ruined during the wars in the 18th century, the castle is nearing its restoration and houses an impressive History Museum at the present time.",
