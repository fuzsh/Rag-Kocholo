        "text": "View of video of this event.\n\nThe name Vilnius was first mentioned in 1323 in the letter of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas to the North German cities. Seven hundred years ago, Vilnius emerged in history as a civitas regia, the city of the ruler, as well as an open city where representatives of all social groups, from knights and clergy to merchants and craftsmen, were invited, and where strangers were granted legal assurances and promised peaceful coexistence.\n\nAll these years, Vilnius has served as a crossroads where cultures have met and interacted, even in challenging circumstances, a place for important discussions and ideas shaping a regional and European intellectual space.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, then, that Vilnius emerged as a critical intellectual hub, holding symbolic significance in Jewish, Polish, German, Belarussian, Ukrainian, Tatars, and Lithuanian cultures, and known variously as Northern Rome, Northern Prague, and Northern Jerusalem. The city has remained an outpost of European ideas and values while simultaneously mediating between civilizations.\n\nA symbolically and historically significant, and geographically easternmost, Vilnius NATO summit in history was hosted there last year. The city still embodies the values set out in Grand Duke Gediminas' fourteenth-century letters, which remain relevant today: tolerance, multiculturalism, and creativity.\n\nJoin us for this event celebrating the seven-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Vilnius, as Professor Rimvydas Petrauskas of Vilnius University – itself founded more than 400 years ago – shares stories from the city's fascinating history. Also enjoy a reception featuring Lithuanian music and traditional delicacies.\n\nSchedule\n\n5 pm: Reception\n\n6 pm: Program\n\n7 pm: Šakotis cake"
