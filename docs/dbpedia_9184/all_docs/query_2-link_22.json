        "text": "For a little bit too long, one of Vilnius’s main claims to fame has been that it’s one of the cheapest cities in Europe. There’s nothing wrong with affordable travel, of course, but branding Lithuania’s capital as merely inexpensive does a disservice to its many other, more valuable charms.\n\nFirst, a brief geography and history lesson: Lithuania is a small country on the Baltic Sea, northeast of Poland and south of other former Soviet republics like Latvia and Estonia. (Although it shares borders with some current no-go zones, it is peaceful and safe.) Like everywhere, its history is messy: In the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was one of the largest countries in Europe, but after that, it was connected with Poland, annexed by the Russian Empire, occupied by Soviets and Nazis and Soviets again, and finally became the first Soviet republic to break away, establishing independence in 1990.\n\nThe history lesson is relevant because Vilnius is celebrating its 700th birthday this year. In a diplomatic letter dated January 25, 1323, Gediminas, the Grand Duke of Vilnius, announced to his European neighbors that the city would welcome outsiders and newcomers who wanted to do business and build a society.\n\nThe welcoming spirit is very much alive today. Its seen not only in this summer’s full roster of birthday party events, from a day’s worth of concerts in Vingis Park on July 25 (the feast day of St. Christopher, the patron saint of the city), to the Pink Soup Fest (a celebration of cold, creamy beet soup) this weekend. It’s also seen in the way people live within the history of a 700-year-old city but decorate it with modern enthusiasm, the way they embrace innovation and boldness, the way they cook with gusto and explain the origins of every dish to foreign visitors, and the focus on making the city more comfortable for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nThe city is compact and walkable—at least the historic center and posh riverside districts, though maybe not the 20th-century apartment blocks that stood in for the USSR in HBO’s Chernobyl— and easy to get to know in a short time. It’s also quite easy to fall in love with.\n\nLukiškės Prison\n\nAs a rule, prison tours are fairly bleak. But the creative forces behind Lukiškės 2.0, as they call it, are writing some new chapters with happy endings. The prison, which was founded by a Russian tsar 115 years ago, held captives throughout an onslaught of regime changes and was (shockingly) operational into the 21st century. Now a few of the cells can be toured, while the rest have been transformed into artists’ studios (350 so far, with a goal of 500 artists in residence), and the open spaces host concerts, cinema series and artisan markets. It’s also been used as a film set many times, including, most recently and prominently, for Stranger Things. “This used to be a place people wanted to get out of,” said my guide. “Now it’s a place where people want to go.”\n\nStikliai Hotel\n\nIt’s difficult to deny the charms of a quirky grand hotel. One of the more eccentric members of Relais & Châteaux, Stikliai is the passion project of three young entrepreneurs who saw beautiful potential amid the Soviet dereliction of Vilnius’s old town. While some of the rooms and suites are an overload of printed fabrics, the restaurant, bar, games room and flower-filled courtyard are nothing short of delightful.\n\nLokys\n\nFor a small, landlocked eastern European city, Vilnius has an impressive food scene. There are fine-dining restaurants led by award-winning chefs, simple pleasures like the Lithuanian and international menus at places like Grey (also worth it for the restroom art), and a surprisingly competent Spanish joint near Stikliai. But you can find all of that nearly everywhere in Europe. Where Vilnius gets interesting is its most historic places. Set inside a 15th-century merchant house, Lokys is famous for game dishes (boar and venison and…beaver stew!), and the menu notes the century each dish is based on—mostly 13th and 14th. The vegan mushroom dumplings are tasty enough not to feel like a consolation prize.\n\nVilnius Cathedral\n\nIt’s easy to get churched out while visiting European cities, but Vilnius’s churches are varied, plentiful, and beautiful. The standout is the main church, the Cathedral Basilica of St. Stanislaus and St. Ladislaus of Vilnius, which saw coronations in the 15th century and houses more than 40 works of art from the 16th to the 19th century. But going inside isn’t needed; the scale of the thing is what’s most impressive.\n\nMo Museum\n\nThe city’s contemporary art museum is spacious and lofty, as these kinds of places should be. That allows plenty of space for taking in challenging but edifying exhibitions like the current Vilnius Poker, based on Ričardas Gavel’s’s novel of the same name. It’s a fearless examination of the Soviet era and its collapse.\n\nUžupis\n\nThe old town is a living fairy tale, but it’s worth venturing outside. Užupis, the smallest district in Vilnius, was a troublesome place in the early 1990s but is now a beautiful neighborhood of artists, intellectuals and entrepreneurs. (My local host from the tourism board proudly told me she lives there.) In 1997 residents of Užupis decided somewhat sarcastically to declare independence. (It was April Fool’s Day, but the ideals are no joke.) A wall in the neighborhood presents the constitution of the “republic,” including “Everyone has the right to make mistakes,” “Everyone has the right to be of any nationality” and “A dog has the right to be a dog.”\n\nPaupys Market\n\nIn the quiet, leafy district next to Užupis, this modern food hall is strewn with greenery and home to 17 international kitchens with next-gen chefs serving everything from Spanish paella and Italian pizza to the meat dumplings of Sakartvelo, Georgia, and the spicy Peri-Peri chicken (their spelling) of Portugal’s African colonies. Along with the indoor dining areas, the sunny terrace is quite beguiling.\n\nExuberant Doors\n\nFrom tea houses and cake shops to clothing boutiques and toy stars, this city knows how to make an entrance."
