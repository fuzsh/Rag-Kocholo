        "text": "Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas (1316–1341) was one of the most eminent rulers of the early Lithuanian state and a founder of the first ruling dynasty in Lithuania—the Gediminids.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Gediminas' rule was his strategic policy. He not only incorporated the lands of Rus' but also invited people from Central and Western Europe to Lithuania. These bold moves expanded Lithuanian lands and laid the foundation for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania—a European superstate or an 'unproclaimed empire.' The legacy of his reign extended beyond Lithuania, as the Gediminids dynasty, better known as the Jagiellonian, branched out to the thrones of other European states and ruled not only Lithuania but the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia as well.\n\nIn Vilnius, the earliest and, at that time, the only brick castle in Lithuania was built, serving as the rulers' principal residence. It is believed that the famous letters of Grand Duke Gediminas to Pope John XXII, the Hanseatic cities, and Franciscan and Dominican monasteries were written here, most probably in the residential donjon. There are six surviving transcripts of letters written in 1323–1324, and in the first letter written to Pope John XXII, the Grand Duke claimed that the Teutonic Knights did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights, and in the last sentence, he vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope. The Teutonic Knights' violation of a peace treaty is also stressed in a letter to the bishop of Tartu, Erzel, ruler of Tallinn land and Council of Riga.\n\nOther letters were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders, inviting priests and friars to come and live in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the cities in the Holy Roman Empire. Gediminas explains that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant of the Christians but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights, repeating his intentions to baptise in the Catholic rite. He invited knights, merchants, doctors, craftspeople, peasants, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. Gediminas says there are three churches in the duchy – two Franciscan and one Dominican.\n\nThe ruler's city of Vilnius is mentioned in writing for the first time in Grand Duke Gediminas' letter dated January 25, 1323, the first such mention of the eternal capital of Lithuania we know of in written sources. Vilnius' 700th anniversary is, therefore, justifiably celebrated in 2023. To suitably commemorate this anniversary and to memorialise this particular historical fact, the Vilnius Club initiated the creation of a memorial that would stand near the tower of Gediminas' Castle in the Grand Courtyard of the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.\n\nMonument author – sculptor Martynas Gaubas\n\nSponsors – Ina and Darius Zubas\n\nProf. Rimvydas Petrauskas chose texts from Gediminas' letters.\n\nThe monument – a gift from the Vilnius Club for the 700th anniversary of Vilnius – was placed under the protection of the National Museum – Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania."
