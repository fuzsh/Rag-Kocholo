At that time, professional art appeared in Lithuania. The Faculty of Architecture was headed by the classical painter Laurynas Stuoka-Guceviƒçius. Pranas Smugleviƒçius headed the Faculty of Drawing and Painting established in 1797. Thanks to Smugleviƒçius, the Vilnius school of art became the main artistic center of Lithuania and Poland."
