        "text": "Witold Kiejstutowicz, godfather name Aleksander (formerly Catholic Wigand) (Lithuanian Vytautas, Belarusian Вітаўт, German Vitold or Witold, Russian Витовт Witowt; born 1354 or 1355 in Trakai (?) [1] , died 27 October 1430 in Trakai) - Lithuanian prince from the Giedyminowicz family, in the years 1384–1389 the prince of Grodno, Brest, Suraski, Drohiczyn, Wołkowysk, Kamieniec, in the years 1392–1401 Lithuanian governor, from 1401 Grand Duke of Lithuania (Magnus Dux ), son of Kiejstut and priestess of Biruta, cousin of King Władysław II Jagiełło.\n\nSon of Kiejstut and Birutya. Born probably around 1354-55 as amended. October 27, 1430 in Trakai. Beloved son of Kiejstut and Jagiełło Olgierd.\n\nOne of the greatest heroes of the history of Lithuania, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, fought alongside Father Kiejstut for the prince's throne with Jagiełło after the death of Olgierd. The parties made and broke off shifting alliances, fighting and allying with each other and with the Teutonic Knights. Witold was baptized many times and changed religion for political reasons. Throughout his life, he played a tough game with Jagiełło, juggling Lithuanian-Teutonic relations.\n\nHe took part in the battles with Moscow, the Golden Horde and the Teutonic Knights, and in the battles for the domination of Lithuania. His policy, both as Lithuanian governor and Grand Duke, of strengthening Lithuania as an independent and strong state was in conflict with the policy of his cousin, King Władysław Jagiełło, who intended to make Lithuania a \"Polish province\" [2]. In the chronicle of Jan Długosz, the image of Witold is extremely positive and is also called pater patriae of Lithuania by the chronicler [3].\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nEarly years (until 1377)\n\nVytautas was most likely born in Trakai, the son of the brother of the Grand Duke Kiejstut and the priestess of Biruta. The exact date of Witold's birth is unknown. According to J. Nikodem, who quoted T. Wasilewski, Witold was born in 1354 or 1355 [1]. There is also no detailed information about the prince's upbringing. For the first time in history, he appears alongside his father in the army marching to Moscow in 1372. He is also credited with participating in the Battle of Ore Mountains (1370). His first independent campaign took place in 1376, where he reached Tammów, near Insterburg [1].\n\nBetween Kiejstut and Jagiełło (1377–1381)\n\nAfter the death of Grand Duke Olgierd in May 1377 and his son Jagiełło took power in Lithuania, brother Olgierd Kiejstut supported his nephew and supported him in the fight against the Order, which wanted to take advantage of the moment of weakening Lithuania. Vytautas could have been present at the conclusion of the truce in Trakai of September 29, 1379.\n\nIt is known that Witold took part in the hunting in Dawidyszki in May 1380, where Jagiełło met the representatives of the Order - the great commander Rudiger von Elner, the great hospitaller and the commander of Elbląg, Ulryk Fricke. These hunts ended with the signing of a secret treaty on May 31, 1380, which guaranteed the inviolability of Lithuanian lands, with the exception of the lands of Kiejstut. The role of Witold, later presented as Jagiełło's enemy, is surprising here. It is possible that Kiejstutowicz saw the realism of Jagiełło related to accepting Christianity and saw the path of his father, a staunch pagan, as a wrong direction [4].\n\nPower struggle against Jagiello (1381–1392)\n\nThe content of the agreement with Dawidyszki saw the light of day in 1381 and caused anger in Kiejstut. The prince of Trotsky, with Vytautas by his side, took Vilnius, and locked Jagiełło with his mother, Julianna Twerska, in Połock. After the escape of Jagiełło in 1382, the forces of Grand Master Winrych von Kniprode joined forces and lost Troki and Vilnius, respectively. Kiejstut and Witold escaped and tried to negotiate with Jagiełło. Jagiełło's brother, Skirgiełło, who acted as a negotiator, led to their imprisonment. Witold was kept in Vilnius until the dead Kiejstut was found in his castle in Kreva. Witold was transported to Krewo, from which he escaped shortly thereafter [5].\n\nMain article: Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384).\n\nAfter escaping, Witold first went to Mazovia, and then to the monastic state, where, together with the Order, he commanded voyages to the Grand Duchy. He took Trakai and made trips to Vilnius. On October 12, 1383, he was baptized in Tapiewo, where his godfather was the Ragnec commander Wigand von Beldersheim, from whom he took his Christian name [6]. In 1384, behind the backs of monastic dignitaries, Witold and Jagiełło reconciled, where the former returned to Lithuania, burning the Jurbork fortress earlier.\n\nAfter returning to Lithuania, he received Lutsk in Volhynia from the lands of his cousin Fedor, son of Lubart Dmitri, he was baptized again, this time from the Orthodox Church, taking the name of Alexander. In 1385, Jagiełło concluded with the Polish Union in Krewo, and in 1386 he was elected King of Poland. His brother Skirgiełło, who held the Trakai castle in his hands, became his regent in Lithuania. Witold received Brześć, Drohiczyn, Kamieniec Litewski, Wołkowysk, Grodno and Suraż. Kiejstutowicz was never able to come to terms with the loss of Trakai, so he started a rebellion against Skirgielle. On May 10, 1386, as the Lithuanian prince, he paid homage to King Władysław II Jagiello, Queen Jadwiga of Anjou and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland [7].\n\nMain article: Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392).\n\nIn 1390, Witold joined the Teutonic crusade led by Engelbard Rabe. Together with them, he besieged the Poles who were defending Vilnius. Among those killed during this siege were Korytiełło, Narymunt (hanged by the legs and shot at by Witold's men) and Towciwiłł (shot with a crossbow bolt). For winter In 1391, Witold, with the support of the new Teutonic master, Konrad von Wallenrode, set off to the vicinity of Kaunas, where they started building three wooden castles on the Niemen River. One of them, Ritterswerder, was chosen by Witold as his seat.\n\nReconciliation between the feuding cousins ​​took place after Wigunt was poisoned. Secret negotiations conducted by Witold with the Płock elect Henryk led to the withdrawal of Witold from the Teutonic Knights and the burning of Ritterswerder and the other two castles - Neugarten and Metemburg. After returning to Lithuania, Witold and Jagiełło made a pact in Ostrów.\n\nGovernor of Władysław Jagiełło in Lithuania (1392–1401)\n\nIn 1392, under the settlement in Ostrów, in exchange for breaking the treaty with the Teutonic Knights, Witold received Troki and became the governor of Jagiełło in Lithuania, while Skirgiełło became the Grand Duke of Kiev, from whom Włodzimierz Olgierdowicz was removed in 1394. On August 5, 1392, as the Lithuanian prince, he paid homage to King Władysław II Jagiello, Queen Jadwiga of Anjou and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland [7]. Vytautas proceeded to liquidate the district principalities, from which he removed the Giedyminowicz princes, handing over their lands to his loyal subordinates. In the following years he had to oppose, in turn, Świdrygielle, who wanted to win the Vilnius throne with the help of the Teutonic Knights, Jerzy Światosławowicz and Hleb Światosławowicz, the rulers of Smolensk, Oleg Krasny, the Prince of Ryazan and the Tatars. In 1396, Witold captured Świdrygiełła in Vitebsk and sent him away as a prisoner of Jagiello.\n\nIn 1394, the Teutonic Knights, wanting to win over Vytautas and wanting to loosen his ties with Poland, stopped attacking Lithuania and offered Vytautas an alliance. Vytautas, in turn, seeking the support of the Teutonic Knights in his plans for expansion to the east, signed with them in 1398 the Peace on the Salin Island, which was unfavorable for Lithuania, in which he gave the Teutonic Knights to the river Niewiaża. The German chronicler Johann von Poslig wrote that the boyars proclaimed Vytautas their king (eynen Koning) at that time, but this mention raises doubts, because the establishment of a monarchy was not within the competence of the boyars. This may mean that it was about making Vytautas Grand Duke, because so far Vytautas was merely the governor of the Polish king. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the boyars' proclamation did not cause any echoes in sources other than Poslig [8].\n\nHowever, Witold's plans to expand in the east quickly collapsed when he suffered a severe defeat on August 12 or 16 [9] 1399 in the Battle of Vorskla with the Tatars of the Golden Horde led by Temür Kutług. As a result, Lithuania was pushed away from the Black Sea. In January 1400, Witold himself undertook an expedition to Żmudź with the Teutonic Knights, but soon decided to turn his expansion to the west against the Teutonic Knights. However, due to the lack of funds and the fear of the still active Świdrigiełła, he needed an ally, so he began to look again for rapprochement with Poland, which was also willing to compromise. Witold encouraged Żmudź to rise against the Teutonic Knights, and therefore the Teutonic Knights supported Świdrygiełła.\n\nGrand Duke of Lithuania (1401–1430)\n\nGrand Duke Witold (fragment of the painting Battle of Grunwald), Jan Matejko\n\nVytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, pledges allegiance to Władysław Jagiełło and to the Polish crown (1404).\n\nIn 1401 he signed the Vilnius-Radom union, thanks to which he received in Radom in March 1401 from Polish lords for life the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania, subject to the Polish ruler. Jagiełło assumed the title: \"Supreme Duke of Lithuania\" (Supremus Dux Lituaniae).\n\nAfter these events, Świdrygiełło abandoned the Podolia received from Jagiełło and fled to Malbork, where in 1401 he also proclaimed himself Grand Duke, promising the Teutonic Knights to return Samogitia. In the years 1402 and 1403, the Teutonic Knights, wanting to punish their former ally, together with Świdrygiełła and the princes of Riazania, Wiaźma and Smolensk, invaded Vytautas, reaching as far as Vilnius, but were not able to permanently take control of Lithuania, especially since Vytautas with the help of Polish troops The Teutonic Knights were burned down by Daugavpils. The breakup of the Teutonic Knights with Świdrygiełła and the receipt by Polish diplomacy of a bull from the Pope favorable to Witold, meant that Vytautas was able to expand to the east. In 1404 Witold joined the Duchy of Smolensk with the help of Polish troops. Then, in 1406, he attacked the Pskov Duchy, and in the years 1406–1408 he undertook three expeditions against Moscow, culminating in a peace over Ugria. In 1409 he went to Pskov, who agreed to pay him tribute. This secured the eastern part of Lithuania against a joint conflict with Poland against the Teutonic Order. In agreement with Poland, Witold supported the anti-Teutonic uprisings in Żmudź in May 1409. In 1409, he discovered a plot of Švitrigaila, who was staying at his court, and subsequently imprisoned him for several years. In the Great War of 1410, he commanded the Lithuanian-Ruthenian army at Grunwald (he did it directly from the battlefield).\n\nAs a result of the First Peace of Toruń (1411) obtained the return of Samogitia (for the duration of his life). He signed the peace treaty of Toruń in 1411 [10].\n\nIn 1413 he signed the Union of Horodel, which confirmed the institution of a separate Grand Duke in Lithuania, elected with the participation of Polish lords. This union introduced joint Polish-Lithuanian parliaments and conventions, a related administrative division of countries, and approved the admission of Lithuanian boyars to Polish coats of arms. By introducing similar systems, the Union also increased Lithuania's independence from Poland, thanks to which it was accepted by Lithuanian lords.\n\nIn 1419, Vytautas ordered to suppress the pagan rebellion that broke out against Samogitia and beheaded 60 of its leaders [11].\n\nThe case of Witold's unsuccessful coronation\n\nAt the congress in Lutsk at the beginning of 1429, the German and Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxemburg, wanting to break up the Polish-Lithuanian union, proposed the coronation of Witold. He immediately received approval of this proposal by Władysław Jagiełło, who knew that the opposition would expose him to disagreements with the Lithuanians and thus he would check the Poles who wanted to elect the throne after his death, possibly in a way unfavorable to his sons. Witold took a waiting position. The coronation project was supported by Lithuanian gentlemen, while Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Deputy Chancellors Władysław Oporowski and Piotr Szafraniec, opposed it, who claimed that the crown could be decided by the pope, not the emperor. Jagiełło decided that his demonstration was successful and changed his mind regarding the coronation, recognizing that in this situation he would settle the issue of succession to the Polish throne amicably. At the congress in Jedlno in March 1430, King Jagiełło obtained satisfactory decisions regarding the choice of his successor (he was to be one of the two Jagiellons), and as for Witold, it was recognized that he was a lifelong prince of Lithuania, and after his death, the state would return to the Crown as hereditary decrease. Meanwhile, the Lithuanians were preparing for the coronation scheduled for September 29, 1430, to which Witold invited the dukes of Mazovia, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, dukes including Tver and Ryazan, the metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia, Photius, hospodar of Moldavia, etc. The insignia were to be brought by the emperor's envoys, therefore the Poles occupied the western border and roads in New March and on August 1, 1430, took over the emperor's envoy with royal insignia and compromising coronation papers, in which the emperor concluded with Vytautas a perpetual alliance with the Luxembourg and Teutonic states against the Kingdom of Poland. After unmasking the intrigue, the imperial envoys did not dare to go any further and turned back with the insignia back. Opposition to the coronation of Witold was also raised by Pope Marcin V, because he was not asked for permission to create another kingdom. Less than a month later (October 27), Vytautas died in the presence of Jagiełło in Trakai, handing over to him the grand-ducal authority and all the countries granted to him by the king before his death [12].\n\nWives and offspring\n\nThe first wife of Witold was Anna, the daughter of the Duke of Smolensk, Sviatoslav Iwanowicz (RUS) [13] [14] née Rurykowicz. The wedding with Anna took place around 1370 [13], at the latest in 1376 or 1377 [14]. Anna died on July 31, 1418 and was buried in the Vilnius cathedral. The daughter of Witold and Anna was Zofia (born around 1375 [13] or around 1378 [14], died in 1453), the wife of Vasily I, Grand Duke of Moscow. Zofia is the only known child of Prince Witold. From 1382 there is a mention of other children of Witold, unknown by name [13].\n\nWitold's second wife, married a few months after the death of his first wife, was Julianna Holszańska, widow of Prince Ivan Karaczewski, closely related to the deceased Anna - she was the daughter or granddaughter of Agrippina, Anna's sister [13]. Julianna's father was Iwan Holszański [15] or Michał Iwanowic Holszański, son of the same Ivan [13]. Due to the aforementioned close relationship between Julianna and Anna Smoleńska, the bishop of Vilnius, without the papal dispensation, did not marry Witold with Julianna. Jan Kropidło, the bishop of Włocławek, did not have such dilemmas, and on November 13, 1418, Witold married a new, young wife [13]. Witold's marriage with Julianna, who had survived her husband and reportedly died in 1448 [16], remained childless.\n\nAccording to Kronika Bychowiec, Maria Łukomska was to be Witold's first wife, but she is considered a fictional character, not confirmed in other sources [13].\n\nWitold in culture\n\nLiterature\n\nThe figure of Witold appears in the historical novel The Teutonic Knights by Henryk Sienkiewicz, written in 1897–1900 and devoted to the great war with the Teutonic Knights.\n\nMovie\n\nTeutonic Knights - Polish historical film, dir. Aleksander Ford from 1960, based on the novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz of the same title, in which Józef Kostecki played the role of Witold.\n\nJanusz Michałowski plays the role of Witold in the TV series Royal Dreams from 1988.\n\nIhor Aronov plays the role of Prince Witold in the third season of the series The Crown of Kings.\n\nSee also\n\nThe Battle of Vorskla\n\nLithuanian civil war (1381–1384)\n\nLithuanian civil war (1389–1392)\n\nWładysław II Jagiełło\n\nSkirgiełło\n\nPolish-Lithuanian relations\n\nFootnotes\n\nJarosław Nikodem, Witold: Grand Duke of Lithuania: (1354 or 1355 - October 27, 1430), Kraków: Wydawn.
