        "text": "I already said it at the last demonstration against right-wing extremism and fascism, I feel strange, like a ventriloquist – I say that now – who lets his own voice speak like a strange one, but who has always spoken. I've said it, I'm saying it now, how many times will I have to say it? Will I be allowed to? Walter Benjamin [German philosopher and art critic, 1892-1940] in On the Concept of History speaks of a chess automaton, famous in its day, which won every game, but was played by someone else, a camouflaged automaton, so to speak, a little man, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master player and actually controlled the doll that supposedly played and won every game.\n\nThat is what I feel like. I have been sitting under the table for so many years, but I always play the same match because I must play it, I play it, so to speak, under the threat that something terrible might happen if I stop. Of course, I thereby totally overestimate myself. But now this doll emerges from the shadow of a tablecloth and speaks for itself. As me. Yes, talking doll, they'll say disparagingly.\n\nIs there, as Benjamin says, a secret agreement between the former generations and ours? Did this agreement not irrevocably declare that the past must never happen again, never again, not differently and not alike? This \"never again\" we have so often heard, in lip service, in conversations, in lectures, at celebrations, yes, the lips moved eagerly, you could see that. That should never happen again, that is a constant of civilization for us. Nothing that has ever happened is lost to history, says Benjamin, and I would add: Nothing that we want to learn anything from. We have been taught this for decades.\n\nBecome our masters\n\nNobody should have known about this meeting [of members of the far right in November 2023, in a hotel near Potsdam, Brandenburg, the revelation of which sparked a wave of protests in Germany and Austria], this meeting in the hotel where the great heroes appear, and these are not the so-called little people who hope that politics will improve their situation if only they could finally get rid of the annoying asylum seekers and refugees, that is, those who want to take the butter off their bread. But none of them are here to hand over big donations in envelopes, who is here? There are well-financed entrepreneurs, right-wing academics without their organizations, they no longer need them for themselves, they want to bleed others, there are members of the AfD [far-right Alternative for Germany], leading figures who are constantly looking back, greedy for past greatness, in order to get even further ahead, to position themselves for the future."
