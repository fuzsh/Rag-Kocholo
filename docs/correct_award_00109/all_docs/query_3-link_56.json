        "text": "Austrian writer and poet Elfriede Jelinek has won the 2004 Nobel Literature Prize, the Swedish Academy has announced.\n\nShe won the award \"for her musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays, that with extraordinary linguistic zeal reveal the absurdity of society's cliches and their subjugating power,\" the jury said.\n\nMs Jelinek, only the tenth woman to win the Nobel Literature Prize, is the author of The Piano Teacher, which was made into an acclaimed film by Michael Haneke in 2001.\n\nShe will take home the prize sum of 10 million kronor ($A1.9 million).\n\nHer texts defy exact definition. They contain prose, poetry, incantation and hymn, theatrical scenes and filmic sequences.\n\nOne of her basic themes is the inability of women to \"fully come to life in a world where they are painted over with stereotypical images\", the Academy said in its citation.\n\nIn The Piano Teacher, as in a series of other novels, Ms Jelinek presents a pitiless world of violence and submission, hunter and prey, the jury said.\n\nShe will receive the Nobel Prize, which consists of the prize money, a gold medal and a diploma, from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prizes, in 1896.\n\nThe Literature Prize was the fourth of the six coveted awards to be handed out this week.\n\nThe Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, and the final prize, for Economics, will be announced on Monday."
