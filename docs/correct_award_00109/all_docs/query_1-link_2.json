        "text": "Elfriede Jelinek (born October 20, 1946, Mürzzuschlag, Austria) is an Austrian novelist, playwright, and poet noted for her controversial works on gender relations, female sexuality, and popular culture. She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004.\n\nJelinek received her education in Vienna, where the combination of her academic studies with a rigorous program of musical training at the Vienna Conservatory contributed in part to her emotional breakdown at age 17. It was during her recovery that Jelinek turned to writing as a form of self-expression and introspection. After attending the University of Vienna, she made her literary debut with a collection of poems, Lisas Schatten (1967; “Lisa’s Shadow”), and followed with her first published novel, Wir sind Lockvögel Baby! (1970; “We’re Decoys, Baby!”). Using language and the structural interplay of class consciousness as means to explore the social and cultural parameters of dependency and authority, she earned critical recognition for Michael: Ein Jugendbuch für die Infantilgesellschaft (1972; “Michael: A Young Person’s Guide to Infantile Society”).\n\nA polemical feminist, Jelinek often wrote about gender oppression and female sexuality. In the satiric Die Liebhaberinnen (1975; Women as Lovers, 1994), she described the entrapment and victimization of women within a dehumanizing and patriarchal society. Her semiautobiographical novel Die Klavierspielerin (1983; The Piano Teacher, 1988) addressed issues of sexual repression; it was adapted for the screen in 2001. In her writings, Jelinek rejected the conventions of traditional literary technique in favour of linguistic and thematic experimentation."
