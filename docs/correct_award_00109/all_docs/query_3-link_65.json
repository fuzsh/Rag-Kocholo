        "text": "Throughout its history,\n\nthe Swedish Academy has certainly made a number odd choices\n\nfor the coveted honor of the\n\nNobel Prize for literature. One thinks, for example, of\n\nDario Fo, the Italian communist-anarchist playwright who\n\nscooped up the prize in 1997, or José Saramago, a Portuguese\n\ncommunist who got it in 1998. Sure, there have been plenty\n\nof worthy Nobel laureates—Rudyard Kipling, W. B.\n\nYeats, George Bernard Shaw, T. S. Eliot, and Thomas Mann for\n\nstarters. But an equally impressive list could be made of\n\nthose who did not get the prize, beginning with Henry James, Marcel Proust,\n\nRainer Maria Rilke, Franz Kafka, and Wallace Stevens.\n\nIn recent decades, the prize has often been\n\nmore a badge advertising political—that is, politically\n\ncorrect—virtue than a recognition of literary\n\naccomplishment. There have been exceptions—we still\n\nremember the gasp of amazement in 2001 when it was announced that\n\nV. S. Naipaul had won. More and more, though, the Nobel\n\nPrize has gone to a person who has the correct sex,\n\ngeographical address, ethnic origin, and political\n\nprofile—“correct” being determined by the commissars at the\n\nSwedish Academy. So it was no surprise when a distinct\n\nmediocrity like Toni Morrison got the prize in 1993: an\n\nAmerican, yes, which was a drawback, but at least Morrison\n\nwas the right sex, the right color, and spouted the right\n\nopinions.\n\nLaureates like Toni Morrison, Dario Fo, and José Saramago\n\ncheapen the Nobel Prize. But this year’s laureate, the\n\nAustrian novelist and playwright Elfriede Jelinek (born 1946),\n\nmarks a new low. It is likely that you hadn’t heard of\n\nJelinek before—or, if you had, it was probably only because\n\nher sadomasochistic fantasy The Piano Teacher (1983) was\n\nmade into a movie with Isabelle Huppert in 2001.\n\nOther titles by Jelinek have been translated into\n\nEnglish—Lust (1989), for example, an unrelieved carnival\n\nof sexual and physical brutality culminating in a woman’s murder of her\n\nson. Jelinek is\n\na radical left-wing fantasist. She was a member of the\n\nAustrian Communist Party from 1974 to 1991—a period when,\n\nas Stephen Schwartz pointed out in The Weekly Standard,\n\nthe organization “was little more than a KGB network.”"
