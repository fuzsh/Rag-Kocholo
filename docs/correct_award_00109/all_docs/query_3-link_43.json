        "text": "I don't think \"the Nobel Prize\" fits at all well. There are some Nobel Prizes awarded each year, each in a different field of endeavour, so what could the Nobel Prize be referring to? (I thought to all of the ones awared). My preference is for \"a Nobel Prize\" (ie one of the prizes available at the time it was won), but \"Nobel Prizes\" seems a perfectly reasonable alternative.\n\nI thought that The Noble Prize has a collective meaning which implies all the Noble Prizes.\n\nSomething like \"the rose\" generalizes all the roses in the world.\n\nYes, but that does not provide the context in which the words are used, and the ngram for British English is very different from the ngrams for English and for American English.\n\nI would expect the Nobel Prize to be the most common form, since it includes usage such as the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Nobel Prize in Literature. I'd go so far as to suggest that using the ngram as evidence in a discussion in the context of this thread is chasing a red herring.\n\nThe ngram does not differ for British or American English.\n\nIt does, radically:\n\nAmerican English the Nobel prize,a Nobel prize,Nobel prizes\n\nBritish English the Nobel prize,a Nobel prize,Nobel prizes\n\nI suggest that you read through the results in the British National Corpus carefully. There are 80 results in 57 texts for the nobel prize. Approximately half refer to specific prizes (some using for rather than in) and there 6 references to the Nobel Prize Committee. Most of the rest refer to individuals winning a specific prize - eg:\n\n... The award of the Nobel prize to Rigoberta Menchu means ...\n\n... it would be his first composition since the award of the Nobel Prize ...\n\n... contribution to quantum theory, and it won him the Nobel Prize in 1922. (He should have won a Nobel Prize for ...\n\nThat third quotation, using both the and a reinforces my point.\n\nNone of the 80 results uses the phrase the Nobel Prize in the way that is suggested for its use in this thread's context.\n\nI thought that The Noble Prize has a collective meaning which implies all the Noble Prizes.\n\nSomething like \"the rose\" generalizes all the roses in the world.\n\nThe following quotations are examples of the Nobel Prize used as a collective term.\n\n(1) Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to men and women from all corners of the globe for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and for work in peace.\n\n[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/index.html?print=1]\n\n(2) The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 35 women since 1901. One woman, Marie Curie, has been awarded the Nobel Prize two times, in 1903 (the Nobel Prize in Physics) and in 1911 (the Nobel Prize in Chemistry).\n\n[http://scientistsandengineersforcha...ow-many-women-have-won-the-nobel-prize-award]\n\n(3) The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 25 alumni and 21 faculty members.\n\nhttp://graduate.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/campuses/berkeley/index.html\n\nIt is possible to replace the with a in the above, if you want.\n\nEvidence suggesting that the Nobel Prize is used more often comes from\n\n(a) Google ngram: the graph shows a more pronounced curve (somewhat less pronounced for British English) for “won the Nobel Prize” and “awarded the Nobel Prize” (in both cases compared with “a Nobel Prize”. However, we cannot easily inspect the source data.\n\n(b) Google books\n\n(c) The corpuses. Here you can search for “the [or a] Nobel Prize” ending in a full stop, comma etc. or for “won [or awarded] the [or a] Nobel Prize”. Try as I might, I cannot find any results where “a” is more common, although sometimes the differences are not as great as one might think at first sight. One also has to be careful to distinguish between a particular prize (e.g. in Physiology and Medicine) and any prize (as in the thread question).\n\nI therefore conclude that both “the Nobel Prize” and “a Nobel Prize” can be used, depending on whether you are thinking of a specific prize or all the prizes collectively.\n\nShe won a Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIs this sentence correct?\n\nCan't I say the Nobel Prize, because Nobel is a person's name?\n\nWhen do you put a, the, or no article before Nobel Prize?\n\nThis is a correct sentence. It could mean that the person in question won a Nobel Prize in literature in any year in the past (not specified).\n\nHowever, 'the' works in the following sentence thus:\n\n'She won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature'.\n\nIf the year isn't mentioned, we shouldn't use 'the', since there's not just one unique Nobel Prize; it is awarded every year in different subjects.\n\nAlso, using no article isn't grammatically correct."
