        "text": "The Martin E. Segal Theatre Center in New York City presented Elfriede Jelinek’s On the Royal Road: The Burgher King, a world premiere reading translated by Gitta Honegger and directed by Stefan Dzeparoski, livestreamed on the global, commons-based peer produced HowlRound TV network at howlround.tv on Monday 13 March at 6:30 p.m. EDT (New York) / 5:30 p.m. CDT (Chicago) / 3:30 p.m. PDT (Los Angeles).\n\nThe New York reading of On the Royal Road: The Burgher King at the Martin E. Segal Theatre Center is the very first presentation of an abbreviated version of this play prior to its world premiere production at the Hamburg Schauspielhaus in October 2017.\n\n“This unique performance text by 2004 Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek offers a provocative European perspective on Donald Trump’s persona. The main speaker, a blind female seer suggests Miss Piggy channeling a confused Tiresias as she tries to get a handle on the bizarre behavior of the leader elect to draw from it some sort of oracle for the future. This seer with bleeding eyes sends Trump through a shattered looking glass where Jelinek examines him through the distorted mirrors of the heroes of Western culture: From Oedipus to Abraham, Isaac and Jesus, to Martin Heidegger, who attempted to lead the Führer.” – Gitta Honegger\n\nPhoto courtesy of the artist\n\nThe Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek received the 2004 Nobel Prize for Literature and many other prestigious literary and theatre awards. She is best known in the US from Michel Haneke’s film The Piano Teacher based on her novel Die Klavierspielerin. Since the Nobel award she has written only one novel, but many plays addressing urgent issues of our times. Her themes include the politics of memory and guilt (Rechnitz); the 2008 global financial crisis, (Die Kontrakte des Kaufmanns); the rapidly escalating European refugee crisis (Die Schutzbefohlenen); the 2015 Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris (Wut), and now Donald Trump (Auf dem Königsweg). Her latest performance text was preceded by a brief essay, [German title] “The One and Only. His Ownness,” which she wrote one day after the presidential election. Jelinek is one of the most produced living authors/playwrights in the German language world. Her plays are presented by all the major theatre companies often staged by leading innovative directors. These productions have been invited to countless prestigious international festivals and received numerous awards. Her plays have also been produced across Europe, in Japan, India, Australia, and China. In the US the only fully professional staging was the 2013 New York Woman’s Project Theatre’s production of Jackie, directed by Tea Alagic. It was nominated for two Lucille Lortel awards, for outstanding solo show and outstanding sound design.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the artist\n\nGitta Honegger is the authorized translator of Elfriede Jelinek. Recent translations of Jelinek’s performance texts: Rechnitz (The Avenging Angel) and the Merchant’s Contracts. A Comedy of Economics; Charges (The Supplicants) (all Seagull Books/U. of Chicago Press), Fury (Rowohlt Theatre scripts); Shadow. Eurydice Says (Performing Arts Journal), On the Royal Road: The Burgher King (forthcoming, Yale/Theater Magazine); Fury/Rage, an adaptation by the Hamburg Thalia Theatre, that interweaves parts of her text with scenes from Simon Stephens’ Rage, a response to Jelinek’s text. Currently Honegger is completing her translation of Jelinek’s opus magnum, the 666 page novel The Children of the Dead for Yale University Press. She also translated plays by Thomas Bernhard, Elias Canetti, Marie Luise Fleisser and others. Book publications: Thomas Bernhard, The Making of an Austrian, (Yale University Press), which she also translated into German (Propyläen Verlag). Dr. Honegger is Professor of Theatre at Arizona State University. For ten years she was a professor of dramaturgy and dramatic criticism at the Yale School of Drama and resident dramaturg at the Yale Repertory Theatre, where she also directed.\n\nPhoto courtesy of the artist\n\nStage and film director, Stefan Džeparoski, is a Serbian-born, New York-based, renowned international director and creator known for his visually arresting and iconic live productions.
