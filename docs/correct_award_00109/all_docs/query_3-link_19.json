Erika is in her late thirties.\n\nHer mother is old enough to be her grandmother. The baby was born after long and difficult years of marriage.\n\nHer father promptly left, passing the torch to his daughter. Erika entered, her father exited. Eventually, Erika learned how to move swiftly. She had to.\n\nNow she bursts into the apartment like a swarm of autumn leaves, hoping to get to her room without being seen. But her mother looms before her, confronts her.\n\nShe puts Erika against the wall, under interrogation -- inquisitor and executioner in one, unanimously recognized as Mother by the State and by the Family.\n\nShe investigates: Why has Erika come home so late? Erika dismissed her last student three hours ago, after heaping him with scorn. You must think I won't find out where you've been, Erika.\n\nA child should own up to her mother without being asked. But Mother never believes her because Erika tends to lie. Mother is waiting. She starts counting to three.\""
