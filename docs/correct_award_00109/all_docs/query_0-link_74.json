French-Australian author Catherine Rey shares her reflections on the work of Elfriede Jelinek, an Austrian playwright and novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004. Her latest book, ‘On the Royal Road’, brings into focus the phenomenon of right-wing populism. Carefully perched somewhere between tragedy and grotesque, high-pitched and squeamish, Jelinek in this work questions her own position and forms of resistance.‘On the Royal Road’ is published in Australia and New Zealand by Gazebo Books.
