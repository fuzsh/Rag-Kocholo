In my deeply anti-intellectual high school, it was made very clear that we should all aspire to study engineering or medicine because they led to good jobs (the lure of jobs in finance came many years later). They made an occasional exception, in the case of an unusually brilliant student, for studying phys­ics. I had no desire to be an engineer or a doctor and prepping for physics required consorting with our physics teacher, a man who seem to take genuine pleasure in inflicting pain. What else could I do?
