        "text": "Austrian feminist writer Elfriede Jelinek won the Nobel Prize in literature, the Swedish Academy said Thursday, citing her \"musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays.\"\n\nThe decision to award the prize to a woman, and a poet, was the first since 1996, when Wislawa Szymborska of Poland won. Since the prize first was handed out in 1901, only nine women have won it.\n\nJelinek, 57, made her literary debut with the collection \"Lisas Schatten\" in 1967. Her writing took a critical turn after her involvement with the student movements that were prevalent throughout Europe in the 1970s, coming out with her satirical novel \"We Are Decoys, Baby!\"\n\nThat was followed by other works, including \"Wonderful, Wonderful Times\" in 1990 and \"The Piano Teacher\" in 1988, which was made into an acclaimed film in 2001 by director Michael Haneke and starred Isabelle Huppert.\n\nThe novel, and the film, tells the story of a veteran piano teacher, Erika, a harsh and demanding taskmistress who indulges her extreme sexual tastes with hardcore pornography and voyeurism. She becomes sexually involved with a student — but only under her terms and dictates.\n\nShe had a best seller in 1989 with \"Lust,\" which she has described as portraying \"the violence by the man against the woman\" in a conventional marriage.\n\nThe academy noted that Jelinek is controversial in Austria, which she depicted as a realm of death in her phantasmagorical novel \"Die Kinder der Toten.\"\n\nIn 2000, she instructed her publishers to withhold the performance rights of her plays from all Austrian theaters as long as the party of rightist leader Joerg Haider was part of the government.\n\n\"Her writing builds on a lengthy Austrian tradition of linguistically sophisticated social criticism, with precursors such as Johann Nepomuk Nestroy, Karl Kraus, Odon von Horváth, Elias Canetti, Thomas Bernhard and the Wiener Group,\" the academy said in its citation.\n\n\"The nature of Jelinek's texts is often hard to define. They shift between prose and poetry, incantation and hymn, they contain theatrical scenes and filmic sequences.\"\n\nHer recent works are variations on one of her basic feminist themes: the seeming inability of women to find themselves fully and live out their lives in a world where they are glossed over as stereotypes.\n\nThe 18 lifetime members of the 218-year-old Swedish Academy, of whom only four are women, made the annual selection in secrecy last week.\n\nAlfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who endowed the awards, left only vague guidance about the prize, saying in his will that it should go to those who \"shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\" and \"who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\"\n\nFor any writer, there could hardly be any greater honor than winning the Nobel Prize. But for an author whose work is not widely translated, it opens doors to new markets, and sales.\n\nThe prize also brings a financial security net, too: A check of more than $1.3 million.\n\nThe academy has given the award to Europeans nine times in the last 10 years.\n\nSince 1980, only three winners have come from Africa, four from South America, two from the United States and one from Asia. It's been 14 years since someone from the Middle East — Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz — was given the nod.\n\nLast year's award went to South African writer J.M. Coetzee, whose fiction drew on his experiences growing up there. In 2002, the prize went to Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz, whose fiction drew on his experience as a teenager in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nThis year's award announcements began Monday with the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine going to Americans Richard Axel and Linda B. Buck for their work on the sense of smell.\n\nOn Tuesday, Americans David J. Gross, H. David Politzer and Frank Wilczek won the physics prize for their explanation of the force that binds particles inside the atomic nucleus. Their work has helped science get closer to \"a theory for everything,\" the academy said in awarding the prize.\n\nThe chemistry prize was awarded Wednesday to Israelis Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko and American Irwin Rose for their work in discovering a process that lets cells destroy unwanted proteins.\n\nThe Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel will be announced Oct. 11.\n\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize — the only one not awarded in Sweden — will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\n\nThe prizes, which also include a gold medal and a diploma, are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896."
