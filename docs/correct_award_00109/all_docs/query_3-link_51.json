        "text": "Austrian novelist and playwright Elfriede Jelinek is the first since 1996 to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Elfriede Jelinek, whose father is of Czech-Jewish origin, is best-known for her autobiographical 1983 novel 'The Piano Teacher', which was made into a movie in 2001. The Swedish Academy praised \"her musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays that with extraordinary linguistic zeal reveal the absurdity of society's clich√©s and their subjugating power\". But, in Austria, Elfriede Jelinek is a controversial figure, as she was a member of the Communist Party from 1974-1991. The prestigious Nobel Prize is worth 10 million Swedish crowns, or some 1.36 million US dollars. Czech author Milan Kundera had been considered a favourite to win the Nobel Prize this year."
