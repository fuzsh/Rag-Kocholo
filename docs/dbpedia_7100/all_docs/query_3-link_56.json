        "text": "BUSINESS PROCESS AUTOMATION\n\nOne major reason several companies are still small after several years of operation is the fact that they are reluctant to adopt automation. Such organizations still do everything with phone calls, spreadsheets and the likes. This way, they end up making mistakes, operating at a snailâs pace and losing their customers in the end. Often times, organizations tend to measure the success of an automation project in terms of lower cost. However, by automating business processes, and setting the right objectives, organizations can position themselves for rapid growth, as a result of higher sales, new clients and better customer retention. Edge Digital software for Business Process Automation takes into consideration the practice of analyzing, documenting, optimizing and then automating business processes. As a result, any process in an organization that is prone to errors or delays would be addressed by the creation of appropriate apps to increase sales, ROI, and better customer retention. .\n\nOften times, organizations tend to measure the success of an automation project in terms of lower cost. However, by automating business processes, and setting the right objectives, organizations can position themselves for rapid growth, as a result of higher sales, new clients and better customer retention. .\n\nEdge Digital software for Business Process Automation takes into consideration the practice of analyzing, documenting, optimizing and then automating business processes\n\nIntranet\n\nIntranet is the generic term for a collection of private computer networks within an organization. An intranet uses network technologies as a tool to facilitate communication between people or work .\n\nSAP integration\n\nSAP AG is a European multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. .\n\nBespoke Development\n\nCustom software, also known as bespoke software is software that is specially developed for some specific organization or other user. .\n\nAppraisal System\n\nPerformance appraisals are a part of career development. It consists of regular reviews of employee performance within an organization.\n\nCRM\n\nTechnology and Web has changed the way companies approach CRM strategies because advances in technology have also changed consumer buying behavior and offers new ways of engagement. .\n\nBooking Engine\n\nA central reservation system (CRS) is a tool to reach the global distribution system as well as internet distribution systems from one single system. A CRS assists hotel managers in managing things like reservations, etc. .\n\nCLOUD DEVELOPMENT\n\nCloud development is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet. These services are broadly divided into three categories: and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) .Software Applications are created from the ground up so that they can fit for SAAS (Software As A Service) model.\n\nExperts at Edge Digital have in-depth knowledge and experience in Amazon Web Services and Google Application and Microsoft BI Engine.\n\nSaaS\n\nSoftware as a service supplied by ISVs or Application-Service-Providers (ASPs) is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on the cloud.\n\nPaaS\n\nPlatform as a Service, often simply referred to as PaaS, is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. Examples of PaaS include: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Cloud Foundry, Heroku, HP Cloud Application PaaS, Force.com, Engine Yard, Mendix, OpenShift, Google App Engine, AppScale, Windows Azure Cloud Services, OrangeScape and Jelastic\n\n.\n\nIaaS\n\nInfrastructure as a Service is a provision model in which an organization outsources the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers and networking components.\n\nBIG DATA AND DATA WAREHOUSING\n\nBig data sizes are a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set. The target moves due to constant improvement in traditional DBMS technology as well as new databases like NoSQL and their ability to handle larger amounts of data.\n\nBig Data is different from Data Warehousing as Big Data is a technology and a data warehouse is an architecture. The Big Data technology is capable of handling a lot of data. It can handle huge stream of data in the form of unstructured strings and is used to store and manage large amounts of data.\n\nA data warehouse is the place where you build the corporate single version of the truth. A data warehouse contains data that is integrated and is organized that it can be analyzed. A data warehouse contains historical data. Using advanced analytics techniques such as predictive analytics, data mining, statistics, and natural language processing, businesses can study big data to understand the current state of the business and track evolving aspects such as customer behavior.\n\nBig data is actually a super-set of the information and processes that have characterized data warehousing since its inception, with big data focusing on large-scale and often short-term analysis. With the advent of big data, data warehousing itself can return to its roots â the creation of consistency and trust in enterprise information. In truth, there exists a substantial overlap between the two areas; the precepts and methods of both are highly complementary and the two will be mandatory for all forward-looking enterprises.\n\nThe Big data Implementations are normally used either in a Relational Database or Flat Database or a Not Only SQL Database. Relational Database Based Design\n\nEither an open source or proprietary RDBMS can be used as a data store, designed appropriately for big data application or a data warehousing application keeping in mind performance optimization. Additional software tools include an extraction, transportation, transformation, and loading (ETL) solution, an online analytical processing (OLAP) engine, client analysis tools, and other applications that manage the process of gathering data and delivering it to business users. The proper analysis of the enterprise data is called business intelligence. The Big Data requires a dedicated server and cannot share any other application (BI, ETL, OLAP etc) and requires larger processors, main memory which in turn increases the cost.\n\nNo-SQL (Not Only SQL):\n\nA NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that uses looser consistency models than traditional relational databases. This offers simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. NoSQL databases are often highly optimized keyâvalue stores intended for simple retrieval and appending operations, with the goal being significant performance benefits in terms of latency and throughput.\n\nFlat Databases:\n\nPlain text files such as comma separated values (CSV) usually contain one record per line. There are different conventions for depicting data. These databases are suitable for extremely large databases having millions of terabytes of data. Clients do not need to spend huge infrastructure and operational money to maintain these databases. Example: CSV Text File, Hbase, MongoDB, Casendra etc.\n\nThe Edge Digital team of experts has worked on the Microsoft BI platform and Pentaho that offers open source Business Intelligence (BI) products providing data reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, business performance management, benchmarking, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics.\n\nMicrosoft Business Intelligence Solutions\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) is basically transforming raw data into meaningful and useful information for business purposes by analyzing and disseminating information.\n\nOpen source Solutions\n\nWith rich experience and knowledge on open source capabilities, the Edge Digital team is able to deliver real solutions throughout the entire development cycle.\n\nSINGLE PAGE WEB APPS\n\nA single-page application (SPA), also known as single-page interface (SPI), is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience similar to a desktop application.\n\nIn SPA, either all necessary code â HTML, JavaScript, and CSS â is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in HTML5) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical. Instead, content, functional buttons, and actions are implemented as Javascript actions that call as backend API and update both the rendered content and backup server state as the user engages with the application.\n\nPORTAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nA web portal is most often. a specially-designed Web page at a website which brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way. Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information; often, the user can configure which ones to display. Variants of portals include Mashup (web application hybrid) and intranet \"dashboards\" for executives and managers. The extent to which content is displayed may be more or less depending on the intended user and the intended purpose as well as the diversity of the content.\n\nExamples of early public web portals were AOL, Excite, Netvibes, iGoogle, MSN, Naver, Indiatimes, Rediff, Sify and Yahoo!\n\nTypes of web portals include::\n\nPersonal portals\n\nNews portals\n\nGovernment web portals\n\nCultural portals\n\nCorporate web portals\n\nStock portals\n\nSearch portals\n\nTender's portals\n\nHosted web portals\n\nExperts at Edge Digital offer full cycle portal development services, starting with an in-depth analysis of user requirements and what theyâre trying to accomplish. Then, these user needs are translated into requirements for collaboration, business process, personalization, search, content management, and data display.\n\nTECHNOLOGIES\n\nPHP\n\nZend Framework\n\nMoodle\n\nWordPress\n\nHTML5\n\nYii Framework\n\nNET\n\nDrupal\n\nJoomla\n\nÂ"
