And I have been wishing for a technology that could read my wandering mind & act on a jesture command to record the stuff without me having to do more than ‚Äúthe thinking‚Äù. üòâ\n\nSince that technology seems too far away to waste my life waiting for it, I‚Äôve finally mustered some discipline to take the first step, i.e. to blog. My laptop and my cellphone are my companions, hopefully I will be able to do with my machines what I couldn‚Äôt with the good ol‚Äô diary.\n\nHere you can find thoughts from all over my mind, so all you ingenious people can make some use of it! But here‚Äôs a warning, I don‚Äôt strictly follow any particular doctrine and I may change my mind about some things as I learn more ‚Äì which I‚Äôm sure I will üôÇ\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious to know more about me and my profession, here is my LinkedIn profile.\n\nI‚Äôve also been splitting time with blogging on the Official OrangeScape Blog, check it out as well!\n\nThere‚Äôs some other content in Slide/Video format too, available at OrangeScape‚Äôs Channel on Slideshare.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe views expressed in this article/presentation are that of mine and my employer does not subscribe to the substance, veracity or truthfulness of the said opinion ‚Äì unless otherwise specified on a particular content.\n\nAnd I will provide the appropriate copyright details on the source of the content if I reference any external sources.
