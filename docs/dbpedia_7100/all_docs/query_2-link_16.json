Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.\n\nMatrix builds\n\nSave time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.\n\nAny language\n\nGitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.\n\nLive logs\n\nSee your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.\n\nBuilt-in secret store\n\nAutomate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository."
