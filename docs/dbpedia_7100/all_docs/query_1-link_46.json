Though i achieved it for my desktop in home, Every time i get a plan to switch to linux, the Engg dept comes up with a new version which makes me to wait some more.\n\nBut with WINE i had been able to make the things to work in linux. But as it happens, many a time the application fail to work even with wine. Now after close to 4 to 5 months of trying to make the new Orangescape studio work on linux, atlast it works. Even though it is a webapp still we need wine.\n\nThe latest Update of Kernel to 2.6.31-20 + a higher internet connection speed made it possible. I had installed WINE 1.1.31 long back. I had installed Silverlight 3 + Firefox 3.5.6 (windows version) on WINE. It had not been working till last weekend, when i last updated the system. (Kernel version 2.6.31-20). Plus the new changes which the Engg made over the last week. Now it is working. I did some basic validations and a straight workflow. It worked well. But i could notice the CPU usage shooting up when doing Workflow design. But nothing so great to make the system unstable or crash to firefox as how it was happening before.\n\nStudio\n\nProcess Designer\n\nThe Browser\n\nThe Operating System\n\nBut it is not working with moonlight. Seems moonlight has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nThe Machine:\n\nIntel Core 2 Duo T5800 @ 2 Ghz\n\n2GB RAM\n\nUbuntu 9.10 (karmic koala)\n\nUpdate:\n\nIt works with Firefox 3.6, and seems like with Fx3.6 the working is more smother than with Fx3.5.x. The CPU doesn’t go above 60% when loading or using Process Designer, which was not the case with the previous versions. It would hit 95% in both CPU’s of my laptop in Fx3.5.x. May be i should be using it a bit more regularly and try out different things before going all out on the decision of deleting Windoze out. Still have a few doubts where it might stumble or even crash. Need to check those out."
