But Orangescape always makes sure that they go the extra mile where their employees are concerned, helping them grow in their personal lives as well as their career, even if they were to move out of the company.\n\nThis particular initiative by the organization is undoubtedly the best from my perspective because it has made me better understand who I am, learn what it means to manage people, I would rather say about understanding people, learning new things which I have never known before and so much more. This initiative is for the people who are at various levels, from team leads to senior managers.\n\nThis initiative is none other than the OLP ( Orangescape Leadership Program). It’s been almost a year this has been started with around 35 people in the current batch. The program happens once a month and to make this even more interesting the venue is out of the office and changes every month. The sessions are facilitated by highly experienced people from within the company with a mix of some external speakers who are experts in the subject they address.\n\nMy learning in this journey started with this famous quote “Leadership is not a position or title, it is an action and an example you set”. For me, this is best exemplified by the CEO Suresh himself, and I will always be thankful for this chance at a learning opportunity that will last for a lifetime.\n\nHere are some of the topics we covered in our journey of becoming better leaders:\n\nEmotional Intelligence\n\nFrame of Reference\n\nTeam Synergy\n\nBuilding trust with the team\n\nPersonal Mastery\n\nBeing proactive ( CoC/ CoI)\n\nBuilding positive relationships — Respect/Strokes\n\nExtreme Ownership and Human Centered Relationship\n\nThriving interdependence — Seeking WIN WIN\n\nLeadership Processes: Job-Link-System Responsibilities\n\nOut of all these what I loved the most were the sessions on Emotional intelligence, Frame of Reference and Being Proactive. I had a chance to experience these in my life, both personally and at work. If you are someone who is seeking opportunities to fulfill your passion in an organization which has its own unique qualities then definitely this would be the best place for you.\n\nI am proud to write about this organization to help people know about one of the best startups in the city which focuses not only on the work but also on the other areas which are critical to the long term success of the individual. This responsibility taken by the organization is something which is missing in most other companies and makes Orangescape unique and one of the best places to build one’s career."
