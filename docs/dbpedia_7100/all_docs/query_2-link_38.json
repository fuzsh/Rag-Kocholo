These classes are static definitions of how the model would behave in run-time. To see the actual working of these classes the developer compiles the classes to generate machine code and execute the classes. The classes can be tested only after the process of compilation (to intermediate code or target code) and execution. Developers go through this process of defining/modifying the classes, compiling and testing in an iteration to achieve the desired final output as described in the document. This existing approach demands a qualified software developer to translate a need into a working software program.\n\nexpert systems provide involving computer programs that could carry out reasoning tasks by applying the encoded knowledge inputs as ârulesâ or âframesâ to facts concerning a problem provided by the end user.\n\nthe existing spreadsheet does not have a way to nest the sheets. Lack of nesting is a serious limitation in using the spreadsheets as a way to define data models.\n\nSpreadsheets described in the prior art also lack clear definition and support for âMeta Dataâ i.e. data to describe data. Without âMeta Dataâ interpretation of data becomes subjective and not explicit. Hence existing spreadsheets become unusable for defining business applications.\n\nany application is expected to go through multiple versions. With every new version comes along the problem of migrating the old model's data to the new model. This under the existing spreadsheet applications is often done as an offline data migration issue, which requires system downtime. Importantly, there is need for a method and system for maintaining historical changes done to a model against its previous version including such as the change of names, relationships and data types. Moreover, need is felt in the art for facilities for automatic migration utility (Change History) to migrate data from an earlier version of the model to the new version of the model.\n\nChange History Automatic migration utility\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to avoid the limitation of possible nesting of sheets in conventional spreadsheets, which in turn causes serious limitations in using the spreadsheets as a way to define hierarchical data models.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is directed to provide clear definition and support for âMeta Dataâ in spreadsheets (without user intervention, i.e. implicitly ascertain data type) whereby interpretation of data in spreadsheets would not only be subjective and favor use of spreadsheets for defining business application.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to enable multiple instances of the same virtual template to co-exist very similar to a class that has multiple instances in OOP, to enable âWorking with Data instead of Meta-Dataâ, during application development.\n\nAnother object of the present invention is to avoid manual synchronization involving âCopy and Pasteâ option between one or more sheets of the spreadsheet requiring like changes such as formula modification or contact value changes. Avoiding the need to explicitly remember the changes in multiple instances of the template and provide means for automatically synchronizing meaningful cells across different spreadsheet instances of the same template\n\nYet another object of the present invention is to provide a fully automated migration of data from an old model/version to a new model/version without involving or requiring offline data migration issue and user intervention, which requires system down time.\n\nYet further object of the present invention is directed to development of a method and system for efficient use of spreadsheet application involving defining a hierarchical data model and related computation and instruction rules using spreadsheet interface, which would favor more effective and user-friendly business application of spreadsheets.\n\nYet further object of the present invention is directed to incorporate and define â3-Dâ formula in spreadsheet like interface application that would automatically compute results based on the hierarchical context.\n\nYet another object of the present invention is to provide for analysis of inter-dependences and relationship between sheets and automatically computing the context sensitive 3-D formula to facilitate user-friendly business application of spreadsheet.\n\nYet another object of the present invention is directed to a method and system of defining a hierarchical data model and related computation and instruction, which would have the capability to automatically map (without user intervention) the underline structure of the virtual template to a database table.\n\nYet another object of the present invention is directed to a method and system of translating the relationships between the templates in the hierarchical data model to relational table relationships like Primary Key, Foreign Key constraints automatically without any user intervention.\n\nYet further object of the present invention is directed to a method and system called âChange Historyâ adapted to maintain the changes done to a model against its previous version in spreadsheet like applications thereby favoring hot deployment of new models/versions without system down time and without invalidating old data created using old models/version.\n\nYet further object of the present invention is provide method and system of spreadsheet like user interface, which would enable support complex data types, which are created using two or more simple data types in a spreadsheet model.\n\nYet another object of the present invention is directed to a method and system for spreadsheet user interface wherein computation and function can be applied at complex data types, which are also used to store large amounts of look up information, which vary at runtime.\n\nthe method of defining a hierarchical data model and related computation using spreadsheet like interface comprising:\n\nSuch method enables defining â3D formulaâ that will automatically compute based on the hierarchical context.\n\nSuch â3D formulaâ comprising analyzing the interdependencies and the relationships between sheets and automatically computing the Context Sensitive â3D Formulaâ.\n\nthe method provides for Dynamic Templates to recognize sheets of similar type and automatically synchronizes computation logic and constants across the sheets without any manual intervention.\n\nthe above dynamic template comprises effective functioning by associating a type with each sheet such that sheets that belong to the same type are grouped together and a change in any one of the sheets in the group is recognized, analyzed and objectively synchronized to other sheets in the group. Public cell data are not synchronized.\n\ntemplates are virtual build instead of explicitly defined templates inside its memory in a data structure by incrementally capturing unique user changes in a sheet.\n\nthe method of the invention comprises automatically mapping without user intervention the underlying structure of the virtual template to a database table.\n\nSuch automatic mapping is achieved by automatically mapping the virtual template name to table name and the public cells are mapped to the field name, the private cells continue to be internal in the engine achieving seamless restoration.\n\nYet another aspect of the invention provides a method for maintaining âChange Historyâ which maintains the changes done to a model against its previous version.\n\nthe âChange Historyâ records every change including the change of names, relationships and data types.\n\nthe method of the invention it is possible following the method of the invention to allow functionally different models to reuse part of its functionality via an âimportâ capability wherein sheets from one model can be imported into another model and can be linked to one of its sheets which allows for the data model of the imported sheet to be reused in the linked mode.\n\nthe imported sheet's virtual template maintains the integrity by managing the relationship with the sheets in the original model as well as the imported model.\n\nthe method of the invention thus enables supporting complex data-types, which are created using two or more simple data types in a spreadsheet model.\n\ncomputation and functions can be applied at complex data types, which is also used to store large amounts of lookup information that vary dynamically at runtime.\n\nthe above invention is directed to take care of the required method and a system incorporating such method of defining hierarchical data model and related computation and instruction rules using spreadsheet like interface.\n\nthe method of the invention enable nesting of various sheets in a spreadsheet through the new system wherein nesting is achieved by supporting a relationship between sheets, which was not possible involving the conventionally available spreadsheet interface. Such relationship between sheets can be effectively and advantageously maintained in an internal data structure.\n\nthe invention provides and supports multiple relationship types among the spreadsheets, which favour achieving the possible nesting of various sheets in spreadsheet accordance with the invention.\n\na multiple relationship of sheets in the system and method of the invention if âAâ, âBâ & âCâ are sheets in a model and if sheet âCâ is accessible from sheet âAâ and by âBâ then according to the system the sheet âCâ is in a shared relationship.\n\nmodification made to âCâ via anyone of the access point i.e. either âAâ or âBâ would be visible to the other because of the shared relationship.\n\nâAâ & âBâ are two sheets and sheet âBâ is defined under sheet âAâ with exclusive relationship and then it is not accessible elsewhere in the model.\n\nSuch possible provision of shared and exclusive relationship among the spreadsheets provide for the desired flexibility without sacrificing the integrity of the data model by permitting the modeler to arrange relevant data to be closely located in stead of having to access it using a full path to a deeply nested sheet.\n\nGUI graphical user interface\n\nthe invention provides for the desired system for defining a hierarchical data model and related computation using spreadsheet like interface comprising:\n\nsystem of the invention is adapted to identify and classify (I) said Public cells comprising:\n\nthe same advantageously utilizes a selective identification and classification of cells to impart desired flexibility and versatility to the spreadsheet.\n\nthe cells are classified as public and private cells to enable and/or prohibit the user interaction with the respective cells and in a way provide for a new method and system for accessing the cells of spreadsheets in a more appropriate and selective manner to facilitate variety of business application and user requirements and utilities.\n\nsystem of the invention by way of the afore-discussed inter-dependency and relationship between sheets provided there under define 3-D formula adapted to automatically compute based on the hierarchical contact.\n\nthe above system thus, maintains the relationship between the sheets in its meta-data structure and utilizing such meta-data structure it also facilitates creating database table relationship.\n\nthe system is further adapted to maintain âCHANGE HISTORYâ, which is the record of the changes done to a model against its previous version. Such change history further records every change including the change of names, relationships and data types.\n\nthe system is also adapted for automatic migration utility (change history) to migrate data from an earlier version of a model to the new version the model.\n\nthe new system allows functionally different models to reuse part of its functionality via an import capability wherein sheets from one model can be imported into another model and can be linked to one of its sheets, which allows for the data model for the imported sheet to be reused to the linked model.\n\nthe imported sheet virtual template maintains the integrity by managing the relationship with the sheets in the original model as well as the imported model.\n\na server application comprising:\n\na computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions for performing nesting of various sheets in a spreadsheet by supporting a relationship between sheets in an internal data structure format wherein the relationships between sheets are maintained in an internal data structure adapted to hold information about every sheet and its relationship with other sheets.\n\nSuch a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions is obtained for providing and supporting defining a hierarchical data model and related computation using spreadsheet like interface for carrying out the above method of this invention.\n\na general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer, including a processing unit, a system memory, and a bus means that couples various system components including the system memory to processing unit can be used to practice the invention.\n\nthe invention as above can be also practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network.\n\nprogram modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.\n\nFIG. 1 Illustrates the context sensitive 3-D formula provided in the system of the invention\n\nFIG. 2 depicts the provision of dynamic and virtual templates in accordance with the system of the invention\n\nFIG. 3 Illustrates the provision of hierarchical sheets in the system of the invention\n\nFIGS. 4 & 5 Illustrate the manner of meta-data definition used by the present system.\n\nFIG. 1 represents the context sensitive 3-D formula defined under the method and system of the present system.\n\nthe present invention provides the ability to define 3-D formula that automatically computes based on the hierarchical context.\n\nthe following is an illustration of such automatic computation based on hierarchical context provided by the system of the invention.\n\nthe present invention provides the ability to define â3D formulaâ that automatically computes based on the hierarchical context.\n\nâAâ, âBâ and âCâ are 3 sheets are under sheet âMâ and âDâ, âEâ and âFâ are 3 other sheets under sheet âNâ. Both sheet âMâ and âNâ belong to the same type say âT 1 â. Sheets A to F belong to the type âT 2 â.\n\nit is possible to write a 3D-Formula like M â T 1 sum (A â P 1 to C â P 1 ).\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates the dynamic and virtual template in accordance with the invention.\n\nExisting spreadsheets are known to have support for static templates.\n\nstatic templates By virtue of such static templates in existing spreadsheet it is possible to apply the same template to one or more sheets say sheet âAâ and âBâ in a spreadsheet.\n\nthe changes like a formula modification done in sheet A is not automatically synchronized to sheet B and vis-Ã -vis.\n\nthe user has to manually make the synchronization by copy and paste option. Such a manual option is obviously error prone, inefficient and quite frustrating.\n\nthe system of the present invention is adapted to avoid such limitation of static templates by provision of dynamic templates.\n\nDynamic template is adapted to recognize templates of similar type and automatically synchronized computation logic across the sheet without any manual intervention. This is possible by associating a type with each sheet. Sheets that belong to the same type are grouped together and a change in any one of the sheets in the group is recognized and synchronized to other sheets in the group.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates hierarchical sheets in accordance with the invention.\n\nPresently available spreadsheet software does not support the desired nesting of sheets. Lack of nesting is a serious limitation in using spreadsheet as a way to define data model. Typically, any application would require a data model that is hierarchical and the present invention provide the nesting of sheets utilizing such hierarchical data model.\n\nthe nesting is achieved by supporting a relation between sheets, which is developed by way of the invention and maintain in an internal data structure.\n\nthe data structure supports information about every sheet and its relationship with other sheets.\n\nthe present invention supports multiple relationship types when relating two sheets as further explained hereunder:\n\nFIGS. 4 & 5 illustrate meta-data definition. It is known that the existing spreadsheets work with data and lack a clear definition and support for meta-data that is data to describe the data. Thus without such meta-data interpretation, the data becomes subjective and not explicit. Therefore, existing spreadsheets become unusable for defining business application.\n\nthe present invention therefore further overcomes this limitations by providing both graphical user interface (GUI) and engine level capabilities to support âMeta Dataâ in a non-intrusive fashion.\n\nGUI graphical user interface\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nTheoretical Computer Science (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nBusiness, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nMarketing (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nComputational Linguistics (AREA)\n\nAudiology, Speech & Language Pathology (AREA)\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AREA)\n\nEconomics (AREA)\n\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation (AREA)\n\nHuman Resources & Organizations (AREA)\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nOperations Research (AREA)\n\nQuality & Reliability (AREA)\n\nStrategic Management (AREA)\n\nTourism & Hospitality (AREA)\n\nGeneral Business, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nInformation Retrieval, Db Structures And Fs Structures Therefor (AREA)\n\nManagement, Administration, Business Operations System, And Electronic Commerce (AREA)\n\nUS11/885,896 2005-03-11 2006-03-10 System and method of defining a hierarchical datamodel and related computation and instruction rules using spreadsheet like user interface Expired - Fee Related US8055995B2 (en)\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (3)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title IN244/CHE/2005 2005-03-11 IN244CH2005 2005-03-11 PCT/IN2006/000085 WO2006095365A2 (fr) 2005-03-11 2006-03-10 Systeme et procede de definition d'un modele de donnees hierarchique et regles de calcul et d'instructions apparentees utilisant une interface utilisateur de type tableur\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date US20080256432A1 US20080256432A1 (en) 2008-10-16 US8055995B2 true US8055995B2 (en) 2011-11-08\n\nFamily\n\nID=36953758\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US11/885,896 Expired - Fee Related US8055995B2 (en) 2005-03-11 2006-03-10 System and method of defining a hierarchical datamodel and related computation and instruction rules using spreadsheet like user interface\n\nCountry Status (4)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US8055995B2 (fr) EP (1) EP1859375A4 (fr) CA (1) CA2614059C (fr) WO (1) WO2006095365A2 (fr)\n\nCited By (6)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20090122772A1 (en) * 2007-11-08 2009-05-14 Samsung Electronics Co.
