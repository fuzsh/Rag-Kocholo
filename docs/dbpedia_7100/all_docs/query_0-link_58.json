They are printed in Montreal’s Mile Ex district on FSC-certified premium 216 GSM smooth acid-free paper, sourced from an SFI® mill in Canada.\n\n· Advanced digital printing technology that gives vibrant colours.\n\n· Colour may differ slightly from screen to print.\n\nWe strive to represent our prints as accurately as possible. However, it's important to understand that due to variations in computer screen settings and lighting, the colors of the actual print may differ slightly from what you see on your screen. Each screen displays colors differently, so the hues in your print might not exactly match what you viewed online. We ensure the quality and vibrancy of every print, but a slight variation in color is a natural aspect of the printing process.\n\nOur prints are meticulously rolled and securely placed inside a sturdy cardboard cylinder to ensure their protection during transit.\n\nUpon receiving your print, we recommend carefully removing it from the cylinder and then gently starting at the perforated line on the sticker. This line is designed to allow the sticker to split cleanly into two halves, making it easier to unwrap the print without damaging it.\n\n• Keep it Flat: Store your print flat, ideally in a protective sleeve or between two pieces of acid-free paper to prevent any creasing or damage. Avoid rolling the print, as this can lead to curled edges and wrinkles.\n\n• Avoid Direct Sunlight: Store the print in a dark place away from direct sunlight. UV rays can fade the colors over time, even if the print is not on display.\n\n• Control the Temperature and Humidity: Keep the print in a cool, dry environment. High humidity can lead to mold or mildew, and extreme temperatures can cause the paper to expand or contract, potentially damaging the print."
