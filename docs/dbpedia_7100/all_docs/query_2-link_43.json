        "text": "Codonomics\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\n--\n\nDo you know that OrangeScape initiated and sponsors a CTO Talk series (by hosting the event in their Chennai office premises, providing all supplements, etc)? It’s called, well, a CTOTalk. I got to learn about it when they hosted their second session of this series.\n\nFor the second session of CTO Talk, they invited a CTO turned Venture Partner to share some of his lessons learned from the trenches, by being a CTO. And he was Pramod Jajoo, an ex-CTO at BigBasket (henceforth called BB) who is now donning the hat of a Venture Partner at Kalaari Capital.\n\nIn this post, I’ll try to summarize the goodness of the session and my wish-list as a participant, to pique your interest and that of the host :P\n\nPost that summary, I’ll draw my quick notes on the session for you to get a little feel for the session’s content alongside my view-points :)\n\nThe Session Goodness\n\nYou hear lessons from the trenches first-hand from the seasoned folks giving the talk. Not convinced or clear about something in the talk? You just shoot your questions candidly but politely. Interact and get better.\n\nAlso, guess what? These sessions go live on FB. There isn’t an excuse to not join right?\n\nOpportunity to meet other members from the tech community. I am really happy getting to know a couple of them and eager to discover others.\n\nOrangeScape’s founder Suresh Sambandam took efforts to not just invite the speaker but be personally present, participate in the discussions and ensure that all things for the smooth functioning of this event was taken care of.\n\nWas there something to munch apart from tech stuff? There sure was. Lots of water, biscuits and hot tea/coffee was served, to keep one awake and motivated.\n\nThe Wish-list as Participant\n\nSome bit of awareness needs to be made by way advertising enough about this series and more importantly that they can virtually attend it as the event goes live on FB. It would be cool to publish this link on the meet-up page. #Traction\n\nHow I wish, there was an extra hour or two for folks to mingle and discuss all things tech. This would be a fantastic icing on the cake. #P2P\n\nI wish water bottles be served only to the invited speaker. Typically, I wish everyone be encouraged to grab a glass of water from vending machine. #GoEcoFriendly\n\nQuick Notes from Pramod’s talk\n\nFirsts thing first, check the alignment of your company’s vision and values.\n\nBe aware of budget constraints and plan for things accordingly. Keep monitoring your costs.\n\nCulture eats everything for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don’t undermine it’s importance. Get it right or loose your sight.\n\nFocus on the business need and don’t be carried away by tech jargon.\n\n— I liked the emphasis he gave on the need for coaching the development team on this.\n\nBoy, I lost count on the number of times when the wrong choice of tech became a pain instead of being a gain. It was either reluctance to embrace new tech or jump into the new tech because it is the current fad. Either way, the business need had taken a back-seat and the tech nuked the business.\n\n— You don’t often hear a CTO say this, but Pramod made it explicit. He acknowledged that some tech problems are very mundane but might have a huge business impact.\n\nI think it is good to be explicit about it and acknowledge it to the team. I think such admissions are a trust builder.\n\nGo the cloud way and don’t forget to monitor your costs.\n\nIt pays to keep tab on Application Security.\n\n— Pramod cited a couple of instances from his experience, where in one such instance, a wrong S3 access policy led to anyone with AWS account to access the S3 bucket.\n\nWhile I don’t think this exists now with the AWS cloud’s evolution and better maturity, the experience teaches the lesson to be pessimistic about app security.\n\n— Pramod also gave another instance of issues in security in AWS Elastic Search cluster that I can’t recollect now.\n\nHere again, I think Amazon comes to your rescue if you were to make use of their services of this, instead of you hosting/managing it on their infrastructure. Amazon got better. Hosting in Amazon and thinking of hosting Elastic Search cluster? Don’t. Favor Amazon’s ElasticSearch service instead of you hosting/managing it in Amazon EC2.\n\nPramod strongly recommended doing the following for better security:\n\n— Penetration testing\n\n— API safeguarding\n\n— WAF to prevent DDoS in production\n\n— HTTPS is a must (You have it right?)\n\n— The real brownie for me: Use bug-bounty program. For this you can try BugCrowd.\n\nGetting the order of Architecture priorities right. It has to be in the order of — Robustness, Performance and then Scalability.\n\nPramod’s Tech Tips\n\nOn Robustness\n\n— Making things functional\n\n— KISS principle\n\n— Don’t keep introducing new tech and framework\n\n— Employ tech that solves the problem over bleeding/cool tech.\n\nI would clap out loud for this single big of advice from Pramod.\n\nOn Scalability\n\n— Pramod says it is more of an internal problem and that sure rings a bell. Doesn’t it?\n\n— Embrace Async workflow (Think Pub/Sub paradigm). Some use-cases where BB employed it are Business workflows, processing side-effects, lazy loading of cache.\n\nFavor open-source as much as possible.\n\nI second this. Any day, you would find me parroting this one.\n\nCreate small platform teams to work on technical debt. It kind of worked at BB.\n\nPersonally though, I’m not a fan boy of this approach.\n\nApp platform of choice: Javascript. Because you can employ it end to end. It’s the most popular and widely adopted language by developers across the world based on StackOverflow survey results.\n\nPersonally, I hate Javascript because it has more pains than goodness. Also, I would say, if you are not into TDD, don’t adopt Javascript as platform of choice. All said with the advent of ES6 and big community participation it sure seems promising.\n\nTech evolution at Big-basket\n\nMonitoring: Nagios to HP OpenView to Pingdom/Datadog\n\nApp Platform : From Python to Node. Currently 30% of BB’s tech-stack is Node.\n\nCacheinig: Memcache to Redis to Aerospike.\n\n— Aerospike is used dfor nosql source-of-record and not just for cache.\n\n— RAM is costlier than SSD. Flipkart and Snapdeal as well uses Aerospike.\n\nAsync Workflow: RabbitMQ/Celery to Kafka\n\n— BB when they were using RabbitMQ with multi-broker clustering, ran into issues causing latency.\n\nAnalytics:\n\n— Scala/Kinesis pipeline to Redshift/ELK\n\n— SnowPlow for Analytics\n\nData-Science : Use Python and SparkML\n\nSearch/Browse : ElasticSearch (BB’s use-cases being Offers, promotions, serving banners, ad-injections)\n\nFrontend : PWA, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Jquery, SASS"
