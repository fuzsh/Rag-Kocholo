This in turn can serve as the starting point of a ‘gap analysis’ to identify management tools or system elements that might usefully be implemented in the organization to help improve overall performance.\n\nHow to use the Self-Assessment\n\nOn the following pages are a series of questions to identify to what extent your OrangeScape initiative is complete in comparison to the requirements set in standards.\n\nTo facilitate answering the questions, there is a space in front of each question to enter a score on a scale of ‘1’ to ‘5’.\n\n1 Strongly Disagree\n\n2 Disagree\n\n3 Neutral\n\n4 Agree\n\n5 Strongly Agree\n\nRead the question and rate it with the following in front of mind:\n\n‘In my belief,\n\nthe answer to this question is clearly defined’.\n\nThere are two ways in which you can choose to interpret this statement;\n\n1.how aware are you that the answer to the question is clearly defined\n\n2.for more in-depth analysis you can choose to gather evidence and confirm the answer to the question. This obviously will take more time, most Self-Assessment users opt for the first way to interpret the question and dig deeper later on based on the outcome of the overall Self-Assessment.\n\nA score of ‘1’ would mean that the answer is not clear at all, where a ‘5’ would mean the answer is crystal clear and defined. Leave emtpy when the question is not applicable or you don’t want to answer it, you can skip it without affecting your score. Write your score in the space provided.\n\nAfter you have responded to all the appropriate statements in each section, compute your average score for that section, using the formula provided, and round to the nearest tenth. Then transfer to the corresponding spoke in the OrangeScape Scorecard on the second next page of the Self-Assessment.\n\nYour completed OrangeScape Scorecard will give you a clear presentation of which OrangeScape areas need attention.\n\nOrangeScape\n\nScorecard Example\n\nExample of how the finalized Scorecard can look like:\n\nOrangeScape\n\nScorecard\n\nYour Scores:\n\nBEGINNING OF THE\n\nSELF-ASSESSMENT:\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout The Art of Service7\n\nAcknowledgments8\n\nIncluded Resources - how to access8\n\nYour feedback is invaluable to us10\n\nPurpose of this Self-Assessment10\n\nHow to use the Self-Assessment11\n\nOrangeScape\n\nScorecard Example13\n\nOrangeScape\n\nScorecard14\n\nBEGINNING OF THE\n\nSELF-ASSESSMENT:15\n\nCRITERION #1: RECOGNIZE16\n\nCRITERION #2: DEFINE:23\n\nCRITERION #3: MEASURE:34\n\nCRITERION #4: ANALYZE:47\n\nCRITERION #5: IMPROVE:56\n\nCRITERION #6: CONTROL:68\n\nCRITERION #7: SUSTAIN:78\n\nOrangeScape and Managing Projects, Criteria for Project Managers:103\n\n1.0 Initiating Process Group: OrangeScape104\n\n1.1 Project Charter: OrangeScape106\n\n1.2 Stakeholder Register: OrangeScape108\n\n1.3 Stakeholder Analysis Matrix: OrangeScape109\n\n2.0 Planning Process Group: OrangeScape111\n\n2.1 Project Management Plan: OrangeScape113\n\n2.2 Scope Management Plan: OrangeScape115\n\n2.3 Requirements Management Plan: OrangeScape117\n\n2.4 Requirements Documentation: OrangeScape119\n\n2.5 Requirements Traceability Matrix: OrangeScape121\n\n2.6 Project Scope Statement: OrangeScape123\n\n2.7 Assumption and Constraint Log: OrangeScape125\n\n2.8 Work Breakdown Structure: OrangeScape127\n\n2.9 WBS Dictionary: OrangeScape129\n\n2.10 Schedule Management Plan: OrangeScape132\n\n2.11 Activity List: OrangeScape134\n\n2.12 Activity Attributes: OrangeScape136\n\n2.13 Milestone List: OrangeScape138\n\n2.14 Network Diagram: OrangeScape140\n\n2.15 Activity Resource Requirements: OrangeScape142\n\n2.16 Resource Breakdown Structure: OrangeScape144\n\n2.17 Activity Duration Estimates: OrangeScape146\n\n2.18 Duration Estimating Worksheet: OrangeScape148\n\n2.19 Project Schedule: OrangeScape150\n\n2.20 Cost Management Plan: OrangeScape152\n\n2.21 Activity Cost Estimates: OrangeScape154\n\n2.22 Cost Estimating Worksheet: OrangeScape156\n\n2.23 Cost Baseline: OrangeScape158\n\n2.24 Quality Management Plan: OrangeScape160\n\n2.25 Quality Metrics: OrangeScape162\n\n2.26 Process Improvement Plan: OrangeScape164\n\n2.27 Responsibility Assignment Matrix: OrangeScape166\n\n2.28"
