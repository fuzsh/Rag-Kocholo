        "text": "PACIFIC PALISADES – Academy Award-winning director Sydney Pollack, known for such films as “Out of Africa,” “Tootsie” and “The Way We Were” died at his home Monday surrounded by family, according to Variety. He was 73.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, told reporters Pollack died of cancer. He had been diagnosed about nine months ago but doctors never pinpointed the primary cause of the disease, Dart said. Pollack, whose career spanned nearly 50 years, also produced more than 40 films for theatrical release and television and worked regularly as an actor. He played the father of Will Truman on four episodes of the long-running hit sitcom “Will and Grace” and is featured in the current box office hit “Made of Honor.”\n\nThe Lafayette, Ind. native also produced the HBO film “Recount” about the contested 2000 election between President George W. Bush and former Vice President Al Gore, which premiered May 14.\n\nAs a film director, the Indiana native worked with such A-list stars as Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Sidney Poitier, Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep.\n\nIn addition to “The Way We Were,” Pollack directed six other films starring Robert Redford including “Three Days of the Condor,” “Jeremiah Johnson” and “The Electric Horseman.”\n\nHe won the Academy Award as Best Director in 1986 for the romantic epic “Out of Africa,” which starred Redford and Streep. The film, which he produced, also won the Best Picture award.\n\nIn addition, Pollack was nominated for Best Director in 1983 for “Tootsie” and in 1970 for “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?”\n\nIn recent years, Pollack worked closely with actor-director George Clooney on the 2007 film “Michael Clayton,” and “Leatherheads,” which was released earlier this year. Pollack produced both films and appeared in “Michael Clayton” along with Clooney.\n\n“Sydney made the world a little better, movies a little better and even dinner a little better,” Clooney said in a prepared statement. “A tip of the hat to a class act. He’ll be missed terribly.”\n\nOther notable films directed by Pollack include “Absence of Malice,” “The Slender Thread” and the documentary “Sketches of Frank Gehry.”\n\nActress Sally Field, who co-starred in 1981’s “Absence of Malice” with Newman, paid tribute to Pollack in a prepared statement.\n\n“Having the opportunity to know Sydney and work with him was a great gift in my life,” Field’s statement said. “He was a good friend and a phenomenal director and I will cherish every moment that I ever spent with him.”\n\nTeri Garr, one of the co-stars in the popular comedy “Tootsie” about a cross-dressing actor played by Hoffman, also had fond memories of her time working with Pollack.\n\n“He was just the greatest,” Garr said, according to ABC7. “He was a freeing director and let us do what we wanted to do. I felt so comfortable with him. He realized we were more than actors. We were human beings.”\n\nPollack produced several of his films under the banner Mirage Enterprises along with his partner, writer-director Anthony Minghella, who died March 18 of a brain hemorrhage.\n\nWhen the American Film Institute named the 100 best American love stories in 2002, Pollack was the only director with two films near the top of the list: the tale of star-crossed lovers “The Way We Were” starring Redford and Streisand at No. 6 and “Out of Africa” at No. 13.\n\nIn 2000 Pollack, who directed at least a dozen actors to Academy Award- nominated performances, was honored with the John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America as a “defender of artists’ rights.”\n\nPollack is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Claire; two daughters, Rebecca and Rachel; six grandchildren; and his brother Bernie, a Hollywood costume designer. His son, Steven, was killed in a 1993 plane crash.\n\nDart said all memorial services will be private."
