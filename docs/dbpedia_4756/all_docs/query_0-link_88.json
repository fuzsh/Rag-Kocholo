        "text": "Male leads in romantic films are on average four and a half years older than their female co-stars, a new study has found.\n\nWriter and producer Stephen Follows decided to research the difference between the ages of male and female leads in romantic films over the last 30 years, following comments from Maggie Gyllenhaal.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress revealed that she was turned down for a part because she was deemed too old to star alongside the 55-year-old male lead.\n\nAfter looking at cast information for 422 films released between 1984 and 2014, he found that there was never a time that the average age of female leads was older than their male counterparts.\n\nRobert Redford, Dudley Moore and Richard Gere have the largest age gaps among Hollywood actors, while Julia Roberts, Debra Winger and Winona Ryder have traditionally been much younger than their co-stars.\n\nSydney Pollack had the largest average age gap between his two leads at 16 years and 5 months.\n\nFollows concluded: \"The answers are quite clear, data wise, but what they mean is open for discussion. Art and culture influence how we live our lives and what we regard as \"normal\", and the film industry is a big part of that.\""
