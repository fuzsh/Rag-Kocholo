        "text": "Film-maker, actor and producer ... Sydney Pollack. Photograph: AP/Keystone\n\nI have a hunch that a very intriguing novel might have been written based on the life of Sydney Pollack. It would go something like this: born in the mid-west, in Indiana, in 1934, of Russian-Jewish descent, the young Sydney was eager to act. He studied well, he served in the army and then he found himself slipping into television and movies just as the kingdom called Hollywood broke down. So it began to be easier to make interesting, dangerous films. Before he was 35, Sydney made a few pictures like that - This Property is Condemned, Castle Keep, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\n\nThen he met a real star, Robert Redford, a shining and deceiving knight, and the knight said: \"Come with me - we'll do great things together.\" In a way they did - The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, The Electric Horseman, Out of Africa. By the end of that line Sydney Pollack had made it - he won the Oscars for best director and best picture, and he was rich on a series of hits. On the other hand, if I may say so, Out of Africa wasn't much more than an advertisement for going on safari with Robert Redford. In all the Redford films, there wasn't a spark of the real danger there had been in They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, one of the best films ever made about America in the Depression.\n\nWhat makes our novel is that Pollack was smart enough to see what had happened. He knew the subtle, delicate ways he had sold out, and he knew the weakness in himself that had let it happen. He was in pain, very successful pain. The films he directed got worse and worse - Havana, The Firm, Sabrina, Random Hearts and the quite dreadful The Interpreter. You'd have to steel yourself to look at that series again to appreciate the terrible loss of character. And then look at the strange self-congratulatory documentary he did on architect Frank Gehry to get a glimpse of the sort of respect Pollack longed for.\n\nSo he began to act more, as a way of staying cheerful. And he was a good, funny actor, as showed in everything from Tootsie to Husbands and Wives to Eyes Wide Shut. He was an old-fashioned scene-stealer and one looked forward to his appearances. He also became a producer. He had formed his own company, Mirage, and then later he took on Anthony Minghella as a partner. They did some fascinating things together: The Talented Mr Ripley, Birthday Girl, Heaven, The Quiet American.\n\nPollack was 20 years older than Minghella, but the two men found a real love and respect, and in the novel you might see Pollack slowly recovering his younger self. Then Pollack developed cancer, and it would be a bitter-sweet conclusion to the novel that as Pollack prepared for death - like Robert Redford playing a dying man - Minghella's death came up like a knife in the dark, unexpected, and forestalled him. It must have left a bleak loneliness."
