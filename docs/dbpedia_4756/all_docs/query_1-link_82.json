        "meta_description": "Sydney Pollack's characteristically solid, incisive direction has become a throwback to the days of subtler movie storytelling. But it still rivets attention during the first half of this star-crossed romance, which tells of two people who meet after their spouses die in the same plane crash. The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops that the dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall into a bittersweet relationship of their own. Harrison Ford is taciturnly forceful, Kristin Scott Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as credulity-stretching complications ensue. &#151; Janet Maslin",

        "text": "In a nutshell, Sydney Pollack's new film, ''Random Hearts,'' is about two people from different worlds, a Washington policeman played by Harrison Ford and a New Hampshire Congresswoman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. They meet when their spouses die in the same plane crash. Then they discover that the spouses were having an affair. Then they have an affair of their own.\n\nBut ''Random Hearts'' is the kind of movie that won't fit into a nutshell. Mr. Pollack's films, from ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' to ''Three Days of the Condor'' to ''Tootsie'' to ''Out of Africa,'' have always refused to work that way. They have managed to be linear while also drifting thoughtfully through the nuances of their characters' behavior, with a stylistic polish and keenness of observation not often found in American films anymore. The ostensibly high-concept ''Tootsie'' is probably the only film of Mr. Pollack's that could easily be made today.\n\nTo be sure, the liability of a certain sogginess accompanies Mr. Pollack's brand of thinking-man's romanticism (as it did in ''Havana''). And there is a sizable segment of the moviegoing audience with no interest in watching Mr. Ford go through the agonies of a cuckolded husband. But the tough, laconic Mr. Ford is wrenchingly effective throughout most of ''Random Hearts,'' and the story in which he figures is a strong one. As a hard-boiled middle-aged character who took his marriage for granted and now finds himself wondering which was the last honest moment he and his wife actually spent together, he has quite a lot to work with this time.\n\nThe film is at its best in its first hour, as it details the busy lives of its star-crossed principals and watches disaster inexorably approach. Ms. Scott Thomas's businesslike Kay Chandler is so busy that she considers it good planning to arrange being in the same state with her husband (Peter Coyote) for their teen-age daughter's birthday. Meanwhile, Mr. Ford's Van Den Broeck (''They call me Dutch -- it's easier'') is a mean cuss when it comes to Internal Affairs at the Police Department, but a domesticated specimen at home. Sweaty in the morning after a long run, he feels entirely confident of the devotion of his wife (Susanna Thompson). She, meanwhile, casually tells him that she has to be in Miami for a department-store catalogue shoot and winds up side by side with her lover on an airplane, nicely dressed, perfectly groomed and deep under water.\n\n''Random Hearts'' watches as news of the plane crash creeps into the dramatic foreground. It takes a while for either Dutch or Kay to notice the bulletins on television and feel connected to the disaster. Then, in a scene that mixes Mr. Pollack's instinct for the ineffable and his skill with the mundane, Dutch finds himself incongruously at the dress department where his wife worked, asking about her business in Miami and finding out that she had none. ''We think we know,'' says a saleswoman sadly. ''Nobody knows. You just don't know.''\n\nThe film watches Dutch fall into a baleful rage, as when a plane crash investigator sensitively tells him that he shouldn't be alone at such a time. ''Oh yeah?'' growls Dutch. ''I was alone before you got here.'' And it watches as he crosses paths with Ms. Scott Thomas's briskly efficient widow, who happens to be in the midst of a re-election campaign. (Mr. Pollack makes an amusing appearance as her media consultant.) At first, he decides not to tell her what he knows. Then he can't help it, and the two of them are drawn together in ways not even the movie can explain.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
