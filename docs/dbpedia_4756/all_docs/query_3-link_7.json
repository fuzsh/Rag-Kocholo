        "text": "Few locales are as beloved by celebrities as Malibu, California. The once-sleepy beach town is now home to some of the state’s priciest real estate. For decades the quiet community has drawn A-list actors, musicians, and executives, who find the weather, ocean views, abundant outdoor activities, dining scene, and proximity to Los Angeles make it the ideal place to settle down.\n\nIt’s not unlikely to spot A-listers simply going about their days on a trip to the golden coast. However, if you’re hoping to spot celebrities in Malibu, these are the spots to do it. Just remember: Celebrities love Malibu because of its secluded, low-key nature. So, giving them the privacy they’re entitled to is always best.\n\nNobu\n\nThe first spot on this list is also the place you’re most likely to run into a chart-topping musician or Oscar-nominated actor. Malibu residents Kanye West and Courtney Cox have visited Nobu Matsuhisa’s beachside sushi paradise in recent months, and Justin and Hailey Bieber celebrated Valentine’s Day with lunch there. Nobu is a classic for a reason, and celebrities know it too.\n\nLucky’s\n\nThis steakhouse is a favorite of Santa Barbara residents, and its Malibu outpost has proved to be just as popular since it opened last year. The menu includes classic steakhouse favorites, and its location at Malibu Country Mart couldn’t be more ideal. The new location has drawn A-listers including Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker, who took their kids there this month. It has also attracted Cindy Crawford, Pierce Brosnan, and Kendall Jenner.\n\nTaverna Tony\n\nThis classic Greek taverna offers a lively atmosphere and a seafood-heavy menu. Kourtney Kardashian has stopped in with TikTok star Addison Rae, but it’s also beloved by Hollywood’s older generation. Barbra Streisand hosted her 70th birthday party there in 2012. The guest list included Jane Fonda, Steven Spielberg, Warren Beatty, and many more.\n\nReal Coconut Kitchen\n\nCelebrities love a good juice run, and Real Coconut Kitchen in Malibu Country Mart is a favorite for its juices, smoothies, salads, and plant-focused fare. Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio frequents the spot, as does actress Leighton Meester.\n\nSoho House\n\nThough you’ll need to be a member of the exclusive club to spot celebrities there, Soho House Malibu is a favorite hangout of some of Malibu’s most prominent residents, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Kanye West, and Miley Cyrus (who loves the town so much she wrote a hit song about it).\n\nThe Beach\n\nIt might sound counterintuitive, but one of the best places to spot celebrities is the most low-key spot of them all—at one of Malibu’s many beaches. Many celebrity residents own beachfront homes, so the beach is quite literally their backyard. It’s not uncommon to see major celebs walking their dogs, taking a stroll, or letting loose with friends. Also, if you get in the water, you might even get the chance to have a conversation with an A-lister. Leighton Meester, Adam Brody, Jonah Hill, Gerard Butler, Matt Damon, and many more celebrities have been spotted surfing Malibu’s legendary waters.\n\nMalibu Beach Inn\n\nLastly, if you want to feel like a celebrity, wander over to the Malibu Beach Inn where low-key luxury and an ideal location on a strip of coastline nicknamed Billionaire’s Beach will have you feeling like a VIP. Malibu Beach Inn’s Carbon Beach Club has an expansive deck designed for celebrating big dinners, as well as a cozy dining room with plenty of alcoves for private conversations. Though it’s a spot to see and be seen, every guest—regardless of whether or not they’ve been seen in the pages of a tabloid—appreciates the privacy and seclusion it offers."
