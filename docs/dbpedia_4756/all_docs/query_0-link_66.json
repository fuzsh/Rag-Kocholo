        "text": "2023 was the year the world learned to pronounce Cillian. The ancient Irish name seemed to be on everyone's lips as the film \"Oppenheimer\" became a blockbuster with 13 Oscar nominations — including best actor for Cillian Murphy. Murphy has worked nonstop for nearly 30 years, but it was the epic drama of the atomic bomb that ignited a star. In this moment, with a Golden Globe under his porkpie hat and the Oscars three weeks away, Murphy is more famous than well-known. So, we set out to learn more. We were warned the 47-year-old Irishman is reserved and wouldn't talk about himself. But we discovered finding Cillian Murphy depends on where you look.\n\nIreland's Dingle Peninsula was named for a goddess before such things were written. And for 6,000 years stories have passed by ear.\n\nSo, if verse inhabits every Irish soul—then, in a country pub, Cillian Murphy is among peers—as he would have it—just a man with a pint to lift and no fame to bear.\n\nScott Pelley: What is the meaning of Ireland –\n\nCillian Murphy: Oh man!\n\nScott Pelley: —to you?\n\nCillian Murphy: I don't think I can answer that question satisfactorily. It's defined who I am as a person and my values. It's just home.\n\nHome includes his wife of 20 years, two teenage sons and scout, a lab named for the character in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" That figures, Murphy has always let stories lead his path.\n\nCillian Murphy: You find so much empathy in novels, you know, because there you are putting yourself into somebody else's point of view, and I've always been a big reader. When a movie can connect with someone, and they feel seen or feel heard, or a novel can change somebody's life, or a piece of music-- an album-- can change someone's life. And I've had all that happen to me. And that's the power of good art, I think.\n\nScott Pelley: There's a straight line from the music in the pub to \"Oppenheimer?\"\n\nCillian Murphy: I think they're from the same source, I mean, I really do. I don't see-- I see it's all on a continuum. You know what I mean? It's just a form of expression.\n\nExpression, in the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who created the atom bomb but never controlled it.\n\nCillian Murphy: I remember reading at the beginning about him, that he was more riddle than answer. And I thought, \"Oh, OK. Wow. That's interesting.\"\n\nScott Pelley: I'm curious about your notes…\n\nThe riddle was in this script by writer-director Christopher Nolan—printed in red so it couldn't be photocopied.\n\nCillian Murphy: I did genuinely think it's one of the greatest screenplays I'd ever read.\n\nScott Pelley: And you told him, \"I'll do it.\"\n\nCillian Murphy: I mean, I said I would do it before I read it. I always say that --\n\nScott Pelley: That's quite a risk. Why would you do that?\n\nCillian Murphy: It's always paid off for me, you know, in every film that I worked with him on.\n\nThere have been six Chris Nolan films for Murphy: \"Dunkirk,\" \"Inception\" and three \"Batman\" titles.\n\nScott Pelley: You told me that getting a film made, and getting it seen, is a miracle.\n\nCillian Murphy: It is. And then if it's any way good, that's a miracle. And then if it connects with audiences, that's a miracle. So, it's a miracle, upon miracle, upon miracle to have a film like \"Oppenheimer.\" It really is.\n\nHis Oppenheimer was not so much a miracle as hard work. He lost 28 pounds to get the silhouette. Then, he rose to the character step-by-step over six months--reading, listening to Oppenheimer's lectures and covering miles on the beach performing for Scout.\n\nCillian Murphy: I remember at one point, I said to Chris-- \"Chris, there appears to be-- he appears to speak Dutch here. And I think he's giving a lecture in Dutch here. What are we gonna do about that?\" And Chris said, \"You mean what are you gonna do about that.\"\n\nMurphy says he put all he learned in the back of his mind and acted on instinct.\n\nCillian Murphy: I think instinct is your most powerful tool that you have as an actor. Nothing must be predetermined. So therefore, you mustn't have a plan about how you're gonna play stuff. And I love that. It's like being buffeted by the wind and being buffeted by emotion.\n\nEmily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's tormented wife.\n\nEmily Blunt: He's very visceral to be in a scene with. It's like you, he transports you. He'll kidnap you in a scene.\n\nScott Pelley: My favorite acting moment, of his, in \"Oppenheimer…\"\n\nScott Pelley: --is the scene after the bomb has been dropped, and he's addressing all of the people at Los Alamos.\n\nScott Pelley: He somehow welds together the concept of being proud of what they did--\n\nEmily Blunt: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: -- and regretting it very deeply.\n\nEmily Blunt: Yes. Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: All at the same time.\n\nEmily Blunt: I know!\n\nEmily Blunt: No one moment is about one thing. And if you're as agile as someone like Cillian, and as vulnerable, and as clever, you can play it all. But I don't know if many people can do what he does.\n\nCillian Murphy discovered agility in his hometown, Cork. His mother was a teacher, his father, a school inspector. In high school Murphy and his brother had a band …\n\nPerforming led to acting class and his first play.\n\nScott Pelley: This is more like the size of a storage room than a theater.\n\nCillian Murphy: Yeah. But that's all we were used to.\n\nHis first theater—1996—age 20 –the play was \"Disco Pigs,\" which grew to bigger theaters and became a movie.\n\nScott Pelley: Why did you think you could be an actor?\n\nCillian Murphy: I didn't. I was very comfortable on stage in front of an audience from when I was little. I never had any nerves doing that. It felt natural, you know? And thrilling.\n\nScott Pelley: In this theater, what did you learn about acting?\n\nCillian Murphy: There's, ah, a fire escape door right there. And that's-- kind of an alleyway there, and so you get a lot of, like, drunk guys out of their mind bashing up against the fire escape door. And it used to kinda energize us. So I remember learning about, like, taking whatever you have-- sort of responding to whatever the energy is in the room and using it.\n\nScott Pelley: That's really good training, maintaining your character with the drunk guy yelling through the fire escape door.\n\nCillian Murphy: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I-- and I-- and I think theater is such-- an absurd undertaking when you think of it. You know, because at any point it could collapse and go wrong.\n\nScott Pelley: It's dangerous.\n\nCillian Murphy: Yeah! And I love that aspect of it. Yeah.\n\nThat love led him to drop law school. And since then, there have been a dozen plays and 40 movies.\n\nCillian Murphy: I love it when it becomes an immersive experience. I love getting lost in it. In the early days, that was with theater. It felt kind of extraordinary that with just the power of will and a couple of lights and a good script, we were creating this world. And so, it's that's kind of addictive, when it works well.\n\nIt worked well in 2013, in a breakout role as a leading man.\n\nIn the series, \"Peaky Blinders,\" Murphy plays Thomas Shelby who survives World War 1, to lead a family of gangsters.\n\nCillian Murphy: They're all damaged, broken men, but something got knocked in him, and he came back with this incredible drive, and ambition and, like, \"I'm not afraid of death, so now I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nScott Pelley: In Tommy Shelby you created a sympathetic, relatable, monster.\n\nCillian Murphy: I like to be challenged. And I-- and when I read something, I wanna go, \"I don't really know how I can do that.\"\n\nIn 10 years of \"Peaky Blinders,\" Murphy came into his own.\n\nCillian Murphy: I heard very early on in my career, a director, it was one of the Sydneys, it could've been Sidney Lumet or it could've been Sydney Pollack, but one of them said, \"It takes 30 years to make an actor.\" It's not just technique and experience and all that it's maturing as a human being and trying to grapple with life and figure it out, and all of that stuff. So, by the time you've been doing it for 30 years, you have all of that banked, hopefully. And eventually, then I think you'll get to a point where you might be an okay actor.\n\nMaturing is the theme of Murphy's next film based on the novel, \"Small Things Like These.\" He plays Bill Furlong, tormented by injustice. His wife fears his empathy will upend their lives.\n\nThat's Eileen Walsh. No actor has known Murphy longer. She was his first partner, in \"Disco Pigs,\" 28 years ago.\n\nScott Pelley: Is his work ethic rooted in fear or joy?\n\nEileen Walsh: Oh, that's a good question. I think it can only be joy. But it sometimes takes a lotta pain to get to that joy.\n\nEileen Walsh: The deeper we go with acting the cost is greater for us. And physically I know Oppenheimer, you know, has cost him for the weight loss he insisted and, you know, it was his choice to do, but it was the right choice to create that amazing silhouette. But from the very beginning our warm-ups for \"Disco Pigs\" involved us punching each other quite hard. And, like, going for it, and then bursting out into it. This huge ball of velocity coming into it was the beginning of an \"Oppenheimer,\" was the whole kind of atom of us.\n\nNow, after three decades of work, Cillian Murphy is cast in the most familiar Irish legend of all. Maybe there is gold, a 24-karat gold-plated statue, at the end of his spectrum of talent.\n\nScott Pelley: You have screwed this up though, you know?\n\nCillian Murphy: In what way?\n\nScott Pelley: You used to be an actor\n\nCillian Murphy: Yeah.\n\nScott Pelley: --and now you're a movie star.\n\nCillian Murphy: Oh OK, am I? I think you can be both. You know-- I've never understood that term, really, \"movie star.\" I've always just felt like-- I'm an actor. That's I think a term for other people, rather than for me.\n\nProduced by Nicole Young. Associate producer, Kristin Steve. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim. Edited by Peter M. Berman and Jorge J.
