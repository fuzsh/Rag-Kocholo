He is one of the few directors remaining with two films that land in the top 100 of their respective decade. And it’s more than just the films at the top- Absence of Malice is a very fine film and I have it as his sixth best- so there is strong depth here, too. Pollack started as an actor. Of course, he continued to act and is in (and is good in) films like Woody’s Husbands and Wives, Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, and Michael Clayton. That may be Pollack’s greatest trait as a director- working with actors. He worked with some powerhouse movie stars and actors. Clearly they respected him and he elicited some great performances.\n\nBest film: Out of Africa. Some will object to the Merchant/Ivory-ness or novelistic nature of this film, but it is, undeniably, gorgeous to look at. The airplane aerial shots are stunning, strong exterior photography, costume work. Streep is sublime—but so is John Barry’s score musical score (if you think you’ve heard it before, he did it again in another best picture winner Dances With Wolves five years later in 1990) and David Watkin’s cinematography.\n\ntotal archiveable films: 7\n\ntop 100 films: 0\n\ntop 500 films: 0\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 2 (Three Days of the Condor, Out of Africa)\n\nmost overrated: Tootsie. It is at #484 on the TSPDT list. I don’t understand this one being there at all.\n\nmost underrated : Not much here- I’d have to go Out of Africa here as well. It is one of those best picture winners that is now underrated because for decades now everyone says it didn’t deserve to win best picture and it isn’t the best film of 1985 (and it isn’t- that is Brazil). But still, it is a damn fine film—very far from being the worst best picture winner. Jeremiah Johnson, Three Days of the Condor and Out of Africa all land between 1001 and 2000 on the TSPDT consensus list.\n\ngem I want to spotlight : Three Days of the Condor. Even those that love the New Hollywood 1970’s cinema, Redford, Dunaway, and Max von Sydow individually– seem to never talk about this one. Maybe because it is nobody’s best film? It is a nice add to the resume for all of the above though. It is an excellent thriller—just a hint behind the work of Pakula in the paranoia trilogy.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits:\n\nOften featuring the plight of renegade individualists (mavericks or loners) lost in society’s changes or a corruption\n\nA great use of the telephoto lens in Tootsie as Hoffman walks down New York just like Voight did in Midnight Cowboy in the sea of people or how Hoffman himself ran in place in The Graduate\n\nRedford is a partner here of course- he’s in four of the seven films in the archives below\n\ntop 10\n\nOut of Africa\n\nThree Days of the Condor\n\nTootsie\n\nThey Shoot Horses, Don’t They?\n\nJeremiah Johnson\n\nAbsence of Malice\n\nThe Way We Were\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1969- They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? R 1972- Jeremiah Johnson R 1973- The Way We Were R 1975- Three Days of the Condor HR 1981- Absence of Malice R 1982- Tootsie R/HR 1985- Out of Africa MS\n\n*MP is Masterpiece- top 1-3 quality of the year film\n\nMS is Must-see- top 5-6 quality of the year film\n\nHR is Highly Recommend- top 10 quality of the year film\n\nR is Recommend- outside the top 10 of the year quality film but still in the archives"
