        "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- \"Machete\" star Danny Trejo was involved in a fight that broke out at the Sunland-Tujunga Independence Day Parade.\n\nThe incident began when someone reportedly threw a water balloon at the vintage convertible Trejo was in. That's when things unraveled.\n\nVideo posted on social media shows the 80-year-old actor confront a man along the route, presumably the person he thought threw the water balloon. That footage appears to show Trejo throw a punch at the man and the man swings back. The man's punch didn't connect but a scuffle ensues and Trejo falls down.\n\nThe man who swung at Trejo then punches another man in the face and knocks him to the ground.\n\nA larger scuffle breaks out, but it was quickly stopped by bystanders as they de-escalated the situation.\n\nAt one point during the melee, Trejo grabs a foldable chair and then tosses it.\n\nVideo of the aftermath shows Trejo argue with a woman who appears to be holding him back.\n\nA witness said he immediately pulled out his cellphone and captured the heated moments, which reportedly lasted nearly 10 minutes before police showed up.\n\n\"This parade is like a thing where you throw water balloons back and forth at each other,\" witness Stanley Herrarte said.\n\n\"The reason why Danny was so infuriated was because usually people don't throw water balloons at fancy cars when they come by,\" he added.\n\nEyewitness News has reached out to Trejo's representatives and parade organizers for comment.\n\nTrejo has made a career in Hollywood of playing tough guys and villains. He's perhaps most identified with the character Machete from several Robert Rodriguez films.\n\nIn recent years, he's also branched out to the food business."
