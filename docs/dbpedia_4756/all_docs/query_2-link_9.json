        "text": "Post by spiderwort on\n\nAs a student of Sandy Meisner, Pollack learned a lot about acting and worked as an actor in the early sixties in television and in the film War Hunt (1962), co-starring with a man who would become his life-long friend and collaborator, Robert Redford. When he turned to directing in 1965 with The Slender Thread, it was clear that he had a gift for working with actors. His body of work as a director was uneven at best, but he did make some outstanding films during his career.\n\nMy favorites:\n\nTootsie (and I loved his performance in that, too)\n\nOut of Africa\n\nThey Shoot Horses, Don't They\n\nThis Property is Condemned\n\nPost by Doghouse6 on\n\nIn spite of Pollack's affinity for stories that are urban and modern (and exceptions thereto like The Scalphunters or Out Of Africa), and my own lack of affinity for the wilderness and stories about it, the film of his I found most transporting and revelatory was Jeremiah Johnson.\n\nI couldn't have been more surprised by how compelling it was, with its quality of...well, I honestly don't quite know how to describe it. \"Contemplative\" would be one way. \"Serene\" might be another, its isolated moments of peril notwithstanding. With so little dependence upon dialogue and exposition, it's the most purely cinematic of his pictures, and quietly seduces the viewer into a tale that becomes mythic in its proportions, in reflective counterpoint to its intimacy and solitude. An extraordinary and beautiful film.\n\nPost by joekiddlouischama on\n\nWhen I viewed Tootsie in the theater three years ago, after first having seen it as part of a college class in 2001, what stood out to me the most was the film's humorous foreshadowing of gay marriage—in effect, Tootsie was thirty years ahead of its time. I did not find the movie as delightful, rollicking, and funny as I had in college, but I could now appreciate Tootsie's prescience.\n\nPollack's films—especially those starring Robert Redford—possess a lyrical and atmospheric quality, and Jeremiah Johnson strikes me as the most remarkable of the bunch. As indicated earlier in the thread, the film's style, nature, and narrative are not conventionally commercial, yet ironically, the movie became an enormous success at the box office, helping Redford establish himself as a superstar in his own right (as opposed to merely representing Paul Newman's appendage). In fact, Jeremiah Johnson seems to have constituted the most commercially successful Western of the 1970s, probably because of that unconventional quality that appealed to people's sense of both realism and escapism.\n\nYears ago on the original IMDb, I participated in threads about that box-office success and also the question of whether Redford—while effective—proved optimal for the role.\n\nlink\n\nlink\n\nRegardless, Jeremiah Johnson is a visually memorable and stunning film that I would love to see in the theater one day. Actually, I would just like to see it again, as I have not done so since viewing the movie in March 2005 on Turner Classic Movies. And fortunately, TCM is airing it on Saturday, June 16, at 8:00 p.m. EST:link\n\nFor the record (and contrary to that article), Jeremiah Johnson apparently returned about $22M in domestic rentals to the studio and its actual domestic gross was about $44M, making it—thanks to multiple re-releases—a blockbuster success on par with the Harry Callahan and James Bond movies of the era."
