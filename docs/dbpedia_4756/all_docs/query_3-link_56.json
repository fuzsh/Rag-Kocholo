Like, I go to the high school football games and stuff and eat a sandwich, which I didn't know if you could do without kids, but you can,\" he joked. \"And I go to the Christmas play in town and I wait outside and ask little kids to sign my playbill. It's really fun. I love it.\"\n\nBetter yet, the actor added, he enjoys that the locals have \"no idea\" who he is.\n\nIn another sweet snippet, Segel said he also likes to wander through the 21 acres of orange groves on his property and now owns \"a lot\" of overalls.\n\n04 of 20\n\nJames Van Der Beek\n\nThe Dawson's Creek alumnus and and his wife Kimberly relocated their family from California to Texas in September 2020, and haven't look back.\n\n\"We wanted to get the kids out of Los Angeles. We wanted to give them space and we wanted them to live in nature,\" James said in a July 2021 interview for Austin Life magazine. \"When we were flying here for our anniversary, I felt an energy to Austin … It was really cool to realize, 'Oh, I can go be there. We can drop in and bring our family to that.' \"\n\nReflecting on the move in a recent Instagram post, the actor said he realized he hadn't miss L.A. when he and his family returned for a recent vacation there.\n\n\"It didn't feel like home anymore. Maybe it never was. Or maybe it was home for the time it needed to be,\" he wrote in part. \"Or maybe… the key is to appreciate each place for what it is and drop any expectations it'll ever be something it's not.\"\n\nParents of six, James and Kimberly share daughters Olivia, 11, Annabel, 8, Emilia, 6, Gwendolyn, 3½, and sons Joshua, 10, and Jeremiah, 6 months.\n\n05 of 20\n\nChip & Joanna Gaines\n\nThere's no place like home – on the range! The Magnolia moguls put their hometown of Waco, Texas, on the map while starring on Fixer Upper, which aired on HGTV from 2013 to 2017. The couple lives on a 40-are property with their five kids: sons Drake, 17, Duke, 13, Crew, 3, and daughters Ella, 15, and Emmie Kay, 12.\n\nIn 2021, Chip and Jo expanded their farmhouse with an extensive addition that created an entirely new wing.\n\n\"We're adding on a little space because we've added an addition to the family,\" Chip explained in an episode of Fixer Upper: Welcome Home. \"We used to have four kids. Now we've got a toddler on our hip.\"\n\n06 of 20\n\nAdrian Grenier\n\nThe Entourage star opened up in the June issue of Austin Life Magazine about leaving behind his life in New York City and Los Angeles to live on a farm outside of Austin, Texas.\n\nWhile he admits that his big-city life \"was a f-- load of fun, and amazing while it lasted,\" he added, \"I found myself in a stage of my life where I had to change.\"\n\n\"I bought a place in Austin five years ago, and a year ago I decided to move here permanently,\" he told the outlet. \"I had friends here, I ran a business here, and liked the pace. Austin is cosmopolitan without being snooty; it's earthy. People are smart and successful but they don't flaunt it. There is nothing to prove, people accept you and it felt good right away.\"\n\n\"I have been doing environmental work for the last 20 years, I've started organizations and run non-profits, all designed to tell people to live more in line with nature - and yet, I wasn't living that way,\" he said. Now, he's developing his property, where he's \"planted a fruit forest\" and hopes to \"create a wildlife sanctuary.\"\n\n07 of 20\n\nTom Selleck\n\nDespite being a Hollywood household name for over four decades, Selleck loves his low-key life on his 63-acre ranch with wife Jillie.\n\n\"I'm a fairly private person,\" the actor, who shot to fame with Magnum P.I. in the 1980s, told PEOPLE in April 2020. \"And I've always treasured the balance between work and time with my family. It's always about them.\"\n\nWhen Selleck is not shooting Blue Bloods, the police drama now in its tenth season, in N.Y.C., he's at home with his wife of 33 years on their 63-acre Ventura, California, ranch.\n\n\"My relationships and my ranch keep me sane,\" said Selleck, who is dad to Hannah, 31, and Kevin, 54, his son with first wife Jacqueline Ray.\n\nThe massive ranch was a working avocado farm until the plants were decimated by a drought, and is home to over 1,500 native trees. \"I do grunt work and I make the rounds. I like watching things grow. It's a retreat.\"\n\n08 of 20\n\nDenise Richards\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star revealed via Instagram that she and husband Aaron Phypers have plans to move part time to Montana.\n\n\"Soon we will be living here in Montana & Los Angeles.. best of both 🌎,\" Richards captioned her post, which features a photo of the couple smiling. \"the first time I went to la when I was younger I felt like I was home, same feeling visiting Montana for the first time 7yrs ago. Such a sense of peace & simplicity.\"\n\nShe signed off by writing, \"@aaronwilliamcameron I want a ranch with 🐄 🐖 🐔 🐓 🦆 🐴 🐶 🐈 🚜 along with the fancy 💎 💄 👠👜🕶... #BeverlyHillbillyAt❤️\"\n\n09 of 20\n\nJosh Lucas\n\nThe Ford v Ferrari actor moved his family to Indonesia, where they enrolled his son, Noah Rev, 7, in a special school where the mission it is to \"create the next generation of environmental leaders,\" Lucas said on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nLucas explained, \"It's deeply in the jungle. It's like Swiss Family Robinson - they grow their own food, they make their own buildings out of bamboo.\"\n\nThe Sweet Home Alabama actor also had a pretty horrific story to share involving thousands of baby spiders.\n\nHis ex and mother to his son, Jessica Ciencin Henriquez, wrote on Instagram, \"They say if heaven and hell had a baby, it would be Bali. I've never heard a more accurate sentence. One second I'm watching a picture perfect sunset, painted by the gods and the next I'm swatting away a dark cloud of mosquitoes and trying to keep frogs out of the house. One moment I'm madly in love with this nature soaked isolation and the next, I'm on sky scanner checking flights back to civilization.\"\n\n10 of 20\n\nChris Pratt\n\nWhen he isn't starring in Jurassic World or Guardians of the Galaxy, Pratt is raising sheep on a farm in Washington state. He even has prize-winning wool to back it up! He calls the ranch his \"special slice of heaven.\"\n\n11 of 20\n\nCarter Oosterhouse & Amy Smart\n\nThe couple isn't thinking about Trading Spaces anytime soon: they've settled in nicely to their 100-year-old farmhouse in Traverse City, Michigan.\n\n12 of 20\n\nRenée Zellweger\n\nAfter living in her Connecticut farmhouse for nearly a decade, the Bridget Jones's Diary actress put the historical home on the market in 2014.\n\n13 of 20\n\nDean Unglert\n\nThe Bachelor in Paradise star currently lives out of his van. He told Entertainment Tonight of the decision, \"I'm just, like, trying to travel the country and see what happens. I live in a van now. I'm planning on [traveling] all across the continental U.S. and then maybe up into Canada as well.\"\n\nHe added, \"I've just always kind of had like a nomadic spirit in me, and I've always wanted to do it, and I was, like, no better time than now.\"\n\n14 of 20\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nThe singer sold his New York City and Los Angeles homes in 2012 and retreated to Montana, which he has called home since.\n\n15 of 20\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nRuffalo, his wife and three children live on a 50-acre plot of land in upstate New York, far from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood and Manhattan.\n\nRuffalo said of the real estate purchase, \"The whole guiding idea for living upstate was to simplify. We asked ourselves, what do we need all this s--- for? What is it adding to our lives?\"\n\n16 of 20\n\nJeff Daniels\n\nDaniels moved to Michigan with his family 32 years ago \"to create as much a sense of normalcy as possible.\" He said of the decision to relocate, \"It was a very dramatic move in 1986 to move to Michigan, but that was to keep the family number one. And that worked.\"\n\n18 of 20\n\nMichael Keaton\n\nHoly Toledo, Batman! Keaton owns a ranch in southern Montana, where he has spent much of his time in the past 28 years. Keaton once said in an interview, \"Once you see the west, there is no going back,\" and for him it may just be true.\n\n20 of 20\n\nSteve Martin\n\nThe comedian moved to Brevard, North Carolina, and started picking the banjo and writing bluegrass music. No, really. Martin lives in the small town, and frequently collaborates with the Steep Canyon Rangers."
