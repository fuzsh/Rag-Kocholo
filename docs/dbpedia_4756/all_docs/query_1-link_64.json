        "text": "It was the producer Ray Stark who initially asked Arthur Laurents to write something for me. Arthur told me that Ray was impressed with the huge success of The Sound of Music and The Miracle Worker and thought, Why not combine the two and have me teaching handicapped children in Brooklyn to sing? Arthur wasn’t enthusiastic about that idea, to say the least, but he came over to discuss it with me. I liked it even less, but as we were talking, the subject turned to politics. Arthur knew I was politically active, and as I was ranting about the state of the world, suddenly he was reminded of a very smart girl he knew in college who came from a lower-middle-class family and was president of the Young Communist League. Her name was Fanny Price…funny coincidence, or was it a sign? He said, “She was intense, passionate, and Jewish, like you.”\n\nArthur went home and wrote a treatment, and as soon as I read it, I thought, Holy mackerel! This is fantastic. I absolutely fell in love with the story. This girl, Katie Morosky, touched me profoundly. She was passionate about life and concerned about the world. I understood her completely. I knew why she fell in love with Hubbell Gardiner, the good-looking jock who was also a gifted writer.\n\nI read somewhere that David Lean said if you had five great scenes in a script, it could make a great movie. Well, there were definitely five in The Way We Were, so I called Ray, very excited, and said, “I love it!”\n\nI think Arthur was the one who suggested Sydney Pollack to direct. He told me that Sydney was an actor himself and had taught acting in New York at the Neighborhood Playhouse. I thought, Great…he’ll be sensitive to the actor’s process. I had seen his movies The Slender Thread and They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, which showed he could handle serious issues. So I encouraged Ray to hire him.\n\nAnd I had a particular actor in mind for Hubbell…Robert Redford…who happened to be good friends with Sydney, so everything seemed to be falling into place.\n\nMany people first noticed Bob in Barefoot in the Park, but that didn’t make much of an impression on me. It was a light comedy and he was perfectly passable. It was only when I watched him in This Property Is Condemned, which Sydney directed, that I saw there was a lot going on behind those crystal-blue eyes.\n\nI was drawn to him not because of his appearance…guys with blond hair and blue eyes were never my type. I did think he was very handsome…a wonderful jawline…great teeth. But what intrigued me most about Bob was his complexity. You never quite know what he’s thinking, and that makes him fascinating to watch onscreen. Like the greatest movie stars, Bob understands the power of restraint. You’re never going to get it all…and that’s the mystery…that’s what makes you want to keep looking at him.\n\nBob is that rare combination…an intellectual cowboy…a charismatic star who is also one of the finest actors of his generation. But like my husband, he’s almost apologetic about his looks, and I liked that about him.\n\nSo I wanted Redford for Hubbell. But he turned it down.\n\nSince Sydney and Bob were so close, my best hope was that Sydney could somehow persuade him. I have to give Sydney credit. He was as persistent as I was, because we both felt that only Redford would make the picture work. It’s like playing tennis…I knew my own game would go up when I was opposite a strong player.\n\nBut Bob was concerned that the script was so focused on Katie that Hubbell’s character was underdeveloped. (He was right.) Bob asked Sydney, “Who is this guy? He’s just an object…. He doesn’t want anything. What does this guy want?” In Bob’s opinion, he was “shallow and one-dimensional. Not very real.” “A pin-up girl in reverse,” as Sydney put it.\n\nI wanted Bob to be happy, so I told Sydney, “Give him anything he wants. Write more scenes to strengthen his character. Make it equal.” So Sydney hired two excellent writers, David Rayfiel and Alvin Sargent, to beef up Bob’s part and go deeper, beneath that golden-boy exterior. And I told Ray to pay him whatever he wanted.\n\nBut Bob’s answer was still no. I was heartbroken.\n\nRay was pressing us to move on and hire someone else. Apparently he thought any blond actor would do, and Ryan O’Neal was next on his list. Sydney kept begging for another week to work on Redford. I told Ray to give it to him and kept praying. The negotiations went down to the wire. I was in the middle of filming Up the Sandbox in Africa, and one day I got a telegram from Sue Mengers that simply said: “Barbra Redford!” That’s when I knew he’d finally said yes…and I was so thrilled! The courtship had been tough, but Bob’s reluctance had a big influence on the script and ultimately resulted in a richer, more interesting character.\n\nHubbell and Katie were different…very different. He was the fair-haired, taciturn WASP with no particular political bent and she was the dark-haired, outspoken Jewish girl with strong antiwar opinions. The script was built on the idea that opposites attract. And that was true.\n\nBob and I were genuinely curious about each other, and I believe that’s what comes across on the screen. Once he asked me about Brooklyn. What was it like growing up there? I guess he thought I was kind of exotic, but to me, he was the exotic one, growing up in sunny California. Did he surf? Fish? Swim in the ocean after eating?\n\nI knew he did other daredevil things, like skiing. To come down a mountain on two thin blades, very fast…that’s not one of the skills you acquire on the streets of Flatbush. But I would listen to him talk about where he had gone skiing over the weekend and his descriptions were so evocative…standing alone at the top of a mountain, surrounded by the beauty of the wilderness. It was a little scary but it sounded good, and I thought, Gosh, could I ever do that? He really inspired me to learn how to ski, not something I would normally do (you could break bones!).\n\nBob has always been kind of a loner, and that’s part of his charm. I’m not big on casual socializing either. This was a story about two people who were aware of each other but moved in different circles, and I think Bob and I made an instinctive decision not to spend too much time together at the beginning. We wanted the discovery process to happen onscreen.\n\nWe shot the movie in sequence, for the most part, which is a great gift to an actor. Then, by the time Katie and Hubbell were comfortable with each other, so were we. At one point, when we were filming scenes on the beach in Malibu, Bob appeared on his motorcycle and asked me if I wanted to take a ride. Now, I’m not the kind of girl who always dreamed of racing down the road on a bike, hair flying in the wind. (You get knots!) I got on behind him and held on to his waist for dear life. But oddly enough, once we got moving, I wasn’t scared at all. I felt perfectly safe with him.\n\nI had no idea where we were going. I remember that we went through a tunnel and then rode up into a canyon I never knew existed, to this mysterious place dense with old oak trees. We crossed over a stream and the air smelled of wild fennel. It felt as if we were way out in the country, far from civilization, very private.\n\nIt was great fun to work with Bob. He and I had a real rapport and the audience could sense it. It’s hard to explain why a certain combination of two actors works, but in one interview, Bob tried: “Barbra…her femininity brings out the masculinity in a man, and her masculinity brings out a man’s femininity, vulnerability, romanticism, whatever you want to call it.”\n\nNo wonder I liked him. He’s very perceptive.\n\nBefore I began to write this chapter, I watched the movie again for the first time since 1998. That’s when I got involved in a documentary about the making of the film…a special feature called “Looking Back” that was part of the 25th-anniversary DVD.\n\nSydney, Arthur, and I were each interviewed, and I was surprised to hear Sydney say that Bob and I worked very differently…that I wanted to rehearse a scene over and over while Bob just wanted to do it. I don’t remember it like that at all! I never like to rehearse too much. Often my best performance is the first take…it’s the most spontaneous…the most original…and the last thing you want is to lose that spontaneity with too many rehearsals.\n\nThe audience can tell when an actor is truly thinking, feeling, reacting. It’s impossible to fake an emotion when your face is in close-up on a screen 20 feet high. The camera sees right through to the truth. When you pay attention and really listen, that comes across…and in my opinion that’s the secret of great acting. Bob and I are both listeners, and we had to listen closely because neither of us ever knew exactly what the other was going to do. We played off each other in a wonderful way, because we both believed in the importance of being in the moment.\n\nYou can see that in a scene near the beginning of the film, when Katie spots Hubbell, seven years after they graduated from college, asleep on his stool at the bar in El Morocco. He’s a vision in his crisp white Navy uniform, and he takes her breath away. Bob had this shock of hair that fell over his forehead, and as we did the scene, it seemed perfectly natural for me to brush it back from his eyes. It wasn’t in the script…it was just something I felt like doing, in the moment. It was so intimate coming from me, Barbra, and yet totally right for Katie too. It’s probably something she’s wanted to do since their days in college, but never dared. Now he’s fast asleep on a bar stool, so what the hell?\n\nWhen I saw the way people reacted to it in dailies…everybody loved it…I decided I should find a few more times in the story where I could repeat it. (I’m always thinking of the piece as a whole.) It’s a physical gesture that brings us closer together…and it might mean something later on. It works kind of like a memorable melody in a great score. All of a sudden the music comes in and you don’t have to say anything. It’s Pavlovian. The feeling is there automatically.\n\nThat seems to be the gesture that everyone remembers. In fact, Katie Couric even asked me to do it to her, when I appeared on her talk show decades later. It just shows you how a spontaneous gesture, derived from the truth of the moment, can really resonate.\n\nWe started shooting in September 1972 at Union College in Schenectady, New York. I was 30 years old, Bob was 36, and we were supposed to be in our early 20s, but no one objected. If the story is strong and the actors are good, the audience suspends disbelief. For the first few weeks, a parasite I had contracted in Africa was still bothering me. I had a constant headache and found it hard to focus. Everything was hazy and surreal. I couldn’t keep food down. I was so skinny my legs looked like toothpicks.\n\nDavid Rayfiel had a house near the college and invited me to stay with him while we were shooting. But I said no, because I could sense his attraction to me and I didn’t want to get involved. I can’t deal with a new relationship and work at the same time. He was very attractive, six foot three with thick salt-and-pepper hair, a handsome face…a sweet man and a wonderful writer who sent me the most beautiful letters. But I backed away. Perhaps it was because he was too nice, and at that time I was not interested in people who were too fond of me. It was one of my problems…I was drawn to men I couldn’t have.\n\nLet me be clearer about that. I was still working out issues surrounding my stepfather…even though his name was Lou Kind, he was anything but. David, on the other hand, was really kind and thoughtful, so he didn’t fit my familiar pattern. And he was totally available, so he didn’t present enough of a challenge, I guess. Too bad…I adored David as a person (we remained friends for the rest of his life), and I didn’t want to hurt him. I’ll bet that was another reason why I was so queasy during that first month.\n\nBack to the movie. I really identified with Katie, and it was interesting how many pieces from my own closet also worked for her. That’s my vintage brown skirt and tortoiseshell necklace I’m wearing when Katie is giving a speech on campus promoting world peace. It was under threat in 1937 because of the Spanish Civil War. Katie is an idealist who is president of the Young Communist League (the YCL) at a time when many progressive thinkers were attracted by Communism’s support of workers’ rights and the utopian concept of a more equal society. Her skeptical classmates are heckling her. I often felt like an outcast growing up, so that seemed completely natural to me. And that’s my own vintage dusty-rose sweater I have on in the library, where I’m sneaking looks at Hubbell in between studying.\n\nOnce again, in this movie I’m the unconventional-looking woman in love with the handsome prince…Hubbell…star athlete, the big man on campus. Everything comes so easily to him, even writing…compared to Katie, who agonizes over her short story and is so hard on herself (like I can be). When Hubbell’s story gets chosen to be read aloud in class, she’s so devastated that she tears up her own and throws it in the trash.\n\nI needed to cry in that scene, but for some reason I couldn’t. So Sydney just took me aside and put his arms around me and that was all I needed…. I completely broke down.\n\nIt was so exciting to come to work every morning with actors and a director whom I respected. If you were stuck, Sydney could give you that little trigger. He spoke the actor’s language…or, with that simple touch, no words were necessary.\n\nWhen Katie runs into Hubbell at El Morocco, she hasn’t seen him since he cut in on Frank McVeigh, her colleague from the YCL, to dance with her at their senior prom.\n\nNow it’s 1944, the world is at war…he’s in the Navy, she’s working at a radio station. And Hubbell, who’s had too much to drink, is in no shape to go anywhere by himself, so she has to bring him home with her. While she’s making coffee, he falls asleep in her bed. Katie stares at him, quietly takes off her dress and her slip, and slides in to join him. She can’t quite believe she’s lying next to this man she’s had a crush on for so long. Delicately, she touches his hair, and he moves closer, kissing her neck, and then begins to make love to her, automatically, because he’s basically asleep.\n\nYou may think this is the kind of scene that comes naturally. You don’t have to act. Just be in the moment….\n\nBut in fact it’s always difficult for me. I’m a very private person, and it’s hard to be intimate when other people are watching. It’s awkward and scary, and in this case, my own emotions blended into Katie’s. I’m thinking, She doesn’t want him to stop, but she’s almost afraid to react. Would that break the spell? And then she’s experiencing all the usual doubts…. Will she disappoint him? Will he disappoint her?\n\nBecause if he wakes up, then what?\n\nAll these emotions are playing across her face. But at the end, her fleeting smile dissolves when she says, “Hubbell…it’s Katie. You did know it was Katie?” And a tear falls from her eye.\n\nHubbell doesn’t remember a thing the next morning…or at least pretends not to. Bob is great in that scene. All he wants to do is get out of there gracefully. He doesn’t even stay to eat the breakfast Katie has prepared for him. But when he comes back to town and calls to take her up on her offer of a place to sleep, Katie uses all her ration stamps to buy food for him. (Well, she’s Jewish!)\n\nShe’s coming home laden with groceries and catches him just as he’s leaving, blurting out, “I’ve got steaks and baked potatoes and sour cream and chives and salad and fresh-baked pie. I would have made a pot roast. I make a terrific pot roast, but I didn’t know whether you’d ever had pot roast or whether you liked pot roast. I mean, anyway there wasn’t time because it should be made the day before…. You’ve got to stay for supper, that’s all there is to it!”\n\nRedford says, “What kind of pie?” with the emphasis on “pie.” I thought maybe the emphasis should be on “kind”…i.e., if it’s the right kind of pie, he’ll stay. I thought it would be funnier and more charming if Hubbell were more amused by her. And that prompted me to ask Bob, “Would you ever let me direct you?”\n\n“Yeah, I would,” he said, which really pleased me and represented a big leap of faith on his part, because I hadn’t directed anything at this point.\n\nHubbell does stay for supper, just because Katie has guilted him into it. It’s only when she pulls out his novel after the meal and tells him honestly what she thinks of it that he’s truly intrigued.\n\nKatie believes in him, but she’s also unafraid to tell him where his book falls short, and that’s the real beginning of their romance. People often fall in love with their teacher…mentors…someone who cares enough to push them to be their best.\n\nThere’s a beautiful sequence where he’s looking at her as if seeing her for the first time, they’re touching each other, and then they make love in front of the fire. In Arthur’s original script, Hubbell leans over her and says, “It’ll be better this time.”\n\nSo he did remember that they had made love that first night! But the line was cut. I’m not sure why. Perhaps Sydney thought it made Hubbell less likable…but to me it was so much more interesting if Hubbell acknowledged his earlier behavior, and subtly apologized for it.\n\nI thought Sydney’s staging of the breakup scene at the radio station was so smart, with Katie and Hubbell initially separated by the glass wall of the booth. Hubbell says, “Look, Katie—” and she interrupts him, “Oh, God. Please don’t start a sentence with ‘Look.’ It’s always bad news.” He tells her their relationship isn’t working, and she thinks she knows why. “I don’t fit on Beekman Place. That’s what’s really wrong.” She doesn’t want Hubbell to see her cry so she turns her back on him for a moment, until she can compose herself. But he puts down her key and walks out.\n\nIn the next scene, Sydney had me calmly taking Hubbell’s jacket out of the closet and neatly folding it into a suitcase. Then I carefully gather up his manuscript pages and close his typewriter case, tilting my head back to try to hold in the tears.\n\nI remember that day very clearly. My first instinct as an actress (and as a woman) was that Katie would be angry. As I know from experience, when you’re profoundly hurt, you often react with anger to cover up the pain. I would have liked to try having her grab his clothes out of the closet and throw them in the suitcase, pull his shaving cream out of the medicine cabinet and dump it in the wastebasket, rip his page out of the typewriter and slam the case shut.\n\nBut Sydney saw it differently. He wanted me to be sad and teary, so that’s what I did. Looking at the scene again, Sydney’s way definitely works, especially once it was underscored with Marvin Hamlisch’s beautiful music. But I was also thinking of the film as a whole, and worried about having three scenes in a row with tears…since in the next scene, where Katie calls Hubbell on the phone, she can’t stop crying. That’s another reason why I felt some anger would have been a better lead-in to that scene.\n\nKatie dials the phone, and the first thing she says when Hubbell answers is, “It’s me.” The tears started immediately. I put my hand over my face and ad-libbed something: “Hubbell…. Wait a minute. Hold on a minute. Don’t go away,” while I pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket. I must have asked them to give me a handkerchief, because I knew this scene was going to make me cry. I just didn’t know where or when.\n\n“Listen, Hubbell. This is kind of peculiar. I know that I don’t have to apologize for what I said, because I know that you know…anyway the peculiar thing is, it’s really a request, a favor. See, I can’t sleep, Hubbell, and it would help me so much if you could, well, if I had someone to talk to. You know, if I had a best friend or something to talk about it with. Only you’re my best friend. Isn’t that dumb? It’s so dumb!” (I heard my voice going up an octave.) “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.”\n\nI love that idea. He’s her best friend, and she has nobody else she can talk to about him, except him. That felt so true.\n\n“And it would help me so much if you could just come over and see me through tonight. Listen, Hubbell, I promise I won’t touch you or beg you or embarrass you. But I’ve got to talk to my best friend about someone we both know.”\n\nWe did two takes of the scene. On the first, I was oblivious to the camera. I wasn’t in control of my voice or my tears, and I certainly wasn’t paying any attention to the mechanics of the shot. But on the second, I remember thinking, Why is the camera staying so far away during this long speech?\n\nI’ve always been able to feel the camera as it’s moving in, and the closer it comes, the less I do…just instinctively. But that didn’t happen here, so I just kept sobbing.\n\nAnd now, all I can think is, Why do I keep holding that handkerchief in front of my face? I was probably self-conscious about my nose running.\n\nThis is painful to watch. I can’t believe how long my hand is in front of my face. You can’t see the eyes. You can hear the emotion but you can’t see it. Don’t get me wrong. Sometimes that’s great…but not here.\n\nThis is where I needed Sydney to say, “Barbra, I want you to try it without the handkerchief this time. Or pick it up but then put it down. I don’t care if your nose runs!”\n\nIn his memoir, Arthur says, “How I wished I could have directed her in that phone call! There was no reason for her to hide her face; Barbra Streisand understood rejection. What she needed was help from someone who understood her.”\n\nArthur blamed Sydney and said, “It was never reshot and—if done properly—it would have won her the Academy Award.”\n\nI didn’t want to believe that.\n\nBut now that I’m looking at my performance here, I’m thinking, It’s not good enough. I was so eager to do this scene that I couldn’t help myself…all the emotion just overflowed. I should have put that handkerchief down…and I should have done less. To see Katie trying to control her emotions would have been more heartbreaking. Again, it’s the restraint that moves you.\n\nI wish I could do it over.\n\nSydney was an actor himself. He understood how important this moment could be. If only he had slowed me down, done a few more takes to give me the time to calm down a bit…asked me to try it a different way.\n\nThis is difficult to write about. I adored Sydney. We used to tell each other secrets. Mine went with him to the grave, and I would never tell his. And I trusted him to do what was best for the film. But I think he felt responsible for persuading Redford to do the movie even though I had the more showy part, and perhaps subconsciously he was trying to redress the balance by paying less attention to some of Katie’s most important scenes. I just assumed Sydney would protect me as an actress. But maybe he was more protective of Redford. I never realized it until watching the movie now.\n\nArthur, in his own memoir, recounted what he said to Sydney: “You’re going to build up Redford’s part because…he’s the blond goy you wish you were. The picture is Barbra’s no matter what you do because the story is hers. Be careful you don’t destroy it trying to give it to him.”\n\nArthur could be very cruel, and I think he’s too harsh on Sydney. For me, the story became more compelling when Katie and Hubbell were more evenly matched. That’s how we know they’re meant for each other. And that’s what makes it so moving when Hubbell does come to see her after the call, and she asks why they can’t be together.\n\nHe says, “Because you push too hard. Every damn minute! There’s no time ever to just relax and enjoy living.”\n\nHe’s right. Katie does push too hard, encouraging him to finish his book…but only because she believes in him so deeply. And that’s what finally wins him over.\n\n“Katie, you expect so much.”\n\n“Oh, but look what I’ve got.”\n\nIn the next scene, they’re on a sailboat, with the Malibu coastline in the background. Then we see Katie setting a bride-and-groom cake topper on a shelf in their beach house. So we know they’re married and they’ve moved to LA, and it’s all done without words, in a few shots. (Nice work, Sydney.)\n\nBob loved to tease me, just as Hubbell teases Katie. I think the most fun we had was shooting the party scene where everybody is dressed up as a Marx Brother. I was Harpo, Bob was Groucho…and the real Groucho Marx even stopped by the set to visit. (His costume was definitely the best.) When Katie’s about to start a fight with the director who’s making a movie of Hubbell’s book, Bob clapped his hand over my mouth. Of all the ways in my life that people have tried to shut me up, that was by far the funniest.\n\nBut for me, the most interesting moments to play were when the story suddenly turned from light to serious on a dime. There’s a scene where Katie is cooking, dreaming about moving to France so Hubbell can finish his novel there. He quickly changes the subject to ask about her job (she summarizes books for the movie studio). Katie describes a phony synopsis she wrote, just to entertain herself: “You see, there’s this kibbutz of Chinese Jews living in a rice paddy…and she cooks Communist rice patties.” They laugh, and then she says she’s got another one for him. “Loudmouth Jewish girl from New York City comes to Malibu, California, and tells her gorgeous goyishe guy that she’s pregnant.”\n\nBob’s reaction is perfect. Hubbell is speechless for a moment, and then embraces her…gently. He’s so happy. The fact that they’re going to have a baby brings them closer. On another evening at the director’s house, we see them slow dancing all by themselves. (That’s so much sexier to me than something more obvious, like a kiss.) Then the movie turns on a dime again, when the director finds a wire behind a Picasso painting, and all the guests are shocked to realize their conversation is being taped.\n\nArthur was dealing with a subject that few filmmakers were willing to touch…the way the government, afraid of Communism, focused on Hollywood in 1947 and summoned various directors, writers, actors, and producers to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Most people, when they were questioned about supposed “subversives,” named names. But the “Hollywood Ten” refused to answer, and for their integrity, they were blacklisted, which meant they could no longer work. Careers were cut short; lives were ruined.\n\nArthur was blacklisted himself, so this story was very personal to him. Unfortunately, a lot of that story didn’t make the final cut.\n\nKatie plans to travel to Washington in support of the Hollywood Ten, even though Hubbell doesn’t want her to go. He’s angry. He pours a drink and says, “We’re kind of back where we started, aren’t we?”\n\n“That’s not true, Hubbell,” she replies.\n\nOriginally, there was more to Katie’s speech. She went on to say, “In college, I stood under a maple tree selling Loyalist Spain. And you wouldn’t let Jews into your fraternity house. Now you’ve married one, and she’s going to have your baby. We live on the beach in Malibu, California, and that is not where we started.”\n\nIt was a subtle indictment of prejudice and a confirmation of their own bond. But it was cut, and the rest of the sequence, where she explains why she can’t sit back while their friends are in jeopardy, is also missing. Katie is a political animal. Hubbell is not. Politics…and the conflict it caused…is glossed over with that cut.\n\nArthur could telegraph a lifetime of emotion in a few words. Not that everything he wrote was perfect. When I heard about early versions of the story…where Hubbell has an affair with the director’s wife, the director comes on to Katie, Katie comes on to a tennis pro…I thought all that was ridiculous. It diluted the central romance and made Hubbell very unappealing, which doesn’t work in a love story because you need the audience to be rooting for both people.\n\nBut the essence of Arthur’s story was amazing, and that’s what I kept fighting for through all the many rewrites he did and the various fixes made by other writers. The fact is, Sydney didn’t like Arthur…that’s why he brought in his own writers…and Arthur didn’t like Sydney. So I acted as the intermediary. I’d call Sydney at night to talk about a scene, and read him some lines from an earlier version, hoping to reinstate Arthur’s words.\n\nSometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t, because Sydney had his own vision. And I thought some of the choices he made in the edit were very good. He cut the scene where Katie sees Hubbell go off with his old college girlfriend, and instead lets the audience know that she knows much more subtly, in the projection room scene. After watching his not-so-good movie, everyone skips out except Katie and Hubbell. He mocks a comment from one of their friends, and when Katie defends her, he says, “Katie, the day you die you’ll still be a nice Jewish girl.”\n\n“Are you still a nice gentile boy?” she asks, taking the conversation in a whole new direction.\n\n“I never was,” he replies, and continues, “Katie, what’s wrong with us has nothing to do with another girl. Oh, give up. Please.”\n\n“I can’t. I hate what you did to your book.” (That’s more upsetting to her than a one-night stand, which disturbs her but would never break them up.) “I hate the picture. I hate those people. I hate the palm trees. I wish it would rain. Oh, I want…I want…”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I want us to love each other.”\n\nArthur had written one more line to that scene. Hubbell says, “We do. That’s the trouble, Katie. We do.”\n\nI have no idea why Sydney cut that line. Maybe he was trying to avoid complexities. Me, I look for them.\n\nBut now, to the most devastating loss. It never even occurred to me that Sydney would take out two major scenes…the crux of the film, in my opinion…two of the five great scenes that I loved in Arthur’s treatment.\n\nThe first takes place after the scene in the projection room. It’s another day, Katie is on her way home with groceries, and as she’s driving through the UCLA campus, she sees a girl making a speech. A small crowd is gathering, and she pulls up and stops the car to listen. The girl is telling the students that they must support members of the faculty who refuse to take a loyalty oath. She says, “The witch-hunters have already begun to blacklist our teachers, to put informers in our classrooms, our laboratories.”\n\nI remember shooting this scene as though it were yesterday…a scene that I thought was the very definition of the title, The Way We Were. I liked the way Sydney had set up the camera to capture my reactions in one shot. What hit me first, as Katie, was how much this student reminded me of my younger self in college, speaking out about the Spanish Civil War. I’m smiling…my God, did I look like that? Did I sound like that? Were my clothes equally pathetic? But then the camera moves in gradually as my emotions turn. The girl is earnest and sincere, and she’s getting heckled by the crowd, as Katie had been. I knew exactly what she was going through, and my eyes welled up with tears.\n\nI’m thinking, What has become of me? Where is that girl I once was…trying to save the world…ready to fight injustice? And now I’ve sold my soul, spending my time writing synopses of stupid books. By the end of the push-in, I’m sobbing.\n\nI did it in one take, because the situation was so right. I could already imagine the finished scene in the movie…. Marvin’s beautiful theme would start playing under the girl’s voice, and the snide comments from the crowd. And Katie’s reaction would have even more impact because it would happen in a single shot.\n\nI couldn’t wait to see the dailies, because I thought it had gone so well. Since I didn’t work the next day, they arranged a screening for me and I was sitting by myself when that scene came up. There was the picture, but there was no sound. What happened?\n\nIt turned out that the sound man had asked Sydney, “Does she have any lines?” Sydney said no, so the guy went on to the next location. This meant I would have to loop the crying…to somehow re-create the emotion in a recording booth. Why didn’t Sydney keep the sound man? It probably was an honest mistake, but still…this was an important scene.\n\nMuch later, when Sydney came to my house to show me the rough cut of the movie, I was dumbfounded by the way this scene had been edited. It went from the shot of me driving up, to a small crowd gathering around this girl, then cut to me smiling at her. Then it cut to a closer shot of the girl, then back to me crying. You can’t do that! Where’s the transition? Sydney said the push-in was too long, but I timed it and it was just a few seconds.\n\nNow it looked like two totally different takes, and the switch was not believable. He cut out the few frames in between…cut out how one emotion turned into another…and diminished the impact of what she was going through.\n\nAnd then in the final film, Sydney ended up cutting out the scene entirely. I was stunned. Here was a moment that shook Katie to her very core. It made her stop and think about her past and reassess her future. This was her epiphany. It was such a crucial scene, and the whole sequence was less than a minute.\n\nI was so disappointed.\n\nI missed this scene so much because it worked not just emotionally, but also structurally. After their blowup in the projection room, I felt that Katie and Hubbell needed time away from each other. Arthur had written the scene for Katie at UCLA, and Alvin and David added a good scene for Hubbell on a boat to balance that. He’s with his best friend, J.J., and they’re playing their favorite game, reminiscing about the past, and J.J. asks, “Best year?”\n\nHubbell answers, “Best year…1944…no, 1945…’46.” He’s thinking back to the time when he and Katie were first together. It’s a subtle way to indicate that he still loves her and it was so right, to have them both remembering the way they were.\n\nThen in the next scene, Katie and Hubbell come together in their Malibu living room, about to eat dinner. This is the second scene that I couldn’t believe was cut from the film.\n\nHubbell stands there fiddling with a corkscrew when he suddenly asks, “Who is Frank McVeigh?”\n\nKatie is surprised. “Frank McVeigh? Old Frankie…. We went to college with him…at least I did. We were in the YCL together. Why?”\n\n“He informed on you.”\n\n“He what?” She sits down, stunned. “The little rat. It’s so crazy. He was my date at the senior prom and you cut in for 10 seconds. I guess it was obvious I liked you better than him. What could he tell them anyway? I mean I left the Party during the war, for God’s sake.”\n\nFrankie had been jealous of Katie’s attraction to Hubbell all those years ago, and now he finally got even. It’s so human…it’s often something petty that prompts people to do terrible things.\n\nThe next lines Arthur wrote were never filmed. Katie asks Hubbell what the committee could possibly accuse her of having done.\n\n“They say you tried to get the studio to make a subversive film.”\n\n“I what?”\n\n“You recommended a book which they claim was outright propaganda for Communist China.”\n\nAnd then she starts to laugh, because she realizes he’s talking about her phony synopsis about the Chinese kibbutz and the Communist rice patties! (I tried to get those lines back in, but Sydney said no one would believe it…that it was too ridiculous.)\n\nArthur always said that the climax of the picture was when the love story and the political story came together…and this is the scene where it happened. In 1947, as far as the studio was concerned, Katie was subversive. And if Hubbell, who was employed by the studio, had a subversive wife, that was grounds to fire him.\n\nFrankie’s betrayal means that Katie will be called before the committee and expected to name names.\n\nKatie says, “Hubbell, there is no justification for informing, none! And there’s something very wrong with any country that makes for informers.”\n\n“Christ, is that what you think I want you to do?” he answers. What a great line. This is where we see Hubbell’s strength of character and his love and support for Katie.\n\n“I don’t know…. All I know is that if I don’t name names, you can’t get a job in this town!”\n\n“Okay,” he says. “Then I’ll have to finish my book.” So he’s not going to ask her to compromise her values. He brings over their plates and says, “Let’s eat.”\n\nKatie sits down on the sofa, stares off into the distance, and says, “It’s amazing how decisions are forced on you, willy-nilly.”\n\nShe looks at Hubbell. “You never did want to finish your book, did you?”\n\n“I don’t know. I guess I never really thought there was much point.”\n\n“And you never really wanted to go to France, did you?”\n\n“No, I didn’t. You wanted me to.”\n\nAnd now we see her strength of character, because she’s willing to sacrifice what means the most to her…her marriage…in order to save him. She says, “If we got a divorce, you wouldn’t have a subversive wife…and that would solve everything, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“No,” Hubbell answers. “No, it wouldn’t.”\n\nBut Katie has already decided, and she knows it’s the only decision…the proper decision…because she is not going to name names, and she does not want him to be punished for her beliefs. They have come to a crossroads, and she finds herself reminiscing. “Wouldn’t it be lovely if we were old? We’d have survived all this. And everything would be easy and uncomplicated, the way it was when we were young.”\n\n“Katie, it was never uncomplicated.”\n\n“But it was lovely, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Yes. It was lovely,” he says.\n\nWhich leads to that heartbreaking line, “Will you do me one favor, Hubbell? Will you stay with me till the baby’s born?”\n\nIt’s precisely because she loves him deeply that she makes the decision to let him go. And it’s also about being true to herself. She can’t stay in Hollywood. But she knows that Hubbell, to the contrary, belongs there. And there’s a whole other layer to her decision as she suddenly confronts a truth about their relationship…she’s been pushing him all these years to be something he doesn’t want to be…to live somewhere he doesn’t want to live…to write something he doesn’t want to write.\n\nShe’s been assuming that Hubbell shares her vision of him, but the reality is he’s afraid he can’t live up to it. As he said to her back in New York when they first broke up, “You expect so much.” That’s been a huge pressure on him, and she finally hears what he’s been saying all along, and now she understands. So she releases him, and there’s strength and love and generosity in her response, because it’s incredibly painful to her.\n\nAlmost none of this is left in the film.\n\nWhat we see instead is Hubbell setting down their plates on a table as the scene begins with Katie’s line, “It’s amazing how decisions are forced on you, willy-nilly.”\n\nWhat decision? The line makes no sense. We have no idea what she’s talking about because the Frankie McVeigh scene has been cut…and it’s the climax of the story. The fact that Katie has been informed on is the catalyst for everything that happens next. Without that scene and the UCLA scene, the plot is eviscerated and we’ve lost the essence of her character, as well as his…because Hubbell’s lines show he was prepared to stand by her.\n\nWithout those two crucial scenes, there’s nothing about her feeling that she has lost her sense of self in Hollywood…nothing about being informed on…nothing about what actually forced her decision. All of that is gone. So now you think they split up simply because he schtupped this other girl one time.\n\nYou can hear Sydney on the documentary, describing how they previewed the picture on a Friday night in San Francisco and it was a flop. Then he says that he took out “about five scenes, and they were all politics,” and on Saturday night the picture was a hit. (By the way, my manager, Marty Erlichman, was there and he says the picture played great on both nights.)\n\nI agreed with Sydney on three of those scenes. They involved subsidiary characters having political discussions that went on so long even I lost interest.\n\nYes, right, cut those extraneous scenes (about 15 minutes)…no great loss…but don’t cut the two scenes that were pivotal to the plot. Don’t cut the crucial three and a half minutes that the whole film revolves around.\n\nIt was such a betrayal of Arthur’s story. It destroyed the soul of Katie’s character…and destroyed me.\n\nI was so upset back in 1973 that I asked if I could have the deleted scenes, and I’ve kept those trims in my vault (along with outtakes from my recordings, TV specials, and certain films). Then in 1998, when we were doing the DVD for the 25th anniversary, I asked Sydney if I could show those deleted scenes in the documentary. He could easily have said no, but instead he very generously said, “Okay,” because he understood how passionate I was about this movie. That was Sydney being a real friend.\n\nIn the documentary, both Arthur and I talk about how those cuts eliminated vital information. Sydney admits, “I don’t say to this day that I’m right.” The fact is, Ray Stark and the studio were pushing him to take out the politics because they thought it would bore people. As Sydney explained to one journalist, “We were getting so much pressure. Columbia was going under at the time; they hadn’t had a big hit in years, and the picture was going over budget. Bob didn’t get along with Ray Stark, and neither did I. We didn’t know how to mix the politics and the love story and make it work.”\n\nRay was nervous. Arthur writes in his book that Ray told Sydney to make those cuts after the first San Francisco preview. So Sydney and Margaret Booth, Ray’s favorite editor…a tough woman from another era…went up into the projection booth with a razor blade and cut the film hastily, in one chunk. And in my humble opinion, they threw out the baby with the bathwater.\n\nI took my pleas to Ray, which was useless.\n\nI felt absolutely powerless. My mind just flashed back to that moment as a young girl, standing in my mother’s bedroom doorway and being ignored. Once again, I felt unseen and unheard. I begged Sydney to put those two scenes back in. But he didn’t.\n\nThis was the moment when I thought, That’s it. I had always had creative control of my albums, my TV specials, and my concerts. Now I realized, I have to be more in control of my films as well. I have to direct.\n\nOf course, it’s hard to argue with success. The movie became a huge hit…and Columbia’s second-highest-grossing film up till then (they told me the highest was Funny Girl). The Way We Were was nominated for six Academy Awards, but I thought there was something odd when I saw the list. No nomination for best picture. Sydney wasn’t nominated as best director. Arthur wasn’t nominated for his screenplay.\n\nMaybe the reason the movie missed out on the big awards was because people sensed something was missing and didn’t understand why Katie and Hubbell broke up. Several critics pointed out gaps in the storyline. Roger Ebert said, “Inexplicably, the movie suddenly and implausibly has them fall out of love—and they split up without resolving anything, particularly the plot.”\n\nI was honored to be nominated for best actress, but I was very disappointed that Bob wasn’t nominated for best actor for our movie, because he was amazing in it. (He did get nominated for The Sting.) At least “The Way We Were” was up for best original song, and the Academy asked me to sing it on the broadcast, but I was reluctant…my stage fright again. When I get nervous, my heart pounds and it affects my voice, which starts to shake and I lose control. It’s a terrible feeling and I didn’t want to go through that. So they asked Peggy Lee to do it, which was fine with me. (Besides, I wanted to be thought of as an actress first, not a singer.) But in retrospect, I wish I had been stronger and sung the song.\n\nAnd now, in reliving this time in my life, I realize that my emotions were more conflicted than I could even admit to myself back then. And that’s probably why I didn’t want to go to the ceremony. I felt embarrassed that crucial parts of the performance were not even in the movie. I just couldn’t bear the thought of sitting in that auditorium and having to smile for the cameras and pretend everything was great. So I hid backstage.\n\nFrankly, I was relieved when they didn’t call my name. The winner was Glenda Jackson for A Touch of Class, but she wasn’t in the audience either (so at least I wasn’t the only one).\n\nThe only people from our movie who went home with Oscars that night were Marvin for the score and the music for the song, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman for the lyrics. I know the song contributed enormously to the movie’s success, yet Sydney told me that Redford didn’t want me to sing at all. Bob confirmed this on Oprah in 2010, when he surprised me by showing up to reminisce. Maybe he didn’t realize how seamlessly Sydney and Marvin would integrate the song into the movie, to the extent that they’re irrevocably linked to this day.\n\nLike the film, the song was a huge hit. In addition to the Oscar, it won the Golden Globe Award for best original song and the Grammy Award for song of the year.\n\nAnd the way Marvin used it in the last scene was particularly moving. Sydney and I flew back together to New York to shoot it, and it was time well spent, because I managed to convince him to put back more of Arthur’s words. The scene starts with a shot of the iconic Plaza Hotel. Then we see Katie walking toward it. She spots Hubbell at the entrance. He spots her, and does a double take (it’s very hard to do a good double take, and Bob’s was great). He smiles. She smiles, and crosses the street to talk to him. Music is playing beneath all this. They hug and kiss in a long shot. He’s with another woman and introductions are made. We can’t hear the dialogue but we can see how friendly they are through their body language.\n\nNow the camera is closer. He asks her if she’s still married (so clearly she’s moved on too), and Katie asks him what he’s doing in New York. He tells her that he’s been writing a television show. Then the doorman says his taxi’s ready. Katie says she’s late, and invites him to come for a drink as she runs back across the street to pick up a stack of “Ban the Bomb” leaflets (she’s back doing what she loves). Suddenly she hears Hubbell, alone this time, saying, “You never give up, do you?” I love that echo, from the scene in the projection room.\n\n“Only when I’m absolutely forced to,” Katie responds. “But I’m a very good loser.”\n\n“Better than I am.” Very good line. It says everything…without saying it.\n\n“Well, I’ve had more practice.” Then she says, “Your girl is lovely, Hubbell. Why don’t you bring her for a drink when you come?”\n\n“I can’t…I can’t.”\n\nKatie, sensitive as always, says, “I know.”\n\nAnd that’s when I reached out and brushed his hair off his forehead. And he clasps my hand as we come together in an embrace. We held on to each other for that extra minute or two, remembering the way we were, before we let each other go.\n\nI knew from the moment I first did that gesture in the nightclub that it would really resonate at the very end of the movie. And when I touch his hair, the music starts again, underscoring the emotion and reminding you of everything that has happened since they met.\n\n“How is she?” he asks. He hasn’t seen their daughter since she was born. (I always imagined Katie would send him pictures of her on her birthday.)\n\n“She is just beautiful. You would be so proud of her, Hubbell.”\n\n“I’m glad. Is he a good father?”\n\n“Yes, very.”\n\n“Good.” He looks down and takes a leaflet. Then the music swells as they look at each other one last time. He says, “See ya, Katie,” and walks across the street and out of her life again.\n\n“See ya, Hubbell,” she says softly.\n\nThat’s another poignant echo, from their goodbye after that first night at her apartment. And then as the film cuts to a long shot, leaving Katie standing on the street and handing out her leaflets, you hear my voice singing the song over the credits. By now, the audience is usually sobbing. But at the first screening, people didn’t cry…and Marvin instantly knew why. He had scored the ending with a different melody, worried he might have overused the theme. “Big mistake,” he said, and went into his own pocket to get the orchestra to re-record the ending with the familiar music. And I can’t imagine the movie without it.\n\nIt’s very gratifying to read that The Way We Were is now considered a classic. The American Film Institute named it number six on their list of the 100 greatest love stories, putting it right up there with Gone With the Wind and Casablanca. I, too, love The Way We Were and consider it a highlight of my career. I think it’s one of Bob’s best performances…and probably one of mine as well…and I’m thrilled whenever I see us listed as one of the screen’s most romantic couples. We made something that will last a long time…much longer than most real marriages.\n\nSo I did something I’ve been aching to do since 1973. I still had all the trims saved, and I hired Mike Arick, the same editor who had worked with me on the first DVD, to sit beside me at my Avid editing machine and put them back into the film. I felt such a sense of purpose and responsibility…as if I were fulfilling a commitment to Arthur, and to Hubbell and Katie. I also wanted to retrieve some of her speech explaining why she had to go to Washington to support their friends, because it shows her political fearlessness. And it was important to me to put back that last, very revealing line at the end of the projection room scene, when Katie says, “I want us to love each other,” and Hubbell responds, “We do. That’s the trouble, Katie. We do.”\n\nI realize now why Sydney had to cut that line…. It contradicted his premise that their relationship was over. As he said in the documentary, “This story reaches a point where you know these two people are finished, and it’s at the end of the projection room [scene].”\n\nI didn’t agree, and that’s not what Arthur wrote. Katie loves Hubbell and isn’t the type to leave him over a one-night stand with an old girlfriend. And that line confirms that Hubbell still loves Katie. It was there from Arthur’s first script, and one of the reasons I like it is because it’s so true…love is complicated. I guess Sydney tried to simplify it because he couldn’t have them both declaring their love at the moment they’re supposedly “finished.”\n\nBut we’re rooting for this couple to stay together. And the only reason they don’t is because Katie has been informed on, and she decides to end the relationship to protect him. This is what brings the audience to tears. Imagine how excruciating it is to love someone and be forced to deny yourself that love.\n\nThere were other moments I would have included, like a scene where she’s encouraging him to stay at the typewriter and keep writing, but I knew if I tried to restore too much, I risked losing the chance to restore anything at all. I could only add a few minutes. So I had to prioritize and focus on what was most important to the story. And the original footage fit right in, because it was supposed to be there. It was bashert. Meant to be.\n\nA few weeks later I rushed the re-edited version of the movie over to Tom Rothman, because we had a phone appointment that day. He hadn’t had a chance to watch it when we spoke, but his first reaction was not promising. He basically said, “You can’t change the movie. It has to be the way Sydney left it.”\n\n“I’m not trying to replace the original film,” I told him. “It’s a classic, and it will live forever. All I want is to give people the option of watching the extended version as well. Release both versions in one package.”\n\nI explained that for years after the movie’s release, Sydney was still not sure about those cuts. But Tom wanted to hear that in Sydney’s own words, so I followed up that call with an eight-page letter, citing production memos where Sydney says the UCLA scene is “very good.” And the Frankie McVeigh scene was important because, as he wrote, “We must see the price that both this relationship and life in general costs these two people.”\n\nIt was sad for me to see how Sydney continued to question his work on the movie. As he said in one interview, “I think it is a picture that is severely flawed. And it is saved, really, by the two performances.” (I think he’s being too modest.) As he said in another interview, “The pressure I was getting was just unbelievable…. Truthfully, nobody had any faith in the picture.”\n\nNow, having directed a few films myself, I completely understand that pressure. Also, the blacklist went on into the early ’60s, which was not that far away in 1973. Many people in Hollywood did not want to be reminded of their participation…or offend the Republicans in power in Washington. Richard Nixon was president, and he had been very active in the HUAC. As Sydney said in another interview, “There was resistance from the studio…. As a result, we had to emasculate the picture…it did not successfully blend politics and love story to the extent it should have, or could have.”\n\nWe sent Rothman the letter in mid-July, and then I waited, and waited. As the summer wore on with no response, there was one person I really wanted to talk to…Robert Redford. I wanted to explain what I was doing and see how he felt about it. So I called him up, and Bob was wonderful…open and thoughtful and engaging, as always. He said he would support me “absolutely,” which meant so much to me. We talked for over an hour about everything, from working together on the film to politics and art.\n\nWhen we were hanging up, he said, “I gotta go, Babs. I love you dearly, and I always will.”\n\nI said, “I love you too,” and invited him and his wife, Sibylle, to come have dinner with Jim and me the next time they were in LA. I told him, “I love talking to you,” and he said, “I love talking to you. I always do.” It was a sweet reminder that the connection we had during that movie still exists.\n\nBob’s vote of confidence made me even more determined to persuade Sony to let me put back those pivotal scenes. In August, I sent Tom an email, gently nudging him by mentioning more reasons to support my case. He replied that it was a complicated situation and would take more time to resolve because he and others were on vacation.\n\nOkay. But I sent another email to thank him for his reply…and made another pitch. In other words, I was relentless.\n\nAnd thank God, Tom finally relented! In mid-September he called to tell me that the extended cut would be going into the new Blu-ray, as well as the original.\n\nI was speechless for a moment. Hallelujah! I had been hoping for this since 1973! And then in the midst of expressing my gratitude and telling him how much this means to me, I said, “Oh…one more thing…while we’re at it, could you also do an iTunes release like we did for A Star Is Born, where both the original cut and my recut version [with added scenes] are available for the same price?”\n\nThere was silence at his end. But I quickly went on to say, “Young people don’t even buy Blu-rays anymore. They stream everything, and that’s a whole new audience for the film.”\n\nI was encouraged because he didn’t say no right away, but as he reminded me, “Nor did I say yes.” It wasn’t until four months later that I was told he had approved the joint iTunes release.\n\nI can’t tell you how happy I am that people are now going to be able to see this film the way it was originally conceived. It’s only taken 50 years, but my dream has finally come true!\n\nAs Hubbell said to Katie, “You never give up, do you?”\n\nNo…. Katie never did, and neither do I.\n\nAdapted from the book My Name Is Barbra by Barbra Streisand, to be published November 7, 2023, by Viking.
