        "text": "Sydney Pollack told biographers Zec and Fowles that “we scheduled two previews, one on a Friday night and one on a Saturday night. At the first the film was going very, very well until we hit a spot in the third act where we just lost the audience completely … you know these two characters are finished. And it's at the end of the projection room [scene].” Pollack and the editors made several major cuts. “When we cut this piece out and previewed it the next night the audience absolutely loved the picture.”\n\nBut screenwriter Arthur Laurents disagreed and said, “the climax is missing ... the audience doesn't care.”\n\n“There weren't many movies made about this period of time in the blacklist,” Streisand said, “and that's why it killed me to have those scenes taken out. I was really heartbroken.”\n\nBelow, the cut and trimmed scenes from The Way We Were are detailed in the order they appeared in the film (this is based on an August 14, 1972 screenplay draft). It should be noted that after filming is completed and the director and editor look at the shots, sometimes scenes are cut out because they are redundant, or because they don’t advance the story – or, in some cases, they confuse the story. So, the scenes described on this page may have been trimmed simply for pace; or, as Laurents and Streisand have mentioned, they were lost at the expense of clarity, story and character motivation.\n\n[NOTE: The script descriptions are labeled INT. and EXT., which stands for “Interior” and ”Exterior.”]\n\nSydney Pollack, in the bonus feature on the DVD, explained that the preview audience literally got up and left the theater to get popcorn after the projection room scene in which it was revealed that Hubbell had an affair with Carol Ann.\n\n“This story reaches a point where you know these two people are finished,” Pollack said. “And it’s at the end of the projection room. By going from ‘I want us to love each other’ and ending there as though it’s coming apart … and then going very quickly to the next beat which is ‘Will you stay with me till the baby comes,’ it was the first time the picture worked.”\n\nRay Stark, in the DVD commentary, says, “The film was too long, and it was clear to us that the audience was much too interested in our two stars than in any message. During the initial preview, we borrowed Francis Coppola’s editing room in San Francisco, worked all night with Sydney, overseeing the editing with John Burnett and Margaret Booth. We cut 15 minutes, losing some of the politics and screened it the next night, and the audience really loved this version.”\n\nArthur Laurents admitted that the audience didn’t know or care that those cuts were made.\n\nPollack summarized his editorial choices: “I feel that there is real value in a lot of these scenes. But I made a decision at the time that I was going to sacrifice some of those little moments both for an overall shape that felt righter to me, and a certain amount of pace to the picture. I don’t say to this day that I’m right. I thought I was right at the time. I think there’s a cleaner line, emotionally, with the way it is now.”"
