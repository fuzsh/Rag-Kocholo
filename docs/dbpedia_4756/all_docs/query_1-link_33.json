        "text": "In the last couple decades before his death Sydney Pollack earned more acclaim for his supporting performances than for the increasingly distracted and elephantine “projects” he directed. Even work in Michael Clayton, Eyes Wide Shut, bits in The Player and Death Becomes Her paled beside his bumbling, porcine, immature divorcee in Woody Allen’s Husbands and Wives, major work; the scene in a grocery store where he forces Allen to endure his absurd monologue on why an aerobics instructor half his age “into” astrology is a worthwhile partner (“So she’s not Simone de Beauvoir! Big deal!”) nails a particularly middle-aged male fatuity I’ve watched a few times over the years.\n\nBut he also kept Tootsie a whirring surprise in spite of its condescension; Pollack had a solid instinct for how to juice up a film by bouncing actors off each other, a relic of a TV training which paid little attention to visuals. His seventies work with Robert Redford isn’t My Thing, but Pollack saw something aloof and blond and hot few other directors would again. The exception: Out of Africa, the epitome of white elephant cinema, a shorthand for The Respectable Middlebrow film whose audience was adults wanting Quality. Well into the nineties I’d spot the terrifying double-VHS package stocked in a parent’s friend’s entertainment center. Beside Random Hearts, though, Out of Africa is Bresson. Too stiff to be camp, it has one of my all-time favorite howlers: “You know those kits that tell you when you’re pregnant? They should have one that tells you when you’re sane.” Pollack’s usually the guy you turn to when you needed sanity.\n\nThe Hague\n\nHavana\n\nRandom Hearts\n\nMeh\n\nOut of Africa\n\nThe Interpreter\n\nSabrina\n\nThe Electric Horseman\n\nThis Property Is Condemned\n\nBobby Deerfield\n\nSound, Solid\n\nThe Way We Were\n\nThree Days of the Condor\n\nThe Firm\n\nThe Electric Horseman\n\nThe Scalphunters\n\nAbsence of Malice\n\nGood to Great"
