He was diagnosed with cancer about 10 months ago, Dart said, adding that doctors were never able to determine the primary source of the disease.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and two daughters. Services will be private, Dart said.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nBobby Henderson\n\n\"Ask me about Trajan.\"\n\nPosts: 10973\n\nFrom: Lawton, OK, USA\n\nRegistered: Apr 2001\n\nposted 05-26-2008 10:49 PM I'm pretty shocked to hear of Sydney Pollack's passing. Out of Africa is one of my mother's most favorite movies. He's one of the most important American film directors of modern times and not too bad an actor either. One of his best performances was in Eyes Wide Shut where he played a character pivotal in the film's plot.\n\nPollack worked as an executive producer on Recount, which debuted on HBO Sunday night.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nMark Campbell\n\nExpert Film Handler\n\nPosts: 148\n\nFrom: Seattle, WA USA\n\nRegistered: Jul 2007\n\nposted 05-26-2008 11:17 PM Had the tremendous (and odd) experience of working down the hall from Mr. Pollack for a brief time in Santa Monica while he was editing a film in Santa Monica out of some rental production office space. He was just 2 doors down from me (I was working on something else) but we would always see each other in the hall, parking lot etc. He was always such a gracious gentlemen when amongst us ordinary folk. He and I even figured out how to keep a fire door open together (I know, exciting, huh). I never acknowledged who he was other then someone else working in the building, but he didn't seem to care. He seemed to have no ego despite all of his great accomplishments. This is very rare and says a lot. Especially since I wanted to gush about how much I admired him. He might have been fine with that too. So let me gush now. \"Tootsie\" was genius!\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nDavid Stambaugh\n\nFilm God\n\nPosts: 4021\n\nFrom: Eugene, Oregon\n\nRegistered: Jan 2002\n\nposted 05-27-2008 12:04 AM Wow, this is sad news. I was channel surfing this morning and A Civil Action was on and Sydney Pollack was in it, and very good as he always seemed as an actor. I'm not ashamed to admit Out of Africa is one of *my* favorite films. Likewise Three Days of the Condor.\n\nThis man will deservedly be remembered as a true Hollywood legend.\n\nEDIT: I had mis-spelled his last name.\n\n[ 05-27-2008, 09:44 AM: Message edited by: David Stambaugh ]\n\n| IP: Logged"
