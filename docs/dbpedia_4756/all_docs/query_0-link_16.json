        "text": "Sydney Pollack directs old-fashioned Hollywood movies that run the\n\nfull gamut, from comedy to drama to thriller. Few directors have the\n\nextensive variety of credits represented by Pollack’s “Three Days of\n\nthe Condor,” “Out of Africa,” “Tootsie” and “The Firm.” His\n\nproductions always have an adult audience in mind, with screenplays\n\nthat are intelligent, relevant and to the point.\n\nPollack’s latest, “The Interpreter,” successfully draws the viewer\n\ninto the personal lives of the two main characters. They play out\n\ntheir fates against a backdrop of international intrigue.\n\nNicole Kidman is cool and quietly sophisticated as the United\n\nNations interpreter at the center of the story. She accidentally\n\noverhears an assassination plot against an African leader in a little\n\nknown language she happens to understand.\n\nSean Penn adds to his growing reputation as one of the best actors\n\nof our time. He is well-cast as the ambivalent Secret Service agent\n\nassigned to investigate the interpreter’s claims and protect her from\n\nharm.\n\nThe political realities of today’s Third World are very much on\n\ndisplay in the central story. The authenticity is enhanced by the use\n\nof many real rooms in the United Nations building throughout the\n\nmovie. The 1950s look and feel of the architecture adds to the Cold\n\nWar mentality that Pollack wants to recreate.\n\nBut Pollack turns away from the constant heart-pounding style of\n\nmany spy thrillers. The bursts of excitement are controlled by a\n\nsteady drumbeat of suspense. While this measured speed is welcome for\n\na grown-up crowd, the film’s pace at times is too slow and deliberate\n\nfor a two-hour running time.\n\nStill, this movie is a cut above average compared to its peers and\n\ndirected by a quiet master of the trade. Not great, but a very solid\n\neffort worthy of fans who appreciate this genre.\n\n* JOHN DEPKO is a Costa Mesa resident and a senior investigator\n\nfor the Orange County public defender’s office."
