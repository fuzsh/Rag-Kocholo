        "text": "Since it opened in 1929, the Chateau Marmont has been a beloved retreat of actors, writers, musicians, and directors craving a temporary (or sometimes not-so-temporary) home away from the prying eyes of the public and the press. As the Old Hollywood adage goes: “If you want to be seen, go to the Beverly Hills Hotel. If you don’t want to be seen, go to Chateau Marmont.”\n\nThe Chateau was the brainchild of Los Angeles attorney Fred Horowitz, who hired architects Arnold A. Weitzman and William Douglas Lee to build an apartment building inspired by European châteaux, particularly Château d’Amboise in the Loire Valley, France. Horowitz chose 8221 Sunset Boulevard, a hillside site on the northwest side of Sunset Boulevard and Marmont Lane in West Hollywood, for his complex, which was constructed of an earthquake-proof combination of concrete and reinforced steel. The French-influenced, L-shaped building was topped with a turret and a steeply-pitched slate roof and set above a garage with valet parking. Inside, the architects arranged 43 apartments with a variety of floor plans and Gothic details. Chateau Marmont opened on February 1, 1929, offering furnished apartments with one to six rooms. The most spacious penthouse went for $750 per month (about $13,453 today).\n\nAfter Horowitz and his investors were hit by the Great Depression, Chateau Marmont was sold in 1931 for $750,000 to Albert E. Smith, founder of the motion picture company Vitagraph. Smith converted the property into a hotel, taking advantage of the swell of visitors making their way to Los Angeles for the 1932 Summer Olympics. Smith hired silent film actress Ann Little to manage the property and she helped develop the Chateau’s signature aesthetic. Little redecorated the Chateau with an eclectic mix of pieces from the estates of Southern Californians trying to make up for their losses following the Great Depression and added amenities including basic room service.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the Sunset Strip became a hotspot, with the Sunset Tower, The Trocadero, and Schwab’s Pharmacy opening near the Chateau and adding to the area’s allure. In 1937, Smith purchased a plot of land east of the Chateau with several existing two-story rental homes and transformed them into the first of the now famous bungalows, which offered Hollywood stars even more privacy in the already-cloistered hotel.\n\nSmith sold the hotel in 1942 for $350,000 to German banker Erwin Brettauer. While the new owner eliminated many of the amenities and traditions incorporated by Little, he also invested in the property, including hiring costume designer Don Loper to refurbish the penthouse. Brettauer added a small outdoor pool in the summer of 1947, and it quickly became the gathering hub of the hotel. In 1951 he purchased a plot of land at the northwest corner of the site and hired modernist architect Craig Ellwood, known for his Case Study Houses, to build two additional contemporary bungalows, which opened in 1952.\n\nBrettauer sold Chateau Marmont in 1963, and the property would pass through several owners throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. During that time, the hotel fell into a state of disrepair. In 1975, it was purchased for $1 million by Sarlot-Kantarjian, a real estate development and construction firm owned by Raymond Sarlot and Karl Kantarjian.\n\nSarlot and Kantarjian set out to fix the hotel’s finances and its poor physical condition. “Ray and I regarded our new acquisition as an investment, nothing more,” wrote Kantarjian in the forward to Sarlot and Fred E. Basten’s book, Life at the Marmont: The Inside Story of Hollywood's Legendary Hotel of the Stars—Chateau Marmont. “It wasn’t until Ray moved in and the renovation began that our thinking began to change. The Marmont, we discovered, was a most friendly castle. The atmosphere was warm and genuinely real. We fell in love with the place.” The hotel was refurbished, repainted, and restored, and Sarlot purchased a neighboring property of cottages, which were transformed into garden bungalows. Sarlot and Kantarjian also had the Chateau Marmont declared a Historic Cultural Monument in the spring of 1976.\n\nIn 1990, hotelier André Balazs, who also owns the Chiltern Firehouse in London and Sunset Beach on New York’s Shelter Island, bought the now storied Chateau Marmont hotel for $12 million from Sarlot and Kantarjian. Balazs revamped the hotel and its image, giving the shabby spot a new upscale gleam. New amenities were added, including a gym, full room service, and outdoor seating areas. Balazs unveiled Bar Marmont on Sunset Boulevard in 1995, hosting Leonardo DiCaprio’s 21st birthday party on opening night, and in 2003 he opened the luxury hotel’s first restaurant. A Japanese restaurant Chateau Hanare opened in one of the bungalows in 2018, but has since closed, along with Bar Marmont. Balazs announced plans to convert Chateau Marmont into a private members-only hotel in 2020, but that plan was abandoned in 2022, the same year the hotel staff were able to unionize.\n\nOver the years, the property has been a landing pad for young stars arriving in Hollywood and A-listers between marriages, and a spot to live as one pleased without fear of it being captured by the paparazzi and ending up in the papers. Read on for a glimpse at the guest book and discover the famous guests that have called the Chateau Marmont home."
