        "text": "A supremely gifted, versatile player who could reach dramatic depths, as exemplified in her weary-eyed, good-hearted waitress in Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), or comedy heights, as in her sadistic drill captain in Schütze Benjamin (1980), Eileen Brennan managed to transition from lovely Broadway singing ingénue to respected film and television character actress within a decade's time. Her Hollywood career was hustling and bustling at the time of her near-fatal car accident in 1982. With courage and spirit, she recovered from her extensive facial and leg injuries, and returned to performing... slower but wiser. On top of all this, the indomitable Eileen survived a bout of alcoholism and became recognized as a breast cancer survivor, having had a mastectomy in 1990. On camera, she still tosses out those trademark barbs to the delight of all her fans, as demonstrated by her more-recent recurring roles as the prying Mrs. Bink on Eine himmlische Familie (1996) and as Zandra, the disparaging acting coach, on Will & Grace (1998).\n\nShe was born with the highly unlikely marquee name of Verla Eileen Regina Brennan in Los Angeles, California, the child of Irish-Catholic parents Regina (\"Jeanne\") Manahan (or Menehan), a minor silent film player, and John Gerald Brennan, a doctor. Following grade school education, she attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. and appeared in plays with the Mask and Bauble Society during that time. She then went on to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her lovely soprano coupled with a flair for comedy was the winning combination that earned her the break of her budding career as the not-so-dainty title role in the off-Broadway, tongue-in-cheek operetta \"Little Mary Sunshine\". For this 1959 endeavor, Eileen not only won an Obie Award, but was among an esteemed group of eight other thespians who won the Theatre World Award that year for \"Promising New Personality\", including Warren Beatty, Jane Fonda, Carol Burnett and a very young Patty Duke.\n\nUnwilling to be pigeonholed as a singing comedienne, Eileen took on one of the most arduous and demanding legit roles a young actress could ask for when she portrayed Annie Sullivan role in a major touring production of \"The Miracle Worker\" in 1961. After proving her dramatic mettle, she returned willingly to the musical theatre fold and made a very beguiling Anna in a production of \"The King and I\" (1963). She took her first Broadway bow in another comic operetta, \"The Student Gypsy\" (1963). In the musical, which was an unofficial sequel to her \"Mary Sunshine\" hit, she played a similarly-styled Merry May Glockenspiel, but the show lasted only a couple of weeks. Infinitely more successful was her deft playing of Irene Malloy alongside Carol Channing's Dolly Levi Gallagher in the original Broadway production of \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964). Eileen stayed with the role for about two years.\n\nBy this time, Hollywood beckoned and Eileen never looked back... or returned to sing on Broadway. After a support role in the film comedy Scheidung auf amerikanisch (1967) starring Debbie Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke, Eileen's talents were selected to be showcased on the irreverent variety show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967). But what seemed to be an ideal forum to show off her abilities didn't. Overshadowed by the wackier talents of Goldie Hawn, Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley, who became television comedy stars from this, Eileen seemed out of sync with the knockabout slapstick element. She left the cast before the show barely got off the ground. \"Laugh-In\" (1968-1973) went on to become a huge cult hit.\n\nIn retrospect, this disappointment proved to be a boon to Eileen's dramatic film career. Set in a dusty, barren town, she played up her hard looks and earned terrific reviews for her downbeat role of Genevieve, the careworn waitress, in Peter Bogdanovich's Die letzte Vorstellung (1971). As part of a superb ensemble cast, her hard-knocks vulnerability and earthy sensuality added authenticity to the dreary Texas surroundings. Following this, she scored great marks for her brothel madam/confidante in George Roy Hill's ragtime-era Oscar winner Der Clou (1973). Bogdanovich himself became a fan and used Eileen again and again in his subsequent films -- the ambitious but lackluster Daisy Miller (1974) and At Long Last Love (1975). At least, the latter movie allowed her to show off her singing voice. Her comedic instincts were on full display too in the all-star mystery spoofs Eine Leiche zum Dessert (1976) and Der Schmalspurschnüffler (1978) where she fared quite well playing take-it-on-the-chin dames.\n\nEileen hit the apex of her comic fame playing the spiky and spiteful drill captain who mercilessly taunts and torments tenderfoot Goldie Hawn in the huge box-office hit Schütze Benjamin (1980). She deservedly earned a \"best supporting actress\" Oscar nomination for her scene-stealing contribution and was given the chance to reprise the role on the television series that followed. Starring Lorna Patterson in the Hawn role, Private Benjamin (1981) was less successful in its adaptation to the smaller screen but Eileen was better than great and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe Awards in the process.\n\nDuring the show's run in 1982, Brennan had dinner one evening with good friend Goldie Hawn at a Los Angeles restaurant. They had already parted ways when Brennan was hit and critically injured by a car while crossing a street. Replaced in the television series (by \"Alice\" co-star Polly Holliday), her recovery and rehabilitation lasted three years, which included an addiction to painkillers. She returned to the screen in another amusing all-star comedy whodunit, Alle Mörder sind schon da (1985), in which she played one of the popular game board suspects, Mrs. Peacock. While looking weaker and less mobile, she showed she had lost none of the disarming causticity that made her a character star.\n\nForging ahead, Eileen went on to recreate her tough luck waitress character in Texasville (1990), the sequel to Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), and also appeared with Bette Midler in the overly mawkish Stella (1990). However, for the most part, she lent herself to playing eccentric crab apples in such lightweight fare as Rented Lips (1987), 900.000 $ zuviel (1988), Das Leben geht weiter (1997), Pants on Fire (1998), Jeepers Creepers - Es ist angerichtet (2001), Miss Undercover 2 (2005) and Naked Run (2011). She has also provided crotchety animated voices for series cartoons.\n\nEileen Brennan died at age 80 on July 28, 2013 at her Burbank, California home after a battle with bladder cancer. She is survived by her two sons, Patrick (formerly a basketball player, now an actor) and Sam (a singer), from her first and only marriage in the late 1960s to mid-1970s.\n\nSydney Pollack was an Academy Award-winning director, producer, actor, writer and public figure, who directed and produced over 40 films.\n\nSydney Irwin Pollack was born July 1, 1934 in Lafayette, Indiana, USA, to Rebecca (Miller), a homemaker, and David Pollack, a professional boxer turned pharmacist. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. His parents divorced when he was young. His mother, an alcoholic, died at age 37, when Sydney was 16. He spent his formative years in Indiana, graduating from his HS in 1952, then moved to New York City.\n\nFrom 1952-1954 young Pollack studied acting with Sanford Meisner at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. He served two years in the army, and then returned to the Neighborhood Playhouse and taught acting. In 1958, Pollack married his former student Claire Griswold. They had three children. Their son, Steven Pollack, died in a plane crash on November 26, 1993, in Santa Monica, California. Their daughter, Rebecca Pollack, served as vice president of film production at United Artists during the 1990s. Their youngest daughter, Rachel Pollack, was born in 1969.\n\nPollack began his acting career on stage, then made his name as television director in the early 1960s. He made his big screen acting debut in Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962), where he met fellow actor Robert Redford, and the two co-stars established a life-long friendship. Pollack called on his good friend Redford to play opposite Natalie Wood in Dieses Mädchen ist für alle (1966). Pollack and Redford worked together on six more films over the years. His biggest success came with Jenseits von Afrika (1985), starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. The movie earned eleven Academy Award nominations in all and seven wins, including Pollack's two Oscars: one for Best Direction and one for Best Picture.\n\nPollack showed his best as a comedy director and actor in Tootsie (1982), where he brought feminist issues to public awareness using his remarkable wit and wisdom, and created a highly entertaining film, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards. Pollack's directing revealed Dustin Hoffman's range and nuanced acting in gender switching from a dominant boyfriend to a nurse in drag, a brilliant collaboration of director and actor that broadened public perception about sex roles. Pollack also made success in producing such films as Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Der stille Amerikaner (2002) and Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003). Pollack returned to the director's chair in 2004, when he directed Die Dolmetscherin (2005), the first film ever shot on location at the United Nations Headquarters and within the General Assembly in New York City.\n\nIn 2000, Sydney Pollack was honored with the John Huston Award from the Directors Guild of America as a \"defender of artists' rights.\" He died from cancer on May 26, 2008, at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Pacific Palisades, California.\n\nSuzanne Pleshette achieved television immortality in her role as Bob Newhart's wife in the 1970s classic situation comedy, The Bob Newhart Show (1972). For her role as \"Emily Hartley,\" wife of psychologist \"Bob Hartley\" (played by Bob Newhart), Pleshette was nominated for the Emmy Award twice, in 1977 and 1978. She was also nominated for an Emmy in 1962 for a guest appearance on the TV series, Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961) and, in 1991, for playing the title role in Die Dollar-Queen (1990) in a 1990 TV movie. Her acting career lasted almost 50 years.\n\nSuzanne Pleshette was born on January 31, 1937, in New York, New York, to Gene Pleshette, a TV network executive who had managed the Paramount Theaters in Manhattan and Brooklyn during the Big Band era, and the former Geraldine Kaplan, a dancer who performed under the pseudonym Geraldine Rivers. Pleshette claims that she was not an acting natural, but just \"found\" herself attending New York City's High School of the Performing Arts. After graduating high school, she attended Syracuse University for a semester before returning to NYC to go to Finch College, an elite finishing school for well-to-do young ladies. After a semester at Finch, Pleshette dropped out of college to take lessons from famed acting teacher Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in 1957 as part of the supporting cast for the play Der Zwang zum Bösen (1959). Initially cast as \"The Fourth Girl,\" she eventually took over the ingénue role during the play's run.\n\nBlessed with beauty, a fine figure, and a husky voice that made her seem older than her years, she quickly achieved success on both the small and big screens. She made her TV debut, at age 20, in Harbourmaster (1957), then was chosen as the female lead opposite superstar Jerry Lewis in his 1958 comedy, Geisha Boy (1958). On Broadway, she replaced Anne Bancroft in the Broadway hit Licht im Dunkel (1962).\n\nOnce Pleshette started acting, her career never lagged until she was afflicted with cancer.\n\nHer most famous cinematic role was in Alfred Hitchcock's classic, Die Vögel (1963), as the brunette schoolteacher jilted by the hero of the film, \"Mitch Brenner\" (played by Rod Taylor). Pleshette's warm, earthy character was a perfect contrast to the icy blonde beauty, \"Melanie Daniels\" (Tippi Hedren).\n\nFrankly, it is hard to understand how Taylor's Mitch would jilt Pleshette's Annie, other than to work out Hitchcock's dark vision of society and psychosexual relations between the sexes, in which amoral blondes triumph for aesthetic rather than moral reasons.\n\nStill, it is for Emily Hartley she will always be remembered, for both the original show and her part in another show that had the most clever sign-off episode in TV series history. Bob Newhart had enjoyed a second success during the 1980s with his TV sitcom Newhart (1982), and when he decided to end that series, he asked Suzanne Pleshette to come back. She did, reprising her tole of Emily in a final episode of Newhart, where Newhart woke up as Bob Hartley from \"The Bob Newhart Show\" in the bedroom of the Hartley's Chicago apartment, Pleshette's Emily at his side. Bob Hartley then told his wife Emily of a crazy dream he'd just had, where he was the proprietor of a Vermont inn overrun with eccentrics, the premise of the second show.\n\nAfter \"The Bob Newhart Show\" ceased production, Suzanne Pleshette worked regularly on television, mostly in TV movies. Although she was a talented dramatic actress, she had a flair for comedy and, in 1984, she headlined her own series at CBS. She helped develop the half-hour sitcom, and even had the rare honor of having her name in the title. Suzanne Pleshette Is Maggie Briggs (1984), however, was not a success. She co-starred with Hal Linden in another short-lived CBS TV series, The Boys Are Back (1994), in the 1994-95 season, then had recurring roles in the TV series Good Morning, Miami (2002) and Meine wilden Töchter (2002).\n\nPleshette was married three times: In 1964, she wed teen idol Troy Donahue, her co-star in the 1962 film Abenteuer in Rom (1962) and in 1964's Die blaue Eskadron (1964), but the marriage lasted less than a year. She was far more successful in her 1968 nuptials to Texas oil millionaire Tommy Gallagher, whom she remained married to until his death in 2000. After becoming a widow, she and widower Tom Poston (a Newhart regular) rekindled an old romance they had enjoyed when appearing together in \"The Golden Fleecing,\" a 1959 Broadway comedy. They were married from 2001 until Poston's death, in April 2007.\n\nPleshette was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent chemotherapy in the summer of 2006; she rallied, but in late 2007, she barely survived a bout of pneumonia. She died of respiratory failure on January 19, 2008, a few days shy of her 71st birthday.\n\nSuzanne Pleshette was remembered as a gregarious, down-to-earth person who loved to talk and often would regale her co-stars with a naughty story. Newhart and his producers had picked her for the role of Emily in \"The Bob Newhart Show\" after watching her appearances with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), where she showed herself to be a first-rate raconteuse. Because she could hold her own with Newhart's friend Carson, it was felt she would be a perfect foil as Newhart's TV wife.\n\nShe accepted the part, and TV history was made.\n\nThough she was known best for drawing laughs as whiny, excitable characters throughout her raucous film and TV career, actress/comedienne Wendie Jo Sperber showed a brave, compassionate and humane side in the last years of her life.\n\nThe California girl was born on September 15, 1958, in Los Angeles and developed a driving passion for acting in her teen years. She went on to attend the Summer Drama Workshop at California State University, Northridge. Producer Allan Carr discovered this comic bundle when she invited him to see her in an L.A. stage review. He gave her an unbilled part in the John Travolta/Olivia Newton-John smash musical Grease (1978) and she was off and running.\n\nOther films quickly fell into place, notably I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) as a no-holds-barred Beatles fanatic, and the role of Linda McFly in Zurück in die Zukunft (1985) and one of its sequels. Other films included California Highway (1978), Steven Spielberg's 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979) and Bachelor Party (1984) starring Tom Hanks. Some of her tongue-in-cheek film roles were beneath her, particularly when they used her excess poundage as the butt of a cruel joke, but the actress proved quite game in such lowbrow, youth-oriented comedies as Traffic School - Die Blech- und Dachschaden-Kompanie (1985) and Die Stewardessen Academy (1986).\n\nIt was with a then fairly unknown Hanks and Peter Scolari that she earned her biggest laughs with the two-year run of Bosom Buddies (1980), which launched a number of inferior drag film/sitcoms. She also had series co-leads in Private Benjamin (1981), Women in Prison (1987), the plus-sized Babes (1990) and Staatsaffären (1992). In between were roles on the L.A. stage, including \"Pizza Man,\" \"Isn't It Romantic,\" \"Reality and Other Nightmares\" and Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" starring Ron Silver.\n\nAt age 39, Wendie was diagnosed with breast cancer. While her career momentum was certainly compromised, the comedienne continued to pursue roles. She even appeared on a poignant breast cancer episode of Murphy Brown (1988). Her cancer went into remission at one point but returned with a vengeance in 2002 and spread throughout her body.\n\nInstead of retreating, Wendie instead reached out and founded weSPARK Cancer Support Center in Sherman Oaks, California, in which free services, including support groups, information on the latest research and classes, provided invaluable aid to cancer patients, their families and friends. Her selfless determination throughout her illness to help others did not go unnoticed, earning several honors.\n\nEight years later, on November 29, 2005, Wendie lost her battle. She was survived by her parents and two children from a former marriage. Per her request, close friend, former actress Nancy Allen succeeded her as executive director of weSPARK, which continues to serve cancer patients and their families into the 2020's.\n\nKathryn is best known for her portrayals of \"Karen McCluskey\" on Desperate Housewives (2004) on ABC and of \"Mrs. Landingham\", secretary to the President (Martin Sheen), on the critically-acclaimed NBC drama, The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999). She has also recurred on Dharma & Greg (1997), and guest-starred on many hit television series, such as Becker (1998), Arli$$ (1996), Ally McBeal (1997), Providence (1999), Scrubs: Die Anfänger (2001) and over twenty other prime-time shows. Kathryn will also be seen later this year on ABC's daytime drama, General Hospital (1963). Her credits are impressive for any actor, let alone one that only began the craft at age 42.\n\nAlthough only put into action well into her middle years, Kathryn's dream began in her twenties, when her mother died of cancer in 1963. While dying in the hospital, her mother shared that her biggest regret was not following her dreams. Kathryn vowed, at that moment, that she would someday pursue her own dream of acting.\n\nAt the time, she was entering into a new career as a psychiatric nurse in a medium security wing for disturbed teenagers. Through that job, she met and married a psychiatrist, gave birth to two boys and settled down as a suburban housewife in Lake Forest, Illinois, a well-to-do suburb of Chicago. But Kathryn never forgot her dream of acting, something that she never had time to pursue in-between caring for her children and husband. In 1980, her husband's alcoholism led Kathryn to a divorce and a difficult situation; a single mother with two young sons. Rather than lose hope, she took the opportunity to change her life forever and follow her lost dream.\n\nKathryn took classes at Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago and performed at community theaters all over Northern Illinois. By day, she supported her family hanging wallpaper and painting the mansions of Lake Forest, working as a sales person for a Welcome Wagon company and using her contacts to book film and print locations in the houses she was painting. By night, Kathryn was improving her skills and moving from community theater to semi-professional theater. Her first break was in 1991. Disney held a cattle call for street performers for Disney World. After standing in line for five hours, Kathryn got the part and moved shop to Orlando, Florida. Though she was living behind an adult arcade in the \"tourist unfriendly\" part of Buena Vista, Kathryn was finally earning her living through performance and loving it. The part only lasted for a year and, once again, Kathryn was forced to supplement her acting income with other work -- bar-tending and catering during the day, theater at night. Though the acting gig was over, the move to Florida proved one thing to Kathryn...she had the talent to make it as an actor. She did it once and she could do it again. Unfortunately, it took her two and half years to realize it wouldn't happen in central Florida.\n\nIn December 1995, Kathryn again packed a truck and drove to Hollywood. Although she didn't have an agent and had no contacts, Kathryn never hesitated following her dream. In only five months, she landed her first part...two lines in Alle unter einem Dach (1989). In the six years since then, she has appeared in over a dozen plays, six movies, eleven national television commercials, two pilots, ten drama series and over twenty sitcoms. From her many roles, Kathryn is recognized as one of Murphy Brown (1988)'s secretaries, Frasier (1993)'s agent's mother and the bingo buddy to Drew Carey's girlfriend, on Die Drew Carey Show (1995). But it is her portrayal of \"Mrs. Landingham\", the foil, friend and secretary to Martin Sheen's \"President Bartlet\" on The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999) that propelled her into the spotlight she truly deserves. She followed that up with her last huge roll as Karen McCluskey for 8 seasons on ABC's Desperate Housewives (2004), which won her two Emmy awards. Joosten made a guest appearance on CBS daytime soap The Bold and the Beautiful as part of the show's 6000th episode, which featured several other real-life lung cancer survivors discussing their experiences. She was named the national spokesperson for the Lung Cancer Profiles campaign on behalf of Pfizer. Joosten died of lung cancer on the morning of June 2, 2012. Her death happened 20 days after the onscreen death of her character Karen McCluskey on the final episode of Desperate Housewives. The hit show ended its eight-year run on ABC last month with a series finale in which Joosten's character passed away. Her character's battle with brain cancer was a story line in the show.\n\nHe was a master class in cerebral eloquence and audience command...and although his dominant playing card in the realm of acting was quite serious and stately, nobody cut a more delightfully dry edge in sitcoms than this gentleman, whose calm yet blistering put-downs often eluded his lesser victims.\n\nActing titan Roscoe Lee Browne was born to a Baptist minister and his wife on May 2, 1922, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He attended Lincoln University, an historically black university in Pennsylvania until 1942, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he served in Italy with the Negro 92nd Infantry Division and organized the Division's track and field team. He graduated from Lincoln University in 1946, and studied French through Middlebury College's summer language program. He received his master's degree from Columbia University, then subsequently returned to Lincoln and taught French and comparative literature, seemingly destined to settle in completely until he heard a different calling.\n\nRoscoe relished his first taste of adulation and admiration as a track star, competing internationally and winning the world championship in the 800-yard dash in 1951. He parlayed that attention into a job as a sales representative for a wine and liquor importer. In 1956, he abruptly decided to become an actor. And he did. With no training but a shrewd, innate sense of self, he boldly auditioned for, and won, the role of the Soothsayer in \"Julius Caesar\" the very next day at the newly-formed New York Shakespeare Festival. He never looked back and went on to perform with the company in productions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Othello\", \"King Lear\" (as the Fool), and \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nBlessed with rich, mellifluous tones and an imposing, cultured air, Roscoe became a rare African-American fixture on the traditionally white classical stage. In 1961 he appeared notably with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway cast of Jean Genet's landmark play \"The Blacks\". Awards soon came his way -- the first in the form of an Obie only a few years later for his portrayal of a rebellious slave in \"The Old Glory\". Additionally, he received the Los Angeles Drama Critic's Circle Award for both \"The Dream on Monkey Mountain\" (1970) and \"Joe Turner's Come and Gone\" (1989). Roscoe found less successful ventures on 1960s Broadway, taking his first curtain call in \"A Cool World\" in 1960, which folded the next day. He graced a number of other short runs including \"General Seegar\" (1962), \"Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright\" (1962), \"The Ballad of the Sade Cafe\" (1964), \"Danton's Death\" (1965), and \"A Hand Is on the Gate: An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music\" (1966), which he also wrote and directed. He did not return to Broadway until 1983 with the role of the singing Rev. J.D. Montgomery in Tommy Tune's smash musical \"My One and Only\" in which his number \"Kicking the Clouds Away\" proved to be one of many highlights. Roscoe returned only once more to Broadway, earning acclaim and a Tony nomination for his supporting performance in August Wilson's \"Two Trains Running\" (1992).\n\nAlthough he made an isolated debut with The Connection (1961), he wouldn't appear regularly in films until the end of the decade with prominent parts in the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film, Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967), Jules Dassin's Black Power (1968), Hitchcock's Topas (1969) and, his most notable, Die Glut der Gewalt (1970). Thereafter, he complimented a host of features, both comedic and dramatic, including Superfly (1972) (and its sequel), Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974), Flucht ins 23. Jahrhundert (1976), Staatsanwälte küsst man nicht (1986), Mambo Kings (1992) and Hilfe, ich komm' in den Himmel (1996)\n\nElsewhere, Roscoe's disdainful demeanor courted applause on all the top 70s sitcoms including \"All in the Family\", \"Maude,\" \"Sanford and Son\", \"Good Times\" and \"Barney Miller\" (Emmy-nominated), and he played the splendidly sardonic role of Saunders, the Tate household butler, after replacing Robert Guillaume's popular \"Benson\" character on Die Ausgeflippten (1977). In 1986 he won an Emmy Award for his guest appearance on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). His trademark baritone lent authority and distinction to a number of documentaries, live-action fare, and animated films, as well as the spoken-word arena, with such symphony orchestras as the Boston Pops and the Los Angeles Philharmonic to his credit. A preeminent recitalist, he was known for committing hundreds of poems to memory. For many years he and actor Anthony Zerbe toured the U.S. with their presentation of \"Behind the Broken Words\", an evening of poetry and dramatic readings.\n\nAt the time of his death of cancer on April 11, 2007, the never-married octogenarian was still omnipresent, more heard than seen perhaps. Among his last works was his narrations of a Garfield film feature and the most recent movie spoof Fantastic Movie (2007).\n\nVeteran comedic actor Tom Poston, he with the bugged-out eyes that commonly accentuated a vague look of bewilderment, was born in Columbus, Ohio, on October 17, 1921. By age nine, the young boy was appearing with an acrobatic troupe.\n\nPoston later attended Bethany College in West Virginia when World War II broke out and he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. He won medals for his courage under fire, and rose to the rank of captain. While he never returned to Bethany College, he would later receive an honorary doctorate from the institution. Following his military service, Poston went to New York and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA), training with acting guru Sanford Meisner, among others. Making his Broadway debut in 1947 in José Ferrer's production of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", Poston had the makings of a serious dramatic actor, appearing in such classics as \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and \"King Lear\".\n\nAlthough he also appeared seriously in TV drama in the early stages, comedy would become his forte. Hosting the amusing daily TV show \"Entertainment\" led to his biggest break on The Steve Allen Show (1956). He, Louis Nye, Don Knotts, and other members of Allen's stock company became famous for their hilarious characters in Allen's famed sketch sequences. Poston himself would be best remembered as the \"Man on the Street\" interviewee who could never remember his own name. Winning an Emmy during those four seasons (1956-60), Poston went on to host another program, this time a game show, entitled Split Personality (1959).\n\nHe developed an affinity for parlor games and appeared as a panelist on other quiz shows as well, notably To Tell the Truth (1956). Given a chance to star in his own comedy films by the early 1960s, Poston went completely unnoticed in such blah vehicles as Zotz! (1962) and Das alte finstere Haus (1963), which failed to capitalize on his delightfully bungling, eccentric humor, although he did turn in a very funny supporting performance as a perpetually soused playboy in the Dick Van Dyke comedy Der 25 Millionen Dollar Preis (1971).\n\nAfter his movie career dried up, television again became the object of his affection, usually in service to other stars. Alongside such top comedians as Bob Newhart (Newhart (1982)) and Robin Williams (Mork vom Ork (1978)), Poston's absent-minded \"second banana\" foils found their engaging niche. The comedic actor also continued with light comedy theater vehicles such as \"Forty Carats\", \"Come Blow Your Horn\", \"Plaza Suite\", and \"Mary, Mary\", and even managed a few musicals (\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\").\n\nPoston had a pre-fame first marriage that ended in divorce. His second wife was film actress Jean Sullivan. Their daughter, Francesca Poston, also became an actress. He had two other children by third wife Kay, who was 22 years his junior: son Jason and daughter Hudson. They divorced in 1975, but remarried in 1980 and remained together until her death at age 54 in 1998 from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). He and Kay appeared on many telethons to discuss the crippling disease. Three years later, Poston found happiness again when he married Suzanne Pleshette (they originally met while appearing in the 1959 Broadway comedy \"Golden Fleecing\", then worked again together on the old The Bob Newhart Show (1972)). He continued to provide glum, baggy-eyed comedy relief on TV as an octogenarian up until the end. Sadly, while wife Suzanne was battling cancer, Poston passed away unexpectedly of respiratory failure at his Los Angeles home on April 30, 2007, after a brief illness. Pleshette died on January 19, 2008.\n\nThe stalwart actor may not have nabbed top comic superstardom in his heyday, but he certainly enjoyed a long, durable career doing what he did best -- acting goofy and giving audiences a reason to smile."
