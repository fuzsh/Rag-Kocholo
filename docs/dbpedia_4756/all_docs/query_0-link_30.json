        "text": "Constituency of One\n\nAfter Josh is hailed as the \"101st Senator\" in a newspaper profile, he clashes with conservative Senator Carrick (Tom Skerritt - \"Picket Fences\"), a Democrat from Idaho. Carrick withholds his approval of a backlog of military promotions so he can secure an expensive but faulty missile launcher to be built in his home state. Will gets a flattering offer from the newly approved Vice President, Robert Russell (recurring guest star Gary Cole), while C.J. runs afoul of Leo's temper when she deviates from the administration's scripted line regarding an Environmental Protection Agency report on coal-based energy. Likewise, Amy (recurring guest star Mary-Louise Parker) earns the President's wrath when she aggressively pushes for funding of the First Lady's agenda on violence prevention. Meanwhile, Toby creates a message calendar to maintain focus during Bartlet's second term. Laura Innes \"ER\" directed the episode.\n\nPoison\n\nA young Romanian girl, Alexis Campbell, who was adopted by an American family, lies near death after two cups of detergent are pumped from her stomach. Her seemingly normal family is upset, but her six-year-old sister Katie (Sloane Momsen) claims her mother tortured Alexis. Even though the family wanted to adopt Alexis, her mother, Karen (Cynthia Gibb), got pregnant with twins shortly after. A.D.A. Novak (Diane Neal) wants to prosecute Karen for murder, but Oliver Gates (Barry Bostwick), her defense attorney, doesn't want to allow Katie's testimony. Judge Oliver Taft (Tom Skerritt) makes it very difficult for Novak and agrees Katie should not be allowed to testify, but does agree to a bench trial. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) testifies and rips Judge Taft apart and \"mouths off\" on his way out. Judge Taft retaliates quickly, tossing Stabler in jail for contempt. Judge Taft finds Karen not guilty and Novak is furious, and wants Taft off the bench. Mary Conway Clark (Marlo Thomas) advises Novak to be careful, but Novak is determined to proceed.\n\nElysian Fields\n\nThe squad investigates the murder of a man who, 10 years ago, was the lead suspect in the murder of two girls. The state of the body indicates he was dragged behind a truck or SUV a full day before being shot twice in the head and dumped in Elysian Park. Tom Skerritt (\"Picket Fences,\" \"Brothers and Sisters\") guest stars as a detective who comes out of retirement to help with the investigation, but his obsession with closing this decade-old case threatens Brenda's own inquiry.\n\nThe One Percent\n\nAlicia manages the fallout when her client's insensitive statements to the press threaten the fate of a multi-billion dollar merger. Meanwhile, Diane faces a potential conflict of interest when she and Louis Canning are on opposite sides of a class action suit involving a pharmaceutical company. Also, Eli learns the truth about Alicia and Peter's relationship. Michael J. Fox returns as Louis Canning. Tom Skerritt reprises his role as Fortune 500 CEO James Paisley. Jill Hennessy returns as Rayna Hecht."
