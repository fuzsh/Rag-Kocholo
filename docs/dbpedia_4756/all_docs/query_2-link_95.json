        "text": "SYDNEY POLLACK was nothing if not prolific. The Oscar-winning director of the epic Out Of Africa, the comedy Tootsie and the espionage thriller Three Days Of The Condor was also a hugely industrious Hollywood producer and actor for five decades.\n\nWell-known for working with A-list stars on hit movies, Pollack has died in Los Angeles at 73.\n\nHis 20 movies as director also include They Shoot Horses, Don't They? with Jane Fonda, The Way We Were with his regular collaborator Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand, Absence Of Malice with Paul Newman, The Firm with Tom Cruise and The Interpreter with Nicole Kidman.\n\nHaving started out as an actor and acting teacher, Pollack was also well-known for on-screen roles in Husbands And Wives, The Player, Eyes Wide Shut and, more recently, Michael Clayton and Made Of Honour.\n\nThe Australian director Phillip Noyce described Pollack, who was executive producer on the Noyce-directed The Quiet American and Catch A Fire, as a generous collaborator whose death came just weeks after that of Anthony Minghella, Pollack's longtime film-making partner on such movies as The Talented Mr Ripley and Cold Mountain.\n\n\"I can't think of a man who's more respected in the American film industry for his body of work, for his inquiry, for his associations with emerging film-makers, for his sense of film history,\" Noyce said from Los Angeles.\n\n\"As a film-maker, his legacy is the films he produced, the films he directed, the films he acted in and the films he was the key inspiration for. For example, he acted in and was producer on Michael Clayton.\n\n\"He'll be remembered for Out of Africa and Tootsie principally but in every way he truly earned the all-encompassing title of film-maker.\"\n\nPollack was executive producer on Leatherheads, whose director, George Clooney, said: \"Sydney made the world a little better, movies a little better and even dinner a little better. A tip of the hat to a class act.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Pollack won Oscars for both best picture and director for Out Of Africa after earlier nominations for Tootsie."
