He's been attached to the city ever since.\n\n\"I used to come down here every time I'd get a few dimes to rub together, and it felt like I was missing something unless I was here,\" he told \"Today\" in 2023. \"I consider myself very lucky to be here.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh Harnett has been living in the English countryside since the pandemic.

He told The Guardian that when he lived in LA, he had experiences with stalkers.\n\n\"People showed up at my house. People that were stalking me,\" he said. \"A guy showed up at one of my premieres with a gun, claiming to be my father. He ended up in prison. There were lots of things. It was a weird time.
