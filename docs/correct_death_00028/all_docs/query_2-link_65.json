        "meta_description": "Donna Summer. Actress: Gottseidank, es ist Freitag. Donna Summer rocketed to international super-stardom in the mid-1970s when her groundbreaking merger of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and avant-garde electronica catapulted underground dance music out of the clubs of Europe to the pinnacles of sales and radio charts around the world.\n\nMaintaining an unbroken string of hits throughout the 70s and 80s, most of which she wrote, Donna holds the record...",

        "text": "In the summer of 1979, she became the first female artist in music history to have two hits in the Billboard Top 3 at the same time (with \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\"). She did it again in the fall with a #1 duet with Barbra Streisand and a #2 hit, \"Dim All the Lights\".\n\nWas also an exhibited artist. She sold over $1.2 million in original art beginning in 1989; her most expensive piece sold for $150,000.\n\nBruce Springsteen, a great admirer of hers, wrote two songs for her. The first one, \"Cover Me\", he decided to use on his \"Born in the USA\" LP. The second song, \"Protection\", Donna recorded and Springsteen and his band supplied the music track. Donna and Bruce actually recorded the song as a duet, but that version has never been released.\n\nBefore her death, she was believed to have caught lung cancer by inhaling toxic particles following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York. However, stories had painted a different picture, when Summer had contracted lung cancer, at the time she was singing in nightclubs, with smokers and she also had a family history of lung cancer, both of them claimed her life.\n\nShe and writer/producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte created an electronic, dance-driven sound that was the forerunner of today's \"techno\" music. Upon hearing the 1977 song \"I Feel Love\", Iggy Pop declared it the \"future of music\". Samples still continue today, most notably in Madonna's 2000 hit single \"Music\".\n\nWas the first solo artist in history to have three consecutive #1 double-albums on the Billboard charts. The only other musical act to accomplish this feat was The Beatles.\n\nGave birth to her second child at age 32, a daughter Brooklyn Sudano on January 5, 1981. Child's father is her now widowed second husband, Bruce Sudano.\n\nMet musician and songwriter Nathan DiGesare in 1994. He went on to become one of Summer's most frequent collaborators, both in the studio and on tour. They continued to work together until her death.\n\nIn 1978, she became the first female artist in history to have a #1 single (\"MacArthur Park\") and a #1 album (\"Live and More\") simultaneously on the Billboard charts. She broke her own record just a few months later when her single \"Hot Stuff\" and the album \"Bad Girls\" both reached the #1 position on the Billboard charts at the same time.\n\nHeld the most ranked dance songs on VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs with \"MacArthur Park\" at #89, \"I Feel Love\" at #76, \"Love to Love You Baby\" at #63 and \"Last Dance\" at #6.\n\nLike fellow chart-topping disco diva Gloria Gaynor, Summer had six siblings. Although Summer had five sisters and one brother, whereas Gaynor had five brothers and one sister."
