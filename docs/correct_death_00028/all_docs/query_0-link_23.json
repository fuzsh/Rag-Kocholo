        "text": "WHAT’S BETTER THAN DONNA\n\nSummer?\n\nThree Donna Summers!\n\nAt least, that’s the reasoning behind “Summer:\n\nThe Donna Summer Musical,” which employs three different actresses to portray the undisputed Queen of Disco.\n\nThere’s Duckling Donna, who portrays Donna Summer in her teen years, Disco Donna, portraying her in her 20 and 30s, and Diva Donna, who portrays her in her 40s and 50s.\n\nUsing three different performers gives you a deeper perspective than if you just saw one actress portraying the iconic singer throughout her entire life, says director Lauren Sobon.\n\n“Summer: The Donna Summer Story,” a new touring production by APEX Touring, will be playing throughout Florida this winter.\n\n(The Broadway production played to mixed reviews, opening in April 2018 and closing at the end of December that same year. It is the first authorized retelling of her story)\n\nIt’ll open at The Straz Center in Tampa Jan. 11-16, The Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center in The Villages Jan. 28 and 29, and then play at the Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall Feb. 1-6. Its Jan. 5-9 performances at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach are now postponed until May 20-26 due to Covid concerns.\n\nThe Queen of Disco died in 2012 of lung cancer at home in Naples, at age 63.\n\n“It’s also interesting that the Diva — the oldest Donna — and the Duckling, also portray other roles in the story too,” Ms. Sobon says. Diva Donna also portrays, Mary, the singer’s mother, while Duckling Donna transforms into Mimi, one of Donna’s daughters.\n\n“And an added benefit is when they sing together you have the harmony factor. It adds a bigger sound. It’s exciting to see the three generations come together and deliver some of these memorable songs.”\n\nThe musical includes over 20 of Donna Summer’s hits, such as “I Feel Love,” “Hot Stuff,” “Love to Love You Baby,” “Bad Girls” “Dim All the Lights,” “On the Radio” and “Last Dance.”\n\nDonna Summer was known worldwide as the Queen of Disco. She had 42 hits during her lifetime, including 14 in the Top 10. Winner of five Grammy Awards, she broke a number of records, including becoming the first artist to have three consecutive double albums hit the top of the charts. She was also the only artist to have 12 Top 10 hits from 1976 through 1982. (Ten of those were in the Top 5.)\n\nHer music was ubiquitous, played on radios and in discos everywhere. She was the first African-American woman to have a music video played on heavy rotation on MTV.\n\nAs a child in small town Lititz, Pennsylvania, Ms. Sobon was very familiar with her songs.\n\n“I can remember putting my roller skates on and boogying at the roller skate rink to her music, and dancing in my basement to it,” she says.\n\n“She’s this amazing singer. The Queen of Disco.”\n\nThe musical, she says, “takes you through Donna Summer’s life. It starts off when she’s a young girl (in Boston) and she discovers her voice and singing in church, and carries all the way through to the motherhood aspect of her life. There are some really fascinating situations that occurred in her life that she overcame.\n\n“It’s an incredible journey.”\n\nDonna Summer was a pioneer for women in the music industry, Ms. Sobon says.\n\n“She really paved the way, as far as self-representation and dealing with the music industry,” she says. “‘She Works Hard for the Money’ was a big changing point in her life. (It was inspired by) a poignant moment where she went into a restroom, and there was a bathroom attendant who was nodding off. She apologized, and said she worked multiple jobs and shifts. So she wrote the song for every woman who is working twice as hard as men and making half the money.\n\n“She was an advocate for women’s rights and moving forward, being heard, being seen in a room. That song was inspired by that woman. But she is absolutely singing about herself in that song as well. She also wrote that song as an ending package with (the record label) Casablanca. She had an agreement of one last song.”\n\n(The singer switched labels because she wanted to sing different types of music and didn’t want to be pigeonholed as only a disco singer, Ms. Sobon explains.)\n\nDecades later, Donna Summer’s music is still relevant. People still crank up the radio when “Hot Stuff” or “Bad Girls” plays.\n\nMs. Sobon notes that her music can be heard on “The House of Gucci,” in which Lady Gaga stars. And it’s recently been announced a biopic will be made of Donna Summer’s life.\n\nThe music is still infectious and energizing.\n\n“The audience reaction to ‘Summer: The Donna Summer Musical’ is amazing,” she says. “Especially at the end, when everybody celebrates her music. People are getting out of their seats and dancing and singing along. The show is about celebrating Donna Summer’s music.\n\n“She had over 20 hits. Some you may say, ‘Wait! I forgot about that song. I love that song! She wrote that too?’”\n\nAt the end of the musical, the theater is transformed into a disco with a gigantic disco ball suspended overhead. And the people do what people everywhere do whenever they hear Donna Summer’s music.\n\n“Everyone gets up and dances,” Ms. Sobon says. ¦\n\nIn the KNOW"
