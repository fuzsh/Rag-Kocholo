        "text": "The disco legend died this morning\n\nDonna Summer worked hard for the money and met her death at the age of 63 in Florida, while just in the midst of finishing an album. The singer died of cancer this morning and was keeping her illness from the public.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, Summer has three daughters; two named Brooklyn and Amanda, with her now husband Bruce Sudano. With her first husband, actor Helmuth Sommer, she had Mimi.\n\nIn a two cd-set exposition created by Plain Dealer Pop Music Critic John Soeder, he reports that Summer has been busy with raising her three children, two grandchildren and a garden. But he adds in the 2003 production, “she’s gearing up for a comeback.”\n\nAccording to TMZ, the team, comprised of Summer and her producer, Giorgio Moroder, has been viewed as inspiration for acts like Duran and Duran and David Bowie, as Summer and Moroder brought about the music era of the 70s. The duo combined Summer’s unique vocals with Moroder’s electronic harmonies.\n\nSummer tells Soeder, “Giorgio and I have chemistry,” adding, “We have a lovingly antagonistic relationship.”\n\nSummer has been dubbed the Queen of Disco, having welcomed dance and electronic music into the industry. Such modern idols as Madonna, Beyoncé and Michael Jackson have also been moved by Summer’s influence.\n\nSummer would say, “I’m a common person…God is the one who says, ‘Hey, you’re going to be more than this.’”"
