        "text": "The “Last Dance” has come for Donna Summer. The iconic disco-music queen, who rose to international fame in the 1970s, died Thursday of cancer, according to her family. She was 63 and her death comes just a day after the passing of Washington, D.C. go-go music pioneer Chuck Brown, whose rise to fame took place about the same time as Summer’s.\n\nHer career saw the Boston-born singer (real name; LaDonna Andre Gaines) perform at numerous venues here, including the San Diego County Fair’s Grandstand Stage in June, 2010, Viejas Concerts in the Park in 2008, and at Humphrey’s Concerts by the Bay in 1995, 1996 and 1999. Noted for her sultry singing voice and charismatic stage presence, Summer both defined and transcended disco.\n\nSummer was also a devoted visual artist, although that facet of her was always eclipsed by her music. In early 1990, she came here for an opening of her paintings and drawings at the Circle Gallery.\n\n“In my profession, things are very intangible,’ Summer said in 1990 UT San Diego interview. “You do a show, and it’s over. Unless you do a record, there’s nothing to grab on to. And even a record doesn’t have the same solidity. With a painting, you can look at it day after day and know it’s yours.”\n\nHer hit songs included “Love to Love You Baby” (whose erotic nature stirred up considerable controversy), “I Feel Love,” “Bad Girls,” “She Works Hard for the Money,” “The Wanderer,” “This Time I Know It’s For Real,” “Carry On” and “Last Dance.”\n\n“Donna Summer had a dynamic voice and unique musical style that helped define the dance music genre in the ‘70s,” said Grammy Awards honcho Neil Portnow. “She also was an artist who crossed many musical genres, as evidenced by her Grammy wins in the R&B, rock, inspirational and dance categories. Her talent was a true gift to the music industry, and our thoughts and sympathies are with her family, friends and fans throughout the world during this difficult time.”\n\nA gospel-trained singer, Summer was a five-time Grammy Award-winner whose disco reign was matched only by that of the Bee Gees, Chic and the Village People. She first achieved prominence in the late 1960s as a member of the German touring production of the Broadway musical “Hair,” after which she joined the Viennese Folk Opera company in Austria.\n\nSummer’s first record under her own name was 1971’s very obscure “Sally Go ‘Round the Roses,” which she recorded while living in Munich, Germany, under her maiden name. She scored two back-to-back disco hits in Europe with 1974’s “The Hostage’ and 1975’s “Love to Love You Baby,” the latter of which soon became a U.S. hit, fueled by its repeated chorus and a series of orgasmic sighs and moans.\n\n“I Feel Love,” released in 1977, is regarded as the first pop hit whose instrumental tracks were produced entirely by synthesizers, creating a template for techno and much of today’s Electronic Dance Music. Summer’s producers, Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, were instrumental in creating the distinctive sonic landscape that surrounded Summer’s rich, full-bodied vocals.\n\n“I can’t believe we’ve lost another wonderful singer,” Dolly Parton said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. “Donna, like Whitney (Houston), had one of the greatest voices ever. I loved her records. She was the disco queen, and will remain so. I knew her and found her to be one of the most likable and fun people ever. She will be missed and remembered.”\n\nYet, while the queen of disco tag is one she earned and maintained, Summer never felt comfortable with it.\n\n“I never crowned myself,” said in a 1986 UT San Diego interview. “I always thought of Donna Summer the disco queen as `the other woman.’ That Donna\n\nSummer never seemed like a real person to me. That Donna Summer wore certain makeup, moved in certain ways, did things the real Donna Summer wouldn’t, and didn’t do things the real Donna Summer would.”\n\nSummer co-starred in the disco-themed 1978 movie “Thank God It’s Friday.” In 1998, she won the first Grammy Award presented in the then-new Best Dance Recording category. Her most recent album, “Mistaken Identity,” came out in 2008 and disappeared almost without a trace, although she performed that same year on “American Idol.” At the time of her death, Summer was reported to be working on an album of disco standards. It remains to be seen if it will now be released posthumously.\n\nRaised in a deeply religious family, her success in disco have Summer a hedonistic image that she seemed to embrace, at least publicly. By the mid-1980s she had again embraced her Christian faith.\n\n“Now I just want to be the best at whatever I’m doing,” Summer said in her 1986 UT San Diego interview. “The best singer I can be, the best mother, the best whatever. I’m more aware that I’m going to leave a mark and I want it to be a good one.\n\n“If you really knew me, you’d realize how abstract that whole thing was. “Someone like Madonna can relate to her sex appeal. That’s what she wants. I don’t. It’s not that I don’t want to be attractive. But I don’t want to use sex appeal as a weapon.\n\n“I learned a lot from Sophia Loren. She’s my neighbor, and — to me — she’s role\n\nmodel No. 1. She epitomizes womanhood to me — the feminity, and mind and\n\nthe humor of women. She’s a well-rounded human being… You’ve got to be careful with sex appeal, how you use it. You can be sexy. You can make it work for you. But you can’t let it use you. If you have talent, eventually the sexy image is only going to get in your way.\n\n“Everyone has their reign at the top. But on the way down, what carries\n\nyou over the hump is talent. That’s got to come first.”\n\nSummer is survived by her second husband, former Brooklyn Dreams singer Bruce Sudano, three children, and four grandchildren."
