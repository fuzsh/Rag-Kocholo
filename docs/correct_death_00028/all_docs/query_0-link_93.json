        "text": "Donna Summer’s family will pay their last respects to the disco legend in a private homegoing service for family and close friends.\n\nIn a statement sent to ESSENCE.com, her publicist Brian Edwards, says reports of a public memorial next week in Nashville are not true and that Summer’s family is planning a private service. “The overwhelming outreach from the media, fans and friends alike has been most truly appreciated,” he says on behalf of the Sudano family (Summer was married to musician Bruce Sudano for 32 years). “Thank you for continuing to respect the family’s privacy during their time of loss.”\n\nEdwards did not provide any more information on where or when the service would take place.\n\nIn an earlier statement Edwards revealed that the cause of Summer’s death was lung cancer, though she was a “non-smoker.”\n\n“Obviously, numerous factors can be attributed to the cause of cancer in general, but any details regarding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of Ms. Summer’s case remain between her family and team of doctors,” he said.\n\nSummer died on Thursday morning in Naples, Florida."
