        "text": "The late Donna Summer will be laid to rest at a private funeral tomorrow (May 23) in Nashville.\n\nThe disco star will be buried at a private ceremony at a Tennessee church, which will be attended only by close friends and family, reports TMZ. The media have been banned from the invitation only event, which around 1,000 mourners are said to be attending.\n\nAfter her death, the chairman of the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame nominating committee said he regretted the fact that Summer was never inducted. Speaking to The New York Times last week, Jon Landau said: “There is absolutely no doubt that the extraordinary Donna Summer belongs in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame”.\n\nDisco singer Summer died on May 17 at the age of 63. Famous for hit singles including ‘I Feel Love’, ‘Love To Love You Baby’ and ‘Hot Stuff’, she passed away in Florida after a lengthy battle with cancer. Summer released 17 studio albums in total, most recently 2008’s ‘Crayons’, which she promoted with a full world tour. She won five Grammys during her career, as well as a string of other awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is survived by her husband, singer and producer Bruce Sudano, their daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda, and Summer’s daughter, Mimi, from a previous marriage.\n\nDonna Summer 1948-2012 – Obituary\n\nDonna Summer: Her career in photos\n\nRecommended\n\nBlog: Donna Summer – Six Songs To Remember Her By"
