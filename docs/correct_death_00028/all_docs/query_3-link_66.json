        "text": "As many predicted, after news of disco legend Donna Summer’s sudden death broke this week, her album sales began to spike.\n\nAccording to Billboard.com, her five currently available greatest hits albums are expected to sell between 20,000 and 40,000 copies by week’s end, which will ensure their reemergence on the music charts. An impressive feat, considering seven of Summer’s hit albums are out of print and no longer for sale physically or digitally.\n\nPHOTOS: Donna Summer’s Iconic Hairstyles\n\nSummer’s estate owns the two albums she made under Atlantic Records, and the five under Geffen Records, in the 1980s and 1990s. The Geffen albums haven’t been for sale since 2003, reports Billboard.com. Her Atlantic albums were last available for purchase in 1996 and 2009.\n\nHer biggest hits, which were recorded under Casablanca Records, are still available digitally, but impossible to find in print. Her last album, Crayons, was released in 2008 and can still be purchased.\n\nLISTEN: Donna Summer’s Greatest Hits\n\nSummer died on May 17th after a long battle with lung cancer. She was 63. Fans and celebrities were stunned by the news, and immediately took to twitter to pay their condolences. During her illustrious 38-year career, Summer earned five Grammy awards and charted over 30 number one hits.\n\nWhich of Summer’s songs is your favorite? And, have you been able to buy it?"
