        "text": "By Sabina Bhasin\n\n7286847\n\nDisco queen Donna Summer, whose pulsing anthems such as \"Last Dance,\" ?'Love to Love You Baby\" and \"Bad Girls\" became the soundtrack for a glittery age of sex, drugs, dance and flashy clothes, has died. She was 63.\n\nSummer and her husband, Bruce Sudano, own a condominium in Tiburon Golf Club, part of the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort development in North Naples.\n\nHer family released a statement Thursday saying Summer died in Naples and that they \"are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continue legacy.\" Summer had discreetly been battling lung cancer.\n\n\"Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time,\" the statement said.\n\nAlthough she was famous for glitz and glam, Summer lived a private life in Naples with her husband. Whether at home, eating breakfast at Sunburst CafÃ© off Pine Ridge Road or shopping at Costco, Summer \"would put on a floppy hat and blend in with the community,\" Sunburst owner Jerome Tocio said.\n\n\"She didn't look like a diva, she looked like an ordinary person,\" said Nic Stones, one of Summer's neighbors. \"She looked like an ordinary person you'd see at the fitness center, or pool. You wouldn't know she was a big star unless someone told you.\"\n\nTocio said he'll never forget the first time Summer ate at his restaurant back in 2003.\n\n\" Here, the ?Queen of Disco' is sitting in my restaurant, it's packed, and no one knows,\" he said. \"Of course you want to respect a celebrity's privacy so I didn't say anything, but inside, I was a giddy little kid.\"\n\nSummer, real name LaDonna Adrian Gaines, was born in 1948 in Boston. Tocio, who also grew up in the Boston area, said they bonded over that. Soon, he was attending her concerts and supporting her backstage.\n\n\"She signed all my pictures I had of her, and all my albums,\" Tocio said. \"Thirty-five years ago I did a drawing of her in an art class, and she signed that too. I look at them now and I'm just shocked. I can't believe she's gone.\"\n\nSummer came to prominence just as disco was burgeoning, and came to define the era with a string of No. 1 hits and her luxurious hair and glossy, open lips.\n\nA number of her albums reached gold or platinum status, including the multiplatinum \"Bad Girls\" and \"On the Radio, Volume I & II.\" Her No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits include \"Hot Stuff\" and \"MacArthur Park.\"\n\nSummer was raised on gospel music and became the soloist in her church choir by age 10.\n\n\"There was no question I would be a singer, I just always knew. I had credit in my neighborhood, people would lend me money and tell me to pay it back when I got famous,\" Summer said in a 1989 interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\"Love to Love You Baby,\" released in 1975, was her U.S. chart debut and the first of 19 No. 1 dance hits between 1975 and 2008 ? second only to Madonna. The song was later sampled by LL Cool J, Timbaland and BeyoncÃ©, who interpolated the hit for her jam \"Naughty Girl.\"\n\n\"I've just seen on Twitter and Facebook, everyone is heartbroken, shocked and surprised,\" said David Burnum, 18, who also lives in the Tiburon community. \"First we lose Whitney (Houston) one of the biggest stars, and now we lose Donna Summer, one of the biggest stars of the older generation, so it's a really big loss.\"\n\nUnlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular, Summer was able to grow beyond it and later segued to a pop-rock sound. She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with \"She Works Hard for the Money,\" which became another anthem, this time for women's rights.\n\nSoon after, Summer became a born-again Christian and faced controversy when she was accused of making anti-gay comments in relation to the AIDS epidemic. Summer denied making the comments, but was the target of a boycott.\n\nShe was never comfortable with the \"Disco Queen\" label. Musically, she began to change in 1979 with \"Hot Stuff,\" which had a tough, rock ?n' roll beat. Her diverse sound helped her earn Grammy Awards in the dance, rock, R&B and inspirational categories.\n\nSummer said grew up on rock ?n' roll and later covered the Bruce Springsteen song \"Protection.\"\n\n\"I like the Moody Blues, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as well as Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, the Supremes and Temptations,\" she said. \"I didn't know many white kids who didn't know the Supremes; I don't know many black kids who don't know the Moody Blues.\"\n\nShe released her last album, \"Crayons,\" in 2008. She also performed on \"American Idol\" that year with its top female contestants.\n\n\"She was an incredible human being,\" Tocio said. \"I feel like I've lost a friend. Such a gentle soul.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
