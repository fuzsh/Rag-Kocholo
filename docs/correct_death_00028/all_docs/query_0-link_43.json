        "meta_description": "The 63-year-old singer and songwriter died in Naples, FL, from non-smoking related lung cancer. The disco diva rose to fame in the 1970s, with hits like \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Last Dance.\" As disco's popularity waned, Summer wrote songs for several different genres. Her song, \"Starting Over Again,\" for Dolly Parton was a number-one country single in 1980. Her 1983 hit, \"She Works Hard for the Money,\" became a pop-rock feminist anthem. Summer was a five-time Grammy winner, who's been sampled by artists from Beyonce to the Pet Shop Boys.",

        "text": "AFP\n\nPhoto shows Secret Service agent's jacket, not Trump gunshot wound\n\nDonald Trump was shot in the right ear by a gunman who opened fire at a campaign rally in the state of Pennsylvania, but social media users are sharing a photo they claim shows the former US president was also hit in the chest. This is false; the Republican businessman has only said his ear was injured, and the image circulating online depicts a crease in a Secret Service agent's jacket .\n\nAssociated Press\n\nOrder restored in the UK city of Leeds after overnight unrest\n\nOfficials in the northern English city of Leeds say order has been restored after a night of unrest that began when police and local government workers intervened in a “family incident” and residents poured into the streets in protest. Rioters set a bus on fire and tipped over a police car in what police described as a “serious disorder incident” that began at about 5 p.m. on Thursday in the city’s Harehills area. A large number of officers were deployed to the area and the “full weight of the law” will be used against those responsible, West Yorkshire Police said in a statement."
