        "text": "It's not everyday you meet a celebrity. It's also not everyday you get to sing a duet with them. But for Matt Ward the dream came true in the early '80s when he got the chance to sing with Donna Summer.\n\nSummer died Thursday in Florida after battling cancer.\n\n\"It was a shock to me, even though I haven't spoken to her in a few years,\" Ward said. Like others, he said she was great at keeping her private life just that — private.\n\nWard sang a duet on Summer's popular \"She Works Hard for the Money\" album, released in 1983. The song, \"Love Has A Mind Of Its Own,\" hit number 70 on the Billboard's Top 100 in 1984.\n\n\"Donna was cool,\" he remembers. \"She was big on shoes.\"\n\nThe Monument resident said Summers was a \"sweetheart,\" and wanted Ward to keep a big promise.\n\n\"She asked me the first time I sang if I had any vocal lessons? I said 'no.' And she said, 'don't. I don't want you to ruin your voice.'\"\n\nBut there is one thing he'd like to do over. A fluke case of laryngitis caught by the singer cancelled an appearance for the two on the \"Tonight Show,\" then hosted by Johnny Carson.\n\nIn one of her last performances in 2009, Summer performed in Oslo at the concert honoring the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to President Barack Obama.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Bruce Sudano, three daughters — Brooklyn Sudano, Amanda Sudano and Mimi Dohler — and four grandchildren. She is also survived by a brother, Ricky Gaines, and four sisters: Dara Bernard, Mary Ellen Bernard, Linda Gaines and Jeanette Yancey.\n\n\"She's going to be sorely missed,\" Ward said."
