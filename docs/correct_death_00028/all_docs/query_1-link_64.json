The plane was the subject of a documentary at the time and a film about the crew was made in 1990 starring Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz and Harry Connick Jr. Ten days after the 25th mission, the pilot, Capt. Robert K. Morgan and co-pilot, Capt. James Verinis, met the king and queen of England, to whom Morgan explained the origin of the plane's name.\n\nIn 1954, in a major civil rights victory, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., ruled unanimously that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.\n\nIn 1973, the U.S. Senate Watergate Committee opened hearings into a break-in at Democratic National headquarters in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1987, two Iraqi Exocet missiles hit the frigate USS Stark in the Persian Gulf, killing 37 seamen. Iraq apologized for mistaking the ship's identity and the Stark's top officers were reprimanded and retired.\n\nIn 1989, 1 million people demonstrated for democratic reforms in Beijing. The number of students fasting to support the drive reached 3,000.\n\nIn 1999, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost his bid for re-election when voters chose Ehud Barak, head of the center-left Israel One coalition, to succeed him.\n\nIn 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nIn 2005, Los Angeles voters elected Antonio Villaraigosa as the city's first Hispanic mayor since 1872.\n\nIn 2007, the United States' \"minority\" citizenship topped the 100 million mark, about one-third of the total U.S. population, the U.S. Census Bureau said. Hispanics made up the largest group, ahead of African-Americans, 44.3 million to 40.2 million.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the sentencing of a juvenile to life in prison for a non-homicide case, calling the practice unconstitutional, and cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, disco icon Donna Summer died in Florida after a battle with cancer. She was 63."
