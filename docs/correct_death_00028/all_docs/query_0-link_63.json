        "text": "Naples is a favorite residential retreat for lots of today’s most prominent celebrities. It’s no wonder why: our city’s access to pristine sugary-soft sand beaches, along with its plentiful golf greens, five-star dining, and chic shops make it one of the premier destinations to live and vacation in Southwest Florida. We don’t call it Paradise Coast for nothing!\n\n6 Celebrities Who Live in Naples: Some May Surprise You\n\nCelebrities have their choice of places to live, but those who set down roots in Naples, or are snowbirds who come to nest, know a good thing when they see it. And Naples is definitely a good thing.\n\nCheck out these celebrities who have a place in Paradise (or have had one in the past).\n\nActors\n\nJane Seymour\n\nThis Bond Girl (Live and Let Die) turned Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman actress makes her home in the Naples suburb of Port Royal.

The Emmy and Golden Globe award winner began her acting career in 1968 and is still going strong.\n\nSteven Seagal\n\nSteven Seagal originally lived in Japan where he worked as a martial arts instructor before moving to Los Angeles and eventually starring in his first film, Above the Law, in 1988. Seagal later starred in other blockbusters, including Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, Out for Justice, and Under Siege.\n\nMusicians\n\nDonna Summer\n\nThe Queen of Disco must have thought Naples was “Hot Stuff” when she decided to make our city her home. And “Heaven Knows” that when you hear Summer’s music “On the Radio”, you probably love the vibe as much as she loved Naples, for which she saved the “Last Dance” until she died in 2012.\n\nRelated: 10 fabulous reasons to relocate to Naples\n\nAlex Lifeson\n\nThis Rock & Roll Hall of Famer is the lead electric and acoustic guitarist for Rush, the rock band he co-founded over 40 years ago. In addition to playing guitar, Lifeson sings backing vocals for the band’s live performances and plays bass pedal synthesizers and keyboards. The uber-talented musician also masters the mandolin, mandola, and bouzouki.\n\nSports Figures\n\nFuzzy Zoeller\n\nFrank Urban Zoeller, or “Fuzzy” Zoeller, is a golf great who has won two major championships, the Masters and the U.S. Open, and 10 PGA Tour titles. He is only the third man to win the Masters in his first attempt.\n\nRelated: The best activities for retirees in Naples\n\nMike Ditka\n\nThis pro-football Hall of Famer, who was the first tight end to be honored with that distinction, lives in North Naples in a home valued at $3 million.
