        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 1979, Donna Summer's album Bad Girls hits #1 in the US. Bad Girls is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Donna Summer. Originally issued as a double album, Bad Girls became a best-selling critically acclaimed album and reached the top of the US Billboard 200, where it stayed for six weeks. Containing hits like \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\", it is considered by many one of the best disco albums of all time.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1792 - Francis Johnson, an African American musician and composer during the Antebellum era, is born.

With obtuse lyrics from Bryan Ferry and futuristic synth soundscapes by Brian Eno, it's a tough nut to crack for many listeners but is later hailed as a triumph.\n\n1972 - David Bowie released his fifth studio album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The concept album tells the story of a fictional rock star (Bowie's alter ego) named Ziggy Stardust who acts as a messenger for extraterrestrial beings. The album includes songs such as \"Suffragette City\", \"Ziggy Stardust\", and the unforgettable \"Starman\".

Directed by John Landis, the film follows two ne'er-do-well Chicago-area brothers who are suddenly inspired to perform a philanthropic act, putting their musical talent to good use as the source of their generosity and redemption. The music-infused film features cameo appearances by such artists as Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and John Lee Hooker, among others.\n\n1982 - Pretenders guitarist James Honeyman-Scott, 25, died of a heroin overdose in London.

The band continued to record and perform in various incarnations after the reunion.\n\n2006 - The White Stripes win a lawsuit brought on by Ghetto Recorders studio owner Jim Diamond. Diamond claimed he produced the band's first two albums and that the band owed him royalties for his work.
