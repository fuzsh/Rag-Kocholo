        "text": "Legendary disco queen Donna Summer has died at age 63.\n\nSummer’s family released a statement saying she had passed away and that they “are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy.”\n\nTMZ initially reported the news, saying that Summer died after a long battle with cancer. The outlet also stated that sources claim Summer believed she contracted the disease after inhaling toxic particles after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack in New York City.\n\nThe multiple Grammy winner charted numerous hits, especially during the disco era of the mid-to-late 1970s. Among some of her best-known songs are “Last Dance,” “Bad Girls,” “She Works Hard for the Money,” “Heaven Knows,” “I Feel Love” and “MacArthur Park.” She also sang duets, performing with Barbra Streisand on the hit “No More Tears (Enough is Enough).”\n\nSummer had a complicated history with the LGBT community, whom she had initially won over thanks to the aforementioned disco hits. However, in the mid-1980s there were rumors that Summer—a born-again Christian at this time—said that AIDS was God’s punishment for homosexuality. However, she denied ever saying this. In a 2003 interview with Windy City Times, Summer said that there had been closure in the matter, at least for her. She added, “I hope it has for everyone else. I think that a person has to follow their lifestyle and know who you are as a person. Because otherwise, it’s easy to believe whatever you read in print—but you really shouldn’t.\n\nCelebrities immediately responded to Summer’s passing. According to USA Today, Mary J. Blige tweeted, “You were truly a game changer!!!” while Gloria Estefan posted, “Few singers have impacted music & the world like Donna Summer! It’s the end of an era. Peace & prayers 2 all who loved her. I will miss her!”\n\nAccording to an Advocate.com item, Jake Shears—the out lead singer of Scissor Sisters—said of Summer, “I don’t think we would be here without her. … She was the soundtrack to the gay liberation movement of the ’70s. It’s a massive loss and it’s really amazing to think what a huge impact she had.”\n\nAmong the others who weighed in were Windy City Media Group writer Marc “Moose” Moder, who, in part, penned in his Nightspots column his thoughts about one of her songs: “No matter what Donna Summer’s lasting overall legacy is, time will tell, but the impact of ‘I Feel Love’ has never let up. It continues to influence and change the face of music to new generations every year, and respect should be paid to the artist who gave birth to one of the finest moments in dance history.”\n\nA Windy City Times writer, David-Elijah Nahmod, emailed, “Donna Summer’s ‘Love to Love You Baby’ was a smash hit in 1976, the year I came out. That song, ‘I Feel Love’ and other tracks by her was the joyous music of my youth, the music that told me it was OK to be gay. It therefore holds a special place in my heart.\n\n“Beyond the fond memories, Summer’s voice was an extraordinary, powerful instrument, so it’s profoundly sad to see her silenced so suddenly, and at a relatively young age. She was also a painter of some renown. She had many God-given gifts. She brought much love and light into the world.”\n\nSummer is survived by her husband, vocalist Bruce Sudano, as well as three daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n—Andrew Davis"
