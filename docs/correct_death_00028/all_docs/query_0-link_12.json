She bought home in 2007 on North Manasota Key off Venice (sometimes called Englewood). She also had a 25 acre home in Brentwood, Tennesse and a home on Shelter Island off Long Island, NY. North Manasota Key is very exclusive and gated community. The home was built in 1950 was once owned by Mel Tillis, it was 4 bedroom 4 bath, 3786 square feet on 1.1 acres with 200' of Gulf frontage with a boat house, dock and pool. After Donna Summer's death, the home went on the market for $3.2 million and sold in 2013 in 71 days for $2.85 million. The buyer was Detlev von Platen, the president and chief executive officer of Porsche Cars North America. Others with homes on Manasota Key are Tim McGraw, Bobby Vinton and Martina Navratilova.\n\nIn 2000 Donna bought a condo in the gated community of Bolero in Naples. She owned both the condo and the above waterfront home.\n\nDonna died at age 63 and is buried at Hapeth Memorial Gardens in Nashville.\n\nDonna's home in Brentwood, Tennessee.
