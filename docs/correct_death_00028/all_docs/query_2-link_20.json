But unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular, she was able to grow beyond it and later segued to a pop-rock sound.\n\nKnown for her 1970s disco standards Last Dance, Hot Stuff and Bad Girls, Summer won five Grammy Awards over the course of her career.\n\nIn the 1980s, she released the hits She Works Hard for the Money and This Time I Know It’s for Real.\n\nBorn on New Year’s Eve, 1948, as LaDonna Adrian Gaines just outside of Boston to devout Christian parents, Summer was one of seven children.\n\nHer singing career began in the church, and she often recounted the early influence of her mother singing to her around the house, or sitting her down to listen to classical music if she was misbehaving. That early understanding of the power of music to soothe and change one’s mood would come to colour the young woman’s dreams of becoming a singer.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAt 18, Summer left home for Broadway, where she’d audition for Hair. She’d win a part when the musical went on the road to Germany, and there she’d meet the career-launching producer Giorgio Moroder. After early successes in Europe, he’d help launch her solo career back in the U.S. with Love to Love You Baby in 1975. The song would hit No. 2 on the Billboard charts the next year.\n\nSummer was the mother of two daughters with Sudano, whom she married in the 1980s.\n\nShe released her last album, Crayons, in 2008. It was her first full studio album in 17 years. She also performed on American Idol that year with its top female contestants.\n\nTMZ went on to report that the singer, who many considered the “Queen of Disco,” was apparently working on a new album.\n\nHere’s a video of one of Summer’s classic tracks. Summer said in a 2008 interview with ABC’s Nightline that she found in the inspiration for the song from an elderly woman working as a bathroom attendant at the Grammy Awards. The song would become an anthem for women’s rights.\n\nSoon after the release of that massive hit song, Summer became a born-again Christian and faced controversy when she was accused of making anti-gay comments in relation to the AIDS epidemic. Summer denied making the comments, but was the target of a boycott.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStill, even as disco went out of fashion she remained a fixture in dance clubs, endlessly sampled and remixed into contemporary dance hits.\n\nReaction from the music and entertainment worlds is starting to filter in over Twitter to the singer’s death.
