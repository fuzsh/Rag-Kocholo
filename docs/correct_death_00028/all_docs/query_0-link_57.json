        "text": "Denny Laine is among a handful of rock 'n' roll stars who found their way to Naples.\n\nDrawn to its Gulf breezes and serene sunsets, they moved here while others grew up in the Southwest Florida town.\n\nHere's a look at those who made rock history with connections to Naples.\n\nDenny Laine, friend of Paul McCartney\n\nThe former Moody Blues and Wings member died Tuesday at 79 in Naples. News-Press and Naples Daily News entertainment journalist Charles Runnells over the summer interviewed Denny Laine, who discussed his relationship with Paul McCartney.\n\n“It came very easily because we shared the same background, if you like, musically,” Laine, who was born in Birmingham, England, said in the story. “It wasn’t something that’s like, ‘I’m in awe of Paul McCartney.’ I mean, no way. No, I’m not.”\n\nDonna Summer, the Queen of Disco\n\nInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, Donna Summer lived in Naples since 2000, creating and selling paintings before dying in her Naples home in May 2012. Summer, who was 63, is considered the biggest star from the disco era. Her 1979 hit, \"Hot Stuff\" remained at No. 1 for three weeks. And what wedding reception hasn't played as its final song her hit \"Last Dance\"?\n\nBob Seger, Detroit rocker and Neapolitan for decades\n\nThe Michigan rocker has called Naples home for more than a quarter century, living part-time in a Gulf-side condo. During his 2015 show at Germain (now Hertz) Arena in Estero, Seger told the sold-out crowd: “I get to play one of my hometowns. We feel right at home here.” Seger has penned and recorded numerous songs, and they include \"Against The Wind,\" \"Hollywood Nights,\" \"Old Time Rock & Roll\" and \"Still the Same.\" Seger, 75, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nLaura Jane Grace, Naples to Gainesville to rock fame\n\nThe punk-rock star grew up in Naples and headed to Gainesville when she turned 18. Laura Jane Grace has done well since she left, recording hit albums both with Against Me! and as a solo act, including \"Stay Alive.” She’s toured the world. she wrote a critically acclaimed memoir. She's also among the first highly visible punk rock musicians to come out as transgender, which she did in 2012.\n\nMore: Laura Jane Grace: Punk-rock star talks new album, Naples and being a transgender icon\n\nAlex Lifeson, Rush guitarist lived in the 'limelight' and Naples\n\nThe longtime guitarist for the Canadian band Rush lived in Naples before moving more than a decade ago. He left not long after Collier County sheriff's deputies arrived at the beach-side Ritz-Carlton during a 2003 New Year Eve's party and used Tasers to subdue his son, Justin. Lifeson's son later sued and settled out of court. Rush has scored numerous rock hits, such as \"Limelight,\" \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Spirit of the Radio.\"\n\nDominic Fike, musician, actor on HBO's 'Euphoria'\n\nThe Naples native this past summer dropped his debut album, \"What Could Possibly Go Wrong.\" It follows singles that hit big, including \"3 Nights\" with the video on YouTube alone garnering 33 million views. Fike in 2018 signed a reported $3 million to $4 million contract with Columbia Records. And in a summer interview with the News-Press, he said he attended Naples, Estero and Palmetto Ridge high schools. He now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nJohn C. Lodge, Moody Blues bassist\n\nThe longtime Moody Blues co-founder and member lived in Bonita Springs before moving a few years ago to a high-rise condo in North Naples along the Gulf. The Moody Blues, who entered the Rock Hall in the last decade, had hits including \"Tuesday Afternoon,\" \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Nights In White Satin.\"\n\n\"The one secret about the Moody Blues is because we've written our own music, you're playing your music,\" Lodge told the Daily News in 2016.\n\n\"You're not doing any copies. You're not trying to emulate anyone else at all. So you can take your songs to, what I think, is new levels. Emotionally you can change them, from being a recording, to a live performance.\"\n\nTed Nugent, Motor City Madman also known for his politics\n\nThe Motor City Madman and his wife, Shemaine, own a Gulf-side penthouse condo in North Naples.\n\nTed Nugent has received national attention in recent years for his political commentary but he was mainly known as a musician for decades before that. His hits have included \"Cat Scratch Fever,\" \"Free‑for‑All,\" \"Wango Tango\" and \"Stranglehold.\"\n\nState of music: A look at Florida's most influential musicians\n\nHe's also a big fan of Grouper & Chips, along U.S. 41 near downtown Naples.\n\n\"The food is wonderful; the people are wonderful,\" he told the Daily News in a 2017 story.\n\n\"I’ve always loved Florida. I’ve been playing in Florida, I’ve been rocking and rolling and hunting in Florida since 1967.”\n\nDave Osborn is the regional features editor of the Naples Daily News and News-Press.
