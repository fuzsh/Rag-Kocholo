        "text": "Disco legend Donna Summer, a five-time Grammy winner with such hits as \"Last Dance,\" \"Hot Stuff\" and \"On the Radio,\" who helped define the dance music of the '70s and '80s, died Thursday at 63 after battling cancer, FOX News Channel confirmed.\n\nSummer, who was both a songwriter and singer, was believed to be in Florida at the time of her death, according to TMZ, which first reported the news. She had a beach house in Venice, Fla., south of Sarasota, CBS News reported.\n\nSummer is survived by her husband, singer and producer Bruce Sudano, their daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda, and Summer's daughter, Mimi, from a previous marriage.\n\n\"Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith,\" her family said in a statement.\n\n\"While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time.\"\n\nOften called the Queen of Disco, Summer was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines on Dec. 31, 1948, in Boston. She began singing early in the church choir and by her teens had formed several musical groups.\n\nHer first album, \"Lady of the Night,\" arrived in 1974 in Europe, and 1975's \"Love to Love You Baby\" brought her worldwide fame.\n\nIn the 1978 disco film \"Thank God it's Friday,\" her song \"Last Dance\" won Summer her first Grammy.\n\nSummer's soaring vocals on \"She Works Hard for the Money\" brought her a Best Pop Vocal Performance Award in 1984.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Summer encountered controversy when she was accused of making anti-gay comments related to AIDS. She claimed she had been misquoted but not before thousands of her records were returned and dance clubs boycotted her music.\n\nSummer holds the record for most consecutive double albums to hit number one on the Billboard charts (three) and was the first female to have four number one singles in a 12-month period: three as a solo artist and one as a duo with Barbra Streisand, CBS said."
