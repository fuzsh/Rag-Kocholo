TOKYO/OSAKA -- An Osaka futures market whose roots go back to 17th-century rice trading is quietly attempting a comeback through small-lot trading of gold, silver and platinum.

"We welcome this day with a determination to start as a new exchange," said Masashi Murata, president and CEO of Osaka Dojima Exchange, said at a news conference on Monday, the first day of trading.
