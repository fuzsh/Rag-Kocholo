        "text": "Founded in 1878, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) originally functioned as a venue where ex-samurai could exchange bonds issued by the government. As it evolved, the focus of the TSE transitioned to stock trading, and by the 1920s, this became its dominant activity.\n\nThroughout its history, spanning several decades, it has experienced significant fluctuations—from suspending operations during World War II to emerging as the largest securities exchange globally by the late 1980s.\n\nIn contemporary times, Tokyo Stock Exchange operates as a publicly traded entity under Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc., maintaining an essential position within Japan’s financial framework. It’s a very interesting exchange due to the number of listings there, which is very high.\n\nAs Japan’s principal stock exchange and one of the top five in the world by market capitalization, the Tokyo Stock Exchange is a financial leviathan that underpins the nation’s economy and draws global traders.\n\nThis article will explore the fundamental operations of the TSE, its trading hours, key listed companies, and its storied history to give you a comprehensive understanding of this powerful economic engine that rose from the ashes after WWII to get a dominant position for capitalists.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is Japan’s largest stock exchange, showcasing an extensive list of 3,784 (as of today) companies including top corporations like Toyota, and is divided into five sections for various company sizes and investor types.\n\nSeveral indices, such as TOPIX and Nikkei 225, provide benchmarks for the Japanese equity market, and the TSE employs a ‘T+2’ settlement cycle and an ‘arrowhead’ platform for high-speed trading to remain competitive.\n\nTechnological advancements at TSE include transitioning from floor trading to electronic systems and the ToSTNeT off-auction trading system, with a focus on enhancing transaction speed, efficiency, and global accessibility for investors.\n\nSeveral international brokers give access to TSE, for example, Interactive Brokers.\n\nWhat is the Tokyo Stock Exchange?\n\nSituated in Tokyo, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is Japan’s premier stock exchange and boasts an impressive roster of 3,784 companies listed as of September 2021. The number of listed companies has always been high, so you can expect many to choose from.\n\nIt falls under the auspices of the Japan Exchange Group and is home to revered Japanese entities such as Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi. The structure of this exchange comprises five distinct sections that are tailored to accommodate businesses at various sizes and growth phases. Two segments cater specifically to burgeoning startups while another is solely for well-versed professional investors.\n\nAmong its notable offerings are two indices (TOPIX and Nikkei 225) which act as key barometers for tracking the trends within Japanese equity markets by reflecting changes in performance among their listed entities.\n\nIn terms of transactional framework, TSE adheres to a “T+2” settlement cycle where trades need settling no later than two business days post-execution date. With ambitions towards bolstering its stature on an international stage amongst trading platforms, TSE has rolled out ‘arrowhead’, a system engineered for facilitating ultra-fast trading activities.\n\nHow did the Tokyo Stock Exchange start?\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was established on May 15, 1878, under the guidance of then Finance Minister Kuma Shigenobu and business magnate Shibusawa Eiichi. Originally, the exchange’s primary dealings were in government bonds along with gold and silver currency transactions that predominantly served ex-samurai who had been provided with government bonds.\n\nAs it developed, the TSE expanded into five distinct divisions to accommodate various segments within the market.

This is particularly true for inclusion in the first section.\n\nTSE leverages an off-auction transaction mechanism known as ToSTNeT (Tokyo Stock Exchange Trading NeTwork System) for its trading processes. This robust infrastructure accommodates an expanding volume of trades while distributing outcomes as actionable market information.\n\nIt facilitates various trade types such as single stock transactions, basket trading involving multiple securities simultaneously, end-of-day price-based trading activities along with off-auction buyback operations concerning own shares plus distribution outside traditional auction settings.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)?\n\nThe purpose of Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) performs a dual function of providing an environment that allows companies, including some of Japan’s leading firms, to access the public equity markets for funding, and to facilitate trading in the secondary market.

Nikkei 225 is still struggling to reach new highs even today.\n\nBelow is a chart (log scale) showing the Nikkei 225 from 1960 until today.\n\nAs you can see, after the bubble burst in 1991, the Nikkei went down for over two decades before it finally turned and went up after 2010. However, the above chart is the cash value of the index, so any reinvested dividends are not included. Hence, the performance is better than indicated! Anyway, the chart proves how long it can take if a big bubble bursts.\n\nIn recent times, there have been significant downturns such as during the global financial crisis of 2008, which saw the Nikkei plummet close to 10%, and again in March 2020 when fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a substantial sell-off.\n\nWe backtested the N225, and since 1960, the Nikkei has dropped at least ten percent over ten days 159 times.
