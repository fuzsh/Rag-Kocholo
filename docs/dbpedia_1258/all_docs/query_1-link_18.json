        "text": "The Japan Exchange Group Inc. released statements today that the Murata Manufacturing Co. Nintendo Co., and Nidec Corp will make the transition of switching their main market to Tokyo. The move will start July 16 for the merge of cash equities and trading platforms.\n\nStocks for the three companies will be moved automatically to the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, as mentioned by Japan Exchange spokesperson Miwa Aonuma. Among those listed in the TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange) first section are JIN Co, Yahoo Japan Corp, and Japan Exchange Group. All are listed on the Osaka's JASDAQ (Japanese Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation) exchange and Tokyo's main market.\n\nThe new stock exchange or bourse operator was formed early this year due to the merger of the Osaka Securities Exchange Co and that of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Group. Companies that are listed in Osaka's JASDAQ and in the TSE main market must choose between the TSE JASDAQ and the TSE main market. For shares listed in the OSE JASDAQ and in the TSE Mothers, they can select between the TSE JASDAQ or TSE Mothers."
