for fiscal 2023 (direct dialogue with rights holders)\n\nIn 2023, given the effect of COVID-19, we conducted local surveys with the cooperation of The Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain (ASSC).\n\nThe business locations surveyed by ASSC and an overview of the survey results are presented below.\n\nWe are implementing measures to address the matters indicated in the survey.\n\nEvaluation of human rights impact at MURATA ELECTRONICS SINGAPORE (PTE.) LTD. (October 2023)\n\nThis is one of Murata’s own overseas manufacturing bases, with an extremely high proportion of migrant workers.\n\nIt comprises two plants: the long-established MLCC business base and battery business base acquired in 2017.\n\nASSC checked on-site safety and health, and conducted interviews with migrant workers from China and workers commuting from Malaysia.\n\n< Overview of the survey results >\n\nIt was confirmed that the labor and living environment was explained to workers in detail during the recruitment process.\n\nIt was confirmed that fees were not charged to workers at the time of recruitment.\n\nFrom a labor safety perspective, it was pointed out that emergency evacuation routes should be presented in multiple languages and evacuation drills should be enhanced to ensure that all employees are fully prepared.\n\nEvaluation of human rights impact at Izumo Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (November 2023)\n\nThis is one of Murata’s main MLCC production bases in Japan and has a high proportion of indirectly employed workers, including foreign workers. ASSC therefore conducted discussions with our partner companies and interviews with the employees of partner companies.\n\n< Overview of the survey results >\n\nIt was confirmed that environmental measures had been taken to ensure a safe working environment.\n\nInsufficient knowledge dissemination was indicated among employees at some partner companies regarding the rules for transitioning from fixed-term contract workers to regular workers.\n\nEvaluation of human rights impact at Tohoku Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (December 2023)\n\nThis large manufacturing base was acquired through M&A in 2017. We have continuously enhanced Murata’s safety and health environment, and this survey examined the actual situation from the perspective of the workers.\n\n< Overview of the survey results >\n\nIt was confirmed that a safety and disaster prevention system has been established and occupational accidents have been mitigated.\n\nThe need was indicated to clarify the equipment inspection record and improve transparency, including open access to the inspection record, to further enhance workers’ safety.\n\nLink: Human Rights Impact Assessment Report 2023\n\nIn addition to implementing systems and mechanisms to reduce risk, we believe that it is important to train our employees whenever necessary. Toward that end, we have implemented various measures to prevent harassment, such as conducting annual harassment training for members of management and any employees that are responsible for managing a team.\n\nSince fiscal 2019, we have been using e-learning to provide all employees with annual training on our Human Rights and Labor Policies as well as on harassment of all types (including sexual harassment, workplace bullying, and SOGI* harassment). We have also been spreading awareness of our reporting service, in order to help prevent harassment. We treat these as valuable opportunities for managers and all other employees to recognize how important it is to prevent harassment. We also include temporary employees and contract employees in these efforts, with the cooperation of their companies.\n\nWe also conduct CSR-related training including human rights topics, and have established first-response guidelines on what to do if harassment may have occurred at a workplace.\n\nWe implement punishments based on disciplinary regulations if workers receive discrimination and harassments, and make public announcements based on the policy (without disclosing personal information that may aid in identification).\n\nSOGI: Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity\n\ne-learning General training Manager training New employee training Consolidated\n\n(domestic) 97.5% 97.8% - Murata\n\nManufacturing\n\nCo., Ltd. 98.7% 97.4% 99.1%\n\nEmployees only: New employee training only for sites that conduct e-learning, as e-learning is required only at some sites\n\nLecture meeting\n\nA total of 250 individuals attended a human rights lecture meeting held online for domestic employees in fiscal 2022, on the topic of \"Business and human rights - Considering the connections between human rights and business/work at Murata Manufacturing.\" During the lecture, Professor Sugawara from Osaka University of Economics and Law covered various topics including what is required of companies based on the basic concept of human rights.\n\nParticipants also attended a workshop tailored for circumstances at Murata, in which they exchanged opinions and became aware of how perspectives varied from person to person.\n\nA questionnaire was given after the lecture meeting to gather feedback from participants. Based on this feedback, participants felt that it would also have been a good opportunity for members of management to learn, that they realized how important it is to learn about human rights, and that they wanted to take what they had learned about human rights and apply it directly to future issues at manufacturing sites. This suggest that participants themselves will take the initiative to expand their learning.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, about 170 participants attended “Business and human rights - Considering the connections between human rights and business/work,” targeting human rights officers.\n\nThis lecture meeting for human rights officers invited Professor Sugawara from the Osaka University of Economics and Law to give a lecture on more specialized content, as a response to requests for more detailed information compared to the lecture meeting held in fiscal 2022 for Murata employees in Japan.\n\nOpened by Professor Sugawara’s question, “What right of whom?,” the lecture covered human rights in business settings from a global perspective, using guides for small-to-medium enterprises in EU.\n\nThis year’s meeting was held in a hybrid style, both online and face-to-face, where participants were able to deepen their knowledge by directly exchanging opinions with Professor Sugawara or communicating with each other.\n\nProfessor Sugawara also gave the lecture in English for participants from offices outside of Japan.\n\nIn the questionnaire after the lecture meeting, the following comments were given:\n\nThe lecture covered an extensive range of examples, including those from a global perspective and subjects that we see in actual life situations, which enabled us to think about human rights as something familiar and relevant. It was a very meaningful lecture.\n\n・The explanations were very relatable and easy to understand. The lecture meeting became a good opportunity to have the officers think about human rights in connection with their work.\n\nThis lecture focused on global trends and the basic concept of human rights. In future lectures, I would like to hear more about how Murata thinks about human rights and what Murata is doing on a company-wide basis in relation to human rights. Opportunities for participant discussion would also be appreciated.\n\nI could understood more, because of example of human right that related to work. Even recently we do on tract but at this time I could recognize more clearly, how activity relate to Human rights.\n\nMost participants are engaging in human rights-related work in their everyday operations, and we believe that they could apply what they learned to their work based on the feeling of agreement of this lecture.\n\nWhile this lecture meeting had many participants whose work is directly involved with human rights, there are possibly many other employees who may handle human rights issues in their day-to-day work outside of their regular responsibilities.\n\nWe will consider increasing the participation of such employees.\n\nWithin Murata\n\nEven outside the range of legal compliance, Murata is making efforts to establish corrections for long work hours.\n\nWorker fatigue can result in reduced productivity, increased turnover, and increased potential for injury and illness. We are working to reduce risks associated with overworking by providing employees with healthy lifestyles, both physically and mentally.\n\nFor example, we consider engineers working long hours to be a human rights issue, and Murata Manufacturing management is working with labor to improve and correct issues based on the labor-management agreement signed with the labor union.\n\nFor example, we established a cooperative labor and management body for discussion between labor union members, business divisions, and the HR Department. We currently monitor business plan progress and working hours every quarter, in order to prevent engineers from working long hours during busy periods in important businesses.\n\nAs a result, we were able to reduce engineer overtime in applicable departments in fiscal 2021 to 84% of that in the previous year.\n\nWe continue to monitor working hours, and take measures if any increase in overtime is discovered, such as having discussions between labor and management.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we increased paid leave for all employees by three days (Up to 23 days), in order to help reduce overall working hours.\n\nTogether with partner companies\n\nWe at Murata believe that forced labor or any other human rights violations should not happen to any of our own workers or those working on the supply chain.\n\nNotably, we have staffing and employment agencies that employ or handle foreign laborers agree to Murata’s Human Rights and Labor Policies. We also use SAQs, audits, and other measures to watch out for forced labor.\n\nWe conduct human rights and harassment prevention training through our partner companies, and have a system in place to share information on any comments, reports, or complaints regarding human rights or harassment, in order to ensure understanding and agreement with Murata's view of human rights.\n\nWe also promote processes to verify compliance with our policies and identify any potential human rights risks. Corrections are made upon our business partners’ cooperation for any cases that require correction.\n\nThrough these initiatives, we have discovered that the level of awareness for systems including maternity leave and childcare leave for foreign workers in Japan was insufficient. Even though they were capable of acquiring them, some workers did not know that they could be acquired at all. We have achieved familiarization by having business partners review education content to prevent similar cases from happening.\n\nAdditionally, we found that an agent recruiting foreign workers for our overseas factories had received deposits from workers to prevent them from canceling their travel. To prevent recurrence of this issue, we urged the agent to stop taking deposits from workers, and at the same time, interviewed the hired workers.\n\nLink: Human Rights and Labor Policies\n\nLink: EHS disaster prevention policy\n\nTogether with local residents and other rights-holders\n\nAs stated in our basic policy on social and local community contribution activities, Murata hopes to continue to be \"a company whose presence in local communities is a source of pride and joy to those communities as well as a company that our employees are proud and happy to work for.\" We consider our local communities and their residents to be important stakeholders, and promote various initiatives with this in mind.\n\nOne such initiative is that we strive to consider the impact on local communities while actively conducting local hiring to create employment in local communities.\n\nWe also provide periodic opportunities to exchange opinions with everyone in the local community in order to avoid human rights issues and other problems arising from Murata factories. If we receive complaints, we use these as opportunities for discussion. These also serve as opportunities for communication in order to prevent and correct any issues that might have a negative impact.\n\nDue to the increase in foreign workers at Murata, we dispatch Japanese language instructors to elementary schools and donate supplies for Japanese language education, to make it easier for these workers to coexist with local communities. Since we have a lot of Japanese-Brazilian workers, we also support the endowment of Portuguese language courses at local universities and donate Portuguese books to nearby libraries. At Fukui Murata Manufacturing, we are currently conducting Portuguese language lessons for employees. This has become an ambitious undertaking, with the number of employees wanting to participate exceeding the class capacity. After participating, some participants have even indicated that they intend to start greeting their coworkers in Portuguese right away!\n\nIt has become especially difficult to provide foreign workers with enough information during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to language barriers. Factors such as lifestyle differences could make it even more difficult to communicate and reach a mutual understanding with members of the local community.\n\nIn response, we employed a grievance mechanism in the form of meetings to exchange opinions in local communities, in order to obtain feedback from members of the local community. We also worked with business partners on efforts such as sharing information in workers' native languages and approaching local stores and other businesses subject to restrictions under a state of emergency.\n\nWe hope that such initiatives will lead to more active communication between our employees and foreign workers. We will continue our efforts to prevent discrimination by respecting diversity and promoting mutual understanding.\n\nWe are also promoting consideration for human rights when new worksites are constructed or worksites are expanded by conducting a variety of assessments and considering our impact on the regional environment.\n\nLink: Coexistence with society and local communities\n\nWe are working to create a workplace environment and personnel system free from discrimination, in line with the tenets of the “Human Rights and Labor” section of our CSR Charter.\n\nWe will respect the human rights of every individual and respond with dignity.\n\nWe will prohibit forced labor, and will not permit any child labor be involved in any of our processes.\n\nWe are completely uninvolved in human trafficking. We have confirmed that there is no risk of human trafficking in any of our processes.\n\nWe comply with laws and regulations. We have also received no warnings from supervisory authorities with regard to major violations of the Labor Standards Act.\n\nWe are working to go beyond the standards stipulated by law for working hours, holidays, rest periods, and minimum wage.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly informed about wage structures and personnel systems, and wages are paid regularly in full and on time. Also, deductions are detailed in pay stubs.\n\nIn accordance with the laws of each country in which we are involved, we will respect the right of free association and the right of workers to join labor unions, etc. and we will facilitate free communication between workers and unions. Moreover, even in countries and regions where the formation of labor unions is not allowed under the laws, etc. of each country, we strive to promote problem-solving through dialog between labor and management, which is the objective of executing the rights appended to the freedom of association and labor unions, etc. The union participation rate of each union belonging to the Murata Manufacturing Group Labor Union Association is 82.5% (As of March 31, 2024).\n\nIn consultation with labor unions and employee representatives, we pay the wages necessary to maintain a standard of living.\n\nWe do not discriminate against women in our personnel system, including the wage system. Regarding the issue of equal pay for equal work, we respect and comply with locally applied laws.\n\nWe strive to reduce overwork so that employees may lead a life which is mentally and physically healthy.\n\nWe conduct visiting classes so that foreign immigrant workers will properly understand their rights.\n\nWe do not charge fees, security deposits, or any other kind of money, regardless of the means or under any name. If any such fees are found to have been paid by workers, such fees shall be repaid to the worker. Using audits and other procedures, we confirm that these policies are also being followed by our recruitment agencies, contractors, and supply chains.\n\nBased on Murata’s philosophy of Equity, we take reasonable accommodation for recruitment, wages, promotions, remunerations, and education training. (Example: Applying subtitles during promotion selections for employees with hearing impairments, etc.)\n\nDuring the last 12 months, there were not any public demonstrations, protests, or adverse media reports involving your facility’s operations or business conduct.\n\nIn addition, in order to boost our employees’ awareness of human rights, we have translated our Human Rights and Labor Policies from Japanese to both English and Chinese, and are conducting human rights education as part of our stratified education programs. Our investigation was unable to find any incidents involving child labor or forced labor in any of our business sites or plants, including overseas.\n\nTo abolish child labor, we have identification check during employment. for preventions.\n\nComparison between standard minimum wage versus regional minimum wage (Murata Manufacturing)\n\nRegional minimum wage 156,761 yen Standard minimum wage 184,500 yen Percentage of regional minimum wage 118%\n\n* Value for major manufacturing sites. Not an average.\n\n* As of March 31, 2024"
