        "text": "In November 2015, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), Deutsche Borse (DB) and China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX) set up a joint venture â China Europe International Exchange AG (CEINEX). Positioning itself as a trading and pricing center in Europe for offshore Renminbi assets, CEINEX will cater to the needs of investors for Renminbi financing and investments, build a comprehensive risk management platform and become a key overseas extension of and supplement to the domestic capital markets. On October 24, 2018, Qingdao Haier was listed on the D-share market of the Frankfurt-based CEINEX, signaling the official launch of the D-share market and representing a breakthrough for China in building an offshore market in Europe for Chinese blue-chips. As of the end of June 2019, 44 spot products have been listed on CEINEX for trading, including 1 stock, 16 ETFs, and 27 bonds. On February 20, 2017, CEINEX debuted futures contracts on Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 ETF, and is actively working on more derivatives based on key indices in the Chinese mainland as well as on its own spot market products.
