        "text": "A stock exchange is a regulated marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade financial instruments, primarily stocks or shares of publicly traded companies. A stock exchange acts as an intermediary, facilitating the exchange of ownership and providing liquidity to investors who want to buy or sell shares.\n\nA stock exchange serves as a central platform to facilitate the buying and selling of securities through a network of brokers. A stock can only be exchanged, sold, or bought if it is listed in the stock market. Each country has their own stock exchanges where they can sell and buy stocks. Market identifier code also known as MIC is the unique short form given to each stock exchange.\n\nThe New York stock exchange is the largest in the world. The MIC of the New York stock exchange is XYNS. The New York stock exchange is situated in North America. The NASDAQ is another stock exchange situated in North America. The MIC is XNAS. The NASDAQ is the world’s second-biggest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization. The Shanghai stock exchange is situated in the mainland of China. The MIC is XSHG.\n\nThe stock market or the share market is the cluster of buyers and sellers of stock which represent ownership claims on businesses that include securities listed on a public stock exchange.\n\nWhat is the stock exchange?\n\nA stock exchange is a digital or physical place where we can sell or buy stock or shares. The term stock represents the share in the company’s ownership and its earnings and assets. Stockholders are partial owners of the company.\n\nThe price of each stock is determined by the supply and demand and investors’ sentiment and both domestic and international economies. The stock market is now available in every part of the world but the first exchange was established in Amsterdam in the 17th century.\n\nMarket capitalization is the total value of a company that is traded. It is obtained by multiplying the total number of stocks and the present price of the stock. 19 stock exchanges in the world have over 1 trillion market capitalization. They are commonly referred to as “the one trillion clubs”. They added up to 87% of the global market capitalization.\n\nThe stock exchange has mainly two important purposes. Firstly it helps major companies who are enlisted in the stock market to raise capital from the public or traders by offering shares of the company for sale and this capital can be used for expanding their business and also fund themselves. Secondly, it helps the local investors to buy stocks of these companies and an opportunity to have a share in this company’s profit.\n\nCompanies that are enlisted in the stock market must give a lot of information to their investors about their business. The companies should also provide quarterly and annual financial reports. This information along with other important news items disclosed as they occur helps investors to know more about the company they want to invest in. The working of the stock market is closely associated with the action of the bear and bull markets. The market is highly fluctuating. Sometimes the market value is rising and sometimes it’s falling. The bear market represents the falling market and the bull represents the rising market.\n\nThe stock exchange acts as an economic barometer as it helps to indicate the state of the economy. It observes all the major and minor changes in the economy. The stock exchange also helps in the valuation of securities based on the factors of supply and demand.\n\nThe valuation helps the investors to work accordingly because high-profiting and growing companies or stocks are highly valued. Transactions are strictly regulated in the stock exchange. All the listed companies should follow the rules and regulations as laid out by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.\n\nStock exchange helps in the process of growth of the economy because the process of stock exchange involves disinvesting and reinvesting which offers an opportunity for capital formation. The stock market allows better capital allocation of the investors so that they can maximize their profit. The stock market also encourages investment and savings.\n\nA portfolio is a collection of financial assets and investment tools that are held by an individual, a financial institution, or an investment firm. It is always ideal to diversify your portfolio for increasing your profit and investment security.\n\nWhat are the major stock exchanges?\n\nThere are about 60 major global stock exchanges in the world that range from the New York Stock Exchange to the private sector Stock Exchange. They differ in size and trading volume.\n\nThe New York stock exchange is the biggest and largest stock exchange which has a market capitalization of 22.7 trillion USD. The New York Stock Exchange is also known as THE BIG BOARD. The next top 3 stock exchanges are the NASDAQ( National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ), The Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Euronext.\n\nNasdaq is also situated in New York. It has a market cap of 18.0 trillion USD. The Shanghai stock exchange is situated in China and has a market cap of 7.26 trillion us dollars. Euronext is situated in Europe ( Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Milan, Oslo, and Paris ). The market cap of Euronext is 6.62 trillion USD.\n\nThe Bombay stock exchange (BSE) is the biggest in India with a market cap of 3.5 trillion USD. The stocks that are exchanged in the stock market are of different types. The major 19 types are listed below. Common Stock, Preferred stocks, Large cap stocks, Mid-cap stocks, Small cap stocks, Domestic stocks, International stocks, Growth stocks, Value stocks, IPO stocks, Dividend stocks, Non Dividend stocks, Income stocks, Cyclical stocks, Noncyclic stocks, Safe stocks, ESG stocks, Blue chip stocks, Penny stocks.\n\nThere are 7 major stock exchanges in India. NSE and BSE are the two leading stock exchanges in India. There are 23 working stock exchanges in India Stock exchanges ensure the liquidity of financial securities and widespread investor participation in the stock market.
