In his Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics (291, 21–292, 31 Diels = Posid.

Here Posidonius deals with the distinction between philosophy and the special sciences. Although Posidonius enters into a rich debate of his day, I believe it would be legitimate to include Epicurus and his doctrine of multiple explanations among Posidonius’ potential polemical targets.",
