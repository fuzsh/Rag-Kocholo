        "text": "Born around 334 BC, Zeno of Citium was a philosopher, teaching in Athens. He studied, developed, and taught philosophy, and eventually went on to found Stoicism, based on the concepts of morality explored by the Cynics.\n\nZeno wanted to bring some of these moralistic ideas to a modern philosophy that focused on allowing people to live their best lives, based around the concept of \"virtue\" and achieving a higher-state of peace and mental clarity. Through his teachings, Stoicism became very popular.\n\nDiogenes was the head of the Stoic school in Athens and eventually sent to Rome in 155 BC to teach Stoicism and spread the Philosophy.\n\nDiogenes delivered speeches, and even addressed the Senate. His name comes up a lot in the history of Stoicism, and his quotes have been rewritten by subsequent Stoics, but his first-hand writings never survived.\n\nAfter learning Stoic philosophy under Panaetius, Posidonius went travelling, writing and lecturing on Stoicism. Whilst none of these writings exist today, he proved to be very influential for subsequent Stoics and his teachings are referenced in numerous places.\n\nThe Roman statesman, Cicero, considered Posidonius to be a great teacher and a close friend.\n\nHis full name was Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, but as that's a mouthful, he is most commonly known as simply, Seneca. Born in 4 BC, Seneca was a Roman statesman and Philosopher.\n\nYou can read some of his teachings in Letters From a Stoic.\n\nEpictetus was a Greek philosopher born into slavery around 50 AD. He was eventually freed from slavery, and lived in Rome until he was later banished to Greece.\n\nEpictetus taught Stoicism as a means to live ones life, and not just as an intellectual or theoretical set of principles to be debated and discussed. He believed them and followed them rigidly.\n\nSome of his teachings survive in several books, such as Discourses and the Enchiridion, but the work of Epictetus also later inspired Marcus Aurelius.\n\nMarcus Aurelius (or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) was emperor of Rome and one of the most famous Stoic philosophers. He is considered to be a fairly progressive emperor, and is considered one of the last of the \"Five Good Emperors\".\n\nMarcus is famous for his diary, published as \"Meditations\". Despite being very old, and from a time very different to our own, these texts have aged very well and have helped to form the principles of modern Stoicism, and influences many Stoics and non-Stoics alike."
