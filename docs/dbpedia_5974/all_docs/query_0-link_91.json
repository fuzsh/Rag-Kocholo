        "text": "Much has been written as of late on the characteristic and influential philosophical school of thought called Stoicism which was originally founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the second century BCE and further fleshed out and promulgated by Cleanthes and then subsequently by his student Chrysippus, collectively referred to in modern classical studies as the Old Stoa. This work intends to try and provide a succinct overview of the philosophical tenets which were characteristic of the school in the early period as well as identify some unique contributions of the later Stoa which are represented by the Roman/Latin intellectual and politically elite such as Seneca, Cicero and the emperor Marcus Aurelius. The paper also reviews some of the earlier Hellenic philosophical traditions from which it Stoicism drew some of its primary tenets and evolved in conjunction with, as well as in the Summary provide an overview of some of the lasting contributions Stoicism has made to the development of the philosophical and theological tradition in the West. Although none of the complete writings and treatises written by the Old Stoa are extant, much of their philosophical tenets are covered by later authors and philosophers whose work is and this article draws on some of these what you might call pseudo-primary sources (in particular Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius) as well as various secondary, more contemporary sources who draw not only on these sources but also extensively from Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta which is an invaluable collection of fragments and quotations of the early Stoa composed in the early part of the 20 th century and from which much of what we know about specific tenets of at least early Stoic philosophy come from.\n\nThis article examines the reception of Stoicism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from Justus Lipsius to Immanuel Kant. It considers topics often associated with Stoicism during the period, notably the interconnected concepts of fate, necessity, and providence, as well as the rise and development of scholarship on Stoicism during the period. While this was an especially rich period for the reception of Stoicism, more often than not the Stoics found themselves drawn into contemporary disputes, such as the potentially atheistic conclusions of Spinoza's philosophy. At the same time, it saw a shift away from seeing Seneca as the pre-eminent Stoic and towards the systematic philosophy of Zeno and Chrysippus.\n\nThis paper attempts to reconstruct the views of the Stoic Posidonius on the emotions, especially as presented by Galen's On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato. This is a well-studied area, and many views have been developed over the last few decades. It is also significant that the reliability of Galen's account is openly at issue. Yet it is not clear that the interpretative possibilities have been fully demarcated. Here I develop Galen's claim that Posidonius accepted a persistent, non-rational aspect of the soul that he connects with the merely animal part of humans. The aim is to begin from this testimony in answering two questions: (1) How might the possession of a non-rational element of the soul operate alongside the hêgemonikon (leading-part of the soul) as a source of impulse for Posidonius. (2) How does this persistent animal aspect conform to the Stoic ontological classification found in their scala naturae? I shall argue in response to these that (a) Posidonius distinguished the merely cognitive aspects of the soul from those that are rational, and (b) that the hêgemonikon itself is not to be identified with what is rational. Accepting a persistent non-rational source of emotional impulses allows Posidonius a richer framework for explaining human affective responses and behaviours. I also briefly address Galen's motivation for the account he offers. It is in view of Posidonius' approach to Plato's Timaeus that Galen's discussion finds its most plausible interpretation.\n\nThe philosophical problem of universals has endured since ancient times, and can have metaphysical or epistemic connotations, depending upon the philosopher in question. I intend to show in this essay that both Plato’s and the Stoics’ theories of universals were not only derived from, but were ‘in the grip’ of their epistemological and metaphysical philosophies respectively; and were thus vulnerable to methodological criticism. I propose to first outline the three alternative theories of Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics; and then to suggest that Aristotle’s theory, whilst developed as a criticism of Plato’s theory, stands more robustly on its own merits.\n\nIn the remit of philosophical inquiry, this research attempts to highlight the philosophy of education found in Stoicism and to discover a possible relationship between Stoicism and the Ethics Education subject. To pursue this dissertation, three research questions will be explored: what are the main philosophical ideas of Stoicism including its ethics and education?; what is the contribution of the Stoics to the philosophy of education?; and how do Stoic philosophical ideas feature in the SEC Ethics syllabus? Moreover, the research will be formed around these three questions, and a chapter is allotted for each question. In chapter 1, Stoicism as a Lifelong Education, Stoicism (including its philosophy of education and ethical theory) is introduced, giving a framework of the Stoic philosophy with an emphasis on primary texts. In chapter 2, Stoicism in the Philosophy of Education, the focus turns to the philosophy of education found in the Stoics’ teachings. By referring to different philosophers and theorists, this chapter presents secondary literature that elicits the philosophy of education found within Stoic texts, as well as contextualising Stoicism within the history of the philosophy of education. Chapter 3, Stoicism and the Secondary Ethics Syllabus, explores the parallels between Stoicism and the Ethics SEC syllabus, i.e. the different themes in the Ethics syllabus that are in line with the Stoic philosophy. Moreover, this chapter aims to discern the position of Ethics Education from a Stoic point of view. Ultimately, through the use of primary and secondary texts, this dissertation identifies the role played by the Stoics in the history of the philosophy of education and to discover the connections and philosophical relations between Stoicism and Ethics Education."
