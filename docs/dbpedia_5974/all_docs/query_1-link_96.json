        "text": "This project started almost as a game in 2.002, and from then to 2.007, totally alone and self-taught, I designed up to five different versions of the Glory of Rome, with the small satisfaction of having been the first internet recommendation in a special publication of Rome from the magazine Muy Interesante (Autumn 2.004).\n\nFrom that moment, due to the vicissitudes of life and, above all, the difficulties in recycling my knowledge of web design, it had been abandoned in the great ocean of the Internet waiting for a resurgence. I never stopped renewing the annual contracts to keep the web open, even though year after year it seemed more outdated, and for some people it was an unnecessary expense. I always hoped to return to work where I left it off with the illusion of turning into reality what my imagination projected.\n\nFinally, I had to leave in the hands of a team of young professionals the development of a design adapted to the new times and with a look to the future.\n\nThe truth is that I am proud to contribute my grain of sand to the knowledge of the greatest story ever told, the glorious and epic history of our ancestors, whose legacy we should all be proud of.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude for the help received in this latest version. To my father, Valentin, whose wisdom and knowledge of the Greco-Roman world, art and religious history have always been a source of inspiration for me, and he has collaborated decisively by writing several sections of outstanding quality. To my mother, Irene, for stoically resisting her husband's absence for many nights because of me while working in his sections. To my wife, Raquel, her love of photography and her skills with retouching have given a special brilliance to the image of the web, and her resistance has also been stoic for many nights. To Leo, my lifelong friend, for his support and for always believing in this project, and who has given us a magnificent section on law; after years of persecuting him for it, I can say that I have achieved it. To Charlie, for offering me his talent and putting music to this dream. To Xavi, for lending me a handful of good photographs of the confines of the Empire. To my father-in-law, Joaquin, who has given me a beautiful drawing of a Roman camp, and I feel that I still haven't taken enough advantage of his talent.\n\nI would like to interact with you, the readers, through Instagram. It will depend on the success of the audience that I can devote more or less time to it, but the final idea is that everything you want to find about Rome you can find it here, in the Glory of Rome.\n\nIf you want to collaborate with the resurgence of this project you can share your ideas with me. You can also contribute financially. Any help will be more than welcome to definitively consolidate this project over time.\n\nEduardo Ortiz Pardina\n\nWinter 2.019"
