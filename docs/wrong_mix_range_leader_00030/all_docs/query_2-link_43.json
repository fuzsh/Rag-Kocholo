Patterns of Regime and Leadership Change in the Third World This Reference Aid examines patterns of regime and leadership change in the Third World since 1955. It is based on a computerized chronology of leadership and regime changes in 101 countries with populations greater than 1 million. To illustrate the versatility of our data base, we included a series of graphics in this paper that track levels of regime and leadership change over time, regime duration, and mechanisms of regime change in specific regions-Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Near East-South Asia, and East Asia-and in the Third World as a whole. The data base, the chronologies, and the maps are current through 30 June 1986, but, for presentational purposes, the other graphics are current only through the end of 1985. The data base is maintained by the Political Instability Branch in the Office of Global Issues and can be accessed on any IBM personal computer. Analysts are encouraged to exploit the data base in conducting their research.

A process by which the structure of the government in power is removed and replaced by another form of government, as when a military junta over- throws a democratic government and establishes a military dictatorship. Regime Type Democratic. A presidential or parliamentary system characterized by open elections, lawful transitions of power, broad suffrage, and a political opposition that has relatively equal opportunity for gaining power through elections. Military Authoritarian. A government headed by a military officer or junta that has come to power by means of a coup or other violent means, a fraudulent election, or succession from a previous military leader. Civilian Authoritarian. A government led by an individual or group of civilians who gained power through violent means, a fair or fraudulent election, or succession, and who rule without reference to constitutional procedures. This category includes monarchies and theocracies as well as civilian dictatorships and single-party regimes. Marxist-Leninist. A government led by one or more avowed Marxist- Leninists or a group dominated by Marxist-Leninists who gained power through a fair or fraudulent election, succession, a coup, or political violence. Mechanisms of Independence. A transition from possession or protectorate status to full Regime Change political autonomy. Constitutional. A transition from one leader or governing group to another characterized by lawful and constitutionally approved procedures. Government Fiat. An arbitrary order or decree made by the existing government that changes the nature of the government, often giving the leader or leaders extraordinary powers. Military Coup. A violent overthrow of the existing leadership-by a group led by or closely associated with the military-that results in a government dominated by the military. Other. Includes leadership changes that are the result of revolution, civil war, or foreign intervention. vi .

Latin America is the only region that has deviated significantly from this trend, reflecting a surge in the number of democratic govern- ments during the past five years. Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced the greatest turnover in both regimes and leadership during the last 30 years. The Near East-South Asian and East Asian regions have experienced the fewest changes. Regime Types As of 31 December 1985, of the 101 Third World countries in our data base, more than 25 percent of the regimes were democratic, 40 percent were civilian authoritarian, less than 20 percent were military authoritar- ian, and about 15 percent were Marxist-Leninist. These percentages are the result of significant shifts in numbers during the past three decades (figure 1): ? The number of civilian authoritarian regimes had increased steadily since the mid-to-late 1950s but since 1973 has declined to about 40 percent. This category had accounted for approximately 45 percent of all Third World regime types since the early 1960s. ? Democratic regimes have maintained a relatively constant share of the total-about 25 percent-except for a surge in the early 1960s when many African states became independent. ? The proportion of military authoritarian regimes grew in the 1960s and early 1970s, accounting for as much as 20 percent of all regimes since 1955. Since 1974 the category's proportion has been declining. ? Marxist-Leninist regimes have gradually increased since 1955 but still account for only a small proportion of the total. Since 1968, there has been a clearly discernible inverse relation between democratic and military regimes, with both types fluctuating between one- fifth and one-third of the total. Frequency of Change The overall number of regime changes in the Third World has steadily declined since 1965 (figure 2). From 1960 to 1965, 72 regime changes occurred, compared with 28 in the early 1980s. The decrease results from the establishment and persistence of constitutional regimes in Latin America as well as the relative stability of regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Latin America has experienced more leadership changes than any other region-averaging 15 changes per country since 1955. Near East-South Asia has accounted for the fewest changes- averaging six per country over the past 30 years. Regime Change Over the last three decades, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced the by Region greatest number of regime changes (109), followed by Latin America (90). The Near East-South Asia and East Asia regions, respectively, have recorded significantly fewer regime changes (63 and 46). Since the mid-1970s, Latin America has seen a dramatic increase in the number of regime changes, while the number of such changes in the Near East-South Asia and East Asia-especially during the past five years- has dropped markedly (figure 3). Most of the changes in Latin America have been in democratic regimes; in Sub-Saharan Africa most of the changes have been in civilian authoritarian regimes. Mechanisms of Independence was the primary mechanism of regime change in the Third Regime Change World from 1955 to 1965. In the mid-1970s, constitutional transitions and military coups took the lead, accounting for more than four-fifths of all re- gime changes (figure 4). While the significant proportion of military coups has remained constant, the proportion of constitutional transitions has fluctuated widely, accounting for from as little as 14 percent of all changes in any five-year period to more than 40 percent in others. Regime change by government fiat has consistently accounted for 15 percent of all regime changes throughout the period of this study. Frequency of Coups Although the frequency of coups has been declining in all four regions since the early 1970s, the Near East-South Asia and East Asia regions stand out as the least coup-prone (figure 5), with five in any five-year period in East Asia and six in the Near East-South Asian region. Our data base shows: ? Latin America accounting for 35 percent of all Third World coups, while comprising more than 20 percent of the countries. The frequency of coups in this region has declined sharply, however, from a high of 13 in the early 1960s to only three in the early 1980s. ? Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for about 33 percent of all coups, while comprising 37 percent of the countries. As is the case with Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa has shown a dramatic decline in the frequency of coups, decreasing from a high of 12 in the early 1970s to only five in the early 1980s.

The Near East-South Asia region accounting for about 25 percent of all Third World coups, while comprising 28 percent of the countries. ? East Asia accounting for only 10 percent of all Third World coups, while comprising 13 percent of the countries. Durability of Regimes This measure compares the longevity and durability of the four general regime types (figure 6). Military authoritarian regimes constitute the largest number of regimes in our data base, but they tend to be the least durable. Conversely, Marxist-Leninist regimes are few in number but by far the most durable: ? Only about 10 percent of all military regimes have lasted more than 10 years, fewer than 40 percent have remained in power for five years. ? Democratic and civilian authoritarian regimes have fared much better; both regime types have a significant proportion-well over one-fourth- and have remained in power for more than 10 years. ? Marxist-Leninist regimes account for less than 5 percent of all regimes, and all of the regimes have been in power for at least six years.

It includes 718 entries. Information was collected from a variety of unclassified sources, such as Facts on File and The New York Times Index, and verified by analysts in the Office of Leadership Analysis and in the appropriate regional offices. The data base consists of a textual chronology of each event (organized by region) and a series of numerically coded computer entries that correspond to the chronologies. The computer package is compatible with the standard IBM personal computer. Leadership changes are coded by the cause of the change (such as coup, as- sassination, and loss of parliamentary support) and the mechanism by which the new leader is selected (election, succession, imposition by the military, and so forth). Elections are termed fraudulent if the sources are in general agreement that the outcome was manipulated by such actions as ballot box stuffing, selling votes, misrepresenting the vote count, or preventing eligible voters from casting ballots. In addition, both the process of change and the selection mechanisms are aggregated to facilitate the sorting of scheduled versus unscheduled changes, as well as constitutional versus illegal selection mechanisms. Each leadership change is recorded with the regime type noted. Regime changes are aggregated into three broad categories-authoritarian, demo- cratic, and oligarchic-and then divided into more discrete groups. In addition, each event is coded by region, subregion, country, date, and duration. In cases where the type of regime changed but the leader did not, the regime change is entered as a new event. The data base can be used to: ? Answer historical questions about leadership succession. ? Generate a list of coups by region, date, and the ranks of the officers involved. ? Develop a subset of events to test, for example, whether links exist between corruption and instability. ? Determine the frequency of coups versus other kinds of leadership changes over the last three decades.

Generate a list of heads of state who have been assassinated or died in office. ? Sort scheduled versus unschedulded, or constitutional versus unconstitu- tional leadership changes. The data also are entered in an SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) file, allowing an analyst to perform simple sorting and crosstab operations as well as more sophisticated statistical manipulations, includ- ing correlation and regression analysis.

The number of leadership changes has also declined-albeit less dramati- cally. These trends-as well as the decline in the number of military coups-are consistent with overall Third World patterns. Latin America is unique, however, in the surge of transfers to civilian rule noted during the past five years. Regime Types Latin American regimes have become predominantly democratic in recent years. As of June 1986, 15 of the 22 Latin American countries in our data base were classified as democratic regimes (figure 7). By comparison, less than one-fifth was military regimes-including the junta now governing Haiti. Mexico represents the only civilian authoritarian regime, and Cuba and Nicaragua the only Marxist-Leninist regimes in the region. Over the past three decades, the number of democratic and military regimes has varied inversely, reflecting much the same pattern observed for the Third World as a whole (figure 8). Since the mid-1970s, the number of military regimes has been decreasing sharply, while the number of democratic regimes has been increasing. Both civilian authoritarian and Marxist-Leninist regimes have persisted at low levels. Civilian authoritarian regimes generally have accounted for from less than 5 percent to a high of 25 percent of all Latin American re- gimes. The Marxist-Leninist camp has been represented by Cuba, and more recently by Nicaragua. Frequency of Changes The numbers of regime and leadership changes in Latin America declined sharply from the mid-1950s until the mid-1970s but have increased steadily since then-a trend that runs counter to the general pattern in the Third World (figure 9). Most of the regime and leadership changes in the last 10 years, however, have been achieved by constitutional means as more countries adopted democratic forms of government (figure 10). Mechanisms of Since 1956, 85 percent of all regime changes in Latin America have been Regime Change by either constitutional means or military coup. Both means of regime change have varied widely over the last 30 years, with constitutional transition undergoing the greater fluctuations. The number of military coups in Latin America has declined sharply, particularly over the last five years. In general, coups by general officers have outnumbered coups by lower-grade officers, but only by a narrow margin (figure 10).

One-third of all Latin American military regimes have remained in power for less than a year, and nearly three-quarters of them have lasted for no more than three years. Only one-sixth of them lasted longer than 10 years. Latin American democratic regimes, like their military counterparts, have accounted for more than 25 percent of all regimes in power in Latin America since 1955, and they have been more durable. In fact, three democratic regimes-in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela-have remained in power for more than 25 years. Moreover, Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago have enjoyed democratic rule since gaining their indepen- dence in the early 1960s. Of the civilian authoritarian regimes, only three-Mexico, Nicaragua, and Haiti-held power for more than 25 years, and two of these-Nicaragua and Haiti-are no longer in power. Of the Marxist-Leninist countries, Cuban President Castro has remained in power for more than 25 years and the Sandinista Directorate in Nicaragua for over six years.

Nearly two-thirds of the newly independent African regimes began as democracies, but only a handful of these democracies remain. Sub-Saharan African regimes have experienced the greatest turnover in the Third World, but the pace of change has slowed considerably in recent years. For example, the number of Marxist-Leninist regimes in the region grew rapidly in the 1970s but has not increased since 1979. Regime Types Civilian authoritarian governments became the dominant regime type in 1965 and remain so to this day (figure 14). As of June 1986, one-half of all regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa were civilian authoritarian. Democratic and military regimes, respectively, account for about one-tenth and one- fifth of all regimes in the region. More than one-tenth of all Sub-Saharan African regimes are Marxist-Leninist. Democratic regimes were well represented in the early 1960s, accounting for over one-half of all regimes in the region. Since then, the proportion of democratic regimes has declined to about one-tenth. As is the case in Latin America, the number of military regimes has varied inversely with democratic regimes since the late 1960s. The number of military regimes peaked at 16 in 1974 but has declined markedly since then. The first Marxist-Leninist regime came to power in Benin only in 1972. Congo, Mozambique, Angola, and Ethiopia joined the Marxist-Leninist camp in the middle and late 1970s, and all remain in power. Frequency of Change During the period from mid-1950 to 1970 the level of regime change remained fairly constant, while the number of leadership changes varied from a low of 17 (1956-60) to a high of 45 (1966-70) (figure 15). From 1981-85, the number of regime changes slowed appreciably, dropping from 20 to 10 per year, but the number of leadership changes remained high. Mechanisms of Independence was the dominant means of regime change in Africa until Regime Change the mid-1960s. Since then, military coups and government-fiated changes have come to dominate (figure 16). From 1956 to 1965, independence accounted for about 60 percent of all regime change. Thereafter, indepen- dence declined as a major factor of regime change, with Djibouti and Zimbabwe achieving independence in 1977 and 1980, respectively.

Neither general officers' nor junior officers' coups have tended to dominate, although the former have outnumbered the latter over the past decade. Durability of Regimes More than one-third of all African regimes during the past 30 years have been civilian authoritarian; they also have tended to be the most durable in the Third World, with nearly half of the civilian authoritarian regimes remaining in power for 10 years or more (figure 17). Democratic regimes have accounted for more than one-fourth of all regimes in Africa, but only one-fifth of these have remained in power for 10 or more years. Marxist- Leninist regimes conform to the general Third World pattern-few in number, but highly durable. All five Marxist-Leninist regimes have been in power for at least six years. By contrast, military authoritarian regimes account for nearly one-third of all African regimes, and slightly more than half have lasted for five years or more.

This regime type accounts for approximately two-thirds of all regimes in the region; many countries have experienced only civilian authoritarian rule. This continuity of regime type-and leadership-has made the Near East-South Asia region the most politically consistent in the Third World. Since 1981, the region, which includes 28 countries, has experienced only three regime changes and 13 leadership changes. As of June 1986, military authoritarian and democratic regimes accounted for slightly more than half of all regime types. Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, India, and Sri Lanka were the only democratic regimes in the region, and Afghanistan and South Yemen the only Marxist-Leninist regimes (figure 19). The number of civilian authoritarian regimes increased slowly during the 1960s and reached a high of 23 in 1972 and 1973 (figure 20). The patterns of both regime change and leadership change have been relatively erratic, although the number of regime changes has decreased steadily in the last 15 years from a high of 13 in the early 1970s to only three in the early 1980s (figure 21). The number of leadership changes has fluctuated more widely over the last three decades, but has shown a marked decrease in recent years. Mechanisms of Almost two-thirds of all regime changes-in the Near East-South Asia Regime Change region have been by authoritarian means (figure 22). Military coups have accounted for a gradually increasing share of all regime changes since the mid-1950s, while the number of regime changes by government fiat has been declining. Since the mid-1960s, more than two-thirds of all coups in the region have been launched by officers below the rank of general. Durability of Regimes Civilian authoritarian regimes have been long lived, with one-fifth remain- ing in power for more than 10 years (figures 23 and 24). About one-fourth of the civilian authoritarian regimes have been monarchies-the most stable regime type in the Third World. Military authoritarian regimes, on the other hand, have been highly unstable. Although these regimes account for more than one-third of all regimes during the past 30 years, only one-fourth has stayed in power beyond five years-most notably in Libya and Pakistan. The record for democratic regimes is mixed. While a handful of regimes- for example, in Algeria and Syria-have lasted two years or less, some regimes, including Israel and India, have lasted much longer.

Democratic regimes are also well represented, and the number of Marxist-Leninist regimes has increased significantly since the mid-1970s. Regime Types Civilian authoritarian regimes represent almost 30 percent of all regimes in the region (figure 26). The number of military regimes peaked in the mid- to-late 1960s, but since then has steadily declined to two in the early 1980s. As of June 1986, Marxist-Leninist regimes represented more than one- third of all regimes in the region, and democratic regimes just over one-fifth. Before 1975, the only Marxist-Leninist regimes were North Korea and North Vietnam. By 1977, South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia had become Marxist, replacing authoritarian governments. After declining in the latter part of the 1950s, the number of democratic regimes in East Asia remained steady over the last three decades. Frequency of Changes The frequency of regime change in East Asia has shown a general pattern of decline, with a high of 13 regime changes recorded from 1961 to 1965 and a low of two from 1981 to 1985. The frequency of leadership change has varied more widely, declining from 20 in the late 1970s to eight in the early 1980s (figure 27). Mechamisms of Half of all regime changes in East Asia have resulted from coups or Regime Changes government fiat; constitutional transitions account for only one-third of all regime changes. Over the past decade, however, constitutional change was the primary mechanism of regime change (figure 28). Durability of Regimes Civilian authoritarian regimes generally have proved to be durable in East Asia, with more than 20 percent lasting for 10 years or more (figures 29 and 30). Conversely, military regimes, which have constituted nearly 30 percent of all East Asian regimes during the past 30 years, have been highly unstable. Only in Burma and Thailand have military regimes remained in power for more than 10 years.

On the other hand, democratic rule has been short lived in some countries-lasting less than two years, for example, in South Korea and Thailand. The Marxist-Leninist regimes have proved exceptionally stable. The North Korean and Vietnamese regimes have been in power for more than 25 years, and the Marxist regimes in Laos and Cambodia have been in power for 10 years or more.
