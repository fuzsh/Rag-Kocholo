        "text": "\"Poggo, a refugee from the southern Sudan, adds to knowledge of this war-torn country with a detailed account of the first civil war between the north and the south, which raged between 1955 and 1972. The discussion is distinguished by some fine firsthand reports by southern participants and a full consideration of external forces, which included Egypt, other Arab nations, neighboring African states, the Soviet Union, and the U.S. Recommended.\" - CHOICE\n\n\"An essential contribution to historical scholarship on the politics of Sudan s armed conflicts and peace agreements. Poggo provides extraordinary detail in documenting southerners resistance to, and experiences of, repression, violence and collective punishment at the hands of Sudanese government leaders and their security forces. Through extensive use of oral accounts given by southern Sudanese political and military protagonists, testimonials from foreign missionaries, and rare archival documents gleaned in private collections scattered across the world, Poggo has produced a text that writes the turbulent and uneven process of southern Sudanese identity formation into the larger body of African political history.\" - Sudan Studies Association Bulletin\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 42.79\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 53.49\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 53.49\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access\n\nLicence this eBook for your library\n\nInstitutional subscriptions"
