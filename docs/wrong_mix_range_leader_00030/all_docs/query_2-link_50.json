        "text": "Despite close ties in the 1950s and 1960s, an almost complete rupture in relations between Israel and African states occurred around the oil crisis and Yom Kippur War in 1973, over Israel’s captured land and the Palestinian issue. Relations had gradually been restored by the 1990s, but Africa was still generally neglected by Israeli policymakers. Since 2016 Israel has pursued a more visible and vigorous African engagement strategy; a diplomatic drive that was to culminate in the first Africa–Israel Summit in Togo, in October 2017 (since postponed). This paper approaches Israel’s push into the continent from an African perspective in an effort to highlight what African leaders can gain from Israel, and vice versa. Despite successfully courting East African countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda, Israel has a long way to go to show African leaders how they will benefit from closer ties. Although Israel does face objections from regional powerhouses, including South Africa and Ni...\n\nDuring a turbulent colonial and postcolonial century, African women struggled to control their own marital, sexual and economic lives and to gain a significant voice in local and national politics. This book introduces students to many remarkable women, who organized religious and political movements, fought in anti-colonial wars, ran away to escape arranged marriages, and during the 1990s began successful campaigns for gender parity in national legislatures. The book also explores the apparent paradox in the conflicting images of African women - as singularly oppressed and dominated by men, but also as strong, resourceful, and willing to challenge governments and local traditions to protect themselves and their families. Understanding the tension between women&#39;s power and their oppression, between their strength and their vulnerability, offers a new lens for understanding the relationship between the state and society in the twentieth century.\n\nThe last three years of the British Mandate for Palestine, 1945–48, were peak years in the Jewish national struggle for the establishment of a Jewish state and the formation of a progressive society peopled by new Hebrew men and women. This article discusses the historical phenomenon of Zionist women in Palestine who were sent to Europe on special missions to rescue Holocaust survivors and bring them to Palestine. Their stories shed light on the emergence of a new feminine identity and serve as a platform for exploring nationalism and gender in general, with an emphasis on the evolving identity of women during a period of national struggle. The case histories presented in this study show how women of the time found personal fulfillment through nationalistic missions that helped to redefine the role of the Jewish woman. They became models for a new Jewish woman who deviated from the traditional model of the woman as homemaker and mother. Participation in these missions was significan..."
