        "text": "However much Chaudhuri’s writings may sprawl, Islam presents itself as a useful barium meal to reveal the internal contours and nodulations of one South Asian intellectual’s constitution. The ambivalence inherent in Chaudhuri’s response to the Qutb Minar – the paradox the Moghuls present to him as extraordinary builders and destroyers of monuments, as erectors and deleters of cultures – should not lead us to the simplistic half-truth that, beneath the secular, Westernized exoskeleton of Chaudhuri’s dispassionate admiration for Moghul art, an unconscious, Hindu identity nurtured a not-quite-articulated resentment. The situation is much more complicated than that.\n\nChaudhuri’s work deals with a wide variety of Muslim subjects: not merely the obvious topics of Hindu–Muslim conflict or Pakistan, but also poets such as Saadi and Kazi Nazrul, historians like Ibn Khaldun, and thinkers such as Nizam ul Mulk and Syed Ahmed Khan; in the memoirs, we learn about his Muslim neighbours, rich and poor, the processions at Id, his father’s reaction to the latest news concerning the Turkish independence struggle or his discovery of the history of Islamic architecture in the libraries of Delhi. At work behind the enunciation of these topics is no simple Hindu-secular dichotomy but rather a variety of different personas, an array of alternating voices, sometimes jarring, sometimes in harmony, all struggling for the primacy of expression."
