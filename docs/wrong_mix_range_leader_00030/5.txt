Mrs. Golda Meir, Israel’s Foreign Minister, has scheduled a number of visits to Far Eastern countries, including Japan and Burma, early in 1962, the Foreign Ministry announced today. A number of other countries are expected to be included in the tour.

Mrs. Meir will leave shortly after Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion’s visit to Burma in December. She is expected to return to the United States to lead the Israel delegation in the debate on the Arab refugee problem and then will go to Tanganyika for that country’s independence day celebration December 9. She will return to Israel before leaving for the Far East.
