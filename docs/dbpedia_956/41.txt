Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) was an Italian artist famous for his etchings of Rome and his series of highly detailed and imaginative prints known as "Carceri d'Invenzione" (Imaginary Prisons). Born near Venice, Piranesi moved to Rome, where he studied architecture and stage design, and began his career as an etcher and engraver.

Piranesi's works are characterized by their intricate detail, dramatic perspective, and often fantastical elements. His "Imaginary Prisons" series is particularly renowned for its depiction of vast, labyrinthine interiors filled with grand arches, staircases, and machinery, evoking a sense of both wonder and foreboding.
