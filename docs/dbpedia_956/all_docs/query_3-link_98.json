The building is now used as the Supreme Court of Italy. Piranesi was a highly influential figure in the field of topographical illustration. He worked in Rome between 1740 and 1755 making intricately detailed architectural studies that reflect his superb knowledge of perspective.\n\nPurchased 1939 (No.39.18)"
