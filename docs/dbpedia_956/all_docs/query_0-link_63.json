        "text": "On show works of the great eighteenth century Venetian artist Giambattista Piranesi as presentation of many of his arts: architect, antiquarian, archaeologist, engraver, designer and taste creator.\n\nAlong with the 250 original prints there are reproductions of many of the objects projected and never created by G. Piranesi such as a vase, a candelabrum, a teapot, a chair, two tripods, an altar and a marvellous chimney.\n\nThere will also be the 3d simulation of “Carceri d’Invenzione”, a model made by De Lucchi of the Basilica di Santa Maria del Priorato in Rome (the only construction Piranesi created in his life) and 3D views of Rome by Gabriele Basilico, that are the photographer’s tribute to the great master.\n\nConceived by Michele De Lucchi and organised by the Giorgio Cini Foundation and Factum Arte, Adam Lowe’s Madrid studio, with the support of Accenture as technological partner, the exhibition “The Arts of Giambattista Piranesi. Architect, etcher,antiquarian, vedutista, designer” is an all-round exploration of the protean activities of Giambattista Piranesi (Venice 1720 - Rome 1778), one of the most fascinating, complex and multifaceted artists in 18th-century Europe.\n\nThirty years after the two exhibitions held by the Institute of Art History to mark the bicentennial of the artist’s death, the Giorgio Cini Foundation has organised another striking show to celebrate his inventiveness and imagination.\n\nIn addition to around 300 prints selected from the complete works held in the Cini Foundation graphic collections, the exhibition also features a series of ad hoc creations embodying Piranesi’s language, style and natural flair for “crossing over” – in some cases in an almost frenzied way – ancient and modern formal repertories in ingenious combinations.\n\nVisitors will be able to enter Piranesi’s “dark mind” after Marguerite Yourcenar’s description and explore his feverish imagination, at times verging on paranoia,by going into a tower with a 3D projection of the Carceri d’Invenzione (“Imaginary Prisons”): mental and visionary architecture stripped of any possible real building capacity, somewhere between Baroque stage designs and fanciful caprices.\n\nOn show there will also be “re-workings” constructed ad hoc and exclusively for the exhibition by Adam Lowe and Factum Arte.\n\nThey will enable visitors to comprehend the artist’s original ideas and decorative language close up in three-dimensional renderings made of rare materials of some of Piranesi’s inventions in the series.\n\nThe Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi was a man of exceptional skill whose vision contributed greatly to our understanding of Classical art and architecture. Initially Piranesi trained as an architect but went on to become an inspirational print-maker, publisher, archaeologist, antiquarian, dealer and, most importantly for the theme of this exhibition, a designer. His eclectic taste has had widespread and profound influence in particular on the Neoclassical styles that emerged in England and France in the 18th century.\n\nThe Art of Giambattista Piranesi is being built around Fondazione Giorgio Cini's remarkable collection of the artist's prints. It presents Piranesi's Prisons within a virtual reality installation, the Caffè degli Inglesi as a full-scale evocation, as well as a touch-screen browser to interact with Piranesi's sketchbooks. However, central to this exhibition will be objects made by from Piranesi's designs using the most advanced digital technologies and output methods (3D printing).\n\nFor this really special exhibition the Foundation decides to organise free visits of the exhibition for special categories,as professors, tourist guides, students of Arts. The explanation of the course will be done by the Istitute of Art History of the Foundation Giorgio Cini.\n\nInformation:\n\nHow to Arrive:\n\nThe Giorgio Cini Foundation is located on the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, across the Canal from St. Mark’s square and Palazzo Ducale.\n\nTo reach the Giorgio Cini Foundation, you can take vaporetto line n°2 and get off at “San Giorgio” stop.\n\nn°2 vaporetto leaves from the main points in Venice:\n\nSan Zaccaria (trip lasting about 3 minutes)\n\nFerrovia (trip lasting about 45 minutes)\n\nPiazzale Roma (trip lasting about 40 minutes)\n\nTronchetto (trip lasting about 35 minutes)\n\nGuided visits Reservations:\n\nDates: August 26th and 27th 2010 at 04:00 pm, please call this number +39 0412201215\n\nemail: segreteria@civitatrevenezie.it"
