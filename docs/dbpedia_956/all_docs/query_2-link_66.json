        "text": "I almost didn’t write this episode. The American Revolution in Philadelphia? Did I really have anything to add?\n\nIn the end, I realized that the Revolution was essential to understanding Philadelphia. It was truly a crucible moment. The British colonial city went through hell and emerged as the national capital of the newly federated United States of America in 1790.\n\nBut when you look at the Revolutionary period as it was seen from the streets, you begin to see what a messy time it was. This era is so often treated as a straightforward heroic tale. The underdog patriots beat the global imperial power of Great Britain against all odds. We still love to dissect the different arguments of the founding fathers as they hammered out the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\nBut how was the Revolution impacting people on the street? There were a lot of people who did not have a seat at the table, working out the laws of the new nation. What did they have to say for themselves? That’s what this episode really is about.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about some of the stories you heard on the podcast, I have a few recommendations:\n\nQuakers as Traitors\n\nRichard Godbeer’s World of Trouble: A Philadelphia Quaker Family’s Journey through the American Revolution (2019) reveals the trials of the Drinker family during the American Revolution. They were conscientious objectors and merchants, caught in between the British and American Patriots. The Patriots feared that the Friends commitment to peace was just a cover for loyalist sympathies. The head of the family was imprisoned and sent away to Virginia, even as Philadelphians could hear cannons as the British approached the city. He left his wife and children alone to face the advancing British army. They were forced to provide quarters for British officers throughout the war without a male protector in the home.\n\nHaitian Revolution in Philly\n\nGary Nash details the fascinating connections between Philadelphia and Haiti in “Reverberations of Haiti in the American North: Black Saint Dominguans in Philadelphia.” (You can find his article in Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, vol. 65, 1998, pp. 44–73, http://www.jstor.org/stable/27774161). Part of the growing Black population in Philadelphia in the 1790s was caused by white landowners in Haiti fleeing the Revolution, and finding refuge in Philly. This article brings to life many of the stories of enslaved Black Haitians who were brought to Philadelphia. Many of them were “freed” by Pennsylvania’s emancipation law, but unwittingly entered indentured servant contracts with their former enslavers, essentially ending their mobility.\n\nHucksters’ Rights are Women’s Rights\n\nCandice Harrison helps us understand women hucksters in her article “‘Free Trade and Hucksters’ Rights!’ Envisioning Economic Democracy in the Early Republic.” (You can read it at The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 137, no. 2, 2013, pp. 147–77, https://doi.org/10.5215/pennmaghistbio.137.2.0147). This is a remarkable story built around a petition, which is preserved at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. It’s so hard to find histories of women who lived and worked in the streets. Hucksters were a marginalized group of Black and white women (and some men, too) who had to work on the streets in order to make ends meet. While it’s amazing to have this document, it is clear that the women hucksters were capable of claiming their own rights, even when they were denied. These women refused to stop their work in the streets despite increasing pressure from the City.\n\nGallery\n\nSources\n\nAllinson, Edward P. and Boies Penrose.
