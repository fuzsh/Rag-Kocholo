        "text": "The exact origins of fireworks remain unknown. They probably originated in Asia sometime around the ninth century and are most often attributed to China, although pyrotechnics were known to have been used in ancient India as well. At some point in the Middle Ages the technology found its way to Europe, but sources vary on when they arrived and who brought them. The Italians were the first to manufacture fireworks in Europe, and they were well established features of religious festivals and public entertainment by the fourteenth century. So-called fire masters were tasked with creating ever more complex displays, and pyrotechnic schools were established throughout Europe during the Renaissance. Written descriptions of fireworks displays at festivals and events are found in sources dating into the sixteenth century. But it was in the seventeenth century that artists began attempting to capture these ephemeral events visually. This coincides with both the rise of the fete book and of etching and engraving as the primary media for fine book illustration.\n\nA fete book, or festival book, is a volume devoted to recording the apparatus, participants, and events planned around things such as religious festivals, state visits, aristocratic marriages, military victories, coronations, and royal birthdays. These publications are meant to celebrate and promote the power of those taking part in or sponsoring the event in question. They are usually illustrated with etchings and engravings, which offered seventeenth-century artists more flexibility than the woodcut for rendering these fantastic spectacles.\n\nThis exhibition presents technical manuals and festival books drawn from the Special Collections of the National Gallery of Art Library, which describe and depict an array of techniques and strategies. Representing many different times and places, they show how the technology and artistry of fireworks displays and the methods for recording them evolved in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, as rulers projected their power and prestige through pyrotechnic delights.\n\nSpecial note: This exhibition is open from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. It is not open on weekends.\n\nThe Wichita Art Museum proudly announces the establishment of the C. A. Seward Print Study Center, a museum focus on cultivating the premier collection of Prairie Print Makers and offering exhibition and education programs on this Wichita artist collective.\n\nThe Prairie Print Makers group was formed on December 28, 1930, when 11 of the best artists in Kansas gathered in the Lindsborg studio of artist Birger Sandzen. These Prairie Print Makers planned to offer affordable artwork that would appeal to collectors. The Print Makers created etchings, silkscreens, linoleum cuts, block prints, and lithographs. Within four years of its founding, the group boasted 47 active members and over 100 associate members. The collective continued until 1965--creating 34 gift prints between 1931 and that year.\n\nLeading the formation of the group was artist C. A. Seward (pictured at left). Seward settled in Wichita in 1907 and soon after established one of the few fine printing services outside of New York City, wrote a foundational text on lithography, organized low-cost traveling exhibitions, and helped to establish the Prairie Print Makers. His efforts fostered a vital arts community in Wichita with a singular goal--to bring art into everyone's life.\n\nPRINT FORUM ON AQUATINTS\n\nThis Forum is held in conjunction with WAM’s fall exhibition \"Charles Capps: Prairie Print Maker\" honoring one of the 10 founders of the Prairie Print Makers. Capps was born on September 14, and the C. A. Seward Dinner immediately following the Forum will include a toast on what would have been the artist’s 121st birthday.\n\nThe afternoon Print Forum is free and open to the public. Reservations are required for the C.A. Seward Dinner.\n\nPlease visit the 'External Link' below for more information.\n\nThe Frick Collection is pleased to announce a promised gift of forty-two works on paper by James McNeill Whistler (1834–1903), from the collection of Gertrude Kosovsky. An exhibition highlighting fifteen prints and one pastel from the gift is now on view in the Cabinet Gallery. The collection was formed over five decades by Mrs. Kosovsky, with the support of her husband, Dr. Harry Kosovsky, and includes twenty-seven etchings, fourteen lithographs, and one pastel, which range from Whistler’s early etchings dating from the late 1850s to lithographs of the late 1890s. Most are impressions made during his lifetime, a number of them from his major published sets, while others were produced for periodicals, thus encompassing different aspects of the American expatriate’s prolific activity as a printmaker. Works printed posthumously are also included.\n\nThe Kosovsky promised gift comes a little over a century after Henry Clay Frick gave Whistler pride of place in his collection, having purchased more works (including paintings, etchings, and pastels) by the artist than by any other. Since Mr. Frick’s death in 1919, only one work by Whistler has been added to the collection, a lithograph after his portrait of Robert, the Count of Montesquiou. The gift significantly expands the institution’s Whistler holdings. In particular, it nearly triples the Frick’s works on paper by the artist — almost all from his Venice period — and places them in the context of his career as a whole, allowing many more aspects of the master’s virtuoso printmaking to be appreciated.\n\nEneida Sanches, Indigo Arts Alliance Artist-in-Residence, began her studies in arts at the Art School of Bahia at the age of six. She studied architecture from 1980 to 1990 and simultaneously along with the course of Fine Arts at the Fine Arts of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.\n\nShe has research on African and Afro-Brazilian aesthetics since 1990 and studies calcography (prints from etching) at the Museum of Modern Art workshops in Bahia from 1995 to 2000. She exhibits from 1992 to 2000 in Museums and Galleries in Brazil and the United States with tools of liturgical use of the Yoruba candomblé showing works related to the theme of the Transe and expands the language of the prints into objects and installations.\n\nIn 2007, she was awarded the XXIV Salon of the Bahia Museum of Modern Art MAM-Ba and took part in the Frie Academie, Den Haag, The Netherlands.\n\nAs of 2011, she brings together printing and video-installation through the series Transe – Displacement of Dimensions in a collaborative work with photographer and video maker Tracy Collins (NY).\n\nIn 2013 she has his work published in the Magazine of Contemporary Art N / Paradoxa (Bisi Silva) and exhibits installation Transe (video installation) at the Festival Video Brasil 2013 – SP. In 2014 she was selected for a 3-month art residency at NAFASI Artspace in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. She was also nominated to the most important prize in the country, PIPA Prize. In 2016 she presents his work at Itau Cultural SP in the collective Diálogos Ausentes curated by Rosana Paulino and Diane Lima.\n\nIn 2017 she moved his studio to Sao Paulo where she works and lives. She participates in the Gaia Biennial in Portugal. In 2018, she is part of the PretAtitudes collective exhibition at SESC Ribeirao Preto, curated by Claudinei Silva. She presents her first solo show at Galeria Andrea Rehder, Sao Paulo and has her artwork published in the Contemporary And (C&) Berlin-based magazine.\n\nThis lecture is organized by Maine College of Art's Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art program, which brings together a national and international roster of visiting artists, curators, and scholars to participate in the MFA Summer Intensive in Portland, Maine. In addition to critiques and studio visits with graduate candidates, visiting artists deliver a talk that is free and open to the public.\n\nVisiting Artist lectures are held in Osher Hall and begin at 5:30pm\n\nJust as modern streaming services give us unprecedented freedom to watch television series in our own order, time, and place, print series allowed viewers in the Renaissance Netherlands to enjoy the same sets of images as their peers in more personalized and accessible ways. The Print Series in Bruegel’s Netherlands: Dutch and Flemish Works from the Permanent Collection places sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Netherlandish prints in their original context of series to explore the practices of looking at a succession of images. Many of these series illustrate cosmological, religious, and social ideas, challenging Pieter Bruegel the Elder and other print designers to represent these themes in a manner that appealed to both personalized and general tastes. This exhibition also allows the visitor to consider the ways in which abstract ideas were illustrated in more recognizable contexts.\n\nFrom 1500-1700, printmakers in the Low Countries were, as a group, the most skilled and prolific in all of Europe, and prints, often combined with text, played an important role in Netherlandish religious culture during this period. Printmakers utilized allegory in their work to address the most fundamental issues binding the human and the divine: love, virtue, vice, sin, death, and salvation.\n\n\"Through a Glass, Darkly”: Allegory and Faith in Netherlandish Prints from Lucas van Leyden to Rembrandt will be the first major exhibition to systematically consider the form, function, and meaning of allegorical prints produced in the Low Countries between the 16th and 18th centuries, and will serve as the basis for an illustrated catalogue produced by curators Walter S. Melion, Asa Candler Griggs Professor of Art History and director of the Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry at Emory University, and James Clifton, director of the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation and curator of Renaissance and Baroque painting at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston."
