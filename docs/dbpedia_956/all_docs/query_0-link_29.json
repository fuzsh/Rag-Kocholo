        "text": "A Visual History of Architecture One of the major developments in recent Piranesi studies is to consider his work as an integral part of the aesthetic and historical debates sparked off after the 1750 rediscovery of Pompei, Herculaneum and Paestum, and the resulting publications by Winckelmann and Julien-David Le Roy. Rudolf Wittkower was one of the first to break both with the tradition that considered Piranesi mainly as a vedutisto, a brilliant and highly original producer of evocative views of Rome, and with the Romantic tradition that saw him as the inventor of irrational space and of prophetic visions of the modern predicament. Instead, in one of the first articles he wrote after his arrival at the Warburg Institute in London, he drew attention to Piranesi's importance as an architectural theorist and historian. In his wake John Wilton-Ely and Manfredo Tafuri have developed a reading of his work as a precursor of modernism, favoring, like his fellow Venetian Lodoli, the simple expression of a building's function, and rejecting the traditional Vitruvian view of Greece as the cradle of classical architecture. In the past decade Lola Kantor, Fabio Barry, Mario Bevilacqua and Francesco Nevola have situated his writings in the context of Venetian debate on the relationship between architectural forms and function, exchanges between representatives of the new disciplines of art history and archaeology and the humanist antiquarian study of Roman ruins. The Graeco-Roman debate on the origins of classical architecture between, on one hand, Julien-David Le Roy and, on the other, Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Piranesi, has thus become the point of departure for recent studies of Piranesi's activities as an architectural historian. Yet common to all these new approaches, however valuable and innovative, is that they favor the content, the arguments, of Piranesi to the neglect of the actual visual form of his historical work. They concentrate on his position in the Graeco-Roman debate and in the controversies of the 1750s and 1760s between archaeologists, art historians and antiquarians on the origins of architecture, the nature and the legitimization of ornament. They barely address the actual form of his publications on ancient Rome, in that his representations of Rome's past are not in the form of a continous narrative discourse, chronologically ordered, or even of a chronicle of facts, dates and material remains (of which Le Roy's chronological diagram of church ground plans is a rudimentary example), but a visual history. In this essay I want to consider more closely the nature of this visual history and its implications. If one leaves aside Piranesi's writings, often polemical, on the correct use of ornament or the origins of classical architecture, which form a minor part of his oeuvre, and whose authorship is still sometimes contested, the large majority of his output consists of a series of etchings showing the ruins of Rome and its environs, with some reconstructions, as, for instance, that of the Campus Martius. In his early works, the Prima Parte di Architettura e Prospettive (1743), or the Antichità Romane de'tempi della Repubblica e de'primi Imperatori (1748), he presents a combination of etchings showing the ruins at the moment he saw them, subject to the ravages of time, together with hybrid images that assemble an abrupt montage of their present state with elements that had disappeared by the eighteenth century, and additions imagined by the artist, as in the scenes from the Via Appia. The Magnificenze (1762) and Le Antichità Romane (1762) offer the most complete vision of the Roman and Etruscan origins of classical architecture. In such later monographic publications as the Rovine del Castello dell'Acqua Giulia (1761) and the Campo Marzio dell'antica Roma (1762), culminating in the studies of the Villa Hadriana and Paestum, unfinished at the time of his death and published by his son Francesco, the form and content is always visual. A simple comparison between the way in which, for instance, Piranesi visually stages the Pantheon and the manner preserved by more traditional vedutisti or architectural historians shows how much the importance of suggesting that the building is actually present for the beholder, with the spectator actually inside it, replaced the documentary tradition that started with the Speculum Magnificentiae Romae at the end of the sixteenth century. Whereas there, or in the collections of Roman antiquities by Palladio and Serlio, the Pantheon is shown frontally, in orthogonal projection, and with an absolute adherence to its exact state at the time, Piranesi's version as presented in the Magnificenze uses a complex perspectival system with two vanishing points located so as not to imply a conventional or self-evident view, and removes several columns from the\n\nDuring the Enlightenment Century, the venetian architect, archaeologist and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) published in Rome the essay Parere su l`architettura (1765) which was elaborated in a context of debates between the defenders of the Greek’s arts and the defenders of the Romans` arts. However, the themes addressed in the Parere transcend this dispute. It was written in a form of dialogue between two fictional characters that represent opposite tendencies: Protopiro - a “rigorist” - and Didascalo - “a friend of Piranesi” who argues for the inventive freedom of the artist. With this dialectical confrontation, Piranesi explains his views about the architectural discipline pairing these issues: 1. the ornament and its relationship with architecture; 2. the pertinence (or not) in establishing norms for architecture - according to the “rigorists”- opposing the freedom in variation - which Piranesi was adept. Dialectically handle with these themes, Piranesi addressed some contemporary scholars whose theories sought to establish a new aesthetic key for architecture. This article aims to analyse some of the interlocutions that can be understood from the dialectic established in the Parere su l`architettura with the ideas of: Carlo Lodoli (1690-1771) with whom Piranesi had contact in his formative years in Venice; Marc-Antoine Laugier (1713-1769) through Essai sur l`architecture (1753), a publication that circulated in the middle of the French Academy in Rome, with which Piranesi maintained investigative ties; and with Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768) who had settled in Rome in 1756 and started to seek the ideal beauty paradigm from Ancient Greece. By this way, we conclude about the relevance of this essay to the critical history of architecture in a context that the late Baroque was contested and the Neoclassicism would be established. And we can contribute to the international celebrations on the three hundred years of Piranesi´s birth.\n\nDuring the seventeenth century the fascination of ruins had an irresistible impact throughout Europe thanks to the Grand Tour, the new archaeological discoveries and the tireless work of painters and engravers who, with their art, reproduced the beauty of the ancient world. This enormous appreciation had its epicentre in Rome where the local art marked, influenced by the collecting interests associated with the Grand Tour, polarized its activity on the rediscovery of the Eternal City’s old ruins which were not seen any more as ordinary/quaint elements of the landscape but instead as specific and autonomous entities characterized by a powerful, evocative potential. Among the numerous artists working in Rome, Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) fostered an innovative and lasting perception of antiquity, combining remarkable flights of imagination with a scientific and practical understanding of ancient Roman technology. Piranesi not only recreated with his art the ancestral splendor of the old Roman ruins, but was also concerned with their conservation and restoration. In the introduction to his famous Delle antichità romane de’ tempo della prima Repubblica e dei primi imperatori romani, the Venetian artist focused his attention on the disrepair and the alterations of the Roman archaeological ruins, highlighting the importance of protecting the old monuments and reproducing them with prints and engravings. This invite to conservation came in conjunctions with the outstanding archaeological discoveries in Herculaneum (commencing in 1735) and Pompei (commencing in 1748). Such discoveries, and Piranesi’s oeuvre, reinforced a long-existing awareness of Roman ruins as a window on the past glory of European history, and a metaphor for the transience of human achievement. In view of these elements, Piranesi’s theories about conservation represent a turning point in the late Baroque re-evaluation and re-interpretation of the antiquity. By casting a new light on the past, he joined Laugier and Winckelmann’s discussion about classic architecture, producing a decisive contribution in the diffusion and appreciation of Roman ancestral beauties throughout Italy and Europe."
