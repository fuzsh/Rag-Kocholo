        "text": "John Cobb (born c. 1710—died 1778) was an English cabinetmaker whose work was once overshadowed by that of Thomas Chippendale but who is now regarded as being among England’s greatest furniture makers.\n\nHe was in partnership (c. 1750–65) with William Vile, their firm becoming one of the most important among London’s cabinetmakers. While Vile created works in an Anglicized Rococo style, Cobb’s furniture of the 1770s was executed in an elegant Neoclassical style. Vile retired in 1765, and Cobb continued alone until his death. Up to 1765 the firm supplied furniture to King George III of England, but after Vile’s retirement Cobb apparently ceased work for royalty. The firm’s records are rare, but a ledger from Edgcote House, Northamptonshire, notes payment to them of more than £1,000 in 1758, and Cobb supplied, in 1770, furniture to the English connoisseur and man of letters Horace Walpole."
