        "text": "Early life and travels\n\nLinnaeus was the son of a curate and grew up in Småland, a poor region in southern Sweden. His early interest in botany was channeled by a teacher at Växjö gymnasium, who acquainted him with the plant system of French botanist and physician Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, an essay on plant sexuality by French botanist Sébastian Vaillant, and the physiological writings of Dutch physician and professor of medicine Herman Boerhaave. In 1727 Linnaeus began his studies in medicine at Lund University, but he transferred to Uppsala University in 1728. Because of his financial situation, he could only visit a few lectures; however, the university professor Olof Celsius provided Linnaeus access to his library. From 1730 to 1732 he was able to subsidize himself by teaching botany in the university garden of Uppsala.\n\nAt this early stage, Linnaeus laid the groundwork for much of his later work in a series of manuscripts. Their publication, however, had to await more-fortuitous circumstances. In 1732 the Uppsala Academy of Sciences sent Linnaeus on a research expedition to Lapland. After his return in the autumn of that year, he gave private lectures in botany and mineral assaying. That Christmas he used some of his earnings to pay a visit to Claes Sohlberg, his friend and fellow student, in Falun, the capital of the copper-mining region of Dalarna, in central Sweden. There he became acquainted with the governor, who financed a second trip to the region in the summer of 1734. At the time, it was necessary for Swedish medical students to complete their doctoral degrees abroad in order to open a successful medical practice in their homeland. In an agreement with Sohlberg’s father, who was the royal inspector of the Falun copper mine and impressed with Linnaeus’s botanical and mineralogical abilities, Linnaeus received an annual stipend to offset medical school expenses in the Netherlands. In return, Linnaeus promised to take young Sohlberg with him on the trip and serve as his academic mentor. Before they embarked on their journey in the spring of 1735, Linnaeus became engaged to Sara Elisabeth—the daughter of Johan Moraeus, a well-to-do physician in Falun. It was agreed that their marriage should take place after Linnaeus returned from the Netherlands in three years’ time.\n\nThe “ sexual system” of classification\n\nA few days after arriving in the Dutch town of Harderwijk in May 1735, Linnaeus completed his examinations and received his medical degree following the submission of a thesis he had prepared in advance on the topic of intermittent fevers. Linnaeus and Sohlberg then journeyed to Leiden, where Linnaeus sought patronage for the publication of his numerous manuscripts. He was immediately successful, and his Systema Naturae (“The System of Nature”) was published only a few months later with financial support from Jan Frederik Gronovius, senator of Leiden, and Isaac Lawson, a Scottish physician. This folio volume of only 11 pages presented a hierarchical classification, or taxonomy, of the three kingdoms of nature: stones, plants, and animals. Each kingdom was subdivided into classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties. This hierarchy of taxonomic ranks replaced traditional systems of biological classification that were based on mutually exclusive divisions, or dichotomies. Linnaeus’s classification system has survived in biology, though additional ranks, such as families, have been added to accommodate growing numbers of species.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nScience Quiz\n\nIn particular, it was the botanical section of Systema Naturae that built Linnaeus’s scientific reputation. After reading essays on sexual reproduction in plants by Vaillant and by German botanist Rudolph Jacob Camerarius, Linnaeus had become convinced of the idea that all organisms reproduce sexually. As a result, he expected each plant to possess male and female sexual organs (stamens and pistils), or “husbands and wives,” as he also put it. On this basis, he designed a simple system of distinctive characteristics to classify each plant. The number and position of the stamens, or husbands, determined the class to which it belonged, whereas the number and position of pistils, or wives, determined the order. This “sexual system,” as Linnaeus called it, became extremely popular, though certainly not only because of its practicality but also because of its erotic connotations and its allusions to contemporary gender relations. French political theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the system for his “Huit lettres élémentaires sur la botanique à Madame Delessert” (1772; “Eight Letters on the Elements of Botany Addressed to Madame Delessert”). English physician Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin, used Linnaeus’s sexual system for his poem “The Botanic Garden” (1789), which caused an uproar among contemporaries for its explicit passages."
