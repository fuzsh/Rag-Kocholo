        "text": "Giovanni Piranesi was an Italian Painter born on 4 October 1720 in Venice, Italy. Piranesi received his first art education as an apprentice under his uncle, Matteo Lucchesi, who was an architect. Afterward, Giovanni traveled to Rome and worked as Marco Foscarini’s draftsman. During this period, he studied under Giuseppe Vasi, who taught him the rudiments of etching and engraving.\n\nPiranesi settled permanently in Rome in the mid-1740s, opening a workshop and then a printing house.
