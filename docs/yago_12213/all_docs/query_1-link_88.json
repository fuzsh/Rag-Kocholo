        "text": "EuropaCorp is a French motion picture company headquartered in Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris, and one of a few full service independent studios that both produces and distributes feature films, as well as the one of the major companies in Europe. It specializes in production, distribution, home entertainment, VOD, sales, partnerships and licenses, recording, publishing and exhibition. EuropaCorp's integrated financial model generates revenues from a wide range of sources, with films from many genres and a strong presence in the international markets.\n\nOver 14 years, EuropaCorp has produced and co-produced over 80 films and is now distributing over 500 titles after the integration of the RoissyFilms Catalogue. The studio is mainly known for its expertise in the production of English-language films with strong earning potential in the international marketplace.[3] The company is renowned for developing and producing two blockbuster franchises, the Taken trilogy and the Transporter series.[4]\n\nThe company began producing TV series in 2010 through EuropaCorp Television which has already adapted one of EuropaCorp's most famous and popular film franchises: Taxi.\n\nHistory[]\n\nLuc Besson began directing features with his film, Le Dernier Combat (1983). In 1985 he worked with Pierre-Ange Le Pogam for the first time on the movie Subway. Le Pogam was then Distribution Director at Gaumont. Subsequently, virtually all the films that Besson made with Gaumont between 1985 and 1999 topped the three-million ticket mark at the box office (e.g. The Big Blue (1988), Nikita (1990), Léon, The Fifth Element (1997) and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999)) Meanwhile, Le Pogam developed innovative promotional techniques at Gaumont, which he applied for the first time for Besson’s The Fifth Element (1997). This film was France’s biggest export success of all time until Taken 2 was released in 2012, which established a new record.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1997 Pierre-Ange Le Pogam became Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Gaumont. In September 2000 Besson and Le Pogam founded Europacorp.[3] This superseded Besson's earlier production company known as Films du Dauphin.\n\nIn July 2007 EuropaCorp successfully managed its IPO on Euronext Paris.[5]\n\nIn May 2008, the CSA, French authority for media regulation, selected the EuropaCorp TV project in its invitation to apply for a mobile TV channel in France.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2013 Lisa Ellzey, hitherto producer for Lionsgate and 20th Century Fox, was appointed as executive vice president of U.S. Motion Picture Production of EuropaCorp.[6]\n\nIn 2018, Besson was accused of rape by an actress who wishes to remain anonymous.[7] EuropaCorp stocks dropped 17% to just €2.31 ($2.70) after the rape allegation.[8]\n\nStructure[]\n\nToday EuropaCorp is owned at 62% by Luc Besson through his company Frontline and at 8.06% by Pierre-Ange Le Pogam; 23% is public.[5][9]\n\nBesson is the Chairman of EuropaCorp's Board of Directors.\n\nJean-Julien Baronnet was the Chief Executive Officer of EuropaCorp until November 2008. Christophe Lambert was CEO from 2010 to 2016.[10] Marc Shmuger was appointed as CEO in 2016.[11]\n\nDigital Factory[12] is related to EuropaCorp via Luc Besson. EuropaCorp films, post-production of sound for EuropaCorp films is performed chiefly at its Normandy site, while the image editing is done in Paris.\n\nIn September 2016 it was announced that Chinese film company Fundamental Films had acquired a stake of 27.9% in EuropaCorp, becoming the second-largest shareholder in the company.[13]\n\nIn June 2017, EuropaCorp signed a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing.[14] And later that month, the studio posted a loss of 120 million euros (US$135 million).[15]\n\nInternational dimension[]\n\nEuropaCorp has notably produced the world box-office hits Taken ($224 million at world box-office), Arthur and the Invisibles ($107 million), Transporter 3 ($106 million) and Hitman ($100 million). Two EuropaCorp productions have been topping the US box-office: Transporter 2 by summer 2005 and Taken at spring 2009.\n\nMany international film stars have appeared in EuropaCorp productions: Jim Carrey, Penélope Cruz, Robert De Niro, David Duchovny, Morgan Freeman, Salma Hayek, Tommy Lee Jones, Jet Li, John Malkovich, Jason Statham, Brittany Murphy, Liam Neeson, Madonna, Ewan McGregor, Lou Reed, and others. Consequently, the films are usually shot in English.[16]\n\nEuropaCorp Japan, a subsidiary of EuropaCorp based in Tokyo, has for core business the distribution of feature films in Japan. It is a joint-venture with three Japanese companies: Asmik Ace, Sumitomo Corporation and Kadokawa.\n\nIn 2012, EuropaCorp struck a three-year output deal with Chinese film distributor Fundamental Films for 15 feature films. Fundamental Films agreed to co-produce three of these films.[17][18]\n\nIn April 2013, the company announced its next film would be Lucy, directed by Luc Besson and starring American actress Scarlett Johansson.[19]\n\nIn May 2015, the company announced an output deal with Polish film distributor Kino Swiat.[20]\n\n\"Cité du Cinéma\", French movie studios[]\n\nEuropaCorp relocated to the Cité du Cinéma in 2012. This movie studio complex, located in Saint-Denis in the close outskirts of Paris, at build out will have a total of 9 film stages,[3] with another 12,000 square metres of space devoted to technical units and 2200 square metres for screening and reception rooms.[3][21]\n\nThe cinema school Louis-Lumière National Higher School is to be relocated to the complex.\n\nEuropaCorp signed a lease with the Nef Lumière, owner of the tertiary complex, for space for its permanent staff and the film crews, with extra space for potential new activities. This tertiary complex is financed by both the Caisse des Dépôt and Vinci.\n\nEuropaCorp is a minority shareholder in the company operating the studios, joining Euro Media Group, Quinta Communications and Frontline. The Euro Media Group, which owns several film studios throughout Europe, will provide management of daily operations of these studios of Paris.\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Film Director Language Reception Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic 1997 Nil by Mouth Gary Oldman English 65% 2000 Taxi 2 Gérard Krawczyk French The Dancer Fred Garson English Exit Olivier Megaton French Bang Rajan Tanit Jitnukul Thai 2001 Yamakasi\n\nAriel Zeitoun\n\nJulien Seri\n\nFrench 15 août Patrick Alessandrin French Kiss of the Dragon Chris Nahon English Wasabi Gérard Krawczyk French 43% 53 2002 Blanche Bernie Bonvoisin French Once Upon an Angel Vincent Perez French The Transporter Louis Leterrier English 53% Chaos and Desire Manon Briand French 2003 Laughter and Punishment Isabelle Doval French Taxi 3 Gérard Krawczyk French I, Cesar Richard Berry French Tristan Philippe Harel French Fanfan la Tulipe Gérard Krawczyk French Les Côtelettes Bertrand Blier French High Tension Alexandre Aja French 41% 42 Happiness Costs Nothing Mimmo Calopresti Italian Michel Vaillant Louis-Pascal Couvelaire French Together Chen Kaige Chinese\n\n(Mandarin) Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior Prachya Pinkaew Thai 86% 2004 Crimson Rivers 2 Olivier Dahan French The Story of My Life Laurent Tirard French My Spitting Image Aruna Villiers French Taxi Tim Story English 10% District 13 Pierre Morel French 80% 2005 Unleashed Louis Leterrier English 65% 58 Ze Film Guy Jacques French The Prompter Guillaume Pixie French Pale Eyes Jérome Bonnell French Imposture Patrick Bouchitey French Next!
