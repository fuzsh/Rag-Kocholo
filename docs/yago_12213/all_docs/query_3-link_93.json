        "text": "For 30 years, Scott LoBaido has been a voice; fighting with you and for you on so many issues: promoting and celebrating Old Glory, those who serve, and our great American way, using art, heart, and passion. Now it is time to tell his story, the good, the bad and the ugly that got him to where he is today. He is advocating as a giant voice for you, the American People, through the unusual suspect…Art. An inspiring American Story of art, patriotism, and activism, told with tons of stills and video footage from Scott’s extensive career, that will surely blow your mind. After 30 years, this story must be told…. NOW more than ever. This is a wild-ride film like no other and a call to action at a time like no other. This documentary will definitely fire up the patriotic passion in the American people and will give Scott the grand-scale stage to encourage all Americans to join him as he continues to be your voice, as big tech and the media at large fight to erase us every day. We plan to embark on a nationwide tour with our documentary, “The Relentless Patriot”, targeting conservative cities leading up to the film’s release on June 14, 2024, coinciding with Flag Day and President Donald Trump’s birthday. By strategically organizing screenings in these communities, we aim to create a grassroots movement, engaging with conservative and patriotic-minded individuals. These screenings will not only generate anticipation for the film but also foster a sense of community and shared values. We believe this approach will help build momentum, generating word-of-mouth support and creating a strong foundation for a successful box office presence among our target audience. With an endorsement from President Donald J. Trump, this film is sure to inspire those who believe in the American flag and everything that stands behind it. Global Ascension Studios is a leading film production company dedicated to creating compelling narratives that inspire, educate, and entertain audiences worldwide. With a focus on celebrating American values and patriotism, the studio’s diverse portfolio includes documentaries, feature films, and television series that resonate with audiences of all backgrounds. The film is directed by the talented and visionary Christopher Martini from Triple Martini Productions and produced by Frank Torchia from Torch Entertainment and Dan Caropreso with executive producers and studio on record, Global Ascension Studios executives, Joshua Macciello, Arthur Sarkissian, and Derek Chan."
