        "text": "Michael Fassbender is in talks to star in director George Clooney’s next series project, The Department. The show is an espionage thriller based on The Bureau, which is a French spy series created, directed and produced by Eric Rochant.\n\nThe original series centers on “Guillaume Debailly — alias Paul Lefebvre, alias Malotru — a member of a clandestine branch of the French Secret Services (DGSE) who returns to his home base after a six-year mission in Damascus. As he struggles to let go of his false identity and illicit affair with a Syrian woman, he finds himself playing a double game between the DGSE and the CIA.”\n\nThe show is said to be such a big hit due to its “look at the psychology of secret agents, inclusion of geopolitical issues that resonated with current events and international locations.”\n\nThis seems like a perfect project for Clooney and and Fassbender to team up on! It’s also been given a straight-to-series order by Showtime. The series is produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov’s Smokehouse Pictures, MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios."
