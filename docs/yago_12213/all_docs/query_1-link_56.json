        "text": "All five seasons of Eric Rochant’s award-winning spy thriller television series The Bureau are collected in this 15-disc set. The Bureau is a secretive department in charge of training elite undercover agents for the French secret service (known as the DGSE – Directorate-General for External Security). Dispatched to key locations all around the world and living under false identities for years, their mission is to identify potential sources. The series begins with the return to the DGSE headquarters of top spy Malotru (Matthieu Kassovitz, Amélie, La Haine), after a six-year mission in Syria. But his return to “normal” life is proving difficult, especially when he is informed that Nadia (Zineb Triki), a woman he was madly in love with in Damascus is actually in Paris. For love, he is willing to take risks…for him and the Bureau."
