        "text": "Martin's army however overcomes much adversity, and plays a large part in the Continental effort. They later join up with the main Continental Army, and along with the long awaited arrival of the French, force Cornwallis and the British to surrender at Yorktown. Benjamin also gets his revenge by killing Tavington in the battle. This spells victory for the Americans and personal victory for Benjamin Martin. After the white flag is raised Martin returns to his family to rebuild his house and his life.\n\nIII. As a result of the harsh treatment and strict regulations put on the colonists by the British such as the Boston Massacre, the Tea Act, Stamp Act, and other taxes, the colonists were ready for a change. They are tired of being controlled by a government on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, and are ready to start fighting for their freedom. The colonists form many rebellious groups such as the Sons of Liberty, to protest and rebel against the British involvement in their country. They hold meetings and help carry out acts against the British such as the Boston Tea Party. When the British don't change their ways it is time for war. The fighting starts at Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775 with the first shots being fired. People all over wanted to help in the war effort by joining the army and forming small militia groups to fight the British. Benjamin Martin's army was one of these groups. The British won many battles"
