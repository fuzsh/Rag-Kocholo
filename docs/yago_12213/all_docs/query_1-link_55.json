        "text": "Yvan Attal (French pronunciation: [ivɑ̃ atal]; Hebrew: איוואן אטל; born (1965-01-04)4 January 1965) is a French actor, scriptwriter and film director.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Tel Aviv, Israel, to Algerian-Jewish parents. He grew up in the outskirts of Paris. His acting debut was in Éric Rochant's Un monde sans pitié (1989), which earned him a César Award for Most Promising Actor. His first feature film as director was Ma femme est une actrice (2001), which co-starred Charlotte Gainsbourg, Attal's real-life partner.\n\nHe directed a segment in the film New York, I Love You, and appeared as an actor in another.\n\nHe acted in The Interpreter and Anthony Zimmer, and in Rush Hour 3 he played a French cab driver named George.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAttal's longtime partner is Anglo-French actress-singer Charlotte Gainsbourg whom he met on the set of the 1991 film Aux yeux du monde. Gainsbourg and Attal are not married, and Gainsbourg has attributed her reluctance to marry to the fact that her parents never married. Attal publicly proposed to Gainsbourg on 19 June 2013 during an awards ceremony when he received the French National Order of Merit. In April 2014, Attal confirmed that they were still unwed with no plans to marry.\n\nAttal has three children with Gainsbourg. In 2014, following the death of Gainsbourg's sister, photographer Kate Barry, Attal and his family relocated to New York City.\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Film Role Director Notes 1989 Un monde sans pitié Halpern Éric Rochant César Award for Most Promising Actor\n\nActeurs à l'Écran – Michel Simon's Award 1991 Cauchemar Blanc Mathieu Kassovitz Short film Mauvais fille Vincent Régis Franc Aux yeux du monde Bruno Fournier Éric Rochant 1992 Amoureuse Paul Jacques Doillon Love After Love Romain Diane Kurys 1994 The Patriots Ariel Brenner Éric Rochant 1996 Delphine 1, Yvan 0 a man Dominique Farrugia Portraits chinois Yves Martine Dugowson Love, etc. Benoît Marion Vernoux 1997 I Got a Woman (Short) Arnaud Yvan Attal Alpe d'Huez International Comedy Film Festival – Best Short Film Saraka bô Taïeb Denis Amar 1998 Alissa Luc Kaufmann Didier Goldschmidt Cantique de la racaille Gaston Vincent Ravalec 1999 Mes amis Eric Michel Hazanavicius With or Without You Benoit Michael Winterbottom The Criminal Mason Julian Simpson 2000 Le prof Hippolyte Alexandre Jardin 2001 My Wife Is an Actress Yvan Yvan Attal Cabourg Romantic Film Festival – Best Director\n\nNominated – César Award for Best Debut 2002 And Now...
