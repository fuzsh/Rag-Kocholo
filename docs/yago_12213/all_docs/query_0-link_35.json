        "text": "From a marketing perspective, a project or client that can be picked up with a pre-existing audience is the perfect opportunity for increased brand awareness, enhanced chance of success, and expansion of the business. Whilst fresh ideas are brilliant, being able to take something already in existence and reframe it, to use it to demonstrate a new angle or simply put its messaging back into the world is a concept that makes up the majority of content creation and is a skill unto itself. There are no new ideas, merely fresh perspectives! As a writer, this article presents the reality of this exciting new frontier - adaptation previously battled with a negative mindset towards the artform, often seen as cheating or a cop out from the writers. The reality is that, particularly in book-to-screen adaptation, the pre-existing fan base creates a new and differing pressure to create what is expected, to ensure that key aspects of the book are not lost in translation, even casting the right actors becomes more volatile. Adaptation is an artform in its own right, and it is wonderful to see it gaining traction in the media. #WriterInsights #Adaptation #BrandAwareness #BusinessExpansion #LBF24\n\nFrom Blooomberg: More to the point, it isnâ€™t Sundanceâ€™s fault that people are going to fewer movies in theaters. A growing share of the population would rather watch a movie at home, save for the occasional blockbuster. This trend started years ago and accelerated during the pandemic. They have more ways to entertain themselves than ever before â€” and more to watch at home. Major movie studios released fewer movies in theaters last year than they did five years ago, according to Luminate . Meanwhile, the number of movies released on streaming has nearly tripled over that span. (Letâ€™s not even talk about the boom in #TV shows.) Sundance does play a vital role in the business of independent #film, and its organizers know they must find a balance between art and commerce. Sundance has become a destination not just for aspiring filmmakers, but for financiers, advertisers, studio executives and #tech companies. Amazon, Adobe and TikTok are just a few of the companies hosting events this year. Financiers and producers bring dozens of movies to Park City every year hoping to secure distribution deals that cover their cost of production. In 2006, Fox Searchlight plopped down more than $10 million for Little Miss Sunshine, a delightful family comedy that grossed more than $100 million at the box office. That may have been the peak of the independent market, as almost every major studio had a specialty division back then, including Warner Bros. Entertainment, #Paramount and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Film financing contracted during the global recession and was then transformed by the force that has distorted everything in #Hollywood: streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Apple have spent more than $200 million buying movies at the festival in recent years, including both Academy Award winners and films youâ€™ve already forgotten about. Few of the traditional distributors could compete with those heavyweights, which inflated the expectations of most producers and sellers. But this boom was short-lived. The streaming services now want titles that appeal to as many people as possible, and that isnâ€™t @Sundanceâ€™s specialty. #Streaming services will buy a title or two â€” as Netflix did with Fair Play last year â€” but their presence on the festival circuit is diminished. The more optimistic among us will note that the market for independent film is cyclical; while box-office sales are below the pre-pandemic level, but they are increasing Apple and Amazon may not be the most active buyers at festivals, but they are releasing movies like Saltburn and Napoleon in theaters. New players, be it Roku Inc. or some rich dude from Texas, will always want to be in the film business.\n\nIn a recent discussion, Killer Films co-founder Christine Vachon highlighted a big difference between the U.S. and European film industries: \"Producers in the U.S. donâ€™t have the same system of subsidies that European filmmakers and producers have,\" she noted. This forces American producers to think more about their audiences, which, according to her, makes for stronger cinema. \"Iâ€™m always a little surprised at filmmakers who donâ€™t think that the audience matters. We are compelled to really interrogate who is going to see a film and who we are making it for, and that forces us into a discussion that I think ultimately disciplines the films in a good way.\" https://lnkd.in/dkq-H8di This got me thinking about a certain Northern European country, where government grants dominate the film industry. Producers here often operate with minimal financial risk because theyâ€™re cushioned by taxpayer-funded subsidies. While this system is meant to support cultural projects, it sometimes results in content that doesnâ€™t really appeal to a broad audience or meet high artistic standards. I believe the solution lies in being more selective with these funds. Art house #filmmakers, who genuinely contribute to the cultural landscape, should receive more robust support. Meanwhile, commercial projects should be encouragedâ€”or even requiredâ€”to compete in the open market. This would push them to improve in various areas: working attitudes, screenplay quality, visual style, and understanding of international storytelling tastes. Right now, thereâ€™s a complacent belief within the industry that their films and TV shows are top-notch and internationally respected. But letâ€™s be honest: major streamers and international discussions on European cinema rarely mention this country. Thereâ€™s a clear gap between self-image and external recognition. #Producers and filmmakers here need a reality check. They need to understand what international audiences are looking for, take off their national glasses, and be brutally honest with themselves. If they had to compete for funding and audience attention, the pressure would drive higher quality and innovation. This shift would not only elevate the industry to international standards but also give audiences better films and TV shows. Ultimately, breaking out of this subsidized bubble and embracing a market-driven approach could lead to a more vibrant and globally resonant film industry. #FilmIndustry #CulturalBubble #CinematicQuality #EuropeanCinema Deadline Hollywood\n\nThough relatively new on the Hollywood scene (its first original film was released in 2019), Appleâ€™s deep pockets have been enough to ensure that the Apple TV+ streaming serviceâ€™s slate of original films has included not just charming indies, but award-winning prestige pictures. CODA was Oscarâ€™s best picture just a couple of years ago (the first film from a streaming service to claim the honor), and the streamerâ€™s movies earned it 13 nominations this year, even if neither Killers of the Flower Moon nor Napoleon actually took anything home. Given the complexities of film financing today, you might be excused for believing that many of these movies were typical theatrical releases rather than Apple originalsâ€”but, strictly speaking, these are all Apple TV+ originals. Sometimes theyâ€™re only available through the app, but other times they have small (or significant) theatrical releases built in to their distribution model, if only to ensure theyâ€™re eligible for major awards like the Oscars. Here are 15 of the best films to watch on Apple TV+ right now. Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) Though it didnâ€™t take home Oscar gold (letâ€™s put Lily Gladstone in more movies, please), Martin Scorseseâ€™s latest has more than proven the octogenarian filmmaker hasnâ€™t lost a step. A story of creeping dread and existential terror in the American west, it chronicles the injustices that follow the discovery of oil on Osage tribal land in the 1920s. A good thing quickly goes bad when white political leaders plot a string of murders to keep the wealth from staying where it belongs. The film might have gone deeper in presenting the true story from its natural Indigenous perspective, but the finished product still represents an important and harrowing story well told. The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021) Joel Coenâ€™s sole (thus far) solo directing project represents a bold choice: a beautiful, strikingly minimalist adaptation of the Scottish playâ€”lean and mean in its production and its impact. Only a director of Coenâ€™s confidence would mount a production like this without feeling the need to reinvent the wheel, letting Shakespeare dialogue and the performances of Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand do the heavy lifting. During the 2021/22 awards season, it received far more nominations than wins, but still stands as one of the best cinematic takes on Macbeth since Kurosawaâ€™s Throne of Blood. Come from Away (2021) A full cinematic adaptation of this musical about the events that unfolded at a rural airport on 9/11 was in the works before the pandemic put a stop to them. Thus, a special stage production was mounted using members of the original cast, filmed before an audience of 9/11 survivors and frontline workers. While itâ€™s impossible to know what that other version might have been like, this one is probably better. The musical, which opened on Broadway in 2017, takes place in the Newfoundland town of Gander following the 2001\n\nIntroducing Chaos Casting, my new work baby. After 6 years on the casting team of studio productions, I started noticing a gap in the entertainment industry. Emerging filmmakers canâ€™t afford prestigious casting directors. And associate casting directors lack a link to filmmakers who arenâ€™t already partnered with established casting directors (who also tend to be... Well, our bosses). This disconnect exists a crucial point in both groupsâ€™ careers, when weâ€™ve paid our dues and are ready for more responsibility. We need each other, but we donâ€™t know each other, and weâ€™re too busy working in the industry to find collaborators at the same level who share our taste. Hollywood is often a 0 sum game. But Chaos Casting was inspired by the wild idea that the next generation of great directors, producers, writers, and casting directors can rise through uplifting each other. Without filmmakers breaking their tight indie budgets, or casting directors risking biting the (beautiful, love you boss queens!) hands that feed. A deeper pond to grow in without starving or being eaten. Thus, on a dark night of the soul, Chaos Casting was born. I took countless meetings with producers, directors, writers, agents, managers, executives, and casting associates, and distilled them into market research. Chaos Casting offers exceptional casting at a sliding scale for every tier of low budget, short, and student films. Those are on our website, along with an unprecedented â€˜get a quoteâ€™ tool, which instantly estimates cost and time for casting standard productions. Inventing that quote algorithm alone required me (with the help of mathmatician, coder, and entrepreneur friends) to grapple with advanced algebra and coding. Itâ€™s not perfect, but we took it from concept to execution of v.1 in about two weeks, so imagine the hustle and creativity I bring to my chosen field of casting. Iâ€™ve set out processes, options, and procedures as clearly as possible so clients can make educated choices and know what theyâ€™re paying for. All casting services can be customized with add ons. Weâ€™re pre-production ready for all scripted media, including commercials, new media, documentaries, and (please, God, let me cast a RPG) video games. I hope to eventually spread the good vibes by sharing opportunities with my casting peers ready and willing to forge their own creative partnerships with like-minded storytellers. Ordo ab chao. Order from chaos. Thatâ€™s what creation is, you know. Check us at at www.chaoscasting.com. Or email hello@chaoscasting.com for more info.\n\nThis is a film in search of a real story-line and editor. Rarely do I step in and tell more than billion members, to stay away from a movie but someone at Sony should have thrown another $20 million out the window to give this film a chance to turn into a franchise. The crazy part of film making some people will go see the film just to see how bad it is, thus leading to a bad film making money. But this film was taken off Moviegazoo Movie List and $160 million was returned to our members. I doubt Sony has the balls to invest in a real story: three women with Super Spider Powers. With the right raw storyline and a super crazy bad guy, it could make up for what Sony is going to lose on Madame Web! Note: This film was Bootlegged on 2/12/2024. It hit the internet 3 hours after its first Red Carpet Event. This film will lose between $200 million and $400 million based on the number of people that will see it for free! Some members are betting on which streaming service is going to gets it first! This is how bad the film is... ðŸ˜² #sonypictures #20thcenturystudios #relianceentertainment #universalpictures #warnerbros #columbiapictures #paramountpictures #Lionsgate #focusfeatures #bluefoxentertainment #a24 #wellgousa #wellgousaentertainment #roadsideattractions #waltdisneys #events #waltdisneystudiosmotionpictures #waltdisneystudios #change #verticalentertainment #ifcfilms #tristarpictures #covid19 #digital #sales #event #network #film #filmmakers #writer #amazon #google #streaming #microsoft #technology #water #world #liongate #mgm #2024 #boxoffice #100millionopen #sundance #skydance"
