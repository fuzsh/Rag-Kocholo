        "text": "SINGAPORE — If you’re planning to catch French director Eric Rochant’s spy drama Mobius, don’t expect to see any explosions or car chases. Because when the French say they have made a spy film, they really mean they have made a film that happens to have spies.\n\nNo, it’s not quite the stirred-but-not-shaken or this-mission-should-you-choose-to-accept-it fare that Hollywood audiences are used to. There aren’t gadgets courtesy of Q Branch, safehouses that look like the deck of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) or tricked out classic cars by Aston Martin. The spies follow people in beat-up cars and silently plot against their enemies in cheap-looking apartments. But to Rochant — who helmed the spy thriller Les Patriotes and French crime television series Mafiosa — this is how spy movies should be.\n\n“I think that Americans really want and like action, and they like technology. They are less realistic,” said Rochant. “In France, I try to be realistic because the action is on the war field, not on the intelligence field. Intelligence is very soft, it’s very intellectual. You have to manipulate somebody to make him tell you secrets they don’t want to tell.”\n\nThe 52-year-old added: “I like spy movies — not action movies — because it’s a matter of seduction, a matter of power and the fight for power. It’s very interesting because it’s very human. It’s what we do when we want to seduce somebody, when we want to frighten somebody, and when we want to get something from somebody. So I think it’s closer to the reality we know.”\n\nSome might say that Mobius might be better categorised as a steamy romantic drama rather than a spy thriller. Especially since the film revolves around a Russian intelligence officer (Oscar winner Jean Dujardin) who embarks on a torrid and forbidden love affair with his agent, a brilliant French-American financial expert (Cecile de France) who has been recruited to spy on a ruthless Russian oligarch (Tim Roth).\n\nIn that sense, these spies have one thing in common with 007: They make love a lot.\n\n“For me, Mobius is more of a love story, that’s what interested me more,” said Rochant, who also wrote the screenplay. “The real challenge was to build a very emotional relationship between two characters immersed in a very hard environment.”\n\nAnd to pull that off, the 52-year-old director made a conscious effort to cast actors with electrifying chemistry. “They are good actors, and they also have this faculty to be very glamorous, very sexy,” said Rochant of his cast.\n\nBut who does he really find more attractive — the charming de France or the George Cloonesque Dujardin? “I prefer the girls, so it’s easier for me to think (de France) is beautiful,” Rochant laughed. “But I can understand that a lot of people think that Jean Dujardin is beautiful, too.”\n\nMobius is out in cinemas tomorrow."
