In 1996, she received the Young Promising Actress César for her role in \"To have (or not)\" by Laetitia Masson. Her rise went on alongside directors such as Jacques Audiard (\"A Self-Made Hero\"), Benoît Jacquot (\"Seventh Heaventh\", \"The False Servant\"), Claude Miller (\"Betty Fisher and Other Stories\") and Pierre Salvadori (\"After you\"). In 2009, Sandrine Kiberlain crossed paths with Stéphane Brizé and shot \"Mademoiselle Chambon\". In 2011, she worked with Maïwenn in \"Polisse\". In 2013, she was directed by Albert Dupontel in \"9-Month Stretch\" and won the César for Best Actress for this role. Subsequently, she played in \"Number One Fan\" by Jeanne Herry and again in 2019 for \"In Safe Hands\", in \"Being 17\" by André Téchiné and in \"The Sweet Escape\" by Bruno Podalydès, whom she worked with again this year in \"French Tech\".
