Photos: Courtesy of Talent.\n\nMarch 5, 2024 – Paramount+ announced today that Joe Wright, the director behind the Golden Globe and multi-BAFTA winning films Pride and Prejudice, The Darkest Hour and Atonement, will direct and executive produce the new drama series from Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios, THE DEPARTMENT. An espionage political thriller series based on the critically acclaimed hit French drama Le Bureau des Legendes, THE DEPARTMENT will debut on Paramount+ for subscribers with the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME plan later this year.\n\nTony Award-winning writer Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari, Edge of Tomorrow) will executive produce and write all ten episodes. George Clooney and Grant Heslov will executive produce through their Smokehouse Pictures along with David C. Glasser and 101 Studios.\n\n“Joe Wright is a visionary director with a gift of focusing on intricate details to craft immersive and visually striking stories,” said Chris McCarthy, President/CEO Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. “And, Jez and John-Henry are masterful writers whose witty and emotionally charged language dives deep into their characters’ moral complexities, while simultaneously creating a propulsive narrative. Bringing these powerhouse creatives together alongside George Clooney and Grant Heslov is sure to give The Bureau the reinvention it deserves.\"\n\nLe Bureau centers on the daily life and missions of agents within France's principal external security service. It focuses on the \"Bureau of Legends,\" responsible for training and handling deep-cover agents on long-term missions in areas with French interests. Living under false identities for years, these agents' missions are to identify and recruit good intelligence sources. The New York Times named it one of the top international shows of the decade, and NPR has called it “addictively suspenseful” and “one of the best TV shows in the world.”\n\nLe Bureau was created by Eric Rochant and is a CANAL+ Creation Originale series produced by TOP – The Originals Productions (Alex Berger, Eric Rochant) and Federation Studios (Pascal Breton). Production is slated to start later this year.\n\nJoe Wright.
