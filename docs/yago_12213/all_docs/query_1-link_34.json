        "text": "Have an idea for Hollywood? Do you dream of writing a script? How about acting in film or TV? Or maybe even directing or producing that next big blockbuster? You can turn your vision into a market viable product, and with this book you can discover how to creatively get into the film industry on your own merits. “Absolutely fantastic, very readable, insightful, honest, and from the heart. Rather than coming from a place of an authority figure on the topics, it was presented rather from someone's actual genuine and humble experiences.” ~ Gary A. Familathe, Independent Producer “If you are just starting out or have been in the business for 20 years, Jonathan gives you the proper tools and a new perspective on the business of marketing yourself to studios. A book that should be part of any film majors curriculum.” ~ Ryan Crissey, CEO, Watch Us Fly Studios “Jonathan Thompson is the go to guy of go to guys. The lessons he shares in this book can and will apply to anyone looking to break into the business. I liked the bits of humor interjected throughout, and combined with the knowledge and experience Jonathan has, gives the entire book a warm inviting feel that doesn't detract from the educational points.” ~ Rob N., Screenwriter, Author, Artist. “This book is a must-have eye-opener for anyone trying to break into Hollywood! There is an entire business side to this industry that they didn’t teach me about in screenwriting courses. Avoid making some common and costly mistakes on the road to achieving your dreams by taking advantage of the years of wisdom within. Learning how EPs, Producers, Directors, and Investors operate and work together has caused me as a writer to better understand the entire process and appreciate the enormity of bringing my story to the screen. This should be required reading in every screenwriting course!” ~ Christie E. Hayman, Multi-Optioned Screenwriter Read \"Navigating Hollywood: How Writers, Actors, Directors & Producers Can Achieve More By Thinking Creatively\" today. Written by Jonathan Thompson with Rob Anspach and Produced by Anspach Media\n\nA rule here at RedShark Media is that everyone gets involved in writing, regardless of their role. Although proofreading the work of non-writers like myself is probably shaving years off of editor Andy Stout's life, the rule is a great way to keep the news and writing at the heart of what we do. So, it's my first full week in the (home) office, and alongside my core tasks, I've been writing. Really writing! (Not ChatGPT writing.) It's been refreshing! My first piece going live on the site gave me a real thrill—probably more than it should have. It's nothing special—just a turnaround on a press release with added context. And yet, I am absolutely buzzing! If I'm being frank, I was apprehensive about the writing rule simply because I wanted to focus on the core mission of what I've been brought in to do. But understanding the process and what goes into the writing, even for just a press release, reminded me that IS the core mission. This is what we do. Everything else I'm here working on is to serve that purpose, not the other way around. It's easy to forget the basics, but they're what everything else is built on. Now, I'm off to clear some of my kid's art off the fridge so I can hang up my article. It's Dad's turn for a gold star! 🌟😁 https://lnkd.in/eNhtKVVA #Writing #Video #VideoProduction #VideoTech #RedShark #VideoNews\n\nIndie filmmakers should be the highest paid people on their projects. (Exceptions made for name talent, because that’s just the way that goes). But otherwise? Don’t shortchange yourself when budgeting. Here’s why: - More money gives you more time to focus, in addition to your other job(s) - Respecting your own time can increase your confidence - Paying yourself fairly well sets a precedent for how you treat others The production’s success probably starts and ends with you, right? So budget accordingly. Do I get permission to do this from my investors? Of course I do. They see the sense in it. I also don’t go crazy. I save us all a ton of money through my non-traditional choices. And this all isn’t just about the money, actually. It’s about maximizing value, in a balanced and reasonable way. Hollywood doesn’t always do well with balance and reason. So why play their game, when you don’t have to? And if you don’t value yourself, who will? Be smart about it. Own your work. Believe in your worth. Build something sustainable, for you as well as others.
