        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Peter Morgan‘s next project for Netflix is likely to be a film adaptation of his stage play Patriots rather than more of The Crown, according to sources close to the writer.\n\nThere has been a flurry of reports in the UK this week about The Crown returning following the success of Scoop, but Deadline understands that Morgan is planning to take a break from the royals.\n\nOne project Morgan is prioritizing is a screen version of Patriots, which chronicles the rise of billionaire Boris Berezovsky and the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe play recouped during its 12-week run at the Noel Coward Theatre in London’s West End, helping it transfer to Broadway’s Ethel Barrymore Theatre.\n\nNetflix backed the Broadway show, marking its Broadway producing debut. A source said the deal also included a commitment to develop a Patriots film. The project is yet to be fully greenlit.\n\nWill Keen portrayed Putin in the West End and Broadway versions of Patriots. Berezovsky was played by Tom Hollander in the UK, while Michael Stuhlbarg took on the role in the U.S. version.\n\nMorgan has teased plans to return to The Crown in the future. He has admitted that the seed of an idea has taken root that will involve traveling back in time, potentially to the death of Queen Victoria in 1901.\n\nThe Sun newspaper reported this week that The Crown will return as “bite-size helpings,” starting with the reign of Edward VII.\n\nNetflix declined to comment. Morgan’s rep was approached for comment."
