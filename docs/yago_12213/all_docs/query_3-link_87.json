        "text": "\"Theme from Harry's Game\" is a 1982 song by Clannad commissioned as the theme for Harry's Game, a Yorkshire Television miniseries adapted from a 1975 novel set in The Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt has since appeared in several Hollywood movies, most notably Patriot Games, in which an IRA member, played by Patrick Bergin, is seen watching the music video for the song on his television.\n\nClannad's 1990 album Anam was released in the United States in 1992 to capitalise on the Patriot Games exposure, with \"Harry's Game\" inserted in the tracklist; the album sold well and the track was often broadcast on VH1.\n\nIn 1992, the \"Theme from Harry's Game\" was used in the soundtrack to the film Patriot Games, and it was also re-released as a single."
