        "text": "The Bureau (2015-2020) is a five-season French spy thriller action drama series created by √âric Rochant of The Patriots‚Äô fame. Monsieur Rochant seems to be obsessed with the shadow world of secret services, but as far as The Bureau is concerned, this is just a cover, a cover for a sublime love story, more or less impossible, mostly impossible. In France, the show was aired by the name of Le Bureau des l√©gendes, which I found a little stupid, but it certainly has been based on a sort of code. It has been compared with The Wire (which I have not yet watched), with Homeland (which again, I‚Äôm embarrassed to declare I haven‚Äôt watched yet, but I plan to do it asap), with 24‚Ä¶ This one I have watched and re-watched from Day 4 on, and now I regret my wasted time because by the end it transformed into some brainwashing anti-terrorist propaganda. After 9/11, terrorism became a very easily stamped label on almost everything opposing the ‚ÄòAuthority‚Äô. Besides that, the unwrapped plots in 24 were insane.\n\n[source: imdb]\n\nThe Bureau Plot\n\nThe French Secret Service is called DGSE (Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure) ‚Äì Directorate-General for External Security. They have a deeply covered agents‚Äô section called ‚Äúle Bureau des l√©gendes‚Äù because allegedly almost nobody knows about their existence. Guillaume Debailly, code-named Malotru returns ‚Äúhome‚Äù after six years undercover as Paul Lefebvre, a professor of literature in Damascus, Syria. Malotru (literally meaning ‚Äúlout‚Äù) is a man of many talents. He probably is the best spy the French services ever produced, a field agent, an analyst, and a trainer at the same time, even if he‚Äôs not looking like James Bond. You see, the thing with this show is that it seems authentic. You‚Äôre not blinded by the ultra high-tech from movies where you‚Äôre somehow introduced to the CIA‚Äôs headquarters, you look at a sort of a common building‚Äôs attic, where only very few have access. Actually, the building is not quite common, it looks more like a fortress, but the interiors seem cozy. The exteriors are filmed outside the real DGSE headquarters in Paris.\n\nI hope it‚Äôs obvious I won‚Äôt start to detail the story, it will be your pleasure if you‚Äôll find the time to watch the five seasons. I‚Äôm just emphasizing that underneath the French misadventures in their former colonial empire, this is a beautiful love story.\n\nDuring his six years undercover in Damascus, Malotru got involved with Nadia El Mansour, a renowned Syrian historian, who unfortunately was married. It may seem frivolous but it‚Äôs not, and that‚Äôs all you‚Äôll learn by watching. Everything in this movie is connected with this ostensibly impossible love story.\n\nFrance has underground interests almost all over the world, Middle East, Iran, Kurdistan, the Russian Federation, Algiers, and Iraq, you‚Äôll find out realistically how it is to be a qualified spy, presumably for your country.\n\nCast\n\nMathieu Kassovitz is Guillaume Debailly, codename ‚ÄúMalotru‚Äù (Lout). Sara Giraudeau is Marina Loiseau, a brilliant deep-cover agent while working as a seismologist, trained to infiltrate the Iranian nuclear industry and later some Russian cybercenter. Jean-Pierre Darroussin is Henri Duflot, Director of the Service of Clandestines. L√©a Drucker is Dr. Laur√®ne Balmes, a specialized psychiatrist in behavioral psychology. Zineb Triki is Nadia El Mansour, a Syrian professor of history and Debailly‚Äôs love interest from Damascus. Gilles Cohen is Colonel Marc Laur√©, codename ‚ÄúMAG‚Äù (‚ÄúMoule √† gaufres‚Äù or Waffle iron), Director of Intelligence and Henri Duflot‚Äôs boss. Florence Loiret-Caille is Marie-Jeanne Duthilleul, Debailly‚Äôs handler when he was in Syria. Pauline √âtienne is C√©line Delorme, a regional expert on the Middle East and North Africa. Jules Sagot is Sylvain Ellenstein, a tech agent specializing in electronic surveillance and hacking. Alexandre Brasseur and Micha√´l Abiteboul are P√©p√© and M√©m√© (grandpa and grandma), two DGSE agents in charge of operational support (tailing, escort, logistics, intimidation). Patrick Ligardes is Marcel Gaingouin, Director of Operations of the DGSE. Mathieu Amalric is Jean-Jacques Angel (JJA), director of the DGSE security service (DSEC) (supposedly based on the famous James Jesus Angleton). Stefan Godin is Pierre de Lattre de Tassigny, Director General of the DGSE. Alba Ga√Øa Bellugi is Prune Debailly, Guillaume Debailly‚Äôs daughter. Artus is Jonas Maury, one of the Syrian analysts. Melisa S√∂zen is Esrin, a Kurdish militant. Irina Muluile as ‚ÄúThe Mule‚Äù, a DGSE op in France with increasing importance through the end. Oleksiy Gorbunov is Mikhail Dmitrievich Karlov, Deputy Director of the FSB. Stefan Crepon is C√©sar, a talented young hacker. There are more, but the list is too long.\n\nThe Bureau ‚Äì Trailer with English Subtitles\n\nThis trailer is just enough enticing to make you want to watch the series without revealing the whole plot.\n\nSome Explanations Instead of Conclusion\n\nA few code names are taken from a Tintin novel. I have no reason to see the logic, it must be a sort of French insider‚Äô joke since Tintin was created by a Belgian author.\n\nThe acting in The Bureau is good, there‚Äôs nothing outrageously corny even after you get familiar with everybody in the story. The core characters are five or six guys from the DGSE (including Debailly, of course), Nadia El Mansour, and some new guys who appear in seasons four and five. It seems slow-paced, but it‚Äôs what one needs to settle the intertwining plots. It‚Äôs better than Sopranos because it has nothing built on the rush, the network‚Äôs notes, or the rating. Everything looks contained. The other √âric Rochant creations weren‚Äôt so perfectly strapped through the final act. I‚Äôve heard about the controversies regarding the finale, but I totally agree with the outcome even if I don‚Äôt like it.\n\nFrom the third season on, what used to look realistic to you becomes less credible. The hacking stuff in the show is science fiction, even less credible than the one in Mr. Robot. The AI technology was at its very beginnings but was used by both the CIA and FSB like it was part of the methodology.\n\nYou‚Äôre used to thinking that a Secret Service Director is a sort of untouchable, so you don‚Äôt expect him to personally threaten civilians. With Karlov, the FSB‚Äôs Deputy Director, I think they exaggerate. He appears everywhere, things copied by the producers of Tom Clancy‚Äôs Jack Ryan, another show where the mighty CIA Director pops up around the world almost like an operative agent.\n\nNevertheless, there‚Äôs no doubt The Bureau is the best French series ever created and it certainly is one of my top 5 series including The Sopranos (1999-2007), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Jeeves and Wooster (1990-1993), or Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009). My top 10 favorite shows will be the subject of a future post.\n\nIf you liked what you read (and for that I humbly thank you for your patience), subscribe to this blog by Email!
