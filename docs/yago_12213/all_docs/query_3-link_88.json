        "text": "How do you like them schedules?\n\nThe New England Patriots announced their NFL schedule with a parody of an iconic Boston flick, 1997's \"Good Will Hunting,\" starring several New England football notables as themselves and filled with in-jokes and quotes from the movie.\n\nJulian Edelman plays Matt Damon's role in the film, the troubled genius, Rob Gronkowski plays smack-talking best friend, originally played by Ben Affleck, and former director of football research Ernie Adams plays the kindly mentor-figure, as played by the Robin Williams.\n\nRobert Kraft and new head coach Jerod Mayo also make appearances in the movie parody along with the 2024 Patriots Schedule, which is teased constantly throughout the short.\n\nA highlight of the short is an exchange between Edelman and Adams, a reenactment of the final therapy scene from the film.\n\n\"It's not your fault, Jules,\" Adams says.\n\n\"Not you, Ernie. Not you,\" Edelman says.\n\n\"It's really not your fault they lost Super Bowl LII,\" Adams says before Edelman hugs him in a moment of harsh truth. \"It really isn't.\"\n\nThe short ends with the former Patriots wide receiver leaving, as Damon's character does at the end of the actual film. Before departing, Edelman slides the 2024 schedule under Adams' office door in a folder titled “Pink Stripes,” a long-running Patriots in-joke.\n\nPatriots 2024 Schedule: New England Patriots 2024 complete schedule\n\nWhat's with the end of the parody?\n\nAfter the title card for the movie parody is shown, the short abruptly cuts to four men in nun masks hectically driving a car before getting out suddenly and confronting a man in parked car.\n\nThe man says, drinking his Dunkin' coffee, \"Wrong movie, guys.\"\n\nThe masked men, rip off their masks irritated, revealing themselves to be Patriots players Marcus Jones, David Andrews, Kendrick Bourne and Demario Douglas.\n\n\"I told y'all,\" Jones said. \"Can't keep doing this with you.\"\n\nThey drive away disappointed.\n\nThis snippet at the end of the short is a reference to the 2010 film starring Ben Affleck, \"The Town,\" another fan-favorite Boston film.\n\nRin Velasco is a trending reporter.
