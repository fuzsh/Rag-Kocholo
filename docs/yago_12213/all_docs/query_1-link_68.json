        "text": "Announced last March, Poison is an adaptation of a play by Dutch playwright Lot Vekemans. The play has been translated into more than 15 languages and the Luxembourgish actress has performed in a stage version. It tells the story of the moving reunion of a man and a woman ten years after the death of their child in a car accident. This takes place in the cemetery where he is buried.\n\nFilming, which will be split between the Netherlands and Luxembourg, should start in February.\n\nPost on Instagram\n\nThe names of the two main actors had been kept secret until Nosbusch posted on her Instagram account: “Eight and a half years ago, Poison, a play by Lot Vekemans, touched me so deeply that it became my goal to adapt it into a feature film. After many ups and downs, here we are... two weeks away from our first shooting day. I feel honored to be directing this film.”\n\nAnd right behind those few lines, she tagged a few names, including Roth (60), thus confirming a rumour that has been circulating for some time. Roth is expected to play the leading male role in this production in which the Film Fund Luxembourg has invested €2.7m (the total budget is announced at €4m).\n\nThe award-winning actor has starred in more than 70 films as well as the hit-series Lie to Me. He has already played in a Luxembourg co-production (Möbius by Eric Rochant in 2013). Last year, he also starred in Bergman Island (by Mia Hansen-Love), alongside Luxembourg’s Vicky Krieps.\n\nTrine Dyrholm, Silver Bear in Berlin\n\nThe female heroine should be played by Danish actress Trine Dyrholm. Known for her roles in Thomas Vinterberg’s Festen, she was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival in 2016 for the film Kollektivet.\n\nWhen contacted by Delano’s sister publication Paperjam, Deal Productions--Nosbusch’s production company with her partner Alexandra Hoedorff--did not confirm this casting, saying it wasn’t official.\n\nThis story was first published in French on . It has been translated and edited by Delano."
