        "text": "In English: The Bureau. In my last post, on Icelandic films, I mentioned the French actress Florence Loiret-Caille, who plays a character in this brilliant, excellent, terrific French TV series created and directed by Eric Rochant, the first three seasons of which my wife and I binged-watched (on DVD; yes we still watch stuff on those) over the past couple of months. I had been hearing about the series—which began in 2015—for the past year, notably from dear friend Adam Shatz, who deemed it sufficiently compelling to devote a post to on the LRB blog (the series may be viewed subtitled in the US and most everywhere else).\n\nIn short, the series centers on the deep cover section of the DGSE (the French CIA)—dubbed “le bureau des légendes”—its operatives, and their operations, notably in the Middle East (and principally in Syria, with ISIS and all). It’s a French version of ‘Homeland’ but is far superior (I watched three seasons of the latter before abandoning it). There is no comparison between the two when it comes to the sophistication of the screenplays and knowledge of its subject matter (espionage, the Middle East, etc). The geopolitical knowledge is indeed very good and numerous languages are spoken by the French agents—English, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew—which one does not see in ‘Homeland’, needless to say. The Middle East-North Africa scenes—here, Iran, Syria, Algeria—are naturally shot in Morocco, as in ‘Homeland’, but are pulled off much better (e.g. the scenes in Tehran really do look like Tehran—so much as I imagine Tehran, at least—though the ones in Algiers were admittedly rather obviously shot in Casablanca; bon, a minor detail). And the CIA and Mossad naturally figure.\n\nThe pacing is not Hollywoodish, that’s for sure. If you like high octane, edge-of-your-seat action thrillers, with car chases and explosions, ‘Le Bureau des Légendes’ is probably not for you. On ne peut pas plaire à tout le monde\n\nAs for the casting, it’s stellar, with well-known French actors of the big screen: Matthieu Kassovitz, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Léa Drucker, Sara Giraudeau… And then there’s the Nadia El Mansour character, played by the Franco-Moroccan actress Zineb Triki—her Syrian Arabic accent is impeccable, so I am told—who is quite simply one of the most beautiful women on this planet (there is a developing consensus on this among both men and women I know).\n\nIn short, if you loved The Wire, you are certain to feel likewise about ‘The Bureau’, no two ways about it. The fourth season debuts on Canal+ this fall (and which is focused on Russia, so one reads). Will binge-watch when the whole thing is available.\n\nUPDATE: My wife and I binge-watched season 4 (July 2019) on DVD. It’s excellent, as expected, taking place mainly in Russia, with the FSB, CIA, Russian militiamen in Ukraine, and all (and none are good guys—and certainly not the DGSE). The way the final episode ends insures that there will be a season 5. On l’attend avec impatience.\n\n2nd UPDATE: We binged-watched season 5 (May 2020), streamed on Canal+. Excellent again, as expected. It takes place in Russia (Moscow), Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Egypt (Cairo, Sinai), and Cambodia (Phnom Penh). Not too much in Paris. Several of the French agents speak Russian, including Mathieu Amalric’s character, “JJA” (Jean-Jacques Angel), a clin d’œil to James Jesus Angleton (JJA, as the new chief of the bureau, descending into paranoia). Jacques Audiard directed the final two episodes (9 and 10), though will apparently not be taking over the series from Eric Rochant—who’s stepping down—if there’s a 6th season, which the (stunning, unexpected) end of the final episode leaves open."
