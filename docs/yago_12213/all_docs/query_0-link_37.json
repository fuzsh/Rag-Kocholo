        "text": "THE REWARDS OF THE CANNES international Film Festival go well beyond the pleasure of hearing the word Hudsucker pronounced with a French accent, though certainly that was one of them. Cannes offers an incomparably broad overview of world cinema, with all its contrasts and extremes. The arts of self-promotion are as well displayed here as the artistry on screen, and it takes a cool head to keep them separate. Nearly two weeks' worth of cinematic overload and celebrity drumbeating do not encourage cool thinking, but then that's the whole point. The first step to frenzy is well-orchestrated confusion.\n\nCannes thrives on that. You arrive here to daily press handouts that do not necessarily intend to shed light. From one Monday's listings, some sample film synopses: \"A deluded bank robber believes he is King Arthur.\" \"The humdrum life of a couple is disrupted by the arrival of an anonymous love poem.\" \"A nocturnal homosexual preys on elderly women, kidnapping them and killing them.\" \"A retired judge wins the affection of a young model who accidentally hit his dog with her car.\"\n\nI can't speak for the first two, since they appeared on a day when the program guide listed 166 screenings. But the third and fourth are, respectively, \"I Can't Sleep,\" a widely admired French film by Claire Denis, the director of \"Chocolat,\" and Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Rouge,\" a supremely subtle and enveloping work that could not possibly be summed up in a single sentence. Definitely not a sentence about a dog being hit by a car. But the fact that nothing at Cannes is what it sounds like only enhances the festival's suspenseful atmosphere.\n\nSo does the potential for making discoveries. This was a strong year for films outside the main competition, and a number of them will find international audiences now that this event is over. Among those that attracted attention: Hal Hartley's droll, spare \"Amateur,\" which may not expand Mr. Hartley's following but should certainly please his admirers; \"Muriel's Wedding,\" an Australian film by a director named Paul J. Hogan, not to be confused with Crocodile Dundee, although he turned up, too; \"Eat Drink Man Woman,\" a tasty, commercial comedy from the Taiwanese director of \"The Wedding Banquet,\" and \"Bandit Queen,\" a super-violent Indian film about an avenging female outlaw.\n\nThe Leningrad Cowboys, Aki Kaurismaki's hopeless musical group known for their shellacked hairdos, could be seen roaming the Croisette during the wee hours. But they didn't do much for \"Tatyana, Take Care of Your Scarf,\" an hourlong Kaurismaki film that continues the Cowboys' globe-trotting adventures. A more successful publicity gambit was the so-called Bronx Block Party to promote \"I Like It Like That.\" This bright urban comedy is directed by Darnell Martin, who brings a knowing feminine sensibility to bear on her material and who made the most of Cannes's prominence as a showcase for new film makers. As a smart, appealing, young African-American film maker with impressive talent, Ms. Martin came to the right place at the right time.\n\nFilms in the main competition usually arouse the strongest emotions in Cannes, since the festival's international audiences are not shy about expressing audible opinions. But the crowds were polite this year, perhaps because half the main competition films were so eminently forgettable. Shrugs greeted \"The Browning Version,\" starring Albert Finney and signaling every shading of Terence Rattigan's play within its first 10 minutes. Along with \"The Whores,\" a black-and-white Italian film that is exactly what it sounds like, it prompted the greatest doubts about the festival's selectivity.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
