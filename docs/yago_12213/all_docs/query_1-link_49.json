        "text": "For many years, Belgian-born screen actress Cécile de France (48) has been one of France’s leading ladies and most successful actresses in mainstream and arthouse films. She first achieved success in French cinema with hit films such as “L’Art (délicat) de la séduction” (2001) and “Irène” (2002), followed by her international breakthrough film, “High Tension” (2003). Ms. de France has been going strong ever since.\n\nAs the recipient of two César Awards, she played numerous memorable and empathic characters over the years, and she was the first star to work with the Dardenne brothers—Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne—when they made “Le gamin au vélo” (2011, a.k.a. “The Kid With a Bike”), another precious gem.\n\nEven though she works in France most of the time, making two to three films a year, and has been living there for many years, she says, je me sens profondément belge. And that’s where she was last October when she attended the Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur to introduce her latest film, “Bonnard, Pierre et Marthe,” directed by Martin Provost.\n\nThe film focuses on the life and work of French painter Pierre Bonnard and his wife Marthe, played by Vincent Macaigne and Cécile de France. The result is a highly recommended and solid piece of entertainment with powerhouse performances, taking the film d’époque genre to the next level when you see that life can imitate art, and art imitates the human heart.\n\nThis interview with Cécile de France was conducted at the Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur. In Belgium, the film will be playing in theaters from January 10 and is released through Imagine Film Distribution.\n\nMs. de France, what inspired you to play the part of Marthe?\n\nI was eager to make a film with Martin [Provost] because I have always admired “Séraphine” [2008]. That was a remarkable film, so I wanted to work with this grand portraitiste de femmes who always has this very interesting and tender approach towards mysterious female characters, and Marthe is a very mysterious woman. When I had read the screenplay, I discovered there was something very passionate to tell when she takes you on her journey. Her story begins the day she meets Pierre; it marked the beginning of her transformation as she invented a new name for herself and pretended to be a bourgeois while she was a poor peasant girl. She knew what she wanted and didn’t want, and by changing her name, pretending to be an Italian woman and erasing her past, she tried not to lose the man she loved. It made her life much more complicated than it already was; she suffered and developed asthma like a ghost from the past. That’s very powerful, and it influenced the work of Pierre Bonnard. He painted her face as if she was locked in a solitary and secret world. And when he didn’t paint her face, you saw her three-quarters, vague, or hidden. It seemed interesting to portray a character this enigmatic who kept her secret for so long and transcended her feelings in her paintings, as she became a painter too. And like Séraphine, this was a unique opportunity for me. Marthe was mentally ill, psychotic and phobic, and covering her whole trajectory until she died is very challenging for any actress. You don’t get parts like that every day, so I could not turn down this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nThe way Marthe paints, with all the movements and gestures she makes with her hands, how did you do that?\n\nÉdith Bodron did the paintings for the film, and she taught us—Vincent Macaigne and me—the technique of Pierre and Marthe. It was interesting because it brought me closer to my character; her paintings were totally different from Pierre’s. He was precise and meticulous while she worked with pastels; you need your fingers, which makes her work look more naive and childish. Her paintings are powerful, but the technique is not complicated, so it was very accessible for me. Also, she never took any classes; she never went to the Academy. She used whatever she had at home.\n\nDid you also research her life, or did you prefer to portray her how you think she could have been?\n\nNot the way I thought she was, but the way Martin did. He also gave me several books written about her. To many biographers, she was fascinating; it was apparent she was not the woman she pretended she was. So, it was fascinating to dig into all this information that is available and have a first impression of who she is. And then, it’s important to forget everything and pay close attention to Martin’s view on Marthe. The way he wanted me to portray her is pretty much how she was.\n\nWhat was it like to play Marthe at various stages in her life?\n\nThat was amazing because Kaatje Van Damme did the make-up. I think she’s the best maquilleuse in Belgian and French cinema and beyond. She did everything in a very artistic way with hardly any special effects to enhance her amazing work. The aging process of Marthe looks excellent, and it helped me tremendously. When I was made up and played Marthe as a young woman, or when she was ill, tired, or old, it helped me to bring out the emotions of each stage in her life. It was a great collaboration to create Marthe when she was young, ill, and old.\n\nWith each new role, you amaze the audience because, as a viewer, you never know what to expect. Your performances are always astounding and enriching.\n\nThat is what I try to find in each role that I play. I always hope to play roles that bring something new, something else, because you don’t want to repeat yourself. I always choose new characters to play that are very different from those I have done before. That’s very amusing; when you change costumes, or they give you a different hairstyle, and you play that other person, that’s always a real treat. But it requires a lot of work; I do most of my work at home—and do it very rigorously—to make sure I’m on the same page with the film director who knows how to tell the story, and then I offer myself to the director like Marthe offers herself to Pierre. In a way, I do the same when working with an enthusiastic film director who has a personal view on the subject and wants to say something substantially. It helps me to reach beyond that point where I wouldn’t get if I were to do it on my own.\n\nIs that the reason why you play characters that speak a universal language? Because even though you mostly appear in French-language films, your characters and how you portray them are universally appealing.\n\nI like the idea that anyone can identify with a character I play—men and women. It’s typically human that film and its universal language allow people to connect across all borders. Language shouldn’t be a restriction; age shouldn’t be a restriction. They unite us if we understand the contradictions in others. There are so many stories to tell, and seeing all those different facets in any human being is very gratifying.\n\n“Bonnard, Pierre et Marthe (2023, trailer)\n\nThat’s why you also made films such as “Around the World in Eighty Days” [2004], or “Hereafter” [2010] with Clint Eastwood as your director?\n\nI liked those screenplays a lot and was impressed by those film directors. And Clint Eastwood, well, he is unique. In France and in Belgium, he’s like God. He’s always very warm and friendly, and he trusts his entire cast and crew. He also trusted me, which was very comforting. He made me feel at home. And he usually does only one take because he loves the magic moment of that first take. So as an actor, you want to capture that, and you’d better be prepared [laughs]. But, as I said, he trusts you, so he gives you the freedom to express yourself the way you want to and do it in one take. And if you ask him to do another take, he’ll do it. But since he’s also an actor, he knows how you feel and that you know what to do. So I met all those wonderful people who were very professional and very modest at the same time. I learned a lot from them; watching them at work was very interesting. How they worked, how they collaborated with others… That was a wonderful learning experience.\n\nI thought “Hereafter” would be the start of your career in America.\n\nLater, they sent me other scripts, but those were not what I hoped for. I am very happy to work in France and in Belgium, where there’s a kind of freedom and spontaneity, and the atmosphere is very collaborative, while in the U.S., it’s all more impressive. It’s more like an industry. Here, it’s an industry too, but actors have more freedom to express themselves. Les acteurs peuvent vraiement participer à la création d’une oeuvre cinématographique, more in France than in any other country, I think. People listen to us on how we would like to portray our characters, and I like that a lot. It makes me feel very comfortable [laughs]. So I’m very happy with my films, and I don’t feel the urge to work in America to be happy.\n\nI always imagine that you go through the screenplays they send you when you’re at home, and you say ‘yes’ to one screenplay, ‘no’ to another, and ‘maybe’ to a third one. Is that how it works?\n\nThat’s exactly how it works; it’s that easy. Mostly it’s ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ There’s no ‘maybe.’ It’s like reading a book: you like it, or you don’t. Choosing a screenplay is the same. If I like it, I would like to start working on it right away; if it’s a ‘no,’ then I think non, merci beaucoup, but I’m not interested [laughs]. The reason why I accept a screenplay or a role is because of all the emotions it triggers. Does the story make me laugh, does it turn me upside down, does it interest me? Those things—so it’s very basic. I don’t pay attention to the structure of the screenplay, for example. It’s not an intellectual process; it’s what I feel when I read it. That’s how I get on board. That motivates me.\n\nIs there one film you saw when you were young that inspired you to become an actress?\n\nYes. There are several, but if I need to pick one, it would be “Orlando” [1992] with Tilda Swinton. She’s an incredible actress who blew me away with her performance when she, as Orlando, had a very unusual lifetime. With the gift of eternal youth, she lived in four centuries and experienced life through the eyes of both sexes. The transformation and polymorphy in her performance are stunning, and the film is an absolute masterpiece. It’s a film d’époque, and I love those films; they can take you on a journey covering many years.\n\nFestival du Film Francophone de Namur\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nFILMS\n\nREGARDE-MOI (EN FACE) (2000) DIR Marco Nicoletti PROD Leonardo De La Fuente SCR Marco Nicoletti, Santiago Amigorena, Jean-Luc Nivaggioni CAM Pierre Cottereau ED Antoine Vareille MUS Arland Wrigley, Jean-Claude Ghrenassia CAST Cécile de France (Dune), Dimitri Radochevitch, Riton Leibman, Nadir Legrand, Gérard Touratier, Simone Guertner, Dramandra Khassar, Xavier Denamur\n\nL’ART (DÉLICAT) DE LA SÉDUCTION (2001) DIR Richard Berry SCR Richard Berry, Fabrice Roger-Lacan (novel “Kurtz” [1998] by Jean-Marc Aubert) CAM Dominique Bouilleret ED Anna Ruiz MUS Stéphane Brossollet, Sébastien Cortella, Éric Serra CAST Patrick Timsit, Richard Berry, Cécile de France (Laure), Alain Chabat, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Ludmila Mikaël, Jessica Forde\n\nTOUTES LES NUITS (2001) DIR Eugène Green PROD Alain Bellon SCR Eugène Green (inspired by the novel “La première éducation sentimentale” [1869] by Gustave Flaubert) CAM Raphaël O’Byrne ED Emmanuelle Baude, Charlotte Teillard D’Eyry MUS Samuel Sixto CAST Alexis Loret, Christelle Prot, Adrien Michaux, Cécile de France (Prostitute with glasses), Eugène Green, Anna Bielecka, Claude Merlin, Xavier Denamur\n\nL’AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE, a.k.a.
