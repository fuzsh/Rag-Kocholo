I pronounce my “Rs,” have not gotten used to snow that doesn’t melt until July and am not inclined to shell out for a pair of Tom Brady infrared pajamas.\n\nBut when two bombs exploded at the marathon finish line in 2013, killing three people and wounding 264 others, we were all Bostonians.\n\nAs the New England bureau chief for The New York Times, I covered that terrible week of the bombing and manhunt for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and endured the grueling trial in 2015, watching in awe as survivors hobbled to the witness stand. Not many of us in the press section were able to hold back tears."
