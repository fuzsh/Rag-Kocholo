        "text": "Jacoby Brissett suited up for the Patriots for his first game action since re-joining the team on a one-year deal in the offseason when New England defeated the Carolina Panthers 17-3 in its first preseason contest at Gillette Stadium on Thursday night.\n\nThe veteran quarterback was on the field for just four plays on the Patriots opening drive and didn't complete any of the three passes he attempted before handing the ball over to rookie Drake Maye. The plan all along was for Brissett to only play on the one drive.\n\n\"We wanted to see Jacoby obviously go out there and operate, as well as Drake, mixing them in there with the ones,\" Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo told reporters after the game. \"... Next week we have the Eagles. So we'll practice against them and, who knows, the reps will probably change a little bit and we'll see what happens in the game. But that was the thought process.\"\n\nBrissett wasn't concerned with his stats but rather how well the Patriots' offense communicated out on the field. He plans to watch film from the preseason win as the team heads into joint practice this week with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"I think it's cool now to, like, watch this game, and you see the little things that got out under the lights,\" Brissett said. \"Those things that come up that you kind of thought were things you could brush under the rug that you're like, 'alright, we need to focus on this, clean up on this,' and things like that. So, I'm excited to watch the film and correct the small things going forward.\n\n\"It was mainly about communication and obviously getting plays from (offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt),\" Brissett explained to reporters after the game. \"Getting to the huddle, getting to the line of scrimmage ... And I thought it went well.\"\n\nMayo has made it clear that he anticipates Brissett being the Patriots' starting quarterback in Week 1 when New England hosts the Cincinnati Bengals. The signal caller is looking to get as many reps as possible over the next two Patriots preseason games and remaining practices.\n\n\"As much as I can get,\" Brissett said. \"I don't think it's any set number or any set amount of plays. It's just going out there and working hard every day.\""
