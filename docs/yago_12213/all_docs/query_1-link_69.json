We've got nothing left but to fall in love, like idiots.\"\n\nVery French, proto-'90s Gen X slacker romantic comedy (heavier on the rom than the com). Feels like well-trodden territory now, but I think to the film's credit it probably felt a lot fresher in 1989. It isn't terribly deep, but that doesn't necessarily mean that its observations aren't also truthful. It's certainly better than, say, Singles or Reality Bites, which I guess would be the appropriate American comparisons.\n\nIt isn't flashy, but it's well shot and directedâ€¦"
