        "text": "French-Algerian actor and director Yvan Attal is best known in France, where he's made his home since the age of two. Born in Israel but raised on the outskirts of Paris, Attal studied acting at the renowned Cours Florent drama school. While many new actors work their way through small scale television appearances and commercials before booking high profile, critically acclaimed projects, Attal's first foray into the realm of professional, big-screen acting came in the form of a supporting role in the successful independent film \"Love Without Pity\" (1989). The independent French drama by director Eric Rochant made major waves in the French film scene; Attal's debut feature film performance earned the 25-year-old actor a Cesar Award for Most Promising Actor. Attal became a mainstay in French cinema, appearing in a number of prominent films over the coming years, such as Jacques Doillon's \"Lover\" (1992) and Dominique Farrugia's \"Delphine 1, Yvan 0\" (1996). Attal also crossed successfully into English language films ranging from Michael Winterbottom's \"With Or Without You\" (1999) to the American action comedy sequel \"Rush Hour 3\" (2007). Despite his in-demand status as an actor, Attal decided to branch out, stepping behind the camera to direct his own life partner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, in the acclaimed romantic comedy \"My Wife Is an Actress\" (2001). He would also go on to direct other films, including a segment for the anthology film \"New York, I Love You\" (2008) and the comedy \"Do Not Disturb\" (2012), in which he and Gainsbourg co-starred. His career as an in-demand actor continued with leading roles in the psychological drama \"Son épouse\" (2014), another collaboration with Gainsbourg, and the drama \"Le dernier diamant\" (2014) opposite Bérénice Bejo."
