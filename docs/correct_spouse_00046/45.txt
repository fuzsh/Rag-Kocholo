15 Nov â€“ Chinese actress Ma Yashu recently refuted rumours saying that her former husband Nicky Wu is still paying her alimony despite the fact that she is now happily married to her Australian husband James Robert Hayes.

Previously, several tabloids reported that Nicky, who had just recently announced his relationship with "Bu Bu Jing Qing" co-star Cecilia Liu, has continued to make monthly alimony payments to Ma, even after four years of divorce and Ma's second marriage.

It was also alleged that Nicky had generously given her RMB 100 million (approx. USD 16.4 million) as well as six luxury homes as part of the negotiated terms of their divorce in 2009.

However, on 14 November, the actress' representative issued a press statement denying all claims, saying, "During and after their official divorce, Ms. Ma did not take any money from Mr. Wu. While they were married, they had purchased a house together, and Ms. Ma has reimbursed the sum paid by Mr. Wu during the divorce process."

The representative added that the fabricated news has sullied Ma Yashu's reputation and the actress retains the rights to pursue legal action.
