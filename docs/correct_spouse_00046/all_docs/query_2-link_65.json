Therefore, manufacturers of biological products must investigate the ability of their production processes to remove procoagulant activities. Previously, we were able to remove coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X from our IVIG preparation through ethanol precipitation, but factor XIa, which plays an important role in thrombosis, remained in the intermediate products. Therefore, our objective was to develop and test a process to remove factor XIa from IVIG.\n\nThe study samples were cleared cryo-poor plasma. A chromatographic process using a new cation-exchange (CEX) resin that binds with high capacity to IgG and removes procoagulant activities was added in a sequential step to the standard removal/inactivation process. Testing of the samples was performed using the standard process alone and then with sequential addition of the new CEX process. Procoagulant activity was tested using several standard methods, including, thrombin generation assay, chromogenic FXIa assay, non-activated partial thromboplastin time (NaPTT), and FXI/FXIa ELISA. We further spiked our samples with additional coagulation factor XIa, in amounts exceeding any variability that may be caused due to sample differences, and tested these samples for procoagulant activity using the same methods.\n\nThe procoagulant activities were reduced to low levels as determined by the thrombin generation assay: < 1.56 mIU/mL, chromogenic FXIa assay: < 0.16 mIU/mL, NaPTT: >250 s, FXI/FXIa ELISA: < 0.31 ng/mL. Even after spiking with FXIa at a concentration 32.5 times higher than the concentration in normal specimens, the procoagulant activities were below the detection limit ( < 0.31 ng/mL).\n\nWe successfully removed the coagulation factors FII, FVII, FIX, and FX through cold ethanol precipitation, and removed FXIa using chromatography. Using this novel technology can potentially reduce future thromboembolic events with IVIG since FXIa is virtually eliminated.\n\nThese results demonstrate the ability of our manufacturing process to remove procoagulant activities to below the detection limit (except by NaPTT), suggesting a reduced risk of thromboembolic events that may be potentially caused by our IVIG preparation.\n\nKeywords: immunoglobulin, chromatography, Factor Xia\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(2) CARMIL2 Deficiency And Various Clinical Phenotypes: Warning Signs For Early Diagnosis\n\nBurcu Kocamis Kolukisa, MD1, Nurhan Kasap, MD1, Sevgi Bilgic Eltan, MD2, Dilek Baser, MSc2, Gamze Akgun,2, Asena Pınar Sefer, MD1, Yasemin Kendir Demirkol, MD3, Elif Karakoc Aydiner, MD4, Ekrem Unal, MD5, Ahmet Ozen, MD4, Safa Baris, MD4\n\n1Clinical Fellow/Marmara University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Immunology and Allergy\n\n2Marmara University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Immunology and Allergy\n\n3Umraniye Research and Training Hospital, Department of Pediatric Genetic Diseases\n\n4Professor of Pediatrics/Marmara University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Immunology and Allergy\n\n5Erciyes University, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology\n\nCARMIL2(RLTPR) gene regulates CD28 co-signalization and cytoskeletal dynamics of immune cells. Immune deficiency caused by homozygous mutations in CARMIL2 has been linked to a broad range of manifestations, including allergies of the skin and respiratory tract; serious bacterial, fungal and viral infections such as disseminated warts and molluscum; EBV-related smooth muscle tumors; chronic diarrhea and growth retardation. We present a single center experience on CARMIL2 patients.\n\nWe studied seven patients (1 Male, 6 Females; current age: 16.7 years) from 4 independent families. Mean age at onset of symptoms was 48,8 months. P1 and P2 presented with chronic abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. P3 and P4, sisters, had eczema, recurrent respiratory and skin infectins including warts and molluscum. P5 presented with early-onset IBD and wheezing. P6 and P7, cousins, had recurrent skin and airway infections, eczema and warts. Eosinophilia was observed in 3/6 patients. Serum immunoglobulins were normal in half, low IgG in two, high IgG, IgA, IgM in one patient. Protein antibody responses were poor in all patients. Flow cytometry revealed low NK-cells in 5 of 6 subjects; elevated naïve CD4+ T cells in 3 of 6, and reduced memory B cells in 2 of 6. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and induction of CTLA4 were reduced in all patients. Defective CD28 T-cell stimulation and cytokine production was confirmed in 2 patients (P3 and P7).\n\nCARMIL2 deficiency may present with early onset-IBD, viral infections, eczema and malignancies. Increased naive T cells, observed in majority of patients suggests defective differentiation. Knowledge of diverse manifestations related to CARMIL2 deficiency should be envisaged for timely diagnosis.\n\nThis work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (318S202).\n\nKeywords: CARMIL2, combined immunodeficiency, Treg\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(3) Excess IL-18 and perforin deficiency distinctly and synergistically promote pathologic CD8 T-cell activation and experimental Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\n\nEmily Landy, B.S.1, Scott Canna, MD2\n\n1PhD Candidate/University of Pittsburgh\n\n2Assistant Professor/University of Pittsburgh, UPMC Childrens Hospital\n\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) are life-threatening hyperinflammatory cytokine storm syndromes. Familial HLH is associated with genetic impairment of cytotoxic function (e.g. perforin deficiency), and Prf1-/- mice succumb to typically-mild LCMV infection via CD8 T-cell/IFNγ-mediated immunopathology. MAS is clinically similar to HLH, but occurs in certain rheumatic/autoinflammatory diseases and has been associated with extraordinarily and chronically elevated serum IL-18. Improved understanding of their pathogenesis could significantly alter patient screening, diagnosis, and management.\n\nUsing mice with excess IL-18 (Il18tg) to model a state of susceptibility to MAS, we found some baseline abnormalities included decreased IL-18 receptor expression on NK cells and increased PD-1+ CD8 T-cells. Il18tg mice, but not Prf1-/- mice, developed more severe immunopathology in the TLR9-triggered model of MAS. Il18tg mice also developed MAS-like immunopathology upon infection with LCMV (Armstrong), which was largely mediated through CD8 T cells and IFNγ. As with LCMV-infected Prf1-/- mice, CD8 T cells from LCMV-infected Il18tg mice showed increased activation and cytokine production, but did not exhibit cytotoxic impairment or persistent antigen presentation. They retained KLRG1+ terminal effector differentiation and their transcriptional program was more comparable to WT than Prf1-/- mice in their absence of an exhaustion signature.\n\nMounting evidence suggests heterozygous mutations in cytotoxicity-related genes like PRF1 may promote hyperinflammatory responses in MAS patients, who also have highly elevated IL-18 levels. Though neither excess IL-18 nor perforin-deficiency individually cause immunopathology without inflammatory challenge, we observed lethal spontaneous hyperinflammation in Il18tg;Prf1-/- mice. We even observed subclinical MAS in Il18tg mice heterozygous for Prf1. These mice showed expansion of a splenic PD-1+, TIGIT+, and Tim-3+ CD8 T-cell population, yet show increased IFNg production. Additionally, spontaneous immunopathology was partially abrogated by CD8 depletion or IFNg neutralization. Together, these data suggest that IL-18 and cytotoxicity can independently and synergistically drive pathologic CD8 T-cell activation and life-threatening immunopathology in HLH and MAS.\n\nFigure 1: Dysregulation of the immune systems response to antigen/infection can lead to hyperinflammation. Excess free IL-18 (as seen in MAS) can hyperactivate CD8 T cells. Perforin deficiency (as seen in fHLH) can also lead to hyperactivated CD8 T cells along with lack of antigen removal. Together these factors can combine to cause spontaneous hyperinflammation in mice.\n\nKeywords: HLH, MAS, IL-18, Perforin Deficiency, CD8 T cell, activation\n\nDisclosures: Scott Canna received research grants from AB2Bio Ltd and IMMvention Therapeutix.

A postauthorization registry conducted in the United States and Europe assessed safety data on the courses/outcomes of pregnancy in women ever treated with fSCIG treatment and assessed the growth/development of their infants (NCT02556775; EUPAS5798).\n\nWomen pregnant during or after fSCIG exposure who provided informed consent participated in this non-interventional, 2-arm, prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter registry study. During pregnancy, women received alternative treatment (Arm 1) or continued fSCIG (Arm 2) as determined by their physician. Assessments were performed per standard of care. Data were obtained from medical records. Infants were followed for up to 2 years postdelivery.\n\nThe study included 9 mothers (Arm 1: n=2; Arm 2: n=7) and 7 infants between Dec 2015 and Dec 2019. Thirteen adverse events (AEs) occurred among 4 mothers (1 in Arm 1, 3 in Arm 2), including 2 serious AEs (SAEs; thrombocytopenia and preeclampsia) in Arm 2. None of these were considered treatment-related by the investigator, or led to fSCIG treatment changes. No local or immunologic AEs were recorded. No discontinuations of fSCIG occurred during pregnancy, and fSCIG was not associated with labor/delivery complications. All pregnancies with known outcomes (n=8) resulted in live births (mean gestational age [weight]: 38.7 weeks [3.1 kg]). Of the 7 infants enrolled, all had normal appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores. Seventeen AEs, all unrelated to the mothers’ treatment, occurred in 6 infants (1 in Arm 1, 5 in Arm 2). Among these, 2 were SAEs (cleft lip and talipes calcaneovalgus, both of mild severity) assessed as incidental findings in 2 infants in Arm 2 who had normal growth and development during the 2-year follow-up. All anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody results (from 4 mothers, 2 in each arm) were negative (titers < 160).\n\nNo AEs related to fSCIG were reported in this pregnancy registry in women ever treated with fSCIG treatment or their infants. All infants had normal APGAR scores.\n\nFunding: Baxalta US Inc.

A cohort of 10 ADA SCID patients, aged 3 months to 15 years, underwent GT in a Phase II clinical trial between 2009 and 2012. Autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells were transduced ex vivo with the MND-ADA gamma-retroviral vector (gRV) and infused following busulfan reduced intensity conditioning. These patients were monitored in a long-term follow-up protocol over 8-11 years. Nine of ten patients have sufficient immune reconstitution to protect against serious infections, and have not needed to resume ERT or proceed to secondary allogeneic HSCT. ERT was restarted 6 months after GT in the oldest patient who had no evidence of benefit from GT. Four of nine evaluable patients with the highest gene marking and B cell numbers remain off immunoglobulin replacement therapy and responded to vaccines. There were broad ranges of responses, in terms of normalization of ADA enzyme activity and adenine metabolites in blood cells, and levels of cellular and humoral immune reconstitution. These outcome parameters were generally better in younger patients and those receiving higher doses of gene-marked CD34+ cells. No patient experienced a leukoproliferative event after GT, despite persisting prominent clones with vector integrations adjacent to proto-oncogenes. These long-term findings demonstrate enduring efficacy of GT for ADA SCID, but risks of genotoxicity with gRVs.\n\n(Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00794508)\n\nKeywords: ADA SCID, Gene Therapy, Long-term Follow-up, Gamma-retroviral vector\n\nDisclosures: Donald Kohn was a consultant for Leadiant Biosciences.

Monogenic CVID accounts for 10% of cases and is often associated with immunodysregulation. NFKB1 haploinsufficiency is a monogenic cause of CVID complicated by early-onset infection susceptibility, cytopenias, lymphoproliferative disease, autoimmunity, and malignancy. We present a young male with CVID, autoimmunity, and non-malignant lymphoproliferation who was found to have NFKB1 haploinsufficiency, leading to subsequent diagnosis in several previously undiagnosed family members.\n\nClinical details regarding proband and relatives were obtained. NFKB1 variant was identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and by variant-based Sanger sequencing in relatives.\n\nA 14-year-old male with sinopulmonary infections, persistent cervical and abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, Crohn's-like colitis, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presented for evaluation. Family history showed father with CVID, ITP, splenomegaly post-splenectomy, and autoimmune hepatitis; paternal uncle with CVID deceased from lymphoma; paternal aunt with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and psoriatic arthritis; and paternal cousin with refractory thrombocytopenia post-splenectomy (Figure-1, Table-1).\n\nInitial immunophenotyping revealed poor antibody responses to tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococcus.; low IgM, normal IgG and IgA, T-cell lymphopenia, platelet-antibody-positive thrombocytopenia, and elevated double-negative-T-cells (DNTs), (Table-2). Bone marrow biopsy showed trilineage hematopoiesis; lymph node biopsy showed reactive hyperplasia. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) decreased the frequency of infections and improved platelet count. The use of rapamycin further controlled thrombocytopenia and lymphoproliferation. Infliximab improved his colitis. After several genetic evaluations, at age 21, WES identified a novel pathogenic heterozygous nonsense variant in NFKB1 (c.538C>T, p.Gln180Ter). The same pathogenic variant was found in the proband’s father, paternal aunt, cousin, and deceased paternal uncle. NFKB1 variant was also present in the proband’s asymptomatic sister and paternal uncle with a known daughter with ITP (Figure-1).\n\nNFKB1 haploinsufficiency is a monogenic cause of CVID with a high incidence of immunodysregulatory features and variable penetrance leading to diverse immunophenotypes even amongst subjects of the same family. Clinicians should pursue genetic testing in the evaluation of CVID patients especially when symptoms of immune dysregulation or significant family history are present as this case series illustrates.\n\nTable 1: Clinical Phenotype of Family Members\n\nFigure-1.

Studying patients with these disorders has been instrumental in expanding our understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation with therapeutic implications for common polygenic versions of allergic disease.\n\nClinical findings: We describe a 9-year old boy who presented with severe eczema, high blood eosinophil counts (5.8x109 cells/L, normal range: 0-0.85x109 cells/L) and high serum IgE levels (2645υg/L, normal range: 0-500ug/L) since birth. After ruling out known allergic disorders and parasitic infections are ruled out, whole exome sequencing was performed on patient and his parents trio. The patient was found to have a homozygous variant in the evolutionarily conserved fibronectin III domain of the OSMR gene (c.1307T>A, p.V436D). OSMR encodes oncostatin M receptor-beta, a component of both the OSM type II and the IL31 receptor, and is important for keratinocyte cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation. Variants in OSMR have been reported in association with familial primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis, however this condition was ruled out in this patient as skin biopsies were absent for amyloid deposits.\n\nWe transfected the c.1307T>A OSMR variant in both HEK293 cells and primary fibroblasts obtained from the patient, and observed a loss of expression of the mutated OSMR receptor on the cell surface. Signal transduction through phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was absent and phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly reduced after stimulation with OSM in patient fibroblasts. These signaling defects were “rescued” upon lenti-viral transduction of the wild-type (WT) OSMR gene (Figure 1). RNAseq analysis confirmed that OSM mediated JAK-STAT and interferon signalling pathways were deficient in the patient fibroblasts and were rescued with WT OSMR. Furthermore, an enhanced atopic dermatitis gene expression signature was observed in patient fibroblasts at baseline which was also rescued upon lenti-viral transduction (Figure 1) or upon treatment with dexamethasone (by qPCR).\n\nOur findings shed light on the disease mechanism of a novel primary atopic disorder, caused by a homozygous missense variant in OSMR.\n\nFigure 1.

Improved understanding of the determinants of early mortality may help to identify patients who will benefit from early definitive therapy.\n\nThe USIDNET database was queried for participants with a diagnosis of CID or a genetic diagnosis consistent with CID as defined by IUIS genetic classification. Participants with primary thymic defects, SCID, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were excluded. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for variable selection for multivariate analysis of factors associated with mortality.\n\n337 participants met the inclusion criteria, with a median age of symptom onset of 0.5 years (IQR 0.1years-4.0years), and a median age of diagnosis of 3.6 years (IQR 0.3years-15 years). Of this population, 38 of 332 individuals for whom data was available were deceased (11%), with a median age at death of 20.7 years. Lower mean values of absolute lymphocyte count, CD3+, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells were not statistically significantly associated with increased mortality. The most common genetic variants in the deceased participants regardless of transplant status were CD40L (17%), GATA2 (14%), DOCK8 (14%), NEMO (8%) and CTLA4 haploinsufficiency (8%). The most common genetic variants in those patients who were deceased and remained un-transplanted at time of death were CTLA4 haploinsufficiency, CD40L, ATM, STAT3, and RMRP. AIC model selection found statistically significantly decreased odds of survival for participants with variants in CTLA4 (OR 0.13), DOCK8 (OR=0.02), CD40L (OR 0.11) and ATM (OR 0.02); as well as participants with renal disease (OR 0.24), bone abnormalities (OR 0.19), invasive bacterial (OR 0.30), viral (OR 0.1) and fungal (OR 0.13) infections . Cognitive (OR 4.8), Mucocutaneous fungal (OR 14.4), and localized viral (OR 4.8) were statistically significantly associated with an increased odds of survival. Other variables selected for the AIC model included RMRP, NEMO, and neurologic comorbidities.\n\nWe identified multiple genetic variants, comorbidities, and infectious complications which appear to impact survival in CID. Determining patients at risk for increased mortality and poor outcome may influence the decision to proceed to early definitive therapy, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant and thereby improve outcomes.\n\nKeywords: Combined Immunodeficiency, USIDNET, Mortality\n\nDisclosures: Kathleen Sullivan was a consultant of the Immune Deficiency Foundation.

We describe a cohort of six unrelated male patients with a clinical and immunological presentation of recurrent infections, severe neutropenia, humoral defects, and lymphoproliferation with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Multiple patients had a relatively poor response to therapeutic or high doses of GCSF. Anti-neutrophil antibody testing was performed in 3 patients and was positive in 2 cases. Three patients required hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Exome sequencing identified novel missense variants in TLR8 gene. Five patients were mosaic for the variants, with four patients sharing the same variant. Patients with mosaic variants had less than 30% mosaicism, with similar allele frequencies in sorted immune cells, saliva and fibroblast lines. The sixth patient harbored a de-novo germline variant. All variants result in a gain-of-function (GOF) of the encoded protein in a TLR8-deficient NF-κB reporter cell line. Immune phenotyping revealed the presence of activated T cells, including the presence of T cell clones in some cases and large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL) in 1 patient. Multiple patients required IgG replacement therapy due to low B cells numbers and antibody defects. Analysis of serum cytokines demonstrated significantly increased levels of TNFα, IL-1β, IFNg, BAFF, IL-2Rα, IL-12/23 p40 and IL-18. The functional consequence of the GOF variants on primary cells was established using patient-derived iPSCs. Differentiation of myeloid cells from patient-derived iPSCs identified cells with the variant as having increased phosphorylation of NF-κB to low doses of TLR8 stimulation. Additionally, enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β was also identified, supporting the presence of cytokine-driven mechanism of disease pathogenesis. Our finding of 3 novel variants in TLR8 gene in six unrelated patients suggests a novel monogenic TLR8-associated PID.\n\nKeywords: Inborn errors of immunity, neutropenia, toll-like receptor\n\nDisclosures All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(10) Autoantibodies against type I IFNs in Patients With Life-Threatening Disease Due To Yellow Fever Live Attenuated Vaccine\n\nPaul Bastard, n/a 1\n\n1MD-PhD Student/Laboratory of human genetics of infectious diseases, Imagine Institute\n\nYellow fever virus (YFV) live attenuated vaccine can rarely cause life-threatening disease, typically in patients with no history of severe viral illness. Autosomal recessive (AR) complete IFNAR1 deficiency was reported in one 14-year-old patient. Here, we studied eight other, previously healthy patients aged 13 to 68 years, with unexplained life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease. One 13-year-old patient had AR complete IFNAR2 deficiency. Three other patients vaccinated at the ages of 47, 62, and 64 years, had high titers of circulating auto-Abs against at least 14 of the 17 individual type I IFNs, a condition recently shown to underlie at least 10% of cases of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. The auto-Abs were neutralizing in vitro, blocking the protective effect of IFN-a2 against YFV vaccine strains. AR IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency and neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs thus account for more than half the cases of life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease studied here. Apparently healthy subjects could be tested for both deficiencies before vaccination against YFV.\n\nKeywords: Yellow fever vaccine, Type I intereferons, autoantibodies\n\nDisclosures: The author had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(11) Patient, Parent, and Provider Perceived Barriers in Primary Immunodeficiency Transition of Care\n\nNeha Agnihotri, MD1, Aisha Ahmed, MD2\n\n1Assistant Professor of Medicine/University of Illinois at Chicago\n\n2Attending Physician, Allergy and Immunology/Ann and Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago\n\nWe explored the perspectives of primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients and their parents/guardians toward transition of care from pediatric to adult providers. We also compared how transition components were perceived by immunologists at our institution.\n\nUsing ICD-9/10 codes, patients with a PID were identified at Lurie Children’s Hospital (LCH) in Chicago, IL. Patients and their parents/guardians were sent separate surveys with questions derived from the validated ‘ATTITUDE’ and ‘QUARTT’ instruments for transition. Pediatric and adult immunologists at LCH and Northwestern Hospital completed respective surveys anonymously (www.surveymonkey.com). Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.\n\nOverall, 17 patients, 18 parents, 9 pediatric immunologists and 11 adult immunologists participated. Regarding the current transition process, 71% of patients reported satisfaction (mean score 3.82, SD 1.33) compared to 31% of parents (mean score 2.94, SD 1.18). All parents, providers, and over 88% of patients agreed that during transition patients should be educated about medications, patient condition, and symptoms that require seeking health care. A transition coordinator was preferred by 94.1% of patients and 77.8% of parents. About 82.4% of patients and 72.2% of parents indicated a written individualized plan for transition should be provided; 70% of providers favored this. All parents and 94% of patients wanted an adult program to have phone access to a nurse. The majority of patients and parents preferred a joint appointment with pediatric and adult immunologists during transition; providers communicating directly without patient/parent present was strongly rejected. About 53% of patients and 56% of parents indicated that providers should prepare PID patients for transition around ages 15-17; in comparison, 47% of patients, 37.5% of parents, and 55% of total providers indicated transition preparation to start when 18 or older.\n\nThis study highlights key transition components. Families identified clear communication among all involved parties and specific elements (written transition plan, phone access) as being important. Interestingly, there were differences between current recommendations regarding age of transition preparation initiation and patient/parent perspectives. Further large-scale work is needed to build transition guidelines for the PID population.\n\nKeywords: transition, primary immunodeficiency, adolescents, immunology provider\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(12) COVID-19 in 3 patients with CLTA4 haploinsufficiency and absence of autoantibodies to type 1 interferons\n\nSebastian Ochoa, MD1, Lindsey Rosen, BS2, Michail Lionakis, MD, ScD3, Gulbu Uzel, MD4, Daniel Suez, MD5\n\n1Clinical Fellow/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA\n\n2Investigator/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD\n\n3Chief, Fungal Pathogenesis Section/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA\n\n4Physician scientist/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA\n\n5Past President of the Consortium of Independent Immunology Clinics/Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Clinic PA\n\nDespite a worldwide increase in COVID-19 cases, clinical experience with SARS-COV2 in primary immunodeficiency diseases remains limited. Recent studies showed patients with defects in type 1 interferon (INF)-related pathways or those with auto-antibodies (auto-Abs) against type 1 interferons developed severe COVID-19. We report the clinical course of three patients with CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and COVID-19, and interrogated for autoantibodies to type 1 interferons at baseline.\n\nData was obtained via patient interview and chart review. Screening for anti-INF auto-Abs was carried out using a multiplex particle-based. Auto-Abs were tested for their neutralizing activity.\n\nPatient characteristics and COVID-19 disease course are shown in table 1. Patients were adults (ages 20-34), had multiple autoimmune manifestations of CLTA4 haploinsufficiency, and were managed with mTOR inhibitors, IVIG replacement, and abatacept. All patients had a known close contact with COVID-19 and tested positive via nasopharyngeal rapid antigen or PCR. Most common symptoms were nasal congestion and anosmia. Patients 1 and 2 received monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to SARS CoV2 within four days of symptom onset and had mild disease course with no hypoxemia or need for hospitalization. Patient 3 received remdesivir and dexamethasone on day 7 (day 0 is defined as the first day of symptoms), was admitted due to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and an a SaO2 of 92%. He was discharged after 3 days with delayed resolution of shortness of breath and fatigue after 4 weeks. Patients 1, 2 and 3 tested negative for SARS CoV2 at day 22, 30 and 19, respectively. Qualitative SARS CoV-19 IgG/IgM serologies obtained on day 103 (patient 1) and day 31 (patient 3) were negative. All patients were negative for autoantibodies to IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-ω at baseline.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of COVID-19 in patients with CLTA4 haploinsufficiency. Unlike reported patients with autoantibodies to type 1 interferons at baseline, 2 of our patients (patients 1 and 2) who had an early therapeutic intervention with anti SARS-COV2 mAb had a benign disease course. Whether this is related to the early therapeutic intervention and/or absent autoantibodies to type 1 interferons remains to be elucidated.\n\nKeywords: CTLA4, COVID19, Coronavirus, Interferon, SARS CoV2, CTLA4 haploinsufficiency, Primary immunodeficiency, Type 1 interferon, COVID-19, Autoantibodies to interferon\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(13) Dupilumab Therapy in STAT3 Deficient Hyper IgE Syndrome\n\nPavan Nataraj, MD1, Jenna Bergerson, MD, MPH2, Shashi Kumar, MD3, Kimberly Risma, MD, PhD4, Michelle Sabo, MD, PhD5, Amanda Urban, CRNP6, Alexandra Freeman, MD7\n\n1Resident Physician/George Washington University\n\n2Staff Clinician/LCIM, NIAID, NIH\n\n3Attending Physician/Alabama Asthma, Allergy & Immunology Center\n\n4Associate Professor/Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH\n\n5Assistant Professor of Medicine/University of Washington\n\n6Nurse Practitioner/Clinical Research Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research\n\n7Director, Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health\n\nDupilumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody blocking IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, approved to treat atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and nasal polyps from chronic sinusitis. Patients with dominant negative STAT3 mutations (LOF STAT3; Job’s syndrome) express increased IL-4R suggesting dupilumab may treat some clinical manifestations. We examined the clinical response and safety of dupilumab in LOF STAT3 patients treated for dermatitis, asthma, and/or allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillus (ABPA).\n\nWe reviewed the charts of 10 LOF STAT3 patients treated with dupilumab. We reviewed age at initiation, length of therapy, indication, subjective clinical response, and IgE level, absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and FEV1 prior to initiation and on therapy.\n\nDupilumab was initiated in 10 patients (7 female), aged 10 to 41 years. Indications included AD (6 patients), asthma (1 patient), AD and asthma (1 patient), and ABPA (2 patients). Pre-dupilumab IgE (516 to 41,336 IU/ml) was increased compared to IgE on dupilumab (available for 6 patients; 458 to 12,233IU/mL); average percent decrease in IgE was 24.7% (n=6). Baseline AEC (40 to 3320 cells/uL) was lower than AEC on dupilumab (available for 6 patients; 70 to 5480 cells/uL); average percent change 14.5% increase (n=5). FEV1 was unchanged pre- and post-therapy for the one patient with asthma and available data. All patients treated at least 2 months endorsed significant improvement in dermatitis, with decreased or discontinuation of topical steroids. One patient had severe AD flare during a treatment interruption. One asthmatic patient endorsed significant improvement in chest tightness and need for rescue inhaler, while the other reported no symptom changes. One patient treated for ABPA had significant improvement in cough, decreased sputum production, and improved radiographic findings. The second ABPA patient developed difficulties with mental clarity and discontinued use. Dupilumab was otherwise well tolerated.\n\nDupilumab administration in LOF STAT3 appears clinically promising and safe for treatment of AD, with mixed results treating asthma and ABPA thus far. Preliminary studies showed a decrease in serum IgE, but an increase in eosinophilia. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the safety and efficacy in this population, as well as the mechanism behind the improvement.\n\nKeywords: Dupilumab, STAT3, Job's Syndrome, IL-4 receptor α inhibition, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillus, ABPA, eczema, Hyper IgE Syndrome\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(14) Investigating the Impact of Germline STAT3 Gain-of-Function on Regulatory T Cells\n\nErica Schmitt, M.D., Ph.D.1, Molly Keppel, MS2, Nermina Saucier, MS3, Kelsey Toth, B.A.4, Tiphanie Vogel, M.D, Ph.D.5, Peter Vogel, DVM, Ph.D.6, Megan Cooper, MD,PhD7\n\n1Clinical Fellow Pediatric Rheumatology/Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis\n\n2Researcher/Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology/Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO\n\n3Research Technician/Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology/Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.\n\n4Graduate Student/Washington University School of Medicine\n\n5Assistant Professor, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics & Medicine/Texas Children’s Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine\n\n6Director, Veterinary Pathology Core Laboratory/St Jude Children’s Research Hospital\n\n7Associate Professor/Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology/Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO\n\nAutosomal dominant germline gain-of-function variants in STAT3 result in immune dysregulation and a broad spectrum of clinical features. A decreased frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells has been observed in the peripheral blood of STAT3 GOF patients. STAT3 signaling is involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways and in the regulation and balance of the Treg/Th17 cell polarization axis. To investigate the pathogenesis of disease we developed a mouse model of STAT3 GOF with a protein variant discovered in patients, p.G421R. STAT3 GOF mice heterozygous for the G421R mutation have a normal or increased frequency of Treg cells, and similar expression of canonical Treg markers and Treg suppressive capacity in vitro. However, in vitro induction of iTreg cells is significantly impaired in these mice. With aging, STAT3 GOF mice develop progressive lymphoproliferation. There is an increased frequency of activated CD4+ T cells and increased IFN-gamma secretion from splenocytes re-stimulated ex-vivo. To further investigate the implications of STAT3 GOF in T cells we utilized the T cell transfer model of colitis. Naïve T cells were isolated from WT or STAT3 GOF mice and adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 Rag1-/- mice. Weight loss, survival, and intestinal pathology were similar. However, phenotypic analysis of the transferred T cells after 28 days demonstrated an increased frequency of IFN-gamma positive cells, but not IL-17A-producing cells, in the intestine lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes of mice receiving STAT3 GOF T cells. Mice with colitis induced by STAT3 GOF T cells had a significant reduction in the frequency of peripherally-induced Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and intestine lamina propria, suggesting decreased formation of iTreg cells in vivo. Interestingly though, preliminary data suggest that treatment of colitis mice with STAT3 GOF Treg cells is sufficient to allow for weight gain and survival, inferring that Treg function may not be significantly altered in STAT3 GOF. Collectively, these data may imply an altered function of effector T cells due to STAT3 GOF early in the disease course of mice with colitis, and in aged STAT3 GOF mice, with a pathogenic Th1 phenotype potentially dominating.\n\nKeywords: immune dysregulation, STAT3, regulatory T cells\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(15) Germline-encoded loss of RHOG specifically abrogates human lymphocyte cytotoxicity and cause HLH\n\nArtem Kalinichenko1, Giovanna Casoni, n/a2, Loïc Dupré, PhD3, Luca Trotta, PhD4, Jakob Huemer, MSc5, Donatella Galgano, PhD6, Yolla German, MSc7, Ben Haladik, MSc5, Julia Pazmandi, MSc5, Marini Thian, MSc5, Özlem Petronczki, PhD8, Samuel Chiang, PhD6, Mervi Taskinen, MD, PhD9, Anne Hekkala, PhD10, Saila Kauppila, MD, PhD11, Outi Lindgren, MD, PhD11, Terhi Tapiainen, MD, PhD12, Michael Kraakman, PhD13, Kim Vettenranta, Prof, MD, PhD14, Alexis Lomakin, PhD15, Janna Saarela, MD, PhD16, Mikko Sepanenn, n/a17, Yenan Bryceson, PhD18, Kaan Boztug, MD, PhD19\n\n1Postdoctoral fellow/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute / St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung (CCRI)\n\n2Pre-doctoral fellow/Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n3Principal Investigator/Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna, Austria\n\n4Postdoctoral Fellow/6Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Finland\n\n5Pre-doctoral fellow/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\n6Postdoctoral Fellow/Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n7Pre-doctoral fellow/Center for Pathophysiology of Toulouse Purpan, INSERM UMR1043, CNRS UMR5282, Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France\n\n8Staff scientist/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\n9Consultant/8Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland\n\n10Postdoctoral Fellow/Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland\n\n11Staff scientist/Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland\n\n12Consultant/Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland\n\n13Postdoctoral Fellow/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\n14Consultant/Rare Disease and Pediatric Research Centers, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland\n\n15Program Leader and Deputy Lab Head/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\n16Director/Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Finland\n\n17Rare Disease and Pediatric Research Centers, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Adult Immuno/Unit, Inflammation Center, University of Helsinki and HUS Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland\n\n18Principal Investigator/Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n19Director/St. Anna Children’s Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by immune dysregulation and massive, aberrant hyperactivation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. The molecular pathologies underlying HLH are diverse. The monogenic or primary form of HLH is caused by mutations selectively disrupting perforin-mediated cytotoxicity in human lymphocytes.\n\nWe studied a patient with early-onset HLH who fulfilled all diagnostic criteria, including almost absent killing activity of NK cells. Targeted NGS-based panel sequencing did not reveal any germline mutations in established HLH-associated genes. Using exome sequencing and genome-wide SNP array, we identified biallelic germline mutations in RHOG. Genetic ablation of the RHOG gene in a model cell line and primary cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from healthy individuals confirmed its crucial role in lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Notably, despite the severe defect in exocytosis, RhoG-deficient lymphocytes showed normal activation, proliferation, and cytokine production.\n\nTo decipher the molecular pathomechanism of the RhoG deficiency, we performed interaction proteomics analysis and defined the molecular partners of RhoG in human lymphocytes. In addition to the strong association with the cytoskeleton regulators, this analysis also revealed a direct link of RhoG with the exocytosis machinery. Hence, we discovered that RhoG interacts with the regulator of cytotoxic granule (CG) release Munc13-4 and regulates docking of Munc13-4-positive CGs to the plasma membrane. This step is required for subsequent fusion of the membranes to release cytolytic cargo toward target cells. Using molecular biology and biochemical approaches, we showed that RhoG is essential for the proper function of hematopoietic Munc13-4, assisting it in binding to the membrane phospholipids. We further confirmed that this requirement for the RhoG assistance is unique for Munc13-4, which lacks the C1 membrane-binding domain present in other Munc13 isoforms.

We present a father-daughter pair with heterozygous GATA2 (c.890del, p.Asn297Thr*29) variants leading to haploinsufficiency and their distinct clinical phenotypes. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we performed comparative immune-profiling of peripheral blood, demonstrating immune phenotypic and metabolic characteristics.\n\nThe daughter presented at 15 years old with cytopenias and recurrent urinary tract infections. Bone marrow biopsies revealed hypocellularity, dyserythropoiesis, karryohexis, and erythrocyte and granulocyte atypia. An NGS myeloid panel revealed a c.890del variant in GATA2 with a 47% allelic frequency. She has recently developed recurrent panniculitis and lower extremity lymphedema.\n\nThe same variant was present in the father who presented with more severe clinical features, including HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and recurrent viral and bacterial infections.\n\nPatients were enrolled in the Human Immune Discovery Initiative (HIDI) at Vanderbilt University permitting immunophenotyping of human leukocytes using CyTOF. Cytometric evaluation revealed that the patients with GATA2 haploinsufficiency had systemically perturbed peripheral immunity compared to healthy controls including 1) increased frequencies of TEMRA, 2) 8-fold reduction in myeloid cells 3) inverted CD4:8 ratios, 4) increased expression of markers of activation (CD44, CD95, CXCR3, and CD57) and metabolism (ATP5a, CPT1a, GLUT1, GLUT3) in T- and B-cell subsets, and 5) increased expression of markers of glycolysis (GLUT1, GLUT3) in monocytes.\n\nGATA2 haploinsufficiency leads to a spectrum of clinical illness with monocytopenia, and decreased frequencies of B- and NK-cells. Utilizing CyTOF, we have gained a more complete understanding of immunity in patients with known or suspected inborn errors of immunity (IEIs). Our findings are consistent with reports of known GATA2 haploinsufficiency (6,7); however, this is the first analysis, to our knowledge, of the immunometabolic profile of patients with GATA2 haploinsufficiency. Our data suggests an undescribed metabolic activation across lymphoid and myeloid lineages in our patients.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nImmunometabolic phenotyping of T cells in patients with Gata2 Haploinsufficiency compared to healthy control\n\nKeywords: GATA2 Haploinsufficiency, Immunometabolism, Mass Cytometry\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(17) Unusual presentation of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma in patients with BENTA disease\n\nBradly Bauman, MS1, Stefania Pittaluga, MD, PhD2, Yu Zhang, PhD3, Sergio Rosenzweig, MD, PhD4, Ronald Anderson, MD5, Gregory Gulcher, MD6, Iwona Auer, MD7, Renee Perrier, MD8, Martin Campbell, MBSS Msc9, Magdalena Schelotto, MD10, Nicola Wright, MD, MSc, FRCPC5, Helen Su, MD PhD11, Andrew Snow, PhD12\n\n1Graduate Student/Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Therapeutics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA\n\n2Senior Research Physician/Lab of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.\n\n3Staff Scientist/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology & Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health\n\n4Senior Investigator/Immunology Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine, NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA\n\n5Clinical Associate Professor/Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\n6Associate Professor/Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\n7Clinical Associate Professor/Alberta Precision Laboratories, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\n8Clinical Associate Professor/Department of Medical Genetics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\n9Consultant Oncologist/Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia\n\n10Clinical Investigator/Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Fundación Pérez Scremini, Hospital Pereira Rossell, Montevideo, Uruguay\n\n11Senior Investigator/Laboratory of Clinical Immunology & Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health\n\n12Associate Professor/Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Therapeutics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD\n\nSubcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, comprised of neoplastic CD8+ TCRalpha/bet+ cytotoxic T cells that surround adipocytes in the panniculus. Primary SPTCL is frequently associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and germline, biallelic loss-of-function mutations in HAVCR2, which encodes for the immunomodulatory receptor T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (TIM-3). In contrast, atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis (ALLP) or secondary SPTCL can occur in the context of infection or autoimmune disease, often accompanied by somatic mutations in infiltrating T cells, and can be difficult to distinguish from primary SPTCL. Here we describe two unrelated patients with confirmed B cell Expansion with NF-□B and T cell Anergy (BENTA) disease and a novel presentation of SPTCL/ALLP. Patient 1 presented early in life with recurrent infections and transitional B cell lymphocytosis, linked to a novel gain-of-function (GOF) mutation in the lymphocyte-specific scaffold protein caspase activation and recruitment domain 11 (CARD11, p.Lys238del), consistent with BENTA disease. By age 2, he developed SPTCL-like lesions and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis / nephrotic syndrome. Following relapse after initial CHOP chemotherapy, the patient was successfully treated with cyclosporine A and has remained in remission since, with prophylactic TMP-SMX and no infections. Subsequent histopathological analyses of skin biopsies suggested lupus-associated ALLP with no clonality and normal TIM-3 expression. Patient 2 presented with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, elevated naïve B cells, and confirmed SPTCL at 18 months, with widespread cutaneous involvement and evidence of HLH. Genetic analysis revealed two de novo, in cis germline GOF mutations in the LATCH domain of CARD11 (p.Glu121Asp, p.Gly126Ser), confirming a diagnosis of BENTA disease. No HAVCR2 mutations were detected. After a poor response to multiple rounds of chemotherapy, she required autologous bone marrow transplant and has been in remission since, with no infectious complications. These cases illuminate an unusual pathological manifestation for BENTA disease, and further suggest that CARD11 GOF mutations can contribute to the development of cutaneous T cell dyscrasias and/or malignancies involving both CD4+ (Sézary syndrome) and CD8+ (SPTCL) lineages, or both (ALLP).\n\nKeywords: CARD11, SPTCL, BENTA, lobular panniculitis, B cell lymphocytosis, ALLP\n\nDisclosures: Gregory Gulcher received a research grant from Blue Bird Bio.

Hypomorphic NEMO mutations cause anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency in males. Recently, NEMO deleted exon 5 autoinflammatory syndrome (NEMO-NDAS) was reported in both males and females, characterized by infantile-onset fevers, panniculitis, and immunodysregulation. We report a case of NEMO-NDAS and the evaluation necessary for the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient presented at age 6 weeks with fevers and rash; inflammatory markers were elevated. Infectious etiologies were excluded and she responded to corticosteroids, but symptoms returned with tapers. Extensive clinical investigations pursuing an etiology were most notable for granuloma formation (in bone marrow, stomach, liver, and dura mater) and low B cells with hypogammaglobulinemia. Clinical trio exome sequencing (ES) was negative. Research analysis suggested dysregulated interferon responses in patient-derived cells. RNA-sequencing from fibroblasts revealed a deletion of IKBKG exon 5, present in 97% of transcripts, consistent with skewed X-inactivation. Targeted exome analysis of IKBKG was uninformative due to a nearby pseudogene. Nanopore long read sequencing was then done and identified a presumed de novo IKBKG splice site variant, c.519-2A>C, originating on the paternal allele. Fibroblast protein electrophoresis confirmed 95% of the patient’s NEMO protein was the shorter form.\n\nHer predominate clinical features have been recurrent fever and wide-spread panniculitis. She has also developed multiple infections in the setting of chronic immunosuppression, requiring IVIG replacement and anti-microbial prophylaxis, including frequent upper respiratory and urinary infections, Pneumocystis pneumonia, HSV-1 and BK viremia, and disseminated candidiasis. She has trialed numerous immunomodulatory treatments (anti-TNF, IL-1, IL-6R, and IL-12/23 agents, costimulatory blockade, JAK inhibition). However, her disease is refractory to all steroid-sparing attempts and she has remained on corticosteroids since presentation. She exhibits multiple sequelae of chronic illness and steroid use including adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, short stature, osteoporosis, and papilledema. She is now 10 years old and undergoing evaluation for bone marrow transplant.\n\nNEMO-NDAS is a new monogenic autoinflammatory disease characterized by an interferon signature. Thorough genetic evaluation for NEMO-NDAS should be considered in cases of early-onset fevers, severe immune dysregulation and panniculitis if clinical ES is unrevealing.\n\nKeywords: IKBKG, NEMO, immune dysregulation, genetics, case report\n\nDisclosures: Jill Rosenfield, Fan Xia, Lindsay Burrage, and David Murdock work for the Human Genetics Laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine which receives revenue from clinical genetic testing completed at Baylor Genetics Laboratory.

Previously, we identified 4 patients with gain-of-function splice site variants in IKBKG using targeted sequencing. These variants caused in-frame splicing-out of exon 5 and a novel chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE)-like autoinflammatory disease (AID) called NEMO-deleted exon 5 autoinflammatory syndrome (NEMO-NDAS). Because an IKBKG pseudogene (IKBKGP1) complicates genetic diagnosis of NEMO-NDAS by standard methods, we sought to develop a customized bioinformatics approach to identify disease-causing splice site variants in IKBKG.\n\nA bioinformatics pipeline to computationally mask the IKBKGP1 pseudogene was used in whole exome/genome sequencing (WES/WGS) from patients with undifferentiated AIDs enrolled in an IRB-approved protocol. Western blot, cDNA sequencing, RNA-seq and an interferon (IFN) response gene (IRG) score (Nanostring) were performed.\n\nOut of 682 individuals, including patients with undiagnosed AIDs and their parents, 13 patients (9 females and 4 males) with 8 different de novo splice-site variants in IKBKG were identified. All patients had early-onset disease (2 days to 3 years old), panniculitis, systemic inflammation and elevated IFN signatures. Other manifestations (>70%) included failure to thrive, lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and B-cell lymphopenia. All patients were steroid-dependent and partially responded to anti-TNF (n=8) or JAK-inhibition (n=5) therapies. One patient died from opportunistic infections and another from sudden cardiac arrest. cDNA sequencing showed exon 5 skipping in the 10 patients tested and Western blot confirmed the splice product in 5/5 patients. RNA-seq showed a high frequency of exon 5 skipping in the 6 patients tested. The IFN scores had higher expression of IRG’s harboring NF-kB binding sites (CXCL10, GBP1 and SOCS1) than IRG’s without. Screening of IKBKG exon 5 splice-site variants in internal and public WES/WGS databases with more than 2,000 subjects is ongoing.\n\nWe describe a novel CANDLE-like autoinflammatory disease caused by de novo splice-site variants in IKBKG. Our bioinformatics pipeline masking the pseudogene provides a diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of WES/WGS data and early recognition may allow for better outcomes.\n\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the NIH-NIAID-IRP\n\nKeywords: IKBKG, NEMO, autoinflammatory disease, NEMO-deleted exon 5 autoinflammatory syndrome, panniculitis, cytopenia, bioinformatics\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(20) Thymus Hypoplasia Resulting from 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Corrected by Reconstitution with Normal Mesenchymal Cells\n\nPratibha Bhalla, PhD1, Igor Dozmorov, PhD2, Christian Wysocki, PhD, MD3, Ashwani Kumar, n/a4, Chao Xing, n/a5, Ondine Cleaver, PhD6, Mary Louise Markert, MD PhD7, M.

Thymus tissues that were obtained from 22q11.2DS patients are size-restricted. This results in reduced T cell output, measured as low TRECs. This is very similar for patients with autosomal recessive FOXN1 mutations. In both clinical settings, an allogenic thymus tissue graft is a preferred treatment option to resolve the stromal cell defects characteristic for 22q11.2DS and FOXN1 mutations. To determine the molecular mechanisms contributing to a small thymus size caused by 22q11.2del, we compared the development of the thymus in embryos from mouse models of 22q11.2del relative to those from normal controls and from Foxn1 mutant mice. Reaggregate fetal thymic organ culture assays established that mesenchymal cells were causal to the formation of a small thymus in the setting of 22q11.2. Experimentally, replacing mesenchymal cells from 22q11.2del hypoplastic lobes with equivalent numbers of normal ones restored thymus tissue growth and thymopoiesis. Normal thymic epithelial cells could not support this tissue regeneration. This is distinct from the Foxn1 mutant mice, wherein the thymic epithelial cells cause the thymus hypoplasia/aplasia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of normal and hypoplastic thymus lobes revealed a differential gene expression that primarily impacted 5 distinct mesenchymal cell subsets. Differential expression of transcripts involved in cell-cell interactions, collagen matrices, and growth factors were evident in the hypoplastic lobes. This contrasted the transcriptome differences using hypoplastic lobes from Foxn1 mutant mice, wherein TECs are primarily impacted. Taken together, these findings suggest novel approaches for restoring thymus function in various clinical settings.\n\nKeywords: DiGeorge Syndrome, Thymus Hypoplasia, Low TRECs, 22q11.2 Syndrome, Chromosomal Microdeletion\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(21) Constrained chromatin accessibility in PU.1-mutated agammaglobulinemia patients\n\nCarole Le Coz, PhD1, David Nguyen, MD PhD2, Amy Stiegler, PhD3, Amy Rymaszewski, PhD4, Jennifer Puck, MD5, Kathleen Sullivan, MD, PhD6, John Routes, MD7, Joud Hajjar, MD8, Sarah Nicholas, M.D.9, Prescott Atkinson, MD, PhD10, James Verbsky, MD, PhD11, Ivan Chinn, MD12, Alexander Marson, MD PhD13, Neil Romberg, MD14\n\n1Research Associate/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\n2Assistant Adjunct Professor/UCSF\n\n3Research Associate & Scientist/Yale university\n\n4Research Associate/Medical College of Wisconsin\n\n5Attending Physician/Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood and Marrow Transplant Division, University of California San Francisco Benioff Children’s Hospital\n\n6Professor of Pediatrics, Chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology/The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n\n7Professor of Pediatrics, Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology/Medical College of Wisconsin\n\n8Assistant Professor of Immunology, Allergy, and Rheumatology/Baylor College of Medicine\n\n9Assistant Professor, Division of Immunology, Allergy and Retrovirology, Department of Pediatrics/Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine\n\n10Professor of Pediatrics/Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology University of Alabama at Birmingham\n\n11Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology/Medical College of Wisconsin\n\n12Assistant Professor/Baylor College of Medicine/ Texas Children's Hospital\n\n13Associate Professor/UCSF, Gladstone Institutes\n\n14Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nPU.1 is a pioneer transcription factor that determines hematopoietic cell fate by decompacting stem cell heterochromatin, regulating expression of PU.1-controlled genes and recruiting non-pioneer transcription factors to otherwise inaccessible nucleotides. Although PU.1 deficiency fatally arrests lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis in mice and PU.1 mutations are common in human myeloid leukemias, primary PU.1-mediated diseases have yet not been described. Here, we identify six unrelated, agammaglobulinemic subjects each harboring novel, non-synonymous heterozygous mutations (four de novo, two unphased) in SPI1, the gene encoding PU.1.\n\nTo determine if and how SPI1 mutations cause PU.1-mutated agammaglobulinemia (PU.MA).\n\nPU.MA subject DNA, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were analyzed with whole exome sequencing, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq), flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The transcriptional capacity, tertiary stability, nuclear localization and DNA binding strength of PU.1 mutants were assessed with reporter lines, confocal microscopy, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, circular dichroism spectroscopy and quantitative fluorescence polarization. Hematopoiesis was modelled in vitro using genetically edited RS4;11 pro-B cell lines and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).\n\nAll PU.MA subjects lacked circulating B cells and were deficient of PU.1-high expressing conventional dendritic cells. CITE-seq analysis of PU.MA marrow displayed developmental arrest between the pro and pre-B cell stages when there was a rising demand for PU.1 and PU.1-dependent gene products like BTK, FCRLA and IGLL5. In vitro HSCs genetically edited to carrying patient-similar SPI1 mutations, failed to differentiate into B cells. When overexpressed in HEK293 lines, three of six mutant, patient SPI1 alleles failed to produce detectable protein. The three detectable PU.1 mutants failed to drive transcription in reporter cells but also did not interfere with wild type PU.1’s ability to do so. Of these, one PU.1 mutant failed to localize to the nucleus and two mutants localized but could not bind target DNA. In SPI1-excised RS4;11 lines, PU.1 loss constrained chromatin access for non-pioneer TFs critical for B-cell development.\n\nOur findings identify and molecularly describe a novel form of autosomal dominant agammaglobulinemia. PU.MA agammaglobulinemia underscores the essential, dose-dependent role of PU.1 in human B-cell lymphopoiesis.\n\nKeywords: agammaglobulinemia, hematopoiesis, Pioneer Transcriptional Factor, PU.1, B cells\n\nDisclosures: John Routes had contracted research at CSL Behring and Evolve Biologics.

One hundred and three children with congenital athymia and 2 with severe combined immune deficiency received cultured thymus tissue implantation (CTTI) over 27 years at a single center.\n\nObjectives: Objectives of the study were to assess survival, T cell numbers and function, adverse events, and infections.\n\nThe 105 patients received CTTI under one of 10 IRB approved protocols. Ninety-five patients with athymia met the eligibility criteria for complete DiGeorge anomaly or FOXN1 and had naïve T cells < 50/mm3. Ten additional patients were enrolled in an expanded access protocol and were evaluated separately. Ninety-five patients were included in the Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS); 10 additional patients were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS).\n\nThe EAS shows Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rates at year 1 and year 2 post-implantation of 77% and 76% respectively. The median follow-up time for the EAS is 7.6 years and ranged from 0 to 25.5 years. The median CD3 T cell counts in the EAS were >600/mm3 2 years post implantation and remained below the 10th percentile for age. After developing naïve T cells, the patients were able to clear disseminated infections such as mycobacteria and parainfluenza III virus. The proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin was normal. In the first year of life, there were adverse events such as autoimmune disease, fever, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central line infections. Infections were responsible for 12 deaths, all during the first year post implantation. Of the 10 additional patients in the FAS, there were 3 deaths with a survival similar to the EAS.\n\nThe use of CTTI in athymic infants led to an excellent survival based on the Kaplan Meier Curve of the EAS analysis set. Of 95 patients, there are 70 survivors whose median age is 12.7 years post CTTI. All deaths related to poor immunity occurred in the first 2 years post CTTI. The development of T cell immunity enabled the patients to fight off infection. In summary, CTTI is a life-saving investigational therapy for congenital athymia.\n\nKeywords: Thymus Transplantation, congenital athymia, athymia, complete DiGeorge, CHARGE, 22q11.2 deletion\n\nDisclosures: Mary Markert received a research grant from Enzyvant Therapeutics, GmbH.

Somatic reversion refers to the spontaneous repair of a pathogenic germline genetic variant and has been reported to occur in a number of inborn errors of immunity with a range of impacts on clinical outcomes of these conditions. DOCK8 deficiency due to bi-allelic inactivating mutations in DOCK8 causes a combined immunodeficiency characterised by severe bacterial, viral and fungal infections, as well as allergic disease and some cancers. Here, we describe the clinical, genetic and cellular features of three patients with bi-allelic DOCK8 variants who, following somatic reversion in multiple lymphocyte subsets, exhibited improved clinical features, including complete resolution of infection and allergic disease, cure over time. Acquisition of DOCK8 expression restored defective lymphocyte signalling, survival and proliferation, as well as CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, CD4+ T cell cytokine production, and memory B cell generation compared to typical DOCK8-deficient patients. Our temporal analysis of DOCK8-revertant and DOCK8-deficient cells within the same individual established mechanisms of clinical improvement in these patients following somatic reversion and revealed further non-redundant functions of DOCK8 in human lymphocyte biology. Lastly, our findings have significant implications for future therapeutic options for the treatment of DOCK8 deficiency.\n\nKeywords: DOCK8, Somatic reversion, lymphocyte effector function, inborn errors of immunity\n\nDisclosures: The author had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(24) LRBA facilitates autophagy through binding to PIK3R4\n\nLaura Gamez-Diaz, PhD1, Bodo Grimbacher, Prof. Dr. med.2\n\n1Postdoc/Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center of the University Hospital, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany\n\n2Head of the laboratory/Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Germany\n\nPatients with lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency present with a plethora of immune related defects including low numbers of switched memory B cells and plasma cells, as well as an impaired production of antibodies, leading to recurrent infections. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the defective B cell response remain unknown. To gain better insights into the possible roles of LRBA in B cell physiology, we screened for LRBA-interacting proteins using in silico analysis. Following validation by co-IP and PLA, we identified that endogenous LRBA interacts through its WD40 domain to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 4 (PIK3R4) in B cells. PIK3R4 (aka VPS15) is the regulatory subunit of VPS34, the catalytic subunit of the PI3K-III complex, which acts as a positive regulator of autophagy by producing phosphatidyl inositol-3 phosphate (PI(3)P). In fact, we observed that reduced LRBA impaired the production of PI(3)P upon autophagy induction leading to a blockade of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and resulting in a reduced mobility, abnormal accumulation and increased size of autophaghosomes, accompanied by an atypical lysosomal positioning, altogether causing an overall impaired autophagy flux and a decreased degradation of cargo material. Interestingly, LRBA-deficient cells exhibited enhanced activity of mTORC1 signaling, a key suppressor of autophagy whose activation possibly contributes to defective autophagy. Taken together, B lymphocytes lacking LRBA can form autophagosomes but they fail to fuse with lysosomes. Thus, we propose a role of LRBA at late stages of autophagy through the binding to PIK3R4, which is essential for plasma cell differentiation.\n\nKeywords: LRBA, autophagy, B cells, primary immunodeficiency, mTOR, PIK3R4\n\nDisclosures: Bodo Grimbacher received a research grant from Baxalta.

IL-18 is an inflammasome-activated cytokine associated with augmenting the production of Th1 cytokines like IFNg and promoting cellular cytotoxicity. IL-18 is naturally and potently inhibited by IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). Serum IL-18 levels correlate strongly and specifically with MAS, particularly in the context of activating mutations in the NLRC4 inflammasome. What induces IL18 production and where it comes from in MAS remain unknown. Mice with excess IL-18 signaling (IL18BP KO) develop more severe TLR9 driven MAS. However, in a model of murine NLRC4 inflammasome hyperactivation, excess serum IL-18 comes from intestinal epithelial cells but, is not sufficient to exacerbate the TLR9 driven model of MAS. By contrast, the intestinal microbiota are critical for the development of TLR9-MAS in WT mice. We treated WT and IL-18BP KO mice with broad spectrum antibiotics prior to TLR9 stimulation with CpG and found that antibiotics were minimally protected in IL-18BP KO mice, suggesting that the microbiota may not be necessary for pathogenic IL-18 induction. Indeed, mice colonized with immunostimulatory microbes (Segmented Filamentous bacteria or Tritrichomonous) were not more susceptible to TLR9-MAS. Furthermore, increased IL-18 in TLR9-MAS did not derive from intestinal microbiota, suggesting it may derive from myeloid cells. We queried publicly available transcriptional data and found that IL18 transcription was frequently stimulated by Interferon signaling and strongly correlated with PPARg transcription in macrophages. Overall, these data suggest that although the intestine is a rich source of IL-18, gut-derived IL-18 may not be efficient at promoting MAS. Understanding the signals that drive IL-18, potentially including IFN and PPARg may help us to understand susceptibility to MAS.\n\nKeywords: Macrophage Activation Syndrome, Hyperinflammation, IL-18, Cytokine, PPARg, Interferon, Microbiome, Antibiotics\n\nDisclosures: All authors indicated they had no financial relationships to disclose.\n\n(26) Recurrent inflammatory episodes, urticaria, and severe T-cell lymphopenia due to a novel heterozygous CD48 mutation\n\nLaura Ann Wang, MD, MPH1, Vijaya Knight, MD, PhD2, Kaylee Dollerschell, MS, CGC3, Jordan Abbott, MD, MA4, Cullen Dutmer, MD4\n\n1Allergy & Immunology Fellow/Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA\n\n2Associate Professor of Pediatrics/Section of Allergy & Immunology, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA\n\n3Instructor of Pediatrics/Section of Genetics & Metabolism, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA\n\n4Assistant Professor of Pediatrics/Section of Allergy & Immunology, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA\n\nCD48 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family that is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and plays an important role in lymphocyte activation and differentiation. Volkmer et al recently described a 24-year-old man with a history of recurrent inflammatory disease in which a de novo S220Y mutation in the GPI-anchor region of CD48 was reported as causative.1 Herein, we describe a young man with a novel CD48 mutation affecting the same codon (S220F), resulting in a similar clinical phenotype.\n\nA 17-year-old male presented with a 14-year history of recurrent fever, fatigue, and atypical urticaria. Episodes lasted 4-7 days. The episodes occurred as frequently as monthly but became less frequent. Two severe episodes required hospitalization, where lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed. His infection history included 2 episodes of norovirus gastroenteritis, 1 episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis, and 1 influenza A (2009-H1N1) infection, all of which triggered inflammatory episodes.\n\nHis inter-episode diagnostic evaluation revealed severe T-cell lymphopenia (214 cells/mcL), high sCD25 (1233 pg/mL), high triglycerides (171 mg/dL), low IgM (19 mg/dL), and Streptococcus pneumoniae antibody deficiency. T-cell proliferation to phytohemagglutinin, NK-cell cytotoxicity (chromium release), ESR, CRP, and ferritin were normal. Trio whole-exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous variant in CD48 (c.659C>T, p.S220F) and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated reduced T-cell, B-cell, and monocyte surface CD48 expression.\n\nWe report a novel, de novo, heterozygous variant in CD48 associated with recurrent inflammatory episodes and severe T-cell lymphopenia that recapitulates the clinical phenotype induced by another aromatic amino acid substitution at codon 220.1 Serine 220 is the site of covalent GPI anchor attachment, and loss of that attachment point is proposed to result in reduced surface membrane CD48. The precise mechanism of pathogenicity remains to be determined.\n\nReferences: 1. Volkmer B, Planas R, Gossweiler E, et al. Recurrent inflammatory disease caused by a heterozygous mutation in CD48.
