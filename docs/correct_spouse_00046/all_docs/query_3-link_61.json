        "text": "Relationship Therapy\n\nBeing in lasting relationship with others is hard work no matter how much love and good intention underly our unions! Coming to therapy with our partners and loved ones is one way to invest in our relationships, intentionally carving out the space to talk about how we meet each other’s needs and repair inevitable hurt. Couples often seek therapy during moments of crises, such as betrayal, and transitions, but I believe most relationships can benefit from therapeutic interventions to reduce conflicts and gain longevity as well as joy.\n\nI am trained in the Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy (PACT) which works with long term love relationships using principals of attachment and brain science. Using this approach, I help couples to better understand each other’s needs, emotions, and reactions, and resolve conflicts with win-win solutions. Therapy can facilitate each partner to fully see and understand the other and work together on mutual goals which serve the health of the relationship. What this looks like in the room ranges from gaining insight into each other’s attachment styles, which are often predicated on past experiences, and how attachment styles play out in the relationship, talking through conflicts in more productive ways, practicing skills to attune to each other emotionally and regulate each other when needed, and developing guardrails and guidelines for being in relationship with each other.\n\nWhile our profession often thinks of “couple’s therapy” as therapy with monogamous, dyadic pairing (and quite frankly with the assumptions that they are white and heterosexual), I invite folks in non-monogamous and non-dyadic relationships.\n\nI also enjoy working with friend, sibling, and parent-child pairings as well.\n\nBecause there are more people in the room, I generally recommend 90 - 120 minute sessions with couples and relationships, with a 2-3 hour long initial session."
