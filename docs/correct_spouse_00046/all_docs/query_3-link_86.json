        "text": "It is amazing how the entertainment industry has witnessed some of the most unusual yet loving love stories over the years in real life. We have seen how multiple actors have gotten along while shooting together on their respective projects which has further led to relationships and eventually marriage. While stories about these instances is a plenty, one type of story that isn't as common but fascinating is about couples meeting on show sets and falling in love but the show not working out.\n\nThis rare instance happened with actors Yashu Dhiman and Pulkkit Sandhu. In an interesting instance, both Dhiman and Sandhu were signed on to play important roles for an upcoming TV show. They even started shooting together for the show but unfortunately that show never saw the light of the day and was scrapped. Nevertheless, Dhiman and Sandhu instantly hit it off and it led to their journey together of first becoming friends and then deciding on forever.\n\nNow, Dhiman and Sandhu have tied the knot and did so back on 24th June 2021 in the latter's hometown after a courtship of two years. Talking about it with ETimes TV, Dhiman said, \"Pulkkit and I met during the mock shoot for a TV show, which got scrapped eventually. Show toh nahi ban paaya, par hum dono mil gaye. We hit it off instantly and became friends. Soon our friendship blossomed into love.”\n\nInterestingly, their wedding was initially supposed to take place in April but the groom-to-be had tested positive for COVID-19. Once he recovered, their families planned on a new date without any further ado. Dhiman said, “I had grand plans for my big day. I wanted all my friends to attend the wedding. However, owing to the lockdown and restrictions, we opted for an intimate family-only affair. We got engaged a day before our wedding. But we plan to host a party for our close friends once we are back in Mumbai.\"\n\nWe wish the newlywed couple loads of congratulations."
