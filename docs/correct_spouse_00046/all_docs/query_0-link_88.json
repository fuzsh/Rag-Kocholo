LORD YESHUA THE MESSIAH, SON OF ALLAH, HAVE MERCY ON US SINNERS.\n\n“There is a Trinitarian dimension to the most dearly-loved of single-phrase Orthodox prayers, the Jesus Prayer, an ‘arrow prayer’ used both at work and during times of quiet. In its most common form this runs: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner. This is, in outward form, a prayer to the second person of the Trinity, the Lord Jesus Christ. But the other two persons are also present, although they are not named. For, by speaking of Jesus as ‘Son of God’, we point towards his Father; and the Spirit is also embraced in our prayer, since ‘no one can say “Lord Jesus”, except in the Holy Spirit’ (1 Cor. 12:3). The Jesus Prayer is not only Christ-centered but Trinitarian.\"\n\nMetropolitan Kallistos Ware of Diokleia\n\nUkrainian (Plural): Господи Ісусе Христе, наставниче,Сину Божий,помилуй нас!

And there’s always room for more.”\n\n“I have come to regard with some suspicion those who claim that the Bible never troubles them. I can only assume this means they haven’t actually read it.”\n\n“I explained that when our gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender friends aren’t welcome at the table, then we don’t feel welcome either, and that not every young adult gets married or has children, so we need to stop building our churches around categories and start building them around people.”\n\n+LORD JESUS YESHUA THE MESSIAH CHRIST, SON OF GOD/ALLAH, THROUGH THE POWERFUL PRAYERS OF Saints Mary Magdalene the Apostle, Mother Maria Skobtsova the New Martyr of Paris, Mother Walatta Petros, Father Moses the Ethiopian, Holy Byzantine Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes The Merciful, Pulcheria the Holy Byzantine Empress, Coretta Scott King, Maya Angelou, Mary of Egypt, Marsha P.

And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and lo, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. And Moses said, “I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.” When the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here am I.” Then he said, “Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.

He accomplished many victories and acts of courage against the [King’s] servants. While he was held in great honour by the tyrant and his troops, he received messages on several occasions from the King of the Christians that he should come to Him, and be with Him, and be honoured with great gifts and reign with Him. He, however, for some years did not want to do so and increased his warfare against Him still more fiercely. One day, though, when he had come to doubt himself and had become sorrowful, he decided to take flight and go alone to the King…. When he approached the King and embraced His feet, he wept and asked for forgiveness. Seized by unexpected joy, that good King immediately accepted him, wondering at his conversion and humility. […] Raising him up, the King “fell upon his neck and kissed him” [Lk 15:20] all over his eyes which had been weeping for many hours. […] …[H]e Himself clothed His former enemy and rival, and in no way reproached him for anything. And this is not the whole tale, but day and night He rejoices and is glad with him, embracing him and kissing his mouth with His own. So much does He love him exceedingly that He is not separated from him even in sleep, but lies together with him embracing him on His bed, and covers him all about with His own cloak, and places His face upon all his [bodily] members.” +++LORD JESUS YESHUA THE MESSIAH CHRIST, PRE-ETERNAL BISHOP, PRE-ETERNAL KING, PRE-ETERNAL PATRIARCH & SON OF GOD (SON OF BATHALA / SON OF ALLAH / SON OF ELOHIM / SON OF YAHWEH), THROUGH THE POWERFUL PRAYERS OF THE MOST HOLY THEOTOKOS & SAINTS SYMEON THE NEW THEOLOGIAN, MARIA SKOBTSOVA THE NEW MARTYR OF PARIS, MARY MAGDALENE, MOSES THE ETHIOPIAN, WALATTA PETROS, THOMAS THE APOSTLE, SERAPHIM MOSHNIN OF SAROV, ARCHANGEL MICHAEL, ARCHANGEL URIEL AND JOHN THE THEOLOGIAN, HAVE MERCY ON US SINNERS!\n\nIkos 1 from the Akathist to the Protection of the Theotokos (Pokrov)\n\nArchangels and Angels with John the Forerunner, John the Divine and the Choir of all the Saints, were present with Thee, their Queen, in the Church of the Blachernae and hearing Thy moving supplication for all the world, they cried out with wonder as follows: Rejoice, O Pre-Eternal Good Will of God the Father Who has no beginning of days.

John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus YESHUA answered him, “Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus YESHUA was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit RUACH HAKODESH of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”\n\nMark 1:9-11 In those days Jesus YESHUA came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

The next day he saw Jesus YESHUA coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.’ I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.” And John bore witness, “I saw the Spirit RUACH HAKODESH descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit RUACH HAKODESH descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit RUACH HAKODESH.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.” +LORD JESUS YESHUA THE MESSIAH CHRIST, PRE-ETERNAL BISHOP & TRUE GOD, HAVE MERCY ON US SINNERS! प्रभु यीशु मसीह, परमेश्वर के सन्तान, हम पर दया कर!கர்த்தாவே இயேசு கிறிஸ்து, எங்களுக்கு இரங்கும்!

(John 6:35-48) Jesus YESHUA said to them, “I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me; and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.” The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, “I am the bread which came down from heaven.” They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” Jesus answered them, “Do not murmur among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. +TWO 2. (John 8:12 & 9:5) Again Jesus YESHUA spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” +THREE 3. (John 10:7) So Jesus YESHUA again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.” +FOUR 4. (John 10:11-14) “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me…” +FIVE 5. (John 11:25) Jesus YESHUA said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live…” +SIX 6. (John 14:6) Jesus YESHUA said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me.” +SEVEN 7. (John 15:1-5) “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”++ LORD JESUS YESHUA THE MESSIAH CHRIST, SON OF ALLAH (SON OF GOD), THROUGH THE PRAYERS OF SAINTS MARIA SKOBTSOVA THE NEW MARTYR OF PARIS & MOSES THE ETHIOPIAN, HAVE MERCY ON US SINNERS!\n\nEthiopian-Eritrean-Tigrinya-Amharic-Geez Arrow Prayer:\n\nAbetu Geta Eyesus Kristos ye Egziabher lij yiqir belen! +++ጌታችንና መድሀኒታችን ኢየሱስ ክርስቶስ የቅድስት ቤተክርስቲያን የማዕዘን ራስ እና መሪዋ ነው ። አምላካችን ሆይ ለኛ ለሀጢያተኞቹ ቸርነት ምህረትህ ትደረግልን ለዘለአለሙ አሜን ።+++ +++gētachinina medihānītachini īyesusi kirisitosi yek’idisiti bētekirisitīyani yema‘izeni rasi ina merīwa newi ። āmilakachini hoyi lenya lehāt’īyatenyochu cherineti mihiretihi tideregilini lezele’ālemu āmēni ።+++Egzio Maharena Iyesus Krestos! “ኦ የሱስ፡ ይሖዋ ክርስቶስ: መምህር፡ ምሓረና!” “o yesusi፡ yiḥowa kirisitosi: memihiri፡ miḥarena!”“ኢየሱስ፣ ይሖዋ በናዝሬቱ መሲሑ ክርስቶስ: መምህር፣ ምሕረት አድርግልን!” “īyesusi፣ yiḥowa benazirētu mesīḥu kirisitosi: memihiri፣ miḥireti ādirigilini!” Egzee’o tesahalene!

And he came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, “I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants; and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you.” Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place; and I did not know it.” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.” So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel (House of God); but the name of the city was Luz at the first. +LORD JESUS YESHUA THE MESSIAH CHRIST, PRE-ETERNAL BISHOP, PRE-ETERNAL PATRIARCH & SON OF GOD, THROUGH THE PRAYERS OF SAINTS PATRIARCH TIKHON BELLAVIN OF MOSCOW, FATHER SERAPHIM MOSHNIN OF SAROV, MOTHER MARIA SKOBTSOVA THE NEW MARTYR OF PARIS, FATHER MOSES THE ETHIOPIAN, MOTHER WALATTA PETROS, ARCHBISHOP JOHN MAXIMOVITCH OF SHANGHAI AND SAN FRANCISCO & ARCHBISHOP GREGORY PALAMAS OF THESSALONIKI, HAVE MERCY ON US SINNERS!\n\nIkos 4 from the Akathist to Our Lady the Theotokos of Sitka: “Beset by hardships in this far northern land, we are lifted up by the faith our Father Saint Herman of Alaska instilled in us, and by the prayers of Our Lady of Sitka we take upon ourselves, with hope and fortitude, the Cross our Lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah Christ has given to each one of us and sing to her: Rejoice, Mother of the Most High God.
