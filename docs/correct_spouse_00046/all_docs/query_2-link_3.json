        "text": "Taiwanese singer and actor\n\nNicky Wu (born 31 October 1970) is a Taiwanese singer, actor and producer. He found fame in 1988 as a member of boyband Little Tigers. He later embarked on a solo career, known for his roles in TV series At the Threshold of an Era (1999), Treasure Raiders (2002) and Scarlet Heart (2011).\n\nIn 1988, Wu was discovered by an agency when he set up a roadside stall to support his family. Following an audition, he joined the boyband Little Tigers, where he was given the nickname \"Thunderbolt Tiger\" (霹靂虎), alongside Alec Su and Julian Chen. The group achieved success across Asia but was suspended in 1991 due to Chen's compulsory military service. Wu then pursued a solo career. Over the next five years, he released 13 Mandarin and Cantonese albums, and gained acclaim for his starring role in Tsui Hark's film The Lovers (1994). Chen was demobilized in late 1993 but the Little Tigers was effectively disbanded in 1995.\n\nWu enlisted for mandatory military service in February 1997 and returned to the entertainment industry in late 1998. He starred in the popular Hong Kong series At the Threshold of an Era (1999), before shifting his focus to mainland China, where he acted mainly in TV series, such as Treasure Venture (2000) and Treasure Raiders (2002). In February 2010, Wu and the other members of the Little Tigers reunited to perform at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. Since late 2011, Wu experienced a major resurgence in popularity for his starring role in the television series Scarlet Heart (2011).\n\nWu is the second child in his family, with an older brother Wu Qizhan and a younger brother Wu Qilin.\n\nWu married Chinese actress Ma Yashu in December 2006. They divorced in August, 2009.[1]\n\nIn 2015, after two years of dating, Wu married Cecillia Liu. They held their wedding in Bali on March 20, 2016.[2][3] On April 27, 2019, Liu gave birth to their son, nicknamed BuBu.[4][5][6]\n\nYear English Title Chinese Title Role Notes 1990 Wandering Heroes
