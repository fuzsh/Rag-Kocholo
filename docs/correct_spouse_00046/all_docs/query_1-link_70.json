That is called national pride? Majulah Singapura? KNN CCB!\n\nMerdeka! Merdeka! Merdeka!\n\nFuck PAP :oIo: Merdeka!\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/new...053/Gong-Li-divorces-Singaporean-husband.html\n\nGong Li 'divorces Singaporean husband'\n\nGong Li, China's most famous actress, has reportedly divorced her Singaporean husband, igniting the hopes of Chinese fans that she may return to the mainland.\n\nBy Malcolm Moore in Shanghai\n\nPublished: 12:31PM BST 30 Jun 2010\n\nGong Li 'divorces Singaporean husband'\n\nGong Li starring in The Curse of the Golden Flower\n\nGong, 44, caused widespread dismay in China in 2008 when she renounced her Chinese citizenship and officially became Singaporean.\n\nNeither country accepts dual nationality.\n\n\"I did it because of my family,\" she said recently in Shanghai. \"No matter what people say, I am Chinese,\" she added. Nevertheless she was branded a \"traitor\" for leaving China.\n\nThe actress married Ooi Hoe Seong, the Singaporean former chief executive in Asia of British American Tobacco, in 1996 but the couple have rarely been seen in public and it is not known whether they have any children.\n\nThe Southern Metropolis Entertainment Weekly, a Chinese newspaper, said it had confirmed with Gong's agent, Zeng Jingchao, that the couple have now divorced.\n\n\"Actually, the marriage has only been nominal for a long time,\" said Xie Xiao, the editor, before speculating that Gong may have become romantically attached to John Cusack, her co-star in a recent film. Gong admitted recently that she always \"stays in a hotel\" during the time she spends in Singapore.\n\n\"The big question is: Will Gong Li become Chinese Chinese again?\" said Shanghaiist.com, a local blog.\n\nGong shot to fame in a series of films directed by Zhang Yimou in the 1990s, including Red Sorghum and Raise the Red Lantern. She was heavily criticised, however, for ending Zhang's marriage with a subsequent affair.\n\n<hr>\n\nSo? SGP Chinese? PRC Chinese? Free-Fuck Citizenship betrayed!\n\nShe loyal to Singapore? Loyal to SGP husband? Dream On!\n\nGong Li divorced husband for John Cusack?!\n\nGong Li divorced husband for John Cusack?!\n\n<!-- google_ad_section_start -->\n\nPhoto from Exposay\n\nThe latest rumor is that Gong Li, who split with her Singaporean hubby, is now dating her co-star in her most recent movie, Shanghai. That's right, John Cusack has once again gotten the girl.\n\nFrom Shanghai Daily comes this juicy tidbit:\n\nGong and Cusack were spotted holding hands when leaving a Beijing hotel during the movie's premiere in China, Southern Metropolis Entertainment Weekly reported yesterday. Hotel porters were quoted as saying they returned together very late that night.\n\nMeanwhile, Gong's manager Christophe Tseng has admitted Gong divorced her husband Ooi Hoe Soeng, a tobacco company executive. Tseng refused to reveal more details and also declined to comment on the actress' relationship with Cusack.\n\nCusack once said Gong was beautiful and smart, just like Mona Lisa, and that it was very easy to fall in love with her.\n\nGong has praised her American counterpart as a wizard full of charms. \"I'm fond of him,\" she once said.\n\nâ€‹\n\nMona Lisa? Wizard full of charms? I've kind of got this image of John Cusack, standing outside Gong Li's hotel window, boom box raised over his head, pledging his love to one of China's most beautiful women. Only it's not as cute now because he's now no longer a svelte teen romcom star. *sigh*"
