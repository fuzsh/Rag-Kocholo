        "text": "In this Chinese name, the family name is Wu.\n\nNicholas Wu Qilong (born 31 October 1970) is a Taiwanese singer and actor. He found fame in 1988 when he became a member of the popular Taiwanese band Xiao Hu Dui (Little Tiger Team), performing alongside Alec Su and Julian Chen. The trio were extremely successful in Taiwan, selling over 15 million albums. During his time with Little Tigers Team, he pursued a solo career, releasing an extensive catalogue of songs, Mandarin and Cantonese albums as a solo artist when member Julian Chen left the group to serve compulsory military service. Wu released his debut solo album in 1992.\n\nAfter the break-up of the Little Tigers Team in 1995, Wu continued his solo career and embarked on a career in acting. Since then, his career has expanded into film and television in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1988, Wu was spotted by an entertainment agent, and after an audition he was chosen to be part of the 小虎隊 (Little Tigers Team) and given the nickname of \"Pilihu\" (霹靂虎; Thunderbolt Tiger). The group quickly became successful throughout Asia but disbanded due to one member's compulsory military service requirement. Wu continued solo, and began singing and acting in Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nIn five years, he released 13 Mandarin and Cantonese albums. As an actor, Wu won the 1993 Best New Artist award in Hong Kong, and the next year played the lead in the 1994 film The Lovers, his greatest commercial success with his actress Charlie Yeung. In February 1997, Wu went into the army to complete his military service. He returned to the entertainment industry in late 1998.\n\nJust around the new millennium, with the broadcast of television series such as At the Threshold of an Era, Treasure Venture and Treasure Raiders, Wu achieved fame in the television industry. Since then, he has been working consistently in both film and television.\n\nIn February 2010, Wu and the other members of Little Tigers Team reunited to perform during the Chinese New Year. In late 2011, Wu acted in the television series Scarlet Heart, which was a huge hit in China.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWu is the second child in his family, with an older brother Wu Qizhan and a younger brother Wu Qilin. He married Chinese actress Ma Yashu (馬雅舒) in December 2006. They filed for divorce in 2009.\n\nOn August 5, 2009, the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong media all reported that the two had signed and wanted to divorce, but there was no time to go to Yunnan to go through the formalities. The media reported that there were different opinions, but Ma Yashu was photographed by the Beijing paparazzi who was living with her foreign boyfriend. The relationship between the two should be true. .....\n\nIn 2011, Wu met mainland Chinese actress Liu Shishi when they co-starred in the hugely popular traversal drama Scarlet Heart. The chemistry they displayed led to rumors of a real-life romance.\n\nIn the early morning of November 13, 2013, Wu Qilong posted a close photo with Liu Shishi on his Weibo, stating that \"we cherish this hard-won relationship, officially confirming the relationship. A few minutes later, Liu Shishi also reposted this Weibo, confirming the news. On January 20, 2015, after two years of dating, Wu posted a marriage notice on Weibo. He and Liu Shishi formally registered their marriage in Beijing and obtained a marriage certificate.\n\nThe two held their wedding in Bali on March 20, 2016.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, Liu Shishi announced that she was pregnant. On April 27, 2019, Liu gave birth to a baby boy. Their son, whose nickname 'BuBu' is derived from the title of the drama that brought them together, Bu Bu Jing Xin.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear English Title Chinese Title Role Notes 1990 Wandering
