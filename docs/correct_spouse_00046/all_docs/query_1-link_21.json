        "text": "Taiwanese singer and actor Nicky Wu, 45, held his wedding reception with the gorgeous Chinese actress and ballerina Cecilia Liu (Liu Shishi), 29, on Sunday in Bali, more than a year after they registered their wedding.\n\nThe couple tied the knot at the picturesque Ayana Resort & Spa and were reportedly officiated by actor Damian Lau, who played the role of Wu’s father in a 2011 hit time-traveling drama—the same one where the couple first met each other, reports said. Too cool.\n\nThings were apparently quite emotional at the ceremony for Wu, who spent years paying his father’s debts and previously had a short marriage with actress Ma Yashu that only lasted three years."
