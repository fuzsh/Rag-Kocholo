        "text": "Sooo I'm finally getting back to recapping this drama. At the rate I'm going, it'll take me 20 years to finish. :D If I ever do finish all 40 episodes, it'll be a testament to how much I like this drama, I guess.\n\nI feel kind of bad that I'm not providing screencaps because I know people like to look at pretty things, but the quality on tudou is really not worth using as screencap material and my usual source of pictures (baidu) is lacking in HQ screencaps as well. Nevertheless, people have screencapped parts of it, so I'll try to put some pics in. I apologize beforehand for the low quality, though. I'll try to prettify them in Photoshop, but no guarantees.\n\nAnyway, back to the show. If you don't remember (and I don't blame you; it's been almost a year since I last posted a recap), Bijun is on the run from Team Rocket and luckily she runs into Shiyi Lang, who helps her escape. This scene's pretty funny because Shiyi Lang tells her to take her clothes off and she's of course quite against the idea. She gives him the outermost layer, insisting that's all she can do, and Shiyi Lang drapes it onto a stick and throws it into the water. He returns to Bijun, who screams in fright, and he's like, \"Aiya, you're wearing so much, what are you scared of?\" Hahaha. Then he gives her his jacket/trenchcoat thing to wear.\n\nOf course, Team Rocket falls for it (\"It looks like she's almost out of breath!\" \"Hurry up and get her out!\"), which amuses Bijun to no end. \"Those people are so stupid to have fallen for your trick,\" she says. \"How come you don't say I'm smart and able to trick them?\" he teases her. \"Mm\" she says, \"you're so smart.\" This is such a cute scene. They should have more of these. :C\n\nBJ: Do you know... I've never met anyone smarter and more capable than you.\n\nSYL: Oh? Then what about Lian Chengbi?\n\nBJ: ...I hear he's a big hero.\n\nSYL: You hear? You don't know yourself?\n\nThe topic turns to Lian Chengbi, and Bijun reveals that their marriage was arranged before they were born. They used to play together when they were kids but they haven't seen each other for several years. \"Actually, I feel like he's different from before. It seems like he's more solemn... and more powerful too.\" Getting right to the point, Shiyi Lang asks, \"Do you like him?\"\n\nBijun doesn't seem to be able to answer, so he changes the topic. Then she asks him what his name is. \"I'm called Xiao Shiyi Lang,\" he says. She can't believe it, since she's heard that Xiao Shiyi Lang is this awful baddie (or something like that), and he's like \"Oh, it must be because my name sounds good, so everyone wants to use it.\" \"Why don't you clear things up?\" she asks. \"Why should I? The people I know, know what I'm like. As for those I don't know, I don't care.\"\n\nThis is one of the major differences between our two main characters. Shiyi Lang is, for the most part, a happy-go-lucky kind of guy who couldn't care less what people think of him. Bijun, on the other hand, is very concerned with image and what people are saying about her. It's because of this that she can't get out of her marriage to Chengbi, even though she clearly doesn't love him. Then again, she does have her family honor to uphold.\n\nAnyhoo, Bijun returns home, refusing to allow Shiyi Lang to accompany her, although she apparently isn't smart enough to take off his extremely incriminating jacket. Oh well, she's probably suffering from pneumonia, so I'll forgive her. Everyone fawns over her (*snooore*), and she insists she has to talk about something with her grandma. Turns out that Bijun feels bad that the Shen family blamed Shiyi Lang for the theft of the Ge Lu Dao, especially since Shiyi Lang has rescued her so many times. Lao Taijun, however, thinks Bijun is just being naive: \"How come he suddenly appeared just when we sent out the Ge Lu Dao? How come you bump into him every time you're in danger? And how come every time he can rescue you so easily?\" Uh, obviously because he's such a superior martial artist. Jeez.\n\nBJ: Why do you have to see him in such an extreme way?\n\nLao Taijun is convinced that Shiyi Lang is still after the Ge Lu Dao. Bijun gets into a mini-argument with her grandmother and then faints because, well, she's Bijun. And also because her clothes are still damp. lol. Lao Taijun expresses the concern that her granddaughter may have (dun dun dun) fallen in love with Xiao Shiyi Lang.\n\nMeanwhile, Siniang is informing Shiyi Lang that he's being blamed for stealing the Ge Lu Dao. Shiyi Lang cannot believe it and says he needs to go clarify the situation. \"Hold on,\" says Siniang. \"Don't you not care what other people think of you?\" \"I don't care what anyone in the entire world thinks of me,\" says Shiyi Lang, \"except for her.\"\n\n(This is sort of off-topic, but I really want to hate on Ma Yashu because she probably cheated on Nicky, but she acts so well in this scene I just can't. That's the problem with me; I can't make much of a differentiation between fictional characters and the people who act them out.)\n\nSo blah blah blah, Bijun is sick, but Lao Taijun is not willing to push back the wedding date because of her illness. As they leave the room, Bai Yang somewhat-discreetly scatters some poison around Bijun, just in case Shiyi Lang should come to visit. Which he does.\n\nUpon seeing him, Bijun immediately apologizes for her grandma's actions, but Shiyi Lang doesn't care anymore now that he knows she doesn't think he did it. Bijun thinks back to their earlier conversation, saying, \"You're right. I've never thought of him, or missed him. I've never spent much time with him; how can I spend the rest of my life with him? That way... must be very difficult.\"\n\nShiyi Lang tells her not to get married, but Bijun is worried that people will laugh at her because they're already engaged. \"Other people can't help you live your life,\" says Shiyi Lang. \"This is your life. Why should you care what other people think?\"\n\nBJ: Why do I always feel like what you say has so much sense?\n\nSYL: Because I feel like what I myself say has a lot of sense. If it didn't, I wouldn't say it.\n\nNow that he's kinda sorta gotten a promise that she won't marry Chengbi, Shiyi Lang is happy to be on his way, except the poison has gotten to him and he's accosted outside by Bai Yang, Lü Liu, Lao Taijun, and the usual troupe of useless guards. They get into a nice big fight, which I'm a bit sad no one has screencaps of because there is such a pretty shot of Shiyi Lang after he avoids Bai Yang's attack. Anyway, Shiyi Lang returns the poison to Bai Yang during their fight, which impresses the two old guys, who think he could possibly be their \"successor.\"\n\nDuring a break in the fighting, Shiyi Lang reveals that he's already pulled the Ge Lu Dao out of its sheath and, what's more, that the sword is all rusty. It's really hilarious how he's so nonchalant during this scene while Lao Taijun looks like she's about to blow a gasket. When she rains insults on him, he winces and says, \"Wow, this bad? Taijun, tell me who it is so I can get rid of him.\" LOL. Oh, Shiyi Lang, I love you.\n\nSufficiently pissed off, Lao Taijun shoots her golden needles at him (this isn't as lame as I'm making it sound, trust me), but Bijun, who's somehow found her way to them, dives in front of Shiyi Lang and gets hit by most of them. The rest Shiyi Lang sends back at them. Then he runs off with Bijun, bringing her to Siniang's log cabin... but Siniang is nowhere to be found.\n\nBai Yang and Lü Liu swarm Lao Taijun with questions like \"Who is this guy? What sort of grievance does he have with the Shen family?\" but she doesn't answer. Instead, she furiously hollers up at the sky, \"From now on, he and the Shen family cannot coexist!\"\n\n-I'm ending the recap at 22:25 because I have to go sleep, but I'll get to part 2 soon, I hope. Plus it's kind of the halfway point, so it's a good place to stop. In the next part, we'll see what Siniang is up to."
