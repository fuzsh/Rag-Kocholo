The impoverished warrior offered what hospitality he could, although recently he had been cheated out of his lands. According to the noh and kabuki plays \"The Potted Trees\" / Hachi no ki, Tsuneyo even burned his precious miniature trees / bonsai to heat food for the visitor, who was actually the retired regent Hojo Tokiyori (1226-1263) disguised as a monk named Saimyoji on a surreptitious inspection of the country.",
