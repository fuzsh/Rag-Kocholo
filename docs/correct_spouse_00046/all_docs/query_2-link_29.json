        "text": "Since the photos were released, one image of Shishi appearing to float in a world of stars has gained huge attention from fans. It has been shared more than 10,000 times on Chinese social channels Weibo and WeChat.\n\nWu's love life and marriage have been the stuff of soap dramas. Wu was forced to remarry, then re-divorce his ex-wife Ma Yashu before he could tie the knot with Shishi.\n\nWu and Yashu were first married for three years, from 2006-2009.\n\nTo make matters even more complex, Yashu married Australian billionaire James Robert Hayes in 2010.\n\nAccording to an interview Mr Wu's mother did with media outlet, the Taiwan Apple Daily, the couple were forced to remarry and re-divorce due to an unusual set of legal requirements in the country.\n\nApparently Wu and Yashu never registered their marriage in Taiwan during the three years they were together, because Wu was \"interrogated like a criminal\" when making a visa application for his then wife.\n\nIt appears because of this oversight, Wu and Yashu were required to remarry, register their marriage in Taiwan, and then re-divorce so that Mr Wu and Ms Shishi's nuptials were legal in the country.\n\nWu and Shishi met on the set of the Chinese television series Scarlet Heart in 2011.\n\nIt is unclear if they became romantically involved at this time or later.\n\nWu announced on his Weibo page in January 2015 that the two had registered their marriage in Beijing, but the wedding ceremony was only held in Bali on Sunday.\n\nIn China, the legal element of a wedding must be completed in the offices of the Civil Affairs Bureau, so many couples choose to officially marry before proceeding to hold a ceremony and party the following weekend or later, according to the Travel China Guide.\n\nIt is possible the unusual circumstances that surrounded Mr Wu's previous marriage and subsequent divorce was the reason behind the 14-month delay between the marriage and the ceremony.\n\nThe wedding was held at the luxurious Ayana Resort and Spa in Bali, which sits on a cliff edge and has stunning views.\n\nApproximately 350 guests attended the wedding, which reportedly cost more than 20 million yuan, or AU$4 million.\n\nThe wedding was held outside with thousands of white, blue and pink flowers decorating the clifftop space. Ms Shishi cried during the ceremony as her new husband spoke of his love for her.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ms Shishi wore a white strapless gown with a full lace skirt and veil. For the reception, the new bride changed into a traditional red Chinese dress with delicate flower beading.\n\nThe couple had both a traditional Chinese ceremony and a more Western style ceremony.\n\nWaitomo Caves general manager Gordon Hewston said the Chinese couple's pre-wedding photoshoot was nothing out of the ordinary as the company received many requests from people wanting to be photographed inside the caves.\n\nHowever many were turned down.\n\n\"We are very careful around photography and look at all activity that is planned, both inside and outside the cave, and the potential risk to humans and glowworm and the wider eco-system,\" he said.\n\nHe said for each photoshoot request, a risk assessment was completed by the company's glowworm health expert scientist and an environmental specialist.\n\n\"We looked at what they wanted to do, their choice of lighting, the number of people in the cave, where they wanted to position themselves and type of equipment they're using.\"\n\nIf the risk of harming glowworms or the caves were too high, the requests were denied.\n\n\"There were no potential risk to glowworms and cave in this photoshoot.\n\n\"We've been monitoring the caves and glowworms for 25 years and this type of activity if managed properly, is fine,\" he said.\n\nHe said glowworms were unharmed in a low light environment and lights were always used inside the caves to \"highlight the formation so people can see the beauty\".\n\nLow light was also used for safety purposes for visibility.\n\nMr Hewston said after the release of the Chinese couple's photoshoot, the company received \"a lot of interest\" from China.\n\n\"So it's been very positive which is fantastic.\""
