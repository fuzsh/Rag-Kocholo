        "text": "Love is in the air because who isn’t dating or married?! Let’s play a round of connect the stars.\n\nNetizens still reeling from news of the Feng Shao Feng (born 1978) and Ni Ni (born 1988) breakup last year can rest assured since they each have found a significant other in the past month (bet they coordinated the release of the news).\n\nFeng Shao Feng is one of China’s eligible bachelors, a fuerdai 富二代 aka second-generation rich, good looking and successful in his own right while Ni Ni is supposedly pretty amazing herself. I say supposedly because I haven’t actually seen her in anything except for Wonderful Friends (a celebrity reality show taking place in a zoo). Nevertheless, the couple of 3 years seemed like a match made in heaven so their separation was much to fans dismay.\n\nNot to fret as Ni Ni (born 1988) subsequently announced her relationship with Jing Boran (born 1989) and both were coincidentally(?) bridesmaid and groomsmen in 2015’s wedding of the year wherein high-profile couple Huang Xiao Ming and Angelababy finally tied the knot.\n\nJing Boran was in Love Weaves Through a Millennium opposite Zheng Shuang (born 1991) who used to date Zhang Han. She has since moved on to better things, becoming a face to be reckoned with because she’s practically everywhere – dramas, movies, you name it.\n\nZhang Han (born 1984) didn’t sit idly either, dating co-star Gu Li Na Zha (born 1992) from their collaboration on The Classic of Mountain and Seas. Gu Li Na Zha is the Uighur girl that literally went from unknown to starring role in Rift of the Sky, which also starred Liu Shi Shi.\n\nNicky Wu and Liu Shi Shi officially wed last year, the photos came out this month and the ceremony is said to be held March 20 at Ayana Resort in beautiful Bali. Her ‘sister’ Annie Liu from Scarlet Heart will be the bridesmaid and the motif will take inspiration from the magnolia flower (wink wink). They definitely look adorkably blissful (more pics below).\n\nZhao Li Ying was almost always linked to Chen Xiao after the pair rose to fame because of Female Prime Minister Lu Zhen and their OTP so popular that it warranted a cameo for Zhao Li Ying as Yang Kang’s wife in Romance of the Condor Heroes ROCH.\n\nTheir onscreen chemistry might be sizzling yet in reality, I am quite happy for Chen Xiao (born 1987) and Michelle Chen (born 1983), both of which played the leads in ROCH. They have been dating since ROCH in 2015 and netizens are anticipating wedding bells by the end of the year, Jul 2016 to be exact.\n\nAre you still following? Yang Rong has a supporting role in too many dramas (ROCH, Lu Zhen included) and I’m glad that she is breaking out of the mold to play the lead. Expect to see her in Legend of Flying Daggers opposite Hawick Lau and the love line continues since Hawick Lau (born 1974) is basically Yang Mi‘s (born 1986) hubby.\n\nYang Mi is cast opposite Mark Chao (born 1984) in upcoming c-drama Three Lives Three Worlds and doh, of course he’s married too, to gorgeous Gao Yuan Yuan (born 1979) nonetheless."
