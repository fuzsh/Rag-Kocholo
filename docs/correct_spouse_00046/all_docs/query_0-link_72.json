        "text": "At around 2:00 today (13th November) Nicky Wu (Wu Qilong) posted this message on his weibo account:\n\n“Thank you for your concern and blessing, we cherish this hard-won feelings, we sincerely hope that we can have our private life, give us some free time and space, thank you for understanding.”\n\nA while later Liu Shi shi responded with this post “Thank you for your concern, I believe that God will give the best arrangement. “\n\nIt can’t be any clearer an admission than that! Just yesterday I posted about Shi shi and Hu Ge holding hands at the BQ event (see related post here) but after they walked the red carpet, Shi shi actually sat next to Nicky during the whole ceremony. As early as August this year, there have been many claims of “sightings” but the two never adressed those rumors. Earlier this month many media outlets reported that the two spent 8 hours together in one place thereby igniting more romance rumors. With their admission, fans responded with mixed reactions. But most were happy and congratulatory. It was said that weibo recorded more than 300,000 responses to the post within minutes. Many of the couples friends congratulated and sent happy messages to the two including Little Tigers bandmate Alec Su, co-stars Yuan Hong, Jiang Jin Fu, Ye Zu Xin, Guo Zhen Ni and even Nicky’s ex-wife Ma Yashu.\n\nNicky Wu and Liu Shi shi have worked together in the mega-popular Scarlet/Bu Bu Jing Xin步步惊心. Due to its massive success, which is also responsible for reigniting Si Ye’s (Nicky) career, a sequel Bu Bu Jing Qing 步步惊情 was made and is now about to be aired (thanks to the fandom’s incessant requests). They are also working on a third project together “Incisive Great Teacher 犀利仁师 ” According to many onlookers, the couple looked like well, a couple!\n\nBut some people are also doubting the veracity of the post because of its timing. They think that it’s an advertising ploy for the upcoming Bu Bu Jing Qing release. Oh please give me a break! I don’t think these two would resort to such cheap advertising gimmickry. So, let’s just all cry happy tears (like me!) and wish them happiness.\n\nCheck out the gallery below:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI’m not a coffee drinker but since it was a cool day I decided to get myself a big cup of cappuccino. 9 hours later, I still feel pretty much awake so I decided to write something to kill time. You already know that I’m a drama addict and my imaginings are filled with it. So here I am on my bed thinking about my favorite drama team ups. Who does that? Weird…I know! I wonder if you object with my choices or agree with them…\n\nSo without further ado here they are in random order.\n\n1.Chen Qiao En and Mingdao (Prince Turns Into a Frog 2005)\n\nMy MingEn couple! He was the suave hotel CEO Shan Jun Hao while she was the money worshiping lower class girl Ye Tian Yu. Their first encounter was unpleasant but an accident caused SJH to have amnesia and not knowing who he is, he ended up staying with TY’s family. The arrogant guy eventually turned into a hardworking and kind man whom TY fell in love with. It was their first team up and the drama went on to become the highest rated idol drama in Taiwan’s history.They just click like that! They collaborated in many projects since then including Ying Yi 3+1, Let’s Dance, Beauties of the Emperor. Theirs is a beautiful professional partnership. The amazing chemistry they have on screen however, never translated into real life.\n\n2.Ariel Lin and Joseph Cheng (It Started With A Kiss 2005)\n\nWho could ever forget that kiss in the rain? Or the stolen kiss Jiang Zhi Shu gave a sleeping Yuan Xiang Qin? Or that agonizing and embarrassing moment when she mustered enough courage to give him “the” love letter. Their personalities can’t be anymore diffirent yet they were perfect for each other. The drama became so popular that They Kissed Again (get it?).They worked together in another drama Love or Bread(2008) and proved that the tandem is solid.They haven’t collaborated since then and I desperately want to see them together in a drama once again.\n\n3.Yoon Eun Hye and Joo Ji Hoon (Goong 2006)\n\nThe mythical Crown Prince of imperial South Korea Lee Shin fell in love with an ordinary high school girl,Shin Chae Kyung, whom he was betrothed to. He was cool, famous and smart. She was messy,unrefined and stupid. But her cuteness and good heart won him over.Their’s was a cute dog-cat sort of relationship that eventually turned into love. It was the first foray into acting of then newbie Baby VOX member Yoon Eun Hye and first team-up with Joo Ji Hoon. Many fans protested about their casting but were proven wrong by their irresistible tandem.\n\n4.Tang Yan and Wallace Huo (Chinese Paladin 3 2009)\n\nUntil now I still can’t get over their parting in Chinese Paladin 3 and… that song! The mere thought makes my heart heavy. I guess I just have a thing for undying love. Theirs was a doomed relationship from the very beginning which took them 3 lifetimes to finally accept. Even the gods were against them! She was a descendant of the goddess Nuwa (Zi Xuan) while he is a monk who is destined for immortality (Xu Chang Qing/Gu Liu Fang/Lin Ye Ping) but she was “the” distraction that’s keeping him from attaining it. Doomed and all, I was still rooting for them till the very end. They are indeed a Perfect Couple (2014).\n\n5.Ady An and Vanness Wu (Autumn’s Concerto 2010)\n\nIt was the biggest drama that year and for good reason. Despite the cliche and predictability of it’s story, Ady and Vanness‘ chemistry was so good it was crazy! This is a good example of mediocre story but incredible OTP. I think it was that which carried the entire show through it’s ratings glory. Seeing the two of them together plus their adorable kid Xiao Xiao Bin on screen gave me a warm feeling. They felt like an authentic family.\n\n6.Inoue Mao and Jun Matsumoto (Hana Yori Dango 2005)\n\nHe’s the quintessential rich, handsome, popular, spoiled kid with a temper to boot! She’s the hardworking, good-hearted, strong and plain looking outsider. Two wonderful characters from a classic manga series. They are the Japanese version Tsukasa Domyoji and Makino Tsukushi who’s love story was like Cinderella and Prince Charming who beat the odds together despite their wide status gap. He sacrificed so much just to be with her and she fought just to have him back. Matsu Jun and Inoue Mao have amassed solid shippers who support them till this very day.\n\n7.Baifern Pimchanok and Mario Maurer (Crazy Little Thing Called Love 2010)\n\nNot a from a drama but a movie. I just had to include this. It totally caught me off guard. I wasn’t ready to fall in love with it but I did! How could I not? When I could pretty much relate to the story of an unpopular high-school nobody (P’Nam) who carries a torch for the handsome “it” guy on campus (P’Shon) all the way from 7th grade to 9th grade. And talk about chemistry! Theirs was off the charts! Watching it was like a trip down memory lane with a bonus. Mario Maurer is one heck of a looker!\n\n8.Lee Yo Won and Kim Nam Gil (Queen Seon Deok 2009)\n\nBet you didn’t expect this choice! Didn’t you? Nobody thought that Bi Dam will steal the thunder from General Yoo Shin with his insubordinate ways along with Queen Seon Deok‘s heart. It was a love line that (almost) came out of nowhere but so damn effective I was on board when it started sailing. I mean, that final scene when Bi Dam died calling Seon Deok by name and she was trying so hard not to run to him. I cried a river and cursed the writers for killing him off like that. But I know it has to be that way.\n\n9.Liu Shi shi and Nicky Wu (Bu Bu King Xin 2011)\n\nChemistry.These two knocked it out of the ball park! I bet nobody expected that Nicky Wu who played 4th prince Yin Zhen and Liu Shi shi as Martai Ruo Xi would have this magic between them thus making the series into a phenomenon and propelling their individual careers up. They even got best couple award left and right not just in the mainland but other parts of the world. If that is not reason enough for their super hot chemistry, I don’t know that is. But such sad fate. But maybe there’ll be a happily-ever-after in its (supposed) sequel Bu Bu Jing Qing."
