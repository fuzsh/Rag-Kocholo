        "text": "Registering their marriage last year, Nicky Wu (吳奇隆) and Cecilia Liu (劉詩詩) finally held their wedding banquet in Bali on March 20. Despite the touching vows and the 20 million RMB fairy tale wedding, Nicky and Cecilia’s marriage came with many obstacles, including legal complications involving Nicky’s ex-wife Ma Yashu (馬雅舒).\n\nAs it turns out, Nicky and Yashu had not officially registered for marriage in Taiwan. In 2007, the pair was interrogated with scrutiny by the government unit. Angered that they were treated almost like criminals, Nicky decided not to register their marriage in Taiwan.\n\nBecause of this, Nicky had to wed Yashu and then file for a divorce before he could legally register his marriage with Cecilia in Taiwan.\n\nTwo Sides to a Divorce\n\nBefore his career peaked with 2011’s Bu Bu Jing Xin <步步惊心>, Nicky had struggled with his career while still having to repay his father’s 16 million RMB debt. It took 12 years before Nicky was able to pay back the debts completely.\n\nDue to his earlier financial struggles, Nicky did not give overly expensive gifts to Yashu. Nicky’s mother spoke diplomatically kindly of Yashu, “There wasn’t a wedding banquet held at the time. We really didn’t treat her properly.”\n\nHowever, Nicky’s mother disclosed that Nicky gifted Yashu an apartment and number of assets when they separated.\n\nShocked at the news, Yashu exclaimed no such thing occurred. Yashu said, “I originally didn’t want to speak on this matter. But on the topic of the apartment, Nicky and I bought it together in Beijing. We both paid for it and when we separated. I gave his share back to him. Right now, I still live in that apartment in Beijing.”\n\nAlthough no further statements were made, Nicky’s mother said the family is no longer in touch with Yashu – especially not after Nicky’s marriage with Cecilia.\n\nSource: Sohu.com"
