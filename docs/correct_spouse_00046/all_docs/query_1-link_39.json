        "text": "In this handout picture, Taiwanese singer and actor Nicky Wu, left, kisses his Chinese actress wife Cecilia Liu Shishi during their wedding ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, 20 March 2016. Taiwanese singer and actor Nicky Wu and Chinese actress Liu Shishi got hitched in Bali on Sunday (20 March 2016), in a lavishly traditional ceremony fitting for the two stars of a popular time-travel drama. 45-year-old Wu rose to fame as a member of the Taiwanese boy band Little Tigers before switching over to acting, mainly in the mainland. That's how he met 29-year-old Liu Shishi, his co-star in the 2011 hit drama \"Scarlet Heart.\" Wu had to go through quite a bit of trouble to marry his sweetheart. Due to some technical issues, he was forced to legally marry his former wife Chinese actress Ma Yashu, and then divorce her once again, the Straits Times reports, citing Taiwan Apple Daily."
