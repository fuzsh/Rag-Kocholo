(Photo by China Photos/Getty Images)\n\nTalking to reporters a day after Nicky Wu and Cecilia Liu's extravagant wedding on Sunday in Bali, Wu's mother talked a little about his past marriage and explained why her son's ex-wife, Ma Yashu, was not able to get a wedding.\n\nWu found fame as part of the band \"Little Tigers.\" And while he successfully transitioned into acting from 1989 until 2001, all his hard work went to paying off his father's debts, which amounted to NT$80 million, according to Asian Pop News.\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\nThough Wu and Ma married in December of 2006, just like other married couples, they still had their fair share of challenges. \"His career was not doing well at that time. Although he had filming projects, they were not popular,\" Wu's mother revealed. \"He was not able to give her a wedding and give her those things,\" she continued.\n\nShe added that Wu did give Ma a house after they decided to end their marriage in 2009, however, Ma, responding to Nicky's mother's claim, explained that they bought the house and paid for it both when they were still together. When they divorced, she returned Nicky's money and even disclosed that she is currently living in that house.\n\nFurthermore, Ma was somewhat caught in a bind when she revealed on a TV show in Taiwan that Wu gifted her a whopping 5.31 carat engagement ring but said on a different show in Mainland that she was the one who actually paid for the ring. She also added that their bridal shoot was simply shot at the side of the road.\n\nThe former couple failed to register for marriage in Taiwan after Wu was intensely interrogated when he attempted to get an entry permit for his then-wife. This resulted in problems for Wu and Liu when they tried to register their marriage in Taiwan.\n\nAs for her reaction to her son's vows to Liu, she said that she was deeply moved and emotional when Wu talked about his love for her. Wu and Liu first met on \"Scarlet Heart,\" the Chinese TV series which relaunched his career."
