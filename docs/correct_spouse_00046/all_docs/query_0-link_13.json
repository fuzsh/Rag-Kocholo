        "text": "The ceremony at Ayana Resort and Spa on Sunday was officiated by actor Damian Lau, who played Wu's father, the Kangxi emperor, in the 2011 Chinese television hit, said Apple Daily.\n\nIt began at about 5pm, as the best men, Wu's fellow former Little Tigers singers Alec Su and Julian Chen, and actor Yuan Hong (who played the 13th prince in Scarlet Heart), and the bridesmaids, actresses including Annie Liu (who played Liu Shishi's sister, Ruolan, in the show), filed in.\n\nEnter the groom in a Dolce & Gabbana suit and the bride, on her father's arm, in a strapless Carven wedding dress. Guests including the Tigers' mentor, entertainer Chang Hsiao-yen, and actor Wallace Huo, clapped and cheered.\n\nWu, 45, got down on one knee and put a 5.52-carat diamond wedding ring on Liu, 29.\n\n\"Since I was small, I've been through lot of unfair things and I've complained to God more than once,\" he said, pausing as he began choking.\n\nWu, who spent years paying off his father's debts, married actress Ma Yashu in 2006, but it lasted only three years.\n\nAs the guests applauded, he took a breath and continued: \"I blamed God for not being good to me, for being unfair to me, for putting me through a lot of strange suffering, for putting me through a lot of unhappy things. Now I understand why. Because God saved the best for me.\"\n\nCuddling Liu, he added: \"I will listen to you.\"\n\nShe chimed in: \"I will give you my shoulder to rest on forever.\"\n\nScarlet Heart - starring Wu as the fourth prince and the future Yongzheng emperor and Liu as Ruoxi, his time-travelling lover - proved to be a bonanza for him professionally and personally.\n\nHe has said he had feelings for Liu but did not act on them immediately as he thought they could be an effect of filming a romance. So he waited till the sequel, Scarlet Heart 2, which was filmed in 2013, to confirm his feelings and to date her. They obtained their marriage certificates in Beijing last year.\n\nOn Sunday, the banquet began with fireworks and climaxed with a rare performance by the three Tigers, who broke up in the 1990s, said NetEase website.\n\nThe trio sang their classic hit Love. Tears flowed on and off stage when their mentor Chang spoke, said NetEase.\n\nShe was quoted as saying by Apple Daily: \"Seeing them today, I can rest assured. Julian is still the darkest, Alec is still the cheekiest, and Nicky still cries the most.\"\n\nShe said she had not got together with her boys in 17 years and thanked Liu for marrying Wu and making the reunion possible.\n\nTV host Matilda Tao, who also gave a speech, asked Liu why she agreed to marry Wu. Liu answered: \"He's filial, mature, good to me.\"\n\nThe couple were pouring wine onstage when they were quizzed about their baby plans. The bride, who had changed into a red halter-neck Alexander McQueen gown, said they would have at least two.\n\nThe groom said: \"We'll have one tonight!\""
