        "text": "Career\n\nIn 1988, Wu was spotted by an entertainment agent, and after an audition he was chosen to be part of the 小虎隊 (Little Tigers Team) and given the nickname of \"Pilihu\" (霹靂虎; Thunderbolt Tiger). The group quickly became successful throughout Asia but disbanded due to one member's compulsory military service requirement. Wu continued solo, and began singing and acting in Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nIn five years, he released 13 Mandarin and Cantonese albums. As an actor, Wu won the 1993 Best New Artist award in Hong Kong, and the next year played the lead in the 1994 film The Lovers, his greatest commercial success. In February 1997, Wu went into the army to complete his military service. He returned to the entertainment industry in late 1998.\n\nJust around the new millennium, with the broadcast of television series such as At the Threshold of an Era, Treasure Venture and Treasure Raiders, Wu achieved fame in the television industry. Since then, he has been working consistently in both film and television.\n\nSince 2002, he focused his career in mainland China and moved to Beijing. With his background as a professional athlete, he is best known for playing fighting scenes and never uses stuntmen as he trusts his own ability. At times, he has also played complete different roles, proving himself to be a very skillful actor. During this period, Wu participated in more than 20 television series and more than 10 films as the lead actor.\n\nIn February 2010, Wu and the other members of Little Tigers Team reunited to perform during the Chinese New Year. In late 2011, Wu acted in the television series Scarlet Heart, and is set to return to film its sequel Scarlet Heart 2 in 2013 in a different role.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWu is the second child in his family. He married Chinese actress Ma Yashu (馬雅舒) in December 2006. They filed for divorce in 2009.\n\nIn January 2015, Wu married his Scarlet Heart co-star, Cecilia Liu."
