        "text": "After Nicky Wu’s (吳奇隆) surprising announcement that he is dating Cecilia Liu (劉詩詩) was issued yesterday, an abundance of congratulatory wishes from Bu Bu Jing Xin <步步驚心> co-stars and fans flooded the Sina Weibo social network. As excited chatter grew over the beloved onscreen couple turning into real-life lovers, many also became curious about Nicky’s romantic past.\n\nVivian Hsu\n\nNicky was involved with a handful of beautiful ladies in the past, including Vivian Hsu (徐若瑄) in his early career. In past interviews, Nicky and Vivian admitted that they had mutual feelings towards each other, but their romance was not realized because of various setbacks. Nicky’s father’s business had collapsed at the time, saddling the family to pay back the massive debts. This left Nicky with no choice but to work non-stop and drop any relationship intentions. Nicky admitted that he regretted that he did not have a chance to pursue Vivian further.\n\nOther rumors circulated that Nicky’s mother disapproved of Vivian due to her controversial past and sexy image.\n\nAda Choi\n\nSince Nicky was a workaholic even at a young age, it is not surprising that most of the women he fell in love with were his co-stars. In 1999, Nicky fell for Ada Choi (蔡少芬) after filming movie My Heart Will Go On <還我情心>. They both starred TVB drama At the Threshold of an Era <創世紀> together, although they did not portray an onscreen couple.\n\nWhen Ada tearfully announced that she wished to draw boundaries with her mother, who was a gambling addict, Nicky supported her publicly. Their high-profile romance however came to and end due to incompatible personalities and frequent long-distance separations.\n\nMa Yashu\n\nTowards the turn of the millennium, Nicky focused his career in mainland China and moved to Beijing. In 2001, Nicky fell in love with Treasure Raiders <蕭十一郎> co-star, Ma Yashu (馬雅舒). They lived together and got married in 2006. But due to their work schedules and little time together, they divorced in 2009. Nicky reportedly paid Yashu 1 million RMB and six multi-million luxury homes as part of their separation package. It is understood that he continues to pay Yashu monthly alimony.\n\nTwo years after the divorce, Ma Yashu married Australian executive, James Robert Hayes. In October 2013, Yashu was spotted heavily pregnant at the airport.\n\nCecilia Liu\n\nNicky reportedly escaped from the hurt he experienced in his divorce by channeling all his focus on work. He slept only four to five hours each night, and only became busier since establishing his own production studio.\n\nFilming Bu Bu Jing Xin <步步驚心>, Bu Bu Jing Qing <步步驚情> and Incisive Great Teacher <犀利仁師> together, Cecilia Liu and Nicky’s onscreen chemistry generated real-life sparks as well. Cecilia was the actress that Nicky spent the most time working with over the last two years. This summer, Cecilia and Nicky’s relationship grew increasingly closer when they worked on Incisive Great Teacher as they were seen on set playfully teasing each other during filming breaks.\n\nAfter reports emerged that Nicky had spent eight hours at Cecilia’s home in Shanghai, he finally admitted that they were dating on November 13, 2013. Nicky allegedly splurged 2 million RMB on a new car for Cecilia; the couple was spotted car shopping together and Nicky even asked Cecilia what color she preferred.\n\nSources: Sina.com; Sina.com"
