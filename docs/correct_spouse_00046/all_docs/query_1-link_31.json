        "text": "Did Nicky Wu and Liu Shi Shi register for marriage?\n\nTaiwanese actor-singer Nicky Wu is said to have registered for marriage with girlfriend, Chinese actress Liu Shi Shi yesterday after a fan spotted him at the Taiwan Judicial Registry office.\n\nThe fan wrote on Facebook: “It’s amazing, I met Si Ye [Nicky’s role in Scarlet Heart] at the registry office. He has a small face, sharp nose and looks better than [how he is] on television. He even has a small ponytail.”\n\nA woman, believed to be his mother, was left waiting at the office after Nicky signed the documents and Shi Shi was not in sight. The actress is said to have accompanied Nicky on this trip to Taiwan as they were spotted touring Jiu Fen together.\n\nAlthough the fan’s description matches the 34-year-old’s latest hairstyle and his manager, Ren Yue, later confirmed he is indeed in Taiwan, she clarified that he was there to settle issues on infringement of portrait rights. Ren Yue said she was “really not sure” when asked if Nicky and Shi Shi had registered for marriage.\n\nThe lovebirds went from a reel couple in popular Chinese drama series Scarlet Heart to a real couple last November. Marriage rumours have been spreading since, especially when Nicky brought Shi Shi to his hometown in Taiwan this Lunar New Year, which is suspected to be a meet-the-parents session.\n\nAlthough they denied those speculations, both of them have reportedly been cohabitating, going on vacations together and Nicky had even presented her with an engagement ring.\n\nSource\n\nclass=\"headline\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; font-size: 26px; line-height: 1.21em; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"Joseph Chang denies rumours with Cecilia Liu\n\n11 Nov – Taiwanese actor Joseph Chang has recently dismissed rumours saying that he has become the third party in Cecilia Liu and Nicky Wu's relationship.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Cecilia has been secretly seeing Joseph behind Nicky's back while working together on Isao Yukisada's \"Five Minutes to Tomorrow\".\n\nReportedly, the two had some private outings while working in Japan together. A photograph has also spread online, showing the two of them together, with Joseph putting his arm around Cecilia's shoulder.\n\nHowever, according to UDN News, Joseph's manager has recently dismissed such rumours, saying that there is no way for the two of them to develop a relationship, as both of them have little to no interaction outside of work.\n\nMeanwhile, Nicky has also issued a statement via Weibo, saying that the reports are merely gossips, and that his relationship with Cecilia remains strong.\n\nSource\n\nSource: MingPao / The SunTranslated by: Chloe.CNicky Wu and Cecilia Liu announce their marriage on Weibo\"4th Prince\" and \"Ruo Yi\" have suddenly announced their surprise marriage! Nicky Wu, who divorced Yashu Ma in 2009, went public with his relationship with Mainland female star, Cecilia Liu in 2013. The two have often shown off their happiness in public, and their had been many marriage rumours flying around in the past year. Until yesterday afternoon, Nicky Wu suddenly announced that he and his girlfriend have tied the knot; even his manager did not know beforehand! Entering 2015, the entertainment industry has been full of good news! Another \"god\" has tied the knot, and this time it is 44 year old Nicky Wu and 27 year old Mainland female star, Cecilia Liu. The two met because of filming the hit Mainland drama \"Scarlet Heart\". Although they are 17 years apart, the two look very compatible and have been described as \"golden boy and jade girl\" match. After dating for 3 years, they finally have their happy ending.Yesterday, Nicky Wu posted a picture of two marriage records and a pair of marriage rings on Weibo, and wrote \"Treasure happiness\", and tagged Cecilia. Afterwards, Cecilia replied \"We are very blissful.\" Till now, over 1 million fans have forwarded the post and given them their blessings. Nicky Wu and Cecilia Liu announced their marriage news on Weibo, having registered for marriage at the Beijing Xicheng Marriage Registry yesterday afternoon. Manager denied Cecilia Liu is pregnantBecause of their sudden marriage announcement, many people started suspecting whether Cecilia is pregnant or not. However, both their managers denied this, saying Cecilia is currently filming director Lau Kong's new movie \"The Battle at the Dawn\". In the movie, she plays a female spy who has quite a few action scenes, so their management companies expressed that it is impossible that she is pregnant. Nicky's manager, Paco Wong, who is in Beijing, responded through telephone: \"I really didn't know! I just had dinner with Nicky last night, but he didn't say anything. (Cecilia was there?) No, because we were discussing work. I only knew until I saw his Weibo this morning. I immediately congratulated him. (Mad that he didn't tell you?) Why would I! It's happy news! Actually, he did say he would get married this year, but didn't say when. (What will you gift him?) I've gifted him a lot already! Gave him a whole company! We have been working well together.\" Paco Wong also expressed that he did not believe that Cecilia is pregnant, because the newlywed couple is very, very busy: \"Nicky Wu will start filming \"蜀山戰紀之劍俠傳奇\" soon. I also invested in this drama (with him), it is quite a big investment.\"Will hold wedding ceremony at the end of the year in both China and TaiwanAccording to sources, Nicky Wu had secretly started planning their marriage since last September, and returned to Taiwan in October to handle his single status certificate. After two months, after receiving the related documents, the two went to register for marriage in Beijing yesterday. On the 25th, he will begin filming for his self-invested new drama \"蜀山戰紀之劍俠傳奇\" at Hengdian, while Cecilia Liu will also be busy filming her movie. Therefore, they will most likely only be able to hold their wedding banquet at the end of the year. They will hold a banquet in both Mainland China and Taiwan. Because the two are incredibly busy, they most likely also did not take wedding photos yet.Many friends sent congratulationsAlec Su, who was a member of \"The Little Tigers\" with Nicky Wu, congratulated the two on Weibo and hurried Nicky to quickly become a father. Damien Lau, who played the king in \"Scarlet Heart\" also joked: \"Why didn't you guys have Father (皇阿瑪) witness your marriage! Congratulations!! Incredibly happy!\" Another cast members from \"Scarlet Heart\" also congratulated the couple, including Lin Geng Xin, Kevin Cheng, Annie Liu, etc.\"Scarlet Heart\" gave them fate and won popularityFive years ago, Nicky Wu and Cecilia Liu cooperated in time-travel ancient drama \"Scarlet Heart\", which started their fate. Cecilia Liu played Ruo Yi, who was torn between \"4th Prince\" Nicky Wu and \"8th Prince\" Kevin Cheng, which led the three to the peaks of their acting career. Afterwards, the rumours of Nicky Wu and Cecilia Liu secretly dating surfaced. It wasn't until November 13th, 2013 did Nicky Wu admit on Weibo that he and Cecilia were dating. After the \"Long-Shi\" relationship was publicized, the two were often seen in public events, showing their happiness.
