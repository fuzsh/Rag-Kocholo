        "text": "I met Shrey at the Residence Hall for Baruch College. Always very cheery and light; he never once stopped smiling. He spoke with a harsh Indian accent so I knew he was not from around here. I went up and I don’t think I ever got as big, and warm of a greeting from any one as his. It peaked my interest to know who he was and where did he come from. I decided to interview Shrey and I found out he is an international student from India. It was his fist time schooling here in the U.S.. To get to know more about Shrey we must first get to know his motherland.\n\nhttps://www.culturalindia.net/indian-history/index.html\n\nIndia’s history and culture is dynamic going back to the beginning of human civilization. It begins with a mix of cultures along the Indus River in the southern lands of India. The history of India consists of many people constantly moving in and bringing their diverse cultures with it. By the end of 400 BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed civilization.\n\nThe Vedic era in India is when many of its cultural principles and traditions started forming. The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of India. It is named after the Vedas, the early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization succeeded along the river Saraswati. Vedic is intertwined with Hinduism, and helped form the culture we have today. India is predominantly Hindu and therefore most of its traditions and culture come from its main religion. Family values are highly respected throughout India and is core to its culture. It is a patriarchal society, so a woman must obey her father, her husband, her son. Arranged marriages are also very common. India has one of the world’s oldest caste systems. The caste structure divides people into four main groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras Brahmins are the teachers and priests, Kshatriyas are the warriors and rulers Vaishyas are the merchants, and finally, we have the Shudras, the workers/servants. Marrying between castes is forbidden and looked down on. In India it is believed that your caste is set by birth. There are many interesting customs that vary region to region, but it’s those things that make the people who they are.\n\nShrey’s Mother was born and raised in the west side of India, Gujurat. His father was about 2-3 hours East of his mom in a place called Amreli. These areas are more business and trade oriented. His parents met each other through a family function/party. Shrey’s parents met through friends of friends and began talking. Something just clicked between them and they started to like each other. Back at home in Amreli, Shrey’s father decides to propose to his mother and bam! They got married. This was a love marriage which is actually rare in India. Most of India believes in arrange marriage, that you may be able to grow to love someone. Studies show arrange marriages have a higher success rate. To many Indians the role of husband and wife is more important than the love between them. Shrey is in support of Arrange marriages and believes it is best. He thinks that it is less history a person carries with other relationships and that way each partner can focus on each other.\n\nShrey was born August 13, 2000. He was raised in India, and never really traveled outside his country. When he was in ninth grade, his cousin was having a farewell party because she was to attend college here in the U.S. His cousin chose the U.S over all the other countries because she believed in the American dream. This is where Shrey got motivated to want to be able to come to the U.S. Shrey wanted to be part of the American dream as well. The first thing he does is join a program NASA has. They take children from India and bring them to the U.S. to experience some of the things they are developing. Hoping to inspire the new generation. After coming here, Shrey’s heart was set in coming to U.S. to study.\n\nThe fact that there are Indians that have made it to the U.S is a huge accomplishment. In India it is extremely difficult to move up in social status, therefore it is very hard to obtain the funds, network, and know how to be able to come here. The only castes that have been able to make it here on their own are the top three (Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas). Sometimes the Brahmans and Kshatriyas will sponsor some of the Sudra caste into coming here as their servants. The Vaishyas are able to obtain the funds (through business or sponsors) to be able to come to the U.S in search of a new life. The fact is here in the U.S no matter what caste one is originally from, because they have passed the enormous obstacle of settling here, they are much respected. This drastically thins the barrier between castes, but doesn’t remove it completely.\n\nhttp://www.iccrindia.net/2018/10/02/understanding-indias-caste-system/\n\nThe caste system is so deeply ingrained in the culture of India that even moving to the U.S. doesn’t make it go away. It is part of the mindset of the people who come here that pretty much create a false caste system. I will say however, the U.S is one of those very few places where the castes can interact so closely together. There are several Indian communities here that try to be very inclusive. Unfortunately it is very difficult for an Indian of a lower caste to get rid of their stigma of where they are from. The stigma of ones caste influences their network and creates a false caste system.\n\nEither way, the level of friendship me (a Kshatriya) and Shrey (a Vaishya) have will not have been possible back in the motherland. In India we might have looked at each other much different than we do here. What happens in India should stay in India.\n\nAccording to Shrey, his transition into the U.S was fairly easy. He absolutely loved it. Coincidentally his first day here in the U.S, orientation day, was his birthday. He mentions how the first thing he thought was interesting is that how most things are in reverse here. He mentions how the light switches here are opposite compared to India; also the way you open doors and the way people drive are opposite. The steering is on the left and people drive on the left side of the road. When coming here Shrey noticed many cultural differences. The biggest one was the structure of relationships. In India all friends are family. Here it seems to be that people are much more selfish and selective with who they are kind to. Shrey misses the close relationships he had hack home and the experiences he had with them. He enjoyed going out to a lake near his house everyday with his family and friends. Shrey also mentions how back home there would be a festival 2-3 times a month. This would be a place where the whole town comes together and celebrates. Here in the U.S you don’t see enormous festivals like that. Shrey does not like one place more than the other, he just wanted to experience a change in atmosphere.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Z3U30M5Ys\n\nInterviewing Shrey was a blast. I was able to see the sincerity and honesty he has. Shrey is also very interesting. I would have never guessed he loved to cook and plays soccer. He is also strategic about setting goals in his life and how he goes about accomplishing them. Shrey is very aware of his surroundings and the impact he has. I can certainly say Shrey has gave me a huge amount of insight to who he is and the country he comes from.\n\nMe (in pink) and Shrey (in red) heading out for a night full of adventures."
