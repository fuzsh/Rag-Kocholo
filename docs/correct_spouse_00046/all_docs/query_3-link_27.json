The poor man and his wife treated the surprise visitor with as much honor as they could, even burning Tsuneyo's prized bonsai trees to cook a meal for him. The monk was actually the retired regent Hojo Tokiyori, who was disguised during an intelligence gathering mission. When Tokiyori later issued a call for daimyo to assemble at Kamakura, Tsuneyo reported with his rusty armor and broken down horse, and was recognized by Tokiyori. As a reward for his generous treatment, Tokiyori returned Tsuneyo's lands and gave him three estates, one for each of his trees that he burned. The inset above shows Tsuneyo's poor starving horse in his stable. A beautifully detailed illustration of this story.",
