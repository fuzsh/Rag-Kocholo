[Photo: sina.com]\n\nTaiwan singer-actor Nicky Wu confirmed he has parted with his actress wife Ma Yashu.\n\nThe starlet issued an announcement via the web portal sina.com on Thursday, saying \"Ma Yashu and I formally divorced on August 11, 2009. From now on I will not respond to the matter any more. Thanks for your concern.\"\n\nThe couple met each other in 2001 and married in 2006.\n\nWu, 39, rose to fame in the late 1980s as a member of the boy band, Little Tigers Team, performing alongside Alec Su and Julian Chen.\n\nMa Yashu, 32, was previously little known and gained media exposure for her relationship with Wu."
