        "text": "The lavish wedding of Nicky Wu (吳奇隆) and Cecilia Liu (劉詩詩) took place yesterday in Bali, Indonesia. Although Nicky’s first marriage with Mainland Chinese actress Ma Yashu (馬雅舒) ended after only three years in 2009, he cherishes his current marriage with Cecilia. Nicky decided to prove his love towards Cecilia through his actions, by making Cecilia the majority shareholder of his production company.\n\nPaid Father’s Debts for 12 Years\n\nIn the industry for two decades, Nicky’s acting resume is accomplished, starring in a long list of films and television dramas that have been successful in the Greater China Region. While he was popular, Nicky used a large portion of his income to repay his father’s financial debts, which took 12 years to finally clear.\n\nShouldering the family’s finances since he was a youth, Nicky always believed in saving and investing for the future. In 2007, Nicky had already owned seven Thai restaurants in China and Taiwan. He also owns a pet shop in Taiwan, a real estate company in Japan, as well as his own production company.\n\nThe success of 2011’s Bu Bu Jing Xin <步步驚心> allowed Nicky’s career to peak in China, helping him earn over 100 million RMB last year and cement his status as one of China’s richest celebrities. On the other hand, Cecilia’s filming and endorsement fees helped her earn 35 million RMB last year.\n\nAlthough it was reported earlier that Cecilia was extremely frugal while planning her wedding, the details of her wedding dress proved earlier gossip to be false. Cecilia’s wedding dress was designed by the lavish French brand, Carven, and is worth 3 million RMB. Similarly, Cecilia’s traditional Chinese dress cost 300,000 RMB, as the designer required one year to hand-sew. The couple also spared no expenses on the ring, as Cecilia’s diamond ring, which costs 12 million RMB is designed by De Beers.\n\nNicky did not mind spending millions on the wedding to give Cecilia lifetime memories. Prior to the couple’s wedding banquet, Nicky transferred 60 percent of his company’s shares, which is estimated to be valued at 1.8 billion RMB, to Cecilia’s ownership. This made Cecilia the majority shareholder in Nicky’s company. While some fans fretted over Nicky’s move, others applauded his generosity towards his wife.\n\nSources: On.cc; QQ.com;"
