Â Â Â Â Wu wrote, âCherish the happinessâ with the pictures, and Liu immediately reposted it, saying âwe are in happiness.â

Â Â Â Â Fans of the couple left messages under the posts encouraging them to have a baby soon.

Â Â Â Â After they opened up about their relationship two years ago, Wu, 44, and Liu, 27, have often been spotted together in public.

Â Â Â Â Several months before, the lovebirds were spotted at the airport in Shanghai as they were preparing to fly to Japan to celebrate the lunar Valentineâs Day.

Â Â Â Â The couple has worked together on the very popular Chinese TV drama series âBubujingxinâ (âScarlet Heartâ) since 2011.

Â Â Â Â In 2002, Wu focused his career on the Chinese mainland and moved to Beijing. With his background as a professional athlete, he is best known for performing his own stunts.

Â Â Â Â Liu won the Magnolia Award for most popular actress for her role in âScarlet Heart.â
