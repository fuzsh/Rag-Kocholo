Starts at 6 PM\n\nRAYMOND PETTIBON adds to the exhibition:\n\nWE GOT P0WER!: WE SURVIVED THE PIT\n\nTrack 16 Gallery is pleased to present the exhibition and installation, WE GOT P0WER!: We Survived the Pit, celebrating the release of the book \"WE GOT P0WER! Hardcore Punk Scenes From 1980s Southern California\" By David Markey & Jordan Schwartz [Bazillion Points Books, 2012]. The exhibition runs from September 8 to October 6, 2012 HELD OVER BY POPULAR DEMAND FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS (ENDS 10/20) with an opening reception on Saturday, September 8 from 6 to 11 PM. The opening will feature live music by Adolescents, Saccharine Trust, The Last, White Flag, & Dead Issue.

Gallery hours are Thursday through Saturday from noon to 6 PM.\n\nAs a pre-teenager, David Markey began making 8mm and Super-8 films while publishing\n\nneighborhood newspapers in Santa Monica in the mid 1970s. In 1979 he met fellow teenager Jordan Schwartz and by 1981 they founded We Got Power!, a fanzine dedicated to the first-generation hardcore punk music community in Los Angeles, and beyond.\n\nArmed with a typewriter, exacto-blades, Letraset rub-on lettering, and rubber cement\n\nthey fashioned collaged spreads of their collected images and they reported on the burgeoning underground scene. Their text and cameras captured local bands; Black Flag, the Minutemen, Circle Jerks, Social Distortion, Red Cross/Redd Kross, Suicidal Tendencies, Descendents, White Flag, the Last, the Gun Club, Saccharine Trust, Sin 34, Circle One, Firehose, and many others at the height of their creativity. In the process, the duo's photographs also captured the dilapidated storefronts, and dereliction of the early 1980s Reagan era Southern California landscape. We Got Power! also looked beyond its singular 213 area code, giving attention to emerging national acts such as Minor Threat, The Necros, Husker Du, The Misfits, M.D.C., Big Boys, D.R.I., the Butthole Surfers, & Flipper.\n\nThe exhibition focuses on the impact of hardcore punk on Markey, Schwartz\n\nand friends, and the way this music would influence and effect their lives and artistic output. Celebrated in a richly dense installation the exhibition will include their unique photographs, 'zines [Neighborhood Journal, We Got Power], films [\"The Slog Movie\", \"Desperate Teenage Lovedolls\", \"Lovedolls Superstar\" & more], videos, skateboards, ephemera, and original art by Raymond Pettibon, Cameron Jamie as well as others.\n\nFor more information and updates, please visit our website\n\nFor press images, please contact Jordan Schwartz at the number above.\n\nBios\n\nDavid Markey was born December 3, 1963, in Burbank, CA.
