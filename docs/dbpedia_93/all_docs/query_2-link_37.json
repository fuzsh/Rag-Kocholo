        "text": "The Woman in Black\n\nMomentum Pict./CBS Films (2012) 95 min. PG-13\n\nDirector: James Watkins\n\nScreenplay: Jane Goldman; based on The Woman in Black by Susan Hill\n\nCinematography: Tim Maurice-Jones; Editing: Jon Harris\n\nProduction Design: Kave Quinn; Set Decoration: Niamh Coulter\n\nCostumes: Keith Madden\n\nScore: Marco Beltrami\n\nStars: Daniel Radcliffe (Arthur Kipps), Ciarán Hinds (Sam Daily), Janet McTeer (Mrs. Daily), Liz White (Jennet), Sophie Stuckey (Stella Kipps), Misha Handley (Joseph Kipps), Jessica Raine (Nanny)\n\nStandard issue spook fare that never amounts to much is still promisingly atmospheric in spots, distinguished by its unusual, turn of the century period setting. Many horror movies are set in old, dark houses, few on the other hand are set in the old, dark superstitious past itself, which is odd since, for all our Amityville Horrors, I imagine most people still tend to psychologically associate ghosts and haunted houses with the Victorian past. The primary distinction of The Woman in Black lies in its being placed in that transitory time-frame when the horse and buggy era was making way for the mechanized age of the automobile. In fact a relatively newfangled contraption called a car is brought into direct play in the most imaginative and unsettling sequence in the picture when Daniel Radcliffe’s Arthur Kipps, a solicitor who has been sent to settle the estate of Alice Drablow in an isolated area of northern England, attempts to retrieve the body of the Drablow boy, Nathanial, who drowned in the marshes surrounding the family manor. Passing through the superstitious village to find doors and shutters barred at his approach, Kipps is rather like Renfield on his way to castle Dracula, just the latest blood sacrifice to revivify the ancient evil lurking there.\n\nThe most imaginative aspect of the movie is in placing the nearly inaccessible Eel Marsh House in the middle of this desolate wasteland of treacherous tidal mud flats that stretch off to the horizon like some eerily still Sargasso Sea. It’s similar to Scandinavian horror films in which the elements and terrain themselves become another character in the drama, conspiring to entrap our hapless hero in the house of horror. If one veers from the narrow road, or becomes disoriented in the fog, they’re likely to be lost in the mucky marshes that swallow horse, buggy and body as swiftly and thoroughly as quicksand. This is why it’s so unsettling when Kipps goes diving for the boy’s body; not only is there zero visibility beneath the peaty surface, but we’re more squeamish than he is about what might be swimming around in all that mud. When he locates the sunken buggy with the body inside and the men try dredging it up by hooking a rope around the bumper and placing the car engine in reverse, it’s heart-stopping to hear it stall under the weight, then slowly see it being tugged toward the edge of the marshland itself as the treasure again begins sinking beneath the shifting sands. We’re watching a harrowing scene out of folklore, an archetypal contest between four cylinder horse power and the horse carriage intent on sinking back into the primeval ooze of time immemorial. Cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones’ camera, placed at a distance, captures the surreal sight with understated eloquence, the isolated action illuminated solely by the lamplights of the car piercing the inky blackness all around, the darkness that threatens to swallow them up as surely as the marshes.\n\nEven after baring it all in Equus on the London stage and anchoring How to Succeed in Business on Broadway, it’s hard to believe Daniel Radcliffe is all grown up now, and old enough to play a father (if to a very young son), no less. I was never a devoted follower of the Harry Potter franchise, but it was impossible to ignore its pop cultural impact. The Woman in Black offers Radcliffe his first adult role in a big budget, mainstream Hollywood movie since the series ended. Minus the owl specs and outfitted in Edwardian cutaways he’s virtually unrecognizable. He doesn’t disgrace himself, but this isn’t the sort of part to confer distinction upon his career either, and that’s through no fault of his own. An unusually tony supporting cast, headed by Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer, fair no better.\n\nThe retrieval of the boy’s body from the marsh isn’t embarked upon to settle his unquiet spirit mind you, but because his wrathful mother, the wraithlike creature of the title, is not only restless but out for blood. Every time her specter is spotted it entails death as surely as the shriek of the banshee, for one of the village children in retribution. The movie was adapted from Susan Hill’s novel of the same name by Janet Goldman, and though the movie was directed by a man, James Watkins, this vision of an overly possessive mother whose reach extends beyond the grave is by and large a female conceived concept, which makes it all the more fascinating. The woman in black intends to make other parents suffer as she was forced to, after enduring the loss of her own child, but it doesn’t make sense that she should prey on innocent children who had nothing to do with her misery, or why her vengeance is applied across the board in such an indiscriminate manner. As a wounded mother, one would think that she should instead have a vested interest in protecting other innocents from harm, instead of acquiring them like prized additions to the growing collection she’s been building to replace the one son she lost, keeping all these lost souls in a permanent state of suspended purgatory by preventing them from crossing over into the light. This is a nightmarish vision of suffocating motherhood; she murders young offspring to ensure they never leave the nest, can never be taken from her, as her real boy once was. In essence, she’s the manifestation of that black raven that swoops down on Kipps, giving him such a start when he’s caught messing around with her hatchlings, trying to help one that’s fallen back into the nest.\n\nThe movie’s basic premise, in which kids are psychically induced to commit suicide in increasingly gruesome fashion, certainly puts a damper on one’s enjoyment of the picture and heralds something of a depressing new trend on screens, released so close as it was to The Hunger Games, in which kids are ordered by the state to off each other for the entertainment of the masses. The average age of actors that it’s deemed acceptable now for movies to sadistically depict being immolated, drowned, maimed and brutalized, all in the name of a cheap thrill, has been reduced by half. Even prepubescents have become fair game now, their lives snuffed out before they’ve really begun.\n\nThe movie seems steeped in as black a shroud of depression as its mournful lead. There’s the implication of a link between Kipps and The Woman in Black, both being incapable of coming to terms with the untimely death of a loved one, unable to lay them to rest in order to move on with their life. She lost her child, and he lost his wife in childbirth. Perhaps this is why she performs her act of ‘mercy’ in that ill conceived ending, which allows the little family to be reunited in the afterlife rather than adding Kipps’ child to her growing collection of abandoned otherworld orphans. Strangely, this finale somehow manages to cross reference memories of both The Curse of the Demon and Ghost, with perhaps a sprinkling of The Sixth Sense thrown in for flavoring. It’s the sort of ending that has all its bases covered, but it also leaves us hanging since nothing has changed, the murders haven’t stopped and will continue on and on, leaving audiences bereft of any sense of closure. The Woman in Black ends both victorious and forever damned to her state of perpetual mourning, cursed by her inability to move on the way Kipps has.\n\nSince the story is laid out for us a few scenes in, and any new revelations that might have been forthcoming thereafter are replaced instead by a standard collection of cheap shocks, the plot fails to thicken into a quagmire to match the one that surrounds the haunted estate. No illuminating revelations prove forthcoming to afford us additional insight, or any deeper meanings beyond the obvious and apparent ones that leap out at us from the dark. Goldman’s screenplay remains skimming the surface, afraid of delving beneath the obvious, and possibly drowning in the quicksands. Movies like these don’t seem to understand that what’s really frightening is the unknown and intangible. When you explain everything away like The Woman in Black does so early on, you’re robbing the movie of all its unsettling psychological mystery. It’s clear the director is on unsteady ground when Kipps espies the indistinct figure of a women watching him from an upstairs window of the abandoned house, then moves his camera inside, from the ghost’s own vantage looking down on Kipps, forcing the audience to see things from her eyes rather than his in effect, as if we were meant to identify with the wraith rather than the hero. The camera placement completely robs the film of the suspense it should hold concerning what is to be encountered when Kipps actually reaches the room to investigate. Unlike him, we’ve just been up there, so the thrill is completely gone.\n\nWhen directors can’t douse the screen with gallons of blood, they invariably fall back on the same tired old dark house tricks that were considered clichés by the end of the silent era, when they were being satirized in movies like The Cat and the Canary. Moviemakers need to find new ways to scare audiences in order to recharge chillers like this. The horror film is the one cinema genre in most desperate need of revitalization, but unlike Westerns or Musicals, it never seems to go out of style long enough to allow for retooling or for new concepts to emerge. The Woman in Black is set a hundred years ago and to contemporary eyes, its stock effects belong to the Victorian era. The movie’s a moth eaten bag of rattling old bones, distinguished only by the new air of modern menace in which not even children are safe from the mother of all bogey men.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\nLionsgate (2012) 142 minutes PG-13\n\nDirector: Gary Ross\n\nScreenplay: Suzanne Collins, Billy Ray and Gary Ross; based on The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins\n\nCinematography: Tom Stern; Editing: Christopher S. Capp, Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling\n\nProduction Design: Philip Messina; Set Decoration: Larry Dias\n\nCostumes: Judianna Makovsky; Score: James Newton Howard\n\nStars: Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark), Liam Hemsworth (Gale Hawthorne), Alexander Ludwig (Cato), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy), Amandla Stenberg (Rue), Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane), Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman), Donald Sutherland (Snow)\n\nBased as it is on the first novel in a popular trilogy of teen fiction, and given the legion of devoted fans the movie inherited before it was ever released, it’s probably unnecessary to point out at this late stage that The Hunger Games is about a futuristic, state sponsored reality TV show which pits twenty four adolescents against each other in a no-holds barred fight to the finish. Author Suzanne Collins, who also collaborated on the movie’s screenplay with director Gary Ross and Billy Ray, was inspired by the explosion in popularity of elimination round reality programs like Survivor, Celebrity Apprentice, The Amazing Race and even American Idol, where the public at large is invited to vote on their favorites, weighing in on who gets axed each week. The contestants of her Hunger Games are even assigned mentors like on The Voice and when Woody Harrelson turns up as one, Haymitch Abernathy, doing his same patented People vs. Larry Flynt standup comedy routine, the slow seep of steadily building dread seems to instantly dissipate. A litany of other free form influences allow Collins to draw a direct line of descent from our contemporary televised reality competitions to other, similarly unsavory games held throughout human history. Taken as a whole, they comprise the amalgam that gave rise to the cutthroat tournament of the title.\n\nThe basic premise of The Hunger Games is a reworking of the Greek myth of Theseus, in which twelve boys and girls were offered as tribute to the king of Crete every few years and sent into the Minotaur’s maze in retribution for a suppressed rebellion against the capital. Here, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve outlying ‘districts’ are selected for sacrifice during a lotto like drawing called the ‘Reaping.’ The legendary and unparalleled litany of blood sports that constituted the three ring Roman arena are also alluded to, as the contestants in these Hunger Games are paraded before the public in wheeled chariots intended to evoke images of triumphal processions. Moreover, the theme of the film, concerning the degenerative moral decay of a society that turns such state sponsored exhibitions into entertainment for the desensitized, sheep like masses is, by and large, the same as that of Ridley Scott’s Roman-set Gladiator, which similarly attacked violence as a spectator sport. The way these kids are feted and fawned over before the big event, you’d never think they were being led to the slaughter. They’re not unlike Aztec sacrifices who were treated like kings for a year before having their still beating hearts ripped from their chests.\n\nThe Reaping itself evokes intimations of virgin sacrifice in that it is children who are selected to be sent into the arena to die. The Hunger Games trades on the sort of irrational, fairy tale horrors that haunt the minds of adolescence the same way a movie like Dragonslayer does, with its similar ‘lottery’ designed to randomly select a sacrificial victim. It’s no wonder young Prim wakes from her sleep screaming. In their way, the Hunger Games can be seen as a suicidal variation on the Olympics, only here it’s District tributes, rather than representatives from various nations, who are drawn into the competition. Both contests however are committed to championing the concept of physical superiority. This is most apparent in that promo played over the lottery and adorned by strong, virile athletes photographed sensually against the discus of the setting sun. It seems to have been pieced together using stray images from Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympiad.\n\nThe Riefenstahl imagery is apt since it associates The Hunger Games with Nazism and other more contemporary fascist dictatorships. When the kids queue in their drab Sunday best for the Reaping, for instance, they spark images of communist indoctrination and re-education camps. There’s also intimations of the Holocaust in The Hunger Games’ depiction of a society methodically selecting members of its own citizenry for random slaughter. When Prim’s number comes up, just as in her nightmares, and the shrieking girl is carted off, we’re reminded of the shattering scene in the concentration camp at the end of Sophie’s Choice.\n\nThe Hunger Games is set in the future rather than the mythical, medieval or even modern past, in a totalitarian state that seems similar to those suggested by writers like Orwell in 1984 and Aldous Huxley in Brave New World, a depressing, dystopian vision of a fascistic future in which Big Brother has become an extension of invasive reality TV itself. There’s something askew about director Gary Ross’ point of view however. The audience is too often allowed to forget that the Hunger Games’ cameras are always there, watching and encroaching upon the characters’ privacy with their all-access, 24/7 coverage, even during their most intimate moments. Whereas the hidden camera’s omnipresence should be consistently emphasized, the contestants appear to be alone and altogether unobserved for extended periods of time rather than under constant surveillance. Perhaps Ross should have had cinematographer Tom Stern adopt a more realistic, docudrama approach, turning events into a mockumentary akin to Fear Factor and the other reality shows it takes off on. That would at least make viewers feel as though they were there themselves, hungry, hunted, rather than just another member of the complacent TV audience, a bystander baying for blood. This is one rare instance where the overused stylistics of The Blair Witch Project and its brood of descendants might have proven effective.\n\nNo clear mention is made of how America got to its sorry present state, so we don’t know if the world we’re seeing is meant to be the result of some post-apocalyptic fall out, as are so many other future-set films. The citizens of Panem, the state capital, dress so wildly in their dayglow hair and chalky Kabuki mask makeups, mixed with fuchsia colored outfits, that they impart the impression of genetic mutations, even if there’s nothing physically amiss with them. It’s as if Katy Perry and Lady Gaga had collaborated as technical advisors to Judianna Makovsky’s fashion department. Inhabiting this corrupt and decadent city, the ghoulish, garish ruling classes are swathed in a seizure inducing swirl of swinging 60’s psychedelia and florescent 80’s punk. It’s a world redecorated by Andy Warhol.\n\nAs in Brazil and Blade Runner, the look of the future is a rummage bin of retro styles and fashions from many diverse eras fused into one. The most strikingly pronounced are the contoured, art deco lines of the 30’s and minimal, space age steel and aluminum. The architecture of Philip Messina, who dreamt up the production design, and Larry D ias who did the set decoration seems a blur of the Nuremburg rallies of the Third Reich, communist China and Soviet Russia under Stalin, a compendium in effect of several separate authoritarian regimes to create a composite picture, the all-encompassing look of totalitarianism. Panem, which betrays the Greco-Roman influence of early Americana only more excessively so (we seem to be approaching a hermetically sealed coastal city laid out along the shores of the Mediterranean), is an explosion of vibrant, candy colored pop art; this is the future as foreseen by The Factory. It’s meant to emphasize the overindulgent decadence of city life as opposed to the austere, rural Appalachian hills our heroine Katniss Everdeen and her kin hail from. The only people who don’t resemble freaks are the dowdy plain Janes seized from the styx.\n\nThe strange zoning laws which have sectioned America into twelve separate ‘Districts’ (originally there were thirteen, like the original thirteen colonies), seem intended to divvy the country up into its major resource producing centers. District 12, from which sacrificial tributes Katniss and Peeta are pulled, is the coal producing region comprising what was formerly Appalachia, but we get no sense of what the districts from which the other contestants come are supposed to be in the market for. And, rather than the future, the scenes of Katniss’ home life seem set in the undefined past, her District 12 the mirror image of some mining camp from the Depression era. Oddly, train travel still seems the fastest means of mobility, as if airplanes and cars hadn’t yet been invented, though we see at least one government controlled hovercraft scouring the area for insurgents.\n\nThe folks from Districts 12 are the underdogs in life and in the games, the ruling class using them for slave labor or entertainment, as if the country’s political constructs had slipped back into feudal times. They’re glorified sharecroppers and ‘The Reaping,’ with its suitably agricultural associations, is the penalty the various districts must pay, one intended to pluck the cream of their crop. The state is, in effect, cutting down their most vital and important natural resource, their children (their future), before their time. Stripped of their goods and exports as well as their sprouts, the capital rapes and exploits these outlying regions as if they were conquered colonies. In an indirect way, imposing such harsh reparations to punish the districts for the historical rebellion recalls the government’s treatment of the south following the Civil War, which was motivated by a similar desire to punish the rebels, to make them pay for having defied the sovereignty of the United States in attempting to succeed from the Union.\n\nAs its title would suggest, The Hunger Games never lets us forget that these characters are starving and malnourished, that these ‘games’ are in essence a variation on the larger dog eat dog struggle for survival they’re forced to compete in back in the real world. Food plays a prominent part in proceedings, whether the burned loaf of bread Peeta once threw the famished Katniss in flashback, the way the contestants are wined and dined in the days leading up to the big show like calves being fattened for the slaughter, Katniss’ idle threat to eat the cat that hisses at her, her warning to Peeta during training to demonstrate his upper body strength because the other contestants are looking at him like he’s lunch, the poisoned berries Katniss prevents Peeta from popping into his mouth, the apples and oranges that detonate the landmines surrounding the stored provisions, the lifesaving soup sent by their sponsor, Katniss trying to bring down a deer then shooting a pheasant, the squirrels Peeta mentions her selling his family. The prospect of wealth and permanent financial security for survivors, through personal appearances and celebrity endorsements, is a tempting enticement to risk life and limb in the games since the poverty and starvation they’d face back home seem just as certain a death sentence.\n\nIt’s always fascinating watching actors playing characters who are themselves forced to act in some capacity as Katniss and Peeta must do here. But the bomb Peeta drops on national TV by declaring his undying love for Katniss might have meant more if we’d been privy to the fact that the two were already acquainted back home, before they were ever shuttled to the big city. Instead, the flashback concerning the tie that binds them (hunger) is parceled out in bits and flashes, so it takes awhile before the big picture, that Katniss feels she must save Peeta in the Hunger Games because he once saved her from starvation, can be pieced together. It’s never made quite clear, however, as to what extent their professed love is simply a play for the camera and to what degree it comes genuinely from the heart. The impression at movie’s end is that their affection for one another is that of brother and sister, that Katniss remains loyal to Gale who’s faithfully awaiting the return of his warrior princess, filling the function traditionally reserved for females left behind on the home front.\n\nFor his part, Peeta is a baker’s boy and as a preparer of food also fills a capacity traditionally reserved for women. He seems so weak and sensitive, with his overbearing mother, and ‘artistic’ with his preoccupation with makeup design, it remains a highly dubious prospect that he would be attracted to any girl in the way he professes to be attracted to Katniss. It’s small wonder then that she immediately clobbers him backstage rather than falling for his public line. They make an ideal match (they’re even wounded during combat in the exact same spot on their leg), but for all the reasons that would make a romantic relationship impossible. Katniss and Peeta are each others’ perfect beards. He makes the arrow wielding Amazon seem softer (she calls it weak) and more desirably feminine, and she saves his physically inferior ass every time he’s about to be annihilated. It’s a win win situation for everyone.\n\nThe intriguing question, as to why Peeta should be attracted, as he professes, to a woman so much stronger than he is himself, is one the movie never gets around to exploring. Suffice it to say, he’s made to feel inferior to Katniss in every way. No one gives him a snowball’s chance in hell of emerging from the games alive for instance, not even his own people (“You know what my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I realized she didn’t mean me.”), and he manages to survive only by using what would traditionally be regarded as feminine wiles, manipulating the TV audience by appealing to heart interest and playing up to the stronger contestants for protection and provisions. Though in the preliminaries much to-do was made of Peeta’s upper body strength this is never brought into logical play during the games themselves, as his skill with camouflage is. And we fully expect it to be there at the end, where he should use it to ultimately prove his virility by tossing that big blonde bully to the dogs.\n\nJosh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta, first blipped on the radar as the conflicted son of lesbians Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in The Kids are Alright and last year appeared in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island opposite the diminishingly masculine Dwayne Johnson, so his appearance here as such a weak stripling seems like perfect typecasting. His hair has even been dyed a fey shade of platinum to emphasize the effect. This doughy baker’s boy named after the bread is meant to have gone totally soft by living a more comfortable life than the other families in his region. He’s hasn’t stayed hungry, like Katniss and her kin, and so has had no call to develop the same hunting and survival skills, the killer instinct she’s been forced to. He’s surrounded by food, the source of it, and being so well fed, not nearly hungry enough to go for the jugular. Consequently he’s far less equipped than Katniss to take care of himself and survive the endurance test of the Hunger Games. The only chance he has lies in deploying his artistic skills, painting himself in chameleon colors to blend in with the rocks, trees and foliage. He’s a burgeoning makeup artist with skills worthy of some major Hollywood production, and while we’re on the subject this movie deserves an award of some kind itself for such crazy and quite clever cosmetics.\n\nJennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen grew up hungry. Having always lived the hunter’s life, been forced in effect to take her father’s place as provider for the family following his death in the coal mines, she’s used to looking after herself. Just as she was in Winter’s Bone, Lawrence’s Katniss is virtually the sole support here for younger siblings and infirm older parents who may as well be children. The character’s rustic, country upbringing again aids her immeasurably when thrown back on her own resources. She’s been living off the land for so many years already she has an instantaneous leg up on the competition, possessing survival skills and a self sufficiency foreign to city folk. Gale calls her Catnip, and she’ll later be treed by Cato as if she were a cat chased into the branches by a barking bulldog. Like the scene near the beginning that links her with that ill tempered tabby, Katniss’ very name indicates her predatory nature. She’s a born hunter, like a feline; it’s innate in her character.\n\nThe opening scenes depict her trying to bring down a deer, which is as illegal as it was for Robin Hood in the king’s forest, and the association immediately tags her as a similar subversive while placing her in the same iconographic ranks as other great archers of history and legend. Katniss possesses the same skill with an arrow as Robin Hood did, as well as the length of bone of an athletic Amazonian. With her braids and bow, she’s Diana the Huntress, sure shot Annie Oakley and William Tell all rolled into one. When she shoots that apple out of the luau pig’s mouth to leave a lasting impression during her demonstration before the committee, it’s a defiant act tantamount in the telling to Tell’s shooting that apple off his son’s head.\n\nIt’s only with a bow and arrow in hand that Katniss feels fully functional, and it’s a pity she doesn’t make a beeline for it at the beginning, grabbing it from the provisions stacked in front of home base. Nor do we ever see to what use she puts the other trinkets, like the slinky-style, coiled wire contained in the duffel bag she does grab. A girl as resourceful as this should be showing finding a practical use for them all. When her team tries to put Katniss in a rational frame of mind by reasoning “You’ve hunted before.” her outraged response is “Not humans.” In The Most Dangerous Game, to which The Hunger Games owes a nod of acknowledgement, there was revealed to be nothing like the thrill of stalking prey as intelligent as man. Here, there’s an intriguing suggestion of Katniss’ growing horror at becoming just such a stone cold killer, all red of tooth and claw, discovering a latent aptitude for it. But the story gingerly sidesteps this issue. It never forces Katniss to confront her own innate animal instincts and drives, the thrilling bloodlust rising in her veins. The way events are skillfully maneuvered she’s never forced to question what exactly she’d do, how far she’d be willing to go in the interest of self preservation, in order to stay alive.\n\nCapitalism encourages citizens to compete with one another in a more civilized application of social Darwinism, and as Katniss is well aware, the game is rigged from the outset by the perverse puppet master, just as the equally tortuous dance marathon was rigged in They Shoot Horses Don’t They?. When she comes close to the peripheral boundary designated for these games, the masterminds pulling the strings from the holographic control room hurl a forest fire at her to add to the drama. When the contestants are whittled down to a standoff, they release the hellhounds. But because the permissive society of Panem is never fully delineated, the games fail to become a metaphorical microcosm of the larger world around them, as did the exhaustive, draining dance of life in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? Like that story too, the contestants here find it advantageous to secure themselves sponsors to back them during this grueling, physically arduous endurance test.\n\nLanding the most coveted role of the year for actresses of her age range in this avidly anticipated enterprise makes Lawrence something of this season’s Rooney Mara. It’s such a well rounded role it would be a gift to any young artist but I can’t imagine anyone else better suited to the part than she is. Her Oscar nominated Winter’s Bone performance now seems, in retrospect, like a dry run, a picture length screen test for this much more high profile part. Her reputation precedes her. The part of Katniss lets Lawrence do it all, oscillate from Hollywood ingénue to hard bitten frontier woman to devoted helpmeet to nurturing mother figure to subversive rabble rouser. She may be trying to impress her various audiences on screen, the hunger games committee, Peeta, her sponsors, TV viewers, but it’s the one in the movie seats that she really succeeds in bowling over. She scores a bullseye in this one, at times bringing to mind an American Cate Blanchette, at others a strapping, fleshier young Laura Dern. Her Katniss may not seem like star material at first, at least not until she receives the proverbial Hollywood makeover before her appearance on the red carpet in that Roman chariot. The brilliant Max Factor of Lenny Kravitz’s Cinna brings out the hidden beauty buried beneath this bedimmed diamond in the rough. On the rare occasions when Katniss lets her hair down out of that tightly wound braid over the shoulder, she’s revealed to have a smoky eyed, ravishingly Nordic blonde beauty about her. She’s transformed into a glamazon for the TV cameras and the movie’s.\n\nLawrence, a polished actress, is playing a girl who is herself charmingly guileless before the public, in the way Leelee Sobieski (who she resembles, together with a touch of Evan Rachel Wood) used to be. Awkward and self conscious on the chat show rounds, she suffers from terrible stage fright before going on. She may have been roped into the competitive Hunger Games by default, but Katniss doesn’t have the first clue how to play the game, the media circus surrounding them, as smoothly as Peeta does. He takes to celebrity whoring and courting the press like a duck to water, much more readily than Katniss, throwing all those genetic studies indicating girls to be more socially adept than guys out the door. Like the prickly young Jane Fonda in They Shoot Horses Don’t They?, Katniss initially feels it beneath her to pander to the public, to prostitute her charms in such a cheap manner, wanting to instead succeed on her own terms. It’s fascinating then to watch her finding her legs and learning the ropes, marketing herself as ‘the girl on fire,’ with all the sexual connotations that designation entails. She discovers how to manipulate viewers to her own end by making love to the camera before the eyes of millions, and all the while doing it in a sly, understated manner that allows audiences in the theater to see the real thoughts and emotions behind the charade audiences watching on TV are totally taken in by.\n\nOnly movie goers are permitted to ascertain to what extent Katniss may be acting and to what degree she’s meant to be taken seriously when she appropriates Peeta’s star crossed lover pretense in order to manipulate audiences into identifying with their puppy love drama and drum up support. She shrewdly softens the spectators toward her by consciously appealing to sexual stereotypes, playing the woman’s part by reshaping her archer’s arrows into Cupid’s bow. Sex becomes another weapon added to her expanding arsenal. The way Katniss and Peeta consciously manufacture these cardboard images for themselves, knowing they will appeal to the greatest number of people watching at home, has as much to say about how reality TV show contestants adopt easily classifiable ‘types’ with which to pigeonhole themselves, as it does about the Hollywood dream factory’s similar manufacturing and promotion of phony star personas in order to sell their prepackaged celebrity ‘product’ to the public.\n\nIt’s that morbid mob of spectators that gives the Hunger Games staying power. As Gale points out, if everyone simply turned it off, tuned out and refused to watch, there would be no show. It would die the slow death of any other Neilson ratings casualty. This is mass technology’s variation on Blasco Vincente Ibáñez’s extreme-sport obsessed, thousand headed hydra, prophesied as far back as his bullfighting book Blood and Sand over a century ago. Here, the typically macabre Master of Ceremonies with his ghoulish running commentary, played in the past by such actors as Gig Young in They Shoot Horses Don’t They?, Joel Grey in Cabaret and Richard Dawson in The Running Man, has been splintered into the megalomaniacal TV host of Stanley Tucci and the ice blooded programmer of Wes Bentley with his tellingly satanic goatee. By focusing on the ghoulishness of the grinning crowds, The Hunger Games becomes a rueful meditation on the fame monster, the same way Chicago was. Like Roxie Hart in that film, Katniss must also play to and manipulate the public in the interest of self preservation. Essentially, she must learn to emulate Peeta, displaying the same sort of feminine wiles, while Peeta must take on many of Katniss’ traits, becoming more physically rugged and capable of taking care of himself.\n\nWhile affording a testing ground for her survival skills, the games also serve to soften Katniss. They become the vehicle through which she’s able to reclaim the finer qualities she’d had to forego in the hand to mouth struggle for survival. The psychological roots of her stoicism become clear when she commands her fragile mother, who had gone to pieces following her husband’s death, not to give sway to her emotions again “No matter what you’re feeling…,” since she’s the only one left to take care of Prim now and has to be strong for her sake. Forced to become the ‘man’ of the house following her father’s death, Katniss has had to be stalwart, steel willed and dry eyed for so long she’s lost touch with her softer, feminine side. Her mother’s debilitating state has left her terrified of what being emotional, sensitive, a woman could likewise reduce her to. It’s why she reacts so violently to Peeta’s public declaration of love, believing being seen in such a light makes her seem ‘weaker’ than the competition and hence more vulnerable. Katniss’ relationship with Rue induces her to get back in touch with her better half, the part of herself she’d long suppressed, by reopening those reservoirs of emotion.\n\nHaving devoted her life to looking after Prim more like a mother than a sister, the hard edged Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games knowing she’s the far more capable of the two, the dainty little Primrose being too prim and proper to put up much of a fight. Katniss’ sole reason for participating was in order to protect her sister, which is why it cuts her so deep when she proves unable to protect Rue, who reminds her so much of Prim. Of course we’re aware that this is simply a function of the story, that Rue and all the other ‘innocents’ must be eliminated by the long arm of fate and coincidence by story’s end so that Katniss and Peeta can emerge victorious without actually getting any blood on their own hands. Other people do all the dirty work for them. What keeps us riveted is observing the moviemakers’ machinations in orchestrating all of this.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense that Katniss would be assigned an assessment of eleven when her anti-establishment attitude should be the last thing the committee encourages, considering the purpose of the games. She’s a rebel who gives the beaten down viewers hope and inspiration, her subversive actions (showing mercy by protecting Rue and opting to go together rather than killing Peeta), spark a fire in the viewers, proving to them that despite the government’s attempt to squash their souls and dehumanize them in spirit, they remain men capable of performing heroic deeds, of fighting back. Katniss’ three-fingered salute recalls the peace sign of counter culture days when a contentious America, embroiled in the midst of Vietnam, was likewise encouraged by the young generation to make love instead of war.\n\nBecause the movie is told subjectively, almost entirely from Katniss’ point of view, we don’t get a fully developed sense of the impact the Hunger Games are having on the other contestants, much less on the nationwide audience, or how effectively Katniss’ shrewd manipulations are pushing their buttons. One wonders precisely where her groundswell of support is originating from. For all we know, there may be Katniss fan clubs cropping up all across the country. All we ascertain for certain is the impact her compassionate treatment of Rue has on her home sector.\n\nThis futuristic society may genetically engineer killer bee-like ‘tracker jackers’ and whatever those hellhounds are supposed to be in order to perfect more lethal and effective murder machines, the same way they train young athletes like Cato specifically for combat in the games, but what feasible purpose would a hybrid like a mockingjay, a cross between a mockingbird and a blue jay serve? Rue’s district has found a way to use its imitative calls as a means of communication that circumvents the monitoring of the state, much the same way slaves, forbidden from speaking and gathering, knitted symbolic designs into the patterns of quilts whose hidden meanings their masters weren’t capable of interpreting. Moreover, this reference to mockingjays evokes free form associations with To Kill a Mockingbird, which also focused on racism, oppression, and the injustice of a corrupt political system.\n\nReduced to a number instead of a name, Peeta’s statement on the eve of the games about wanting to make a gesture to let the Capital know it doesn’t “own him” (which will subsequently give rise to Katniss’ spontaneous three fingered salute) further links events to the baggage of oppression. Hunted down like an escaping slave, with a pack of hounds baying at her heels by the end, it’s no wonder Katniss and Cinna identify so strongly with one another, forging a deep and abiding bond, that Katniss serves as mentor to Rue, or that her life is unexpectedly saved by Thresh (Dayo Okeniyi), another black contestant, in recognition of this good deed.\n\nUpon Rue’s death, followed by Katniss’ compassionate burial of her beneath a bed of flowers, her District 11 erupts in a spontaneous outpouring of emotion, not unlike Katniss’ own. Smarting at the injustice, their feelings spill over into an impulsive uprising, suppressed by the storm trooper-like peacekeepers, who turn the hoses on them, invoking news footage of equally reactionary official response to Civil Rights marchers, and linking events further with the black experience. Though the games were specifically conceived as punishment for a previous rebellion, and as a standing threat serve as warning to the outlying districts against any future revolts, this demonstration shows that they’re actually having a deleterious effect. We’re given the false impression that the other districts will follow the lead of 11, rising up in a chain reaction of civil disturbances, akin to the way political revolt swept like a contagion across Egypt, Libya, and the Middle East during the Arab Spring not long ago.\n\nThere’s something decidedly unsavory about watching children degenerate into bloodthirsty little savages. After all, civilization is designed to indoctrinate the wild child right out of them. The Hunger Games on the other hand turn this notion on its head. They’re a ritualized, state imposed exhibition of survival of the fittest. Watching this movie, I’m left with the same impression I received when I first became acquainted with the Lord of the Flies. The fine line between the civilized and the savage is so thin, it doesn’t take much of a catalyst to initiate the process of solipsism, regressing people to a more primitive state. The movie condemns the dehumanizing depths to which humans are reduced in the struggle for survival, forced in essence to deny their better nature in favor of brute animal force. Roped into the branches, Katniss is like a monkey in that tree, recalling our ape ancestors and when she’s again treed by the pack of bullies later, we seem to be watching a hunting party riding to hounds. The games are intended to reduce the participants to their primal roots, turning back the clock to the time when we were all hunter-gatherers engaged in a predatory battle with the elements and other hostile clans. What’s horrifying about the film is, despite taking place in a presumably civilized future, the mentality and ritualistic practices engaged in are as chillingly brutal and barbaric as anything dreamed up in the most wildly pagan past. For all his apparent technological advancement, mankind has morally and spiritually regressed to a more brutish, primitive stage in his development.\n\nAt times the movie suggests a metaphor for militaristic societies where the nation’s best and brightest become glorified cannon fodder. Alexander Ludwig’s Cato is the arch villain of this piece, a state trained assassin who graduated from government run military schools as a lethal weapon programmed to kill. To professionals like him this is all fun and games, a lark. An extension of the mock ups he’s been training for his whole life these are real war games. Banding together for strength in numbers, these cold blooded professionals are not unlike roaming street gangs that pick off the weak, the wounded or stragglers, displaying a disturbing pack behavior that recalls the hunting practices of other wild beasts of prey. It’s the same herd mentality that underlies commonplace schoolyard bullying, taken to its penultimate extremes.\n\nAs in Lord of the Flies, the weaker and younger children’s only chance for survival is by submitting to the will of the older and more dominant, as Peeta does when he joins forces with Cato’s crew to hunt down Katniss. It’s the fascistic rule of strength over weakness on a field of combat where might makes right. The Hunger Games’ lack of age limits (anyone from twelve to eighteen can qualify) has high schoolers in competition with elementary school kids. Without any weight divisions to make the contest seem more fairly matched, everyone’s just poured into the ring together pell-mell, minus rules or a sense of fair play. Anything is permissible as long as it makes for a good show. But if all the committee really wants is an exciting competition, one would think they’d pick their tributes according to talent and skill sets rather than by totally random lotteries.\n\nWhile reducing the characters to their base natures by drawing out their animal instinct for survival, the movie remains amusingly silent concerning man’s other rudimentary biological imperative- survival of the species. When Cato corners Katniss in that tree and starts climbing up after her, his baiting taunts take on the unsettling aura of sexual threats, which wouldn’t be unexpected, given their suggestive glances and wary appreciation of one another’s physical prowess back at training camp. There they had sized each other up as if scoping out potential mates. Each recognizes the considerable skills the other possesses and pegs him or her as their primary competition. But the movie skirts the underlying attraction between Katniss and Cato, the mutual recognition that in the other can be found their equal and ideal physical match. During the course of the games, their victory can only be assured by the destruction of the other and that means by any means necessary, adding a layered, lethal edge to the traditional battle of the sexes. In Cato’s attempt to gain the upper hand then, it wouldn’t seem anything out of the ordinary for this unprincipled, state trained killer to use sexual domination as an additional weapon, and he wouldn’t be alone. After all, in his televised flirtations, Peeta was similarly exploiting his more romantic inclinations toward Katniss in order to likewise gain an edge, just as an uncharacteristically coquettish Katniss will later toy with Peeta’s feelings without his knowledge, in order to garner public compassion. The movie discreetly pulls back from going quite that far though. The Hunger Games revels in untold numbers of brutal, underage bloodlettings, but exploring the way wily teens can use sexual mind games and physical force to manipulate and control one another is believed to be going a tad too far.\n\nWe’ve seen this premise played out many times with adults as the protagonists, in movies like Death Race 2000, Rollerball and The Running Man. But by reducing the average age of the contestants in this competition by decades, the minds behind The Hunger Games are attempting to ratchet up the shock value in a particularly lurid way. Little kids are naturally inclined to emulate adults but it seems downright perverse to have them being primed for such violence, engaging in extreme, grown up blood sports that are far too mature for their tender years. This is an NC-17 concept, tamed and marketed toward a PG-13 demographic, reality TV turned into child snuff for the entertainment of the masses. And parents can’t very well rail against the negative impact of violence in the movies when it’s their very sons and daughters who are perpetrating it onscreen.\n\nIn theory, The Hunger Games isn’t really that far removed from the structure of horror films, in which the chief thrill arises from the myriad way the moviemakers devise to dispatch the cast, progressively whittling it down until only one is left standing. There’s death by hornet nest, poisoned berry, sword, spear, knife, neck snapping, and wild dog pack. I can only imagine how the sequels in this new franchise are going to have to keep upping the ante to maintain the same level of suspense. More than likely the brutality of the games will have to be increased tenfold in the movies to come. That the script doesn’t delve deep enough, leaving things feeling half baked, with characters not fully delineated and relationships not thoroughly unraveled may simply be the nature of the beast. I left the first Twilight film feeling the same way. The moviemakers’ tactics are to leave many things unsaid, by means of intro into the next installment, the way old cliffhangers used to have audiences dangling from chapter to chapter.\n\nThe book, which was written for the same tween audience the Twilight films are angled toward, was understandably sanitized for the sake of its intended readership, but a subject this dark and disturbing would require emotional soundings not yet possessed by its underage fan base in order to do it full justice. Consequently, the easy and obvious points this movie adaptation scores at the expense of reality TV, totalitarian regimes and equality of the sexes seem glib and superficial. The age limits have been lowered, but despite the face lift the movie isn’t really saying anything refreshingly novel. In a way, it seems pointless to spoon feed kids stories based on more adult subject matter when they’re not really at a point in life to yet grasp the finer shadings. It’s not likely they even realize that the movie is surreptitiously mock(jay)ing them for being the first generation to make reality TV a respectable career path to fame and fortune. But at least there’s an alternative out there now, something more substantive being offered for them to chew on aside from angst ridden vampires and lovelorn werewolves, even if this one can likewise be pared down to the same arcane emotional triangle, with a girl caught between two boys who seem to have been solely conceived to embody opposing extremes of the male spectrum, the sensitive artist and the virile athlete, the way women used to be narrowly conceived as either virgins or whores.\n\nThanks to the tight editing by Christopher S. Capp, Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling this movie is far more suspenseful than real reality TV. Yet like those shows, we’re still encouraged to place our bets, same as the viewing audience onscreen. We only wish we could call in to vote some of the more annoying contestants off. Of course the favorites we’re coerced into cheering for also happen to be the film’s stars, since they’re the only two contestants out of the twenty four that we’re really permitted to get to know to any appreciable degree. It’s a mark in the movie’s favor that it manages to generate such nail biting suspense. Even when we know full well the odds needn’t be in Katniss’ favor because the strength of her star power renders her impervious, it’s fascinating to watch the game played out. Unfortunately, the other contestants aren’t distinguished one from the other to give us the same rooting interest, so we can’t really become emotionally invested in the possibility of their survival. Like Gale this go-round, they hardly seem to be in the running at all and we quickly lose interest in trying to keep count of how many times the cannon booms, signaling the death of another one. Apart from Rue, there’s no sense of horror at the other young kids’ quite brutal deaths, hardly even a tremor of remorse. And though we’re loathe to admit it, we’re glad that their elimination moves our heroes one step closer to victory. This is the same emotion that surges through Katniss herself, making her feel like a ruthless opportunist. It’s survivor’s guilt, the same guilt that’s turned Woody Harrelson’s previous victor, Haymitch Abernathy, into an alcoholic stooge. While there’s a part of us in disbelief, right up to the starting shot, that these kids are going to be made to go through with this travesty, at some point along the way we find ourselves becoming as callous as the TV audience onscreen, rationalizing that there’s nothing wrong with a little friendly competition. As the kids keep dropping like flies, we become inured and start rooting for these teens to slaughter one another or be bumped off by extenuating circumstances, so that surrounding events can be propelled forward, edging our heroes one step closer to the winner’s circle.\n\nThe Hunger Games’ at least tries not to glorify the violence or ratchet it up to fever pitch the way a director like Ridley Scott does in movies like Gladiator and Robin Hood. While probably deserving of a rating more severe than the one the MPAA slapped on it, there’s nothing truly gratuitous about the extreme violence depicted here (far more of which is suggested than shown) since it’s integral to the plot. Each death is intended to jolt the audience more than usual because of the tender age bracket of the participants. But while the filmmakers are pointing an accusing finger at us for watching, making us a complicit accomplice with that desensitized audience likewise following the game so avidly onscreen, the deeper irony seems to escape them. By assembling this movie, they are themselves promoting the same sort of violence as spectator sport they’re damning the network programmers for doing with the televised games. That the blood lettings are staged rather than real seems like an afterthought when the excellent editing is intended to whip moviegoers into a frothing, betting frenzy of their own, concerning who shall live and who shall die. Game on.\n\n↧\n\nThe Eagle\n\nFocus Features (2011) 114 min. PG-13\n\nDirector: Kevin Macdonald\n\nScreenplay: Jeremy Brock; based on The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff\n\nCinematography: Anthony Dod Mantle; Editing: Justine Wright\n\nProduction Design: Michael Carlin; Set Decoration: Rebecca Alleway\n\nCostumes: Michael O’Connor\n\nScore: Atli Örvarsson\n\nStars: Channing Tatum (Marcus Flavius Aquila), Jamie Bell (Esca), Donald Sutherland (Uncle Aquila), Mark Strong (Guern), Tahar Rahim (Seal Prince), Denis O’Hare (Lutorius), Aladár Laklóth (Flavius Aquila)\n\nThe Eagle is well crafted, perfectly respectable popcorn entertainment. The majority of the movie was taken on location in Scotland (Glasgow, Loch Lomond, Summer Isles, Achnahaird Bay, etc.) by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, the Oscar-winning cameraman who also shot director Kevin Macdonald’s previous The Last King of Scotland. For The Eagle Mantle has photographed a beautiful expanse of the country, offering a wide variety of scenery, from grassy glens to the snowy Highlands. The result is a variety of gloriously breathtaking vistas. The horizons and skies have been shot in a manner that attempts to recapture the look and feel of a sparsely populated vanished world. With seas of heather waving in the wind like fields of gold, Scotland has been made to seem strangely remote, as vast and uninhabited as the pre-Columbian Midwest, scattered here and there with wandering nomads and primitive tribes in their low, stone thatch houses.\n\nWhen centurion Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum) first arrives at his new command post on the outskirts of Roman occupied Britain, it’s by boat, drifting down a primeval river that might have remained unchanged since the beginning of the world. It’s a scene straight out of Aguirre, and we seem to be floating with him through the mists of time, on another unsettlingly still tributary of the Amazon with hostile, unseen natives waiting to riddle the soldiers with arrows from all sides. The fact that these Romans are on a strange, dangerous and unexplored region of the map is accentuated by such surreal sights as a herd of milk white cattle fording across the stream directly ahead, urged on by a spectral young savage on horseback. This is Britain, for goodness sake, but we’re seeing it as if for the first time, the way John Smith saw Virginia in The New World. We’re forced to see it the way the Romans do, and from their perspective it’s an uninviting, inhospitable alien land, peopled by hostile tribes and long haired barbarians. From these opening images Macdonald effectively transports us back to an earlier age, when life was shorter, bloodier and more brutal.\n\nThere are several excitingly mounted, excellently choreographed and nerve wrackingly edited action sequences which the two leads, with their similar background in dance, bring off gracefully. In a jump out of your seat moment, the fort is laid siege to in the dead of night, at the very instance we’ve been lulled into a false sense of security believing the overeager young commander had issued a false alarm, needlessly dragging his men out of bed in order to report to their posts. When the escaping fugitives take to the river, near the end, the jostling, hand held camerawork simulates their point of view as they navigate the rapids, the shafts of sunlight streaming across the cliffs as if this were a mystical emerald forest. Macdonald musters some great angles and formations, stationing the painted Seal people like silent sentinels at strategic intervals along hill and dale, and in the skirmish in front of the fort as the roman detachment marches out in time, using their shields to form a hurtling human tank that cuts a swath through the swirling sea of Britons as cleanly as a clipper sluicing through waves. The soldiers form a protective barricade around the bound captives as the savages assail them from all sides, the circle progressively shrinking as the roman numerals dwindle like Custer’s men at the Little Big Horn. Though the scene ends too abruptly with Marcus’ smash up, it’s pretty thrilling up till then. With his overhead, eagle eye views Macdonald might be forming geometric compositions out of the soldiers the same way Busby Berkeley used to do with his chorus girls.\n\nEarnest in intent, The Eagle seems like something of an anomaly on a screen overrun these days by less sober ancient world epics. It’s a far cry from the equally enjoyable Clash of the Titans remake, for instance. There’s been an attempt to impart a greater sense of gravity to proceedings than with the standard historical action adventure of this sort, movies like 300 and The Immortals. Boasting some semblance of authenticity, The Eagle is more on the level of a Troy or an Alexander. It wants to be taken seriously. Indeed, with the equally down and dirty Rome having been cancelled on HBO and Spartacus trying to find its way on Starz following the death of lead Andy Whitfield, The Eagle can proudly stand as the most impressive recent sampling of what’s becoming a popular new entertainment staple- Roman revisionism (a new version of Cleopatra is also being bandied about). If Gladiator revitalized the sword and sandal epic over a decade back, proving it to still be a viable film form, then the trend seems to currently be peaking with movies like this tripping over one another with increasing frequency at the box office. The Eagle itself comes on the heels of the British made, Michael Fassbender vehicle The Centurion, which was also loosely based on the same historical incident.\n\nAn eerie forward sets the mood, with the legend that “In 120 A.D. the Ninth legion of the Roman army marched into the unconquered territory of northern Britain and were never seen again. All 5,000 men vanished together with their treasured standard. Shamed by this great loss, the emperor Hadrian ordered the construction of a giant wall to cut off the north of Britain forever. Hadrian’s Wall marked the end of the known world.” It’s an intriguing premise, which may put viewers in mind of the equally unexplained disappearance of the 1st 5th Norfolk Regiment on Gallipoli during the early stages of WWI (surveying the Scottish landscape, in quest of the lost legion, it’s observed that “Five thousand men could disappear in a single glen. And there are thousands of glens. You could search for months and still find nothing.”). But like that much embroidered, more modern ‘mystery,’ Jeremy Brock’s script, adapted from Rosemary Sutcliff’s book for young adults, The Eagle of the Ninth, is more fiction than fact, strictly history according to Hollywood and, as such, to be taken with a grain of salt despite the realistic milieu. The meat and potatoes of the movie wisely concerns itself with the purely fictional drama of Channing Tatum’s Marcus, the son of the annihilated battalion’s commander, and his seeking to recover the lost standard of the Ninth, the gold plated eagle of the title, by which he believes he can erase the stain his father’s crushing military defeat left upon his name.\n\nMarcus’ men disrespect and challenge him, trying to undermine his authority at every turn. It’s not just because he’s young and inexperienced in his first command, but because they view him as an evil omen since he comes of such tainted stock. Being placed under the command of a man whose father notoriously led his own legion into the waiting jaws of death would seem a troublesome twist of fate; no good can come of it. The garrison’s previous commander who “couldn’t wait to get away,” isn’t even there to meet Marcus when he arrives and the affront is deeply felt, enhancing his long standing sense of unworthiness.\n\nAs with his father’s legacy, this boy who’s trying to make a name for himself finds he has inherited no prize in this shoddy garrison in such a bad state of disrepair. The latrines are broken and the men consider Britain one big sh*thole, so it seems no right thinking person would choose to come here of his own volition, as Marcus has, unless he had something to hide, or to prove (“This is where my father lost the eagle, this is where I was going to win so much glory that no Roman would ever dare bring up his name again.”). He’s like a refugee, a man on the run, but what he’s trying to escape from, his name, his legacy, is precisely what he runs smack into, more and more so as the past seems to be repeating itself and the elder Aquila’s identity begins to merge with that of the younger. Marcus may be shamed by having to bear his disgraced father’s name (when Lutorius, his second in command, suggests he has family ties to the area he flatly denies it), but it’s his name as well, and he finds he can’t run away from himself.\n\nDivesting himself of his armor on a wooden stand that looks suspiciously like a crucifix (indication of how pilloried and persecuted he must feel), Marcus prays for the strength and wisdom to lead his men well, to not dishonor his legion. Feeling his father’s failure to be a reflection on him, Marcus needs to restore the elder Aquila’s reputation for his own peace of mind. As he’s well aware, he’s under intense scrutiny. Everyone is judging him (he most of all) just waiting for him to make a false move, slip up, fall on his face. Yet he earns his regiment’s begrudging respect by the way he successfully acquits himself in battle, lighting a torch to the entrenchments encircling the besieged fort and coated with flammable pitch, thereby saving countless lives.\n\nFor holding the post under extreme duress the fourth cohort is given the golden laurel for conspicuous gallantry, and her commander an honorable discharge due to his wounds. Only in his twenties and already drummed out of the army, Marcus is like an embittered war vet, hobbling about on crutches with a useless leg. His dreams of securing glory on a field of combat destroyed, he’s forced to become inventive and pursue other avenues to self realization. “I will not sit in some villa for the rest of my days, rotting and remembering. If I can’t win back my family’s honor by being a soldier then I’ll do it by finding the lost eagle.” he resolutely states.\n\nThough we’re fully an hour into proceedings before it becomes clear exactly where events are leading, the movie’s emotional core centers around the strong attachment that develops between Marcus and the British slave boy he rescues from certain death in the gladiatorial ring, Esca (Jamie Bell), as they set out in quest of this treasure. It’s a bond that cuts deeper than the visible iron shackles that bind master to slave. As in The Defiant Ones, these two men are linked together by psychological impediments and social restraints that keep them all bound up, mentally and physically, long after the actual tethers have been lifted. Theirs is a relationship sparked by the whip and the chain, a tortuous, sado-masochistic attachment forged by fetters both real and invisible.\n\nIn essence, The Eagle concerns the oedipal complex of two overage boys with daddy issues. As Marcus reveals, “Ever since I can remember, all I wanted to be was a soldier like my father.” and later, equally dewy eyed, “I can still see him now, riding away for the last time. My father, centurion first cohort of the Ninth legion. Can you imagine anything more magnificent?” All that Marcus has to remember his father by now is the little eagle replica he was given before he set out on the mission from which he’d never return. It’s become a talisman to his son, who wears the precious keepsake around his neck like a gold cross, praying on and kissing it as if it were a rosary. The searching question Marcus murmurs during his delirium, “Father, where are you” suggests the abandoned boy subconsciously believes tracking down that lost golden relic he saw carried off to battle will somehow also lead him back to his absent parent, bringing some emotional closure to his life (“You know, sometimes I dream that I find my father alive up here. That he survived in some hidden place.”). Aquila, Marcus’ surname, means ‘eagle’ in Latin, so it’s no coincidence that the two concepts become so merged in his mind. Not since The Maltese Falcon has the quest for an elusive metal bird seemed such absorbing stuff as these dreams are made of.\n\nWhen Marcus meets his uncle for the first time, the indication is that he will serve as a father figure to him, replacing the one he lost. But Donald Sutherland seems so vastly unlike any other human being who ever drew breath comparison is impossible (only with Kiefer in the role could a family resemblance have made any sense). He assures doubting Marcus that “if (his father) died defending the eagle, he died honorably.” But Marcus fears that his father was a coward who ran away in the face of death, as he imagines him doing, rather than standing and fighting like a man. Moreover, he perceives this to have been a sign of weakness, a moral failing on his part, which explains why the son feels it so impingent to test his own mettle, proving beyond doubt his courage and fortitude.\n\nConsequently, Marcus never acknowledges his own weaknesses, never complains despite the constant misery in his leg, and tries to dismiss his slave before the operation on it can begin, not wanting to be seen in such a prone, powerless state. When Marcus awakes after his excruciating surgery, the only thing he wants to know is if he ‘shamed’ himself, by betraying any sign of weakness, if he cried, whimpered, screamed in pain while he was out. This determination to appear hard, to put on a brave front, underpins his obsession with recovering the eagle. Marcus says the standard represents Rome, but he’s wants to find it for purely personal reasons, not patriotic ones. To him, it represents his father’s lost honor, “The eagle lost, honor lost. Honor lost, all lost.” It’s this lost honor that he’s trying to recover, clearly equating honor with strength and bravery, and bravery with being a man. He’s searching for the gold eagle, but he might just as well be trying to reclaim his family jewels.\n\nMarcus doesn’t respond to his uncle’s curiosity as to why he saves Esca from the ring, but such unexpected magnanimousness fits his psychological profile. Marcus, to whom bravery is everything, admires the bold slave’s nerve in the face of the baying crowd and uneven odds, throwing down his weapons and refusing to give the spectators the show they paid to see rather than making a public spectacle of his death. Plagued by the suspicion that his own father turned tail and ran, Marcus sees Esca’s unflinching willingness to meet death head on as a sign of courage rather than the cowardice the audience takes it for. Ironically, this defiance Esca displays when confronted with death, is rewarded with his life.\n\nLike Marcus, Esca is also haunted by the specter of his deceased father, in trembling awe of his heroism. “My father was Cunoval, bearer of the blue war shields of the Brigantes. Lord of 500 spears.” Esca crows, bearing his name with pride. When he learns that Marcus’ father commanded the enemy forces, his face drops, and we realize just how deeply the two men are divided by the standing animosity that exists between their warring cultures. The fathers of both fell fighting on opposing sides of the same conflict, convinced that his position was the only correct one to take. While Marcus’ father is regarded as a pariah, causing the son who bears his name to distance himself and disown any relation, Esca’s is renowned throughout the length of the north; he merely has to mention his esteemed father’s name in order to be feted and fawned over.\n\nThat Esca idolizes his father and, in a sense, also feels diminished in relation to his larger than life legend, is signified by his correlation with the Seal prince’s starry eyed young son, who looks up to and hero worships Esca just as blindly as Esca does his father. The analogy indicates that Esca is likewise still a wee little laddie inside, wetting himself in dumbstruck awe of his deified Da. Like Marcus, Esca measures his idea of honor against his father’s repute. Pledging himself to his master’s service as bond slave it’s with “an oath of honor,” vowing, “I’m the son of a Brigante who’s never broke his word. My father’s dagger is my bond.” Esca expresses as strong a desire to live up to the high standards his father and martyred brothers set for him, as Marcus does to live down his father’s shame. This universal oedipal complex is what bonds them, brothers under the skin. It’s the tie that binds them together more strongly than the literal chain of master to slave.\n\nMarcus’s preoccupation with following in his father’s footsteps likewise makes him seem like an emotionally arrested adolescent, having never really matured from the traumatized boy with abandonment issues he once was in flashback. This explains why the kid cast as Marcus as a child is the spitting image of that boy at the beginning, glimpsed for just an instant herding those cattle across the stream (the same young actor, Bence Gerö, was cast in both parts). Marcus, so anxious to prove himself courageous, strong and honorable, a man, still secretly feels like that helpless little boy inside, lost, scared and needing his absent father to comfort and protect him. It’s here on English soil where Marcus will face down his past and exorcise his inner demons, the inner child who still haunts him, growing into the man he wished his father had been. Until that time, he’s just playing at being a big boy, same as the professionally untrained Tatum still seems like an underwear model just playing at being an actor.\n\nI may have missed something along the line, but when precisely did Channing Tatum become a star? The man has been struggling to establish a screen persona for so long he threatens to become Hollywood’s next Josh Hartnett. He’s tried himself out in just about every type of role there is (in the last year alone there’s been The Son of No One, The Dilemma, Haywire, The Vow), but has yet to find one that fully connects with the public. He seems to be all over the place, yet at the same time so aimless, he’s even taken to Twitter to ask his fans for career advice. His specialty seems to be soldiers (Stop Loss, Dear John, Rise of Cobra, his centurion here), and he’s a natural for the sort of parts that can take full advantage of his beefy physique, dancers (Step Up), ballplayers (Coach Carter), boxers (Fighting) and bullheaded brutes, brawny characters who do their thinking with their fists, as he did in A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, his most well received performance to date. Personally, I think it would be amusing to see the actor attempt the role of Stanley in Streetcar; he might not be half bad. Tatum makes a decent action hero (another G.I. Joe film is on the slate), but in this particular historic guise he seems as anachronistic as Brando did when he appeared in Julius Caesar.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Tatum’s career is suffering from advanced Marky Mark syndrome. He’s going to have to find a way to make his hard bodied, knuckleheaded image work for, rather than against him, in order to gain some street cred as a serious actor. It’s likely going to be a while before he’s able to entirely shake off the onus of his early work as a Ricky Martin music video ho, Abercrombie and Fitch underwear ad model, and even more disreputable stint as a stripper. The fact that Tatum seems to have the good natured PR sense to laugh about this publicly, with a self effacing gig hosting SNL and starring role in an upcoming vehicle inspired by his own life on the pole, he might be able to live down his past, at least if he doesn’t start taking himself and his present prospects too seriously (he’s already turned actor slash producer).\n\nThough he’s upstaged by his scrappy co-star, The Eagle is actually one of Tatum’s better performances, he even manages to disguise that disconcerting accent (he’s from rural Alabama but sounds like inner city Jersey) by descanting in the same flat, declamatory English that actors generally affect for period pieces set in eras where there’s no real way to know what the dead languages sounded like (unaccountably, the British Bell has been coached to speak in an identical vocal range here, sometimes lilting his phrases with the inappropriate suggestion of a Scottish burr). The actor can seem sympathetically human on sporadic occasion, such as his glimmer of self doubt that he may have been wrong about the night attack, his humiliation when the contingent he sent out to scout for the missing grain wagon is captured and beheaded right before the fort, and his blush of pride at hearing that the same soldiers who once disparaged him are now eager to know how their captain fares. But the action figure Tatum’s playing doesn’t demand much more of him than G.I. Joe did.\n\nWhile we commiserate with his Marcus’ desire to measure up, sullen, sulking Tatum doesn’t fully give himself over to exploring the character’s insecurity in his untried new role as commander and chief. His Marcus is forever putting on a brave front, in an attempt to disassociate himself from his weak father’s failures, but the director hasn’t included enough balancing scenes in which he breaks down and reveals his own vulnerabilities, at least to the audience, or to Esca, with whom he does briefly start to open up. With Tatum in the part, Marcus just seems like an unvarying series of brave faces, alternately trading up his limited number of expressions for comedy and tragedy as if they were that two-sided Janus head mask the gladiator wears in the ring. And it’s difficult to identify with his character’s journey, since the outdated notion of eugenics, in which genetically predisposed people are susceptible to the sins of their fathers, being defined and distinguished by their lineal line of descent, no longer sits so well with the notion of rugged individualism, which tells us that everyone is supposed to be his own man.\n\nTatum has filled out from the lithe dancer he was in Step Up, though with the added bulk his muscle bound body language has become far less fluid and expressive. Though he’s no greater shakes as an actor now than he was back then, he seems less lummox like than when he appears in more constrictive roles, since in The Eagle he has all outdoors to range around in. To flatter his hulking frame further, he’s been cast opposite the thin, slightly built Jamie Bell. Macdonald’s curious casting of strapping American Tatum seems to have been motivated in part by a desire for another abrasively loud, larger than life portrait similar to Forest Whittaker’s in The Last King of Scotland, to offset the quieter one of the small, pale British co-star with whom the director is more emotionally invested, as he was with James McAvoy in that earlier film. Jug eared Bell still appears all raw boned teenage angles, just growing into manhood, though it’s been over a decade since he made a splash as the spastic, spindly limbed child star of Billy Elliott. That movie was released the same year as Gladiator, the film to which movies like The Eagle still owe their ongoing fount of inspiration, and Billy Elliott lost big to it in the awards rounds, so it must give Bell especial pleasure to have grown up to fill Russell Crowe’s sizable leather sandals.\n\nIn the movie that established him, Bell played a kid who takes much flack from his working class British community for wanting to be a ballerina, and certainly that must play with the psyche of a child actor, especially as he grows into adolescence and is at pains to prove his virility. With his scraggly new scruff of facial fur and the film’s strenuous fight scenes, arduous horseback riding over rough terrain, wild boar hunts, and gladiatorial fights to the finish, The Eagle allows the gaunt, sharp featured young actor with a face preternaturally wizened, to show what a tough guy he can be when the occasion warrants. Bell seems as eager to prove himself in the eyes of the world as the Marcus character does.\n\nThe unintentional irony however is that there’s probably no genre with a stronger homoerotic subtext than gladiator movies, unless one takes into account buddy movies, in which the focus is on the platonic bromance shared by two strong male leads in the absence of women. The Eagle, with its scenes of male bonding and the growing attachment between master and slave, seems like a curious cross between these two classes of film. As far as queer theory goes it warrants closer inspection since many of the movie’s major themes, including the search for a strong father figure, Marcus’ sense that there’s something intrinsic in his character that makes him weaker than other men, his attempt to put on a hard, impassive front to disguise his secret insecurities, his determination to measure up in the eyes of a world that looks down on him, are intrinsic to the gay experience. Moreover, I’m not sure how properly masculine it appears for Bell to be cast as a slave passively submitting to the whims of a more dominant man, forced in effect to play the submissive, ‘female’ role in this male on male relationship. The relative slightness of his stature in comparison to Tatum visually accentuates this dynamic, reinforcing the notion that Bell is meant to represent the weaker sex.\n\nThe presumption is that Uncle Aquila buys Esca and makes a gift of him mistakenly assuming Marcus’ inclination to save the boy resulted from an unspoken attraction. Already struggling to eradicate any sign of weakness in his nature, this gesture embarrasses Marcus no end, as he assures Esca “You didn’t (beg for your life). I did, on your behalf… and I meant nothing by it.” In vain he tries to convince the boy that he has no use for him, but Esca pledges himself to Marcus’ service anyhow with the not entirely untender oath “I hate everything you stand for. Everything you are. But you saved me. And for that I must serve you.” A man who would willingly foreswear his independence in submission to another man seems like no man at all, undermining the new image sought by the young actor, at least until the situation shifts once his Esca is back on home turf and can be on top for a change, forcing Marcus to his knees.\n\nThere’s a docilely dazed, bovine vibe to Tatum’s features, as there was to the young Brando. It’s as though someone had taken a sledgehammer to his head. With his sloe eyes and slack jaw frequently tensed in strained concentration, he imparts the impression that he should be chewing cud. He’s a substantial side of beef and the movie goes out of its way to accentuate his heavy boned masculine beauty. Macdonald’s camera seems taken enough with his sculpted body to fixate on it, whether capturing a nearly nude Tatum rolling around under pelts of wolf fur with only the brief modesty of a loincloth to conceal him from glory, sporting a shimmery bronze breast plate that accentuates the cut of his ripped abs, or running around in midriff togas and makeshift tunics with leather tong fringe directing our eyes to his muscular calves. When he’s taken prisoner, his shirt will be scenically ripped to reveal his bulging biceps in a suggestive manner that makes it difficult to believe this testosterone fueled action movie wasn’t being marketed more with female filmgoers in mind.\n\nOther images seem pitched for their appeal to sublimated gay fantasy, such as the one where the Roman soldiers dig the entrenchments, their bare-chested torsos slick with sweat beneath the beating sun as they slip and slide around in the mud. Or the pagan Seal people’s strange, hallucinogenic rite of manhood ritual, as they writhe in the dirt on all fours, leapfrogging and lapping at each other’s faces, presided over by a shaman in glittery Mardi Gras mask and stag antlers that make him resemble a sexually licentious ram’s head, the horned beast. There are few other interpretations possible for scenes like the one where the surgeon forcefully exhorts the slave to pin Marcus down, to put his full weight on him (Harder!”), sounding like a sports commentator’s running blow-by-blow on the physical act of love. This semblance of simulated intimacy can’t help but bring the two men closer together, quite literally. It’s laughable in its obviousness, yet we feel no urge to laugh, even as we’re blushing in embarrassment for the actors who must behave as if they were blissfully unaware of the implications.\n\nIn fact, the entire movie operates on the same wavelength of sexually unaware prepubescence as the children’s book on which it was based. Events transpire in a nearly all-male world, where no girls are allowed and copulation seems like an unknown concept. The closest The Eagle comes to being heterosexually suggestive is when Marcus makes cow eyes at the giggling sister of the Seal prince, earning him a wallop across the face for the effrontery. Instead of the supple embrace of tender woman flesh, it’s Esca, with softened sympathies, who’s waiting dotingly by his master’s bedside when he wakes from surgery. After witnessing Marcus endure such suffering, Esca can’t help but admire his bravery as well.\n\nThe days that follow seem like deliriously happy times, an idyll straight out of Boy’s Life, with a no longer debilitated Marcus now fully functional. With the two men having seemingly become inseparable, they’re like the fox and the hound once divorced from their inherited prejudices. During their trek into the Highlands, they’ll come to an even better understanding of one another, with Esca watching Marcus pray, directing the smoke of the fire before him, and Marcus experiencing firsthand how Esca’s people live and worship. One or the other should convert since it’s only the bonds of matrimony, the old ball and chain that’s left to link them now. Whether walking out of the Senate victoriously at movie’s end in perfectly timed lockstep, hunting together or fighting side by side, they’re in perfect synch, ideal harmony; when one advances the other instinctively responds. They move as one, as if engaged in some arcane mating dance.\n\nThe original novel was written back in the more innocent 50’s, for a younger audience, so such innuendo in written form, if it existed at all, might have been entirely inadvertent and lost on the intended readership. But in our more cynical day it’s difficult not to misconstrue what we’re seeing in vivid, living color on screen, and get the wrong impression. Still somewhat callow himself, perhaps Bell also unwittingly overlooked all these intimations in his eagerness to play a part similar to the one that made such an impression on him as a child, when all he saw was the superficial macho accoutrements, and the suggestive subtext was lost on him.\n\nBell is introduced in a similar guise as Russell Crowe was in Gladiator, a captive slave forced to perform for the entertainment of the crowds, only here it’s at a shoddy facsimile of the Circus Maximus, constructed on the colonial fringes of the empire. Instead of professional gladiators, the crowds are offered undersized, malnourished slaves. Instead of exotic beasts, the arena makes due with mangy hounds in shabby coats, and in place of imported pygmies, macabre munchkins for comic relief. This downsized reproduction of the Roman arena, intended as an exact duplicate fashioned in flattering imitation of the original, is a satirical comment on how culturally imposed imperialism mutates and warps along the outer edges of the empire, where it becomes an indeterminate mixture of the domestic and influences from distant lands. Scenes like these are important in establishing the movie’s main theme concerning the clash of cultures, but its most clever thematic manifestation is in the conception of Hadrian’s Wall itself. The very existence of this structure serves to divide north from south, indication that the Highlands were considered a lost cause, its people beyond the pale, too ferocious and feral to ever be effectively tamed.\n\nA good deal of the film’s fascination lies in director Macdonald’s atmospheric evocation of this symbolic divide, the isolated colonial outpost stationed at the edge of the known world and safely separated from the menacing wilderness only by this thin barrier between the civilized and the savage. Stretching away into infinity at first glance, it’s an awe inspiring sight, harkening back to all the great siege gates in screen history, dating to Griffith’s Intolerance. It’s a pity then that more extensive use wasn’t made of it. Yet when those ominous gates separating the known from the unknown swing wide, the tingling sensation of the otherworldly is palpable. Beyond this point, for all we know, there might be dragons as marked on ancient maps, or the end of the earth itself, off whose edge explorers might fall (“No Roman can survive North of the wall.” Uncle Aquila warns). Like the otherwise hearty legionnaires, who themselves fear to explore it, we don’t know what might be out there waiting, so when Marcus breaches the gates in search of his bounty, accompanied only by his shifty, resentful, captive guide, we share in his sense of trepidation (“Didn’t they tell you this was the end of the world?” the gatekeeper warns “See you in the afterlife, Roman.”). As he passes nude, decapitated cadavers strung upside down from the treetops, a warning to all to turn back, he might be entering the deepest wilds of darkest Africa, populated by headhunters and cannibals, rather than the north of Briton, and the two men, lost dots against the wide open landscape, seem so swallowed up they’re like a knight and his squire cast adrift in a savage land.\n\nThough it transpires in the same Britain of King Arthur, The Eagle is set in the 2nd century, long before the age of chivalry, before Avalon, the Round Table, Robin Hood, eons before this area was enlightened enough to have even entered into the Dark Ages. Scores of Anglophile films over the decades have glorified the British Empire and its notion of itself as the most civilized nation on earth, so it’s unusual, almost startling, to see the pre-Christian Druid tribes and Scottish Picts (much of the dialogue in the latter half of the film is in Gaelic) depicted in the same manner as English films frequently depicted inhabitants of their own colonies. The clever irony of Macdonald’s movie is in reversing the more familiar historic dynamic. It is the Britons here who are presented as primitive, pagan worshipping, animal skin clad savages, themselves the disgruntled colonial subjects of a superior global power that has subjugated the island, placing it under foreign control.\n\nRome, at its imperial height, regards itself as extolling the same eminent virtues as the later British Empire would. These legionnaires consider themselves the torchbearers of civilization, and likewise look down on the indigenous local tribes they vanquish as superstitious, inferior barbarians; it’s to their advantage to have the benefits of superior Roman culture imposed upon them by force. Moreover, a direct correlation is drawn between Rome’s imperialist policies and those of more contemporary world powers, the aftershocks of which were still very much in evidence in many parts of the world at the time The Eagle of the Ninth was originally written. The book must have served as an unpleasant reminder that Britain herself was once in the same unenviable situation as her own occupied territories, the colonial holding of a vast empire upon whom the sun never set. By placing Britain in the same straits as the indigenous lands she would go on to conquer, English readers were obliged to ask themselves how they would like it if the situation were reversed. And this is a valid question, because The Eagle is very much about the worm turning.\n\nWhen Marcus says he’ll take Esca along on his quest since he can use his knowledge of the local languages, his uncle scoffs “He’s a Briton. He may not be from north of the wall, but he’s a Briton. He’ll slit your throat the moment you’re alone.” Marcus protests that, “He wouldn’t do that… he gave me his word.” inciting his uncle’s further ire. “His word? He’s a slave! He says what he says and he does what he does because he has to.” They’re the words of an Iago, meant to plant the seeds of doubt in Marcus’ mind, and ours, and they reverberate throughout the latter half of the movie as we just sit back, silently watching, waiting for the duplicitous Esca to rip away his thin veneer of civilization and go all caveman on him. The reverse turns out to be true.\n\nPassing through Hadrian’s Wall is like traveling through the looking glass where everything is backward and events can be seen from the opposite perspective. Marcus’ sense of nationalistic superiority shines through as he espouses the imperialist mindset, patronizing his slave with “The eagle is not a piece of metal. The eagle is Rome. It’s a symbol of our honor, every victory, every achievement. Wherever the eagle is, we can say ‘Rome did that.’ You wouldn’t understand, how could you?” There are two sides to every story, however, and the counterweight to this one is voiced by native son Esca “Seven years ago, you took our lands and we rose against you. My father and two brothers died; my mother also. My father killed her before the legionnaires broke through. He knew what they would do to her. She knelt in front of him as he slit her throat. Rome also did that.” What Marcus considers success and accomplishment could be regarded as just the opposite when viewed from the perspective of the oppressed. Unfortunately, history is written by the winners.\n\nTruth being relative, the film shows how vastly one’s assessment of the same event can differ from another’s. Upon learning that Esca’s Brigantes took part in the massacre, for instance, Marcus accuses him of having known where the eagle had fallen all along and of purposely leading him astray with “Your tribe was there! And they butchered my father’s men like dogs!” only to have his slave proudly contradict, “Your father came to kill! He came to punish us because we would not bow to the name of Rome. Yes, I’ve heard of this place. To me and to all my people it is the place of heroes.” North of the wall, the son of the Seal chief can declare that all Romans are savages, rather than vice versa. This is a world where everything seems wrong side up, where master can become slave and slave master.\n\nOnce on the other side, Esca takes the lead, advising “Whoever we meet, let me do the talking. If they find out you’re a Roman, they’ll kill you and me.” Silencing Celtic chants strum over the soundtrack as Marcus stands his horse at a respectful distance, watching his translator inveigle information from the wayfarers they meet along the road. Master in Roman controlled South Britain, he’s virtually helpless here, muted, shriveled in stature and importance. As Esca increasingly gains dominance, their roles subtly start to shift, with Marcus forced to rely more and more on his slave for guidance and direction, and becoming proportionately less and less sure of himself, his surroundings and ability to survive on his own. “You’d be dead in a ditch if it weren’t for me.” Esca assures him, undermining his psyche even further.\n\nHe openly defies Marcus’ authority, to his livid master’s sputtering dismay (“How dare you! You’re still my slave.”), flatly refusing when commanded to ask some inhabitants they meet about the lost legion. Emboldened by their distance from the Roman occupied south, Esca becomes increasingly insolent in a manner he would never have dared to back home and there’s really nothing a flummoxed and flustered Marcus can do to make him mind here. Moreover, having learned what he has about the boy’s feelings toward Rome, Marcus is wary about whether Esca can truly be trusted. Unable to decipher what the slave is translating, he becomes suspicious that he may be leading him on a wild goose chase or, what’s worse, right into enemy hands.\n\nThe personal boundaries between master and slave have diminished to such a degree by this time that it actually comes as a shock to be reminded of the accepted social order when the men meet up with Guern, a deserter from the Ninth who has gone native and permanently taken up residence north of the wall. Now it’s Esca who’s left out in the cold while Marcus converses fluently in his native tongue once more. Bolstered with a sense of his rightful place as lord and master, through fleeting contact with his fellow countryman, Marcus weakly tries to reassert his authority, but the unruly slave has crossed so far over by this point there’s no reigning him back in. Forced to follow him around like a puppy, Marcus already seems to have lost his hold over Esca long before he’s ever taken captive and the shift in their power dynamic is made complete.\n\nWhen the two men are stumbled upon by the Seal tribe, Esca maintains that Marcus is his slave, and it’s not clear, at least not initially, whether he does so in order to save Marcus’ life, or if he’s seriously presuming to take over, buying into his own delusions of grandeur. To muddle matters further, this happens at the pivotal turning point in their relationship when Esca had stopped playing the slave and had actually attacked his master. Esca responds to Marcus’ frantic queries concerning what’s happening as he’s leashed and drug away with a curtly dismissive “You’re my slave. Do as I did for you and you’ll survive.” leaving the audience in as much suspense and doubt as Marcus as to whether or not this is just a sham for the benefit of the hostiles.\n\nThe story of the sly servant who outfoxes his imperious master is a perennial favorite, dating back to ancient times and seeing the tables turned here holds the same populist appeal it always has. When asked how he came north, Esca claims that “I tricked the Roman to help get me here.” While Marcus is reduced to slave, Esca, son of a slain Highland hero, is treated like royalty. The irony is punched up further as the Seal people give Esca advice on how to best handle the unmanageable Marcus, “You must teach your slave not to talk to you as he does. We will help you.” The movie treats this role reversal, which gives Marcus a taste of his own medicine, as poetic justice, but we still have to impulse check our urge to see ingrate Esca, whose miserable life Marcus earlier saved, put back in his place for the uppity airs he affects now that he’s risen above his station. We want to see him receive his comeuppance. It’s easy to commiserate then with the outraged Marcus when he assures his impertinent piece of property that “When I get the chance, I will kill you.” Taking back the life he gave seems the only fitting way to rectify matters.\n\nMarcus is unarmed, exposed, helpless in enemy territory, leaving him utterly dependent and at the mercy of a foreign culture whose customs he’s unfamiliar with and whose language he can’t understand. His experiences looking up from the bottom cause him to acquire a whole new slant on things. We’re given the impression that he’s being forced into such close proximity to the ways of the northern tribes in order to develop a fellow feeling for them, to see their side of the issue, perhaps to throw in his lot with them against Rome. Indeed The Eagle might have become a Druid Dances with Wolves.\n\nInstead of Marcus going native and turning his back on Rome however, it’s his father’s former legionary, Guern, who expresses the movie’s anti-imperialist sentiments. “All I know is that we had it coming. Why did they have to come north? There’s nothing here worth taking. Couldn’t they have been satisfied with what they had? Do they always have to punish and push on, looking for more conquests, more territories, more wars?” Despite such enlightened platitudes however, the Scottish clans encountered, representing a cross section of at least three different tribal and cultural groups, never develop fully into human beings in Marcus’ eyes or the movie’s, remaining feral, ferocious, foreign ‘others.’\n\nMacdonald’s most notable feature prior to The Eagle, The Last King of Scotland was also about culture clash, peppered with intimations of imperialistic role reversal in the unlikely friendship that developed between a transplanted Scot and a larger than life foreign leader. Macdonald’s admiration for the Highland clans’ fierce independence and rejection of Roman dominion is a direct carryover from Idi Amin’s similar sentiments as dictator of the former, British held, free republic of Uganda. In the earlier film, James McAvoy found himself an interloping stranger in a strange land, first accepted then targeted by the locals as the closest representative example of the oppressive enemy forces, much as Marcus is here.\n\nGiven the Scottish Macdonald’s apparently strong nativist sympathies, one had every right to believe that the heart of this movie would lie in his humanizing the Highland tribes, influencing his audience to side with their cause against Roman rule. Yet the way he depicts them, these sub humans aren’t far removed from the apocalyptic zombie hordes mustered for the Mantle shot 28 Days Later, an allusion enhanced by the fact that the same speeded up, kinesthetized camerawork is employed for the fights, attacks and ambushes here. Mel Gibson displayed more sensitivity toward his warring Scots in Braveheart, and Gibson is not exactly renowned for his sensitivity to other peoples.\n\nIn a spooky, atmospheric sequence, the men revisit the scene of the slaughter where all the tribes of the north beset the Ninth legion and the blanching, unburied bones of the massacred men still litter the forest floor like fallen leaves. While these ‘killing grounds’ evoke memories of the Cambodian killing fields, the various Northern tribes are purposely made to seem indistinct so that they can represent all indigenous cultures encroached upon by imperialist interests throughout the centuries. The painted warriors of the Seal people are said to have used the stones as alters to kill the officers, ripping their hearts out while they were still beating (“We could hear them being sacrificed.”), and the mental image links them to the blood rites of the Aztecs and other Mezo-American tribes. The archers who beset the small party in the forest might be South Seas Polynesians from the looks of thei"
