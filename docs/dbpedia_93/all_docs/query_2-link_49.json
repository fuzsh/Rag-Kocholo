        "text": "“One important aspect indicated by Rudolf Steiner is that Sophia is a cosmic being, whose nature embraces the whole cosmos. Thus, when we contemplate a map of the galaxy we gain insights into Sophia, who holds the blueprint for creation.”\n\nNovalis Hymns to the Night\n\n“BEFORE all the wondrous shows of the widespread space around him, what living, sentient thing loves not the all-joyous light, with its colors, its rays and undulations, its gentle omnipresence in the form of the wakening Day? The giant-world of the unresting constellations inhales it as the innermost soul of life, and floats dancing in its azure flood; the sparkling, ever-tranquil stone, the thoughtful, imbibing plant, and the wild, burning multiform beast inhales it; but more than all, the lordly stranger with the sense-filled eyes, the swaying walk, and the sweetly closed, melodious lips. Like a king over earthly nature, it rouses every force to countless transformations, binds and unbinds innumerable alliances, hangs its heavenly form around every earthly substance. Its presence alone reveals the marvelous splendor of the kingdoms of the world.” Novalis – Hymns to the Night translated by George MacDonald\n\nThis is part 1 the INTRO\n\nPart 2 (click Link) evaluates our CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL from the 5th Age of our American Perspective\n\nPart 3 (Click Link) evaluates SPIRIT-SELF, Manas and challenges of the 6th Age\n\nPart 4 (Click Link is Ready HERE) evaluates the 7th Age of Capricorn, Life-Spirit, Budhi, and the Eighth Sphere\n\nHitching a ride in the age of Pisces, and riding along without even an interest under which constellation our entire experiential age, our entire world is dominated by, is a typical bored passenger psychosis, a typical tired tourist apathy and indifference of the soul. No matter how many snapshots and photo ops we may take we still all ride within the hamster wheel of time like clueless mice in a cage. “Big wheel, keep on turning Proud Mary, keep on burning rolling, rolling, rolling…” (Click Link)\n\nWe are riding along, and we can raise the ante on both Rod Serling and Stephen King because they are part of the vast American legacy of our Fifth Age, The age of Pisces the Fishes. And the Fifth Age entails the Science of Imagination and the threshold of mapping out the future of our higher human consciousness.\n\nHowever it is the Science of Magical Idealism and the Science of Spiritual Science and the Michael School founded by Novalis, Goethe and Rudolf Steiner that may read the accurate writing of the Stars, the great Clock of the Heavens and the Cosmic Time Panorama left by St. John in his adoration of Sophia, Queen of the Starry Worlds.\n\nThere is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.\n\nWe verge, tiptoe and dance on the threshold of the unknown vastness of Rod Serling’s the THE FIFTH. In the geographic far West we call this place of Atavism, of sublimated American Clairvoyance and atavistic Twilight Zone Research, Hollywood. We are traveling in a very specific Space and Time, with the specific character, hazards and magic that the Constellation of Pisces offers us. It is reflected, glistening and sparkling on the rippling waters of the etheric and astral worlds of our lower devachan.\n\nWhat do we mean by the lower Devachan? Pertinent to our study we can show two interconnected examples of the curiosity of the Monsters of the American Psyche that we must grapple with from now on into the future, past the Sixth Epoch. The most important measure of GRAPPLING WITH THE MONSTERS OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHE is our ability, the literature and imaginative ability of our writers and authors, to comprehend what we are seeing with our eyes and our slumbering wits and sleeping consciousness. In comparative studies, most alert souls, would recognize the similarities between two examples of two Devachan assassins who already serve the Asuras (link).\n\nIn the course of our examination of Grappling with the Monsters of the American Psyche we will draw an occult map of The United States. We will define certain regional mysteries in the geographic structure of The United States. We will unveil, we will draw open the curtain and unveil where, GEOGRAPHICALLY, some of the Monsters that demonize the United States of America, dwell. We will understand the geographic location of Luciferic pockets of absolute soul corruption and addiction; We will locate and understand geographically pockets of absolute Ahrimanic desolation and corruption; and we will understand where and at what location the Asuric forces and the doorways to Asuric forces were cracked open and surged forth to spiritually corrupt and compromise all material existence on the Earth.\n\n(Rudolf Steiner March 22, 1909)\n\n“Lucifer’s influence in the Sentient Soul which has come into being through the transformation of the astral body; Ahriman’s effect upon the Intellectual Soul, which came about through the transformation of the etheric body; the influence of the Asuras is described as extend­ing into the human Consciousness Soul and the ego, whose activities in man are based on transformation of the physical body.\n\n“The effects of Ahriman are connected with the mirroring of the lower Devachan, that of the Asuras with the mirroring of the higher Devachan in the physical world. Here, we have a second criterion indicating that in the case of the Asuras, we are dealing with an independent realm of beings within the adver­sary powers.” HANS-WERNER SCHROEDER\n\nAs in Tolkien with Middle Earth, in real time, these monsters have infected the occult landscape of the Geography of the United States and polluted it with ghosts, demons and occult Devachan Assassins. So here are two examples of Asuric Devachan assassins pulled up out of the Dramatic Insights into the Science of Imagination native to the American Psyche. The first example that mirrors the second example is from the Matrix Series. There are two twin demonic Devachan Asuric Assassins who engage the Matrix Gang while they attempt to protect the Key Maker. (Click Link Twin Devachan Demonic Assassins).\n\nThe other example of the Twin Assassins comes from the early episodes of “Breaking Bad”. Hank, the brother in law to Walter, is shot and nearly killed by the two twin assassins from the cartels located in the South Western Region of the United States. These two assassins are modified versions of absolute merciless evil that have also arisen out of the strange mystical spirituality of the South West Region of the United States that Carlos Castaneda explored in his works. The mirrored example of these Devachan Assassins from the Matrix are – Tuco’s cousins from “Breaking Bad” (CLICK LINK Tuco’s Cousins).\n\nThe Matrix Series gives a pure dose, a Devachan dose, of the imaginative cognition of two Demonic Assassins (CLICK EXAMPLE 2). And following up, homegrown, out of the cartels of the South West Region of the United States, where the dark occult forces of Carlos Castaneda picked up the merciless thread of the lower Asuric forces, without conscience, with no moral centricity, save the centricity of Evil in the Core of the Earth Mysteries, which we as humanity are now obliged to face. (Example 2 of human demonically possessed human beings).\n\nDevachan Astral Dream Assassin themes\n\n“A few months before Freddy Krueger began stalking the sleep of American teens in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, and almost three decades before Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Joseph Ruben’s Dreamscape used the world of dreams as a battleground. Where A Nightmare on Elm Street subverted the slasher genre and Inception was an inverted heist movie, Dreamscape was a sci-fi thriller in which the very future of the planet was at stake. Very loosely based on a treatment author Roger Zelazny wrote of his novel The Dream Master (1966), Dreamscape touched on an issue very much in people’s minds at the time. With fears of the possibility of nuclear Armageddon at their height, Ruben’s movie posited a scenario in which a trained dream-assassin would murder the president in his sleep, thus killing him in real life and halting his plans to bring nuclear proliferation to a halt.”\n\nThe Big Clock is a precise Cultural and Spiritual Time Piece out of which our own daily lives and our biographies MUST share the time-piece of the stars, for the Big Clock moves 1 degree every 72 years which is the average length of one biographical human life span. Whichever constellation dominates the time of the Spring Equinox, writes the over all outline and tale of humanity into the script of every incarnation during a period of literal time, an approximate period of 2,160 years, which is marked by the laws of Sophia Herself.\n\n“The Earth is not a perfect sphere due to the gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon on the equatorial bulge of the Earth which causes the rotation of the Earth to wobble on its axis like a fast spinning top. This unique motion results in the precession of the equinoxes. Over a period of one year, when the Sun returns to the vernal equinox, it is fifty seconds of arc behind its last position, equal to about one degree of arc every seventy-two years. It completes a retrograde circle of the twelve constellations in approximately 26,000 years. This journey in time is known as the Great Year. A cosmic month is approximately 2160 years, the approximate time it takes for the vernal point to move through one constellation. The constellation through which the vernal point is moving has a strong influence over the age and history of the world.”\n\nEvery human being has several incarnations as either a woman or a man within the giant experiential script of the 2,160 years it takes to write another chapter in the great Divine Book. St. John read this book and all of us, including St. John must live the great Divine Chapters, and write our own poems and progress (or regress) into the script of the great Book. This is something that Novalis was fully aware of.\n\nO Me! O Life!” by Walt Whitman\n\n“Answer.\n\nThat you are here—that life exists and identity,\n\nThat the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.”\n\nSpiritual Science is the School of Novalis and Sophia known as Anthrosophia. The laws of Sophia and the Stars are deeply etched into each and everyone of our own Etheric Bodies be they male or female and Shakespeare accurately recorded how a psychopath thinks as she or he impacts the walls of Time having imploded their incarnations into karmic catastrophe.\n\n“To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n\nLife’s but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage…”\n\nWe once had old upright Grandfather Clocks that had swinging pendulums that were like the visual pulse of time, like an inverted metronome. A pacemaker ticker mirrored our own rapid pulse – against the vast divine pulse of the Great Grand Father clock of the heavens, the Big Ben of the seasons, the 12 months, the 12 hours, and the 12 AGES which bring our incarnations continuously through the vast cultural and spiritual changes we record as human history. We might rather, like Novalis, tend to honor the Great Grand Mother Clock of Sophia. The wise Grand Mother of the Stars, who along with St. John, Novalis and the precise science of Spiritual Science look to the daughter of Sophia growing in the Soul of humanity, named ANTHROSOPHIA. This daughter of Sophia, slowly growing in each human soul, is the birth of the higher intelligence of the human I AM who looks up to the great wisdom of vast Cosmo-Sophia.\n\nSo each of us are very much immersed, engaged and submerged into the character of this, our own, current, Piscean Age. And each of us carry with us like a comets tail, our own personal karmic legacy and karmic history where we have TOUCHED DOWN into incarnation. Along with the 12 AGES on the Great Clock of the Heavens, we also, may NOW, through Spiritual Science and the Novalis School of Michael, focus our attention on the individual Karmic History of each unique I AM.\n\nTime becomes far less abstract and human beings awaken our most heightened spiritual interest when we learn to FISH OUT of the stream of time the intimacies of our unique karmic contributions. When we learn to see how America has a vast Archai Fire Spirit, sub-normal Spirit of Personality three stages above our human development, struggling to bring the grotesque combinations of Archangels, Angels and our individual human ‘I’ developments into a higher consistency, we must gasp. The melting-pot is all jumbled together and mixed with our moral contradictions and the ragged rips in the spiritual and materialistic conditions of The United States of America.\n\nThe United States Archai Spirit, once an Archangel of the Egyptian People, incomplete, unfinished, imprisoned occultly in the Fiery Furnace in the core of our Earth, has come forth as the significantly challenged guiding Fire Spirit of America. Those primal planetary Fire Beings that first forged the first appearance of our human I AM, arose from the ancient Saturn Evolution. The vast American Archai, our stunted, unfinished Super Power, now struggles to atone for Egypt and attain the mission of humanity, and the Earth Herself, which is Love.\n\nEnormous planet forces locked in the Sixth Layer of the Inner Earth (click Link) had imprisoned this Egyptian Archangel Being, and only through the birth out of the Fiery Core has this Archangel graduated to become the tormented, incomplete Archai of America Herself.\n\n“These layers represents even earlier stages of planetary evolution (Old Saturn) and contains retarded powers from still higher hierarchies (archai or spirits of personality / time spirits).”\n\nTo peer into the core of a fiery Spirit of Personality, a planetary force of Being that now is wedded to the destiny of the American Soul, makes us gasp. All the deepest, darkest mysteries of human evolution, where Cain murdered his brother Abel, where Set overthrew Osiris now torment the unfolding super-power of this young unformed, abnormal Archai, which we call America.\n\nOsiris “…left Isis to rule Egypt when he decided to spread his rule around the world. He returned only after civilizing the entire earth. He found that Isis ruled wisely and his kingdom was still in perfect order. However, it was at this point that his brother, Set, began plotting against him. There are many stories of how Osiris was killed. The most common is that Set held an extravagant banquet and invited Osiris. After the festivities were over, Set produced a magnificent coffin and offered it as a gift to whomever it fitted best. Of course, it had been built for Osiris’s form and when he got in it, Set shut the lid and threw it in the Nile river.\n\n“Set took Osiris’s place as king while the grieving Isis searched for Osiris’s remains. She found the body in a far away place called Byblos, brought it back to Egypt, and hid it in the marsh. Set found it, unfortunately, and tore the body in pieces, throwing them again into the river. Isis collected all the pieces except the genitals, which had been eaten by fish.”\n\nA little later we shall come upon the tale of “Moby Dick” and reconnect to the prophet Elijah. We can hardly imagine, provided we haven’t had training in the Science of Imagination, that hiding the Egyptian tale of Osiris in the unfathomable depths of our American Unconscious, is really an ART form that schools human intuition, vividly, under the School of Novalis and John the Baptist. Before Darwin even got his research upside down and backwards to the Evolution of Humanity, Melville had already fathomed, charted and mapped the unconscious regions where Osiris and Egypt survived in the sperm and genitals of the Age of the Fishes. Melville was already there in the Science of Novalis and the Michael School.\n\n“Cetology” reminds the reader that Melville came before Darwin\n\n“There are a lot of different whales. The biggest is the sperm whale. Sperm whales are not only big, but dangerous. They are commercially valuable because they have the best oil and some white waxy crap in their brains called spermaceti that gets used in all sorts of ointments and cosmetics. Moby Dick is a sperm whale.”\n\nBut how does an Archangel get the awkward promotion to the rank of abnormal, stunted Archai over the vast regions of the Geographic United States of America? There are three things we might hold fast in our consciousness. One – an interesting overlay of Spirit and Geography that places the central river of the Nile (that flowed NORTH with etheric arterial potent spirituality) and the central river of Mark Twain’s Mississippi, (which flows SOUTH) as a kind of etheric central artery. A giant geographic over laid memory system in America that resembles, in part, the kind of central mystery of Egypt and the big bad Nile River that the ancient Egyptians considered their core cultural mystery. “Sirius was a very important star to the ancient Egyptians, who called it the Star of Isis or the Nile Star. About 5,000 years ago, the helical rising of Sirius occurred earlier, around June 25.” Two – comparing the failed, crude and materialistic cosmology and striving for star wisdom of the United States, compared to – the powerful Devachan vision, mapping the journey of souls after death into the stars, with the magnificent and beneficent wisdom and blessing of Nut, who represented the vast Mothering forces of the starry Cosmos, and the cultural support to the ancient Isis Mysteries. To which, today, the Sophia Mysteries of the School of Novalis have been slowly rising again from the far West to take the place of the ancient Isis Mysteries of Egypt. Three – That the Archangel’s regeneration and resurrection to Fire Spirit, abnormal Archai, and stunted Spirit of Form, lay in the mystery of THE FISHES, Pisces and the rise of the vast American continent in the age of the Fishes, in the Far West.\n\nMark Twain rode the American Folk Soul, reflected the American Folk substance, the way Egyptians might have used the Nile for commerce, gambling and riverboat escapades. The untapped shadow, the double, the region that was awakened with the discovery of America brought the active concrete SHADOW into real time. The rise of the former Egyptian age did not have to deal with consequences, the conscious consequences of our human SHADOWS. The current struggle of the abnormal, stunted Archai that sends it’s vast tentacles through the entire population of the United States, must now deal with the stunted shadow that was left undealt with in Egypt.\n\nThe American Doppelganger\n\n“For a long time before the beginning of the development of the fifth post-Atlantean epoch. Europe had to be protected from the influence of the Western world. This is the significant historical arrangement that was cultivated by wisdom-filled world powers. Europe had to be protected for a long time from all these influences; and it could not have been protected if the European world had not been completely shut off from America in the centuries before the fifteenth century.”\n\nThe discovery of America in the Age of Pisces, the Fifth Age, awaited the dawning of THE CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL. The discovery of America, where the mystery of the Shadow and the human doppelganger had now to become fully conscious also required the Archangel of the Egyptian people to face the consequences and occult powers that are the real forces of the Moral Developments that both humanity and Gods must live with.\n\n“In the depths of human souls, the Double acquires ever greater power over the unconscious life of human will, binding souls with powers that derive entirely from the earth itself— rigidifying forces of mechanization and subnature (especially gravity, electricity, and magnetism). Indeed, Steiner stated that in America those sub-earthly magnetic forces that connect the human being more closely with the Double rise up most strongly. These forces are connected with the fact that on the American continents, most of the mountain ranges run in a north-south direction.“\n\nA promotion and a new assignment that placed the Moral Maturity of the American People in the service of an abnormal Fire Archai, Spirit of Personality, was now required payment for the Egyptian Age. A Super-Power would either grow into a mighty nation of black magicians by the 7th Age, THE AGE OF AMERICA or the souls of the human beings of the United States would break through to a New Cosmology, a New Christology, a New Cosmogony and grow inwardly to become Sophia’s Wedding Guests, dressed in White Garments and purified with clear Etheric Goodness, wrought from moral courage and conscious spiritual development.\n\nI give you a riddle. We shall solve this riddle together ‘we shall meet this tormented abnormal Archai and premature Spirit of Form through the birth of Manhattan’. I’ll give you a clue, this is not a cliché. This is not a trite or overused expression or idea. It is a fact that requires the occult mystery of Language and the Word. It is also a fact that the decadence of the Egyptian Age has carried a huge cultural price tag that The United States of America must pay for the karma of the decadent Egyptian Age. It is the mystery of the WORD on which all things rest. Final Sticker Shock of the human cost we shall pay makes us gasp. If we knew that the crowning culmination of the final gasps of Earth Evolution ends with the epitaph and epistle of the Apocalypse pointing to THE AMERICAN AGE, we would quiver with caution as to what we are planting as deeds into the final phases of this the Piscean Age.\n\nWe must gasp, for we may compare our own American Fire Spirit to the Archai of the Sun, Michael, and the Michael School parameters of higher human spiritual development against the background of the jagged, juggling of the vast continent and Beings that are the collective we all understand as the American Soul. We shall introduce ourselves to this mighty sub-normal Archai, forged as a Fire Spirit from the very primal beginnings of the creation of humanity, who must carry the occult damage of the once grand mystery of the Egyptian Age.\n\nWe will learn to understand the geographic regions of the United States that are colored by literal Archangel Beings, two stages above humanity. These Archangel Beings give the different regional Speech dialects, colloquial modulations and accents the flavors and pulse of the very Soul of the different Geographic Regions of the United States. We can clearly zero in on Etheric Identity markers in the use of vowels and consonants, gestures, styles of dress, mannerisms of different Archangel Regions. These mannerisms, gestures and Speech Patterns arise organically and naturally from the etheric body of the different regions and are woven into the etheric body and astral nuances of persons influenced and associated with those regions. It is within immediate hearing of any voice or group of voices that we can identify strong Archangelic, Geographic and etheric influences that have formed the roots, character and souls of specific groups and colored the expressions of individuals.\n\nAs an example we can take the film”Fargo” itself and how it represents a slice of such an Archangelic Regioinal Soul flavor and behavior experience which Rod Serling correctly designated as what “lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge.” It is how the School of Spiritual Science can define the middle ground where, naive and warm hearted, the American Soul of humanity dwells on the threshold between the depths of evil and the heights of wisdom.\n\nThe American Heartland is a repository, was a repository for the once easy to define Good. The occult vision of the Heartland was captured concretely HERE – (CLICK LINK). This was the Initiation we are all undergoing at the THRESHOLD. (Study this short clip carefully CLICK LINK) This was the nature of our dwelling place in America and is known in the Novalis School as the region of THE CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL.\n\nFrank Capra and the CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL\n\nThe name “Capra”, notes Capra’s biographer Joseph McBride, represents his family’s closeness to the land, and means “she-goat”.[4] He notes that the English word “capricious” derives from it…”\n\nAmerican Age – Sea-Goat, Capricorn 5733 – 7893 AD\n\nAlthough It’s a Wonderful Life is his best-known film, Friedman notes that it was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) which most represented the “Capra myth.” That film expressed Capra’s patriotism more than any others, and “presented the individual working within the democratic system to overcome rampant political corruption.”[2]\n\nThe film, however, became Capra’s most controversial. In his research before filming, he was able to stand close to President Roosevelt during a press conference after the recent acts of war by Germany in Europe. Capra recalls his fears:\n\nAnd panic hit me. Japan was slicing up the colossus of China piece by piece. Nazi panzers had rolled into Austria and Czechoslovakia; their thunder echoed over Europe. England and France shuddered. The Russian bear growled ominously in the Kremlin. The black cloud of war hung over the chancelleries of the world. Official Washington from the President down, was in the process of making hard, torturing decisions. “And here was I, in the process of making a satire about government officials; … Wasn’t this the most untimely time for me to make a film about Washington?”[17]\n\nWhen the filming was completed, the studio sent preview copies to Washington. Joseph P. Kennedy, U.S. ambassador to the UK, wrote to Columbia head Harry Cohn, “Please do not play this picture in Europe.”[2] Politicians were concerned about the potential negative impact the film might have on the morale of our allies, as World War II had begun. Kennedy wrote to president Roosevelt that “in foreign countries this film must inevitably strengthen the mistaken impression that the United States is full of graft, corruption and lawlessness.”[18] Many studio heads agreed nor did they want negative feelings about Hollywood to be instilled in political leaders.[19]\n\nNonetheless, Capra’s vision of the film’s significance was clear:\n\nThe more uncertain are the people of the world, the more their hard-won freedoms are scattered and lost in the winds of chance, the more they need a ringing statement of America’s democratic ideals. The soul of our film would be anchored in Lincoln. Our Jefferson Smith would be a young Abe Lincoln, tailored to the rail-splitter’s simplicity, compassion, ideals, humor, and unswerving moral courage under pressure.[20]\n\nCapra pleaded with Cohn to allow the film to go into distribution and remembers the intensity of their decision making:\n\nHarry Cohn paced the floor, as stunned as Abraham must have been when the Lord asked him to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac.[21]\n\nCohn and Capra chose to ignore the negative publicity and demands, and released the film as planned. It was later nominated for 11 Academy Awards, only winning one (for Best Original Story) partly because of the number of major pictures that were nominated that year, including The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind.[13] Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons called it a “smash patriotic hit” and most critics agreed, seeing that audiences left the theaters with “an enthusiasm for democracy” and “in a glow of patriotism.”[18]\n\nThe significance of the film’s message was established further in France, shortly after World War II began. When the French public were asked to select which film they wanted to see most, having been told by the Vichy government that soon no more American films would be allowed in France, the overwhelming majority chose it over all others. To a France, soon to be invaded and occupied by Nazi forces, the film most expressed the “perseverance of democracy and the American way.”[2]\n\nOur humanity is set to be challenged from now on, into the future times, with coming to meet in ourselves and in our individual karma the Monsters of the American Psyche. If the Heartland is to survive Ahriman’s crushing consolidations and advanced genetic, psychic and pharmaceutical modifications that will be imposed as humanity, all humanity are herded toward “The Singularity”(Click Link IF you wish to walk richly through Noam Chomsky’s POV it is lengthy and rich), of the merging of our psychic and social melding of technology with our Astral, and Etheric and even the corruption of our ‘I’, the Heartland must find the courage to gain insight into the wisdom and vision of THE CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL.\n\nGarrison Keillor, planted firmly in the Geographic Heartland represents what we once called the GOOD. The Good, which the Shepherds heard the Angels Sing to MEN OF GOOD WILL and which inspired Frank Capra, also is and was invested in Keillor’s spirit. We find in the same region of Fargo North Dakota and under the same Archangelic Region, that Garrison Keillor, as one of the many Initiates of the Heartland, we find the literal geographic region of the Prairie States, known to United States audiences as “A Prairie Home Companion”.\n\nIn terms of the American Soul substance we can find the complete fictional opposite of Garrison Keillor in the brilliant American Soul and psyche explorations of Stephen King. The geographic region of the Prairie States, have a particular regional accent and character that is very, very different than the Archangelic region of the American South West. We can see this clearly and it is indisputable in terms of understanding the Etheric Character of the different geographic regions of the United States.\n\n“Lake Wobegon” are the episodic chapters of the limited and naive central mystery of watered down Lutheran American Goodness who remain too shy, too backward, and too misinformed to come to terms with the sub-normal Archai, Fire Spirit of Personality, that dominates the foundations of the American Psyche. Stephen King sometimes comes much closer in his sketches and writings than anything imagined in “Lake Wobegon”.\n\nWatered down goodness alone cannot appreciate the human wholeness that radiates from Michael the Archai and Time Spirit of our Age who stands firmly next to the Risen Etheric Christ Being. These Powers and Beings scare the timid, shy and cowardly Christian into shrinking into the shadows cast by the rigid traditions of goodness.\n\n“In earlier times it was sufficient to speak to people about the super-sensible world in the way in which the religious faiths (click link) still want to speak. Today this will no longer do. Today people often get themselves into difficulties precisely because they wish to promote eternal bliss in an egoistic way through the religious faiths.”\n\nAnd we need vast human pockets of new erupting and conscious goodness, arising all through the Heart of America. We need our Goodness raised gradually to the heights of spiritual courage and THE CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL. We need Lake Wobegon and Stephen King and the Schooling of Novalis and Spiritual Science to penetrate the vast dark mysteries of America.\n\nThese Monsters of the American Psyche that we can identify clearly, erupt from the unrecognized shadow and black hole in the central core of the human ‘I’. The human being, as an immortal participant in the unfolding of Divine Evolution, as a member of THE TENTH HIERARCHY, one level below the Angel Kingdom, we are required to monitor, contain and confront our shadows.\n\nAs Rod Serling, Rudolf Steiner, Novalis, Goethe, St. John and Nietzsche demanded, we are destined to encounter and study everything that lies at the pit of humanities fears, to the height of humanities wisdom. This is indeed the region of THE CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL that must be explored and encountered NOW. The Consciousness Soul is our overall lesson plan, that meets every human being over the face of the Earth who are incarnated now under the vast zodiacal time frame of THE FISHES.\n\nRudolf Steiner\n\nAnthroposophical Leading Thoughts\n\n“184. This makes it urgent for man to find in conscious experience a knowledge of the Spirit, wherein he will rise as high above Nature as in his sub-natural technical activities he sinks beneath her. He will thus create within him the inner strength not to go under.”\n\n“…the possibility of finding a true relationship to the Ahrimanic civilization has escaped man. He must find the strength, the inner force of knowledge, in order not to be overcome by Ahriman in this technical civilization. He must understand Sub-Nature for what it really is. This he can only do if he rises, in spiritual knowledge, at least as far into extra-earthly Super-Nature as he has descended, in technical Sciences, into Sub-Nature. The age requires a knowledge transcending Nature, because in its inner life it must come to grips with a life-content which has sunk far beneath Nature — a life-content whose influence is perilous. Needless to say, there can be no question here of advocating a return to earlier states of civilization. The point is that man shall find the way to bring the conditions of modern civilization into their true relationship-to himself and to the Cosmos.”\n\nThe pit of humanities fears and the Monsters from the depths of the American Psyche are running renegade operations, torture centers, Rendition Schools over the globe, where impure Asuric and Sorathian Evil schools train souls to embrace the region where the Monsters of the American Psyche and the Global Psyche dwell. But the United States is a festering breeding ground for the incubation of these global monsters.\n\nThis devastation that we must face as we penetrate deeper and deeper into the psychic structure of humanity requires, mandates the School of Spiritual Science, to midwife our human spiritual development through and over the Threshold where actual Powers, and Beings dwell side by side with humanity.\n\nIt is strictly because our universities, our education, our religious naivety, our psychology have all failed miserably to advance towards the challenge that Novalis, Goethe, Rudolf Steiner, St. John and Rod Serling presented us with, that we find ourselves on a real journey to the HEART OF DARKNESS.\n\nArt and Imagination, the Risen Etheric Christ and Michael, have stood steadfastly beside humanity. Novalis presented the Science of the Poet with the richness of a Painter and the accuracy and vision of a Prophet to the treasures of Spiritual Science. The Fifth Age, The Sixth Age and the Seventh Age will bring to a culmination vast impulses that lay submerged, awaiting the dawning of our CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL.\n\nWe as humanity are required to plunge into the depths of the Divine Workshop in the deep dark cellars where the ancient Gods dwell in order to follow the path of the Christ Being. Our human education on Earth, bar none, no one is excluded, is to learn to see into the workings of the hierarchies of the heights to balance our plunge into the depths. Our moral integrity must rise to the challenge of holding our higher humanity intact through the next three Ages ahead and it must start now in The Fifth Age, the Age of Pisces.\n\nThe Descent of the Human Spirit into the Heart of Darkness (click link)\n\nIn the film, shortly before Colonel Kurtz dies, he recites part of T. S. Eliot‘s poem “The Hollow Men“. Not only is Kurtz in the novel characterized as “hollow at the core”, the poem is preceded in printed editions by the epigraph “Mistah Kurtz – he dead”, a quotation from Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.\n\nIn addition, two books seen opened on Kurtz’s desk in the film are From Ritual to Romance by Jessie Weston and The Golden Bough by Sir James Frazer, the two books that Eliot cited as the chief sources and inspiration for his poem “The Waste Land“. Eliot’s original epigraph for “The Waste Land” was this passage from Heart of Darkness, which ends with Kurtz’s final words:[12]\n\nDid he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision, – he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath –\n\n“The horror! The horror!”\n\nColonel Kurtz is based on the character of a nineteenth-century ivory trader, also called Kurtz, from the novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.\n\nBriefly let us cast our eye over the great State of Missouri. At least three major incarnations of three distinct individuals who give three spiritual points of view (POV) of the I AM and the Consciousness Soul of America arise from the geographic region in the United States, known to us as Missouri.\n\n“I see the path of progress for modern man in his occupation with his own self, with his inner being, as indicated by Rudolf Steiner.” T.S. Eliot\n\n(Dec. 26th, 1959, in the context of contrasting Goethe’s scientific consciousness and that employed in atomic research. An extract from a longer quotation cited in: Colin Wilson. “Beyond the Occult,” Caxton Editions: London, 2002 (pg. 335f.)\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot OM (Sep. 26th, 1888–Jan. 4th, 1965) was an essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic and “one of the twentieth century’s major poets.” [1] Born in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States, he moved to the United Kingdom in 1914 (at age 25) and was naturalized as a British subject in 1927 at age 39.\n\nT.S. Eliot, Mark Twain and Harry Truman, all out of Missouri, set the stage for the Asuric, Ahrimanic and Sorathian Monsters of the American Psyche to rise up out of the depths of our Consciousness Soul and confront us all with their unrecognized horror. It only becomes the science of literature and part of the science of humanity when we become conscious of the shadows in the depths of our Consciousness Soul.\n\nT.S. Eliot in his “The Hollow Men“ reveal the true Black Hole in the psyche where the I AM and Consciousness Soul dwell. Eliot reveals the pathways by which the Asuras gain entrance and slowly begin devouring the rich center of the immortal I AM buried deep in the uncharted regions of our Consciousness Soul.\n\nMark Twain in his “Mysterious Stranger” (CLICK LINK), long before the Rolling Stones drew their prophetic and powerful “Sympathy for the Devil” into a portrait of Ahriman, (not Lucifer), Twain had captured the rising Ahrimanic shadow Being. It was the Ahrimanic Beings in each of us that were fore-shadowed by Missouri born Mark Twain in his Consciousness Soul gift to the United States, “The Mysterious Stranger”(Click Link). Here the pedigree of Ahriman/Mephistopheles and the true shadow of the American Psyche, a mini-potent portrait raised it’s icy features before our eyes. Goethe’s “Faust”, and “The Mysterious Stranger”(click link) by Twain managed to isolate for our astute study the ancient adversary of Divine Intelligence, Ahriman.\n\nThis monster of “The Singularity” (Intense Research CLICK LINK) of the merging of the Divine forces of the Psyche of Humanity with computerized intelligence is aimed at strangling and suffocating the higher potential of human spiritual development in the tangled knots of Ahrimanic, icy efficiency.\n\nRudolf Steiner’s statue where Ahriman and Christ are depicted, along with Lucifer, reveal that Ahrimanic forces claw, clutch and grab at human intelligence like a demonic feeding frenzy, that ties humanity, and humanities Spiritual and Soul forces into binding technological, computerized, chains, knots, and the pornography of psychic torture and spiritual dominatrix humiliation. Unconscious desires for the enslavement of our human spirits and massive Bondage cravings and hungers are being driven by Ahriman and the Asuras.\n\nIn the carved statue of “The Representative of Humanity” we see Ahriman below the Christ Being, tied in knots. But Ahriman in the West and in all Western university education has been breaking through the shimmering surface ripples of human intelligence, stirring beneath the waters of The Age of Pisces and creating pornographic, erotic, cravings to be bound, imprisoned, and repeatedly tortured. Why? Because “The Singularity” that merges the human psyche with fallen Devachan Technology, will enchain, enmesh and infect the psyche of humanity with such overwhelming enhancements of refined evil, that the future Spiritual Unfolding of every human spirit will be sucked under into Ahriman’s dominating sphere of imprisoning human freedom, human intelligence, human compassion and human love within a web of coldly efficient spidery venom that will suck out, numb and eviscerate all higher human spiritual potential. (Which leads over to Part 2 of the Destiny and Future of the Age of America)\n\nWhile T.S. Eliot described the state of human “Hollow Men” where the Consciousness Soul in us, women and men, had just begun to rise into the unmapped and uncharted region of the Devachan, we became vividly aware of what ‘I’-less human beings are like. Ahriman longs to fill that vacuum of SELF with sterile, icy intelligence. And they have!!!\n\nThe Asuras, who take pleasure in sadistic pain, torture and Bondage, wish to expedite the complete extinguishing of the I AM, after they have infected and parasitically fed off the I Am, turn over and offer the juicy immortal and poisoned I AM as food for the chromosome and matter corrupting anti-Sun, Sorathian Beings. The Sorathian Beings, the demonic shadow of the all embracing, life giving Sun, command the three different categories of sub-sensible beings. The Sorathian category and contingency of beings dwelling in the depths of the American Psyche, slime and slither in the immortal corruption and wreckage of the I AM. These awful beings of “horror-horror” that are the heart of darkness, directly oppose the aims of the Risen Etheric Christ Being.\n\nThe World Abyss of the I and the Horror of Hollowness\n\n“Christ submerged into the personality of Jesus; Jesus, borne aloft by the Christ force, became Jesus Christ. The Doctor pointed to the cross of two-fold suffering, to the agonies in both relations: Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus. Before ‘its union with the Logos, the personality of Jesus experienced the black-hole of the world within the center of his “I,” his ego; the world abyss of the I, a concept commensurate with that of the Copernican universe. Jesus prior to the baptism — an “It,” . over which the Ahriman-emptied universe is torn asunder. So — under the double cross of “Jesus Christ” — while the “Christ,” Who in freedom had left the realm of spirit-light in order to be drawn into the narrow hole of personality, had to endure the horror and pain of an incomparable constriction, beside which any form of insanity would be — a nothing. He had to endure this torture so as to become “Christ Jesus,” so that He could live within Jesus.” Reminiscences of Rudolf Steiner by Andrei Belyi\n\nPresident Harry Truman from Missouri and Oppenheimer plunged the United States and the globe into the Sorathian genetic corruption of literally poisoning matter. Chromosome and cellular matter, Life, Etheric Life and The Living Bread of Life, (click link) Life Spirit forces in matter, where the Sun Being and the Resurrected Christ could transubstantiate divine forces through matter, were breached. Light was raped and holy mater, matter and Light itself, was corrupted by an Anti-Grail technological assault team and hit squad.\n\nTrue Assassins of the Sun were deployed to the South West Region of the United States with the gruesome task to rip open the gateway to lower Sorathian forces. Sorathian forces that oppose the gift of the Risen Etheric Christ Sun Being. Christ, who had through Golgotha, resurrected Fallen Matter to renewed etheric Life now had to contend with multitudes of domed cathedrals and nuclear reactors over the face of the Earth, and those that worshiped the destruction of matter, Light and Love.\n\nThe Novalis School of Schöne Wissenschaften\n\nRudolf Steiner, Novalis, Goethe, the Transcendentalists (including Hawthorne, Longfellow, Melville, Emerson, Thoreau) and the Inklings (that including Owen Barfield, Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams), poets, songwriters and explorers of the new realm of the Consciousness Soul were all gathered under the spirit of Novalis. Rudolf Steiner and the Michael School has invited all our artists, writers, poets to – (including the Christ/Lucifer Woodstock generation) to – (Steiner) “…-what in France is called ‘belles-lettres.’ I don’t know whether the expression is still used. No? What a pity! In Germany they spoke of ‘Schöne Wissenschaften’ up to the nineteenth century, and then the term lapsed. The ‘beautiful sciences’, sciences which brought beauty into human knowledge, aesthetics, art.” R.S.\n\nThree Missourians that are included in the dawning science of the CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL AGE and all linked together through the illustrious state of Missouri brought to us preliminary and devastating insights into the work of Ahriman, the work of the Asuras and the first rift of the influx and tidal waves of Sorathian light devouring monsters.\n\nSpeech and the imprint in the etheric body of Instant Etheric Geographic Identification\n\n“Which spiritual beings are especially active in America, and what is their nature? It is important to remember that, wherever an individuality incarnates on Earth, whether he/she is born in that location or moves there, two factors play an important role. One factor concerns the etheric geography of that location; the second factor is centered upon the mystery of the Double.”\n\nOur Angels have placed us in Northern Regions where specific Archangelic influences color the character, SPEECH (Click Link etheric visible coloring of Archangel substance) and living etheric substance of our human soul. Our Angels have placed us in South Western regions of The United States where specific regional Archangelic influences color the character, speech and living etheric substance of our human souls. Our Angels have placed us in the North East, The East, the South East, The Deep South, where specific Archangelic influences have colored our character, our SPEECH (Click Link regional Etheric soul colorings) and the living etheric substances that flow through our souls. Our Angels have placed us in the West, the North West, Alaska, Hawaii, and the desert West where specific Archangelic influences color the character, speech and living etheric substances of our human souls.\n\nBehind each of you stands his Angel,\n\nSoftly laying his hands on your head.\n\nThis Angel gives you the strength that you need.\n\nAbove your heads sweeps the circle of the Archangels.\n\nThey carry from one to the other what each has to give to the other.\n\nThey unite their souls, thereby you get the courage you need.\n\nIn the movements they make as they weave from one to the other\n\nThey form a chalice.\n\nThe light of wisdom is given us by the sublime beings of the Archai.\n\nThey do not clothe themselves into a circle\n\nBut coming from eternal beginnings, manifest themselves\n\nAnd vanish again into the eternal distances.\n\nThey reach this space only in the form of a drop of light\n\nWhich fills for a moment the chalice\n\nFormed by the movement of the Archangels.\n\n(The Founding Verse of the First Waldorf School in Stuttgart (1919) by Rudolf Steiner)\n\nWe carry the karma of America around with us to all parts of the world. The future of our humanity and the future of the world, all hang in the balance of how we penetrate with our Spirits and our Consciousness Soul down to the heart of our darkness. The character and conditions of our incarnations will be shaped by the Goodness, Greatness and Courage we create from now until the 7th Age, when the culmination of THE AGE OF AMERICA completes itself.\n\nThe vernal point where the Sun “crosses” the Earth’s equator gradually cycles through the constellations. Taking 25,920 years to complete each cycle taking approximately 2,160 years to pass through each Sign. Our Earth’s “wobble” was known to the ancients, who divided the Great Year into twelve Ages or aeons, each of approximately 2,160 years in length. Thus we get the Age of Aries, the Age of Pisces, the Age of Aquarius, the Age of Capricorn.\n\nCurrently the Age of Pisces is the coloring and water we are drenched in, soaked in, swimming in. It is the mandatory learning, without exception, for every single human being incarnated in this, the Fifth Age. Everyone into the pool. At every university, with every earned degree we are boxed in, immersed and drowned in the pool of massive materialistic indoctrination. Vast systems and fragments of, Intellectual lack of cohesion, have opened the gates for immoral, isolated, special branches of specialized concentrated, one sided, career opportunities, severed from the whole integrated map of the Cosmos and severed from the moral roots of origins that WE the Tenth Hierarchy, carry.\n\nWe have failed to guide, map and outline the terrain, even if we have attempted in our explorations to map the bottom of all of the vast oceans, their deep trenches, and locate the lost ships, like the Titanic in its deep grave. The map of our human Genome; Our maps, photos, studies of the heavens, including the arch priest of materialism sitting in Newton’s chair of science, Stephen Hawking; Our maps of Black Holes and the Big Bang of the Starry Heavens; Our maps of the Atomic Table and our fall into Nuclear Nightmare with Oppenheimer and President Harry Truman; Our maps of the Periodic Table of the Elements and how whole family and karmic groups become literal fallen Black Hole systems as in “Breaking Bad” and how karmic destruction works when in search for the perfect astral blue Meth.\n\nThink of the Pharmaceutical black magic industries that create drugs that invade the astral body, cripple it, addict it, poison it, and become part of our vast Multi-National Corporate Conglomeration that serves the Whore of Babylon enterprises of DuPont, Monsanto Inc and the global plague of unnatural genetically modified seeds.These are all maps, studies and vast human collaborations amassing immense contributions to the over all system of knowledge known as the working system of the spiritual faculty of the un-mapped region of our Consciousness Soul. Otherwise intimated by Rod Serling as his very own explorations of the TWILIGHT ZONE in service of the American psyche.\n\nHowever the map of the terrain of the moral and spiritual journey and soul-scape of the Soul and Spirit of America, the United States, is as vitally important and precise as were the expeditions of Lewis and Clark.\n\n“We are only seeing the surface of things, for the most part. Behind the scenes, vast forces are jockeying for position and behind those forces is something even more vast and incomprehensible. Given the enormous reach of time that stretches from end to bending end, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the conditioned minds, of those engaged in the processes, to grasp what the meaning of it is.” Les Visible\n\nWe are set to chart an outline that leads us through the Giant Clock, all the way to the 7th Age, where Capricorn will rise in the Spring and the Age of America will have come to fulfillment. The Age of America will have come to fulfillment by what we have planted in the soil of Science, technology, genetics and the advanced development of human spirituality in this the Fifth Age.\n\nRudolf Steiner\n\nAmerica and the Science of Cosmogony\n\n“Anglo-American civilization is conquering the world. But, in conquering the world, it will need to absorb what the conquered parts of the world have to give — the impulse to Freedom, the impulse to Altruism; for in itself it has only the impulse to Cosmogony. Indeed, Anglo-American civilization owes its success to a Cosmogonic Impulse. It owes it to the circumstance, that people are able to think in world-thoughts.\n\n“These are the three things which are acting within our civilization as forces of decline and fall: — Lack of a cosmogony, lack of a sound foundation of freedom, lack of an altruistic sense. But without a cosmogony, do you see, there is no real science, or system of knowledge. Then there is no real knowledge — then all knowledge ultimately becomes a mere game, in which the worlds and the civilizations of man are toys.”\n\nOur American failure to awaken in our universities a solid science of cosmogony, cosmology or embryology is spiritually catastrophic to the Mission of America and the goal of The Age of America. Our grotesque, ham-handed loping along, never asking, never showing interest, or never feeling connected to the science of the cycles of Time has stagnated and choked the entire progress of humanity.\n\nDumbfounded, we arrogantly don’t care that in the previous age of the Ram, when the Spring Constellation rose in the hard horned skull of the Ram and Christ was crucified on the hill of the skull, and it was the Age of the quest for the Golden Fleece, we were never taught to reorder our thinking into the science of the vast perspectives of Living Time. We hardly gave Michelangelo (see link) the credit\n\nof defining Moses with Rams Horns because of the culmination of the constellation of Ram rising in the Spring.\n\nWe didn’t mark it on our calenders and look to the sky and the Spring Constellation of the Ram and marvel to ourselves that the culminating mystery of the age of the Ram, out of the Constellation of Aries, was that the Lamb of God was crucified on the hill of skulls, on Golgotha. It never entered our common education that the achievement of THE GOLDEN FLEECE was the perfect Incarnation Science of Jesus (Click Link) that brought about the Earthly gift of the Golden Sun Drenched Risen Etheric Christ. The age of the Ram brought the achievement of Golden gift of Spirit-Man, Atma, the Risen Etheric Christ, into our own human Earth evolution.\n\nThe Egyptian Age arose when the Spring Equinox rose in the constellation of Taurus. Language Arts, the Devachan where the Egyptian Sciences tracked the journey of Pharaohs after their deaths were part of the details of the Egyptian Age.\n\nThe Egyptians literally supplied the IMAGE and physical reality of a Barge, a Boat to be used as a vessel and vehicle for the dead to journey their way back into the stars. The hieroglyphic picture arts of the Devachan, the foundations of language and the vivid links that connect our FIFTH AGE OF PISCES to the Egyptian THIRD AGE are laced in the language of Images and Imaginations moving in the fluidity of our infatuation with film and cinema and the location of Hollywood on the powerful, shifting-fluidity, of the fault lines and fissures of the West Coast of The United States.\n\nThe projected vast imagination from the Egyptian Age reveals a Pyramid Scheme of power that was once a great divine mystery in Egypt, which has become today in this our Fifth Age, merely the Corporate Common Denominator of every materialistic multi-national dynastic empire whose CEO and President merely reign over Pyramid Schemed Empires across the globe. This Pyramid scheme has surfaced from the ghosts of ancient Egypt. Our Pyramid schemes have been stripped of Egypt’s profound understanding of the journey our souls take after death, back into the world of the Stars.\n\n“A pharaoh is a supreme ancient Egyptian ruler. Pharaohism follows the same principles of totalitarianism, where the sole ruler has absolute power and control. Henry Ford also, according to J.P. Morgan, “resembled Seti I, the father of the great Ramses and the best-preserved mummy to have been unearthed from the necropolis of Thebes in the Valley of the Kings (Doctorow 143).”\n\nWe do not reveal in our universities and our educational history that when the Sun Rose in the Spring under the sign of Taurus, when the clock of the Stars and the incarnation lessons of Babylon,Summaria, Egypt and the deep journey of language that was crafted from the STARS, the foundations of the WORD (click Link) were, during the Egyptian era when the Sun Rose in the Spring under the Sign of Taurus, it was the Time of learning the Devachan Mysteries of THE WORD.\n\nIn this our Fifth Age, Osiris genitals, procreative cosmic forces devoured by The Fishes, have arisen under the Super-Power we fondly call The United States of America. Deadly, occult, Egyptian karma of Archangels and Archai run undercurrent, like the Great White Whale swimming deeply under our current Piscean AGE.\n\nHow the coffin and the mystery of the sarcophagus, the mystery of how the ancient Egyptian culture explored the hidden and veiled secrets of the Devachan and Life after death, now swirl under the surface of our unfathomed collective group soul of our own collective American unconsciousness .\n\nThe dark brother to Osiris, Set, dominates the cosmology of the United States and the western science of the stars. Immortality and life after death are choked to death in their cribs and still born in the medical sciences of the United States of America. Monstrous falsity is taught at every university. The living reality of how humanity and the stars are integrated in our pre-embryological developments (click link) are suffocated and strangled so that they do not awaken in our Consciousness Soul.\n\nAbsolute Ahrimanic lies and distortions are trumpeted far and wide as Set/Ahrimanic dogmas of doomed and darkened materialism. The only way you will ever get a degree or diploma out of United States Universities, is to surrender to the immense avalanche of propaganda and extortion that materialism has placed as a price-tag for achieving spiritual decapitation. We are surrounded by vast occult Perilous Pyramid Schemes, swirling like ancient Egyptian ghosts and devachan demons in the subconscious of the American Psyche clearly hidden in plain sight.\n\n“Henry Ford pays a lunch visit to J.P. Morgan in his elegant home on Madison Avenue. They tour the library, and sit in front of the fire. Ford makes an anti- Semitic comment. They begin discussing Ford’s assembly line principles, and soon their conversation shifts to the subject of religion. J.P. Morgan asks Ford about his religious beliefs, but Ford hesitates to answer. Morgan gives Ford a tour of his collection of ancient Egyptian and Greek artifacts, expressing his belief that science has been a “devilish conspiracy to destroy our apprehension of reality.” Morgan invites Ford to join him on a trip to Egypt. Although the idea of reincarnation fascinates Ford, he only has interest in it to the extent that he feels it explains his genius; he assumes he has lived more times than others, and thus has the engineering know-how which has brought him such success. Ford declines the invitation to the trip, but Morgan will go alone anyway. However, after their discussion about Egypt and reincarnation, they found “the most secret and exclusive club in America, The Pyramid, of which they were the only members.”\n\nCall me Ishmael is the Piscean Age Parsifal that all of us in the Piscean Age are required to emulate. (CLICK LINK) It was Ishmael floating on the coffin from the unresolved mysteries of the Egyptian Age of the Sarcophagus of Osiris that set the tone and terror that currently grips our Fifth Age and will terrorize our Sixth Age and come to devastating fruition in the Seventh Age.\n\n“Queegqueg, one of the harpooners, suddenly decides he is going to die and has a coffin made which he decorates with carvings based on his own extensively tattooed body. When the ship sinks, this still-unused coffin floats to the surface enabling the only survivor, Ishmael, to remain afloat until rescued by the ship which is just coming into view on the horizon.”\n\nIt is our un-awakened Consciousness Soul that must learn to read the star maps written in the language of our Imaginations. Art and Spiritual Intuitions work deeply on our subconscious until they are brought to the surface and made conscious. The Michael School sorts out the vast complexities of where the Spiritual World has entwined with the subconscious regions of the so called Jungian Unconscious realms.\n\nSpiritual Science students are part of the new explorers who map the still unexplored regions of the world. These are the new frontiers, not our distorted materialistic cosmology that creates an intriguing cartoon of the explorations of deep space. It is rather the deep uncharted recesses of the roots of all of our collective human spirits that Spiritual Science and the Novalis school recognizes as the dawning discoveries of the vast uncharted regions of our Consciousness Soul.\n\nIn this our Fifth Age, The Age of Pisces and The Consciousness Soul, we are required to learn to confront, define and map the regions that mark “the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge” and track and outline the course of the occult birth of ever more PERILOUS meglomaniacal psychopaths. For these shall arise and perilously unfold their powers in the future ages yet to come.\n\nThe unfathomable depths of our unfathomable lack of Consciousness Soul education in the United States of America, in the very age of the true CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL, provides the rest of humanity with a Golden Opportunity that only The Michael School can deliver. Melville’s Moby Dick still surpasses the sales and reading of the Bible in the whole world wide market.\n\nIn our Michael School studies (CLICK LINK) of Novalis, John the Baptist and the foundations of Spiritual Science, we are able to see in Melville’s “Moby Dick” how Elijah the prophet sets the entire tone of the tale that Melville created for America and the Age of America. (CLICK LINK Elijah, John the Baptist and the Science of Imagination) The American Age will fall into the trap of tyrannical dictators of the Will Forces aimed at the Incarnation of a full Ahrimanic Possession that was foreshadowed in Captain Ahab. The Michael School and the School of Spiritual Science embody the unfolding Cultural Science of Elijah the prophet, Novalis and the revelation of St. John (IMPORTANT LINK).\n\n“The first, and very framing, prophecy of the story occurs directly after Ishmael and Queequeg have signed on the Pequod, when they meet Elijah. After learning that Ishmael and Queequeg have already signed aboard the Pequod, Elijah declares, “what’s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all…Some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose…God pity ’em!” (126). Elijah seems to predict the fate of the Pequod. Declaring that God should pity the sailors who board the ship is to say that something terrible should befall the voyage. Elijah makes a prophecy, thereby predicting fate.”\n\nAhab and the black magic of BAAL (CLICK LINK) are confronted by Elijah and the very depth of the Magical Idealism of the Science of the Michael School, formed by Novalis, Goethe, Rudolf Steiner and hundreds of thousands who work diligently daily in defense and exploration of the Spirit of humanity are part of concrete educational impulses of The School of Spiritual Science and the Consciousness Soul.\n\nOur current universities and educational institutes follow the model of Ahrimanic matriculation, accreditation, certification to the letter of the law and dominate through association the indoctrination of materialism against the comprehension and logic of the Spirit. Our current convoluted circumstances of the United States of America are tied to the megalomaniacal psychopaths who have pledged their undying allegiance to Israel and the black magicians of BAAL. Melville got it right. The profile of the Incarnation of Ahriman and the portrait of Ahab as captain of the ill-fated Pequod is in truth part of the Spiritual Science of the Michael School of the Novalis/Elijah mystery of The United States of America. Melville had been part of the Michael School before he incarnated as Herman Melville. He brought with him a deep, deep vision of the character, portrait and the fatality of how the MONSTERS SPAWNED FROM THE AMERICAN PSYCHE arise.\n\nJust as the Age of the Fishes that we are in now reveals a fish in an upward and a fish in a downward direction.\n\nThe Age of Pisces and the Tragedy of Karma\n\n” – the destiny that works itself out between anthroposophists and non-anthroposophists, — casts its waves even into the worlds of the Angeloi. It leads to a parting of the Spirits, even in the world of the Angeloi. The Angel who accompanies the anthroposophist to his next incarnations learns to find his way still more deeply into the spiritual kingdoms than he could do before, while the Angel who belongs to the other man — to the one who cannot enter, — descends. It is in the destiny of the Angeloi that we first perceive how this great separation is taking place. To this, my dear friends, I would now direct your hearts. It is happening now, that the comparatively single and uniform kingdom of the Angeloi is being turned into a twofold kingdom of Angeloi, a kingdom of Angeloi with an upward tendency into the higher worlds, and with a downward tendency into lower worlds.\n\n“While the Michael community is being formed here upon earth, we can behold above it the ascending and the descending Angeloi. Looking more deeply into the world today, one can perpetually observe these streams, which are such as to stir the heart to its foundations.”\n\nWe are now experiencing how family, friends, colleagues and our Angels are being either sucked down into the darkness and the deeds we do, such as Monsanto GM seeds that will plant evil into the strata and foundations of nature from this the Fifth Age, the Age of Pisces, seeds of human catastrophe will be planted into the vast soil of the future.\n\nWhat we do now under the Age of the Fishes will reverberate and have vast repercussions on into the far distant future of the Manicheanism of the Sixth age, when the Sun rises in Aquarius in the Spring. And as reincarnating human spirits we will be there when the MOON rejoins the Earth in the far distant age, the 7th Age, when the Sun Rises in Spring from the constellation of Capricorn.\n\nRudolf Steiner\n\n“Now we must ask: What causes such utterly different conditions on earth? This is connected with the progression of the spring equinox. About 800 years before Christ the sun in spring entered the constellation of Aries, of the Ram. Every year at the vernal point it shifts a little. Because of this the conditions on the earth are always slightly changing. Eight hundred years before Christ the sun stood in the constellation of Aries. Earlier it stood in the constellation of Taurus, still earlier in Gemini and still earlier in Cancer. Now already for some hundreds of years it rises in the constellation of Pisces. After this comes Aquarius. The advance of civilizations is also connected with the progression of the sun from one constellation to the other.\n\n“At the time when the sun rose in the constellation of Cancer the ancient Vedic culture of the Indians, the culture of the Rishis reached its highest point. The Rishis, those still half-divine beings, were the teachers of men. The Atlantean civilisation had met its destruction; a new impulse broke in. In occultism this is called a ‘vortex’ (wirbel). This is also why, in the age in which the sun stood in the constellation of Cancer, the sign was made in this way:\n\n“Cancer signifies a breaking in of something new, a ‘vortex’ (a double spiral).\n\n“The second cultural epoch is named the constellation of the Twins. At that time the dual nature of the world was understood, the opposing forces of the world, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Good and Evil. Thus the Persians also speak of the Twins.\n\n“The third cultural epoch is that of the Sumerians in Asia Minor and of the Egyptians. The constellation of the Bull corresponds to this epoch. This is why in Asia the Bull was venerated and in Egypt, Apis. At that time in Babylon and Assyria the Sumerian language was the language of wisdom. Then the Bull fell into decadence and the Ram came into the ascendant. The first indication of this is the Saga of the Golden Fleece.\n\n“The fourth culture is that of the Ram, or Lamb; Christ stands in the sign of the Ram, or Lamb; hence he calls himself the Lamb of God.\n\n“As fifth culture the external materialistic civilisation follows, in the constellation of the Fishes. This developed principally from the 12th century on-wards and reached its climax about the year 1800. This is the culture of the Fifth sub-race, the present time.\n\n“In the constellation of the Water-Man in the future, the new Christianity will be proclaimed. ‘Water-Man’ is also the one who will bring it, he who has already been here: John the Baptist. Later he will again be the forerunner of Christ, when the Sixth, the spiritual sub-race will be founded.”\n\nIn this our Fifth Age we are planting psychopath, genetic and immoral seeds that will reverberate into the far distant future AND/OR we are slowly also learning how to harvest supersensible food from the gardens of our very own Angels. We are all on the clock and the clock can be read with clarity.\n\nIn this study from the American West, and in specific the continent of the United States of America we will find our orientation to some of the vast forces that are at play under the surface of our continent.\n\nWe are on a vast journey together and without a doubt we may mark the trail of our journey into the future of America with richer and clearer markings than Lewis and Clark had made. In the Lewis and Clark expedition it was called ‘perilous’.\n\nRudolf Steiner (click Link) “This [WE] can only do if [WE] rise, in spiritual knowledge, at least as far into extra-earthly Super-Nature as [WE HAVE] descended, in technical Sciences, into Sub-Nature. The age requires a knowledge transcending Nature, because in its inner life it must come to grips with a life-content which has sunk far beneath Nature — a life-content whose influence is perilous.”\n\nBut meeting and exploring the Spiritual, Moral, Regional Beings, supersensible and subsensible beings that make up the map and soul-scape of the United States of America is equally perilous.\n\n“The Lewis and Clark Expedition, also known as the Corps of Discovery Expedition, was the first American expedition to cross what is now the western portion of the United States, departing in May, 1804 from St. Louis on theMississippi River, making their way westward through the continental divide to the Pacific coast.\n\n“The expedition was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson shortly after theLouisiana Purchase in 1803, consisting of a select group of U.S. Army volunteers under the command of Captain Meriwether Lewis and his close friend Second Lieutenant William Clark. Their perilous journey lasted from May 1804 to September 1806. The primary objective was to explore and map the newly acquired territory, find a practical route across the Western half of the continent, and establish an American presence in this territory before Britain and other European powers tried to claim it.\n\n“The campaign’s secondary objectives were scientific and economic: to study the area’s plants, animal life, and geography, and establish trade with local Indian tribes. With maps, sketches and journals in hand, the expedition returned to St. Louis to report their findings to Jefferson.”\n\n“The French émigré, Jean de Crèvecoeur, popularized the idea that America was a “melting pot” and that Americans constituted a new race. The settlers of North America entered a land free from a preexisting dominating folk soul, where new social ideals could be established.6 The three western nations that played the most significant role in the colonization of North America also represented the three soul types spoken about by Rudolf Steiner: The Etheric Geography of North America by David Mitchell (search RIDDLE OF AMERICA pdf file)\n\n“The Spanish — representing the Sentient Soul, settled in Mexico, as well as the American South and West. They brought horses, established ranches, and nourished a rich family life. Their initial interest was the earth, in collecting gold.\n\n“The French — representing the Intellectual Soul, settled in the North and explored the Midwest, opening up the continent’s interior as trappers and hunters. Their initial interest was in the animals. They collected fur for fashion apparel.\n\n“The English — representing the Consciousness Soul, settled along the East Coast and gave to the new nation form, government, and commerce. Their initial concern was with the plant realm. They planted seeds and established farms.”\n\nPerilous because The United States of America hides a vast seed bed of morally unsound, Genetic, Military, Social, Viral and Spiritual deeds and events that will take root, grow and become the most severe challenges already in this our Fifth Age; a more refined evil coming in the future Sixth Age; and the potent and devastating finale, the crescendo of the vast cosmic, musical symphony of humanity, the 7th Age, shall bring to a culmination all that America was and has become, during these three specific periods. These three specific star periods, The Age of Pisces, The Age of Aquarius and The Age of Capricorn , will bring to a culmination point, what is called THE AMERICAN AGE.\n\nThe 7th Age, the Age when the Sun will rise in Capricorn in the Spring, is when all our chickens come home to roost. Of course under the earth, in caves, the night craving bats also live in their roosts. But wonderful and terrible things that we are executing and doing right now, will come to fruition in THE AGE OF AMERICA. Our job, like Lewis and Clark, is to map some of the coming attractions using a far more advanced foundational science than is allowed in our current university curriculums.\n\nComing Attractions, previews and the precise Time on the Big Clock of the stars, is extremely accurate. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand what TIME IT IS and what Time it will be. We have the big clocks for a reason. We have the big TWELVE on the big board and the big Ferris Wheel of Time for a reason. We know how we got suspended in the infinite, at the top of the Ferris Wheel looking down on the small objects, people, cars, below that it is all a matter of Divine Perspective. But not all of it that we see from the top of the Ferris Wheel has sunk into our sense of Consciousness Soul Perspective.\n\nSpiritual Science in the 21st Century: Transforming Evil, Meeting the Other and Awakening to the Global Initiation of Humanity (Click Link)\n\n“Anthroposophy speaks about the SEVENTH cultural epoch, after the Russian, as being the American epoch. This will be the end of the post-atlantean age. This will be the most materialistic, preposterous, occult downfall, of this whole age. And this great downfall is named after America. In this epoch, all those dark forces will reach ultimate concentration and influence. For the non-spiritualized part of humanity, those connected to the dark and retarded forces, will come to full-flower in the SEVENTH epoch. In the sixth post-atlantean epoch, begins the real work of the transformation of evil into good, under the leadership of Mani. So here we have some perspectives on the future.” Yeshayahu Ben-Aharon (Author)\n\nCultural Age/ Dates/ Civilization\n\nCancer 7227-5067 Indian\n\nGemini 5067-2907 Persian\n\nTaurus 2907-747 B.C.E.

To those who revere Stephen Hawking as a saint and are happy in the groove of arbitrary materialism and the poisoning of our minds with utter craven, insensitive nonsense, you will not soon be heading into anything that even resembles the upward thrust of our Angels.\n\nThe current Ahrimanic Cosmology of the West have never placed the advancement and unfolding of HUMANITY itself, in conjunction with the evolution written into the entire Zodiac as a real part of EDUCATIONAL COMING ATTRACTIONS. What the Earth and the inhabitants of the Earth have to do with the learning curve of the mighty constellations has been ripped from the curriculum’s in all our universities. A complete dumbfounded gap of intelligence has been deliberately wedged in, to block any information as to how humanity is on a progressive learning curve that coincides with the unfolding patterns of the rhythmic ticking clock of the enormous star studded constellations.\n\n“The Equal Age Theory purports that each of the 12 Great Ages last the same amount of time: about 2,160 years. This figure is based on 1/12th of the time for the precession of the equinox to make a complete cycle of about 26,000 years. This theory is in contrast with those who believe that great ages are irregular and that some great ages may last longer than others depending on the real estate they occupy along the ecliptic. For instance, Pisces takes up more room along the ecliptic than Aquarius, so some believe that the Age of Pisces should last hundreds of years longer than the Age of Aquarius.”\n\nFor approximately the next 1560 years we shall complete our journey through the constellation of Pisces. We shall have time to digest Consciousness Soul paradigms and higher intelligence. Currently the constellations are beginning to feel the approach of Sophia Star Wisdom. The magnificent Divine Star wisdom of Sophia is the cosmic bride of the Christ Being. The Risen Etheric Christ tied the knot that binds humanity to the progressive unfolding of our immortality, at Golgotha. The higher educational unfolding of our grand human drama is directly linked to the binding of Christ to the unfolding of the future of Earth and Humanity. The Grand Wedding of the Bride, Sophia, to the Bridegroom, the Risen Etheric Christ, is all part of the COMING ATTRACTIONS.\n\n6th Cultural Era = Manas or Spirit Self\n\n7th Cultural Era = Buddhi or Life Spirit\n\nAfter Catastrophe = Atma or Spirit Man\n\nThese COMING ATTRACTIONS are approaching in three potent stages. These three potent stages of the wedding of the Bride Sophia to the Risen Etheric Christ are the key mystery of how we as humanity are to arrive as Wedding Guests all along the way to the 7th Age. The 7th Age is when the Spring Equinox rises in the constellation of Capricorn. These three phases of our future bring to the whole Earth Evolution the culmination known as the AGE OF AMERICA.\n\nIn the Science of Novalis/St. John we can trace distinctly the vast swirling of Osiris and Egypt, Elijah and the Black Magic of the priests of BAAL in the tale spun by Herman Melville, “Moby Dick” and the White Whale.\n\nThe Novalis School of the Archangels in the University of Sophia\n\n“We have to look in the Far East for that stream of peoples whose Archangel was the first one to attain the rank of a Spirit of the Age. It was that stream of peoples who formed the ruling class of that land and laid the foundations of the first post-Atlantean civilization after their Archangel had become the Spirit of the Age, after he had been promoted to the first Spirit of the Age or Archai of the post-Atlantean age of civilization. Now this Spirit of the Age guided the primal sacred culture of India and made it the leading one in the first post-Atlantean age of civilization. The other peoples of Asia who were gradually developing, were for a long time under the guidance merely of Archangels.\n\n“Those peoples of Europe who had remained behind when the migration from West to East took place, were also under the guidance of Archangels for a long time after the Archangel of India had risen to the rank of an Archai and then acted through intuition upon those Great Teachers of India, the Holy Rishis, who because they were aided by this exalted and important Spirit were able to fulfill their high mission in the manner already described. This Spirit of the Age worked on for a long time, whilst the people lying to the north of ancient India were still under the guidance of the Archangel. When the Spirit of the Age of India had fulfilled his mission, he was promoted to the guidance of the entire evolution of post-Atlantean humanity.”\n\n‘The Saptarishi (from saptarṣi, a Sanskrit dvigu meaning “seven sages”) are the seven rishis who are extolled at many places in the Vedas and Hindu literature.\n\nThe White Whale reveals the Resurrected wisdom of Osiris and Isis hidden in the unfathomed depths of American psyche in the age of the FISHES. The White Whale and the hunt for the White Whale is how the American Psyche learned to plunge into the depths of global Spiritual Cosmology.\n\nThe Beatles (click link) themselves were unconsciously led to the massive mature Archai Being that had been promoted from India to guide the entire sweep of the evolution of Post-Atlantean Humanity. The entire wisdom of the Holy Rishis was transplanted in the human being we have tracked through time, from the raising of Lazarus to the initiation of Christian Rosenkreuz. Christian Rosenkreuz carries the entire wisdom of the Holy Rishis within his higher human spiritual bodies.\n\nHow do we know we are headed for a Wedding of the vast Sophia Wisdom to the Risen Etheric Christ? There are four profound clues that place the dawning of the Age of the Consciousness Soul as a preparation for the Wedding. We shall be the Wedding guests. However, as the research we have presented so far reveals, this is no easy journey. It is perilous and fraught with dangers as the Rising Super-Power of the United States wrests itself free of the Ahrimanic Materialism we have succumbed to.\n\nWedding Guests and the Garments of the Wedding Guests are all about THE COMING ATTRACTIONS. No one is going to walk into this Wedding without having Resurrected Sophia/Isis, as ANTHROSOPHIA, in our inner being, as the objective transformed forces of our human knowledge that appears radiant and shining at the fulfillment and culmination of the 7th Age, THE AMERICAN AGE. ANTHROPOSOPHIA, THE CHILD OF SOPHIA, has to be awakened to be a member of the Wedding Guests contingency.\n\nWhich means that no one is getting into the Wedding without having passed through Manas – Buddhi – and Atma. No one is getting into the Wedding as Wedding guests without struggling through to SPIRIT-SELF; LIFE-SPIRIT; and SPIRIT MAN. Which means we had better learn about what these COMING ATTRACTIONS (click link) are.\n\nFirst Clue\n\n1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 2″The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.\n\n4 Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’\n\n5 But they paid no attention and went off–one to his field, another to his business. 6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. 7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.\n\n8 Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9 Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ 10 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n\n11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.12 ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless. 13 Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’\n\n14 “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”\n\nSecond Clue (click Link)\n\n“On an evening before Easter Day, I sat at a table, and having (as my custom was) in my humble prayer sufficiently conversed with my Creator, and considered many great mysteries (whereof the Father of Lights his Majesty had shown me not a few) and being now ready to prepare in my heart, together with my dear Paschal Lamb, a small, unleavened, undefiled cake; all of a sudden arose so horrible a tempest, that I imagined no other but that through its mighty force, the hill on which my little house was founded would fly into pieces.\n\n“But inasmuch as this, and the like from the Devil (who had done me many a spite) was no new thing to me, I took courage, and persisted in my meditation, till somebody in an unusual manner touched me on the back; whereupon I was so hugely terrified, that I dared hardly look about me; yet I showed myself as cheerful as (in such occurrences) human frailty would permit.\n\n“Now the same thing still twitching me several times by the coat, I looked back, and behold it was a fair and glorious lady, whose garments were all sky-coloured, and curiously (like Heaven) bespangled with golden stars; in her right hand she bore a trumpet of beaten gold, on which a Name was engraved which I could well read but am as yet forbidden to reveal it. In her left hand she had a great bundle of letters of all languages, which she (as I afterwards understood) was to carry to all countries. She also had large and beautiful wings, full of eyes throughout, with which she could mount aloft, and fly swifter than any eagle.\n\n“I might perhaps have been able to take further notice of her, but because she stayed so little time with me, and terror and amazement still possessed me, I had to be content. For as soon as I turned about, she turned her letters over and over, and at length drew out a small one, which with great reverence she laid down upon the table, and without giving one word, departed from me. But in her mounting upward, she gave so mighty a blast on her gallant trumpet, that the whole hill echoed from it, and for a full quarter of an hour after, I could hardly hear my own words.\n\n“In so unlooked for an adventure I was at a loss, how either to advise or to assist my poor self, and therefore fell upon my knees and besought my Creator to permit nothing contrary to my eternal happiness to befall me. Whereupon with fear and trembling, I went to the letter, which was now so heavy, that had it been mere gold it could hardly have been so weighty. Now as I was diligently viewing it, I found a little seal, on which a curious cross with this inscription, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, was engraved.\n\n“Now as soon as I espied this sign I was the more comforted, as not being ignorant that such a seal was little acceptable, and much less useful, to the Devil. Whereupon I tenderly opened the letter, and within it, in an azure field, in golden letters, found the following verses written.\n\n“This day, today\n\nIs the Royal Wedding day.\n\nFor this thou wast born\n\nAnd chosen of God for joy\n\nThou mayest go to the mountain\n\nWhereon three temples stand,\n\nAnd see there this affair.\n\nKeep watch\n\nInspect thyself\n\nAnd shouldst thou not bathe thoroughly\n\nThe Wedding may work thy bane.\n\nBane comes to him who faileth here\n\nLet him beware who is too light.”\n\nThird Clue (Click Link)\n\nI pass, like night, from land to land;\n\nI have strange power of speech;\n\nThat moment that his face I see,\n\nI know the man that must hear me:\n\nTo him my tale I teach.\n\nWhat loud uproar bursts from that door!\n\nThe wedding-guests are there:\n\nBut in the garden-bower the bride\n\nAnd bride-maids singing are:\n\nAnd hark the little vesper bell,\n\nWhich biddeth me to prayer!\n\nO Wedding-Guest (click link)! this soul hath been\n\nAlone on a wide wide sea:\n\nSo lonely ’twas, that God himself\n\nScarce seemèd there to be.\n\nO sweeter than the marriage-feast,\n\n‘Tis sweeter far to me,\n\nTo walk together to the kirk\n\nWith a goodly company!\n\nFourth Clue – Spiritual Science Schooling and Christian Rosenkreuz (click link)\n\n“When Christian Rosenkreutz awakes he knows that he is allowed to make the journey and he arrays himself in his wedding garment. This is a white linen coat (we are reminded of the wedding garment of the guests in the parable). He wears a red stole crosswise, as a priest wears his.”\n\nAmerica misinterprets, confounds and falsifies GOODNESS, depth, mercy, compassion. It starts in our pulpits and our churches and our group soul congregational mind numbing. We go to church because we have been duped into believing this is an easy cake-walk, just believe in the Child Jesus, quote scripture and ask everyone you meet, “have you been saved?”. It doesn’t work like that in real life or in the real understanding and comprehension of the scriptures.\n\nOf the Four Clues above, Christians find themselves too cowardly to go beyond clue # 1. Goody, goody two shoes, all frozen in the fallacies of dead traditions and morally on lock down in the cement death armor of Biblical dogma, Christians cannot conceive of the Spirt-Selfhood transformation, penetration and illumination of the depths of our astral bodies that will clarify and cleanse us with renewed Angelic Thinking from now past the 6th Age.\n\nThe Wedding Guests must plunge down to the depths and awaken the Sophia in us. The objective forces of all humanity and all science and all love, that is every human beings ANTHROSOPHIA, is the wisdom, right and possession of the spiritual essence of the daughter of Sophia Herself. ANTHROSOPHIA is the hidden possession of each human soul who carries an I AM. This platform of Spiritual Intelligence and the Consciousness Soul will draw toward us the higher phase of Spirit-Selfhood that rises with the coming of the 6th Age. Upon the foundation of ANTHROSOPHIA we will build Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit and Spirit-Man. Upon the foundations of ANTHROSOPHIA we may build Manas, Buddhi and Atma through the Fifth – Sixth – and Seventh age. It is the awakening of the central core of the cognitive conscious moral substance by which the laws of the whole universe are built. This is the cornerstone and The Foundation Stone (Click Link) of the wise. This was part of Psalm 118 and what we discover here:\n\nMark 12:10\n\nAnd have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected\n\nhas become the head of the corner:\n\nIsaiah 28:16\n\nSo this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a\n\ntested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who\n\ntrusts will never be dismayed.”\n\nYet it is the law, it is unarguable, it is immense, we all must find ourselves on the journey through the Fifth, the Sixth and the Seventh Age and so far we are completely clueless of the stages and the phases through which we must endure and develop. We are being measured on the big clock of the world and we will be required to awaken our higher selves along the great learning curve of the COMING ATTRACTIONS, without exception.\n\nAdriana Koulias\n\n“This being that was intimately seen by the Greeks as Sophia and by Dante as Lady Philosophy was unveiled by Rudolf Steiner in our times as Anthroposophia.”\n\n“The loftiness of the Cosmic Sophia, precluded her direct descent into the soul of humanity, this meant that another being had to take up the task of being the mediator of this wisdom to man. Who was this being?\n\n“Rudolf Steiner first spoke about this being’s place in our times, some months before the laying of the foundation stone for the first Goetheanum. In his inaugural lecture at the First General Meeting of the Anthroposophical Society in 1913[3] he told Anthroposophists that they were to think of ‘Anthroposophia’ as a living being, a being with an evolution and a biography.[4] In a different lecture[5] he indicated that Anthroposophia was an invisible human being, whose destiny and path had followed that of humanity, only in an accelerated way. We were asked to come to a relationship with this being, to go to her with all our questions, our hopes and our fears that we, as Anthroposophists were to do nothing before consulting with this being.\n\n“But who was this illusive being, what was her nature and what have been and continue to be her tasks?\n\n“Rudolf Steiner gave us indications that in the beginning, Anthroposophia had the nature of an Archangelic being; that she was of the same substance as Michael and ‘developed in accordance not with earthly laws but with the laws of the Sun[6]. This suggests that Anthroposophia was possessed of the nature of an archangel…”\n\nClue # 2 brings us to the dawn of the Consciousness Soul Age and the mission of the Consciousness Soul, to prepare for the Wedding we shall be invited to. Clue # 3 reveals some of the real nightmares and trials of the path of Initiation. The Ancient Mariner of the Pisces Age is magnetically, in terms of SPEECH AND THE WORD and in terms of the Devachan Sciences of Magnetism, Electricity and Laser and Nuclear fallen light, possessed of a Sixth Epoch Initiation empowerment.\n\nThe Ancient Mariner has an occult compass and navigational cosmic magnet connected to the powers of Speech, the Angelic laws of karma and destiny, that draws him to souls who never even imagined in their wildest dreams that on a certain day, unforeseen, their entire world would literally change because of a startling unplanned meeting.\n\nHe went like one that hath been stunned,\n\nAnd is of sense forlorn :\n\nA sadder and a wiser man,\n\nHe rose the morrow morn.\n\nAll superficiality would drain out of their souls and Horror-true Horror and facts would alter forever the fixed certainty of their goals to highest trivial pursuits and enticements to materialistic fantasies of bliss.\n\nClue #4, if you are lucky, has brought you here, to the schooling of Spiritual Science and the awakening to the Sophia and Novalis science studies of awakening ANTHROSOPHIA consciously. The science of learning to unlock the Coming Attractions that everyone, without exception will be challenged to attain, Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit and Spirit-Man. And if all the above clues have been for naught we may have the left overs if that is what you desire. Here are what the left overs are like. (click link).\n\nThe COMING ATTRACTIONS have everything to do with a reuniting of Isis and Osiris. The key to Clue # 4 and the foundations of Spiritual Schooling – has been roughly outlined by Rudolf Steiner for your convenience HERE, (Click Link). The COMING ATTRACTIONS are all about our wresting from ancient SET/(current Ahriman) a resurrected Cosmology and from the far West a Cosmogony that is fit for the unfolding of the higher spiritual potentials of humanity. Starting in the FIFTH AGE, this current Age of Pisces we must wrest from our cold Ahrimanic intellects, that view the cosmos as a void unrelated BIG BANG THEORY, we must win for ourselves and humanity a new, vivid and ensouled Cosmos, that once illuminated all of the ancient Egyptian culture.\n\nTHE APPROACH OF THE DIVINE SOPHIA IN THREE PHASES\n\nIn the first phase of the approach, Sophia/Star Wisdom begins to radiate and return, refreshed and reinvigorated to the awakening of our Consciousness Soul. New and resurrected Zodiacal wisdom that was lost to us since the Egyptian Age of Isis and Osiris starts stirring with inner invigorated life.\n\nThe Consciousness Soul and the approach of Sophia/Isis star wisdom (click Link)\n\n“Just as the eye is the expression for the power of sight, so to the Egyptian the Sun was the eye of Osiris, the embodiment of the Spirit of the Sun. All this had been experienced at one time by the soul of Copernicus, and it was the unconscious memory of it that impelled him to renew, in a form possible to a materialistic age, this ancient idea of Osiris, which at that time had been entirely spiritual. When humanity had sunk more deeply within the physical plane, this idea confronts us again in its materialistic form, as the Copernican theory.\n\n“The Egyptians possessed the spiritual conception and it was the world-karma of Copernicus to retain a memory of such conceptions, and this conjured forth that “combination of bearings” that led to his theory of the solar system. The case was similar with Kepler, who, in his three laws, presented the movement of the planets round the sun in a much more comprehensive way; however abstract they may appear to us, they were the result of a most profound conception. A striking fact in connection with this highly gifted being is contained in a passage written by himself and which fills us with awe when we read it. Kepler writes: “I have thought deeply upon the Solar System. It has revealed to me its secrets; I will carry over the sacred ceremonial vessels of the Egyptians into the modern world.”\n\nIn the second phase of Sophia’s approach, the entire Elohim, the six Elohim of the Sun and radiant Michael Wisdom begin to redefine the outer and inner appearance and features of human beings based solely on their spiritual content (CLICK LINK). This is the reverse engineering of what Ahrimanic materialism intends.\n\nOur inner spiritual contents are in preparation, as we elaborate our Consciousness Soul foundations, to outwardly redesign the appearance of our human features based on the cohesion of our inner spiritual content. Ahriman will attempt to control, modify and standarize a new caste system and impose outer genetic locks on all human beings hidden spiritual potentials. This is one of Ahriman’s powerful imperatives and is vividly outlined in SOMNI 451 (click link). This 6th and 7th age paradigm shift from Ahriman to higher Michael Sun Forming Power is part of the so called Wedding Guest Mysteries. (Click Link)\n\nWe are challenged in The United States of America and by the backward Super-Power, abnormal, sub-normal unfolding development of the ancient Archangel from Egypt that dynamically hovers over the United States of America, like a cock-eyed, twitchy, nerve impaired, uncoordinated mother hen, trying to hatch a deformed Sun Egg of human spiritual beings. This crazy Mother Hen is now an arising Archai that will over come it’s Parkinson like tremors and seek the wholeness of an Archai in the higher service of the developments of cosmic evolution.\n\nThe Education of the American Folk-Soul and The Christ Impulse\n\n“But this Spirit of the Age of our fifth post-Atlantean age of civilization worked in a very unique manner. He had to make a kind of compromise with one of the old Spirits of the Age who worked before the Christian-impulse, viz., the Egyptian Spirit of the Age, who, as we have heard, had in a certain respect risen to the rank of a Spirit of Form. Thus it comes about that our fifth post-Atlantean age of civilization, in which we now are, is really ruled by a Spirit of the Age who is in a certain way very much under the influence and impulses of the old Egyptian civilization, and of a Spirit of Form who is only at quite an elementary stage.\n\n“That caused the many rifts and divisions in our age. Our Spirit of the Age in the fifth post-Atlantean age of civilization is striving in a certain respect to raise himself up to spiritual heights and to raise the fourth post-Atlantean age of civilization to a hi"
