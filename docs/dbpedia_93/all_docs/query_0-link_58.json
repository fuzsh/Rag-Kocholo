        "text": "Biography\n\nContact Info:\n\nReception:\n\ngezaxrecords@gmail.com\n\n310-800-2516\n\nPresident:\n\nGeza X\n\ngeza.gezaxrecords@gmail.com\n\n310-428-9081\n\nThe foundation of Carnage Asada began with 3 junior high school friends who bonded over LA punk and psychedelic rock in the early 1980s: Cellist Dave Travis (former owner of Café NELA), Singer George Murillo and Bassist David Jones. The trio attended shows together and Dave Travis also put on his own generator jams that became legendary in outdoors So Cal locals such as LA/Ventura County Line and Malibu Beach, Temescal Canyon’s Skull Rock in Pacific Palisades as well as early Desert Rock events. Jones had played in SST era band Magnolia Thunderpussy, a band that Dave Travis managed and booked and the two were in a group together called Permanent Trails.\n\nIn 1993 Jones, Travis and Murillo combined to form Carnage Asada with drummer Pat Palma (Magnolia Thunderpussy) and guitarist Jesse Engel (Linus on Fire). The band played some wild and noisy shows but dissolved one night at a show at Frog’s Saloon in Hermosa Beach. Carnage continued on for a while as a trio until they were joined by bassist/drummer Steve Reed (Night Watch, Bazooka, Legal Weapon). Throughout the 90s the band’s lineup focused around those 4 as well as drummer/filmmaker/fanzine creator Dave Markey (Sin 34, Desperate Teenage Love Dolls and We Got Power) and a host of guitarists including Dez Cadena (Black Flag, DC3), Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson), Joe Baiza (Saccharine Trust) and David Green (Los Abandoned). The late 90s into 2000s incarnations of Carnage also included bassist Chris Stein (Saccharine Trust) who passed away from cancer in 2018. The current Carnage Asada lineup features guitarist Tony Fate (the Bellrays, Black Widows). Carnage Asada has officially released one album, Permanent Trails in 1999."
