Hopefully, this device will make it easier and quicker in getting your information into MRR, but just typing the pieces your¬ selves is not enough. To make things easier on the shit- workers: DO: Use a standard typeface. Use a clean typewriter ribbon. , Don’t make any “stray” marks on the paper. 4) Leave margins on ajj sides of at least an inch. 5) Make any corrections with a light blue pen — the kind that doesn t show up on xerox copies, 6) Use white-out to cover up mistakes. cai DON’T: DO NOT TYPE IN ALL CAPITALS !!! Don’t correct mistakes with a normal pen. Don’t use a typewriter that makes blotchy characters or fills in the letters with ink. 4) Don’t send a xerox copy with weak or badly defined characters. 5) Don’t make it into columns (we just have to reformat it anyway). 6) bon i use exotic typefaces or italics. “ Don’t underline sloppily by hand. Don’t use hyphens (•) at tn< . . now, it’s rough, like high sch stupid rules, but just think of the poor shitworkers and PLEASE try to send in something our finicky scanner will digest.

Hello, I’m Richie. I’m writing in regards to your many different little cheap shots on all the straight edge bands. Seems to me like you can’t even mention a straight edge band without using the word “ridiculous” or some¬ thing equally as intelligent. Your Walk Proud review, and your reference to S.E. bands in your Melvins interview are good examples of your close-mindedness. Ail of you ultra-lefty political punks are the same. You all preach unity, and open-mindedness, yet you slag off everyone who is not just like you. Time for you to grow up, perhaps. How come you never mention the good aspects of straight edge: such as anti racism, anti-violence, etc. And don’t tell me that anti-drug use is nega¬ tive - that’s bullshit! Anti-drug use is positive and not negative like you lefties claim. Maybe you ought to think about what you say about things that you know nothing about. Anyway, a reply would be appreciated. Thanx, Richie Maida/ 21580 SW Stafford Road/ Tualatin, OR 97062 Howdy Richie- Okay, my friend, let us take a gander at your letter, shall we? In one sentence you mention my “close mindedness. ” For you to make such an assumption, I am, in return, assuming that you consider yourself to be an example of one who is “open minded.” If so, I find it awfully hard to believe you are so open minded when in the very next sentence you come ot the brilliant generalization, “All of you ultra-lefty political punks are all the same.” Jumping to an extreme conclusion aren't we, my friend? You're awfully quick to slap a label on and judge people you know nothing about. Doesn't that kinda go against some of the SE ideology? Just on a personal note, Mr. Open-mindedness, I'm not even close to being an “ultra-leftie” and I'm about as political as Ernest Borgnine. How about your use of “you lefties” within such a harsh context? Doesn't some of the SE ideology revolve around accepting people for who they are and respecting other peoples' be¬ liefs and lifestyles, different or not? Then why are you taking “little cheap shots” at “lefties”? Sous “lefties” believe anti-drug use is negative? Interesting. Well my friend of numerous erroneous generalizations, it just so happens that I don't use drugs, I rarely drink, I never smoke, and if that ain't “posi¬ tive” enough, I'm involved in a monogamous relationship. But anyhow, when was it that I said anti-drug use was negative? Hmmm? Then again, I'm only speaking for myself. I guess you're refermg to all of those other millions of “lefties” out there who M surely must uniformly believe that anti-drug use is negative. Maybe you should take a second look at the line from you letter which reads, “You all preach unity, and open-minded¬ ness, yet you slag off everyone who is not just like you, ” and see who it really applies to most! One last thing, as for my “cheap shot” in the MELVINS interview, the reason I said that we talked about “lousy straight edge bands” is because we did 111 f. about i We didn't talk t the good ones, we happened to talk about the busy ones. And if you don't think there are any fousy SE bands, I think it's time you woke up to smell espresso. I respect your right to express your opinion, Richie, and I expect the same in return. Your best buddy for life, Chris Dodge Dear MRR. This letter is in regard to the skinhead problem. I know...skinheads are pissed off with people saying they’re racists and nazis. I’m sorry skinz, but I have yet to meet a skinhead who is not! Every fuckin’ skin I have met is a goddam contradiction. I asked a skin outside a bar, “Are most skins around here racists?”. She quickly came back with, “I’m not racist, I’m just a White Pride Skin.” Now what the fuck is that supposed to mean?! I asked another skin a similar question, his response was, “We don’t hate blacks, we just hate niggers!.” I get a similar response every time I talk to one. I think that many skins adopt \"skin- headism” because they want power and control over others. When they find that they lack the intelligence to suceed as an individ¬ ual, they turn to a cultish, propaganda-based social group, that being skinheads. I do apologize to any individualist, non¬ racist skins that may be out there. To all others, stop snorting propaganda and start making you own decisions. Peace and Soli¬ darity, Vulgar/ Canada Dear MRR Readers, It’s 3AM and I’m here flipping through MRR #70. I’ve iust finished reading Law¬ rence Livermore^ column, and I’m left here with some thoughts on “counterculture” (not “subculture”). OK. I don’t know if I have interpreted Lawrence’s definition of counter¬ culture right, but to me, what has always attracted me towards punk was that it was a space for a “different” type of person to seek refuge in (and also to grow in) from the bullshit world this person was raised in (none of my friends seem to appreciate this per¬ spective on punk-thank dog Lawrence might!!!). And that’s what punk’s originally about. Why do I say originally? Because the punk scene is just not like that anymore. To borrow from the Dead Kennedys, the current punk scene is “aclose-mindea self-centered social club”. Maybe it’s because of my attrac¬ tion towards the first wave of punk that I still S et off on oldies like T.S.O.L.,The Germs,or ►I, and take interest in a couple (I’m not saying all) death-rock bands who are not afraid to play, dress, think, or act the way they want to (or, you could say, they do not sub¬ scribe to rock’n’roll conformity). Well, I’m tired now, so I think I’ll go to bed. I don’t know if I made any sense, but I tried. Igor Paratte/1 st Communion Zine/ Box 298/ Acadia University/ Wolfville, Nova Scotia Canada BOP-IXO P.S.Does anybody know what hap¬ pened to the BLOODSUCKERS FROM OUTER SPACE, a New York band? I never hear about them anymore. Istheirdemotape available? P.P.S.Would anybody happen to know the address of the guy who puts out a zine called SHOCK APATHY? To MRR and Lawrence Livermore, I’m writing concerning Lawrence’s col¬ umn in issue #70 where he denounces 7 Seconds for “selling out” (and other shit like that). Yes, 7 Seconds did play hard, rough edged hardcore when they '‘didn’t know how to play their instruments” (your words). But now tney do so leave them alone. Fuck you if you can’t deal with change. Yes of course thev’ve changed in the oast ten years, haven’t you should grow up also. You can only take so many years of getting kicked in the head by stagedivers ana watching people get hurt in the “pit”. For what? Unity? I recently saw 7 Seconds in Providence, Rl and it was a great show. They had the whole crowd smiling and no one was being hurt. By the end of the show 95% of the crowd were on stage with their arms around each other singing Walk Together Rock Together. It was the first form of unity I’ve seen in the so called scene in years. A better kind of unity than “united skins” beating the shit out of people, or united anarchists screaming destroy! in the name of unity? People change over periods of time and so do bands. Whether it’s Aerosmith or 7 Seconds. That doesn’t mean you have to like it. But you should learn to accept it. Also I don’t think a band usually de¬ cides cover charge at a show. The band has an amount of money they need to survive on tour. The other percentage of the cover charge goes to the club and the promoter. This added to what the band needs usually is what raises high cover charges. May you should do an article on money hungry pro¬ moters and shitty club owners, instead of the band. Matt Paddock, North Kingstown. Rl. P.S. The Providence show was $5 for 3 bands, not bad. Dear Matt, Part of what you say is valid and part is bullshit. Bands can, do, and should change; my own band has changed greatly over the years, too, and I expect not everyone will approve of what we do, either. But I was talking not so much of musical change (though I personally do prefer the early 7 Seconds sound, amateurish musicanship and shitty production notwithstanding, to the polished but often sappy pop ditties they're producing today) as I was of business practices and being responsible for your own shit. You say that a band doesn't decide the cover charge at a show, but that's not completely true. There's nothing stopping a band from asking ahead of time what the door charge is going to be, and if necessary having it written into their contract what it's going to be. Fora band of 7 Seconds' stature, that should be no problem. Another illustration: around the same time as the overpriced Sacramento disco fiasco that I wrote about in my column, 7 Seconds was offered a chance to play at Gilman Street. They would have been well paid, had a good, all-ages crowd, and the door price would have been five or six bucks. No, they couldn't do it, says their manager, it would cost us a thousand bucks to haul all their special sound equipment. Dude, most of the greatest bands of our time have played on the Gilman stage with Gilman equipment and sounded great. Too bad it's not good enough for 7 Seconds, though. Anyway, my main point was not whether 7 Seconds was .selling out, ” which is kind of a meaningless concept to me anyway, but to say that if they'd been more responsible about conducting their business back in their early days, they wouldn't have gotten so ripped off and disillusioned that tney'd now go to the opposite extreme and hand over their careers to a mainstream, music-biz-as- usual type. Lawrence MRR, Great “Sexuality” issue! I especially enjoyed Jennifer Blowdryer’s article on Annie Sprinkle. For someone who had such a negative experience in the Porn world, she treated Ms. Sprinkle with respect and wrote a very interesting piece. The article “Don’t Be Gay”forced me to re-think my own sexuality, buttheonly conclusion I came to wasthat I’m too straight to be helped! I look forward to getting MRR every month in the mail, it’s definitely the best $15.00 investment I made to subscribe. It’s more informative than any of the news magazines available. I especially enjoy the Letters section and “Talkin’ Shit With Jane”, and Ace Backwords’ “Twisted Image”. Big Fun! Also a big thank you to Flush Produc¬ tions, Thrasher’s Digest, Black and Blue Records, and the insane Sockeve guys for the speedy delivery of the stuff 1 ordered. I haven’t ordered much through the mail in the past because I’ve been ripped off so many times. These people helped restore my faitn in mail-order music (especially Flush.-I will DEFINITELY order more of their EXCEL¬ LENT Comp, tapes!). Now if Touch and Go would just send me the Butthole Surfers tape I ordered last month, I’ll be confident to buy some more via the postal service. I hope you’ll print this letter, because I’m desperately trying to find some people to play music with. I can play bass and guitar pretty well, but since I lost all my equipment to a fucking music store, I just call myself a singer. I love groups like Joy Division, Minis¬ try and all punk rock. I’m also a bit obsessed with the film “Blue Velvet” and hope to some¬ day write songs like “Anything That Moves”, “Here’s to Ben”, “A Love-Letter from Frank Booth” and “His Disease” (all vague refer¬ ences to that immortal film). So, I’m going to be at this address for a couple more months. If you need a singer/ writer etc., write to me. I’a love to play music full time (It’s either that or college). J. Arthur Casey/ Rt. 2 Box 149-1 A/ Prague OK 74864 Dear Maximumrocknroll: I would like to comment on the Law¬ rence Livermore column appearing in issue #70. While I do not disagree with the author’s basic thesis, that there is fundamental need to develop a movement in opposition to the popular culture of this nation, I do resent his use and characterization of SF’s Tenderloin neighborhood as mere “subculture.” The author’s dismissal of the Tender¬ loin as a seedy and decrepit reflection of this society’s larger social and class relations may be quite correct as a broad generaliza¬ tion; however, such adismissal, without more, does a disservice to those forces in the Tenderloin currently working and organizing for change. Emphasizing, for simple illustra¬ tive purposes, tne drug abuse and prostitu¬ tion of the neighborhood only serves to overlook the efforts of such organizations as the Homeless-Welfare Taskforce of the North of Market Planning Coalition, the Coalition on Homeless, the u.N. Plaza Aids-Arc Vigil, the Income Rights Project, the Homeless Advocacy Project (legal assistance), San Francisco Support Services, the Law Offices of John Hardesty, the Tenderloin Housing Project and the Tenderloin Housing Eviction Defense Unit, the Bay Area Women’s Re¬ source Center, the Central City Hospitality House, the Tenderloin Self-Help Center, the St. Anthony Foundation, the Larken Street Youth Center, the General Assistance Advo¬ cacy Project, and many others. Although change in the Tenderloin has been neither easy nor quick, there is certainly a continuing effort toward such an end—something which the column completely ignores. If the author of the column is looking for the seeds of what he characterizes as a “counterculture,” he should perhaps look at the efforts of the Tenderloin’s Homeless- Welfare Taskforce. Organized in the Spring of 1988 as a legacy of the then defunct San Francisco Homeless Union, the group has been an exhilarating example of the collec¬ tive empowerment of an alienated and seem¬ ingly powerless segment of society against the larger forces and institutions of this city. Through the Taskforce’s meetings, negotia¬ tions and demonstrations, the homeless have successfully wrested from the city govern¬ ment significant improvements in its pro¬ grams and policies for the poor. More impor¬ tantly, however, the Taskforce has created a vehicle for the homeless to question and critique the institutions of this society, and their places vithin them. This critical thinking, which I believe is essential to the formation of a so-called counterculture, is fostered among the Tenderloin’s homeless by the Taskforce’s newsletter, \"The Homeless Link.” Like “Maximumrocknroll,”the Link is a medium for self-expression and collective identification; in other words, the homeless, like punks, are free to write what they feel and experience, and through those expressions see their common problems and needs. Identifying the “missing and distorted values,” as the author of the column puts it, is the first step in opposing them. Of course, nomentionofthis element in the Tenderloin’s \"subculture” is ever made. But the Homeless Task Force is merely one example of the many organizations in the Tenderloin whose values do not reflect those of the \"larger culture.” As a resident of the neighborhood and a student advocate of the General Assistance Advocacy Project, I was particularly galled by the column s im¬ plicit denigration of our project’s efforts. The General Assistance Advocacy Project, or GAAP, is a poverty law clinic established, staffed and led entirely by student volunteers of the University of California, Hastings Col¬ lege of the Law. It is the only poverty law clinic run completely by law students mde- endently of their school. It is not supervised y the school administration, and it does not receive any funds from it. Located in the center of the Tenderloin, GAAP assists the homeless and indigent in obtaining and maintaining county welfare (General Assistance, as it is called in San Francisco) and food stamp benefits. GAAP is also actively involved in challenging the structure and administration of the General Assistance and food stamp programs them¬ selves. Hovever, we understand that welfare advocacy alone is not the solution; it is only an intermediary step in the empowerment of the homeless and indigent. Welfare advo¬ cacy is necessary because radical rhetoric, without more, will not satisfy a homeless person’s immediate food and shelter needs. It is difficult for a homeless person to grasp such guiding principles as “truth and free¬ dom and love’ when she has no food in her belly and no shelter above her head. But, by seeking to assist the homeless and indigent in maintaining a minimal standard of living, GAAP seeks to give the poor an opportunity to become empowered, and, having done so, develop values in opposition to those of the prevailing culture. Similarly, by having law students work in the Tenderloin, we give many of them their first glimpse of the poverty, suffering and inequality that exists in this society. The goal is to foster a cadre of socially-conscious lawyers who, while not revolutionary, will at least question the ideology taught to them in law school. It is important to show law students that society and the law is not as it is portrayed on television by \"L.A. Law.” Thus, although the surface dynamics of the Tenderloin may appear to reflect those of larger society, like symptoms of a disease they often mask the presence of the antidote or cure. And it is this cure which we should be grappling with—whether you call the dis¬ ease patriarchy, hierarchy or capitalism— rather than merely decrying the disease’s simple symptoms. As Karl Marx once wrote, \"The philosophers have only interpreted the worlo in different ways; the point is to change it.” Sincerely yours, Thomas Mitcnell/ 100 McAllister St #1202/ San Francisco, CA 94102 Dear Thomas, Although I haven’t spent much time in the Tenderloin during recent years, I have heard that many positive changes have been B on there, and I’m glad you took the e to give us some greater detail about just how much has been happening. You may not have noticed, though, that the Ten¬ derloin was not the principal subject of my column, but rather just a starting point for my discussion of subculture vs. counterculture. I could have chosen any number of other neighborhoods to make the same point, and perhaps it was insensitive of me to overlook what’s been going on in the Tenderloin lately. However, despite these hopeful develop¬ ments, I would suggest that the dominant features of the Tenderloin are still crime, drug addiction, street prostitution, and simi¬ lar logical outgrowths of a political and eco¬ nomic systems that grinds up people just as it does the rest of the planet’s natural re¬ sources. But thanks again for writing, and maybe you should consider doing a full ar¬ ticle sometime giving a street-level view of the Tenderloin and what people are doing to change it. Lawrence Dear Max RnR, My fellow Inside Joker Ace Backwards is the most conservative contributor to Max RnR. Just because he’s a great artist he thinks he can pontificate from a position of ignorance. If the underground left were, as macho authoritarian as pre-Gorbachev Russia, as macho as Ace wishes he were and pretends to be in his writings, we would give him rehabilitation therapy with a rubber nose. That’s if we had no control over our hormones as he insists. In fact, many of us undergrounders try to practice free will. Yes we have been conditioned to act moronically in matters of power, sex, and violence, but this is conditioning, not biology, and can be eliminated in one lifetime. One could say that is what the underground is all about. Biology, on the other hand, can and should be beau¬ tiful. l-can’t-help-myself right-wing statements by talented, respected undergrounders like Ace do a disservice to women and to the underground. Women must be allowed a more interesting place in the punk scene if it is to overcome the boringness that Ace himself often complains about. Sorry, Ace.

It’s really obvious once one gives it some thought. Here’s a couple 1. A decidedly male trait, at least in ‘lender” adolescent years is the “fear of cock size.” Record collecting is simply a way for a male to increase his cock size. It makes perfect sense. The old American belief of 4he more the better” sums it up great. 2. Much like the penis, a record collec¬ tion spends most of its time just sitting there, immobile and rather stupid looking. Add to this the fact that one spends half his time trying to figure out just what the hell to do with it, and it becomes that much more obvious. 3. Guys, ever find yourself sitting there running your hand over your prized collec¬ tion/extension? There you have it, my great scientific find. Now, I know that females collect rec¬ ords also, and probably for different reasons, but after collecting, trading, and “extending” throughout puberty, my hypothesis makes perfect sense to me as a total male sexual release. Thanks for the space. Sincerely, Mark Pino/ Dumries, Va Hi Eric Yee, Thanks for the DC vinyl article, it was my-t-fine. Here are some “corrections”: 1) Iron Cross’ 7\"s came out on Skinflint not Skinflute (which only put out the two I.C. 7”s) 2) Ignition’s 2 singles and 12” came out on their own label “IG”—they were only distrib¬ uted by Sammich. ...And some additions: 1) Outside Records: put out Nuclear Crayons 12” and a comp, witn Social Suicide, Chalk Circle, United Mutation, Nuclear Crayone, etc. 2) Adult Contemporary: Pussy Galore 7”, Peach of Immortality Lp & 12” 3) Teen Beat: Unrest 2-7”s, LP, Flowers of Discipline 7\", Vomit Launch 7” EP. 4^ Peterbilt: Happy Go Licky 12”, Deadline Mark E. c/o Teen Beat/ PO Box 50255/ Washington, DC 20004 Dear Sirs: This “Scumpit” stuff has got to go - “record collecting'’ has been chic for some time now and I figure it’s about time for it to come to an end. Most of the records featured in “Scum Pit” are perfectly fine -1 just have a problem with perpetuating the trend of collecting rec¬ ords on the basis of rarity as opposed to content. This quote by \"East Bay Eric” on Chuck Wagon’s “Rock and Roll Won’t Go Away” 7” is typical, “...Very new-wavish (i.e., all key boards, wimpy, boring) it’s only re¬ deeming worth is that it’s on purple vinyl. But it still does make it worth finding.” The Styx album “Pieces of Eight” was available for a limited time in picture disk form. Does that make it worth finding? I suppose the argument for “Scum Pit” could be that it is offering information not readily available and helpful in avoiding rip offs. Anyone who cared an ounce could dig up the same info with a little research ana patience (the possibility of avoiding Eric’s inarticulate form should be incentive enough). Any Dork Benton owning a record solely for the color of the vinyl deserves to be ripped off. It’s really sad that the incredible rec¬ ords like the first Really Red singles are rare, but for various reasons, they are. It would be wonderful if everyone could own copies of them, but they can’t. I don’t know about you, but I’d like to see the copies that are out there in the hands of someone wildly appreciative of the music, not some cock hot to up the value of his collection. We’re not talking about postal stamps, you idiots. Fred Hughes/ PO Box 162113/ Sacto, CA 95816 Dear MRR fan club members: What is this world coming to? I went record-store-touring last night and for the first time became painfully aware of the expansion of the CD industry. One store I went into, as soon as you walk in the door, your’re faced with about five aisles of things to choose from. I hadn’t been in the store for a while and was a bit disoriented, so I walked up to the middle aisle - all CD’s. I hung a U at the end of the aisle and went down the next one - more CD’s and again - EVEN MORE. These aren’t just mainstream like U2 either - I was literally amazed to see Black Flag, The Avengers, JFA and the Dead Kenneays on CD. I don’t know anyone who can affora a CD player, not to mention dole out $16 smacks for a CD -1 can get about three used records for that! Alternative bands who are on CD only make it more difficult for their true fans to support them through buying their music. Well, okay, I suppose I can accept the fact that some of my favorite bands are CDing themselves, one might even say “selling out”, but I read in an article the other day the CD’s accounted for 55% of all music sales last year while vinyl accounted for only 10%. This is devastating to me because I am a record collector and what this means to me is that I’m gonna have to end up paying twice as much for a record as the aorm-room dorks are paying for a CD. As a result of my vinyl- shortage-Tear, I’ve been putting myself into debt by buying records at a fever pitch - I think I contributed to at least 6% of the 10% vinyl sales. Scary, isn’t it? Well, thanks for letting me gripe, Peggy/ SF, CA Dear MRR and readers, Before I start, I’ll tell you that this letter is about a common cause of complaint. It’s about come Engl, Yes, I’m another one of those suckers who’s being ripped off by them. Let me fill you in on some facts. Over half a year ago, I sent a cheque to them for three e.p.s. I even included alternative choices. As I say, that was six months ago, and about ten letters later, still no reply. Iknow they got my original letter with the cheque, because they cashed it. Mind you, it took them about two months to realize what it was and cash it. May I also point out that this company is run by a group of stench core fans, of which I found out too late. I bet my money was spent on < waytheyc who am I to say what’s what. Soplease take notice of me on one point - MANIC EARS are bigger cowboys than John Wayne ha ha, so dorr t waste your money, even for a stamp. Ok, thanks for your time, anyway. Tony, 19 Lynn Crescent, Cassop, Durham, DHG 4RH, England From: The Conditionz c/o Gregaie, 22568 Temco St., Moreno Valley, CA 92388. To Whoever reads this: Howdy! I hope this finds you all in good health and happiness found in whatever it is that gets you off. You take what you get and you find in it the good and learn to deal with the rest. Getting what you want and enjoying what you have are all part of the American dream. In relation to music and this on-going issue of club owners and band disputes, we all need to be co-operating to exist. “There is nos The quote comes f two national tours < live, eat, and survive by that rule. This is to all of you who have been, and will continue to be mistreated by clubs and their owners. Blow it off! Be thankful you have a venue to play at and go find another one. Or better yet, go back and get some more abuse. It will teach you respect for your \"scene” and may also do something for your self image. We played the Electric Banana twice on our first tour, for about $20 the first show and about $10 the second. With our next show in Kentucky cancelled and no funds to get to Chicago, you may think the above- mentioned quote is bullshit. To get by we donated plasma and arranged an impromptu show/ house party in Kent, Ohio, (thanx Sam!) What did we learn? We learned to appreciate a gig for what it is, not for what you want it to be. Bad mouthing the Banana is not the answer. The Conditionz went back. It was the same, only better. They fed us great homemade food and beered us sufficiently to calm our fears of not making enough cash to get to Boston the next day. The result was a staggering $25 and well wishes from Mr. Banana himself. But, alas we had a great time, played to George Romero (Dawn of the Dead) and got to go swimming and partying before our trip to Boston, (thanx Ellen!) Adapting, being able to survive on tour when faced with impossible odds is not fun. Being able to go on and finish, and to do it again is like sex, it makes you feel great and you always want more. If you talked shit or whatever it is that gets you off, it will stop providing that warm wet feeling you enjoy so much. Getting a fair shake in this world comes to those who work for it. Everyone else has only to complain about not getting one to receive their just reward. And, if you’re not satisfied with that, you’re more than welcome to come to L.A. and pay to play. Put that in you van and drive it! The Conditionz. Oh yeah...Look out America, hide your beer, we’re gonna do it again! We’ll keep you posted... Primal Lunch Records/10565 Cochran Ave/ Riverside, CA 92505 The following letter was submitted to CMJ, the college music journal, but they refused to print it. Since it contains many important points, MRR will print it for your comments. Tim Dear CMJ; We are writing to add to the comment made in the letter from Rob Lubjack of Per¬ manent Records. College radio has always been a major vehicle in the success and promotion of smaller or beginning artists, based on our recent experiences, it now seems that College radio has become noth¬ ing more than a playground for major labels dabbling with new arists, styles, or label names and designs. A glance at the College radio chart in your February 10 issue shows this clearly - only two independent labels are listed. The remainder are either major labels or smaller labels which are licensed through major labels. This certainly isn’t due to a lack of quality in the releases made by smaller labels - what this really shows is the power that major labels exert over college radio stations through marketing techniques that amounts to promotional blackmail. One of our people was present at a local college station whose playlist heavily featured independent records when the Program Director of that station received an angry call from a representative from one of the major labels. He threatened to cut them off from receiving promotional records un¬ less some of his records charted. College stations need promos to adequately cover and feature new music, so the program di¬ rector had no choice but to alter the playlist, showing records which otherwise would not have appeared. To cut off a college station from promotional mailings is to hand them a death sentence because college stations simply can’t afford to buy all of the new music that is coming out. The major label Gestapo who use this threat as a technique to produce results should realize that this is self-defeat¬ ing in the long run, because they end up wondering why listeners who apparently love a certain record just don’t seem to buy it. Smaller labels who depend on charts as indicators for future releases, and who use these to determine whch stations should receive promotional copies of their releases, suffer because their releases don’t appear in college playlists. The college stations suffer too, because smaller labels don’t send them promos if we never see any of our releases charted on their playlists. Step right up, folks. Everyone’s a loser! When college stations react to pres¬ sures from the record industry rather than to the interests of their audience, the culture suffers. College stations end up as minor- league teams tor commercial broadcasting, where payola reigns supreme and promo¬ tional releases from smaller labels generally vanish without a trace. We have seen play¬ lists, sent to different labels, where different records appear. This isn’t the way things are supposed to work! When BMI began to list records played on college radio stations and collect royalties for them, this initially ap¬ peared to be a boon to smaller artists whose domain is college radio. What has actually occurred is that, now that records played on college stations actually generate revenue, the major labels have moved in on college radio like sharks at the site of a shipwreck. The smaller labels who are just trying to survive, make a little money, and actually promote original, new music are once again the short term losers. The long term losers are the listeners, and anyone with any inter¬ est in the musical culture of America. Ordinarily, college radio stations pro¬ vide an infusion of freshness into music because their audience is the people who are learning, thinking, and doing things. When things work the way they’re supposed to, college radio stalions play tomorrow’s music today. Whenever rock and roll gains weight and starts to get tired and older, college Sta¬ tons provide the new music, as in the punk explosions of the sixties and seventies. This is not to say that College radio is a guile-less, elysian fields of broadcasting. A visit to your local used record store will show you just how many college promos end up as luncn money for someone from the station. It’s all right with us if reviewers for magazines choose to sell off records they might not play that often, because the records nave been reviewed and have served their purpose. However, when college radio statons sell their promos, they’re doing a dissservice to both the labels and to their audience, be¬ cause the records aren’t being played. Thanks for your time. Bill von Hagen, Gregg Kostelich, Dave Hall/ Get Hip Records ancfSkyclad Records Dear MRR, Haven’t picked up a copy of MRR in some time and I have to say that it looks good! I like the double size concept. And it’s good to see the classified section. Anyways, one of the reasons I’m writ¬ ing this - is to apologize to all my old penpals that I just quit writina with. I used to put out a ‘zine called Urinal Slime . My last issue was about a year and a half ago. I used to have a P.O. Box in Sumas Wa. I now live in Vancou¬ ver, BC. Anyhow... many people sent me letters and shit. As well many tapes were sent in to me for a compilation tape I was doing. Which never got done anyhow. To those people who sent tapes I will now play the stuff on a show I do on a local radio station, in the Vancouver area it’s called CJIV 94 FM cable (but by the time you read this I believe we’ll be on the air ana not just cable. We’re just waiting for all the legal stuff to go through. As well the new dial # will be 100.1, knocking off an American commercial station, (ha hal). Anyways, I play a lot of alternative music (mostly punk, hardcore and some metal) and if you nave something you want to go on our playlist, write and let me know. The playlist has quite a variety. Stuff like SNFU to stuff like FRONT 242 or even New Age (which I hate). But mostly of course it’s your standard college radio station (run from Simon Fraser University). As well I’m still doing a ‘zine which should be cool (of course I’m biased). The name is Who Cares!? . I just noticed in MRR #70 that there’s already one by the same name, but it’s too late to change now. We already have most of the stuff printed and ready to go under that name. And I thought it was an original idea, shit. Ah well. The issue will have stuff like Sacrifice, Sacred Reich, Sons Of Ishmael... and more! Oh., sorry didn’t mean to advertise there. Ok here’s the main reason I wrote: if fucking effort to do something. SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE MUSIC!! Andy Grotesque/ 2120 Rupert St./ Vancou¬ ver, BC V5M 3S7/ Canada P.S. My show airs Friday nights from midnite to 6am. So tune in and request if you live in the area! And there’s lots of good shows on CJIV) P.P.S. Look out for my band, Gods Of Violent Death. We should have a demo done soon) Dear MRR, I am writing concerning some big time Bullshit. My sister was recently in Toronto and while there, she bought the Youth of Today We’re not in this alone LP I had heard the album before that from my friend Cory, who had the LP.What I liked about the album so much was the superb sound quality, un¬ like the first 7 H and LP. So, when my sister g ave the record to me, I was quite content. ut the happiness soon turned to anger as I put the album on my turntable.The sound was extremely terrible, and it sounded like a different mix than my friend’s copy. Why was my copy fucked, and my pal s good? It certainly wasn’t my needle because I tried the disc on my parents’ turntable and it still sounded shitty. So I wrote Caroline Records to see if I could possibly exchange my shitbag LP for a decently pressed copy or get a refund. But to no surprise, I did not get a response. So, Caroline Records is some big fuckin’ record pressing tightwad corppration too big to spend a measly $8.00 to give me another LP or a refund, much less 450 to write me a letter! I would write Youth Of Today, but something tells me that they couldn’t really give a shit about what’s going on. Has anyone else got the same prob¬ lem? Will I see justice and human decency? For now, Caroline Records can just eat my shit and fuck off but I am hoping that in the near future I will be saying Thank you” for a new record or a refund.

Within a month of the King s Cross tube disaster, we, the Bile Ducts, had wrote and recorded lines like “Michael Jackson impersonators/deco¬ rate the escalators/ I see cooking but no waiters/ not my idea of fun/1 used to think I had it made/ but now I’ve turned a darker shade/ and I’m surrounded by the fire bri- ade/ I’m a hot King’s Cross bun!” - it’s not arming anyone cos relatives of the dead will never get to hear us, and you can’t bring them back. Underneath, nearly everyone’s got a bit of sick humour in them but their conscience won’t let it come out.

Bile Ducts HQ/19 Laburnum Ave/ Blackhill, Consett, Co. Durham/ England Dear Juliet Jake and MRR people, I’d like to tell you a story, but I’m sure that you won’t care because I’m a “man”. Why don’t you drop your stereotypes and listen to me as a person , which is what I am. You’re Just as sexist as all the men that you complain about. I’m 15. I have blonde hair, long braids plus an earring. I like to wear ban¬ danas. I’m notavery \"masculine”typeof guy. I shuffle/ slide my feet when I walk like girls do. I hate violence, guns, cars, and beer guzzlers. So of course a lot of people think of me as a \"fag”. Today I was walking down the hall in school with my favorite white bandana hang¬ ing out of my pocket. These two seniors, Scott and Ron, came up and stole my ban¬ dana. I’m about 5’8” and pretty thin. Scott is about my size (though he is very much stronger since he lifts weights), but Ron is hugef He must be about 6’4\". Why do I care about height? Becaue I want you to under¬ stand that this is a case of a wimpy type of person getting beaten upon by some big and nasty people. I said \"Scott, give me my bandana.” He sort of laughed maliciously and threw it over my head to Ron. They threw it back and forth a couple of times. I, suicidally, pushed Scott very hard. He turned around and threw my bandana over my head. I was suffering from a massive adrenalin rush so I can’t quite remember how everything went but it doesn’t really matter. Some guy who’s sort of a teacner came out ana grabbed Scott and dragged him away. This was very lucky for me, oecause Scott would have nothing against beating me up in public. I started snouting obscenities at Ron. He came over and tola me to shut up. I said \"Why do you ick on me? Why do you think it’s so cool to >eat me up when you already know that you can?” Ron didn’t have much to say until later, when he saw me going up the stairs. He grabbed me and thrust me against a wall. He started complaining that I had embarrassed him and other stuff. After thinking about it I’ve decided that he’s right. Ron doesn’t want to have a reputation as a bully, Scott could care less. Ana the only reason that this ever happened is because I got so worked up. Aggressiveness is not a male trait by birth, just as reasoning ability isn’t. It is bred into us, which is a crime against everyone. As the awesome Bazooka ioe said, aggression and domination=masculinity. I haven’t been able to escape the male stereotype as a whole. If I could stay calm when I get teased it would be great. I could really be nonviolent. But it’s something that I have to work on. I guess that I got off my original point, but I hope that you can understand what I’m saying. You criticize Dave for \"not looking at if from a womyn’s point of view,” well look at if from a person’s point of view. If you ever want equality of all people, then you can’t just t liberate any single group! It has to be as a whole. Wake up Junet. Everyone, write! Jeremy Piper/ 3 Beacon St/ Reading, MA 01861 Dear Anti-Censorshipists: Music is nottheonly thing getting nailed for everything lately. Fans of obscure horror films have been subjected to edited versions of films that should nave contained over the top violence. As editor of a popular NY sleaze film zine, Stink . I’m here to stick up for a proposed A rating. This rating means non- pornographic adult filmfare. I’ve been a fan of Horror and the obscure since 1978,and it seems that this genre of films has always been big in the punk/core world. I am asking anyone who cares to please send me your signature and address. We already have collected (since Feb, 1989) 500 plus signa¬ tures that will be mailed to the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) this coming November,1989. If the A rating is given to us, we all can enjoy super violent, uncut and action cinema at its finest. Let’s help another media get rid of censorship. Besides, how can we enjoy a Third installment of the Toxic Avenger with¬ out the eye gougings and arm rippings? Nick Barracato/27 Hillcrest St/Staten Island, NY 10308 P.S. Don’t hesitate!! Send in your sig¬ natures now. To MRR and all readers, About two years ago, I was going through an issue of MRR and came across a particular zine from \" Between the Lions”. It was an underground magazine from Ham¬ burg, W. Germany, and the description inter¬ ested me a lot so I decided to send away for it. After receiving the zine (along with a responding letter) from the man who designs it, I kept close contact with him and we fre¬ quently wrote each other back. About a year later (now last spring) I wrote in one letter to him, that I would be in Germany all summer staying with my relatives, who live near Frank¬ furt. He wrote me back saying that it would be nice if we could meet while I was over there and he invited me to stay with him and his family sometime during my trip. As it turned out I did get to meet him and lived with his family in HH for about a month. He was very sweet and friendly and I became a close part of the family. I enjoyed my stay with them a lot, because he took me around the city and showed me many interesting things. We even made visits to other cities, such as Amsterdam and Berlin. As we got to know each other better, we found that we had similar tastes, not only in music, but in art and also some beliefs (we both are vegetarians). He took me to a lot of cool punk concerts and I got to meet many nice people, some which became friends. His parents were just abso¬ lutely great. They made me feel comfortable and I loved talking with them and being a part of their lives. I became to them, the daughter they never had and they made me feel spe¬ cial and always made sure that I was having a good time. 1 now have the best memories of my stay in Europe. I don’t think I would have had as good of a time, if I didn’t become good friends with my penpal and got to stay with him and his family. They will always be a part of my life now, because I never met sweeter people. So I guess what I am trying to say is (1) Thanks ever so much MRR, if it wasn’t tor your magazine I would have never found my friend’s address and (2) Readers, this is the best way to make new friends (both conti¬ nental and international) and get opportuni¬ ties to correspond and learn about (and from) others and snare neat things. Get involved!!!. One never knows what excitement can come out of it. T SchuB! lrmgod/5185 N. River/ Freeland, Ml 48623 TO: Mvkel Board, O.K. Board: Yeah, you have succeeded in stirring sentiments up with your April \"How To Love An Animal” bit. Yes, you succeeded in looking like the great instigator, the great controversy-maker, but still...no luck in making humane-minded people look like the sentimental nitwits you’d assumed you had. And yeah, you were funny but too bad you can’t be taken seriously. Andrea/ NYC Dear MRR, It had been quite a while since I last picked up a copy of MRR (three years to be exact). I guess when I left my population 2,000 hometown I left a lot behind me. My views had changed and I realized that knowl¬ edge is power. Yea, I went to college. Anyhow, I was buying a couple of cassettes the other day (R.E.M. and the new one from the Replacements—my musical taste may have also changed) and I saw a Max R and R sitting on the counter and bought it to take a quick trip down memory lane. It is amazing how long things stick in your head. It occurred to me that no matter now much I had changed, my ideas, beliefs and attitudes remained constant. Now to the point of this letter. In #69 there was a lot of bitching about what the movement was becoming. It bothered me to read letters bashing people who are simply sharing their points of view. People were complaining about what others were wear¬ ing!! C’mon, grow up a little. Of course there was the usual \"gee Whiz!!! nobody wants to have fun anymore” letters. I guess I can relate. I wish I was in a basement somewhere watching “Suburbia” for the first time with the K . I wish Doug hadn’t moved out of \"the e” on the East Side. I wish we were still skateboarding in the city parking lot listening to M.D.C. I wish we were still dreaming about putting together the band that never got off the ground. I wish we could all still get by working part-time jobs to buy beer, records, and have enough left over to roadtrip to see shows at the Seventh Street Entry. I wish Kevin wouldn’t have missed a corner while doing 10Omph. I wish... Okay, get the point? Times change. Change is inevitable. It’s about time we quit wishing about what we would like the movement to be. It is time to unite again. Remember unity? It is what this is all based on — working together. Or maybe youthoughtthis was about kids having fun ana dressing funny to scare our parents. Let’s pull together and fight the Nazi movement, homophobia, racism, or what¬ ever we see that is wrong with the system. Maybe you \"older folks” can show the new¬ comers how much fun we used to have. I guess if we’re not willing to pull to¬ gether I put a lot of energy and faith in something that was doomed from the day the Sex Pistols let us know that unemployed middle class youth have the power to work for change. Swenny/ Madison, Wl .North of STEVE BEAUMONT. I am pissed off! Several days ago (I'm writing this in early April) an Exxon oil tanker dumped a quarter of a million barrels of oil in the ocean off the coast of Alaska. This tanker was captained by a man with a history of impaired-driving convictions and skippered at the time by an unqualified third mate. The damage to the delicate Alaskan environment will oe immeasurable and last¬ ing, the price will be paid in much more than dollars. Yet where is the public outcry? It's stuck in the gullet of an ^oh-so-concerned\" public who \"deeply cares about the environ¬ ment\" but only as long as it doesn't cramp their lifestyle! Thus far—and I'm not hold¬ ing my breath for further action—there has been no indictment of Exxon's irresponsibil¬ ity and remarkably little concern voiced by any level of government in either Canada or the U.S.. In other words, nobody seems to give a damn on either side of the border! This is an absolute outrage! Everyday yet! clean-up has barely even commenced eleven days after the disaster! The most decisive action taken thus far by George Bush has been to send a few government officials to Alaska to \"oversee the operation\", whatever the hell that means! And the best the Mul- roney government can do is announce that they can't tell whether or not the spill will reach Canadian waters and, thus, cannot commit themselves to any action. I tell you, if this weren't so tragic, it would be comedic. All Exxon will do is write off the losses in their annual report (which shouldn't affect their huge profits too much) and go back to shipping oil in exactly the same way as be¬ fore. Six months from now, all we'll have to remember Valdez from is a destroyed Alas¬ kan ecology and, perhaps, a faint memory. Of course, this won't greatly concern the politicians since they don't stand for re-elec¬ tion for four years and the leaders on both sides of the border can happily go back to declaring themselves as environmentalists. However, the Valdez disaster—the judge who set Captain Hazelwood's bond at $1 million correctly compared the degree of destruction to that of Hiroshima—is just the tip of the iceberg. The one bit of good this incident has provided is that we may now see exactly how important the environment is to our elected officials and the public-at- large. Let me set out what should have happened after the Valdez cracked-up: The U.S. administration immediately orders a full-scale clean-up and containment effort and rules that the Exxon corporation must pay for it all but will not be the overseers. The Canadian government responds in kind by offering its services—again, at the ex¬ pense of Exxon—to assist m the clean-up and, at the same time, prepares an impene¬ trable blockade to prevent the spill from entering Canadian waters if it extends that far. After, and only after, the spill has been dealt with to the greatest degree possible, both governments orchestrate a multi-na¬ tional committee to set stringent rules on, and develop alternatives to, oil tanker use. And, of course, all officials connected to the oil spill are fairly tried and punished accord¬ ingly, from the mate at the nelm to as high in Exxon's corporate structure as possible. That is what should happen after an oil spill such as the Valdez. What will happen is that the Captain will be the scapegoat, the Alaskan environment will be irreperably damaged, a couple of committees will be forced to produce white papers on oil ship¬ ment, ana the whole thing will be forgotten. This is typical of the way our society deals with envirnomental problems; a lot of talk and virtually no action. I'm even willing to bet that the vast majority of the people read¬ ing this are doing very little to slow the current ecological crisis though they may discuss it at length. Concern is easy, action takes a little more work. So what can you do? Well, here's a starter list of things an environmentally- conscious person can do to make an impact. Note this is not a definitive inventory—I'm local, district, provincial, state, and federal governments expressing your concern over tne state of the environment and demand that action be taken. If your city or town doesn't have a recycling program, demand one be instituted. Find out and boycott companies which foul the ecology (starting with Exxon) and write them to let the of¬ fender know. Buy only products which use a minimum of packaging and, again, let the offenders know. Patronize only supermar¬ kets which use paper bags or, betteryet, take your own bags when you shop. This part could go on and on, but I think by now the point is clear; use your power as a consumer and a citizen to pressure for environmental responsibility. RE USE - Before you throw anything out, think if it can be used again. My bet is that you'll be surprised at how much your garbage is reduced! A few suggestions to start: Styrofoam trays (which you really shouldn't buy in the first place because they are CFC producers), egg cartons, (ditto for the styrofoam ones) ana toilet paper rolls can be saved for public schools to be used in crafts. Plastic containers can be washed and re-used. Typing paper can be cut up for note pads and artists or libraries will be grateful for old magazines. This list is also endless, use your imagination. COMPOST - It may surprise you to learn that many homes around the world have two garbage cans, one for regular trash and one for \"wet\" garbage. Compost heaps are easy to make and beneficial to the envi¬ ronment in their fertilizer content. Find out how from a local environmental agency and start your own right away! RECYCLE -Newspapers, glass jars and bottles, and tin cans are all recyclable. Find out where you can go to drop them off in your community and, as I noted earlier, encourage your local government to start a door-to-door recycling program. This is perhaps the easiest way to be environmen¬ tally conscious yet it is drastically under¬ used. You can also speed the process by buying recyclable containers, using recycled products, and encouraging local newspa Fh e ers to use recycled newsprint. The more, he merrier! WALK/CYCLE - Aside from being good for you, walking and bicycling instead of driving helps the ecology too. And, if you're lazy, take public transit or car-pool. You'll soon find that leaving the car at home will benefit your wallet and your waistline also. As I noted at the outset, this list is just a starting-point. The most important thing is that you become aware of what you are doing and how it affects the world in which you five. And, yes, keep talking, but follow it up with some action! ENDNOTE: At this point I would like to make an unapologetic plug for a great magazine. It's called Zeta Magazine and it's the best leftist mag I've seen for a long, long time. In addition to great articles by authors such as Stockwell ana Chomsky, Zeta covers popular culture in a way that no other pub¬ lication that I know of can match. Its address is : Zeta Mag azine / 150 W. Canton St./ “ Boston, MA 02118. The most hideous sentence ever ut¬ tered by an attractive person to his or her attractee is LET’S JUST BE FRIENDS. Why don't you ever hear, \"Let’s just fuck and be passing acquaintances?\" or ''We'll just screw and never go out and have a good time to¬ gether?\" or \"I really don't want to be your friend anymore, but at least we can still spill the juices.\" Nope, that never happens. It's al¬ ways, \"Let’s just be friends. Friends? Friends! I've got friends up the butt! I want to reverse that situation! Yes, it's been another rough month with a new tragedy every day. (This was a different person from last month! Oh well, I come, they go.) Anyway, I bet things'll change when I return as a rich man from my summer vacation. I'll never have to work again. A simple thousand bucks invested in an Uzi, good bye Mr. Rushdie, hello big bucks from the Ayatollah! No more stupid problems once Fm rich. I'll bet. Until then, I've been having music as well as girl problems. Take the three day NYC Scumfest, please! If you're interested in the full Scumfest story, it'll probably appear in Jersey Beat magazine. All I want to say about it now is that I feel like Dr. Frankenstein with this scumrock shit. Oh well, what could I have expected? It is scum after all.

What third worlders want a piece of my MRR is anti-straight edge! I've heard or seen this statement a lot lately. My response? Bullshit! To those that feel this way, I'd like to point out a few things. First fact: most of the staffers at MRR are indeed straight edge, meaning that they don't drink or do drugs, are vegetarian or vegan, and are clear thinkers. They have been this way for a long time, too. Brian Edge, Martin Sprouse, Katia, etc. are longtime adherents of this outlook. I smoke tobacco, but that's it. Walter, Chuck, Joel Wing, Chris Dodge, and John Yates are about as clean cut as you can get. Mike LaVella is a longtime friend to the whole DC approach. The list goes on. Second fact: most of the staffers at MRR liked and respected the early SE bands and the sound they pioneered. Read any old MRR to verify this. Third: what many of the reviewers at MRR don't relate to with many of the current SE releases is the following: 1) They are extremely unoriginal and imitative, while simultaneously professing individuality and creative growth. 2) They are divisive and \"hard\", while simultaneously professing unity and humanity. 3) Most bana members are of a very young age and are quite judge¬ mental, while very few of them have gone outside the suburban envelope provided by mommy and daddy and experienced a test of time on their beliefs. 4) Many band mem¬ bers have shown themselves to be very self¬ ish and self-serving, and have not even come close to practicing what they preached. I have seen this countless times on a firsthand basis, both through working with these bands at Gilman and with lodging them at MRR's house. 5) Straight edge is a fine beginning to growth, but the range of subject matter and emotions explored are infinitesimally nar-| row, and that gets old fast when pushed in i such a self-rignteous manner. MRR has always applauded those trying to clean up their act as part of a process of growing and learning and becoming more constructive. But when, in the name of \"purity\", people become conservative and narrow-minded, become insecure and shrill know-it-alls that act more like sheep than human beings, then they'll find little sup¬ port here. SE has also become (and maybe always contained the seeds of this malaise) an all¬ male \"club\", limited to a jock-like clique where there's no room for any expression of warm emotion or sensitive sensuality asso¬ ciated with the female side of all of us . This typifies what I personally don't like about the \"professional\" straight edgers. OK, OK, maybe it is just a stage of growth, a male bonding phase where guys just want to be with guys and forget about their awkward burgeoning sexuality, where girls are kept on tne sidelines like cheerleaders. If it's just a teenage phase, then admit it and don't get all uptight and self-righteous about others who don't want to share in that sweaty es¬ cape. And if it's not just a phase, then there's something seriously wrong and dangerous about being so \"proud\" about a scene that excludes so many and limits real free and clear thinking. I'd rather view SE on a case-by-case basis, and there are a few individuals in¬ volved in the current scene who command my respect. Dan of No For An Answer seems to want to grapple with the larger issues of life. I single him out because he's trying to get beyond the rhetoric. Maybe some of Larm were that way, and maybe a few others who I've forgotten here or never met. And of course there are people like Martin (remem¬ ber him, from Leading Edg e days?) and Ian and Chris Bald and Cynthia Connolly and Lydia and lots of people from the early DC scene who command my respect because they continually try to expand their beliefs into the realm of reality, who strive to prac¬ tice what they preach and know that actions speak much much louder than words. They are not now, nor have they ever been, sheep. It is the rare individual one can look to for inspiration, not a bunch of cliches. But I can find individuals in just about any sub-scene that have earned my love and admiration. So, if the \"great mass\" of anar¬ chists hate MRR for being too conservative, that's fine. And if the great mass of fascists hate MRR for being too red, that's cool. And if the great mass of drinkers/druggies hate MRR for being too straight, that's ok. And if the great mass of funsters hate MRR for being too political, that's hot. But there are individuals who spiritually reside in all those camps who can see beyond the narrow con¬ fines, who can appreciate MRR for trying to take a common sense and balanced approach, and who we can respect as well. Ana that's fucking excellent. W 1 LOW LEVEL PROMOTION GUIDE Low level promotion bylaw: \"After all, without a series of small disasters, Jennifer, we'd have nothing\"-Jet Screamer, ABC No Rio, 1988. Being a low-level promoter is like constantly begging everyone in the world to go on a date, and being turned down most of the time. Let me start the guide properly. I sort of grew up in a couple of San Francisco nightclubs. Mabuhay Gardens and the Deaf Club (which I hear is having HomoCore shows now?). I hung out every night, and always was able to sneak in, steal beers, get in fights, perform, and know practically everybody. I played a prominent role in my own night life, and it spoiled me for life. I've only been to two stadium shows, and never want to go again. They treated everybody like potentially violent maniacs, frisked us for weapons, shoved us, herded us, charged us, and in return I got to see a micro-dot version of a celebrity that may once have been as exciting as all of the local celebrities I got to see every night. Even worse were bill Graham shows, where even the most ardent masochist would lose pa¬ tience with being told to stand, sit, move, buy, pay, and not steal backstage food! I'm SURE the Psychedelic Furs really needed that huge wheel of Brie while they were in town for 5 hours. When I moved to New York I coat checked in a huge disco called the World, and went to scummy open mike nights at ABC No Rio. The World was intense in a sleazy mafia, druggy, what famous person is here tonight, how close can the model get to the homeboy without the system breaking down, kind of way. No Rio was fun, but sometimes too intense as a group of bag ladies, street people.

First I had Sparkly Glam Readings, then bands, at No Rio. Right in the middle of a desperate real estate crunch sat the crum¬ bling^ ladlyrunVy exhausted unpaid tors.True to the American spirit, practically nobody was doing a thing in it. I don't think Americans really want to be free. I think they want a land ruler, a good boss^a fair teacher, someone to complain about. The good thing about this is that they're fairly easy to domi¬ nate if anybody has the energy. So it's not hard to put on a show. If there was a space like that in the least roomy Armeggedon in the Western World, chances are there's one wherever you live too. THEME As an unpopular kid, my very first / had a strained and uncomfortable theme, and few guests. I didn't really like anybody enough to want them to feel com¬ fortable anyway. The idea of a poetry read¬ ing with a glamour element was enough to make everyone feel uncomfortable for a start, and as I grew as a promoter I was able to combine unpleasant themes. I think my best night at No Rio was a HUNK READING/ TRIBUTE TO THE BOROUGHS. My jock poet friends were humiliated to be thought of as \"Hunks\", one of their surly friends threw a beer bottle at the painting exhibit and had to be thrown out, and the body builder/frisbee champion/poets scurried out right after the show as if to erase the whole event from their minds. One of the poets only read because I'd managed to keep the theme a secret from him. The Tribute to The Boroughs was an equally awkward theme. I had started to discover that I really liked people from outside of Manhattan better than the nervous career-minded cos¬ mopolitans themselves, and I had Surfer Joe, Big Drag, and Jet Screamer perform with their band the Jurassics. They thrilled me by constantly surfing in polluted restricted beach areas, and one night I reached a peak by intoning their motto to the audience: \"After all, what are the chances that a needle's going to actually poke ya?\"-Surfer Joe, Gas Station, '88— right before having Surfer Joe Automic launch into a long, drawn out read¬ ing of surf cards he'd collected while Big Drag yelped and played Bongos. A tinny small Doom boom box played cheap surf music into a cheaper mike, and Jet Screamer clacked somethin^nv^^background. Now you have a theme, it's time to make the flyer! Jet makes the worst ones I've ever seen, except for one I made in a hurry with a Buddhist I met in a 24 hour copy shop He actually once got three spelling errors in one flyer! I started out with cut and paste flyers my friend Sami and I made for the readings, and lonj that we knew wou x ^ w \"We searched Long Island, Queens, and New Jersey relentlessly for this new talent from the Boroughs....'. Once I had a rejection party that was all my rejection letters pasted together. It was great! Nobody came, I handed bewildered strangers chapters of my unpub¬ lished manuscripts, and the flyer alienated my two remaining friends in publishing through what they construed as a vicious attack on the industry. I was also able to mix in a rejection from the New Yorker with one from Hustler, and a muddy xerox of my ID with the especially loserjsh quote: This card is not a license to drive. Now 1 found a little computer company that lasers in images, zaps them around, and can make any print, but instead of paying I always bring a beer and some Dontoes and try to create a fun hang out atmosphere in the small struggling company, and no w one of the partners won t let me in the door any more!!! Flyers have so little value that they ve become sublime. In New York you get zO glossy cards from club kid promoters every time you step out the door. They promise you free admission, cocktails, gifts, and wild 8 theme evenings in huge corporate discos. They mean less than nothing, and I've been thinking of inventing a wrist clamp flyer trap that would snap on their wrists and disarm their flyer hand. Big Clubs can afford tons of glossy flyers ana cards and free drinks because tney are such huge anonymous corporations that if the ten free people shill one confused sucker into paying $4 for a beer, $15 to get in, $2 for a coat check, etc., they can still make a profit. MONEY I make money through low-level pro¬ motion now, but I've been doing it for two years pretty constantly, and the time/exper- tisc-moncy ratio is bizarre, uneven. It's not so much money you want sometimes as crowds, anyway, and it's better to have a crowd paying 3 or even 2 bucks than a room that's empty because nobody wanted to pay 5. Money takes on more of a token status. If I get $70 for promoting a huge show in a big theater, and performing. I'm thrilled. Gro¬ ceries and subway tokens fora week! If I can give a performer $6, it's a sign of respect. It makes people feel good in a market that's cram packed with glamorous budding en¬ tertainers and barely any audience mem¬ bers. I felt great when I got $8 for reading in the Lismar Lounge on a Sunday afternoon. It sounds corny but it felt better than getting a thousand for doing something I didn't want to do. My friends and I probably pass the same money back and forth constantly, be¬ cause when you know all the dynamics of putting on a small show you would rather cough up the $3-$5, if you can, than scam your way in. I don't sell alcohol at my shows. The owner of the Burlesque theater I book would get busted in a hot second if I did it there, and although I could get a one night liquor license (I think you register yourself I as a non-profit business for $33 or some¬ thing?) I'm not very busincssy and I don't have a car and hauling large amounts of beer and ice around Manhattan always sound too exhausting. If you live somewhere that is less police ridden than S.F., LA, or NYC it would probably be easier to set yourself up with a garbage can of beer. Also, in big cities it's too easy tor someone to iusteo to a corner store and buy a beer for a buck, I bet in the suburbs it would be harder so you could sell more. I prefer the tightrope act of trying to actually entertain or scare people who aren't loaded and arc trying to focus on my twisted idea of entertainment. ENTERTAINMENT Just about any real person is more entertaining than someone pretending to be real. Hardcore Punk/Suburban Jocks with matching outfits, girlfriends, and thousands of dollars of equipment can be a bland snore compared to one person who knows how to give a good reading. ABC NO RIO has been a good training ground for a lot of people, and I think there should be one in every town. Mathew Courtney runs an open mike every Sunday. People sign up to perform at 6:45 sharp, and there is one featured pre¬ former. Everyone donates a dollar if tney can. The level is pretty hardcore, you can t just get up after a tougn old woman's blown you away with her schizophrenic ranting and be lame. If you are bad, the audi- to keep coming back until you are good, there is no better training. Entertainment is the truth, even Sammy Davis Jr. is not lying. Only lies are dull. I have bands, solo musi¬ cians, industrial folk, poets, dancers, and of course myself perform constantly, and bands are my least favorite to deal with. There is a bigger disaster level. Bulky expensive equip¬ ment, noise complaints, infighting, jockey¬ ing for time slots, as well as the fact that it's hard to tell five people who have just moved an entire PA somewhere to play only 15 min¬ utes, and they can go on forever. But I CAN put on shows with hands, and I don't know a thing about equipment and never carry anythin ^ ’ ,r 11 ’ excuse i I hate it when I start sounding political, but it is true that if you don't like the way just not that hard to put Everytime that I deal with a corporate level, things go wrong. Big radio stations are assholeish and bewildering to deal with, KPFA (S.F./Berkeley), FMU (New Jersey) and WBAI (NYC), all underground shows, are incredibly easy to deal with. They let me talk for a while, not in an unnatural one minute spurt, and they are happy rather than upset if you have something to babble about. Big clubs always give me their cards when they come to one of my shows, and then they don't return my calls, forget my appointment, or act like Frank from Blue Velvet when I show up. They don't really need a thinking promoter, anyway, they're selling escape, not reality: Booming house music, pitch darkness, alcohol, vaguely S&M ritual admission policies. Big magazines deal with me strangely and fearfully while small weeklies and fanzines let me do whatever I want, and the small record label I'm on, 109, just mixed my cheap little 8 track recording instead of giving me a lecture on my unpro¬ fessionalism. And it was easier to do six songs on the 8 track at a small studio than to deal with 24 track jingle engineers on co¬ caine fiddling with one song for eight hours. Cable TV Shows are fun to be on and also easy to create and air, while the only time I f et on national TV is when I'm lying my ead off on panel talk shows as part of a free trip and lunch scam. As somewhat of a materialist I hate to "
