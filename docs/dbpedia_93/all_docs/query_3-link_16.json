        "text": "Victor D López Dec 2018\n\nYou were born five years before the Spanish Civil War that would see your father exiled.\n\nLanguage came later to you than your little brother Manuel. And you stuttered for a time.\n\nUnlike those who speak incessantly with nothing to say, you were quiet and reserved.\n\nYour mother mistook shyness for dimness, a tragic mistake that scarred you for life.\n\nWhen your brother Manuel died at the age of three from meningitis, you heard your mom\n\nExclaim: “God took my bright boy and left me the dull one.” You were four or five.\n\nYou never forgot those words. How could you? Yet you loved your mom with all your heart.\n\nBut you also withdrew further into a shell, solitude your companion and best friend.\n\nYou were, in fact, an exceptional child. Stuttering went away at five or so never to return,\n\nAnd by the time you were in middle school, your teacher called your mom in for a rare\n\nConference and told her that yours was a gifted mind, and that you should be prepared\n\nFor university study in the sciences, particularly engineering.\n\nShe wrote your father exiled in Argentina to tell him the good news, that your teachers\n\nBelieved you would easily gain entrance to the (then and now) highly selective public university\n\nWhere seats were few, prized and very difficult to attain based on merit-based competitive\n\nExams. Your father’s response? “Buy him a couple of oxen and let him plow the fields.”\n\nThat reply from a highly respected man who was a big fish in a tiny pond in his native Oleiros\n\nOf the time is beyond comprehension. He had apparently opted to preserve his own self-\n\nInterest in having his son continue his family business and also work the family lands in his\n\nAbsence. That scar too was added to those that would never heal in your pure, huge heart.\n\nLeft with no support for living expenses for college (all it would have required), you moved on,\n\nDisappointed and hurt, but not angry or bitter; you would simply find another way.\n\nYou took the competitive exams for the two local military training schools that would provide\n\nAn excellent vocational education and pay you a small salary in exchange for military service.\n\nOf hundreds of applicants for the prized few seats in each of the two institutions, you\n\nScored first for the toughest of the two and thirteenth for the second. You had your pick.\n\nYou chose Fabrica de Armas, the lesser of the two, so that a classmate who had scored just\n\nBelow the cut-off at the better school could be admitted. That was you. Always and forever.\n\nAt the military school, you were finally in your element. You were to become a world-class\n\nMachinist there—a profession that would have gotten you well paid work anywhere on earth\n\nFor as long as you wanted it. You were truly a mechanical genius who years later would add\n\nElectronics, auto mechanics and specialized welding to his toolkit through formal training.\n\nGiven a well-stocked machine shop, you could reverse engineer every machine without\n\nBlueprints and build a duplicate machine shop. You became a gifted master mechanic\n\nAnd worked in line and supervisory positions at a handful of companies throughout your life in\n\nArgentina and in the U.S., including Westinghouse, Warner-Lambert, and Pepsi Co.\n\nYou loved learning, especially in your fields (electronics, mechanics, welding) and expected\n\nPerfection in everything you did. Every difficult job at work was given to you everywhere you\n\nWorked. You would not sleep at night when a problem needed solving. You’d sketch\n\nAnd calculate and re-sketch solutions and worked even in your dreams with singular passion.\n\nYou were more than a match for the academic and physical rigors of military school,\n\nBut life was difficult for you in the Franco era when some instructors would\n\nDeprecatingly refer to you as “Roxo”—Galician for “red”-- reflecting your father’s\n\nSupport for the failed Republic. Eventually, the abuse was too much for you to bear.\n\nOnce while standing at attention in a corridor with the other cadets waiting for\n\nRoll call, you were repeatedly poked in the back surreptitiously. Moving would cause\n\nDemerits and demerits could cause loss of points on your final grade and arrest for\n\nSuccessive weekends. You took it awhile, then lost your temper.\n\nYou turned to the cadet behind you and in a fluid motion grabbed him by his buttoned jacket\n\nAnd one-handedly hung him up on a hook above a window where you were standing in line.\n\nHe thrashed about, hanging by the back of his jacket, until he was brought down by irate Military instructors.\n\nYou got weekend arrest for many weeks and a 10% final grade reduction.\n\nA similar fate befell a co-worker a few years later in Buenos Aires who called you a\n\n*******. You lifted him one handed by his throat and held him there until\n\nYour co-workers intervened, forcibly persuading you to put him down.\n\nThat lesson was learned by all in no uncertain terms: Leave Felipe’s mom alone.\n\nYou were incredibly strong, especially in your youth—no doubt in part because of rigorous farm\n\nWork, military school training and competitive sports. As a teenager, you once unwisely bent\n\nDown to pick something up in view of a ram, presenting the animal an irresistible target.\n\nIt butted you and sent you flying into a haystack. It, too, quickly learned its lesson.\n\nYou dusted yourself off, charged the ram, grabbed it by the horns and twirled it around once,\n\nThrowing it atop the same haystack as it had you. The animal was unhurt, but learned to\n\nGive you a wide berth from that day forward. Overall, you were very slow to anger absent\n\nHead-butting, repeated pokings, or disrespectful references to your mom by anyone.\n\nI seldom saw you angry and it was mom, not you, who was the disciplinarian, slipper in hand.\n\nThere were very few slaps from you for me. Mom would smack my behind with a slipper often\n\nWhen I was little, mostly because I could be a real pain, wanting to know/try/do everything\n\nCompletely oblivious to the meaning of the word “no” or of my own limitations.\n\nMom would sometimes insist you give me a proper beating. On one such occasion for a\n\nForgotten transgression when I was nine, you took me to your bedroom, took off your belt, sat\n\nMe next to you and whipped your own arm and hand a few times, whispering to me “cry”,\n\nWhich I was happy to do unbidden. “Don’t tell mom.” I did not. No doubt she knew.\n\nThe prospect of serving in a military that considered you a traitor by blood became harder and\n\nHarder to bear, and in the third year of school, one year prior to graduation, you left to join\n\nYour exiled father in Argentina, to start a new life. You left behind a mother and two sisters you\n\nDearly loved to try your fortune in a new land. Your dog thereafter refused food, dying of grief.\n\nYou arrived in Buenos Aires to see a father you had not seen for ten years at the age of 17.\n\nYou were too young to work legally, but looked older than your years (a shared trait),\n\nSo you lied about your age and immediately found work as a Machinist/Mechanic first grade.\n\nThat was unheard of and brought you some jealousy and complaints in the union shop.\n\nThe union complained to the general manager about your top-salary and rank. He answered,\n\n“I’ll give the same rank and salary to anyone in the company who can do what Felipe can do.”\n\nNo doubt the jealousy and grumblings continued by some for a time. But there were no takers.\n\nAnd you soon won the group over, becoming their protected “baby-brother” mascot.\n\nYour dad left for Spain within a year or so of your arrival when Franco issued a general pardon\n\nTo all dissidents who had not spilt blood (e.g., non combatants). He wanted you to return to\n\nHelp him reclaim the family business taken over by your mom in his absence with your help.\n\nBut you refused to give up the high salary, respect and independence denied you at home.\n\nYou were perhaps 18 and alone, living in a single room by a schoolhouse you had shared with Your dad.\n\nBut you had also found a new loving family in your uncle José, one of your father’s Brothers, and his family. José, and one of his daughters, Nieves and her\n\nHusband, Emilio, and\n\nTheir children, Susana, Oscar (Ruben Gordé), and Osvaldo, became your new nuclear family.\n\nYou married mom in 1955 and had two failed business ventures in the quickly fading\n\nPost-WW II Argentina of the late 1950s and early 1960s.The first, a machine shop, left\n\nYou with a small fortune in unpaid government contract work. The second, a grocery store,\n\nAlso failed due to hyperinflation and credit extended too easily to needy customers.\n\nThroughout this, you continued earning an exceptionally good salary. But in the mid 1960’s,\n\nNearly all of it went to pay back creditors of the failed grocery store. We had some really hard\n\nTimes. Someday I’ll write about that in some detail. Mom went to work as a maid, including for\n\nWealthy friends, and you left home at 4:00 a.m. to return long after dark to pay the bills.\n\nThe only luxury you and mom retained was my Catholic school tuition. There was no other\n\nExtravagance. Not paying bills was never an option for you or mom. It never entered your\n\nMinds. It was not a matter of law or pride, but a matter of honor. There were at least three very\n\nLean years where you and mom worked hard, earned well but we were truly poor.\n\nYou and mom took great pains to hide this from me—and suffered great privations to insulate\n\nMe as best you could from the fallout of a shattered economy and your refusal to cut your loses\n\nHad done to your life savings and to our once-comfortable middle-class life.\n\nWe came to the U.S. in the late 1960s after waiting for more than three years for visas—to a new land of hope.\n\nYour sister and brother-in-law, Marisa and Manuel, made their own sacrifices to help bring us\n\nHere. You had about $1,000 from the down payment on our tiny down-sized house, And\n\nMom’s pawned jewelry. (Hyperinflation and expenses ate up the remaining mortgage payments\n\nDue). Other prized possessions were left in a trunk until you could reclaim them. You never did.\n\nEven the airline tickets were paid for by Marisa and Manuel. You insisted upon arriving on\n\nWritten terms for repayment including interest. You were hired on the spot on your first\n\nInterview as a mechanic, First Grade, despite not speaking a word of English. Two months later,\n\nThe debt was repaid, mom was working too and we moved into our first apartment.\n\nYou worked long hours, including Saturdays and daily overtime, to remake a nest egg.\n\nDeclining health forced you to retire at 63 and shortly thereafter you and mom moved out of\n\nQueens into Orange County. You bought a townhouse two hours from my permanent residence\n\nUpstate NY and for the next decade were happy, traveling with friends and visiting us often.\n\nThen things started to change. Heart issues (two pacemakers), colon cancer, melanoma,\n\nLiver and kidney disease caused by your many medications, high blood pressure, gout,\n\nGall bladder surgery, diabetes . . . . And still you moved forward, like the Energizer Bunny,\n\nPatched up, battered, scarred, bruised but unstoppable and unflappable.\n\nThen mom started to show signs of memory loss along with her other health issues. She was\n\nGood at hiding her own ailments, and we noticed much later than we should have that there\n\nWas a serious problem. Two years ago, her dementia worsening but still functional, she had\n\nGall bladder surgery with complications that required four separate surgeries in three months.\n\nShe never recovered and had to be placed in a nursing home. Several, in fact, as at first she\n\nRefused food and you and I refused to simply let her waste away, which might have been\n\nKinder, but for the fact that “mientras hay vida, hay esperanza” as Spaniards say.\n\n(While there is Life there is hope.) There is nothing beyond the power of God. Miracles do happen.\n\nFor two years you lived alone, refusing outside help, engendering numerous arguments about\n\nHaving someone go by a few times a week to help clean, cook, do chores. You were nothing if\n\nNot stubborn (yet another shared trait). The last argument on the subject about two weeks ago\n\nEnded in your crying. You’d accept no outside help until mom returned home. Period.\n\nYou were in great pain because of bulging discs in your spine and walked with one of those\n\nRolling seats with handlebars that mom and I picked out for you some years ago. You’d sit\n\nAs needed when the pain was too much, then continue with very little by way of complaints.\n\nTen days ago you finally agreed that you needed to get to the hospital to drain abdominal fluid.\n\nYour failing liver produced it and it swelled your abdomen and lower extremities to the point\n\nWhere putting on shoes or clothing was very difficult, as was breathing. You called me from a\n\nLocal store crying that you could not find pants that would fit you. We talked, long distance,\n\nAnd I calmed you down, as always, not allowing you to wallow in self pity but trying to help.\n\nYou went home and found a new pair of stretch pants Alice and I had bought you and you were\n\nHappy. You had two changes of clothes that still fit to take to the hospital. No sweat, all was\n\nWell. The procedure was not dangerous and you’d undergone it several times in recent years.\n\nIt would require a couple of days at the hospital and I’d see you again on the weekend.\n\nI could not be with you on Monday, February 22 when you had to go to the hospital, as I nearly\n\nAlways had, because of work. You were supposed to be admitted the previous Friday, but\n\nDoctors have days off too, and yours could not see you until Monday when I could not get off\n\nWork. But you were not concerned; this was just routine. You’d be fine. I’d see you in just days.\n\nWe’d go see mom Friday, when you’d be much lighter and feel much better. Perhaps we’d go\n\nShopping for clothes if the procedure still left you too bloated for your usual clothes.\n\nYou drove to your doctor and then transported by ambulette. I was concerned, but not too Worried.\n\nYou called me sometime between five or six p.m. to tell me you were fine, resting.\n\n“Don’t worry. I’m safe here and well cared for.” We talked for a little while about the usual\n\nThings, with my assuring you I’d see you Friday or Saturday. You were tired and wanted to sleep\n\nAnd I told you to call me if you woke up later that night or I’d speak to you the following day.\n\nAround 10:00 p.m. I got a call from your cell and answered in the usual upbeat manner.\n\n“Hey, Papi.” On the other side was a nurse telling me my dad had fallen. I assured her she was\n\nMistaken, as my dad was there for a routine procedure to drain abdominal fluid. “You don’t\n\nUnderstand. He fell from his bed and struck his head on a nightstand or something\n\nAnd his heart has stopped. We’re working on him for 20 minutes and it does not look good.”\n\n“Can you get here?” I could not. I had had two or three glasses of wine shortly before the call\n\nWith dinner. I could not drive the three hours to Middletown. I cried. I prayed.\n\nFifteen minutes Later I got the call that you were gone. Lost in grief, not knowing what to do, I called my wife.\n\nShortly thereafter came a call from the coroner. An autopsy was required. I could not see you.\n\nFour days later your body was finally released to the funeral director I had selected for his\n\nExperience with the process of interment in Spain. I saw you for the last time to identify\n\nYour body. I kissed my fingers and touched your mangled brow. I could not even have the\n\nComfort of an open casket viewing. You wanted cremation. You body awaits it as I write this.\n\nYou were alone, even in death alone. In the hospital as strangers worked on you. In the medical\n\nExaminer’s office as you awaited the autopsy. In the autopsy table as they poked and prodded\n\nAnd further rent your flesh looking for irrelevant clues that would change nothing and benefit\n\nNo one, least of all you. I could not be with you for days, and then only for a painful moment.\n\nWe will have a memorial service next Friday with your ashes and a mass on Saturday. I will\n\nNever again see you in this life. Alice and I will take you home to your home town, to the\n\nCemetery in Oleiros, La Coruña, Spain this summer. There you will await the love of your life.\n\nWho will join you in the fullness of time. She could not understand my tears or your passing.\n\nThere is one blessing to dementia. She asks for her mom, and says she is worried because she\n\nHas not come to visit in some time. She is coming, she assures me whenever I see her.\n\nYou visited her every day except when health absolutely prevented it. You spent this February 10\n\nApart, your 61st wedding anniversary, too sick to visit her. Nor was I there. First time.\n\nI hope you did not realize you were apart on the 10th but doubt it to be the case. I\n\nDid not mention it, hoping you’d forgotten, and neither did you. You were my link to mom.\n\nShe cannot dial or answer a phone, so you would put your cell phone to her ear whenever I\n\nWas not in class or meetings and could speak to her. She always recognized me by phone.\n\nI am three hours from her. I could visit at most once or twice a month. Now even that phone\n\nLifeline is severed. Mom is completely alone, afraid, confused, and I cannot in the short term at\n\nLeast do much about that. You were not supposed to die first. It was my greatest fear, and\n\nYours, but as with so many things that we cannot change I put it in the back of my mind.\n\nIt kept me up many nights, but, like you, I still believed—and believe—in miracles.\n\nI would speak every night with my you, often for an hour, on the way home from work late at\n\nNight during my hour-long commute, or from home on days I worked from home as I cooked\n\nDinner. I mostly let you talk, trying to give you what comfort and social outlet I could.\n\nYou were lonely, sad, stuck in an endless cycle of emotional and physical pain.\n\nLately you were especially reticent to get off the phone. When mom was home and still\n\nRelatively well, I’d call every day too but usually spoke to you only a few minutes and you’d\n\nTransfer the phone to mom, with whom I usually chatted much longer.\n\nFor months, you’d had difficulty hanging up. I knew you did not want to go back to the couch,\n\nTo a meaningless TV program, or to writing more bills. You’d say good-bye, or “enough for\n\nToday” and immediately begin a new thread, then repeat the cycle, sometimes five or six times.\n\nYou even told me, at least once crying recently, “Just hang up on me or I’ll just keep talking.”\n\nI loved you, dad, with all my heart. We argued, and I’d often scream at you in frustration,\n\nKnowing you would never take it to heart and would usually just ignore me and do as\n\nYou pleased. I knew how desperately you needed me, and I tried to be as patient as I could.\n\nBut there were days when I was just too tired, too frustrated, too full of other problems.\n\nThere were days when I got frustrated with you just staying on the phone for an hour when I\n\nNeeded to call Alice, to eat my cold dinner, or even to watch a favorite program. I felt guilty\n\nAnd very seldom cut a conversation short, but I was frustrated nonetheless even knowing\n\nHow much you needed me and also how much I needed you, and how little you asked of me.\n\nHow I would love to hear your voice again, even if you wanted to complain about the same old\n\nThings or tell me in minutest detail some unimportant aspect of your day. I thought I would\n\nHave you at least a little longer. A year? Two? God only knew, and I could hope. There would be\n\nTime. I had so much more to share with you, so much more to learn when life eased up a bit.\n\nYou taught me to fish (it did not take) and to hunt (that took even less) and much of what I\n\nKnow about mechanics, and electronics. We worked on our cars together for years—from brake\n\nJobs, to mufflers, to real tune-ups in the days when points, condensers, and timing lights had Meaning, to rebuilding carburetors and fixing rust and dents, and power windows and more.\n\nWe were friends, good friends, who went on Sunday drives to favorite restaurants or shopping\n\nFor tools when I was single and lived at home. You taught me everything in life that I need to\n\nKnow about all the things that matter. The rest is meaningless paper and window dressing.\n\nI knew all your few faults and your many colossal strengths and knew you to be the better man.\n\nNot even close. I could never do what you did. I could never excel in my fields as you did in\n\nYours. You were the real deal in every way, from every angle, throughout your life. I did not\n\nAlways treat you that way. But I loved you very deeply as anyone who knew us knows.\n\nMore importantly, you knew it. I told you often, unembarrassed in the telling. I love you, Dad.\n\nThe world was enriched by your journey. You do not leave behind wealth, or a body or work to\n\nOutlive you. You never had your fifteen minutes in the sun. But you mattered. God knows your\n\nVirtue, your absolute integrity, and the purity of your heart. I will never know a better man.\n\nI will love you and miss you and carry you in my heart every day of my life. God bless you, dad.\n\nYou can hear all six of my Unsung Heroes poems read by me in my podcasts at https://open.spotify.com/show/1zgnkuAIVJaQ0Gb6pOfQOH.

The sonnets here include traditional sonnets, tetrameter sonnets, hexameter sonnets, curtal sonnets, 15-line sonnets, and some that probably defy categorization, which I call free verse sonnets for want of a better term. Most of these sonnets employ meter, rhyme and form and tend to be Romantic in the spirit of the Romanticism of Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth and Dylan Thomas.\n\nAuschwitz Rose\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere is a Rose at Auschwitz, in the briar,\n\na rose like Sharon's, lovely as her name.\n\nThe world forgot her, and is not the same.\n\nI still love her and enlist this sacred fire\n\nto keep her memory exalted flame\n\nunmolested by the thistles and the nettles.\n\nOn Auschwitz now the reddening sunset settles;\n\nthey sleep alike―diminutive and tall,\n\nthe innocent, the \"surgeons.\" Sleeping, all.\n\nRed oxides of her blood, bright crimson petals,\n\nif accidents of coloration, gall my heart no less.\n\nAmid thick weeds and muck\n\nthere lies a rose man's crackling lightning struck:\n\nthe only Rose I ever longed to pluck.\n\nSoon I'll bed there and bid the world \"Good Luck.\"\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nIn Praise of Meter\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe earth is full of rhythms so precise\n\nthe octave of the crystal can produce\n\na trillion oscillations, yet not lose\n\na second's beat. The ear needs no device\n\nto hear the unsprung rhythms of the couch\n\ndrown out the mouth's; the lips can be debauched\n\nby kisses, should the heart put back its watch\n\nand find the pulse of love, and sing, devout.\n\nIf moons and tides in interlocking dance\n\nobey their numbers, what's been left to chance?\n\nShould poets be more lax―their circumstance\n\nas humble as it is?―or readers wince\n\nto see their ragged numbers thin, to hear\n\nthe moans of drones drown out the Chanticleer?\n\nOriginally published by The Eclectic Muse and in The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nDiscrimination\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe meter I had sought to find, perplexed,\n\nwas ripped from books of \"verse\" that read like prose.\n\nI found it in sheet music, in long rows\n\nof hologramic CDs, in sad wrecks\n\nof long-forgotten volumes undisturbed\n\nhalf-centuries by archivists, unscanned.\n\nI read their fading numbers, frowned, perturbed―\n\nwhy should such tattered artistry be banned?\n\nI heard the sleigh bells’ jingles, vampish ads,\n\nthe supermodels’ babble, Seuss’s books\n\nextolled in major movies, blurbs for abs ...\n\nA few poor thinnish journals crammed in nooks\n\nare all I’ve found this late to sell to those\n\nwho’d classify free verse \"expensive prose.\"\n\nOriginally published by The Chariton Review\n\nThe Forge\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nTo at last be indestructible, a poem\n\nmust first glow, almost flammable, upon\n\na thing inert, as gray, as dull as stone,\n\nthen bend this way and that, and slowly cool\n\nat arms-length, something irreducible\n\ndrawn out with caution, toughened in a pool\n\nof water so contrary just a hiss\n\nescapes it―water instantly a mist.\n\nIt writhes, a thing of senseless shapelessness ...\n\nAnd then the driven hammer falls and falls.\n\nThe horses ***** their ears in nearby stalls.\n\nA soldier on his cot leans back and smiles.\n\nA sound of ancient import, with the ring\n\nof honest labor, sings of fashioning.\n\nOriginally published by The Chariton Review\n\nFor All That I Remembered\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFor all that I remembered, I forgot\n\nher name, her face, the reason that we loved ...\n\nand yet I hold her close within my thought.\n\nI feel the burnished weight of auburn hair\n\nthat fell across her face, the apricot\n\nclean scent of her shampoo, the way she glowed\n\nso palely in the moonlight, angel-wan.\n\nThe memory of her gathers like a flood\n\nand bears me to that night, that only night,\n\nwhen she and I were one, and if I could ...\n\nI'd reach to her this time and, smiling, brush\n\nthe hair out of her eyes, and hold intact\n\neach feature, each impression. Love is such\n\na threadbare sort of magic, it is gone\n\nbefore we recognize it. I would crush\n\nmy lips to hers to hold their memory,\n\nif not more tightly, less elusively.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nLeaf Fall\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhatever winds encountered soon resolved\n\nto swirling fragments, till chaotic heaps\n\nof leaves lay pulsing by the backyard wall.\n\nIn lieu of rakes, our fingers sorted each\n\ndry leaf into its place and built a high,\n\nsoft bastion against earth's gravitron―\n\na patchwork quilt, a trampoline, a bright\n\nimpediment to fling ourselves upon.\n\nAnd nothing in our laughter as we fell\n\ninto those leaves was like the autumn's cry\n\nof also falling. Nothing meant to die\n\ncould be so bright as we, so colorful―\n\nclad in our plaids, oblivious to pain\n\nwe'd feel today, should we leaf-fall again.\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nIsolde's Song\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThrough our long years of dreaming to be one\n\nwe grew toward an enigmatic light\n\nthat gently warmed our tendrils. Was it sun?\n\nWe had no eyes to tell; we loved despite\n\nthe lack of all sensation―all but one:\n\nwe felt the night's deep chill, the air so bright\n\nat dawn we quivered limply, overcome.\n\nTo touch was all we knew, and how to bask.\n\nWe knew to touch; we grew to touch; we felt\n\nspring's urgency, midsummer's heat, fall's lash,\n\nwild winter's ice and thaw and fervent melt.\n\nWe felt returning light and could not ask\n\nits meaning, or if something was withheld\n\nmore glorious. To touch seemed life's great task.\n\nAt last the petal of me learned: unfold.\n\nAnd you were there, surrounding me. We touched.\n\nThe curious golden pollens! Ah, we touched,\n\nand learned to cling and, finally, to hold.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nSee\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSee how her hair has thinned: it doesn't seem\n\nlike hair at all, but like the airy moult\n\nof emus who outraced the wind and left\n\nsoft plumage in their wake. See how her eyes\n\nare gentler now; see how each wrinkle laughs,\n\nand deepens on itself, as though mirth took\n\nsome comfort there and burrowed deeply in,\n\noutlasting winter. See how very thin\n\nher features are―that time has made more spare,\n\nso that each bone shows, elegant and rare.\n\nFor loveliness remains in her grave eyes,\n\nand courage in her still-delighted looks:\n\neach face presented like a picture book's.\n\nBemused, she blows us undismayed goodbyes.\n\nOriginally published by Writer's Digest's: The Year's Best Writing 2003\n\nIn the Whispering Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky,\n\nand the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our bodies to some violent ocean\n\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze:\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the world of resplendence from which we were seized.\n\nPublished in Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly and Poetry Life & Times. This is a sonnet I wrote for my favorite college English teacher, George King, about poetic kinship, brotherhood and romantic flights of fancy.\n\nThe Toast\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nFor longings warmed by tepid suns\n\n(brief lusts that animated clay),\n\nfor passions wilted at the bud\n\nand skies grown desolate and gray,\n\nfor stars that fell from tinseled heights\n\nand mountains bleak and scarred and lone,\n\nfor seas reflecting distant suns\n\nand weeds that thrive where seeds were sown,\n\nfor waltzes ending in a hush,\n\nfor rhymes that fade as pages close,\n\nfor flames' exhausted, drifting ash,\n\nand petals falling from the rose, ...\n\nI raise my cup before I drink,\n\nsaluting ghosts of loves long dead,\n\nand silently propose a toast―\n\nto joys set free, and those I fled.\n\nSecond Sight (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n(Newborns see best at a distance of 8 to 14 inches.)\n\nWiser than we know, the newborn screams,\n\nred-faced from breath, and wonders what life means\n\nthis close to death, amid the arctic glare\n\nof warmthless lights above.\n\nBeware! Beware!―\n\nencrypted signals, codes? Or ciphers, noughts?\n\nInterpretless, almost, as his own thoughts―\n\nthe brilliant lights, the brilliant lights exist.\n\nIntruding faces ogle, gape, insist―\n\nthis madness, this soft-hissing breath, makes sense.\n\nWhy can he not float on, in dark suspense,\n\nand dream of life? Why did they rip him out?\n\nHe frowns at them―small gnomish frowns, all doubt―\n\nand with an ancient mien, O sorrowful!,\n\nre-closes eyes that saw in darkness null\n\necstatic sights, exceeding beautiful.\n\nArchaischer Torso Apollos (“Archaic Torso of Apollo”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe cannot know the beheaded god\n\nnor his eyes' forfeited visions. But still\n\nthe figure's trunk glows with the strange vitality\n\nof a lamp lit from within, while his composed will\n\nemanates dynamism. Otherwise\n\nthe firmly muscled abdomen could not beguile us,\n\nnor the centering ***** make us smile\n\nat the thought of their generative animus.\n\nOtherwise the stone might seem deficient,\n\nunworthy of the broad shoulders, of the groin\n\nprojecting procreation's triangular spearhead upwards,\n\nunworthy of the living impulse blazing wildly within\n\nlike an inchoate star―demanding our belief.\n\nYou must change your life.\n\nTRANSLATOR'S NOTE: This is a Rilke sonnet about a major resolution: changing the very nature of one's life. While it is only my personal interpretation of the poem above, I believe Rilke was saying to himself: \"I must change my life.\" Why? Perhaps because he wanted to be a real artist, and when confronted with real, dynamic, living and breathing art of Rodin, he realized that he had to inject similar vitality, energy and muscularity into his poetry. Michelangelo said that he saw the angel in a block of marble, then freed it. Perhaps Rilke had to find the dynamic image of Apollo, the God of Poetry, in his materials, which were paper, ink and his imagination.―Michael R. Burch\n\nKomm, Du (“Come, You”)\n\nby Ranier Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThis was Rilke’s last poem, written ten days before his death. He died open-eyed in the arms of his doctor on December 29, 1926, in the Valmont Sanatorium, of leukemia and its complications. I had a friend who died of leukemia and he was burning up with fever in the end. I believe that is what Rilke was describing here: he was literally burning alive.\n\nCome, you―the last one I acknowledge; return―\n\nincurable pain searing this physical mesh.\n\nAs I burned in the spirit once, so now I burn\n\nwith you; meanwhile, you consume my flesh.\n\nThis wood that long resisted your embrace\n\nnow nourishes you; I surrender to your fury\n\nas my gentleness mutates to hellish rage―\n\nuncaged, wild, primal, mindless, outré.\n\nCompletely free, no longer future’s pawn,\n\nI clambered up this crazy pyre of pain,\n\ncertain I’d never return―my heart’s reserves gone―\n\nto become death’s nameless victim, purged by flame.\n\nNow all I ever was must be denied.\n\nI left my memories of my past elsewhere.\n\nThat life―my former life―remains outside.\n\nInside, I’m lost. Nobody knows me here.\n\nDer Panther (\"The Panther\")\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHis weary vision's so overwhelmed by iron bars,\n\nhis exhausted eyes see only blank Oblivion.\n\nHis world is not our world. It has no stars.\n\nNo light. Ten thousand bars. Nothing beyond.\n\nLithe, swinging with a rhythmic easy stride,\n\nhe circles, his small orbit tightening,\n\nan electron losing power. Paralyzed,\n\nsoon regal Will stands stunned, an abject thing.\n\nOnly at times the pupils' curtains rise\n\nsilently, and then an image enters,\n\ndescends through arrested shoulders, plunges, centers\n\nsomewhere within his empty heart, and dies.\n\nLiebes-Lied (“Love Song”)\n\nby Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nHow can I withhold my soul so that it doesn’t touch yours?\n\nHow can I lift mine gently to higher things, alone?\n\nOh, I would gladly find something lost in the dark\n\nin that inert space that fails to resonate until you vibrate.\n\nThere everything that moves us, draws us together like a bow\n\nenticing two taut strings to sing together with a simultaneous voice.\n\nWhose instrument are we becoming together?\n\nWhose, the hands that excite us?\n\nAh, sweet song!\n\nSweet Rose of Virtue\n\nby William Dunbar [1460-1525]\n\nloose translation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,\n\ndelightful lily of youthful wantonness,\n\nrichest in bounty and in beauty clear\n\nand in every virtue that is held most dear―\n\nexcept only that you are merciless.\n\nInto your garden, today, I followed you;\n\nthere I saw flowers of freshest hue,\n\nboth white and red, delightful to see,\n\nand wholesome herbs, waving resplendently―\n\nyet everywhere, no odor but bitter rue.\n\nI fear that March with his last arctic blast\n\nhas slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,\n\nwhose piteous death does my heart such pain\n\nthat, if I could, I would compose her roots again―\n\nso comforting her bowering leaves have been.\n\nEbb Tide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMassive, gray, these leaden waves\n\nbear their unchanging burden―\n\nthe sameness of each day to day\n\nwhile the wind seems to struggle to say\n\nsomething half-submerged planks at the mouth of the bay\n\nmight nuzzle limp seaweed to understand.\n\nNow collapsing dull waves drain away\n\nfrom the unenticing land;\n\nshrieking gulls shadow fish through salt spray―\n\nwhitish streaks on a fogged silver mirror.\n\nSizzling lightning impresses its brand.\n\nUnseen fingers scribble something in the wet sand.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Southwest Review.\n\nWater and Gold\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nYou came to me as rain breaks on the desert\n\nwhen every flower springs to life at once,\n\nbut joy's a wan illusion to the expert:\n\nthe Bedouin has learned how not to want.\n\nYou came to me as riches to a miser\n\nwhen all is gold, or so his heart believes,\n\nuntil he dies much thinner and much wiser,\n\nhis gleaming bones hauled off by chortling thieves.\n\nYou gave your heart too soon, too dear, too vastly;\n\nI could not take it in; it was too much.\n\nI pledged to meet your price, but promised rashly.\n\nI died of thirst, of your bright Midas touch.\n\nI dreamed you gave me water of your lips,\n\nthen sealed my tomb with golden hieroglyphs.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe City Is a Garment\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nA rhinestone skein, a jeweled brocade of light,―\n\nthe city is a garment stretched so thin\n\nher festive colors bleed into the night,\n\nand everywhere bright seams, unraveling,\n\ncascade their brilliant contents out like coins\n\non motorways and esplanades; bead cars\n\ncome tumbling down long highways; at her groin\n\na railtrack like a zipper flashes sparks;\n\nher hills are haired with brush like cashmere wool\n\nand from their cleavage winking lights enlarge\n\nand travel, slender fingers ... softly pull\n\nthemselves into the semblance of a barge.\n\nWhen night becomes too chill, she softly dons\n\ngreat overcoats of warmest-colored dawn.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nThe Folly of Wisdom\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nShe is wise in the way that children are wise,\n\nlooking at me with such knowing, grave eyes\n\nI must bend down to her to understand.\n\nBut she only smiles, and takes my hand.\n\nWe are walking somewhere that her feet know to go,\n\nso I smile, and I follow ...\n\nAnd the years are dark creatures concealed in bright leaves\n\nthat flutter above us, and what she believes―\n\nI can almost remember―goes something like this:\n\nthe prince is a horned toad, awaiting her kiss.\n\nShe wiggles and giggles, and all will be well\n\nif only we find him! The woodpecker’s knell\n\nas he hammers the coffin of some dying tree\n\nthat once was a fortress to someone like me\n\nrings wildly above us. Some things that we know\n\nwe are meant to forget. Life is a bloodletting, maple-syrup-slow.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Romantics Quarterly.\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant . . .\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n―feverish, wet―\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union . . .\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nThis is one of my early free verse sonnets but I can’t remember exactly when I wrote it. Due to the romantic style, I believe it was probably written during my first two years in college, making me 18 or 19 at the time.\n\nAbide\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Philip Larkin's \"Aubade\"\n\nIt is hard to understand or accept mortality―\n\nsuch an alien concept: not to be.\n\nPerhaps unsettling enough to spawn religion,\n\nor to scare mutant fish out of a primordial sea\n\nboiling like goopy green tea in a kettle.\n\nPerhaps a man should exhibit more mettle\n\nthan to admit such fear, denying Nirvana exists\n\nsimply because we are stuck here in such a fine fettle.\n\nAnd so we abide . . .\n\neven in life, staring out across that dark brink.\n\nAnd if the thought of death makes your questioning heart sink,\n\nit is best not to drink\n\n(or, drinking, certainly not to think).\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by Light Quarterly.\n\nFree Fall\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese cloudless nights, the sky becomes a wheel\n\nwhere suns revolve around an axle star ...\n\nLook there, and choose. Decide which moon is yours.\n\nSink Lethe-ward, held only by a heel.\n\nAdvantage. Disadvantage. Who can tell?\n\nTo see is not to know, but you can feel\n\nthe tug sometimes―the gravity, the shell\n\nas lustrous as damp pearl. You sink, you reel\n\ntoward some draining revelation. Air―\n\ntoo thin to grasp, to breath. Such pressure. Gasp.\n\nThe stars invert, electric, everywhere.\n\nAnd so we fall, down-tumbling through night’s fissure ...\n\ntwo beings pale, intent to fall forever\n\naround each other―fumbling at love’s tether ...\n\nnow separate, now distant, now together.\n\nThis is a 15-line free verse sonnet originally published by Sonnet Scroll.\n\nOnce\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nOnce when her kisses were fire incarnate\n\nand left in their imprint bright lipstick, and flame,\n\nwhen her breath rose and fell over smoldering dunes,\n\nleaving me listlessly sighing her name . . .\n\nOnce when her ******* were as pale, as beguiling,\n\nas wan rivers of sand shedding heat like a mist,\n\nwhen her words would at times softly, mildly rebuke me\n\nall the while as her lips did more wildly insist . . .\n\nOnce when the thought of her echoed and whispered\n\nthrough vast wastelands of need like a Bedouin chant,\n\nI ached for the touch of her lips with such longing\n\nthat I vowed all my former vows to recant . . .\n\nOnce, only once, something bloomed, of a desiccate seed―\n\nthis implausible blossom her wild rains of kisses decreed.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nAt Once\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nThough she was fair,\n\nthough she sent me the epistle of her love at once\n\nand inscribed therein love’s antique prayer,\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nThough she would dare\n\npain’s pale, clinging shadows, to approach me at once,\n\nthe dark, haggard keeper of the lair,\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nThough she would share\n\nthe all of her being, to heal me at once,\n\nyet more than her touch I was unable bear.\n\nI did not love her at once.\n\nAnd yet she would care,\n\nand pour out her essence ...\n\nand yet―there was more!\n\nI awoke from long darkness,\n\nand yet―she was there.\n\nI loved her the longer;\n\nI loved her the more\n\nbecause I did not love her at once.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nTwice\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow twice she has left me\n\nand twice I have listened\n\nand taken her back, remembering days\n\nwhen love lay upon us\n\nand sparkled and glistened\n\nwith the brightness of dew through a gathering haze.\n\nBut twice she has left me\n\nto start my life over,\n\nand twice I have gathered up embers, to learn:\n\nrekindle a fire\n\nfrom ash, soot and cinder\n\nand softly it sputters, refusing to burn.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nMoments\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere were moments full of promise,\n\nlike the petal-scented rainfall of early spring,\n\nwhen to hold you in my arms and to kiss your willing lips\n\nseemed everything.\n\nThere are moments strangely empty\n\nfull of pale unearthly twilight―how the cold stars stare!―\n\nwhen to be without you is a dark enchantment\n\nthe night and I share.\n\nThe Harvest of Roses\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI have not come for the harvest of roses―\n\nthe poets' mad visions,\n\ntheir railing at rhyme ...\n\nfor I have discerned what their writing discloses:\n\nweak words wanting meaning,\n\nbeat torsioning time.\n\nNor have I come for the reaping of gossamer―\n\nimages weak,\n\ntoo forced not to fail;\n\ngathered by poets who worship their luster,\n\nthey shimmer, impendent,\n\nresplendently pale.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review\n\nDistances\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMoonbeams on water―\n\nthe reflected light\n\nof a halcyon star\n\nnow drowning in night ...\n\nSo your memories are.\n\nFootprints on beaches\n\nnow flooding with water;\n\nthe small, broken ribcage\n\nof some primitive slaughter ...\n\nSo near, yet so far.\n\nNOTE: In the first stanza the \"halcyon star\" is the sun, which has dropped below the horizon and is thus \"drowning in night.\" But its light strikes the moon, creating moonbeams which are reflected by the water. Sometimes memories seem that distant, that faint, that elusive. Footprints are being washed away, a heart is missing from its ribcage, and even things close at hand can seem infinitely beyond our reach.\n\nA Surfeit of Light\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was always a surfeit of light in your presence.\n\nYou stood distinctly apart, not of the humdrum world―\n\na chariot of gold in a procession of plywood.\n\nWe were all pioneers of the modern expedient race,\n\nraising the ante: Home Depot to Lowe’s.\n\nYours was an antique grace―Thrace’s or Mesopotamia’s.\n\nWe were never quite sure of your silver allure,\n\nof your trillium-and-platinum diadem,\n\nof your utter lack of flatware-like utility.\n\nYou told us that night―your wound would not scar.\n\nThe black moment passed, then you were no more.\n\nThe darker the sky, how much brighter the Star!\n\nThe day of your funeral, I ripped out the crown mold.\n\nYou were this fool’s gold.\n\nSongstress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Nadia Anjuman\n\nWithin its starkwhite ribcage, how the heart\n\nmust flutter wildly, O, and always sing\n\nagainst the pressing darkness: all it knows\n\nuntil at last it feels the numbing sting\n\nof death. Then life's brief vision swiftly passes,\n\nimposing night on one who clearly saw.\n\nDeath held your bright heart tightly, till its maw―\n\nenvenomed, fanged―could swallow, whole, your Awe.\n\nAnd yet it was not death so much as you\n\nwho sealed your doom; you could not help but sing\n\nand not be silenced. Here, behold your tomb's\n\nwhite alabaster cage: pale, wretched thing!\n\nBut you'll not be imprisoned here, wise wren!\n\nYour words soar free; rise, sing, fly, live again.\n\nA poet like Nadia Anjuman can be likened to a caged bird, deprived of flight, who somehow finds it within herself to sing of love and beauty. But when the world finally robs her of both flight and song, what is left for her but to leave the world, thus bereaving the world of herself and her song?\n\nCome Down\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Harold Bloom\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom your high mountain tower.\n\nHow coldly the wind blows,\n\nhow late this chill hour ...\n\nand I cannot wait\n\nfor a meteor shower\n\nto show you the time\n\nmust be now, or not ever.\n\nCome down, O, come down\n\nfrom the high mountain heather\n\nnow brittle and brown\n\nas fierce northern gales sever.\n\nCome down, or your heart\n\nwill grow cold as the weather\n\nwhen winter devours\n\nand spring returns never.\n\nNOTE: I dedicated this poem to Harold Bloom after reading his introduction to the Best American Poetry anthology he edited. Bloom seemed intent on claiming poetry as the province of the uber-reader (i.e., himself), but I remember reading poems by Blake, Burns, cummings, Dickinson, Frost, Housman, Eliot, Pound, Shakespeare, Whitman, Yeats, et al, and grokking them as a boy, without any “advanced” instruction from anyone.\n\nSuch Tenderness\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers of Gaza and loving, compassionate mothers everywhere\n\nThere was, in your touch, such tenderness―as\n\nonly the dove on her mildest day has,\n\nwhen she shelters downed fledglings beneath a warm wing\n\nand coos to them softly, unable to sing.\n\nWhat songs long forgotten occur to you now―\n\na babe at each breast? What terrible vow\n\nripped from your throat like the thunder that day\n\ncan never hold severing lightnings at bay?\n\nTime taught you tenderness―time, oh, and love.\n\nBut love in the end is seldom enough ...\n\nand time?―insufficient to life’s brief task.\n\nI can only admire, unable to ask―\n\nwhat is the source, whence comes the desire\n\nof a woman to love as no God may require?\n\nIn this Ordinary Swoon\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIn this ordinary swoon\n\nas I pass from life to death,\n\nI feel no heat from the cold, pale moon;\n\nI feel no sympathy for breath.\n\nWho I am and why I came,\n\nI do not know; nor does it matter.\n\nThe end of every man’s the same\n\nand every god’s as mad as a hatter.\n\nI do not fear the letting go;\n\nI only fear the clinging on\n\nto hope when there’s no hope, although\n\nI lift my face to the blazing sun\n\nand feel the greater intensity\n\nof the wilder inferno within me.\n\nThis is a mostly tetrameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMare Clausum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese are the narrows of my soul―\n\ndark waters pierced by eerie, haunting screams.\n\nAnd these uncharted islands bleakly home\n\nwild nightmares and deep, strange, forbidding dreams.\n\nPlease don’t think to find pearls’ pale, unearthly glow\n\nwithin its shoals, nor corals in its reefs.\n\nFor, though you seek to salvage Love, I know\n\nthat vessel lists, and night brings no relief.\n\nPause here, and look, and know that all is lost;\n\nthen turn, and go; let salt consume, and rust.\n\nThis sea is not for sailors, but the ******\n\nwho lingered long past morning, till they learned\n\nwhy it is named:\n\nMare Clausum.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet with shorter and longer lines, originally published by Penny Dreadful. Mare Clausum is Latin for \"Closed Sea.\" I wrote the first version of this poem as a teenager.\n\nRedolence\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow darkness ponds upon the violet hills;\n\ncicadas sing; the tall elms gently sway;\n\nand night bends near, a deepening shade of gray;\n\nthe bass concerto of a bullfrog fills\n\nwhat silence there once was; globed searchlights play.\n\nGreen hanging ferns adorn dark window sills,\n\nall drooping fronds, awaiting morning’s flares;\n\nmosquitoes whine; the lissome moth again\n\nflits like a veiled oud-dancer, and endures\n\nthe fumblings of night’s enervate gray rain.\n\nAnd now the pact of night is made complete;\n\nthe air is fresh and cool, washed of the grime\n\nof the city’s ashen breath; and, for a time,\n\nthe fragrance of her clings, obscure and sweet.\n\nPublished by The Eclectic Muse and The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nFountainhead\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI did not delight in love so much\n\nas in a kiss like linnets' wings,\n\nthe flutterings of a pulse so soft\n\nthe heart remembers, as it sings:\n\nto bathe there was its transport, brushed\n\nby marble lips, or porcelain,―\n\none liquid kiss, one cool outburst\n\nfrom pale rosettes. What did it mean ...\n\nto float awhirl on minute tides\n\nwithin the compass of your eyes,\n\nto feel your alabaster bust\n\ngrow cold within? Ecstatic sighs\n\nseem hisses now; your eyes, serene,\n\nreflect the sun's pale tourmaline.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\n\nPan\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n... Among the shadows of the groaning elms,\n\namid the darkening oaks, we fled ourselves ...\n\n... Once there were paths that led to coracles\n\nthat clung to piers like loosening barnacles ...\n\n... where we cannot return, because we lost\n\nthe pebbles and the playthings, and the moss ...\n\n... hangs weeping gently downward, maidens’ hair\n\nwho never were enchanted, and the stairs ...\n\n... that led up to the Fortress in the trees\n\nwill not support our weight, but on our knees ...\n\n... we still might fit inside those splendid hours\n\nof damsels in distress, of rustic towers ...\n\n... of voices of the wolves’ tormented howls\n\nthat died, and live in dreams’ soft, windy vowels ...\n\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\n\nThe Endeavors of Lips\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHow sweet the endeavors of lips: to speak\n\nof the heights of those pleasures which left us weak\n\nin love’s strangely lit beds, where the cold springs creak:\n\nfor there is no illusion like love ...\n\nGrown childlike, we wish for those storied days,\n\nfor those bright sprays of flowers, those primrosed ways\n\nthat curled to the towers of Yesterdays\n\nwhere She braided illusions of love ...\n\n\"O, let down your hair!\"―we might call and call,\n\nto the dark-slatted window, the moonlit wall ...\n\nbut our love is a shadow; we watch it crawl\n\nlike a spidery illusion. For love ...\n\nwas never as real as that first kiss seemed\n\nwhen we read by the flashlight and dreamed.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly (USA) and The Eclectic Muse (Canada)\n\nLoose Knit\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nIf you come to San Miguel\n\nbefore the orchids fall,\n\nwe might stroll through lengthening shadows\n\nthose deserted streets\n\nwhere love first bloomed ...\n\nYou might buy the same cheap musk\n\nfrom that mud-spattered stall\n\nwhere with furtive eyes the vendor\n\nwatched his fragrant wares\n\nperfume your ******* ...\n\nWhere lean men mend tattered nets,\n\ndisgruntled sea gulls chide;\n\nwe might find that cafetucho\n\nwhere through grimy panes\n\nsunset implodes ...\n\nWhere tall cranes spin canvassed loads,\n\nthe strange anhingas glide.\n\nGreen brine laps splintered moorings,\n\nrusted iron chains grind,\n\nweighed and anchored in the past,\n\nheld fast by luminescent tides ...\n\nShould you come to San Miguel?\n\nLet love decide.\n\nA Vain Word\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nOleanders at dawn preen extravagant whorls\n\nas I read in leaves’ Sanskrit brief moments remaining\n\ntill sunset implodes, till the moon strands grey pearls\n\nunder moss-stubbled oaks, full of whispers, complaining\n\nto the minions of autumn, how swiftly life goes\n\nas I fled before love ... Now, through leaves trodden black,\n\nshivering, I wander as winter’s first throes\n\nof cool listless snow drench my cheeks, back and neck.\n\nI discerned in one season all eternities of grief,\n\nthe specter of death sprawled out under the rose,\n\nthe last consequence of faith in the flight of one leaf,\n\nthe incontinence of age, as life’s bright torrent slows.\n\nO, where are you now?―I was timid, absurd.\n\nI would find comfort again in a vain word.\n\nPublished by Chrysanthemum and Tucumcari Literary Review\n\nChloe\n\nby Michael R.

And so the world renews\n\nold vows it seemed to make: false promises\n\nspring whispers, as if nothing perishes\n\nthat does not resurrect to wilder hues\n\nlike rainbows’ eerie pacts we apprehend\n\nbut cannot fail to keep. Now in your eyes\n\nI see the end of life that only dies\n\nand does not care for bright, translucent lies.\n\nAre tears so precious? These few, let us spend\n\ntogether, as before, then lay to rest\n\nthese sparrows’ hearts aflutter at each breast.\n\nThis is a poem about a couple committing suicide together. The “eerie pact” refers to a Bible verse about the rainbow being a “covenant,” when the only covenant human beings can depend on is the original one that condemned us to suffer and die. That covenant is always kept perfectly.\n\nTo Flower\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen Pentheus [\"grief'] went into the mountains in the garb of the baccae, his mother [Agave] and the other maenads, possessed by Dionysus, tore him apart (Euripides, Bacchae; Apollodorus 3.5.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.511-733; Hyginus, Fabulae 184). The agave dies as soon as it blooms; the moonflower, or night-blooming cereus, is a desert plant of similar fate.\n\nWe are not long for this earth, I know―\n\nyou and I, all our petals incurled,\n\ntill a night of pale brilliance, moonflower aglow.\n\nIs there love anywhere in this strange world?\n\nThe Agave knows best when it's time to die\n\nand rages to life with such rapturous leaves\n\nher name means Illustrious. Each hour more high,\n\nshe claws toward heaven, for, if she believes\n\nin love at all, she has left it behind\n\nto flower, to flower. When darkness falls\n\nshe wilts down to meet it, where something crawls:\n\nbeheaded, bewildered. And since love is blind,\n\nshe never adored it, nor watches it go.\n\nCan we be as she is, moonflower aglow?\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea\n\nFlight 93\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI held the switch in trembling fingers, asked\n\nwhy existence felt so small, so purposeless,\n\nlike a minnow wriggling feebly in my grasp ...\n\nvibrations of huge engines thrummed my arms\n\nas, glistening with sweat, I nudged the switch\n\nto OFF ... I heard the klaxon-shrill alarms\n\nlike vultures’ shriekings ... earthward, in a stall ...\n\nwe floated ... earthward ... wings outstretched, aghast\n\nlike Icarus ... as through the void we fell ...\n\ntill nothing was so beautiful, so blue ...\n\nso vivid as that moment ... and I held\n\nan image of your face, and dreamed I flew\n\ninto your arms. The earth rushed up. I knew\n\nsuch comfort, in that moment, loving you.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The Lyric.\n\nOasis\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI want tears to form again\n\nin the shriveled glands of these eyes\n\ndried all these long years\n\nby too much heated knowing.\n\nI want tears to course down\n\nthese parched cheeks,\n\nto star these cracked lips\n\nlike an improbable dew\n\nin the heart of a desert.\n\nI want words to burble up\n\nlike happiness, like the thought of love,\n\nlike the overwhelming, shimmering thought of you\n\nto a nomad who\n\nhas only known drought.\n\nThis is a mostly hexameter sonnet with shorter and longer lines.\n\nMelting\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nEntirely, as spring consumes the snow,\n\nthe thought of you consumes me: I am found\n\nin rivulets, dissolved to what I know\n\nof former winters’ passions. Underground,\n\nperhaps one slender icicle remains\n\nof what I was before, in some dark cave―\n\na stalactite, long calcified, now drains\n\nto sodden pools, whose milky liquid laves\n\nthe colder rock, thus washing something clean\n\nthat never saw the light, that never knew\n\nthe crust could break above, that light could stream:\n\nso luminous, so bright, so beautiful ...\n\nI lie revealed, and so I stand transformed,\n\nand all because you smiled on me, and warmed.\n\nAfterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe night is full of stars. Which still exist?\n\nBefore time ends, perhaps one day we’ll know.\n\nFor now I hold your fingers to my lips\n\nand feel their pulse ... warm, palpable and slow ...\n\nonce slow to match this reckless spark in me,\n\nthis moon in ceaseless orbit I became,\n\ncompelled by wilder gravity to flee\n\nnight’s universe of suns, for one pale flame ...\n\nfor one pale flame that seemed to signify\n\nthe Zodiac of all, the meaning of\n\nlove’s wandering flight past Neptune. Now to lie\n\nin dawning recognition is enough ...\n\nenough each night to bask in you, to know\n\nthe face of love ... eyes closed ... its afterglow.\n\nAll Afterglow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nSomething remarkable, perhaps ...\n\nthe color of her eyes ... though I forget\n\nthe color of her eyes ... perhaps her hair\n\nthe way it blew about ... I do not know\n\njust what it was about her that has kept\n\nher thought lodged deep in mine ... unmelted snow\n\nthat lasted till July would be less rare,\n\nclasped in some frozen cavern where the wind\n\nsculpts bright grotesqueries, ignoring springs’\n\nand summers’ higher laws ... there thawing slow\n\nand strange by strange degrees, one tick beyond\n\nthe freezing point which keeps all things the same\n\n... till what remains is fragile and unlike\n\nthe world above, where melted snows and rains\n\nform rivulets that, inundate with sun,\n\nevaporate, and in life’s cyclic stream\n\nremake the world again ... I do not know\n\nthat we can be remade―all afterglow.\n\nThese Hallowed Halls\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\na young Romantic Poet mourns the passing of an age . . .\n\nA final stereo fades into silence\n\nand now there is seldom a murmur\n\nto trouble the slumber of these ancient halls.\n\nI stand by a window where others have watched\n\nthe passage of time alone, not untouched,\n\nand I am as they were―unsure, for the days\n\nstretch out ahead, a bewildering maze.\n\nAh, faithless lover―that I had never touched your breast,\n\nnor felt the stirrings of my heart,\n\nwhich until that moment had peacefully slept.\n\nFor now I have known the exhilaration\n\nof a heart that has leapt every pinnacle of Love,\n\nand the result of all such infatuations―\n\nthe long freefall to earth, as the moon glides above.\n\nCome!\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWill you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder,\n\nwhen I have lain so long in the indifferent earth\n\nthat I have no girth?\n\nWhen my womb has conformed to the chastity\n\nyour anemic Messiah envisioned for me,\n\nwill you finally be pleased that my *** was thus rendered\n\nunpalatable, disengendered?\n\nAnd when those strange loathsome organs that troubled you so\n\nhave been eaten by worms, will the heavens still glow\n\nwith the approval of God that I ended a maid―\n\nthanks to a *****?\n\nAnd will you come to visit my grave, I wonder,\n\nin the season of lightning, the season of thunder?\n\nErin\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is her hair―\n\nbright carrot―and her milkmaid-pallid skin,\n\nher brilliant air of cavalier despair,\n\nher train of children―some conceived in sin,\n\nthe others to avoid it. For nowhere\n\nis evidence of thought. Devout, pale, thin,\n\ngay, nonchalant, all radiance. So fair!\n\nHow can men look upon her and not spin\n\nlike wobbly buoys churned by her skirt’s brisk air?\n\nThey buy. They ***** to pat her nyloned shin,\n\nto share her elevated, pale Despair ...\n\nto find at last two spirits ease no one’s.\n\nAll that’s left of Ireland is the Care,\n\nher impish grin, green eyes like leprechauns’.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“I made it out of a mouthful of air.”―W. B. Yeats\n\nWe breathe and so we write; the night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn; the page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean we write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight, each plosive’s shape―\n\ncurved like the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass beneath bright glass\n\nlike singing voles curled in a maze\n\nof blank white space. We touch a face―\n\nlong-frozen words trapped in a glaze\n\nthat insulates our hearts. Nowhere\n\ncan love be found. Just shrieking air.\n\nThe Composition of Shadows (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWe breathe and so we write;\n\nthe night\n\nhums softly its accompaniment.\n\nPale phosphors burn;\n\nthe page we turn\n\nleads onward, and we smile, content.\n\nAnd what we mean\n\nwe write to learn:\n\nthe vowels of love, the consonants’\n\nstrange golden weight,\n\nthe blood’s debate\n\nwithin the heart. Here, resonant,\n\nsounds’ shadows mass\n\nagainst bright glass,\n\nwithin the white Labyrinthian maze.\n\nThrough simple grace,\n\nI touch your face,\n\nah words! And I would gaze\n\nthe night’s dark length\n\nin waning strength\n\nto find the words to feel\n\nsuch light again.\n\nO, for a pen\n\nto spell love so ethereal.\n\nTo Please The Poet\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nTo please the poet, words must dance―\n\nstaccato, brisk, a two-step:\n\nso!\n\nOr waltz in elegance to time\n\nof music mild,\n\nadagio.\n\nTo please the poet, words must chance\n\nemotion in catharsis―\n\nflame.\n\nOr splash into salt seas, descend\n\nin sheets of silver-shining\n\nrain.\n\nTo please the poet, words must prance\n\nand gallop, gambol, revel,\n\nrail.\n\nOr muse upon a moment, mute,\n\nobscure, unsure, imperfect,\n\npale.\n\nTo please the poet, words must sing,\n\nor croak, wart-tongued, imagining.\n\nThe First Christmas\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n’Twas in a land so long ago . . .\n\nthe lambs lay blanketed in snow\n\nand little children everywhere\n\nsat and watched warm embers glow\n\nand dreamed (of what, we do not know).\n\nAnd THEN―a star appeared on high,\n\nThe brightest man had ever seen!\n\nIt made the children whisper low\n\nin puzzled awe (what did it mean?).\n\nIt made the wooly lambkins cry.\n\nFor far away a new-born lay,\n\nwarm-blanketed in straw and hay,\n\na lowly manger for his crib.\n\nThe cattle mooed, distraught and low,\n\nto see the child. They did not know\n\nit now was Christmas day!\n\nThis is a poem in which I tried to capture the mystery and magic of the first Christmas day. If you like my poem, you are welcome to share it, but please cite me as the author, which you can do by including the title and subheading.\n\nThe Lingering and the Unconsoled Heart\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere is a silence―\n\nthe last unspoken moment\n\nbefore death,\n\nwhen the moon,\n\ncratered and broken,\n\nis all madness and light,\n\nwhen the breath comes low and complaining,\n\nand the heart is a ruin\n\nof emptiness and night.\n\nThere is a grief―\n\nthe grief of a lover's embrace\n\nwhile faith still shimmers in a mother’s tears ...\n\nThere is no emptier time, nor place,\n\nwhile the faint glimmer of life is ours\n\nthat the lingering and the unconsoled heart fears\n\nbeyond this: seeing its own stricken face\n\nin eyes that drift toward some incomprehensible place.\n\nLozenge\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen I was closest to love, it did not seem\n\nreal at all, but a thing of such tenuous sweetness\n\nit might dissolve in my mouth\n\nlike a lozenge of sugar.\n\nWhen I held you in my arms, I did not feel\n\nour lack of completeness,\n\nknowing how easy it was\n\nfor us to cling to each other.\n\nAnd there were nights when the clouds\n\nsped across the moon’s face,\n\nexposing such rarified brightness\n\nwe did not witness\n\nso much as embrace\n\nlove’s human appearance.\n\nThis is a free verse sonnet originally published by The HyperTexts.\n\nThe Princess and the Pauper\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Norman Kraeft in memory of his beloved wife June Kysilko Kraeft\n\nHere was a woman bright, intent on life,\n\nwho did not flinch from Death, but caught his eye\n\nand drew him, powerless, into her spell\n\nof wanting her himself, so much the lie\n\nthat she was meant for him―obscene illusion!―\n\nmade him seem a monarch throned like God on high,\n\nwhen he was less than nothing; when to die\n\nmeant many stultifying, pained embraces.\n\nShe shed her gown, undid the tangled laces\n\nthat tied her to the earth: then she was his.\n\nNow all her erstwhile beauty he defaces\n\nand yet she grows in hallowed loveliness―\n\nher ghost beyond perfection―for to die\n\nwas to ascend. Now he begs, penniless.\n\nAlbum\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI caress them―trapped in brittle cellophane―\n\nand I see how young they were, and how unwise;\n\nand I remember their first flight―an old prop plane,\n\ntheir blissful arc through alien blue skies ...\n\nAnd I touch them here through leaves which―tattered, frayed―\n\nare also wings, but wings that never flew:\n\nlike insects’ wings―pinned, held. Here, time delayed,\n\ntheir features never changed, remaining two ...\n\nAnd Grief, which lurked unseen beyond the lens\n\nor in shadows where It crept on feral claws\n\nas It scratched Its way into their hearts, depends\n\non sorrows such as theirs, and works Its jaws ...\n\nand slavers for Its meat―those young, unwise,\n\nwho naively dare to dream, yet fail to see\n\nhow, lumbering sunward, Hope, ungainly, flies,\n\nclutching to Her ruffled breast what must not be.\n\nBecause You Came to Me\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBecause you came to me with sweet compassion\n\nand kissed my furrowed brow and smoothed my hair,\n\nI do not love you after any fashion,\n\nbut wildly, in despair.\n\nBecause you came to me in my black torment\n\nand kissed me fiercely, blazing like the sun\n\nupon parched desert dunes, till in dawn’s foment\n\nthey melt, I am undone.\n\nBecause I am undone, you have remade me\n\nas suns bring life, as brilliant rains endow\n\nthe earth below with leaves, where you now shade me\n\nand bower me, somehow.\n\nBreak Time\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor those who lost loved ones on 9-11\n\nIntrude upon my grief; sit; take a spot\n\nof milk to cloud the blackness that you feel;\n\nadd artificial sweeteners to conceal\n\nthe bitter aftertaste of loss. You’ll heal\n\nif I do not. The coffee’s hot. You speak:\n\nof bundt cakes, polls, the price of eggs. You glance\n\ntwice at your watch, cough, look at me askance.\n\nThe TV drones oeuvres of high romance\n\nin syncopated lip-synch. Should I feel\n\nthe underbelly of Love’s warm Ideal,\n\nits fuzzy-wuzzy tummy, and not reel\n\ntoward some dark conclusion? Disappear\n\nto pale, dissolving atoms. Were you here?\n\nI brush you off: like saccharine, like a tear.\n\n911 Carousel\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“And what rough beast ... slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”―W. B. Yeats\n\nThey laugh and do not comprehend, nor ask\n\nwhich way the wind is blowing, no, nor why\n\nthe reeling azure fixture of the sky\n\ngrows pale with ash, and whispers “Holocaust.”\n\nThey think to seize the ring, life’s tinfoil prize,\n\nand, breathless with endeavor, shriek aloud.\n\nThe voice of terror thunders from a cloud\n\nthat darkens over children adult-wise,\n\nfar less inclined to error, when a step\n\nin any wrong direction is to fall\n\na JDAM short of heaven. Decoys call,\n\ntheir voices plangent, honking to be shot . . .\n\nHere, childish dreams and nightmares whirl, collide,\n\nas East and West, on slouching beasts, they ride.\n\nAt Cædmon’s Grave\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\n“Cædmon’s Hymn,” composed at the Monastery of Whitby (a North Yorkshire fishing village), is one of the oldest known poems written in the English language, dating back to around 680 A.D. According to legend, Cædmon, an illiterate Anglo-Saxon cowherd, received the gift of poetic composition from an angel; he subsequently founded a school of Christian poets. Unfortunately, only nine lines of Cædmon’s verse survive, in the writings of the Venerable Bede. Whitby, tiny as it is, reappears later in the history of English literature, having been visited, in diametric contrast, by Lewis Carroll and Bram Stoker’s ghoulish yet evocative Dracula.\n\nAt the monastery of Whitby,\n\non a day when the sun sank through the sea,\n\nand the gulls shrieked wildly, jubilant, free,\n\nwhile the wind and time blew all around,\n\nI paced those dusk-enamored grounds\n\nand thought I heard the steps resound\n\nof Carroll, Stoker and good Bede\n\nwho walked there, too, their spirits freed\n\n―perhaps by God, perhaps by need―\n\nto write, and with each line, remember\n\nthe glorious light of Cædmon’s ember,\n\nscorched tongues of flame words still engender.\n\nHere, as darkness falls, at last we meet.\n\nI lay this pale garland of words at his feet.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nRadiance\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nThe poet delves earth’s detritus―hard toil―\n\nfor raw-edged nouns, barbed verbs, vowels’ lush bouquet;\n\neach syllable his pen excretes―dense soil,\n\ndark images impacted, rooted clay.\n\nThe poet sees the sea but feels its meaning―\n\nthe teeming brine, the mirrored oval flame\n\nthat leashes and excites its turgid surface ...\n\nthen squanders years imagining love’s the same.\n\nBelatedly he turns to what lies broken―\n\nthe scarred and furrowed plot he fiercely sifts,\n\namong death’s sicksweet dungs and composts seeking\n\none element that scorches and uplifts.\n\nDowndraft\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Dylan Thomas\n\nWe feel rather than understand what he meant\n\nas he reveals a shattered firmament\n\nwhich before him never existed.\n\nHere, there are no images gnarled and twisted\n\nout of too many words,\n\nbut only flocks of white birds\n\nwheeling and flying.\n\nHere, as Time spins, reeling and dying,\n\nthe voice of a last gull\n\nor perhaps some spirit no longer whole,\n\nechoes its lonely madrigal\n\nand we feel its strange pull\n\non the astonished soul.\n\nO My Prodigal!\n\nThe vents of the sky, ripped asunder,\n\necho this wild, primal thunder—\n\nnow dying into undulations of vanishing wings . . .\n\nand this voice which in haggard bleak rapture still somehow downward sings.\n\nHuntress\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Baudelaire\n\nLynx-eyed, cat-like and cruel, you creep\n\nacross a crevice dropping deep\n\ninto a dark and doomed domain.\n\nYour claws are sheathed. You smile, insane.\n\nRain falls upon your path, and pain\n\npours down. Your paws are pierced. You pause\n\nand heed the oft-lamented laws\n\nwhich bid you not begin again\n\ntill night returns. You wail like wind,\n\nthe sighing of a soul for sin,\n\nand give up hunting for a heart.\n\nTill sunset falls again, depart,\n\nthough hate and hunger urge you―\"On!\"\n\nHeed, hearts, your hope―the break of dawn.\n\nPublished by The HyperTexts, Dracula and His Kin and Sonnetto Poesia (Canada)\n\nHappily Never After (the Second Curse of the ***** Toad)\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHe did not think of love of Her at all\n\nfrog-plangent nights, as moons engoldened roads\n\nthrough crumbling stonewalled provinces, where toads\n\n(nee princes) ruled in chinks and grew so small\n\nat last to be invisible. He smiled\n\n(the fables erred so curiously), and thought\n\nbemusedly of being reconciled\n\nto human flesh, because his heart was not\n\nincapable of love, but, being cursed\n\na second time, could only love a toad’s . . .\n\nand listened as inflated frogs rehearsed\n\ncheekbulging tales of anguish from green moats . . .\n\nand thought of her soft croak, her skin fine-warted,\n\nhis anemic flesh, and how true love was thwarted.\n\nBecause She Craved the Very Best\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBecause she craved the very best,\n\nhe took her East, he took her West;\n\nhe took her where there were no wars\n\nand brought her bright bouquets of stars,\n\nthe blush and fragrances of roses,\n\nthe hush an evening sky imposes,\n\nmoonbeams pale and garlands rare,\n\nand golden combs to match her hair,\n\na nightingale to sing all night,\n\nwhite wings, to let her soul take flight ...\n\nShe stabbed him with a poisoned sting\n\nand as he lay there dying,\n\nshe screamed, \"I wanted everything!\"\n\nand started crying.\n\nCaveat\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIf only we were not so eloquent,\n\nwe might sing, and only sing, not to impress,\n\nbut only to enjoy, to be enjoyed.\n\nWe might inundate the earth with thankfulness\n\nfor light, although it dies, and make a song\n\nof night descending on the earth like bliss,\n\nwith other lights beyond―not to be known―\n\nbut only to be welcomed and enjoyed,\n\nbefore all worlds and stars are overthrown ...\n\nas a lover’s hands embrace a sleeping face\n\nand find it beautiful for emptiness\n\nof all but joy. There is no thought to love\n\nbut love itself.

Burch\n\nA word before the light is doused: the night\n\nis something wriggling through an unclean mind,\n\nas rats creep through a tenement. And loss\n\nis written cheaply with the moon’s cracked gloss\n\nlike lipstick through the infinite, to show\n\nlove’s pale yet sordid imprint on us. Go.\n\nWe have not learned love yet, except to cleave.\n\nI saw the moon rise once ... but to believe ...\n\nwas of another century ... and now ...\n\nI have the urge to love, but not the strength.\n\nDespair, once stretched out to its utmost length,\n\nlies couched in squalor, watching as the screen\n\nreveals \"love's\" damaged images: its dreams ...\n\nand ******* limply, screams and screams.\n\nOriginally published by Sonnet Scroll\n\nMayflies\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThese standing stones have stood the test of time\n\nbut who are you\n\nand what are you\n\nand why?\n\nAs brief as mist, as transient, as pale ...\n\nInconsequential mayfly!\n\nPerhaps the thought of love inspired hope?\n\nDo midges love? Do stars bend down to see?\n\nDo gods commend the kindnesses of ants\n\nto aphids? Does one eel impress the sea?\n\nAre mayflies missed by mountains? Do the stars\n\nregret the glowworm’s stellar mimicry\n\nthe day it dies? Does not the world grind on\n\nas if it’s no great matter, not to be?\n\nLife, to be sure, is nothing much to lose.\n\nAnd yet somehow you’re everything to me.\n\nOriginally published by Clementine Unbound\n\nArtificial Smile\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI’m waiting for my artificial teeth\n\nto stretch belief, to hollow out the cob\n\nof zealous righteousness, to grasp life’s stub\n\nbetween clenched molars, and yank out the grief.\n\nMine must be art-official―zenlike Art―\n\na disembodied, white-enameled grin\n\nof Cheshire manufacture. Part by part,\n\nthe human smile becomes mock porcelain.\n\nTill in the end, the smile alone remains:\n\ntitanium-based alloys undestroyed\n\nwith graves’ worm-eaten contents, all the pains\n\nof bridgework unrecalled, and what annoyed\n\nus most about the corpses rectified\n\nto quaintest dust. The Smile winks, deified.\n\nModern Appetite\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIt grumbled low, insisting it would feast\n\non blood and flesh, etcetera, at least\n\nthree times a day. With soft lubricious grease\n\nand pale salacious oils, it would ease\n\nits way through life. Each day―an aperitif.\n\nEach night―a frothy bromide, for relief.\n\nIt lived on TV fare, wore pinafores,\n\nslurped sugar-coated gumballs, gobbled S’mores.\n\nWhen gas ensued, it burped and farted. ’Course,\n\nit thought aloud, my wife will leave me. ******\n\nare not so **** particular. Divorce\n\nis certainly a settlement, toujours!\n\nA Tums a day will keep the shrink away,\n\nrecalcify old bones, keep gas at bay.\n\nIf Simon says, etcetera, Mother, may\n\nI have my hit of calcium today?\n\nMother of Cowards\n\nby Michael R. Burch aka \"The Loyal Opposition\"\n\nSo unlike the brazen giant of Greek fame\n\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land,\n\nSpread-eagled, showering gold, a strumpet stands:\n\nA much-used trollop with a torch, whose flame\n\nHas long since been extinguished. And her name?\n\n\"Mother of Cowards!\" From her enervate hand\n\nSoft ash descends. Her furtive eyes demand\n\nAllegiance to her ****'s repulsive game.\n\n\"Keep, ancient lands, your wretched poor!\" cries she\n\nWith scarlet lips. \"Give me your hale, your whole,\n\nYour huddled tycoons, yearning to be pleased!\n\nThe wretched refuse of your toilet hole?\n\nOh, never send one unwashed child to me!\n\nI await Trump's pleasure by the gilded bowl!\"\n\nOriginally published by Light\n\nPremonition\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nNow the evening has come to a close and the party is over ...\n\nwe stand in the doorway and watch as they go―\n\neach stranger, each acquaintance, each unembraceable lover.\n\nThey walk to their cars and they laugh as they go,\n\nthough we know their warm laughter’s the wine ...\n\nthen they pause at the road where the dark asphalt flows\n\nendlessly on toward Zion ...\n\nand they kiss one another as though they were friends,\n\nand they promise to meet again “soon” ...\n\nbut the rivers of Jordan roll on without end,\n\nand the mockingbird calls to the moon ...\n\nand the katydids climb up the cropped hanging vines,\n\nand the crickets chirp on out of tune ...\n\nand their shadows, defined by the cryptic starlight,\n\nseem spirits torn loose from their tombs.\n\nAnd I know their brief lives are just eddies in time,\n\nthat their hearts are unreadable runes\n\nto be wiped clean, like slate, by the dark hand of fate\n\nwhen their corpses lie ravaged and ruined ...\n\nYou take my clenched fist and you give it a kiss\n\nas though it were something you loved,\n\nand the tears fill your eyes, brimming with the soft light\n\nof the stars winking gently above ...\n\nThen you whisper, \"It's time that we went back inside;\n\nif you'd like, we can sit and just talk for a while.\"\n\nAnd the hope in your eyes burns too deep, so I lie\n\nand I say, \"Yes, I would,\" to your small, troubled smile.\n\nI rather vividly remember writing this poem after an office party the year I co-oped with AT&T (at that time the largest company in the world, with presumably a lot of office parties). This would have been after my sophomore year in college, making me around 20 years old. The poem is “true” except that I was not the host because the party was at the house of one of the upper-level managers. Nor was I dating anyone seriously at the time.\n\nYour e-Verse\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the posters and posers on www.fillintheblank.com\n\nI cannot understand a word you’ve said\n\n(and this despite an adequate I.Q.);\n\nit must be some exotic new haiku\n\ncombined with Latin suddenly undead.\n\nIt must be hieroglyphics mixed with Greek.\n\nHave Pound and T.

S. Eliot's \"Fire Sermon: (1) The Celts believed that the health of the land was tied to the health of its king. The Fisher King's land was in peril because he had a physical infirmity. One bad harvest and it was the king's fault for displeasing the gods. A religious icon (the Grail) could somehow rescue him. Strange logic! (2) The next stage brings us the saints, the Catholic church, etc. Millions are slaughtered, tortured and enslaved in the name of religion. Strange logic! (3) The next stage brings us to Darwin, modernism and \"The Waste Land.” Religion is dead. God is dead. Man is a glorified fungus! We'll evolve into something better adapted to life on Earth, someday, if we don’t destroy it. But billions continue to believe in and worship ancient “gods.” Strange logic! (4) The current stage of religion is summed up by this e-mail: the only way religion can compete today is as a form of flashy entertainment. ***** a website before it's too late.

Burch\n\nHas rhyme lost all its reason\n\nand rhythm, renascence?\n\nAre sonnets out of season\n\nand poems but poor pretense?\n\nAre poets lacking fire,\n\ntheir words too trite and forced?\n\nWhat happened to desire?\n\nHas passion been coerced?\n\nShall poetry fade slowly,\n\nlike Latin, to past tense?\n\nAre the bards too high and holy,\n\nor their readers merely dense?\n\nPlastic Art or Night Stand\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nDisclaimer: This is a poem about artificial poetry, not love dolls! The victim is the Muse.\n\nWe never questioned why “love” seemed less real\n\nthe more we touched her, and forgot her face.\n\nAbsorbed in molestation’s sticky feel,\n\nwe failed to see her staring into space,\n\nher doll-like features frozen in a smile.\n\nShe held us in her marionette’s embrace,\n\nher plastic flesh grown wet and slick and vile.\n\nWe groaned to feel our urgent fingers trace\n\nher undemanding body. All the while,\n\nshe lay and gaily bore her brief disgrace.\n\nWe loved her echoed passion’s squeaky air,\n\nher tongueless kisses’ artificial taste,\n\nthe way she matched, then raised our reckless pace,\n\nthe heart that seemed to pound, but was not there.\n\n“Whoso List to Hunt” is a famous early English sonnet written by Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-1542) in the mid-16th century.\n\nWhoever Longs to Hunt\n\nby Sir Thomas Wyatt\n\nloose translation/interpretation/modernization by Michael R. Burch\n\nWhoever longs to hunt, I know the deer;\n\nbut as for me, alas!, I may no more.\n\nThis vain pursuit has left me so bone-sore\n\nI'm one of those who falters, at the rear.\n\nYet friend, how can I draw my anguished mind\n\naway from the doe?\n\nThus, as she flees before\n\nme, fainting I follow.\n\nI must leave off, therefore,\n\nsince in a net I seek to hold the wind.\n\nWhoever seeks her out,\n\nI relieve of any doubt,\n\nthat he, like me, must spend his time in vain.\n\nFor graven with diamonds, set in letters plain,\n\nthese words appear, her fair neck ringed about:\n\nTouch me not, for Caesar's I am,\n\nAnd wild to hold, though I seem tame.\n\nAlien Nation\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor J. S. S., a \"Christian\" poet who believes in “hell”\n\nOn a lonely outpost on Mars\n\nthe astronaut practices “speech”\n\nas alien to primates below\n\nas mute stars winking high, out of reach.\n\nAnd his words fall as bright and as chill\n\nas ice crystals on Kilimanjaro―\n\nfar colder than Jesus’s words\n\nover the “fortunate” sparrow.\n\nAnd I understand how gentle Emily\n\nfelt, when all comfort had flown,\n\ngazing into those inhuman eyes,\n\nfeeling zero at the bone.\n\nOh, how can I grok his arctic thought?\n\nFor if he is human, I am not.\n\nKeywords/Tags: sonnet, sonnets, meter, rhythm, music, musical, rhyme, form, formal verse, formalist, tradition, traditional, romantic, romanticism, rose, fire, passion, desire, love, heart, number, numbers, mrbson\n\nMichael R Burch Oct 2020\n\nPoems about Flight, Flying, Flights of Fancy, Kites, Leaves, Butterflies, Birds and Bees\n\nFlight\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\n(for Leslie Mellichamp, the late editor of The Lyric,\n\nwho was a friend and mentor to many poets, and\n\na fine poet in his own right)\n\nThe stars were always there, too-bright cliches:\n\nscintillant truths the jaded world outgrew\n\nas baffled poets winged keyed kites—amazed,\n\nin dream of shocks that suddenly came true...\n\nbut came almost as static—background noise,\n\na song out of the cosmos no one hears,\n\nor cares to hear. The poets, starstruck boys,\n\nlay tuned in to their kite strings, saucer-eared.\n\nThey thought to feel the lightning’s brilliant sparks\n\nelectrify their nerves, their brains; the smoke\n\nof words poured from their overheated hearts.\n\nThe kite string, knotted, made a nifty rope...\n\nYou will not find them here; they blew away—\n\nin tumbling flight beyond nights’ stars. They clung\n\nby fingertips to satellites. They strayed\n\ntoo far to remain mortal. Elfin, young,\n\ntheir words are with us still. Devout and fey,\n\nthey wink at us whenever skies are gray.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nAmerican Eagle, Grounded\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nI caress them—trapped in brittle cellophane—\n\nand I see how young they were, and how unwise;\n\nand I remember their first flight—an old prop plane,\n\ntheir blissful arc through alien blue skies...\n\nAnd I touch them here through leaves which—tattered, frayed—\n\nare also wings, but wings that never flew:\n\nlike insects’ wings—pinned, held. Here, time delayed,\n\ntheir features never merged, remaining two...\n\nAnd Grief, which lurked unseen beyond the lens\n\nor in shadows where It crept on furtive claws\n\nas It scritched Its way into their hearts, depends\n\non sorrows such as theirs, and works Its jaws...\n\nand slavers for Its meat—those young, unwise,\n\nwho naively dare to dream, yet fail to see\n\nhow, lumbering sunward, Hope, ungainly, flies,\n\nclutching to Her ruffled breast what must not be.\n\nSpringtime Prayer\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky\n\nwhile the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our bodies to some famished ocean\n\nand laugh as they vanish, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze...\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the heights of awareness from which we were seized.\n\nPublished by Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly, The Chained Muse and Poetry Life & Times.
