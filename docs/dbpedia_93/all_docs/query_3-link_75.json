        "text": "That Caribbean music forms and their sonic influences are steeped in a vibrant culture of social awareness and ethereal consciousness is incontestable. Roots reggae’s protest appeal, rhythmic syncopations, and deeply religious impulses attest to a rich, aware and reactive tradition forged from post-slavery legacies to engage the rotary realities of mid–late 20th century West Indies. Contemporary Caribbean reggae follows in this tradition. With a very deep root in the religious beliefs of the people, Reggae music developed as the medium for the masses to cope with the social, economic and political realities of the day in Jamaica and many other Caribbean communities. Consequently, the Reggae music has proven to be relevant as long as there is suffering and injustices among the masses, this is not to say Reggae music does not reflect some other aspects of life. The emphasis in this paper is to trace the history and development of Reggae, especially its connection to the Rastafari life...\n\nThe intermixing of literary, oral and performance cultures has long been the bedrock of Caribbean writing. Through an analysis of contemporary writing by Anthony Joseph, Nalo Hopkinson, Monique Roffey, Marcia Douglas, Robert Antoni, Nicolás Guillén and Tanya Shirley, this essay demonstrates how contemporary Caribbean writing embraces popular culture to challenge Euro- and American-centric ideologies and destabilize the perceived boundaries between oral and scribal cultures. Popular culture in these texts challenges the writer to experiment with form, language and rhythm rooted in call-and-response, folklore traditions, and Caribbean musical forms such as reggae, calypso, dancehall, mento, zouk, bélé and Afro-Cuban drumming. Drawing from conceptualizations of Caribbean culture in the work of critics Gerard Aching, Antonio Benítez-Rojo, Kevin Adonis Browne, Carolyn Cooper and Kwame Dawes, this essay demonstrates how the oral is always whispering below the surface of the written text as Caribbean authors permeate their writings with soundscapes of Caribbean languages and music. Importantly too, drawing from the rich cultural traditions of the region also becomes a means through which the poetic and literary become explicitly political. These writers fulfil Kamau Brathwaite’s celebrated call in ‘Jazz and the West Indian Novel’ for the Caribbean artist to draw from and acclaim their indigenous, local cultural forms and commu- nity; yet they also adapt and adopt popular culture with a critical eye, particularly in relation to the misogyny and sexism often performed within dancehall and carnival cultures.\n\nOwing to the legacies of slavery and indentureship, Trinidad and Tobago’s population is composed largely of the descendants of enslaved Africans and indentured Indian people as well as relatively small but demo- graphically important numbers of Venezuelans, Amerindians, Chinese, Europeans, and other groups. Today, Trinbagonian identity centers on a pronounced fusion of these groups’ constituent cultures, with the annual Carnival celebration serving as a potent metaphor for such cultural mixing. Despite state-promoted rhetoric of an inclusive multiculturalism, African- and Indian-Trinidadian interests are most prominent in national cultural politics as these groups vie for state representation and subsidy of their respective interests and traditions. This is reflected in the styles of music regarded as distinctly Trinidadian, many of which feature African- or Indian-derived characteristics, which is the focus of this article. This entry examines the legacy of Amerindian and Latin American music in Trinidad and Tobago, the development of music in Trinidad and Tobago in the 19th to 20th centuries, and the influence of Indian musical traditions on Trinidadian music.\n\nThis paper explores the issues of ethnicity and identity in the post‐colonial Caribbean with special reference to Trinidad and Tobago. As with other multi‐ethnic post‐colonial societies, the collapse of post‐World‐War II promises of unified national projects based on the nation‐state or class politics has seen the re‐emergence of racial/ethnic based trajectories. In the context of the contestations of ethnicity, class, and gender in Trinidad and Tobago, the voice of the “Dougla,” or those projecting “dougla identities” of mixed African and Indian ancestry, has been largely missing. Unlike in the North, conceptions of “mixed” identity have existed in the region for many decades. A concept of multiracial identity, however, is relatively new and underdeveloped. This paper explores tentative attempts through the popular culture to express such multiracial identities, especially through the medium of Calypso and Soca and the contestations that greet such an emergence. The dynamics of the changing social, political, and cultural context are also taken into consideration. It does so through the contrasting 1996 “hits” of two singer/songwriters in the Calypso /Soca genre, Brother Marvin and Chris Garcia. Key words: Dougla, Ethnicity, Culture, Gender, Trinidad and Tobago\n\nThis paper addresses the complexities involved in developing cultural policies in the Anglophone Caribbean. The first section examines the evolution of the cultural policy agenda in the 40-odd years since the independence era. It traces and analyses the policy trajectory from one that sought to promote the intrinsic values of culture, to one that currently espouses the more instrumental value of the cultural industries. The next section analyses the efficacy of the policy path by examining a regional cultural policy initiative, the Caribbean Festival for the Arts (CARIFESTA). The paper suggests that the Caribbean cultural policies have under performed because of critical disjunctures. These generally involve the imposition of a nationalistic policy framework on the transnational structure of the Caribbean cultural sector. The paper concludes by suggesting a regional cultural approach to policy formulation can provide a more effective mechanism to encourage and harness the cultural wealth of the Anglophone Caribbean. The Anglophone Caribbean 1 is perhaps best known for its dynamic cultural expressions , and the wealth of its cultural assets and resources. From the musical stylings of reggae icon Bob Marley, to the poetic musings of Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott, and the splendor of Trinidad and Tobago's overseas Carnival complex, the cultural products of the Caribbean have secured a place in the global cultural marketplace. In the 40-odd years since the region's independence from Britain, many aspects of Caribbean culture are clearly discernible in global entertainment products including music, film and video, and the visual arts. However, these accomplishments have occurred in large part, without the sustained benefit of local and regional cultural policy support. Notwithstanding the ongoing pronouncements of successive political regimes regarding the central role of culture, and more specifically, of cultural policies in the overall development of the region, the Anglo-phone Caribbean has acquired a poor record of cultural policy activation. With the possible exception of Jamaica, and more latterly Barbados and St Lucia, few countries in the region have developed clearly articulated policy positions. 2 What has emerged in the post independence period is a set of practices, programmes, and texts that are philosophically grounded in a nationalist framework, and activated through the Ministries of Culture and other public sector agencies. This approach to cultural policy development has yielded"
