The essay was meant to shed light on the grief expectant parents experience after miscarriage. I employed the usual academic tools, from literature review to final edits. Done. And not done. Not really. And, as it turns out, probably not ever. I know intimately the physical and emotional wreckage that accompanies pregnancy loss. I also know that 15–­20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage. I have learned that partners grieve lost pregnancies, my husband, Henry, included. What started as a purely academic endeavor—­a phenomenology of miscarriage—­became, philosophically speaking, self-­involved. Writing about miscarriage\n\nvii\n\nopened up the psychic space where I (perhaps we) store the defining fixtures of life’s emotional landscape: loss, rejection, and trauma as well as achievement, acceptance, and resolution. This book was born out of a single academic project, a collection of personal experiences, and an ongoing exploration of women’s search for self. Athena to Barbie exposes and honors women’s bodily and psychic markings. I trace the search for identity with a womb and female form in a world that tells women who they are because of their reproductive roles and bodily parts. The real work of the womb (from the negative moment of women’s historic oppression toward the positive potential of a better future) and the real work of feminist philosophy (from an identification with woman’s Otherness toward a resistance to sexist norms) requires an unraveling of the logic of woman­ hood. We must reconsider historic sources of self and establish generative understandings of what and who we are. Experiencing oneself as a woman demands a confrontation with the womb. Archetypal ideals weigh heavily in women’s search for self. Female archetypes produce idealized standards of womanhood that discipline the body and shape the mind. Archetypal ideals also weigh heavily in religion, politics, society, economics, and ultimately, in the status of women themselves. Athena to Barbie surveys four female archetypes that inform women’s identity. Collective archetypal material—­from imagery, inferences, and reception—­directs women’s navigation of life in a presumptively reproductive body. Archetypes also influence how women exercise the\n\nviii Preface\n\nagency and authority vested in the womb. I appeal to Simone de Beauvoir as I consider reproductive (and nonreproductive) female bodies—­women are their bodies in a way that men are not. Her account of female alienation and subordination in The Second Sex, along with her articulation, new at the time, of a woman’s loss of personal and social identity, coheres with feelings of failure, isolation, and malformation women associate with female embodiment. I draw on Virginia Woolf, who theorizes women’s inability to articulate female experiences in A Room of One’s Own—­women lack a language of their own because they have had too little education, privacy, and subsistence to form female literary traditions. Speaking about pregnancy and miscarriage from a philosophical perspective is practically inconceivable. More than 80 percent of academic philosophers are men; the life and language of philosophy are predisposed to male experiences of reality, experiences often formulated as universal truths. I deploy the radical Jewish feminist philosopher Andrea Dworkin, feminism’s Old Testament prophet who cries out in the wilderness of female oppression. I am compelled by her argument that intercourse has a political meaning—­that female subordination is inextricably bound up with the use of women’s bodies for sexual gratification and, either intentionally or accidentally, reproduction. Intercourse is a key to women’s lower human status. Beauvoir, Woolf, and Dworkin represent different streams of feminist thought. But they share a critical concern for the meaning, role, and value of female bodies and wombs. For women to become fully agential subjects—­persons who exercise\n\nPreface ix\n\nself-­determination, enjoy self-­respect, command authority, and exhibit integrity—­intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth must undergo philosophical examination. My analysis develops out of productive counterpoints that elevate the body without predefining its meaning. Jack Halberstam, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Amy Mullin, Kelly Oliver, Adrienne Rich, Sissel Undheim, Cynthia Willett, and Iris Marion Young treat embodiment as a site of resistance to rather than complicity with bodily control. Their positions on gendered subjectivity include the claim that pregnancy is (or can be) a creative and expansive experience rather than a reductive and disempowering act. Many helpfully problematize the female condition without erasing the feminine body entirely. They refine the question of womanhood—­from trans-­womanhood to cis-­womanhood—­and make space for persons who exemplify new performances of woman, performances that overlap, parallel, and intersect one another. Archetypal bodies and the various meanings of pregnancy they signify can serve as a powerful heuristic for living as a woman. Retheorizing pregnancy can create new understandings of embodiment and contest established meanings of femininity. Reimagining womanhood and recontextualizing archetypal knowledge can yield positive readings of the pregnant subject by encompassing both the realization that women have suffered oppression vis-­à-­vis pregnancy and the hope that women can recast pregnancy as an empowering experience. Assigning positive value to female bodies and the labor they perform helps disclose the forces that diminish women’s lives and push back against them. Pregnancy\n\nx Preface\n\ncan serve as a site of feminist resistance to oppression, enable a reclamation of female freedom, and expand the experience of becoming a woman. All women, whether or not they are mothers, must negotiate the womb. I am especially grateful to many strong women who have supported this project. Heidi Bostic deserves heaps of praise for reading multiple versions of the manuscript. Her always incisive insights shored up gaps in my analysis and challenged my thinking in all the best ways. She cheered me on during bouts of exhaustion, refusing to let me quit. She and her spouse, Stephen Pluháček, a gifted philosopher and interlocutor, have supported and enriched my work immensely. Heidi and Steve make life richer. Anne-­Marie Schultz, my philosophical muse and treasured friend, has been fiercely dedicated to my work. She enabled my progress by advocating for course releases and sabbatical support. She also read and shaped early chapters of the book and spurred me on through encouraging texts, emails, and phone calls. Anne’s generosity and tenacity have enhanced my life, elevated my work, and expanded my academic interests. I cherish our conversations and shared experiences as female philosophers. My Women Faculty Writing Program cohort, led by Lisa Shaver, Kara Poe Alexander, and Julie Holcomb, has been exceptionally supportive. Drafts of the book were completed during our dedicated writing time every Friday afternoon. Other women academics—­women leaders at Baylor University, former and current colleagues in the Baylor Interdisciplinary Core (BIC), and friends at other institutions—­have inspired my work in direct and\n\nPreface xi\n\nindirect ways. I am especially grateful for the support and parallel efforts of Mary Atwell, Robyn Driskell, Beverly Gaventa, Danielle Tumminio Hansen, Mandy McMichael, Jacqueline-­Bethel Mougoué, Anne Lewis Osler, and Sarah Walden. They question the unquestioned, marginal position of women in history and culture. Their scholarly pursuits have emboldened me to take up subjects dismissed, even ridiculed, by mainstream philosophers. I gladly join them in exploring the crimped edges of female identity. Many former women students are present in this work as well. Conversations with Skye Perryman, Aya Farhat, Adina Kelley, Hilary Yancey, Teresa Dean, and Angelica Mazé have caused me to confront my philosophical commitments and rethink gender identity in broader terms. I thank them for making me a better person and teacher. Many male supporters and allies deserve special recognition too. My “new faculty orientation” friends Andy Arterbury and Doug Weaver have been anchors throughout my academic journey and, with respect to this project, provided remarkable help with chapter 1. Their commitment to women’s equality has inspired nearly two decades of honest conversations. I am immensely grateful for our friendship of the good, to borrow Aristotle’s term. I also thank Karl Aho, Paul Carron, Jesse Jordan, Chuck McDaniel, and Mike Whitenton, former and current members of my BIC Writing Group, for their generous spirits and good minds. My BIC colleague Sam Perry supplied reassuring notes during many weekend writing marathons. He buoyed my spirits with music recommendations too. Joshua Smith\n\nxii Preface\n\nserved as an exceptional research assistant early in the project. Former mentees and teaching assistants Aaron Ellis, John Garza, Yunus Prasetya, and John Rosenbaum have been superb conversationalists and co-­teachers. Finally, I am steadfastly grateful to progressive male thinkers who set the stage for women’s success at Baylor and played pivotal roles in my professional development. Bob Baird, Bill Bellinger, Ray Cannon, Tom Hanks, David Longfellow, and the late Carl Vaught are foremost among them. I cherish them all. I am grateful to Baylor University and the Honors College for a semester research leave, without which this book would never have materialized. I owe a special thank-­ you to my administrative colleagues in the Academy for Teaching and Learning (ATL), Craig Clarkson and Christopher Richmann. Craig’s exemplary management of the ATL erased my concerns about devoting time to this project. His engagement with the book’s central argument—­ and playful encouragement of my feminist side—­fostered delightful, intellectual exchange. Christopher’s steady hand at the tiller, advancing the work of the ATL each and every day, aptly kept the ATL afloat. Finally, there cannot exist more winsome, supportive colleagues than Lyndsay DiPietro and Austin Smith, who pulled extra ATL duty to make the book possible. I am honored to serve alongside these four stellar human beings. I owe another special thank-­ you to Leslie Ballard, who is nothing short of a miracle worker. Les tackled the difficult task of putting this book together by tracking down references, formatting citations,\n\nPreface xiii\n\nand preparing bibliographic information. His steady pace of productivity helped me stick to my established timeline. I also wish to acknowledge the outside readers for Fortress Press who took time to offer invaluable comments on the manuscript draft. Carey Newman is a superb editor in every sense of the term. He understands good writing and directs ideas toward productive ends. He also possesses an exhaustive knowledge of the publishing world, though his investment in books never eclipses his investment in the writers who produce them. Carey grasped Athena to Barbie right away and believed in the book from the first sketchy outline to the final footnote. He has been an exemplary advocate and sounding board. I cannot thank him enough for his energy, encouragement, and insights. It has been an honor to work with him and the team of professionals at Fortress Press. I have enjoyed more than one lighthearted exchange with Esther Diley and Elvis Ramirez. I am incapable of adequately expressing my praise and gratitude for Henry Wright. He rolled up his sleeves again to support me, from taking our children on day trips so that I could write to securing copyright permissions for the book images. He graciously indulged conversations about each chapter and offered perceptive input. Everyone should have at least one person who believes in them more than they believe in themselves. Henry is my person. We fell in love over (and with) philosophy. I have stayed nestled in the world of ideas while he has mastered other professional domains, the world of law among them. Despite his\n\nxiv Preface\n\narray of accomplishments, he still delights in a keen philosophical conversation, eager to return time and again to a subject he loves. I dedicate Athena to Barbie to Henry William Wright II and our beloved children, Henry Wallace Wright II (H. W.) and Carl Haze Wright.\n\nPreface xv\n\nIntroduction\n\nBut, you may say, this is a book about womanhood. It is a\n\nstory of female identity and women’s deeply mythic sources of self-­knowing. What has that got to do with the womb? I will try to explain.1 A pregnant subject on a throne, that classical symbol of authority, sanctioning woman as mother. Her foot atop a marker identifying interior anatomical structures. Her nude body on display. Her abdominal cavity opened to expose a fetus inside. She is neither immobile nor moving. She balances herself on the edge of her seat, unaware of the figures who gaze at her from above. She is oblivious to us, her immediate viewers. She is also blind to the generations of medical students who studied her from\n\n1\n\nthe pages of a textbook for which Charles Estienne made her. The image’s urban setting, with its visual references to scientific and technological advances, reflects the growth of the city in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Yet as her representation makes clear, a woman’s contribution to civic life lies in reproduction. Her role is to populate the city, a role that neither individuates her as a human being nor distinguishes her from other women. She lacks any sign of self-­awareness, any indication of a rational capacity. She is a reproductive creature.\n\nCharles Estienne (ca. 1504–1564) [author]. Étienne de la Rivière (d. 1569) [anatomist]. De dissection partium corporis humani libri tres. Paris, 1545. Woodcut. National Library of Medicine, U.S.A.\n\n2 Athena to Barbie\n\nBy contrast, the figure in a 1773 mezzotint by Jacques Fabien Gautier d’Agoty tells a different story. She is a particular rather than an archetypal woman, a woman who appears to experience pregnancy as a knowing subject. Her face bears a stoic, Roman quality in keeping with the neoclassical elements of late eighteenth-­century art. She crosses her arms over her skinned body—­she is, unlike Estienne’s figure, flayed from the neck down—­and coyly eyes her audience, playfully acknowledging their gaze. She communicates an understanding of her role in anatomical study and\n\nJacques Fabien Gautier d’Agoty, Anatomie des parties de la génértion de l’homme et de la femme (1773), National Library of Medicine, U.S.A.\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nconsciously participates in the unveiling of her uterine wall. She is, to use the literary idiom, “enlivened,” offering a notable counterpoint to the docility Estienne equates with pregnancy. Her living subjectivity redraws the line between life and death, portraying an impossible condition for the sake of medical understanding. Her paradoxical depiction of lived experience invites a rich reading of the pregnant subject. The question that opens this book—­the question of womanhood and the womb—­takes the form of the opening query of Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. Woolf situates her exploration of woman’s nature in the context of literature. She wonders aloud, addressing an unseen audience, what women and fiction have to do with a room of one’s own. She offers a partial conclusion—­“a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction”—­before she advances an analysis of womanhood as such.2 Athena to Barbie resituates the Woolfian exploration of woman in the context of the wombed body. Wombs and woman signify one another. Neither progressive politics nor postmodern critiques has undone their conceptual co-­ mingling. One cannot easily disentangle woman from womb given the regressive mood of the historical moment and—­perhaps more so—­because of our cultural (and deeply internalized) attachments to wombs and what they represent. In truth, the concept of “womb” teems with meaning that transcends person, time, and place yet also shapes women’s lived, bodily realities. Wombs are not uteruses. Conceived as carriers of life, wombs contain and nurture life while the uterus may be\n\n4 Athena to Barbie\n\nempty—­of a fetus as well as connotations of care. The womb is posited as woman’s essence, her true nature. It is the perceived locus of female power. Because nature circumscribes identity, what women are (reproductive beings) defines who women are: nurturers and caregivers. Female identity is therefore tied to a wombed, nurturing body. Any agency and authority women enjoy emerge from the womb. Whereas wombs nurture life, pregnancy signifies a range of complex meanings—­it has negative and positive valances. Women have learned to negotiate these diverse concepts and associations with their bodies from anatomical definitions to cultural ideals. But the experience of navigating life as a wombed person is stubbornly unchanged.3 Pregnancy proves a perpetual paradox for female identity. In ways both subtle and obvious, pregnancy has been transformed by modern technology and culture as well as legal, medical, and political reform. Still, women find themselves constrained by their reproductive marking and lack the encouragement and imagination to resignify their embodied situations. The womb underlies this troubling reality. Woman as womb is not a fixed idea. She can be figured through four archetypes of the wombed body: Mary, womb as sacred space; Athena, womb as political space; Venus, womb as erotic space; and Barbie, womb as material space. Archetypal pregnant subjects authorize repressive imaginings about women’s bodies, but they also invite powerful resistance. They capture both the negative contours of females who suffer oppression vis-­à-­vis pregnancy and the positive contours of females who recast pregnancy as an\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nempowering experience. Athena to Barbie challenges women’s subordination by uncovering models of wombed labor that sanction diverse modes of womanhood. Feminist interrogations of the body can unravel the logic of female identity and label the ideologies that inform them. Within this exploration of womanhood and wombs, “woman” represents a narrative construction or sign of the female subject rather than an anatomically defined person. Constructing woman as a discursive and iconographic sign helps readers see how archetypes like Athena continue to influence contemporary female identity. Narrative constructions of woman also recognize persons who identify as women but lack uteruses (due to a hysterectomy, for example) as full female subjects. Normatively feminine bodies appear in the ideologies of woman examined here. But such bodies are not identified as essential to the definition of “woman.” Regret pervades this work. For most of philosophy’s history, almost no thought has been given to the idea that female embodiment has philosophical significance. The historic equating of the dictum “Know thyself” with “Know thy mind” coupled with the unstated assumption that minds are male have deprived philosophers of grappling with what it means to live in a body, see embodiment as a component of self-­identity, and treat bodily signification as a complex element of the human condition. This book is committed to overcoming this loss by honoring embodiment—­female embodiment in particular—­as worthy of profound philosophical reflection. Along with regret, this work is born\n\n6 Athena to Barbie\n\nof hope that philosophy can recover a practice of valuing women and wombs fully. For what, and for whom, women’s bodies may be used remains contested. Exposing the weight of the womb for female experience and identity—­critiquing the womb through the perspective of feminist philosophy—­both challenges the subordination of reproductive bodies and invites a subject-­ centered reimagining of pregnancy. The pregnant body uniquely elucidates women’s struggle for subjectivity: for autonomy, voice, meaning, and standing. Sexually differentiated roles and responsibilities such as childbearing have been invoked to exploit, marginalize, and disempower women. Nuanced readings of the body along with a greater valuing of bodily acts—­appreciation for occupations that rely on physical labor and respect for laboring with the body—­can also recast the ideology of reproduction in an affirming light. Pregnancy, realized in literal and figurative ways, can offer a woman demonstrative control over her life, allowing her to do what she wishes in an embodied way, not by denying her womb, but by navigating the ambiguity of her embodied identity. Athena to Barbie offers a path toward claiming female subjectivity in the face of the significant forces that undermine it. The archetypal female figure Mary opens this analysis for two reasons. First, the book takes inspiration from Woolf’s extended essay A Room of One’s Own, which begins with Mary. Woolf invokes the Scottish ballad of Mary Hamilton (Hamilton is to be hanged) to exemplify the insignificance of women. She disclaims the “I,” the presumed omniscient\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nnarrator, in favor of the Marys named in the ballad: Queen Mary, Mary Seaton, Mary Beaton, Mary Carmichael, “and me [Mary Hamilton].”4 Some readers regard Hamilton as the underlying voice of A Room of One’s Own, a voice without value as her name “is not a matter of any importance.”5 Although Woolf’s stated purpose is to discuss women and fiction, her larger textual aim is to address the insidious problem of female inequality. Woolf asks whether women’s progress is possible given their educational, cultural, and economic poverty. Woolf’s Marys proffer an answer: women need money and freedom, a room of their own, to become fully who they are. The freedom to earn a wage, the courage to pursue one’s passions, requires effort and determination. Woolf employs the metaphor of childbirth to describe the outcome of this emancipatory work: “she will put on the body which she has so often laid down,” and “she will be born.”6 Her freedom, her self-­realization, comes with an ironic cost. “The economists are telling us,” Woolf writes, “that Mrs. Seton [sic] has had too many children. You must, of course, go on bearing children, but, so they say, in twos and threes, not in tens and twelves.”7 Woolf recognizes that to be born or not to be born—­to choose the difficult task of becoming a fully agential self—­is a feminist question.8 A second reason the book begins with Mary is that the biblical Mary, mother of the Christian Messiah Jesus, is the exemplar of womanhood par excellence. The discourse surrounding pregnancy and motherhood reverberates with Mary’s presence. Her performance of pregnancy\n\n8 Athena to Barbie\n\nso thoroughly dominates the ideology of femininity that nearly every claim about the pregnant subject can be traced to her. Reading wombed bodies, then, necessarily begins with Mary and moves thematically through divergent archetypes of pregnant subjects. Mary plays an essential role in the production of female identity and experience. Mary—­and Athena, Venus, and Barbie—­materializes the relationship between women’s wombs and female subordination. Women remain subordinate to men by multiple measures including access to economic and political power. Women’s wombs have everything to do with this social calculation. What the female body is, what it does or performs, and what it represents remain significant for women and the world they inhabit. If a woman is not a womb yet has a womb, to employ the language of Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex, she must navigate the changing forces that operate on her body and define her. If a woman is not a womb but has an impregnated womb, she must navigate the sometimes-­tacit norms of both womanhood and pregnancy: she is not her womb, but her womb is visible. Her uterus, normally unseen, is on display; physicians measure it, and technicians peer inside it. She cannot dictate its size, nor can she hide it. Her body redefines her, diminishing other aspects of her being and self-­identity—­her rational capacity, for one thing, and her existential situation, for another. Her womb becomes the element of her embodiment most salient to viewers and, in some cases, to herself, reinforcing an already contracted understanding of the body. In short, the central law of patriarchy—­women must respect the\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nboundaries of their gender—­is heightened during pregnancy (but always present because of woman’s reproductive body). The ambiguity of pregnancy offers women an occasion to rethink what it means and how it feels to live, think, and act as a woman. Feminism cannot resolve the ambiguity of female identity. Being a woman with a womb remains as vexed as ever. But feminist critiques can elevate women’s embodied subjectivity by resisting readings of the womb that sanction female subordination. Women should experience their bodies as part of their wholeness and agency in the world. Women must recognize and compel others to recognize embodiment in all its forms as a source and site of human subjectivity. If this analysis of womanhood and wombs succeeds, it will disrupt for a moment, at least among readers, the mediation and regulation of female subjects by calling out oppressive ideologies and norms that operate on wombed bodies. Let us interrogate pregnancy for ways to locate and generate bodily meaning as we search for self.\n\n10 Athena to Barbie\n\n1 Delivering Mary Womb as Sacred Space\n\nHail Mary, full of grace. Our Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. —­The Hail Mary\n\nMary is remembered and revered for her womb.1 Her pow-\n\nerful performance of pregnancy looms large in theological imaginings. Yet she transcends theological readings to take on a central archetypal role of the feminine in the Western world. She signs woman as womb, a source of sanctifying activity. She places the female body in a spiritual field of\n\n11\n\nmeaning, defying reductive readings of wombs and the women who carry them. She makes wombs sacred: wombs perform a divine act. They (re)produce and birth children of God, uniting divinity and humanity. Yet even within this Marian archetype, embodied feminine performances create a normative equivalency between womanhood and motherhood, one that women are right to resist. A woman is not just a womb. Nor is she fundamentally an object, an opening, an Other, though she has become these things.2 Mary’s body teems with cultural meanings that enable and disable forms of female agency that women need to live fruitfully.3 Attending to Mary’s womb opens up a fertile space for feminist reflection on the reproductive body, a space that may deliver Mary from a narrow reading of female subjectivity. Reading Mary’s womb through a feminist lens serves to reconceive femininity without its embedded, motherly ideals and reimagine the womb as a generative space that produces female practices (and recodes femininity) in literal and metaphoric ways.4 Mary is an important archetype of woman because she so thoroughly embodies the paradoxical poles of wombed subjectivity: bodily immanence and miraculous transcendence. She is and is not her womb. She is and is not a conventional woman. She can and cannot control her lived experience. Mary reflects the reality of female personhood: women are and are not their pregnant bodies. Women no longer need to argue they are more than a womb. But in what sense more is yet to be realized. Conventional views of the feminine—­the idea of a distinguishing quality, nature,\n\n12 Athena to Barbie\n\nor essence of woman or a defining, distinctive feature of female experience—­ retreat from dated scientific tropes. Although woman is not biologically “The Sex” any longer, contemporary performances of femininity retain an essentialist edge: woman is a material and semiotic body that reproduces male power. She is already and always defined by cultural readings of her anatomy, by the significations of her bodily parts and the cultural uses and disciplining of her anatomy—­for aesthetic pleasure, sexual gratification, and domestic labor, most especially human reproduction. She has yet to fully realize herself as more than a subjugated category of persons: a female person (woman) differentiated from a male person (man) by bodily function (pregnancy) and presentation (femininity). She has yet to fully experience personhood as a subject rather than an object: as an autonomous, rational, moral, and spiritual agent who can deliver herself from subjugation by resignifying what and who she is apart from her reproductive capacity and feminine identity. She has yet to fully activate her womb, a site of literal and figurative creative activity, as a source of self-­identity.5 Pregnancy exposes a submerged and powerful truth about female body-­subjects: women’s bodies perform personhood in ways that men’s bodies do not.6 Bodies with wombs are circumscribed by their wombed activity (and inactivity). Identifying woman with womb and signifying womb as a sacred and fundamental source of female agency produce an enigmatic tension within pregnant subjectivity—­a dual attribution of pregnancy as a passive,\n\nDelivering Mary 13\n\ngenerically female, bodily phenomenon and a powerful, feminine, individuating, spiritual activity. Reading Mary’s performance of pregnancy as a sacred, sacrificial act both reinforces and challenges the cultural conception of woman as womb. The signification of womb as sacred authorizes repressions of female sexuality and restrictions on women’s reproductive choice. The evangelical Protestant and Roman Catholic espousal of chastity, opposition to abortion, repression of female authority, and conflation of pregnancy with motherhood codify marriage as an essential pathway for female flourishing and a necessary marker of femininity. Marriage’s sanctity—­the ordination of marriage by God—­preserves the womb’s divinity.7 Alternatively, coding womb as sacred thwarts readings of woman as a passive, generic vessel for male occupation and domination. Rereading Mary as a spiritual mother whose womb supports a refusal of oppression recasts pregnancy as an agential phenomenon—­as a nonobjectifying element of womanhood and a meaningful component of women’s personal identity.8 The womb’s warrant of female agency resignifies the female body (normatively treated as threatening, sinful, and inferior) as stable, good, and powerful. Active wombs enable women to challenge extant power structures by establishing an authentic ground for opposition to female oppression (pregnancy and motherhood decrease the perceived threat to male power). Active wombs authorize women to speak authoritatively about experiences of injustice despite normative compliance.9 Motherhood thus permits, rather\n\n14 Athena to Barbie\n\nthan forbids, feminist activism. Mary’s model of woman as mother and activist motivates a reimagination of pregnant subjectivity: wombed persons as self-­directing subjects of their corporeal and spiritual activities. Feminist inquiries into female subjectivity must grapple with Mary’s performance of pregnancy. By shying away from theological imaginings of the womb, we overlook the powerful force Mary exerts on the lives of women, mothers and nonmothers alike. Mary exposes important ontological and psychological tensions that inform our understanding of woman­hood and shape the cultural status of women: woman as feminine object (a passive, generic, bodily vessel) versus woman as subversive agent (an active—­ and activist—­mother figure). Her dual prescriptive and transgressive performance of womanhood complicates female subjectivity. But it also provides good reason to reconceive pregnancy’s role in grounding women’s agency and forging personal identity. Feminists will betray not just Mary but all women if they refuse her model of woman and signification of womb out of hand. Forsaking Mary undermines the very subjectivity she authorizes by ruling out agential forms of motherhood and spiritual significations of feminine labor.10\n\nMary as Passive Vessel Mary, or Miriam, the Jewish mother of Jesus of Nazareth, is mentioned infrequently in the New Testament. We know almost nothing about her personal history.11 She is a necessary but ancillary figure in biblical Scripture and Christian\n\nDelivering Mary 15\n\ntheology.12 The Gospel of Matthew describes her as an unexpectant but willing young mother whose maternity threatens the political order of the day: she is the Theotokos (God-­bearer), the woman who dares to undermine royal power by birthing the ruler of a counter-­kingdom.13 The Gospel of Luke expands her roles beyond mother to include those of disciple and prophet.14 John’s Gospel and the book of Acts elevate her standing among Jesus’s followers, foreshadowing her motherhood of the church.15 Mary becomes the New Eve (or Second Eve), the woman who accepts God by implanting the fruit of the Holy Spirit in her womb. Eve, by contrast, rejects God; she eats the fruit.16 Despite the sparse biblical information about her historic reception, Mary is highly conspicuous within the Abrahamic traditions.17 She is recognized by Jews as a fellow sufferer, venerated by Roman Catholics for her intimacy with God, and honored by Protestants for her redemptive character.18 The Qur’an dedicates an entire sura to Mary (Maryam), the only chapter devoted to a woman. Late medieval descriptions of her reflect a myriad of Marian names, images, and associations: “mirror of justice,” “house of gold,” and “gate of heaven” among them.19 Modern books, buildings, art objects, and countless other artifacts pay homage to her life.20 Mary is a venerated and complex figure—­ saint, prophet, teacher, servant, humble Jewish woman. She is a global and eternal figure, all because of her womb.21 Mary codifies the idea of woman as vessel, a literal and figurative container for the creation and sustenance\n\n16 Athena to Barbie\n\nof others. Moreover, her container is pure: she is a virgin at least through conception.22 These intertwined Marian concepts—­woman as womb and woman as pure—­produce uncompromising performances of womanhood.23 Contemporary purity movements in conservative Roman Catholic and evangelical Protestant circles appropriate Mary’s purity as a lifestyle guide. Purity advocates not only read Mary along a binary—­woman is either pure and passive or worldly and agential—­they ascribe the restrictive attributes (purity and passivity) to her character, which constrain her subjectivity and prohibit a more diverse and complex embodiment. Purity advocates also conflate purity and passivity with chastity and proclaim chasteness a cardinal Christian virtue. Mary’s virginity is, therefore, read in literal terms. Hence one must be celibate to mirror Mary.24 “Purity rings” and “sexual sobriety chips” outwardly signify and honor girls (and boys, though they are peripheral to the movement) who commit themselves to sexual abstinence.25 Virginity, understood as biological, is aspirational, since God favored it in the example of Mary. Because Mary is a female exemplar, virginity is taken to be a uniquely feminine marker of virtue; that is, to be a “good girl” is to be chaste. Women who explore sexuality outside of the proper bounds of marriage are degraded: they are “slutty,” “easy,” “fast,” and “loose.” Beyond that, they are regarded as the source of male sin, like Eve before them, who is seen as the first and worst sinner.26 Right-­leaning prescriptions of womanhood help explain conservative attitudes toward female embodiment.27 Beyond the social judgment and\n\nDelivering Mary 17\n\nalienation one or one’s family may experience because of violative sexual behavior, conservatives regard sexual impropriety as a major stumbling block for salvation.28 So sexuality is carefully circumscribed: intercourse is permissible in the confines of heterosexual marriage for the primary purpose of procreation and emotional connection.29 For conservative Roman Catholics and Protestants, Scripture supports opposition to abortion by signifying the womb as divine: For it was you who formed my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; that I know very well. Psalm 139:13–­14\n\nThe psalmist’s underlying claim is that a woman’s womb is not her own. She cannot declare meaningful ownership over her reproductive processes nor integrate them into her self-­ identity because God is the activator and agent of her wombed activity. The child narrator of the Psalm—­who identifies God, the child’s spiritual father, as the source of his or her existence—­further reinforces woman’s alienation from her embodied experiences and effectively undermines her role in the creation of life. The mother is represented as a passive medium for God’s creative work; her womb is a sacred space situated inertly in her body and disassociated from her rational activities. She is thus a voiceless and powerless\n\n18 Athena to Barbie\n\ncharacter with no authoritative (or legitimate, per pro-­life politics) claim to her body or her womb—­or, perhaps, even the child formed within them.30 Her projected essence (womb) and identity (mother) evaporate as the psalmist’s erasure of woman becomes complete. In this scheme, male agency is conditioned on female submission. An additional challenge of Psalm 139 is the refusal of a phenomenology of pregnancy. Women who have birthed children know that the transition from “pregnant woman” to “mother” is fluid. Motherhood represents an embodied shift in self-­conception and self-­identity that unfolds over time, including, for some women, after the birth of their babies.31 The psalmist flattens the experience of mother­hood into a single moment, equating conception and motherhood temporally and logically. Whereas good Christian girls are chaste, good Christian women are devoted mothers. Mary serves again as a powerful role model for a Christian archetype of feminine identity. Mary’s performance of motherhood aligns with the Psalms: it begins with maternity.32 Her identity as a mother extends beyond the singular conception, birth, and death of her son, Jesus, to the conception and birthing of the church itself. She sustains a protracted maternity through her desire to “mother” everything her son wills.33 Mary, the mother of Jesus, operates as the figurative mother of the church.34 Mary’s pregnancy is typically read as a cooperative exercise with God, a foregrounding of free will in the history of salvation.35 She consents to, and celebrates in song,\n\nDelivering Mary 19\n\nGod’s merciful work.36 But troubling elements of obedience appear to ensure Mary’s maternity. A young Jewish virgin suspends her will to submit to God’s will—­“Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word”—­to enable the salvation of the human race as prophesied in the Jewish faith.37 The primary (active) work is the Spirit’s work (Luke 1:35–­37). Mary’s submission and obedience, her secondary (passive) work, operationalizes her individual performance of motherhood and serves to justify the disciplining of women’s wills and bodies collectively: women must obey, submit, and keep silent. Chaste while single, women must be fruitful once married. Conventional readings of Christian doctrine prescribe women’s obedience to men in the context of the church and home (“a wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband . . .”).38 Early Christian theologians even condition the Eve-­Mary parallel on obedience: Eve’s disobedience destroys the human race, whereas Mary’s obedience saves it.39 Eve’s rejection of the Holy Spirit (she eats the forbidden fruit) and Mary’s acceptance of the Holy Spirit (she allows the fruit to be implanted in her womb) produce comparable, embodied acts. Eve’s and Mary’s respective choices, despite their opposing significations, produce shared, embodied consequences: Eve and Mary will bear children and suffer in childbirth, a dual reinforcement of women’s bodily nature. Women’s power is rooted in maternity, a sign of female subordination. Obedience produces docile, maternal bodies that operate as ideal feminine subjects.40\n\n20 Athena to Barbie\n\nA conservative codification of womanhood denies women the experience and signification of their bodies as dominant. The normalization of female bodies as subordinate also subverts liberal explorations of female identity that see women as individuated subjects (individuals). The church’s appeal to female obedience also recalls high incidences of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse by family members and clergy.41 Because the Marian archetype of womanhood is tacitly conditioned on obedience (and its associative qualities of docility and submissiveness), the implications for women go beyond religious and marital relationships. Once obedience is accepted as an underlying justification for maternity—­a justification for the performance of woman as womb—­women who elect not to have children or are infertile are suspect in a Marian-­Christian scheme. They are not fruitful, in defiance of the Biblical mandate; they do not multiply in the literal sense of God’s law. Moreover, their lack of fruitfulness flouts the maxim for God’s blessing outlined in The Hail Mary, a prayer of the Rosary, that opens this chapter: motherhood is the ultimate fulfillment of womanhood. God blesses Mary because she is a female exemplar: her womb bears fruit, a child, who is also blessed. Women who defy Abrahamic constructions of femininity are both deviant and, it follows from the prayer, cursed. Deviance is subsequently used as a justification for marginalizing and shaming women without children: they have violated feminine norms ordained by God. God’s subsequent curse amounts to a final rejection of their nonmaternal performance of woman. These nasty women broke God’s law.42\n\nDelivering Mary 21\n\nChastity in singleness and fruitfulness in marriage engender prescriptive codes of womanhood and enforce the normative view that woman is but a womb. The Abrahamic ideal restricts a woman’s embodied agency and identity to motherhood: “Yet she will be saved through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and holiness, with modesty” (1 Timothy 2:15). Fortunately, other readings, including feminist readings, of women’s nature and identity can deliver Mary from an inherently subordinate and maternal position. Woman as womb is not the only reading the Abrahamic tradition invites.\n\nMary as Agential Womb The religious emphasis on Mary as mother has roots in a Christ-­centered or christotypical Mariology.43 Such a Mariology describes Mary’s value and privilege as arising from her association with her son, Jesus, and not from any independent affiliation with the divine or other prophetic practices. Her power, somewhat like the power of influential Protestant pastors’ wives, is rooted in male power. Although the Roman Catholic Church has affirmed other modes of reading Mary and other forms of Marian theology—­see Paul VI’s 1974 apostolic exhortation Marialis Cultus, for example, which characterizes Mary as “a woman who did not hesitate to proclaim that God vindicates the humble and the oppressed, and removes the powerful people of this world from their privileged positions”44 —­the papacy continues to speak the language of christotypical Mariology.45\n\n22 Athena to Barbie\n\nSaint John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis have invoked christotypical language to bolster the global devotional piety that regards Mary as the active dispenser of mercy.46 Mary’s virtuous embodiment, her infinite goodness and power, is believed to justify the Catholic devotional practice of intercessory prayers: Mary can, thanks to her purity and moral perfection, assist with every human need.47 The belief in her power to intercede is based on the mother’s close connection to her son.48 Indeed, her acquisition of goodness is predicated on her womb. The intimate binding of her flesh with that of Christ—­“Christ’s flesh is the flesh of her flesh (as Eve’s was of Adam)”—­generates a unity with God so that her own flesh is also God’s flesh.49 Her rational assent to the Holy Spirit is thus secondary to her physical assent.50 While the bodily dimensions of christotypical readings have some value for feminist philosophy—­they nicely challenge the body’s assigned negative value and reassess its role in perpetuating women’s inferior status—­ the diminishment of Mary’s rational assent reinforces the idea of pregnancy as a physical phenomenon alone. Her reproductive body becomes a docile, inert thing.51 Stripped of subjectivity, agency, and rationality, Mary loses the capacity to fully engage the phenomenological richness and liberating potential of pregnancy. Christotypical readings thus reinscribe the paradoxical logic of woman’s power as mother, a power rooted in submission. Repressing Mary’s subjectivity reinforces male power and dominance. If, on the other hand, Mary subverts male power by sharing volition with God—­if she chooses to enter into\n\nDelivering Mary 23\n\nrelationship with the divine—­the tradition of piety surrounding devotion to merciful (and maternal) Mary takes a radical turn. By choosing maternity, Mary’s assent becomes a personal act that authorizes a unique and agential mothering of child and church.52 By freeing pregnancy from a power relation that subordinates the feminine to the masculine, Mary liberates pregnancy from its circumscribed passivity. Like Jesus who reverses the Edenic curse and frees humans from social oppression, Mary reverses the material and maternal dimensions of this curse and frees women from embodied objectivity. Pregnancy becomes a chosen activity in both literal and figurative senses. Moreover, figurative pregnancies—­women’s birthing of ideas, systems, and institutions—­ameliorate the masculine mark­ ing of intellectual and spiritual activities that enforce female subordination.53 The womb thus operates both as a sacred space itself and as a creator of sacred spaces, making female subjectivity both reproductive and productive. Wombs can deliver women. A powerful idea of Mary as spiritual mother dominates religious iconography from the third to fifteenth centuries CE. Maria lactans (the nursing Madonna) imagery presents the Virgin breastfeeding the infant Jesus. The nurturing mother, “the wet-­nurse of salvation,” is a female symbol of God’s love.54 Holiness surrounds and radiates from Mary in this example titled The Nursing Madonna. Her common clothing represents the accessibility of salvation to every hungry sinner, a subversion of the state’s arbitrary and hierarchical judgment.55 The cradling of Mary’s body in a walnut seed,\n\n24 Athena to Barbie\n\na traditional fertility symbol, reflects her spiritual fruitfulness.56 She inspires wisdom and spiritual practices in others. In Christian culture, the walnut seed has also come to symbolize the Trinity. Mary’s placement illustrates her proximity to God, a further indication of her spiritual authority and autonomy.57\n\nAnonymous Master of Bruges, Nursing Madonna (Madonna Lactans), 16th century, Museu de Aveiro, Portugal.\n\nDelivering Mary 25\n\nBecause it was reasonable for viewers to believe that Mary would have nursed her infant child, it was natural to embrace the Virgin as the nourishing mother of the church. The construction of femininity that warrants Mary’s identity as a spiritual mother is properly embodied and powerfully agential. She bares her breast as a gesture of female supplication to Christ when asking for mercy for sinners.58 Her milk parallels the role of the blood of Christ in Christian worship: a source of unity in salvation.59 “By the Middle Ages, ‘lactation miracles’ and ‘milk shrines’ sprang up across the Christian world” in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic communities.60 The breast’s lactating function is regarded as natural and good rather than abject; it serves as a source of female power. The commanding image of Mary as spiritual mother changes in the sixteenth century when clerical writers, following the Council of Trent, oppose nudity in religious subjects. Maria lactans iconography also fades from view after the advent of movable type and the printing press. Early forms of pornography sexualize women’s bodies in the popular imagination while the printing press facilitates the circulation of anatomical drawings for medical study. These examples of mass communication demystify the body and challenge biblical views of the body as a reflection of God.61 The mass production of the Bible also contributes to the disappearance of Maria lactans.62 The printing of Scripture in the vernacular coupled with Protestantism’s focus on text over imagery undermine the efficacy of Mary’s breast as a sign of holy providence.63 Once the breast is codified as\n\n26 Athena to Barbie\n\nan object of medical study and inscribed with sexual desire, it disappears as a subject of sacred desire entirely.64 Mary’s lactating breasts, once a symbol of her salvific power and closeness with God, are supplanted by her son’s crucified body—­the suffering Jesus on the cross—­as “the dominant motif of Christianity.”65 The suppression of the feminine is especially troubling in cultural contexts that are hostile to women and serve to objectify, sexualize, and degrade them. Imagining the Virgin mother as inertly maternal refuses Mary the properly sororal (sisterly) and prophetic (knowing) identity her active womb warrants.66 Pregnancy, childbirth, and other (bodily) female activities connect and educate women. The womb operates as a distinctive source of knowledge and care: women connect, empathize, and teach one another through the joy, pain, and sorrow of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood. Stripping away Mary’s (women’s) epistemic and emotional activities flattens her cognitive, subjective engagement with the world: Mary becomes an inert object. Delivering Mary from this performance of pregnancy requires a reimagination of the womb as a generative space for female agency in ways both literal and metaphorical.67\n\nMary as Woman Marian constructions make it difficult to imagine Mary in her everyday life in Nazareth, a poor province of the Roman Empire. She presumably performs the customary duties of women in ancient farming communities. She carts well\n\nDelivering Mary 27\n\nwater, shops at the marketplace, and prepares meals for her family. She weaves cloth and makes clothing appropriate for different seasons. She cares for her husband, Joseph, a busy carpenter, as well as elderly family members and friends. She attends religious services and feasts. She socializes with Galilean women, enjoying news from around the Mediterranean world. She maintains herself, staying fit and clean, regularly washing and oiling her long, braided hair. She assists with crop and animal production. She disciplines her children, including her precocious first child, Jesus.68 Normative constraints on the feminine prohibit Mary from disciplining her children. The passive subjectivity she is ascribed—­woman as womb and womb as sacred space—­renders female acts of discipline subversive. In the painting Young Virgin Spanking the Infant Jesus in Front of Three Witnesses, the twentieth-­century German artist Max Ernst portrays Mary striking Jesus on his naked body while onlookers (friends) observe her with skepticism and disdain. Ernst’s anthropological approach defies modern constructions of female identity by reinscribing the feminine with maternal and spiritual authority (Mary wears a halo). The elongated Christ child crosses his ankles and extends his arms as if in a crucifixion scene, anticipating his death on the cross, a final punishment. His bottom bears the mark of Mary’s anger. She is swift and defiant. Ernst references and overturns the work of Parmigianino, the sixteenth-­century Italian mannerist who indulges iconographic renderings of a sensuous, beatified, adored and adoring mother. Mary bears the traditional blue that appears on the legs of\n\n28 Athena to Barbie\n\nParmigianino’s Madonna with the Long Neck, but she also dons a customary red dress to indicate how ordinary she (and her act of discipline) is.69 Ernst thus normalizes Marian authority.\n\nMax Ernst, The Virgin Chastising the Christ Child before Three Witnesses: André Breton, Paul Éluard and the Painter, 1926, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany, Photo by: Rheinisches Bildarchiv Köln.\n\nDelivering Mary 29\n\nChristotypical Mariology emphasizes Mary’s passiveness, her submission to authority, her acceptance of female subordination, and her expressions of femininity that suppress female authority. Ernst shows that Mary’s performance of womanhood does not have to erase her person­hood. Mary’s cooperation with God and subsequent mothering of the church sanction the disciplinary activities that Ernst depicts. Some Jewish and early Greco-­Roman sources suggest that Mary’s life may have been less restrictive than scholars have assumed.70 If we resist reading Mary as an agential woman, we also refuse women a powerful model of female subjectivity and authority.71\n\nFeminist Engagement with the Sacred Womb Mary continues to exert a powerful influence on the readings and reimaginations of pregnant bodies today. The pop icon Beyoncé (Queen B) issues a provocative reimagining of Mary in this photograph of herself as the apparition of the blessed Virgin of Guadalupe.72 Our Lady of Guadalupe appeared as an apparition before Saint Juan Diego, a Christian convert, in 1531. Today she serves a dual religious and political function: she is a source of Roman Catholic devotion and a national symbol of Mexico. Like Our Lady, Queen B is a female cultural icon. Her artistic genius inspires her fans’ veneration of her as an exemplar of feminine strength. Beyoncé appropriates the symbolic accoutrement of the Virgin Mary to reinscribe the culturally laden figure of the Virgin Mother. Her halo of flowers grants\n\n30 Athena to Barbie\n\nJuan de Sáenz, Virgen de Guadalupe con las cuatro apariciones by Juan de Sáenz, c. 1777, Museo Soumaya, Mexico City, Mexico.\n\nBeyoncé; Instagram\n\ndivinity to nature rather than God, a semiotic privileging of the feminine over the masculine order and a reclamation of woman’s divine power. Her hands hug her swollen, pregnant abdomen to signal the womb as a profound source of female power over and against the power of the heavenly Father whom the blessed Virgin petitions in her clasped-­ handed prayer. To reinforce her feminine power, Beyoncé assumes the yogic pose of Virasana or the hero’s pose, symbolizing her reputation as a forceful female figure. Beyoncé is the new Eve, the new Mary, the Black queen mother.73 She is a heroic and delivered woman. Today, the idea of womb as sacred is tied to politically right-­of-­center policies regarding reproductive choice, such as the newly resurrected “heartbeat bills” in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Texas, and elsewhere. The bills propose to deny pregnant women access to lawful abortions after the medical detection of a fetal heartbeat (the Texas bill was recently signed into law). Their implicit logic is that since the womb is a sacred space (carrying life), it does not belong to any one person, even if that person is the mother.74 The cultural inclination to call infants and unborn children “angels” or “miracles” also reinforces the implicit belief that the womb is divine; that is, if babies are angels, they belong ultimately to God rather than their parents or themselves. If babies are miracles, God ordained their creation. Pregnant women’s use of #blessed on social media reflects a popular spiritual orientation toward pregnancy: pregnancy is a singularly spiritual activity decreed by God.75 Even the modern fascination with the ultrasound\n\n32 Athena to Barbie\n\ncan be interpreted as a sacred ritual (father and mother are worshippers, the infant is the holy one, and the doctor is the priest). Blurry sonogram images evoke and are often treated as religious icons.76 Women who live in Mary’s shadow feel pressure to serve as vessels for others’ lives, literally and figuratively. The presumed sacredness of pregnancy attached to Mary—­ mother of God, queen of heaven, saint of motherhood, exemplar of fertility—­produces restrictive as well as liberating paths for understanding and experiencing embodied subjectivity: pregnancy as a dual embodiment of female subordination and empowerment. Reproductive restrictions aside, the idea that pregnancy transcends familial and social realms and enjoys spiritual significance may facilitate women’s experiences of their pregnant bodies as empowering rather than threatening.77 Mary as spiritual mother exhibits the power to deliver the oppressed from oppression.78 This reimagined, expansive performance of feminine subjectivity gives Mary highly agential identities: sister, prophet, activist. Feminists need a Mary who apprehends herself as a woman and an individual whose womb constitutes some, though not all, of her sense of self. Overly spiritual renderings of Mary may also prevent women from experiencing their wombs (and bodies) as their own. Modern Mariology has circumscribed women’s spiritual, social, and economic authority by portraying female power as submission. Recapitulations of male power and spiritual authority produce passive bodies that code femininity as an inert, passive, female performance. Purity,\n\nDelivering Mary 33\n\nregarded as an essential feminine feature, is materialized on the body as virginity. Venerating Mary and celebrating women whose flourishing is inextricably tied to male flourishing can undermine women’s power and agency, especially in the sociopolitical context of women’s inequality and female misogyny. It remains unclear whether the visibility of female pregnancy elevates or diminishes women’s status. Mary’s story of divine conception dramatizes the still uncanny nature of pregnancy. She sets the stage for Athena’s archetypal performance of pregnancy as a political activity: a reinscription of the female role with decidedly male duties. Athena—­woman, goddess, warrior, and craftsman—­signifies womb as political space.\n\n34 Athena to Barbie\n\n2 Conquering Athena Womb as Political Space\n\nBrave, unconcerned, mocking, violent—­thus wisdom wants us: she is a woman and always loves only a warrior. —­Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nAthena, the “woman-­goddess” of Greek mythology, pres-\n\nents an audacious portrait of pregnancy.1 She is, like Mary, a virgin. Her virginity is intimately tied to her unique embodiment: she is neither birthed by a woman nor gives birth herself.2 The warrior-­goddess emerges out of the head of Zeus fully formed and armed for battle. She personifies\n\n35\n\nwisdom and war. She is, like elite men of antiquity, civilized, urban, and politically engaged. She preserves her feminine identity through the patronage of crafts like needle­ work and weaving.3 Her affiliation with warfare casts her as masculine and allows her entry into a public, male space. She thus assigns to the female role decidedly male duties. She also redefines motherhood, extending the protection of one’s children to the protection of all Athenians, a militaristic responsibility. Conquering Athena defeats (conquers) and succumbs to (is conquered by) male power, representing the negative and positive valences of female subjectivity. Athena—­woman, goddess, warrior, and craftsman—­signifies womb as political space. Athena’s appearance in the polis is aptly read as either a female intrusion into the male sphere or a remarkable expansion of the feminine reproductive role.4 She expresses intelligence, an attribute reserved for men in the ancient world. She embodies political authority and establishes a civic order, a radically male move. She challenges traditional female ties to the home, resisting woman’s early identification with domestic labor.5 Her exploitation of gender ambiguity effectively makes space for female participation in the public arena and rebrands reproductivity as a rational act.6 Yet the political and epistemic advancements Athena models come with a dramatic twist: she is celibate. Athena “mates neither with gods nor with mortals.”7 She represses her sexual desire for the sake of civic ideals.8 She reasons and strategizes, eschewing the bodily dimensions of female life. She enacts a political performance of pregnancy—­and\n\n36 Athena to Barbie\n\nmodels mother as civic leader—­by birthing and securing the vitality of the city.9 She thus instantiates the exclusion of the feminine from a masculine world: women birth bodies, a feminine task, or women birth ideas, a masculine task.10 The symbolic orders of femininity and masculinity refuse one another. Athena’s archetype of pregnancy, a progressive model of political productivity that anticipates modern feminist goals, is conditioned on the suppression of the feminine body. She erupts from a male mind, encoded to perform pregnancy as a political practice: Athena births civic ideas, institutions, and public goods.11 Her subjugation of the womb is therefore a function of her masculine performance of womanhood. Her signification of female labor and birth as unwombed activities makes explicit the price of a woman’s entry into a man’s world: assent to masculine norms and values. Athena (as well as Mary, Venus, and Barbie) dutifully conforms to the male social order by appropriating and displaying masculine ideals.12 Woolf’s figurative use of birth, a metaphor for female emancipation, applies nicely to Athena’s situation, a situation that plays out in the lives of women who covet political influence and professional advancement yet feel pressure (or a desire) to become wives and mothers.13 Being female in a male world—­negotiating the logic and ideology of the feminine order with its antecedent roles and identities—­is a complex task. The wise, conquering, woman-­goddess Athena puts on the body that enables her civic leadership, a body that reads male.14\n\nConquering Athena 37\n\nAthena as Immaterial Womb Apollodorus (Pseudo-­ Apollodorus) recounts the story of Athena’s birth in The Library or Bibliotheca, a second-­ century BCE text depicted here in a black-­figure bowl by the potter Phrynos in 540 BCE: “And when the time came for the birth to take place, Prometheus, or as others say, He­ phaestus, struck the head of Zeus with an ax.”15 The ax, or the mythic headache that precedes its blow, produces Zeus’s requisite labor pains in the absence of a female uterus. The myth also reports that Zeus has swallowed the primordial Metis, his first wife and the Titan goddess of wisdom, having been warned she would threaten his power. Metis was pregnant with Athena, so Zeus’s murderous actions deprive Athena of a mother. Metis does not abandon her daughter to male violence, however. Instead, she sets to work inside\n\nThe Phrynos Painter, Birth of Athena, black-figured lip-cup, c. 555 BCE, British Museum, England.\n\n38 Athena to Barbie\n\nZeus’s head and crafts Athena a set of protective armor. The clamor of her work produces Zeus’s debilitating headache. His pain becomes so unbearable, he welcomes the ax’s rupturing force. Athena is born fortified for the male world.16 Athena’s birth constitutes the birth of a world without women. She represents a society conceived in the male imaginary rather than the female womb. Masculine conceptions of the social order appeal to transcendence as an organizing principle. Athena, for example, materializes as an adult who transcends the developmental processes of human existence; as a political construct, she privileges principles rather than practices of cooperation and relies on ideology for social cohesion. By contrast, feminine conceptions of the social order dwell in immanence—­in human interchanges organized around birth, life, and death—­and appeal to human needs, like food and sex, and social practices to bridge political divides. When Zeus appropriates the birthing process for himself, he displaces women from the Greek civic and cultural imagination, a symbolic and violent repression of the feminine order.17 The attempted erasure of women from civic life sets the stage for pernicious female oppression in every subsequent century. Female inequality extends beyond political disenfranchisement and unequal pay. Misogyny, hostile work environments, and a devaluing of feminine work contribute to women’s inferior status. Women are seen as morally and intellectually suspect and lacking agency because of their inferior, bodily (wombed) nature. They are deprived of parity with men in recognized degrees of dignity, integrity, and authority.\n\nConquering Athena 39\n\nAthena dramatizes the womb’s role in women’s situation by suspending wombed activities and performing masculine duties, duties that secure her personal power and political engagement. The cultural suppression of the womb—­the literal and symbolic diminishment of the female body and its reproductive activities—­does not destroy female power entirely. Metis illustrates this truth through her invisible labor inside Zeus’s mind: she transforms Athena into a warrior mother who gives birth to politics. But the womb’s suppression nonetheless serves to subjugate women to a “natural” state of immanence—­housekeeping, cooking, childbearing, and other forms of bodily labor normalized as feminine. The feminine tie to bodily immanence jeopardizes women’s political engagement on practical and theoretical levels. The use of the female body for caregiving depletes time and energy for politics and any nondomestic activities. Thwarting femininity to enter the political sphere, if universalized, undermines the production of the masculine social order: women must produce (birth) the men who run the polis. Women who defy normative gender expectations—­ by refusing caregiving duties or by occupying political roles—­code as male in the social world. “Masculine” women gain some personal agency by assuming male functions, but they ultimately subvert women’s equality by decoupling the wombed body from female identity. Because female agency is conditioned on wombed activities, as the Mary example shows, detaching female identity from a full range of (re)productive activities, real and metaphoric, dissuades women from\n\n40 Athena to Barbie\n\nintegrating bodily activities into their self-­identity. Erasing the female body in constructions of human subjectivity also reinforces male bodies as naturally (normatively) agential: men are conceived as self-­directing, while women are conceived as other directing. The masculine coding of women like Athena is reinforced through normative practices that affirm feminine behaviors. Because feminine norms proscribe unfeminine be­ haviors, masculine women threaten embodied subjectivity on both personal and public fronts—­through self-­disorder (by detaching femininity from woman’s self-­identity) and civil disorder (by disrupting male control over public goods). Unfeminine female behaviors imply psychosocial malformation and, therefore, abnormality. Woman’s body and mind are therefore incapable of meeting the conditions for personhood. Unfeminine female behaviors also challenge the two-­sphere system of human activity. Femininity allocates women to a private, female sphere. Private-­sphere activities, like cooking, cleaning, and caregiving, stabilize the feminine order. Women who follow Athena and leave the private sphere for the public sphere threaten the masculine order by disclaiming male power, suggesting male impotence.18 Athena represents the dual political valences of masculine womanhood. She is a conquering female—­a female who overcomes male power by resignifying her womb as political space—­and a female who succumbs to male power by denying her womb and assuming a masculine performance of woman. Athena’s archetype of womanhood has purchase with women because she embodies the multivalent\n\nConquering Athena 41\n\nexperience of female subjectivity—­the trade-­offs of having public responsibilities and roles outside of the home and family. Authentic experiences and expressions of human subjectivity require female access to private and public spheres of activities regardless of how these activities are gendered. But resistance is everywhere. Athena’s instantiation of the feared, masculine woman undermines the sexual binary that supports a division of labor and sustains male privilege. Women’s performance of domestic duties frees men to focus time and attention on nondomestic activities. Domestic activities garner less economic and social value than nondomestic tasks, mirroring women’s and men’s unequal value. Gender norms such as male autonomy also safeguard masculine principles of civil organization, leadership, and control. By rejecting (or transcending) gender norms like Athena, we can expose masculine principles for critique and subvert the sexual division that reinforces woman’s passive, abject, biological signification and duties. Beyond the practical and theoretical problems with male hegemony, suppressing femininity enables masculine norms to operate as universal ideals. Feminine ways of being and knowing—­practices rooted in reproductive labor and care for others—­lose their existential and epistemic value in the face of male privilege. Women’s embodied engagement in the world also exerts no real political force because the idealization of masculinity forecloses the construction of social visions that enable immanence and transcendence to coexist and share equal weight. The critical question is not\n\n42 Athena to Barbie\n\nwhether female agency allows for women’s political engagement but whether women’s political engagement can be reconciled with distinctively feminine (bodily) performances of womanhood.\n\nAthena as Unfeminine Womb Athena’s appropriation of masculine norms like physical strength and wisdom enables her to perform motherhood as civic leadership. Her political signification of womb challenges the definitive, biological construction of woman as a reproductive creature in important ways.19 Her wholesale transformation of female identity requires, of course, divine effort. Woman’s bodily immanence is critical to the development of human civilization.20 Prehistoric fertility cults and ancient epigraphic, literary, and archaeological records reveal the widespread worship of female pregnancy and reproduction.21 Over time, the normalized use of women’s bodies for birthing children and caring for families, along with the rise of modern labor, marked the womb as a defining element of woman’s situation in the world and her “natural, normal” destiny. Today the twin ideologies of femininity and motherhood serve to align and identify women with domestic labor almost exclusively. The cultural investment in woman as womb makes Athena’s example of a disembodied, rational, and political woman leader even more extraordinary. Athena’s bold appropriation of the womb for the purpose of birthing ideas functions as\n\nConquering Athena 43\n\nan embodied act of male civic engagement and a political performance of pregnancy. She repositions and resignifies the material body as inessential to womanhood, a move that subverts the ideology of woman as child bearer and recasts females as rational rather than bodily creatures. Her symbolic emancipation of women from bodily labor and pain invites broader resistance to female exclusion from the world. She secures for women the most powerful political weapon of the male world: the mind.22 Priestesses and female cult figures from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods draw on Athena’s masculinity to construct novel forms of agency and identity within a complex system of male power.23 Textual sources, inscribed dedications, and cultural objects show that ancient Greek women engaged in important religious roles and rituals, acts of transcendence beyond narrow, bodily, and sexual constructions of womanhood that point to Athena’s influence.24 Aristophanes’s fifth-century BCE comedy Lysistrata depicts the seizure of the Athenian Acropolis by the city’s women, a meaningful allusion to the goddess herself. Though these women are deprived of citizenship, they use their sexual (bodily) power over men to force an end to the Peloponnesian War: no peace, no sex.25 Athena’s archetypal woman, a woman who refuses the biological womb in favor of political authority, symbolizes one of several ways that women have sought to resolve the vexed nature of womanhood as they search for self. Our modern appropriation of Athena should not, however, overshadow her important function in her own time. Ancient\n\n44 Athena to Barbie\n\nexercises of female agency exemplify the importance of Athena’s mythic scheme in the Greek civic imagination. For instance, the laws and political processes of ancient Greece deny women political standing.26 But the mythic ideals embodied by Athena make space for women in ancient civic practices. Women of antiquity not only exercise informal power over monetary decisions and household property, but they also hold de facto political offices in cultic activities.27 Athena legitimates women as real political players in the civic experience and, therefore, serves as a helpful and hopeful archetype of woman.28 Athena’s archetype of pregnancy as a political activity raises perennial questions about women’s relationship to the state. Women have enjoyed less political power and freedom than men despite progressive social movements and philosophies.29 The democratic revolutions of eighteenth-­ century Europe and America, buttressed by Enlightenment arguments for equality, were ripe for the materialization of a real-­life Athena: rational, nonsexual, and political. Yet unlike the women of ancient Athens, European and American women have no Athena in their cultural and civic imaginations to which they can appeal for inspiration. They lack a symbol system for female rationality: the male alone is coded as rational (and so the femininity of intellectual female politicians like Margaret Thatcher, Hillary Clinton, and Elizabeth Warren—­as well as Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi—­is questioned).30 Like the christotypical readings of Christianity that push Mary to the periphery, eighteenth-­ century conceptions of rationality are both male-­centric\n\nConquering Athena 45\n\nand masculine.31 It is not accidental that Descartes’s cogito is embedded in a male body. Enlightenment significations of reason as male persist in contemporary articulations of rationality. Hannah Arendt valorizes action (male, public sphere) over labor (female, private sphere) in ways that diminish women’s embodied labor reminiscent of Beauvoir—­even though Arendt, ironically, declines to acknowledge any affinity between Beauvoir’s work and her concerns with sources of authoritarianism and oppression.32 The term vita activa, which emerges early as a core idea in the Western tradition of political thought, means “a life devoted to public-­political matters.”33 Vita activa designates three fundamental human activities: labor, work, and action. Labor is an activity that corresponds to the biological processes of the human body; life is the human condition of labor. Work is an activity that corresponds to the unnaturalness of human existence—­work provides an artificial world of things different from natural objects. And action is an activity (the only activity) that goes on directly between men (not Man) without the intermediary of things or matter; men live on the earth and inhabit the world.34 Deprivation is the tragic outcome of laboring as a woman, according to Arendt: “To live an entirely private life means above all to be deprived of things essential to a truly human life: to be deprived of the reality that comes from being seen and heard by others, to be deprived of an ‘objective’ relationship with them that comes from being related to and separated from them through the intermediary of a common world of things, to be deprived of the possibility\n\n46 Athena to Barbie\n\nof achieving something more permanent than life itself.”35 The public-­private distinction with its added masculine and feminine connotations makes impossible the idea of a laboring, working, and active woman on Arendt’s account. Women must, in other words, become like men to enter the public sphere, a claim Athena paradoxically subverts. We recognize now that because gender is mapped onto a binary, male-­female sexed system, appeals to female rationality constitute a destabilizing breach of the male-­female binary. Granting woman rationality, a masculine faculty, threatens female identity by subverting feminine constructions of womanhood and challenges male identity by contesting the sexual division of labor. Conquering Athena appropriates mind as womb and births the polis. Although her subversive performance of motherhood authorizes women’s engagement with the public sphere, it also signifies a repression of the feminine order.36 Athena’s introduction of woman as thinker and leader into the female imaginary comes with a price. Conquering female (bodily) subjectivity, refusing one’s embodied womb, constitutes a masculine act that codes Athena as male. Becoming a woman involves negotiating the gendered boundaries of body and mind.\n\nAthena as Warrior Athena’s embedded presence in the civic and cultural imagination of ancient Greece generates a practical, if not ideological, reconception of life with a womb. She births and protects male citizens while also empowering women to\n\nConquering Athena 47\n\nassume a similar responsibility for civic and social order. She thwarts gender norms by performing both feminine and masculine duties. She subverts the meaning of pregnancy to signify a political rather than a biological process. She is, true to the Nietzschean allusion that opens this archetypal analysis, brave and unconcerned. Athena is dressed for battle on the Burgon vase shown here, the earliest preserved Panathenaic prize amphora from 565– ­60 BCE.37 She brandishes her spear and shield while\n\nBurgon Group, Athena wearing her aegis, black-figured trophy amphora, c. 565 BCE, British Museum, England.\n\n48 Athena to Barbie\n\ndonning her aegis, a cloak made of goat skin and designed with the head of a Gorgon and its accompanying snakes. Herodotus attributes the aegis to ancient Libya, a magical site to the ancient Greeks, invoking the exotic nuance of the feminine order (the aegis is a woman’s cloak). A siren appears above Athena’s head, a bird-­ woman associated with danger and seduction, an alluring symbol of Athena’s attractive potency as a female and a sign of glory, and possible peril, in battle. Athena is a dually gendered symbol of the city of Athens, a site of male strength and feminine fragility. Athena’s masculine performance of pregnancy and motherhood—­the growth and birth of political valor—­ generates a suitable legacy for women who occupy positions of power in male spaces: figurative warriors who can operate like men. But women are not divine figures.38 Nor do women spring ex nihilo from the male imaginary, though they are subject to masculine norms and ideals that archetypes like Athena and Venus personify. Women become what and who they are within a structured material reality—­or a reality that suggests cognitive, linguistic, economic, and political structures. Women are (somewhat unconsciously) conditioned by these structures as they bear upon female existence: conditions of womanhood (womb) that give rise to female identities (lover and mother). They cannot flee from these conditions entirely. They cannot transcend their vexing biological functions through an exercise of reason alone. Nor can they navigate a masculine signification\n\nConquering Athena 49\n\nwithout social consequence. Violent Athena rises in rank, whereas violent women are swiftly marginalized, since violence is antithetical to femininity. The woman-­goddess Athena, pregnant with ideas, fails to reconcile masculine political ideals and feminine (bodily) performances of womanhood. Being a woman is inherently troubling. Women who follow in Athena’s conquering footsteps do so at the expense of an assumed femininity. They are branded “aggressive” if they speak assertively and “bitchy” or “bossy” if they speak with authority, traits and behavior prized and rewarded in men. Women are labeled “emotional” if they express anger—­or “on the rag,” one of several crude and demeaning euphemisms for menstruation that reinforces women’s bodily nature. Because the female exercise of male subjectivity threatens established gender norms, behavioral surveillance seeks to neutralize the threat of “butch” women by safeguarding femininity (and “femme” men by circumscribing masculinity). Both explicit company rules and implicit workplace norms prescribe dress and comportment.39 Outside of work, women are expected to perform femininity through various gender-­coded social activities: shopping, cleaning, cooking, baking, decorating, and so forth, contemporary equivalents of Athena’s needlework and weaving. Women also devote disproportionately more time and money to the disciplining of the body to conform to feminine ideals: hair coloring, waxing, tanning, exercising, and on and on.40 Women who do not have children—­both women who cannot conceive and/or carry a pregnancy to term and\n\n50 Athena to Barbie\n\nwomen whose relationships or values make reproduction impossible or undesirable—­a lso find themselves locked out of Athena’s reinscription of female power. They are regarded as suspect and threatening to systems of male power because women’s real power originates in their wombs. Biological reproduction, a uniquely female, bodily function, authorizes women’s economic activities and political rights, including the right to “mother” male politicians, coworkers, and colleagues by condemning or correcting their misbehavior.41 Interestingly, women who are not yet mothers but who seek out motherhood share in Athena’s warrior identity. A woman who undergoes in vitro fertilization, for instance, is thought of as someone who “fought for the pregnancy.” Also, a mother whose child is bullied in school is praised for going to the administration and “fighting for her child.” Fighting is a permissible facet of female identity if it is undertaken on behalf of maternal or child-­rearing activities—­that is, if it coheres with femininity.42 Finally, nonchildbearing women are perceived as less authoritative than childbearing women vis-­à-­vis femininity.43 Postmenopausal women with children are less threatening than childless women. But they are nonetheless considered sexually degenerative, trapped in a state of perpetual feminine decline: “not really a man but no longer a functional woman.”44 Despite Athena’s powerful performance of pregnancy as an intellectual and political exercise, she fails to normalize the professional woman or validate the childless and postmenopausal woman. Athena’s promising\n\nConquering Athena 51\n\nappropriation of feminine norms—­ her birthing and mothering of the state—­a lso fails to remediate the difficulties career women with children encounter, including the belief that women’s professional (public) work compromises their domestic (private) responsibilities. Women professionals are often viewed as flouting gender norms because they assume historically male roles and masculine duties. Their gender identity and sexuality are evaluated with suspicion because they perform “male” duties, a suspicion that reflects the cultural exclusion of the feminine from the masculine (public and political) order.45 Women sometimes internalize a masculine-­ gendered coding, which produces feelings of guilt and shame for not being available full-­time to their families, especially when they are already judged for working outside of the home.46 Even corporations and institutions that reject heteronormative and discriminatory views struggle to incorporate activities like nursing and breast-­pumping into their work cultures. Family leave policies, childcare facilities, equality-­minded spouses, and domestic help ease career women’s work-­ life burdens, but these systems and support structures do not erase the threat that the masculine woman poses to men and to women themselves as they navigate shifting, gendered identity markers.47 Not only does Athena function outside of the procreative cycle of human life (she is a goddess), but her operations as a goddess-­woman (the corporate mother) are entirely disassociated from her body: she rules not through physical strength but through mental acumen.\n\n52 Athena to Barbie\n\nHer mind is pregnant with ideas. And the birth of her ideas, however necessary and good, undermines the unity and stability of the masculine (male-only) sphere. Athena’s mythic creation reveals the primordial threat of the feminine order. Zeus claims the creation of woman for himself because the genos gynaikōn (race of women) in its cohesion “threatens the unity of a masculine society.”48 Major literary figures and city-­states from Semonides to Euripides and from Amorgos to Athens follow suit and exclude women from Greek citizenship despite Athena’s birth of the polis.49 Excluding the female “half ” from the Greek politic is a paradoxical exclusion insofar as it is “necessary and impossible at the same time.”50 In the words of Euripides’s Hippolytus, “Zeus is responsible for the emergence of women; women are the deceitful curse, counterfeit money (kibdēlon kakon). They are a curse for men—­that is, for all humanity, because their victims are anthrōpoi as a whole and not, as one might have expected, simply andres. They are a curse sent to earth as an act of colonization (katoikizein).”51 The conception of women in the male imaginary as a lower race or species—­g ynaikōn (womankind) as opposed to anthropon (humankind)—­makes women hostile to the male world (they deceive, victimize, and threaten to colonize the male landscape).52 Women’s subhuman status, cursed nature, and corrupting force make female enfranchisement incompatible with (male) sociopolitical ideals. The male world neither values nor respects the feminine order and masculine order equally because of the mythic\n\nConquering Athena 53\n\nsuperiority of man. But the male world nonetheless needs female wombs to survive. Misogyny is the price women pay for Athena’s birth from the head of her father rather than the uterus of her mother. Athena literally gives her father a migraine, symbolizing the view that woman is the source of man’s pain and suffering. The Athenian exploitation of masculine and feminine ideals sets the stage for later and more radical understandings of appropriate male and female activities. The philosophical division of self into mind and body associated with Cartesian philosophy in the seventeenth century—­wherein mind is essential, and body is inessential, to selfhood—­ is a salient example. The subsequent gendering of Descartes’s binary construction, the (productive) mind is male and the (reproductive) body is female, corresponds to the social valuing of men and women: men have greater value because they are ascribed higher “human” capacities.53 Another example of bifurcated male and female duties is the nineteenth-­century economic division of labor into disparate male and female spheres: men work (public, political sphere) and women mother (private, domestic sphere), a division that recapitulates the exclusion of the feminine in Euro-­A merican culture.54 Twentieth-­ century progressives embrace and exploit differentiated masculine and feminine activities for political purposes. Simone de Beauvoir and Betty Friedan focus on women’s rational capacities and intellectual interests to resist bodily female norms like housekeeping and childbearing. They share the view that a woman’s pursuit\n\n54 Athena to Barbie\n\nof her own intellectual interests is a necessary condition for her freedom.55 Her body alone, the birthing and rearing of humans, could never serve to liberate or complete her. The cultural repression of femininity calls us to retheorize human subjectivity and redesign the world to value body and mind equally.\n\nAthena as Woman Athena’s sex alone does not mark her masculine comportment toward the world as deviant: classical Greek women were able to assume male duties.56 But even in cultures with pronounced examples of gender fluidity, human sexuality is mapped onto social and biological systems that stabilize what it means to be male and female. Men and women are treated as natural and opposing categories. Male-­female opposition generates an ideology of gender that normalizes masculine and feminine expressions and activities. Men are rational, active, and assertive, masculine traits that define male behavior and biological functions. Women are emotional (irrational), passive, and submissive, feminine traits that define female behavior and biological functions. The presumptive rationality of men, understood as a positive, intellectual activity of the mind, is considered antithetical to the bodily activity of female reproduction, a presumably abject, passive process. Athena’s masculine identity may enhance her competitiveness among male gods and instantiate a prescient model of gender subversion, but her failure to perform femininity, her lack of physical reproductivity,\n\nConquering Athena 55\n\nironically undermines the female subjectivity she so powerfully exemplifies.57 Athena may be wise to suspend her womb for the sake of civic engagement. Her action exposes the Western tradition’s two-­sphere system of human activity (public and private) for differently sexed bodies. Public activities, civic and financial leadership among them, enjoy especially high value in a two-­sphere context. Public activities are also highly gendered since they rely on citizens, an exclusively male group, for financial support and fulfillment (private, female activities do not implicate the polis since they are funded through private family resources). Women’s access to the public sphere is therefore contingent on female ties to male privilege. Their ability to buy their way into religious and political activities exemplifies the economic and social advancement of women through marriage and family, a practice that persists in contemporary cultures. The economic value of public activities and their correlative prestige elevates the male sphere above the female sphere. Without money and a sphere of their own, women lack the means to signify feminine activities as valued, social goods. Women’s symbolic sacrifice of childbearing for masculine power transcends the ancient world. Pressures to perform in exclusively masculine or feminine ways compel women to choose between home and work, husband and boss, children and career. Feminist work has clearly improved the experience and status of women in the public sphere. Women’s access to education and opportunities for economic advancement are equitable to men’s in most\n\n56 Athena to Barbie\n\ncontemporary societies. But private, domestic obligations remain insufficiently reformed. Repression of feminine identities in Western culture, read as both a bodily phenomenon and a discursive category. Feminine repression recurs in cultural narratives, social structures, religious practices, and political-­judicial systems.58 Greek sexuality operates within a one-­sex vertical system of biological sex with the male sex at the top of the hierarchy.59 Classical figures regard the female body as a derivation of the male standard and utilize the single-­sexed, two-­gendered system to honor the father above the mother.60 The use of bodies serves to situate differences between men and women: women birth babies. The use of women’s bodies also plays a highly significant role in the valuing of their bodies.61 Ancient women serve in prominent, religious roles as cult worship priestesses, caregivers of the temple (house) of cult statues, an analogous function to the caregiving they provide in private domestic spaces (cleaning, washing, decorating, weaving, and cooking).62 The use of female bodies for public religious rituals helps codify Greek constructions of femininity in antiquity.63 Caring for others is constitutive of femininity. Women’s so-­called caring (biologically constituted) nature includes reproduction. Young women of ancient Greece could serve in virgin priesthoods as temple figures and caregivers for a short time. But lifelong virginity—­an example set by Herakles as a punishment of Thespius’s daughter who rejects him—­is considered disgraceful as it violates feminine behavioral codes.64 Even the wise, conquering Athena cannot escape female bodily norms entirely.\n\nConquering Athena 57\n\nThis example of a late Archaic black-­figure amphora depicts the judgment of Paris. Fragmentary sources of the story, later elaborated by Ovid, narrate a battle for beauty among Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena. In this ancient beauty contest, the three goddesses irritate Zeus by fighting over who is the prettiest. Zeus appoints Paris as the judge to choose a winner and end the debate. Here Hermes, with his winged shoes and caduceus, leads Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite to Paris for judgment. True to their goddess nature, they negotiate with Paris to ensure a win: each offers a gift as a manifestation of her individual beauty. Hera, goddess of marriage and women, offers to make Paris king of all men; Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, promises him victory in battle; and Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, love, and procreation, promises Paris the hand of Helen of Troy,\n\nThe Group of Würzburg, Judgment of Paris, black-figured amphora, c. 510 BCE, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, U.S.A.\n\n58 Athena to Barbie\n\nthe most beautiful woman in the world. Paris selects Aphrodite, sealing women’s fate as sexual and reproductive creatures and initiating the Trojan War, a representation of woman’s power as lover. Athena dutifully refuses marriage and maternity for herself but presides over these life-­giving practices for Athens, exemplifying the value of self-­sacrifice.65 She exploits masculine identity to wrest power away from male gods, but the polis she creates never fully distinguishes the women of Athens from the goddess.66 Athena’s legacy of the womb—­a birthing of ideas, a performance of (masculine) intellectual labor—­does not bear out for the women who worship her. Even when female figures transcend the domestic sphere, their authority and subjectivity remain vested in their bodily form and labor. Women’s value resides in the biological use of the womb particularly. While the hierarchical privileging of masculinity drives the Greek repression of the feminine order, bodies bear different meanings in changing social and political circumstances.67 Enlightenment-­ era discourse reconstitutes the meaning of opposing bodies in a two-­sex construct: males and females are opposite sexes with irreducible differences (fundamental types rather than degrees of difference). The male-­female binary is codified in the eighteenth century as an ontological category.68 Men and women are by nature different and distinct, a division reinforced by Cartesian mind-­body dualism that gives rise to modern systems of meaning.69 Although we now admit the limitations and oversimplifications of the male/masculine and female/\n\nConquering Athena 59\n\nfeminine disjunction, this disjunction persists in the West’s collective cultural imagination. Bodies represent and mirror sexual differences. But bodies alone do not situate sexed identity. Pregnancy makes visible the shifting configurations of bodies and their cultural meanings—­for example, pregnant bodies signify the gap between sex (flesh) and gender (ideology).70 Wombs signify varied understandings of femininity: religious, political, libidinous, and aesthetic. The activities female bodies are expected to perform, the disciplining and coding of embodied female activities as feminine, normalize the disjunction between femininity and masculinity. Archetypal uses of women’s bodies—­for reproduction, comfort and protection, sexual gratification, and aesthetic pleasure—­reinforce the extant privileging of masculine over feminine performances of subjectivity. Athena’s performance of motherhood, her birthing of the polis, authorizes the privileging of the masculine order, an order that seeks comfort in the feminine sphere. Contemporary women nurture children and careers: they have private and public responsibilities. But the implicit logic of the disjunction and the underlying structure of the community in which the disjunction is embedded resist women’s movements between feminine and masculine spheres of action. Many social and economic barriers to women’s equality are rooted in the denigration of the suppressed feminine, bodily order. Athena’s archetype of woman does little to help women with careers and families embody coherent self-­identities. Her subversi"
