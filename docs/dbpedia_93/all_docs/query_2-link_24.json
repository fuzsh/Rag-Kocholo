Cyberculture is a product of technological innovations in the process of developing new experiences of delivering information and sustaining communication. This article discusses how cyberculture shares the common interest of people within its community with the objective of helping to educate oneself and be proactive in seeking for social change. Cyberactivitism is one way of pushing the community to react on the questionable decisions and actions of either private establishment or government institutions. Participating in youth oriented online activities that seek to develop unity in fighting against corruption is also being emphasized on this article. Moving towards the achievement of holistic education with e-learning demonstrates the active involvement of education sector in changing the traditional way of providing quality education to the youth of information age.\n\nThis paper is based on a research project developed in Spain, where we explored how and what young people learn in virtual communities. Although the term virtual community has been broadly used to approach online social interactions, it has generated several academic debates. Nevertheless, it is a useful term to define a social network made up mostly of young people who share an interest and choose to interact online with others to discuss, exchange, show their creations to the world, and promote certain values. As researchers on Sociology and Education, we find this phenomenon especially intriguing. We wonder why young people engage in virtual communities, why they should spend so much time interacting with others online and what benefits they consider they have. Our hypothesis is that it has to do with a shared sense of belonging to a community and the possibilities young people find to create opportunities to learn with and from each other. The results of this article are based on the analysis of seven case studies conducted in virtual communities, and they address two main questions: what leads young people to participate in virtual communities and how is learning and social participation promoted through virtual communities. Resumen: El presente trabajo está basado en un proyecto de investigación llevado a cabo en España, donde exploramos cómo y cuándo los jóvenes aprenden en comunidades virtuales. Aunque el término «comunidad virtual» se ha utilizado ampliamente para abordar interacciones sociales en línea, ha generado varios debates académicos. Sin embargo, es un término útil para definir una red social constituida mayormente por jóvenes que comparten intereses y eligen interactuar en línea con otros para discutir, intercambiar, mostrar sus creaciones con el mundo y promover ciertos valores. Como investigadores de Sociología y Educación, consideramos este fenómeno particularmente intrigante. Nos preguntamos por qué los jóvenes se involucran con las comunidades virtuales, por qué pasan tanto tiempo interactuando con otros en línea y qué beneficios consideran que tiene. Nuestra hipótesis es que guarda relación con un sentido de pertenencia a una comunidad y con las posibilidades que los jóvenes encuentran para crear oportunidades para aprender con otros y de ellos. Los resultados del presente artículo tienen base en el análisis de siete casos de estudio llevados a cabo en comunidades virtuales y pretenden contestar dos preguntas principales: ¿qué lleva a los jóvenes a participar en las comunidades virtuales? y ¿cómo se promueven el aprendizaje y la participación social a través de las comunidades virtuales?\n\nGlobalization trends leading to an intensification in migration processes and intercultural interaction. They are influenced by information society technologies, which guide interpersonal and intercultural communication through the virtual information space. The study of the socio-cultural specificity of the functioning of social networks as a new paradigm of social community and their impact on the transformation of the social structure has been initiated by new social practices and normative orientations and possibilities of social control over them. The effectiveness of the communication network as a universal sociocultural mechanism is the result of the coming into existence and functioning of culture in relation to social parameters. The use of information and communication technologies makes bridging intercultural boundaries much easier. As the overall number of Internet users has increased, so has not only the social significance of the networks, but also the numerous problems associated with personal self-identification in these communities, social practices, normative values and possibilities of social control over them. In these circumstances, the model of cultural identification and self-identification is not just transforming, but there are also new trends outlining themselves in the representation of the \"cultural core\". From here one can identify the major trends for development of cultural differentiation processes and for overcoming cultural boundaries in virtual space, which can both lead to intercultural dialogue and to the destruction of the \"cultural kernel\"."
