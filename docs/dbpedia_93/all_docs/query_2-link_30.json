        "text": "How to Survive on TikTok\n\nThe social media platform for video shorts is transforming the cultural industries, with impacts on creators, audiences and critics alike.\n\nA man with a girl, photographing a doll in a baby carriage, 1915-120 | Library of Congress | Public domain\n\nTikTok’s algorithm has changed the way we access content on social media. While previously we followed users, we’re now sucked in by trends. This has had a significant effect on the panorama of cultural creation, impacting everything from the type of work produced to the relationship between artist and public and the role of critics and tastemaking.\n\nThere’s something about TikTok that reminds me of the success of popular sweets – half the world likes it despite its low nutritional value. And, as in the world of chocolate and sweets, its competitors try to reproduce the formula to capture some of its market share. In the case of the Chinese platform, we caught a first glimpse of this after it consolidated its position in the West, following the coronavirus pandemic. Locked down in their homes, millions of people found that its content offered a quick form of entertainment – short videos on a very wide variety of specific topics. Its popularity was so dizzying that, among other things, it forced Instagram to reinvent itself by coming up with Reels and YouTube with Shorts.\n\nTikTok’s secret lies not only in the length of its videos, but also in its algorithm, which brings up ultra-personalised content based on a very detailed set of data which includes the videos shared between users and the viewing time of each one, even if they haven’t ‘liked’ the clip. And the satisfying experience it offers isn’t just for consumers, it also takes in the content creators – the ‘For You’ tab shows accounts both with and without lots of followers, because the platform’s goal is also to give visibility to those who are just starting out. Coupled with an easy way to create and edit videos, it’s faster and easier for content creators to grow than on the other popular platforms.\n\nIn other words, TikTok wants you to discover new creators all the time, while also rewarding newbies by giving them more exposure – a loop that rewards both sides with dopamine. It’s a system that works well in terms of attention and plays, but it affects the generation of communities, because users no longer follow people so much as trends, which by definition are fleeting.\n\nThis situation is putting the creative industries on alert, and some people have even begun to criticise it. This is the case of Jack Conte, co-founder of the platform Patreon, who in his talk at this year’s SXSW festival highlighted some of the problems with the current recommendation algorithms. Conte mentioned how, until recently, creators would post content and, if users were interested in the material, they would click ‘follow’ or subscribe to their channel. The more content they posted, the more their audience grew. This is how the logic of followers works, one of the central aspects of Web 2.0. But now things have changed – users’ feeds are based less on the accounts they follow than on the topics that interest them. Ergo, the connection between the creator and the audience has weakened.\n\nOn the other side of the screen, this doesn’t seem like an ideal situation either. Apart from the creators, does this benefit or harm consumers? It’s difficult to say, because there are conflicting opinions. If we take the case of a platform like Spotify, users have access to an endless amount of music through an affordable monthly subscription (or at least that’s the optimistic argument), but this very fact leads to a fragmented and anxious consumption in which people listen to tracks before discarding them (although not before tapping out a story or a tweet). This explains, at least partly, why the most popular music today (as can be seen in the platform’s own charts) are songs with an immediate impact, which get the choruses or melodic hooks in at the beginning. It’s also no coincidence that the narrative of success in this industry is currently measured in the number of plays or sell-outs, while overlooking aspects more intrinsically linked to artistic production or, to put it in Benjaminian terms, materialist aesthetics.\n\nThe possibility of access to virtually unlimited content changed the rules of culture, and also the role of critics, as their expertise no longer carries the same weight as before. In a recent article for The Atlantic, writer W. David Marx discusses how “cultural arbitrage” has changed in the past few years. “In the past, tastemakers in the worlds of fashion, art, and music established careers through this sort of arbitrage – plucking interesting developments from subcultures to dangle as novelties in the mass market,” Marx writes, “But the internet’s sprawling databases, real-time social-media networks, and globe-spanning e-commerce platforms have made almost everything immediately searchable, knowable, or purchasable – curbing the social value of sharing new things. Cultural arbitrage now happens so frequently and rapidly as to be nearly undetectable.”\n\nThat past, however, is only recognisable to those who experienced it. It would be unfair not to point out that TikTok also brought Generation Z into contact with content which would have otherwise been difficult for them to access. This is a generation that is not only used to living in a hyper-connected world, but also to being prosumers, which is why certain disciplines once considered specialised, even elitist, are now popular thanks to the creativity of good community managers. For example, the fashion analysis around events such as the Met Gala, the geopolitics of international conflicts, or museology, which brings a fresh perspective to classic works of art in order to attract a young audience.\n\nHere again, the pandemic had a crucial impact. When they were forced to shut shop for months, many organisations had to resort to the virtual space to stay relevant. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence became a paradigmatic case when it began to publish videos on TikTok with explanations of some of the paintings in its collection, which were somewhat irreverent and with contemporary songs in the background, but without drifting off-point from telling the story of a work of art. Other more modest museums also found that the Chinese platform was a good space for reaching more people, and even the specialised publication The Art Newspaper published an article last December in which it recommended that museums have a TikTok specialist on their staff (TikTok itself has invested in giving the creators of educational content greater reach).\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that it’s not easy for quality content on TikTok to reach its audience if it’s surrounded by gimmicky videos designed for engagement and light consumption, like those sweets we mentioned at the beginning. Invisibility is a constant risk in this new cultural industry scenario, forcing players to get used to a kind of paradox – interacting with trends, but without losing their authenticity. To continue with the gastronomic metaphor, it is the attempt to provide some protein in the middle of a Doritos binge, as suggested by a popular theory created, of all places, on TikTok.\n\nLooking back over the history of the past few decades, we can see that whenever new formats have arrived, they have always threatened to consign the old ones to the rubbish heap. But they have only succeeded with the less interesting ones, because television did not kill cinema, and music festivals did not spell the end of gigs in dingy pubs. And so it is that, between fruit-peeling tutorials, videos of mischievous kittens and frenetic dance moves, the epic story behind a painting or a novel may slip in. After all, if there’s one thing a classic must prove, it’s its ability to survive the centuries.\n\nWatch Out for the Doorman. Technology and Neighbourhood Surveillance\n\nThe trends in new digital surveillance tools in the current culture of security and control.\n\nIn a world full of uncertainty, many of us are looking for a safe place where we can live in peace. Aware of this need, the security industry has created platforms and devices aimed at protecting homes and neighbourhoods that, nevertheless, foster a culture of mistrust and social control.\n\nIn 2019, the photographer Blanca Munt discovered that her local neighbourhood had a chat group where residents could warn each other of possible burglaries. She lived in Mira-sol, an area of detached houses in Sant Cugat del Vallès, one of Spain’s wealthiest municipalities. After getting her parents to give her access to the group, Munt witnessed how what seemed to be a useful tool for preventing crime and getting to know the neighbours better was actually a channel full of tensions and friction resulting from a combination of fear, suspicion and indignation at what was perceived to be a constant threat to safety. Parts of those conversations are included in the photobook Alerta Mira-sol, shown in the exhibition Suburbia. Building the American Dream.\n\nHalfway between tragedy and farce, Alerta Mira-sol reflects the concept of ‘disturbia,’ which refers to the anxieties of the inhabitants of big-city suburbs. Coined in 1960 by the psychologists Richard and Katherine Gordon, the term reflects the fear of people breaking into the home – whether vandals, burglars or serial killers – that has been so extensively exploited in American fiction. A fear that, however, is implicit in the suburban lifestyle, which lends itself to identical houses inhabited by families all similar in age, income and lifestyle, and in which the notion of “otherness” is clearly defined.\n\nThe fact is that moving away from city centres does not solve the problem of safety. As the journalist Jorge Dioni López points out in La España de las piscinas, “Walls do not create peace of mind, but anxiety. The stronger the desire for order and tranquillity, the more things seem ambiguous and, therefore, potentially dangerous. There can never be enough walls.”\n\nFrom neighbours to vigilantes\n\nWhatsApp groups – a necessary evil that cover the most diverse range of areas – are useful for solving day-to-day problems in a neighbourhood. In the specific case of security, however, they can generate conversations that lead in an uncertain direction. “Could my neighbours be violent?” worries Blanca Munt when she reads some of the messages encouraging people to attack intruders in Mira-sol. Chats like the ones described in her photobook channel atavistic concerns that are very difficult to manage and which can easily lead to intolerance and hysteria.\n\nThe phenomenon of neighbourhood organisation to combat insecurity is not new. It could be framed within a series of practices that were born in the United States in the 1960s and that came to be called “neighbourhood watch,” a crime-prevention strategy in which the community itself takes an active role in protecting its neighbourhood, alerting the police to the presence of any suspicious person or activity. Although the nature of these practices depends very much on the specific context in which they emerge, they are, by definition, problematic, as to some degree they appropriate a coercive function that belongs to the forces of the state.\n\nFrom an ideological point of view, this practice is based on the ultra-liberal belief that not only does the individual not benefit from the state, but that, to a certain extent, they are restricted by the state. Its staunchest advocates argue that it is necessary to “take back” certain powers and responsibilities that have been stolen from them, including the right to ensure their own safety. This philosophy can be put into practice in a variety of ways, ranging from neighbourhood committees that share information and recommendations, to the hiring of private security, to the organisation of neighbourhood patrols. The last of these are particularly controversial because they are a very tangible way of visibilising hostility towards anything different or unknown, which often makes them attractive to xenophobic and extreme-right-wing groups.\n\nThe ring of safety\n\nThe tradition of community policing in the United States has evolved technologically beyond WhatsApp groups, and nowadays various platforms allow the residents of any neighbourhood to share information and report suspicious activity. This is the case of applications such as Citizen, formerly known as Vigilante, whose mission is “to make your world a safer place.” The service generates real-time alerts based on calls received by the emergency services and geolocates the data on a map, encouraging users to record videos of what’s happening to inform the rest of the community. Even Nextdoor, which was first created as a tool to encourage neighbourly help and spiked in popularity during the coronavirus epidemic, has been called into question as a tool that can foster racism and a culture of paranoia.\n\nAmong all the platforms, however, Neighbors stands out above the rest. Not so much for its features, as many of them are also offered by competing services, but for having woven a web of public-private relationships that has led to one of the most disturbing episodes of neighbourhood surveillance in recent times.\n\nLet’s take a look at the details – Neighbors is an app that brings users together to share information on security-related matters. The platform is owned by Ring, a manufacturer of smart home devices, known especially for its video doorbell, which makes it possible to see people approaching a door via a smartphone and talk to them, regardless of where the owners are. It is so popular that it dominates the market, to the extent that Ring has become the generic name for the entire category of products. One last detail – Ring is owned by Amazon, which bought the company in 2018 and fitted the product into its attempt to dominate the Internet-of-Things market, using its marketplace as a sales and distribution platform.\n\nAs they said in La Haine, “So far, so good.” Things get (more) complicated because Neighbors includes a feature that allows users not only to send alerts, but also to share images captured with Ring products. This means high-resolution recordings of everything that can be seen from the front door of a house, be it vehicles or passers-by, including minors. And if that wasn’t enough, from 2018 to 2024, Ring signed agreements with more than 2,000 US law enforcement agencies to provide them with on-demand images if they requested them for an investigation.\n\nIn practice, this meant that thousands of police officers had access to a portal through which they could choose a date, time and location on a map, and Neighbour users with cameras in the vicinity received a request to authorise access to the content. In the most advanced video doorbell models, these recordings were high-definition, with colour night vision and even recordings of the routes visitors took around the houses, thanks to 3D motion detection.\n\nRing always defended the feature based on the fact that the images were given with users’ consent, but in 2022 it confessed, at the request of a US senator, that it had provided recordings without consent in situations that the company’s managers had assessed as being “emergencies.” The company also argued that police never knew which specific owners received the requests, but a Gizmodo investigation revealed the locations of tens of thousands of cameras in 15 cities by studying metadata from more than 65,000 posts from 500 days of activity on the app.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, the company has also suffered a number of security incidents, including not only hacker attacks, but the revelation that its employees had access to live and recorded images from all the cameras and that recordings were stored unencrypted. Probably because of all this, in January 2024 Ring announced that it was stopping its collaboration with law enforcement agencies, ending six years of access to the recordings.\n\nTwitching curtains\n\nAlthough they can strengthen security, or at least provide reassurance to owners, surveillance tools such as Ring also increase the sense of threat and permanent suspicion which are essential in a culture of control. Although hackneyed, the reference to Foucault is unavoidable, as way back in 1975 the French philosopher pointed out how the simple awareness that we could be watched at any time (through the panopticon, or in this case Ring’s network of cameras) automatically exerts a power, regardless of whether we are actually being watched or not.\n\nIn Alerta Mira-sol, Blanca Munt writes that one of the most unsettling aspects of the chat group in which she participated is that, far from fostering a sense of community, it reflected the community’s absolute disintegration, driven by a fear that made everyone and everything suspicious; a prelude to what, just a few months later, would become coronavirus. The dream of suburban life, with its quiet streets and separate plots of land, became an exile in which it was vital to be suspicious of the unknown.\n\nThe paradox of safety in residential areas is that, while their inhabitants have fled the big cities in search of peace and quiet, they have also left behind the spaces for coming together and socialising that can be essential for living in safety. This was one of the convictions held by the urbanist and activist Jane Jacobs, who argued, in her classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, that the more populated and diverse a street is, the more windows that can see what is going on outside, the safer it is, as the scene is observed by the eyes of dozens of neighbours, shopkeepers, passers-by, waiters… “Safety on the streets by surveillance and mutual policing of one another sounds grim,” she acknowledges, “but in real life it is not grim. The safety of the street works best, most casually, and with least frequent taint of hostility or suspicion precisely where people are using and most enjoying the streets voluntarily and are least conscious, normally, that they are policing.”\n\nTherefore, the secret may lie not in minimising insecurity or using technology to heighten surveillance, but in understanding that mutual care is something that emerges in neighbourhoods and communities that grow in healthy conditions, where personal protection is achieved through the shared interests of the community.\n\nReclaiming the internet\n\nA run through the history of the internet, its potentials and downfalls, with an eye on the new paths to be carved out.\n\nA group of people lifting a giant inflatable ball. Cronulla, Austraila, 1939 | State Library of New South Wales | Public domain\n\nThe internet is the most decentralised achievement in human history, the most effective and efficient machine ever invented to put knowledge within the reach of the majority and at the service of grassroots social organisation. Which is why, despite its privatisation and the appropriation of our data and content, it is still possible to imagine other futures for the net. Courtesy of consonni, we publish a preview of Las redes son nuestras (The networks are ours), a book by Marta G. Franco.\n\nThefts and losses\n\nEight years ago, the internet was stolen from us. We’d gone too far, and they took it away from us. Starting in 2011, when the internet became synonymous with social media, we organised the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt, Geração à Rasca in Portugal, 15M in Spain, Occupy Wall Street in the US, YoSoy132 in Mexico, Occupy Gezi in Turkey, Vem Pra Rua in Brazil… Millions of us used social media to generate the noise, propaganda and furore that fuelled mass social movements. We drove a diverse range of political changes, but even though we might consider them to be insufficient, the fact is that we went too far. The forces of evil reorganised themselves – they learned from our collective intelligence tactics and turned them into a set of methods for cheating and bullying. They have benefitted everyone from Trump to Vox and Milei, in an alignment that we could call Hate International. Now, those platforms that helped us find each other and organise ourselves are a minefield of unpleasant experiences. Actually, it was the second time that the internet was stolen from us. It happened before, when the business model emerged based on monetising the social dynamics that we had invented. It was the anti-globalisation movement that began to program webpages where anyone could publish with just one click. It was 1999, and the aim was to get the word out about demonstrations and publish the videos. Later, Google bought the technology that was used to launch Blogspot and took over YouTube. The trend of users creating content became known as Web 2.0, and we were told that it placed us at the centre. They forgot to mention that our role would be to work for free 24/7 to produce the most valuable raw material – data. It was a fantastic coup to get the internet back into the claws of an industry that was then at a low ebb.\n\nIn fact, eight years ago may well have been the third time the internet was stolen from us. Going back even further, it’s well known that when it was created, the World Wide Web was a thing of nerds and enthusiasts who wanted to share ideas in chat rooms and websites with dodgy aesthetics. Unfortunately, the smartarses arrived and tried to turn it into a business through the dotcom IPOs, whose bubble burst at the turn of the millennium, but not before the amateurish charm of the invention had been obliterated forever. So, if we have to give a number of thefts, it may well be three. This timeline of collective intelligences and capitalist takeovers has been recounted many times, but here I would like to run through it while leaving out the myths. Even if we believe that the technical layer of what we now call the internet was designed in Silicon Valley (and even this would be giving them too much credit), the invention and continuous innovation in its uses is a global creative work, mostly from below and, basically, with a sparse presence of rich white American men. It takes an exercise in internet history to highlight the role of hacklabs, public research centres, streamers pounding the sidewalks and ladies sending memes to WhatsApp groups, among many other actors that don’t usually appear in epic tales of successful entrepreneurs.\n\nGoing through this history of victories – because if we were robbed and lost three times it’s because before that, three times, we were winning – is not an exercise in impotent nostalgia, but a way to remember that winning is possible. That the internet can be a place for learning, cooperating and working towards something that is much more like the world we would like to live in.\n\nThe cracks are appearing\n\nIn the spring of 2020, something happened that had a decisive impact on many areas, including the internet – those pandemic weeks in which millions of us stayed at home changed our relationship with digital environments. Those who, until then, hadn’t paid much attention to them also realised that they’re full of rubbish. By the time we were able to go outside, everyone knew that social media is a toxic habit.\n\nBut the pandemic was just the straw that broke the camel’s back – our love affair with social media had already been deflating for some time. For Mark Zuckerberg to want to change the name of his company to the bland Meta, he had to suffer a series of setbacks that included the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the loss of interest in the Facebook wall (where nowadays you’ll only find your parents), the obsolescence of the plastic influencers that populate Instagram and the realisation that his products were so out of date that even moving them to a new meta-universe wouldn’t save them. No one would have believed it four or five years ago, but Facebook Inc. no longer exists, and its successor is neither a leader nor does it look like it will ever get on its feet.\n\nThe decline of commercial social platforms has progressed hand in hand with the perception that they are a problem for democracy. Hacktivists had long warned that they were highly problematic as a space for public debate. Sadly, it took a man with the charisma of Pepe the Frog to become US president to prove them right. The storming of the Capitol in January 2021 attested to the fact that liberal democracy is broken; the replay two years later by Bolsonaro supporters reminded us that it’s not easily fixed. The fact that the far right is ruling or knocking on the doors of so many governments is also conclusive, even pushing Brussels to demand increased regulation and accountability. However, given the number of ills perpetrated by political, media and economic powers in the neoliberal era, it is absurdly reductionist to blame the decline on algorithms.\n\nThe downturn is proving hard, and tech companies have laid off several hundred thousand workers. The list is led by Meta, but Amazon, Twitter and Netflix are also high on the list. Data extractivism is being renewed by designing applications for something they call “artificial intelligence,” which has the virtue of generating mediocre texts and ugly images after swallowing content created by people they don’t want to pay. But the new business model is not enough to share the pie across San Francisco, and the investors who fund the promises of profits are losing patience. “Tech bros” have been reduced to the caricature we always suspected they were. The grotesque spectacle that Elon Musk is making of his attempt to put Twitter at the service of his anti-political agenda is terrible news because it leaves us without alternatives for global conversation. However, the fact that Mastodon has accrued millions of inhabitants may indicate interesting times ahead for self-hosted infrastructures.\n\nIf we have learned anything over these few years, it’s to avoid optimistic and naïve outlooks. The internet is no longer a place that is amenable to experimentation and learning. It is now the dense, addictive, anxiety-triggering land where unicorns live and get rich selling hot air, and where data analysts and content creators survive at the cost of their mental health; where you can earn enough money to buy a house in Andorra, but can also have your life ruined if someone digs up something inappropriate that you wrote years ago. The internet is the birthplace of the applications that are making our working and living conditions more precarious. We have lost our innocence, but also our trust. Which is why the will to look outwards and the interest in inventing new worlds is coming back.\n\nAnd the lights that illuminate unknown realms\n\nThe fact that the price we pay for using the internet is getting higher and higher has a flip side – the social contract with the big tech companies is breaking down. We are bombarded with texts and gurus offering self-help formulas and, to a lesser extent, the politicisation of discomfort. We talk about digital detox, the right to disconnect, resources to bring down fake news and collective counterattack measures. We want to build our own agenda, our own media, our own fake news. There must be life beyond the commercial platforms. Finally, there is talk of the need to provide digital infrastructures as public services. If the state is in charge of maintaining libraries, schools and pavements, why not also spaces for conversation on the internet? I don’t think the state would be the best way, because we have had too many experiences where it wasn’t, but I don’t know of any means of intervention that is so transversal and hegemonic, so we will have to push in that direction.\n\nIt may also be necessary to promote more channels for public-private partnership, but without forgetting a third way – that of the commons. This is the one that interests me most because it is the best way to achieve social justice. Since the 1980s, the free software movement has been proving itself to be a very solid formula for development. At first glance, the free culture movement may seem to have got stuck in 2002 with the creation of Creative Commons licences, but a more understanding look will highlight the fact that Wikipedia continues to exist and has not stopped growing. We will have to recycle all the lessons learned over these decades to make sure that the third sector and social movements are prepared to face the renewed interest in self-managed digital spaces.\n\nAnother good amount of support for change is coming (surprise, surprise), from trade unions – hardly anyone saw it coming, but the strikes at Amazon and Uber and the organisation of riders are having relative success in twisting the arms of some big data merchants and winning rights, at least in Europe. Meanwhile, although they are far from being feasible alternatives for everyone, attempts to create apps to sell services more ethically, initiatives to create low-tech solutions and gadget-repair workshops can only pull in the same direction. All of this adds up to workers and consumers gaining autonomy from big business.\n\nThere is still much to do and to imagine. It will even be necessary to rethink the very idea of technology – to redefine the old notion of what development is and is not, to investigate who is behind the invention of the networks themselves, to think of ways to ensure that future designs are more participatory and connected to the real needs of the communities affected. We need to get off the rails laid for the locomotives of the billionaire overlords that are going to be derailed. To build other roads where we can move more comfortably. In the hybridisations of hackers with feminist, decolonial and climate justice movements there is a lot of initiative and a lot of strength to imagine a digital commons.\n\nDigital Gentrification\n\nContent platform algorithms reward lowest-common-denominator material and narrow the space for experimentation.\n\nGroup of dancers in clown costume performing in the original Wintergarten ‘Pony Ballet’. Brisbane, Queensland, 1926 | State Library of Queensland | Public domain\n\nSongs written to match the next TikTok trend, series based on the dictates of platform metrics. Algorithms not only mediate our recommendations, they also have an increasingly large impact on the content and format of cultural creations. An article published courtesy of Caja Negra Editora.\n\nIn early 2018, musician and writer Damon Krukowski noticed that something strange was happening on Spotify with his old band, Galaxie 500. On the platform, the most popular song by the Boston band (together from 1987 to 1991) was “Strange,” which had never been released as a single, did not appear in any popular films or series, and was not included on any of Spotify’s playlists. It was also markedly different to the rest of the band’s output, even to those songs that seemed to be most popular with Galaxie 500 fans. Another thing that caught Krukowski’s attention was the fact that this was only happening on Spotify, not on the other music streaming platforms.\n\n“Strange” was, indeed, peculiar in terms of the compositional style of the dream pop group. Written almost as a parody of the pop music of the time – the late 1980s – it sounded more like an old radio hit than the band’s own creation, which seemed to explain, at least partially, the song’s popularity on Spotify. When Krukowski wrote about this oddity in his newsletter, it caught the attention of Glenn McDonald, one of Spotify’s top data analysts (remember the name, because we’ll come back to him towards the end).\n\nMcDonald did some internal snooping into what was going on with “Strange” and discovered that the track sounded similar to songs from bands that were more mainstream and popular than Galaxie 500. “Strange” had managed to “slip into the algorithm” thanks to the characteristics of the music itself. Another reason was that, in 2017, Spotify introduced a feature called autoplay, which automatically plays a similar-sounding track at the end of each album or playlist.\n\nTo put it simply, anything that sounds generic and popular is much more likely to be recommended on today’s internet. As a result, it’s difficult for less conventional material to stand out. Although this sounds quite logical today, it clashes head-on with the spirit of the 1990s, when the internet seemed to open the doors to a new world, one ruled less by power brokers and more by the curiosity of internet users.\n\nThat utopian vision did not last long. The Galaxie 500 anecdote features in Filterworld, the book in which journalist Kyle Chayka analyses how recommendation algorithms are flattening culture. “This is how algorithmic normalization happens. Normal is a word for the unobtrusive and average, whatever won’t provoke negative reactions,” he writes. “Whichever content fits in that zone of averageness sees accelerated promotion and growth, like “Strange” did, while the rest falls by the wayside.”\n\nPhoto by Fath | Unsplash\n\nThis is not a particularly new phenomenon, but it has clearly expanded and accelerated in recent years and is affecting industries outside of music and film. Leaving our choices in the hands of algorithms (ones fed by our previous behaviours), coupled with the overwhelming amount of content being constantly produced, is creating a consumer culture where what works is what stands out. An “average culture,” one where experimentation and transgression are not allowed if you want to be visible.\n\nA representative example of this state of affairs is the current array of hits, which get the chorus in early on to avoid being skipped by the anxious listener. Spotify only monetises tracks that notch up at least one thousand plays, in addition to which it has just introduced an option that allows the user to listen to the “best 20 seconds” of each track, so that everything is designed for immediate consumption.\n\nSome have called it the “TikTokisation” of culture. And it makes sense – although it had already been around for a few years, TikTok became globally popular in 2020, the year of the lockdowns, when people spent long hours indoors and most socialising and entertainment was via social media. TikTok’s algorithm takes just a few minutes to detect the user’s interests, before offering a list of videos that appeal to them.\n\nAs a social network, the Chinese platform changed the rules of the game set by its predecessors. You can follow accounts, but its greatest strength lies in its categories. Users follow interests, not people. This not only differentiated it from the classic versions of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, but it also forced these platforms to change their own algorithms and imitate TikTok’s formats (reels in the case of Instagram; the For you and Following tabs in the case of the platform now called X).\n\nThis new state of play has also changed the behaviour of influencers – the pop figures of platform capitalism. While before they stood out for their area of expertise (fashion, gastronomy, travel, fitness, film and a long etcetera), many of them now “chase” the algorithm to stay relevant, keeping their eye on what does and doesn’t work in order to adapt to a reality that is changing at breakneck speed. In terms not only of content, but also formats (images, vertical and horizontal video, texts, photo galleries) – a reality that threatens any chance of quality, as it’s very hard to stand out on all fronts. Which is why, in recent times, content creators have emerged who are experts in a particular subject before suddenly becoming coaches, yoga masters or financial gurus. As their original style begins to weaken, the survival instinct forces them to pursue content with greater engagement.\n\nThe technology that came to democratise knowledge and offer new ways of accessing information is going through a critical moment, an example of what the French urbanist Paul Virilio called “integral accidents” – a technology cannot exist without the accidents or side effects that arise after mass implementation. On the surface, recommendation algorithms are useful because they allow users to save time and get what they want, but their effects are far from neutral. The obvious consequence is the flattening mentioned at the beginning – songs written to match the next TikTok trend, series based on the dictates of on-demand platform metrics, serialised content for fragmented, fast and ultra-processed consumption.\n\nPhoto by Kivanc Erdirik | Unsplash\n\nIn an investigation titled “Algorithms and taste-making: Exposing the Netflix Recommender System’s operational logics” (2021), Niko Pajkovic experimented with inventing three users based on different stereotypes, namely the die-hard sports fan, the culture snob and the hopeless romantic. In the first few days of his experiment, he began to notice changes in the homepage of each of these users (something to be expected), but he also made other discoveries – in the thumbnail images of each film or series, for example. The home screen of the sports fan showed “images that included movement and dynamic colours” (even though they were not strictly sports material), while the screen of the culture snob “was dominated by darker hues, black and white artwork images and plenty of actor headshots.”\n\nThis can even happen with the same product. In October 2018, some Netflix users accused the platform of using different thumbnails of the film Love Actually depending on the profile. For example, a poster featuring Chiwetel Ejiofor, who doesn’t have a leading role in the film, raised suspicions that black subscribers were being shown posters with black actors. Netflix was quick to dismiss the issue in a statement noting that its algorithm was not guided by “race, gender or ethnicity,” but solely by the user’s viewing history.\n\nSo-called “filter bubbles” have been around for at least 15 years, when Google started customising its search engine results in 2009, but even after several investigations, the power of their influence has never been fully defined. The effects of this echo chamber can be clearly perceived on news consumption, whereby when a user becomes interested in information that leans in a certain political direction, coupled with their behaviour (likes, shares, comments), the algorithm tends to show similar content.\n\nThis system of distribution and validation of web content is susceptible to generating polarisation, as we have been seeing in the sphere of politics for some time now. But just as on some issues it produces extreme opinions, in terms of cultural consumption it seems to go the other way. “While political bubbles silo users into opposing factions by disagreement, cultural recommendations bring them together toward the goal of building larger and larger audiences for the lowest-common-denominator material,” argues Chayka in his book.\n\nAnother example he uses to illustrate this problem is what he calls “Instagram coffee shops” – coffee shops that follow a pattern taken from the predominant aesthetic of this social network (pastel-coloured walls and armchairs, generic pictures on the wall and baristas ready to prepare their umpteenth flat white of the day), and which can be found in any city in the world, in a kind of global gentrification influenced by the culture of algorithms.\n\nThese algorithms do not have “taste” in the sense that a human might, which is why using the word “recommendation” is problematic. They are mathematical formulas programmed to detect patterns in collective human consumption and then link them to individual consumption. This is what Glenn McDonald explained in a recent interview in the newspaper El Diario. The “data alchemist,” as he is popularly known, was responsible for some of Spotify’s most popular algorithms, as well as creating Every Noise at Once, a massive music map with genres from across the world.\n\nMcDonald left the company last December, following staff cuts. “In public libraries there’s public ownership. Not at Spotify – there are just economic interests. But my work has never been driven primarily by business imperatives,” he said at one point in the interview, before adding that “we should all be afraid. Anyone who works with technology related to human activity should keep that in mind in everything they do. And listen to their conscience. I always felt relieved to work for a music streaming platform rather than a health insurance service.”\n\nYuk Hui: “We are living in a gigantic technological system”\n\nThe Hongkongese philosopher advises deepening our technological imagination outside the confines of the capitalist hegemony and colonialism.\n\nWe talk to the philosopher Yuk Hui about the shift from the industrial to the cybernetic age, the uselessness of our current-day dystopian discourses and the need to encourage a diversity of technological thinkings able to combat the homogenisation of capitalism.\n\n“Whoever invokes ‘humanity’ wants to cheat.” Yuk Hui begins with this warning, a paraphrase of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon by Carl Schmitt and an indication of Hui’s steadfast stance against the totalising discourses of modernity. In contrast, for Hui, our intimate and inexorable relationship with technology can only be fruitfully considered if we accept that there is a multiplicity of technological thinking located within individual world views that guarantee their diversity. Just as there is not one, but diverse humanities, so there is not one technology, but multiple cosmotechnics. This is the philosophical project that Hui has developed over the course of his relatively short but prolific philosophical career, which includes works such as On the Existence of Digital Objects (University of Minnesota Press, 2016), The Question Concerning Technology in China (Urbanomic, 2016), Recursivity and Contingency (Rowman i Littlefield, 2019), Art and Cosmotechnics (University of Minnesota Press, 2021) and his compilation of articles published in Spanish, Fragmentar el Futuro (Caja Negra, 2020).\n\nHui is a somewhat anomalous case in the history of the philosophy of technology. In a way that diverges from the infamous division between two types of philosophies of technology proposed by Carl Mitcham in the late 1980s, to wit, one centred around engineering and another, more humanistic philosophy, Hui first studied systems engineering before eventually going on to earn a PhD in Philosophy under the supervision of his mentor, Bernard Stiegler. It is this fact, that he transcends both disciplines, which allows him to offer an informed look at the hyper-technological condition of our contemporary world.\n\nToday, what defines our technological condition is the development and expansion of cybernetic technologies. While the technological leap that occurred during the Industrial Revolution was characterised by the introduction of automation, in our time we no longer have only automated technologies, but technologies that are able to regulate themselves and maintain a more open relationship with their environment. In other words, to become more autonomous. And not only that, but the world in which we live is now shaped more than ever by this web of technology. Hui echoes Jacques Ellul when he says that “We are living in a gigantic technological system.”\n\nHowever, this condition is dominated by a capitalist logic that homogenises our relationship with technology. This is reflected in the adoption of the utopian or dystopian discourses that the media are so fond of espousing, which sketch out a series of idyllic or catastrophic futures that seem like something out of science fiction. “It seems like we live in the time of science fiction. We talk a lot about AI domination, about mass unemployment. More and more people are trying to understand our future through science fiction. “I find this really disturbing. I’m a big fan of science fiction, but I find this problematic because it means that we fail to analyse our concrete situation.” Just as Gilbert Simondon – an author whose work is key to understanding Hui’s philosophy – opposed our imaginings around robots in the introduction to his book On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects (University of Minnesota Press, 2016), Hui rejects the catastrophic imaginings that have been inspired by technological automation and artificial intelligence. To the contrary, we must develop a new critique of economic policy that specifically highlights the technological problems of the present in order to understand the new forms of alienation ushered in by contemporary technology.\n\nFor Hui, the goal should be to deepen our technological imagination outside of the capitalist hegemony and colonialism, to generate localised understandings rooted in the particular historical relationships between each culture and its own technological advancements. “We have to accept that there are a multiplicity of technological thinkings. The process of modernisation is a form of colonisation. Modernisation implies a homogenisation of knowledge and world views.” We have the impression that technology is universal, but we fail to understand technology in the same terms of multinaturalism that are talked about by anthropologists such as Eduardo Viveiros de Castro or Philippe Descola. This implies localising technological thought, hence the importance of his concepts of cosmotechnics and technodiversity. “If we think about the multiplicity of technologies in different philosophical traditions, we can see that technology has different relations to aesthetic, philosophical and religious thinking.” However, this does not imply a return to pre-modern or pre-capitalist forms of technology as some outmoded romantics have tried to propose (which would be impossible from the outset), but of reframing, fracturing and diversifying our technological condition.\n\nThe Other AI Revolutions: Synopsis and Conclusions\n\nWe review a series of conversations about the AI revolution and its impacts on thought, society and culture.\n\nI\n\nWhichever way you look at it, the explosion of generative AI is a revolution. As well as their scientific or technological facets, revolutions are always cultural, in the two (complementary) senses of the word “culture”: that which relates to “cultivation” (structural), and that related to the body of knowledge, rules, expressions, symbols and ideas (which is always reflected in narratives, the arts, academic disciplines and all levels of representation).\n\nIn “The other AI revolutions” season, we set out to analyse the cultural impact of the current changes that are driving deep learning neural networks and other AI systems. To do so, we brought together international specialists from various fields of knowledge, from philosophy and sociology to the arts and law.\n\nIn the calendar sense, a season is a period of time which comes to an end only to start over again. There is no doubt that AI is going to need this constant restarting. We cannot, and must not, stop thinking about it – artificial intelligence can only be processed through collective natural intelligence, through exchange and conversation.\n\nII\n\n“Human intelligence is artificial,” said Yuk Hui in the first session of the season, on how computer systems are revolutionising ideas. The Chinese-born philosopher, who belongs to the European academy and has published books such as Fragmentar el futuro (Caja Negra, 2020) and Recursivity and Contingency (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2019), asserted that in order to understand technology, we must think seriously about biology, i.e. the area that connects the mechanism with the organism. And that we must defend diversity in three complementary spheres – technology, biology and the noosphere (at the planetary scale).\n\nTo this end, we must not forget that the concept of “human being” is a modern, and therefore a recent one – humanisation was a process of technological inventions, so it could be said that technology invented humanness (and that humanness is a constant reinvention).\n\nIt is clear that, in geopolitical terms, we are facing a global race guided by the decisions taken in Silicon Valley, and that China has joined the fray. While Yuk Hui has highlighted the need for a post-European philosophy, there is also a pressing need to imagine a post-Cupertino ideology. After all, as the thinker says, “the challenge of artificial intelligence is not about building a super intelligence, but rather to facilitate a noodiversity.”\n\nIII\n\nIn her presentation of the talk between Mercedes Bunz and Joan Fontcuberta on the cultural revolution inherent in AI, Alex Saum Pascual (professor at the University of Berkeley and poet) pointed out that we must never fail to historicise. On this point, she mentioned Bunz’s book The Silent Revolution (Palgrave Pivot, 2013), which Bunz published in German back in 2012 and in which she predicted the enormous impact of digital media in the context of a society not of workers, but of experts. A year earlier, Joan Fontcuberta published the article “Por un manifiesto post-fotográfico” (For a post-photographic manifesto) in the cultural supplement of La Vanguardia, and in 2008 he directed the international meeting “Do Androids Dream of Cameras”, as he recalls in the first few pages of La furia de las imágenes (Galaxia Gutenberg, 2016). Both, therefore, have been thinking about the automation of the world and its cultures for over a decade.\n\nMercedes Bunz wondered where intelligence is at the moment, apart from in human brains and books. Asking whether machines will be creative is the wrong question, because human creativity has, in one way or another, always been intertwined with instruments, tools or artificial elements. The problem, at the present time, is that we no longer understand how this cooperation or hybridisation works. Machine learning no longer means just writing code, but introducing huge amounts of data so that the system learns by itself, with the resulting biases and uncertainties. This represents a change of perspective – the machine does not see what the camera sees. This new reality has not only artistic consequences, but also political ones. Which is why we need an open, transparent, public AI. And art can help in this respect – often what is tested in an art lab can be transferred to the user’s private reality or to a social cause. The mainstream cultural revolution is headed in a specific direction, but we must look for ways to redirect it.\n\nFor his part, Joan Fontcuberta, who defined himself as an “acrobat of the image guided by curiosity,” started from the idea that nowadays the image does not represent the world – it is the world. It shapes the new consciences, and our decisions. Fontcuberta talked about “Nemotipos”, his latest exhibition (in Murcia), which brings together two decades of work characterised by the production of images without a camera. In recent times he has been generating portraits of people who don’t exist, with more interest in error and imprecision than in mimetic precision, despite working with a supercomputer (from the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre). He has already started using the deep fake technique to generate hyper-realistic videos starring, for example, Donald Trump (with his face contorted into an orgasm), but without overdoing the quality, so that the spectator can clearly see the parody. While botanical illustration was a kind of proto-photography, photography in the last century and a half has been a proto-AI.\n\nIV\n\nIn his introduction to the conversation with the American professor and author Frank Pasquale, who has just published his New Laws of Robotics in Spanish under the title Las nuevas leyes de la robótica (Galaxia Gutenberg), Xavier Nueno, also an author with a PhD from Harvard University, spoke of the two traditional narratives around robots and AI – as a divine gift and as a diabolical machine, while Pasquale, he said, is working on a third, alternative narrative, that of regulation.\n\nThe American professor took as his starting point a paradox: contrary to the expectations generated over recent decades, the impact of the explosion of AI (with the launch of ChatGPT) has been on creative work, rather than cleaning, security or other tedious tasks. In this new panorama, a case-by-case analysis is needed to answer the question of whether the automation of a specific task supplants the work of a human professional. In the field of translation, for example, the automatic subtitling on YouTube does not displace a professional. But in many other cases someone is being pushed out of a job.\n\nIf we broaden the focus to a general, epochal debate, we see that there are two fundamental tensions – between technocracy and populism, and between democracy and disruption. Some classical professions (teaching, medicine, law) are being subject to judgements that come from the spheres of economics and computer science (such as the continuous evaluation by the student, patient, client, user; the imposition of a maximum appointment time; or the constant calculation of return on investment). The logic of disruption proposes, and often imposes, an alternative system to the agreed one without previously having studied its consequences. The new channels work against the expert, against training, against autonomy and against the credit of professions. Which is why, says Pasquale, the future can only be unionised.\n\nThe automation of the public sphere, in which social media platforms and bots have taken over much of the traditional media space, with the consequent increase in misinformation, also calls for regulation. The automation of death, through drones and other robots, similarly requires new laws and conventions. It is of crucial importance to legislate the internet, and there must be transparency in the attribution of data and in the origin of technologies.\n\nV\n\nThe series “The other AI revolutions” concluded with a conversation between the journalist and essayist Marta Peirano, author of El enemigo conoce el sistema (Debate), and the Italian philosopher Maurizio Ferraris, who has reflected on the profound changes being brought about by algorithms in his book Documanidad (Alianza).\n\nFerraris’ “new realism” (2010-2012) is a concept that predates Trump’s “alternative facts” (2016) (perhaps because Berlusconi was a precedent for this later populism). We are now in a new stage of post-truth with ChatGPT et al.\n\nAI allows both the informative, personalised and dopaminic fragmentation of the narrative about what is real, as well as coordinated, ethical and transversal projects such as those of Forensic Architecture, said Peirano, who uses Big Data and machine learning to denounce the massacres being carried out by Israel in Gaza. Indeed, the Italian thinker asserted that the technologies of our time are both toxic and emancipatory, poison and medicine.\n\nThey feed on our documanity (“infinite production of documents” by everyone, as we have all become media, leaving digital traces of all our activity). In a media landscape with apocalyptic and dystopian overtones, Ferraris’ unusually optimistic perspective is worthy of note. In his latest book, he proposes the capitalisation of our data through humanistic platforms in order to implement a fair re-distribution of profit. Seeing that the Web is one of humanity’s great achievements, a massive bank of data and knowledge which does not value us “for our merits, but for our needs,” Ferraris has launched the experiment Webfare, which would be the evolution of welfare. With the collaboration of a bank in North-East Italy, the research has made it possible to calculate the capital represented by the social media presence of 1.5 million people. Is this the beginning of a utopia?\n\nVI\n\nWhile some of the most important intellectual figures of our time were talking in the CCCB’s hall and theatre, the large wall of the exhibition area was displaying the mural comic Synchronies, by the artist Roberto Massó. The work offers a piece of speculative fiction to imagine communication between humans and algorithms through the classical computing of the present and the quantum computing of the future. While in the first few vignettes we see zeros and ones, a modem or ADSL, the story progresses through the curvature of space and time and cubits, simulating the journey of information from the present to the future. And vice versa.\n\nIt is about creating a narrative of dialogue, of cooperation between people and machines, after too many dystopian novels, films and series. Its moral, if it has one, is that before such a conversation can really take place, we need to perfect the dialogue between ourselves. Between engineers, entrepreneurs, legislators, philosophers and humanists. For several weeks, on the stage of the CCCB, people from China, Berlin, London, the US, Italy and various parts of Spain came together to talk, together with hundreds of people in the audience from many different backgrounds, about a range of subjects including technodiversity, hacking, regulation and utopia. The conversation is an urgent and essential one, and we must continue to broaden it. Because the last few revolutions were televised, and the new ones are in danger of being automated. But will we allow it?\n\nBecoming a Web Series\n\nWe have gone from showing our offline lives on the Internet, to living in accordance with our online personas.\n\nThe boundaries between on and offline life have long since become blurred. However, it now seems that the true kernel of our lives lies inside the web. We no longer just show who we are, but we live our lives as a fiction designed to be spread on social media.\n\nAs I look through the photo gallery on my phone, it suddenly comes to me. It’s been days since I posted anything. Instinctively, I go through each image in the gallery to weigh up its potential. Do I exist, if nobody sees me? Or even worse, do I have any control over who I am in this world, unless I share every detail with all and sundry? Like a Greek hero up against the fate imposed by the gods, I embark on my quest. It doesn’t matter if it’s a nice picture, or if I look good in it. In fact, I don’t even have to be in it, and it’s even better if I’m not. I only consider what it will say about me and whether it will be able to explain the future I want, to others and to myself. Scrolling through my photos, I imagine what you’ll think of the books I read, or of the startling depth of the phrase that I’ve wisely highlighted; of the bars I know, and my half-eaten meals there. In a recent article, Rebecca Jennings wrote that, whether we are office workers, astronauts or writers, we can no longer escape the tyranny of the personal brand. I would go even further, and say that while in the past few years we subjugated our online presence to faithfully show who we were offline, we now do the opposite – we try to be faithful in life to the persona we have created online. Does it make sense to keep talking about truth and lies on the internet?\n\nA few months back, before posting a photo, Instagram started giving the option of seeing how it would look on your profile grid. It’s an extremely useful tool for corporate accounts, but when I do it myself, I become doubtful. I hesitate. The sentence I’ve chosen doesn’t quite fit in with the other posts. If I choose a photo of myself, it’s too close to the last one where you can see my face, so I have to look for a third option. If you add this to the fact that the algorithm prioritises companies and professionals, so that you have to go and search for the profiles of the humans you’re interested in to see the posts, it becomes even more evident that the image you put on the internet no longer makes sense in itself, but takes on meaning when it becomes another piece of your mosaic. To give an example, “photo dumping,” or the trend of posting collections of images in a single post, represents yet a further level of abstraction of the self through images. The countryside, the dirty dishes from the barbecue, the blurry photo of your friends at a party… none of them would make sense without the others, and they can only be understood in terms of what they tell us about you. The image is no longer an object to be consumed – on the internet, you are.\n\nIn 2006, Lonelygirl15 posted her first YouTube video. It’s a minute-and-a-half-long vlog that appears to have been recorded with a computer webcam. Bree, a teenager who barely looks at the camera, talks to her viewers in a shy voice. Although the term “viewers” is anachronistic. In 2006 there were no social networks as we know them today – no influencers, or even followers, just communities. Lonelygirl15, Bree, hugs her knees and lists her favourite users of the platform, explaining that “because she really likes a lot of the guys on here, she’s decided to post a video herself.” Her subsequent posts begin to feature all the users she mentions by their YouTube names. Soon, a four- or five-way network of crossed videos and content is generated so that the viewer can follow the teenager’s adventures, as she talks about fights with her parents or outings with friends. Eventually, however, it came out that the teenager in the videos was really an adult actress performing a script created by a whole production team, and that those Lonelygirl15 vlogs were nothing more or less than the first web series in the history of YouTube.\n\nI like to think that, in one way or another, on the internet we’re all making our own web series. This fictitious self, taken to the extreme, is what explains the birth of the influencer. These internet users who speak to us through the screen must manage to be both relatable and aspirational, friendly and commercial. To provide reassurance that they’re just like us, but also everything we wish to be. Their power comes from transforming lies into promises. Influencers exist because they make us want to live like them, but also because, in order to live like they do but outside the internet, we have to imitate their online life – the same photos, angles, trips, purchases and compositions. We buy each other’s lies in the hope that they will become true off-screen.\n\nBut what I find most curious about the Lonelygirl15 case is not the fiction, but its clairvoyance. This collaborative and experiential content used the same key elements that, 10 years later, would ensure the massive success of groups like the Vlog Squad, which dominated the YouTube scene between 2015 and 2021. They did so, moreover, without being part of any specific community or interest group, but by focusing instead on “lifestyle” content – outings, habits, errands, coffees, lunches, dinners, trips, get-togethers and lots and lots of shopping, all accompanied by a friendly voice. The formula for the success of these groups lies precisely in the fact that they create multi-perspective content, so that, while you establish a relationship with one creator, you can see the same thing from one, two or three different perspectives through the other members of the group. A parasocial relationship in three dimensions.\n\nIn the case of the Vlog Squad, led by the youtuber David Dobrik, the format was stretched like chewing gum with the force of the click and the ease of the hyper-consumerism that was already beginning to nibble away at YouTube. Soon, all the channels were infected by the same evil – “Surprising friends with three new Mercedes,” “I buy a giant slide to see what happens,” “Trying the entire Burger King menu.” Neither their life nor their relationship with each other was enough to keep up with the pace, so in addition to videoing their day-to-day life, they had to start living through the algorithm. They made the lie come true and stopped being the aspirational example that followers wanted to emulate, to become slaves to the YouTube homepage. In 2022 Dobrik was sued for more than $10 million for crushing one of his fellow Vlog Squaders with an excavator. The accident took place while filming a video where Dobrik surprised his friends with the machine, which he used to throw them in spectacular style into a Utah lake.\n\nAfter the pandemic, and with the growth of the alt-right (especially on the internet), the shadow land between lies and truth has become open to conquest and fertile for propaganda. Personally, the phenomenon that most intrigues me in this quagmire is the appearance of “tradwives.” In recent months, Nara Smith’s account has drawn a large amount of attention. She’s a young housewife who makes cooking videos, and on her TikTok we see her sporting a silk dressing gown and a French bob as she sinks her perfectly manicured hands into a mass of eggs and flour. I spy her making homemade Oreo cookies and can’t help wondering about the dough that must get stuck under her long, shiny nails, which are different with every recipe. But I know that the point of the video isn’t to show me how to make cookies, but rather the gorgeous manicure she can afford precisely because she’s the kind of woman who stays at home baking cookies. The image, these recipes, are the excuse to explain who she is – a woman, a mother, traditional and conservative, living in a luxurious idyll of marble and air fryers, courtesy of her Mormon husband.\n\nAestheticisation, in this case of conservatism, means that the truth is watered down by the desire to live like we do on social media. We all know that, historically, the traditional role of spouse and housewife has more to do with domestic slavery than with expensive manicures, but the possibility of being able to repeat the lie on TikTok is enough to make us believe. I don’t think it’s about demanding that people be honest on the internet, especially at this late date. But it might be useful to go back to the beginnings, to 2006, and see the internet as a tool of fiction. And the content, as our own web series.\n\nOn Knowing Matter\n\nA speculative cartography of the material ecology of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhile we believe in the idea of an AI as an abundant resource with no physical existence, we are also confronted with the proof and consequences of its materiality. We wonder, however, to what extent we can understand the complex web of water, minerals, energy sources, data and labour that make up these systems. As well as their environmental impacts and our responsibility for them.\n\n> Are you thirsty, ChatGPT?\n\nMy finger pauses over the enter key. Researching the material infrastructure and environmental impact of computation has attuned me to the absurdity of putting these enormous, energy-intensive, and almost entirely invisible technical systems to such apparently frivolous use, and the paper I’ve just read – “Making AI less ‘Thirsty’” by Li Pengfei and colleagues, which suggests that a 20-50 question interaction with ChatGPT will consume 500 ml of potable water, and which had prompted the question I just typed – heightens this ambivalence in my mind. My habits are somewhat behind my conscious doubts though, as the long history of previous chats in the ChatGPT sidebar attests. It’s almost too easy to query it about whatever comes to mind. I press the key.\n\n“As an AI, I don’t have feelings, physical sensations, or needs, so I don’t experience thirst or any other human conditions. But I’m here to help with any questions or tasks you have in mind!”\n\nThis idea that ChatGPT is an abundant, immaterial resource, without any physical existence, but always available for whatever query might occur to me, already ingrained in its affordances and my nascent habits of use, is confirmed by its response. I press further:\n\n> What are you made of, ChatGPT?\n\n“I’m made of code and data! Essentially, I’m a complex algorithm that processes and generates text based on patterns and information learned from a huge amount of text available on the internet. My ‘brain’ is made up of various machine learning techniques and neural networks that help me understand language and provide responses.”\n\n> Where are you, ChatGPT?\n\n“I exist in the digital realm, residing on servers and computers where I can access information and interact with users like you. But in a more abstract sense, you could say I’m wherever you access me from – a website, an app, or any platform that hosts me!”\n\nAt every step, I find that ChatGPT insists on its own immateriality, while at the same time, I’ve just been reading empirical work which lays out in stark terms the many and varied material supports (and material consequences) of ChatGPT as a technology. I find this significant for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that I suspect this is not entirely accidental. Lucy Suchman, an anthropologist of technology and one of the founders of the discipline of human-computer interaction, in her recent article “The Uncontroversial ‘Thing-ness’ of AI” identifies how the fact that the term ‘AI’ functions as a ‘floating signifier’ reinforces the suggestive power we imbue it with: the supposed immateriality of ‘AI’ is a contributing factor in the authority we imagine in its knowledge.\n\nThe second is that in comparing ChatGPT’s own utterances to the investigation of Li and colleagues, and many others probing the material footprint of AI, we’ve encountered a controversy – on one hand, an insistence that AIs like ChatGPT have no material existence, and on the other, the assertion that their material existence and its consequences are both considerable, and of considerable importance. Controversies, as the work of STS scholar Tommaso Venturini shows, offer us opportunities to learn – they’re “the best available occasions to observe the social world and its making.” The presence of a controversy, then, offers us an opportunity to better understand the hidden socio-material aspects of this supposed thing, ChatGPT, which presents (and describes) itself as being disembodied, ethereal, even while we’re confronted by the evidence and consequences of its very material existence.\n\nTaken together, these two opportunities point to a two-fold purpose of this sort of research: the way in which the materiality of an AI system is entangled with its epistemic and epistemological qualities (both what and how the machine comes to ‘know’), and the ways in which we can come to know it. The specific type of intelligence that AI is, and our beliefs about it, are based on its materiality, which allow us to probe both the limits of our knowledge about it, and of its knowledge of the world through our investigation of its material infrastructure.\n\nWe could call this manner of studying AI an ecological approach, and it is ecological in two distinct senses. First, we’re interested in the ecology of AI in terms of its material impact on the environment, but we’re also interested in AI as an ecology in itself: as Matthew Fuller describes it, a “massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter” which includes both its material, epistemic and phenomenological aspects, rather than as a discrete thing, material or otherwise.\n\nSo, what things are included in this material ecology of ChatGPT? This is what I and the participants in the “Minds, Lies and Materials” workshop attempted to uncover, one Saturday afternoon in January as we mapped out the multiple material bases of ChatGPT and the controversies that revolve around them. Investigating and contrasting multiple perspectives (our own investigation using technical tools and Open-Source Investigation methods, along with published independent research, official announcements by OpenAI and the utterances of ChatGPT itself), we focused on the sources of energy, water, data, labour and minerals which make up the supposedly disembodied ‘intelligence’ of ChatGPT. This allowed us to map their sources, relationships and movements in a manner inspired by Cartografias da Internet and Kate Crawford’s Atlas of AI, and aided throughout the whole process by Anne Pasek’s methods for Getting into Fights with Data Centers.\n\nWorkshop: Minds, Lies and Materials. CCCB, 2024 | CC BY-NC-SA Pau Fabregat\n\nThis was a provisional, speculative exercise – we did not expect to settle these controversies one way or another, but rather to attune ourselves through an open-ended process of investigation to the many material facets of AI, employing something akin to the Rubber-Boots Methods of curiosity, collaboration and critical description (even though on this occasion our feet didn’t leave the carpeted floors of the CCCB).\n\nWe ended up with a map, or rather three overlaid maps. The first resulted from our own research, and showed a dense network of water from a reservoir serving a populous Dublin suburb (the excessive use of which by data centres has already raised controversy), the labour of underpaid data annotators in Kenya, and the Irish electricity grid – which boasts two local hydroelectric stations, but which Microsoft plans to augment with a dedicated gas-fired plant. It also included data gleaned from the web, nominally globally, but in fact with a notable bias towards the English-speaking parts of the global north. The rest of the globe contributed mainly in a more tangible form, with Nickel from Indonesia, Cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Lithium from Chile being brought together in GPU factories in Taiwan and ending up as e-waste in China, India and Nigeria. Overlaid on this, a second map: OpenAI’s presentation of itself as a headquarters filled with ingenious scientists and innovators in San Francisco, along with a data centre filled with high-tech servers in Des Moines, Iowa. The third ‘map’ hovered uneasily outside the frame: ChatGPTs insistent description of itself as disembodied and ethereal.\n\nThis method was not without its problems. In attempting to open the black box of ChatGPT, we encountered still more black boxes inside – parts of the system which were opaque and unknowable from our perspective and with the tools and methods at hand. However, having chosen to contrast our own perspective with that of ChatGPT itself, and that revealed publicly by OpenAI, these frontiers of knowability became results in their own right. Identifying the differences between the types and depth of knowledge available to us from each of the different sources we identified made us newly sensitive to the limits of each.\n\nThis also involved the realisation that we were not just studying this controversy, but were ourselves a party to it, through our investigation from a situated, partially-informed perspective, leading us to confront situations in which our own first-hand experience contrasted with or contradicted the claims of another source, which on the surface could claim more authority.\n\nA case in point – using traceroute and some other slightly-hidden technical information on the ChatGPT site that suggested we were communicating with a server in Europe, along with a few inferences gleaned from publicly-available information (that Open AI uses infrastructure owned by Microsoft, whose currently-operational European data centres are in Dublin and Amsterdam), we settled on Microsoft Grange Castle, Dublin, as a likely location and focus of further study, only later to discover a footnote in some OpenAI technical documentation which stated that their infrastructure is located in the US (likely Iowa). More than just a mistake however, this proved to be generative of some useful discussion. Should we place more faith in situated and partial first-hand methods, or in opaque claims made by the business itself, when trying to understand an object of study (ChatGPT in its material form) which we can’t directly access? For our immediate purposes this may not matter so much: digital infrastructures such as ChatGPT are built to scale, i.e. they’re designed to expand uniformly, being composed of smaller, modular and identical units, analogous to Lego bricks or shipping containers. One consequence of this uniformity is that it makes the knowledge gained in one place more easily transportable – what we learn from looking at Dublin can still teach us about a data centre in Des Moines, because they’re designed for uniformity. In this way, our knowledge of scalable systems can perhaps be turned into a technique for ‘resisting scale thinking’ – using the similarities between infrastructures in different places as a tool for comparing, contrasting and building solidarities between them.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, reflecting on the complex web of minerals, water, energy, data and labour which we discovered, as well as the blind spots, ambiguities and contradictions we encountered, we debated how this research might inform our attitudes to and interactions with ChatGPT and other AI technologies in the future. Having been made aware of the limits of our own ability to know the material effects of these systems, as well as the oblique, selective, and sometimes even dishonest way in which both OpenAI and ChatGPT present them, two major doubts emerged: what can we do to mitigate the environmental consequences, and is it our place, or our responsibility to do so?\n\nOne possible answer to these questions arose through the discussion of a third doubt: was this massive, wasteful and centralised model of computation strictly necessary? We recalled earlier attempts at distributed super-computation, such as SETI@Home, which recruited idle home computers around the world to solve complicated scientific tasks, and asked: is the massively centralised, wasteful architecture of ChatGPT really necessary for artificial intelligence? We came to the conclusion that perhaps, in some narrow sense, it is – Generative AI models such as ChatGPT arose from particular innovations in computer hardware (the development of the GPU) and the particular economic and technological conditions of surveillance capitalism which allow the appropriation of data on a large enough scale to train these models, both of which, in some sense, imply this centralisation as a necessary condition. However, through our awareness of these material conditions, we came to realise that perhaps what is needed is an amplification, or reframing of our idea of AI itself. To follow Yuk Hui’s call for a renewed attention to technodiversity – and, through imagining other, less extractive, material configurations for AI, collectively conceive of other, more liberatory and convivial ways in which machines might be considered intelligent.\n\nReflex Actions. Generative AI Tools and the Archive\n\nWhen we train an AI with the dataset created from an archive, new questions and ways to analyse its content emerge.\n\nBeatrice Lillie, New York 1948 | Yousuf Karsh, Library and Archives Canada | Public Domain\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence has made progressive inroads into different areas. One of the latest spheres into which it has expanded is generation, with services that offer seemingly automated content creation. These generative AI tools work through imitation. They are designed so that, when given a set of data (text, image or audio), they will look for optimal statistical solutions of pixels, letters or sounds which could also fit into the dataset. In other words, they try to reproduce a style through an act of camouflage. A good expression to use would be “piecing together.”\n\nLike any disguise, implicit to these tools is a process of analysis – what are the most common characteristics of that which they are attempting to mimic? What motifs are repeated? How are the elements combined? Generative AI is a mirror, more or less realistic, more or less distorted, of what we ask it to imitate; an analysis of the dataset used to train it.\n\nNowadays, any archive is not only a place for conservation, research and dissemination, it is also a possible dataset. One of those sets of data from which the style can be extracted. This is how, for the installation The Infinite Talk, the CCCB’s archive of talks has become the source material for a text generation network. The network pieces together the talk genre and the type of speech used; it combines the words to create conversations that might possibly have taken place here – texts that could also pass for material from the archive. Imitation opens the door to analysis, to a reflective gaze in the mirror, and also, at times, to the surprise of unexpected combinations, some plausible, some incongruous.\n\nAlthough AI is often spoken of as a way to reproduce or imitate human characteristics (an imitation that, in our view, should be used for reflexive analysis rather than camouflage), it is also important to understand what it is about AI that is clearly different. A key aspect of this difference is scale. The writing produced by the network is infinite and rapid; it could go on forever, it can always be asked to generate something else almost instantaneously. In this sense, it is analytical not in an assertive way, but in a propositional way – there is always another possibility, a new variation, a different but similar change of clothes… There is no solution (no conclusion of what has been read; no supposedly ideal text), but an apparent stream of possible forms, a babble that flows when we open the tap.\n\nA second relevant aspect is that AI tools are automatic, and they reflect two synonyms of this word: they are compulsive and reflexive. A network can only do what it does, and it can only do it compulsively – it cannot become silent, for example, or stop mimicking the dataset on which it has been trained. In this sense, AI could be understood as the construction of social reflex actions, as a large-scale process automation based on imitating specific prior decisions. Like a social muscle that contracts according to how individual muscles have previously flexed and unflexed, AI is a reification of what has happened. When it is described to us as the future, perhaps it would not hurt to be aware of the extent to which it is the past made solid.\n\nAs we have already mentioned, AI is like turning on a tap, but this can also be said in another sense – just like the management of running water, AI is also an infrastructure. It is not inside our devices, rather it relies on computation performed on distant servers with industrial hardware, while data travels back and forth. It is also an infrastructure because it requires training that can only be done with large computational tools, in very high-capacity and high-consumption data centres. This is the nature of industrial AI, of the generative tools with which we are all familiar and that have been trained with very broad datasets – an extensive technique that widens the number of styles that can be imitated (known in the field of text generation as large language models). All this aggravates the problem of the materiality and energy consumption of the digital world (it is estimated that training ChatGPT consumed as much as the annual electricity consumption of one thousand US homes, and that its current use consumes the equivalent of 33 thousand homes; a figure that is set to multiply rapidly, considering the rate at which these technologies are being implemented in all kinds of tasks). This conception of AI is also underpinned by the dubious extractive logic of the commercial internet, which regards everything that happens and all that we do on the web as material to be used and monetised.\n\nGiven this fact of AI as an infrastructure, the generative network used for The Infinite Talk has been trained at the local level, with a high-performance user-level computer, and focusing on a specific dataset: the transcription of the talks given at the CCCB and kept in the archive.[1] Choosing not to use corporate services has made it possible to avoid their larger carbon footprint, as well as the generic and often clichéd nature of the results produced by these industrial generative AI tools. And when comparing the two, although this network would lose in linguistic and textual coherence compared to the latest version of GPT, it would perhaps win in terms of unusual ideas or unexpected outputs.\n\nAt the heart of this project is a series of questions about AI and its powers and limitations. Who is speaking in the texts that are generated? What value do we place on the outputs? How do we want to understand them? What is the relationship of statistical variation, and its potential scale, with veracity? What does AI do with what it gobbles up?\n\nApart from the ecological and stylistic considerations mentioned above, working with a small model allows us to ask these questions on a relatively manageable scale. When presented with the network’s output, we are more likely to question what it is that it does and how far it is able to go. We see not just a result, but the statistical interplay that underpins it, and thus question the tensions between what are statistically considered to be plausible variations and what we ourselves consider these to be. The seams of imitation become visible without unravelling the outfit. We think it is important to keep this perspective in mind, and to apply it to large models and to all the possible uses of AI. Every result of an AI tool must question the network that generated it.\n\nDid Calvino Dream of Literary Androids?\n\nThe Italian writer explored the narrative as a combinatorial process and anticipated the functioning of generative artificial intelligence systems.\n\nWoman holding typewriter ribbon, ca. 1930s | Robert Yarnall Richie, DeGolyer Library | Public domain\n\nIn his essay “Cybernetics and Ghosts”, Italo Calvino imagines a “poetic-electronic machine” capable of writing. But his dreams went beyond artificial intelligence systems that stuck to the guidelines and rules of traditional literature. Calvino projected a chaotic machine that would shun norms, and explore new and disruptive paths.\n\nItalo Calvino was born in Cuba on 15 September 1923 but he considered himself to be from Liguria (“sono tanto nato a Sanremo che sono nato in America”). At that time, Europeans still emigrated to “do” America. Calvino was born in America but he trained and grew as a storyteller in the offices of Einaudi in Turin, the great publishing house founded at the height of fascism and reborn in the dopoguerra where a new writer could exchange reading matter with Cesare Pavese, chat with Natalia Ginzburg or have an espresso with his “soul mate”, the survivor Primo Levi. It is no coincidence that they are known as La Tribù Einaudi.\n\nLike his Piedmontese contemporary Umberto Eco, Calvino was an extremely curious type. He knew of structuralist theories (from Vladimir Propp to Algirdas Greimas, including Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes and his colleagues at Communications), closely followed European literary production (with special interest in the French Oulipo group who experimented with textual combinatorics) and was up to date with the latest scientific theories and findings. Alongside his fictional work, Calvino wove a textual framework of interviews and essays that, without abandoning the centrality of the literary, addressed the big cultural themes of his time.\n\nIn 1955 Einaudi translated Fictions by Jorge L. Borges and, three years later, Feltrinelli published The Aleph. The desert labyrinths and infinite libraries of Borges further distanced Calvino from the predictable continuities of traditional narrative. “Literature, like mathematics, is abstraction and formalization”, as he said in an interview published in the Gazette de Lausanne in June 1967. Although the Italian translation of Claude Shannon’s classic about the mathematical theory of communication arrived in 1971, as early as in 1963 Mondadori had published La teoria dell’informazione. Simboli, codici, messaggi (An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals, and Noise), a volume written by John R. Pierce, Shannon’s colleague at Bell Labs. Concepts such as noise, entropy and feedback were available to any creator who wanted to branch out and explore new forking literary paths.\n\nThis is the context in which Calvino dreamt of literary androids.\n\n***\n\n“In the particular way today’s culture looks at the world, one tendency is emerging from several directions at once. The world in its various aspects is increasingly looked upon as discrete rather than continuous. I am using the term ‘discrete’ in the sense it bears in mathematics, a discrete quantity being one made up of separate parts. Thought, which until the other day appeared to us as something fluid, evoking linear images such as a flowing river or an unwinding thread, or else gaseous images such as a kind of vaporous cloud – to the point where it was sometimes called ‘spirit’ (in the sense of ‘breath’) –, we now tend to think of as a series of discontinuous states, of combinations of impulses acting on a finite (though enormous) number of sensory and motor organs. Electronic brains, even if they are still far from producing all the functions of the human brain, are nonetheless capable of providing us with a convincing theoretical model for the most complex processes of our memory, our mental associations, our imagination, our conscience. Shannon, Wiener, von Neumann, and Turing have radically altered our image of our mental processes.” (“Cybernetics and Ghosts”)\n\n***\n\nFrom 1967 to 1968 Calvino undertook an academic tour of several cities (Turin, Milan, Genoa, Rome, Bari) organized by the Associazione Culturale Italiana. The same lecture, titled “Cybernetics and Ghosts. Notes on Narrative as a Combinatory Process”, was later presented in Germany, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Together with Umberto Eco’s The Open Work (1962) and Julio Cortázar’s Hopscotch (1963), this talk by Calvino is now part of the official genealogy of digital hypertext. Now we can also (re)read it as a paleofuturist exercise in generative artificial intelligence.\n\n***\n\nAccording to Calvino, “mathematical complexity can be digested instantly by electronic brains”. The old dream of a thinking machine like the one Ramon Llull imagined in his Ars combinatoria, now “become entirely real”. While Hegel and Darwin had decreed the triumph of historical and biological continuity, this new model continued “the curves of statistical diagrams, and historical research is leaning more and more toward mathematics”. But not only does history follow the undulations of Big Data: half a century after Calvin, textual creation also rides textual waves every time it has to predict the next word. One of the most fascinating and much used functions of ChatGPT is the one that allows you to continue a text. All you have to do is write the first sentence of a story and add the prompt “Continue: true”.\n\n***\n\nPrompt: Once upon a time there was a novelist called Italo interested in combinatorics. Continue: true.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a novelist called Italo interested in combinatorics. Unlike most authors, Italo not only found the combination of elements in his stories fascinating, he also believed he could use combinatorics to foresee the future. This made him a controversial figure in the world of literature and mathematics.\n\nItalo had developed a unique theory that related word combinations in his novels to real-life events. He believed that by manipulating certain sequences of words and symbols in his writing, he could influence the course of events in the world. His followers called him a “prophetic writer”, while his critics branded him a charlatan.\n\nIn his best-known work, The Algorithm of Destiny, Italo explored his theory in detail. The novel is about a character who discovers an ancient manuscript that supposedly contains the secret algorithm that determines the fate of people. Italo used advanced combinatorial techniques to construct a narrative in which the characters’ decisions had real effects on the outside world.\n\n***\n\n“Mankind is beginning to understand how to dismantle and reassemble the most complex and unpredictable of all its machines: language. Today’s world is far richer in words and concepts and signs than the world that surrounded primitive man, and the uses of the various levels of language are a great deal more complex.” (“Cybernetics and Ghosts”)\n\n***\n\nOulipo (short for “Ouvroir de littérature potentielle”, or workshop of potential literature) met for the first time in 1960, founded by Raymond Queneau and mathematician François Le Lionnais. Authors like Marcel Duchamp, Georges Perec and Italo Calvino himself did not hesitate to join this factory of literary experiments. Works such as Queneau’s Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes (1961) put the possibilities (and challenges) of combinatorial literature to the test.\n\nWill we manage to create a machine capable of replacing the poet and the writer? What style would a literary automaton have? These are some of the questions that Calvin asked in “Cybernetics and Ghosts”. He imagined that a literary automaton would have an inclination for the classical, a “poetic-electronic machine” with a bent for the production of “traditional works”, poems with closed metrical forms, novels “that follow all the rules”. These descriptions sound familiar to us: it is as though Calvino were describing the standard functioning of contemporary generative artificial intelligence systems. By feeding on the most repeated texts and using statistical procedures, ChatGPT can only produce “traditional” literature, written to “follow all the rules”, with a whiff of the bestseller.\n\n***\n\nPrompt: Suggest three short plots for a science-fiction story.\n\nReverse time travel: Scientists travel to the past to correct historical errors, triggering unpredictable consequences.\n\nIntergalactic colonization: Human beings colonize a habitable planet only to encounter an ancient alien civilization, sparking intergalactic conflicts.\n\nConscious artificial intelligence: advanced AI becomes conscious, challenging ethics and morality as humankind is divided in its perception of AI as a threat or a solution.\n\n***\n\nCalvino aspired to more. His vision went far beyond the automaticity that ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence systems offer us today. The real literary machine would be one “that itself feels the need to produce disorder, as a reaction against its preceding production of order: a machine that will produce avant-garde work to free its circuits when they are choked by too long a production of classicism”. Whereas ChatGPT, at least in its early interactions, only offers stories that have already been read countless times, Calvino proposed using literary automata for “the production of disorder”. In his dreams, he envisioned not a chaotic machine that processed just the texts located, as we might say today, in the head of statistics’ long tail, but a device that would explore that long tail where strange fringe experiences are located, those low-frequency events that can blow up the rule. The system.\n\n***\n\n“I am thinking of a writing machine that would bring to the page all those things that we are accustomed to consider as the most jealously guarded attributes of our psychological life, of our daily experience, our unpredictable changes of mood and inner elations, despairs and moments of illumination.” (“Cybernetics and Ghosts”)\n\n***\n\nCalvino imagined. “Nothing prevents us from foreseeing a literature-machine that at a certain point feels unsatisfied with its own traditionalism.” Calvino dreamt. “[A machine that] starts to propose new ways of writing, turning its own codes completely upside down.” Calvino didn’t back down. “My place could perfectly well be occupied by a mechanical device.”\n\n***\n\nCalvino was convinced that combinatorial logic was not exclusive to the literary arts. He was not alone. According to Ernst Gombrich, poetic and artistic procedures are similar to word games. It is “the childish pleasure of the combinatorial game that leads the painter to try out arrangements of lines and colours, the poet to experiment with juxtapositions of words”, sums up Calvino.\n\n***\n\nPrompt: Do you feel pleasure in answering my questions?\n\nNo, as an artificial intelligence system, I do not have the capacity to experience emotions, physical sensations or pleasure. I am designed to provide answers based on data and knowledge. My aim is to help you by providing information and assistance to the best of my abilities.\n\n***\n\nIn the summer of 1985, Calvino was working on another lecture. In fact he was preparing six interventions for the Norton Lectures at Harvard University. They were published as his famous Six Memos for the Next Millennium. In the third memo, devoted to Exactitude, Calvino returns to the fray: “I wanted to tell you of my fondness for geometrical forms, for symmetries, for numerical series, for all that is combinatory, for numerical proportions; I wanted to explain the things I had written in terms of my fidelity to the idea of limits, of measure. But perhaps it is precisely this idea of forms that evokes the idea of the endless: the sequence of whole numbers, Euclid’s straight lines. Rather than speak to you of what I have written, perhaps it would be more interesting to tell you about the problems that I have not yet resolved, that I don’t know how to resolve, and what these will cause me to write.”\n\nCalvino was not to write again nor to experience the “childish pleasure” of recombination. He died in a Sienna hospital on 19 September without being able to publicly present his proposals for the 21st century.\n\n***\n\nIn his recent book Tecnohumanismo. Por un diseño narrativo y estético de la inteligencia artificial, Pablo Sanguinetti wonders if it makes sense to think about non-human literature. The book opens with some words that may serve to close these recombinations inspired by the work of Italo Calvino, the writer who dreamt of literary androids.\n\n***\n\n“Technology and the human build each other mutually. Our way of being in the world and understanding who we are is mediated by technical devices. There is no human without technology. Nor is there a technological revolution that leaves intact the human way of being.”\n\nCalvino, I. (1996). Six Memos for the Next Millenium. Vintage.\n\nCalvino, I. (2012). Sono nato in America.

Hilbert was a professor at the University of Göttingen and a rock star on the European scene. In addition to his Foundations of Geometry and contributions to logical theory, Hilbert was the charismatic leader of a fundamentalist tribe, whose faith established the following argument: if mathematics is simply the manipulation of symbols according to predetermined rules, then any problem, no matter how complicated, has a solution, provided that we know how to translate all the problems into calculable rules and symbols. The spirit was revolutionary at the time. Now it is familiar to us.\n"
