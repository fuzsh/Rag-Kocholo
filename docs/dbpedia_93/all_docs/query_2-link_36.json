Mykel proved to me he doesn’t have a clue in your Sept. 1990 issue. I like to hear thought-out, educated opinions, but hearing someone base AA when they really know nothing about it makes me think that it’s just bullshit not worth wast¬ ing ink over. Obviously Mykel knows nothing about alcoholism. It is a disease, genetically inher¬ ited. Mykel thinks that his alcoholic friends can \"just drink less. No meetings. Just stop. Dry out for a while. Then drink like normal people: a beer or two every day and then get smashed to oblivion on weekends.” (That’s normal?) Anyway, I am a recovering alco¬ holic and a member of AA, and believe me, I’ve tried to drink normally (basically just at parties, on weekends, etc.) — I think almost every alcoholic has. I just doesn’t work that way. Even if an alcoholic can control his/her drinking for a while, eventually they will wind up where they were before: mentally, physi¬ cally, and emotionally fucked. I don’t want to live that way. That’s why I and millions of others have joined AA. And it makes a big difference. Mykel also says: “They feed you some kind of god or being greater than oneself mumbo jumbo.’’Nobody pushes anything on anyone in AA. People choose whatto believe and what not to. It seems to keep more people sober when they feel that they’re not alone in theirfight, no matter what. It is VERY hard to do it alone; for me, it is an impossibil¬ ity. Willpower doesn't cut it —this is not a matter of willpower, it is a matter of addiction. When an alcoholic hits a mental, physi¬ cal or emotional bottom, he or she is usually willing to try anything. AA works for a lot of people. It doesn’t work for some. That’s life. Mykel also expresses some shock that his alcoholic friends are only — gasp! — 25 years old. well, suprise! There’s no age limit on alcoholism, you just have to be able to reach the liquor cabinet, or find your older sibling’s stash, or shoulder tap for beer after that junior high school dance, just enough to trigger the alcoholic inside. I'm 15 years old. I drank from the time I was 10 until almost my 15th birthday. Now I’ve got almost a year sober. There are young alcoholics every¬ where, and the numbers are increasing. Alcoholism is an inherited disease, but nobody MADE me drink. I don’t blame soci¬ ety, or my ancestors, or anybody but myself for my disease. I made the decision to drink. It was my choice 100%. So, Mykel, your big deal about respon¬ sibility is way off base as far as I’m con¬ cerned. I take full responsibility for my life and my actions. NOBODY EVER MAKES MY CHOICES FOR ME. I don't drink or use drugs because I don’t want to make my life like it was. I would love to be \"society’s victim” and have everyone else take care of me and the things that I've done. But I’m not society’s victim and I know. All of my sober friends that i've talked to agree. / Proof that you’re really full of shit hit me when I continued reading to find the state¬ ment: “If you’re an alcoholic, of course you can’t control your drinking. Alcoholics can’t.” Gee, I could have sworn about 4 paragraphs ago you gave your alcoholicfriends the won¬ derful “remedy” of just drying out, then pro¬ ceeding to alcohol-induced oblivion... Your criticism of various laws caught my attention, too. You’re right about the helmet laws — people shouldnave a right to spill their heads all overthe roads if they want to. And people could ask that guy to put out his cigarette. The point is drunk drivers kill people every day. Second-hand smoke kills thousands of people every year. Once you step into that car even after a couple of beers, you endanger the lives of everyone around you. Once you light up you pollute the lungs of everyone within breathing distance. And that, my misguided friend, is a perfect ex¬ ample of the principle you hate of letting people choose for you. So, bro, wise up and get your shit straight before you spew it all over an other¬ wise cool mag. I’d like to hear any other opinions on AA, or anything else, for that matter, so write, everybody! Sam Ott/ 1112 Monterey Vista Way/ Encinitias, CA 92024 MRR & Readers, Continuing \"Days Of Our Hardcore Lives,” I’d like to comment on some recent stuff. First Michael Broyles, in #89, brought up a point about my name (guess his Mom taught him not to use those \"cuss words”). Sit down for a minute guy, and try and distin¬ guish between the real issues and superficial nothings. If you’re really concerned about their issues, great, that shouldn’t be affected by the signature at the end of the letter. I don’t expect you to \"follow me,” I don’t want people to like me for my name, or to like me at all for that matter and I don't need to be left alone. I write about what I feel is important and I’ve gotten much positive feedback, so I guess there are others out there who feel similarly. Read into the issues and feel free to ignore me. This isn’t a popularity contest and I’m not running for some office. I’ll use whatever name I want to and it matters not at all. Out of 5 billion humans, I am only one. Next, Anthony Scardigno, in #90. You've had a tough life (just Tike everyone else), so now you make excuses and leach onto whatever scene can make you feel like \"a man.” Pathetic child. To quote Straight Ahead, \"You know everything about nothing. You have no idea. None.” Is anti-homophobia becoming a trend? GOOD! I’ll take a non-judgmental attitude over your violent, macho bullshit anyday. This “faggot” supported the NY HC scene for 5 years with his fanzine, Bullshit Monthly, and helped out a lot of NY HC bands, as well as bands all overthe U.S., by starting the All- Ages, low-door-price HC matinees at ABC- NO-RIO, a club where violence and egotisti¬ cal attitudes are not welcome. I guess us “Fags” can be HARD too , huh? I don’t need to prove anything to you, or act “old-school,” unlike your hero Steve Martin, who tells us every sentence, how long he’s been in the scene, all the bands he’s been in... I don’t care if you’ve been in the scene 2 weeks or 10 years, who the fuck are you to judge me? Violent dicks are one reason why CBGB’S and so many other clubs stopped doing HC shows (too many ambulances, Einstein). Violence is dumb and you’re the proof, grow up! And sorry, Tony, SICK OF IT ALL and KILLING TIME, still work day jobs. Hate to disillusion your fantasy hero worship. Oh, and dig those new hardline EPs. Lovely Sean, tecnni-color violence. Has the edge gone dumb? To the John Brown AKC: If ypu use a capital “F” for French, and \"P”for Polish, obviously you should use a capitol \"C”for Canadian. Simple, huh? Good, then don’t use a capital “B” for Black if your not using a capital “W” for White. I'm completely Anti-Racist, but your politically correct gram¬ mar doesn’t prove anything, it just makes you see out of it. To the anti-Mykel Board people: an¬ noying isn’t he? Every once in awhile, though, he brings up a good point. But, anyway, life moves on. I left NY in early September to go hitchiking, and I’ve been around much of this country, which is very beautiful — deserts, mountains, forests, cornfields, small towns, big cities... wow. Whenever you get the chance, see as much of it as possible. Air¬ planes suck eggs. If you’ve written me, I’ll write back, but it takes some time for my mail to be for¬ warded. Sorry for the delays, please use the below address for all correspondence & GO! orders. Don’t write to the old GO! address of EVACUATE RECORDS. We played our last show, by the way, Aug. 25th, 1990, at ABC-NO-RIO. Our3rd 7” EP, \"Why Suffer?” Should be out on FORE¬ FRONT RECORDS (order from their advert in this issue). We’d like to thank everyone who helped us out on our summer tour with BAD TRIP. Booking us, feeding us, sheltering us, talking to us, coming to see us. We really appreci¬ ated everything and hope you enjoyed it all. Take care. Mike Bullshit c/o Esneider/80-50 Baxter Ave #125/Elmhurst, NY 11373 P.S. One last point. ABC-NO-RIO is a club, not an ideology. Not everyone there agrees with San McPheeters or Dave Koeing (lots of times I know I don’t). It’s a club, dammit, Tony, and you don’t have to kiss anyone’s ass or change your hairstyle to come down and hang out. You just can't be a dick and act tough and start fights. Dear MRR, Hellothis is Paul from NJ/PA Breakforth and Unite fanzine, writing with afew thoughts to share. First off, I would like to comment on Sam Shiftman's article in issue #89. As a participant in the NJ hardcore scene for quite some time, as well as living in the same area as Sam, I feel qualified to speak about his comments. Yes Sam, you did at one time do a lot for the scene in the form of shows, but that was then and this is now. I went to most of the shows you did, but also recall that several were canceled and it was never your fault. Personally I am tired of hearing you talk about how much you've done, now great your sacrifices are, and especially your ponderings on why PED was so persecuted. Maybe because we were all SICK of hearing you talk about them. But now, long after their demise you still babble on about how wonderful they are and how aside from your monumental efforts no one does anything for the scene. As stated, Sam's contributions were all well and good but have been over and done for more than a year. And let’s be honest here, Sammy, you are far from the selfless burden carrier of hardcore you try to make yourself out to be. I can see two flyers here in my room that say “Sam Shiftman presents” and recall that at these shows you made no small deal about telling the audience you put on the show, and don’t fight because you’ll get in trouble. Finally you have the nerve to say Randy Ellis (of Trenton’s City Garden's, aclub whose average door price is $10 for four bands) is the \"only promoter who still does shows almost anywhere on the East Coast.” If you ever bothered to read MRR other than in the sections you talk, you would find the book your own tour section. There you would see listed a place called ABC-No-Rio in NY which is about a whopping 30 minutes from you by train. Ever been there Sam? They do hardcore matinees every Saturday, featuring 4-6 bands for $4-5. But of course you don’t know this because you are too busy lamenting the fact that no one appreciates you to actually visit such places. Contrary to what you think, you don’t have to Travel 2,000 miles to cite an example” of a decent place for shows. It’s time to step out of the past Sam, and open your eyes instead of running at the mouth. Second, some of you may remember me writing in awhile back about SCHISM Records. Apparently John Porcell and Alex Brown (of Judge and Gorilla Biscuits) don’t botherto read things like MRR because ONE YEAR and 8 MONTHS later I have yet to receive my order. I am through begging for my stuff. John and Alex are simply money- hungry scum who care nothing for other people, except when they can exploit them. If you are still supporting these bands, think about the fact that they have ripped off count¬ less of dozens (I know of about 6 people personally) and you can bet that when the cash is gone in HC, they’ll be as well. Thanks for the time, and I welcome all com¬ ments. Paul/ Breakforth (school address)/ 927 Madison Ave/Apt #21/Scranton, PA 18510 Maximum Rock’N’Roll Obviously Larry Livermore has no fucking idea who I am or what I'm all about. Comparing what I do as merely shock value in his column (Oct. isse) only shows his ignorance and lack of knowledge concerning me. My shows are complete reality. The only realities that I fucking know. For me, it's a therapeutic release, revenge and to test the boundaries, and to test all boundaries of life and law at my cost. If it seems shocking, that’s because my life has been lived well past the extreme excelleration known to mortal mankind and that my demons are fierce. What I do comes from my mind like a machine gun. With my body being the bullets and anyone in my way a target. I’m not trying to be funny, amusing or shocking Mr. Livermore and I certainly don’t need you or anybody else to feel sorry for me, because I can take care of myself in any situation. You also mention originality. A lot of people of people come along and start shit that they can’tfinish. I’m heretotogetthejobdone. I’m the annihilator. When I’m released you will see me and feel it. The mission will continue. If you want to talk shock Livermore, GWAR and afewothers come to mind. There is a big difference. They will entertain you and I will fuck you up. GG Allin/206045/Adrian Ml Prison Facility Dear MRR and readers, It seems to me that MRR is getting pretty negative. I don’t know how many col¬ umns I’ve read that slag the punk scene. The music sucks now, the unity isn’t there, etc. etc. Well maybe I'm just young and naive, but I think that’s bullshit! there are tons of great bands out there. Every punk show I’ve seen has been great. Fuck it, everything about it is great!!! Fuck the bands like Social Distortion who have apparently grown too cool to stick to the underground. For every band like S.D. there are a gazillion bands to take their place with music much more in¬ tense and lyrically much more emotional! Is there anyone else out there who thinks this way? I think most all of you do. Even Lawrence Livermore seemed a bit negative in issue #89.1 still love Lawrence’s stuff, and he is a lot olderthen I am, so maybe he knows something I don’t. But I don’t care, I love every little essence of the punk culture. Every god damn bit of it. I love playing live, seeing bands live, listening to tne music! Enough of the negative talk, let’s hear more of the great stuff about punk rock. I’ve also heard some slagging of the Teenage Love shit” lyrics. So what! These lyrics are obviously the strong feelings of the person who wrote them. Who cares if they’re about meeting a boy/girlthat you like a lot! My band, Dr. Gonzo, has lyrics like that. I wrote them, because it’s the way I feel, straight from the heart. And if it ain’t straight from the heart it don't mean shit. I wish I could take credit for that beautiful collection of words, but Lawrence takes that! Don’t be negative about punk music, be positive. Listen, live and love. Be happy about punk rock. I’m sorry that I had to lay all this happy horse shit on you, but it's time for happy stuff. I’ll answer all of you, especially those who seem to be happy as fuckin’ shit. If you’re thinking I’m just a late born hippy or something, fine. Draw flowers and nappy face everywhere. Smile and be fuckin’ happy! Love, Richie/ 930 Harrison Ave/ Carson City, CO 81212 MRR: I’m writing to say thanks for giving our tape a \"bad” review in your September 1990 issue. You said that we were too angry, too negative, and that our lyrics need to go deeper. It turned out that auite a few people feel the same as we do. We got a very good response from the review, and we sold a lot of our tapes. You see, we do have a lot of anger because we are amgry at what is going on this world. Although we do not offer a solution to all these problems, we figure by confronting them in our lyrics maybe some¬ one listening might have a solution. In other words we want to open people’s eyes. We also want other bands to know that some¬ times a bad review might not be as bad as you think it is. Just keep doing what you do. You can contact us by writing to: The Detrimentz/201 W. 7th St. Apt. 5/Thinodaux, LA 70301. I would appreciate it if you would print this letter in your next issue. Peace - The Detrimentz Dear MRR Letter Writers and Classifieds Contributors: Lately, I’ve been getting pissed off by thefrequentoccurrencesofacouple of things in this great zine. So, listen up, and let's get two things straightened out... 1) SOCIAL DISTORTION was, is and hopefully will always be a great band. Ness & Co. have been doing it for a long time; and, if they are now enjoying a recent success, more power to 'em. I hope that they have motivated other bands to stick it out and even allow their music to expand in different direc¬ tions. 2) Classified advertisers: Fuck you and your MISFITS/SAMHAIN/DANZIG boots,test and first presses, and pink and green polka dotted 7\" shit. No one gives a fuck and ain't gonna send you $40 for your warped and scratched shit. Just sharing a few thoughts— John from San Jose Dear Friends, There are several things I have had on my mind lately, and I thought that this might be a good place todiscuss them. Please bear with me if this letter is pure gibberish. I think many people may agree with me about these situ¬ ations. Of course, some others may not. It is those people that this letter is really for. The first thing I am concerned about is record prices. No, not collector prices (al¬ though those are outrageous also) but just first-release 7\"s and albums. Why do some record companies insist on charging $3.50, $4 and even $5 for an EP? I’m no expert, but I don’t thinkthat vinyl costs have gone upthat much. Isn’t the point of music to share feel¬ ings and talent with others? How can that happen when an interested party can't afford the damn thing? I’ve seen albums going for upwards of eight bucks, too. Let’s not turn punk into a clone of the commercial music industry. I am especially pissed off when I see singles that have the same songs on them as the album. Duh Don’t buy a record just for the new packag¬ ing. The easy solution to this outrageous bullshit isto not buv the record. Don’t let people take advantage of you. Wait until the band plays your town, then make a live tape. So what if it doesn’t have a lyric sheet! Share your records with your friends. A letter to a company explaining why you’re not going to purchase the release would help too. The other day I was at a show where four bands played. When the third band set up and started they were almost immediately met with cries of \"You suck!” and “Get out of here!\" from a small portion of the audience. They ended up playing only about five songs because of the crowd response. However, I happened to be enjoying their music and didn’t get to see them play longer because of this. My live tape was ruined also because between every song you can hear booing.

(312) 935-5683 fax (312)935-6218 My point is that if you go to a show and a shitty (in your opinion) band plays, no one is forcing you to listen. LEAVE! Don’t ruin it for some¬ one else there. At least the band had the courage and motivation to buy instruments, practice, then get up and perform in front of strangers. Punk is not about intolerance. Give them a chance to do their thing. Every¬ one starts somewhere. In my eyes, a poor band doesn’t suck, but the person booing them does. Your pal, Phoenix Sheer Terror, If you can’t get people to come to your shows, Sheer Terror, adjusting your attitude will help a lot more than bitching about Unisound. I was honest with you from the tim e vou called m e. Can you say the same? I reinforced most of our crowd is straight edge — you said no problem. You knew that their was only one and a half weeks to get the word out (I spent extra time and money — I mailed 1,000 flyers to PA and NJ, and took an extra 500 to South Street two times. I’ve spent half the time and effort on local bands snows, who aren’t on vinyl yet, and gotten two or three times as many people. I guess they know people who actually like them). I explained to you before you decided to take the show that no way could I guarantee you $300 for the night. You decided to take the show under those conditions. You said no problem, you have a big following. I’m sorry, 40 people at a show with 3 other bands is not a big following. It’s a maybe lean pay the rent if I don't eat next week following. It’s not easy when you’re trying to make a name for your band, and it's not working — but it’s not the people at the shows fault, or the other bands fault, or my fault. Why be an asshole? You can’t bully us into conformity making us loyal Sheer Terror fans. To me it doesn’t matter how many people are at a show, the important thing is that everyone has a good time. Unisound provides the PA and lights for our bands, we also have a half pipe and we’re open two times a week for free skate¬ boarding (short plug). Sheer Terror came in two cars, and after hasseling the other bands, had to borrow their equipment to play. They played for 30 or 45 minutes. I had to explain to them over and over that Icouldn't let them swill beer inthe all age show. They insisted on going first because they didn’t want to hear the other bands. Looking back I should have paid them what they were worth — nothing, but, I gave them $200 dollars out of my pocket. They demanded $300 (which didn’t exist) and threatened to kill me if I didn’t give it to them. Then Sheer Terror knocked over my power amps and broke windows. About the girl¬ friend, the girls hand was buried in my lolly- pop jar, so I removed it from the lolly-pop jar. Vou shouldn’t steal. I called Sheer Terror the next day, and they promised to send me $150 to repair the damage. I’m still waiting. Sheer Terror, if you’re thinking about harassing us again, give it a break. My phone is tapped, I’ve already talked to tne police, and I will not mind prosecuting you. Just so you know, I wouldn’t have written this if you hadn't lied about me. Jake Unisound/Reading, PA/(215)372-5827 Dear MRR and Lali, I sent you a tape to be reviewed, and there were some errors. My address and name: it is Jerme Spew/ 2450 Cypress/ Box 101/Oakland, CA 94701. Then Lali you stated that the songs on the tape were already available. The tape consists of ANGER MEANS (Descend, Dirty Windows) even though they are a great band, they have no releases to date. The RADICTS (6 of them). This is what they wanted me to record; a live song was to be used but no one at Gilman had a good recording. The DERELICTS (Bullet For Fifi/ Sharon Needles) is the only stuff they own, and is out of print. ADMIRAL (Brother, Sea¬ sonal), I did those before I saw their 7\" ad. CORRUPTED MORALS (Be All You Can Be, Peer Pressure) was what I got from them. The CONDITIONZ (More Violence, The Truth About This Town), they asked me to use those songs. The VAGRANTS (Gone, For¬ ever), ‘Gone’ is done live, and ‘Forever’ has not been released before. REACTION (Bas¬ tard, Impress), Nathan sent me the demo, and I thought it was good. He didn’t mention the 7\" to me. P.T.L. (Pit Bull, Moshing Is For Morons), ‘Pit Bull’ is done live, and Moshing is unreleased. I also put $2 and info for a classified ad. I don’t see it in the last MRR. It stated that for $4 ppd. you get 45 min. of muzak. Like you said 9 bands 17 songs from Synthetic pro¬ ductions. Jeremy Spew/ 2450 Cypress St/ Box 101/Oakland, CA 94701 P.S. What happened to the DIY atti¬ tude? Is that used only to call people sell¬ outs? Yes, I know the note with the tape was cheezy, and that I didn’t first class you the tape, but at least I don’t use an already big zine as a power trip. Jeremy, Geez, y'know, some days it just doesn’t pay to get out of bed. Okay Jerme, I obvi¬ ously made quite a few mistakes in my re¬ view, and for that I sincerely do apologize; on the other hand, $4 for a poorly recorded tape strikes me as a bit ridiculous. I realize that you have your own costs to cover, but in turn you must realize that we get tons of tapes around here, and we can’t give everyone a great review simply for the fact that it’s D. I. Y. (as opposed to your “reasoning \"that you got a lousy review, because we’re these evil megalomaniacs). Like I said I apologize about the mistakes I made, and I hope that this rectifies it. As for the classified, I can’t say what happened to it. So send it in again, and I'm sure we’ll be happy to print it. Other then that what can I do besides flagelatte myself for a bit... Lali Dear MRR, Having been a reader of MRR for a fair while now, I have been curiously studying the large increases in the so called \"straight¬ edge” movement and in particular the large number of S/E record labels that have been set up in this time. I have noticed that a lot of these labels have been set up by very young people. This to me isn’t a bad thing but what I can’t seem to come to grips with is HOW these young straight-edgers get the money to set up their own labels? Here in Australia, an independent record labels costs a wad of time and money to set up. I myself would love to be able to do it but of course the money side of it really makes it hard (I am currently saving!). This is what I don’t understand about S/E’s being able to set up record labels at ages 17-20. I really want to know where does all this money come from? I’m 21 and I certainly don’t have a few grand set aside to set up my own label and I’m sure my parents wouldn’t give me the money either. So how the do they do it? I’m sure they don’t bust their ass working 3 or 4 jobs to get the cash to do it. I mean, how many 17 or 18 year olds do you know have enough cash to set up a record label? The only ones I know are the ones whose parents are members of the elite, the upperclass leeches who are behind this screwed up society. How can S/E (as it has become now, not the original idea set out by Minor Threat!) claim to be H/C or punk when they are, as I see it a bunch of little rich kids pressing records with their parents money? Or maybe I’ve got it wrong perhaps they won a lottery or something, who knows? But to me the straight edge image that I see, is a right-wing, upper middle-class, predomi¬ nately white, male-dominated movementthat is not into freedom of choice but into dictating to people how to run their lives and what they should or shouldn’t do with them. I don’t know if this is the truth about it all but it’s the general idea that I get from reading articles on S/E and reading Tetters by people such as Tony Victory. But don’t get me wrong about S/E music though, I really enjoy most of it, it’s just the whole \"down yourthroat”attitude that 1 can’t stand. Straightedge is a feeling . NOT a fcghion ! Speaking for myself, I’m a vegetarian (for moral reasons, not because I’ve got \"the edge”), I don’t take drugs anymore and drink very rarely, but I don’t feel that I have the right to force my views on others or tell them how to run their lives. Freedom of choice is what punk/hc is all about and S/E as I see it now is definitely not that. But then again perhaps I’ve got it wrong, perhaps there is more to the current S/E movement than meets the eye. I’m yet however been able to find this out. I can only say that this is my opinion on what I have noted from reading MRR and other fanzines and discussing with people their feelings on the matter. As for \"Straight-edg- ers\" themselves they are virtually non-exis¬ tent here in Australia, which given the current image and attitude of it all is a good thing. Straight but not S/E, hoping for a change. Yours in Solidarity, Individualism & In¬ ternationalism. Greg Wood/19 Quick Rd Mitchell Park 5043/ SA, Australia Dear MRR, I wanted to take a few minutes to ap¬ plaud Lance Hahn for his “guest opinion” protesting the cover story on the Dwarves S . I agree that their adolescent posturing y deserves print space, much less the cover of MRR; I think Tim’s decision to give them the spotlight in this issue reflects a lind of \"jump on the bandwagon” mentality, i.e. waving the flag of controversy (as “Jesus” of the Dwarves accused SubPop of doing) in order, maybe, to attract attention. Or maybe Tim really and truly loves this band. The in¬ terview was certainly obsequious enough. Maybe they represent something that Tim, as a “critic,” is afraid but secretly longing to do. I mean, to get (marginally) famous by proudly being “politically incorrect” (attack¬ ing women, using drugs, swinging your dick around on stage), is maybe glamorous (?) and a vehicle to get “pussy,” but it’s nothing new. Like the Dwarves said themselves, it’s all been done before, by GG, Iggy and count¬ less others, no doubt, who never made the cover of MRR. So why couldn't the space have been devoted to something a little more challenging to MRR readers? Seeing this kind of boy-ego crud get so much attention is insulting to our intelligence. A similar argument arose recently when the magazine Flash Art put the controversial artist Mark Kostabi on the cover of the sum¬ mer 1990 issue even after Kostabi had made some incredibly cruel and ignorant com¬ ments about AIDS. And guess who had the byline on the interview? Yep, the editor of the magazine (Giancarlo Politi). In the article, he included some statements of protest from other critics in little boxes, much as Tim let Lance write a little column in the same issue. But in the end, the chief editors (is it fair to say Tim Yohannan is a chief editor of MRR?) have the final decision as to what goes on the cover of the magazine. In the following issue of Flash Art, Politi defended his choice, ac¬ cusing those who attacked him and Kostabi of \"cultural terrorism.... towards those whose behavior or ideas do not coincide with our own.” Man, spare us the old freedom-of- expression argument again: when the editor gets accused of putting trash in his/her magazine, the cry of censorship is always an easy way out. Note the inviting comparison to 2 Live Crew on the cover. No one is saying you should have censored the article on the Dwarves, Tim. But just because they’recontroversial doesn’t make them groundbreaking, or even good; and we have come to have standards that high for the bands you put on the cover of MRR. Again, give your readers a little credit for recognizing shit when we see it. Thanks. Liz Colker/ 1082 Post St. #306/ San Fran¬ cisco, CA 94109 Hi Liz, It’s interesting to see that people are astute as to what's been on all of MRR’s covers, and that they get bent out of shape so easiy when we go \"astray .\" Needless to say, I do like the Dwarves, not cuz they’re drunken fuck ups, but be¬ cause they epitomize something that is dras¬ tically missing from most of today's \"punk\" bands. They perform, meaning it doesn't look like they're up there practicing in front of a crowd. They get pissed, they endanger the audience, ana they have fun. One tends to remember a Dwarves show, even if it only lasts 6 minutes, because they go off. Being on the cover of MRR is not a seal of approval, but an accent on something. We put the Dwarves on because they do bring back an important and dwindling element in punk, and because we had some cool photos to do it with. And the we was fairly unani¬ mous. There was no great discussion or controversy. Only after the fact did Lance object, and he wanted to voice that opinion in the zine, which is fine. Hope you flip out next issue when we have Chumba on the cover. Love, Tim Hello there, MRR has always been a good maga¬ zine in my eyes, informative and often chal¬ lenging and providing in-depth information. But in the October issue I was reading an interview with SUBWAY ARTS, a band from Luxembourg, and just couldn’t believe that a zine like yours allowed a band like that to be featured. I’m referring to the question asked about Europe becoming “one* in 1992. They answered that they were against it because (quote)... lots of foreigners will come here, a bit further on... there are already 30% for¬ eigners here, if the borders will open there will be a lot more. Question asked: You’re afraid unemployment will get higher? An¬ swer: Yes. Well this sounds like racism to me, they're just a bunch of fucking conservatives. This bullshit usually comes from the mouths of rightwing politicians and is used as an argument against foreign labourers by ultra¬ rightwing parties, and, surprise, surprise, by fascists (neo fascists don’t exist... there’s nothing new about fascism!!). I was really surprised that this bullshit was tolerated, especially because you don’t tolerate racist, sexist and fascist material in your classifieds. I’d like to have an explana¬ tion. At the end of the interview there was a description of how their last show was ruined by nazi skins, well if such shit comes from your mouth (I’m referring to the things you said earlier in the interview), you can expect that morons like these tocome to your shows. As for the anti-foreigner bullshit, I hope you’ll soon realise that they’re as human as you and I are. The only thing we haven’t got in common is the fact that we aren’t desperate to get a job and are willing to give up every¬ thing we have in the country we are born in. Jos, SEEIN’RED/Holland P.S. Don’t review bootlegs & “no ad¬ dress” records, 99% of us can’t get them! Anthony Scardigo, You are such a festering pile of infected penis puss! Last year I lived in NYC and went to ABC-NO-RIO all the time. All the people who go there aren’t gay and anti-homophobia is not a “trend” as you put it. Just because Mike put on shows there and was gay people didn’t kiss his ass to be his freind because it was the “cool” thing to do. People were his freind because he’saareat person . Ifeel sorry that you were brought upthat way, but maybe you should start thinking for yourself be¬ cause being so closed minded you are losing out on meeting some great freinds. What’s wrong with girls, huh?! I almost don’t even want to get started on this part of your fucked up attitude. I am a female who is fucking sick and tired of people like you who have seemed to have crept into the scene in the past few years, especially since the inva¬ sion Revelation-style stuff. Towards the end of junior high school I got involved in the scene for the same reason you did, anger. But what I also noticed was an equal amount of males and females. Everyone involved seemed to be for the same reasons, mainly for the hatred for the way the world around them was. In the past 2 years I am some- timesone of,the only females at a show. Gee, why is that? And why is it that the majority guys in the underground date \"normal” fe¬ males? Well could it be because of the meatheads with attitudes like you? YES!! I have never been grabbed at show in around the pit in Conn. R.T., or even reputable \"hard” Boston, until this year. Unfortunately, it hap¬ pen at show last winter at the Jersey shore (Killing Time, no less) and at the Channel this tall (3 x’s in 1 show). I’m alsofed up with the assumption that if a female is at a show it’s because A: her boyfreind dragged her there and he needed a coat rack, B: she’s a whore and only there to pick up the band, and C: that they are dykes. I have news for you: we go to snows forthe same reasons as many of the guys, for the music, energy and the politics of it all. We are not the \"weaker sex.” Physi¬ cally men's bodies are structure differently than ours. Our physical abilities are different. Women can give birth. If you are so fucking great why don’t you try and push out an 8 pound sack of sand out your dick or your asshole. On strength, I don’t think anyone can take a steel-toed DM in their face. Be¬ sides, anybody in a fit of rage can do a great deal of bodily harm to another. In 11th grade I kicked the shit out of a hick in the school cafeteria. I am not a huge person or in the best of shape. I don’t know. I'm just sick of all the people like you and the bands like this. The hell with those who sell out to the corrupt world, you’re just jerks. I’m getting head¬ aches from all this bullshit. Just face it — you’re not underground, punk or hardcore, so stop calling yourselves it. And one last thing Anthony — you're right, I don’t have any balls, I have ovaries, you fucking shitnut. Justine De Metrick/ 77 Park Dr #12/ Boston, MA 02215 Hello! Well I haven’t been able to get my hands on many of the recent MRRs recently duetothefactthatthedistributorthat handles MRR to many of the record stores in Milwau¬ kee has dropped magazines and fanzines. It seems that magazines don’t make enough money for them. So if this is old news I apologize. Anyway, with all of the excitement about the \"end of the cold war” and even the “end of history\" (Fukuyama), I would like to submit some ideas for all of you out there to chew on. The conservative right in America have been engaged in self-congratulation and are proudly claiming that “the cold war is over and WE won.” They obviously feel that all of the recent changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe can be viewed as a vindica¬ tion of the hard-line containment policies of America in the post-World War 2 era. They go on to claim that America’s democratic purposes are now attempting to be emulated throughout the world. This, I believe, is very clearly an extremely ethnocentric viewpoint. The democratic freedoms now being gained in Eastern Europe are no more the exclusive province of the U.S. than they are that of France, Australia or Norway. They are, rather, evolutionary. They are the result of the West¬ ern political heritage that has arisen from the OUT NOW : FLAG OF DEMOCRACY\" 8 LOVE SONGS \" RE-ISSUE OF THEIR GREAT 7\" + 2 BONUSSONGS SLIME \" COMPILATION '81 - '87 LP / CD RARE MATERIAL OF GERMANY'S PUNK LEGEND OUT SOONER OR LATER : BLACK MARKET BABY \" ANTHOLOGY \" LP MOURNING NOISE(NJ) STUDIO LP FROM'83!!! \" DAWN OF THE DEAD \" 7” ARTICLES OF FAITH COMPILATION LP STILL HOT : POISON IDEA \" RECORD COLLECTORS LP OFFENDERS \" WE MUST REBEL \" + BONUS \" FIGHT BACK \" 7\" UNITED MUTATION \" FREAKS OUT \" LP TOXIC REASONS \" INDEPENDENCE \" LP EACH LP : 1 2 USD PP AIR BITZCORE REEPERBAHN 63 2000 HAMBURG 36 WEST GERMANY 7\": 5 USD PP AIR CASH ONLY!!

The freedom gained was from Stalinism not Socialism. Tne kind of thoughts advocated by the ideological right serve to promote cultural arrogance. The thought of the end of American hegemony in the inter¬ national scene is anathema to them. The idea that it was the U.S. that emerged as the victor in the cold war seems to be a kind of psychological consolation to them as they are faced with the obviously severe social and economic difficulties fac¬ ing America today. The freedom gained by the Poles and Czechs does not give the U.S. any type of advantages over Japan or the European Community. America is very clearly in decline in regard to the rest of the industri¬ alized world in terms of education, infant mortality and general economic well-being. It is time to face reality and abandon the cul¬ tural arrogance that pervades the American media and political scene. The emerging international scene will not be bi-polar but multi-polar, with no clear hegemonic power. The current situation in Iraq will be used by conservatives to head off the cuts in the military, which for a while at least, seemed inevitable. It is also a situation in which the U.S. can show off its military muscle in de¬ fense of the multi-national oil interests. Hopefully, the emerging democratic gov¬ ernments in Eastern Europe will be able see and learn from the mistakes made by most of the western industrialized countries and de¬ velop a truly democratic form of government. Well, I hope this all made sense. If any one out there agrees or disagrees with me, please feel free to write. Thanks. Dan Gatewood/3432 S.45th St./Milwaukee, Wl53219 MRR- I read the letter from Elf in MRR #90. In it, Elf (a civilian) tells a girl to get out of the Navy by claiming to be homosexual. I don’t think Elf is helping the problem very much. Homosexuality is by no means the easiest route out of the military.; in fact, in most cases, it is the hardest. 1400 people are drummed out of the Armed Services for homosexuality every year. That’s about one a day for each of the 4 branches. 75% of these are women. Most of the people dis¬ charged from the service receive a \"General Discharge - for the convenience of the gov¬ ernment.” Only those who play their cards right receive an honorable. What's the difference, right? Well, if you serve at least one full year, and are discharged honorably, you are entitled to your Gl Bill. That’s $11,000 for college, enough for a 2-year degree (or a month-and- a-half at CalArts...). Do not claim to have done homosexual acts since you’ve been in. That is a crime under the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice), and anyone admit¬ ting to it is eligible for Court Martial and a Bad Conduct Discharge. With a BCD, it is impos¬ sible to get any kind of civil service of gov¬ ernment funded job, not even the post office (not that you’d want to). The \"cleanest” and most effective way of gaining separation from the military is this: Conscientious Ob¬ jection. With all the action in the gulf right now, your command would rather you not accompany them if you have mixed feelings about it. If you are interested in separation, it’s also best to do it now than risk charges of treason once you get to the gulf. If you are interested in gaining separation, write to: CCCO, 2208 South St., Philadelphia, PA 19146 or call (215)545-4626. West Coast, write to CCCO, 1251 Second Ave, San Fran, CA 94122 (415)566-0500. They will furnish you with a list of contacts and a booklet “Getting Out - A guide to military discharges.” Also, askforthe pamphlet “It’s Not Just A Job - It’s Eight years Of Your Life.” This pamphlet has some disturbing facts about the military. Did you know the unemployment rate among young veterans is 35% higher than civilians of the same age group? Finally hire a lawyer. Separation from the Service is a big step. Don’t dick around or sign whatever they throw in front of you. Write to the Military Law Task Force, 1168 Union, Ste. 400, San Di¬ ego, CA 92101. They’ll be able to help you out. Inclosing, I’d like to say I’m sorry forthe girl in Naval Training Center, Great Lakes. It’s a horrible base. A half dozen of my friends were mugged on base, after dark. Many of the blacks form gangs and attack the whites (if you've been to the McDonalds on base, you’ve seen the 10-on-l's). Last Christmas, a man was even stabbed inside the base club. I almost went up to NJP (Non-Judicial Punishment) for being \"Neo-Nazi gang member” because I was a Skinhead. The S.H.A.R.P. posters in my locker were conve¬ niently ignored. My current command has banned tie-dyed t-shirts because they are \"Drug-Related.” Even if they have “The New Kids On The Block” on them. I don’t even bother wearing my Greenpeace shirt anymore.They won’t even let me off the ship with it. In short, there’s no room in the service for alternative-ness.” Well, I’ve bent your ear enough. I hope someone out there in the military reads MRR (besides me and the girl in Great Lakes), and sees this letter. If you decide to get out, let me know. I hope you can use the information I’ve given you... but as my shipmate Dan Shock is fond of saying, “there can be no words of wisdom from a man who shaves his head.” FCSN Eric Thibodeau/ F-Div USS Missouri/ FPO San Francisco, CA 96689-1120 Dear MRR, I’m writing about a little mistake you’ve made in the September issue. In the record review you wrote the name of my band, LES JEANES (which means nothing in French) instead of LES JEUNES (which means “the young ones” in French). It’s a bit annoying. We’ve had a couple of letters from people thinking there was two different bands (LES JEANES in MRR and LES JEUNES playing gigs around their neighborhood). So, we will be really leased if you could clarify this error. Thanks, es Jeunes Dear MRR and readers, I know that there have been too many letters written about this subject, and another one isn't going to stop it, but I feel now is the time to speak my mind. It’s about stealing, especially in the mail order department. I’m not going to lie, but about a year ago I used to be one of those straight edge goofballs who had to have every 7\", demo, shirt and anything else with astraightedgenameon it. I used the mailorder process because it was impossible to get most of the 7\"s and demos in my area. I ordered many, many demos and 7”s and got most of them back on reply. After I wrote back to them about 3 months later requesting my merchandise it was usually sent back. This system worked every time, except once. It pissed me off because these people were supposedly straight edge and honesty is like the number one rule. I mean, if Youth of Today wrote a song about it... Anyway, the band Brotherhood put out a 7” on SK8 Edge records about 1 or 1 1/2 years ago. I ordered their demo from them and kept correspondence with Greg. I’m not sure what his role was in this though. But, he told me the 7\" is out and it cost $3, so I ordered it. I never received it to this day. I don’t want it. Personally I think Brotherhood suck, not because of their music, but be¬ cause of what they did to me and a number of other people (see old MRR’s). That isn’t too straightedge on Greg’s part. Well, I’ve grown out of that stage, and I thought the rip-offs would end. Weil, I was wrong. This particular incident pissed me off more. It’s about Evacuate Records. I used to go to the ABC NO RIO shows (now they’ve stopped but hopefully they’ll start again) and rumors were going around about yet another NYHC 12\" compilation of NY bands. The bands on this compilation were good though. So, I ordered it through Evacuate. In the original ad they promised a silkscreen, white vinyl copy to the first 100 orders. I wanted one so I ordered it the day I saw the ad. I never got it. Why am I drag¬ ging this on? For one reason. Sam Evac, the guy behind Evacuate, used to work and hangout at ABC NO RIO. ABC NO RIO is a great place and so are the people, so I put my trust in Sam when ordering. Well, he never sent my stuff. I wrote him many letters and even confronted him in person about it, but he replied, “They aren't done yet.” They are and have been for 2 months now. Everyone else I know saw the LP in Venus Records. I don’t want to give ABC NO RIO a bad repu¬ tation, but Sam Evac is not to be trusted in this way. That's really all I have to say. Thanks for the time. Mike Simoneth/16 Willow St./ Bayonne, NJ 07002 P.S. For ABC NO RIO, a club inter¬ ested in the scene's prosperity and growth, having Sam Evac on the ABC NO RIO crew is a contradiction. Sam does not seem to be in it for the scene. Maybe I am wrong, I hope so. Maybe it was sent to the wrong address? I would like an answer. To Maximum Rock 'N' Roll and its many readers, This is Dan O’Mahony of Workshed Records here, I’m writing to say hello and to clarify a few things. I started this label a couple years (?) back with the release of Workshed One, Hard Stance’s \"Face Reality” EP. The record came out n icely and public response to it was overwhelming. Nothing could have been more encouraging. I was however, unprepared for the task I had undertaken. I am the first to admit so. From the outset Workshed’s mailorder was a study in dis-organization, understock and irresponsibility. No useful record of in¬ coming orders was kept (I was naive enough to believe that one space could house all of No For An Answer s correspondence, all documentation of my dealings with Hawker records, all of my dealings with Kane produc¬ tions, and the Workshed mail), no useful record of orders filled was made and in the end as the Hard Stance record went out of print, many people were screwed on their ordering of Workshed one by your’s truly, Dan O’Mahony. I deserve to eat shit and die on that one, no excuses and no practical compensation offered, just an admission of my guilt. I am happy to say however, that since the Hard Stance days Workshed has re¬ leased the Head First “Back in Control” EP, Carry Nation’s “Face the Nation” EP, Voicebox’s “Silence Lies” EP, and Shocking Truth’s “Aquaintance” EP, allowing compa¬ nies like blacklist Mailorder to make our records available just about anywhere. As I prepare for the release of Workshed 6 and 7, I am happy to report that the injustice done in the handling of Workshed 1 (which I now realize is quite similiarto the difficulties expe¬ rienced by a lot of young independents in the past, i.e. Positive Force, Wishingwell, Rev., and the 7 Seconds friend club) has proven to be a onetime thing. I apologize for the crimes of the past (though of course that does not change them) and thank you for your contin¬ ued support. A short note on Andreas Gruter: Andreas, you bastardized your otherwise valid point in issue number 89 by attaching it to a lot of nonsense, speculation and flat out lies. Never once have I pledged allegiance to the \"ideals of hardcore” but rather since day one I have written time and time again that the truest insights come from inside the self and not some pre-described group ethic. With regards to my releasing a record on a major label, again that is in Keeping with a belief which I have stressed continuously since the very first N.F.A.A. interview that any and all venues in music should be ex¬ plored so long as they offer the artist com¬ plete artistic freedom and the practices of the label do not blatantly contradict the state¬ ments of the artist. In saying that I rip people off with my own label you dismiss any and all good intentions, the possibility of grave hu¬ man error, and then offer a sweeping moral judgment of my character. You’re a little self- impressed. As for this mythology about my “going nuts” and me starting “what was nearly a fight” that’s an out and out lie, you know it, I know it, and I must make a point of telling you that that kind of under-handed, mud-sling¬ ing, bullshit does a monstrous injustice to all who believe in your work. With regards to the Hard Stance EP, EVERY SINGLE AD EVER for that record stated in equal sized type to all other informa¬ tion, CONTINENTAL U.S. ONLY. Don’t re¬ write my label policy. Also, I never offered copies of the N.F.A.A. lyric sheet, (I never had extras) and certainly not at $2 a shot so I don’t know what that noise was about. I “don’t even try to live up to my words”? Which words are these? Last time I’d checked I'd still managed to avoid becoming a crack smoking, alcoholic, child abusing, promiscu¬ ous, hare krisna, policeman, and was still doing things my way. Andreas play fair, tell the truth, good luck in all your endeavors, and have fun storming the castle. Love, Dan O’Mahony Dear MRR and Theun K, Well, it's taken me a while to get back to Theun, but here I am so let’s start! Now, my not really knowing Theun I’m most embar¬ rassed to admit what I don’t know if Theun is male or female, and I assume nothing, but this portion of the letter is directly addressed to Theun. After reading your response to my letter in issue #88 I didn't know how to feel anger, confusion, indifference, hurt or what! But now that the dust has cleared a bit, I feel that I’m intact. My letter in #86 was intended to express certain somethings that many, many people world-wide have to deal with: SEXISM! Its purpose was to convey how this issue effects myself on a very personal level. I have no idea how it feels to be raped, ostracized, violated or denounced the way women are because I am a man! But that’s not my fault! I can understand the struggle and oppression of women as I see it every¬ where — outside on the streets, on TV, in magazines (ads, etc.), everywhere! I would like to consider myself to not be a part of it, but still a small part of me is, and all I can do is undo it in my life. I may not have the voice of Ian MacKaye or even Sam McPheeters, but I’d still like to express myself of it. I feel that the intention of my previous letter was a positive one, but it appears as though you either had a bad day or read too deep into my letter, you cynic youll owe you no apology! The intention of the letter says it all! Dawn and I have an understanding. We are en¬ gaged in a monogamous boy/girl relation¬ ship based on love and respect. It is not a society-conditioned relationship based on “normal” tradition. Let’s put it in perspective, okay? Dawn is a girl (excuse the term!) and my friend, therefore she is my “girlfriend” not is a possessive sense but in a more spiritual sense. Just as I am her boyfriend. We feel connected to one another, not obligated! Gee, not much more to say on this one, so I'll mozy on to your next line about big egos. Please! The only ego I get is when I see my name in MRR (oh, yes). There are gobs of macho men who dress up their women in pretty clothes, drag them around, refer to them as chick, bitch and even six-pack (don’t ask), and maybe most men do have a big ego but you do not know me to accuse me of such! If your intent was to publicly address my mistake, I say it was pretty gutless. My address was at the end as it will be on this one, too. I welcome you to write me person¬ ally if you’re prompted to do so! I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter, and I'm sorry that you didn't catch on to what it was really about... Now to move on — recently I attended a show with the line-up being Face Value, Walk Proud, Visual Discrimination, Samiam and Agnostic Front. This show was, need¬ less to say, plagued with problems. First off, $16 to see these bands (particularly Samiam). Well, I’ll skip the trivial junk and scoot onto the bulk of it! During Walk Proud’s set, major violence dealt out by nazi skins caused a most interesting turn of events. Big Frank Harrison (Nemesis, promoter, whatnot) got ahold of the microphone and told these baldmen to stop their seig heiling in not so many words. When they continued, he went into the crowd of skins and took the instigator outside without too much effort. But the vio¬ lence and stupidity persisted and anothertrip into the crowd was in order, but this time Frank had a back-up of between 10-15 biggies and most of the security. Within a few min¬ utes the skinhead populace decreased a good 90%. Violence was used in the process and as much as I do not subscribe to or condone it, it was a welcome relief to see what was to me the largest skinhead turnout at any show I had attended literally get kicked out and I just want to thank Big Frank, and those who aided for taking the burden on themselves to try and make the evening enjoyable. Thef inal straw was when Samiam was taken off of the bill at the very, very last second thus prompting us to leave prema¬ turely! The Samiam guys were really nice to us though, giving us free t-shirts and assur¬ ing that we'll be on the guestlist (ooh, ahh) next time around. And now the moment you’ve all been waiting for... the winner of the What Is Punk contest (drumroll please): EVERYONE! Yes, everyone who gave me an answer. That being Adam Pfaler, Marty Brohms, Matt O'Brien, Mike Yuppiekill, Peter Barten, Jen¬ nifer Saverese, Laurie, John Senovich and many more... Hey, far be it from me to decide what punk is, but from reading and hearing all of the responses I felt that they were all a part of what it is — being individuality, per¬ sonal freedom, an outlet of expression, defi¬ ance, communication. Thanks to all of you who took the time to answer it. For all of you record collectors, if you’re interested in a purpled vinyl Haywire “Private Hell” LP, just write and whoever gives the best answer or flyers may have it — really (how daring, eh?). I’m gone! Love, life and Bushwhacker, Mark Rodgers/ 8900 Tilden Ave/ Panorama City, CA 91402 To the press, I have dedicated my whole life to rock & roll, my writing and my art. So at this time I ask you to listen. I was sentenced to 11/2- 4 years in prison for felonious assault, a charge in Michigan which for a first time offender carries a sentencing guideline of 0- 12 months. But just as I have said from the very beginning, I feel I was tried and sen¬ tenced for my reputation as an artist and not the crime they say I committed. I had an unfair trial from the very start. I was discrimi¬ nated against because of my rock & roll lifestyle and stage performances. Judge William Ager Jr. in an Ann Arbor District Court stated that I was not on trial or being sentenced for my reputation, although he said he didn’t agree with it.

But since then I have done all my time all of my RG&C recommendations. I have even done more them what was required of me, and only have one misconduct ticket for missing a single callout, and that happened the first week I had arrived at this prison facility. But I just saw the parole board (Gloria Richardson) on August 8, 1990, and they gave me a flop adding at least six more months to my time saying I needed moretime to think about what I’m going to do when I get out. This is an outrage. I am an artist. I know what I am going to do. I have just signed a recording contract with Enigma records. I have a job and have done everything the judge had ordered. I say it’s because of my rock & roll reputation. I know that I have been set up by this whole ordeal. Why are they so afraid of the truths I sing about? Maybe it’s because it hits too close to home, and people would rather hide reality ratherthen face it, or put in prison anyone who challenges the system. What ever happened to the first amendment? Maybe if I had gone out and killed someone, or was a drug dealer they would let me go. But because I live my life on the edge of rock & roll I should remain in prison. Take a look around and open your blind eyes. I am now seeking a lawsuit against the State of Michigan Department of Corrections and the Parole Board for $3 million indamagesforan unfair trial, discrimination, loss of income, and possible damage to career. I’m doing this for all rock & rollers who might someday find themselves in this position. And justice for Allin, Kevin M. Allin aka GG Allin. For further information, reply to: Kevin M. Allin 20645/ Lock D-4/ PO Box 1900/ Adrain, Ml 49221. P.S. Hunger strike begins Oct. 1, until I get the parole I have earned. The parole board told me, and I quote “Mr. Allin you are a performer for all the wrong reasons, and you need more time.” That’s discrimination. Let’s just say, “Fuck the bastards.” Dear MRR, Howdy! Although I’ve been reading MRR since 1982,1 never thought I’d write to you. I don't consider myself a punk, how¬ ever I do enjoy punk, hardcore and other various forms of alternative music. I’m often ridiculed by my friends for my taste in music. I’m 30 years old and have read your publication and others like it since 1982. I found it quite interesting that people could voice their opinions about whatever they felt, through the pages of MRR. That is why I’m writing you today. Right now, I’m doing five years in our prison sys¬ tem, which I feel was very unjust, and I need to voice my opinion to somebody! Hopefully there is someone out there who might give a fuck. I am doing time right now for posses¬ sion for sales of narcotics. I won’t go into great detail, but I took a deal, which I felt was unjust, but I took it because I was threatened with even more time. Up until now, I have never done any time at all, except a little county time. I have never been convicted of any felonies. Although I was an alcoholic and substance abuser for over 10 years, I never got into trouble. Anyway, after I took the 5-year deal, I found out I would have served less time if I had a real lawyer (I used a public defender). I have met countless guys in here that got caughtwith mega-amounts of cocaine, speed, marijuana and got extremely light sentences because they had enough money to afford a “good” attorney. I got caught with a small amount, enough for my personal use, and was charged with possession for sales. I had no money for an attorney, so my public defender, who I’m sure didn’t give a fuck anyway, came at me with a 5-year deal, telling me if I took it to a jury trial, and lost, I’d get nine years in prison! The court system takes advantage of people who have no knowledge of the law, and literallyfucksthem over. Is that what justice is in this country? How much justice can we afford? Justice for money! I just get frustrated when I meet some¬ one who got busted with 5 kilos of cocaine and only had to do six months in the county jail! Just because his lawyer wined and dined the judge. Or just because somebody’s attor¬ ney plays golf with the 'thinks he’s god” judge, some rich asshole walks away scot- free, while I’m stuck in here. I was thankful to meet up with a guy who has interests in punk and alternative in here. He had some copies of MRR and I was sure happy to hear about that! Anyway, I dig your zine, always have, always will. Hope¬ fully I’ll get some money sent to me so I can subscribe. Thanks for listening. If someone would like to write to me, I’d be glad to answer all letters. Thanks again! Ruben T. Mesa/ E59434/ S.C.C./ PO Box 617/Jamestown, CA 95327 Dear MRR, In response to the letter in the Southern CA scene report of MRR # 89, it is quite true that the scene down here does quite suck — in regards to those punks that look at other unks as if they were much better on who nows what. The person who wrote the letterthough is a nice friend, he put together a show a few weeks ago at the Old World and helped run a 7-band show at Hart Park awhile back, among other things. So there are still some great shows, gatherings and actions that go on despite the few squabbles that happen here and there, so don’t cancel your planned visits to S.Cal! Call (714) 647-2307 to find out what's happening. But frankly, I’m tired of it too, tired of the people who want you to think the way they think —total fascism! And I'm tired of ignor¬ ing and psychotic looks people give to each other, blah-blah-blah. Also, to those people who ordered All Systems Gone 7\", please be patient, you’ll get it soon. Ryan Hopeless who put it out has otten some of the letters already, if not then still have it, I was suppose to get 50 EPs to mail out to those who ordered, Ryan gave them to Media Children’s drummer 3 months ago but I have yet to see the damn thing; I guess it’s no ones fault, the drummer has moved too. Lastthing, System Opposed #6 isslowly being worked on, the reason for delay is because I moved twice and everyone seems to be busy. Please write us at PO Box 1857/ Tustin, CA 92680 if you'd like to help or call our hotline too for updates: (818) 905-4631. Well thank you MRR for the channel. Maybe there will be an end to the “don't like you fights” soon — only if people down here who live a few miles away from each other, work it out. Camille/ Long Beach, CA P.S. After leaving a parking lot where I wrote this, I got in a major car accident, I am now with a big medical bill, a ticket, towing and various bills, wrecked car w/ no collision insurance, etc. What damn luck! So this only means more delay on S.O. #6, hopefully the other folx with it will take over and finish the project up or I get a job soon, 'til next! Dear MRR: Lately, I’ve been reading this indepen¬ dent vs. major debate in your fine publica¬ tion, but let’s try and look at it from a retailer’s point of view. Here’s a guy who’s trying to run a business to put food on the table. Mommy & Daddy aren’t footing his way through life anymore. Therefore, he has a pretty tough decision to make. Should he stock hardcore? OK, let’s say he decides to. He grabs his catalog from his distributor and starts flipping through it. Chances are, he’ll see the CAROLINE stuff, the HAWKER stuff and the COMBAT stuff. The really indie stuff isn’t listed, and if it is, it whole sales for more than the major does! Think I’m full of shit? Here’s actual price quotes from a Canadian distribu¬ tor who shall remain nameless (by the way, these records are imports to poor Canadians like myself). The new WARZONE LP whole¬ sales at $7.99. The latest UNDEAD LP wholesales at $8.99. Hmmm. Nowwhy would an indie charge more than a major? Let’s go back to the store owner now. Okay, he knows that the WARZONE LP is being advertised more than the UNDEAD LP and, it’s cheaper for him. Which means he can sell it cheaper than what he would have to charge for the UNDEAD LP. But let’s say that he decides to stock both LPs anyway. In comes yonder con¬ sumer of the Punkus Rockus variety. He/she doesn’t have money falling out of his/her anal cavity so that person has to make a decision. Does he buy something that he/she has heard a lot about, or go for something that they’re not certain about (which costs more)? I think we know what the general consensus is. And as for you, Mr. David Koenig. Maybe you have the advantage of knowing what RAW DEAL sounded like years ago, but for those that are new to the scene, they’ve missed out. Maybe getting that KILL¬ ING TIME LP is the only way that they'll ever hear it. Not all of us are blessed/cursed (depends on your point of view) to have grown up in the New York/ New Jersey area and experience the original thing. I know, we should all be ashamed to ever want to hear anything outside of our own regional area. I’m glad to hear though that you’re all fortaping these evil major lable bands. I’ll be sending you a box of 100 blank tapes so you can tape me all that which I shouldn’t buy. In no way am I knocking the smaller labels (VICTORY, TAANGI, EMPTY, ROADKILL, etc...) because it takes guts to risk spending so much money to release a record. I applaud you sincerely. So why should I defend a money-grub¬ bing retailer? Well I hope to be one. Yeah, I will sell the thrash metal bands. But bet your ass I’ll stock indie hardcore too. I'm going through all the legal paperwork now to get things off and running. The name of my store? CREEPAZOID MUSIC. With a name like that, I'll need all the help I can get! Trust me! This is a labor of love. I love punk, hardcore, and thrash and I’ll do my best to promote it. But if I have to sell the new SLAYER LPto help keepthings going guess that's the price I’m gonna have to pay. Any of you lables wanna drop me a line concerning wholesale prices, etc... drop me a line. I can really use your help and imput. Take Care, Grant P.S. If these so-called \"major indies” are so evil, why do I see them advertised in MRR? Grant Forsythe/ R.R. #1/ Box 8/ Site 6 Fredericton/ N.B. E3B-4X2 CANADA Grant, Go direct whenever you can.

Dear Readers, When I was little, my father used to hit me, and I didn't know he wasn’t supposed to because no one ever told me. What I know now but didn’t then is that child abuse is a major problem and there are very few people willing to do anything about it. The govern¬ ment is keeping a lot of stuff legal on the “spare the rod spoil the child” ethic. What they don’t understand is the complete help¬ lessness a kid feels when they’re going through this. This is one of the reasons I’m putting together a booklet about child abuse. I plan to aim it at everyone - parents, teachers, kids, lawmakers - so that they can know what it is, when it happens, and what to do about it. I'm writing because I need help. I want to include in the booklet first hand stories of abuse. If you’ve gone through it or someone you know has, I'd like to have your story. Please write it down and send it to me. You can leave it anonymous or send your ad¬ dress, whatever. I know that what happened to me then had a large effect on who I am now, and I know that something needs to be done. No one else seems willing to do it, so I’m gonna give it a shot. Thanks for your help. Emilie, 505 Zion Lane, Zionsville, IN 46077-9331 Dear Folks, I write this in what seems to have become a new center of racial hatred in the U.S., Portland, Oregon. Tom Metzger, ac¬ cused of having two racist skins kill an Ethio¬ pian man, has just been put on trial here and lost. Portland has disgustingly become a focal point for racist activity. It gives me ample inspiration. It gets me thinking how insignificant the punk rock scene is among the whole sceme of things. Why is it then that there is so much prejudice and disagreement within the punk rock community (excluding nazism, etc.)? The scene may be growing again but people should still be aware that America, the planet for that matter, is filled with mostly apathetic, ignorant people. People who write about their hatred of straight-edgers or col¬ lectors, and so on are having delusions of grandeur. The punk scene is tiny compared to the millions of pre-pubescent girls at every New Kids On The Block concert. Isn't \"the underground\" smarter than all that. If bands are wholeheartedly trying to change the world, or at least give a different outlook, shouldn't the scene try to unite to fight the fascism present in popularculture, or Nazism? There is strength in numbers. Or is punk rock merely entertainment no greater than any new heavy metal re¬ lease. No? Why then are there countless letters and people like Ben Weasel who put down people like Jello Biafra and Ian Mackaye. Are they the root of any real prob¬ lem? By focusing in on the problems (which are superficial) within the scene, you ignore the major problems with society and culture. Are people that self-righteous that they can¬ not allow for different points of view and lifestyles. Punk is about alternative lifestyles and music. Or could it be that Punk is as fascistic as Nazism. Anyone associated with \"the underground\" chose a less traveled, more difficult path. In a sea of conformity, it's hard to stick out of the crowd. If punk doesn't allow for diversity, I don't know what will. Any chance for real change has to be found through agreement with those who took the different path. So why criticize someone in the scene. It's fuckers like the Nazis who cause the real problems in society, not Punk. Has punk rock lost its sense of humor? Thanks, Phred/ Gladiator Records/ L.C. College Box 979/Portland, OR 97219 P.S. Does anyone want to start a band in Portland? (503) 768-8748 Dear MRR: Is the purpose of the underground cul¬ ture to exist as an alternative for those who are sick of society or to influence the way we live together? The latter is more important, and it is time for the scene to reajize that the only way to spark revolution is to communi¬ cate the ideals to those whom are not already involved. However, it is important to first get rid of an unnecessary element which tends to close the public mind: violence. In MRR issue number 89, G.G. Allin wrote \"This Thing Called Censorship” in which he stated “So aS it stands, I fight my war alone, but fight I will because I I’m the only hope and future of what the underground of rock’n roll is all about.” What is the under¬ ground of rock n roll all about? Underground music is a means of communication, of ex¬ pressing alternative views, a way of uniting people and encouraging them to reject the corrupt views of the system. However, who will listen if all they see is a man bleeding on stage and all they read dbout is that the singer of an underground band threatened the life of his audience? Does G.G. Allin truly represent the ideals for which the scene stands, or is he, through his actions, allowing himself to be the system’s scapegoat? Allin is not doing anything original, he is simply repeating history- that of Sid Vicious and numerous others, violence is destroying the underground. In the same issue (MRR 89), an advertisement for “Anti-Social Per¬ sonality Disorder—Live’ describes \"The 1989 tour that broke all the laws and left a trail of bloody dev"
