Many of you may have clicked because of the fact that this has 80 pages of comments while 95% of the topics around here Have less than 3. I have to say that would not be possible if the people of this forum didn't support me and help me all the way. Some have said bad things about my idea, however.\n\nRead the first comment for example. I was told not everyone could make these topics. Shortly after, an explosion of new ideas hit this forum. Some were short lived, others had up to 10 pages of comments. I think the reason mine lasted so long was I gave the reader an oppurtunity that before had not been available: being in control of the \"game\". I opened up to anything I was told would improve my idea. Nearly 50 pages of comments are dedicated fans working together to make little or big additions To Lincoln state.\n\nI began work on Lincoln state in around febuary 2009. I made it out of inspiration of the previos mega topic, 08lasventuras' vice city v2. (note all the vice city posts on gtaV?, they are all pretty much standing on his shoulders.) I was inspired by the fact that an entire game was created by a fan. I realized it was a ground not covered. I saw a giant oppurtunity, and all I needed was a basic idea and it hit! An entirely new area not covered by rockstar, the area north of vice city, south of liberty city, and east of San Andreas. An area based on none other than the midwest and east coast, a state, called \"Lincoln\". I included cities previously unthought of: philidelphia, Chicago, and Washington dc. Before no one went further than London.\n\nI do warn you, much of this remains the same it was a year ago. The post is very long, and unorganized. It is very difficult to navigate. Many ideas are almost a punch in the face to realism, and contain things you'de see in call of duty. It's also hard to read as the colors are Designed for the San Andreas wallpaper. That being said, everything else is perfect, so enjoy reading!\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Lincoln State Set in 2004, based on the U.S. East coast and mid-west.\n\nFirst of all, please reply to this. Your feedback=My happiness. Also, try to read the whole thing.\n\nWashington D.C.: Lincolnton\n\nPhiladelphia: Burrington (Top right corner)\n\nDetroit: Carcer City (Top Left Corner)\n\nChicago: Sears City (Bottom Left Corner)\n\nSpringfield, Nashville, and Charlotte: Patriot Island (Medium Sized island in the middle)\n\nWashington D.C, Baltimore: Lincoln (Bottom Right Corner)\n\nGranite Island: Manchester, NH ( Small Island on the left side)\n\nThe map is about 4X the size of liberty city. Think of liberty city being the size of one of these islands.\n\nYou may have heard me talking about this but now its official. I understand how ridiculously long this page many be, and I apologize. I'll say this again, post ANY ideas!!! I really want to hear what you think!\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMy basic idea with this forum is to make GTA neXt equally realistic with GTA4, but also be expansive and outlandish, similar to San Andreas. I don’t necessarily mean making the game less realistic than the previous GTA title, I mean making it more over-the-top. I personally am a huge fan of every game Rockstar has to offer, and I don’t “Hate” anything about any of these games. It’s just that some things need improving. I want a game that has nearly everything to offer in the most well-done, innovative way possible. That is my goal with this topic. To give a basic idea to people about what I truly think should be done with this franchise. You can take whatever it is you like about this thread into your own unique perspective. I’ll be glad to hear what you think should be added to this thread. Feel free to post maps, weapon lists, comments, criticism(In a refined manner), or anything else you think I should know.\n\nThe CITY\n\nWELCOME TO LINCOLN STATE\n\nOverview\n\nLincoln State is one of the biggest states in the US, and is home to several cities, countless towns and villages and even more ignorant tourists like you taking photos of skyscrapers during rush hour. This short guide will help you understand more about the cities of Lincoln and make your stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nSOCIETY\n\nLincoln State has an incredibly diverse society, a chocolate fondue of different cultures, races and societies. Yell an ethnic slur on a crowded subway train and no matter how obscure or harmless it is, at least one person will likely draw a gun at you. Meaning you can eat a delectable variety of meals or buy a delectable variety of novelties and arts and crafts, the success of Lincoln State's multicultural society has been called an admirable template for the rest of the world. The people who called it that luckily forgot that most of the ethnicities have to live in slums and ethnic enclaves and face racism from someone, most likely a drunk hillbilly.\n\nCULTURE\n\nWhether it's NASCAR racing on Patriot Island, boardwalk games in Chiloquin County, staring at priceless works for art by dead guys you've never heard of in art galleries, buying overpriced slutty clothes on any downtown shopping street, watching and heckling corrupt politicians argue meaninglessly in Lincolnton or mountaineering and illegal street racing on Carcer Island, Lincoln State has something for even the nerdiest nerd and most suicidal daredevil to partake in. The diverse society and self-declared role in world affairs has made Lincoln filled with a brimming selection of things to do and things to see. It's a massive microcosm of the East Coast, Midwest and Deep South, all rolled into one (but still hating each other.)\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe economy of Lincoln is as exciting and simultaneously dull as its politics. Farmhouses, small tourist resorts, commuter towns, business parks and service stops litter the countryside. Government bases also litter the countryside as well, but we can't talk about them. But the economy of the cities is what makes accountants ejaculate at night. Sears City is one of the biggest CBDs in the country, with loads of skyscrapers, popular shopping streets and upper-class residences. Sears is an exciting combination of different cultures and histories, and thus is home to media companies, oil companies, financial companies, art institutions and more. While the other cities have CBDs, their charm mainly lies elsewhere. Carcer City is home to a very large industrial and shipping area, and is known as the centre of the USA's motor industry. It is also one of the few places with legalised gambling in America, but don't go expecting the East's Las Venturas. Burrington, while business, retail and tourist orientated like many other cities, also has a small industrial area, but is the least specialised of the main city economies. Lincolnton is home to the nation's government. Yeah, go lobby there for a rocket launcher licence. The other cities and towns also have vibrant economies, but f*ck them, they can wait til later in the guide.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nWith the nation's capital, Lincolnton, in the region, you'd think Lincoln State to be home to some exciting political figures. You'd be wrong. The politicians are just as corrupt, ineffectual and hypocritical as every politician in the country. The state itself is Democrat with the main exceptions of Patriot Island and parts of Sears Island, but if you got bored of hearing whiny, apologetic Democrats, go to Lincolnton and you'll find as many angry, reactionary Republicans as you want.\n\nCUISINE\n\nEnjoy fast food and ethnic cuisine, Lincoln State style! From cheesesteaks to Sears pizzas, you can find all you want in Lincoln State. You can even sample from one of the many street vendors and smaller independent restaurants from throughout the region if you feel like being as vigilant as a cross between an FIB agent and a safety inspector.\n\nThis section will describe the basics of each city and its surroundings, and its rural attachments. I will describe the environment in which has many possibilities. The idea is very similar to San Andreas, except it’s not limited to 3 City’s. It’s based on the United States as a whole, summed up into four Cities’ with other references in between. Most of the city’s are in the eastern part of the United States, to differ it from the idea of San Andreas and make it unique. Countryside includes mountain's and rivers and even animals. The map will probably be bigger than San Andreas, but not like 6 times bigger like some other forums suggest. Rockstar cannot possibly design a city that big, at least not with the technology we have to use now. To get into more detail with the city, I will now describe each city individually.\n\nBurrington\n\nThe City you start out with. Burrington is the only Island in the map with no countryside. Why? It’s not appropriate to just start the player off in a huge Island with a city and a huge variety of small towns and everything like in San Andreas where you started in Los Santos. Also, I want Burrington to be a lot like Liberty City, Clustered together with no Rural Areas, only Suburbs, and an industrial area with an Airport, and a big City. Burrington should be home to many ethnic groups, and a long list of crime riddled across the city. It is home to a stadium, an airport, many restaurants, clubs, clothing stores, drug spots, Illegal and legal weapon shops, safe houses, and more, all accessible for the player to enjoy.\n\nHere are the main areas of which make up Burrington:\n\nFrancis Park (Benjamin Franklin Pkway; Fairmount Park) : A nice cultural area in Burrington containing a museum, a nice park, and some café’s. It is not high in crime, and is near City Hall, meaning it has a lot of people in it.\n\nMiddle Town (Center City): The thriving center of Burrington containing City Hall, a few national monuments, and a convention center. There is a Chinatown in this area. Many tourist come to this area, meaning it has loads of assets to buy.\n\nMandersburg (Bridesburg-Kensington-Richmond): An industrial area along the river that nearly cuts Burrington in half. A lot of the industries in this area are abandoned, however. Not much to say about this place, other than the fact that you can buy a cocaine factory here, and it could be loaded with interesting multiplayer gun fights.\n\nNorth-East Burrington (Chestnut Hill, Germantown, Mt. Airy, Northeast Philadelphia): This area consists of nearly all white upper-middle class sub-urbs. It is actually very close to its not-so-well privileged neighbor, South Burrington. There are some gangs in this area despite its wealth, but don’t expect there to be a whole lot of Hispanics.\n\nSouth-Burrington (North Philadelphia): I know what you’re thinking. Why is it called south Burrington when it’s based on North Philadelphia? It’s just because of the way I designed the map. Anyway, this is the area your first safe house is in. It is where most of the Hispanic Gangs are. It is the most crime-ridden place of Burrington, and has a lot of opportunities to make money.\n\nWest Burrington ( Southwest and West Philadelphia): This area has many, many things to do, and has its share of gangs. It is west of Mandersburg, and borders Carcer City. It also shares the airport with Mandersburg.\n\nCarcer City\n\nBeing the next city in which you unlock, Carcer City is a much different area than Burrington. One of the main reasons is it has a country side left of the metropolis area that contains four little towns, a small mountain range, a large waterfall which is based on Niagara falls, a hiking trail, a beach, its own airport, a mansion which can be bought in the late story of the game, and all sorts of different stuff to do. But that’s just the outskirts of the Detroit based city. The real city has much more to explore than that. My idea is you leave Burrington in the story for whatever reason, maybe a new business proposition, or a gang forced you to flee the city, whatever. Your first choice of an alternative home is in Carcer City. Carcer City is a city which is influenced by many other cities (Just like real life Detroit), so you’ll find a little bit of everything here. There are a total of two airports in the entire island, thanks to its incredible diversity.\n\nCarcer City countryside:\n\nMount Peterson:A small mountain university town.\n\nLas Pesos: A small abandoned mining town.\n\nBluederry Mansion: In a small rural gated community, Bluederry Mansion is a mansion owned by Lord Bluederry, an English aristocrat with a bit too much interest in hunting. After a few missions, Ben kills him and takes the mansion.\n\nConfucius Village: A small mountain resort town.\n\nOgnerton: A typical American suburb.\n\nMandelson: Another typical American suburb, noticeably home to a TV station.\n\nSears City\n\nThis is a city that’s obviously based on Chicago. It is unlocked later in the game, being the second last city to be playable. I also threw in a country side to stimulate being able to travel a little west, but it’s not quit as big as Carcer City’s Country Side. It still is unique, as it has many farms and open fields, and a whole lot of backwoods rednecks, along with some moonshine distribution. (I’ll get into that later). But Sears city itself is the real star of the show. As it is based on Chicago, it will have references to the mob. This will be the main line of work, and one of the only large criminal organizations in the city. The city will have the largest array of skyscrapers and architectural brilliance in the entire game, as it will feature a spoof on one of the largest buildings in the world, the sears tower. This could mean some crazy aircraft mission action, such as a shootout all the way up the tower until you get to a helipad on top, and steal some kind of Jet or Something. There will be many stadiums, many restaurants, many shopping plazas, many opportunities to make money, and so much more in the Chicago spoof. Even the island itself is shaped just like the city of Chicago.\n\nSears City countryside\n\nSplit into two parts. The suburbs are based on more northern, suburban towns, which are basically suburbs of Sears City, while the actual countryside is based on the South.\n\n(I think some GTA III neighbourhood names were derived from Illinois towns. I found Bedford Park and Harwood Heights. Might be a coincidence, but interesting anyway.)\n\nSears City suburbs\n\nGriffith: A small town, with a sculpture named Kebab (a variety of cars skewered on a giant stick), a graveyard, a couple of water towers, a small commercial area and suburbs.\n\nCarrington: A well-off town with Tudor architecture, a small entertainment district and a couple of offices.\n\nBrideshead: A small town, with large Arabian and Polish populations.\n\nDeer Grove City: A small town, home to a large business park, a few industries and a commercial street.\n\nSherwood Forest: A forest area, home to both a planned gated community and a typical American small town.\n\nMadison Park: A suburban town.\n\nQuarry Town: A small town surrounded by farms, small hamlets, a shopping centre, quarries and a refinery.\n\nSears City countryside\n\nCarlboro: A parody of Westboro. Home to an infamous church, the Carlboro Baptist Church.\n\nShawa: A small, stereotypical hillbilly town.\n\nNew Maya: Another poor, small hillbilly town.\n\nBlurbork: A relatively normal town, home to a brewery and several motels.\n\nPatriot Island\n\nThis is a small Island which is based on three U.S. City’s is accessible from seers city only. The city’s it is based on are Nashville, Spring Field, and charlotte. The idea here is to put fill in space in between seers city and Lincolnton realistically by putting city’s that would be in between their real life counterparts, but not go into a whole lot of detail with each individual city, just showing a few references here and there. There is also a small country side, but its content is not enough to go into detail.\n\nTrenton.\n\nIf Alderney is Liberty Cities ugly little sister, Trenton is the ugly bum on the side of the road you poke a stick at to Seers City. A city that's right in the middle of Patriot Island is almost compelely abandoned of business, Trenton is based off of Gary, Indiana and Columbus, Ohio. The city mainly consist of abandoned factories, the games largest projects, and small country houses in between. The large majority of the citizens are black though latinos are moving into the city. With no modern downtown skyline except the ugly factory chimneys and housing projects Trenton has no shopping centers or grogery stores and very few shops. Also a major interstate runs right though the city to Seers City from Queensbridge from the south and the country from the north. Racial tenisons are high (possible missions off of race) Also the city was further destoryed in a racial riot in 2000.\n\nQueensbridge (look it up for the irony)\n\nJust to the south of trenton is the upper middle class Queensbridge. QB (short for Queensbridge) has no gangs and no crime ( a sharp difference from Trenton just north.) QB has a skyline that resembles Memphis skyline from the riverside. QB is also the founder of rock and roll, slavery ( it had the first major southern tading post), and the KKK. QB is 80 percent white and looks down heavily on there neighbors to the north. It is said some city officals are part fo the KKK which is based in the north of Patriot island. When going though QB the new stations are highly conservative. Also sercetly a not so well known fact is that QB has a crack addiction problem that is largly hidden from sight. ( Drug missions and Racial missions.)\n\nThe countryside on to the north of Trenton.\n\nThe most racist part of the state. Highly Redneck and if you sneak around on some nights you might find some KKK members. This area is heavily wooded and you will find bears, raccons and all types of wood animals here. Not a very good place for a Latino to be. Also you will find the largest town here ( Beville) only has a Cluckin Bell. The rest is mainly crappy hotels, tralier parks and country appeall stores.\n\nLINCOLNTON\n\nThis is the last and most significant island in the game. It is based on Washington D.C nad some of Baltimore, and is for the most part the largest city. Its Appalachian based countryside does take up about half of the Island, though. Lincolnton has a variety of crime unlike any other city. Its north and west are a ghetto, but in the middle of the city are things like an enterable Whitehouse knock off, many museums, fancy restaurants, large monumental structures, and so much more. The president is evident, as he can be seen during some rare events like speeches, but he is impossible to kill, as of all the security and restrictions that follow him. Another restrictive note is if you fly a plane below 10000 feet when over Lincolnton, and not outside the city-part or at an airport, you will get a 5-star wanted level, and the air force will send Vulture Jet planes at you. (I will talk about ideas for added vehicles later in the forum.) The city will have many ways to make money, including missions for corrupt politicians, and maybe even helping stop a presidential assassination. If you look on the map there is a dark grey area, with a question mark. This could be a military air base, or some kind of form of military establishment.\n\nCountryside\n\nDyertown: A rather large town, home to an upscale housing development, a hospital and a college campus.\n\nSt. Charlotte’s: A small Amish town, with a farmers market.\n\nMicrotown: A small town, with a shopping centre and a private beach lined with desirable houses and a few high-tech industries located nearby.\n\nVinewood: A small town, centred around a small commercial road and home to an engineering school and a couple of high-tech industrial offices.\n\nHoyer Dove: A small Amish town, with a flea market and farmers market.\n\nSt. Anna’s Town: A small town, home to various archaeological sites, a tourist centre and a small college.\n\nThe Old Lighthouse: An old lighthouse building, famous for its paranormal involvement.\n\nA naval base is situated on the river.\n\nLa camino de Copa: A residential town, with a theatre, cinema, sports fields, offices, a hospital, a nursing home and several stores and restaurants, with a large retail park north of the town. A weapons research site is located just outside the town.\n\nPort Coffee: An almost abandoned small ghost town.\n\nButchersville: A former tobacco market town, now the warehouses are used for stores. Several institutions are located along the motorway along with some shops. A few houses just off the main road make up the rest of the town.\n\nBryan Inlet: A small village, home to a few motels, a tavern and a small marina (some seafood restaurants, a souvenir store and a hotel are located there.)\n\nHomer: A very small farming community. A holiday camp is located to the west.\n\nChiloquin Beach: A small resort town. Its main locations include a railway museum (and a functioning railway station like most towns), a spa hotel, a hospital, a water park, a veterans park and marinas and piers where you can charter a boat. The south of the city is heavily wooden and has a set of cliffs.\n\nNorth Chiloquin: A smaller resort town, mostly made up of residential housing. The boardwalk has hotels, condominiums, stores and an illegal gambling establishment.\n\nSodom: A small town, home to a gourmet grocery, hotels, a marine museum, seafood restaurants, gift shops, boardwalks, a sculpture garden, a tiki bar, concerts and harbour cruises.\n\nAriel: A fast-growing, well-off village, mostly with mansions.\n\nBranby: A well-off village. It is residential outside of a small shopping centre, a train station and some green spaces.\n\nSt. Downing: A small, former fishing village.\n\nThere is also another military base, a few roadside businesses and cottages, and several small hamlets.\n\nMount Lubri SECS (Space Exploration and Control Society, a parody of NASA) base: In the Lincoln City countryside, this SECS base is based off Virginia's Mt. Langley.\n\nNorth Virginia can be incorporated into Lincolnton.\n\nWe have to cut to a commercial now, heres a message from our sponsers:\n\nWeight-Loss Chocolate\n\nMan: Let’s be honest. You’re fat. You’re big. You’re obese. People like you make the world think America's fat! And you choose to blame the fast food industry, confectionery industry. Fair enough, I mean, it’s not your fault you’re a lazy irresponsible eater. You wanna lose weight. But you don’t wanna do exercise or stop eating chocolate. Well, it looks like you’re buggered. (Cheery, triumphant music plays.) UNTIL NOW! With Wendelswenn chocolate, sponsored by Weight Conscious Females, you can eat as much chocolate as you want, and thanks to the flesh-eating bacteria included, you should in theory lose weight! And isn’t the theory all what matters? Note: due to being based in an undisclosed offshore tax haven, any lawsuits will just get your neck snapped by Mafioso friends of ours.\n\nGame Play\n\nAfter you have finished reading my bragging of the cities I made, its time to look at the important aspect of the game, the game play. The idea here is now that Rockstar has gotten used to the Rage engine, it can make a larger and more varied game than GTA4. I want the realism to stay, and increase in certain areas. But I also want it to decrease in certain areas. Areas like the ammo limit, and “Realistic variety in weapons and vehicles”. I think its more realistic to have an environment in which nearly everything that someone could possibly do can be done. Like San Andreas, only with a little more to do.\n\nOther than taxi's, there should be more ways of transportation. Yes, there should still be taxi's, but what about buses? I think that you could stand in a designated bus stop and wait for a bus to arrive. When the bus comes, you get in and it will take you to the next bus stop. Of course you can skip different bus stops. Buses would be a cheaper way to get to places, and you may discover new places along the ride. If there will be multiple airports, than airplanes would be a way to travel from city to city. It will be a bit pricey, but it may be the only way to quickly get between the citys. Taxis and buses wont go out of there own city. You can take trains, subways, and trolleys as well. Also, you could take ferrys and helicopter taxis. Just think about it, and you can ride it. A cool feature would be instead of driving your friends, you can ride shotgun and they can take you for a ride.\n\nOne thing I didn’t like about san Andreas and four is that they showed you a really cool feature, let you briefly enjoy it, and then you never got to do it again. Take three leaf clover for an example, great mission, very enjoyable once you start getting used to it, but once you finish the mission you never get to rob the bank again. I think anything that can be done in a mission can also be done during gameplay.\n\nIdea for a control scheme to steal a moving car:\n\nTarget: LT\n\nShoot: RT\n\nFree Aim: LB\n\nCover: RB\n\nKick: X\n\nHard Kick: X (Hold)\n\nVehicle Jump: B (If close enough)\n\nPunch: A\n\nJump off the vehicle: Y (Similar to jumping out of a speeding car)\n\nLeft Analog Stick: Keep your balance\n\nRight Analog Stick: Change Target (The driver cannot be selected until the other passengers are dead)\n\nAn ordinary kick will just be like how it is if you kick somebody in a normal ground fight, however a hard kick, will stun the driver for a quick second or two, causing them to swerve and possibly crash into objects and other cars, meaning you could either quickly finish them off saving your own live, it would have to be used carefully though, and probably only usable once every 30 seconds-1 minute. When a driver turns corners you’ll need to keep you balance using the left analog stick, and in some cases the driver will swerve back and forward, trying to make you fall off, which will make keeping your balance a bit harder. If you do lose you balance, you’ll have to repeatedly yank the stick over and over and try to climb back onto the vehicle, and you won’t have long to do it in. If you do come off you’ll be taking damage like you would if you jumped out of a moving vehicle, and if it’s a police car they will brake and attempt to finish you, if it’s an enemy or a civilian they’ll simply drive off, and you’ll probably fail the mission because they’ll get away, or you’ll miss out on a car jacking. Taking cover on a vehicle would involve either hanging on the side or the front/back for dear life, staying into cover there for too long will cause you to lose you’re grip, hanging on one hand and having to yank the stick over and over, very similar to losing your balance.\n\nSome more new moves for ben:\n\nThe ability to drag bodies.\n\nStealth kills (killing a lone cop this way won't alert the authorities.)\n\nStealing clothes of police, guards and soldiers.\n\nHuman shield.\n\nGrappling opponents.\n\nTurf wars (with assistance from certain gangs depending on your progress.)\n\nWanted lvl System:\n\nOne Star: The police will try and turn you in, but it’s not there top priority.\n\nOne Star*: The police will hit you with their Batons when resisting arrest. If you have a gun out they will aim a gun at you. You could also get this for vehicle theft without weapons, or assault.\n\nTwo Stars: After resistance to gun point the police have the right to shoot you. They will pursue you with their police cars\n\nTwo Stars*: If you have injured an officer you will get more aggressive two-stars. You will also get this for man-slaughter.\n\nThree Stars: If committed manslaughter on an officer, or a large amount of citizens, you will get a fleet of officers on your tail. They will use better weapons, and use them more often.\n\nThree Stars*: An alternate to the first three stars would occur if you used explosive’s for the act of violence, or got to out-of hand when having three stars. The police will send a chopper to spot your location and help prevent them from losing track of you. They will also set up road-blocks.\n\nThree Stars**: If you pose as a threat to the chopper, It will fire at you.\n\nFour Stars: If you cause too much trouble for the police alone to handle you, they will send the NOOSE on you. The NOOSE will pursue you in their own armored helicopters, Vans, Patriots, and other vehicles. The police will still be mostly involved.\n\nFour Stars*: For only certain occasions the NOOSE will be more common than the police officers.\n\nFive Stars: The NOOSE team has will become much more involved. There will be two Choppers on your tail at once.\n\nFive Stars*: If even the extra troops of NOOSE can’t stop you, the FIB will take a shot at it. The FIB are much more powerful and have better equipment. If you are in the sky, the air-force will attempt to take you down.\n\nSix Stars: More organizations have been assigned to take you out. The CIA is involved and teams with the FIB. The CIA has slightly wittier troops than the FIB, and have different vehicles. The police have stopped all-together. You’re in the governments hands now.\n\nSix Stars *: The National Guard have been called in. You know about them right? Also, the streets are mostly blocked off. Citizens’ are asked to stay indoors. Criminals are running around like mad men.\n\nSix Stars**: The Army is called in. They have better weapons than the NG. They also have better helicopters.\n\nSix Stars***: The entire globe has been warned of your actions. All the air ports are completely closed. Every door is locked. There is an all out global war on your tail.\n\nKeep in mind, the six stars ** and *** only happen after a very long time of six stars *.\n\nLaw enforcement vehicles:\n\nFIB Rancher\n\nA large SUV-like vehicle, the slowest and heaviest standard FIB vehicle. It's harder to push around then an ordinary Rancher, and has several modifications, like a larger, more SUV-like appearance, sirens, a bulletproof body and windows and some moderate flame and explosion resistance. Carries 3-5 FIB agents.\n\nFIB Buffalo\n\nThe most balanced FIB vehicle, carries 3-4 FIB agents. Is bulletproof resistance, but the explosion and fire resistance is much weaker.\n\nFIB Turismo\n\nBy far the fastest FIB vehicle, carries 1-2 FIB agents. Compensates for its speed by being only slightly stronger then an average Turismo.\n\nFIB Enforcer\n\nA rare FIB vehicle, carries more heavily-armed FIB agents and equipment. Is slower and slightly weaker then the other Enforcers.\n\nFOI Cognoscenti\n\nStronger and faster then the average Cognoscenti, it contains two well-equipped, heavily trained and experienced FOI agents.\n\nFOI Admiral\n\nAbove\n\nFOI Dukes\n\nAbove\n\nFOI Rancher\n\nFOI possesses Ranchers as well, and they are faster, but not as strong, as FIB's. It contains 2-4 FOI Agents and equipment.\n\nNOOSE Cruiser\n\nThe NOOSE Cruiser returns, this time slightly stronger. NOOSE officers may fire weapons and chuck grenades out of the window more often then with the Patriot and particularly then when in the Enforcer.\n\nNOOSE Enforcer\n\nThe large, bulky Enforcer is strong and dangerous. Well, when on the move, not really, as officers rarely fire out of the Enforcer and chucking grenades out of it is a no-no. But they ram you around and form a formidable block, at which point large numbers of officers jump out and sprinkle you and your vehicle with bullets.\n\nNOOSE Patriot\n\nLike a normal Patriot, just stronger and faster.\n\nRhino:The military's way of saying \"f*ck you\". They will send these at you later in the 6-star section.\n\nBarracks: Can hold up to 20 Soldiers, and is the 2nd heaviest land vehicle in the game. The rhino is the first.\n\nHunter: A military Helicopter seen in the sky's at late-6 stars\n\nGriffen: Another military helicopter\n\nRattle-snake: The last military helicopter seen.\n\nHydra: Can be found hunting you down in the sky's at 5-stars\n\nVulture: Can be found at 6-stars. In lincolnton, it can be found at five.\n\nMilitary Patriot: The best variation of the patriot. Found at six stars, it is bullet-proof.\n\nAlso, in IV you got to spend time with friends, going into bars and eating restaurants and what not. But you could only do it with friends. There was only one restaurant you could go in other than fast food in the whole game. There should be a whole lot of restaurants, and enterable bars and clubs. There should also be enterable airports and stadiums and museums and ANYTHING that makes the game enjoyable, and realistic. I also think that there should be more realistic air traffic, such as planes actually taking off, landing, docking up and loading and unloading passengers, getting stored and locked, and anything like that. R* wants realism, but if they forget to make the whole thing realistic, and enjoyable, they might go downhill. In my opinion, there should be probably 5 or 6 times more enterable buildings, and fun activity’s to do with friends.\n\nSide Missions\n\nOne thing IV lacked is side missions. This has always been one of my favorite parts of the game. I miss the old days where you could steal a taxi, ambulance, you name it, and do some fun little vehicle mission in it. Vehicle missions wont be triggered by a buttton, however. When you get in the vehicle, you can start doing that mission right away, for example, stealing a taxi and simply driving around looking for random fares. No button pressing required, its just automatic. Here's some ideas on old and new vehicle missions that should be added (Note, you dont have to do everything all at once to get an award.):\n\n1.Taxi: Same as the GTA3 franchise. You can either steal a taxi or apply for a job at a taxi depot REWARD: After picking up 100 fares, you can get a free taxi depot asset.\n\n2.Vigilante: Similar to the GTA4 franchise. There are also some situations where you can’t just kill the target, you have to intimidate them to drop their weapons and take them to the police station. REWARD: After 100 crimes are solved, your body armour becomes more effective. You can also viligante missions without getting a wanted level, and you have access to some restricted areas.\n\n3.Paramedic: Different than the 3 franchise. If you are in an ambulance, you will occasionally get calls from the hospital to pick up someone from an accident, crime scene, ect. REWARD: After 100 saved lives, Your health limit is increased. Hospitals are also cheaper to buy.\n\n4.Fireman: Same concept applies with the paramedic; accept you have to take out fires. Sometimes you will have to get out of the truck and get into the fire and take it out on foot with a firehouse. REWARD:After 100 fire missions, Fire is much, much more powerful, and, your invulnerable from it.\n\n5.News Truck: A new idea in which you have to rush over to an important event going on, and use a video camera to capture all the action, and take the footage to the news studio. REWARD: After 50 news missions, Free newsroom asset in seers city, and you will have more media attention.\n\n6.Pilot: This job cannot be done without a pilot license. You can’t just steal a plane and do it either. You must apply for a job at the front desk, then prepare a Jet to pick up passengers from the airport, take off correctly(Failure to do so will result in less payout), fly to the assigned airport to fly to, land, drop off the passengers, and fly back. REWARD: After 100 Flights, Free private airport in the mountains of lincolnton. Comes with a dodo and shamal, but you can purchase more planes to spawn in the airport.\n\n7.Semi Truck: If you find a semi with a load on its back, you can steal it and finish the job the driver was assigned to do. You can also do it like in San Andreas where you took the truck from the Truck asset to do a job. It’s pretty straightforward. REWARD: After 50 trucking missions, free Truck depot asset.\n\n8.Pizza Delivery: Same exact thing as the Semi Truck Missions. A little easier though, and less pay. REWARD: After 100 deliveries, Health become higher, free pizza stack enterprise.\n\n9.Limo: you must get a job from the limo dealership, pick a V.I.P up, and drop him off. Simple. REWARD: After 50 V.I.P.'s are delivered, you get a free limo lot asset, and free private limo rides.\n\n10.Bus Driver: You steal a bus, or take one from a bus lot, and stop at the bus stops in the given order. You get a certain amount of money per passenger. Stealing a bus that has passengers in it will spook them out of the bus, so you’ll have to wait till the next stop. REWARD: After you have driven through 100 bus stops, you get free bus rides and a free bus lot asset.\n\n11. Burglary: You can do this with any kind of vehicle. You don't even need a vehicle. All though vans are the best thing to use, you can just break into a house at any point, requiring some kind of melee weapon. The crowbar is the best thing to use. You can go in the house and kill the slumbering occupants, or stealthfuly steal there expensive sh*t. Although its un advisable, you can even do this during the day. REWARD: After you make 100k from burglaries, your stealth increases. This means, you can walk faster without being noticed, and can also break peoples necks from behind.\n\n12.Street Racing: There will be a varied amount of races all across the state. It is your job to organize when you would like to do them. You can also try and egg on cars in traffic torace you. There are also BMX and dirtbike race events every 2 weeks. REWARD: After all races are completed, your driving skills are off the charts, and you get to own a huge car lot with a huge amount of suped up rides. Cash Reward: An additional 10mill.\n\nAny other Ideas for Vehicle missions will be accepted.\n\nOther side missions will be evident as well. Like previous GTA’s there will be multiple assets to purchase. In GTA: Lincoln State, there will be over 50 assets, with many side missions to go along with them. This could be anything. Anything that keeps players busy for a long time and that is fun will be good to add. DLC can be something to take advantage of here, maybe you can download asset packs or side mission packs for more stuff to do, making the game have endless Replay ability. Another thing that could be fun is street racing. You meet up with a street racing crew and plan a track to follow, then race it. There could be pre-made tracks you must go through in missions as well.\n\nI also think there should be a long list of side missions that can be done for every friend, gang, or very important character in the game. There should also be random encounters like in GTA4. Like, maybe you can call up a drug dealing friend and find out when a deal is going on, or call a Packie-like friend to see if there’s a planned robbery going on. IMO, I think that you should NEVER run out of side missions. Even if there’s some repetitiveness.\n\nSide mission idea: Well this is kind of a silly one but there could be a company called day industries who are testing a new car which has the worlds most advances AI. It is called the day industries two thousand but is also known as DITT. Anyway play this for effect http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqqOMT6OM_w...25D0B76&index=7 you are hired to test drive the DITT which is basically indistructable and while you are testing it a rival company con industries attacks you and tried to destroy DITT. Luckily they didn't expect it to be indistructable. So they block the road with a tank but you just push the turbo jet button and the car flys into the air basically like turbo boost on KITT. Once you get back the Dave industries you tell Terry Claas what happened and he then gives you DITT as a reward so that Con industries don't attack them. This car can drive it self so you will never loose it as all it takes is a phone call and it will come to you. It will also drive if you set a waypoint and put autodrive mode on.\n\nI want assassinations back. This could be evident in Lincolnton in particular. Someone calls you requesting you assasinate a politition or something. There should be a near unlimited amount of these. Maybe the could increase in difficulty and pay each time.\n\nThere could be alot of situations where you steal a car for money. Maybe you could even just sell any car off the streets by the black market in the later half of the game. There could be many stevie's theft style missions too.\n\nHidden packages:\n\nSecret Spank packages: There are 150 packages of special heroin found throught the state. Each package you collect you earn twice as much money as the last one, and the starting value is 100$\n\nREWARD: After all packages are collected, you wil have the following weapons spawn in your safehouse: Weapon Tier 1 in safe house. Also, you will get a body armour spawn as well as an update on your Turismo, and an extra asset in your safe-houses.\n\nTour-De Lincoln: You will be required to take pictures of certain spots in lincolnton, similar to the snap shots in SA. There are 200 snapshots to take, some of which are very hard to get to.\n\nREWARD: Tourist Trap Asset, $1000000, Weapon Tier2 in safe house.\n\nBaby Eagles: Basicly the same as the pigeons and seagulls from GTAIV, only you get 3X the pay each time you kill one, starting value 200$. There are 50 Eagles in Hard to reach places thought Lincoln (State).\n\nREWARD: Hidden Cave safe house and asset, 2500000, Weapon Tier 3 in safe house\n\nGANGS\n\nGangs have been important in GTA since GTA2. In San Andreas, you had your own gang in which you had to defend, and build. This would be great to have again, accept different. Maybe this time you can build a gang from scratch. Maybe this time you can make allies with other gangs so they can help with your own gang, as long as you return the favor. I also think that every gang should be able to be fought with, or made allies with. Your decisions on who you want to befriend or betray could be a major impact on the story. Here is a gang respect idea made by Flesh N Bone:\n\n“Like said, the gang system changes completely. We all know every GTA game features a great number of gangs in them and sometimes you are allied with them while enemy with others. What I have in mind is, how about a respect level for all gangs. It's between -50 (red color) to 100% (green color). The more respect, the better the gang will treat you. When you are in red color, the specific gang hates you. It's a matter of time and they will attempt a few hits on your life too. If you kill a number of 5 gang members you lose 5% of respect, each kill drops 0.5% and a total of 5 (around the same time) makes a total of 5% dropped. After -20, the gang will hate you and if you are around their turf they will attack you.\n\nWhen you reach -35, the gang will send a death squad in a four door car and they will drive-by the hell off you before coming after you on foot, if you choose to do so. They will be armed with Uzi's and even shotguns or assault rifles at times. Sometimes the gangs will have trouble with rivals and police, so their turf and members will be attacked, no matter what percentage (red or green) you have with respect, you can help them and raise your respect level. This will make them like you more.\n\nIf you are in the positive line (green) then the gang will like you and you will get special abilities with them. If you have a high respect level with two rival gangs you will get into hard choices at times. You will get your chances to decided which side you are going to help, after a couple of phone calls from either leaders, if you don't do your \"homework\", one will call you and set you up, telling you to do them a favor however it turns out to be a trap where you are attacked by random enemies (can differ from cops to psychopaths to loyal gang members and even madmen detonating themselves with bombs).\n\nIt would fit to a more \"errand\" storyline like GTA3 where Claude has no gang ties and just works for whoever pays or helps him (kinda like Niko too). But it works differently, you are offered to work for all the gangs, you can choose up to 3 to help but after time if they become aware of your affiliations they will hate you suddenly.\n\nBasically this is the keys and the respect level:\n\n0% to -19%: The gang members will attack you if you fire a bullet in their turf or kill someone (pedestrians).\n\n-20% to -34%: The gang hates you a lot and will attack you as you cruise past their turf.\n\n-35% to -50% (the maximum hate): Gang hates you with their guts and will try all they can to waste you, this includes attacking anything you own such as safehouses, businesses (hopefully) and turfs for gangs that respect you to drive-by attacks.\n\n0% to 15%: The gang is your friend and wont attack you until you start killing any of them.\n\n16% to 49%: The gangs leader will get your number and you will be able to call him and he will help you if you ask for it.\n\n50% to 64%: You have earned the trust of the gang and they will be up for anything you want as long as you return the favors in a time limit they give you (days, weeks etc..).\n\n65% to 80%: You can recruit the gangs members on the streets and they will help you on certain tasks you do.\n\n81% to 100%: The gang's leader is your friend and you can go to their house, hang out with them and they will also pay for stuff if you ask them. You can also take over territories for the gang from enemies and that will raise the hate the other gangs have towards you.\n\nBasics to earn respect and lose it:\n\nYou have to do certain things to earn/lose respect from the gangs. If you are allied with one during the storyline, you can still lose the respect by pissing them off. You lose respect by simply piss off the gang through many ways from killing them on the streets to take over their territories, to destroy their properties and even killing high ranking members that have been spotted by your allies. To earn respect on the other hand, you need to do favors. Ways of doing this include, killing enemy gang members, helping the gang's members wiping out cops or rivals who try to muscle in their business, taking over territories for them and do other stuff like repossess cars, make stores pay protection, receive drug packages they ask for and more besides that.” Flesh N’ Bone; Feb 25, 2009\n\nThis pretty much explains what I think gangs should be like. I think maybe in Lincolnton there could be Liberals and Conservatives verbally bashing each other, or maybe a list of Mob Family’s that you have to choose one of to help get to the top in seers city. In Burrington and Carcer city there could be all kinds of gangs, as well as some parts of Lincolnton. There should also be biker gangs and rednecks in the country side. And all of these gangs have a history, enemy’s, and allies of their own, all being fully interactive. I think that some gangs should be less powerful than others. For example, a small group of Puerto Rican drug dealers would be less powerful and easier to conquer than the sears city Triads. And a sears city Mafia Family is very powerful, but not as powerful as a corrupted group of government agents.\n\nSome gangs that only have a minor effect to the story can be wiped out completely, and can have their gang leaders killed. Other gangs are either never wiped out, or wiped out at only a certain point at the story. You can wipe out gangs by taking over all their territory. You can take territory by either buying it from them (Requiring at least 1% respect), or taking it by force by planning a gang war or just causing enough destruction and deaths of the other gang in that territory that they HAVE to give up. You can also get territory by some story missions, or completing side missions for ally gangs. Another way to wipe out a gang is to just kill their leader. You have to find him by searching through internet files or friends to find out just where he is going and when. If you can successfully kill him, the gang will most likely stop running. Or, the gang will be yours.\n\nOf course, why wipe out a gang when you can own it yourself? You can own a gang by making your own gang powerful enough to overrule the ally gang, and causing them to request that they become a branch of your own gang. You could also take over enough territory of a rival gang that they surrender, and become of a part of yours. Oh, and gang wars are back =). There are other ways as well, but all in all, it is good to have as much gangs at your power as possible, because they help contribute to storyline and side missions alike. And as a quick note, you can’t ally with two rival gangs, unless you OWN both of them.\n\nCustomization\n\nThis has become a big thing in the GTA series, ever since Vice City came out. San Andreas nearly mastered customization, but then the series kind of let this aspect slide in the later titles. This can’t be the case in this game. I think they should bring things like haircuts, muscle, many clothing options, weapon skills, vehicle modding, and many of the other things that were in SA. They should also introduce new things like customizing your gang, modding bikes, boats, and aircraft, buying useful items for your house (At a reasonable extent), customizing weapons, the radio, and a lot more.\n\nCustomizing gangs could be very fun. You could have an option to “Buy for gang” in a clothes shop. This could mean it will cost a lot more, but what you have bought would be a clothing item used by members in your gang. You can make many outfit combinations, and colors to show different classes of your gang. They could also have the some option for gun shops. You can buy weapons for every member of your gang to use. And, if they make car dealerships, and bring back car modding, you could also do the same thing with that, for an extra price.\n\nWeapon modding can be done at a gun shop. You could buy an already modded weapon, or to save money, have the shop mod the weapon themselves. You can put things like silencers, laser sights, advanced scopes, and more. One cool idea would be mounting weapons on vehicles. Two handed weapons come back once again, but you will need to practice with the weapon before you can correctly use two weapons at once.\n\nAlso, buying things like computers, radios, refrigerators, T.V.’s and gun safes for your safe house could be fun as well. Refrigerators could store alcohol and drugs to keep for your own use. Gun safes can store weapons you are not currently using so you don’t have to buy a new one each time you switch weapons. Many opportunities come with these features. Modding the radio could be as simple as downloading a song From Xbox live or Play station network, calling a radio station, and selecting one of the songs you downloaded for that station.\n\nTelevision is expanded: Here are the new channels:\n\nZNN: A parodiy of CNN that spends much too much time on celebrity news and little details of the president and his wife. ( I.E what color tie he wore or what does it mean since he moved his hand at a certain part of a speech) Also the political shows are parodys of Hardball (MSNBC) and Hanninty(FOX) of cousre in GTA fashion these two are extremely extraggated. The line up is:\n\nNewshour:Parody of Situation Room\n\nSteelballs:Parody of Hardball\n\nConservative Hour: Parody of Hanninty\n\nThen they just go in a constant loop and up date as the story moves along. the same goes for all the other channels\n\nREALTV!: This is a parody of Tru TV. For half of the time it could be clips of your character or NPC chacacters. (That would bring different views to your killing sprees) The other half is based off of The world's dumbest crimminals with fake celebrates belittling retarded crimminals.\n\nVideo Clips\n\nRetard Crimminals: Based off of Worlds Dumbest Crimminals\n\nComedyViewTV or CVT: Would be a comedy channel with all comedy rounties from real life performers ( like in GTA 4)\n\nReality TV Network or RTN: Would basically show all reality shows based off of the Real World, Big Brother and I Love New York. The shows line up would be\n\nActual World: Based off of Real World the room mates would be: Lesiben Twins, A psycho, A transexual, A gay dude who doesn't know he's gay, A dude in a hot dog suit and a wannabe gangster (O.J LOC BABY!)\n\nBig Sister: Would be the same as Big Brother with about the same cast as Actual World only bigger but a main difference is that in the show the host takes privacy invasion to a new level.\n\nI Love Titties: you ever wonder where Roman was in 2004? Well guess to longer! He was on the set of the hot new reality show I love Titties! Unforuentaly for him it turns out the person he would be fighting for with the titties is a man and instead of staying inside of a nice house he ends up getting sent to play a Survior type game. He can't leave because of the contract he signed. So what as Roman is surrounded by 20 gay men fighting for lard butt!\n\nLatino Enterntainment Television: Is a parody of BET only for Latinos. So many possibliabities I'm just going to leave this one open.\n\nThe local channels would be things like:\n\nCrappy Local News: this channel covers of your deeds and local crime and events ( so if you go on a killing spree outside of story mode it would be reported.)\n\nSub Prime Mortage Commericals: Ben can actually buy assesets from his channel\n\nLocal Auctions: You can buy everything! From clothes to cars to houses in these. Though a Seers City auction would have more to offer at higher prices than a QueensBridge auction. Of cousre the things on sell are random ( mostly) and you can always buy everything off the internet but for a higher price.\n\nThere are hundreds of houses to buy. There become for sale at random times during the game. you can buy houses, apartments, mansions, and even houseboats and private planes that you can sleep, eat, and store things in.\n\nWeapons\n\nOne thing four lacked big time was a large variety of weapons. They tried to make it realistic by not having crazy weapons like flamethrowers and chainsaws, but isn’t it more realistic with a whole lot of weapons to use rather than like two types per category? Also, I think some weapons should be two hand-able. Here’s my little list: (Note, Items marked “Dual” are two hand-able)\n\nMelee:\n\nBaseball Bat, Steel Baseball Bat, Knife, Machete, crowbar, sledge hammer, pickaxe, Kantana (dual), industrial chainsaw, Combat Chainsaw, Taser, and more. Nearly anything can be a melee weapon.\n\nPistols\n\n92fs (Dual)(Tier1): A standard pistol that is cheap and useful. Not very fast, nor powerful, but can be easily obtained thought the game.\n\nGlock 18 (Dual)(Tier2): Faster rate of fire than the standard pistol. In fact, it is fully automatic. It is not quite powerful though, but can be purchased fairly cheap.\n\nDesert Eagle(Tier3): Incredibly powerful, slightly slower than the 9mm, much more expensive. Good for the richer hit man who wants the job done right.\n\n.375 Magnum(Tier4): Most powerful pistol, with the slowest firing rate and smallest capacity. Most of the time, it is a one shot kill.\n\nSub Machine guns\n\nTec-9(Dual): Very cheap, automatic, and effective from short range. Great for drive-by’s assuming it’s all you’ve got.\n\nMac 10(Dual)(Tier1): More powerful and expensive than the Tec-9. Basically the next step up.\n\nMP5(Tier2): Highly accurate, very powerful, and overall one of the best in the game. Expensive, though.\n\nP90(Dual)(Tier3): Small just like the Tec-9 and Mac-10, but much more accurate. Highly expensive and rarely found.\n\nAKS-74u(Tier4): Insane damage for a mere sub machine gun, this can kill an armoured opponent as fast as an AK-47. This is definitly the best large SMG\n\nShotguns:\n\n12 Guage(Tier1): A standard shotgun. Useful and cheap at the beginning of the game, but loses use towards the end. Close Range or bust.\n\nSawn Off DB shotgun (Dual)(Tier2): Can be shot off a bike or car. Is lightweight and can be held like a pistol. Found mostly in rural areas.\n\nSpas 12(Tier3): Extremely powerful quick firing rate. Would be the best shotgun, but is still pump action.\n\nStreet Sweeper(Tier4): Almost as powerful as the spas-12, and can fire at the rate of an assault rifle. With 20 rounds, this gun make other guns look useless. Cannot be legally bought, very hard to find.\n\nAssault Rifles:\n\nM14: A powerful semi-automatic rifle available for a low price\n\nAK47(Tier1): A actual auto assualt rifle, you get a lot for an extra dollar with the Ak-47\n\nM4A1(Dual)(Tier2): Not quite as powerful as the Ak-47, but smaller and has a faster firing rate. You can fire two at once when remained stationary.\n\nXM8(Tier3): Probably the best assault rifle. Equally powerful with the Ak-47, and same firing rate as the M-4: Can only be bought by martial forces.\n\nFamas(Tier4): The fastest assault rifle in the game. At the same speed as a Mac 10, it also has a good range, and is rather accurate. This is a rare and exclusive assault rifle found only in the military shop.\n\nSniper Rifles\n\nM40a1(Tier1): Good for taking out someone long range, but slow on the reload.\n\nPSG-1(Tier2 and 4): More rounds in one clip than the bolt action sniper, and about the same power.\n\nArmalite AR-50(Tier3): Incredibly long range, and incredible power, but must reload after every shot, and must be mounted, or It will have heavy recoil.\n\nHeavy Machine Guns\n\nM249 SAW(Tier1): Being a near one shot kill, it has 100 rounds per clip, and can tear up a car turning it into rubbish in a matter of seconds.\n\nM60(Tier2): Larger, louder, and more devastating than the M249. It IS a one shot kill, and with about 6 or 7 shots, it can blow up a small car. It is VERY expensive and hard to find.\n\nhttp://www.epicycle.org.uk/images/minigun2.jpg(Tier3): An interesting choice of weapon, it holds 500 rounds per clip, and fires at an unpredictable rate. Its power can destroy a car, truck, boat, or even helicopter in a matter of seconds. It is highly inaccurate though, and cannot auto-target. One of the most expensive weapons in game.\n\nHeavy Explosive/ Fire Launchers\n\nThumper(Tier1): It can shoot one grenade at high speed. Can also shoot Molotov cocktails, but can fail at times.\n\nMK47 Stiker: A fully automatic grenade launcher that can shoot up to 20 grenades without having to reload.\n\nFlamethrower(Tier2): Highly illegal and only found in the highest level arsenal trafficking available. Shoots flames out in a long, continuous burst, perfect for killing large crowds of people in an open area.\n\nRPG-7(Tier3): fires a special type of grenade at an incredible speed, and explodes at impact. Good to bring down helicopters. Very expensive, but not SUPER hard to find.\n\nStinger Missle Launcher(Tier4): Fires small auto targeting rockets at large targets. Must hold aim and stay close to a target to confirm auto targeting. Is Great for faster moving vehicles or aircraft.\n\nRail Gun?: I’m not too good on this idea, but a rail gun is an actual weapon that shoots objects at an invisibly fast speed and destroys targets at the sheer force of impact. This has never actually been used for combat before, so maybe it could be featured like the Jet Pack was in SA.\n\nProjectiles (Contains Two slots. Slot number will be marked)\n\nMolotov cocktail(Slot1)(Tier1): A glass bottle filled with explosive liquid, which is to be lit on fire and thrown at an enemy. It blows up into flames at collision and I’ll assume you know what happen next…\n\nGrenade(Slot1)(Tier2 and 4): Same EXCACT concept as in GTAIV. Except maybe you could stick one in a car, or someone’s pocket???\n\nC-4(Slot1)(Tier3): Just like the SA satchel charges. You throw them at something, it stick to it, and you detonate it.\n\nBreach Charges(Slot2)(Tier1): Some-what like C-4 except used to blow down doors and kill anyone behind it.\n\nSmoke(Slot2)(Tier 2 and 4): Fills an area with smoke to confuse enemies. Good for strategic gunplay.\n\nTear Gas(Slot2)(Tier3): Fills an area with non-lethal gas that weakens an enemy and may pass them out.\n\nAnything that can be picked up can be a projectile.\n\nStrange Weapons\n\nNail-Gun: Is cheap, and can be bought in a department store. Shoot nails rapidly at opponent, and can cause serious close up damage. This is used by construction workers. and small Burrington gangs.\n\nArmour:\n\nThick Jacket: 1/2 the amount of protection of thebullet proof vest\n\nBullet proof vest: Provides protection\n\nBody Armour: Provides 1.5X more protection\n\nSteel-plated armour:Provides 2X more protection\n\nAdvanced Ballistic Assualt armour: Provides 4X the protection\n\nPower-Ups\n\nSilencer: Silences the gun, takes out the flash, and on mp hides your blip.\n\nRed Dot scope: Umm, gives it a red dot scope.\n\nAcog-scope: The standard scope for N.O.O.S.E members and such. Lets you scope with weapons that aren’t snipers.\n\nHigh Capacity Mag: Gives it more shots per clip\n\nHigh-Cal Bullets: Increases damage and penetration\n\nRifle Scope: Available for Assault rifles, zooms farther than the acog.\n\n20X Sniper: A scope for a sniper that zooms in farther than the standard 12X sniper\n\n30X Sniper: A scope for a sniper that zooms in farther than the 20X sniper\n\n50X Sniper: A ultra powerful lenses only available for the Armalite sniper, zooms farther than it’s typical 30X sniper.\n\nExplosive Rounds: Bullet’s that explode on impact\n\nREALISM\n\nEver since GTA:SA, this has been a huge part of the franchise. GTA4 took it to a whole new level. My idea, increase Realism, to a point where more variety and interesting factors contribute to the game as well as what was evident in GTA4, Graphics, realistic effects, ect. I think realism should involve anything to be possible.\n\nI think you should be able to visit any kind of clothing store, not just what “Fits the protagonist”. Bring back Binco, Zip, Victim, Sub Urban, Prolaps, and add new clothes stores too, as well as department stores, fast food chains, fancy and casual sit-in restaurants, specialty shops, and bring back Ammu-Nation.\n\nThere should be more things to do on the streets, like replying to people remarks to you, or egging on someone to fight. You should be able to sit on benches, read magazines and news papers, store things in the trunk of your car, view wildlife in the countryside, go on hiking trips down nature trails and up mountains, go dancing at night clubs, Surf, Perform BMX and Dirt Bike stunts, go fishing, drink alcohol in your own house, take drugs, smoke cigarettes, pickpocket people, meet girls at bars, rent a hotel for the night, and so much more.\n\nI think everything should be fully interactive. For example, you get in a severe collision with another car, then witnesses call 9-11 to alert the police and rescue department. You can just ignore the situation and most likely not much will happen on your part, or sit through the situation to just see what happens. If you drive suspiciously, a cop may ask you to pull over just so he can question you, without you actually getting a wanted level. If a dead body is lying on the street, people will call the police right away, and sooner or later they will investigate. If you act suspicious, they may question you. Resist, you may get a star.\n\nAn idea of mine is that instead of a cop just putting a gun to your face in a car and you getting busted, there could be several ways to break free. Things like just driving away quickly, striking the officer to break free, or running him over with the door of your car could all be used to resist jail. You could also at any point drop your weapon and give up, at any wanted level. If your wanted level gets high enough, they will start sending FIB agents and even National Guard at you. (read my thread on wanted level system for more details)\n\nPlanes are back, and they are more realistic. When you crash a plane by its wings, the wing will break off. If you crash it head on, it will blow up instantly, assuming you are going fast enough. Planes and helicopters can go up to 30000FT in the air, which is actually very high. There is always plane traffic in the sky, and planes always have a destination, be it another Lincolnton airport, or out to an entirely new area. Planes regularly take off and land, and its not very easy to just take a passenger plane. You need to either take a parked one and take It out just right, or buy a plane ticket and instead of taking a seat at the plane, walk up to the passenger seat and take control. This will get you around four stars, though. Smaller planes like Dodos and Shamals can be taken rather simply, and can also be owned. Military Jet planes are back, this time featuring the Hydra and Vulture. The difference between the two is the Vulture has more advanced physics, and can fire artillery and multiple rockets. Vultures are rarer than Hydras, because Hydras can be found in Some Restricted areas in airports, while Vultures can only be found in the Air Base. Keep in mind, restricted areas are guarded by powerful forces, usually the military.\n\nAnother realistic factor to GTA: LS is that every ped and every car has its own destination. They all have somewhere they ultimately plan on going, meaning you will find cars parking and taking off, instead of them just spawning and disappearing. The only time peds disappear is when they are dead. They don’t just randomly appear, either, they come to the state by plane or boat and spawn out the vehicle, or when you come in.\n\nIn fact, every ped is somewhat unique, and sometimes random peds will ask for favors to be done. That is one of the random events that happen in this game. Another random event would be the cops swarming your safe house trying to get a hold of you for something, which only happens around two to three times in a play through. Other things like random bank robberies and bomb threats happen scarcely through the play-through. But some things may never even happen, and if they do, it will never happen again. Things like a random kidnapping plot against you, or a plane crashing into countryside. But these things have like a 1/10000 chance of happening.\n\nRealistic gun fights should be evident too. There will be different types of enemies, some weaker than others. A pedestrian would be on the ground in pain with one shot, while a trained police officer would have got three body shots to get on the ground. People with armor would have to get shot many times in the chest to weaken the vest. A shot in the head, rather obviously, kills everyone, while assuming you don’t have armor, a heart shot kills too. If you shoot someone in the legs, they have to limp away, while if you shoot them in their knee caps they won’t be able to move. An arm shot disable use of the arm, meaning that person can’t shoot with that hand. Shoot someone in the stomach and they’ll move much slower. You can disarm opponents as well. Laser sights and agog scopes can boost accuracy.\n\nOther than gun fights, you can realistically commit other crimes as well. You can use stealth once again by coming from behind somebody and slitting their throat, while you can also make some weapons silenced to shoot someone less noticeably. Also, if you kill someone, or even a police officer correctly with stealth, you’ll never be found out unless you hang around the body. You can use this as an advantage for gang wars and evading one star cops. You can also hang on to moving cars, and jump from airplane to airplane, by using a rapid tap method. Fires should also spread, rather rapidly. If you throw a molotov in a building, eventually the building will be on fire. Flame Throwers could be very dangerous as well, because you could melt the metal off cars. Also, \"when your health gets low enough the screen will flash red stimulating a heart beat. You will also breath heavier and have less stamina\" Seth penguin.\n\n\"How about you have a really simple phone to start. Like a Crappeo phone, no camera, nothing. Just calls and texts. It can't even use cheats. Then, after about Mission 5, you get enough money to purhcase (a mandatory mission nessecary phone purchase) and you then get one with cheat capability, and the ability to call special phone numbers (911, pizza, taxi etc.). Finally, after about mission 20+ and then you are pointed to a phone store.\n\nHere you can purchase better phones. Like a phone which is the exact same as the previous, except it has a camera. Then you can purchase one with a better cam, stores more photos and can text (you could receive texts, but now you can use pre-established answers to get replies.) Finally, you get the best phone (The iPhruit, $6000 a little pricy!) which has email, internet, MP3 (Songs on Indepence FM or your Hardrive can be played from here at a reasonable volume) radio (ingame songs) more special numbers, better backgronuds, excellent camera, unlimited photos, more special numbers and touchscreen interface.\n\nSome of the numbers you could call would be pizza (whoever's idea this was, great job!) to get them to bring cheap health replenishes to you, taxis if you are far away from one and need it, maps (show bus routes, and other points of interest i.e restaruants, bars, dealerships, properties for sale etc.) Then (I'm quite proud of this one!) you can target someone, then call 911. Select police, and when they ask fro the problem, you can dial 123 and the come to arrest the person targeted!\n\nYou can arrange meets (not just to go out with friends, you can arrange side missions to begin from your current location without having to drive to a far away place.) You could even browse the web, go to Crappea and order furniture, and find it delivered at the selected safehouse! That would be great! You could perhaps organise a meeting to test drive a car at a dealership (chances to nick rare or even dealership unique cars) and select positive, negative, neutral or something else answers to friends questions, which affects there respect or like of you.\n\nNow I know these things sound crazy or too hard to impliment, but imagine if R* did this it would really increase re-playablility. And just think, if they do this, they could add this sort of detail to many aspects of the game, it would be fantastic.\" El Zilcho\n\nTHE STORY\n\nIn a nut shell:\n\nBen Lopez is a 22 year old Mexican American gangster. For most of Ben’s life he has been surrounded by poverty and moral depravity, and the only comfort he could claim was that he shared these hardships with his three younger brothers. On the streets of Burrington, he had been a courier for local drug dealers, from the height of the crack epidemic to his early teens, and was renowned for his boxing skills both in and outside of the ring.\n\nAt age 16 he was approached by a bartender named Poco Alvarez, who was also a mid echelon drug dealer and fencer (of stolen goods). Poco immediately takes on Ben as a protégé and teaches him everything he knows about his trade from how to use a gun to selling drugs. One day Ben accepts an offer to run his own corner and is driven to a corner with two other members of Poco’s crew. When they arrive at the corner he notices 3 guys on a stoop, a few seconds later one of the guys in the front of the car he’s in pulls out an Uzi and opens fire on them. Two of the three corner-boys are killed and the other one, in an attempt to flee the machine gun fire, was shot in the leg a few feet away from the stoop. The driver then hands Ben a pistol and tells him to finish off the injured corner-boy. He then gets out of the car and without a second of hesitation shoots him in the head at point blank range. The group then flees the murder scene, while in the car Ben was still adrenaline rushed from committing his first murder and bestowed with pride that he now had his own little piece of turf to operate. Later that night at the Lopez house, Ben’s parents, who were very abusive to Ben and his three younger brothers, get into a heated argument that eventually ends with Ben’s father killing his mother and abandoning them, never to be seen for years to come.\n\nOver a course of 4 years, Ben supports his 3 brothers through working in Poco’s crew, performing all sorts of activities ranging from drug dealing, home invasions, armed robberies, collecting street taxes, and occasionally murder for hire. Surprisingly Ben doesn’t get arrested for any of these crimes and earns the nickname Ben “Lucky” Lopez. However, one morning Ben’s boss, Poco, is killed in a car bomb along with his lieutenant. These two murders are followed by driveby shootings and gangland hits on 4 of Poco’s heaviest corners. At the end of the day, 18 members of the crew Ben belonged to were murdered. Fearing for his life Ben leaves the vast majority of his earnings to his brothers, asks his eldest brother to get a job to support his other brothers, and goes into hiding by enrolling in the U.S. Army at age 20, in the year 2002.\n\nTwo years later, Ben had found millions of dollars worth of diamonds, next to several bodies. Raseem Salah, a Pakistani lieutenant commanding Ben’s team to help curve the flow of drugs out of Afghanistan, was unwilling to share the diamonds with the soldiers he was commanding. So instead, Salah falsely reports to his superiors that the soldiers he was commanding killed fleeing Afghan refugees without his orders. To contain possible controversy that might arise from these “killings”, Ben, along with his fellow soldiers that he served with, is then quietly discharged from the army. An infuriated Ben decides that attempting to kill Raseem Salah, for selling his unit out for diamonds, would be a suicidal task that was out of the question. He is sent back home to Lincoln State to reconcile what he has and what he hopes to gain on the streets of Burrington. Ben was forced back home to the dreaded Burrington which he had tried to escape.\n\nBen’s brother Daniel, was informed of Ben’s return, and agreed to pick him up from Burrington Airport. When they arrive at his run down apartment, he explains to Ben what has happened to their neighborhood while Ben was hiding out in the Army. Apparently most of the criminals operating in the barrio have been paying street taxes to someone named Emilio “Butcher” Piedad. Daniel is working for a drug dealer named Armando Iglesias, and after a few jobs for Armando and Armando's coworker Brian (in which he meets Julio and Elizabeta Torres, starting a friendship and a relationship respectively), Daniel gives Ben some news. He explains that Paco, Ben's old mentor, left Ben the bar he operated in his will. After inheriting Paco’s bar, Ben decides to let Daniel name it “Consuelo”, relief in Spanish. Realizing that they need seed money to reopen their new business, Daniel suggests that they bring in a Puerto Rican drug dealer, named Manuel Tadeo, as a partner. They meet with him and out of respect for Ben’s reputation, Tadeo agrees to help finance Ben’s business if he does a few favors for him. After doing a few “hit” missions for Tadeo, “Consuelo” becomes available as an asset. While at the bar, Ben manages to come in contact with a stickup man named Lenny Hopkins. After stopping Hopkins from almost drinking himself to death, he explains to Ben that his girl friend was sold into prostitution to pay off an insurmountable debt and that he decided to get the money from a loan shark to pay for her freedom. Unfortunately after he made the payment, his girlfriend wasn’t let go from her pimp. So now he’s in heavy debt to a loan shark and his girlfriend is being used as a prostitute. After Ben does missions to help resolve these issues for Hopkins, which include killing a loan shark, he agrees to be a bouncer at “Consuelo”.\n\nMeanwhile, as Ben and Tadeo continue to expand further into the drug market, independent drug dealers begin to either pay them “protection” money or become incorporated with them. With the extra cash he’s been making, Ben decides to branch out into loan sharking. He starts out by visiting the names of the customers in the black book, which he picked up from the loan shark he killed, and have them pay him. While on a debt collection trip Ben and Hopkins meet a comedian named Carlos Rodriguez. He explains that he’s unable to pay off his debt because ever sense he slept with his agent’s girl friend he’s been having a hard time getting booked at clubs for him to do his comedy act. Ben manages to sympathize with his predicament because while he was in the army, he saw Rodriguez do his act and thought it was hilarious. He and Hopkins then begin to do missions to help improve Rodriguez’s career by intimidating club owners to overpay Rodriguez to perform, killing rival stand up comedians and agents, and having a civil rights lawyer pressure a tabloid company into backing away from “smear campaigns” against Latin Americans. Ben and Rodriguez end up getting $40,000 in settlement fees from a tabloid company. In return, Rodriguez pays off his debt and lets Ben be his unofficial agent, who would receive $1500 a week from him and 10% of the weekly earnings from the clubs that booked him and his friends, amounting to $5000 a week.\n\nBen eventually gets involved with the Burrington Jamaican Posse (and helps them manage a few drug deals and a biker war with Heathens MC), the Polish Mob, and the Greek Mob, before Ben's success gets noted by Paolo Javier Suarez, a member of his father's gang. Paolo begins causing trouble for Ben, before finally he is able to get Ben kicked out of Burrington and into Carcer.\n\nBen begins to rebuild his criminal organization by taking on jobs for Silvio, his brother. Over the years Silvio has become very involved in progressive college campus politics. He has Ben help him further his ideas in campus politics by helping him kill right wing activists, high echelon employees of greedy health insurance companies, members of right wing think tanks, members of fundamentalist hate groups, and rightwing lobbyists. Ben also helps steal an election for a liberal city council man.\n\nAfter helping him with his political activism, Silvio uses his connections to have Ben meet Mike Sheridan. As a high ranking union official, Mike wants to further his cause with Ben’s assistance. He has Ben perform tasks that coincide with strengthening the Brotherhood of Auto Workers (BAW), the union Mike belongs to. After destroying several Japanese car factories, Ben and his gang are tasked with killing goons hired by the Farley auto company that were trying to dismantle a union picket strike.\n\nAfter defending the strikers, Mike reveals to Ben that the Gallo family, the mafia gang in Carcer city, has been getting paid large sums of money, out of the BAW pension fund, by the auto industry to silence the activities of organized labor and keep employee costs low. To fix this problem Mike tells Ben to kill the Gallo mobsters who’ve been operating this anti-union racket. After doing so, Ben is rewarded with a large sum of money from the BAW pension fund, a high paying “no show job”, and a partnership with the BAW that allows him to get corporate “kickbacks” and a percentage of profits from inflated auto contracts. Ben also uses this partnership to finance a chop shop and sell stolen car parts to all of the garages and auto retailers across Carcer City, with an auto enthusiast called Chris helping him run the business.\n\nAfter the financial damage caused by the Gallo family, Ben decides to help Mike replenish the BAW pension fund. He then has Silvio arrange a meeting with another one of his connections. Ben reunites with Elizabeta, and while she quickly leaves him for \"bigger fish\", she turns out to be highly connected and has Ben introduced to the leader/Imam of Temple 6 Mosque, Kareem Fawwaz. Temple 6 is a branch of the African Muslim group known as the United Islam League (UIL), but unlike most of the UIL’s branches, Temple 6 is involved in many criminal enterprises. Kareem has been looking to expand into the Afghan heroin market. Having now been introduced to Ben and already hearing of him, prior to their meeting, Kareem makes a deal with Ben to help him restore the BAW pension fund and increase his cash flow. Ben agrees to help him build a drug ring for Afghan heroin, nicknamed “Easties”, and to become an equal partner in the profits gained.\n\nHe then begins to muscle pharmaceutical stores into acting as fronts for “Easties” shipments. One of these fronts is later robbed by gunmen. Afterwards, Ben is ordered to hunt them down, luckily Carlos (on a state tour) was at the pharmaceutical store when the robbery was taking place and manages to relay information about the license plate number to him. Ben and Elizabeta track down the gunmen at a club called “Blue Athens”. They then fight their way through security and execute both robbers. Afterwards Kareem informs Ben that he saw on the news that the gunmen he killed were members of the Afro Mob gang. He has Ben try to make peace with the Afro Mob by including them in their “Easties” ring. After a sit down with Tyrone Williams, the leader of the Afro Mob, Ben begins co-opting with them on taking over drug turf. Pete, Ben’s business adviser, eventually presents an idea about shipping “Easties”, Afghan heroin, to large quantity buyers by putting the product in BAW trucks, which are meant to deliver car parts, and let them get a cut of the profits. Ben puts this idea into action and it turns out to be very profitable. Just before the deal was announced, Elizabeta leaves Ben.\n\nUnfortunately an assassin tries to make an attempt on Imam Kareem’s life. The assassin however is captured and interrogated. After the interrogation, he reveals that he was carrying out the hit on orders from Tyrone Williams. Ben retaliates against the attempted hit by leading a team to rob a really huge fundraiser being held by the A.A.A.A. (African Americans Against AIDS), a fake non-profit organization that’s a front for the Afro Mob. The heist nets $2 million. Kareem then assigns Ben to kill Tyrone. However, Daniel comes up with the plan for killing Tyrone. He explains that apparently one of the largest narcotics distribution points for the Afro Mob was at a stadium used for concerts. So he suggests that they kill Tyrone when he’s presenting the band at the next concert. Ben follows through with this plan by sneaking backstage and shooting him with a silencer equipped magnum pistol. Ben reports to Kareem after the successful hit and is officially given half of the Afghan Heroin ring to operate independently with his own gang. He also has Cassius Makin, one of Kareem’s former soldiers and a staunch ally of Ben during the missions he was doing for the UIL, join his gang.\n\nWith Ben’s drug ring up and running he’s able to restore the BAW pension fund. With the criminal enterprises he established he’s been bringing a fortune. However, the money Ben’s been bringing in is illicit income that can’t be reported to the IRS (Internal revenue service). Wanting to avoid IRS scrutiny, he begins to buy up legitimate businesses to launder his money into. Unfortunately, the profits from his legitimate enterprises come up flimsy because of mafia shakedowns. Wanting to seek immunity from the Gallo’s, or at least a better deal, without starting up a full fledged gang war he know he can’t win, Ben decides to call a meeting of other Latino criminals to solve the problem of Italian interference in their businesses. After everyone is gathered at the meeting it shortly turns into a calamity with vicious arguing and unreachable disagreements. Everyone leaves accept for Lenny Quentin. As an old school street gang leader and head of La Mexicana Nation, Lenny begins to insult Ben and explains that the Gallo’s wouldn’t be messing with him if they were aware that he was capable of backing up a heavy retaliation. Lenny then begins to laugh at Ben’s money induced ego and starts talking about how he can generate cash, but doesn’t know how to implement the basics of getting people behind him. He then offers to show Ben the ropes of gang recruitment. He accepts his offer and they drive over to Lenny’s house.\n\nHe introduces Paulo, Lenny’s son, to Ben, asking Ben to let Paulo work for him. Agreeing to bring Paulo under his fold, Ben is also introduced to a friend of Paulo’s, named Jose Delgado. Ben decides to recruit Jose also. Lenny tells him that they should meet up with a local thief named Joey Enrique at “Club Dillinger” to see if he’s willing to join also. This time however, Lenny has Ben dress up fashionably, make small talk with him about what he does and what he needs out of Joey, and has him pay for one of the strippers to have sex with Joey backstage. Ben then offers a “job” to Joey, who more than gladly accepts to be recruited. The three new gang recruits are then assigned to kill a mob associate, while he’s collecting from an appliance store that belongs to Ben, and to burn the store down, for the purpose of collecting insurance money and to erase the murder scene. Lenny then tells Ben that his new underlings will show off to their friends and over time will bring them to their hangouts to become associated with Ben and to try and join his gang. This becomes Ben’s main recruiting tool, but not his only one. Another recruitment lesson Lenny teaches him is to collect information about people in the neighborhood. And if possible, follow up on what information he receives about that person, that way they’ll be indebted to him.\n\nBen first applies this tactic when he hears of a local Ognerton street tough named Rafael Estevez. A few months ago Rafael’s father skipped town on a debt he owed to a crew of drug dealers, so in retribution they killed his mom, and left his two younger siblings orphans. Ever since, he’s been living on the streets, trying to track down the men who killed his mom. So far he’s managed to gun down one of them. Ben decides to follow through on Rafael’s vendetta by kidnapping the other two men involved. Ben then invites Rafael to meet him at a crowded restaurant, where he hands him a huge wad of cash and asks him to drop it off to his two siblings at the orphanage. The next day, Ben shows him the location of where he hid the two men he kidnapped, who killed Rafael’s mom. Rafael proceeds to kill them both and afterwards is handed another wad of cash and is told to go find a place for him and his siblings to stay. Ben tells him, that if he wants work, to meet him at “Jabots auto retailer”. Rafael accepts this offer, knowing that he was being recruited into gang life.\n\nWhile at a BAW supervisor’s office, a factory worker named Juan Alejandro approaches Ben. He tells him that ever since he and a bunch of other union members got gigantic raises, they’ve been operating a loan shark ring. It eventually became so big that they were supplying “juice”, loan shark money, for gamblers and drug dealers. Unfortunately as the loans became larger, it became harder to get returns. To solve this problem, Ben lets Juan become incorporated into his organization. As Ben begins to flex his muscle around, heavy payments from heavy borrowers begin to come, in the forms of both cash and physical assets. Ben eventually runs into a roadblock when a biker gang that he lent money, to finance a crystal methamphetamine ring, refuses to pay up. This problem is solved when Ben brings along his entire crew to kill and rob the biker gang at their hangout.\n\nWhen Joey opens a large safe, which they stole from that biker gang from the other night, greeting cards start flying out. It then becomes obvious that these greeting cards contain thin layers of crystal methamphetamine inside them. Ben decides that they should deliver these cards filled with meth to a boxer doing time, named Jaime Santiago. They then deliver the cards for him to sell. When he’s released, he joins up with Ben’s gang out of thankfulness.\n\nThe Lopez gang’s good luck begins to arise when turmoil breaks out in the Gallo family. Antonio Gallo, the boss of the Gallo family, was gunned down in a barbershop. Quickly his underlings began fighting for dominance of the family. The mafia war eventually breaks up into three factions. One faction is lead by Frankie Gallo, another faction is led by Jason Palermo, and the other faction is led by Vincent Caldacci. With the Carcer city Mafia preoccupied in destroying itself, Ben sees an opportunity to enrich his gang by filling in the power vacuum being created by this war.\n\nBefore Ben makes his move, Daniel brings in a film major from CCUA (Carcer City University of Arts), named Xavier Ferraris, to make porno movies for his new company, Adonis Inc. They’ve also been putting some of these movies on a website they created and have been stealing credit card numbers from the users. Through Lenny, Ben has Adonis Inc. become incorporated with Madame Nealson, a madam who operates a brothel. He and his gang then begin to do missions for Madame Nealson to further expand their involvement in prostitution. It starts with rival pimps being killed and having their hookers being recruited.\n\nFrom being tipped off by a member of the Villa Posse, the Lopez gang finds out about a large human trafficking ring, run by the Caldacci faction of the Gallo family, designed to smuggle woman into the U.S. to work as prostitutes. Ben proceeds to hijack a truck with several of these women who were meant to be delivered to a brothel. He meets a woman, who was on the truck, named Alina Borislav. It turns out that she was a Russian heiress trying to escape her oppressive oligarch father. She decided to try and find a job in Germany to escape her boring life, but instead she got scammed into a human trafficking ring. She has Ben contact her strong-arm from Russia. This leads to Ben coming into contact with Pavlov Feodosiy, Alina’s boyfriend and a member of the feared Kpachar Pyka, a Russian mafiya group that translates into the Red Hand. With his help the Caldacci human trafficking ring is destroyed, along with several members of his crew being killed.\n\nPavlov also helps Ben by helping him recruit Russian models that have contracts in Carcer City. Ben’s then makes a move on a Carcer City pornography king named Milo Bonanza, by forcing him into retirement. With the assets and women he’s collected, Ben sets up a pornography convention, featuring the “Porny awards”, new items from the sex industry, and the unveiling of Sexy Aphrodite magazine, a pornographic magazine of Adonis Inc. The Lopez gang then proceeds to corner the porno magazine market by intimidating or killing off most of the competition in Carcer City. Also, Alina and Pavlov decide to remain in the U.S., with Pavlov working for Ben. And with Ben’s Carcer City Empire continuing to flourish, he moves out of Silvio’s house and into a nice looking place of his own.\n\nEventually, Ben gets a call to have a sit down with Jason Palermo. At the meeting, Ben agrees to assist Jason Palermo’s faction if his own gang is granted immunity from mafia interference in his business. With this agreement being reached, he begins to work with Steve Rizzutto, Jason’s under boss, on helping Jason win control of the Gallo family. They first decide to build up their war chest by providing “protection” for gang inflicted businesses. They do this in the form of them killing off the rival mobsters who were scrutinizing the businesses that they were offering protection to, for a price. The first priority of having Jason become the new boss of the Gallo family becomes destroying Caldacci’s already battered organization before going after Frankie Gallo’s faction.\n\nBen attends the Porny Awards, but gets stopped by Ignatius Preachman (I changed it from John because there are too many Johns and Johnnies in Lincoln State already), a highranking CCPD officer. After doing a few jobs for Ignatius (including increasing his profile, removing bad elements and eventually infiltrating the department, killing the chief and allowing Ignatius to take over), Ignatius agrees to not put any pressure on the Lopez gang and also act as an \"informant\".\n\nBen also meets Lord Bluederry, a rich, somewhat evil English aristocrat who gives Ben several jobs, and introduces him to several contacts.\n\nAfter helping Palermo reach the top of the Gallo Family, Palermo introduces Ben to Johnny Malone, his cousin in Sears.\n\nLater on in the story, one of your friends says that you can expand your empire down in Seers City. He says his cousin is in a Mafia family and would be glad to give Ben work. Ben Accepts, and him, his brother, and his dog travel to this new city together. They don't just Go strait there, however. They run into a group of Hippies who have a huge weed farm, who also own a fair slice of the diamonds, showing that his dad had distributed them across the state. They decide to do a few jobs from them to leech some money, then they kill them and take over the weed farm and have some of the diamonds. At that, they travel to Seers City with no other distractions.\n\nThe three of you stay in a hotel, and check out this business opportunity. The mobster is very useful to you, and has alot of information on your father, the diamonds, and the Sergeant. You end up being a well-known Gangster, and businessman of Both Seers and Carcer City. But he just can't get over his father. Ben tries to get in touch with the third brother, who was said to be in Lincolnton. Knowing that the bridges are blocked by the FBI due to threats to assassinate the president, he heads up the heavily guarded Windy Tower( Sears Tower), then steals Griffen Helicopter, and attemps to fly to Lincolnton.\n\nOn his way to the city, he is gunned down in mid-air by the Air force. His helicopter fell 10000 feet onto the ground, while Ben helplessly was trapped in a Huge Fire. Next thing you know, you wake up in a bright room, which is guarded by heavily armed S.W.A.T members. You ask a man in a suit how you got here. He reviels that he saved your life, and that you will have to work for him. He is a corrupt Politician who knows your father as a close friend. You are sent to a Military Sea Base where you will have to do a few jobs overseas for him. After you finish these Jobs, you are let free untill the next time he needs you.\n\nKnowing you wont be able to get into Lincolnton, you continue working with the Mafia, and you also have a good oppurtunity to take over some of the Seers City gangs. Once your empire has reached a certain high point, the bridges to Lincolnton are open again. At this point you start looking for your brother, and ultimatley your father.\n\nUpon arriving in Lincolnton Ben is informed by Johnny Malone that Raseem Salah, the sergeant who sold out Ben, is now operating there. Ben then gets a call from Zhuang Wu, telling him to meet up with Ronald Meyer, a rich businessman friend of Zhuang who is involved in some shady practices and owns the Weazel Network. Ronald introduces Ben to several contacts such as Billy Hudson, who is running for mayor, Richard Dixon, a shady insurance broker and Ted Schwartz, a Weazel journalist.\n\nJohn Stoney, who you met in Patriot Island, gets you to foil an assassination attempt on the President. \"Quentin Moran\", a secret unaffiliated government agent employs you, as does the PPA, President Lawton unaware of your background.\n\nBen is introduced to an evangelical pastor named Dick Gluten. He has him kill a rapper named Guerilla whose lyrics he found “detrimental to Christian society”. He then has Ben kill a drug dealer who he thought was going to rat on him for laundering drug money through his “Christian Crusade” organization. Through Dick Gluten, Ben meets an actor/gun enthusiast named Milo Blades. He helps Milo by forcing out residents of low rental houses to make the land purchasable for the purpose of having high valued real-estate to be built. After shooting up boats carrying smuggled human beings, because Milo hates illegal immigrants, Ben beats the crap out of a Vinewood director that wouldn’t put Milo in a movie. In return, Milo gives Ben a stake in his real estate business.\n\nAt another Billy Hudson fundraiser, Ben has a sit down meeting with a Japanese businessman named Yoshio Miyazaki. Yoshio is known as an extremely affluent businessman in Japan and is looking to heavily expand his operations in America. He’s also involved in several illicit business ventures and is a Daigashi, under boss, in the Daimyo-Kai Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Yoshio expresses his interest in using Ben as an American contact to solidify his overseas powerbase and has him work with him by promising Ben that he would heavily back Billy’s campaign. Yoshio first has Ben kill a group of Zaibatsu employees that were trying to shakedown a cargo company of his, by threatening to sell large shares of stock to a volatile investor. Yoshio’s next task is having Ben kill opposing contractors for the purpose of receiving a pricey contract for the construction of new public transportation projects. Afterwards Yoshio tells Ben that he wants to use his newly rewarded public works project as an opportunity to smuggle in crystal meth. To make this goal possible, and to bring in a lot of campaign money, Ben blackmails a powerful Lincolnton city councilman. In return the councilman puts forward a zoning bill that would limit expansive construction in Lincolnton. This immediately leads to a backlash of people, whose property rights feel threatened, donating to the Hudson campaign and several other conservative politicians, who end up defeating this bill.\n\nYoshio is kidnapped. When Ben finds the kidnappers, he is immediately knocked out. When he wakes up, he is greeted by a man named Quentin, who he knows from before and does various jobs for. He reveals to him that Yoshio is part of a far right wing group called the “Red Dragon society”, which is vehemently against immigrants. Quentin assigns Ben to work with Yoshio to curve the threat of North Korean insurgents in exchange for being able to operate without federal interference. This leads to Ben fighting North Korean drug gangs that were sent from Kim Jong Il’s private army to help raise money.\n\nLater Ben assembles a mercenary squad consisting of his old army buddies to kill a suspected arms dealer, named Bae Machii, who was suspected of planning to sell nuclear weapons. Quentin also assigns Ben and his mercenary squad to raid a prison, called San-Fulton, which was incarcerating a suspected pro-communist terrorist named Chin Ho Seok.\n\nBilly Hudson uses the attack on San Fulton as “proof” that his opponent, who is the incumbent mayor, was dangerously weak on law and order. Billy then goes on to win the election and becomes mayor of Lincolnton.\n\nAt the victory party, president Lawton and some of his friends get strung up on ecstasy. Ben sees the group getting really high and immediately is told by a panicking staffer to not tell anyone about this. In return for not revealing President Lawton’s drug incident the staffer reveals to Ben that one of the people he killed for Quentin was under false pretensions. Apparently Chin Ho Seok was a reformer living in Japan, whose parents previously escaped North Korea, that wanted to make North Korea a left of center social democracy that wouldn’t have to rely on drug smuggling and wouldn’t succumb to moving to far to the right when communism fell. An extremely large pharmaceutical company called SDA has been using North Korea as a distribution point for their drugs across the Asian market and felt that the type of reform Chin Ho wanted to bring was disastrous for their multi billion dollar industry. So Quentin, for the good of the country, asked you to kill him.\n\nYou get help all over the state to find your father and brother, and eventually two Triads have the solution: Your brother works for your father and can be found hiding near the Lincoln Mansion area (White House.)\n\nYou head over there right away. You find your brother with guards aiding him. You take them out, and confront your brother. He says he had worked for your father ever since you joined the army. He says that your father was going to kill you and Daniel but he wouldn't let him. He also said that his father has taken over all of Burrington and that he went to Liberty City to take over it as well. You choose at that point to kill your brother or not.\n\nAfter that, you travel to Burrington (Which was "
