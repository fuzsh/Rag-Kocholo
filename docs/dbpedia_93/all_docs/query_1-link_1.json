        "text": "August 12, 2012\n\nSoundtrack Part I (\"Taking in the Sun in an Exaltation to You\")\n\nHey, indie music fans, listen to this (start with the first five minutes, the rest is noise, about which more later), while you read the first part of this review:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdeTQP...\n\n\"Looking for a Man with a Focus and a Temper\"\n\nThis 422 page book is jam packed with information about one of my favourite indie bands, Sonic Youth.\n\nDo I need to know all of these facts about Sonic Youth? Of course, I do.\n\nWould I like some opinions about them and their music? Some analysis of their musical appeal and their cultural importance? Some reasons to vindicate my 30 year old passion? Of course, I would.\n\nAm I alone in craving opinion and analysis? Maybe.\n\nWould I be just as passionate, if nobody else liked them as much as I do? Of course, I would.\n\nStill, did this book give me the opinions and analysis I craved for? Nuh.\n\nDid it give me just one outrageous opinion? Just a teeny weeny hint of how much David Browne loves the music of Sonic Youth more than the detail of their career trajectory? Perhaps, but I don’t remember it.\n\nDavid Browne is a man with a focus and no temper.\n\nAm I just going to crank up some Sonic Youth, listen to it through my headphones and not write a review of this book?\n\nWell, yes, yes, no.\n\nArtist: Justin Hampton\n\nhttp://www.justinhampton.com/index.html\n\n\"Got a Foghorn and a Drum and a Hammer That’s Rockin’\"\n\nI can’t read music or play an instrument. I don’t understand the difference between open tunings and standard tunings.\n\nSo I’ll try to explain what I thought was happening in Sonic Youth’s music in the only way I can - with words (sorry if I get it wrong).\n\nI assumed that an open tuning was just the guitar strung normally, but no chords were being shaped by fingers being placed on the frets.\n\nTherefore, if the guitar was strummed, it would make no particular chord, so the music it created might be dissonant.\n\nI read everywhere that the music of Sonic Youth was dissonant, sometimes just noise, and I assumed that this was the explanation.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nAn open tuning can be set so that without placing your fingers on any frets, you would play a chord when you strummed all of the open strings.\n\nYou are automatically within a chord or key.\n\nThis makes it relatively easier to create melodies within that key by using your fingers on the frets.\n\nThere is nothing intrinsically dissonant about this approach at all, although it’s possible to set up alternative tunings that just sound unusual or different from what we’re used to.\n\nFor me, just trying to understand this was important, because I didn’t regard Sonic Youth’s music as particularly un-melodic.\n\nI detected melodies, light and shade, and I liked it.\n\nMusic is a relationship between notes. As Thelonious Monk (and/or Art Tatum) said, there are no bum notes. All notes depend on how you resolve them, how they form a consonance with other notes.\n\nI don’t mean that Sonic Youth are all consonance, just that they’re not all dissonance.\n\nTheir music creates a sense of pleasure, even when they utilise dissonance.\n\n\"Looking for a Ride to Your Secret Location\"\n\nA good example of what I [think I] mean is this live version of \"Teenage Riot\" from 2005 (the studio version dates from their 1988 album \"Daydream Nation\"):\n\nSonic Youth - \"Teenage Riot\" (Live - Eurockéennes 2005)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdeTQP...\n\nThis is the song from the start of my review. However, here is a second version:\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x63v...\n\nThe first is the full version with an extended feedback instrumental at the end.\n\nThe second is just the song without the feedback. It seems to be better synchronized as well.\n\n\"Teenage Riot\" is not regarded as typical of Sonic Youth’s music. It uses a traditional verse/chorus structure and lacks much of the feedback they normally use in their songs.\n\nHowever, the extended version of this song has everything.\n\nThis version is so amazing, it confirms my suspicion that it is their equivalent of the Rolling Stones’ \"Satisfaction\" or the Velvet Underground’s \"Sweet Jane\".\n\nIt really is that good a song.\n\nJust observe and enjoy:\n\n• Lee in the left speaker, Thurston in the right (Jim O’Rourke on third guitar in there somewhere as well)\n\n• Lee’s power chords at 1:15 and 1:20\n\n• Steve driving the song the whole way through\n\n• Kim’s frock strap slips off around 1:17\n\n• Kim swaying at 1:30\n\n• Jim O’Rourke on third guitar at 1:40 and 1:50\n\n• Lee letting loose an amazing solo from 2:40 onwards\n\n• Everybody letting loose from 3:53 onwards\n\n• The feedback symphony that starts at 4:50 (in the longer version)\n\nTabs:\n\nHere are some tabs for this song:\n\nhttp://www.911tabs.com/link/?3609096\n\nThurston’s Church Kicker T-shirt:\n\nHere's where you can get a t-shirt like the one Thurston was wearing in that show:\n\nhttp://evolvefish.com/fish/product306...\n\nAustralian Tour:\n\nI saw Sonic Youth play the Enmore Theatre in Sydney on the Australian leg of this tour.\n\nOn the flight back to Brisbane the following day, I realised that the band were on the same plane.\n\nI introduced myself to Thurston and Kim, and said how much I enjoyed the show.\n\nThurston asked me for some advice about bookshops in Brisbane. He was looking for poetry, and I was able to send him off to two shops that might have what he was looking for.\n\nIanHeartKim Dream #9:\n\nKim looked so hot and smart on the plane, and I promised to email her if they ever broke up as a couple.\n\nOf course, I've been tempted to follow up on my promise, since I learned that they had actually parted company.\n\nI'm older than Thurston, but younger than Kim. I don't know if this matters.\n\nTo be honest, I'm afraid I mightn't be brainy enough for her. No other woman has ever fallen for my intellect before, so why would she?\n\nAfter a lot of cogitation and other big words, I drew a picture of Kim instead and I placed it in a prominent place in my Sonic Youth shrine.\n\nIn the meantime, I try to enhance my intellect by reading difficult novels and hanging around anybody on GoodReads who lives in Manhattan or maybe Brooklyn at a pinch (as long as they like Don DeLillo and/or Paul Auster and/or Siri Hustvedt).\n\nI figure they must be really smart, if they can afford the rent.\n\nI hope you like my drawing. You're the only one I've showed it to.\n\nI'm not very good at fingers, but neither is Matt Groening.\n\nThe tits are all right (if you don't mind me paraphrasing Lisa Cholodenko).\n\nSoundtrack Part II (\"You're Perfect in the Way, a Perfect End Today\")\n\nOK, now, stop for a moment and watch and listen to this video:\n\nSonic Youth - \"Sugar Kane\" (Live - Jools Holland Show '92)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hwbhd...\n\nAnother classic, also in the vein of \"Sweet Jane\".\n\nUntil finding the live version of \"Teenage Riot\" on YouTube, I probably would have said this was my favourite Sonic Youth song and possibly one of my top three songs of the nineties.\n\nLee plays guitar with Steve’s chopsticks at 3:25.\n\nYeah, OK, that’s dissonance.\n\nSoundtrack Part III (\"Time Takes Its Crazy Toll\")\n\nOne more song for your listening pleasure:\n\nSonic Youth - \"Diamond Sea\" (Live)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x8jpQ...\n\nA more atmospheric use of feedback and effects on a seven minute live version of a song from their 1995 album, \"Washing Machine\".\n\nThe alternative studio versions were 19 and 25 minutes long.\n\n[image error]\n\n\"Everybody’s Sound is Round It\"\n\nApart from their music, the most significant characteristics of Sonic Youth are their longevity and their influence (what David Browne calls their \"senior statesman\" role).\n\nThe band formed in 1981 and existed continuously until at least November, 2011, when Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon broke up their personal relationship, which was as old as the band itself (thirty years).\n\nAs at mid-2012, the band is on hiatus, although some members and fans are confident that they’ll reform and release new music within the foreseeable future.\n\nSonic Youth were a big influence on Kurt Cobain and Nirvana and were instrumental in getting them a deal with DGC Records (David Geffen Company Records) in 1990, only to see them eclipse their commercial success almost immediately with \"Nevermind\".\n\nThe band also kickstarted Beck’s career with Geffen.\n\n\"I Remember Our Youth, Our High Ideals\"\n\nSonic Youth never enjoyed the popularity and commercial success of other bands that joined them under the label \"alternative rock\" in the early 1990’s.\n\nThey almost seemed to be too individualistic to be swept up in the wave that brought some bands a modicum of commercial success.\n\nThe band always seemed to be one generation older, one step ahead and one step to the left of their peer group.\n\nIt’s ironic that the subtitle of the book is \"Sonic Youth and the Rise of the Alternative Nation\".\n\nThere is no explanation of the term \"Alternative Nation\" in the book. How widely was it ever used on the street? Was it just a commercial label for a TV show about the music? Does it imply that there was a nation of indie fans within the USA? Why does it sound so restricted to America, instead of reaching out to Canada, the UK, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand?\n\nWhatever the merits of the term, if you didn’t know better, you would assume that Sonic Youth were part of the rise of this Alternative Nation.\n\nHowever, within the body of the book, it soon becomes clear that the band stood part from the rise, and the rise occurred without them.\n\nTheir fortunes stood opposed to the rise of the other bands. They missed out.\n\nThey were in the slow lane and they were overtaken.\n\n\"You Can Buy Some More and More and More and More\"\n\nThe book charts the decline in their record sales from a peak of around 300,000 to 70,000 copies by the time of \"Rather Ripped\".\n\nOf the fans who bought \"Dirty\", only one in four would buy \"Murray Street\", \"Sonic Nurse\", \"Rather Ripped\" or \"The Eternal\".\n\nWhen you speculate on their total record sales and the income they could have generated from sales, you have to question how a band of at least four members could survive financially in Manhattan.\n\nIt’s difficult to see how they could have generated enough revenue from playing live and selling merchandising to make a decent living.\n\n\"I Hope It Works Out My Way\"\n\nWithin this financial context, the book has little to trumpet about the success of Sonic Youth.\n\nThe main sense of \"accomplishment\" is the simple fact that they [have] stayed together for so long, despite not making much money.\n\nMost, if not all, other bands would have fallen apart from the financial pressures, especially once band members got married, bought a home and had kids who needed to be raised and educated.\n\nThis is the subject that needs to be examined, but isn’t.\n\n\"Everybody Wants to be Proud to Choose\"\n\nSonic Youth formed in an era within popular culture when artistic integrity was valued and bands weren’t seen as commodities or brands within a market economy.\n\nTo accept an offer from a major label was to \"sell out\", an accusation that was made against Sonic Youth when they joined David Geffen’s label.\n\nUltimately, Sonic Youth fought for the right to make their music exactly the way they envisaged it for the whole of their career.\n\nUnlike punk musicians before them, there was an expectation that they could make a living out of their creativity.\n\nUnfortunately, as popular culture and commerce changed around Sonic Youth, fewer and fewer people cared enough about the music the band wanted to make to spend money on acquiring it.\n\nTo the extent that any popular culture is an act of communication, they communicated with less and less people.\n\nI don’t want to suggest that they became egotistical or self-absorbed in the pursuit of their musical vision. However, one way or another, the band and their audience went separate ways.\n\nThey pushed the envelope and nobody was there to fill it full of cash and return it to the sender.\n\nThey asserted their integrity, they exercised their freedom, they made a choice, they were proud of their choice, but their financial return was commensurate with the limits of an audience of their own making.\n\n\"Hits Are For Squares\"\n\nThe name of a recent compilation reveals their attitude to the concept of Hits:\n\nHere is the \"Hits Are For Squares\" Press Release:\n\nhttp://www.contactmusic.com/press/son...\n\nNote which artists selected which tracks for the compilation.\n\nPerhaps, Sonic Youth were less interested in the size of their audience than having the right audience.\n\nHowever, by taking this approach, they took the risk that they might not have the right size audience.\n\n\"Where'd You Get Your Light, Your Smilin' Sugar Life?\"\n\nIt’s arguable that nobody is out there making music like this anymore, that fans too have changed in what they are seeking, that they are less patient with labels like “Alternative Music” or “Alternative Nation” and the implied attempts to build sub-cultures around a taste or a genre.\n\nIf anything, fans, consumers, just see these terms as marketing labels.\n\nSonic Youth also came from a generation that was equally comfortable producing or consuming music, art, photography, film, literature, fashion. They were polymorphous in their interests. They were true Renaissance men and women.\n\nHowever, it’s questionable whether the marketing machine that attempts to drive sales of today’s cultural commodities can handle such polymorphism, at least until, like Lady Gaga, an artist reaches a pinnacle of success that allows them to diversify.\n\nThe only hope is that this type of independent artist will find an audience intuitively on the internet.\n\nDavid Browne hints, without actually saying it, that Sonic Youth are some kind of role model for a different way of making music.\n\nPart of me wants to agree with him, but then part of me believes that he is being too sentimental.\n\nBecause music is such a physically demanding activity (unlike for example writing), there is a real risk that being in a band will continue to be something that people do in their youth and end up moving on to a “real job”.\n\nOnly the very lucky (not necessarily the very talented) will make enough money from their creativity to sustain a lifestyle for the rest of their lives.\n\nMost, if they’re any good at all, will shine brightly for a moment in time, or perhaps a few moments, but few will enjoy a \"smilin’ sugar life\".\n\nI’m just grateful that Sonic Youth shone so brightly for as long as they did, and that the best minds of my generation were not destroyed by madness (or drugs).\n\n\"You're Perfect in the Way, a Perfect End Today\"\n\nDecember 27, 2013\n\nThe amount of nerding-out I did over this book was incredible. While there were a few incorrect details that I spotted here and there (and one that stuck out to me so much, I actually sent an email to David Browne - no word back yet, and none expected), overall the writing was incredibly cohesive, and although Browne had conducted interviews with the bands many years prior to taking on this project, his presence in the work was completely invisible. I actually borrowed this book, and have decided it is a vital thing to have in my own book collection, and plan on purchasing my own copy soon - not only can I imagine myself reading it again in a year or two from now, it's a rich pop culture resource, seeing as you cannot have a worthwhile conversation about Sonic Youth without discussing their influences as well. While reading, I found myself desperately wanting to drop the book at times to immediately delve into any number of artists mentioned during one period or another of their career, but putting it down was simply impossible to do. I'm also quite excited to check out Browne's other biography of Jeff Buckley, in a schoolgirl-squee sort of way.\n\nJune 12, 2023\n\nFavori gruplarımdan biri olan Sonic Youth’un en kapsamlı biyografisi sanırım bu kitap. Grubun New York’taki ilk kuruluş günlerinden itibaren tüm yolculuğu hiçbir detay atlamadan anlatılıyor. Yer yer bazı bölümlerini fazla düz buldum. Yani doğru bir anlatımla çok daha iyi anlatabileceğini düşünmediğim değil ama çok önemli de değil. Sonuçta bu bir biyografi kitabı ve amacına ulaşıyor mu, bence ulaşıyor. Grubun hayranıysanız her türlü zevk alarak okumanız garantili. Tabii daha sonrasında Kim Gordon’ın “Girl In A Band” kitabını da okumak şartıyla :)\n\nFebruary 29, 2012\n\nSonic Youth is one of the last bands I would have expected to be the impetus for an excellent biography. They're arty, obscure and almost entirely free of drama, drugs, angst or any of the other typical trappings befitting a book-worthy band.\n\nAll the same, I was in Northampton, Mass. recently, where Sonic Youth's leading couple, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon live (well, former couple - they recently separated after decades of marriage) and I was browsing in this terrific little mom 'n' pop bookstore and I came across David Browne's Goodbye 20th Century, and the spirit just moved me. (Also, it was on sale in hardcover for $10.)\n\nAs if the gods of Sonic Youth were smiling on me for my purchase, not 10 minutes later, I was sitting in a little basement cafe with my girlfriend and her sister, and who should walk by but the man himself, Thurston! We flagged him down and he very kindly signed the book for us.\n\nMoore's easy going reaction to us annoying fans shouting for his autograph in the middle of a crowded restaurant sums up the whole career of Sonic Youth in a nutshell. I've always known he was an awesome, extremely intelligent dude with a great sense of humor and a fervent supporter of underground music and literature, but as I learned from Browne's book, the band as a whole has always operated along a similar vibe, have never been particularly moved by the promise of fame and fortune, and have always done whatever the hell they want, professionally and artistically. As Browne's book makes clear, not only are they an unlikely subject for a biography, they were an unlikely band to have ever achieved the level of success that they did. Actually listening to their music, you can see why: with a few exceptions (the album \"Rather Ripped,\" several individual tracks over dozens of other albums) it's loud, long, meandering, sometimes viciously so. They're obviously extremely unique and talented (Moore especially is one of the most innovative guitarists in history) but they're not particularly \"fun\" to listen to.\n\nStill, Sonic Youth achieved success. They were never quite a household name (though there was a time, amazingly, when major labels thought they could be) but they made enough money to buy houses, to raise families and along the way, they became one of the most revered \"underground\" acts in the world. (I put underground in quotes because though they've always had the spirit of an indie/underground act, they have also released more than half of their music on major labels.)\n\nBrowne's book is great because he makes you realize all this through simply laying down the details of their career, brick by brick. There's nothing flowery about his writing. It's concise and articulate, yet packed with so much information, somehow 400 pages goes by before you know it.\n\nSeptember 1, 2020\n\nWow, what an educational and comprehensive biography. The book boasts solid writing, illumating quotes from the band, and countless factoids that will enrich your listening experience of Sonic Youth to no end. Browne is clearly a shrewd music writer who does his research. I only wish I could have caught more glimpses of Browne's personality! I needed some attitude to liven things up because, at times, this biography begins resembling a history textbook with its lengthy rehashing of time, date, and place. Still, if you're a Sonic Youth fan, you've got to read this book.\n\nFebruary 16, 2010\n\nVery dryly written. It almost hurt to finish.\n\nDecember 6, 2013\n\noverall, this book reads like a very conventional biography but there are enough back-stories & anecdotes to keep fans of SY interested. \"Goodbye 20th Century\" does an effective job at revealing the internal dynamics of the band, which are very interesting & unique. it could have easily glossed over later-period SY but wisely does not. comprehensive & informative, but it seems to lack the compelling prose of \"This Band Could Be Your Life\" & \"Rip It Up & Start It Again\" or the stripped-down academic wonderment & red-hot cultural references of \"Lipstick Traces.\"\n\ndie-hard fans will love this book & those new to Sonic Youth will value \"Goodbye 20th Century\" as a valuable introduction. there is enough information online about discographies & gear lists, so that is demystified, but \"Goodbye 20th Century\" offers a start-to-finish narrative that is worth reading.\n\nit is a good book.\n\nMay 18, 2018\n\nAlthough it took me forever to finish it, I enjoyed reading about SY. Now I need to do the same with their music. I find their music difficult to enjoy, but I admire their lives and work as musicians. The author and various interviewees speculate that although their influence is hard to detect in later bands' music, their commitment to doing music their way is what inspired so many. I dig that.\n\nJanuary 21, 2010\n\nAs biographies of musicians and bands go, this one is no \"Hammer of the Gods.\" David Browne tastefully avoids the clichéd hyperboles of rock journalism and manages to present a detailed and well-rounded portrait of that band that everyone has heard of--but perhaps one that not too many people have actually listened. Admittedly, the story of Sonic Youth is rather boring as far as rock and roll biographies go: no sex, no drugs; no punchouts, walk-outs, and black outs; just rock and roll (and sometimes more, sometimes less).\n\nThe robust story of the band in \"Goodbye 20th Century\" is a nice contrast to the Sonic Youth story as previously told by Michael Azzerad in \"Our Band Could Be Your Life.\" In that book Azzerad portrays Sonic Youth as modern-day indie rock heroes: professionally ambitious, artistically focused, and resolute in all facets of their career. In David Browne's more nuanced biography, culled from many intimate interviews of band members (present and past), friends, associates, and family members, Sonic Youth comes across as less monolithic but a band that is fraught with setbacks, letdowns, and many happy accidents. The two author's contrasting views may very well be due to the stage in the career of Sonic Youth that the story was told. For Azzerad, writing at the end of the 1990s about the handful of iconic of indie rock of the 1980s, the fact that SY broke out (albeit briefly) into the mainstream and have endured for so long (with a major label backing, to boot) is a story in itself. Along with R.E.M., Sonic Youth represent the fortunate few who broke out from the shadows of the independent musicians.\n\nFor Browne, who writes in the period after SY leaves its major label backer Geffen Records (DGC), the band's success isn't entirely triumphant but a series of small growths--artistic, critical and financial--not unlike the tale of the outsider bohemian artist gradually adapting to a middle-class lifestyle. The words of Flaubert resound: Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.\n\nAs the years pile on, a portrait of the band gradually appears in the four principal members: Lee Ranaldo is the nice guy, alpha male who loves to tinker with everything; Thurston Moore is the slightly aloof genius man-child whose various interests and daydreams fuel the band's every move; Kim Gordon is the reserved, de facto \"voice\" of the band who serves as the guardian of \"Sonic Youth\" as an idea, brand and business; and Steve Shelley is the unassuming go-getter whose work ethic mirrors its formation in indie and punk rock and the lone member who seems most closely connected to this day to the band's humble beginnings. Not quite a democracy--after all the band got it's name from Thurston and 1/2 of the band is married to each other--despite disagreements and occasional tensions, you get the sense that this band is decent in all aspects: loyal to their roots, respectful of its own history and influences, generous with its friends and fellow artists, and conscientious and scrupulous in their business dealings.\n\nThe fact that the words \"Sonic Youth\" carries any cultural weight despite having a relatively small audience of people actually listen to them is attributed to the band's greatest strength: that of elevating the band \"Sonic Youth\" as a philosophical ideal that is higher than any individual ambition, monetary or critical success.\n\nTo synthesize the chaos and dregs of his age into a higher ideal, Hegel created the State; fortunately for us, we have Sonic Youth.\n\nFebruary 2, 2019\n\nOkay, I'm writing this a little later than I maybe should have (& am about to start writing some reviews a lot later than I definitely should have), but I'll throw in my main feelings & add anything extra later if it comes to me.\n\nI liked this book because it told the story of Sonic Youth. I got a great history leading up to circa Rather Ripped era & learned a lot, because I really didn't know much. It opened me up to listening to some of their earlier stuff which I'd earlier been afraid of (heathenish acts of the phoney fan, I know). But I had an issue with Browne's writing style. He has no flair, which is no cardinal sin in a biography, but the problem is it seems he thinks he has, & ends up doing things I find silly (example: beginning of Ch5, introduction to Steve Shelley). This doesn't happen too often, but enough to grate on me.\n\nMore noticeably, I find he tries to fit in shit that has no business being fit in - I get the feeling he interviewed some people & almost added some stuff they said in there as some kind of acknowledgement/bread-breaking with them (from memory, an example is towards the end of the Shelley section where they include this quote from his dad - I know this is all vague, but I'm just tryna back myself up with the shifting sand of memory I have at my disposal). Adding to that, there are numerous little things I found ridiculous - especially in the context of my upcoming complaint - like mentioning \"Jim Belushi walked in some night they were playing\" - (this is not an exact quote) - \"& said he'd come back, but he didn't.\" Or later, talking about which execs were at some party, he mentions a bunch of names including \"x may have been there.\" You know, like, a) who gives a shit & b) you're not even sure if he was there. So how could this possibly impact the story of Sonic Youth? It's not a particularly gossipy book, but shit like this doesn't make it seem like it wouldn't have been if Browne could have helped it.\n\n& though those are more stylistic (I guess) choices, my main complaint was the lack of credence given to their solo albums. In the timeline - & the book is generally very linear & chronological - once it got past a certain point, I was like \"Huh, maybe I got my own dates wrong, maybe the solo albums came later\", because they weren't mentioned at all. When Browne's talking about random people who may or may not have been at some party, I figure he's trying to be as inclusive & tell-all as possible, so it's impossible he'd miss actual crucial steps in the growth of the band members such as whole albums they were recording by themselves & what that meant for them, or the band dynamic, right? Wrong. In the last section of the book some of these projects get rather cursory mentions (\"This proved Thurston could make acoustic music after all! Fin.\"), & when I realized this cat just didn't seem to give a shit or understand what this must have meant for the people involved - while he will tell the most mundane - &, yes, sometimes gossipy - stories in earlier sections... I just couldn't believe it.\n\nSo, while I'm spending a lot of time complaining here, I did enjoy the book & did learn a lot. I just obviously have some issues with the way things were handled. & while it's no fault of Browne's, it's a shame we weren't able to get a history all the way up to their dissolution - their story as a band is, for all intents & purposes, now officially over.\n\nFebruary 15, 2009\n\nThis book makes a great counterpart to Alec Foege's now-outdated \"Confusion is Next: the Sonic Youth Story.\" While it doesn't capture the same grimy early-NYC vibe as that book - and frankly, the culture out of which SY sprung is incredibly important to truly \"getting\" the band's origins - it's significantly more comprehensive as a career overview. No element, tour, record, side project, etc. is slighted, with the exception of Made in U.S.A. and a few ephemeral side projects like the Velvet Monkeys and Desperate Teenage Lovedolls, and all of the info in the book is derived from first-hand interviews with everyone in and around the band. Indispensable for SY aficionados.\n\nJuly 18, 2011\n\nNot unlike one excruciatingly-long wikipedia article. It is upsetting to read the relegation of Lee Ranaldo to the back burner, he is truly the brains behind the band. For such interesting music, Sonic Youth certainly have a boring biography. Maybe it was just the author's take on the whole situation, but this offered no insight. The moral of the story: don't sign with an independent label, the major label will screw you over too, if you try to do it on your own - you will also fail. This book could have benefited from more interaction with the members. I can't recommend it. Seriously, just let Sonic Youth remain as this detached mystery, you don't want to read about them changing dirty diapers.\n\nDecember 12, 2008\n\nWell put together with serious, intelligent writing. Browne really shows us the personalities of the band members and how their interpersonal dynamics have coalesced over the years. His commentary on their actual music is not exactly deep or revelatory, but he does cover all of it. The first part of the book is definitely the stronger, as it really gives you a sense of how the outsider music scene in new york in the late 70's and early 80's developed and how a group of people managed to create something approximating an actual community out of the drug-riddled urban wasteland that New York was in that era.\n\nAugust 13, 2011\n\n\"A must for fans\" one review states and this is definitely the case. The most fascinating thing about Sonic Youth is their music, in real life they are just like the rest of us. So if you want sex, drugs and rock n roll I'd recommend Slash's biog as you won't get that here! Personally I really enjoyed this book. I've been rabid fan since 1998 so it's fascinating to see how they came to be and how albums were put together. It's given me a greater appreciation of their music and as a result of reading this I've also re-discovered alternate guitar tunings!!\n\nCracking book from a cracking band. Like their music it's not for everyone but that's why I love them.\n\nJanuary 20, 2009\n\nThere were moments I wished this book had been written by someone less distant and more of a fan, but kudos are due to David Browne for his copious research and meticulous organization. The strongest parts of the book for me are the chapters covering Sonic Youth's formation and early years as well as their more recent projects including everything from their brief collaboration with Jim O'Rourke on. The middle section borders on dull regurgitation of facts, however, there is enough fun information throughout for any fan.\n\nJuly 14, 2008\n\nLike many books of its kind, this suffers from a \"then they recorded this. then they recorded this. then they recorded this...\" repetition. Still, I loved reading about the early years of Sonic Youth, back when Richard Edson was their drummer (long before he played Vito in Do the Right Thing), when Paul Smith was hanging around the band, and before Kim Gordon became an uber-fashionista. A good read about one of the more interesting bands of my time.\n\nJune 11, 2015\n\nCURRENTLY READING REVIEW: I'm rating this 4 stars having only read about 50-60 pages. This book NEEDED to be written. I read \"Confusion is Next\" and wasn't totally thrilled by it because it WASN'T THIS BOOK. I'll be taking this one as slow as the TALKING HEADS book just so I can stretch it out.\n\nREAD REVIEW: This is a MUST for any SY fan out there. So much amazing detail outlined in this thing. Every nook & cranny of their career is laid out. Just a long, fantastic read, worth every page turn.\n\nFebruary 10, 2009\n\nThe major problem with this book is that it dwells on the band's recording career, and what the band could have been (which people are just coming around to). The biographical bits of this book are a minor theme, which I was more interested in.\n\nOverall it's a great read. It's especially fun to steal/borrow/buy the albums as you go along, comparing your impressions of each album with the author's narrative.\n\nApril 2, 2020\n\nA good straight up history of the indie/avant garde rock band.The aesthetic analyses of the music are good, as far as they go. Unfortunately it's very US centric. Browne tends to skate over SY's non-US and indeed non-NYC influences, as well as their broader global impact on the indie scene which has been considerable. Theres nothing about their overseas tours, except of Europe. But as a story of career survival over 30 odd years it's pretty interesting.\n\nFebruary 18, 2021\n\nA comprehensive if somewhat uninspired history of the band which gets less interesting as it goes along. This isn't really Browne's fault- Sonic Youth is a band made up of unassuming musicians who actively avoided rock and roll excess. The most alive the book feels is when Lydia Lunch rampages through it- at last, a character!\n\nBrowne skirts personality analysis and avoids digging deep into the band's dynamics. The book was published before they imploded due to Thurston's infidelity, but there seems to be palpable tension between them in the later stages of their career which Browne alludes to but appears afraid to flesh out. Kim feels particularly shadowy- ever-elusive, there's some fascinating anecdotes about her. My favourites are that she was so quiet during the recording sessions for one of their early albums that she was only able to communicate with the producer by smiling, and that several New York hipsters have had nightmares in which they embarrassed themselves in front of her by saying something uncool.\n\nBrowne does a good job of narrating the band's trajectory from no-wave outcasts to indie heroes, next-best-things, major label flops and, finally, a low-key, self-contained unit. I enjoyed his writing on the music, although sometimes found him to be a little forceful in his opinions.\n\nRecommended for fans.\n\nMay 12, 2020\n\nAfter a college show back in the early 2000s, a member of the audience came up to me and said our band sounded like Sonic Youth. I had no idea who Sonic Youth was at the time and I wouldn't for a quite a few years. I am not sure why this book or this band took so long to ever check out. In a way, I'm disappointed it took this long to explore.\n\nAt any rate, this book was a great view in the world of Sonic Youth and highly recommend it to anyone interested in pop culture, music, or art. Great perspective into the way things shook out. After reading this book, I am left with hoping that maybe I can have an impact like they did at some point in my own life.\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nEasy to love if you're a Sonic Youth fan. Easily my favorite band so it was a very enjoyable read. I nerded out to this and went back and listened to the albums as I read through their respective chapters. I wish there were more details about the songs, like the lyrics and inspiration behind them. There were some but they were mostly already widely known among fans.\n\nI'm a big fan of little bits of trivia that are interesting but not that important overall, like for example, Kim's favorite song from Daydream Nation is The Sprawl and Silver Rocket is Thurston's, but that wasn't in the book.\n\nI still recommend it though!\n\nDecember 23, 2020\n\nProbably the best band biography I ever read. This book is packed with facts, there's something for everyone - fashion nerds, guitar geeks etc. - and it's really fun to read. I am not a hardcore SY fan, but I was super excited reading it.\n\nTop fact learned: Ranaldo went to buy new Dylan album that was out on September 11, 2001, right after terrorist attack and collapse of Twin Towers.\n\nTop mistake: \"Kiev, Russia\". Future editions should make up for poor geography of the author.\n\nJuly 31, 2021\n\nI didn’t start listening to Sonic Youth until around the time this book was written, so I appreciated reading the whole backstory of their career as most of it was new information for me. Good overview of record label tribulations, the individual contributions of the musicians, and how they’ve followed their own unique path (and they still do as solo artists, I might add).\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\ni LOVE sonic youth and thought this was a really good biography! however, i did think that sometimes it could drag, especially in the beginning. it spends a lot of time in their early era where they were still very undefined as a band, which can get dull. but once it got really got started, i loved it!\n\nDecember 5, 2017\n\nreally informative for someone who only had a surface level knowledge of the band, just a shame it ended before things REALLY got interesting in the band... very well written and i appreciate that it didn't take too long to get stuck into things. a respectable bio.\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nFairly journalistic-styled comprehensive story of Sonic Youth (though ending before the ultimate finish of their journey as a band). A lot of information, some of it somewhat superfluous, but interesting nonetheless."
