        "text": "With the rise of populist movements of various kinds, racism has become one of the key issues debated in the present. This piece stresses the need to recognise racism as a part of the wider social and cultural contexts that populist movements operate within in Nordic countries and beyond. Populist movements’ claims of not being racist gain legitimacy through discourses of race and difference that are generally not recognised as racist but seen as constituting common-sense knowledge that creates an alternative world where racist claims seem to make sense. The article discusses this through three points of emphasis: everyday racism and racist exceptionalism; the idea of prior immobility; and the continued existence of structural racism. Finally, the discussion focuses on this alternative world from the perspective of debates about migration revolving essentially around future anticipation, which become particularly salient during times of crisis.\n\nInternationally, it has been well documented that refugees and asylum seekers are portrayed as one of Europe’s greatest threats, which intersects strongly with stereotypes about Muslim men. Our discussion focuses on asylum seekers in Iceland in 2015-2017 and their experiences of racism. The analysis shows that asylum seekers experienced racism in Iceland, but that this racism becomes overshadowed by their precarious position as asylum seekers. Our analysis of racism and asylum seekers in Iceland is based on an intersectional perspective that stresses how racism has to be seen as existing in conjunction with other identifications and identities. In our case, the intersection of racism with the position of vulnerability is particularly important, i.e., the vulnerability that these individuals experience when categorized as asylum seekers. As we stress, the asylum seekers’ dismissal of racism signifies the intense insecurity that they live under and the structural violence that they become subjected to from state and border policies.\n\nÁ síðastliðnum árum hefur fólk á flótta orðið sýnilegra á margvíslegan hátt. Greinin bendir á brotalamir sem oft má sjá í umræðunni um fólk á flótta og innflytjendur þar sem m.a. er gengið út frá því að Evrópa hafi lengi verið aðskilin frá umheiminum og eingöngu núna sé fólk að færa sig milli heimshluta. Undirstrikað er hvernig flokkun fólks í náttúrugerða hópa, eins og flóttamaður og hælisleitandi, getur falið í sér afmennskun og einföldun á aðstæðum þeirra. Greinin nálgast þetta viðfangsefni út frá sögum þriggja einstaklinga sem hafa flúið frá erfiðum aðstæðum í heimalandi sínu Níger og búa í Brussel í Belgíu, en speglar einnig efnið út frá íslenskri umræðu. People migrating to Europe in search for a new life have become increasingly visible in various ways for the last few years. The article stresses some of the weaknesses in discussions on migration to Europe, where it is often assumed that migration from the outside world has only recently been affecting Europe. The article emphasizes how classifications of people into categories such as „refugee“ and „immigrant“ and the naturalization of these categories, can lead to dehumanization and stark simplifications. The article approaches this through stories of three men in Brussels, Belgium who have fled difficult circumstances in their home country Niger. It also explores these issues from some Icelandic discussions.\n\nIn Europe, increased precarity characterises the lives of many people, making crisis-talk especially appealing as a framing mechanism to naturalise anti-migration policies within the EU. In 2020–2021, the EU and the Spanish government proclaimed a migration crisis and immobilised in dehumanising conditions a few thousand African migrants who had just arrived in the Canary Islands. This action was facilitated by narratives of migrant invasion and the view of Europe as a space of formality. This article asks what kinds of speculation the proclamation of a migration crises creates and who is doing the speculating. We stress that the term ‘speculation’ is based strongly on temporalities involving the creation of value by future predictions in uncertain circumstances. Using the Canary Islands as an example, we use this future-oriented understanding of speculation to emphasise that different actors, and not only financial ones, also imagine and act on the future as a sort of infraspeculation. While not losing sight of how the latter differs from financial speculation, it is important to highlight the diverse forms of agency in relation to migration within a quite complex changing policy and ­crisis-management environment.\n\nMainstream discourses of migration and populist voices tend to be based on assumed distance between European subjects and migrant populations, disfiguring historical connections through time. This makes the excavation of Europe’s racist and imperial history particularly important as an intervention. The essay focuses on a bust collection in El Museo Canario in Gran Canaria, bought from France in the late nineteenth century, positioning the busts as folded objects in Amade M’charek’s sense. The unfolding exposes stories of an extensive global past where racism and imperialism are central components, in addition to not only hinting at the importance of race science in Europe, but also how areas on the margins of Europe could better insert themselves into larger narratives of modernization through their participation in scientific racism."
