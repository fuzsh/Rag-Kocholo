I know that writing review after 3 episodes is indecent but who cares.\n\nSo let's get straight to the point, this season sucks now and will suck when it reaches 12 episodes. Kazuya is absolutely the worst main character ever created and I just wonder why this anime hasn't got fantasy tag, because there is no way that 4 females which I would describe as extremely sexually appealing have interest in probably the worst kind of man. Kazuya has an iq equivalent to ... monkey but monkey acts in a more mature way than he is. His overthinking everything literally makes me wanna drop this \"show\". 3 weeks ago when 1st episode aired I decided that I will do a push up every time I find something cringe or pathetic, and guess what, now I could participate in Mr. Olympia.\n\nI wouldn't recommend watching second season because nothing has changed so far and I guarantee that it won't, so if you have already watched the first season, find something that is worth spending time on.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nKanokari really pissed people off when it first came out, but given my exhaustion with oversensitive outrage culture, I completely failed to take the outcry seriously. I only watched season one after it ended, and only then did I realize how badly I missed out. With that said, though, I’m also kinda glad I missed out, because writing for season two means I no longer have to waste time introducing the story and characters, since the audience is already familiar with the premise. And gosh…what a premise… Kanokari, morally, is utterly repugnant, and while that fact really upset me when I first started watching it, ... I later came to unironically enjoy it, not merely as a guilty pleasure to mock myself for enjoying, but as an actual anime. Given the amount of debauchery real people engage in, at times and in some countries, shamelessly in broad fucking daylight, I personally think there isn’t that much comparatively wrong with being a prostitute or engaging in prostitution if that’s what the pair in question seriously wants to do. What I do find something wrong with is attempting to derive, or presenting it to others as if they should attempt to derive, a positive, stable, forward-looking relationship from the position of a prostitute/client relationship. I mean, I’m not sure I particularly care for the idea of prostitution either way, but what I specifically don’t care for regarding this show is the implication that everything going on is totally innocuous, no one is going to be seriously damaged, and there are no long-term negative consequences. Frankly, girls, you should just do it. Open an OnlyFans today, or better yet, become a professional camwhore on Twitch. There really are no drawbacks. Just ask the women who’ve been stalked across international borders, or the men who’ve sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into parasocial non-relationships. The understanding of these emotionally complex, postmodern social devices is just far too simplistic in the mind of this author, and the manner in which he depicts them I would argue is actively misleading and bad for modern youth. It’s encouraging, or at least tacitly endorsing bad behavior in a way that it doesn’t really need to, and while, luckily, it does suggest via Chizuru that no one really could, should, or would operate like this for long in a perfect world, and those involved should always be trying to decouple and break away (literally the plot of the show), it isn’t direct enough with its messaging, and it excuses itself far too often.\n\nThroughout season one, I was holding myself back from moving to Tokyo, calling the police, and getting this fucking guy arrested. I was admittedly drinking a little bit, but I still don’t think an anime has had me cursing and seething this much since I had to sit through however many episodes of fucking Rottenmeier in Alps no Shoujo Heidi, because—I’m sorry—this is pure fucking DEGENERATE shit. This is encouraging young men to pay for prostitutes with Daddy’s money and catch feelings. This is advice that, if heeded, WILL hurt real, vulnerable, naive people in the real world, and it WILL jeopardize their relationships and careers, both academic and professional. It remains true that the show itself recognizes this is no foundation for a healthy relationship whatsoever, but the messaging still is never direct enough nor does it ever stop excusing its bad actors. Ruka makes public spectacle of drama, cries like a petulant little brat, commits blackmail, and gets exactly what she wants; Kazuya and Chizuru use lies to manipulate the emotions of their elderly and/or dying grandmothers, and that works out swimmingly; Kazuya is caught stalking the woman he (allegedly) loves, and she rewards him with a Christmas present; Kazuya gets a part-time job to pay for prostitutes because his parents’ allowance money wasn’t enough to sustain his spending, and this newfound time commitment doesn’t seem to endanger his education at all; I could go on. I went to great lengths in my failed Mushoku Tensei review to explain how “some fiction are about morals, they’re about learning a lesson and watching role model characters, and others are not. [Mushoku Tensei] is very much in the later category…” Kanokari, however, is very much in the former category. It’s about watching a confused, indecisive young man to whom the target audience can heavily relate learn to (very fucking) slowly but (I assume) surely learn to grow a spine and commit to a relationship with the one he loves. Therefore, since it’s untimely trying to demonstrate self-betterment, the themes and suggestions it presents to its audience should be appropriate and virtuous enough to be presented in front of—and effectively taught to—its impressionable target audience. But this is not at all the case. Indeed, as described, it is very much the opposite. It tacitly endorses all the bad behavior listed above and more, and going beyond even that, what it chooses to actively and openly endorse is sometimes absolutely fucking wild.\n\nI had always imagined that the big turning point in Kanokari’s torturously stagnant, snail-paced narrative would be the inevitable moment when the author finally found the courage to have Kazuya see Chizuru on a date with another man. I envisioned him losing his composure, grabbing her by the arms, and telling her, “I want you to myself. I love you. Quit this prostitution shit and stay with me.” I know—as if a fucking anime protagonist would ever say something that manly—but I wasn’t simply wrong. What happened was the EXACT opposite, because he felt NOTHING. Zero. He’s just like, “Ooo, no! We gotta get out of here before my friends see and my giant fucking pathological spider web of lies finally comes constricting down on my fucking throat, strangling me to death in my own sin and degeneracy! lol Whoopsie daisy!” I seriously don’t want young people to consume this and think human beings work this way, because it’s going to give them bad ideas about society. Kazuya’s reaction to seeing Chizuru with Umi on Christmas was so fucking warped, because he seemed to be suggesting that if it was a “rental date” then everything would be fine and dandy, but if this romantic Christmas rendezvous was Chizuru’s “real boyfriend” then, ooooh no, that would be devastating. BUT THERE’S NO TANGIBLE FUCKING DIFFERENCE! Sure, incels, she might fuck her boyfriend, whereas her clients aren’t allowed to touch her without *at least in theory* getting themselves in trouble with the law, but that doesn’t change the fact this line of work fucks with the psychology of everyone involved. The peak example of this comes when this fucking guy literally PIMPS OUT his girlfriend! Pimping HAPPENED in this anime, and they did it TO SOLVE A PROBLEM! “Sumi is shy and can’t talk to people. That sucks. Oh, wait! I know! We could teach her how to be an outgoing rental girlfriend! Hey, Kazuya, (guy I like) how about you go cuck me and spend the day with this softy, huh? Warm her up to the touch of a man, will ya?” Hard cut to the next episode, and they’ve started normalizing cuckoldry! But hey?! What’s the problem? I know throughout all of human history people weren’t exactly thrilled about people fucking their significant other, but we’re past that. It’s 2022. It’s time to let other bitches fuck YOUR man. So stop being a fucking bigot and embrace the times. Thus, Chizuru, being the progressive woman that she is, sends Kazuya off to Sumi and opens her legs—I mean opens her heart to Kuribayashi.\n\nThe ultimate cherry on top, the final chef’s kiss to complete all this contemptible debauchery was at the end of the OP, because we get through our delightful ninety seconds of all these romantic situations, and then the camera just pans down to a fucking check. A fucking BILL for like hundreds of dollars worth in yen, and it just left me stunned, because…what on Earth is happening here?! The commodification of love?! Does human interaction mean NOTHING to these people?! Does it all just boil down to dollars and cents?! Seeing that made me angry, but even more than that, it made me worried, because the viewers watching this need to be pulled aside and told, “This isn’t good. This is bad. Please don’t operate your lives like this.” I’m sorry, but it doesn’t hurt to stress this somewhat excessively. PLEASE, because the target audience here should not be led astray like this. They need to be protected from these suggestions, because they….well, you know…they’re just not that…well…nevermind. I don’t want this review getting deleted. Anyway, by the time I got to season two and had come around to appreciating the little bits of heart and soul the series had to offer, I was much less outraged by the immortality of it all. I mean, that still didn’t necessarily eliminate my reaction to any of it, but it was less shocking. Throughout the second season, I was still continuously compelled to verbally lament, “This is a man who cheats on women.” He’ll be doing something that in any other context would seem utterly sleazy and manipulative, but which is now attempting to be written off as acceptable because of this whole rental girlfriend scheme…which is itself completely unacceptable when they’re involving this much obvious emotion and boundary-pushing, not to mention more deeply intertwining people like Sumi who is far too pure and innocent to safety and healthily work as a prostitute. I’ll just be watchin’ a scene, sippin’ blackberry moonshine like a fucking Greek philosopher, and have to pause the episode, recoil in disgust, and mutter under my breath, “Ugh, what a fuckin’ scum motherfucker…” Ruka is over here like, “Don’t you feel bad asking me to let you cheat?” And he’s like, “It’s not cheating, though!” Implying rental date =/= “real” date, and I’m just bottling up screams, BECAUSE IT DOES! You’re leading this chick on while lusting after some other woman! You are a scumbag who thinks with his dick and has no appreciation for the emotions of the women in his life!\n\nThe best scene to discuss as a segue into season two is also the scene which first started winning me over, the scene which first suggested the show had at least some modicum of intelligence about itself, and the scene which, I think many would agree, simply contained the best writing of the entire first season. This of course is the scene in episode twelve where Mami, having finally figured out about this whole rental girlfriend scheme, takes Chizuru on a date, and the way this was presented, to me at least, felt like real, convincing, not-the-kind-of-thing-you-typically-see-in-highschool-anime drama. When I finally stop talking about themes and emotions and actually at some point begin discussing the plot, I’ll be sure to spend time talking about the comedically ridiculous, parody-level coincidences and contrivances that happen constantly throughout the series, and this was the first scene to truly break that mold, because this is the kind of shit a vindictive ex-girlfriend would actually do. She would stalk Twitter feeds and shit, get in on the gossip, spot certain people spending time together at certain social destinations, put two and two together, and take it upon herself to utterly humiliate the current girlfriend as much as she possibly could for no one’s satisfaction but her own. The scene also works thematically, because, dear reader, if being a rental girlfriend is just a job and nothing to feel funny about, then why does Chizuru feel so claustrophobic in the karaoke parlor with Mami, and why does she feel so grossed out by the things Mami is asking her to do? She’s just singing karaoke, right? Wrong, she’s selling her dignity to someone who’s forcing her to do things she doesn’t want to do and presenting herself as if she’s not feeling the emotions that she’s actually feeling—AND THAT’S NOT NORMAL. The scene perfectly exposed the corrupt and dangerous nature of the rental girlfriend profession to perhaps its greatest advocate in the series while simultaneously forcing me to appreciate that for all its ridiculousness and all its shortcomings, this series had at least one solid cast member. Mami, simply put, is an extremely relatable and believable character. I had noticed this long before that scene, but certain things she would do had always struck me as strikingly well-characterized. I’ve cited this example time and time again, but watching her was like watching Light Yagami twirl his pen around his thumb while contemplating deeper thoughts during class.\n\nObviously, twirling your pen around your thumb is a sort of habitual nervous tick which many people have developed; it’s not like I thought up until that point that I was the only human being on planet Earth who ever twirled their pen around their thumb in school. But when I first watched Death Note, I was a teenager with a superiority complex just as Light was, and seeing him do that while I was in the process of doing it myself, neglecting the homework on my desk, twirling my pen around as I seriously entertained his utopian ideals in my head…I can’t even describe how surreal of a feeling that was, and seeing some of the things Mami did throughout season one of Kanokari came close to giving me similar feelings. All the moments of Yuuki Aoi sounding completely emotionless and dead inside, all the shots of Mami peeling off away from the friend group to go stand in a corner somewhere and anonymously type angry shit online. She just had so many real-feeling moments of, “Oh, I have done exactly that at some point in my life.” Mami just stood out to me as this socially unhinged BPD psycho bitch that I could really see myself in, and while other characters are certainly less inspiring and much more anime-like—*cough* Sumi—Kanokari still does a better than average job at presenting bits of characterization most other anime of its type simply would not. I mean, even the mere admission that a girl could or would put on a romantic act to earn money from lonely virgins is itself fairly daring when you think about how committed most romcom are to the pure, 100% escapist school of anime writing. While aforementioned characters who stand out as particularly unrealistic definitely fuck with this balance a little bit—*cough* Sumi—it still does a lot for my immersion and my willingness to invest in the main cast when there is a clear and distinct difference between Chizuru as a rental girlfriend and Chizuru as her genuine self, both in animation and in her voice actress’s performance. The character who simultaneously makes and breaks the show is of course everyone’s favorite clinical retard, Kazuya, because as soon as season two kicks off, we’re made to appreciate what I assume is going to be the status quo forevermore: the more honest he and Chizuru are with themselves about the fact that they like each other, the less honest they are with one another, and therefore the more weird fucking shit they do to divert from a direct confession.\n\nThe problem with Kazuya is I suppose quite typical, it’s just the excruciating pacing and mind-numbingly stupid contrivances which have become the infamous hallmarks of Kanokari simply make his issues out to be more frustrating than they might be under other, similar circumstances. Kazuya is your average, inexperienced, weak young man; he is a boy with no spine whatsoever who consistently allows both his male and female peers to walk all over him; and, crucially, he is true to form in that if you provide him with even the slightest hint of pussy, then he is on that shit like a fucking police dog. This is all, of course, very much to his own disservice, because any time he stands up for himself or appears even somewhat decisive for even a second, all the women are like, “Wha-woah! D-do I actually like this guy???” I like this approach, because not only does it serve as a lovely lesson to teach its target audience how to act desirably around the opposite sex, but it successfully depicts to the audience why Kazuya’s wavering levels of decisiveness are frustrating to us AND the characters in the story, thereby lending itself some right to call itself self-aware. You see, this guy would do all the things he does and make all the concessions me makes for ANY girl, but no girl wants a guy who would put himself out for ANY girl. They want a guy who would put themselves out for just them—who’s gonna stand up for you, not that other bitch. If you go watch full-on harem anime, the main guy is always presented as being platonically nice to every girl so he doesn’t come across as some weird man-whore, but he’s still nevertheless presented as being able to get all the girls to love him merely by showing these acts of kindness alone—which is fucking stupid, escapist, porno bullshit for reasons we just discussed. Real girls want real attention, not simply platitudinous Mr. Nice Guy shit, so applying this harem logic to a romcom which is trying to take itself somewhat seriously, with female love interests which are for the most part—*coughs* Sumi—characterized believably, is what I would say primarily makes viewers of Kanokari understandably want to tear their fucking eyes out. Seeing Kazuya say or do anything decisive or committed in any form or fashion is such a breath of fresh air, but then it’s choked out of your lungs when the author decides, actually, maybe a hundred, maybe even two hundred, maybe even three hundred more chapters of torture are in order, so buckle up.\n\nKanokari is a perfect example of a series which is absolutely fine at being exactly what it’s trying to be, it’s just that what it’s trying to be is a mega generic romcom based on a long-running, cash cow manga…which is honestly, above everything else, my biggest single complaint with the series as a whole. It’s yet another anime that feels like it’s based on a manga that was very intentionally designed to last forever. I said this back when I first watched season one two years ago, and I’ll say it again now: there was never any hope that this season was going to reach any kind of satisfying resolution. I don’t know if its popularity will be sustained for future seasons; I won’t read the manga; the final episode does not leave you with any ultimate catharsis whatsoever; and while there might be slight progress and trivial drama which we can discuss endlessly, nothing here is gonna leave any particular impression. At the end of season one, Kazuya does the, “I love you!…………(credits roll and you think real progress was finally made)…………(after credits scene starts)…………uuuuuuuhhh but just as a rental lmao!” And you’re like, “Oh, okay. I don’t know why I’m surprised by that one. I’m gonna go drink bleach, hang myself, and slit my wrists all at the same time. Thanks, anime.” But in episode two of season two, he tells her straight up, “The real you is my ideal woman.” Period. No notes. He just says it outright, and here we fucking are ten episodes later and the misunderstandings are still running strong. Like, the amount of willful ignorance or sheer, diagnosable mental retardation these insufferable children must be afflicted by at this point is through the fucking moon. If you do as I did and simply invest in the characters no matter what fuckshit the story throws their way—or directly your way for that matter—then most of the contrivance nonsense is all stuff that, if you turn your brain off, very easily becomes ignorable white noise that quickly fades into the background. However, no matter the expertise with which I was able to incrementally sip my moonshine to keep a consistent buzz, there was some moments throughout both seasons that were simply too much, and I could feel the alcoholic implosion of my brain significantly accelerated by sheer anime absurdity. I feel now is a good time to warn you that not only did I watch this series consistently buzzed, but also at a leisurely 1.6x speed, so if you watch with neither, then your milage may vary drastically.\n\nMy first complete and total breaking point was back in episode six of season one when Ruka firsts shows up, because she arrives on the scene with nerdy, bucktooth, glasses boy and is obviously WAY out of his league. She then accuses Chizuru of being a rental girlfriend, makes herself wildly suspicious by even knowing about rental girlfriends in the first place, AND brings this accusation up to people who are themselves engaging in the practice, and yet they somehow fail to IMMEDIATELY realize she, too, was a rental girlfriend, and that shit blew my fucking mind. That was so beyond outrageously retarded that I was at that moment convinced this was all on purpose. Again, the show is absolutely littered with little plot holes and coincidences that break it from the ground up—things as basic as Chizuru’s double lifestyle not having been found out by every single fucking person in Tokyo, a point which is, in the case of her Ichinose persona, literally backed up by Superman “just Clark Kent with glasses lol who could that possibly be” Logic—but rarely does it hit you with impossible-to-ignore absurdities such as that. It’s riddled with little things, like, “Oh, they just happened to show up there at that time? What a coincidence!” Or, “Oh, they just happened to run into them a this spot? What a coincidence!” Or, “Oh, this person just happened to be right there in earshot or line of sight to them doing this thing that concerns the former in this way and now drama this drama that? W-w-what a coincidence!” All the excuses given by the show to handwave particular contrivances are fucking laughable and don’t make any sense, so if you’re the type of person who can’t really get into, “Okay, this show is pretty trashy. I’m just gonna turn my brain off and get out of it what I know I personally can get out of it.” Then I’d recommend saving your sanity and watching another, much smarter anime. And, now that we’re fast approaching the final paragraph of this monstrosity of a review, I’m slowly realizing the position I’ve put myself in—that of somewhat standing in defense of an anime which every thinking individual seems to rightly despise for many good reasons, all of which I’ve acknowledged and even criticized myself, but none of which I’ve even attempted to outright justify at all—and I’m struggling to find the answer to the question, “How and why did I enjoy watching this show again?” Because, I’m gonna be honest here, the answer isn’t coming to me easily.\n\nThis is as good of an adaptation of whatever its adapting as it probably could be, and I don’t think I need to read the manga to say that. There isn’t a whole lot of animation, but the gorgeous character designs and stylish costume designs lend themselves perfectly to the series’ stellar artwork. The author clearly wants you to think these girls are worth money—which, hey, I guess many of them literally are—and he was successful. The colors and backgrounds are solid, and the music is great, especially those in-character insert songs the voice actresses sang for. And if the obvious outpouring of effort wasn’t enough to convince you this production had some soul, I now take this time to direct you to the fucking *zawa zawa* Kaiji reference in season two. Like, wtf?! What teenager watching this trash is going to understand or even catch that??? It’s just one of those baseline inclusions that makes you say, “Well, okay, at least the people making this clearly cared.” But this is all fluff, really, because what truly got me to sink my teeth into this was all that juicy, bloody, red meat shit. That feeling when you see another woman’s purse in your ex-boyfriend’s apartment; that feeling when you imagine your ex-girlfriend hooking up with some bigger, hotter, manlier guy; that feeling when you have to talk to the guy you like the morning after you heard another girl at his place; the feeling of your girlfriend, who you’re not that serious about, having a family who truly trusts you to look after their daughter, or granddaughter in this case. The evolution we see from last season, where Chizuru kicked Kazuya off of her in the hospital bed with that big, over-the-top anime reaction, to this season, where he falls on top of her in an equally retarded fan-service set-up, yet, this time, she instead looks to him vulnerably and tells him to get off in a demure, understated voice, letting him make the choice himself. Realizing Ruka bought condoms, or seeing her force herself on Kazuya because she knows she’s losing the emotional race. Getting wrapped up in the late-night Gossip Girl shit, the drama, investing in the competition, being fucking disgusted with Kazuya; it’s all part of the process. I love allowing myself to get invested in trash like this just so it can frustrate me and force my cold, dead, icy heart to feel literally anything other than passivity and dejection, which I guess answers the question posited at the end of the previous paragraph. I wanted to rewatch and seriously engage with it, so I could sift though all this nonsense and see how much of it was dumb smut, and how much of it actually had a little amateur bit to say about relationships and love. I just made sure to leave myself an out to excuse all my actions as being self-aware, since I never hesitated even for a second to point and laugh…even though I still consciously allowed myself to invest in something undeniably low-brow, because fuck you. I’m lonely and felt like it.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nLet's all be honest here, no one really thinks this is an all-time great romance anime. This plays around the harem genre with very cute girls with very distinct personalities. The story itself is pretty poor, just a random dude randomly getting attractive girls to flock towards him because he's the MC. For that, the story is a 3 in my eyes.\n\nI don't particularly like the MC either, he's like a middle-schooler living a college life (aka he's just really immature and pretty dumb). I feel the same way for all the girls in the show as well besides the main girl, Chizuru, who ... seems to actually have a purpose in life besides wanting to date the MC.\n\nI remember watching the first season when it came out. I thought it could have had a good potential to be a romance anime, but the MC was a huge turn off and so were the other random girls that showed up. No real point to them, they mostly distract the story from the progression of the main romance.\n\nOverall, pretty bad anime. I don't have any real expectations for the story ever being good. I just watch it 1.5x because I think the girl's story and drive for her passion to be interesting. I'd rather see her journey into becoming an actress rather than this romance and the 3 other side romances. If that tells you anything about how poorly the story is written. May drop this one if it just gets too unbearable or cringy.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIf I were to assign a purpose to this show, it would be a grim reminder of how far gone some of mankind can be. Why do people seek romantic relationships so much, and get so discouraged when they can’t find someone? It’s simple. Each person has their inner narcissist boiling inside them. Everyone wants to be loved, for people to look at them positively, to be noticed. How do people try to solve this problem? They seek “cheap thrills”, instead of improving themselves. One’s youth has many paths, but some just search endlessly for relationships, instead of doing much more healthy things. Kazuya is ... a great example of this type of person, someone that no one should aspire to be. Alright, enough life talk, let’s get to this anime!\n\nWelcome back you degenerates! I can’t believe so many of you are back to enjoy the trashiness that is Rent-a-Girlfriend! The worst thing is, we know it’s trash, and still we come back for more. Are we starting to become as degenerate as Kazuya? Oh no…\n\nI can’t believe I have to say this, but I wish Mami showed up more this season. The reason that Season 1 was mildly enjoyable was because of all the drama, and the hate that the fandom had towards her. Her character felt quite watered down this season, and “mild”, which was unfortunate. Without all that drama, this season just felt like a generic romcom built on misunderstandings, and was kind of boring, to be honest. Well, there are some good points as well, (cough cough, Sumi), and it oddly feels like the inevitable next season might inspire just a teensy bit of hope.\n\nMy grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20\n\nSTORY: 3.2/25\n\nThe story is a mess, and we expected this. Misunderstandings just aren’t a good formula to tell a story, and watching Kazuya trying to diffuse them was just cringey. It’s hard to understand why the girls even put up with him, but that’s just how it is. Kazuya, you really don’t need to explain everything you do to everyone, unless it’s Ruka, I don’t think any of them care that much about your activities.\n\nIt really could have been much better, if more of Chizuru’s ambitions towards her acting career were shown more, and if the emotional moments with her grandma were handled with more care.\n\nART: 7.5/10\n\nIt’s not fantastic, but vibrant enough to look good. No complaints about the animation overall.\n\nMUSIC: 7.6/10\n\nIt’s hard to the top The Peggies, but the OP this season did somewhat grow on me as the season went along. The ED was rather tame compared to the hilarious one in Season 1.\n\nCHARACTERS: 3.7/20\n\nThe terrible character writing basically makes me want every character to lose in their lives, except for Sumi. I’ll talk about my thoughts about each character briefly.\n\nChizuru was rather boring to watch this season, to be honest. We knew from Season 1 that she wanted to pursue a career in acting, and we didn’t see a whole lot of that this season. She has her moments as well, since her grandma was in the hospital, which showed her vulnerability.\n\nWhy does Ruka even want to be with Kazuya? She was literally thrown to the wayside, but she still clings, and made bold moves this season. I’d feel bad for her, but apart from her love for Kazuya, there’s not much that makes her character stand out.\n\nThere wasn’t enough drama this season, because Mami wasn’t prevalent. I know most hate her, but she was the source of entertainment, creating division and discussion. Hope she shows up more.\n\nSumi’s my favourite character in this show, because she’s what makes the plot advance. She’s a genuinely good companion, and when Kazuya’s around her, Kazuya has to be more responsible, and I believe that Sumi brings out the best qualities of Kazuya. It’s a shame she’s not the main character though.\n\nKazuya? He’s still trash, most of the time. Sumi, save him please.\n\nENJOYMENT: 2.2/15\n\nIt’s not funny, it’s not trashy enough, and it’s cringe. When Sumi’s on the screen though, it’s awesome.\n\nTHEMATIC EXECUTION: 2.8/20\n\nI firmly believe that this show could have been so much better if the themes were executed better. If you want to be trashy, do it to the max. If you want to be emotional, do it to the max. Instead, they throw in jokes when Chizuru’s grandma was ill, and whenever there could be a sign of plot progression, it just never happens.\n\nOVERALL: 27/100\n\nI didn’t expect this to be good, but I expected more from this season. It had the potential to be decent, if Chizuru’s acting career took centre stage, and if Kazuya cleared some misunderstandings. Instead, we just got a generic, trashy romcom that was hard to sit through. I do think though, to be a bit more optimistic, that next season (which has been announced), might be better, because believe it or not, Kazuya does sometimes reflect upon his actions, and that could be interesting.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIn order to watch and enjoy this show, you first need to understand why it's getting review bombed. Hating on this show has become a rallying point for every single awkward and cringe male who watches anime romance shows.\n\nThis show is super contemporary, with the story about a very cringe protagonist who is supposed to be modeled on the average adult male watching these rom coms. Needless to say the blatant portrayal of them in the form of a main character has pissed them off, for taking off the so called veil. I think they are used to the illusion of some ... kind of moral and virtuous MC finding and experiencing love and want to compare themselves to that, however, this show has the AUDACITY to deny them of that right and show them the reality that they fear most; that they are the cringe awkward males just like Kazuya is, except unlike him, they don't have four ditsy girls doting on them.\n\nWith that being said, once you get past the negative undeserved reputation this show gets, it's easier to see it for what it actually is, a ground breaking series which dares push the boundaries of typical mc's and the dynamic between him and the harem. In that sense, it's a unique anime with the expected highs and lows of a romance plot. The art is also stellar.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n“Why am I here? Why are you here? Why are we still here? Just to suffer?” Well Miller, I’ll tell you. It’s been a while that I did a full review of an anime that I knew was going to be s**t. Listen, season one had an interesting start but as the season went on and we got exposed to Kazuya more and more with even more waifu bait, combining with an ending that was so on brand with the series, it wasn’t really shocking. It played a lot of rom-com tropes and clichés that it really had little originality besides its premise. Which never ... really got expanded on that much. Season two looked to continue where season one left off (in the wrong direction) and I didn’t really care to begin with since I knew it was going down hill before it even aired. But I watched it anyway and the best way to some up why I decided to watch season two was, “F**k it, why not?” Now after watching it, I find myself asking the question I had earlier, why am I here? I originally planned to do a review on Summertime Render instead of this, but the calls of roasting this show were strong and well, here we are.\n\nThe show takes place right after season one, where it ended in a way that helped returned to the status quo. After that, Kazuya goes back to his usual routine of thinking how to get with Chizuru, overthinking everything and wa**ing to kingdom come (no pun intended). That’s it really. There is no major plot development happening as it pretty much follows what it did in season one. For better and for worse. Season two makes me question what exactly is the plan here? It very much feels like we are going in circles here with Kazuya and Chizuru’s relationship and pretty much goes for a, “will they or won’t they?” approach when we pretty much know they will, they are just dragging this obnoxiously long because it’s so obvious; also taking in the fact as to how tropey this show is as well. This all leads to a lot of boredom and frustration because despite we already know the obvious, it doesn’t go anywhere. It tries to lead these little threads dangling like something will change or surprise you but it just fails to fool you. It fails to subvert your expectations because trying to go against the tried but true formula will hurt its marketability. This was becoming a problem by the end of season one and it’s only been exasperated here.\n\nThe main reason though I and I’m sure many other people, hate this series is our main protagonist, Kazuya. Kazuya was already feeling like one of the worst protagonists in rom-com anime but this season all but confirmed that not only the worst rom-com protagonist in anime, but one of the worst protagonists in anime period. Almost everything he does is infuriating as he continuously digs the hole he dug himself into and continues to dig. His constant doubts, constantly overthinking the situation, his complete obliviousness, constantly trying to lead Chizuru on, even though she ain’t biting, constantly leaving Ruka hanging that she may have a shot. Think every harem protagonist cliché and Kazuya is bound to have it. He does things that continuously infuriate me and the way treats other girls makes me question what they see in him. He’s also hardly straight with them and refuses to try and set those things straight as doubt constantly creeps in and before you know it, the hole is getting deeper. Mate, look, I know rejection is hard and you have already been through it, but you not just coming out and saying it is only making it worse for not only yourself, but the people around you. He’s just keeps digging and digging until he has become ingrained. He has become ingrained into the hole and cannot escape. He does try at one point to change things but plot convenience means he’s still stuck in that hole.\n\nBut it’s not like the girls are innocent in this too. Chizuru was a hardcore tsundere in season one and her tsundere tendencies have died down in season two but they have left a void in her personality to a point where she shows little personality for the majority of this season. She normally reacts to things with a shrug expression, acting like even she doesn’t want to be here as well. Yeah sure, she reacts in the obligatory, emotional scenes to get a tear jerk reaction but for most of this season, she is devoid of emotion. Ruka seems to be more clingy this season as she forces herself onto Kazuya even though she knows damn well he likes Chizuru more. Granted, it doesn’t help that Kazuya is leading her on to think she has a shot. Now if you were to ask me what camp I would stand for this show, it would be camp Ruka. After this season, not so much. She has become more irritating and should really look for someone else because her constant obsession to get Kazuya to love him back is not going to work and we, the viewer, know that. But she goes so far as to blackmail Kazuya to get what she wants, fully aware that it hurts the people affected, INCLUDING THE PERSON SHE IS TRYING TO DATE. So it just comes across as annoying and act as the other option. Again this isn’t strictly her fault, but to say she’s not innocent is wrong as she tries to sabotage things so she can have Kazuya all to herself.\n\nSumi is just there, again. She arrived late into season one so we didn’t really know much about her except that she is really shy. In season two, it’s pretty much the same, she’s just there to be a cute face. I’m also joining her camp now because she hasn’t done anything wrong, YET. But to be honest, I believe she will continue just there to be cute so I have more confidence in my choice. Mami’s screentime is reduced from season one as she makes infrequent appearances and it’s usually only to stir trouble by checking on Kazuya and see if she can try to belittle him for what he is doing, even though SHE’S TOTALLY RIGHT. The problem is that she comes across like a complete b**ch while doing it, so she becomes just as hateful as the people she is belittling. Another problem is she has nothing to do with Kazuya any more since breaking up with him so why she going out of her way to do it? Is she merely a plot device to see what Kazuya is doing is wrong? Or is it to take out her problems on someone else? If either both are so, it doesn’t feel like the message is coming across well. She played the, “character you love to hate,” mould well but then you see Kazuya on screen doing more and more bad s**t, her main defining trait doesn’t lead much of an impact so she still acts as a b**ch but not in a meaningful way.\n\nAll these girls besides Sumi have had their problems as characters grow and they seem to be developing new ones as well. It continues to get more and more degrading as time goes on. Not helped by the fact that Kazuya continues to be a piece of s**t and doesn’t fix the problems that he, himself, has created. It goes on and on to the point where the narrative basically boils down to how far does the hole need to go? Who in their right mind thinks that characters performing actions that only make you dislike them (and not in a good way) and not sensible humans would make for an interesting narrative? Can someone please get Sumi out of this s**tstain of a show before she might become a disliked character as well.\n\nIn the animation and sound department, nothing really has changed from season one. The animation is still mediocre at best but the character designs for our female leads are still very pretty. Say what you want about their personalities, at least they are designed to be drop dead gorgeous, with good fashion sense as well. Soundtrack still remains good in my opinion (one of the very few high points) with it trying to capture these emotional scenes better than the characters, but feels wasted in a show that fails to invoke any emotion other than hatred and apathy.\n\nWhich leaves the opening and the ending. The opening from season one was actually a really good opening with it being visually solid and gave you the impression that this would be a fun show full of lively characters. While only half of that was sort of true, the OP was still a fun one. Season two’s OP however feels like a poor imitation of season one’s OP. Titled, \"Himitsu Koi Gokoro\" by CHiCO with HoneyWorks, it pretty much follows the same beats as season one’s OP, except it’s not done as well. It’s not as lively or catchy, nor is there much energy into it. It reuses the same scene when the chorus kicks in and uses a scene from season one to, I guess, match up the lyrics for the song but fails doing so. This feels so inferior that it actually matches the quality of the show.\n\nThe ED is just a collection of still images having the four main girls be centre stage. Titled, \"Ienai feat. asmi\" by MIMiNARI, it feels like a wasted vocal performance of an ED that just looks quite bland in what I can only describe as an alternate universe where Kazuya doesn’t exist and the four girls get along because of it. Granted, it does bring out the girl’s cuteness so I’ll give them that. It is better than season one’s ED where Kazuya was figuratively jacking it (unfortunately not in San Diego) because the only thing good about that ED was its symbolism.\n\nThis review was honestly a review of not just season two but also the building gripes that I had of season one and it honestly felt like a review of both season one and two. Season two seems to take season one’s problems but only increases the intensity of them while also creating new problems that this season created. It slowly becomes a rabbit hole of aimless story direction and unlikeable characters that only gets worse the more you think about it. With that in mind, I just want to say this:\n\nI’m done.\n\nI’m done with this s**tstain of a protagonist that treats the people around him poorly and makes decisions that only get worse.\n\nI’m done with a plot that contrives its way to keep the girls around this pathetic protagonist while having no idea what it wants to do next despite knowing where it wants to end.\n\nI’m done with these girls that do things that only make you want to hate them and are simply pretty faces used to sell waifu figures.\n\nI’m done with a series that treats its audience like f**king simpletons by appealing to the lowest, degenerate graphic through clichés and tropes that they know work but don’t do anything to subvert or change to make it feel more unique.\n\nListen, I’m not saying that I’m above it and I’m not a degenerate. Far from it, I have recently watched Monster Musume. I’ve sat down and watched episodes of Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World and Vermeil in Gold this season. What I’m saying is that it doesn’t try to be anything but appealing to the lowest common denominator that it knows we can be suckers for. Hell, it got me to watch this s**tshow again, but that was because I wanted to see if it would get worse and it did. From what I can gather as well, it would seem that it is going to get worse from here. We’ve still yet to reach THAT CHAPTER yet. You know the one, the one that exploded on Twitter and it ending with Kazuya posing for the cover of the next Nirvana album. That will probably bring me back out of sheer curiosity to see how it gets animated. But for now, I’m done. If you are still able to sit through and watch this series beyond this season, well more power to you mate, you clearly have a higher tolerance to this than I do. But I will be one of those people who will wash their hands and say, “I’ve had enough.”\n\nStory: 1/10 (A story that feels aimless and is trudging through mud at a ridiculously slow pace with what feels like little progress.)\n\nCharacters: 2/10 (Sumi is the only you can like because she hasn’t done anything that would make you want to punch her in the face for being a bad person.)\n\nAnimation: 5/10 (Animation is still painfully mediocre but the character designs are still on point.)\n\nSound: 6/10 (Soundtrack is still good but hampered by a slightly worse OP but a slightly better ED.)\n\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 1/10 (I’m done)\n\nOverall score: 3.0/10 Recommendation: Don’t F**king Bother\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI'm amazed at the current average score as well as the reviews posted to date. Granted, I'm a sucker for romcoms, but the amount of 2's is staggering to me.\n\nPerhaps that is due to Kazuya being that weirdo that he is. I can see how so many can find him detestable, he's totally not the kind of strong, masculine heart reaper, annoyed at the harem his very presence gathers like in other series. I can see how men can find him cringeworthy, while women may even feel offended that someone even thought a girl would fall for such a loser. I dig that.\n\nHowever, believe it ... or not, guys like him exist. Pathetic and hopeless, but kind-hearted and ready to jump into a firestorm for a girl they're fond of, who never seems to notice them. Worst of all, guys that really don't have any passions of their own, thinking that just giving yourself away and hoping to get something back is the way to go about love. I've been that guy. Maybe not as cringey as he is (I hope lol), but there's so much I can relate to.\n\nMami-chan... a toxic, one-sided relationship that left the guy hooked and discarded. Yeah, I've been there, sort of. Feeling like there might be something in it, trying as hard as I can, but ended up used and refused. The conflict Kazuya feels for Mami-chan, feeling deep inside that she doesn't care and yet unable to let go of his feelings. Painfully real.\n\nChizuru... holy crap, where do I begin. Chizuru is an interesting, talented girl, with her own dreams. I can see how Kazuya fell for her, and her (seemingly) not giving a damn is also relatable. So what does he do? He wants to support her in her dreams, with the painful understanding that he's in it just to give and not receive. Cause that's what love is about, isn't it? If you want someone to be with you, it's just jealousy. If you want to screw someone, that's just lust. But doing your best to see the other person happy, that's love. If you sat down and wondered what kind of love you would really like to receive, it would be that - someone to be there for you, to help when you need it and to smile with you when you're happy, with no strings attached.\n\nIt's nice if it's reciprocated, though, which brings us to...\n\nRuka-chan... a silly, puppy love for all the bad reasons. Back then I had hoped something like this would happen to me. I had hoped for a girl to notice my worth, to fall for the little hero I had in me, ready to put my life on the line for her just because I'm just man enough. In restrospect though, this is the worst kind of love you could receive; blind fascination and possessive lust with nothing to stand on. Someone who just wants to have you for themself for no other reason than a hormonal haywire in their brain. And yet, had I been in Kazuya's situation, I would've been devastated, torn between projecting the love I have in the torment of no fucks given back and selfishly accepting unwarranted affection to finally feel loved.\n\nKazuya's situation was truly my nightmare fuel. Sure, the series becomes so cringey at times that I literally have to pause it and do something else before watching more, but that's nothing unusual to me in those romcoms. But the feeling of being worthless, the impostor syndrome telling you that you don't deserve anything back, and yet giving the best of yourself to a person who doesn't care, knowing it's just going to be pain and no gain... so real.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nReading several reviews I couldn't help but think how unfair they are, they criticize Kazuya to death, although some of the situations are cringe and unreal, his character is one of the most real you can find, if you are a person who has lived long enough you will understand.\n\nDespite being loaded with ridiculous situations, at the end of the season with the plot of grandmother Sayuri and Chizuru's dream, you can appreciate Kazuya wanting to change and leave behind his own weakness, be honest with what happens and stop hurting and lying to his grandmother and Ruka, that was a very difficult decision to ... make and that requires some courage.\n\nFrom what we saw in the first season to this one, the evolution of the characters is remarkable and we learn more about them, if the first part was a cringe fest, this one leaves a good taste and an honest desire to know what happens next.\n\nWanting to help someone you love makes you get a strength that you yourself did not know, although many times you are powerless against what happens.\n\nIt may be that no matter how many sacrifices you make and no matter how hard you try, you will not get what you want, but as Chizuru herself says, the important thing is not to regret anything.\n\nMore a general opinion about the season than a review as such, but I wanted to comment even if it was not easy to express myself in English...\n\nThe story is not worthy of such negative reviews that seem to only see the personality of our protagonist and ignore everything else that presents and at least in this season, gave us much to think about, with the loss, the weakness of oneself and how important it is to have someone to lean on because it is never easy to carry everything alone.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nholy fck, I want to puke because of the mc,\n\nHow is this 6.5+* on mal is a mystery to me.\n\n...\n\nstory is bruh 1.0, mc is bruh 3.0.

The only ... thing that i consider that could make people dislike this show is that it's very deep and complex, and everyone who throws hate to it are people who didn't get the real point of the story.

You know it is bad for your health, but you can't stop wanting more and becoming addicted once you're hooked. If you thought S1 Kazuya was cringe-worthy, wait until you see S2 Kazuya which is 100 times worse (Of course, this is an exaggeration, but you get my point.).\n\nIn all honesty, who watches this show for Kazuya? Nobody, right? Kazuya literally manages to turn a heartwarming and sad scene into something absurd, from his annoying voice to his horni thoughts to his obsession with Chizuru, in the sense that no matter how good a situation may ... be for him, he manages to fuck it up with something stupid.\n\nChizuru, on the other hand, is constantly leading Kazuya on. Then, when the occasion arises, she fails to express her true feelings, a trait of her that I dislike and which is prevalent in S2. It is as if she keeps him as a backup/assurance in case something goes wrong.\n\nI don't have much good to say about Kazuya other than that he's there to be cringe and annoying, but you can see him trying to change for the better, like actually wanting to correct his pathetic display and genuinely express his love for Chizuru. Ruka is a depiction of someone who is obsessively possessive of his boyfriend / husband and would go to any length and by any means necessary to subdue his lover, even if it meant destroying her own image. Sumi is a depiction of someone who is shy but wants to conquer her shyness problem and finally proclaim her love to the MC; she never fails to steal people's hearts with how cute and sincere she is. Despite how unlikeable and spiteful her persona is portrayed, Mami actually aids in the progression of the plot. You can see by the way she acts that she's the obsessive sort like Ruka, and despite the fact that they've broken up, she's still obsessed with Kazuya and is using all means possible to do research on him and make him hers.\n\nAfter all is said and done, KanoKari is a good show with realistic romance, good art and sound, a story that's fairly unique and not generic in other romcoms, and despite being very cringeworthy, actually has its selling point of waifus and storyline that constantly hook the viewers into wanting more. We can shittalk and mock the show all we want, but we can't deny its impact on mainstream media and how it continues to attract new fans and haters alike, such as Demon Slayer. Despite constantly complaining about it, I would recommend it, and I enjoyed it more than I expected.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n4/10\n\nFull disclosure I have only read the infamous chapter “218” but otherwise am an anime-only, I did my best to remain bias free. But still due to the knowledge of this “chapter” and having watched this shitshow of a season 2 I can for sure say that this is now a harem, between,\n\nrental Kanojo Mizuhara.\n\nthe used-only-for-Cuck-ing Kanojo Ruka.\n\nex kanojo Mami who is being saved for another dragged-out plot point perhaps.\n\nor maybe even the….. I-will-like-him-because-the-internet-thinks-I'm-best-girl-hence-my-ship-boosts-sales kanojo SUMI.\n\nthe anime-only watchers deserve to know this much\n\nIf one is still watching this, hoping it'll get better?\n\nIt won't.\n\n...\n\nThere was massive praise for the second arc of kanokari before the “218” days, But it turns out, that the series is just taking the predictable harem-teaser yet fateful encounter-driven ecchi show that drags on and on while keeping the slim chances of each girl always alive with some bogus last-minute bullshit that only the word ANIME LOGIC can explain.\n\nI'll be straight, flawed protagonists are actually pretty good, If one is able to develop and make their growth seem worthwhile it makes for a really satisfactory ARC, I witnessed Kazutrash in s1, and won't say I liked him, but still gave this show another shot hoping for his development, hoping to see him change due to his, uh…… girls?\n\nPlot (4/10)\n\nThe whole plot is basically rinsing and repeating, the misunderstanding almost gets resolved and boom new problem has appeared! The entire show is mostly always just filled with kazutrash monologue and it doesn't mean its bad, Death note was pretty much all monologuing too , but in the case of kanokari the whole point of monologues is KAZUTRASH BEING A DIRTY Piece of crap that LEWDS every action of any girl, even the girls he is SUPPOSEDLY not interested in.\n\nCharacters (3/10)\n\nThe crap about Mizuhara being actually good is completely BS, she is kind of half the trouble, she keeps meddling with Kazuya's life even tho she should not as a professional, she forces it upon him to accept Ruka but then keeps giving false signs that she is jealous of Ruka making kazutrash really believe that he has a chance with her, kazutrash and Mami need no explanation, Ruka is a spoilt little kid who is an attention ho. Sumi who was the only decent character was so since she mostly was silent and actually cute, and suddenly she wants him too, and kazutrash starts to show mild interest. What the actual fuck? Has the author seriously decided to go the harem route? Or just wants us to feel bad for Sumi wtf is even happening?\n\nVA and sound (8/10)\n\nThe OST is actually not too bad, the VA of kazutrash regrettably so is actually top-notch (what a waste of talent). The OP is also quite good. ED is acceptable but tropey.\n\nArt and animation (6/10)\n\nArt is good but only during important scenes and hence not very consistent, animation when required is given a huge boost too, but is also never consistent, the above-average art in the OP and ED actually warrants some praise.\n\nIf you hated S1 or were sadly a victim of the manga please don't bother, but if you are a harem fan, you may actually find it enjoyable since each girl gets their moment and there is no clear winner even to this date XD.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n\"Hey, that was so entertaining!\"\n\n*gives it a low rating*\n\nSometimes, I feel like I’d rate the Rent-A-Girlfriend hentai doujins higher than their anime. I get to see the same borderline pornographic shit (well, not borderline), but I also get to see Kazuya not be a little bitch. Watching Rent-A-Girlfriend’s second season, I did not feel liberated. I felt hopelessly shackled to the “flee all” mentality of one of the worst protagonists in modern harem history. Let me explain.\n\nI think that Kazuya’s grandmother has actually traumatized him into being the wimpy, pathological liar that he is now. Ironically, she’s now on the receiving end of his dumbass ... lies, so whatever goes around comes around. The only plot-productive thing that Kazuya has ever done in his whole life is help Chizuru out with her acting confidence once. Literally everything else that comes out of his mouth is a lie, an insensitive slip up, a self-deprecating statement, or some horny ass monologue about how \"Mizuhara‘s thighs look like they could be used as a bouncy house for little children\" or something.\n\nThere is literally nothing redeeming about the way he acts around his friends and family. Yet somehow, our lovely heroine is hinted to be somewhat conscious of him. I think there have been more than 3 instances just this season of Chizuru sitting right behind her front door, blushing because of something Kazuya said or did. Why? Because he’s the main character, of course! This logic is probably the part of the show that pisses me off the most. There’s absolutely no reason for Chizuru to put up with or like Kazuya, but the narrative portrays their shitty relationship as some kind of necessity to both of them and their families.\n\nThe visuals are as clean and poppy as the last season (though the chibi shots are a bit annoying), so overall, the quality is high. There’s nothing to note about the soundtrack in particular, apart from it adequately fitting scenes when it’s important (like the Ruka scene lmao).\n\nAll complaints aside though, I won’t pretend that it wasn’t entertaining as hell to watch a new episode every week, anticipating every misunderstanding, slip-up, and down bad scene with the joy of knowing that “at least it’s not as bad as the latest arc of the manga”. In terms of enjoyment, this season of Rent-A-Girlfriend is just as strong as the last, though it’s definitely beginning to feel a little bit old at this point. Knowing that the next season will be better, I advise anime onlys to keep your heads up and buckle in for the long run because we all know that this romantic train wreck is going absolutely nowhere!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nPeople are being too harsh on the anime and love to bandwagon the hate train, its only been 4 episodes.\n\nKazuya is down bad and cringe many times but that makes him hilarious. You shouldn't be relating to him as a character but his antics are goofy and hilarious. Design of the characters are all great as well and keep the atmosphere lively.\n\nIf you can enjoy a summer show for what it is and come in with low expectations, you will have a good time. I can guarantee all the people who wrote essays on how bad the show is sits down and watches the ... latest episode every week.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI will proudly admit that I really enjoyed the first season of KanoKari. I understand why most of the anime community dunked on it with memes and harsh reviews, however, I thought there was a lot of potential for a well-executed, character-driven story. So going into season 2, my expectations were set high and I was hoping for a RomCom that would blow critics away. Instead, what I got was a story that began tearing itself apart from the inside. So this review will dive into how KanoKari threw away all the potential it had in exchange for milking a money-making concept to near death.\n\nSTAKES ... - Set them high, then make them disappear.\n\nThe main conflict at KanoKari’s heart is having Kazuya overcome his low self-esteem and maidenless behavior in order to confess to a girl out of his league. What I really enjoyed about the finale of season 1 and the first half of season 2 is how they set a ticking time bomb for Kazuya to make this confession. We saw in season 1 that Chizuru is an actor hoping to make it big within the next year or so, which would mean Kazuya won’t be able to “date her” anymore. In season 2, we also turn up the heat with Ruka and Mami where both girls add far more tension to a fake relationship than any grandma or childhood friend could do. In a nutshell, all this pressure is screaming at Kazuya to wake the fuck up and make some actual progression.\n\nThe problem is, when Kazuya does finally come to his senses, the show suddenly removes all this pressure and even forces him to maintain this facade. In fact, the author uses the same excuse from season 1 to justify this odd development… keeping the grandmas happy. It’s such a huge step backward in character development when the character finally comes to the right conclusion, but suddenly the whole world is telling him to keep doing the dumb shit he is doing, so he now plays along and starts the whole cycle over again.\n\nCOMEDY - Down Bad + Maidenless + No Bitches + Seek Help\n\nThe comedy for season 2 was definitely a downgrade from season 1. In season 1, the audience is laughing with or at Kazuya when he acts like your average horny teenage boy or a cringy loser, but that’s because the punchlines are diverse and well-timed. This changes for the worse in season 2 when dirty jokes seem to be the only thing the show can make. Kazuya must have been more bricked up than a chimney because at one point he couldn’t stop seeing these girls as sex dolls wanting to do the hot, sexy SEX with him. Every 30 seconds was “look at her thighs/tits/ass/face/clothes, it’s like a walking fuck toy.” Do you get it, dear reader? Kazuya is REALLY horny, and the show makes it REALLY clear to you. On top of this, it was extraordinarily painful how bad Kazuya was at hiding this fact, even in public or during interpersonal sharing time, which gave me huge second-hand embarrassment.\n\nGIRLS - Started okay, got worse with time.\n\nOne of the biggest questions and criticism this show got was “Why do any of these girls like Kazuya?” Just like a clickbait YouTube video, I watched to get my answer and ended up getting absolutely nothing. While you can make the argument that Chizuru likes Kazuya because he’s kind-hearted to her, a lot more would argue he is just a simp with no redeeming qualities. Kazuya also treats Ruka like garbage and yet she is still obsessed with him, even more so than she was in season 1. Even Mami is trying to wrap Kazuya around her finger again. But for the love of god, can this show explain why they all care about him??? What do 10/10 lookers find so attractive in an average or less-than-average guy who does nothing particularly significant? Fuck, I wish my dating life was that easy.\n\nOverall, I felt like this season falls into the “what could have been” category of anime. While I will check out the third season, if it ever comes, I’m not looking forward to it based on what I hear about the manga. Unless you have a special attachment to one of these characters, I would think carefully about whether or not you want to continue watching KanoKari.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI don't know why but you all guys are rating this anime so low.....\n\nin the epispde 4......\n\nwhat to say it was one of the best episode of romance anime i have ever watched and\n\n!!Ruka that girl probably is one of the best waifus i have ever seen....\n\nand the animation how beautiful can it be.....sometimes i really feel like the girls should come alive and then you know stuff......\n\ni did'nt like the ending theme but the opening was one of the best!!....\n\nthe way it starts uhhhh...\n\nso guys i really prefer you all to give this anime a little bit more credit........\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nKanokari is like cocaine. You know it’s awful for you, but damn does it feel good to consume. At this point, we all know it’s an unequivocal train wreck with arguably the worst mc in the history of the medium. Yet, we keep coming back to it.\n\nWhy? That’s a subjective answer that will vary from person to person. For me it’s down to the waifus, particularly Mami and Ruka. At times it almost feels like the girls are the main character(s) and with Reiji literally coming out and saying he’s in love with Chizuru, his own creation, that probably is the case. Kazuya is only ... there as a tool for us to see our waifus do cute things and to self insert, imagining scenarios where we would react like a normal human instead of a loser. There are also some among us who just want to watch the world burn and see how bad the show can get.\n\nMami and Ruka are the literal only reason I continue to watch this show. Say what you will about Ruka. Many people will call her annoying, but her personality is perfect for me. Mami, one of the most hated waifus in recent memory, but she gets so much hate because she is the only normal person in this series. My love of these two characters is enough to keep me invested in the series.\n\nFrom a technical aspect, the production continues to be mediocre with the only substantial quality animation coming from THAT Ruka and Kazuya moment, The OST seems like it alternates between at max 3 songs and has become so incredibly repetitive at this point that I damn near want to mute the show when watching it. On a positive note, I do legitimately love the character designs in this series. I love the colour palate as well.\n\nKanokari season 2 is more of the same old garbage from season 1, but arguably even worse because of less Mami this season. If you liked season 1, you'll continue to enjoy it and if you didn't like season 1, well you'll probably hate this even more. The show has done absolutely nothing to attract new viewers or change existing impressions, instead devolving further and further into a cesspool with no purpose or ambition and with a 3rd season announced, I see absolutely no reason why this will change.\n\nKanokari s2 gets 3 out of 10.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nRemember two years ago when we witnessed the fall and rise of a 20-year old guy named Kazuya Kinoshita? Time flies fast and 2 years later, we meet him again in this sequel. There's no way to spin around it but this anime seemed to be destined for a sequel. Watching this continuation felt like the same sour experience as I had remember. But what the heck, this is only a 1-cour show and life isn't always money and honey.\n\nTaking place directly after the first season, it's actually quite important to watch it if you want to get the full juicy scoop. Like many ... sequels, this season attempts to build off of established characters such as Kazuya and Mizuhara. Out of curiousity and somewhat commitment, I took the gamble and decided to give the sequel a chance. I mean, what do I have to really lose besides some hours of my time? Nonetheless, this series takes off showcasing how wonderful Chizuru Mizuhara is as a character on the surface. Like a graceful flower, she takes on the role of a kunoichi in the first episode and awes the audience with her spectacular performance. This anime is not shy of giving every chance to showcase Mizuhara' talent and beauty so the first episode had to make that impression. Meanwhile, Kazuya is still the same dull doorknob protagonist as we remember. Nothing remotely has changed about him mentally or physically.\n\nOne of the main problems I had with the first season is the lack of an interesting character cast. Kazuya stands guilty as the worst character in the show, with all his character flaws. Sadly, his character doesn't improve as he struggles to be himself. Watching his interactions with Mizuhara, Ruka, Mami, and Sumi almost felt like psychological torture. It speaks for itself when every episode puts into him into the position of a wish fufilling male. Kazuya's chemistry with the female cast often ends up being extremely awkward. The main reason is how the cast is way out of his league. The only person who seems to acknowledge him more than just a dull guy is Ruka. Surprisingly, she takes aggressive action this season by forcefully kissing him and even offering sex. Why Ruka wants to lower herself to that is anyone's guess but of course, Kazuya rejects her offer. And trust me, it's not because he isn't tempted.\n\nWe also can't forget our two remaining female members Mami and Sumi. Comparing the two is like apple to oranges. While this season focuses mostly on Kazuya and Mizuhara's relationship, it still manages to find time to bring out those two's personalities. Mami in particular retains her replusive and manipulative personality. This season doesn't full explore their relationship but you can see where it's coming from. She hasn't changed since day one when she appeared in this show. On the other hand, there's the sweet Sumi Sakurasawa who manages to secure dates with Kazuya this season. Does she truly have feelings for Kazuya? That's up to anyone's guess but by the looks of it, she seems to appreciate his presence. The anime loves to throw the two together in embarassing moments while exploring the innocence of their relationship.\n\nUltimately, it feels like this season suffered a major flaw that couldn't redeem itself. It really had no direction for a plot. Every episode feels like a loop where characters lack development. The main story appeals to its genres and premise but can't find its true purpose. Why does the show continously pair up Kazuya with these gorgeous ladies? Why do they want us to watch him suffer? Bear in mind that with about 24 episodes across two seasons, there shouldn't be much excuse for even a little bit of character development. But no, Kazuya is still an idiot goofball that no guy should be like.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n--- ENG ---\n\nFrom the first season I was bothered by the behavior of the protagonist \"Kazuya\". The series begins with the end of the relationship between him and Mami-chan, who is fed up with his attitude but who wouldn't be? Kazuya is shown from the beginning as someone needy and desperate, who couldn't stand being single for more than 5 minutes from the first episode, renting a rental girlfriend. But, that's just the beginning of the anime and you can't judge the protagonist for it, for this reason I continued to watch it. My hope was that there would be personal growth regarding Kazuya's character, ... but after the first and second seasons, it's disappointing and boring to see that he does NOT change... having fantasies with all the girls in the series and changing by not rejecting any and looking good with everyone, trying not to bump into each other or even feeling sad when Ruka trains Mami, since she would lose the opportunity with her ex-girlfriend. It's a pathetic harem anime... where all the girls revolve around the main character, who has nothing to rescue.\n\n--- ESP ---\n\nDesde la primera temporada me molestó el comportamiento del protagonista \"Kazuya\". La serie comienza con el término de la relación entre él y Mami-chan, quien está harta de su actitud pero ¿quién no lo estaría? Kazuya se muestra desde un principio como alguien necesitado y desesperado, que no aguantó estar soltero más de 5 minutos desde el primer episodio, rentando una novia de alquiler. Pero, eso es solo el principio del animé y no se puede juzgar al protagonista por ello, por esta razón lo continué viendo. Mi esperanza era que existiera un crecimiento personal respecto al personaje de Kazuya, pero transcurridas la primera y segunda temporada, es decepcionante y aburrido ver que NO cambia... teniendo fantasías con todas las chicas de la serie y cambiando por no rechazar a ninguna y quedar bien con todas, intentando que estas no se topen entre sí o sintiéndose incluso triste cuando Ruka entrenta a Mami, ya que perdería la oportunidad con su exnovia. Es un animé harem patético... donde todas las chicas giran en torno al protagonista, quien no tiene nada que rescatar.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe second season is better than the first. Kazuya's character growth in the second season was remarkable. He becomes a more likable romantic comedy lead. Kazuya starts to support Chizuru in meaningful ways, acknowledging her talent and hard work towards her dreams. He honors her as a person and wants to assist her in achieving her objectives without any hidden agendas. Seeing a person like him in their relationship was heartwarming.\n\nI understand why Chizuru was distant towards Kazuya in the first season. Still, her behavior towards him changed in the second season. Their feelings for each other and their relationship transform and progress. However, overcoming ... their first impressions and how they treated each other in the past is still a slow process. Initially, Chizuru saw Kazuya as spineless, crybaby, selfish, and creepy, but he has made significant progress in overcoming these flaws. I enjoyed watching the two main characters and the direction of their relationship in the second season.\n\nThe supporting characters are a mixed bag. Mami is a good antagonist, but I'm not sure what motivates her. Ruka is a bit irritating and doesn't fit the show's narrative well. I don't understand why she loves Kazuya, apart from the fact that he makes her heart race. She doesn't play a significant role in the story, and I think her character could be removed from the show without affecting it. Sumi is a nice addition, but she hasn't played a significant role in the story yet.\n\nOverall, the second season was great. However, I'm concerned that the story will drag on for too long and not make any progress. It's difficult to imagine them dragging out that storyline for another three or four seasons. This worries me a bit, but hopefully, the story will take a different direction, and everything will work fine.\n\nThe show pleasantly surprised me; I initially thought it would be terrible.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all"
