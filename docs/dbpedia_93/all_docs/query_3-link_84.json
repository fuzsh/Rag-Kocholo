To be precise, I am addressing IMOGEN BINNIE, who doesn’t seem to know how to properly spell my punk name. Nor does she know who she is messing with— namely, me, Colin Atrophy! Listen little lady, while you were off driving around in your mom’s station wagon doing “book readings” (WHO EVEN READS BOOKS ANYMORE?!) I was home in New York Fuckin’ City putting in the hard work of Making Punk A Threat Again. Ever heard of Vomit Enemas? That’s not just my awesome crust band, it’s what I do every morning. Did you read about how someone had written U R A DICKHEAD NO WAR 4 OIL in a mixture of human/animal feces/blood on the windshield of every single SUV in Queens? Well I’m not saying I did that because I don’t want to IMPUGN MYSELF, but I’m also not saying I didn’t do it, because I DID because I’m punk. Let’s see Johnny Law even try and come after me. The point of all this is that my dad is a very powerful lawyer so I will be suing all of you for like 80 million bucks in emotional damage so say goodbye to your dumb magazine and say hello to a future of penury and regret. LOVE ALWAYS, —Colin Atrophy, Slice Harvester Fanzine Dear Colin— I'm pretty sure your name is Colin Entropy , dude. Thanks for writing, —Imogen jgH^ Hi MRR— Since Graham mentioned it in his last column, I feel like I have to say this again. By participating in or attending the University of San Francisco’s record swap a person is saying she/he supports USF’s decision to shut down and their attempt to sell radio station KUSF, she/he opposes the efforts to stop the sale of the KUSF license and she/he does not want KUSF to return to the San Francisco airwaves. The swap was created by the radio station volunteers who were locked out of the station by USF on January 1 8, 201 1 . Its success is due to the hard work of those volunteers. The fact that the university continues to operate the swap is just another insult to the ousted volunteers. I don’t expect record dealers to care about anything other than their wallets, but hopefully punks have integrity and do not go to this record swap. When no one shows up to buy their shit maybe they’ll start to get a clue. savekusf.org XO, —Carolyn Keddy HH Dear MRR— While I am able to handle this poorly printed mag, the boyfriend is not. Black fingerprints on toilet seat, walls, white kitchen appliances... and for the price he paid for the subscription I would expect more. Sick of cleaning your substandard rag. —Tracy Jj Dear MRR— This is not a letter to the editor, but to the entity/idea that “is” MRR. I’m writing to say, “Thank you!” I picked you up when I was sixteen (1986). I wrote in, placed classifieds, made fanzines and music of my own. I later wrote scene reports, which you published, interviews (both with others and some on my own), which you published. I subscribed when I could. I place tons of ads in you. I still see you on shelves now and again and read you when I can. Haven’t told you how much I like you or how important you’ve been the last couple of years, and wanted to now. Hope all is well. I love you. —Adel Souto Dear MRR— This is Paul from Give Praise records and this letter is in response to the letter from Issue #361 about Give Praise records not sending a print catalog. Basically, I was sent a $1.00 (two stamps) for a printed catalog— I haven’t done a\" printed catalog in almost over two years, just because the stock changes so frequently that it would be hard to keep an updated catalog current. I used to advertise in my MRR ads, that I did do a print catalog, but as I said that was over two years ago. I got the letter and two stamps, and saved the stamps to send back a few magazines and a letter, I put it in my label paperwork pile, and because I no longer do a print catalog, it went to the bottom. It got shuffled and buried, and basically I totally forgot about it. I apologize that this happened and really appreciate the support I get as a label. To fix this, I have sent a package out with the exact two stamps I was sent and a few magazines on the house. Again, I apologize for this, but packing records and getting mail-order out usually takes most of my attention (if not all of it!). I seriously appreciate all the support from the underground punk and hardcore community. Take care, —Paul / Give Praise records There have always been scam alerts in the MRR letters section. I have to say in MRR!s experience , dealing with Give Praise has been nothing but smooth and professional without the pretension of dealing with (i the man.” I can go as far as saying it has been fun, because Paul is a kind and funny dude (and an occasional smart ass). Keep up the good work! —Mariam Hey MRR!— I just got my copy of MRR with the review of my zine Aseptic in the mail. Thank you! However the info in there is wrong. My zine is NOT $2 ppd. It’s $2 PLUS postage! They sell for $1.50 wholesale and shipping for one zine is typically $1.30. Thank you! —Kelly/ Aseptic To Whom It May Concern— It’s been years since I’ve seen a Maximum Rocknroll, but street punk is in my blood. I am a 39-year-old San Diego native so was blessed to be a part of the SoCal scene pretty much until I popped in 1997. For the last decade I’ve been slammed down in Pelican Bay’s SHU on some real flaky gang association bullshit and wanted to give you a heads up on an upcoming hunger strike we’re putting together for better conditions for all prisoners in California. Right now the plan is to l LETTERS kick it off on June 1 8 th unless the governor can intervene and change our situation immediately, which we all doubt that will come about before we all starve ourselves. We are serious and will be going on an indefinite hunger strike where surely some of us may be forever be injured. But we must stand up and now! We have outside support already with the “Hunger Strike Collation,” anyone interested can check out Pelican Bay hunger strike on the internet. So my reasoning for this letter was two fold. Fd like to write an article for the convicts and family members who might read Maximum Rocknroll regarding the plight of the SHU prisoner in Pelican Bay in hopes of shedding some light on a real bad situation. And for other prisoners everywhere, too. Do you think that is possible? I feel I can describe in detail the grind it takes on one’s mind year after year being isolated in a box for no reason other than refusing to talk. (i.e. rat out) The information is widely known on the truth of what’s going on back here and the internet is so full of it through the hunger strike solidarity, so no one needs to just take it from me, go check it out and give it the gut test of your own. . .I’ll keep this short for now, but Fd really appreciate knowing where you guys come down on this cause... so drop me a line... And if you got an old mag laying around toss it my way too if that’s not too much fuss for ya. . .? Let me know. Cheers mates! Working class hooligans united. Respectfully, —Jimmy I can 't speak for each individual involved with MRR, hut / can speak for myself. While 1 could never claim to fully understand any situation that would lead someone to starve themselves , Hunger strikes have been historically used by those who have been stripped of power and ultimately, their humanity, as an action to reclaim some control of their situation— to gain the attention of the world which has largely forgotten them. While clearly there are people locked up who created victims of their own, there are many in prison who are victims themselves— and while I understand it is a complicated issue, those are people I can say 1 support. —Mariam Dearest MRR— Can you please pass on to Furious George that he is a dick. I usually love reading his column and find it hi-larious. Super funny. Though... his last column left a sour taste in my mouth. It is a very wide sweeping generalization to assume that all women everywhere “just don’t dig” Red Dwarf. Wrong! I am a huge fan of that show! I started watching it years ago when I was a wee lass. Chris Barrie as Arnold Rimmer the hologram. . . too good. Even the sketch Dave Hollins’ Space Cadet, which Red Dwarf is based on, is fantastic. American pilot... weird. So. Furious George. Red Dwarf is not “just a guy thing.” You can have Slayer... just not Red Dwarf. Comic Brilliance! So. Yeah. Your column is awesome. Thanks MRR\\ —Anna So Hey MRR - From one Punk institution to another, we want to run a 1/6 page ad for a year. I’m sending a check. I hope this helps you survive in the era of “the Death of Print.” Personally, I really appreciate what you do and the fact that you keep on doing it. Thanks for giving Felix a soapbox. I like reading about antique furniture. Superfly and Finnish HC. —Tim and Extreme Noise in Minneapolis. 20 more years of Extreme Noise! 30 more years of Maximum Rocknroll. Thanks! This helps us out a lot and we really appreciate your support! Thanks to you and all the punks involved with Extreme Noise for all of your hard work! The fact that the store has been going for so long and that punks in Minneapolis, and around the world, support it, is inspiring. We have to keep our DIY spaces open! And, yes, where would we be without Felix teaching us how to properly package and mail a record. —Mariam , ft i&t Comm?! jW*TO ' ^svcoWWJS/ i&v&s, i«t KM>V/ * 1 1 *1 M Lt Cotf oi! /*; SIP ar 4 nS You AA MRR’s classic int’l HC comp, back in print on vinyl for the first time in 20 years!

What's up dude, I just got back from two months of tour. I was touring on this book I wrote called Nevada. I mean, everybody knows that reading isn't cool. Or punk. But whatever, sometimes we just write and publish a novel and go on a two- month tour for it anyway. And it was really good, dude. My publisher fucking paid for gas! I stayed with friends and friends of friends everywhere... this girl gave me a joint in Houston and this guy gave me a bunch of mushrooms in Asheville. Pretty much, like, it turns out that touring in bands is the fucking worst compared to touring on a book. Which actually brings me to my first point in this month's column, which is about What I Learned On My Book Tour 1. Punk Rock Fucking Sucks Halfway through tour I ended up spending a week in the Montpelier, Vermont area. Some circumstances happened and I ended up having to drive down to Brattleboro and back in the middle of the night one night — only I didn't have my own car at the time, so I borrowed my friend Katy's car. It was a very fancy rental car, like one of those big square cars they advertise at suburban boys with money who think they might grow up to be rappers one day? I was totally stoked to borrow it because some circumstances had transpired in Phoenix that led to me having a very fancy pen in which you can unscrew the top part and it turns out there's a two gig USB drive tucked away in there. I did what anybody would do when confronted with a two gig USB drive, which was to fill it up with Fugazi and Godspeed You! Black Emperor MP3s. So I was like, coooooool, Katy's car is new and it's going to have a USB port thing and I'll be able to listen to all my cool MP3s! I was wrong, though: the USB port didn't work. Like I plugged in my cool thing and the stereo would, like, acknowledge that I had put in a thing that said Fugazi on it, but not play any of the MP3s? It was dumb but it turned out that the car also had a fancy satellite radio thing in it! Turns out satellite radio kind of sucks too, but — l am getting to the point — on one of the satellite radio stations (the punk station) a very old and crotchety still alive member of the Ramones was doing a punk music show! For like four hours or something! Well. Turns out either my understanding of what constitutes \"punk rock\" is really skewed, or else the drummer from the Ramones is wrong about it. And I get how canon works, I know my dumb understanding is wrong. I mean, the punk stuff I like is all either pop punk I liked when I was fifteen, scrEaMOcore I liked when I was twenty, or made by women and the occasional non-woman queer. But Marky Ramone played a four-hour barrage of songs by angry teenage dudes singing about angry teenage dude bullshit, punctuated by like one Plasmatics song! Or else angry men singing about teenage dude bullshit. Who cares! I mean, I know I'm a big queerdo who plays in a doom metal band with a cello sometimes or whatever but I just forget, most of the time, that this is what punk rock mostly is. And I mean I know that I'm a humorless feminist lesbian anti-capitalist witch who doesn't think anything is funny except this joke Francesca told me: Knock knock. Who's there? Fugazi. Fugazi who? Ice cream eating motherfucker. But I just forget that when people talk about punk rock they're usually talking about like... Agnostic Front, or something. I dunno maybe Agnostic Front rules and I just wasn't paying attention right when Marky Ramone played them but when I think punk rock I think the Maple Rabbit song \"Fuck Macho Bullshit Forever\" way before I think, like, \"Bro Hymn.\" I just completely forget that punk rock is full of dudes being tough and singing about their boring problems or the boring things they are angry about, like heterosexual sex or \"politics.\" Like, when a bunch of white twenty year olds get interviewed in Maximum and say dumb stuff about the way they don't believe themselves to be implicated in the gentrification of their cities? Turns out punk rock is mostly closer to that than it is to fucking +HIRS+. I just forget! 2. Everywhere Rules. Everywhere I went was awesome! I'd get to Tucson and TC Tolbert would show me the top secret Melrose Place pool in the back part of Casa Libre, and then the next day I'd walk around downtown and find multiple biographies of Yukio Mishima in multiple used bookstores and be like, oh my fucking god, Tucson rules, I had no idea! Or Td go to the middle of fucking Tennessee and a million queers would show up at Austin's house and an older lesbian with short grey hair would listen to my synopsis of Nevada and be like, that sounds boring, I wrote a story recently about a Jewish lesbian who ends up in heaven and is like, what the fuck, but then she finds out that heaven is actually just a farm where aliens keep souls until they eat them. And I'd be like, fuck man, I could live in the middle of Tennessee! Or I'd go to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where I'd hang out with Alice and AJ and smoke all their weed and then Alice would sneak a bunch of fancy makeup (which is a thing she knows a lot about; one time she was like, can I do your eyebrows, and I was like, okay sure, and then she was like, can I do your makeup, and I was like, sure, and then it was basically the scene in The Breakfast Club where Molly Ringwold gives Ally Sheedy a makeover to look less like a fucking gross mess) into my bag without telling me and I wouldn't find it until a week later, when I was staying at the Arlington Hotel in Maynooth, Ontario, which my friend and a couple of her friends bought last year, where they have like open mics COLUMNS and music and book reading and all the things, out in a town where the main other things you can do is go to the general store or go to a diner that closes after lunch. And then I'd be like, fuck, Maynooth, Ontario rules! I got to hang out with Morgan Page and Trish Salah and Zoe Whittall and all these other amazing people in Toronto, which made it almost okay that the border guard rifled through everything in my car on the way up. Although, admittedly, my story sounded totally bullshit: uh, I am... a student, I guess? I rented this car with New York plates in Vermont, I don't really live anywhere... okay yeah I'll pull into a numbered space. Luckily though, check out this border crossing tip: keep hormones in your trunk! The border patrol people might be so interested in your hormones that they overlook whatever contraband you're smuggling over the border. Not that I was smuggling anything. Except love! Love for places. Turns out if you stay with cool queers everywhere then you will fall in love with everywhere. Kinda makes sense when you put it that way I guess. 3. Nothing Else. I try not to learn stuff. You can still get that book at topsidepress.com/nevada. If you want to explain to me what's so cool about Agnostic Front, email imogen@ keepyourbridgesburning.com Take please! \"He's so cute,\" says my Auntie Joan, as Scooter, aka P.J., my Yorkshire Terrier spins in circles for her and licks her nose. \"I bet he does that for all the girls!\" my aunt then says. I say nothing. My dog is smart. \"Hello, puppy-doo,\" Auntie Joan says to P.J. and he sneezes with excitement, and barks at the size of her Jew-fro. It's what my hair would look like if I would let it grow. Never. \"Anyway,\" says Auntie Joan, who I used to call \"Anti-Joan\" when I was a teenager cause it was so punk rock, \"is there anything I can do for you?\" She's asking because I just had my second major surgery of the year. This time, besides cutting me vertically open and giving me a huge flesh zipper, they cut me side to side. Ouchy. I tell her I'm fine, that I love her, and that I am glad she's offered to help take care of me since I really couldn't even make it to the bathroom myself. She then asks about P.J., my now 9 pound Yorkie, and how exactly I got him. I start to tell her and realize it's been eight years since my ex-wife got him for me. Time flies when you're in love with your dog. *** \"Hey, P.J.,\" I say to my pal, who is seated next to me on the couch, while I'm playing Duke Nukem on the PlayStation, \"Ya wanna go out and get a beer or something?\" P.J. just looks at me with that look. That look where he tilts his head, and stares at me like I'm crazy. \"You know, a beer,\" I explain, \"a Budweiser, or Grolsh.\" I like Grolsh — started drinking it in eleventh grade. It has those tops that you can re-seal, so it stays good in your locker. P.J. says nothing. I guess I'm getting the silent treatment. \"Okay,\" I say, \"we're going out.\" And we do. Once outside, we take a walk to the corner deli, and I get a Miller. It was either that, or Coors Silver Bullet. And that's pussy beer. Outside again, P.J. and I take a walk to the local park, and sit on a bench there. I sip my Miller, and P.J. checks out the local action. Lots of women are walking around in their skirts and tennis shoes. It's just past five, and the evening rush has begun. \"What do ya think of her?\" I ask P.J., pointing to a girl wearing a nice tan pants suit, with Nikes. She has long brownish hair, rosy cheeks, large green hoop earrings, and a nice butt. P.J. says nothing, but looks at her. His head follows her as she walks past us. He just stares at her, and then begins to pant. \"Put your tongue in your mouth,\" I say, \"don't be so obvious.\" But P.J. ignores me, and does the same thing when a blonde with a low cut sweater walks by. \"The art to watching women,\" I explain to my pal as I sip my beer, \"is to not be so damn conspicuous. Look like you are looking at something else. Maybe reading the paper or something. But if you just stare at them, they'll know!\" P.J. again just looks at me like I'm nuts. So I ignore him and concentrate on my Miller. A few minutes later we spot a stunning brunette across the street. She's wearing a green overcoat, tight jeans, and eyes as blue as Windex. She's hot. \"Whoa,\" I say. P.J. says nothing. He just starts panting again. Heavy. Suddenly the brunette spots us and smiles. Then she crosses the street and starts to walk toward us. I feel my heart start to beat fast, and my hand starts to sweat even though I'm grasping a cold beer. P.J. starts with his tongue again. \"Hi guys,\" says the brunette as she finishes crossing the street, and enters the small park where we are seated. \"Urn, hi,\" I say, sheepishly. \"You are so cute!\" she says, and then a big smile crosses her face. \"Thank you,\" I say, beginning to blush. \"Not you,\" she says, then points to P.J., \"him!\" I look at P.J. It's like the hundredth time this has happened. Chicks spot us and then they go for P.J. Even though he pants with his tongue hanging out. I take a good look at my pal, with his dark brown eyes, curly facial and body hair, and nubby tail. He's a Yorkshire Terrier. So what? He's fucking three pounds. And he gets more chicks in one day then I could get in a lifetime. This isn't punk rock. But let me back up a bit. *** About six months to a year earlier, I started whining a lot that I wanted a puppy. Really bad. Wendy, my ex-wife, got me a virtual pet, one of the Japanese things, and it died. But not before it turned into a chicken, a lizard, and Henry Rollins. A head with a thick neck. \"You can't take care of a virtual pet, how can you expect to take care of a real dog?\" she asked me. \"It's different,\" I explained, \"virtual pets are tougher than real animals. They're Japanese.\" Wendy asked me what the fuck I was talking about and I admitted I didn't know. But that that excuse sounded good. \"Well,\" she said, \"maybe one day you can have a real dog.\" \"When?\" I asked her, \"You always say that! I'm all grown up now, I think I deserve a dog!\" \"We'll see,\" she said. And for months I bugged her for one. Then came my birthday. Well, a few days before it, anyway. Nick, my stepdad, was over, and we were playing Dark Forces on the PlayStation. The doorbell rang, and I went to answer it. It was most likely Wendy, and most likely she didn't have her keys, because key-loss runs in her family. I opened the door and there stood Wendy, and our pal, Allyson, who is way punk rock. 00LUM33 L. I held the door open, and they both walked in. I then went back to the couch and continued to show Nick how to shoot storm troopers so they scream \"arrgh!\" and die. Wendy and Allyson walked over to us, and Wendy tried to hand me a shoebox. Well, a sneaker box. Converse. \" Take this box, George,\" she said, nonchalantly, \"it's something I found for you.\" Then she handed me the box. Or tried to. I told her I was busy killing Darth Vader's troops on an alien moon, and that I'd take it later. \"Take it now!\" she exclaimed. I looked at her and Allyson. Allyson had her hands on her hips, and looked pissed. So did Wendy. \"Put the box down, and T 11 take it later,\" I said, as I shot a storm trooper right between the fucking eyes. He yelled, called me \"Rebel Scum\", then died. Wendy then forced the box into my hands, making me drop the PlayStation controller. \"All right,\" I said, pissed. I held the box and looked at Wendy. It contained Converses. And as much as I think they are cool sneakers, I can't wear them because my feet are flat. She'd be better off giving them to my old pal Rev. Norb. Then the box moved. In my hands. Suddenly I felt my heart begin to race. The last time something moved like that was when I went to move a trash bag outside my old apartment when I was really drunk, after a Ramones show. The bag moved in my arms, then a huge rat jumped out, landed on my shoulder, squealed, and then hauled ass down the street. So I was kinda hesitant to open the box. \"Aren't ya gonna open it?\" asked Allyson, with her cute Brooklyn accent. I looked at her, and Wendy, in shock. All I could think of was that there was a live rat in this box, and when I opened it, it would bite off my nose. The biggest target in sight. \"Open it,\" said Nick. I looked at all three of them. It was a conspiracy. They were all out to get me. I knew it. I just wasn't sure until now. They wanted me to get rabies so I could foam at the mouth like Cujo, then get locked up in Bellevue, where I'd meet a large Indian, who would eventually suffocate me, then free himself. . The box moved again. My heart was now racing faster than Mario Andretti, or that little monkey racer, Diddy-Kong. I put the still unopened box down on the couch, and something popped its head out. It had brown eyes, dark hair, and teeth. And it had a red ribbon around its neck. They'd given me a rodent. \"Well?\" said Allyson, looking at me with her hands still on her hips. I didn't know what to say, so I looked at the thing in the box again. It wasn't a rat. It was a dog. And it was wagging its nubby tail. \"A puppy?\" I said, in shock. \"Yup,\" said Wendy, smiling. \"A puppy?\" I repeated, still in shock. \"That's what it is,\" said Allyson, \"and boy was he hard to take care of at my house! Devil Dog. Hound from Hell!\" \"A puppy for me?\" I said, again. \"Yes it is, George,\" said Nick. \"A puppy?\" I repeated again. I was obviously in shock. It jumped out of its box and started to run around the couch. I just stared at it. I couldn't believe it. A puppy. In our house. I wanted to play Dark Forces again. Some kind of reality. It continued to wag its nub, and run around the couch. \"Aren't ya gonna pick him up?\" asked Wendy. I was kind of afraid to. What if he bit off my nose? \"George,\" said Nick, \"pick up the puppy!\" I bent over and picked it up. It licked my hands and then my face. I looked closely at it, and suddenly began to feel tears well up behind my eyes. Wendy had gotten me a puppy! A real dog! I was a grown up now! Punk Rock! Over the next couple of days we played the name game with the puppy. Also the sleeping in the crate and crying all night game. And the pooping and peeing in the apartment game. The dog won every time. First his name was Sneaker. Because he came in a Converse sneaker box. Hey, it was better than \"Chuck Taylor\". Then it was Lucky. From 101 Dalmatians. Or . the drummer of the Circle Jerks. But that didn't stick either. He just didn't seem like a Lucky. Then it was Pepper, Coco, Brownie, Killer, Moose, Mugger, Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, Marky, Tim, Jello, Ben, Norb, Mykel, Stiv, Cheetah, Sid, Blag, Todd, Joe, Sean, and Mushy Tushie Poo-Poo Boy. That was Allyson's idea. But finally we decided On Scooter. Because he couldn't walk right yet, and his little butt seemed to race faster than his front end. We also decided on P.J. Which stands for Pussy Junior. Named after me, Pussy Senior. And it's good we came up with a name, because it was time for his first vet visit. When I took him in, I felt like a proud Dad. And Wendy, a mom. The vet looked him over, and as he held my son, I held my breath. I was worried. Turns out he's okay, but has a little bronchitis. Then the vet gave us a bill. Wow. It really is like having a kid. The puppy and I soon became great friends, watching television, listening to punk albums, and eating together. We also took long walks and met lots of our neighbors. We were now part of the local dog club. Then I had a couple of gigs with the band out of town. I wanted to cancel the shows, and stay home with P.J., but knew everyone would be disappointed. So I went and played. The whole time I bitched to my band, and our sales-girl pal, Monica, that I missed P.J. They all called me a pussy, and told me to be more punk rock. At our show in Philly, Monica made a sign that said, \"I Love P.J.\" and stuck it on the back of my leather jacket. All night people were asking me who P.J. was and I told them he was my puppy. It didn't even occur to me how they knew the name P.J. I was in puppy heaven. *** \"You are the cutest thing I've ever seen,\" said the brunette, to P.J. P.J. just wagged his nubby tail, and licked her hands as she caressed his tiny head. \"You are so sweet,\" she cooed, and the dog ate it up, jumping up on his hind legs and doing that little puppy dance. \"What's his name?\" she asked. \"Oh, now you talk to me,\" I said, snidely. I was tired of being ignored for a puppy. Everyone looked at him and played with him. Me? I was just his servant. The guy who took him around. His chauffeur. His butler. His poop cleaner. \"So?\" she asked. \"P.J., his name is P.J.\" I said. \"Well,\" she said to the dog, \"you certainly are a cute puppy, P.J.! What's your dad's name?\" P.J. just licked and danced around. He hadn't mastered the English language yet. \"I'm George, punk rock!\" I said to the girl fondling my puppy. \"I'm Andrea,\" said the girl with the glass- cleaner eyes. She then told me it was great meeting me and P.J. An hour later, after she'd told me her whole life story, she asked when she could see P.J. and I again. If I'd known it was this easy to meet girls with a dog. I'd have never picked up a guitar. OQL’JMMS Take My Life, Please. Endnotes: 1. Scooter, aka P.J. passed away a few days ago. I started writing this story almost nine years ago, and Scooter lived until almost 17-years-old. I will miss him more than I'll miss anyone in my life. Of course, Tim Yohannon, Joey Ramone, and Hilly Kristal and my mom come in a close second. Scooter had a great life, and spent some of his later years being a therapy dog and helping sick and dying people. He touched many lives, and stories about him even touched further. I love you. Scooter. Always. Every strain of underground music has its phony counterpart. For punk, the legions of fake stylists are limitless. Aping of punk by musicians who don't associate with punk as a cultural vehicle is so prevalent that it practically constitutes its own \"fake punk\" genre. For some listeners, fake punk records made my bikers, studio musicians, or general deviants are preferred over punk records made by musicians who actually identify as punks. Considering the inherent musical value of many fake punk records, gravitating towards them is understandable. When our beloved late 70s speed freaks and loner cultural miscreants cut tracks in the studio, they yielded some of the most twisted and deranged sounds ever committed to tape. But why do so many listeners prefer fake punk exclusively, to the extent of decrying punk made by self-declared punks with substantial lyrical value or socio-political substance? Many fans prefer not to enjoy punk as a cultural signifier. To some listeners, enjoying punk made by punks for punks necessitates some sort of allegiance to punk as a sub- culture, or investment in punk as an identity. By preferring fake punk, a listener can divorce themselves from the extra-musical connotations of enjoying punk music. But, is it necessary then to identify as a punk to enjoy, say. Antischism, Contravene, or more recently Autonomy? I began considering this after I reviewed a recent record from Autonomy. In the review, I considered whether overtly political music requires listeners to agree with the music before they can enjoy the music, and those who hear Autonomy and agree with Autonomy are going to be punks in most cases. It's a discussion that actually has parallels in the development of 1960s folk music, especially in America. Folk music, in its American 1960s incarnation as protest music, placed the message as the music's focal point. In this sense, it stole the listener's freedom and built an audience exclusively of listeners who agree. That's the reason it didn't last. The American folkie movement collapsed in the wake of electric guitars and politicized folk singers quickly became passe. An artist like Hasil Adkins is an instance of folk music's fake counterpart (his style is more informed by country and blues specifically but let's forget that for now.) What Freestone or Destry Hampton is punk, Adkins is to folk — a stylist adorning himself in the traits of a genre without aligning himself with the culture. Is it a coincidence that Adkins enjoys a greater audience today than his serious, protest-singing, pulpit shouting 1960s peers in folk music do? Barry McGuire's \"Eve of Destruction,\" a certified '60s folk rock classic, requires listeners to invest in his gloomy depiction of 1960s global politics. If you weren't terrified by American involvement in Vietnam, it's hard to enjoy the track. If you aren't critical of corporate greed, it's hard to enjoy Antischism. If you aren't an animal rights sympathizer, it's hard to enjoy Contravene. No matter what you believe in, it's easy to be amused by Hasil Adkins. No matter your conviction, it's easy to bop along with the Vibrators, a band comprised of sessions playing opportunists, not punks. If you like savage and strange rock music, it's easy to get down with so many of the ridiculous singles made by non-punks lovingly compiled on so many Killed by Death volumes and their associated ilk: So, how then to make substantial music doesn't create an ideological ghetto of an audience full of like-minded idealists? Is anarcho an echo chamber? I think these are useful questions. Listeners' increasing proclivity for fake punk is revealing about the effectiveness and longevity of punk music as modern protest song. What then, about fake Oi? The new record from our universally beloved Hard Skin, with its alternate version featuring various guest female vocals, plays into the discussion well. This version, cleverly entitled Why Do Birds Suddenly Appear, features many female vocalists who have nothing to do with skinhead or punk culture, singing utterly cliched UK Oi! lyrics about \"two bob cunts,\" loan sharks, sausage men and other working class themes. I've played it non-stop since its release, but only recently began to analyze why it appeals to me. As someone who doesn't identify with skinhead culture, the logic of fake punk worship applies here to me, in the guise of fake Oi! As in, Oi! grappling seriously with standing in the dole queue, boots, braces, pints and football generally alienates me as someone who feels conflicted about the politics generally accompanying such music. I don't wish to align myself with Oi! as a cultural signifier, but Hard Skin's fake Oi, with such unlikely women as Joanna Newsom singing, doesn't require me to invest in the culture, because she is clearly as detached from the connotations as I am. 1. 1. If you ha've made it this far, you might have patience enough for the new issue of Degenerate. The 12 th issue is now out. It includes a Scraper flexi-disc - the scrappy San Francisco trio's vinyl debut, a feature on David West of Rank /Xerox and Rat Columns, plus a long essay on the nature of the new-fangled post /punk establishment through the lens of Merchandise, Iceage and Savages. 2. I aspire to be called a crack pot. 3. Production is not a topic of discussion reserved solely for sound engineers, proponents of auto-tuned pop, FM hit- making strategists and beat-makers. Production has very real ramifications in all genres and although it's rarely discussed, production on hardcore records is of vital importance. Two recent releases on Canadian imprint Deranged records from Canadian groups Pregnancy Scares and Wild Child illustrate this often dismissed but essential aspect of hardcore music. While firmly grounded in the same hardcore lineage. Pregnancy Scares and Wild Child employ vastly different techniques that illustrate the importance of tone, clarity and sound engineering for the style, and how the studio can be wielded as another instrument, or manipulated to serve and highlight the physical performance of players. 4.

Suss out the hype and iterate your manifesto. COLUMNS Reporting from rainy city where this years' Scum Fest just came and went. I missed more than half of it but managed to drag myself to the opening night to see ACTIVE MINDS, the WANKYS and DOOM, as well as some other nondescript bands of the epic crust and black metal crust variety. The venue was the Dome, the big hall that's adjacent to the smaller but probably better- known gig venue Boston Arms. The hall was full of banners and what looked like rows upon rows of monstrous distro piles, to paraphrase THISCLOSE (who played the second night, pity I missed them). The brothers from Scarborough started early and played a long set full of fast and loud hardcore punk songs. Considering my ACTIVE MINDS reference point, at least as far as records goes, is over a decade oyerdue, I was positively surprised when I saw the band play live for the first time. Firstly because they can now actually play their instruments, and secondly because how hard their sound is. On record, from what I can remember, you could always hear the lyrics and therefore get the message; live however I couldn't understand anything, which was kind of a shame because ACTIVE MINDS is one of the few punk bands today that have something worthwhile to say. The WANKYS were also on early, which is a shame because they're a band that should be enjoyed in a drunken chaotic singalong splashing of beer over your mate's head type of environment, but the band managed to pull it off as usual. Very best of beer heroes. WANKYS barmy army! Finally, legends DOOM played a confident, long set of classics to much joy of the dreadlocked, patched up and presumably middleclass white kids jumping up and down upfront by the stage. As always, us old fools where seen at the back, singing along to some of hits, occasionally changing to ANTI-CIMEX and SKITSLICKERS lyrics which works just as well. All in all, it was a relatively quiet night for me, I did not get too pissed, I did not make a massive fool of myself, did not piss my pants, nor did I get robbed on my way home. I hope the Scum Fest Collective managed to raise plenty of money for the London DIY gig venue project. I hate commercial venues to such an extent that even if an outspoken anarchist punk band is playing it still feels like I am on fucking Myspace. In other news, the Hardcore Anachronistic Assembly Vol 1: International Fanzine Omnibus is out and available through the involved zine editors around the world as well as select distros and record shops. For sure do grab this zine if you can! At the same time, Dan from Lotus Fucker and I co-released a record this month, namely the vinyl EP reissue of the SUN CHILDREN SUN demo CD-R from a year or two ago (on SPHC/ More Noize records). Obviously, I am not going to be a reliable judge as I had a big hand in releasing the record, but if you're interested in Japanese fast punk with weird melodies and weird instruments, and/ or smoking weed and dancing in a punk setting, then this record is for you. Both should be objectively reviewed in MRR one of these days. Last month I talked (and talked and talked and talked) about my favourite band PEOPLE, also from Japan. A day or two after that issue of MRR came out the news broke that the bands' second album Authentic Oral Communication CD will get released on vinyl by Noise Punk records here in England, and it seems it will be out fairly soon. Great news!!! And even better news is that PEOPLE is coming to England for a week over the New Year! I am almost shat my pants when I heard the news. Now, considering that STAGNATION (!!!!) and ZYANOSE (!!!) are also heading this way in the next year, can an old man be allowed to daydream about CONTROL also coming over? If that happens, I'll hang up my hat and say goodbye to all this punk nonsense. If so, my work here is done. Talking about my work. A lot of people have written to ask me if I am going to stop doing More Noize fanzine. The short answer is, \"yes, I am.\" \"Why?\" they ask. Well, the answer is \"why not!?\" Look, I started doing the last issue like two years ago and sitting on a half-finished zine for so long can be really frustrating. But more importantly, it's really hard work (and expensive) to post zines around the world all the time and the benefits are few and far between. Only today did I notice that the Royal Mail have yet again sneakily increased their postage rates, by introducing small, medium and large parcels. Bastards. I guess at a deeper level I am also only too aware that I have become old and cynical. But the truth is that zines should be written by young people with energy and enthusiasm. See above, I barely made it to Scum Fest this year. I had a good time but still managed to get all grumpy about it. So, the question is: Who am I to be writing about today's punk and hardcore? Worse, what if the kids who today read my zine think zines should only be about old bands? Or what if they start a band to play music that sound like one of these old and celebrated bands? Ah shit, this already happened too many times. I am sorry. Anyway, just to underline my terminal irrelevance, here's a top five of records that are getting way too much airtime over at la casa Gunnarsson. 1. The DUNDEES - Sex Switch Underground CD. A few months ago I wrote about the Anarchy Centre Recordings label here in my column, this was one of the releases that I had not managed to get my slimy paws on at the time of writing. This is a ten-track CD of classic Kyushu 1980s punk rock style, played by a gang of \"who's who\" of Kyushu punk including ex-members of the SPUNKYS, CONFUSE, the SPEAKER'S and BASTRY BOYS. If you like crust, you'll probably hate, this record. 2. The SPUNKY BOYS - Prisoner CD. Classic Kyushu 70s punk rock. You will hate this. I know I hated this music when I was 16, and even 28. 3. The DRILL -10 Years Ago Early Yamazen CD. One of Japans first punk bands was the DRILL and they started in Hakata in 1977. The band is considered the origin of punk in Kyushu, and as such as was released on the number one Kyushu punk record label Kings World records in the 1990s. This is a recording from 1994 of songs written in 1977. Listening to it, I am reminded of my dad and uncles drinking beer and having a barbeque, but with a punk attitude. You will probably hate this too, so avoid. 4. CONFUSE - Stupid Life LP. Have you heard of this band? 5. The SWANKYS - Swank! The Rest of Demos CD. Bet you heard of this band too. You know, even my girlfriend and my daughter have gotten used to mocking me for always playing old-timer music. Please kill me. nothing to fear A few weeks ago, I was standing in a basement in front of a small group of friends and strangers early in the evening, still in my work clothes, tuning my bandmate's guitar that I was borrowing. My hands were shaking and I was trying really hard not to vomit all over her tuning pedal because a) COLUMNS rude b) I didn't want the first impression of my new band to be that we were some sort of feminist G.G. Allin thing (\"the lyrics are about complex social issues and personal stuff but have you seen jes puke live it's something else!\"). A first show is always terrifying and exhilarating no matter what band it is or who you are (during Population's first show I literally hid behind the keyboards so nobody could even see my face). I have general social anxiety (imagine how that translates to stage fright) and I didn't have the luxury of being able to hide behind an instrument or run around and jump off of things. I'm not that good at guitar (I'm great at making walls of noise but not much else) and this was to be the first time I sang and played an instrument together in a band since . . . 2004, I think? To make it all the more intimidating, the show was with a bunch of bands/ artists I think are completely amazing. The worst thing that happened was that I forgot some lyrics halfway through one of the songs and nervously repeated something from the first verse (and the mic . stand collapsed, though someone rushed up and saved me and I played through it). We sounded as good as we possibly could have, and some very kind people said some very kind things that they weren't obligated to say so I imagine those things to be the truth. I love being in Population, but Split Feet — the band whose first show I'm writing about — is a different animal to me. I am just as much of a part of a collective in Population, but it has a very different dynamic because of the different people involved. It's personal for me in a much more.blatant way. Both bands are kind of a return to adolescent enthusiasm for music for me, because that's really at the core of why I play and listen to music in the first place — for the sheer love of it. I'm getting to play with genres that were formative loves for me and that's so much fun. (I've started doing a zine called Watershed , collecting stories of people's first experiences with bands or artists that blew our worlds apart, and I'm really enjoying reading and curating everyone's submissions so far. There is so much joy in that.) I'm not the most conventionally attractive person and I am braced for the worst as we go forward because of the undue scrutiny of The Gaze and the idea that the front person is supposed to be hot, but I have such a good time playing with them that all of that narcissistic worry falls away eventually. If a bunch of people on the internet want to quibble about how I'm not hot enough to be singing, that's much more their problem than mine. (Getting to this point has not been easy. I am my own harshest critic in all respects and I have grown to expect this kind of thing because of past experiences.) The first Split Feet show was also a Rock Lotto drawing, and it got me thinking about the fun of throwing together a band not knowing what will come out of it, playing an instrument for the first time, shaking off that fear of being judged and jumping into the deep end just because it's exhilarating and fun to make noise. I am (as you may have figured if you know me or if you follow anything in this space) an intensely critical person (both externally and internally), but I am trying really hard to focus this year on shedding skin, on joy, on doing things that make me happy. I'm not sure if I really know fully all the things that make me happy or even the real shape of happiness, but I know a few of them, and I know that making music is the purest of those things, especially with people I love. I am lucky in both bands I'm in to love my bandmates dearly, to respect them, to be part of a family. Pushing past fear, getting out there, moving toward joy. Making music isn't the only way to get there, and it's not the only thing that matters about punk, not the only position in DIY that keeps things moving. But it's one that I love, and I encourage everyone, as many musicians I look up to have done, to go get it regardless of skill, regardless of experience, regardless of fear. I especially encourage real weirdos of all sorts, people who are non-gender normative, people who have shit to work out, people who don't see our faces reflected back to us all that often in the composition of the bands we love, to get out there and shake it out. Do it through the fear of being judged, being scrutinized, being wrong, fucking up a song, people having endless opinions about you. What matters is your joy, and if this is joyful for you as it is for me, go with all your heart. You might vomit on a tuning pedal, or you might just think you're gonna, and you might blaze through, you might light up the fucking world. As always, you can reach me at modernistwitch@gmail.com / / themodernis twitch.tumblr.com. I'm listening to so much good new music and new music that suits my state of mind nowadays that I can hardly think about topics that would be worth discussing here. Thus being smart, or decidingr for yoselfu how to do punk, is out of the game. No meaning, just nerding. Awkward raging but that isn't true either. I feel like I have disappeared from my social life — still I was there when a friend of mine almost beat up some hip hop DJ at 4am with whom I was smoking weed in the back of a bar— and think that everyone around me has the blues. Truth is. I'm the only one who's having hard times, which in my .mind are harder than in actual reality, but a total apocalypse hanging as a lure in front of me in my one-competitor dog race might indicate some radical changes about the way I survive life. Anyway this should be about music because hearing sounds are still the best thing in life. It's sometimes funny. That how people think about you just because you could be the one to think about. I was listening to an Ian MacKaye Q&A and he said it's really depressing and stupid what has happened to straightedge. It was his thing, it was personal lyrics and now it's a good excuse for people to call me and my friends drug addict fucking faggots. Dude you should try weed with beer and then tell me that it's easy not to get at least half naked and make out with your best buddies. I find it funny how serious some people take our circle of friends, aka the Defekt scene, just because I have written about it a couple years ago here in the magazine. While it was just a personal report on Hungarian punk that I liked back then, for some it's sealed in cement ever since because this is the bible. Like how shocked people are when I don't know some legendary, musician, song or band. Yeah I don't know everything. First of all because I have a strangely functioning memory, second: when I'm listening to music I focus on enjoying it rather than to learn it. For me it doesn't matter when it was recorded, by whom, neither what color shirt the producer was wearing and in what type of chair he was pressing buttons and turning potmeters. Why should I give a fuck? I love how humans' brains work that they are obsessed with information but why the fuck does it matter? For me it is about if I could connect to the music emotionally or not. That's why I just said new music for my state of mind, because I'm listening to lots of music that I have already owned or known about, but lately I approach some of them differently to how I did before. And this is how I like it. I don't care about facts or trivias. I love it when I care enough to memorise them but they won't make music better to me. Shirts on the LP cover r COLUMNS might, but not the back information. I would fucking hate Circus Lupus if I knew Joan Jett was the producer for one of their records. I hate fucking rock and roll, that's the last thing I wanna love. Alright I love the fact that Hiisker Dii was doing backing vocals on the first DYS record, but for me this is when life becomes a mixtape. Some people just cram all the information that is available into their heads and others just try to understand the basics of the subject. It is like how acting works. In some movies you see people play a character, while in the best movies you see people being filmed, who by the way are actors. There's a difference between transforming into another person or just acting in a role. So for me the best bands are not just playing songs because they have learnt notes and figured out how three tunes fit together, but because they play themselves, they have something that could be told through instruments or through screaming like a baby. And I can enjoy the fact that Crass put out Minor Threat in the UK, but mostly because I love both bands and adore their connection, even if their music sounds different. But I only have vague ideas about the exact date of this release because does it really matter? It's just their music that sounds different, not what and how they do it. It could be called pear or could be called apple, what matters at the end is how they taste. And I have no idea what color that girl's eyes were, I just remember hoW I felt when I looked into them, (...alright, I know they were blue, but anyway) Quoting Modern Lovers here, it's that power that matters, I'm in love with that. There are just too many things in life that I wanna do in a really short time. To mash everything together and have that elevated fun. I have this will to do basic stuff. Like write again a zine about music and about how fun is it to fall in love with bands or just one of their songs. I wanna go down to a rehearsal room and jam with a drummer, with me playing guitars blasting out simply raw hardcore songs. Like Faith demos, mixed with no wave New York falling apart shit, with Beach Blvd total drugged-up youth drying dead in the sun, entertaining nihilism. I listened to the first Mika Miko LP and that sounded like this. While it's just simple noise made by awesome people. This is it what I'm looking for, complex things in simple cases. I want people to play power chords the way I can hear through their shredding that they love a million bands and still they have found their peace in playing infinite adolescent punk songs. I want to listen to bands that sound like bootlegged Neos shirts or reading coffee stained novels after midnight in your bed but in a coat. I want this collapsing cottage to be my shelter. I wanna disappear and live forever as a footnote. If anything, being a fan of punk music made me a recluse, but I love this solitude. It has become fun to act for the outsiders like I don't have a life, I don't have thoughts or things I like, just so I don't have to blow my cover of being a fan of crazy damaged music and radical ideas of surviving life. Or living it. Nowadays I'm getting confused by it. But I have high hopes. Because, as it happened with music, I believe that there's gonna be a point where the stone wall of bullshit will just break and through its cracks the real things will come out. Some guy called me up if I want insurance for the flat I live in and I told him no, and as a reply for his question why? I told him because I live like a sixteen year old. He then asked me to hand the phone to my parents but I corrected him. I'm not sixteen, I just live like one. And it felt good just to blow my cover to rise above the bullshit. To tell him how all this game will go, but I won't be a part of it. This is what I look for in music as well to stop the bullshit, to be brave enough t q be freaks. I'm jamming Finnish spunk and Fall and weird post hardcore punk records like Middle Class' Homeland lately. I'm sick for the new Sickoids record and will be amazing to have them here in Budapest, and get drunk with them. Good Throb is my jam, so Crass-like but more concrete with what they are angry about. Crass is articulated for sure but while they sounded like they are playing music for the whole world. Good Throb is yelling against assholes. Also avant-garde-ish bands like Pink Military or Raincoats. The whole world is a mixtape if I have enough space for everything to fade into each other. And the worst fucking shit happened: I started to listen to some jazz musicians but even though they are technically more advanced than the punk players, I love, in a way how this chaotic „we play against each other, we play what we want, we play ourselves with instruments\" method could click with the total teenage angst music that is the kick drum for my heart. But don't believe its progression. I still don't like it that I can appreciate some crazy tunes and I mostly love its benefit to get my focus improved when I look on my music. Maybe it's a better thing to be open to new tunes or realize their greatness than learn all the useless info about bands you should love. Fuck everything that is mandatory. So many great records have come out lately, this means 2013 will be $ joy ride of a year of listening to punk and used- to-hang-out-with-punx-but-now-rather- have-buddies-as-PR-agents bands. Even if I think Church Whip's excuse for naming their tour what they had, and while I hate it when people just shrug their shoulders when it comes to people maybe getting offended and hurt — for real I even hate bands being named after rapists, murders and criminals — I also think by stating something that stupid over a whole coast is like when you say fuck everybody, that's a usual but still stupid punk sentence; while saying fuck a specific group of everybody is just as dumb as racism. So on one hand I think what they got they have deserved. Open a bottle and don't be surprised when something might spill it. I also think that the new Merchandise LP is just sooo good and dreamy it starts to grow on me. Hope they won't be lived up by shit culture. I just recently saw the Men and it was sad as fuck. A band that used to be interesting by mixing almost everything that is good in guitar music has become a band that plays alt rock country bullshit, American dream in Dylan shirts and just a band who plays a type of music or tries to keep up with a trend instead of creating their own sound. They played for mid level managers and for people who drank their cocktails with straws. Maybe it was just me who was enchanted for no reason in the start, but at least I have woken up. New Milk Music is mellow as well but cool too. Even if it's a bit more rockish and mostly stays on mid-tempo, rather than raw and straightahead like they were on their previous records. Even if I suspect some tricks, I can indulge myself in this living for the moment because everything else is shit but „hey, I still got some pot and dumpster- dived pizza so let's party\" sound. They are not doing something new or original, still it seemed people were hungry for their full lenght LP. They toured Europe with a fucking plane. They are not making anything new still it's refreshing to have a band this simple. They don't lie about their music, it sounds like the LP cover for Beyond Living. Total nihilism. It's for you to make you swing your hair around the room. I've heard lots of lame things about them but I'm not innocent either. Is there better proof that your band is playing awesome music than having a really stupid name like Milk Music, yet no one cares about its goofiness really? They sound like artificial nostalgia. They create long time sweet memories of events that you only wish have happened. And here they are with their grand work, a perfected rock record that sounds like a dream of a pot head locked in his room with the will to write songs about his whole i COLUMNS world which is basically his room. It sounds like late night music for those who worked the whole day or haven't worked for ages. They have lost their rawness but they seem to stretch out as far as they wanted and luckily not further, carrying some of the dirt of their past. I was raving about that band here before and they still have it or have it even more. Making epic soundtracks for the spoiled American dream, of how the sun forms all of us. It really sounds like people confused about doing something and that creative power that gets us out of bed, and also that fear of failure in the real world. So imagination creates this shield that is a moment of fragile innocence. Hard Skin always as fun as hell but also catchy as hell, like they have figured out the right formula to write amazing Oi! songs by listening to decade of amazing punk. Just perfect, and everybody was right that there are too many bands whose name start with S. lately I'm nerding out on total hardcore trash of Society Nurse and Stoic Violence. And these are just the new records. I just love everything that is filth and failure- based punk music. And I ran out of space. www.punkersblock.blogspot.hu / vargyai. viktor@gmail.com This column was edited by the amazing Dori Radies who is a hairdresser on fire in London. Go visit her: The Rabbit Hole- Vegan Hair Parlour. RANDOM THOUGHTS When I was doing an honest-to-goodness print zine (the last one was in 2003 but I didn't plan it that way and I never say never), I had a collection of columnists, much like in this publication, and my column was called Random Thoughts. It could have also been called I Was Just Thinking but the idea was I'd have a number of themes /topics to discuss and I'd try to find a clever way to pull them all together into something coherent. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't but I think I'll attempt it in this column because there are connections between the various elements. I'm listening to the REPOS Live Munitions album as I - type this. Not on vinyl but on MP3 because I failed to score a copy on Record Store Day, which has become something of a joke. I just found out that there's going to be a \"regular\" pressing, though. If it's on Youth Attack, I hope Mark McCoy decides to press more than 275 this time. I want this fucking record — even in the compressed format, it's a relentless performance and reminds me that they're one of the best hardcore bands of the past fifteen years. Scour the blogs and track this fucker down. You won't be disappointed. The month this issue hits the streets, Ellen and I will have been married for 25 years — June 5, 1988 was the date. Once we decided to tie the proverbial knot (lame term, I know), Ellen's mom took complete control of the proceedings. You can tell she'd been planning this for years because she already had the caterer, photographer and venue for the reception picked out. Ellen had to deal with most of this stuff. I did pick the band. We went to an agency and were shown videos of various covers bands and I jotted down notes to pick the group that seemed the most tolerable. One of them had a guy wearing dark glasses and I said, \"ooh. I'll bet he thinks he looks really cool in those shades.\" The agent said, \"uh, that's because he's blind.\" Ooops... well, I did end up picking another band and they were decent-enough. Otherwise, I just basically had to show up. Not bad — and my band at the time even got to play a few songs while they were taking a break. We cleared the room in about a minute but it might have had something to do with the fact that they were about to serve desert. Maybe. I won't offer any more wedding anecdotes except one about Ellen's cousin Danny, who's on her father's side of the family (her dad passed away in '77). Her mom had a cousin named Baruch, who was a Rabbi and he'd taken a two-year term at a synagogue in South Africa. Danny's politics were on the left side of the spectrum and, while I only caught part of the discussion, Danny was arguing with Baruch about how he should speak out against apartheid and Baruch said, \"my only concern is with the Jews.\" I mention that anecdote because, somewhere along the way, Danny became Daniel, became a"
