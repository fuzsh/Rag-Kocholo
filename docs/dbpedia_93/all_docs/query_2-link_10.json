In 2002 and 2003 Jean-Pierre Lehmann wrote a series of columns in the Japan Times, “Japan in the Global Era,” which set in motion a series of conversations among the authors that ultimately led to this book. We should start therefore by thanking MATAEBARA Yutaka, the Japan Times editor-in-chief, who made that series possible. Also during this time, the Tokyo office of McKinsey & Company provided a stimulating environment for John Haffner to confront and reflect on important features of modern Japanese business and cultural life: he would especially like to thank Todd Guild, UDA Sakon and Joe Watson (among many others) for interesting discussions and for enabling his development within the firm. Once research for the book began, a number of people very generously agreed to meetings or interviews—in person, over the telephone, or via e-mail—while still others provided very helpful inputs to the argument. Some people would prefer to remain anonymous; in honoring their confidence, we nevertheless remember them and appreciate their contribution. On the theme of Japanese history, Peter Matthews of the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan had much to say. Jeremy Epstein, a former colleague in summer studies at the University of Regensburg, had helpful and well-informed comparative comments on Japanese and German historical attitudes, and Rudyard Griffiths of the\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nDominion Institute was a helpful interlocutor on issues of citizenship, cultural diversity and remembrance. Jeanne Shimazaki of the Tokyo Montesorri School and Martin Schulz of the Fujitsu Research Institute contributed greatly to our understanding of two ends of the Japanese educational spectrum—primary schools and think tanks, respectively. In the realm of communication, Bernardo Carducci of the Shyness Research Institute of Indiana University Southeast had many great insights into the cognitive and behavioral dynamics of shyness, while EBIHARA Takashi and Jonathan Borock provided detailed information on Team Japan, a university debating organization, as a model for improving communication skills. ARAI Sayuri, at the time a graduate student at the University of New Mexico, offered candid, thoughtful ideas about communication patterns in Japan. In the business context, SAKUTA Touko of Asahi Glass had frank comments on women in the Japanese workplace, while CHOW ChiaWei (Carol), MBA student at Cornell’s Johnson School, helpfully shared the experience of being both a woman and a foreigner in a Japanese company. Dr. James Shin had some very useful ideas on the overall Japanese business context, and David C. Fender recounted the odysseys of businesspeople from an earlier era in Japan. FURUUCHI Kazuaki of the Accounting Standards Board of Japan kindly shared comments on international accounting convergence and Japan, following the kind intermediary assistance of Fiona Davitt of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in the United Kingdom and YAMADA Tatsumi, liaison for the IASB in Japan. A number of other people kindly provided helpful economic inputs and background papers, including Daniel Bogler of the Financial Times, Ali El-Agraa, Professor of International Economics at Fukuoka University, Richard Katz of the Far Eastern Economic Review and Eric Noel of Oxford Analytica. In the realm of politics, NAKAMURA Toshihiro, formerly of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, had a helpful perspective on the question of whether the bureaucracy is growing weaker and civil society is growing stronger in Japan. TAKAHASHI Kyoto, a director of the Forum for Citizen’s Television & Media, kindly provided some material on the organization and its mandate. Saul Takahashi, former Refugee Coordinator for Amnesty Japan, responded with great passion and expert knowledge on the critical subject of refugees in Japan. John Campbell at the University of Michigan and KUROKAWA Kiyoshi at Tokai University both had excellent informative comments on Japanese healthcare (thanks also to KUROKAWA-san’s assistant, SUZUKI Megumi) and Colleen Flood of\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxi\n\nthe University of Toronto Law School provided some international context on healthcare accountability issues. Daniel Aldrich, at the time a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard and a Visiting Scholar at the Institute of Social Science at the University of Tokyo, generously shared his research on nuclear power plant siting in Japan. And last but not least, three friends—SUZUKI Kanehiro, HONMA Chiharu and KAWAHARA Taka—had insightful comments on various aspects of Japanese civil society. Taka-san especially deserves praise for his valiant efforts to contact OE Kenzaburo on our behalf. Several people engaged us in wide-ranging discussions across disciplinary boundaries, including our friends David Groth and Maria de la Fuente. Another person who offered very rich and provocative comments on a wide range of subjects was Liga Pang, an internationally recognized ikebana artist and a teacher of teachers at the prestigious Sogetsu School in Tokyo. Annie McKee of the Teleos Leadership Institute, and Peter Salovey, an emotional intelligence expert at Yale, kindly enabled us to test and refine ideas, over phone and e-mail, about how emotional intelligence might relate to challenges in Japanese education, work and social life. Finally, OGAWA Masaharu, while a Fulbright Scholar and an MBA candidate at the Johnson School, Cornell University, freely and generously discussed aspects of modern Japan with the confidence that any differences of opinion, far from threatening friendships, presuppose them. Masaharu and his wife Risa also provided very kind hospitality during a visit by John Haffner to their apartment in Ithaca, New York. The IMD community in Lausanne provided ideas, inputs and support at an early stage of the project; thanks especially to Peter Lorange, David Aikman, Alex Price, Martha Maznevski, HOKAMURA Madoka and Dominique Turpin for helpful discussions on business, organizational and cultural issues. A number of people at the Evian Group also provided ideas and shared their experience: Michael Garrett, Chairman of the Evian Group, formerly Executive Vice President of Nestlé SA for Asia, Africa and Oceania and former President of Nestlé Japan; the late and much-missed co-founder of the Evian Group and former senior MITI official, SEIKI Katsuo; the former MITI Vice-Minister for International Affairs, HATAKEYAMA Noboru; the President of JETRO, TSUKAMOTO Hiroshi; Professors HAMA Noriko and KAJI Sahoko; and senior Foreign Ministry official SUZUKI Yoichi are especially to be thanked. The Evian Group also provided workspace to John Haffner during a visit to Lausanne; in this regard, thanks especially to Inez Colyn, Anne Miserez, and ZHANG Li; also thanks to Neha Mehrotra for her help\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nduring this phase. Toward the end of the project, Suzanne Rosselet was a tremendous resource in helping us with data from IMD’s World Competitiveness Center. Another community environment proved helpful later on: the August 2005 Tokyo conference of the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations, and especially the “trust” workshop at that conference. The conference featured many excellent speakers— especially ARIMA Tatsuo, Ed Baker, Theodore Bestor, David Brunner, Richard Cooper, Christina Davis, FUJIWARA Kiichi, Andrew Gordon, Russell Hardin, KONOE Sara, Roderick MacFarquhar, MATSUURA, Masahiro, OGAWA Naohiro, Susan Pharr, Richard Samuelson and YAMAGISHI Toshio. Their research and comments refined our understanding of a number of important issues. Once our draft manuscript was ready, we received further invaluable assistance. Readers Andrea Gede-Lange, Weiguo He, Jeet Heer, Janos Libor, Ian Mason and Avery Plaw all provided very helpful comments on the argument. Avery in particular offered extremely detailed, incisive comments that surely required a lot of time and effort on his part. FUJI Hana provided a helpful review of the text for Japanese names, word usage and spelling; we did not leave her a lot of time, however, and made a few changes subsequent to her review, so of course any remaining errors are our sole responsibility. Hana-san also had some helpful perspectives on the Japanese workplace. We also benefited enormously from the wonderful comments of a very thoughtful Japanese reader who would prefer to remain anonymous, comments addressed both to the substance and the tone of our argument. We have tried to strike a balance between candor and friendly encouragement, between frank discussion and intercultural sensitivity, and this reader greatly helped us to improve that balance. At Yale University in 2008, thanks to James Kondo, a colleague of John Haffner’s in the World Fellows program (and a former McKinsey Japan colleague) for several quite helpful discussions, thanks to Professor Paul Kennedy for his kind assistance on a matter, and especially, thanks to Esteban Tapetillo and Samantha Diamond of Yale College for their good humored and first-rate research assistance. Many thanks to Tej Sood, Alex Beecroft and the publishing team at Anthem Press for the opportunity they have given us to publish with a nimble, responsive and fast-moving publishing house, and for their good humor, patience and practical suggestions through the publishing process, including their identification of two excellent peer reviewers who served as helpful critics and commentators on our argument. We would like to thank especially the person we\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxiii\n\nknow as Reviewer 1, whose erudition and specific suggestions were invaluable in helping us to make very significant improvements to the manuscript. Finally, thanks to our editors at various stages. Andy Lamey had the hardest task, and did a brilliant job of editing an early version of this narrative. Dan Westell committed a skilled “drive-by” edit on a more mature version under tight time constraints, and John Hookey, an editor obtained by Anthem, deftly brought us to the finish line in collaboration with Anthem’s internal staff. This book was not written on behalf of any institutions; the arguments expressed herein are solely those of the authors. And more precisely, even among the three of us, we do not always see eye to eye on the content of every line, but we have sought to achieve consensus with respect to our overall argument and to identify the most salient points in support of that argument. None of the people or institutions mentioned in the text necessarily agrees with any part of our argument, or the thesis of the book as a whole. Any errors or omissions remain our sole responsibility.\n\nSome Notes on Style\n\nJ\n\napanese, Chinese and Korean names are normally shown last name first, with the last name in capital letters (e.g., KOIZUMI Junichiro). Exceptions are made for individuals with Western backgrounds, (e.g., Francis Fukuyama) or mixed cultural roots or identities (e.g., Liga Pang), as well as for major figures of Japanese history known by their first names (TOYOTOMI Hideyoshi is known as Hideyoshi).

In a few decades, Japan rebounded from wartime devastation to the world’s second-largest economy, now valued at almost 4 trillion dollars. It did so without much in the way of natural resources or land, with neither the oil of Saudi Arabia nor the vast natural resources of the United States. This achievement is without parallel and stands as an inspiration to developing and developed countries alike. Japan has the longest life expectancy in the world, universal access to healthcare, very high levels of literacy and basic education, and an impressively equitable wealth and income distribution (though there has been a deterioration and growing inequality in Japan recently). Japanese social life functions smoothly, with great masses of people in the most densely populated large nation on earth showing patience and mutual regard, even when in near-asphyxiating proximity to one another. One can walk freely almost anywhere without fear of being mugged, and a lost wallet is very likely to find its way back to its owner. The streets are clean, the city air quality is good and the transportation system is a model of precision and efficiency. Visitors to Japan can be shown extraordinary kindness. Japan also boasts many world-leading industries; parts of its manufacturing sector are hugely successful, specifically those in the export sector exposed to international competition. Nippon Steel is a world leader in steelmaking and Toyota produces more automobiles than any other company on the planet. Japan’s machine tool industry is the world’s largest, and its robots, automotive components and electronics brands are recognized worldwide for their excellence.\n\n2\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nThe country has also produced many great consumer innovations— sushi bars, digital watches, and the Walkman, among numerous others. Japan has also given the world much in the way of new approaches to work organization and worker empowerment, and in creativity, leisure and art; so-called “soft exports” ranging from Zen meditation techniques, to karaoke, to innovations in product quality, to the artistry of manga and anime, to the taste of sake. Young people in Asia and other parts of the world find inspiration in Japanese fashion, television series, video games, music, movies, motorcycles and its ineffable cool factor (at least as they perceive it from a distance), while Japanese artists have shown the world remarkable new ways of seeing grains of sand, flowers and even empty space.\n\nFrom Feudal State to Nation-state It is quite incredible how far Japan has traveled in the last two hundred years to become the remarkable country it is today. It is only with hindsight that it might seem obvious why Japan would, uniquely among non-Western countries, rapidly achieve a momentous transformation in the nineteenth century from a feudal state to a nation-state—and go on to became a great power. In many respects the Japanese leaders of the time were more forward-looking than their counterparts today. To compete in the terrifying (by Japanese eyes) global environment of the late nineteenth century and in the face of the overwhelming global power of the West, the leaders at that time resolved not only that Japan should learn from the West, but it should also open positions (in the army, civil service, education and industry) to the most talented, irrespective of feudal origins or social status. The event usually associated with the beginning of modern Japan is the Meiji Restoration of 1868. It has been described by the historian William Beasley as, above all, a “nationalist revolution.”1 It witnessed the “return” of the Emperor from an isolated lamaesque existence in Kyoto to becoming both the head of state and the embodiment of the nation, the latter derived from his “divine origins.” In fact, nothing better encapsulates the nature of the new Japanese nation-state, developed on the European model, than the multiple photos taken and widely distributed of the Emperor Meiji in Prussian military garb. The Japanese nation sought new glories both in accumulating economic wealth by industrialization and by gaining geopolitical\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nwealth in becoming an imperial power, conquering and colonizing some of its neighbors. Japan became, for all intents and purposes, a modern, industrial, colonial member of the exclusive club of Western powers. By the first quarter of the twentieth century, Japan’s success in its transformation made it not only the only non-Western state to gain respect—even if grudgingly—from the West, it was also a model to many non-Western countries, not only in Asia, but also in the Middle East and North Africa. Quite a number of countries tried to follow Japan’s lead in becoming a nation-state: notably Egypt, Tunisia, Thailand and China. But none succeeded like Japan succeeded. Japan’s nationalism, however, as successful as it was, gave way to ultra-nationalism. Of course, Japan is by no means the only nation to have regressed into destructive, maniacal politics in the first half of the twentieth century. But the point is that while Japan had succeeded in becoming a big-time nation-state and an empire in a short few decades, it also rapidly fell into the trap of what historian Paul Kennedy has called “imperial overstretch.”2 Or, to make the point in more prosaic terms, in the late ‘30s and early ‘40s Japan bit off far more than it could chew. By the end of World War II, the glory of Japan’s rise was replaced by the humiliation of its fall. But then, as immense luck would have it, Japan was visited by three successive divine winds that led the United States to want to strengthen Japan as the bulwark of the American alliance in the Pacific: the Cold War, the Chinese revolution and the Korean War. By 1950, occupation policy underwent a radical shift, with the urgent objective of strengthening the country. From the 1950s onward, the Japanese establishment was able to concentrate on economic reconstruction with the United States as ally and benevolent protector. The United States guaranteed both Japanese security and an export market for Japanese products, and Japan was able to outsource its security concerns to the United States under the so-called Yoshida Doctrine, named after the first postwar Prime Minister, YOSHIDA Shigeru, who skilfully worked with the American Occupation while protecting, indeed promoting, Japanese national interests. He is the grandfather of the Prime Minister at the time of writing, ASO Taro. Japan lost the war, but it did very well out of the peace, and for several decades it was able to focus on getting rich without much concern for geopolitics. But Japanese nationalism never went away; it morphed into a new shape. The distinctiveness of Japanese nationalism in the second half of the twentieth century is that it is mercantilist—that is, focused on economic goals. Having learned from the catastrophe of the 1940s,\n\n4\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nmilitary nationalism was eschewed. In the 1970s, the former Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (the father of recently assassinated Benazir), described the Japanese as “economic animals.” The Japanese resented the description, but at the same time recognized the syndrome and continued to behave accordingly. Similarly, when in the ‘80s a senior European Community official, Sir Roy Denman, described the Japanese as “workaholics living in rabbit hutches,” there was quite a lot of umbrage at the diplomatic level, but the Japanese again tended to recognize that it did, to a considerable extent, correspond to reality. But they persisted. Although nationalism in Japan is not the force it was in the nineteenth or twentieth century, it—and its offshoot, mercantilism—are still pretty much the only “isms” that one can apply to Japan quite confidently and accurately.\n\nPre-Modern, Modern and Post-Modern States To understand Japan’s position in the nationalism spectrum, it is useful to borrow from Robert Cooper’s pamphlet The Postmodern State and the World Order, in which Cooper distinguishes three types of states: pre-modern, modern and post-modern.3 The pre-modern state is characterized by decentralized power structures, identities, loyalties, economies, administrative and juridical systems and often, languages. Pre-revolutionary France was a pre-modern state: the vast majority of the population did not speak French, the sense of a French identity hardly existed and, as Montesquieu commented, in traveling across France you changed legal systems as often as you changed horses. Tokugawa Japan was another salient example of a pre-modern state; Marx opined that Tokugawa Japan presented the most entrenched form of pre-modern feudalism. Regional dialects prevailed. Satsuma-ben (the language spoken in the southern Satsuma fief) was incomprehensible to Edoites and other nonSatsuma Japanese. The same gulf applied to identities and loyalties. The modern state, as with France during the revolution and then under Napoleon I, witnessed centralization in every respect. The levée en masse of the citizens, inaugurating what later would become prescribed national military service, transformed the very concept of military organization and spirit. National armies had not existed in the past. Paris emerged as not just a dominant center, but the dominant center. The Napoleonic Code eradicated the local systems and codes of jurisprudence, with national French law now reigning in absolute\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nsupremacy. The modern educational system that developed in the course of the nineteenth century stressed the common French national myth, and insisted on the exclusive use of the national French language. Through the army, education, political power, the central legal system, an integrating economy and the proliferation of national symbols and myths—the tricolor flag, the veneration of Joan of Arc— and also eventually with the creation of a French empire, the modern French state came into being.4 “What is a nation?” This was the question posed by Ernst Renan, a leading nineteenth century French philosopher, and the title of one of his publications, in 1882.5 A country, he argued, is delineated by borders and usually has various symbols, notably a flag. A nation is much more. While a country is a physical construct—mountains, cities, lakes—a nation, as Renan argued, possesses a soul. It, he continues, “has a soul, and is a spiritual principle.”6 Nations are in great part made of myths derived from a common collective view of the past. This sense of past legacies is coupled by a desire to perpetuate them. As he moves towards his conclusion, Renan declares, “To share great glories and achievements in the past, wishing to achieve more now and in the future: these are the essential conditions to be a nation.”7 By the time Renan penned his famous opus, the French modern state was—or seemed—impregnable. In following the dictums of Renan, nineteenth century Japan not only became a nation-state, it became a modern state. No nonWestern state other than Japan (and relatively few Western states) succeeded in carrying out this transformation until well into the twentieth century. In becoming a nation-state, a lot of Japan’s systems and institutions were initially modeled on France and subsequently on Bismarckian Germany. All the features that Japan used in the creation of its modern state were the same as those that prevailed elsewhere: a national education system, a national military system, a unified national legal system, political power vested in the national capital, an integrated national economy (e.g., a single currency, the abolition of internal trade barriers), industrialization and a nationalist ideology. Just as European countries went from nationalism to jingoism—as brilliantly illustrated in Richard Attenborough’s 1969 film about World War I, “Oh! What a Lovely War”—so did Japan. And just as most European nations became imperialistic—even including that hodgepodge of a nation-state, Belgium—so did Japan. Of course there were Japanese variations to the modernization story—the emperor system based on Shinto may be one—but these are variations on a universal theme. If you want to be a modern\n\n6\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nnation-state, you must have those generic attributes that Japan sought and then gained. If you do not, you do not become a modern nation-state. There is no particular Japanese recipe. The tailoring might differ from place to place, but the basic costume remains the same: in the late nineteenth century, the Prussian military uniform was pretty popular for political and military types, just as morning coats were for financiers. The industrialization-driven nationalist nation-states of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries bestowed upon the planet exploitative imperialism—the French in Algeria, the British in South Africa, the Japanese in Korea, the Belgians in the Congo, the Dutch in Indonesia, the Americans in the Philippines, among many other examples—lots of wars (especially two “world wars”), extremist ideologies such as fascism and communism and some awful atrocities. This is the panorama on which the renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm drew in entitling his 1995 history of the twentieth century, The Age of Extremes. The crisis of modernism, which culminated in the ideological, psychological and physical violence of the first half of the twentieth century, paved the way for the post-modern state. A key distinguishing feature between the modern and post-modern state is power. In the modern state, even among democracies, power is highly centralized, not only in the sense of the capital city (Berlin, Paris, Tokyo), but also in the limited circles in which it is exercised. The circle of power is what has been termed “the establishment”; it generally consisted of an alliance between government, industry, high finance, the military and perhaps “the establishment church.” The post-modern state, by contrast, has power diffused not only in the geographic sense of the term, but also in social terms. The establishment does not disappear, but it is much more subject to competing pressures and influences. Whereas, for example, in the modern state the media is highly controlled, in the post-modern state it is not only independent, but also often a priori critical of the establishment. The empowerment of civil society is an especially noticeable dimension of the post-modern state. Organizations such as Greenpeace, WWF and Amnesty International are among the most influential entities in post-modern societies. This change in power structures also gives rise to highly differentiated attitudes. The modern state demands obedience, discipline and respect. The post-modern society veers towards the irreverent, where nothing (church, monarchy, government, army, etc.) is sacred, as the British Queen would be only too ready to acknowledge—a very far cry from\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nVictoria’s day! Though political satire has existed throughout history, it has become a prevailing post-modern genre. Power in a post-modern society is diffused not only internally, but also internationally. The modern state is obsessive about sovereignty. The post-modern state wants to preserve sovereignty, but is pragmatic. Organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO)—and in the European Union (EU), the Commission and other European institutions— erode national sovereignty while they play a highly influential policy role. But they also yield benefits in so doing. In economic terms, too, one can draw broad distinctions. The pre-modern state harvests the land; the modern state focuses on making things; and the post-modern state focuses on knowledge creation and trades in services and information and lots of intangibles. While an economy focused on making things might benefit from an educational system that instills discipline and good basic standards, an economy focused on knowledge and services needs, above all, to inculcate a capacity for creative thinking.8 The underlying philosophy also differs quite radically. In the modern era, leading thinkers were ones who harbored few, if any, doubts: Darwin, Marx, Hegel, Clausewitz. By contrast, the earliest and one of the most influential philosophical movements animating the post-modern state is existentialism: dogma was replaced by doubt; traditional metaphysics by the quest for authentic individual experiences. Post-modern writers and philosophers, such as Camus, 2iz2ek—are Kafka, Wittgenstein—and later, the likes of Derrida and Z perpetually in doubt, indeed devoured by doubt, just as they are suspicious of structures of power. The transition of Germany from modern to post-modern has been quite prodigious. An evocative illustration can be found in the person of the Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit. Wowereit is a leftist, an internationalist and a self-professed homosexual, who eschews neckties and any other form of formality. Under Hitler, not only were self-professed homosexuals unlikely ever to become mayors, more likely, in fact, they would have been gassed. The change in Germany, its repentance and willingness to come to terms with its past, is strikingly illustrated by the fact that whereas after the war the Jewish population in Germany had dwindled to numerical insignificance, today Germany has the third largest (after France and the UK) and the fastest-growing Jewish population in Europe. These distinctions and stages must not be caricatured.9 Transitions are often incremental and also resisted. In many instances there are tensions. In no instance is this more illustrative than in the debate\n\n8\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nover immigration. In a post-modern society—which also tends to be characterized by declining birth rates and an aging population—not only, as Philippe Legrain brilliantly argues (Immigrants: Your Country Needs Them, 2007), are immigrants a luxury (or a nuisance, depending on your standpoint), they are also an absolute necessity. Not only are bright entrepreneurial immigrants a huge advantage in the service and information industries, they are also required in critical areas, health for example, and in undertaking the dirty, difficult and dangerous jobs that most “natives” eschew. Atavism, however, is a compelling force in most societies, and so unreconstructed modernist nationalists oppose immigration. Thus, the distinctions among the different kinds of societies are not absolute. In primarily post-modern states, the UK for example, there are vestiges of modernism. In Germany, while the lifestyle of the mayor of Berlin may be an indicator of post-modernism, on the economic front Germany also remains a quite formidable “modern” industrial economy. India is the most vivid case of the co-existence of all three: pre-modern (the hundreds of millions of peasants toiling in highly primitive conditions), the modern (the Tata and Mittal groups, for example), and the post-modern (Bangalore, Wipro, Infosys, Bollywood). Japan has some post-modern features. Discipline, especially in schools, is clearly not quite what it used to be. The trend of young Japanese of both sexes dying their hair orange or green and making their way to the trendy districts of Harajuku or Shibuya in Tokyo can perhaps be seen as a superficial expression of post-modern identity. On a deeper level, thinkers like KARATANI Kojin, with his ironist’s stance that “Japan is interesting because Japan is not interesting,”10 and his endorsement of exiting and transcending the “unholy trinity of capital, nation and state”—are compelling post-modern thinkers.11 The works of the novelist MURAKAMI Haruki are also fine examples of post-modernism. Japan also has quite a lot of post-modern cultural expressions in its cinema—as in the wonderful film Shall We Dansu?—as well as in its graphic arts (e.g., anime) and literature. But as we explore in this book, Japan is a post-modern state neither in terms of political power, nor economic structure, nor overall national ethos. Power remains highly centralized in Tokyo and still tightly controlled by the “iron triangle,” as it is known, of national bureaucracy, big business and establishment politicians. The media is above all deferential, and civil society is primarily conspicuous by its absence. The modern nature of Japanese political society is also strongly supported by its industrial structure. The service\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nand information industries have tended to be either mediocre or fiascos. There are, of course, exceptions: Nintendo is one. But while, during the bubble economy years in the second half of the 1980s, Japanese banks, electronics firms and industrial conglomerates seemed poised to dominate the planet, the Japanese business giants had feet of clay in terms of sophistication and innovation. No Japanese company in the information industry has hit international big time, as has, for example, SAP of Germany. And Japanese educational institutions, despite having good basic standards relative to other countries, have been surprisingly weak in international terms, whether in rankings, their contributions to global scholarship, or their capacity to generate lots of graduates who possess a healthy sense of critical distance from the prevailing myths of the country. There are many causes for these disappointments, but the low level of overall immigration in Japan—and the limited capacity of even very talented immigrants to access first-rate opportunities in Japanese institutions—is certainly an important factor. In Australia, North America and Europe, immigrants have contributed greatly to the service and information industries and are highly present in them. The high proportion of foreign professors at the London Business School, in comparison with the Keio Business School, is no doubt one of the primary reasons why the former leaves the latter in the dust. In terms of national ethos, the fact that in Japan the nationalistmodernist predominates over the internationalist-post-modernist can be illustrated by many ways. But perhaps comparing Wowereit, the mayor of Berlin, what he represents and what he says, with ISHIHARA Shintaro, the governor of Tokyo, is one of the more telling examples. Although figures like ISHIHARA exist in the West—France’s Jean-Marie Le Pen, for example—and although they are a political threat and a political influence, they do not command political power. On closer examination of the modern, as opposed to post-modern, character of Japanese political society, however, it is clear that most of the forces behind it are contingent and, in principle, subject to change. Some features of Japanese identity cannot be changed: Japan will remain an archipelago with ocean on all sides. But geography need not be determinative of attitudes; Australia and the United Kingdom have both evolved much further in postmodern directions, despite sharing with Japan a sense of geographic isolation. And most of the other attributes of Japan’s modernist standpoint are now very much open to question, or else to evolution. Just as features of Japan’s nationhood were constructed in the first place, so they can be superseded now. Japan could, in our opinion,\n\n10\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nbecome a post-modern society, especially as a response to the momentous pace of change in Asia.\n\n“Global-is-Asian” The US security alliance determined Japanese foreign policy until the end of the Cold War. But in the last twenty years or so, Japan’s world has changed very rapidly. When Japan looks beyond its borders, there is no longer an iron curtain by which to organize and make sense of the world, with countries neatly falling on one side or the other. In the last two decades, following the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have gone from a divided world to an integrated world. Managing in an integrated world is far more complex. The world economy has undergone its most profound transformation in at least 200 years. Japan succeeded brilliantly in joining the “core” or “hub” of dominant powers in the late nineteenth century and again after its defeat in World War Two. Japan, in spite of having been an enemy of the US, has done very well through the American age. But we are now in, as the title of Fareed Zakaria’s recent book states, The PostAmerican World. The world economy no longer consists of a hub, the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, with so many spokes: Latin America, Central America, South Asia, East Asia, Middle East and so on. The global economy today is composed of new and rapidly developing axes of crossborder trade and investment flows. In 2006 China invested more in Sub-Saharan Africa than all OECD countries combined, and there are now daily direct flights between Dubai and Shanghai. Japan is clearly having difficulty adjusting to this change, notable both by its speed and by its scope. Yet Japan’s own neighborhood is at the heart of the action. As former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said in 2006, “Globalization is … more likely to become an East Asian and developing country phenomenon than it is likely to remain a Western one … these two great states, China and India, are going to change the way the world functions.”12 Japan’s leaders must now decide how they hope to fit into this evolving Asia and changing world. So far, it has undertaken a major change in only one area: its security policy. Quietly, and largely unnoticed by the world, Japan has been incrementally modifying or undoing its postwar security policy as encapsulated in the “Eight No’s” of the Yoshida Doctrine: “no dispatch [of Japan’s Self Defense\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nForces] abroad, no collective defense arrangements, no power projection ability, no more than 1 percent of GDP for defense, no nuclear arms, no sharing of military technology, no exporting of arms, no military use of space.”13 As University of Washington historian Kenneth Pyle puts it, “Only the nuclear weapons restriction remains untouched (although now openly discussed)”:14 for all intents and purposes, the Yoshida Doctrine is a “dead letter.”15 To be clear, the resistance in Japan today to any major, overt attempt at resurrecting military nationalism would be enormous. But the point is that Japan has effectively repudiated the Yoshida Doctrine while remaining nationalistic in its fundamental political and economic principles in all other respects, and without having formulated a coherent new foreign policy for the new world that surrounds it. This combination is of no small significance, both in terms of what Japan may decide to do, and in terms of how its actions may be perceived by others. Japan therefore faces momentous questions not only with respect to its foreign policy, but also on the domestic front. Should the country admit lots of new immigrants—and to the extent that they will actually be able to counteract Japan’s declining, aging population? Should the country stay the course within its traditional mercantilist model, or change its trade policy? So far, while Japan has, in subterranean fashion, undergone a radical shift in its security posture, it has done little to move away from its postwar model of nationhood in other respects—not in its citizenship, identity, economics or politics. In making this claim, we must emphasize that we are looking at Japan with broad brushstrokes. We acknowledge, as one example, that some economic reforms have been undertaken since the bubble burst, for instance in the partial unwinding of the cross-shareholding system. But we also contend that the basic outlines of the mercantilist economy remain very much in place. More generally, a core premise of this book is that Japan, comparatively speaking, remains closed and nationalistic in many ways. Of course, in claiming that Japan is closed, the comparison is not being made with the rogue or religiously sealed states of this planet—North Korea and Burma in the first category, Saudi Arabia in the second—but with states in comparable positions of economic and social development. Among the countries in the OECD, only South Korea, (Japan’s student), can vie with Japan for being “MCC”—most closed country. Japan is closed by any objective criterion one cares to use: level of imports, inward foreign investment, immigration, foreign managers and professionals, foreign brand recognition, penetration of international\n\n12\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nmedia, foreign language capability, international standards, contribution to development, extent of political contest inside Japan, etc. The issue for Japan now—as the world evolves around it and as it quietly overturns its postwar foreign policy model—is whether its insular and detached approach to global affairs is also in need of an overhaul, and if so, in what direction.\n\nChoices, Choices As the historian Pyle puts it, just as East Asia is “in a kind of interregnum, a period of flux,” and is lacking a regional order to manage its own dynamic evolution, so “it is ‘premature’ to say what Japan’s ‘new grand strategy’ will be.”16 But recent commentators on Japan, including Pyle, have identified various options for Japan in this time of transition. In one scenario, it could adopt a “Switzerland-inAsia” scenario, a kind of passive, resigned response to the dizzying pace of change externally by doing little to change things internally. As Michael Zielenziger, former Tokyo-based bureau chief for Knight Ridder and author of Shutting Out the Sun (2006), captures this possibility rather glumly: “Japan could well bury any lingering dreams of global, or even regional superiority and choose instead to turn itself into an Asian model of Switzerland, a peaceful, relatively prosperous, insulated, and increasingly irrelevant nation, a quiet and stable second-rank power.”17 As Zielenziger goes on to say, “Could the Japanese vote on it, I have little doubt that a majority would choose such gradual decline over any radical, destabilizing change.”18 While many Japanese may dream of becoming the Swiss of Asia, it can only be a dream. Switzerland is a small country (7.5 million population, hence over a million less than the city of Osaka) surrounded by what is today the most peaceful region of the world, the EU. Japan is one of the world’s largest countries, in a quite turbulent region and rendered all the more turbulent by the many territorial disputes that Japan has with all of its neighbors, Russia, Korea and China. Second, Japan could look to deepen the US security alliance; it could look to “hug the US closer” to itself.19 The contingent in Japan that is comfortable with the metaphor that Japan is the fifty-first state would see this as the best option.20 Third, Japan could pursue what Richard Samuels, an eminent MIT political scientist, describes as a “dual hedge” between the US and China,21 or a “Goldlilocks consensus”: neither too hot nor too cold\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ntoward either country.22 While the experts disagree on many points, there does appear to be broad agreement among them, however, with Richard Samuels’ comment that “all bets are off” in terms of what Japan might do “if China’s rise is aggressive.”23 There is a fourth option beyond these postures, however, one that we champion in this book: Japan should respond to this new world by abandoning mercantilism and nationalism, and by becoming a global and regional champion of multilateralism. In our view this posture is more decisive than playing Goldilocks, more engaged than playing Switzerland, and more street-smart and forwardlooking than simply counting on the United States. It is also the only strategy that will explicitly encourage Japan to attempt to think and move beyond the confines of modern nationalism, with all the limitations that posture entails. Ultimately, it is the most pragmatic route for Japan to address the phenomenal transformation in its landscape: the rise of China. But to champion multilateralism meaningfully, Japan must become Asian, much as Germany and, to a lesser extent, Britain, became European in the last few decades. This would involve no small shift in consciousness; the “modern” Japan dating back to the Meiji Restoration was, as we have seen, a deliberate and self-consciously “westernized” Japan. The Meiji Emperor paraded in Prussian uniform. The philosophy was encapsulated in the title of the publication by the eminent Meiji-era political philosopher FUKUZAWA Yukichi (1835–1901), Datsu-A, translated as “escaping Asia.” Though there was a spirit of pan-Asianism among a number of Japanese intellectuals and ideologues in the interwar period, this was very much a minority trend. Japan in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries emerged as a “Western” imperial power, first along neo-constitutional lines and subsequently in fascist garb. In both guises it sought to achieve parity with the great Western powers by having its own empire; by invading, subjugating and colonizing its neighbors. After World War Two, Japan was able to maintain an economic leadership position in Asia thanks to its overwhelming economic superiority and with American connivance.24 The recent global market revolution, dominated by the dramatic re-emergence of China, has completely altered the Asian landscape. The East Asia story of the 1990s was the battle between Japan and China for dominance in Southeast Asia. That story has now been concluded. China won. In becoming Asian, Japan would need to integrate much more into Asian societies and even more importantly, allow Asian societies to integrate into Japan. And Tokyo would need to recognise\n\n14\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nthat the new Asia of the twenty-first century will in all likelihood be a China-dominated Asia. This would be returning to the status quo that prevailed for centuries before the Meiji Restoration. Whether China’s rise can be “peaceful,” as its liberal political leaders and thinkers desire, will be in good part determined by which option Japan chooses. The Asian option does not necessarily require Japan to turn against the US: in fact, it would be in America’s interest to have its “old chum” Japan at the heart of a China-driven twentyfirst-century Asia. It is also the option that will pave the way for Japan to be a force in reinforcing multilateralism. An embrace of Asian-based multilateralism is the means for Japan’s leadership to promote its enlightened national self-interest, even though it will inevitably at times be contrary to narrow, sectoral, vested interests. Relatedly, the cultivation of trust or mistrust among countries in Asia has the potential to become a selffulfilling prophecy. If Japan is only worried about rivalries in Asia, it may only find rivalries. If it begins to think more in terms of building a community, it may find it has a better prospect of doing so. To reiterate, when countries in the EU give up some of their sovereignty, they do so for pragmatic reasons; they are pragmatic idealists. Germany repented for what it did to its neighbors during World War Two, no doubt in part because of a genuine sense of repentance, but also because it was the only way the German population could live in peace with its neighbors and become prosperous. Japan has become prosperous in spite of bad relations with its neighbors, but mainly because of the protection it gained from the US. In the postAmerican world, Japan will find itself in a different arena. A region fraught with tense rivalries and anti-Japanese feelings could very well jeopardize the great comfort and prosperity the Japanese have accumulated in the last several decades. While the transition may be difficult—as transitions almost invariably are—ultimately the Japanese people will benefit greatly in many ways and they will be much more secure. Japan has both objective (e.g., demographic) and subjective (changing values, especially among the young) makings of a post-modern society. The Japanese people—in the sense of 127 million individual Japanese, as opposed to the “one nation” Japan—would be on the whole much happier, more self-fulfilled, in a post-modern society. They would also be far better globally integrated. Just as Japan in all its diversity will be enhanced, rather than diminished, from an increased flow of ideas, people and capital to and from the rest of the world, if Japan\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nwere to embark on such an agenda, it would have considerable benefits for the planet and for Japan’s own neighborhood. Admittedly there is no meaningful momentum in an outwardlooking, multilateral direction in Japan at present,25 just as there is little meaningful indication of the empowerment of civil society inside Japan so as to restrict the scope of the establishment. The country is not now engaged in significant efforts to construct a global trading order, nor is it seeking to build a more stable and integrated Asian community. Japan does not yet see itself, in our central metaphor, as a global citizen. The purpose of our book is to encourage this direction. Much in this history has yet to be written; there is great opportunity, but there is also danger. Should, for instance, Japan decide to take the last step away from the Yoshida Doctrine and go nuclear, Asia could quickly find itself in a nuclear-power rivalry “Cold War” of its own, and the world would have reason to fear the temperature could rise. In other words, precisely because there is much uncertainty about what will happen, we advocate one direction that is far more compelling than its alternatives: we suggest a course of action that we believe Japan should pursue. We believe that there is insufficient discussion in general about how Japan is evolving; and within the limited discussion that does occur, the multilateral, internationalist approach has little traction among the serious options under contention. If our book succeeds in its purpose, then multilateralism and the idea of a post-modern Japan will be entertained more seriously by Japanese as Japan’s most compelling path for the future. In our argument we identify some of Japan’s challenges and opportunities. We are candid in identifying reasons for its global autism, and we make suggestions that we believe are in Japan’s enlightened self-interest. Along the way, we touch on a range of large themes in an interdisciplinary manner, and attempt to demonstrate connections and linkages across those themes: history, communication, macroeconomics, microeconomics, politics and geopolitics. We emphasize how Japan can become more open across all these dimensions, whether in the flow of ideas, people or capital. In his masterful book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations (1998), David Landes stresses the point that one of the key forces for wealth (in every sense of the term, not just material) is intellectual curiosity vis-à-vis the outside world and tolerance for ideas. Countries that are inward-looking become like feet that are kept in tight shoes for too long. The Inquisition and public burning of books propelled Spain from having been one of the truly great powers in every sense of the\n\n16\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nterm, to some four hundred years of prolonged “dark ages.” Countries should open up, for the sake of their wealth and for the sake of their citizens, and the freedom to learn is one of the key freedoms that should not be restricted by authorities. During the first phase of Japan’s globalization, in the Meiji era, Japanese culture enjoyed a fantastic renaissance with authors such as NATSUME Soseki and painters like KURODA Seiki; the same was true of the second phase of Japan’s globalization when it opened up again after 1945, especially in cinema and literature. Cultures are the product of symbiotic endogenous and exogenous forces, and a third phase of globalization for Japan would be similarly enriching. Japanese leaders need to come to terms with a changed world. In the global era, to solve issues of poverty, environmental degradation, security, disease, economic growth and political instability, the world needs to function on the basis of collaboration, not confrontation, and in promoting principles, not just raw power. A country the size of Japan and with its history cannot opt out of the discussion. The “Myanmar option” is not on! In an increasingly interdependent world, everyone has a stake in the decisions of others. It is often said that Japan is a crowded country. But this is only part of a larger story. As Jeffrey Sachs, the Director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute says, “The defining challenge of the 21st century will be to face the reality that humanity shares a common fate on a crowded planet.”26\n\nI Facing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\nC\n\nontemporary Japan is a fascinating mix of cultural influences. Japanese language, art, architecture, religion and government are all inconceivable without the influence of Chinese and Korean culture. Japan is the land of the rising sun only because it was so described from the perspective of China to its West; in this sense, an intercultural identity is infused into the very heart of Japanese consciousness. Immigrants from what is now Korea taught Japan’s indigenous ancestors how to farm rice. Modern Japanese economic, legal and corporate models have Prussian, American, French and British influences. The Portuguese gave the Japanese bread, or pan. The wildly popular “Japanese” game, sudoku, was first developed by an architect from Indianapolis, Howard Garns, and first popularized by a New Zealander, Wayne Gould.1 Even the Japanese tea ceremony, so emblematic of Japanese culture, is animated by Zen Buddhism, which originated in India. As these and countless other examples show, there is no monolithic culture in Japan; it is a richly multicultural society. But we will go a step further, and argue that even the idea of the uniqueness of the Japanese race is pure myth, because the Japanese “race” is largely the result of waves of immigration from Asia. There is much that is potentially liberating for Japan and its neighbors in acknowledging these multicultural and immigration-based features of Japan. But we are getting ahead of ourselves, because the nineteenth century construct of Japan as a unified nation-state, a monoculture and\n\n18\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\na homogenous race retains deep roots in the Japanese imagination, and serve as anchoring principles for Japanese nationalists to this day.\n\nFrom Sun Goddess to Emperor In a 1985 speech, Japanese Prime Minister NAKASONE Yasuhiro spoke of a “natural community” in Japan. The “Yamato race,” he claimed, went back “for at least two thousand years, hand in hand with no other different ethnic groups present.”2 The Prime Minister was invoking the relatively young tradition of state Shinto, a politico-religious mythology invented in nineteenth century Japan and abolished in 1946. According to this mythology, the Japanese emperor was held to be the embodiment of a continuous line going back to the sun goddess Amaterasu—and indeed, the whole island of Japan and its population were born of the ancient gods Izanami and Izanagi, parents of Amaterasu. Prime Minister NAKASONE went on to pronounce that the homogeneity of Japan gave it an advantage in becoming an “intelligent society,” and contrasted it with the mixed heritage of the United States, especially with its “many Blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.”3 Japan, NAKASONE boasted, “has one ethnicity, one state, and one language.”4, 5 NAKASONE’s comments were exceptional only in their candor; they captured the prevailing view of a country that had recovered so well from its wartime devastation. Or as Roger Goodman, an Oxford anthropologist, and several of his colleagues comment in a recent paper, “That NAKASONE’s speech passed without comment in Japan”—it took a foreign journalist to find it newsworthy—”shows the extent to which, by the mid-1980s, it was taken for granted that the country’s economic growth was linked to its supposed cultural homogeneity and purity.”5 Japan’s national pride had swelled as its economic miracle took off: from 1946 to 1978, somewhere in the order of 700 works were published on “the theme of Japanese identity.”6 And those were only the titles that explicitly treated the idea of Japaneseness, or nihonjinron. In the 1980s, as national pride continued to inflate along with its bubble economy, Japan’s roots were romantically traced back to the Jomon hunting and gathering culture that lasted for more than 10,000 years (from roughly 13,000 – 300 BC) up to the introduction of ancient Chinese and Korean culture. The politician OZAWA Ichiro said that Jomon Japan was Japan’s “true essence” and its solution to contemporary problems.7\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n19\n\nThe correspondence between economic success and national pride is hardly surprising; it happens like clockwork in every culture.8 But for a time, it encouraged many people to think there was something special about the Japanese race. Or as Ivan Hall wrote of the climate in 1992, the idea of a pure race was “openly sanctioned by the intellectual establishment, public consensus, and government policy”;9 the view was so commonplace that many Japanese came to accept a discourse by which it was thought to be “natural” for Japanese to think in a certain way. As a prominent Japanese historian, BITO Masahide, bluntly put it, “We are in reality a singular ethnicity.”10 Foreign observers contributed to this view with some of their comments. For example, the eminent Edwin O. Reischauer, a renowned Japanologist, held in 1988 that “the Japanese today are the most thoroughly unified and culturally homogeneous large bloc of people in the world,”11 while the historian Roger Buckley wrote that “no other major industrial society has anything approaching the racial homogeneity of Japan.”12 As Japan’s economic miracle began to cool, however, cooler heads prevailed on this subject as well, and Japanese and international scholars began to scrutinize the idea of “Japaneseness” more closely.\n\nMixed Origins – Just Like Everyone Else While 700 domestic titles may have been written to 1978 on Japan’s identity, a 1993 Canberra conference hosted by Australian National University was the first serious international examination of Japanese identity. The conference produced a landmark publication, Multicultural Japan: Paleolithic to Postmodern, which turns the conventional wisdom on its head by arguing that Japan is distinctive not in being homogenous, but rather in being a multicultural nation that has succeeded in masking its diversity through state ideology. The importance of Multicultural Japan—and other similar efforts that continue to emerge—is that one can now demonstrate that the view of NAKASONE and others, of an untrammeled Yamato race, is a myth. It is important for Japan to move comprehensively beyond this empty myth, because it has implications for everything from Japanese educational reform to immigration policy to the potential for a more cohesive Asian community. At its heart, the myth depends on a central claim: that there is a “uniquely pure link\n\n20\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nbetween the modern Japanese and the ancient civilisation of the Jomon period.”13 The claim periodically resurfaces. For example, as HIRANUMA Takeo, Japan’s former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry said at a 2006 rally in Tokyo, the Japanese imperial family has had “an unbroken male line for 125 generations,” and this chain “is the precious, precious treasure of the Japanese race, as well as a world treasure.”14 But KATAYAMA Kazumichi, a physical anthropologist at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, (also known as Kyodai) contrasts this romantic, nationalist view with another view for which he finds quite compelling evidence: the idea of a mixed or immigration model of Japanese. KATAYAMA argues that the immigration model has come to be widely accepted among anthropologists and archeologists. There is now a growing consensus that immigrants from the Korean peninsula “played an important role in the formation of the modern Japanese.”15 By the end of the Kofun period, around AD 700, indigenous Jomon people and immigrants were already mixed together to such an extent that the immigrants outnumbered the Jomon by as much as ten to one.16 Modern Japanese, in other words, are primarily descended from immigrants from the mainland who came from what is now Korea. Going back even further, the Jomon period itself also likely involved considerable diversity; an earlier wave of immigrants was a proto-Mongoloid people from Southeast Asia or South China, mixing with the existing population of hunters and gatherers. Dr. Peter Matthews of the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, who operates a website on Jomon Japan (www.jomonjapan.org), echoes this view. He believes that even in the Jomon period, “Japan was probably already culturally and genetically diverse: this is implied by the long period of human occupation, the wide geographical coverage, and the sophisticated level of technology indicating contact with continental Eurasia.”17 But even if one focuses simply on the substantial waves of immigration in the Yayoi (400 BC to AD 250) and early Kofun period (from roughly AD 250 to 538), there is no escaping a fact with important implications for contemporary identity in Japan and elsewhere in Asia: most Japanese today have ancestors from what is now Korea and China. Even the Japanese Emperor himself acknowledged in 2001 having ancestors from Korea, a statement that was pointedly ignored by many Japanese newspapers, although it made headlines in South Korea. To be sure, scholars still disagree about the sources and scales of various waves of immigrants, but no\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n21\n\none working in the field of biological anthropology outside Japan advances the view of an uninterrupted single race from the Jomon period any more. What is more, extraordinary advances in population genetics over the last twenty years provide independent support for the consensus established at the Canberra conference. In the early 1990s, after 16 years of research, leading population geneticist Luigi Cavalli-Sforza (Stanford University) and his colleagues completed the first genetic atlas of the world—a comprehensive 1,000-page work entitled The History and Geography of Human Genes. The authors demonstrated that there is no correspondence between popular racial categories and genetics. When Cavalli-Sforza and his team looked at Japanese skulls, for instance, they concluded that they were quite similar to Chinese skulls—having more in common with them, in fact, than with Japan’s indigenous Ainu people. Based on this analysis they held, parallel to the Canberra conference, that “in Jomon times Japan was inhabited by [the ancestors of] Ainus, and that a heavy infiltration of migrants from the Asian continent via the Korean peninsula took place in Yayoi times.”18 Cavalli-Sforza’s book led to the creation of the Human Genome Diversity Project, which sought to advance the science of genetics and address the ethical issues arising from the recent discoveries. The project sought to explain how terms like “Irish” or “Chinese” or “Zulu” are cultural labels, not genetic ones, and that “there is no such thing as a genetically ‘pure’ human population.”19 Nor, for that matter, would anyone who actually understood the science ever want to create a “pure” race; it could be done only by engineering incest among immediate family members over twenty or thirty generations, and even then, such a grotesque project would not be able to eliminate all the genetic variation—the offspring would still not be “pure.”20 Moreover, in a rejoinder to racial supremacists everywhere, “the results” would also be “most uninviting.”21 The science of population genetics has since galloped forward. DNA research from the late 1990s showed that 85 percent of genetic variation in human DNA is due to individual variation, with a mere 15 percent that can be traced to “racial” differences.22 Recent genetic research also indicates that Japanese do share a genetic pattern with other Asians—a pattern that helps confirm the immigration model of Japanese history. Scientists use short pieces of DNA called Alu polymorphisms, which randomly occur throughout the genome and have “no known function,” to understand the genetic relationships among various classifications of populations.23\n\n22\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nTheir research has found some Alu polymorphism patterns across Asia – as opposed to the Japanese archipelago having its own unique genetic pattern, which one would expect if Japan were a unique race.24 And even then, these distinguishing patterns across continents pale against our common humanity: a major study published in 2002 “estimates that, if you consider two genes from two individuals in the same geographic region, they are on average only 4% more similar than two genes drawn from individuals belonging to different regions.”25 As Dr. Laurent Excoffier of the Computational and Molecular Population Genetics Lab of the University of Bern puts this finding into perspective, “The concept of race … assumes that members of a race are much more similar to each other than they are [to] members of other races: this is not what is found here.”26 In short, based on scientific evidence as well as simple reflection on how culture and language shape our epistemic categories, we can only call the Japanese a “race” if we are prepared to simplify into one category all the waves of immigrants over hundreds and even thousands of years, and we would need to acknowledge that this “race” largely originated from mainland Asia. In the vast majority of instances where the category is used, therefore, it is either meaningless or highly misleading. Even ISHIHARA Shintaro, the xenophobic governor of Tokyo and nationalist author of The Japan That Can Say No, will admit that “there are no original Japanese, except maybe for Okinawans and Ainu.”27 All other Japanese came from different parts of Asia “before mixing up, and that’s what makes the Japanese today.”28 ISHIHARA’s statement is supported by the evidence (in this rare instance, one is tempted to say!), and it directly contradicts former Prime Minister NAKASONE’s idea of an unbroken Yamato race. The idea of Japanese racial purity is also vulnerable to internal contradictions. If race were truly constitutive of identity, why is it that Nikkei—Japanese emigrants returning as immigrants—meet with discrimination when they return to Japan? If genes matter, in other words, then surely their common genetic inheritance with other Japanese would trump the cultural influences they encountered after leaving Japan, and they would quickly revert to a “natural” Japanese way of thinking. Also of critical importance, as mentioned earlier, the Emperor himself has recently admitted that he is partly Korean, so ultra-nationalists who want to be both proEmperor and anti-Korean have a riddle on their hands. Even so, the Imperial Household Agency prohibits archeologists from accessing\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n23\n\n158 tomb sites; excavations of the sites could yield inconvenient findings about the full extent of that Korean heritage.29\n\n“Non-Japanese Japanese” In Japan’s population of 127 million people today, four to six million are either foreigners or, in the University of California Berkeley sociologist John Lie’s apt phrase, “non-Japanese Japanese”—that is, Japanese citizens who are seen as falling outside the myth of racial purity and who therefore are discriminated against.30 Minorities include the indigenous Ainu (250,000–300,000); burakumin, the equivalent of India’s untouchables (two to three million); native Okinawans in the south (1.6 million); Koreans (600,000 to one million) and Chinese (200,000). But remember, if being Japanese depends on a claim of pure ancestry going back to the Jomon period, then most Japanese are non-Japanese Japanese. The indigenous Ainu are often victims of discrimination because they fall outside what is supposed to be the norm, and yet they have stronger Jomon characteristics precisely because they have mixed less with immigrants from China and Korea. So if anything, they should enjoy an elevated status among racial purists. The Ainu have made significant contributions to Japanese culture; many Shinto rituals, for example, are derived from their animism. And for IFUKUBE Akira (1914–2006), the classical music composer famous for the Godzilla soundtracks, the Ainu served as his “intellectual totem.”31 But most Japanese know little about the Ainu and their ancient presence in Japan. KAIZAWA Koichi, an Ainu from Hokkaido, comments that the Japanese government needs to come to terms with Japanese-Ainu history to begin to cultivate “mutual respect” and preserve what is left of Ainu culture: “It may take three generations, but if we don’t start now, the Ainu will disappear.”32 Burakumin—literally “village people,” but a term with strongly pejorative connotations—traditionally worked as sweepers, tanners, cobblers, entertainers, executioners and animal slaughterers. They were deemed to have become polluted and were labeled as eta (extreme filth) or hinin (non-human) in accordance with norms such as those found in Buddhist strictures against coming into contact with dead animals. Others, including beggars, vagrants and those afflicted with leprosy, were soon marginalized under the same label. But the burakumin have always lived in Japan and are as Japanese as\n\n24\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nanyone from the immigrant mainstream who claims to be pure Japanese. Nevertheless, under the Tokugawa rulers in the early seventeenth century, burakumin were formally declared untouchable. They faced restrictions on their housing, mobility, clothing and hairstyles, and were prohibited from buying land, ordered to walk on the edge of the street and assigned a curfew. In 1871 the government stopped official discrimination against burakumin, but prejudice has persisted. Japanese law has long required registration at one’s birthplace, and burakumin have long been relegated to certain communities, so it has been relatively easy to foist the burakumin label on people by their identification. Or to turn the point around, were it not for their address, there would be no way to distinguish burakumin from other Japanese. Even so, one survey in the late ‘90s found that 11.8 percent of Japanese adults “would discontinue an existing friendship if they subsequently discovered a buraku connection,” although Alastair McLauchlan, a New Zealander who wrote his doctorate on buraku issues, contends that “this is an unrealistically conservative figure.”33 Yet the burakumin make taiko drums (from cow hide), and taiko drumming is a source of national pride inside Japan, especially at Shinto festivals, and a cultural export to the world. They have also made important innovations in other spheres of Japanese life; for instance, burakumin reportedly run some of the best day-care facilities in Japan.34 The 1.6 million Okinawans, meanwhile, live on nearly 50 of the more than 140 islands in Okinawa Prefecture, stretching 1,000 kilometers, some of which are closer to Taiwan than to the main island of Japan (like Yonaguni island, which is only 127 kilometers away from Taiwan but over 1000 kilometers from Japan’s mainland). The Ryukyus, as the chain of islands including Okinawa are called, constituted a semi-independent kingdom, owing fealty both to the Emperor of China and to the daimyo (lord) of the Soutwestern fief of Satsuma, until 1879 when it was annexed by Japan. The Japanese banned and stigmatized the use of the Ryukyuan language and the teaching of indigenous Ryukyuan history—even the word “Okinawa” was imposed to replace “Ryukyu.” Japan eventually used Okinawa as a “sacrificial border” during World War II, imposing great suffering on Okinawan citizens.35 Given this history, some Okinawans are understandably ambivalent about their Japanese identity. As CHIBANA Soichi explains, there are three types of Okinawans: those who see themselves as Japanese; those who deny that they are Japanese and insist that they are Ryukyuan; and those who say they are both, but Okinawan first.36\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n25\n\nLastly, a word should be said about the (recent) million or so Chinese and Korean immigrants inside Japan. Notwithstanding Japan’s rich historical inheritance from both cultures, it is rare to see senior businesspeople from either culture working in senior business positions in Japan. Chinese mostly work at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder in low-end services and industrial sectors. YAMAMOTO Hideko, a Chinese woman born in Japan, tells of her teacher asking, “Why should I help a Chinese person get a job?”37 There have been Japanese of “foreign” (usually Korean) origin who have done well in the world of business, though it is generally by doing their own thing as opposed to holding positions in the establishment kaisha (established Japanese company): e.g., SON Masayoshi, the ethnic-Korean Japanese founder and chairman of Softbank. A Korean head of Mitsui & Co would be difficult to fathom. The myth of purity, in both its ethnic and cultural variants, is an unhelpful illusion preventing some Chinese and Koreans in Japan from contributing to their fullest potential.\n\nJapanese History: Multiculturalism par Excellence So far, so good: many Asians, including Japanese, might be happy to think about, or learn about, the immigration model of Japanese ethnicity. But a Japanese nationalist might still say, “Fine: even if it is true that Japan’s ‘mainstream’ population is largely descended from Asian immigrants, and even allowing that non-Japanese Japanese play a role in the Japan of today, the fact is that Japan was isolated from the outside world for much of its history, and this isolation has engendered a mystical cultural unity, hermetically sealed apart from the world.” But this argument fails on closer examination. Japan has always been heterogeneous in its cultural life, even during its period of official political isolation. The great treasures of Japanese cultural history have always reflected forms of dialogue, borrowing, hybridity; have always involved reactions to and interchange with other cultures. And just as importantly, the idea of Japan as a cohesive nation-state was a relatively recent development in its history. Around AD 600, Prince SHOTOKU created the first Japanese constitution, written in Chinese, based on his extensive study of Chinese culture and under the guidance of a Korean priest. Prince SHOTOKU transformed Japan from an illiterate, isolated archipelago to a part of East Asian civilization by sharing the ideas of the Chinese\n\n26\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nand Koreans of the day. Subsequently, for the thousand or so years from Prince SHOTOKU’s Chinese-influenced constitution to the beginning of sakoku (closed country) policy adopted in 1639, Japan had extensive interaction with both Korea and China, through vigorous trade, waves of immigrants, battles, coastline piracy and even through official court emissaries. In the Nara and Heian periods (AD 710–1185) alone, Japan experienced a “massive infusion” of Chinese, Korean and even Indian culture, in art, architecture, music, religion and politics.38 The Heian period was also notable, however, for the development of the hiragana and katakana kanji syllabic scripts from the earlier man’yogana phonetic characters (which were based on the oldest Japanese script, made up of inherited and modified Chinese characters). The hiragana was used by women, while the katakana was developed by monks to study Buddhist sutras from China.39 From the end of the Heian period (AD 794–1185), Japan fell into recurring civil wars for more than four centuries. The country also had to contend with external threats. In the thirteenth century, typhoons repelled would-be Mongol invaders not once, but twice, prompting Japanese to regard them as divine winds, or kamikaze. Even in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Japan was plagued with civil wars. It was, in today’s parlance, imploding. The great statesman TOYOTOMI Hideyoshi—a political leader claimed by modern nationalists as a spiritual predecessor— attempted to “unite” Japan for the first time in 1590, decades after the Portuguese had already arrived with their guns and Francis Xavier had begun his missionary activities. As he came to power, Christian books were printed in romanized Japanese for the first time, and Japan, such as it was, still consisted of relatively autonomous regions in the aftermath of centuries of civil war. From the sixteenth century and following, the Spanish and Portuguese converted so many Japanese to Christianity (up to 700,000 in a population of 18 million) that the shoguns felt greatly threatened by the Western faith. This fear led to its ban in 1612, a massacre of Japanese converts in 1639 after the Shimabara rebellion, the expulsion of foreign missionaries and a prohibition against foreign books deemed to have a Christian message. But despite the crackdown on Christianity—a move that underscores the extent of its perceived influence—the Japanese continued to learn from the outside world and to draw on other cultures. Not long after their initial exposure to European guns and clocks, for example, the Japanese were producing their own models, often more intricate and of higher quality. Even Hideyoshi himself, despite his militarist ambitions, had no difficulty in learning from\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n27\n\noutsiders. For instance, although he twice (in 1592 and again in 1597) attempted to invade Korea and China—envisioning Japanese nobles taking up residence in Peking and building a base in Ningbo from which to invade India—when he failed to get very far, he ordered his generals to kidnap Korean potters as a consolation prize: “If there are persons skilled in ceramics found whilst encamped in Korea,” he instructed, “bring them back to Japan.”40 Some of Hideyoshi’s generals did just that, and the Korean potters who were brought to Japan later developed techniques that made Kyushu pottery “world-famous.”41 Hideyoshi’s efforts to unify the archipelago were subsequently reinforced by the Tokugawa shogunal dynasty. Even once the period of official isolation began, however, Japan was never fully isolated intellectually. TOKUGAWA Ieyasu established the Edo shogunate in 1603, but it was not until 1635 that Japanese were forbidden to travel overseas. The sakoku, or isolation period, began officially in 1639. In 1853 Admiral Perry arrived in Uraga and demanded that Japan open its ports; the Tokugawa government reluctantly acceded to the demand in 1858, when sakoku officially came to an end, though there remained great resistance among Japanese nobles and patriots. The period of official isolation, in other words, lasted for about two centuries, although Japanese history goes back thousands of years.42 Tellingly, more than 200 books on foreign countries were translated over the period.43 In addition, over this period a “considerable number of refugees from Ming China were received,” some of them even achieving “important positions as Confucian literati to local daimyo (feudal lords),” and a few of them, including the founder of the Obaku Zen sect of Buddhism, even emerged as “important Buddhist leaders.”44 Moreover while Japanese were not permitted to travel outside Japan from 1639, Japan still maintained ties with a number of foreign countries through the country’s four kuchi, or “openings”— ports that allowed foreign trade—Nagasaki, Tsushima, Satsuma, and Matsumae. The shogunate maintained commercial ties with the Netherlands and China, and formal diplomatic relations with Korea. When Dutch emissaries arrived, Japanese would bombard them with questions about the outside world and especially the Western world. Evidently the Dutch answered at some length, because their visits led to the development of formal Western studies in Japan—including both Western science and civilization—in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.45 Representatives of Korea also traveled to Japan during the sakoku period, in twelve missions of about 500 people each, missions that\n\n28\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nincluded not only diplomats but also physicians, painters, soldiers and others. As with the Dutch visitors, Japanese of all classes would gather to ask the Koreans questions. Through their shared language of written Chinese, the Japanese and Koreans discussed Chinese poetry and philosophy and exchanged various documents. In a tacit acknowledgement of the drawbacks of the isolation policy, the shogunate did little to restrict these sessions. Although the Korean missions were ostensibly diplomatic in purpose, the Koreans were left exhausted from answering so many questions on matters related to culture, philosophy, history and many other subjects.46 Visits from foreigners were indispensable in enabling the Japanese to learn about the world outside their islands. The thirst the Japanese displayed on these visits for knowledge of the new, the unknown and the outside world demonstrates that there was nothing innately Japanese, nothing “natural,” about the period of official insularity. It was a form of political control engineered by elites, one that the Japanese—when they had their chance—did their best to overcome.47 It is also important to note that the sankin kotai system of feudal lords who traveled to and from Edo during the period of self-imposed isolation helped connect the regions of Japan to one another for the first time in Japan’s history. By the early nineteenth century, Japan was still politically divided into several hundred fiefs. Though the lords of the fiefs (daimyo) owed fealty to the shogun, the generalissimo or primus inter pares of the daimyo, the population’s sense of identity and loyalty focused on their fiefs. The exception was a school of intellectuals (known as scholars of National Learning) who, in the course of the late eighteenth century, began reviving the mythology associated with the emperor.48 Ultimately this proved very useful. Two external events highlighted that the world was changing in radical ways. The first was China’s capitulation at the hands of the British in the first Opium War (1838–1842). Remember, throughout its history, Japan looked upon China as the great mentor, the great power, the source of civilization. And there, in a flash, the Middle Kingdom crumbles in humiliating defeat before the gunboats of a bunch of “barbarians.” The second was the shocking arrival of what are still referred today as the “black ships” of the American Commodore Perry, “inviting” Japan to open up and engage in commercial and diplomatic ties with the United States. Panic ensued in Japan’s policy circles. The initial reaction was to fight them off. However, fairly quickly, the sobering lesson of what had happened to China prevailed, as did more pragmatic and realistic minds. Japan would have to learn, they concluded, from the barbarians.\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n29\n\nBetween the Western demand to “open” the country in 1853 and the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, in which reactionary samurai revolted against the reform-minded government in an unsuccessful bid to maintain the feudal order, Japan was caught between the centripetal forces of becoming a modern nation and the centrifugal forces of feudal regionalism. In the initial internal power conflict that emerged in the face of the Western menace, there was a fear that a couple of the fiefs, Satsuma and Choshu, would dominate at the expense of the others. One of the bloodiest battles occurred in the northern fief of Aizu, a powerful clan in the Tokugawa period that feared losing its status to the southern Satsuma and Choshu parvenus. The early Meiji period Japanese governments were accused of being dominated by a Sat-Cho (Satsuma-Choshu) oligarchy. Yet Japan had to make sense of the new world order. Learning from the West might have been the right response to Japan’s vulnerability— but learning what, and from whom? Western missionaries said the Japanese should become Christian; no, said influential Western secular intellectuals. In 1872, when the new Japanese state was no more than a toddler, a huge delegation, under the leadership of the statesman IWAKURA Tomomi, was assembled and dispatched to the West, both to secure better diplomatic ties and to learn. What they got was a lot of pious rhetoric about the importance of the rule of law. Then when they got to Berlin and met Bismarck, he impressed upon them the view that what matters most is power, not principles. From 1872 onward, Japanese policy was geared not only primarily, but one could say exclusively, to achieving national power. The slogan under the Meiji Emperor (1868–1912) was fukoku-kyohei—rich country, strong army—rich not in the sense of the material or spiritual enrichment of its citizens, but rich in the very nationalist and mercantilist conception of state wealth. The two—in a foreshadowing of contemporary Japanese nationalism—were seen as inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe Rise of Japanese Nationalism After the arrival of Admiral Perry’s “black ships,” Japan opened to the world by dramatic degrees. But while Perry had assumed the Japanese of his day were ignorant of the outside world and especially America, it turned out that the elites of Japan knew much more about America than the Americans knew of Japan, an imbalance\n\n30\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nwhich still holds true today. Japan had been partially closed to human interaction and trade, but not at all to foreign knowledge. Its leaders were well versed in Western politics, science, history, economics and geography.49 The period of isolation had given the Japanese the concealed advantage of a one-way knowledge flow, while the end of official isolation created the opportunity for a two-way flood of information. Japan signed friendship treaties with the United States, Britain, Russia, France and the Netherlands, and its ports of Hakodate, Shimoda and Nagasaki were opened to foreign trade. As Japan interacted more with the West, it sought recognition through an imitation of Western social and political life. The Meiji elites, not unlike Western-oriented Russians in the time of Peter the Great, soon embraced European aristocratic pretensions, imitating their costumes and appropriating their titles. But the Japanese had bigger ambitions, as Ian Buruma comments: “A Prussian-style constitution was promulgated, a British-style navy built, a Frenchstyle bureaucracy developed and the Emperor”—up until then quietly dedicated to culture in Kyoto—”was boosted as a kind of Wilhelmine military monarch.”50 Japanese elites evidently hoped that if Japan became sufficiently Westernized, Western elites would come to accept Japan as a civilized, modern country. While Japan’s enthusiasm for “things Western” was initially naïve, unbridled and very comprehensive, the Japanese government and establishment soon channeled its “Westernization” more in the form of nation-building and the development of nationalism, as was the case in the countries they sought as models. Japanese empirebuilding throughout Asia, “with its grandiose government buildings, its high-minded schemes to improve the natives and its harsh authoritarianism was a form of mimicry, too.”51 The British, the Dutch and the French all had empires, so if Japan were to be counted among the elite nations, it should have one, too. While the Japanese establishment drew from many different Western sources as a means of development, Germany, after its unification, became the country that had the greatest influence on Japan’s nation-building and formulation of nationalism. By the middle of the Meiji period, around the late 1880s, the Japanese government increasingly drew on parallels between Japan’s situation and Germany’s modernization, and this discovery “led to an increasing dependence on the German example, to legitimize the authoritarian heritage of the Tokugawan state.”52 Both Germany and Japan saw themselves as late entrants into the concert-of-powers system, hence they had to struggle hard to find their place. Leading nationalist leaders such as ITO Hirobumi, INOUE\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n31\n\nKaoru and YAMAGATA Aritomo took inspiration from German rhetoric about the mystical unity of the nation.53 Under General YAMAGATA, who served as Home Affairs Minister and then Prime Minister in the 1880s and 1890s, Japan instituted Western-style conscription, uniforms, barracks and military technology – until that time only samurai had been permitted to carry arms. The emperor was to become a mythological state figure, and Japan’s loose collection of animist folk beliefs were formalized, given a name for the first time, Shinto, and translated into a state religion.54 YAMAGATA now fabricated the idea of emperor worship “as an ancient duty … the essence of Japanese Kultur reaching back to the … first Shinto gods.”55 Thus, the extreme Japanese nationalist today, who pays homage to the emperor as a spiritual figure and denounces the presence of foreigners, is greatly indebted to nineteenth century foreign influences for the development of his political culture in Japan. But YAMAGATA and his ilk did more than dress the part. Japan used its newfound economic, political and military might to bludgeon its neighbors into servile submission.56 In 1876 Japan began the informal acquisition of Korea. In Japan’s first war against China, in 1894, following which it colonized Taiwan, its spectacular military victories were accompanied by jingoistic and racist propaganda. In newspaper illustrations of the period, Japanese soldiers were typically portrayed as strong, tall, muscular, very “Westernized”— and twirling, with the fingers of each hand, pig-tailed, buck-toothed scrawny Chinese. In 1905 Japan shocked most of the world by defeating Russia spectacularly in both land and naval campaigns, In World War I it was one of the key allied powers—with Britain, France, Italy and the US—forming at the treaty of Versailles what was known as the “Big Five.” Meanwhile, Japan went from economic strength to economic strength, initially in textiles, but increasingly also in armaments, heavy industry, trading and shipping. This period witnessed the rise of the great trading companies (sogo shosha, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi Corporation and Marubeni, among others) and, in worldwide shipping, that of NYK—Nippon Yusen Kaisha. An internationalist, universalist strand of Japanese society had developed from the Meiji period, one that had affirmed principles of openness and a desire to abide by and promote the universal principles of the Enlightenment. This strand was especially exemplified in the works of FUKUZAWA Yukichi, the father of the Japanese Enlightenment, and by the proliferation of liberal thought in Japan by a number of leading writers and intellectuals. It seemed\n\n32\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\nto be upheld in a remarkable official document promulgated in 1872, known as the Charter Oath, which promoted deliberative assemblies and recognized freedom for common people. But there was also a strong opposing strand, one that can be labeled as “Japanist”—or what in today’s language would be called “fundamentalist”—which stood in strong opposition to the universal principles of the Enlightenment and promoted nationalist obscurantism. Ultimately, this contingent proved victorious and determined Japanese policy, leading the country into the dark valley into which Japan was plunged in the thirties and forties. As the Japanese scholar and diplomatist ARIMA Tatsuo has written in his masterful study The Failure of Freedom, Japan’s liberal intellectual fiber was too weak to withstand the onslaughts from the nationalist fundamentalists.57 While a small minority of people in the 1930s tried to speak out against the direction Japan was taking, they were overwhelmed and outnumbered, and sometimes assassinated, while vast numbers of ordinary Japanese were conscripted for the cause. While the exact number of World War II victims is much in dispute, the American author Chalmers Johnson argues that there were “as many as 30 million Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese, at least 23 million of them ethnic Chinese,” who died at the hands of the Japanese.58 Profound racism permeated Japanese attitudes and its subsequent wars against China in the first half of the twentieth century. From having viewed China as the source of civilization, Japan now engaged in wanton massacres, mutilations, exploitation, rapes and even experiments in biological warfare against the Chinese. Unit 731, a Japanese bio-warfare unit of 10,000 people, submitted Chinese to extreme cold to see how they would survive, conducted live vivisections, and deliberately infected Chinese with the plague, cholera and hemorrhagic fever, while also waging biological warfare on Ningbo and throughout Zhejiang province.59 It is a certainty that at least thousands of Chinese died through such experiments and warfare; the actual number is likely much higher (consider for instance that the biological attacks in Zhejiang alone killed more than 10,000 Japanese, while the number of Chinese deaths was never recorded).60 The Chinese suffered not only by the blood that was shed, but by the humiliations they endured at the hands of the Japanese. Yet, still the war machine pressed ahead. Going to war against the US was sheer folly, as Japan’s major war strategists knew. Admiral YAMAMOTO Isoroku, a brilliant naval strategist, planned the attack\n\nFacing History: Getting Past the Nation-state\n\n33\n\non Pearl Harbor, fully aware that while Japan might win the battle, it was highly unlikely to win the war. General TOJO Hideki confided to his diary, as the war against the US loomed, that at times it is necessary to go to the cliff and jump into the precipice.\n\nThe Legacy of Occupation: Convenient Amnesia By 1945, Japan was a failed state. Not only did it suffer military defeat, it underwent foreign occupation and the Emperor, the living god, had to renounce his divinity and was stripped of all his temporal power. Japan was destined, in the terms of the occupation, to be deindustrialized, de-militarized and democratized. But as mentioned earlier, with the Cold War, the Chinese revolution and the Korean War, the United States decided to engage Japan in rapid reconstruction as a nation. As the Americans began to see it, the priority during the turbulent geopolitics of the period was to have a strong and stable Japan, not necessarily a liberal Japan. The very militarists who had denounced “the Americans as ‘ogres and beasts’, quickly became partners of the US-led occupation in their shared crusade against communism.”61 Although political power was taken away from Emperor HIROHITO after World War II, he was never brought to trial, and instead evolved, in the words of the 1946 constitution, from head of state to symbol of the state (he remained as such until his death in 1989). Not even the head of Japan’s notorious Unit 731 was put on trial; occupation forces obtained the results of their medical experiments in exchange for letting them off the hook, and the scientists behind Unit 731 “continued their careers as eminent figures in the postwar medical and scientific establishment.”62 In contrast to the German courts, which have convicted about 6,500 war criminals, no Japanese has ever been prosecuted for war crimes by a Japanese court. As KAYA Okinori, who led the War Bereaved Families Association for fifteen years from the early 1960s, later reflected in his memoirs, “as a Japanese, it is extremely regrettable that the people themselves could not judge the responsibility of their leaders.”63 The occupation reconstruction background is an important factor in a fractious historical issue that causes much anger in Asia to this day: school textbooks in Japan have long downplayed discussion of Japan’s imperialist past in Asia and its role in World War II, in contrast to other parts of Asia, where Japan’s aggression is taught in\n\n34\n\nJAPAN’S OPEN FUTURE\n\ngreat detail. In the words of the humanitarian filmmaker KANA Tomoko, “We study the Meiji Restoration and then somehow skip straight to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, without spending much time learning what happened in between.”64 To see her point, consider the chronological table of Japanese history on the website of the National Museum of Japanese History, or Rekihaku, symbolic in what it says and does not say. According to the table, in 1910—and this is the entire context—”Korea becomes a Japanese colony.”65 The table omits any mention of the Nanjing Massacre and, in fact, has no entries between 1932 and 1941, a decade during which Japan’s activities in China and other parts of Asia were marked by extensive brutality and atrocities. The 1941 entry of the National Museum reads quite ambiguously: “Start of Pacific War (to 1945).”66 No mention is made of Pearl Harbor. Incredibly, the table does not even have an entry for 1945—nothing on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By contrast, when Eckart Dietzfelbinger, director of a Nazi museum and documentation center at Nuremberg was asked if he ever thought it was time to “stop picking over the bones of the past,” he replied that an “open society” can never stop doing so: “We have to help people understand that they now live in a system whose values can prevent new tragedies like the Holocaust.”67 Similarly in the Czech Republic, a museum opened in Terezin in"
