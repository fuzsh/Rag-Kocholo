        "text": "This author would characterise the poem Qoph as being wholehearted. It is full of heart, full of voice, feel of feeling. Kind of like a robust lager, full of hops, and maybe some fruity notes in there. Without further ado, let’s get into it.\n\nWith my whole heart I cry; answer me, O Lord!\n\nI will keep your statutes.\n\nI call to you; save me,\n\nthat I may observe your testimonies.\n\n119:145-146\n\nThe first two verses are two couplets which profit us by their comparison. In the first line of each, the Psalmist calls or cries out to the Lord for him to answer/save him. In the second line of each, he announces that he would keep/observe God’s laws.\n\nInterestingly, there’s only really one detail that is meaningfully different between the two couplets, which is the call for God to (a) answer in comparison to (b) save him. Reflect on this, if you would. What can this teach us about the nature of God, the nature of his dealings with his chosen people, or the savingness of his answers?\n\nOne meaning which we believe it is permissible to draw, though it could not be said to exhaust the passage, is that God’s words save us. When we call for God to answer, is it not because we expect that God’s answer would shed some kind of light or bring some desired event to come to pass that we believe would protect us from a great injury? We don’t plead for God to answer us with the expectation in mind that God’s answer will be some banal platitude, like so many phrases pulled out of fortune cookies.\n\nGod created the world by speaking. God’s incarnate Word became a man to complete the mission that Adam failed. The Apostles and Prophets left us an inheritance of God’s words that now are our primary arsenal for spiritual combat, our primary meat for true sustenance, our primary and inescapable handbook for all ethics, and the primary means by which we hear the Gospel, are granted faith, and come to the Lord Jesus for justification.\n\nWhilst we do not go so far as to say that the Psalmist intended all of that by this couplet, we gently suggest that there may be some kernel of truth there. God speaks to us to guide us, as well as to simply reaffirm his love to us. His words save us from hell, but they also save us from dejection and loneliness.\n\nSo, considering that connection, it isn’t utterly senseless to see how ‘Lord, speak to me’, and ‘Lord, save me’ are not too far apart from each other in meaning.\n\nThere is one other point that bears addressing here. It is “with [his] whole heart” that he cries out to the Lord. Do not see here some pharisee in his grandiloquence, louding praying a soulless prayer on the street corner that all may see his vain piety. These are vulnerable and sincere words. This is a man whose heart is not cold and dead, but alive and so throbbing with the desire for a sense of God’s kind presence. Do not let yourself write off Psalm 119 as some mere literature project, as if a man sat down one day to show off how many ways he could mindlessly say good things about a book he paid mere lip-service to.\n\nFinally, this author feels confident to say that he, along with any human reader, knows what it is to cry out with one’s whole heart. To every Christian reader, also what it feels like to cry so wholeheartedly to your God. If even an earthly father of average quality would hear such a cry and rush to give comfort, do you not think that the perfectly good and perfectly kind Father God would not more quickly and more understandingly come to your side? To ‘call’ or ‘cry’ to God is a loud note in this poem. Let it ring out in your mind as we read.\n\nI rise before dawn and cry for help;\n\nI hope in your words.\n\nMy eyes are awake before the watches of the night,\n\nthat I may meditate on your promise.\n\nHear my voice according to your steadfast love;\n\nO Lord, according to your justice give me life.\n\nv147-149\n\nOnce again, here we see the Psalmist ‘cry’ for help. A sense of his passion comes through in him rising before dawn and being awake at night in pursuit of God’s attention and answer. What’s more, the imagery of him awake during the night and early dawn elicit the impression that he is alone and in private in his passionate search for God.\n\nHave you ever felt alone in your faith, or felt like you’re shouting into the darkness to a distant and uncaring God? You wouldn’t be the first. However, don’t stay there. Preach to yourself the truths that you know; that God is near to the brokenhearted, that he loves you and pre-ordained your life and good works, and that he is making you more like his Perfect Son every day.\n\nSo, we’ve seen ‘cry’, and ‘voice’, we’ve seen this passionate search having the Psalmist up in the wee hours of the night. Are you seeing the desperation? The Bible isn’t a book of dispassionate scholars writing academic theories about God. This is a man who feels the way you do. This is a book full of songs that echo our ups and downs. This is a chapter that shows us how to cry out to God, even when we are trying our best to seek him and honour him.\n\nThat leads nicely to the next observation. In verse 149, he says, “hear my voice according to-”. What would you imagine should come after that? If this author hadn’t read the Psalm, he would assume it would go something like “hear my voice because of how tough my suffering is” or “hear my voice because I pray in Jesus’ name”. Ok, this author wouldn’t expect to see the phrase “in Jesus’ name” in the Old Testament, but that’s the idea we’d expect. The text actually says “according to your steadfast love”. Why would God’s ‘steadfast love’ or hesed be the reason that he hears the prayers and cries of his people?\n\nThis is Good News! It’s really good news. God’s faithful love is like an engine in a car with a brick tied to the accelerator, and concrete poured over that brick. He will never, ever back down on his faithful love. It’s only green lights from here. His faithful love / lovingkindness / steadfast love is the engine behind his redeeming plan to save you, adopt you as a royal Son or Daughter, perfect you in Christ, and bring you to glory.\n\nSo, when you cry out to God, it’s like you’re making a short film and bringing it to a scholarship fund that promises unequivocally to fund all short films. Is that too abstract? When you cry out to God, you’re crying out to a God that loves you, and loves to hear the words and needs of his beloved children, and loves to bless you as a good father.\n\nSo please, let this motivate your prayers. You can even apply this in a simple way. You can pray, saying, “Father God, please hear and consider my prayer because of your unbreakable faithful love. I feel like I’m at the end of the road and I don’t know how I’m going to get out of bed tomorrow. I need you. Help me to honour you and to become more like your Son, in whose name I pray. Amen.”\n\nThey draw near who persecute me with evil purpose;\n\nthey are far from your law.\n\nBut you are near, O Lord,\n\nand all your commandments are true.\n\nLong have I known from your testimonies\n\nthat you have founded them forever.\n\nv150-152\n\nThese last three verses are wonderfully poetic with the concepts of ‘near’ and ‘far’. The wicked draw near with evil purposes to persecute the Psalmist. This is a rather common theme in our Psalm, seeing how the wicked lay traps for him to fall into. However in this verse, their ‘coming near’ for evil purposes is juxtaposed with them being ‘far’ from God’s law. It’s like he said “they’re under my feet and all up in my face causing me trouble, but they sure keep their distance from God!”.\n\nWith the wicked near, it would be tempting to think that God is far, or at least further away. However, the really lovely truth here gets us in verse 151: “But you are near, O Lord.” So the wicked are near, and they are far from God, but God is near—and all his commandments are true and reliable. This ‘near/far/near’ makes for a good reminder for us. Imagine the following situations that apply that formula to give us comfort: “The deadline is near. I’m far from done, but God is helping me, and will be with me.” “That dangerous suburb is too close for comfort, and the police are quite far away. But God’s providence is as near to me as my own skin.”\n\nOk, you get the point. This next part is great. Are we done with ‘near/far’? This author doesn’t think so. Verse 52 starts: “Long have I known from your testimonies-”. Think about that. For God’s testimonies to currently be near to his mind, and for that to have been true for a long time, it is inescapable that he has brought God’s word near to him for a long time. You don’t get to a place where you’ve known God’s testimonies for a long time unless you are drawing near to that Bible. Beautifully, wonderfully, truly, God has drawn near to that person’s soul. You cannot draw near to God and his word unless you have that living warm heart inside you that God gave you when he drew near to you. That is the gospel! God drew near to you when you were far from him.It is so good that his testimonies are not changing, they’re founded forever. They’re just like his steadfast love, and his redemptive work. It all will never change. So, if you need some confidence in prayer today, claim his faithful love. If you need to shore up your foundations today, draw near to his word and ingest it. If you need to know that you’re not the only one crying out to the loving God today, then this is for you. Cry to him. Trust him. He will illuminate your steps.\n\nThis next poem, Pe, is simply incredible, and does something this author has not detected from any other stanza so far. This poem seems to borrow its central themes and even some of its form from one of the most famous Old Testament passages: God’s benediction from Moses to Aaron and his sons in Numbers 6:22-27. Here is that text.\n\nThe Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,\n\nThe Lord bless you and keep you;\n\nthe Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;\n\nthe Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.\n\n“So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.”\n\nThe middle three lines (which are verses 24-26) are the core of this benediction, but we have given it some immediate context. As we dive into Pe, we’ll frequently make references back to this, and see just what beautiful and excellent things our ancient brother in the faith has to show us.\n\nYour testimonies are wonderful;\n\ntherefore my soul keeps them.\n\nThe unfolding of your words gives light;\n\nit imparts understanding to the simple.\n\n119:129-130\n\nFirst things first, we will kick this off with a comparison to Numbers 6. Verse 24 of that passage reads “The Lord bless you and keep you”. The adaptation that we believe the Psalmist makes in verse 129 here. The Lord’s testimonies are wonderful, they are a blessing. The Psalmist’s soul keeps them. In both cases there is something of a blessing and a keeping.\n\nNow let us make an aside. If you consider your own soul, reader, whose words and whose ideologies are found there? Is your innermost being a place for Moses, or for Marx? Is your soul bouncing around with the words of Paul, or of Billie Eilish? You will know what you find wonderful when you discover whose words come most easily from your memory.\n\nThe Psalmist goes on to show one of the civilisation-building excellencies of the Law: it gives understanding and knowledge to the simple. Biblically, ‘simple’ isn’t an insult. It is a recognition that a person’s faculty of discernment has not developed much yet, so their moral compass isn’t fully formed, and they could still go either way. The simple need guidance, formation and teaching, but they are distinct from the wicked.\n\nTruly, when you hear your pastor open God’s word to you on the Lord’s Day, a beacon of light is being unveiled before you. It is the deeply digested knowledge of God’s word that will fill your eyes with light and understanding.\n\nFinally, the recognition that the Psalmist’s soul keeps God’s law shows that Old Testament worship was not behavioural (meaning that it concerned the actions of one’s hands), but in fact also concerned the inclinations of their hearts. This is a misconception put forth by some modern Orthodox Jews.\n\nI open my mouth and pant,\n\nbecause I long for your commandments.\n\nTurn to me and be gracious to me,\n\nas is your way with those who love your name.\n\nv131-132\n\nVerse 131 shows us what is the disposition and posture of one who has been powerfully changed by the grace of God: they are like an exhausted runner on a hot day, panting with longing for God’s commandments. Whether or not he knows and keeps God’s law isn’t a minor point for sometime in the future for him. He has seen the blessing of righteousness, and he’s putting in a mighty effort to learn it.\n\nIn the following verse we have the next reference to Numbers 6. Here is where it starts to get a little out of order, so screw on your thinking cap and follow along. Numbers 6:25 says “the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you”. The second phrase there “and be gracious to you” is there almost word for word in Ps 119:132, rendering it in the first person as “and be gracious to me”. The interesting thing is that the phrase before this is “Turn to me”, which has similarities to both phrases from Numbers 6:25 and 6:26, which are “the Lord make his face to shine upon you” and “the Lord lift up his countenance upon you” respectively.\n\nWhichever verse he was alluding to, the first part of 119:132 is clearly drawing upon Numbers 6:25-26. However, please don’t hear this as merely an intellectual or analytical observation. Praise the Lord, because you can apply this to your daily life! How? Well, what we’re seeing is that a worshipper of God has become really familiar with God’s word, and when he’s writing his own songs and poetry he borrows language and ideas from Scripture.\n\nWe can apply this today by letting the language of our prayers, and even the language of the songs we choose to sing to God, be moulded and shaped and imbued with Scripture. To give an example, this author will include a short prayer based on Numbers 6:24-26.\n\n“Father God, please let me see your face today as I work and drive and eat and talk. Please let me feel your love like the warm sunlight, and bring me peace in the troubles I’m facing. I ask you this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”\n\nWe’re not done. There’s still one more reference in this passage! Following the benediction in verses 24-26, Numbers 6:27 says “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them”. This is showing us that God chooses a people, puts his name on them and blesses them. Ps 119:132 also links those two themes (turning to them and being gracious to them) with what we’re now looking at (those who love God’s name). One really remarkable thing to contemplate here is the link between God putting his name on a particular people, and those people loving his name. The beautiful truth is that when God puts his name on you, it isn’t a mere formality. His love changes you. His love elicits love from you. You love his name because he put his name on you.\n\nThe careful reader might object here, saying, ‘But my friend, do you not see that God puts his name upon the people of Israel, yet here you are making application from this passage to the church today? This is a category error!’. Seeking not to draw attention away from our selected passages, this author will simply say that worshippers of Yahweh today are brothers in Christ with worshippers of Yahweh since the beginning. That is a more complicated subject, and one for a different book.\n\nLast thing, we promise! There is a profound truth about God’s nature to cling to here. Verse 132 says “as is your way with those who love your name” (emphasis added). For those who love his name, it is God’s way, his modus operandi, his habit, to turn to them and be gracious to them. Do you feel that God deals only in harsh measures with you? Do you worry that he is watching only your neighbours and family, but letting your catastrophes bank up, one after another? This author, the wretch that he is, freely confesses to feeling that way all too frequently in recent months. If this is you too, you are not alone in this mistake. Neither are you alone when you confess it and throw it down, and when you come pleading to Jesus that he would remind you of the grace you know you have been given.\n\nKeep steady my steps according to your promise,\n\nand let no iniquity get dominion over me.\n\nRedeem me from man’s oppression,\n\nthat I may keep your precepts.\n\nv133-134\n\nIf you are going through something tough right now, these two verses might just be the lifeline you needed. We almost can’t believe that we have such a firm handhold in the Scriptures to hold to, when the breakers and waves of life come crashing down on us. These verses let us plead to God and ask on the basis of His promise, that he would keep our steps steady and let no iniquity get dominion over us. To be totally honest, this author doesn’t know the ins and outs of where the line is between iniquity hitting us from every side vs getting dominion over us, so we probably shouldn’t expect this verse to shield us from all iniquity, but do not let the words of this mere man dilute the promises of God!\n\nSecondly, it is a sad but sobering reality that God’s people have experienced and will experience the oppression of man for ages to come. Since Egypt, God’s people have been slaves, but since the Exodus we have also been free men. God gives his people the liberation from the ultimate slavery and bondage which is Sin, so that we can endure any oppression and slavery we experience in this life, all the while pleading with God to set us free, let us not be put to shame, and bring justice down on our oppressors. Just think about it. Today there will be many men and women living in countries where being Christian is dangerous, and those brothers and sisters would feel the pang of this verse stronger than we would.\n\nIf you can live freely as a Christian, praise God! If you are experiencing man’s oppression, grasp this verse with all you’ve got, and ask that your God would redeem you and help you walk in his way.\n\nBut wait, is there no Numbers reference here? Well, this author didn’t see any at first. However, when comparing which Numbers 6 sections had already been cited and which hadn’t, he noticed that the second half of verse 26 (“and give you peace”) had no corollary yet. As you may now realise, those two verses that we just read are exactly that: the Psalmist’s cry for peace. It is the peace that comes in walking faithfully, it is the peace that comes from conquering schemes of iniquity. It is the peace that comes from shaking off the shackles of oppression, and it is the peace that comes from living a quiet and holy life before God. Considered positively and negatively, v133-134 are cries for peace.\n\nMake your face shine upon your servant,\n\nand teach me your statutes.\n\nMy eyes shed streams of tears,\n\nbecause people do not keep your law.\n\nv135-136\n\nLast but not least, we have one of the most clear citations from Numbers 6. Our passage here says “Make your face shine upon your servant”, whereas Numbers 6:25 says “the Lord make his face to shine upon you”. If this reference is obvious to a 21st century Christian who hasn’t memorised any of the first five books of the Bible, how much more obvious would it be to the Jews of the day who had? This entire Psalm would just be one obvious adaptation.\n\nIt is incredible to see what you get when you mix this single-minded devotion to God and his statutes from Psalm 119 with the grand blessing language of Numbers 6, and we see it encapsulated there for us in verse 135, which says one and then the other.Finally, this poem ends with a verse that complements and yet contrasts to the first verse (v129). Our poem opened with the blessing of God’s testimonies and how his soul keeps them, and it closes with how his eyes shed streams of tears at the reality that so many live their lives without a single care for God’s law. May we Christians today also feel sorrow for the many on this Earth who have never even heard the name of Jesus or met a Christian. It is incredibly sad, but also wildly exciting. God has lost sheep in all those nations just waiting for someone to come and preach life to them. May we bring his light to shine upon them.\n\nThis acrostic poem called Samekh, named after the Hebrew letter each verse starts with, has a few main themes. These are a deep love and holy fear for the law and judgement of God, expressed in a hatred for the evildoer, and secondly a profound appreciation for the majesty and sovereign might of God. Let’s dive right in!\n\nI hate the double-minded,\n\nbut I love your law.\n\n119:113\n\nThe first verse essentially gives us the core paradigm of the poem, as stated above. He hates the double-minded, but he loves God’s law. Does it seem odd to pair those two statements? As Christians, are we not taught that God loves everyone, and that we should share God’s love with everyone?\n\nWell, both of those things are true. He does love everyone, and we see that love expressed to mankind in so many ways. However, there is more to it than that. This author loves his wife, but there is no way he would love any other woman or man the same way he loves his wife. Likewise, he loves his family and friends, but the level of sacrifice he’s willing to make for them is leagues apart from the general love he’d show to a stranger in public. Yes, this author would make an effort to reflect and convey God’s love to all people, but that doesn’t mean he loves them all with the same love.\n\nSimilarly, God hates sin itself, and the sinner as an agent of sin. Therefore, it is true to say that God both loves and hates an unrepentant sinner at the same time. This doesn’t make his love or his hatred ingenuine or insincere. It means that God is consistently God. He always hates sin and sinners, that is his very nature. He has endowed his love on all mankind, so even while hating sin and sinners he also loves them with the blessings of rain, food, family and fun (and much else).\n\nKeep in mind, this is the Psalmist speaking in verse 113, and there is no reason to think that he is sinning by expressing a righteous hatred for the sinner. The same ‘principle’ in him (love for good) motivates him to love God’s law, since it is good, and it motivates him to hate the double-minded since their duplicity is antithetical to good.\n\nYou are my hiding place and my shield;\n\nI hope in your word.\n\nv114\n\nVerse 114 and verse 120 pair together in counterpoint, showing us the balance and full range of the Psalmist’s place before God. Verse 114 shows his warm confidence in God as his hiding place and shield. God is the safe haven and friendly harbour in which he knows he will find comfort and security. What’s more, this is bolstered by the second half of the verse showing the Psalmist’s hope, which is rooted in God’s word to him. So, when we read verse 120, we should remember the confident hope he has in God when he then says “my flesh trembles for fear of you / and I am afraid of your judgements”. Of course his flesh trembles for fear of the Most High God. Our God is a consuming fire, and a terrible destroyer of all things impure and sinful. You can’t stand beside a tsunami or see lightning strike the ground beside you and not fear it for its awful power, even if you’re sure that it won’t destroy you. It is awesome and deadly, and it is right that you fear it. Anyone who grows comfortable and complacent towards the Holy God may be in danger of imbalance and impious laxity.\n\nThe Psalmist is “afraid of [His] judgements”. Is this him saying that he’s afraid that God will punish him for his sin? This author is no Bible scholar, and by no means the most accomplished systematic theologian, but for the following reasons we do not think he was unsure of the safety of his own soul:\n\nAs seen in v114, he identifies God and God’s word as his shield and hope.\n\nIn v116 he claims God’s promise to him of life.\n\nIn v116 and v117 he relies on God to uphold him and keep him safe.\n\nSo far in Psalm 119 we have seen incredible statements about his safety, vindication, hope, promise, life and righteousness, all of which convince this author that he has peace with God and is not ultimately uncertain as to whether or not he has God’s favour.\n\nThe balance of v114 and v120 shows us that the Psalmist is in no way ignorant or blasé towards the terrifying judgements of God, but that nonetheless he knows God is his place of safety.\n\nDepart from me, you evildoers,\n\nthat I may keep the commandments of my God.\n\nv115\n\nWhen we first encountered this verse, it was mildly amusing. It sounds like someone sitting by themself carving a wooden statue, who simply can’t go about their work because there is someone else in the room playing table tennis against a wall. Surely, our friend the carver can keep carving even if someone around him is doing something else, even something mildly annoying? To connect the analogy, surely the Psalmist can keep the commandments of God irrespective of the actions of the evildoers?\n\nWell, apparently not. Before we dig too deep a hole, please don’t hear this as one man clowning on the efforts of another believer as he struggles to follow God’s law in a land of evildoers. We are deeply sympathetic to the fact that it is difficult to enjoy floating in the ocean when the waves pull and churn with a rebellious current out into the dangerous depths.\n\nThere is just such a deep antithesis between holy living, and keeping the company of evildoers. Go peruse Psalm 1 to see the fundamental antithesis between walking in righteous wisdom and walking in evil folly. They are incompatible ways to live, and those practising each don’t find much of a place in the life of the other.\n\nBefore you, O astute reader, leap to inform this author that Jesus himself kept the company of many an evildoer, hold your proverbial horses. We are well aware that Christians and non-Christians make friends with one another. After all, that’s a big part of how those non-Christians are introduced to Christ! Don’t get it twisted. Let’s get back to the point of our text. Keeping the commandments of God is no easy task. It’s hard enough when you’re surrounded by like-minded Christians who want you to succeed, and who encourage you to that end. It is so, so much harder to pursue righteousness or even to want to pursue righteousness if those around you are evildoers. Christian, your primary responsibility is to honour and obey God as you grow more and more like his son. Yes, you should have lots of non-Christian friends who you share life with, but do not let them drag you into their life. Christ is too precious a treasure to be muddied and cast aside.\n\nUphold me according to your promise, that I may live,\n\nand let me not be put to shame in my hope!\n\nHold me up, that I may be safe\n\nand have regard for your statutes continually!\n\nv116-117\n\nBoth of these verses are structured very similarly.\n\n‘Uphold me’\n\nThat I may:\n\nLive/be safe\n\nAnd:\n\nNot be shamed/regard God’s statutes\n\nThere is much to be gained by seeing these side by side. In both cases, he appeals to God to be his protection and hold him up. He knows that God can, and it appears that he trusts that God will, since God has made a promise, and he appeals on the strength of that promise. We’ve seen before in Psalm 119 that the Psalmist asks the Lord for many things on the strength of God’s promises, and this author believes that modern Christians should take a page out of his book, and present our requests to God on the basis of those things that he has promised he will do for us.\n\nHe gives the outcome that he intends to reach, which forms the ‘purpose’ or ‘reason’ for his request (this is not the same as the aforementioned ‘grounds’ of the request). Pretty simply, the purpose of this request is so that he can live and be safe. What could be more basic in prayer? There is nothing shameful or common about asking God for life and safety. We need it, and he knows that we do. He is a loving father, and we have every right to ask.\n\nWhat’s more, in each verse our brother gives a second predicted outcome that he believes he will attain if the Lord upholds him, and these are more ‘God-ward’ in their orientation. The first is that he wants God to uphold him and not let him be “put to shame in [his] hope”. The thing that leaps out towards this author is that our God cares deeply about his name being honoured and revered and exalted across the Earth. It is something of a scandal for God or for God’s people if they are put to shame or are shown to be inadequate. It is for this very reason that in 1 Kings 18:20-40, the Prophet Ezekiel stages a contest between Yahweh and Ba’al, in which Ezekiel sets up an altar to Yahweh, and the prophets of Ba’al set up an altar to their god, for the purpose of proving which God will bring fire from heaven to light their altar and prove himself to be the real God. God loves to show up and show off against the false gods of the nations, and he conversely does not want to see his name or his faithful servants put to shame publicly.\n\nSo, when the Psalmist gives that second reason in verse 116, it seems that he is reminding God that if He does not uphold his servant, it might appear that despite hoping in the true God, no one came to save him. Similarly, in verse 117 he adds that he would be enabled to “have regard for [God’s] statutes continually” if he were upheld in his current situation. That’s like saying, ‘God, I only want to serve you and honour your laws, but I won’t be able to do that if I’m dead or humiliated. Please uphold me so that I can keep obeying you!’\n\nIt is good to ask the Lord to do the things he has promised to do. It is also good to pray that the Lord might save and uphold us with the goal that we can be shining ambassadors for his honour, and beaming messengers of his praises. We have a lot to learn from our wiser brother here.\n\nYou spurn all who go astray from your statutes,\n\nfor their cunning is in vain.\n\nAll the wicked of the earth you discard like dross,\n\ntherefore I love your testimonies.\n\nv118-119\n\nThis might just be the most obvious thing this author has written, but it is very silly to ignore and reject God. He is not a God who is unable to judge or punish or cast off those who reject him and make fun of him. There is no subtlety or cunning that is too devious or arcane for the omniscient God to not know and frustrate. There is no fortress of the wicked wherein they might hide from the strong hand of our God. He is powerful. So, so powerful. Christian, take courage in this. Know that the God you serve is a fearsome general, an unstoppable commander. He goes before you and casts aside your enemies as if they were nothing. God’s enemies present him less of a threat than the water in an eye-dropper presents to the Sun. At the end of the day, God does judge the wicked. He does vindicate the righteous and show that the wicked path was never worth it.\n\nSo, if you feel tempted to find the righteous path plain and boring, lacking the scandalous excitements that the wicked path offers you, know that God will discard those who walk there like flaky weeds and listless cobwebs, cast aside into the unquenchable furnace of his wrath.\n\nAfter this, v119b makes a lot of sense. Of course you would love God’s testimonies if you had just meditated on the reality that all who stray from them face certain peril. Would you not love the torch light if you knew that straying from the path led to certain death? Would you not love the user’s manual if you found out that misusing the appliance would cause permanent harm to your household?\n\nMy flesh trembles for fear of you,\n\nand I am afraid of your judgments.\n\nv120\n\nAs referenced earlier, this is the last verse and it shows us that balance that the Psalmist has when considering the majestic danger of God as well as his reliable trustworthiness.\n\nWe’ve seen in this poem how deep love meets with hot hatred. God is to be taken seriously by his friends and his foes alike. However, for those of us who know God, who have found peace with God through the death of his son, we also are freed to enjoy his law and word as our principal treasure in this life. So come to Jesus, see that in him you have safety from the paths of wickedness, light on the path that you should walk, and pleasure in the life that God has prepared for you.\n\nAs this author reflects on the poem ‘Nun’, he is tempted to name it ‘Lament: Interrupted’. This section was not so obvious or easy to follow as other sections have been, but there is some pretty unique stuff to be seen here. Incidentally, this is one of the better known sections of the poem because of verse 105, (‘your word is a lamp to my feet / and a light to my path’) which is pretty iconic.\n\nIn terms of shape, this poem has a couplet at the start and a couplet at the end, with a middle section of four verses that seem to have an ‘interruption’ in them. Let’s get into it.\n\nYour word is a lamp to my feet\n\nand a light to my path.\n\nI have sworn an oath and confirmed it,\n\nto keep your righteous rules.\n\n119:105-106\n\nThe loudest note in the melody of this poem, in our mind, is that of the Psalmist’s agency and initiative. This is most unusual, since this chapter of Scripture focusses so heavily on God’s faithfulness, God’s promises, God’s actions, petitions that God would lead the Psalmist in faithfulness, etc.\n\nThese two verses, as well as the last two (111-112) both show some of the concrete, realised, manifest outcomes and aspects of this man’s faithful adherence to God’s word. Firstly, God’s word is described as something that is actually genuinely useful in his life, as a lamp and a light that gives him clarity and vision to see the path before him, and where he should walk. It doesn’t say ‘your word is a faint memory of an old map that gives me a rough impression of where to go’, or ‘your word is an outdated suggestion that I can potentially extract some useful concepts from’. No, his word can be held out in front of him to give him clarity as to how to live his life.\n\nChristian, let us start there. Have you used God’s word to bring clarity to a meaningful decision in your life, such as which job to take, which friends to invest time in, which ministries to support, which political affiliations to take, or something else? Has the path before you ever been made clearer because of the light of the law? If it has, praise the Lord, you are making good use of his word. If it hasn’t, then get this straight: If the Bible hasn’t helped you make decisions, it’s not because it has no guidance to offer. It is most likely because (a) you are unaware of the counsel that it gives, (b) your fleshly will chafes against God’s instructions or (c) your theological system precludes certain sections of the Bible from having any application today. Please, take a second to do an inventory of your inner self, and consider which of these (or a secret fourth option) it may be.\n\nVerse 106 is where we start seeing this odd pattern which characterises this poem: certain phrases that we are most used to seeing ascribed to God’s will and action, here ascribed to the Psalmist’s will and action. Whereas we might expect (similar to Psalm 110:4) ‘The Lord has sworn an oath to me and confirmed it / that I might keep his righteous rules’, instead we see the Psalmist swearing an oath to God and confirming it, an oath of faithfulness to his rules.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, this author would tremble at the prospect of swearing an oath to God that we would perfectly keep his rules. We break his law too frequently to say that. However, if this is more like the oath of allegiance to God that we profess in Baptism, then fair enough. These two verses have laid down the groundwork of showing that God’s word is of practical benefit in the life of the Worshipper, and that the man or woman who is serious about God is also serious about faithfully following his rules.\n\nI am severely afflicted;\n\ngive me life, O Lord, according to your word!\n\nAccept my freewill offerings of praise, O Lord,\n\nand teach me your rules.\n\nI hold my life in my hand continually,\n\nbut I do not forget your law.\n\nThe wicked have laid a snare for me,\n\nbut I do not stray from your precepts.\n\nv107-110\n\nBefore you go on reading, read the above verses again, except this time pass over the 2nd and 3rd lines (which start with ‘Accept my…’ and ‘and teach..’).\n\nSo, why did we ask you to do that? Well, it seems that if you skip those two lines (verse 108), that there is thematic harmony with the other three verses. Those other three are all about the afflictions and trials in the believer’s life, whether from the hands of the wicked or not. However, verse 108 is this explosion and outpouring to the Lord, offering a sacrifice of praise to the Lord, and asking to be taught his rules.\n\nAs a Christian who is more familiar with his New Testament than his Old Testament, this author’s mind was drawn straight to Hebrews 13:15-16 (emphasis added):\n\nThrough him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.\n\nWhereas sacrifice in the Old Testament usually constituted slain animals, fruits and seed cakes, the sacrifices being spoken of by the author of Hebrews are actually the giving of praise to God, and the fruit offering named is the ‘fruit’ of lips that acknowledge Jesus.\n\nSo in our passage, when we see a ‘freewill offering’, we should recognise that this is not an offering prescribed in the law, such that offering it is merely obedience. A freewill offering is one given on top of those required offerings, given from the abundance of gratitude and the overflow of praise. If the wise reader would pardon the very tacky paraphrase we are about to offer, it is as if the Psalmist said, ‘Oh I’m going beyond just the praises that God requires and deserves. I’m getting into those bonus round praises, Lord get ready for more praises than you can shake a stick at!’\n\nThe other peculiar thing about verse 108 is that it is essentially the only place in the poem where he asks to be taught God’s rules, which is otherwise a very common and very central theme in these poems. It seems to this author that (a) the context of hardship (v107, 109-110) and the posture of abundant praise (v108a) led him to a place of humble submission before the Lord wherein he was not proclaiming his own fidelity to God’s word, but humbly asking to be once again filled and taught.\n\nBefore we move on to look at 107, 109 and 110, one more point of discussion. We labelled this poem as ‘Lament: Interrupted’ because as far as we can see, this explosion of praise is like an interruption to the lament of 107-110, and serves to show how the heart that is sold out for God is galvanised in sorrow to come before him all the more in heartfelt praise. Only a heart that has been miraculously transformed by the Spirit of God could be in the midst of a storm of sorrows and naturally turn towards praising the Lord. Surely no counterfeit faith, no shallow root, no religious pretence could produce that depth of sincere allegiance to God in such a time.\n\nIn verses 107 and 109, he is ‘severely afflicted’ and ‘holds his life in his hand’. This is no joke. There’s no reason to think that our brother was just a crybaby who got a splinter in his finger and moaned and groaned about it all day. Isn’t it just incredible that even in these dire straits, even at the end of his tether, he is still appealing to God’s promises (‘give me life, O Lord, according to your word!’) and reaffirming his fidelity to God’s law? How many of us can honestly say that if we were at the end of the road, that’s where our scrambling minds and hearts would be going? This author hopes that he would get there at some point, but doubts that it would be the first thought, or even the loudest one.\n\nIt is more of the same in verse 110. Even when the wicked lay a trap for him to walk into, he stays true to his path and isn’t conquered by them. Interestingly, he says ‘I do not stray from your precepts’, and this author interprets this to mean that as long as he stayed on the path of God’s precepts, he would not fall into the snare. Another way of saying that is that the snare is not on God’s path, the snare is only a problem for those who might turn aside from the path God instructs. After all, how often do we hear about a celebrity or popular figure who strays from God’s precepts, and for a while seems to be still succeeding or still thriving, but eventually it comes to light that as they strayed from the path, they also got mixed up in some other stuff that would hurt their reputation? The snares of the wicked are real, and there are spiritual forces who are working through evil men and women to ensnare all who would live free in Christ Jesus.\n\nYour testimonies are my heritage forever,\n\nfor they are the joy of my heart.\n\nI incline my heart to perform your statutes\n\nforever, to the end.\n\nv111-112\n\nHow glorious is verse 111? When this author hears ‘my heritage’, he thinks of a sturdy family home, good land, a good reputation and a legacy of good work. Whatever your associations are with ‘heritage’ or your inheritance, how unusual is it to consider that this man was excited to consider a certain set of words to be his inheritance? Personally, this author would feel short changed if he was told he was going to come into his inheritance, and was simply handed a nice leather-bound LSB. However, the second half of the verse makes it add up: ‘for they are the joy of my heart’. Just as the Scripture somewhere says that your treasure is found wherever your heart is set, so also here it makes sense that God’s testimonies are the glorious heritage of the Psalmist, since they are the very joy of his heart. There is this internal radiance to him that is hard to imagine, hard to put into words, but glorious to consider.\n\nFinally, verse 112 gives us the last example of phrases usually ascribed to God’s will and action that are here used of the Psalmist himself. To quickly list the clearest instances, “I have sworn an oath” (v106), “I do not stray from your precepts” (v110) and “I incline my heart” (v112). It is not common in the Scriptures to see someone speak of controlling their inner man by their will. Usually, the inner desires and passions control the outward actions and pleasures. It would be like saying, ‘I reach into my chest and pump my heart with my own hand’.\n\nTake note of this detail, also: This author would expect ‘I incline my heart to love / to delight in your statutes’, but the text says ‘to perform’. Or to see it the other way, we would expect ‘I turn my hands from wickedness to perform your statutes’. The point is, we would expect the heart to be paired with love and delight, while the hands would be paired with action and laws. Not so, here. The heart has the responsibility and capacity to perform God’s statutes. Do you know what that means?\n\nIt means that if anyone says to you ‘The Old Testament isn’t about inward heart change, it’s all about outward obedience and just following the rules. The Old Testament is more of a behavioural book, it only cares about your outward actions, not your inward posture’ then that person is wrong. God has always cared about holiness that starts in the heart and is expressed with the hands and lips. What’s more, we should acknowledge that our hearts are not this self-governing locus of truth that cannot be taught or disciplined. We must all work to incline our hearts towards loving what God loves, and hating what God hates. Yes, we will say it again. Train yourself to hate what God hates.\n\nThe two couplets (105-106, 111-112) together show us that God’s word is of practical benefit to us in life, that serious allegiance to God involves serious obedience to his word, that God’s word internalised is a greater prize than anything and that we must exert our wills to train our hearts to obey God. These are all real life, manifest aspects of what the law does and is useful for in the Christian life.\n\nThe middle section (107-110) shows us the trials that a believer goes through, and how natural it is for a shout of desperate praise to erupt from a struggling saint and interrupt their darkness with great light. Altogether, this wonderful section of the Book of Psalms reveals itself to be an enigmatic puzzle, ever so full of depth, and ever so full of light.\n\nIf you haven’t got the picture yet, this author is thrilled to present to you some more of Psalm 119. Today we’re looking at Mem. Let’s go!\n\nOh how I love your law!\n\nIt is my meditation all the day.\n\n119:97\n\nThis first verse gives us two of the central themes we will see in this poem. One is the devotional aspect of delight or love found in the Psalmist’s experience of God’s word. The other is the focus given to meditation and understanding.\n\nThis seems like a good spot to mention the difference between Christian meditation, as seen in the Scriptures, and Pagan/Eastern meditation, as seen in religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, and in smaller ways in witchcraft, séances, etc.\n\nChristian meditation fundamentally involves engaging the mind and soul on the nature, person, work and word of our God: “I will meditate on your precepts / and fix my eyes on your ways” (Psalm 119, Beth, italics added). It is a process of reflection wherein we recall what God has done throughout redemptive history, where we recall Christ’s work on our behalf, where we remember the Spirit’s work in bringing us to God and helping us love and enjoy him. We do not seek to empty our minds.\n\nLest a well-meaning reader turn away here, thinking we are foolishly discouraging the modern Christian from focus exercises and mastered breathing, hold on, give this a chance.\n\nEastern pagan religion broadly teaches that ‘nothingness’ is the ultimate reality, whereas the Bible teaches that the knowable God is ultimate reality. Eastern paganism therefore uses a kind of meditation that seeks to disconnect from and transcend the ‘distractions’ and ‘mirage’ of the physical world, seeking to get past the illusion of matter and distinction to the ultimate reality of undivided, undifferentiated nothingness which we all supposedly aspire to.\n\nThe idea that ultimate reality is undifferentiated, irrational nothingness, and that all of creation with its distinctions (right and wrong, day and night, male and female, truth and lies, up and down, etc) is like an illusion there only to distract us is a fundamental rejection of the truth, which is that ultimate reality is Yahweh, the triune God, who is knowable and rational and internally consistent, and who is absolutely, metaphysically and ontologically distinct from his creation. The truth is that God creates distinctions (waters above and below, land and sea, day and night, summer and winter, good and evil, truth and falsehood, male and female, etc) and that it was Satan who from the beginning blurred distinctions (‘Has God really said?’ and ‘if you eat from the tree you won’t die, you’ll become like God!’). Satan continues to blur distinctions today when he leads many to believe that men can become women, that a Christian can go to church on Sunday and then go to porn on Monday night, or use their tongue to praise the Lord one moment and then to slander a stranger a moment later.\n\nSo, to get back to the subject, when we reject modern practises like ‘mindfulness’, it is because they are just a sterilised repackaging of Eastern meditation with its fundamentally unbelieving roots. Christian meditation is entirely good and helpful, as we will see further.\n\nYour commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,\n\nfor it is ever with me.\n\nI have more understanding than all my teachers,\n\nfor your testimonies are my meditation.\n\nI understand more than the aged,\n\nfor I keep your precepts.\n\nv98-100\n\nIn these three verses, we see three groups who the Psalmist outperforms thanks to his knowledge of God’s word: (a) his enemies, (b) his teachers and (c) the aged. The noteworthy thing here is that only one of those groups are evil (his enemies), while the other two would be traditionally respectable (his teachers and his elders). There are several important things to be learned here.\n\nOne is that as the Worshipper excels in knowledge of Scripture, they don’t just run the chance of showing up their enemies, which is fine really. There is also the chance of showing up their elders, which can be rather shameful if done poorly. There is certainly a place for reproving a teacher or an older Christian who simply has it wrong, but unless you want to fall into sin yourself while you’re correcting a brother or sister, this must be done gently and graciously (and privately would be good if possible) (cf. Gal 6:1, Matt 18:15-20).\n\nA second thing to say is that there is a huge temptation to pride here. The young man who first learns of some arcane doctrine in his late teens and then pontificates to all at church of this thing he knows all about does not have ‘more understanding than his teachers’, and he’d be a fool to cite that. This author is convinced that the Godly woman who clings to her Bible and comes to understand it like the back of her hand, should she one day realise that some of her teachers lacks finer points of understanding, or is blinded by long-held traditions, would actually feel sincere compassion towards her mistaken teacher, and would seek to quietly approach that person to open the Bible with them and show them the fulness of Biblical truth.\n\nGod’s Spirit produces humility, love, compassion, self-control, wisdom and other fruits, and if the reader wonders if they have become more learned and wise than their teachers and elders, they should pause to consider if the Spirit has produced and matured the fruits in them that would properly furnish them to correct and edify their elders.\n\nLest the reader should suspect that this author is blind of his own danger of elevating himself in such a way, fear not. The Word of God is a sword, and this author’s marrow and bone have definitely been sliced up by it like so much Teppanyaki.\n\nTo take a different tack with these verses, these verses do show that proficiency in God’s word is the path to the excellence that of all is most desirable. In our day, whether we are faced by unbelieving bosses or social media mobs, or cruel Mayors and Premiers and Prime Ministers, it doesn’t matter how many degrees they have, or how many advisors and experts have their ear; if they do not know God’s word like you do, then comparatively they’re fools. What’s more, this is a good reminder to be always reforming. Even though you should expect that your teachers know more than you 99% of the time, and that you should expect that everyone you speak to knows something you don’t, nonetheless you should read and study the Bible for yourself, and ask God’s Spirit to lead you away from misunderstanding, because every generation needs to inspect the faith handed down to it and check that faith for the accumulations of tradition. Sometimes, you will have come to learn the truth, and you will find that your trusted friend or teacher has a blind spot. That doesn’t mean they’re now full of rot and unreliable on all points, but it does happen.\n\nIn each of the three phrases, there is a different ‘for’ clause: (a) for God’s commandment is ever with him, (b) for God’s testimonies are his meditation and (c) for he keeps God’s precepts. Firstly, don’t expect God’s commandments to make you wiser than your enemies if you only read the ‘verse of the day’ once or twice a week. That’s like eating two muesli bars and nothing else all week and then expecting to break a PB on a 10k run. You need not just a regular portion of God’s word every day like you need food everyday, if you want God’s word to be like tools in your belt, ready to draw upon at any moment, you need to be snacking on it constantly throughout the day, day to day, like Han in the Fast and Furious movies with his ever-present snacks.\n\nLikewise, don’t expect to know more than your teachers by watching a seminar one time where a Hebrew scholar gives you a big knowledge dump on some subject. It’s one thing to regurgitate a lecture, it is another thing altogether to have done the legwork yourself in your mind and heart. For example, the passages of Scripture that this author understands most immediately are the ones that he has (a) preached, (b) written Bible studies for and (c) memorised. There are others that we know well, but not like those formerly listed.\n\nFinally, we see the implication that the one who keeps God’s word ever at hand and meditates on it personally is also living it out in their life. You shouldn’t expect to understand more than the aged if your learning hasn’t yet reached the point of regular application in your life (“for I keep your precepts”).\n\nTo wrap up that section, let us give an exhortation. God here shows you a genuine path to wisdom that will prepare you to answer your enemies and to be equal to your elders, and it is the path of knowing and grappling with God’s word yourself. You can do it. You should do it. So do it!\n\nI hold back my feet from every evil way,\n\nin order to keep your word.\n\nI do not turn aside from your rules,\n\nfor you have taught me.\n\nv101-102\n\nThese two verses communicate the same idea positively and negatively: the positive phrasing is ‘I do hold back from evil’ and the negative phrasing is ‘I do not turn aside from good’. We simplified the content of those two lines only to make this clearer. This idea of steering away from sin and resisting the pull to turn from righteousness reminds this author of Biblical repentance: it is not merely a turning away from sin, it is a turning to the Lord Jesus with saving faith. In substance, that is one act of turning, though we speak rightly when we consider it in those two different ways (both of which are present in genuine repentance). Christian, see how our brother is emphasising this practical holiness! Obeying God is not a trifle, a ‘bonus level’ for ‘super-Christians’ or some other kind of optional discipline, this is bread and butter faithfulness.\n\nHe steers clear of sin in order to keep God’s word. Staying away from sin here isn’t due to its sociological detriment, or because sin leads to less productivity at work, or because he won’t enjoy it (though those things are all ultimately true), it is because he wants to keep God’s word. The second verse gives an intriguing ‘for’ clause: ‘for you have taught me’.\n\nThis implies that God’s teaching the Psalmist had an actual concrete and certain outcome, namely that he will not turn away from God’s rules. Any teacher or parent knows all too well that despite having taught their pupils or children that those children still forget their teachings, turn away from them, and often complain and whine at the giving of the instruction. Not so here. When God teaches someone, when someone is ‘taught of God’ (cf. Jer 31 quoted in Heb 8), they have true life and saving faith. If you, dear reader, are living in a Christian world, and call yourself a Christian because it is easier than having to swim against the tide and deal with the questioning of all those around you, but know deep down that your heart doesn’t fundamentally desire obedience to God, doesn’t fundamentally revolt at sin, doesn’t fundamentally find peace and joy in Christ, then know unequivocally that you will never be able to maintain the appearance of being a Christian. Only the Holy Spirit’s help gives true Christians the ability to grow in Godliness, and even then, we fail often. If you make a pretence at religion, you not only need to repent of that hypocrisy, but you desperately need to humble yourself, acknowledge your terrible weight of sin before God, and come to him in faith, because he has given you every reason and every opportunity to come to him. He is not far off, he is not difficult to come to, he will not reject you, but you must come. Come today.\n\nHow sweet are your words to my taste,\n\nsweeter than honey to my mouth!\n\nv103\n\nTo use a colloquial phrase this author is quite fond of, this is ‘full facts’. God’s word in its entirety is a certain treasure, and in every place there is something gracious to be gained. Admittedly, some parts of the Scriptures are more like chocolate while others are like well-cooked vegetables, but every part can be good for you in its right place. What passages do we think are most like honey? Well there’s Ephesians 1, Romans 8, Philippians 4, Psalm 119 (evidently), John 1, Psalm 8, and countless others. Christian, can you identify those particular sections of God that His Spirit has used so preciously in your heart that to you they are particularly sweet like honey? Think of them now, perhaps even mark them out to read tonight.\n\nDo you call yourself a Christian, but cannot think of any place in the Scripture that brings you particular excitement or wonder? It may be that you will come to love Colossians 1:15-23, but simply don’t know your Bible well enough yet. To you, our exhortation is to take up and read! Read the words that God has given you to digest and know! If you don’t read and know your Bible, you are an emaciated Christian at best!\n\nTo the other Christian, who knows their favourite sweet spots, remember to thank God that he has given you access to those words in a language you understand. So many millions of souls never had the opportunity to read those words, so many today still don’t, and so many in the future won’t either.\n\nSo verse 103 has that theme in common with verse 97, where the exclamation of delight heads off the poem.\n\nThrough your precepts I get understanding;\n\ntherefore I hate every false way.\n\nv104\n\nWhereas the previous verse tied off a theme from verse 97, this verse recalls v99-101 (focussing on the great understanding that the student of Scripture gains) and v101-102 (hating false ways, turning away from evil paths). It’s as if the last verse and a half goes ‘So as you’ve seen, I love God’s law, his word gives me great wisdom and understanding, and I hold myself back from every evil way’.\n\nAfter having looked closely at this poem, it really does seem like essay structure in miniature. Not only is it so clear, as a result, it is also so practical. These aren’t just flowery words that sound nice in public prayer or public Scripture reading. This poem gives you a to-do list:\n\nStudy and learn the heck out of God’s word to gain profound understanding\n\nTake holiness seriously and guard your steps from wickedness\n\nLove God’s word! Let it become sweeter than fairy floss to you!\n\nEvery one of these poems is different. Yes, there is a lot of overlap, but there is so much to learn from each one, so many attitudes and behaviours to be imitated and practised, so many prayers we ought to learn. This author hopes that you are blessed by these words, and that you will continue to come along in the Psalm 119 journey.\n\nAs we continue in our journey through the 119th Psalm, we arrive at Lamedh, which as this author reads it has three primary sections.\n\nGod’s work and word are firmly fixed and will not change.\n\nGod upholds his life, he upholds God’s law.\n\nTwo ‘either or’ scenarios.\n\nWith that scaffolding given, let’s get right to it!\n\nForever, O Lord, your word\n\nis firmly fixed in the heavens.\n\nYour faithfulness endures to all generations;\n\nyou have established the earth, and it stands fast.\n\nBy your appointment they stand this day,\n\nfor all things are your servants.\n\n119:89-91\n\nThere are two things in this section that are immediately of note. What does it mean that God’s word is ‘firmly fixed in the heavens’? This is not teaching that the Bible existed eternally in the way that many Muslims claim that the Qur’an has eternally immaterially existed, but what does it mean? Some may claim the use of ‘word’ and identify that as Jesus, since clearly in the New Testament (John 1 “In the beginning was the Word”) and arguably in the Old Testament (Genesis 1, “God said”) he is identified that way.\n\nThis author tentatively goes in a different direction. Firstly, these three verses list a number of things (God’s word, his faithfulness, the earth, all things) to identify just how immovable and sure they are (firmly fixed, endures to all generations, established, stands fast). Due to the similarity of the claims, it seems more likely that this is not primarily a metaphysical statement about the Bible having secretly existed in immaterial form, but more likely a statement designed to bring focus to how immutable and authoritative his word is. The second reason we think this way is it would have the same general force and meaning as Jesus’ statement in Matthew 5:17-18, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.”\n\nThere is a rather large chance that you, O esteemed reader, just said or thought, “yeah no, that was not immediately of note to me, but cool I guess?” With that in mind, here is the second thing!\n\nWhat should we interpret as the ‘they’ in “by your appointment they stand this day”? If you look at the logic of that verse (91), you will see “for all things…” follow directly after. The ‘for’ will give us another clause that explains why the clause we just read is true. So, humour us as we rewrite verse 91 in this way.\n\n“By your appointment they stand this day. The reason they stand is because all things are your servants.”\n\nThis way, we see the connection. All things are God’s servants, and it is because of that that ‘they’ stand. For this reason, we interpret the ‘they’ to directly refer to ‘all things’ or in other words, God’s creation. This is also consistent with the image that was built by the preceding verses, which showed specific aspects of the ‘all things’ (God’s creation) that stand fast, that are immovable and that endure to all generations.\n\nOk, ok, enough grammar. How do those verses benefit us? Isn’t this a devotional style of commentary, after all? Well, this author will start by pointing the finger at himself, and inviting you to see if the shoe fits.\n\nThis author can be tempted to feel like his world is falling apart, but God says that he always holds the world together. We are also tempted to feel like God’s faithfulness is and has been incredibly powerful, but surely he doesn’t plan to extend it much in our day, or our land, right? Surely these secular times are too much of an obstacle? What about that last bit. Do we really act like and believe that all things are God’s servants, that he has in his tool belt, and can use or throw away at his disposal? Even as a Christian who adamantly believes and defends God’s exhaustive sovereignty and universal Lordship, sometimes this author’s instincts and actions betray disbelief in these facts.\n\nSo, if the shoe fits, and the Spirit is working with your spirit to show you that you have failed to trust in these beautiful truths (like your stumbling friend here), please take a moment to preach it to yourself, bring your unbelief to the foot of the cross, and ask for his help to be rid of it.\n\nIf your law had not been my delight,\n\nI would have perished in my affliction.\n\nI will never forget your precepts,\n\nfor by them you have given me life.\n\nI am yours; save me,\n\nfor I have sought your precepts.\n\nv92-94\n\nThe clearest way that this author can understand these verses is in past-present-future categories. They look something like this:\n\nPast: I would have perished in my affliction if your law had not been my delight. / You have given me life. / I have sought your precepts.\n\nPresent: I am yours, save me.\n\nFuture: I will never forget your precepts.\n\nThe Psalmist’s past involved an important decision. Would he, or would he not delight in God’s law? Evidently, he did. However, he knows that if he had not, he would have died in his sin. God gave him life and light in his heart, and it was that light that led him to grasp God with his inner man, and not just believe, but delight. He also reveals that he has sought God’s precepts, which is exactly what you’d expect from someone who has been given new life and has come to cling to God with all he is.\n\nThe line that we attribute to the ‘present’ is so beautiful and simple that we suggest it should be a quick-draw speed-dial prayer for when you are in the heat of the moment and need to seek God’s help: “I am yours; save me.” There is actually remarkable depth to these five words. If “I am yours” is a true statement, that means that God has already saved him. He is already a saved believer. So, what does he need to be saved from?\n\nIt is the wise and self-distrusting believer who knows that though we advance towards utter conformity to the image of Christ, we advance with stumbles, trips and falls. We have been saved from the punishment and power of sin, but its presence is still with us, and we need to be saved every day from the sinful impulses that arise not in our inner man, but from our flesh. We also pray to be saved from a myriad of things, including shame, embarrassment, ruin, bankruptcy, infidelity, apathy, etc.\n\nAs a passing note, we do recognise that those five words are only half of the verse, so it would be proper to remember and consider that the justification given for that request is “for I have sought your precepts”, showing us that obedience and constantly searching after God are expected parts of the Christian life, but that even the one trying wholeheartedly to obey still needs to be delivered often.\n\nOk, now for the ‘future’ statement, “I will never forget your precepts”. On its own, that’s a pretty big claim. Keep in mind that in the Old Testament, ‘remembering’ and ‘forgetting’ God’s law is equivalent to ‘keeping and obeying’ and ‘ignoring and disobeying’ his law. So, the Psalmist claims that he will ‘never ignore or disobey’ God’s laws. Is that possible? Surely not, right? This author is no Hebrew scholar, so it is entirely likely that the subtleties of such texts simply elude him, but this is our approach:\n\nThe full verse gives a ‘for’ clause, explaining that by God’s precepts God has given the Psalmist life. This then forms the basis or grounds for his claim of future obedience. So, if what is in mind primarily is the fundamental heart change of the Psalmist, then the expression of faithfulness is in reference to the fact that his nature has changed, and will remain essentially God-loving for all his days, and since he will never cease to be spiritually alive, neither will he cease to ‘remember’ and delight in and keep God’s precepts. This author firmly believes that we can acknowledge the reality of besetting sins and faults in the born-again believer, whilst still firmly believing that we will never truly or finally or ultimately forget his precepts.\n\nFor further Biblical witness to this paradigm, see 1 John 1:5-10, which makes the following propositions unmistakably clear:\n\nIf we say we’re Christians while we live in sin or ‘walk in darkness’, we’re lying (v6).\n\nTrue Christians have a pattern of living which is ‘walking in the light’ (v7).\n\nIf we claim that we don’t sin, we’re self-deceived liars (v8, 10).\n\nWe still confess our sins today (v9).\n\nGod is faithful and just and will cleanse us from our sin (v9).\n\nSo, now that we’ve torn v92-94 apart like so much pulled pork in a burrito, let’s put it back together and see what there is to take away. Fundamentally, there is a connection between God’s rules and our life in him. It encompasses our past, whence he saved us and taught us to love rightly. It encompasses our present directing our footsteps in faithfulness as we come clinging to the cross. It encompasses our future, showing us his powerful work in us that will guarantee our abiding faithfulness towards our final day.\n\nO Christian, don’t spurn the law, don’t treat it like a passé set of silly and dusty rules that God trolled the Israelites with. See how it is wrapped up in your every moment, and how properly used the law is a torch that lets you put your feet on good paths, how it is a lighthouse in the storm that gives you a firm point to cling to, how it is a warning sign keeping you away from every error, and how it was a faithful steward who guarded God’s people until the fullness of the New Covenant made the law inseparable from our inner man and his desires.\n\nThe wicked lie in wait to destroy me,\n\nbut I consider your testimonies.\n\nI have seen a limit to all perfection,\n\nbut your commandment is exceedingly broad.\n\nv95-96\n\nFinally, there are the two ‘either or’ verses. Verse 95 shows the ‘two ways to live’, as so often happens in this Psalm. There are the wicked, who ‘lie in wait’ to destroy our brother, and then there is he, who considers God’s testimonies. This author pictures a man walking upright along a hedgerow on a sunny afternoon, reading Psalm 23 aloud, while a sinister man crouching very low to the ground in a ditch beside the hedge holds a dagger up and gets ready to pounce on him. The image may be a little comical, but it really is as simple as that. If you treasure and keep God’s law, you walk on a straight path, and your name is good. If you forget and malign God’s law, you are the wicked man, lying in wait to cause trouble.\n\nLast of all there is verse 96. Our brother has considered all the perfections and greatness of creation, all the lofty ideas and great accomplishments, all the mighty works and great things (ok, this is some extrapolation on our part), and even in these things that aren’t wicked, there are limits. There is a point beyond which none of the greatness of creation can proceed. Here we see the fundamental distinction we are being shown. God and his commandment is not like that. God’s way is unlimited in its perfection, it is without constraint or border in its expansive greatness and wonderfulness. Even all the good things and perfect things we know have limits and bounds and proper places, but God breaks through, transcends, blows apart all of that. Oh, how frustrating is the limitation of language! After all, God said it best in his words in Scripture. This author is merely a fellow traveller of yours, adding nothing new in substance, hoping only to give God more hues and shades of the glory that is already his, and hoping to equip fellow travellers with the great light that will set them on a delightful path. So until next time, this was Lamedh.\n\nThis chapter in our Psalm 119 journey, Yodh, is a wonderful little poem with a tonne packed into it, and a unique flavour of highlighting how the people of God imitate the man of God to learn the word of God and admire the works of God. Let’s dive in.\n\nYour hands have made and fashioned me;\n\ngive me understanding that I may learn your commandments.\n\n119:73\n\nIt is a familiar theme in Psalm 119 for the Psalmist to ask God for understanding and faithfulness to his commandments. However, from the start we see an interesting phrase of context that puts it in a new light. The Psalmist confesses that he himself is the very work of God’s hands. This naturally encompasses both the material and immaterial parts, so it would not be a wrangling of the text to say “your hands have made and fashioned both my body and my soul”. In this context then, we see both his utter dependence on God for life (God was in absolute control over making him) and his utter dependence on God for spiritual growth (seen in asking for understanding of his commandments). If you, reader, wanted to pray in line with these sentiments, you might say something like the following:\n\n“Father God, I depend on your wisdom and power for my life and every breath that I take. Please now also give me spiritual understanding, since before I knew you I was spiritually dead and blind in my sin, and I know that all of my growth and discernment are gifts from your hand. I ask this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”\n\nOr, if you (being altogether wiser than this author) sought rather to pray in the words of the infallible God than the words of a fallible man, you might simply pray verse 73 verbatim. Have at it.\n\nThose who fear you shall see me and rejoice,\n\nbecause I have hoped in your word.\n\nv74\n\nThis verse pairs with verse 79 in that both show that unique flavour of how the people of God are rightly attracted to learning from wiser and maturer Christians, and seeing in said Christians the praiseworthy faithfulness of God in keeping and sanctifying his bride. In this case, we find two things about this phrase wonderfully unusual:\n\nFirstly, this author would have expected something like “those who fear you shall speak with me and find company”, similarly to how verse 63 said, “I am a companion of all who fear you / of those who keep your precepts.” So, when we see instead that they shall see me and rejoice, we are reminded that the people who rightly fear the great God simply love to see the evidence in another man or woman’s life that such a person also fears and loves the Lord. After reflection, it does make sense. To make an analogy, “serious piano teachers shall see the virtuosic performer and rejoice!”, meaning that the person who has devoted themselves to a particular way or discipline is instinctively overjoyed when they encounter another who walks the same path.\n\nThe second surprising delight to be found here is in the accompanying line. This author would naturally think of the Christian’s outward demonstration of faithful walking with the Lord to be what comes after the ‘because’, like the following: “Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice / because I wander not from your precepts”. However, the ‘because’, the force in the engine room that has created something ‘rejoice-worthy’ in the Christian, is that he hopes in [God’s] word. See! Just how many times must this author pick himself up off the ground after tripping over something surprising in the Bible? We are beginning to think that sitting down in the dust is the most appropriate posture when coming before the word of God, because it is conducive to humility and not boasting…\n\nAnyway, let’s bring our attention back to verse 74. This verse would be a worthy inscription on a tombstone for one who served the Lord faithfully all their years. I have hoped in your word. Oh, the virtue of being able to say with the certain finality of the past tense that the worshipper has hoped in God’s word! That is a prize unto itself. Surely every minister, every small group leader, every youth leader, every parent raising children in the Lord, every one of them could pray with our brother “Lord, let those who fear rejoice when they see me! Help me to hope and trust ever in your word.”\n\nI know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous,\n\nand that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.\n\nv75\n\nWe see a distinct parallel between verse 75 and 78a, which are examples of afflictions coming to the Christian. However, the difference between the two comes in the moral qualities associated with each. In verse 75, the Psalmist contritely acknowledges that the Lord is the one bringing the affliction, and that it is not an example of God being capricious and wanton, but rather an expression of God’s faithfulness to the Psalmist. In verse 78, however, we will later see that the Psalmist is maligned falsely by the insolent, and that he will call for those evildoers to be put to shame.\n\nThe key here is that he does not merely accept all ‘evils’ that come to him stoically, pretending that he is above caring about physical matters, or that all suffering is merely some illusion or vapour. Rather, he makes a distinction between how he receives the wrongdoing of evil men and how he receives the harsh but faithful afflictions given by God.\n\nOne more comment on verse 75. We are not told what manner of affliction the Psalmist experienced, or on what basis he attributes it to God. We could conceive of this being a surprise affliction ‘out of nowhere’, like how God gave Jonah a sheltering plant one day, and shrivelled it up the next day. However, this author can also very easily see this being more like Job’s affliction, and if you review the book of Job, particularly the discussions between Satan and God and then Job’s reflection in chapter 12, it is very clear that Job understands his affliction to be coming to him from God, and it is very clear that Satan (under God’s leash) is the one doing it. That is not a contradiction. It is Biblical compatibilism, and for more on that, we wrote this.\n\nSo, though we don’t know the exact nature of the affliction, or on what basis the Psalmist recognises it as God’s work, there is a precedent here for attributing to God more than just the fluffy and blessed circumstances, but even the excruciating ones. The reality is, that is good news. After all, if you were going through an absolute hell of a time, would you rather God say, “oh yikes, I didn’t see that coming and didn’t plan on it. There isn’t really a purpose, that’s just bad luck” or “I have chosen before the foundation of the world to save your soul from hell and to bring you through every trial that comes your way in this broken world. Every second of suffering is meaningful, and it is saving up for you an immeasurable weight of glory. I am your rock, I will get you through this”?\n\nLet your steadfast love comfort me\n\naccording to your promise to your servant.\n\nLet your mercy come to me, that I may live;\n\nfor your law is my delight.\n\nLet the insolent be put to shame,\n\nbecause they have wronged me with falsehood;\n\nas for me, I will meditate on your precepts.\n\nv76-78\n\nThese next three verses are all ‘Let’ phrases, so let’s have a look at them all together. The first request hearkens back to very similar requests from previous poems in the Psalm, and what we have drawn attention to is that The Psalmist does not appeal to anything in himself, or anything transient or changeable, but appeals to (a) the nature of God’s love (steadfast, effectual, persevering) and (b) the basis of his love (God’s very own promise, which God cannot break) as the grounds on which he asks for God’s blessing. Let the takeaway be that it is right and proper to ask God for his kindness to us on the basis of things God has promised he will do.\n\nIn verse 77, the phrase “that I may live” follows “let your mercy come to me”, which shows that the thing that brings real life to the Psalmist, or perhaps defends his life, is the mercy of God. This could be straight out of Ephesians 2 for all we care! The consistent witness of the Scriptures is that true life itself is a gift given and sustained by God. It is God’s mercy that saves us, it is God’s mercy that gives us life. This is a beautiful attitude of dependence, and nothing like the self-reliance and self-focus of society today in the West (and other places, but perhaps not all places). The assumption in our society is that you are a strong, capable individual, and if only those big corporations and bureaucrats and politicians could get out of the way, each individual could impose their will on the world, and follow their dreams, and express their true self, and really live.\n\nThat is nonsense, and it is about as far away from Biblical truth as you can get. To make one more closing comment on that, this text is a brick in the wall of Old Testament citations that show that the Old Testament never taught that a person was saved by their works. All salvation in Scripture has been a gift of God given to an undeserving man or woman.\n\nWe have written elsewhere on the Imprecatory Psalms, but let this be a little nod to the start of verse 78 which unmistakably calls for judgement (in the form of shame) to come upon the insolent. In fact, there is a remarkable similarity between this verse and verse 69 from Teth (The insolent smear me with lies / but with my whole heart I keep your precepts). It is worth repeating that the Psalmist does not sin by calling for judgement upon his enemies. In fact, we maintain that there is no contradiction found in asking God for both their salvation and for justice to be dealt unto them. It is appropriate for you to want justice served, and it is appropriate for you to have a heart that desires the salvation of sinners who are as wicked as you once were.\n\nWhat’s more, shame is an interesting tool as well. We live in a licentious culture that sees any moral order or priority as a wrong and hateful thing. In fact, it is right to hope that insolent people would be put to shame, but as a means, not an end. Shame is a means to repentance. We want them to be ashamed, and from there to confess their sin in contrition. We don’t simply want an image-bearer of God sitting in shame with no way out.\n\nLet those who fear you turn to me,\n\nthat they may know your testimonies.\n\nv79\n\nHere we see the text that lines up with verse 74 from earlier. The people who fear God turn towards the Psalmist. Isn’t that wrong, to turn one’s eyes away from God and towards a man, whose example is imperfect at best? Well, yes and no. If you turn your eyes away from God in looking to some mere mortal to be your new source of all hope, that’s idolatry. However, if in your desire to become more like your Saviour you obey 1 Cor 11 and seek to imitate your earthly spiritual leaders as they imitate Christ, you’re walking the straight and narrow, and need not worry about those who accuse you.\n\nThe second clause here starts with the word ‘that’, indicating the expected outcome that would be achieved by the first clause. Therefore, the Psalmist in this context is a person who has marked themselves out as a man of God worthy of imitation is a man whose command of the Testimony is strong enough that he is a worthy teacher.\n\nMay my heart be blameless in your statutes,\n\nthat I may not be put to shame!\n\nv80\n\nDear reader, this author knows all too well the pain and shame he feels and has felt when he breaks the statutes of God, failing to love God and love neighbour. It is a low and lamentable feeling. It is even still a low and discouraging feeling, even though this author has the abiding joy and security of knowing he is in Christ. We feel to our very bones the value and importance of pleading with God, saying ‘please, let my whole heart and mind be totally blameless in all your commandments!’. Shame is a sinking pit, whereas the statutes of God are a broad and straight path on a sunny day. You’d think it’s a no-brainer which one we’d want to choose, and yet the abiding sin of the fleshy nature keeps drawing us back to the sin we hate.On another matter, some (especially modern Orthodox and Secular Jews) have the idea that the Old Testament system of worship is only concerned with the actions, not with the heart and affections. By extension, some might say that the God of the Old Testament doesn’t care about the heart, just the actions. This idea is truly absurd. We see here and in many places that the godly man rightly desires a blameless heart. After all, a person can walk rightly in God’s statutes by force of will alone for a short time, but if he desires a lasting fidelity to God’s word, if he desires to be blameless in God’s statutes, then that requires a heart change, and after such a change a person can be sure that he will not ultimately be put to shame. Now, with the hindsight of the rest of Scripture, and the revelation of Christ, we know that a the heart change that leads to us being blameless before God can only be received one way: by simply trusting that Jesus fully and finally paid for his bride’s sin on the cross, and that the resurrection of Christ proves that he was successful in securing our salvation for us. So, reader, we direct this to you: May God change your heart and soul from the inside out, so that you come to properly love and abide by his statutes, and on the inevitable day when you stand before Christ Jesus, that he will receive you as a beloved Son or Daughter. May it be so.\n\nThe next stanza of the beautiful big poem about God’s law is Teth, and it fundamentally is concerned with the goodness of God and his actions, with the instructing effects of hardship, and with the internal distinction that marks the one who loves God from the one who doesn’t. Let’s go and see.\n\nYou have dealt well with your servant,\n\nO Lord, according to your word.\n\nTeach me good judgment and knowledge,\n\nfor I believe in your commandments.\n\n119: 65-66\n\nWe see from the start that the Psalmist recognises that God has dealt well with him. God’s actions in the Psalmist’s life have been good and praiseworthy (as obvious as this may be). The thing we find rather interesting is that the accompanying phrase is not ‘according to your steadfast love’ or ‘according to your promise’ as in other parts of the Psalm, but ‘according to your word’. That’s like saying, ‘God you have done right by me, just like your book says that you would’. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it was not the ‘according to’ that this author would expect to find.\n\nVerse 66 shows some real maturity in the mind of the Psalmist that we need to heed today. The presence of the word ‘for’ in the middle of the verse means that the second half of the verse is what proves or substantiates or explains the first half of the verse. To render the verse in its logical order, it could be as follows: ‘I believe in your commandments, God. Because I believe, please give me good judgement and real knowledge’. One truth lurking here is that belief in the Biblical God and in his commandments is actually the prerequisite for any true knowledge, as is also seen in Proverbs 1:7, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge /fools despise wisdom and instruction.’ What’s more, the God of the Bible and his self-revelation in Scripture provides the foundation for any meaningful moral judgement. For any law to be applicable to all creation, it must come from outside creation, and not be merely the convention of men, or of tradition, or anything else. So ‘good judgement’ (including all moral sense) and ‘knowledge’ (including all learning, all study, all proficiency) is only possible in a consistent way if a person first fears God and believes his commandments. The reality that all knowledge and moral judgement is incoherent without first acknowledging the Biblical God is fundamental to what some theologians call ‘Presuppositional Apologetics’.\n\nBefore I was afflicted I went astray,\n\nbut now I keep your word.\n\nv67\n\nVerses 67 and 71 cover the same theme, which is how affliction is one of God’s tools for our maturity, sanctification and motivation towards knowledge of his word. Gentle reader, we are sure that you know how unpleasant your afflictions in life have been. Is this not a constant of the human experience? None of us is glad to think that our method of developing resolve unto Godliness would be repeated immersion into the bubbling vat of affliction, and yet in his fatherly wisdom, our God who dearly loves us has seen fit to take us into those afflictions, that he might also bring us through them.\n\nInterestingly, there are a few ways one could interpret this verse. After all, so many of our afflictions are self-imposed. If a man were addicted to brawling and strong drink, then his afflictions are the direct result of his straying from the ways and word of God. In such cases, you can see the very clear logical path here:\n\nFormerly I went astray and lived recklessly\n\nMy reckless living caused many afflictions in my life\n\nThose afflictions have painfully but powerfully reoriented me to obeying God\n\nKeeping God’s word keeps me out of trouble*\n\n*In this case, God’s word keeps me out of the troubles of my own doing. The Godly man can expect to get into Godly trouble when the enemies of the cross bring opposition into his life.\n\nContinuing on with considering verse 67, we think it bears acknowledging that many afflictions come to us explicably, from the hands of those around us, and some afflictions also come our way inexplicably, directly from the hand of God who ordains all things in time and history according to his will, whether we enjoy them in the moment or not.\n\nFinally on that point, any sincere Christian who has prayed to God that he would humble them is painfully but gratefully reminded of how God has brought and will bring afflictions into one’s life to humble them, and create or develop in them the Godly characteristics he is looking for.\n\nYou are good and do good;\n\nteach me your statutes.\n\nv68\n\nThis is one of those Bible verses that would be so simple and fruitful to memorise. God is Good! Amen! God does good too! Amen amen. After all, goodness itself originates as a property of God, so it simply makes sense that God is good, since God is the definition of good. Just as a fresh mountain spring cannot help but produce fresh water, the Good God cannot but do good. It is an immutable fact of his nature that he is good, and by consequence it is an immutable fact of his action that he will do good. For all of that, for all of those extra words, the Psalmist said it better. He is good, he does good. Now, see your heart looking longingly on the good God. Hear your soul which is like soft wax, seeking earnestly to be moulded and imprinted by the image and prescriptions of God. It is the Christian man or woman who has this deep recognition that all goodness is in God’s hand who then cries “teach me your statutes!”. It is not what you expect would come next, but isn’t it so true? Isn’t the crying out for knowledge of the true path what any wanderer might seek if they know the safe haven that waits at the end, and the faithful traveller who will certainly accompany you?\n\nThe insolent smear me with lies,\n\nbut with my whole heart I keep your precepts;\n\ntheir heart is unfeeling like fat,\n\nbut I delight in your law.\n\nv69-70\n\nThis author is moved to confess that sometimes, the fear of what the insolent ones may say about him or do to him is a powerful force that inhibits his full expression of what he believes. You may look down upon this author for saying so, but it is a confession of sin, and one which he ever seeks to repent of. Fair reader, have the insolent smeared you with lies? Have you had your name unfairly dragged through the mud? Before we go any further, it bears remembering that the reason we can afford to have our personal reputation maligned by all the world is that our ‘reputation’ before God is fixed firmly, because God has declared your reputation to be ‘justified’, ‘much loved child of God’ and ‘precious possession’.\n\nDespite that sure foundation, it is not wrong to seek to have a good name in the eyes of men, we are even commanded to pursue that end. However, that pursuit is balanced by the understanding that we should rejoice exceedingly when we are lied about for Christ’s sake, because he got the same treatment, and that kind of ill use shows that we are walking in our Master’s steps, and what could be more reassuring to know, but that we are beginning to bear a resemblance to the son of God?\n\nThese four lines are inexhaustible! Jumping out of them now, we see also how these lines give us a deep insight into the behaviours of a hard, God-hating heart, and of a soft, God-loving heart (for all human persons have one of the two). The insolent sin against God and against man in the one action: lying is bearing false witness, a sin before God. However, they are also destroying another person’s reputation, which is a ‘horizontal’ sin, or a sin directly negatively affecting another person. The immediate contrast (indicated by the word ‘but’) is the Psalmist whose ‘whole heart’ is engaged in keeping and obeying God’s precepts. One man, from the depths of his wickedness, sins against God and man. The other man, from his deep source of faithfulness and goodness in his regenerate heart, keeps and loves God’s precepts. This is the picture that Scripture gives us of the two estates of man. You are either in your sin, inclined towards opposition to God, or you are in Christ, inclined more and more towards faithfulness and love for God and his creation. What’s more, there would be no one in that second camp if God did not intervene on man’s sinful heart and will, remove it, and replace it with the God-loving will that responds with the faith that God gives as a gift. Thus, salvation is all of grace, all a gift, all of God.\n\nLet’s continue on in the verse. ‘Their hearts’, being that of the unrighteous and insolent, is ‘unfeeling like fat’. This is the very biblical sentiment Paul was echoing in Ephesians when he called men dead in their trespasses and sins in which they walk. Their spiritual instruments of recognition are dull and blind, unable to see clearly and respond positively. They are dead men, not able to hear or respond to the summons of a new King in town who commands them to repent and find life. Just as the hearts of the unrighteous are ugly and unfeeling, the heart of the true worshipper is beautiful, and it delights in the law of God.\n\nIt is not by accident that this author brings the language of beauty into this discussion. Just as the attributes of God all find correspondence and harmony in his nature, so do goodness, truth and beauty find correspondence and harmony in creation. So, where there are lies, there is evil and ugliness. Where there is an unfeeling heart, there is an ugly heart, and one in which truth does not dwell.\n\nPlease, for a moment, reflect on the fact from these verses that the worshipper of God is changed at their very core, and it is a heart which has been declared blameless before God and which has been utterly renewed that strives to keep God’s precepts comprehensively, and not merely in the outward expression. The mind and soul, knowing that true thriving can only be found alongside obedience, delights in the straight path that God has revealed in his law, and eagerly follows it. Reader, are you that woman? Friend, are you that man? You may say no. Do you want to be?\n\nWhether you are a Christian or not, if you want to be that woman, that man, then know beyond any doubt that you will find no greater life anywhere else. You will find no moral and ethical precepts anywhere else that will give you truer and better life. If you already know the Lord, but your conscience testifies that you don’t delight in his law, then rejoice! You have found an area in which you need to do some work, and it is work which will produce in you changes that will enliven the soul, and steer you into friendly waters.\n\nIt is good for me that I was afflicted,\n\nthat I might learn your statutes.\n\nThe law of your mouth is better to me\n\nthan thousands of gold and silver pieces.\n\nv71-72\n\nNow we see verse 71, which was paralleled earlier by verse 67. These last two verses close out Teth, and fundamentally they show us what the Psalmist values.\n\nHe recognises that it was ‘good’ for him that he was afflicted, because he knows the high value of learning God’s statutes. To conceptualise it like a ledger, the affliction has a negative score, but the knowledge of God’s statutes has a positive score so much higher that it makes the loss worthwhile for the surpassing benefit of the gain. Similarly in verse 72, the value of thousands of gold and silver pieces is obviously very high, but as long as our brother the Psalmist is the accountant, he has weighed it out, and the law of God’s mouth is better.\n\nTo say that in a different way, knowing God’s law is so valuable that he’ll take great losses to obtain it. Knowing God’s law is so valuable to him that there are no riches you can name which he would prefer.\n\nDear reader, the very reason that this author continues to embark upon this poem-by-poem journey is that he wants to know and feel what the Psalmist knows and feels. We want to see the light of the law in its fullness, and we will not stop praying and reading and reflecting until we get there (and of course if we do get there on this side of heaven, we will keep praying and reading regardless). Beloved reader, if you reach the end of your days and you have not come before the God of this light, the God of this straight path and beautiful law, you will have wasted your life, and so we adjure you this day to make an end to your rebellion, and to find in Christ all you need. He is an unending fountain of life.\n\nIn this new year, 2024, we are greatly pleased to be diving back into one of our utmost favourite pursuits: the poem by poem commentary of Psalm 119, today looking at the poem ‘Heth’. Prepare to see the light and wisdom and beauty of what God wrote, and a few directions and exclamations of wonder from this fellow pilgrim you are reading.\n\nThe Lord is my portion;\n\nI promise to keep your words.\n\nI entreat your favor with all my heart;\n\nbe gracious to me according to your promise.\n\nv57-58\n\nThis poem starts with a wonderful and artistic treatment of the motivation and posture of the Christian. The Lord God is all he needs, the Lord is his portion. The Psalmist’s place and lot in life is to receive and find nourishment in what he has been dealt, in this case, The Lord. He makes a bold promise, one that all worshippers of God know is not ultimately possible until our certain glorification: fully and faithfully keeping God’s word. However, we should not turn around and make our solemn pledge to God that we will and intend to break and spurn his commandments. Our sincere desire and our stated goal is to be holy as the Lord is holy. We are commanded to pursue that in Scripture, and so this author does not reckon it as inappropriate or wrongheaded to drink from the Lord as our portion, and then to promise him our obedience. After all, our obedience will be the final state of perfection that he works in us to produce, remembering at all times that we can have our relationship with God because it was his obedience, namely the active and passive obedience of God the Son, that cleared our record of sin and gave us peace with God.\n\nThe Psalmist entreats God’s favour. He calls and beckons the unattainable King of the Universe to show him favour. Is that not the height of hubris? What right does a mere mortal, especially one who is already a sinner, have to beckon the Lord of Hosts to show us his favour? Our brother answers. He asks that the Lord would be gracious, not according to the aforementioned promise of fidelity to his word (as we all know that even in the best of cases, this is an imperfect fidelity, and one that will eventually trip with sin), neither according to his humility or need for grace and salvation, but according to the promises of God.\n\nOh dear reader, learn from our wiser saint! See with what rock-solid supplication he comes before the most high! He does not trust in his promised faithfulness, and neither should we. He doesn’t bow and scrape on the basis of God’s pity or his desperate need, true though those things be. He entreats the Lord’s favour on the basis of something unmovable, something fixed in the very nature of God: that he is a promise keeping God. God is not bound to grant anything that we ask, he is only bound to be Himself, and cannot do anything that would violate his perfection and faithfulness. So, if God has made a promise, you can be as sure as death and taxes that God will come through on it. If you need to present your case before the Lord and as"
