The main reason is the purpose of the accounting.\n\nFair value reporting of going concerns would be of greater interest if accountants could figure out how to report \"value in use\" to investors apart from \"exit value in liquidation.\" But accountants have never been able to figure out how to reliably measure \"value in use\" that economists in history have preferred but never helped accountants figure out how to reliably measure in practice. The GAAP for going concerns is now an amalgamation of accrued historical cost (not really valuation at all) combined with some exceptions such as lower-of-cost or market for inventories and exit value reporting of financial instruments and derivative financial instruments. However, it all becomes exit (liquidation) value reporting when a firm is deemed to be no longer a going concern.\n\nIn personal accounting non-going concerns are usually the rule rather than the exception. When a person dies his or her estate if valued on the basis of liquidation value and divided up among the heirs. When a couple is being divorced the marriage is no longer a going concern, and the assets and liabilities are accounted for at liquidation value.\n\nIt is interesting to look back at the history of \"personal\" accounting. As you can see the line between personal and business is very fuzzy in history.\n\n\"PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, ACCOUNT BOOKS AND THEIR PROBATIVE VALUE: HISTORICAL NOTES, c.1200 TO c.1800,\" by Basil S. Yamey, Accounting Historians Journal, Volume 39, Number 2 December 2012 pp. 1-26 ---\n\nhttp://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1038708.7435/1.PDF\n\nThis paper discusses a number of topics pertaining to personal accounts in account books in the period roughly between 1200 and 1800. The main emphasis is on two topics, namely the use of account books as evidence in courts of law, and bad and doubtful debts and their accounting treatment. Examples from various countries and periods are provided to illustrate the discussion, which is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\nThe majority of accounts in surviving business account books of the period 1200 to 1800 in Western Europe are personal accounts. They record dealings of the firm with individuals, one-man businesses, partnerships, joint stock companies, religious establishments, and government bodies. In many of the account books there are only personal accounts, and in some there are mainly personal accounts together with a sprinkling of non-personal accounts. This paper considers and illustrates a selection of topics that pertain to personal accounts in the period covered: personal accounts in single entry and double entry bookkeeping systems; the use of account books as evidence in law courts; how a merchant could increase the probative value of his account books; bad and doubtful debtors and debts, and the various accounting treatm ents given to them; and some concluding observations, mainly about ledgers in flames.\n\nContinued in article\n\n\"Stock Prices and Earnings: A History of Research,\" by Patricia M.

We review research on the usefulness of accounting earnings, including research on the link between accounting earnings and firm value and research on the usefulness of accounting earnings relative to other accounting and nonaccounting information. We also review research on the features of accounting earnings that make them useful to investors, including the accrual accounting process, fair value accounting, and the conservatism convention. We finish by summarizing research that identifies situations in which investors appear to misinterpret earnings and other accounting information, leading to security mispricing.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nAAA Members may want to accompany this paper with Bill Beaver's recollections of his own pioneering research on stock prices and earnings --- recollections given at the American Accounting Association Annual Meetings as the 2014 Presidential Scholar.\n\nVideo (free to AAA members who are subscribed to the AAA Commons) ---\n\nhttp://commons.aaahq.org/hives/8d320fc4aa/summary\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that a predictor variable its extended versions (e.g., earnings per share) that cannot be defined by the FASB and IASB can be an effective predictor after it no longer can be defined. By not being definable, there is little assurance that earnings, eps, etc. are consistently measured over time for a single firm and across firms at a point in time.\n\nNet earnings and EBITDA cannot be defined since the FASB and IASB elected to give the balance sheet priority over the income statement in financial reporting ---\n\n\"The Asset-Liability Approach: Primacy does not mean Priority,\" by Robert Bloomfield, FASRI Financial Accounting Standards Research Initiative, October 6, 2009 ---\n\nhttp://www.fasri.net/index.php/2009/10/the-asset-liability-approach-primacy-does-not-mean-priority/\n\n\"Whither the Concept of Income?\" by Shizuki Saito University of Tokyo and Yoshitaka Fukui Aoyama Gakuin University, SSRN, May 17, 2015 ---\n\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2607234\n\nAbstract:\n\nSince the 1970s, the decision-usefulness has taken center stage and our attention has been concentrated on valuation of assets and liabilities instead of income measurement. The concept of income, once considered the gravitational center of accounting has lost its primacy and become a byproduct of the balance sheet derived from the measurement of assets and liabilities.\n\nHowever, we have not been equipped with robust conceptual foundation supporting theoretically reasoned accounting measurement. It is not only theoretically but also practically important to renew our seemingly waned interest in the concept of income because ongoing reforms of accounting standards cannot be successfully implemented without a sound understanding of the concept of income.\n\nFinancial Statements Loss of Quality and Predictive Power\n\nJensen Comment\n\nI don't think the \"The EBITDA Epidemic Takes Its Cue from Standard Setters.\"\n\nLike Professor Verrecchia currently and my accounting Professor Bob Jaedicke decades earlier I think the \"EBITDA Epidemic\" takes its cue from investors and managers that have a \"functional fixation\" for earnings, eps, EBITDA, and P/E ratios --- when in fact those metrics are no longer defined by the FASB/IASB and may have a lot of misleading noise and secret manipulations.\n\n\"The EBITDA Epidemic Takes Its Cue from Standard Setters,\" by Tom Selling, The Accounting Onion, October 13, 2013 ---\n\nhttp://accountingonion.com/2013/10/the-ebitda-epidemic-takes-its-cue-from-standard-setters.html\n\nJensen Comment\n\nIf the FASB cannot define net earnings then it follows from cold logic that they cannot define measures derived from net earnings like EBITDA.\n\nHowever, virtually all private sector business firms compute net earnings and some measures derived from net earnings like eps, EBITDA, and P/E ratios.\n\nIt's doubtful whether net earnings for two different companies or even one company over two time intervals are really comparable.\n\nBut all that does not matter when it comes to adjudicating an insider trading case in court even if the accused may not really be an insider.\n\nI'm reminded of why billionaire Martha Stewart went to prison because she acted on inside information about a company --- inside information passed on to her by the CEO of that company. It doesn't matter that the amount of loss saved by the inside tip involved is insignificant compared to her billion-dollar portfolio. Evidence in the case made it clear that she did exploit other investors by acting on the inside tip no matter how insignificant the value of that tip to her. She was hauled off the clink in handcuffs and was released in less than five months. But her good name and reputation were tarnished forever ---\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart\n\nMark Cuban --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban\n\nFlamboyant billionaire Mark Cuban went on trial for very similar reasons (although later acquitted) , although the alleged insider tip and the value of the alleged tip is more obscure than in the Martha Stewart case. Like in the case of Martha Stewart the loss avoided is pocket change ($750,000) relative to Cuban's billion-dollar portfolio.\n\nIn the case of Martha Stewart the prosecution had her dead to rights in terms of timing of the tip and her stock sales. In the case of Mark Cuban the SEC's case is based upon an \"unreliable witness who refused to testify in person.\"\n\nhttp://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Lawyers+Mark+Cuban+begin+closing+arguments+billionaires/9038098/story.html\n\n\"An Accounting Lesson for Twitter,\" by Jonathan Weil, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 14, 2013 ---\n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-04/an-accounting-lesson-for-twitter-.html\n\nWhat Cuban failed to mention to the jury is that net earnings and EBITDA cannot be defined since the FASB elected to give the balance sheet priority over the income statement in financial reporting ---\n\n\"The Asset-Liability Approach: Primacy does not mean Priority,\" by Robert Bloomfield, FASRI Financial Accounting Standards Research Initiative, October 6, 2009 ---\n\nhttp://www.fasri.net/index.php/2009/10/the-asset-liability-approach-primacy-does-not-mean-priority/\n\nBob Jensen's threads on accounting history are at\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory01.htm#AccountingHistory\n\nBusiness History Center\n\nBusiness History --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_history\n\nHagley Digital Archives (business and technology history) --- http://digital.hagley.org/\n\nHISTORIC MILESTONE FOR CANADIAN ACCOUNTING PROFESSION ---\n\nhttp://www.accountingeducation.com/index.cfm?page=newsdetails&id=153719&utm_source=MailerMailer&utm_medium=email&utm_content=first-ever+Common+Final+Examination+(CFE)&utm_campaign=Double+Entries+21(20)\n\nChartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) congratulates the 2,219 students who successfully passed the professions first-ever Common Final Examination (CFE).\n\nThis is both an exciting and historic time for Canadas accounting profession, says Kevin Dancey, president and CEO, with CPA Canada. He notes that three legacy accounting designations have come together and are now operating under the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) banner across the country.\n\nCurrently, Canadian professional accountants who were grandfathered to CPA must also use their legacy designation in combination with the CPA designation.\n\nThe individuals being recognized today will be among the first crop of Canadian CPAs with no legacy designation once they have completed their practical experience, explains Dancey. These history makers should be proud of their accomplishment. They are on a career path that can offer a lifetime of rewards.\n\nIn addition to the technical skills associated with the profession, the CPA certification program offers a solid understanding of leadership, teamwork, communications and strategy. All of this skill and knowledge is combined with a strong understanding of what it means to be a professional and to act ethically.\n\nThe new CPA is more than an accounting designation - it also is a business credential, one that can open many doors, stresses Tashia Batstone, CPA Canadas vice-president, education. The program is designed to ensure it meets the needs of employers in all sectors of the Canadian economy.\n\nThis year, the prestigious Governor Generals Gold Medal along with the CPA Canada cash prize of $5,000 for the highest standing in Canada on the 2015 CFE has been awarded to Ms. Erin Compeau from Deloitte LLP in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nContinued in article\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on December 4, 2015\n\nBrick-and-mortar retailers struggled this holiday as consumers chose to point-and-click their way through shopping lists. The stampede of shoppers to the Web grew more thunderous during the final days before Christmas, testing the limits of delivery services and pushing retail chains into deeper, longer promotions than their e-commerce rivals, the WSJ reports. E-commerce sales rose 11.8% from Nov. 26 through Dec. 20 compared with a year ago, according to ChannelAdvisor Corp., which makes e-commerce software and measures online transactions.\n\nThe shift to online shopping is straining retailers and delivery networks. A few chains, including Eddie Bauer and Pacific Sunwear, warned customers this week that their holiday packages were delayed and blamed what they said were broader problems at FedEx Corp. FedEx said Wednesday it is running operations round-the-clock to accommodate additional unforeseen volume from some customers, but that its delivery network is performing as designed for the forecasted volumes from our major retail and e-tail customers.\"\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis puts a strain on sustainability accounting and the future of property taxes for towns and cities. When I left San Antonio a huge two-story mall that had been vacant for several years was taken over by the non-taxable school district. The biggest mall in the capitol of New Hampshire in Concord used to have a thriving food court that included Burger King and vendors of Italian food, Chinese food, sandwich shops, ice cream shops, etc. now has a darkened food court and more empty stores than stores that are still struggling. The Sears, JC Penney, and Bon Ton Department stores cannot possibly be breaking even. Such is the future of mall shopping.\n\nThe bill would also temporarily bar the IRS and SEC from passing increased disclosure rules for corporations and nonprofits\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on December 4, 2015\n\nMassive spending and tax deal advances.\n\nU.S. lawmakers in one fell swoop produced bills setting spending for fiscal 2016 that sweeps in hundreds of policy prescriptions and makes dozens of business and individual tax breaks permanent. The bills most contentious provision would end a four-decade ban on oil exports, though the relentlessly low price of oil makes it unlikely that any impact from the policy shift will materialize soon. The bill would also temporarily bar the IRS and SEC from passing increased disclosure rules for corporations and nonprofits. Solar and wind companies scored a major victory in the bill, when lawmakers voted to extend lucrative federal subsidies for renewable energy.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis illustrates one the many reasons I prefer that the FASB set accounting rules rather than the SEC. Lobbyists have influence almost everywhere but the biggest lapdogs are in Congress.\n\nAlthough Ryan gave more than he received in the $1.8 trillion budget that President Obama drooled over when signing the bill with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi cheering in the wings, there are some things Republicans favored that aren't getting much publicity.\n\n\"White House surrenders on 'dark money' regulation,\" by Katy O'Donnell, Politico, December 18, 2015 ---\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/white-house-dark-money-216956\n\nThe Obama administration has thrown in the towel on cracking down on hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money  funds given to advocacy groups that claim to be social welfare organizations rather than political committees.\n\nClosing the so-called social-welfare loophole  which exempts the groups from federal tax and disclosure requirements  was one of the most urgent priorities of campaign-finance reformers in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case. But then the IRS came under fire for holding up conservative groups applying for the social-welfare tax exemption, and many Republicans cried foul.\n\nBy giving in to a GOP provision in the omnibus spending bill, the administration has effectively given up on limiting the political influence of nonprofit groups with unknown funders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the bill.\n\nTop lawmakers, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, have repeatedly warned IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to abandon the agency's efforts to clarify the social-welfare rule. Now theyve forced his hand, just as the 2016 campaign is heating up and groups like Karl Roves Crossroads GPS on the right and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation on the left are poised to dump unprecedented sums into the presidential race and other campaigns.\n\nRead more: http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/white-house-dark-money-216956#ixzz3vMavz5fJ\n\nPermanent R&D Tax Credit a Game Changer ---\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2015/12/23/permanent-rd-tax-credit-a-game-changer-expert/?mod=djemCFO_h\n\nChristmas came early this year for finance chiefs hoping a permanent research and development tax credit would get President Barack Obamas signature.\n\nLast Fridays move made permanent a tax credit that leaves businesses with more money to use for investments and hiring as part of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.\n\nThe permanent credit is really a game changer, said Yair Holtzman, a practice leader for accounting firm Anchin, Block & Anchin LLPs research and development tax credits group.\n\nIts been unanimous, Mr. Holtzman said  finance executives really like the certainty that comes with having a permanent research credit.\n\nPrevious R&D credits were often retroactively renewed but uncertainty still weighed on finance chiefs minds, and hindered effective planning.

This erosion of power took place much, much slower and for reasons that are very complicated. One of the main suggested reasons is the failure of the AICPA to position its leadership in the changing times since the roaring 1990 paradigm shift in technological innovation in commerce. For example, after all the hype the AICPA proposed innovation called SysTrust crashed to earth like a Apollo 5 that is all but forgotten these days since no persons were badly hurt in a failed mission. There are of course many other examples for the demise of the AICPA, although nobody suggests that it has crashed and burned.\n\n\"The Center Cannot Hold: The AICPA and Accounting Professional Leadership 19972013,\" by R. Drew Sellers, Timothy J. Fogarty, and Larry M. Parker, Accounting Horizons, Volume 29, Issue 3 (September 2015) ---\n\nhttp://aaajournals.org/doi/full/10.2308/acch-51087\n\nTrade associations should play an integral role in defining and defending the legitimacy and jurisdiction of a profession. In addition, they should provide a field upon which individuals can rise above the confines of their organizations and grow their professional leadership capacities. Evidence in the literature suggests that U.S. accounting conformed to this pattern under the auspices of the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). However, various recent events have transpired that reduce the confidence that this continues to be the case. Using network analysis on longitudinal data from 1997 to 2013, this paper documents an increasingly fragmented and isolated leadership structure. This finding suggests the reduced influence of the AICPA. Surprisingly, this decline has not been offset by the stronger influences of the large international firms. Implications for the profession are discussed.\n\n. . .\n\nRecent Trauma Professions are always in a state of change, even if that change is not apparent to outsiders. Accordingly, one would expect that the role and function of a professional trade association would not be fixed. As noted by Fogarty (2011), change in accounting has been breathtaking even when measured between its 100th and 125th anniversaries. Fluctuations in the centrality of the AICPA might reflect important recent events.\n\nSeveral large and sudden corporate failures in the 1970s had challenged the accounting profession's ability to protect the public interest in audit engagements (Commission on Auditor Responsibility 1978). Auditing standards were also found to be insufficiently articulated to public expectations (Campbell and Mutchler 1988). Having already lost control over accounting standard setting for public companies, the AICPA fought vigorously, but unsuccessfully, against further inroads against its prerogatives in judging professional quality (Seidler 1979). These skirmishes failed to resolve underlying pressures on the profession (Carmichael 1979) leaving mixed opinions about its ongoing value (Zeff 2003). Prominent among the reforms of its era was the establishment of a semi-autonomous Public Oversight Board (Journal of Accountancy 1979), which began what would be the growing expectation of peer review not controlled by the AICPA (Kaiser 1989; Grisdela 1987). At the same time, the AICPA was unsuccessful at getting membership to accept its mandatory peer-review program for nonpublic engagements (Berton 1987). Accounting firms exhibited strong beliefs in their autonomy, rebuffing the AICPA-led rhetoric of collective needs (e.g., Olson 1980; Larson 1983). Peer review also revealed a significant schism between small and large accounting firms, with the former doubting the cost/benefit justification of new self-regulatory programs (Austin and Langston 1981). Through this period, the AICPA mostly struggled to find a degree of proactivity with its membership that might stave off a more intrusive external regulation.\n\nA new era dawned in the advent of the millennium. The robust economy of the 1990s led to pressures to revise the traditional model of the partnership of accounting practitioners (Zeff 2003). The AICPA became fearful that practice, as it was currently delivered, would not be sustainable in the wake of organizational and technological change. The AICPA launched a massive multi-year CPA Vision Project, which sought to move the profession further up the value chain, after defining a competency framework (Eddy 2001b). Essentially, a migration toward business advisory and consulting and away from tax compliance and traditional assurance services was strongly recommended. In retrospect, the Vision Project had no discernible market, even if it contained an accurate view of the trajectory of services. The large firms had already occupied as much of this space as they could manage. The small firms enjoyed record incomes by providing services that they had great comfort in delivering, and could not be persuaded to do otherwise (Fogarty et al. 2006). The AICPA, in persisting with the messages that all firm benefits had to be Vision-aligned (Eddy 2001a) and that new CPAs also had to be Vision-based (AICPA 2001), bet a good deal of its credibility on its forecasts.\n\nAICPA motives in the wake of the brave new world that it foretold was conflicted by other related initiatives. The AICPA, seeing the migration of businesses to the Internet, attempted to launch a web-trust seal (a.k.a. SysTrust), which it hoped would nudge broader thinking about assurance services (McPhie 2002). This effort never achieved much interest from clients of CPA firms and, in retrospect, appears to be a misreading of the client market and practitioners abilities (Boulianne and Cho 2009). AICPA insiders also created a web portal at this time (CPA2BIZ.com) as a for-profit side business that attempted to broker various professional services over the Internet. Since any profit would not benefit the AICPA membership, nor did it further any version of the public interest, some asserted a serious conflict of interest (Shafer and Owsen 2003).\n\nIn retrospect, the AICPA's most egregious misstep may have been its efforts to move away from the CPA designation. By advocating a new credential that would subsume the CPA within a new global business advisor designation (ultimately and unfortunately called the Cognitor), the AICPA boldly asserted the need to invade new domains of work (Shafer and Gendron 2005). Many practitioners resented the implication that their CPA was not sufficient, and that they would need to migrate to a certificate that had just been imagined (Covaleski, Dirsmith, and Rittenberg 2003). Despite an impressive national and local campaign, the AICPA was unable to lead the membership toward its future, suffering an embarrassing 2002 referendum defeat. Washed away in the storm were more modest dreams for limited collaborations with the legal professions (see Frank, Hanson, Lowe, and Smith 2001).\n\nWhereas the Vision project and the Cognitor proposal were instances where the AICPA outreached what the membership wanted, a less-sympathetic and understandable posture occurred in the wake of the wave of accounting-implicated corporate bankruptcies of 20012002. Traditional auditing services had been under fee pressure for some time. This situation emboldened client demands for favorable aggressive treatments (Zeff 2003). The large firms had largely responded by pioneering a hybrid audit that added material consultancy elements, in the name of creating a premier noncommodified value-added service (Toffler and Reingold 2003; Jeppesen 1998), an effort distinctly at the vanguard of the AICPA's value chain of services. In the face of the firestorm that consumed Arthur Andersen, with public confidence in the accounting profession at record lows, the AICPA was unable to convincingly regain the high ground. Suggestions that accountants were dedicated to the public interest were compromised and ineffective (Henry and McNamee 2003; Rogers, Dillard, Yuthas 2005). The organization's previous efforts to promote a large-firm agenda, including a largely successful effort to reduce auditors' legal liability, made it a less than credible advocate of the public interest. Leaders of the organization had no options but to go on the defensive, promising to get their own house in order (Melancon 2002) and return practice to its classic professionalism (Carmichael 2003). However, lost trust in financial circles is difficult to restore (Unerman and O'Dwyer 2004).\n\nAs the U.S. government undertook the official response to what had become known as Enron et al. with what would be the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the AICPA should have had the ability to shape and negotiate a resolution that would be acceptable to practice. However, the legislation effectively stripped the AICPA and the profession of its remaining self-regulation function, placing public firm practice under the direct legal control of an external body. During this critical point, the AICPA had no political capital (Knoll 2006). Having not objected to the blurring of traditional scope limitations before 2001, the AICPA was not able to meaningfully enter into the post-2001 governmental decision to decouple auditing and consulting service. It also stood on the sidelines as a governmental indictment swiftly led to the dismantling of Arthur Andersen. Much to most people's surprise, the AICPA did not even discharge its chief executive for mismanagement, a move that many had seen as a fore drawn conclusion (MacDonald 2002).\n\nThe loss of self-regulation, despite the expenditure of significant lobbying resources (Thornburg and Roberts 2008), left less for the AICPA to do. In addition to changing the tenor of outcomes (DeFond 2010), the new regulatory regime put practitioners into an unbuffered and unfiltered relationship with regulators that was more likely to result in harsh consequences (Hanson 2013) and, probably, lower practitioner prestige (Huber 2013).\n\nThe management of its membership has always been problematic for the AICPA. Unlike other professional trade associations, this organization is whipsawed by the disproportionate size of accounting firms. A few large firms are capable of exercising considerable power over the AICPA's agenda. With AICPA membership in a long-term trend of coming from outside public accounting (Young 1995; Grant 2008), such priorities are increasingly unacceptable, even if complaints about them are not new (Weinstein 1987). Large firms are more likely to pursue global issues, favor maximum flexibility in practice, and demand rapid innovations. Smaller firms, and those without a publicly traded audit clientele, would prefer a more conservative platform wherein more advantage is extracted from current arrangements. The AICPA cannot assume that its membership would even support core professional values (see Suddaby, Gendron, and Lam 2009). How aggressively the AICPA should pursue the collective interests of the profession also tends to be disputed in its details (see Picard, Durocher, and Gendron 2014).\n\nThe AICPA has been slow to recognize the needs of members to signal practice specialties, apparently fearing erosion of the CPA as the sine qua non of professional inclusion. Those practicing in peripheral, but growing, areas naturally felt underserved if not neglected by the AICPA. In a sudden recent revision of position, the AICPA has operated a program that issues management accounting credentials to any interested member (AICPA 2011) as part of a trans-national professional practice partnership. However, yet to be resolved are high-potential areas such as forensic accounting. The AICPA's willingness to move on specialized credentials seems more defensive than proactive. Without a comprehensive answer to specialization recognition, the AICPA risks being perceived as more of a self-interested operator that views membership interests as a constraint, rather than as a champion of the membership's interests.\n\nTrade associations are known for what they fail to do, as well as for what they accomplish. The AICPA's largest shortfall seems to be in the articulation of practice with the public interest. Having power to do so, the AICPA has had little to add to the standards and enforcement of ethics and independence, topics that garnered significant attention in the 1980s (Preston, Cooper, Scarbrough, and Chilton 1995; AICPA 1986). Some have argued that AICPA positions on these matters have been actually injurious to the public interest (Collins and Schultz 1995). More recently, AICPA statements about the public interest are more likely to be absent than bias (Reiter 2013). Although disagreement exists as to why the AICPA has vacated this space (Hendrickson 2001), the organization clearly no longer acts as a counterweight against the commercialization of accounting (Suddaby et al. 2009; Carrington, Johansson, Johed, and Ohman 2013). This new lack of interest in the public interest is believed to contribute to a worsening collective reputation for the profession (Carnegie and Napier 2010). The belief that the market for professional services will always provide answers may also have silenced the AICPA on issues such as the compatibility of services, auditor rotation, tax reform, and international accounting standards.\n\nTechnological change arguably presents the most revolutionary source of practice alteration. As a former AICPA chair noted, Technology is going to define us and how we do business for the foreseeable future (Eddy 2001b). The balance struck between the pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness matters to the value of the profession's services (Fischer and Dirsmith 1995). A profession's use of technology can be both skilling and deskilling (Pern and Scattergood 1985), thereby potentially damaging the idea of equality within the ranks. The AICPA has remained relatively silent on this consequential front, except to the extent that it offers yearly reviews of software used by tax preparers. Thus, it implicitly promotes the belief that all technology is a movement toward progress and greater profitability. By advocating the use of skills that are distinctly and exclusively human, like judgment, the AICPA could communicate the need to use new forms of information processing judiciously and prudently. Apparently, the AICPA has not chosen to be a thought leader in this arena.\n\nIn sum, the work of professional trade associations is never easy. The AICPA over the last few decades may have witnessed the proverbial perfect storm, with mild governmental intrusion, followed by the pipe dreams of abundance, followed by an unprecedented crash. Turbulence of this nature made it difficult to be the unified front of a profession that comprises many diverse segments. Why its membership may have found fault with the AICPA could have been grounded in many different and sometimes opposite reasons. It may have centered upon how a person defines the public interest and professionalism, juxtaposed against a specific or general AICPA action or inaction. Collectively, these prospects diminish the possibilities that the AICPA has remained central to leadership of the profession. An individual aspiring the accounting profession's leadership may have found new organizational vehicles or career avenues.\n\nResearch Propositions The above discussion supports the need to test the contribution of AICPA involvement to the careers of those individuals who attain prominence in the accounting profession. Several reasons exist to believe that the trade association used by the U.S. accounting profession no longer captures the loyalty and interest of practicing accountants. Such a decline may be partially attributed to changes in the nature of practice, and partly due to the shortcomings of the AICPA. By focusing on the profession's leaders, the argument does not depend upon the behavior of the rank and file. Those with aspirations to lead the profession would be more likely to seek roles within the trade association, and use such associations to further their position as a leader. This ambition can be approached in different ways. The most intuitive approach pertains to frequency of involvements. This approach is illustrated by the following:\n\nRP1: The number of leaders of the accounting profession with explicit ties to the AICPA has declined over time.\n\nContinued in article\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis is material for a novel but probably not a blockbuster novel due to details that are hard to explain in a way that will excite most readers shopping for books in airports before boarding flights.

Then it dawned on me that this is the way to sell perishables when no refrigeration is available. This makes me wonder if ISIS stores non-refrigerated live captives until an order comes in for a harvested body part in the black market when efforts to collect ransoms fail. I remember a movie where the kidnappers lower the price after Bette Midler's husband refuses to meet the kidnappers' price. Her question while in captivity: \"You mean I'm being discounted?\"\n\nThis organ harvesting illustration might be used to illustrate the calculation of the Sales Mix Variance if the organs unused organs cannot be preserved ---\n\nhttp://accounting-simplified.com/management/variance-analysis/sales/mix.html\n\nFor example, if Captive A is harvested for a kidney order and the other organs cannot be preserved the sale is probably less profitable than when Captive B is harvested for a heart. Cost variances are very difficult to calculate in this illustration because there are so many joint costs before a particular organ is harvested. But the Caliphate can make use of the sales mix variances computed by his accounting staff. This business will be much more profitable for ISIS once brain transplants become feasible.\n\n\"Did Fair-Value Accounting Contribute to the Financial Crisis?\"\n\nby Christian Laux, Christian Leuz\n\nNBER Working Paper No. 15515 Issued in November 2009 NBER Program(s): CF\n\nThe recent financial crisis has led to a major debate about fair-value accounting. Many critics have argued that fair-value accounting, often also called mark-to-market accounting, has significantly contributed to the financial crisis or, at least, exacerbated its severity. In this paper, we assess these arguments and examine the role of fair-value accounting in the financial crisis using descriptive data and empirical evidence. Based on our analysis, it is unlikely that fair-value accounting added to the severity of the current financial crisis in a major way. While there may have been downward spirals or asset-fire sales in certain markets, we find little evidence that these effects are the result of fair-value accounting. We also find little support for claims that fair-value accounting leads to excessive write-downs of banks' assets. If anything, empirical evidence to date points in the opposite direction, that is, towards overvaluation of bank assets.\n\nDon't Blame Fair Value Accounting Standards (except in terms of executive bonus payments)\n\nThis includes a bull crap case based on an article by the former head of the FDIC\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/2008Bailout.htm#FairValue\n\nBob Jensen's threads on fair value accounting ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/Theory02.htm#FairValueFails\n\n\"The History of the Black-Scholes Formula,\" Priceonomics, December 15, 2015\n\nhttp://priceonomics.com/the-history-of-the-black-scholes-formula/\n\nThere is a section in the above document on how the Black-Scholes formula was implemented by two Nobel Economists (including Myron Scholes), their doctoral students, and a key friend into an index fund called Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) that very nearly caused the entire collapse of Wall Street due to an overlooked assumption of the Formula that that failed during an extremely unlikely collapse of the Asian securities market. Big Wall Street firms quietly paid for the scandal to go away.\n\nA particularly good video produced by PBS Nova explains the Black-Scholes Formula and how it let to the demise of LTCM in a \"Trillion Dollar Bet.\"\n\nThe Trillion Dollar Bet transcripts are free --- http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2704stockmarket.html\n\nHowever, you really have to watch the graphics in the video to appreciate this educational video --- http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/stockmarket/\n\n\"Trillion Dollar Bet\"\n\nNobel Prize Winners (Myron Scholes from Stanford, Robert Merton from Harvard) Must Pay Millions Due to Tax Fraud\n\n\"Judge's Ruling In LTCM Case May Resonate,\" by Diya Gullapalli and Henny Sender, The Wall Street Journal, . August 30, 2004; Page C1\n\nA federal judge Friday ruled against a defunct hedge fund whose name has become synonymous with the concept of \"systemic risk,\" in a decision that singled out a Nobel Prize winner for criticism and that could have implications for other hedge funds seeking to avoid taxes.\n\nJudge Janet Bond Arterton denied Long-Term Capital Management's attempt to reclaim $40 million in taxes, ending a monthlong civil trial involving the fund that was wound down in 1998. Her ruling upheld an Internal Revenue Service claim that the fund had filed improper deductions.\n\nIn a nearly 200-page opinion from her bench in New Haven, Conn., Judge Arterton outlined why she believed tax shelters employed by LTCM lacked the business purpose required to make them legal. She ruled that the fund engaged in at least nine complex leasing transactions that didn't have economic substance and were instead designed mainly to create losses of $106 million to offset LTCM's tax burden.\n\nThe transactions, with acronyms such as CHIPS for Computer Hardware Investment Portfolio, and TRIPS, for Trucking Investment Portfolios, began in 1996 when LTCM swapped a stake in the fund for preferred stock of five U.S. companies.\n\nThat stock was owned by Onslow Trading & Commercial LLC, an entity based in the United Kingdom that acquired the preferred stock in exchange for what are known as lease-stripping and sale-lease-back transactions.\n\nJudge Arterton's ruling means LTCM must pay roughly $16 million in IRS penalties, or 40% of the $40 million LTCM had been trying to reclaim. Because the U.S. tax code is enforced through civil litigation, no criminal charges are anticipated against the LTCM partners, who include high-profile finance whizzes such as John Meriwether, the ex-Salomon Brothers bond boss who started the fund and Nobel Prize winner Robert Merton.\n\nA lawyer for LTCM didn't return calls seeking comment.\n\nThe tax-shelter strategies at LTCM were run mainly by Myron Scholes, who shared the Nobel Prize with Mr. Merton. Dr. Scholes worked on option pricing captured in the Black-Scholes model widely used on Wall Street.\n\nDr. Scholes was cast in a harsh light in Judge Arterton's opinion.\n\nThe judge wrote that Dr. Scholes and Larry Noe, a tax director at LTCM, were \"well aware of the tax requirements of economic substance and business purpose and discussed the need therefore to figure out a reason independent of taxes for Long Term to engage in a transaction.\"\n\nDr. Scholes couldn't be reached to comment.\n\n\"This ruling sends a message that cannot be mistaken that the government means business when cracking down on tax shelters,\" says Itzhak Shirav, an accounting professor at Columbia Business School in New York. \"This was a clear-cut case where lame excuses were offered and totally rejected.\"\n\nJudge Arterton's ruling is the latest criticism of tax shelters and part of the government's broader effort to crack down on such schemes.\n\nBoth the IRS and Treasury Department have issued notices criticizing transactions in which advisers used offshore insurance companies to create tax shelters for hedge-fund investments.\n\nSome experts say the ruling could also provide ammunition for critics to demand more disclosure on how often-secretive hedge funds generate returns.\n\nJudge Arterton's ruling was as a sober footnote to the saga of LTCM, which opened for business in February of 1994 with more than $1 billion in equity capital, $150 million of which came from 12 founding partners.\n\nThose partners included the best and the brightest of the then Salomon Brothers bond-trading desk, led by Mr. Meriwether and Messrs. Merton and Scholes. Within several years, the fund's capital had swelled to $5 billion, making it bigger -- and more profitable -- than Salomon.\n\nLTCM seemed to have delivered on its promise to produce stellar returns with low risk. In 1995, its first full year of operation, it returned almost 59%. By 1997, however, returns were down to about 20%, as the price discrepancies the fund looked to exploit were fast disappearing, and the Asian financial crisis was unfolding.\n\nTo compensate, the fund began using more borrowed money -- a strategy that exacerbated the impact of the fund's collapse in 1998.\n\nBy then, LTCM had assets of $100 billion but $1 trillion worth of total exposure.\n\nThen came the Russian debt crisis, triggering a loss in the value of LTCM's leveraged positions world-wide and raising the possibility that the fund's problems could trigger a chain of losses.\n\nThat led the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to orchestrate an orderly liquidation of its trades to prevent the so-called global systemic risk.\n\nToday, Mr. Scholes is an emeritus professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in Palo Alto, Calif., while Mr. Merton is on the faculty of Harvard University's Graduate School of Business Administration.\n\nMr. Meriwether is a principal and co-founder of JWM Partners LLC, an investment firm in Connecticut.\n\nVideo: Nobel laureate and Stanford Professor Myron S.

The trick is to be accepted in a very competitive admissions process that is even more competitive for whites. These are not the only heavily endowed universities offering free tuition and other financial aid to the middle-class and poor students. This tends to offset the decline in merit-based financial aid that is independent of family income.\n\nStudents who are not admitted to elite universities or otherwise cannot attend may get windows to thousands of elite university courses available as MOOCs ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/updateee.htm#OKI\n\nIncreasingly academic credit can also be obtained from MOOCs by paying greatly reduced fees relative to tuition for onsite courses. There are all sorts of opportunities worldwide for inexpensive online credit and even more opportunities for learning without obtaining transcript credit. For example, thousands of tutorials in math, science, and other disciplines are now available free from Khan Academy. The point is that students who merely want to learn can become greater experts than students who graduate from elite universities. The key is motivation to learn by whatever means possible where the materials available for learning are free.\n\nThe scandal in higher education is grade inflation\n\nVirtually all USA universities and especially the elite universities have moved median course grades from C in the 1940s to A- in the 21st Century such that graduating high grades no longer means as much. The coin of an education is badly cheapened by grade inflation where students receive high grades without much real learning ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm#RateMyProfessor\n\nGrade inflation also exists in other nations, but many other nations are different from the USA (where slow learners can always be admitted to some college) in that only the intellectually elite are allowed to go to college ---\n\nOECD Study Published in 2014: List of countries by 25- to 34-year-olds having a tertiary education degree ---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_25-_to_34-year-olds_having_a_tertiary_education_degree\n\nWhereas nations like Finland and Germany only admit elite and motivated learners into colleges, what Bernie Sanders intends is that virtually anybody who wants to can be admitted to college for free. Sanders most likely hopes that the unmotivated and low-aptitude admissions will not graduate, but there are not many such academic standards in this era of grade inflation ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/assess.htm#RateMyProfessor\n\nIn my opinion college diplomas will mean less and less as the 21st Century unfolds even though taxpayers will be shelling out billions for degrees not worth the sheepskin they're printed on.\n\nMOOC for Credit and Noncredit Updates\n\nEdX (edX) --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX\n\nCoursera --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera\n\nArizona State University (ASU) --- http://www.asu.edu/\n\nGlobal Freshman Academy at ASU --- http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/three-questions-for-the-asuedx-global-freshman-academy-online-program/#.mdnza8b:OlFh\n\nJensen Comment\n\nArizona State University is one of the most innovative, if not the most innovative, large and respected universities in the USA.

Originally, only employees who had a prior two years of college were eligible, but now virtually all full-time Starbucks employees are eligible to study online for four years from ASU for an undergraduate degree. This Starbucks fringe benefit is part of ASU's innovative online distance education program that is a fee-based program instead of a free MOOC program.

Speaking to Inside Higher Ed in April, Philip Regier, university dean for educational initiatives, said there were a lot of uncertainties around that number. He added that he expected maybe 25,000 to register for some of the MOOCs. The astronomy MOOC, the largest of the first three, attracted 13,423 registrants.\n\nA spokesperson for the university, in response to whether the results are satisfactory, said, ASUs goal is reaching learners who want access to high-quality college-level education. The Global Freshman Academy charts a new path in access to higher education, and the results of the inaugural courses are a positive first step for the GFA.\n\nLow completion rates are nothing new to MOOCs. In fact, a completion rate in the low double digits -- even in the high teens -- can be seen as a success.\n\nMOOC researchers, however, have argued that completion rates dont matter as much as they do in traditional online and face-to-face courses. The open structure of MOOCs, they say, allows learners to register for a course but only focus on a handful of units. In other words, a low completion rate can mask the fact that many learners got something out of the MOOC, even if they didnt finish it.\n\nIn open online learning, completion numbers provide only one small perspective on people's learning experiences, Justin Reich, executive director of MITs Teaching Systems Lab, said in an email. It would also be worth learning more about the experiences of the 3,300 or the 34,000. Did they have good learning experiences? Are they more familiar with ASU and its faculty? What public interests or institutional interests were served by offering the course?\n\nReich has previously explored the demographics of the learners who registered for MOOCs offered by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- the two institutions behind edX. His recent research, which appeared earlier this month in Science, found MOOCs can exacerbate rather than reduce disparities in educational outcomes related to socioeconomic status. The results build on earlier findings about MOOCs, which have suggested MOOCs cater more to older learners with previously earned degrees instead of the learners ASU is targeting -- high school students, international students and students considering community college, among others.\n\nI'm not surprised that few people took advantage of the credit option in the first run -- that's been common across certificate experiments in MOOCs, Reich wrote. A trajectory over time will be more useful than a snapshot. If these numbers stay very low, it will be harder to justify continuing the program than if they grow quickly and if the program gets more accepted and recognized.\n\nContinued in article\n\n\"Nearly 4,000 Starbucks Employees Apply to Arizona State (online),\" Inside Higher Ed, September 3, 2014 ---\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/09/03/nearly-4000-starbucks-employees-apply-arizona-state\n\nFollowing Starbucks employee education benefits with Arizona State University,\n\nAnthem Blue Cross offers education benefits with the University of Southern New Hampshire\n\n\"An Increasingly Popular Job Perk: Online Education,\" by Mary Ellen McIntire, Chronicle of Higher Education, June 2, 2015 ---\n\nhttp://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/an-increasingly-popular-job-perk-online-education/56771?cid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en\n\nWal-Mart subsidizes an entire undergraduate degree.\n\n\"Fiat Chrysler Offers Degrees to Employee Families (including families of dealer employees) ,\" Inside Higher Ed, November 23, 2015 ---\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/11/23/fiat-chrysler-offers-degrees-employee-families?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=b3c3eb755f-DNU20151123&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-b3c3eb755f-197565045\n\nBob Jensen's threads on fee-based distance education ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/CrossBorder.htm\n\nBob Jensen's threads on free online education (most of which still offers free learning without college credits) ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/updateee.htm#OKI\n\nBob Jensen's threads on fee-based distance education alternatives ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/CrossBorder.htm\n\n\"The 12 Most Popular Free Online Courses (MOOCs) For Professionals,\" by Maggie Zhang, Business Insider, July 8, 2014 ---\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/free-online-courses-for-professionals-2014-7\n\n01.

In this paper I study the interpretation of the regression estimand when treatment effects are in fact heterogeneous. I show that the coefficient on treatment is identical to the outcome of the following three-step procedure: first, calculate the linear projection of treatment on the vector of other covariates (propensity score); second, calculate average partial effects for both groups of interest (treated and controls) from a regression of outcome on treatment, the propensity score, and their interaction; third, calculate a weighted average of these two effects, with weights being inversely related to the unconditional probability that a unit belongs to a given group. Each of these steps is potentially problematic, but this last property  the reliance on implicit weights which are inversely related to the proportion of each group  can have particularly severe consequences for applied work. To illustrate the importance of this result, I perform Monte Carlo simulations as well as replicate two applied papers: Berger, Easterly, Nunn and Satyanath (2013) on the effects of successful CIA interventions during the Cold War on imports from the US; and Martinez-Bravo (2014) on the effects of appointed officials on village-level electoral results in Indonesia. In both cases some of the conclusions change dramatically after allowing for heterogeneity in effect.\n\nCommon Accountics Science and Econometric Science Statistical Mistakes ---\n\nhttp://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/temp/AccounticsScienceStatisticalMistakes.htm\n\nHow Accountics Scientists Should Change:\n\n\"Frankly, Scarlett, after I get a hit for my resume in The Accounting Review I just don't give a damn\"\n\nhttp://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/temp/AccounticsDamn.htm\n\nOne more mission in what's left of my life will be to try to change this\n\nhttp://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/temp/AccounticsDamn.htm\n\n\"NBC White Paper 1980.

Christian Mastilak, Christopher D. Hodgdon, and Joyce S. Allen, Issues in Accounting Education, November 2015 ---\n\nhttp://aaajournals.org/doi/full/10.2308/iace-51162\n\nIn this paper we discuss the challenges of teaching U.S. GAAP and IFRS side by side. We then focus on one particular challenge of teaching both the more detailed U.S. standards and the less specific IFRS: the likelihood that students will anchor on the precise rules in U.S. GAAP when applying the less specific guidelines under IFRS. As a part of this discussion, we report on a classroom experiment designed to test for the presence of anchoring on U.S. GAAP rules when applying IFRS in a lease classification task. Our results indicate that students do anchor on the U.S. GAAP bright-line values for lease accounting when classifying leases under IFRS, primarily when U.S. GAAP rules provide an acceptable quantification of IFRS' less precise guidelines. We do not find that teaching order (i.e., teaching U.S. GAAP first versus IFRS first) directly affects anchoring or lease classification. However, a moderation analysis suggests the interaction between teaching order and anchoring may affect lease classification. Our results suggest that, where possible, instructors may wish to teach principles-based accounting prior to rules-based accounting to mitigate potential anchoring by students and its effect on their accounting judgments.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal on June 6, 2013\n\nFASBs Seidman: Americans prefer rules to principles\n\nOutgoing FASB Chairman Leslie Seidman has had plenty of time to tackle long-standing questions about whether accounting principles are more desirable than specific accounting rules, writes Emily Chasan. The debate over whether detailed rules and bright-line exceptions are more or less useful than broad principles that require management judgment has dominated her past 1o years on the board. I think its undeniable that we Americans like our rules, Ms. Seidman said at a Financial Executives International conference in New York on Tuesday, where she was discussing the accounting rulemakers soon-to-be-completed joint project on revenue-recognition accounting. She made the comments in her final public speech as chairman of the U.S. accounting rulemaker.\n\n\"Study: Rules-based Accounting Shields Firms From Lawsuits,\" by Jr. Deputy Accountant Adrienne Gonzalez, Going Concern, January 15, 2013 ---\n\nhttp://goingconcern.com/post/study-rules-based-accounting-shields-firms-lawsuits\n\nAccording to groundbreaking research by Richard Mergenthaler, assistant professor of accounting at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business, shareholders are more likely to sue firms that use principles-based accounting standards over rules-based standards.\n\nContinued in article\n\nJensen Comment\n\nI would have hypothesized that it would be the other way around on the basis that it's really hard to nail Jello to a wall.\n\nPrinciples-Based standards also complicate enforcement of regulations\n\nThere are some hurdles that have to be passed before were going to be comfortable making the ultimate decision about whether to incorporate IFRS into the U.S. reporting regime.

DeBerg,\" AICPA, December 1, 2015 ---\n\nhttp://blog.aicpa.org/2015/12/reinventing-the-way-we-learn-accounting.html#sthash.TFYaWDJH.WxPwxX39.dpbs\n\nWe live in an age of short attention spans and demands for more productivity. In my role as an accounting professor, if I dont grab my accounting students attention and immediately explain the relevancy of a topic, they tune out.\n\nTodays young people have a greater aptitude for learning new skills, especially when it comes to new technological applications. They enjoy experimenting, and they dont mind failing  as long as failure is just a hurdle on the way to the reward at the finish line. Short attention spans and the need to multi-task are not limited to college students.\n\nThe nature of todays business environment requires CPAs to be multitaskers. Thirty years ago when I was a CPA in public practice, we used to take CPE courses once or twice a year to catch up on new standards and guidance. Today, changes are taking place so quickly that we need to be learning new material daily. Our instructional methods and learning habits need to adapt accordingly.\n\nNano Learning: Breaking Instruction Into Small Pieces\n\nNano learning breaks instruction into self-contained modules that can last from two to 15 minutes. These small lessons focus on one or two specific learning objectives. Additionally, theyre typically available on-demand so students and professionals can learn at their own pace, in their own space, amid their other responsibilities. Many educators and students feel the best way to learn, still, is face-to-face instruction in small group settings, assuming that time is available and the instructor is motivated and inspired. But what if in-person access is not easy, the class setting is not personal, or the instruction is mediocre? A great instructor from a distance who is available for live chats or video conferences might actually be the superior option.\n\nBlended Learning:\n\nStimulating Every Learning Style\n\nEven with face-to-face instruction, technology now allows us to develop new ways to appeal to different learning styles.\n\nAt my university, for example, Principles of Financial Accounting is the first required course for business majors. To invigorate student engagement in a course dreaded by many, I adopted a blended learning approach known as a flipped classroom.\n\nStudents are required to watch short lecture videos before the first class meeting each week. In the second meeting, students are broken into four groups of 30, with each sub-group broken down into groups of three. The breakout sections are led by four mentors, who are outstanding senior accounting majors. Students do their homework during class time in their breakout groups. Hence, what formerly was homework becomes classwork; what was classwork now becomes homework.

The Economic Consequences of Low-Quality Audits,\" by Quinn T. Swanquist and Robert L. Whited, The Accounting Review, November 2015 ---\n\nhttp://aaajournals.org/doi/full/10.2308/accr-51113\n\nThis study investigates whether the market for audit clients penalizes auditors following association with low-quality audits. Specifically, we examine whether audit offices experience a loss in local market share following client restatements. We document that the frequency of restatement announcements within an office-year (contamination) is inversely related to subsequent year-over-year change in local market share. Further analysis indicates that restatements impair the office's ability to both attract and retain audit clients. We find that this effect is strongest in high competition markets and diminished in low competition markets. We also examine auditor retention decisions at the client level and find that the likelihood of auditor dismissal increases with contamination, even for non-restating clients. We also find that, on average, clients dismissing their auditor select less contaminated audit offices. Taken together, our results suggest that market forces penalize auditors for association with audit failures, thereby providing an incentive to maintain high-quality audits and protect reputational capital.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nMy own opinion is that this article is misleading in that so many factors affecting client acquisition and retention cannot be measured. Among all these factors I doubt that restatemetns of other clients are such large factors relative to what I consider to be more important factors like price and expertise within the audit firms. For example, an insurance firm is going to be more concerned with the expertise of the auditors complicated insurance accounting and firms with lots of derivatives want auditors who know how to spell the word derivatives. Then there are what I consider extremely important factors such as the rapport of the client management with the top auditors such as rapport in clubs and on the golf courses and in the synagogues.\n\nThose of you interested in tracking The Accounting Review's trends in submissions, refereeing, and acceptances'rejections should be interested in current senior editor Mark L.

These widely used and commonly misapplied statistics have been blamed for giving a veneer of legitimacy to dodgy study results, encouraging bad research practices and promoting false-positive study results.\n\nBut after writing about p-values again and again, and recently issuing a correction on a nearly year-old story over some erroneous information regarding a studys p-value (which Id taken from the scientists themselves and their report), Ive come to think that the most fundamental problem with p-values is that no one can really say what they are.\n\nLast week, I attended the inaugural METRICS conference at Stanford, which brought together some of the worlds leading experts on meta-science, or the study of studies. I figured that if anyone could explain p-values in plain English, these folks could. I was wrong.\n\nContinued in article\n\nJensen Comment\n\nWhy all the fuss? Accountics scientists have a perfectly logical explanation. P-values are numbers that are pumped out of statistical analysis software (mostly multiple regression software) that accounting research journal editors think indicate the degree of causality or at least suggest the degree of causality to readers. But the joke is on the editors, because there aren't any readers.\n\nNovember 30, 2015 reply from David Johnstone\n\nDear Bob, thankyou for this interesting stuff.\n\nA big part of the acceptance of P-values is that they easily give the look of something having been found. So its an agency problem, where the researchers do what makes their research outcomes easier and better looking.\n\nThere is a lot more to it of course. I note with young staff that they face enough hurdles in the need to get papers written and published without thinking that the very techniques that they are trying to emulate might be flawed. Rightfully, they say, its not my job to question everything that I have been shown and to get nowhere as a result, nor can most believe that something so established and revered can be wrong, that is just too unthinkable and depressing. So the bandwagon goes on, and, as Bob says, no one cares outside as no one much reads it.\n\nI do however get annoyed every time I hear decision makers carry on about evidence based policy, as if no one can have a clue or form a vision or strategy without first having the backing of some junk science by a sociologist or educationist or accounting researcher who was just twisting the world whichever way to get significant p-values and a good story. This kind of cargo-culting, which is everywhere, does great harm to good or sincere science, as it makes it hard for an outsider to tell the difference.\n\nOne thing that does not get much of a hearing is that the statisticians themselves must take a lot of blame. They had the chance to vote off P values decades ago when they had to choose between frequentist and Bayesian logic. They split into two camps with the frequentists in the great majority but holding the weakest ground intellectually. The numbers are moving now, as people that were not born when de Finetti, Savage, Lindley, Kadane and others first said that p-values were ill-conceived logically. Accounting, of course, being largely ignorant of there being any issue, and ultimately just political, will not be leading the battle of ideas.\n\nMost Popular Tax Prof Blogs for the Week Ended December 13, 2015 ---\n\nhttp://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2015/12/this-.html\n\nNY Times: Microaggression In The Gym  Millennial Men Struggle To Dress In Health Club Locker Rooms\n\nThe IRS Scandal, Day 943\n\nHarvard Law Students Issue 7-Page List Of Demands In Wake Of Racial Unrest\n\nThe IRS Scandal, Day 944\n\nCollege And University President Salaries, 2013\n\nChristians: Understanding The Accidental American  Tina's Story\n\nWill Technology Create More Legal Jobs Than It Destroys?\n\nCongress Orders IRS To Use Private Debt Collection Companies\n\nChristian University President: This Is Not A Day Care, 1 Corinthians 13 Is Not A Microaggression\n\nFleischer: Skadden As Tom Cruise  Yahoos Spinoff Plan Could Be Risky Business\n\nQuestion from Item 1 above\n\nDo men and boys still swim nude in YMCA pools?\n\nI recall visiting two such pools as a young boy when boys and men were all swimming nude.at the same time.\n\n\"Six strange (bizarre) Australian taxes,\" by Chris Sheedy, CAS, November 2015 ---\n\nhttps://www.icas.com/ca-today-news/six-strange-australian-taxes\n\n. . .\n\n1.

From corporate tax plans to revenue from insurance contracts, CFOs will need to make sure their departments are sufficiently nimble to cope with the next wave of compliance demands.\n\nCFOs received some breathing room when the Financial Accounting Standards Board disclosed it would allow companies to wait an until 2018instead of 2017to adopt rules governing how they account for deferred revenue from everything from cellphone contracts to car sales to software. Still, many large firms say they have been preparing parallel books in preparation for the rule changes, and a delay would be costly and unnecessary. Some indicated in comment letters to FASB that they would adopt the rule early, which FASB will allow.\n\nAnd then theres the matter of lease accounting, not to mention new standards for insurance contracts. But perhaps some of the biggest unsettled matters for financial chiefs as 2015 winds down are in the area of taxation. Still on the legislative tax agenda are the roughly 50 temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 known as tax extenders, including the research-and-development tax credit and the bonus depreciation tax break that helps companies accelerate deductions for capital investments\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on December 4, 2015\n\nThe special excise on high-cost health plans known as the Cadillac tax isnt set to go into effect until 2018, but lawmakers have already taken steps to prevent it from kicking in. Even so, with a veto threat in the air from President Obama, its ultimate fate remains uncertain, Kimberly S. Johnson and Maxwell Murphy report. In a 90-10 vote, Senators voted for the inclusion of an amendment axing the tax as part of a larger bill that would make deep cuts to stipulations in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf measures to eliminate the tax are unsuccessful, CFOs will have big decisions to make in the coming years regarding company benefit plans, and many companies will likely struggle to renegotiate union contracts. In some cases, companies are shifting to consumer-driven plans, or high-deductible plans that pass more costs and responsibility for their health-care choices to employees. The Kaiser Family Foundation in August estimated the tax will affect roughly a quarter of companies in its first year, nearly doubling over 10 years. That is because the costs of health care are generally expected to grow at quicker clip than will the penalty thresholds.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on December 4, 2015\n\nEU hits McDonalds with full-blown tax investigation\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-hits-mcdonalds-with-full-blown-tax-investigation-1449140943?mod=djemCFO_h\n\nEuropean Union regulators confirmed that they have opened a full-blown probe into McDonalds Corp.s tax affairs in Luxembourg, warning that a tax deal granted to the fast-food chain in 2009 may have reduced its tax burden in violation of EU law.\n\nThe 1031 Exchange Handbook -- A Complete Guide for Legal, Accounting, Financial and Real Estate Professionals\n\nSSRN, November 16, 2019, Posted again November 19, 2015\n\nhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690377\n\nAuthor\n\nAndrew G Ogden\n\nAbstract\n\nThe 1031 Exchange Handbook provides working professionals in law, accounting, finance and real estate with a practical guide and complete reference source to like-kind exchanges.

Since the beginning of globalization of business and services, human elements are becoming more important input for the success of every organization. The strong growth of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) encourages the consideration of alternative measurement and reporting standards and lends support to the possibility that future financial reports will include non-traditional measurements such as the value of human resources using HRA methods. It helps the management to frame policies for human resources of their organizations. HRA is a process of identifying and measuring data about human resources. It will help to charge human resource investment over a period of time. It is not a new concept in the arena of business world. Economists consider human capital as a production factor, and they explore different ways of measuring its investment. Now accountants are recognizing human resource investment as an asset. This study is build upon Recognition, Measurement and Accounting Treatment of Human Resource Accounting in different organizations.\n\nHistory Question\n\nWhat company was the first business firm to value human resources on its balance sheet?\n\nJensen Answer\n\nAlthough I'm not certain how professional sports teams accounted for player contracts before 1977, my research for an American Accounting Association monograph suggested that the RG Barry Corporation was the first company to value all of its human resources on the balance sheet. However, I could not find any value in this \"phantasmagoric\" valuation.\n\nPHANTASMAGORIC ACCOUNTING: Research and Analysis of Economic, Social and Environmental Impact of Corporate Business\n\n(Sarasota, FL: The American Accounting Association, 1977).\n\nDecember 1, 2015 reply from Elliot Kamlet\n\nThe idea of valuing Human Resources of a company has been intriguing to me since I was a student.of Bikki Jaggi (http://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty-research/directory/jaggi-bikki) who got together with a statistician at Binghamton (Lau) and came up with a model to value human resources. At the time, there was resistance to the math involved. See http://www.jstor.org/stable/245105?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\nDecember 2, 2015 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nHi Elliot,\n\nNot everything that can be counted, counts. And not everything that counts can be counted.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThe problems are numerous and complicated in terms of things other than the complicated math in human resource accounting. The biggest problem arises when there is no math whatsoever to make sense out of human resource accounting.\n\nFirstly, there's the problem of ownership and control. Most employment contracts do not prevent an employee from quitting immediately or in a very short period of time. Hence, you cannot own or lease an employee in the same way that we conceptualize owned or leased assets. Human resource accounting requires an entirely new conceptualization of the left side of the balance sheet.\n\nSecondly there's a problem of additivity where the value of individual employees varies interactively with other employees. The higher-order joint components of value are almost impossible to measure and may even become negative if it were possible to put measures of value on a work force.\n\nAs an illustration, consider Ivy League tenured faculty. It's not at all uncommon for some departments not to anticipate a tenure track opening for 10-20 years. This is problematic in terms of stagnation when there will be zero now new blood transfusing a department's stale faculty for 10-20 years. Every tenured faculty member is an asset. However, taken as a whole the tenured faculty in a department may become a liability.\n\nConsider the special problem now faced by Brown University. At one time over 90% of the assistant professors hired by Brown received tenure, thereby leading to many departments that expect no tenure track openings for many years. In 2015 Brown announced a very generous $100 million initiative to hire African American, Hispanic, and Native American faculty. But at Brown what this means is that a goodly portion of that $100 million will be used to buy out the tenure of white faculty to create tenure track positions for Brown's affirmative action hiring.\n\nIn other words in terms of human resource accounting positive value of individuals becomes a negative value when their values are combined.\n\nAlso \"value\" of a human resource has many contexts vis-à-vis value of a milling machine. With a human resource there's value in terms of routine assigned jobs plus positive and negative values of team contributions plus values of potential leadership promotions plus negative values of lawsuit risks. Milling machines do not sue for falls and slander and microaggressions, but employees sue for millions upon millions. Human resources also present unique fraud risks relative to physical assets.\n\nNot everything that can be counted, counts. And not everything that counts can be counted.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThanks,\n\nBob Jensen\n\nBob Jensen's threads on triple-bottom reporting, including human resource ac"
