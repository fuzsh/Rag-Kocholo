        "text": "THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT - A pointless remake can still turn out to be a quality film. Is this one of them? - August 20th, 2009\n\nRETURN - Linda Cardellini has been laying relatively low since her stint on ER, but, according to buzz surrounding this film's limited theatrical run, she's back with a vengeance. A strong supporting cast sure doesn't diminish my high expectations for this film either. - May 21st, 2012\n\n24 - SEASON 7 - Jack Bauer returns for the seventh worst day of his life, complete with terrorist attacks, double-crosses and personal vendettas. But after six previous seasons, does Day 7 manage to keep things fresh? - June 15th, 2009\n\n2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER - Jean-Luc Godard is smarter than the rest of us, but happily, he wants to share his toys. - July 20th, 2009\n\n3 SECONDS BEFORE EXPLOSION - Kino keeps bringing the Yakuza bon bons, and like a moth to the flame is your faithful reviewer drawn to these DVDs. - May 2nd, 2009\n\n3 WOMEN - Robert Altman's ruminative, moody vision all souped up in Criterion Blu-ray. - November 23rd, 2011\n\n4:44 LAST DAY ON EARTH (BLU-RAY) - Abel Ferrara hasn't made a great film in quite some time, but all signs point to this being a return to form for the director. The presence of the always-reliable Willem Dafoe certainly doesn't hurt. - July 28th, 2012\n\n8:46 - 11 years after 9/11, the horrors continue to linger. Films are still being made about this unforgettable tragedy, and this certainly sounds like one of the more memorable ones. - October 5th, 2012\n\nACROSS THE HALL - I've heard decent rumblings about this potentially twisty thriller, and the presence of Brittany Murphy doesn't exactly hurt its cause. - January 17th, 2010\n\nTHE ACTUALITY DRAMAS OF ALLAN KING (ECLIPSE SERIES 24) - This appears to be the ultimate box set for fans of documentary filmmaking, as the best of this Canadian director are on display thanks to The Criterion Collection. - April 13th, 2011\n\nADAM RESURRECTED (BLU-RAY) - This is yet another World War II filme concentrating on the Holocaust, but it's led by a powerful cast and director that give me high hopes for the project. - September 28th, 2009\n\nADRIFT - This highly-acclaimed Vietnamese film is an erotic drama that gives us an inside look at what life is like in present-day Hanoi. Hopefully it's as appealing as the image on the case's cover. - March 18th, 2012\n\nA GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY - This is a mean-spirited look at Star Wars that tries to be insightful but comes off as misguided and cruel. - May 2nd, 2009\n\nALICE'S HOUSE - I'm a sucker for internationally acclaimed, award-winning films, and, of course, having \"One of the year's 10 best!\" quoted on the cover doesn't hurt either. - March 15th, 2010\n\nALIEN RAIDERS - The title might make you assume the worst, but this low-budget horror trip is a solid little movie that's worth a glance. - April 20th, 2009\n\nALIEN TRESPASS (BLU-RAY) - This is a promising-looking homage to old-school sci-fi movies, with an interesting cast to boot. - September 7th, 2009\n\nAN AMERICAN IN PARIS (BLU-RAY) - It's hard to imagine a picture that features a ton of George Gershwin music, Gene Kelly dancing and striking Technicolor photography being messed up, but the grossly-overrated 1951 Oscar-winner for Best Picture certainly does what it can to be appalling, grating and tedious all at once. Dragged down by a moronic plot, lack of chemistry between the leads, excruciating casting, and shockingly poor integration of the music into the story, it's unfathomable how this movie retains its reputation.\n\n- April 15th, 2009\n\nANATOMY OF A MURDER - Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder is as entertaining as it is thoughtful about the limits of the law in grasping human nature. It feels fresh and mature even fifty years later, and stands as one of the best courtroom dramas in film history. - February 28th, 2012\n\nAPRES LUI - I will never pass up a chance to see the legendary Catherine Deneuve in action, as she only gets better with age. - August 9th, 2009\n\nARCTIC TALE (BLU-RAY) - If Ben Lyons thinks this is \"A Perfect Family Film\" then it simply has to be just that. Who can argue with the guy who thinks I AM LEGEND is one of the best movies of all-time? - April 16th, 2009\n\nAROUSED - This is a documentary about 16 porn stars...I don't need to say another word. - July 27th, 2013\n\nASTRON-6 COLLECTION - I'll admit to never having heard of Astron-6 before receiving this new DVD collection, but, with Troma responsible for this release, I'm sure we're all in for plenty of fun, insane depravity. - December 7th, 2011\n\nTHE ATTACK (BLU-RAY) - Critics have raved about this foreign drama for a while now, and it's nice to see it as yet another acclaimed film being distributed on Blu-ray from the Cohen Media Group. - January 23rd, 2014\n\nAUDIENCE OF ONE - A well-meaning pastor who has never made a movie, maybe not even seen very many, believes he is called by God to mount at $100 million production of a Christian Star Wars-ian epic. It goes about as well as you might expect. - August 27th, 2009\n\nAUSTRALIA - Baz Luhrmann's Australia is all spectacle, screaming \"epic movie\" from frantic opening montage to soaring, melodramatic finale. Overstuffed? Hokey? Sure. But never a dull moment even in this, the most restrained of the down under director's oeuvre (which is like saying it's the least garish neon shade). - May 12th, 2009\n\nTHE BANG BANG CLUB (BLU-RAY) - This certainly isn't the fist apartheid drama we've ever seen, but an interesting cast and decent film festival pedigree ramps up the optimism quite a bit. - January 13th, 2012\n\nBARDELYS THE MAGNIFICENT / MONTE CRISTO - The memory of silent screen star John Gilbert is not helped at all by the fact that so many of his pictures are no longer extant. But this new set from Flicker Alley helps correct that, with recently-discovered prints of two of Gilbert's major films, which happen to be the only ones of these films known to exist. We're very lucky indeed to have these long-hidden classics unearthed and brought to DVD in lovely restorations. - August 24th, 2009\n\nBARON BLOOD (BLU-RAY) - It's finally time to retire my old laserdisc copy of Mario Bava's return to gothic form, as this promises to be a wonderful Blu-ray edition from Kino Classics. - January 27th, 2013\n\nBASEBALL'S GREATEST GAMES: 1986 WORLD SERIES GAME 6 - The greatest night in all of human history. - November 22nd, 2011\n\nBASIL DEARDEN'S LONDON UNDERGROUND (ECLIPSE SERIES 25) - Even given some weaknesses, the four films of this collection are never less than competent and entertaining. In their own quiet ways, this neglected director may have to guide Britain through a tumultuous time into a more tolerant post-war world. - February 11th, 2011\n\nBASKET CASE 2 - This second installment of the adventures of everyone's favorite surgically separated conjoined twins takes the weirdness level up a few notches, to say the least. - January 1st, 2013\n\nBASKET CASE 3 - The further adventures of Duane and his malformed, formerly conjoined twin brother Belial stick in my memory as a case of director Frank Henenlotter going to the well one too many times. That opinion could change, given that it's been at least 15 years since I've seen this second sequel, but I have a bad feeling it won't. - November 1st, 2012\n\nBATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (BLU-RAY) - Many will question what an oft-abused silent film could possibly benefit from a high-def presentation. The answer is right here in this brilliant restoration of a brutal propaganda classic. - May 18th, 2010\n\nBELLE DE JOUR (BLU-RAY) - The ageless Catherine Deneuve gives one of her most remarkable performances in Luis Bunuel's surreal classic. I can't wait to see how great it looks on a Criterion Collection Blu-ray disc. - February 10th, 2012\n\nBIG STAN - This type of film is not for everybody. If you want a few bawdy and awful laughs, they can be found in Big Stan. Superior to a lot of films of its ilk, Rob Scheider and a great cast make a good effort to amuse you. - March 31st, 2009\n\nBITTER FEAST - Ok, so in most cases I'd run without looking back if I was faced with the prospect of watching a horror movie with famous chef Mario Batali in the cast. However, the word of mouth for this particular killer chef movie has been good enough to make the prospects of viewing this much better than expected. - July 1st, 2011\n\nBLACK MOON (CRITERION BLU-RAY) - The great Louis Malle's most fasinating, spellbinding film finally gets it's due via this wonderful Blu-ray release from The Crierion Collection. I can't wait to see what an amazing job they've done with this one. - July 7th, 2011\n\nBLACK NARCISSUS (BLU-RAY) - Conflicts of many kinds are present in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's Black Narcissus, set against the beauty and danger of the Himalayas. These include the shock of Anglo-Catholic nuns set in the midst of the mountains among natives who speak no English, the struggle between flesh and the spirit, between medicine and superstition, between vows and longing for a different life, and between the monied classes and the impoverished. The new Blu-ray Disc from The Criterion Collection brings a splendid film-like appearance to the ravishing visuals. - July 28th, 2010\n\nBLACK SHEEP (BLU-RAY) - While it's not Farley and Spade's best film, it's still great to revisit this duo in one of the few films they were able to team up for. - May 26th, 2009\n\nBREAKING GLASS - With a cover that screams Glam Rock-era David Bowie, this flick promises to be a real treat. Having only heard of this sparingly through the years, it's great that Olive Films have finally made it widely available for the music-loving masses. - September 1st, 2011\n\nBROADCAST NEWS - James L. Brooks demonstrates why his nonpareil touch with romantic comedy outlasts any medium, especially one as ephemeral as network—network!—news broadcasts. - April 25th, 2011\n\nTHE BROKEN TOWER - James Franco went right from a Best Actor Oscar nomination to the director's chair for this true story of Poet, Hart Crane. Here's hoping it's at least a little more engaging than his acting turn as Allen Ginsberg a few years ago. - March 24th, 2012\n\nBROOKLYN'S FINEST - On paper, this film has a lot going for it, including a strong ensemble cast. Unfortuntely, the reviews weren't stellar during its theatrical release, but critics have been wrong before. - August 10th, 2010\n\nBY BRAKHAGE: AN ANTHOLOGY VOLUMES ONE AND TWO (BLU-RAY) - It's so great that The Criterion Collection continues to release their standard definition releases on Blu-ray, and the decision to put all of their Stan Brakhage collection into one, amazing Blu-ray package is their best move yet. - May 25th, 2010\n\nCAMILLE - I'll pretty watch anything rising star James Franco is involved in these days, but there has to be a good reason that this sat on the shelf for so long. - September 13th, 2009\n\nCARGO 200 - There isn't exactly a ton of Russian black comedies to choose from these days, but this one looks pretty good. - April 29th, 2009\n\nTHE CELL 2 - Sure, the original was a great, original, semi-cult classic, but this direct-to-video effort just oozes failure. - June 14th, 2009\n\nCHANGING LANES - A nifty thriller begins as an allegorical look at road rage before sinking into a trite and unsatisfying final act. - June 2nd, 2009\n\nCHANTAL AKERMAN IN THE SEVENTIES - While she's responsible for some of the best foreign films of our time, this collection of works from the 1970's exposes us to Chantal Akerman's hidden treasures. - July 20th, 2010\n\nA CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS - Of all the releases of A Charlie Brown Christmas, this one's the Charlie Browniest. Of course. It is in HD. - October 13th, 2009\n\nCHARLIE MURPHY: I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE - Charlie Murphy enjoyed a huge rise in popularity thanks to collaborations with Dave Chappelle. Now, it'll be interesting to see what kind of stand-up material he has up his sleeve. - February 15th, 2010\n\nCHINA BEACH: THE COMPLETE SERIES - China Beach is an outstanding television show with great production, writing and acting. It is dramas like this that make the DVD format worthwhile. There is a delicious opportunity for those who didn't see it, hardly remember it or loved it to experience the show all over again. Highly recommended. - April 27th, 2013\n\nCITY ISLAND - Andy Garcia is mostly known for his dramatic roles, but here, he's trying his hand at light-hearted comedy. A strong supporting cast also bodes well for this being an above average indie film. - August 31st, 2010\n\nCLEANSKIN (BLU-RAY) - This is the film that Sean Bean fans have been waiting for, as they finally get to see him take on the action-packed role of a British Secret Service Agent...that isn't named James Bond. - October 7th, 2012\n\nTHE COMPANY MEN - Not even having won an Oscar can cushion the blow of the recession, apparently, according to John Wells' star-studded ensemble piece. - June 28th, 2011\n\nCONCRETE BLONDES - Amusing enough crime comedy with earnest performances and a competent production, Concrete Blondes is diverting enough for a look-see. - January 29th, 2014\n\nCRASH: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON - While not the best show on TV or DVD, Crash can be diverting and fun in a pulpy kind of way, like a decent detective novel. But, it seems like there should be more. - September 27th, 2009\n\nCSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION - THE FIRST SEASON - While nine years of crime scene investigation might be easy to take for granted, Paramount's Blu-ray release of the first year is a welcome reminder of the show's assured debut. - May 10th, 2009\n\nCUL-DE-SAC - Roman Polanski's triangle of menace and mayhem, with a killer new transfer. - December 1st, 2011\n\nDARE - On the surface, this appears to be a typical flick involving high school seniors discovering sex and the complexity of relationships. However, an interesting cast has me thinking positively about what the film has in store. - March 2nd, 2010\n\nDARK SHADOWS (BLU-RAY) - Despite a slew of bad reviews, I'm still excited to see what Tim Burton has in store for the great character of Barnabas Collins. At worst, it sure looks like Depp is having a blast with the role. - October 24th, 2012\n\nTHE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN - A triptych of coming-of-age stories from Iran. - September 30th, 2010\n\nDEAD SEASON - I'm not sure we need yet another zombie movie, but it looks like this latest installment in the genre wears its extremely low budget nature as a badge of honor, for better or worse. - October 26th, 2012\n\nTHE DECOY BRIDE (BLU-RAY) - Despite a fine cast, I have a bad feeling this is too full of romantic comedy cliches for my blood. I'm hoping I'm wrong. - July 24th, 2012\n\nDESIGNING WOMEN: THE FINAL SEASON - Designing Women, created by Linda-Bloodworth Thomason, was a very successful and unique situation comedy for its era with an almost completely female cast and a unique tone and perspective. Unfortunately most of the accolades pertained to the first five seasons of the show. Cast changes mixed up the chemistry of the show over its final two seasons and typically obtuse network decision making finalized its demise. - July 1st, 2012\n\nDETECTIVE BUREAU 2-3 GO TO HELL BASTARDS! - A dozen dead Yakuza and a Pepsi truck up in flames even before the credits roll. I am so in. - April 26th, 2009\n\nTHE DEVIL'S NEEDLE AND OTHER TALES OF VICE AND REDEMPTION (BLU-RAY) - None of these films is a masterpiece, nor are they in the best shape after almost a century of neglect. Nevertheless, they're extraordinary time capsules of a more liberal era. - August 7th, 2012\n\nDILLINGER IS DEAD - I'm honestly not familiar with this film going in, but the Criterion Collection stamp of approval alone has me chomping at the bit to dive in. - April 2nd, 2010\n\nDONALD GLOVER: WEIRDO - One of the stars of the hilarious NBC show Community, Glover is sure to be just as funny on the stand-up stage. It's nice that we finally have a DVD excuse to find out if this is, indeed, the case. - April 29th, 2012\n\nDON'T TOUCH THE WHITE WOMAN - French cinematic royalty has a go at America. Hilarity ensues. - August 17th, 2009\n\nDOUBLE TAKE - This unique blend of archival footage and \"new\" material promises to be one of the most unique film experiences to come along in quite some time. And in this era of very little originality, that's saying something. - February 22nd, 2011\n\nDOWNHILL RACER - Robert Redford and Criterion start getting us geared up for Vancouver 2010. - December 4th, 2009\n\nTHE DUELLISTS (BLU-RAY) - I'm not sure how this, Ridley Scott's first film, never made it onto my radar, but what better way to watch it for the first time than via this potentially excellent new Blu-ray disc from Shout Factory. - March 10th, 2013\n\nEASTBOUND & DOWN - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON - One of HBOs recent comedies, find out whether or not this continues their streak of winning shows, or if its the pits. - August 13th, 2009\n\nEASY VIRTUE - Noel Coward gets tarted up with fart jokes. I know, right? - September 15th, 2009\n\nEDDIE MURPHY: DELIRIOUS - Stand-up comedy doesn't get much better than this seminal classic. It'll be interesting to see what Anchor Bay has in store for this new DVD edition. - July 26th, 2009\n\nTHE EDGE OF LOVE - The Edge of Love: Or, The Edge of Sleep. - August 9th, 2009\n\nELENA - I'm always up for a good foreign thriller, and everything I've heard about this in the past year or so has my anticipation level near its highest point. - December 24th, 2012\n\nELSEWHERE - Apparently this flick made it into a handful of theaters unnoticed, earlier this year. The young cast and premise are at least somewhat intriguing. - May 31st, 2009\n\nELVIS: RETURN TO TUPELO - The King in his infancy. - November 16th, 2009\n\nEMBODIMENT OF EVIL (BLU-RAY) - Coffin Joe returns over 40 years since he last appeared on screen. Having this little-seen, low budget shocker on Blu-ray is a nice surprise courtesy of the always great Synapse Films. - May 17th, 2011\n\nENTOURAGE: THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON - Vince and the boys are back for more. Sure the show's formulaic, but each and every episode is still tons of fun. - July 3rd, 2009\n\nESCAPE (BLU-RAY) - This could just be the Norwegian, fantasy, Black Plague, action film that we've always been waiting for...or not. What I do know is the cover art couldn't possibly feature a closer look at the lead actor's face, and there are certainly quite a lot of arrows and knives involved. - June 2nd, 2013\n\n\"FACE TO FACE\" - While not the first of Ingmar Bergman' films to come to mind when discussing his directorial career, this Oscar-nominated classic is arguably as important and powerful as those considered his absolute best. - October 10th, 2011\n\nTHE FAMILY TREE (BLU-RAY) - Not sure what to expect from this indie dark comedy, but with a huge, talented (for the most part) ensemble cast, and a ridiculous-looking Dermot Mulroney, this promises to at least be interesting stuff. - December 22nd, 2011\n\nFATAL ATTRACTION (BLU-RAY) - It kind of stinks that this flick is best known for a boiling bunny, as it is still an effective thriller doubling as a cautionary tale for all men. - June 23rd, 2009\n\nFAT GIRL (CRITERION BLU-RAY) - Arguably Catherine Breillat's best work, this gripping, thought-provoking dramas might seem languid during some points. Rest assured that, despite this slowness, sticking around to the end is more than worth it. - June 10th, 2011\n\nFEAR AND DESIRE (BLU-RAY) - The legendary Stanley Kubrick's first feature film finally makes its way to Blu-ray, after being virtually unseen since it first showed up in theaters back in 1953. The fact that Kino has thrown in a documentary short by Kubrick as well, makes this realease one of the easier purchasing decisions of the year. - October 29th, 2012\n\nTHE FERNANDO ARRABAL COLLECTION 2 - It'll be difficult to top the first DVD collection featuring Arrabal's best-known cult classics, but Cult Epics second box set promises to deliver the goods once again. - April 3rd, 2010\n\nFERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (BLU-RAY) - Ah, the 80s classic finally makes its way to Blu-ray. I can't wait to see what Mia Sara looks like in HD! - May 25th, 2009\n\nFIGHTVILLE (BLU-RAY) - I am far from a fan of Mixed Martial Arts, but I do love a good documentary film, regardless of the subject. Good word of mouth has me thinking that this flick could be just that. - August 6th, 2012\n\nFOR ALL MANKIND (BLU-RAY) - Just in time for the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing, Criterion brings the lunar experience to us via Blu-ray. - July 5th, 2009\n\nFORBIDDEN HOLLYWOOD COLLECTION, VOLUME THREE - Six films' worth of pre-Code goodness, from the TCM Archives. - April 21st, 2009\n\nFOUR CHRISTMASES (BLU-RAY) - On paper (and in reviews surrounding its theatrical release), this movie is everything I hate about cookie-cutter, modern Hollywood comedies. Thankfully, the Christmas season has me willing to give it a chance. - December 4th, 2009\n\nFRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 - The body count continues on Blu-ray and I loved every second of it! - June 16th, 2009\n\nTHE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE - Sidestepping every convention of the gangster genre, this '70s gem deserves a second chance. - May 25th, 2009\n\nFUNNY OR DIE PRESENTS: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON - This hit HBO sketch show is generally hit-or-miss, but, fortunately, it's more the former than the latter. With the second season now airing, there's no better time than now to catch up. - February 15th, 2011\n\nGAUMONT TREASURES 1897-1913 - Although the Gaumont studio is not a household word in America, it was at the very forefront of motion pictures in the early years. This amazing set from Kino brings to home video over 100 seldom-seen movies from the dawn of cinema by three of the leading creators at Gaumont. One DVD each is devoted to the directors Alice Guy, Louis Feuillade and the little-remembered L�once Perret, giving the viewer a fascinating cross-section of these early silents, with some amazing treasures�would you believe color and sound movies in 1905? - October 27th, 2009\n\nTHE GENERAL (BLU-RAY) - There's a sense that Blu-ray is just an improvement for recenet effects-laden extravaganzas. Bucking that trend, Kino offers up the first Blu-ray presentation of a silent film in America (the British disc of Sunrise having beaten it to the punch. But can an 85-year old film hold up in the HD era? - November 14th, 2009\n\nTHE GHOST (AATMA) - What do you get when you take Exorcist-style goings-on and send them to Bollywood? Well, let's just say that dance numbers pop up in the strangest places. - May 3rd, 2009\n\nGHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST (BLU-RAY) - I long for the days of Matthew McConaughey in movies other than cheesy romantic comedies, but here's hoping this one is at least slightly better than most. - November 2nd, 2009\n\nGIGI (BLU-RAY) - After going my whole life without seeing this Best Picture Oscar winner, it took Warner's Blu-ray release for me to finally give it a chance. - January 12th, 2010\n\nTHE GIRL - Very little is said about this Swedish thriller on the DVD cover, but the ominous, creepy picture more than likely says a lot for what's in store here. Then again, given the ambiguity, I could be totally wrong. - February 7th, 2011\n\nTHE GIRLS NEXT DOOR: SEASON FIVE - It's hard to believe this is the fifth season chronicling Hef and his three blonde beauties, and they're just as appealing now (in more ways than one) as they were during the first season. - July 12th, 2009\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION - Three discs that demonstrate that on the little box, they still don't make 'em like they used to. - January 8th, 2010\n\nTHE GOLD RUSH (BLU-RAY) - I'm ashamed to say I'm never seen a movie either starring Charlie Chaplin or directed by him. What better way to finally break the seal on this cinema legend than with what many consider to be a comedic masterwork. - June 9th, 2012\n\nGRADIVA - It's nice to see a more recent film come from the always-fun Mondo Macabro, and I'm sure it offers more of the same disturbing stuff. - August 23rd, 2009\n\nGRAY'S ANATOMY (BLU-RAY) - I haven't seen this wonderful film since its first home video release, and I can't wait to relive that experience all over again. Steven Soderbergh has come a long way since, but this is still regarded as one of his best works. - July 8th, 2012\n\nTHE GREAT DICTATOR - Criterion spruces up Chaplin's first talking picture, an extended, impassioned, heartfelt kick in the ass of Adolf Hitler. - July 6th, 2011\n\nGREY GARDENS - You and the night and the music�the Beales and the Maysles get the narrative treatment. - July 27th, 2009\n\nHARVARD BEATS YALE 29-29 - H-A-Ahr, H-A-Ahr, H-A-Ahr, with a Vee!\n\nV-A-Ahr, V-A-Ahr, V-A-Ahr, with a Dee!\n\nHarvard. Harvard. Rah. Rah.\n\nHarvard men are really tough,\n\nThey know how to knit and stuff.\n\nKnit one, purl two, Harvard, yoo-hoo! - June 3rd, 2009\n\nA HAUNTING: THE 2012 SEASON - I haven't exactly heard great things about this show, and it seems awfully derivative of other supernatural reality series, but if it's even the least bit spooky, then I'm definitely on board. - May 5th, 2013\n\nHEADER - What's a header? You're going to have to delve into the absolutely nasty delights of this Ed Lee adaptation to find out. Of course, you could do one better and just read the book ... - June 11th, 2009\n\nHEARTLESS - A weird, engaging, criminally underseen import, this is a great vehicle for Jim Sturgess. There are plenty of shocking twists and turns that take this story to some extremely dark places. - May 16th, 2011\n\nTHE HEINEKEN KIDNAPPING (BLU-RAY) - Yes, folks, even seemingly ageless actors like Rutger Hauer get older, but he seems to be aging gracefully, leading up this fictionalized version of the most publicized abduction to ever occur in the Netherlands. - December 1st, 2012\n\nHEMPSTERS: PLANT THE SEED - The topic of marijuana legalization has never been more of a hot-button issue than it is today, and this documentary promises to delve into the subject down to its core. It'll be interesting to see just how politically driven the film turns out to be. - January 1st, 2013\n\nHENRI-GEORGES CLOUZOT'S INFERNO (Blu-ray) - Given that this film began shooting almost 50 years ago is intriguing enough. Flicker Alley has upped the ante by including a second disc of supplementary material that allows us to study this compelling project long after the film itself is over. - January 21st, 2012\n\nHE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU - From \"Sex in the City\" catchphrase to New York Times bestseller to a theater near you to DVD. A consideration. - June 30th, 2009\n\nHIGH AND LOW - Toshiro Mifune as a true master of the universe, in Akira Kurosawa's brutally taut crime story. On Blu-ray from our friends at Criterion, and it's never looked better. - August 11th, 2011\n\nTHE HILLS RUN RED - Maybe I'm just jaded, but I didn't find this overhyped horror flick to be as \"shocking\" or \"unsettling\" as suggested. That said, there's enough to appreciate to warrant a viewing. - October 7th, 2009\n\nHISTORY OF THE WORLD IN TWO HOURS - Though you may not learn anything that you didn't already know, this very brief history of the universe is lively and entertaining without being dumb. - April 4th, 2012\n\nA HOLLIS FRAMPTON ODYSSEY (BLU-RAY) - The Criterion Collection has gone the avant-garde short film route before, so I'm sure their collection of iconic American filmmaker Hollis Frampton's best works is sure to dazzle film fans on Blu-ray. - May 27th, 2012\n\nHOTEL FOR DOGS (BLU-RAY) - I'm reviewing this movie for two reasons: My kids' desire to see it and the cute Pug on the cover. Otherwise, I doubt even the great Don Cheadle can save it. - April 27th, 2009\n\nHOUSE (BLU-RAY) - I'd never heard of this flick until about a year ago, but since that first mention of it, the talk has been non-stop. Now, The Criterion Collection makes seeing this obscurity a reality, thanks to this potentially amazing Blu-ray disc. - October 21st, 2010\n\nHOUSE OF PLEASURES: - Heavily represented on 2011 \"Best Of\" lists, this French film promises to be both an erotic and visual treat, boasting one of the largest casts in recent memory. - April 14th, 2012\n\nHOW TO BE A WOMAN - Gentle reader, you have no idea how much I look forward to learning how to be a woman. - October 15th, 2009\n\nTHE HUMAN CONDITION - Watching, let alone, writing about a 9 1/2 hour Japanese film is a daunting task, but when that film is packaged together so nicely by The Criterion Collection, it instantly becomes a task that is a great pleasure to undertake. - January 12th, 2010\n\nHUNGER (BLU-RAY) - Having cought this disturbing masterpiece nearly a year ago, I can't wait to see what a wonderful treatment The Criterion Collection has granted it on Blu-ray. - February 14th, 2010\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN (Criterion Blu-ray) - This film, directed by the great Italian auteur, Michelangelo Antonioni, isn't as popular as his other classics. Now that it's on Blu-ray from Criterion, hopefully more cinema buffs will discover that this film deserves equal, if not more acclaim. - January 12th, 2012\n\nIF.... (Criterion Blu-ray) - Only a few years before Malcolm McDowell did a little film with Stanley Kubrick, he starred in this look at an anarchic society in Britain. Sure, we've seen movies set in boarding schools before, but this one is heralded as one of the best. - October 23rd, 2011\n\nIL DIVO - An epic telling of the life and times of one of Italy's most notorious politicians. - November 6th, 2009\n\nI LOVE YOU, MAN - No. I won't do it. I refuse to refer to this movie as a \"bromance.\" - August 12th, 2009\n\nIN A GLASS CAGE (BLU-RAY) - This cult classic is among the most notorious art house shockers ever made. Considered by some to push the envelope even more than the likes of Pasolini's Salo, there's no better time to check it out than now, thanks to this packed Blu-ray release. - November 14th, 2011\n\nINDECENT PROPOSAL (BLU-RAY) - Even 16 years after it hit theaters, the moral question at this film's core is the ultimate conversation starter for couples everywhere. - June 16th, 2009\n\nIN HELL - Van Damme finds himself wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife. All the more shocking, Paul W.S. Anderson seems to have stolen large chunks of this for his crappy Death Race remake. - April 14th, 2009\n\nINSIGNIFICANCE (Criterion Blu-ray) - It's always great to see a Nicolas Roeg film for the first time, but it's even better when it stars Theresa Russell and is contained on a Criterion Collection Blu-ray disc. - July 21st, 2011\n\nIN THE ELECTRIC MIST (BLU-RAY) - Tommy Lee Jones plays a law enforcement official on the trail of a murderer, that must overcome numerous obstacles along the way. Tell me if you've heard that one before... - April 13th, 2009\n\nIN THE MOOD FOR LOVE (BLU-RAY) - The great Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece was given the proper Criterion Collection treatment on DVD a few years ago, and is one of their banner releases. It now shows up on a Criterion Blu-ray disc, and I'd be shocked if it wasn't even more special than the first time. - November 24th, 2012\n\nIN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (BLU-RAY) - How fine is the line between \"Art House Classic\" and \"Japanese Porn?\" The Criterion Collection's new In the Realm of the Senses Blu-ray gives me no choice but to answer that question. For some reason, I'm really looking forward to finding the answer to that question. - April 27th, 2009\n\nINTO THE ABYSS: - The great Werner Herzog is at it again, this time giving us a heralded documentary about one of our more controversial subject, the death penalty. - April 22nd, 2012\n\nISLAND OF LOST SOULS (Criterion Blu-ray) - This classic take on H.G. Wells's book, The Island of Dr. Moreau should make it easy to forget the more recent Val Kilmer/Marlon Brando adaptation of the same story, and then some. - November 21st, 2011\n\nJACKBOOTS ON WHITEHALL - Really, all there is to know about this going in is that it's a British political satire that uses puppets to tell it's story. Eat your heart out, Matt Stone and Trey Parker! - August 12th, 2011\n\nJACK REACHER - Suffers from a multitude of problems including lack of charisma and drama. Tom Cruise is not a good fit in the Salvation Army clothes of military cop turned heroic drifter, Jack Reacher. Rental only and you really might as well wait for it be on TBS. - June 1st, 2013\n\nJIM JEFFERIES: I SWEAR TO GOD - I've never heard of comedian Jim Jefferies, let alone seen any of his act, but this title's cover art and description scares the crap out of me...in a bad way. - October 12th, 2009\n\nJOURNEY INTO AMAZING CAVES (BLU-RAY) - Blu-Ray cave exploring sounds better than actually doing it in real-life.\n\nHighly recommended. - May 10th, 2009\n\nJUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY - With high recommendations by Film Comment and Film Threat, I'm really looking forward to watching this Danish thriller. - May 15th, 2009\n\nKAGEMUSHA (BLU-RAY) - Yet another of the master's amazing films sees the light of day on Blu-ray via The Criterion Collection. Keep 'em coming, Criterion! - August 16th, 2009\n\nKATT WILLIAMS: KATTPACALYPSE - Kattapacalypse is pretty funny, but ultimately unsatisfying and not worthy of multiple viewings. Katt Williams is a funny dude but his material here is choppy and disjointed. He comes onto the stage like a lion abut by the end is laying down with the lambs. - October 6th, 2012\n\nKES (CRITERION BLU-RAY) - The great British filmmaker Ken Loach sees one of his best films come to Blu-ray courtesy of Criterion. This uniquest of the now-tired coming-of-age films is a truly unforgettable masterpiece. - June 18th, 2011\n\nKISS ME DEADLY - How can you not love a movie that starts with a psycho, speechless Cloris Leachman, and ends with the prospect of nuclear armageddon? - June 23rd, 2011\n\nTHE LADY (BLU-RAY) - On the surface, it's difficult to believe that this is a Luc Besson film. I've repeatedly read over the cover and the booklet inside, and I still don't see anything that suggests Besson's involvement. This mystery, alone, makes this a must-see in my book. - October 5th, 2013\n\nTHE LAST KISS (BLU-RAY) - This is a fun, thought-provoking comedy since I haven't seen since its 2006 theatrical release date, and this new Blu-ray enhances an already solid film. - April 16th, 2009\n\nLAST OF THE LIVING - The number of zombie movies continues to multiply exponentially, and this latest one looks a little shady at best. - November 11th, 2009\n\nTHE LAST WORD - For some reason, I still look forward to seeing anything Winona Ryder is in. Actually, I think a picture like the one of her on this DVD case is reason enough. - April 21st, 2009\n\nLAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD - Debate the merits of the confounding film all you want, but there's no arguing the fact that this Blu-ray offers one of the most beautiful black-and-white transfers ever produced. - July 5th, 2009\n\nLAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD - A profound exploration of the human condition? Or simply a movie designed to make you feel stupid? - June 25th, 2009\n\nL'ENFANCE NUE - One of the great films from French director Maurice Pialat makes its DVD debut courtesy of The Criterion Collection, and it sure looks like a disc that's more than worth owning. - October 5th, 2010\n\nLIE TO ME: SEASON ONE - The first season of this new show wouldn't be what it is without great work by Tim Roth, and now that it's out on DVD, I'm looking forward to delve deeper into the storyline. - September 21st, 2009\n\nLIFE DURING WARTIME (Criterion Blu-ray) - This brilliant follow-up to Solondz's masterpiece, Happiness is nearly half the running time of that film, but packs just as much punch. Plus, it sure doesn't hurt that it's being released by the Criterion Collection. - August 25th, 2011\n\nLITTLE BRITAIN USA - The wildly rude humor of Little Britain makes its way to the USA. Not much is lost in translation, as no one is safe from their skewers. - April 16th, 2009\n\nLIZ & DICK - Exploitive much? Lindsey Lohan brings her tabloid gravitas to a movie picking over the bones of the woman, whose life was the material of tabloid legend. Not very good as a biography, not very good as a movie, this film careens from cringeworthy to boring. For Lohan completists only (or maybe Grant Bowler fans). - May 5th, 2013\n\nTHE LONELIEST PLANET - This film made it on numerous Best of 2012 lists, and deservedly so, as it is a quiet, thought-provoking masterpiece. The only crime is that it there are no plans for a U.S. Blu-ray release. - April 17th, 2013\n\nLOONEY TUNES SUPER STARS: DAFFY DUCK FRUSTRATED FOWL - You simply can never go wrong with anything Looney Tunes-related, so this is sure to be another excellent DVD collection of cartoon classics. - October 13th, 2010\n\nTHE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY (BLU-RAY) - Peter Jackson's towering achievement is one of those you-love-it-or-you-hate-it pictures; few viewers are indifferent. But into which category will the Blu-ray disc version of the original theatrical releases of the trilogy fall? - March 30th, 2010\n\nLOS BASTARDOS - This 2008 Cannes Film Festival award winner seemingly has much more than a cool title going for it. - July 2nd, 2009\n\nLOST KEATON - Fans of Buster Keaton can rejoice, for Kino has brought to DVD all 16 of the rarely-seen short films Buster Keaton made for Educational Pictures in the mid-1930s. Despite the studio's name, there's nothing educational here, except lessons in comedy timing from the Great Stone Face himself. - August 5th, 2010\n\nLOUIE BLUIE - The Criterion Collection comes through again and offers us an obscure documentary from acclaimed director Terry Zwigoff. This is really going to appeal to fans of both Zwigoff and jazz. - October 7th, 2011\n\nLOUIS ARMSTRONG: GOOD EVENING, EV'RYBODY - Louis Armstrong and some of his best pals celebrate his 70th birthday at the Newport Jazz Festival. We'll save you a piece of cake! - February 17th, 2010\n\nTHE MACHINIST (BLU-RAY) - This amazing film finally gets the Blu-ray treatment, and I can't wait to see how it takes advantage of the format. - May 31st, 2009\n\nTHE MAGICIAN (BLU-RAY) - Another of the great Ingmar Bergman's classics makes its way to Blu-ray, and it primarily needs to be seen for Max von Sydow's wonderful performance. The Criterion Collection offers it in the best way possible, with amazing extras to boot. - November 20th, 2010\n\nMARLENE - Up close and personal with one of the great temptresses in the history of the big screen. - September 21st, 2009\n\nMEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY - This one's been on my radar for some time now, if only to see how Daily Show correspondent Wyatt Cenac handles serious acting. - October 25th, 2009\n\nTHE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS - Let us remember the forgotten victims of the war in Iraq: the livestock. - April 5th, 2010\n\nMOMMA'S MAN - I really don't know what to think about a title like this. I saw it on a few 2008 Top 10 Lists though, so I'm hoping for the best. - May 5th, 2009\n\nMONSOON WEDDING - Even as some grumble that Criterion should focus on bringing lost classics to DVD, it's tough to argue that the underappreciated Monsoon Wedding hasn't benefitted from the company's topflight treatment. - October 13th, 2009\n\nTHE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA - Wear your presence on Richard Nixon's enemies list as a badge of honor. - September 2nd, 2010\n\nTHE MOTH DIARIES (BLU-RAY) - Director Mary Harron is best known for bringing the character of Patrick Bateman to life on the big screen, but we'll see if she can work similar magic with an ensemble of young, attractive, female actors here. - August 26th, 2012\n\nMY DINNER WITH ANDR� - Criterion goes whole hog for this landmark two-hander. - July 10th, 2009\n\nTHE NAKED KISS - Samuel Fuller's riotously overwrought, madly influential opus, in glorious Blu-ray. - March 15th, 2011\n\nNEIL YOUNG JOURNEYS (BLU-RAY) - Director Jonathan Demme took a great Talking Heads concert and made it better. Now, he chronicles a unique journey home for Neil Young, and likely, takes this to another level as well. - November 10th, 2012\n\nTHE NEW DAUGHTER - Kevin Costner's been out of the Hollywood limelight for a few years now, but this new, basically direct-to-DVD feature has the feeling of a desperate attempt to recharge his acting career. - May 17th, 2010\n\nTHE NEW YORK RIPPER - Italian exploitation master took a step away from the supernatural for this rather standard (relatively speaking) serial killer flick. He didn't, however, tone down on the sex, violence, and, most importantly, gore. - August 26th, 2011\n\nNIGHT COURT: THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON - Thanks to Warner Home Video, I'm pumped to revisit Season 4 of my favorite sit com of the 80's. There's still nothing in the way of extra features here, but having each and every episode is good enough. - November 9th, 2010\n\nNIGHTS IN RODANTHE - Don't let the presence of Richard Gere and Diane Lane fool you, this is a dull and manipulative drama that falls woefully short of its potential. - May 4th, 2009\n\nNIGHTS AND WEEKENDS - Nights and Weekends is another step forward for the rising Swanberg, who continues to develop his style. The often-improvised script and truly �fly on the wall� shooting style bring added weight to the drama. - August 23rd, 2009\n\nNIGHT TRAIN - Despite the presence of Danny Glover and Steve Zahn in the cast, the real appeal here, for me, is Leelee Sobieski...and it's not for her acting talents. - July 6th, 2009\n\nNIKKATSU NOIR - A fistful of Japanese crime pictures, in a super groovy pink and black case, from Criterion. Rock on. - September 7th, 2009\n\nNIP/TUCK: SEASON FIVE, PART TWO - The last eight episodes of Season 5 of one of the best shows on TV make their way to DVD just in time for the Season 6 premiere...office visits to McNamara/Troy have never been better. - October 7th, 2009\n\nNORMAN MAILER: THE AMERICAN - This is an often unpleasant tale of a celebrated writer that is told frankly and openly by people who knew him personally. Director Joe Mantegna weaves their commentary into a visual history of the latter half of the last century and evokes an intriguing portrait of one its most important chroniclers. Norman Mailer: The American gives a multi-faceted answer to the question: who was that guy? - May 19th, 2012\n\nONE TREE HILL: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON - Love it or hate it, the show is increasing in popularity. There is a big risk to its continuance with the significant cast changes in store for the next season. The DVD provides the nice \"soap-opera-on-disc\" continuity that allows the viewer to blend the episodes together and find new levels of continuity that are not available in the weekly, commercial interrupted versions. - August 22nd, 2009\n\nTHE ONLY SON / THERE WAS A FATHER - Two early works from one of the masters, Yasujiro Ozu. - September 8th, 2010\n\nOSHIMA'S OUTLAW SIXTIES (ECLIPSE SERIES 21) - Criterion does a fine enough job bringing world-class cinema to the masses, but their Eclipse Series continues to be a great way to discover those foreign filmmakers that might otherwise go unnoticed, Nagisa Oshima included. - May 30th, 2010\n\nPAPER COVERS ROCK - This has all the makings of a rough, emotionally tough drama, powered by a strong performance by Jeannine Kaspar. This is really going to be moving stuff. - June 18th, 2010\n\nPATRICK - Revisiting films like Patrick makes me yearn for the days of 70s horror. They just built �em differently back then. True, this won�t win any awards for being the most rollicking genre film ever made, but if you like dollops of atmosphere with your horror, than this is as good a thriller as any. Director Richard Franklin takes what probably looked like a Carrie rip-off on paper and creates a quietly riveting � and spooky - slow burn. The kind of horror film that sneaks up on you and, if you�ll indulge me for one quick second, that they just don�t make anymore. - April 13th, 2009\n\nTHE PATTY DUKE SHOW: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON - In its last year, The Patty Duke Show remains charming and well-written, a cut above the standard sixties-style family sitcom. - October 13th, 2010\n\nPEANUTS 1960's COLLECTION - The umpteenth repackaging of the popular Peanuts TV specials includes a few that are new to DVD and a great documentary on composer Vince Guaraldi. - July 5th, 2009\n\nPERFECT SENSE (BLU-RAY) - This wonderful, emotionally balanced film was criminally ignored during it's brief, extremely limited theatrical run. There's no excuse to miss it on Blu-ray though, as the leads are fantastic and the story is beyond compelling. - June 28th, 2012\n\nPIERROT LE FOU - The strength of Criterion's previous release of Godard's pulp crime masterpiece makes the decision to upgrade to Blu-ray a tough one—until you see the image transfer, that is, and head to eBay to sell your old copy. - October 5th, 2009\n\nPLASTIC MAN: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION - Finally, this wonderful animated series that I grew up on is now available on DVD! Having every episode in one, comprehensive collection only adds to this release's appeal. - January 11th, 2010\n\nPRISON BREAK: THE FINAL BREAK (BLU-RAY) - This is pretty much a no-brainer for Prison Break fans, as it's a feature-length movie that fills in some gaps from the recently-ended series. - November 3rd, 2009\n\nMARQUIS DE SADE'S PROSPERITIES OF VICE - Mondo Macabro does it again, taking us back to 1920's Japan and a count's obsession with the Marquis de Sade. In a word...awesome! - March 31st, 2010\n\nA QUIET LITTLE MARRIAGE - This multiple festival award-winner has brilliant little indie flick written all over it. Those who have seen it, love it, so I can't wait to give it a look. - September 15th, 2010\n\nTHE REAL CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST - If you thought the infamous Cannibal Holocaust was tough to sit through, then One 7 Movies looks to take such disgust to a whole other level. - June 13th, 2011\n\nRED DESERT (BLU-RAY) - This classic film from legendary filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni gets the royal Criterion Collection treatment it deserves, and is wonderfully restored on this Blu-ray disc. - September 10th, 2010\n\nREPULSION - More early-career Polanski creepiness, from our friends at Criterion. - July 29th, 2009\n\nRESURRECT DEAD: THE MYSTERY OF THE TOYNBEE TILES - A truly intriguing subject will hopefully translate into a documentary that is just as compelling. The inclusion of Stanley Kubrick's name on the DVD cover only adds to the anticipation. - February 5th, 2012\n\nRICKY - The great Franzois Ozon is at it again with this mysterious film. I've heard it's best to not know anything about this movie going in, and here's hoping the payoff lives up to the hype. - April 25th, 2011\n\nRICKY GERVAIS: OUT OF ENGLAND - Oh, Ricky, you're so fine. - April 3rd, 2009\n\nRIPPED OFF: MADOFF AND THE SCAMMING OF AMERICA - Bernie Madoff: Bad for the Jews? A consideration. - July 22nd, 2009\n\nROMAN POLANSKI: WANTED AND DESIRED - One need not excuse or minimize what happened between Roman Polanski and a 13-year-old girl in Jack Nicholson's pool in 1977 to recognize that Polanski has led an extraordinarily complicated and morally challenging life. He escaped the Third Reich; his wife, 8 1/2 months pregnant with their first child, was brutally slaughtered by disciples of Charles Manson; he's had enough sorrow for a handful of lives, though that doesn't make it all right for his Humbert Humbert streak, thanking heaven for little girls. This fair-minded and gripping documentary is an extraordinarily thorough look at what happened to Polanski in Southern California in the late 1970s, both in a Santa Monica courtroom and in the court of public opinion. It's a morality play with all sort of shades of gray, and it's a fascinating watch. - February 15th, 2009\n\nROSETTA (BLU-RAY) - It's great to see The Criterion Collection continue to release relatively obscure foreign films like this, regardless of their box office numbers. It would be a shock if this wasn't yet another one of their excellent Blu-ray efforts. - September 3rd, 2012\n\nROBERTO ROSSELLINI'S WAR TRILOGY - Criterion's great big box of Neorealism. - February 24th, 2010\n\nRUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY - Russell Brand was great in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but can he deliver the goods in his own stand-up comedy special? - May 24th, 2009\n\nSATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS 1960S VOLUME 1 - A nostalgic set of cartoon fun from the 1960s, one can find a lot entertainment in these old-school cartoons starring The Flintstones, QuickDraw McGraw, Space Ghost, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck and more. - July 1st, 2009\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT FEVER - Great music, great movie. - May 10th, 2009\n\nSECRET SUNSHINE (Criterion Blu-ray) - This drama promises to be yet another example of just how great Korean cinema is. Venerable director Lee Chang-dong is one of Korea's best filmmakers, and with actress Jeon Do-yeon leading the way, this has to be great. - September 10th, 2011\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL - \"I've been to Atlantic City a hundred times, I've never seen Death walking on the beach.\"—Steve Guttenberg in Diner - June 22nd, 2009\n\nSHOCK CORRIDOR - Samuel Fuller has no use for understatement or subtlety, especially when he encamps to the insane asylum. - March 25th, 2011\n\nSHOCK LABYRINTH 3D (BLU-RAY) - I'm more than willing to take a look at anything from the maker of The Grudge, director Takashi Shimizu. From the sounds of reviews for this, his latest flick, my stance on Shimizu could, unfortunately, change pretty fast. - May 25th, 2012\n\nSMALLVILLE: THE COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON - Smallville. Season eight. Yeah, I'm as shocked as you are. More so that the show seems to have improved somewhat despite the departure of about half the original cast. - September 10th, 2009\n\nTHE SOLOIST (BLU-RAY) - Am I the only one that thinks Jamie Foxx just looks plain scary in this movie? See for yourself, I'm sure you'll agree. - August 2nd, 2009\n\nSOME GUY WHO KILLS PEOPLE - Despite a horrendous title, and cheesy-looking DVD cover art, a quick read of the plot synopsis and interesting casting has me chomping at the bit to give this flick a look. - July 15th, 2012\n\nSOMETHING WILD - A quarter century has done nothing to dim the many charms of arguably Jonathan Demme's best movie. Now looking more choice than ever, on Criterion Blu-ray. - June 16th, 2011\n\nSON OF MORNING - This is an intriguing premise, but I have a bad feeling that overdone attempts at quirkiness might be the film's downfall. However, the casting is intriguing, to say the least. - January 15th, 2012\n\nSOUL KITCHEN - Fatih Akin has yet to stumble as a director, and I'd be shocked if this was his first misfire. A powerful cast and compelling story should make this another unforgettable gem. - August 18th, 2012\n\nSPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND - The story of Spartacus has been told many times for many reasons. This newest version, Spartacus: Blood and Sand which first aired on STARZ, is a potent mix of violence, sex and intrigue. A high-powered cast, innovative technology and solid writing has wired together one of the most entertaining historical action series ever. - September 19th, 2010\n\nTHE SPY NEXT DOOR (BLU-RAY) - A family movie starring Jackie Chan is sure to be as harmless as it gets, but hopefully it's just as enjoyable for the adults in the family as it is for the youngsters. - July 31st, 2010\n\nSQUIDBILLIES: VOLUME FIVE - I'm a huge fan of a handful of Adult Swim shows, but this is one I've yet to see even a single episode of. What better excuse to finally do so than via Warner's fifth DVD collection. - September 14th, 2012\n\nSTAGECOACH - One of the great ones, the first John Wayne/John Ford collaboration gets the top-of-the-line Criterion treatment. - May 21st, 2010\n\nSTEAMBOAT BILL, JR. - Two swell cuts of one of Buster Keaton's greatest. - August 30th, 2010\n\nTHE STEPFATHER - This one's a lot more than just another 80s slasher movie. - October 12th, 2009\n\nSTEPFATHER II - It's easy to dismiss a sequel as being more of the same, and this one certainly is that. It's also surprisingly well-made and entertaining. - September 29th, 2009\n\n3 SILENT CLASSICS BY JOSEF VON STERNBERG - A Criterion box set of silent goodness. - October 20th, 2010\n\nSTORAGE WARS: SEASON ONE - The first season of one of the hottest and most imitated shows on cable finally makes its way to DVD. What could possibly be lurking in that box in this abandoned storage locker? Who doesn't love a treasure hunt? - August 30th, 2011\n\nTHE SUN - This is yet another study of a famous dictator by the brilliant director of Russian Ark, so I'm expecting the praise that's been heaped upon the film over the years to be warranted. - June 8th, 2010\n\nSUNSET BOULEVARD - An indelible piece of pop culture. The greatest movie ever made about movies. Maybe even the greatest movie ever made, full stop. On a sweet new Blu-ray. - November 26th, 2012\n\nSWAMP THING (BLU-RAY) - This was one of my favorite childhood movies, and it's still held up as a go-to flick for me through the years. It's been a while since I've seen it, however, so here's hoping I enjoy it just as much today. - September 7th, 2013\n\nTHE SWEENEY (BLU-RAY) - A great group of actors are on board for this story of a London crime fighting force that promises plenty of action. Here's hoping the story behind the special effects and stuntwork is equally as engaging. - July 26th, 2013\n\nTABLOID - Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Errol Morris and the Interratron on a juicy, sexy scandal from back in the day! - December 7th, 2011\n\nTAKE OUT - Sometimes a positive quote by a reviewer on the front of a DVD case is enough to instantly grab my attention, and I'm hoping this more than lives up to such praise. - August 30th, 2009\n\nTEMPEST - The fall of the Tsars has proven to be fertile ground for filmic drama, but one of the earlier of these efforts was John Barrymore's Tempest, produced only a decade after the events depicted. With a story written by a Russian, and a screenplay co-written by an uncredited Erich von Stroheim, it certainly promises to be interesting. - July 5th, 2009\n\nTETSUO: THE BULLET MAN - Following the original Tetsuo film was a tall-enough order, but this is the third entry and here's hoping we're in store for more of the same bizarre, machine-centric madness. - August 2nd, 2011\n\nTHE BUCKET LIST - Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson decide to do a bunch of things before they die while Rob Reiner directs them.\n\nFreeman and Nicholson save this from being pure schmaltz, and beneath it all the message carries some real substance. - June 6th, 2009\n\nTHE MAGIC OF FLIGHT (BLU-RAY) - A Blu-Ray disc on the \"magic of flight\" should probably include a free barf bag. This one, however, does not. - May 10th, 2009\n\nTHIRTYSOMETHING: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON - Here's a fun game: Try to watch the debut season of thirtysomething all the way through without saying any of the following:\n\nA) Nice hair clip, Nancy.\n\nB) Why does her coat have numbers all over it?\n\nC) Shut up, Hope.\n\nI lost. - August 26th, 2009\n\nTHOU SHALT NOT KILL...EXCEPT (BLU-RAY) - I tried to watch this movie 10 years or so ago and simply couldn't get through it. Now, with Synapse responsible for this new Blu-ray treatment I'm more than willing to give the film another shot. - May 5th, 2012\n\nTHE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK - The landmark documentary about one of the human rights pioneers of the last century, in a thorough and completely absorbing Criterion package. - May 28th, 2011\n\nTITANIC (BLU-RAY) - We all know the story, and a whole heck of a lot of us saw the movie 15 years ago, but, unless you caught it earlier this year in theaters, you've never see a giant ship in 3D before. Well, folks, now's your chance! - October 4th, 2012\n\nTITANIC: THE COMPLETE STORY - In this anniversary year, there has been more than the normal amount of material about Titanic in popular culture including a new mini-series and a re-release of James Cameron's popular Titanic film remastered in 3D. Titanic: The Complete Story is a fine dvd set and for those who have dreamt of and wondered about this ship. They will enjoy learning just a little bit more of this doomed journey and the people who you never get to hear about that died that fated night on April 15th one hundred years ago. - May 7th, 2012\n\nTO CATCH A THIEF (BLU-RAY) - The latest in the recent wave of Alfred Hitchcock films to hit Blu-ray, this one simply has to be seen for the pairing of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly alone. - March 29th, 2012\n\nTOM AND JERRY: THE CHUCK JONES COLLECTION - Although these cartoons are available in other DVD collections, it's nice to have them all in one nice package. - June 23rd, 2009\n\nTONY MANERO - This flick promises an extremely interesting premise to say the least. Here's hoping it is, indeed, as compelling as it sounds. - May 11th, 2010\n\nTHE TREE THAT REMEMBERS - A documentary look at the continuing cross-continental psychological impact of political upheaval in Iran. - April 15th, 2010\n\nTHE TROUBLE WITH TOLSTOY - A challenging travelogue walks in the footsteps of Russia's biggest troublemaker. - May 8th, 2012\n\nTRUE BLOOD: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON - Six Feet Under creator Alan Ball stretches metaphor to the breaking point with HBO's True Blood, which posits that a world in which vampires \"come out of the coffin\" and fight for their civil rights would look a lot like Twilight, only with lots more nudity. Lots and lots more nudity. - May 24th, 2009\n\nUNE FEMME MARIEE - Long out of print, Koch Lorber brings one of Godard's lost films to American audiences with a barebones, but solid, release. - June 2nd, 2009\n\nTHE UNINVITED (BLU-RAY) - Rehashes of Asian horror movies are becoming commonplace, but given the right treatment, they can be effective. Case in point: this American reworking of the Korean picture A Tale of Two Sisters, which manages to keep a lot of the creepy atmosphere of the original while successfully dumbing it down for us Yanks. A brisk pace and a brief running time help keep it from wearing out its welcome. - April 21st, 2009\n\nUNION STATION - Los Angeles noiry goodness at the train station downtown. - August 11th, 2010\n\nVIPS - Everybody loves a good con, as long as they aren't the victim of it. This is the true tale of the most notorious con men to come out of Brazil...or I could be trying to pull a fast one on you. - February 25th, 2012\n\nVIRGINIA - Academy Award Winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black takes his first crack at directing a feature film here. Here's hoping a great ensemble cast and interesting subject matter makes this a compelling debut. - August 26th, 2012\n\nVISIONS OF ECSTASY - This short, experimental film has been tough to get a hold of for years, thanks, in large part, to it being banned in the UK. Now that such a ban has been lifted, we can see for ourselves what the fuss was all about. - December 12th, 2012\n\nVIVRE SA VIE (BLU-RAY) - Another of Godard's materworks, this particular film is a wonderful showcase of Anna Karina's unforgettble acting talents...that Criterion's offering this Blu-ray version is an added bonus. - May 1st, 2010\n\nTHE WAGES OF FEAR (BLU-RAY) - South America. Four desperate men. A truck full of nitrogylcerine. A raw, white-knuckle thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot gets the Blu-Ray treatment from Criterion, in what is easily one of 2009's best releases. - April 21st, 2009\n\nWAR OF THE DEAD (BLU-RAY) - This sure seems like an interesting, shockingly original take on the soon-to-be-tired zombie film, but my gut tells me that there won't be much here to like. - January 13th, 2013\n\nWAYNE'S WORLD 2 - In a stunning display of the amount of thought Paramount put into the production of Wayne's World 2 on Blu-ray, the back cover refers to it as \"the most awaited video\" since Wayne's World, marketing copy you might remember from when the movie was released 15 years ago... on video. - June 14th, 2009\n\nWAYNE'S WORLD - The real question is, do you really need to own a low-budget comedy like Wayne's World in HD? The answer is, yes, if only for the opportunity to study the weird after effects of Mike Meyers apparently out-of-control eyebrow tweezing habit. - June 6th, 2009\n\nWE FUN: ATLANTA GA INSIDE/OUT - As a huge fan of indie rock, I'm really looking forward to this look at the Atlanta music scene, and the promise of a Deerhunter appearance, makes this all the more appealing. - July 26th, 2010\n\nWHATEVER WORKS - I'll take curmudgeonly late-middle-age New York comedians for $800, please, Alex. - November 9th, 2009\n\nTHE WILD MAN OF THE NAVIDAD - The artwork and description of this awesomely-titled flick has this old-school horror fan more than ready to pop this DVD in the player. - August 9th, 2009\n\nWINGS OF DESIRE - Another excellent Blu-ray from Criterion, and for one of the best films of the 1980s to boot. An essential upgrade. - November 1st, 2009\n\nWISE BLOOD - Miss O'Connor, Mr. Huston. Mr. Huston, Miss O'Connor. Now you zany kids go make a movie that's batcrap crazy. - May 13th, 2009\n\nWORLD ON A WIRE (BLU-RAY) - This is one of those classics of foreign cinema that I've known about since I was a kid, but have never actually seen. What better way to experience all 3-plus hours of this masterpiece for the first time than via a Criterion Collection Blu-ray. - March 9th, 2012\n\nWORRIED ABOUT THE BOY - While I'm not sure the masses were clamoring for a biopic about the infamous lead singer of 80s Pop group Culture Club, this flick promises to tell us everything we ever wanted to know about Boy George, and then some. - June 17th, 2012\n\nWWII IN 3D (BLU-RAY) - It's hard to believe that a ton of information about a huge era in U.S. History can be crammed into a 46-minute documentary, but I have a feeling that this disc is all about the spectacle of 3D technology. - February 6th, 2012\n\nTHE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS (BLU-RAY) - The holiday season is right around the corner, and what better way to kick them off then an animated classic...and on Blu-ray no less. - November 30th, 2010\n\nYES MAN (BLU-RAY) - Jim Carrey is back and very nearly in full, legendary comedic form with Yes Man. This romantic comedy riff on self-help gurus smartly avoids the huge mistakes that the similar-themed The Love Guru made, and Carrey exhibits the comedic timing that he often showcased during his heyday. Warner's Blu-ray is a great disc, complete with wonderful extras, including some HD exclusives. - April 12th, 2009\n\nZ - Costa-Gavras' epic tale of political intrigue and violence gets the Criterion treatment. - October 22nd, 2009\n\nMLB Superstars Show You Their Game - June 20th, 2005\n\nThe Truman Show (Blu-ray) - January 5th, 2009\n\nBeowulf Director's Cut HD-DVD - February 25th, 2008\n\n10,000 BC - June 23rd, 2008\n\n10,000 Maniacs: Time Capsule (1982-1993) - July 20th, 2004\n\n101 Dalmatians Platinum Edition - April 15th, 2008\n\n101 Reykjavik - May 13th, 2003\n\n10th and Wolf - September 28th, 2006\n\n10th District Court - June 22nd, 2006\n\n11:14 - October 11th, 2005\n\nThirteen Conversations About One Thing - December 1st, 2002\n\n13 Going on 30 - August 2nd, 2004\n\n13 Tzameti - January 13th, 2007\n\n1612 - March 30th, 2009\n\n16 Blocks Combo HD-DVD - June 12th, 2006\n\n1776: Restored Director's Cut - August 1st, 2002\n\n1 Giant Leap - September 9th, 2002\n\n2001: A Space Travesty - March 21st, 2002\n\n2001 A Space Odyssey HD-DVD - November 14th, 2007\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey - November 14th, 2007\n\nThe 2002 Olympic Winter Games - April 23rd, 2002\n\n2005 Draft Preview: Bringing the Draft to Life - March 31st, 2005\n\nThe 2006 FIFA World Cup Film: The Grand Finale - February 1st, 2007\n\nThe Team.
