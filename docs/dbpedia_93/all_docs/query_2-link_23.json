Her parents, Vesta Whitcomb and Alvah Walker, left Syracuse in August of that year with the vision of establishing a productive home where they could raise their four lively, Syracuse-born daughters—Vesta, born in 1823; Aurora Borealis, 1825; Luna, 1827; and Cynthia, 1828—in a physically and intellectually healthy environment. Oswego Town seemed the perfect place to achieve their dream. They purchased a thirtyfive-acre farm on what became known as Bunker Hill Road. The soil was ideal for the growth of vegetables and fruits, there was natural lime-water available, and the acreage was abundant in groves of pine, beech, maple, birch, cherry, butternut, and ash trees. The farm was located only two miles from Lake Ontario and a little over four miles south of the booming city of Oswego. While the growth of Oswego meant an increase in industrial smoke, Oswego Town could still boast pristine air and the quiet life of the countryside. Vesta gave birth to two more children in the early years of their life in Oswego Town: Mary, born in 1832, and two years later, their only surviving son, Alvah Jr.1 The limitless future the Walkers envisioned for their children was evident in the names they gave their first four daughters, as if to encourage them to think beyond the usual earth-bound conventions. Alvah had a passion for astronomy, and his love of observing the night skies is reflected in the older daughters’ names. If their last two children were named more conventionally, the choice for Mary at least reflected a certain pragmatism on the part of Vesta and Alvah, since she was named after a propertied paternal aunt, Mary Walker (1804–1895). The Walkers’ youngest daughter would make the name famous in the annals of America’s radical thinkers.2 The intellectual environment that the Walkers sought was readily available in the Central New York region of the 1830s, and as progressive thinkers, they added to its vibrancy. Their farm was named “Bunker Hill” because, as Mary later 1\n\n2\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nclaimed, it symbolized their hope to replicate “the great battle in national salvation” on a personal and cultural level. Alvah and Vesta were originally from Greenwich, Massachusetts, and proud to acknowledge that their families were among some of the early settlers of the Plymouth Colony. Alvah could trace his ancestors in Massachusetts to Widow Walker, who settled in Seekonic around 1643. His great-great grandfather, Philip Walker (?–1679), bought land in Rehoboth in 1660. Philip’s youngest son Ebenezer (1676–1741) was the last of ten children. Ebenezer’s son and Alvah’s grandfather, Abel Walker (1736–1763), served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and thereafter lived in Hardwick; he and his wife, Mary Snow, raised seven children, including Alvah’s father, Abel Walker II (1770–1811). Snow’s family included four ancestors who had signed the Mayflower Compact. Vesta’s ancestors could also be traced to the pre-Revolutionary years; some of them reportedly fought in the French and Indian War. Vesta and Alvah’s ideas of “national salvation” included a country in which democracy would be more fully enacted, especially with freedom for all of its citizens.3 Mary’s mother, Vesta Whitcomb (1801–1886), was the daughter of Polly Hinds and James Whitcomb, whose ancestors had lived in New England since colonial times. Vesta’s life demonstrates the heritage of a strong intellect and sense of independence. Little is known about her early years. At age twenty she married Alvah Walker (1798–1880) on September 8, 1821, in the Greenwich Methodist Church; she readily uprooted her life and joined her husband in a horse-and-covered-wagon westward trek that would end with a new home in Syracuse and then Oswego Town. Alvah Walker’s childhood in Greenwich had been indelibly altered at age thirteen when his father died. As the oldest child, family responsibilities quickly fell to him. Although his formal education ended then, he continued a process of rigorous self-education throughout his life. He took up the trade of carpentry, and his income was a significant contribution to the support of the family, which included seven siblings. When he was nineteen, his mother remarried, and Alvah was able to fulfill his dream of traveling and making a life of his own. An intelligent and thoughtful young man, his talents as a carpenter allowed him to work his way to Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, and three years later back to Massachusetts. In late 1820, the twenty-two-year-old carpenter became engaged to Vesta Whitcomb. After their marriage, they determined to travel west, stopping along the way to visit Vesta’s relatives in Central New York. Whether it was due to the success of those visits, the time of year, or the good possibility of carpentry work for Alvah in Syracuse, the Walkers decided to settle in the growing city. Alvah quickly found work, and here Vesta gave birth to their first five children. Abel, the first born, died within days of his birth, but their four daughters thrived. The family resided in Syracuse for ten years before moving to Oswego Town.4 Transporting their household goods on the packet canal boat into Oswego and then by wagon to Oswego Town, the Walkers settled in the farm’s small cottage until they could complete the building of their home, a white frame house with a low roof. The Central New York region was rapidly becoming a hotbed of radical\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n3\n\nphilosophies and social reform movements, including antislavery, suffrage, and health reform. One of their neighbors in Oswego was Gerrit Smith, the largest property owner in the city and a progressive thinker who helped shape the intellectual life of Oswego through his interests in nonsectarianism, abolition, and dress reform. His life would cross paths with Mary Walker’s for the next several decades.5 Living in Oswego Town rather than Oswego gave the Walkers the independence of distance but the nearness of a bustling center. In Oswego the Walkers could sell the products of their farm and purchase other necessities. Equally important, traveling the four and a half miles to Oswego gave them the opportunity to attend many cultural and political events. By the time the Walkers arrived, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, Congregational, and Catholic churches were well established, and soon Millerites, Adventists, and Universalists would establish meetinghouses in the region. The years from 1830 to 1836 were a boom period for Oswego. The population rose from a little over 2,000 to 5,000 residents; wheat and particularly flour mills flourished; the manufactories’ success resulted in a significant increase in the collection of canal tolls after a canal was built connecting the city to the Erie Canal. In 1838 the town proudly built the three-story Market House at the intersection of Water and Bridge Streets. Here the Walkers had access to the post office and customs house; fish, meat, and vegetable stalls were available on the main floor; and they could climb to the second floor to conduct business at the city offices. When they continued to the third floor, they stepped into the multifunctional, one-hundred-foot-long meeting room. Its blue ceiling seemed to open the heavens to its visitors, and they could turn to the windows for a stunning view of the river. In this room, the family could attend theatricals, watch the Oswego Guards’ drill practice, or attend the town’s annual ball.6 By 1850, the city population had reached nearly 15,000. Amid the seventeen or eighteen large flour mills were hotels, churches, and a variety of smaller businesses. Two years earlier the Oswego and Syracuse Railroad had been established, ensuring another important market connection. A writer for the Water-Cure Journal suggested that if investors would support the building of more commodious hotels, Oswego might become one of the principal resort areas in the United States. If the city never gained resort status, industrially it prospered. By the 1860s, it could boast the world’s largest flour mill as well as cotton factories, tanneries, saw mills, ironworks, and other manufactories. In the years of Mary’s youth, it was an exciting and prosperous region. Those features drew creative, progressive individuals who helped to reshape the city’s educational and literary endeavors and, ultimately, to be part of Central New York’s fermenting radicalism.7\n\nMary Edwards Walker as a child was gifted with intellect, beauty, and an indomitable spirit. Traditionally, these attributes would have cast her as a highly marriageable young woman whose life would be shaped by motherhood and conventional social values, and Mary had her share of suitors. One admirer sent her a Valentine\n\n4\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\npoem, praising her refined taste, raven locks, and a nobility that led to “dreams of fevered sleep”; most important, however, the poem’s author asserted, was Mary’s “gift of thought.” In addition to her intellectualism, two factors led Mary in quite different directions than most females born in the 1830s: her parents’ progressive ideas about education, and her own iron will—a will that would give her the courage to travel unimagined paths.8 While the Walker house was modestly furnished, books dominated the interior life. The family emphasis on education was distinct, one neighbor recalled: “There was a simplicity, an air of refinement, of culture, an intangible something in its atmosphere that betokened personality. Here lived people with a certain awareness of life as a spiritual adventure.” Education for Mary and her siblings began at home; but the education of the Walker children was not limited to formal schooling. The first lesson they learned was that hard work was the primary route to useful rewards, and Vesta and Alvah modeled these values. Their egalitarian marriage embraced the farm and domestic spheres. Vesta and her daughters helped with the chores of planting and harvesting, and Alvah often cleaned the household floors and washed clothes. He was also a talented leather worker who made ladies’ calfskin boots and gloves. Alvah was “one of the progressive and forehanded farmers of his day” and an influential member of the Farmers’ Club of Oswego, often contributing ideas about cultivating new strains of fruits and vegetables. Although not agnostic like Vesta’s famous cousin, lawyer and orator Robert Ingersoll, the Walkers were “free thinkers” in the sense that intellectual interrogation of ideas sustained every aspect of their lives. The Walkers taught Mary and her siblings to question religious tenets in the same way they would probe any other system of ideas. While living in Syracuse, Alvah and Vesta sometimes attended Baptist services, and on other Sundays the Methodist services. The Greenwich Walkers had been Methodists, and Alvah was a church member, but he and Vesta rejected the stark evangelicalism of the Second Great Awakening that was stirring throughout the Northeast. They raised their children with a strong belief in God but not in one particular sect’s interpretations. It was a creed that their youngest daughter would embrace throughout her life.9 One radically new religious movement of Mary’s teenage years was Spiritualism. Influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg’s extensive writings on the spirit world that emerged from trances in which he felt he had communed with spirits, Spiritualism was first given its American roots by Andrew Jackson Davis of Poughkeepsie, New York, who published The Principles of Nature in 1847. His system of harmonial philosophy emphasized individualism in an era in which the Transcendentalists had made the concept a touchstone for intellectualism. Equally important to the development of Spiritualism in the States were reformers in the abolition and women’s rights movements. Many churches were slow to join the antislavery cause, so a significant number of activists turned to Spiritualism. It was also one of the first religious movements in America that encouraged women to speak before mixed audiences. Mary gained an interest in Spiritualism in her youth that she retained\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n5\n\nthroughout her life. Her faith became even less sectarian as an adult; the primary creed by which she lived was an advocacy of “whatever was right and true.”10 As progressive thinkers, Vesta and Alvah were committed to the eradication of slavery, and their home in Oswego became a stop on Central New York’s Underground Railroad. In the early 1830s, Maria Stewart, Fanny Wright, and the Grimké sisters traveled throughout the region lecturing against slavery, and soon thereafter antislavery writings by Lydia Maria Child, Maria Weston Chapman, and many others began to circulate. The Walkers arrived in the Oswego area during the burgeoning era of abolitionism. They occasionally attended the Syracuse Baptist Church where in the fall of 1831 a group of fifteen activists, including Gerrit Smith, announced a meeting for “the friends of the slave.” As the group neared the church, they were assaulted by a furious mob and retreated. Although the local press widely condoned the mob’s actions, the incident reverberated through the growing community of antislavery sympathizers. Before the end of the decade, three hundred antislavery societies were active in towns across the state. Oswegonians’ support of abolition was also recognized in 1849 when Frederick Douglass lectured in the city. It is not known if fifteen-year-old Mary met Douglass at this time, but it is unlikely the Walker family would have missed an opportunity to hear such an important speaker for a cause they believed in so ardently. The year after Douglass’s appearance in Oswego, the Liberty Party, which he and Smith had helped to found, held its annual convention in the city, and the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law that year gave rise to increased antislavery efforts in the region. In future years, Mary and Frederick would come to know one another well through the abolition and suffrage movements.11 Mary’s formal education was also radically shaped by her parents. Determined that their daughters should have as thorough an education as their son and committed to reforming the nation in order to embrace equality in all its institutions, the Walkers decided in the late 1830s to establish a schoolhouse on their Bunker Hill property. With the help of neighbors they erected a building, and Alvah and Vesta founded the region’s first free school. They, and later their eldest daughters, served as teachers in the school. The typical curriculum for graduation from common schools in New York State included orthography, writing, reading, and elocution; geography, history, and human physiology; elementary to advanced mathematics; natural, intellectual, and moral philosophies; and drawing and vocal music. The Walkers’ free school probably offered many of these areas of study. The exceptional education that Mary Walker received in her youth was evident throughout her life.12 During their early formal education, Mary and her siblings gained a new kind of bodily and health education at home as well. Vesta and Alvah were drawn to new ideas about personal hygiene and dress reform, which became major movements in the United States in the 1840s. For the Walkers, dress reform was a health issue. Vesta Walker was severely ill after she gave birth to her first child, and Alvah suffered many illnesses during their Syracuse years; as a result, he became a prolific\n\n6\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nreader of medical books. He determined through his readings that personal hygiene was the way to a healthy life and that corsets and other forms of binding clothing damaged young females’ health. His beliefs were so ardently embraced by his precocious youngest daughter that she became one of the few women in America to embrace the new clothing revolution throughout her life. Health reform for the Walkers was also linked to their temperance and anti-tobacco sentiments. Organized temperance activities emerged in the 1820s, and ministers and physicians alike joined in calling for abstinence from the use of these substances. In 1840, a new direction for the temperance movement arose: “Washington Societies” were organized not by moral leaders but by reformed alcoholics who often dramatically demonstrated on the lecture platform the hellish effects of delirium tremens. Although considered indecorous by some temperance leaders, the Societies greatly expanded awareness of the evils of alcohol abuse. Mary’s attitude about the destructive effects of alcohol and tobacco would deepen in the coming years as she studied their physiological effects as part of her medical training.13 The growth of several such radical reform movements in Central New York would influence Mary Walker’s future as a physician, lecturer, and writer. None was more important, however, than the women’s rights movement. One of the primary advantages Mary had over many young women who entered the suffrage crusade was support from both parents. The majority of activists had to endure staunch criticism from their families. As Lucy Stone recalled about her abusive father, “There was only one will in our home, and that was my father’s.” Mary, however, credited her father with her initial interest in dress reform and both her parents for “support[ing] me in my determination to show the world that I was in earnest, that I had the courage of my convictions.” Outside influences were significant as well. Women in New York State were agitating for suffrage several years before the Seneca Falls Convention would draw national attention to the issue. In 1846, for instance, as the state was drafting a new constitution, six women from Jefferson County presented to the constitutional convention in Albany a “Petition for Woman’s Rights” in which they argued “[t]hat the present government of this state has widely departed from the true democratic principles . . . by denying to the female portion of the community the right of suffrage and any participation in forming the government and laws under which they live.” Taxation without representation, they asserted, denied them “the only safeguards of their individual and personal liberties” and they asked that the state grant women equal civil and political rights. The document is notable for its frank expression of a right to equality, much like the powerful voice that Mary would develop as a suffragist and for which she would be both praised and condemned. She was fifteen when Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a small group of like-minded women organized the nearby Seneca Falls national women’s rights convention in 1848. The “Declaration of Sentiments” that emerged as the convention’s manifesto observed that “the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her,” and the\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n7\n\nactivists established their goal of woman’s “inalienable right to the elective franchise” in direct opposition to that tyranny. It was the banner under which Mary Walker would live her life.14\n\nAs Mary grew into adolescence, many of her free hours were spent studying the medical books that her father had accumulated. She had already developed ideals of aspiration. As yet vague (to maintain high ideals; to develop an independent, genuine career; not to do, think, or say anything simply because everyone else did), they were clearly shaped by her readings. When she read a missionary’s letter printed in a local newspaper that detailed the need for women doctors, she began to read voraciously to prepare herself for the evangelical life of a medical missionary. Soon she abandoned the missionary aspect of her goal and devoted herself fully to a detailed study of anatomy. Dr. Calvin Cutter’s treatises on anatomy, physiology, and hygiene were her favorite readings at age sixteen. Cutter was an abolitionist, and Mary began to see how reform zeal and medicine could be intimately linked. Cutter’s tracts included dozens of engravings that allowed her to study the details of human anatomy. She also read any accounts of coroner’s inquests and postmortem examinations she could find. Soon theory was not enough—she wanted to observe an operation. At the time she could not find a surgeon who would agree, but the desire grew with every new text she read. She revealed her interests to her parents, who responded with immediate encouragement. The readings and her parents’ beliefs convinced her of the importance of clothing reform, and a new idea began to emerge from her studies: Could she be a physician? All it required was intelligence and a willingness for hard work, both of which she had in abundance. She nurtured the idea as she advanced in her education.15 After attending the Walkers’ free school, Mary’s formal education continued at Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York. Aurora and Luna attended the coeducational seminary from 1845 to 1847. Mary arrived in 1851, the year after the academy’s new four-story building was dedicated. She attended the three-term session of 1851–1852. Hungry for the stimulation of advanced study, at nineteen she was also undoubtedly anxious to begin a career, which may explain her attendance for one year instead of the two years her older sisters had completed. The finances of the Walkers were always subject to the precariousness of farming, and that, too, may have been a factor; but most students attended for one year. Three hundred and ninety-five students (220 males and 175 females) were enrolled during the year in which Mary attended. Of that number, only three students (all female) graduated with a two-year degree.16 Falley Seminary was not a casual choice for the Walker sisters’ education, considering the parents’ commitment to new ideas in health issues. The school banned tobacco and alcohol, emphasized personal hygiene, and taught Dr. Cutter’s treatises. The “Maine law” of 1851 prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcohol gave new impetus to schools to curb students’ alcohol-related unruly behavior. Mary\n\n8\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nheard Neal Dow, sponsor of the “Maine law,” speak in Fulton, and her interest in temperance grew in these years. In her first year at Falley, Mary studied algebra, grammar, natural philosophy, physiology, and hygiene. Six years earlier Paulina Wright Davis had begun a lecture tour to teach women about physiology and anatomy, and water-cure periodicals were bringing new ideas about physiology to their readers; but it was still unusual to have courses on hygiene and physiology in a coeducational school curriculum. Falley proudly noted in its catalog that its library included “numerous means of illustrating the Natural Sciences” and it would offer regular courses of lectures in physiology, natural philosophy, and chemistry. The institution’s Executive Board included several physicians. It was the perfect curriculum for a student like Mary with interests in science and medicine. Yet it offered her a more practical education as well. The school’s newspaper editor was the daughter of a foreign missionary, and Mary was surprised to have an essay on abolition unceremoniously rejected by the young editor. Mary recalled, “My father had been a very prominent abolitionist and I was very much opposed to human slavery. It struck me as very peculiar that a girl whose father had been a foreign missionary could look with favor on American slavery. That was one of the things which first opened my eyes on this question. I took a stand then and never faltered in my love for American freedom.”17 After completing the course at Falley, Mary began teaching in Minetto, New York. The boys and girls she taught were drawn to her attractiveness and merriment, but she tolerated no pranks, as one young boy soon learned. In the cold New York winters, the ink bottles often froze, and one morning the boy decided to place a frozen bottle on the stove. When it broke, spewing black ink across the stove top, Mary smacked a ruler across his hands. He was as indignant at being thus treated as the fictional Amy March would famously be, but Teacher Walker held her ground. In reality, Mary viewed teaching only as the financial means to enrollment in a medical college. She was increasingly interested in the new ideas about medical treatments that emerged during her youth and were now gaining ground nationally. While Mary conscientiously fulfilled the requirements of her teaching position, she was also interested in using the classroom as a means of putting into practice her new ideas about hygiene. Her classroom became the future doctor’s first laboratory. She also attempted again to observe an operation, asking a local surgeon if she could attend a scheduled removal of a cancerous tumor from a woman’s breast, but the surgeon admonished her for displaying “prurient immodesty.” Alternatively, she sat with seriously ill neighbors to observe their symptoms.18 Following the ideals of her parents, Mary incorporated the theme of dress reform into her views on medical requirements for healthful living. If social proprieties countered her studied opinions, then social proprieties were wrong. While teaching, she began to wear a loose-waist, known as a “Jenny Lind waist” after the young Swedish singing sensation, which was sewn into the skirt of the overdress. She also altered the skirt, raising its length to mid-calf, and added pants beneath\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n9\n\nthe overskirt. When she altered the skirt length again, raising it to the knee, several neighbors verbalized their disapproval. Nor were all of her opponents’ attacks merely verbal. One afternoon as Mary was walking along a country road she was observed by a farmer who was outraged to see she was wearing pants beneath a shortened skirt. Mary was a small woman, just over five feet tall and weighing less than one hundred pounds, but this did not cause hesitation on the farmer’s part. He gathered a group of boys and they began to chase her, throwing eggs and any object within their reach. While her youth, excellent health, and agility helped her escape (and she proudly recalled years later that she and the farmer had eventually become friends), the incident was only the beginning of Mary’s lifelong battle with males who felt free to verbally and physically attack her because of her nonconformity.19\n\nAfter nearly two years of teaching, Mary’s dream of a medical education was fulfilled with her acceptance into Syracuse Medical College in December 1853. It was one of the few medical colleges that admitted women in these early years. It is not surprising that she selected an eclectic institution; since childhood she had been steeped in the idea of eclecticism as a form of democratic inquiry. It was the primary basis of her exceptional education: attend more than one church to hear differing ideas about Christianity and draw your own conclusions; listen to a wide variety of lecturers and politicians so as to think critically rather than accept blindly; read widely to bring a well-balanced knowledge to new fields of exploration. Eclectics were part of the Medical Reformers movement of the antebellum era, which included physicians with differing theories of medical practice united by a commitment to liberal reform. While they were interested in exploring all avenues of potential treatment, eclectics drew primarily on homeopathy and herbalism. The American Eclectic Medical Association was founded in 1848, in opposition to the allopathic American Medical Association. Allopaths denigrated eclectics as quacks with no medical standards, and eclectics charged allopaths with being quacks who accepted convention with no scientific investigation into new methodologies. The best physicians on both sides lamented the state of medical training in mid-century America in which medical colleges granted degrees primarily for students’ attendance at lectures and less-than-strenuous examinations.20 Mary entered the profession just as eclectic medical colleges were engaged in the shift to more rigorous training. While the allopaths’ approach would come to dominate American medicine, they were opposed to women in the profession. Equally important for Mary and other reform activists who entered medicine, the AMA was defined by its sense of exclusion and privilege for its members, whereas eclectics emphasized medical therapies for “the common people.” Syracuse Medical College was incorporated at the end of 1850 and was certified by the state of New York. It subsumed the eclectic Central Medical College of Syracuse, the first medical institution in the nation to admit women, and Syracuse Medical continued\n\n10\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nthe coeducational policy. One of Central’s first graduates, Dr. Lydia Folger Fowler, was appointed professor of obstetrics and diseases of women and children at Central, becoming the first woman medical professor in the United States and a model for women who followed. The handful of institutions that admitted women for medical study in the early 1850s typically had separate curricula or only allowed women to attend selected lectures, often excluding anatomy because it was considered indecent for a woman to view a naked body and an embarrassment for male students to have females in attendance. Many women were fighting to change these standards, but coeducation would not be fully realized in most institutions of medical training for several decades. Elizabeth Blackwell’s experiences six years before Mary entered medical college were well known to the public. She was urged by her anatomy professor to forgo attending lectures while the reproductive system was under discussion, and when she began as a resident at the Blockley Almshouse hospital, her male counterparts removed the patients’ charts from the wards so she would not have access to their diagnoses and treatments. Mary had experienced the highly unusual situation of a coeducational seminary, and Syracuse Medical’s proclaimed philosophy that “nothing should be used as a remedy that will injure the human constitution, and that all means used should have a direct tendency to sustain and not depress the vital powers,” undoubtedly appealed to her interest in reform medicine as well.21 Medical colleges of this era did not require specific educational preparation before admittance. Acceptance was based on application and fees (and on one’s sex). Graduation requirements were completion of two or three winter terms (typically eight to twelve weeks each) consisting of lectures and surgical demonstrations, training in dissection, clinical training in which groups of students visited patients under the guidance of a physician professor, and the successful demonstration of the student’s knowledge in an oral examination. The best students sought time outside the classroom with their professors for additional training in anatomical and surgical studies. It was well into the 1870s before any significant changes were enacted on a widespread scale. Mary’s medical education was typical for the time: three winter terms of thirteen weeks each, costing $55 per term plus room and board of about $1.50 per week. Each new student was assigned a preceptor, and as Mary’s skill and dedication became apparent, Dr. Stephen H. Potter, president of the New York State Eclectic Medical Society and the founding publisher of the Eclectic Medical and Surgical Journal, undertook her preceptorship; he became a lifelong friend.22 Mary took courses in anatomy, surgery, practice of medicine and medical pathology, obstetrics, women’s and children’s diseases, physiology, materia medica, therapeutics, pharmacy, chemistry, and medical jurisprudence. It was in the field of therapeutics (treatment of disease) that the various medical philosophies were distinguished. Therapeutics was the invigorating core of medical training in the 1850s, influenced by the progress in physiology and chemistry. Important for Mary’s interests was the field’s burgeoning attention to diet, hygiene, hydropathy, and\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n11\n\nother medical regimes that were being developed on a scientific basis. For much of the nineteenth century, hydropathy was an influential aspect of training in therapeutics. The Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, which would become the most renowned women’s medical college in the United States, taught hydropathy as a part of its therapeutics courses and accepted dissertations on the subject; many of its graduates opened sanitariums specializing in hydropathy treatments. Indelibly linked to eclectics’ study of therapeutics was that of pharmacy. This course would demonstrate one of the major differences from the teachings of allopathic institutions, where the use of large doses of drugs was commonplace. Eclectics opposed such treatments, preferring to investigate ways in which smaller dosages of drugs (or abstinence from such usage) could be combined with other forms of treatment so as not to “injure the human constitution.”23 In addition to lectures, Mary was given hands-on experience. Between each term, she moved from the classroom to interning with a licensed physician. A one-year course was all that was required for graduation, but some of the best students, including Mary, remained for advanced study. During these years, she also became a successful subscription agent for the Syracuse Medical and Surgical Journal, which was published by the college; she undoubtedly undertook this role to support the eclectic movement but probably to earn extra funds as well. Although in theory eclectics asserted equality, eclectic male students did not always accept their female counterparts as equals. Mary was often told by fellow students that she should marry a doctor, and then if he approved, she could return to her studies. She did make a good friend in another student—Jane M. Clews, who had come from Canada to attend the medical college. Yet when Mary determined to adapt her clothing to a more practical style of a shortened skirt with pants beneath it, other women students did not support her. Clews explained that she agreed in principle but thought they should wait until they had successfully established practices before adding dress reform to their agenda. For Mary, it was a matter of principle, and she would not countenance delay, in spite of negative comments from faculty and students. Her dedication took many forms. Near the end of her medical training, Mary’s attention was drawn to the terrible suffering of British soldiers wounded during the Crimean War. She contacted the secretary of war and sought appointment as a physician under the aegis of the British military forces. She may have been influenced, as so many women of the era were, by Florence Nightingale’s activities, but she was not interested in nursing. The war ended before she could enact her plan, but the effort foreshadowed the role she would seek in her own country’s impending war.24 While in medical school, Mary fell in love for the first time. He was a fellow student, identified only as “M.M.G,” and he won her heart by being delighted in her spirit of independence and by pursuing her over a period of several weeks. But as their love progressed, she discovered that he was writing to a young woman from his hometown. Although M.M.G. insisted no discussion of marriage had ever passed between him and the young woman, Mary understood that his\n\n12\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\ncorrespondent was in love with him. Based on what she termed “principles of justice and self sacrifice” for a woman whose future was dependent on marriage, Mary ended her love affair with M.M.G. (who later married his correspondent). While her decision focused on support rather than competition with another woman, it also allowed her to pursue her studies unencumbered by a lover’s expectations.25 On February 20, 1855, Mary Edwards Walker was awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree with honors and granted the right to practice medicine and surgery. She earned Censors’ Certificates in 1854 and 1855, and the certificates, like licenses late in the century, were an essential requirement for the legal right to practice medicine at this time. On the evening of February 22, Mary experienced one of the crowning moments of her life when graduation ceremonies were held at College Hall. Twelve students received the Doctor of Medicine diplomas that evening. She was one of three students who had formed the Alumni Society; with the motto “Our business is investigation,” its members sought to continue their education outside the classroom through weekly meetings in which they engaged in polemical debates, analyzed medical questions, read selected essays, and sought a variety of ways in which to engage themselves intellectually. Because of the high quality of their accomplishments, the three members of the Alumni Society were offered an initial ceremony before the regular commencement began. Albert E. Miller, Mary’s future husband, was selected to begin the special ceremony.26 Albert’s speech offers insights into the values of chartered eclectic medical colleges—and into why Mary was intellectually as well as emotionally drawn to him. We are living in “an age of progress” and reform, Albert told his colleagues and audience members, but reform is not enough. The man who constitutes “the greatest individual of the age . . . is the liberal thinker,” he asserted, because that man is “free from all prejudice” and breathes the “vivifying atmosphere of science.” The hope of the profession was proffered in his conclusion: “Eclecticism . . . is destined e’er long to illuminate the world. Oh! success to eclecticism, the God-send of the medical mind.” Albert’s ardency, high standards, and grand ambitions were exactly what Mary avowed for herself in her new role of eclectic physician.27 The Society selected J. H. Stebbins to give the valedictory speech for this segment of the commencement, which followed Miller’s address. Stebbins noted that, although the Society seemed at first destined to fail, “a few noble minds and progressive spirits, lent a ready and hearty fellowship,” and then acknowledged the role that Mary played in the development of the group: “and woman, the great pioneer in every philanthropic endeavor, extended her potent aid and sympathy, and through their combined influence and active co-operation, a new impulse was given to our flagging efforts, which has resulted in the awakening of a spirit of investigation which no future discouragements can daunt.” The idealism inherent in the Alumni Society’s vision of the future was not without an understanding of the difficulty of their undertaking. The Society sought no less than a radical reorganization of society: “All narrow-minded conservatism must give way before a liberal and candid spirit of improvement; and a noble zeal for the welfare of\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n13\n\nthe race, should usurp the place of selfish interests. It requires sound judgment and an unprejudiced mind, as well as indomitable perseverance and determined endeavor; yet not to do this is to be recreant to the claims of truth, the appeals of humanity, and the dictates of conscience.” Their creed for medical and social reform, shaped during invigorating weekly meetings, would be the basis for the way in which Mary examined every cause she undertook for the remainder of her life, whether it involved medicine, the law, or civil rights.28 Stebbins’s speech was followed by a short address from the president, who awarded the members of the Alumni Society special diplomas and then commended the Society for its endeavors. It was, he noted, both “a literary society [that is, the reading of medical literature] for mutual improvement, and for thorough scientific investigation” and that “the habits of investigation here formed would be the key that would unlock the door to the great library of medical practice. Thus they would become men and women in medical science and literature.” When the commencement proceedings were published in the American Medical & Surgical Journal, the editor commented that the recognition given to Walker, Miller, and Stebbins was an impressive scene never to be forgotten by those present.29 The ceremony then turned to the regular commencement events. Mary had the distinction of presenting the first speech. She addressed the challenges, the many “ignoble obstacles,” that faced a woman who pursued medical training. A moving representation of both her exhausting endeavors and her hopes for the future, the speech reflected the difficulty she still felt as a woman taking on the role of physician. Both Miller and Stebbins had freely used “I” in their speeches, but Mary shifted from the individual to the generic woman physician and to the third person form of address. Few women in America at this time understood themselves to be intellectuals, and the shift to third person collective was a means of softening her own claims and projecting solidarity with other women. “‘Get wisdom, and with all thy gettings, get understanding,’ has made an indelible impression upon her mind,” Mary asserted about the woman physician, “and every effort to efface it, brings a new proof of its indelibility. She has resolved to avail herself of the only means whereby she can acquire wisdom, which is, intellectual toil.” Mary did not shy away from the question that always arose about a woman physician—that bodily knowledge would taint her as a woman. To “Know thyself,” she asserted, is commanded in the Bible, but “how can she be acquainted with herself, unless she possesses a knowledge of her self intellectually, not only, but physically.” Nor did Mary sidestep the lack of liberty that shaped her own and all women’s lives: “She has of late cried as loudly for liberty as did Patrick Henry—her language is—my chains of circumscribed thought must be sundered. ‘Give me liberty’ of thought or give me death!” Observing that she was charged with “criminal curiosity” for pursuing medical studies, she drew upon a lecture by DeWitt Clinton, the renowned New York political leader, to challenge such claims: “Knowledge never debases.”30 This was one of the first public speeches Mary presented, and as she reminded the audience, the request for herself, Miller, and Stebbins to speak was a surprise\n\n14\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nthat came with short notice. In the newness of her position and the haste to prepare her first speech, she sometimes pushed her metaphors to extremes, but turning to her professors and her peers, she captured her heartfelt appreciation of faculty who did not resist having a woman in their class: “we appreciate the courtesy extended to us as ladies, and shall ever remember with gratitude, the noble, philanthropic hearts, that granted us scientific privileges, equal with gentlemen, which, although they might belong to us, have not until recently been enjoyed— and even now, only in a very few colleges. . . . We earnestly hope that you may be successful in all your efforts to promote reform in medicine,—may your anticipations be realized, and may you reap a full reward for all your toil.” When she addressed her peers, her voice gained a confidence of equality and experience that had been refined through the debating skills she learned by participating in the Alumni Society. She defined her colleagues’ time together as “pleasant and profitable,” and then charged them with the responsibility of being “competent to discharge all the duties pertaining to the profession with satisfaction to others, and honor to yourselves.” She commanded the students in the audience who had not yet finished their studies to recognize “that their privileges cannot be estimated too highly.” As one of only a handful of women in the United States to receive the medical degree, she understood that such an education was, indeed, a privilege of the few. She concluded with a poignant farewell to her colleagues: “But the time to part has arrived. The hand must be taken for the last time. The eyes by which the emotions of the soul are so clearly read, must take their last look. The ‘good bye’ that has been so often breathed must be repeated. Highly esteemed, and never to be forgotten professors and fellow students, all Farewell!” It was more of a farewell than the graduates may have realized at the time. The college had been founded by a group of notable physicians and teachers, many of whom would go on to distinguish themselves at other medical colleges, but funding was always a challenge, and when Dr. Potter was lured to Cincinnati at the end of 1855, Syracuse Medical College closed. The eclectic medical reform movement, however, would survive into the early twentieth century.31 Earning a medical degree was a major accomplishment, but it did not necessarily insure a successful practice. Most of the earliest women physicians struggled to establish private practices that would afford them a livable income. One of Alvah’s sisters, Harriet Walker Hall, settled with her family in Columbus, Ohio, and with the family’s encouragement, Mary set out for Columbus. Dr. E. W. Stockwell of Cincinnati wrote a letter of recommendation as to her skill as a physician to aid her in setting up practice. Her time in Ohio was short, however. Mary and Albert Miller had kept in touch after graduation. A man of intellect, charm, and eloquence, Miller seemed a suitable life partner for Mary. Although decades later she would insist M.M.G. had been her one true love, she entered her marriage believing it was both a love relationship and a commitment between two like-minded reformers. They worked closely together for two years during their formal studies and in developing the Alumni Society, and the separation of\n\nThe Seeds of Radicalism\n\n15\n\nseveral months while Mary was in Columbus obviously kindled their romantic attachment. Albert set up practice in Rome, New York, and shortly after Mary returned to New York they became engaged. Her three surviving sisters (Cynthia died in 1849 from unknown causes) had all married by this time—Vesta to Willet Worden, Aurora to Lyman Coats, and Luna to Wickham Griswold—and undoubtedly Mary entered into her engagement with Albert expecting, like her sisters, to be forming a lifelong bond.32 They were married on November 16, 1855, in the Walker family home, ten days before Mary’s twenty-third birthday. Rev. Samuel J. May presided over their marriage. May was well known to the Walker family. He was a liberal Unitarian, an abolitionist, and a longtime supporter of women’s rights. Mary wore a dressy version of what was becoming her usual style of apparel in these years: a shortened skirt over pants. Their ceremony reflected Mary’s strong feminist values. She would not include the word “obey” in their vows, as she believed antislavery should extend to marriage, and she was supported in her request by Reverend May. Equality was essential to marriage for Mary: “How barbarous the very idea of one equal promising to be a slave to another, instead of both entering life’s great drama as intelligent, equal partners! Our promises were such as denoted two intelligent beings, instead of one intelligent and one chattel—‘to love and cherish each other as long as both shall live.’” The marriage was announced in the local papers, and because of their profession and Mary’s growing regional reputation in dress reform circles, notices also appeared in the New York Medical Journal, the American Medical and Surgical Journal, and Amelia Bloomer’s dress reform journal, The Lily. One change brought about by Mary’s marriage may have remained a mystery to her at this time. Although Alvah Walker was a progressive thinker and supported Mary’s desire for a profession, he was not without certain conventional ideas. His will was written to leave most of his property to his son, an annual income to his wife, money to his two married daughters, Aurora and Luna, and to Mary Walker “on the day of her marriage.”33 Mary and Albert’s union was to be an egalitarian marriage and professional partnership, and the sign over their door at 76 Dominick Street declared their joint practice of “Miller and Walker, Physicians.” They maintained separate offices on the ground floor; each had his and her own clientele, and Mary drove her own horse and carriage to call on patients. Initially, she intended to treat only women and children, but she was asked occasionally by women patients to be their family physician and began treating a few male patients.34 Situated at the foothills of the Adirondacks, the town of Rome was developing quickly in these years; like Oswego, its connection to the Erie Canal made it an important industrial site, and its production of metals would soon earn it the sobriquet of “Copper City.” In 1859, Mary and Albert moved their residence and practices to larger rooms at 60 Dominick Street. The combination of woman physician and dress reformer was unusual even in this region of radical thought. In these years Mary was still experimenting with the dress-over-pants style of clothing. She\n\n16\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nhad ten to twelve outfits, with several different skirt lengths. “No matter the length of skirt I wore,” she later recalled, “somebody considered it his or her Christian duty to tell me that I ought to wear some other length.” Soon Mary experimented with additional changes in her attire. “After a while I wore a marine skirt, made of a sort of transparent fabric; then I got up the courage to take my petticoats off altogether. I wore the loose sack from some time after this.”35 A part of Mary’s support system in these years included other dress reform advocates and women physicians, many of whom would remain lifelong friends. Though few of the women physicians were located near her, they corresponded as best they could with their busy professional and domestic schedules. One of her correspondents during her early years in Rome was her medical school friend Dr. Jane Clews, who had returned to Canada to practice with an established male physician in Bowmanville. Clews’s letters reveal the challenges that young women physicians in the 1850s faced when they tried to break the medical barriers. Persecuted by relatives and isolated in the small community of Bowmanville, Jane wrote to Mary for strength and a sense of community. Asserting she was inspired by Mary’s perseverance, Jane wrote, “onward onward is my motto.” Their new professional experiences were the most important aspect of their correspondence. In one letter Jane noted that she had just returned from a snowy twelve-mile round trip to see a patient. She recalled that Mary had always loved to watch the falling snow, and she proclaimed of her house call, “I had a good time.” The isolation was difficult, however, and Jane decided to look for a position in a large city where she would have better support and perhaps the chance to marry. She demanded of Mary, “Say it is better since you are married.”36 Within two years another woman physician friend would aid Mary in her new role as a writer, and these professional friendships were an important source of support in the years to come. Mary was establishing a solid reputation among her patients. Harriet Harris wrote a letter of appreciation to her in April 1857; Harris had suffered a long illness with chronic pain, but “Doctor Walker has positively cured me,” she proclaimed. Harris considered Mary now to be a “Beloved friend,” equal in the “love and respect” Harris held for her own sister. Everything on Mary’s horizon seemed blessed: she had achieved her extraordinary goal of becoming a physician, she was established in private practice, she had married a man who accepted her radical ideas about equality and who was her intellectual equal, and she was beginning to develop her interests in reform activism and writing. But looming equally large on the horizon were a national catastrophe in which she would play an important role as a woman physician, and a personal catastrophe that would forever reshape her life and her ideas about marital relationships.37\n\nChapter\n\n2\n\n5 Dress Reform and The Sibyl\n\nMary Walker wanted to be famous. She dreamed of it in her youth, and she proclaimed in her commencement address that she and her colleagues should seek “greatness in usefulness” as their highest priority but also should write their “names on the highest tablet of fame.” Her desire for public recognition was well known among her friends. As Clews wrote to Mary, since “you are an aspirant after fame[,] I am with you.” While Clews feared that fame meant notoriety, Mary saw it as an acknowledgment of intellectual achievement. Although “notorious” would be the term by which many critics identified Mary’s national standing in the coming years, she had an extraordinary belief in herself and her abilities that was confirmed by her admirers. Her fame would chart every possible facet of public recognition, from curiosity and scandal to admiration and national treasure. Her greatest fame would come from her seven-decade crusade for women’s rights.1 In the 1850s Mary began to realize that her love of literature and writing was both a means of gaining a wider audience for her radical beliefs and an avenue to fame. Literature had been an integral part of the Walker family household. In Mary’s youth the Central New York region became increasingly famous due to the writings of authors such as James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving. Periodicals flourished in the region, and Oswego itself produced a literary magazine, The Oasis, in the mid-1830s. Family scrapbooks of literature were common among educated families, and the Walker family scrapbooks reveal the wide range of materials that was available to Mary and her siblings as a means of advancing their liberal education. In addition to religious selections, the scrapbooks were rife with poems about temperance, antislavery, equality, and the maltreatment of Native Americans. The importance of education was highlighted. Not least important among the politically oriented poems were selections such as “Fashion,” which exposed the financial burdens of dressing in fashionable female clothing. Mary’s love of poetry is evident in the many quotes that pepper her writings, and she was moved to make her own experiments in the genre. One poem, written after 17\n\n18\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nthe Civil War, reflects on the desire to live into old age and then pass into “fields Elysian—/ . . . Through quiet transition.” Nothing in Mary’s life would be through quiet transition, but in 1857 she was about to add a new avenue of endeavor, one that would shape her life for the next six decades. The transitional avenue was writing, but it was dress reform that would be the driving force of her ideals and her growing fame. For Mary, dress reform was the link between her love of medicine and her belief in women’s equality.2 Her commitment to women’s rights would have made the suffrage movement one of the most likely avenues for these endeavors. She was well acquainted with the leaders of both suffrage and antislavery groups, but her heavy schedule of medical training, moving to Ohio and back to New York, marrying, and establishing a practice limited her overt political activities in the mid-1850s. By 1857 when she was ready to become more active, the women’s rights movement was in the throes of crisis. Many of the leaders—including Stanton, Stone, and Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell—were pregnant or nursing newborns, and their collective activities flagged. Further, much of the time they did have was being directed toward antislavery efforts. Legal decisions, such as the Dred Scott v. Sanford case that allowed slave owners the right to their “property” even in free states, caused major splits in the woman’s suffrage organizations. With dissension rising, funds diminishing, and leaders exhausted, the 1857 national convention was cancelled. Thus Mary determined to devote herself at present to the dress reform cause.3 Dress reform evolved over several decades. Many women who were part of the westward movement or who, like Mary and her sisters, lived on a farm had learned quickly that practicality made the wearing of pants a necessity of physical labor. These early changes in costume received little public attention or criticism. Women such as George Sand and Rosa Bonheur began in the 1840s to alter their clothing choices, and while they were loudly condemned in the popular press they were also seen as exceptional women who had little relation to the sex in general. Dress reformers asserted that liberty of body and mind were inseparable. Elizabeth Smith Miller, daughter of Gerrit Smith, brought dress reform to national attention in the spring of 1851 when she began to appear publicly in “Turkish trousers” (billowing pant legs that tapered to a tight fit around the ankles) and a skirt shortened to about four inches below the knee. She created a sensation because no necessity of physical labor precipitated her actions. Miller’s cousin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, joined her in wearing the reform dress, and their mutual friend, Amelia Jenkins Bloomer of Homer, New York, quickly embraced their actions. In the June 1851 issue of her temperance magazine, The Lily, Bloomer published an explicit argument about the physical dangers of conventional clothing: women’s dresses “distorted spines, compressed lungs, enlarged livers, and [resulted in] displacement of the whole abdominal viscera.” Because Bloomer had the power of the press in which to make her arguments, the new female attire quickly became known as the Bloomer dress, although many variations were created by reformers.4\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n19\n\nIn spite of cartoonists’ satire and condemnation from many newspaper editors, a significant movement for dress reform was born. Allopathic physicians largely insisted that women remain dressed in conventional clothing, but many eclectic, homeopathic, and hydropathic medical practitioners supported the new style for women. Most of the major figures in the suffrage movement donned the reform dress in these years. Two important advocates were Dr. Lydia Sayer, who began wearing a reform dress in 1849, and her soon-to-be husband, John S. Hasbrouck, of Middletown, New York. When The Lily ceased publication in 1856, Sayer and Hasbrouck were determined to continue the cause. On July 1, 1856, they published the first issue of The Sibyl: A Review of the Tastes, Errors and Fashions of Society, a periodical edited by Dr. Sayer and devoted primarily to dress reform. The idea of the journal was born at the first meeting of the Dress Reform Association (DRA), held in Glen Haven, New York, in February; The Sibyl became its official publication. Mary’s and Dr. Lydia Sayer Hasbrouck’s mutual commitment to medicine and dress reform formed a long-lasting bond for the two physicians, and Hasbrouck began to recruit Mary as a contributor to her publication. The pages of The Sibyl reflected both the publisher’s and the readers’ wide range of political interests. The Sibyl, like the DRA, was adamant that what constituted propriety for women in American culture was exactly what needed most to be reformed: “Resolved, That, in advocating Reform in Dress for Woman, our object is not to advocate for her positions of singularity, eccentricity, immodesty or to get her out of her ‘appropriate sphere;’ but to enable her to act with that freedom needful to find out what her ‘appropriate sphere’ is.”5 Well-known women who abandoned or criticized the dress reform movement were subject to considerable criticism from The Sibyl. The Bloomers had been quickly associated with exoticism, and Susan B. Anthony, Stanton, and Stone felt the extreme level of criticism they received for wearing the dress had martyred them for the cause. Suffragists confronted the same kind of attacks about their work for the vote, but clothing made it more personal, and there was a discomfort with the attention that the reform dress brought to their bodies. However, Mary and Lydia Hasbrouck believed that far more than appearance was at stake: clothing extended to all aspects of women’s equality. Anthony proclaimed during her advocacy of the reform dress, “I can see no business avocation, in which woman in her present dress can possibly earn equal wages with a man.” Thus when Hasbrouck reprimanded the women who were abandoning the movement for having so “little faith” and such a “lack of energy” for true reform, she was doing so in the belief that women’s full equality was being undermined.6 The journal engaged many other women’s rights issues as well. While Hasbrouck praised the very popular Fanny Fern for satirizing the latest fashions for women, she and her readers were quick to chide Fern for a satiric attack on women physicians. Fern denigrated the female physician as incapable of rationality and professionalism: “A female doctor! Great Esculapius! Before swallowing her pills (of which she would be the first), I should want to make sure that I had never\n\n20\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\ncome between her and a lover, or a new bonnet, or been the innocent recipient of a gracious smile from her husband.” In an editorial, Hasbrouck declared, “Fanny Fern has uttered many good thoughts on women and society, but a late dash of her pen on ‘Woman Physicians,’ should brand her forever as one to be scorned by her sex, and all true spirits seeking for society’s elevation and purification.” The challenges faced by women physicians were common subjects in the periodical from its inception. Women physicians interested in reform published letters and articles on a variety of subjects in The Sibyl, including conditions for women at coeducational and women’s medical colleges. Regular contributors included Dr. Fidelia R. Harris of Wisconsin; Dr. Ellen Beard of the Glen Haven Water Cure center in New York and editor of The Reformer (when she married in 1859, she and her spouse published their marriage protest in The Sibyl); and Dr. Harriet Austin of Dansville, New York, who would become president of the National Dress Reform Association (NDRA) in 1860. Mary’s involvement with organized dress reform afforded her many lifelong friends, especially other women physicians.7 The Sibyl contained poetry and occasionally fiction, but it was primarily a publication for the articulation of reform goals and thus essays and letters to the editor—often with extended responses from Hasbrouck—were its primary genres. The literary works related specifically to the ideals of reform, with poetry by wellknown figures such as Alice Cary and John Greenleaf Whittier. The integration of autobiographical narratives was common in the journal as a means of sharing the experience of wearing a reform dress. Anti-tobacco arguments, temperance, suffrage, and women’s economic disparity were also explored in the pages of The Sibyl. Hasbrouck wrote impassioned editorials against businesswomen’s taxation without representation, and in favor of going en masse to the polls attempting to register to vote as the best way to enact change.8 Writing did not come easily to Mary as a child, but her grandfather and father kept lifelong daily journals and she and her sisters were encouraged at a young age to do the same. Mary began her journal when she was quite new to the process of writing: “I was so small that I had not been attempting to write but a short time and when I wanted to read my journal over, I used to go to one of my sisters to decipher my writing parts of which I could not read myself. My mother was amused at this but I remember how she suppressed her smiles because she knew keeping such a journal I would improve my writing.” During the Civil War, Mary’s father would again encourage her to return to journal writing so her extraordinary experiences would not be lost to history. “I attempted to do [so] for a time,” she recalled, “but there was so much to be written and I was so weary that I abandoned it after a brief time.” Diary keeping may have been abandoned, but when it came to political writing and the reform causes to which she devoted her life, her pen flowed.9 Mary’s first contribution to The Sibyl in January 1857 was a brief letter to the editor confirming interest among residents of Rome and neighboring communities in the upcoming dress reform convention in Canastota. Although stiffly formal, the letter nonetheless reveals patterns in Mary’s style that would develop as she became\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n21\n\nmore experienced as a writer. Using the formal “we,” she reported, “We expect there will be a good attendance of those who are richly provided with common sense, intelligence, and decision of character” and that the convention would “tell well” for reformatory principles. Her second contribution to The Sibyl continued her role as reporter, this time covering the January 7 convention. She produced a detailed account of the gathering, its participants, and its evolving policies, including the agreement not to demand only one style of reform clothing. She had been one of the speakers, along with Gerrit Smith and others. Through her work for dress reform over the next few years, Mary came into contact with like-minded individuals who embraced multiple reform agendas. Some were old friends, such as Rev. Samuel J. May, Smith, and Stanton; others were new acquaintances, including Angelina Grimké. Hasbrouck was delighted to have recruited such a promising writer for the journal, and she added a note in the issue thanking Dr. Walker for her contributions and her efforts to increase The Sibyl’s circulation.10 During this year Mary also began a third part of her career that, like medicine and writing, would last until her death: lecturing. Her reputation as a dress reform lecturer spread quickly. Soon her own activities were the subject of reports in The Sibyl, where she was praised for her “very easy and graceful manner” and her “familiarity with the science connected with her profession.” Although this era also saw the beginning of public ridicule of her attire from newspaper editors, the positive responses to her lectures and the encouraging words of Hasbrouck and others were effective. She increased her lecturing schedule and began to submit short letter-articles to The Sibyl. Her first two contributions, “Synopsis of a Sermon, By Rev. A. S. Wightman” and “A Bloomer in the Street,” offered critiques of someone else’s argument. This format allowed Mary to develop her writing style and to hone her skills in argumentation. In the early months of 1859, Mary began to publish her own arguments on a variety of subjects, and for the first time, she used a strong and assertive “I.” She was able to balance a sense of outrage and injustice with a reasoned examination of motivations and solutions. For instance, in late 1858 Mary Morris Hamilton and other female managers of the Ladies’ Mount Vernon Association announced that they were using their $500,000 in funds to purchase and restore George Washington’s home. Women’s rights activists across the country were outraged that women would use such an enormous amount of money to further recognize a man who had been accorded innumerable honors rather than using it to aid the advancement of their own sex. Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote a letter of protest to Hamilton, urging her to use the money for women’s education. In February 1859, Mary published her analysis of the association’s decision. She too argued for the funds to go toward women’s education, adding that if Martha Washington could speak, “she would beg women not to rob themselves.” She suggested the money be used to erect “one grand national literary female college, where every opportunity for improvement could be afforded to women that is now given to men. This would indeed be an honor to the nation. . . . How much more noble to educate the immortal mind, to build intellectual monuments that are self-moving\n\n22\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nand progress, that cast no shadows of a somber hue, but shed a halo of light around them.” She found some solace in the situation, however, as the responses to the Association’s goal signified that women were agitating to find a means of directing their energy for the sex’s advancement.11 Mary learned her ideals not on the public stage but in that enlightened household on Bunker Hill Road. No better reminder of that fact could have been given to her than the letter to the editor that followed Mary’s article. It was written by her mother, who also wore the reform dress, and was titled to emphasize her own outrage—“Let your Women Keep Silent.” Vesta followed events that were unfolding in her hometown of Greenwich, Massachusetts, where a woman had recently stood during a Presbyterian prayer meeting and spoke about her faith. The “act was considered so sinful,” Vesta wrote, that the minister cancelled the meeting. Ironically, only days later the minister and male leaders of the church wondered how they might improve “the low state of religion.” One of the leaders suggested they encourage women to take an active part, but the idea was squelched by the minister, who asserted “that the Bible forbade women speaking in public!” Vesta’s letter reveals the spirit that nurtured her youngest daughter’s beliefs in the right to speak her mind.12 Mary’s next contribution to The Sibyl opened a new area of interest for her—the law. The sensational Sickles-Key murder trial engrossed the American public. In the early nineteenth century, reporting about murder trials was typically a twopronged process: exposing the horror of the events, and, most importantly, creating a sense of mystery around the idea of the crime itself. The mystery centered on the argument that murder was an incomprehensible act, one to which meaning could not be assigned because it was inhuman in and of itself. Thus murderers became moral monsters against which readers could assert their own normalcy. Mary would accept some of these premises—that someone who murdered another person was not representative of the common sinner but a moral aberration—yet like her sister women’s rights advocates, she challenged the idea that such crimes must be shrouded in mystery. Meaning could, indeed, be drawn from the act of murder when it was connected to the marriage relationship.13 On Sunday afternoon, February 27, 1859, Congressman Daniel Sickles shot Phillip Barton Key on the street in front of the Sickleses’ home in Washington, D.C. The congressman’s rage had been festering for weeks as he came to believe that his wife was having an affair with Key. The intrigue of a murder in response to a marital affair would have garnered sufficient press on its own, but the fact that Sickles was a congressman and that Key was the district attorney for the District of Columbia and son of Francis Scott Key inflamed public interest. Sickles’s attorney argued that his client could not be held responsible for his actions because he had been driven insane by his wife’s infidelity. This insanity claim became a point of national debate. As Harper’s Weekly observed, “the public ear, it seems, can not be satiated with details of the catastrophe.” Such reactions also justified feeding that appetite. The widely read weekly sympathized with Sickles and proclaimed, “the\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n23\n\npublic of the United States will justify him in killing the man who had dishonored his bed.” Such a case allowed for a salacious and titillating discussion of sexual relations, and Harper’s was willing to assume Mrs. Sickles’s guilt—“a fact of which it appears that there can be no doubt”—before the trial even began. In the weekly’s reports over a period of two months, Sickles was depicted as a gentleman whose actions were justified, who “maintained a very proper deportment,” and was a loving father. A few weeks later, two full pages were devoted to a flattering biography of the defendant.14 As the trial itself approached, the reportage moved from fervor to frenzy. In the early weeks of newspaper coverage, Teresa Bagioli Sickles received little attention from the press except as the fallen woman. Daniel Sickles obtained from his wife a written confession, but suspicious of the circumstances under which it was produced, the court refused to enter the document as evidence in the trial. However, it was printed the next day the National Police Gazette. Teresa Sickles purportedly confessed that the house in which she met with Key was owned by “a colored man,” which to a mainstream audience added to the immorality of her actions. The confession allegedly included such details as “I undressed myself. Mr. Key undressed also” and concluded with an acknowledgment that Daniel had given her “repeated orders” not to let Key visit when he was away from home. In spite of the court’s ruling that the confession was not evidence, defense references to it left the jury with no doubt that infidelity was the defendant’s justification for the murder. Finally, in May, the verdict was rendered: not guilty. It was the first successful insanity defense in U.S. courts. In reality, none of the participants was without blame. If Key’s reputation as a “ladies’ man” was made evident during the trial, Daniel Sickles’s was not. But after the verdict was recorded, even the supportive Harper’s ran an item decrying the exclusion of evidence of Sickles’s own infidelity. The prosecution certainly could have found any number of witnesses, since Daniel Sickles had been known to wander through the Albany Assembly chamber in company with a woman who ran a local bordello. As one diarist of the period remarked, “One might as well try to spoil a rotten egg, as to damage Dan’s character.”15 It was the double standard employed by the national press that compelled Mary to write an extensive analysis of the case. As Mary observed in her opening assessment of the “Sickles and Key Tragedy” in April 1859, “Much has been said concerning this lamentable tragedy, but in none of the quill parlances, have we seen any true sympathy manifested for Mrs. Sickles.” Mary was particularly disturbed by the ways in which women had joined in the chorus condemning Teresa Sickles. Where, she asked, is the hand of charity to “help her out of the moral ravine—not to sisterly say, that she might have been one of the brightest stars in the moral world, if she had been surrounded with a train of more favorable circumstances,” but neither to condemn solely. It was a carefully crafted argument, not condoning infidelity but pointing out that Teresa Sickles was emblematic of the cultural insistence that women were responsible for morality in U.S. society. As Mary’s critique of the condemnation of Teresa Sickles moved more broadly to woman’s situation\n\n24\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nin society, she mocked the censure of Sickles for breaking the oath to “‘love, honor, and obey’” her husband that had been expressed in a woman’s letter to the New York Express: “A woman advocating women being self bound life slaves to masters!” she exclaimed. Could anyone have been married so long that they would accept the idea of “an intelligent being [turned] into a chattel”? She also wondered why Daniel Sickles was not condemned for tyrannically demanding that his wife write out a confession and, especially, for then exposing her indiscretion to public view by giving the court and the press access to the document. If he did not care about the shame and infamy brought upon his wife, she asked, did he never think about the consequences for his daughter?16 Equally disturbing to Mary was the Express writer’s insistence that Teresa Sickles was “‘more culpable than Key, because she led him along.’” As a physician, Mary had insight into the diversity within marital relations, and it allowed her to argue that nothing suggested Teresa Sickles lured Key into an affair; one could just as well suggest that “the crime consequent upon Mrs. S. and Key’s intimacy, was one of force . . . and of threats of exposure afterwards.” In reality, the most likely scenario, given Daniel Sickles’s well-known record of extramarital affairs, was that “Key probably thought that it would be no worse for him to ruin the character of Mrs. S., and then boast of it, than it was for Sickles to boast of other conquests.” How, then, could Teresa Sickles be more culpable? “Never,” Mary wrote, “until women as a mass are better educated physiologically—until they are considered something besides a drudge or a doll—until they have all the social education and political advantages that men enjoy; in a word, equality with them, shall we consider vice in our sex any more culpable than in men.” The tragedy was not only that a murder was committed, but that women’s ignorance was celebrated: “I would that ladies who have no time to read had sense enough to throw aside their embroidery, and read Mental Philosophy, Moral Science, and Physiology; and then go to a smith’s and have their dressical and dietetical chains severed, that they may go forth free, sensible women, ‘slow to judge, and slower to despise.’” In this last twist, Mary brought her critique full circle: the letter-writer to the Express, had she been educated to true knowledge instead of to patriarchal bondage, would not condemn Teresa Sickles but would offer charitable sympathy, and work to see that other women did not fall prey to an education that sees charm as woman’s greatest attribute. She signed the article, “Yours in charity for our own sex.”17 Mary believed marriage was a sacred commitment, but she held liberal ideas about the need for equality in marriage and did not believe that it could only be sanctified by a church ceremony. In August 1858, for instance, she and Albert hosted an unconventional wedding in their home in Rome. Lucretia Bradley, “the far famed aeronaut” and lecturer on phrenology from New London, Connecticut, married Algernon Sidney Hubbell, a well-known orator from New Haven. It was a “Friend’s ceremony,” but the couple was “married, by themselves.” Supporting the Bradley-Hubbell ceremony signified Mary’s belief that marriage was a personal endeavor and not one to be regulated by the state. She also was interested in other\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n25\n\nwomen who led unconventional lives, including Lola Montez (1821–1861). Montez was widely known as a dancer and as mistress of Bavaria’s Ludwig I. She toured the United States in the early 1850s and shocked San Franciscans when she performed the erotic “Spider Dance.” Mary owned a copy of the Lectures of Lola Montez, Including Her Autobiography. In some ways the two women could not have been more different—Montez lived primarily off her beauty and Walker her intellect—but Mary had just embarked on her own career as a lecturer and may have hoped to draw guidance on what appealed to Montez’s audiences. She appreciated that Montez discussed an “intellectual kind of beauty” as well as physical. Montez talked about “preposterous fashion” and bewailed the popular but “health-destroying bodice,” asserting that fashion should be to “preserve the health of the human form.” Mary may well have felt that the text spoke directly to her, as Montez used the generic name of “Mary” to describe the growth and maturation of a woman from her teens to adulthood. Montez’s attention to “Heroines of History” appealed to all women who were attempting to advance women’s causes, but her account of George Sand undoubtedly drew Mary’s ardent attention, especially since Montez understood that Sand wore pants “from no mere caprice or waywardness of character, but for the reason that in this garb she is enabled to go where she pleases.” Sand was described as a highly intelligent woman who talked earnestly on great subjects, and it must have thrilled Mary when Montez remarked on Sand as a representative of women reformers’ search for freedom of mind and body: “like most of the reformers of the present day, especially if it is her misfortune to be a woman, is a target placed in a conspicuous position to be shot at by all dark unenlightened human beings, who may have peculiar motives for restraining the progress of mind; but it is as absurd in this glorious nineteenth century, to attempt to destroy freedom of thought, and the sovereignty of the individual, as it is to stop the falls of Niagara.”18 Mary refused to remain silent about issues that were supposed to be too “delicate” for women but which impacted their lives in the most intimate and life-changing ways, including pregnancies of unmarried women and abortion. She published two substantial commentaries in August and September of 1859 calling for the building of a state-run foundling hospital. She called on The Sibyl’s readership, in support of their unmarried sisters and the children they bore, to pledge funds and thereby demonstrate to the state the need for its cooperation in the project. Although the essays were subtitled “A Hastily Written Whisper to Every Woman,” the publication and frank discussion of the topic was anything but a “whisper.” Citing poet Bayard Taylor’s remark on New Yorkers’ conservatism, “If some benevolent millionaire should propose to building [a foundling hospital] in New York, pulpit and press would ridicule with the red hot shot of holy indignation,” Mary agreed, but added, “we cannot believe that the intelligent, the noble, the philanthropic powers of the press, that sway the world of mind, will come out against what their extensive knowledge of the necessities of the world demands.” It only hurts the children of unmarried parents and encourages criminal acts such as abortion when Americans try to ignore the fact that “the world is as it is,” she declared.19\n\n26\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nNew York State laws, which Mary cited, allowed abortions in two instances—if it “shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such woman, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose.” Although the law prohibited physicians from any act that would “produce miscarriage,” Mary observed, women were going to find a way to have an abortion “regardless of future consequences, while there is no provision made for her, where her misfortune may not be maliciously published to an unsympathetic world,” unless alternatives such as a foundling hospital became available. She was treading into dangerous territory. For decades, the term “female physician” had been used to refer to abortionists; the most notorious female abortionist, Madame Restell (Caroline Lohman), was from Mary’s home state. Lohman was brought to trial in the 1840s in a case that drew wide public attention and made the connection between women healers and abortionists prevalent in the public mind. When women in the 1850s sought to attend medical colleges, critics often charged that they were simply attempting to become abortionists. But Mary’s concerns about abortion and its often dangerous consequences for women were well founded. Since legitimate physicians were barred by law from performing safe abortions, women had only unlicensed and sometimes incompetent abortionists to turn to for aid—and they were doing so in significant numbers. Abortion had become epidemic in America by the 1850s; in New York City, stillbirths and abortions had increased in the last decade by 140 percent. Following the beliefs of the day, Mary asserted that children born outside of marriage were prone to a life of poverty and crime; but she sought to change cultural attitudes. Instead of seeing these women as sisters who need sympathy and assistance, she observed, women are restricted by cultural attitudes that condemn both the respectable and the “fallen” woman. “Can it be,” she asked, “that an intelligent woman fears ‘the world’s cold frown’ in doing a humanity deed? . . . Could all of the infanticides, the abortions, the poisoning of other men’s wives, and the innumerable wrongs resulting from what a Foundling Hospital would prevent, be presented to the reader, what a long list one year would show in the State of N.Y. alone!” To change circumstances, she directed readers to support the construction of a foundling home. Mary’s understanding of these issues was crafted on the medical battlefield, and her comments in this article are revealing of the life of a woman physician at mid-century: Few see into the heart of society unveiled as the physician does, and it is impossible for any one to do so as unmistakably, as a female physician. There are no class of persons that are confided in as the physicians are. Thousands of people believe that all their thoughts and acts are unmistakably read by doctors, and the physician is priest before whom more confessions are made, than before any ordained divine. More confessions are made to physicians, than even to deity. The very whisperings of conscience meets the physician’s ears.20\n\nIn September Mary published a second article on the subject. Responses were forthcoming in “quite a number” from women who were willing to serve as agents.\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n27\n\nThis is “emphatically ‘woman’s sphere,’” she declared, suggesting that subscriptions could be increased by a systematic organizing of their actions. “Each town or city agent can appoint assistant agents, in other wards or school districts, thus expediting the matter, so that the state may easily be canvassed by the first of January. All Ladies’ Societies should be called upon, and solicited to pledge themselves to furnish a certain number of articles for bedding.” Undoubtedly Mary envisioned herself as physician and director of the hospital. It was not only a cause dear to her heart; it was typical of the ways in which early women physicians found the means to successfully survive and perhaps even prosper in their chosen profession. Mary would have been well aware of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children that Drs. Elizabeth and Emily Blackwell founded just two years earlier. To establish a hospital of her own would have given Mary that same possibility for success, and it was the first of several such institutions she would attempt to establish throughout her career. The foundling hospital was never brought to fruition, partly because of lack of support from the state and partly from two events that were simmering and about to radically change Mary’s life: explosive revelations about her own marital relations, and the impending Civil War, which would require all of the state’s and the country’s money to support.21\n\nIn the summer of 1859 notes in The Sibyl from Dr. Hasbrouck to Mary began to suggest that she was not meeting deadlines, and she was suddenly absent from dress reform conventions. Part of her new-found sense of self certainly came from her successful public activities, but it was also shaped by her private endurances. In March 1860, Mary placed a notice in the Rome Sentinel announcing the relocation of her medical office to 48 Dominick Street, above Shelly’s Clothing Store: “The Doctor expresses her gratitude to the Romans for their liberal patronage, and solicits a continuance of the same.” The newspaper’s editor added words of support, “Those who prefer the skill of a female physician to that of a male, have now an excellent opportunity to make their choice.”22 Months earlier Mary was devastated to discover that her husband was involved with at least one other woman. She confronted Albert about his “vileness” and demanded a divorce. Unrepentant, he suggested she forgo a divorce and claim “the same privileges” of extramarital relationships. Angry and humiliated, she insisted he leave. Mary’s brother-in-law L. J. Worden arrived at the house just as the scene was unfolding. As Albert dashed past Worden and into his carriage, he told Worden, “in a meaning and mean manner” as Worden discerned it, to attend to Mary. When Worden entered the house, Mary was weeping, filled with pain and outrage at Albert’s infidelity and open-marriage proposition. She told Worden in this moment of rare openness about her marriage “that people who thought her so happy knew little of her wretchedness.”23 She was determined to obtain a divorce while maintaining her professional life. Even in her smaller offices, the first few months of operation cost her more than\n\n28\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nshe took in because of the expenses incurred in moving and in purchasing supplies. Over the next few years she would discover, through reports from independent court-appointed referees, that Albert had numerous affairs, fathered at least one child with another woman, was arrested for seducing a female patient, and generally led a life of debauchery, all the while maintaining his community standing as a physician. Although they were now living separately, Albert would haunt Mary’s life and thwart her attempts for a divorce for the next nine years. In 1860 New York State’s divorce laws were among the most restrictive in the nation. Only adultery was accepted as a basis, and the costs of filing were repressive. Although legal, divorce was still a social disgrace, even among many women’s rights activists. But Mary was determined.24 In spite of her personal difficulties, Mary attended the NDRA convention in Waterloo in May. Had her personal situation been different at this point, she would likely have risen to the presidency of the organization, as she was already a vice president and was asked at the evening session to take the chair in the current president’s absence. She offered input on the resolutions and business policies of the association, but she declined to take the chair even in a temporary capacity. She was already planning to leave the state, and her participation in the organization she loved had to wait until she could sever her relationship with Albert. She had the necessary grounds for divorce in New York; yet Mary knew that the state required a five-year waiting period before a granted divorce became final. She decided to try to expedite matters. In 1843 Iowa had revised its laws to authorize a divorce when “it is apparent to the satisfaction of the Court that the parties cannot live in peace or happiness together, and that their welfare requires a separation between them.” Believing she met the standards and hoping quickly to end all connections to Albert, Mary left her medical practice in Rome and her burgeoning career as writer and lecturer and moved to Delhi, Iowa. She resided with the House family, old friends who had lived in Oswego. A. E. House was a lawyer and judge, and he generously advised Mary on Iowa laws. The editor of the Delhi newspaper, who wrote an editorial in support of her reform dress after the nearby Dubuque press satirized her attire, asked her to write an article for the paper, but when she produced details of her “own doings,” as he put it, he refused to publish it. No woman, he believed, could at the age of twenty-seven have been a teacher, medical student, physician, and dress reform lecturer.25 Deciding to use this time for self-improvement, in the fall of 1860 she enrolled at the newly founded Bowen Collegiate Institute in nearby Hopkinton with the goal of studying German. She had begun teaching herself German while in Rome and now wished for advanced study. But the institute was foundering financially. Although it had advertised German as an area of study and accepted her enrollment fees, there was no one to teach the course. Mary threatened to take Bowen to court if they did not offer the course as advertised and, perhaps worse for the struggling school, let it be known publicly that they could not fulfill their promises. It was the kind of insistence on rightful actions Mary would always take in such\n\nDress Reform and The Sibyl\n\n29\n\nsituations; but at this moment in her life she was tired of feeling she had been misled and her anger boiled over. As a reprieve from the tension of her dispute with the administration, Mary attended an evening meeting of a debate society organized by several young men in Hopkinton. She thoroughly enjoyed the debates and asked at the end of the session to become a member. A vote was called, and she easily won admission. She was also invited to participate in the debate scheduled for the following week. When Bowen’s director of women students, Miss Cooley, heard about the evening’s events, she ordered Mary not to participate in the forthcoming debate. It was ludicrous, Mary felt, for the school to attempt to control her evening hours, so she ignored the charge and participated in the debate. The moment would have passed without notice if Cooley had not insisted that Mary be suspended from the institute for disobeying her direct order. It was a power struggle between two strong wills. This time Mary had met her match.26 When publicly informed of her suspension, Mary gathered her belongings and left, and most of the young men left with her. They quickly decided to make a blatant protest. Forming a procession with Mary in the lead, they marched through several downtown streets, garnering exactly the attention they hoped to receive. The result was that the men were also suspended. They soon asked to return, however, and insisted Mary be able to join them. Cooley refused; the men returned, but Mary was expelled. It was not a trivial issue for Mary. She was already a paid lecturer, she had followed the bylaws of the organization and been admitted by its members, and therefore the denial of her right to participate was unjust. It was the first of many public protests over denial of women’s rights that Mary would initiate in her lifetime. In the end she may have been expelled, but she gained a small group of supporters in the community. Waiting for the divorce to progress, she was pleased to be able to work occasionally with a local physician, Dr. Cunningham, but it was a frustrating time at best.27 In spite of the new laws of Iowa, Mary did not receive a divorce decree in the state. While living in Delhi, she corresponded with B. F. Chapman, an attorney in Rome. She had not told Chapman when she left Rome that she intended to seek a divorce, but she eventually revealed her plans to him. He responded quickly by sending her a five-page abstract of recent New York State divorce case decisions. As Mary quickly realized, the state courts had repeatedly refused to accept outof-state divorces. Chapman was a trusted friend, and she heeded his suggestions. Painful as it was, the education in legal matters that accompanied Mary’s drawnout divorce proceedings served her well in the future. For now, she packed her bags and returned to New York.28\n\nOnly months before her separation from Albert, Mary published “Women Soldiers” in The Sibyl. It would be her last article in the magazine for nearly eighteen months. By September 1859 when the article appeared, the country knew it was moving toward war. John Brown’s raid on the federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry in\n\n30\n\nD r . M a ry Wa l k e r\n\nOctober and his subsequent hanging would be a critical turning point toward war for Northerners. Dr. Hasbrouck began to use her editorial power to speak out in favor of abolition in The Sibyl as well. The timeliness of Mary’s article coincided with ongoing discussions in the magazine and on the lecture plat"
