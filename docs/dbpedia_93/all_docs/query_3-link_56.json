        "text": "Michael R Burch Apr 2020\n\nAn Illusion\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe sky was as hushed as the breath of a bee\n\nand the world was bathed in shades of palest gold\n\nwhen I awoke.\n\nShe came to me with the sound of falling leaves\n\nand the scent of new-mown grass;\n\nI held out my arms to her and she passed\n\ninto oblivion ...\n\nThis is one of my early poems, written around age 16 and published in my high school literary journal, The Lantern. Keywords/Tags: early poems, Juvenilia, illusion, illusory, dream, mirage, morning, fantasy, awakening, waking up, oblivion\n\nThe following poems are other early poems and juvenilia by Michael R. Burch ...\n\nSmoke\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe hazy, smoke-filled skies of summer I remember well;\n\nfarewell was on my mind, and the thoughts that I can't tell\n\nrang bells within (the din was in) my mind, and I can't say\n\nif what we had was good or bad, or where it is today.\n\nThe endless days of summer's haze I still recall today;\n\nshe spoke and smoky skies stood still as summer slipped away ...\n\nI wrote this early poem around age 14 and it appeared in my high school journal, the Lantern. It also appeared in my college literary journal, Homespun. It has since been published by The Eclectic Muse (Canada), Fullosia Press and Better Than Starbucks, and translated into Romanian and published by Petru Dimofte. I find it interesting that I was able to write a \"rhyme rich\" poem at such a young age. In six lines the poem has 26 rhymes and near rhymes.\n\nLeave Taking\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nBrilliant leaves abandon\n\nbattered limbs\n\nto waltz upon ecstatic winds\n\nuntil they die.\n\nBut the barren and embittered trees\n\nlament the frolic of the leaves\n\nand curse the bleak\n\nNovember sky.\n\nNow, as I watch the leaves'\n\nhigh flight\n\nbefore the fading autumn light,\n\nI think that, perhaps, at last I may\n\nhave learned what it means to say\n\ngoodbye.\n\nThere is a sequel, \"Leave Taking II,\" at the bottom of this page. \"Leave Taking\" has been published by The Lyric, Borderless Journal (Singapore), Mindful of Poetry, Glass Facets of Poetry and Silver Stork Magazine.\n\nStyx\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nBlack waters,\n\ndeep and dark and still...\n\nall men have passed this way,\n\nor will.\n\n\"Styx\" has been published by The Lyric, Poezii (in a Romanian translation by Petru Dimofte), The Raintown Review, Blue Unicorn, Brief Poems and Artvilla. Not too shabby for a teenage poem.\n\nExcerpt from \"Jessamyn's Song\"\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBy the window ledge where the candle begs\n\nthe night for light to live,\n\nthe deepening darkness gives\n\nthe heart good cause to shudder.\n\nFor there are curly, tousled heads\n\nthat know one use for bed\n\nand not any other.\n\n\"Goodnight father.\"\n\n\"Goodnight mother.\"\n\n\"Goodnight sister.\"\n\n\"Goodnight brother.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow new adventures\n\nwe surely shall discover!\"\n\n\"Jessamyn's Song\" was a long poem I wrote in my early teens about a relationship that began when a boy and girl were very young and lasted into \"old age.\" At the time I wrote the poem, forty seemed to be beyond superannuated, so I believe I killed off the hero at that ripe old age.\n\nSarjann\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhat did I ever do\n\nto make you hate me so?\n\nI was only nine years old,\n\nlonely and afraid,\n\na small stranger in a large land.\n\nWhy did you abuse me\n\nand taunt me?\n\nEven now, so many years later,\n\nthe question still haunts me:\n\nwhat did I ever do?\n\nWhy did you despise me and reject me,\n\npushing and shoving me around\n\nwhen there was no one to protect me?\n\nWhy did you draw a line\n\nin the bone-dry autumn dust,\n\ndaring me to cross it?\n\nDid you want to see me cry?\n\nWell, if you did, you did.\n\n... oh, leave me alone,\n\nfor the sky opens wide\n\nin a land of no rain,\n\nand who are you\n\nto bring me such pain? ...\n\nThis is a \"true poem\" in the sense of being about the \"real me.\" I had a bad experience with an older girl named Sarjann (or something like that), who used to taunt me and push me around at a bus stop in Roseville, California (the \"large land\" of \"no rain\" where I was a \"small stranger\" because I only lived there for a few months). I believe this poem was written around age 16, but could have been written earlier. There was more to the poem, but I decided to shorten it.\n\nMyth\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nafter Dylan Thomas\n\nHere the recalcitrant wind\n\nsighs with grievance and remorse\n\nover fields of wayward gorse\n\nand thistle-throttled lanes.\n\nAnd she is the myth of the scythed wheat\n\nhewn and sighing, complete,\n\nwaiting, lain in a low sheaf—\n\nfull of faith, full of grief.\n\nHere the immaculate dawn\n\nrequires belief of the leafed earth\n\nand she is the myth of the mown grain—\n\ngolden and humble in all its weary worth.\n\nPublished by There is Something in the Autumn (an anthology) and picked as the best poem in a Dylan Thomas poetry contest by the contest’s sponsor and judge, Vatsala Radhakeesoon.\n\nThe Leveler\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nThe nature of Nature\n\nis bitter survival\n\nfrom Winter’s bleak fury\n\ntill Spring’s brief revival.\n\nThe weak implore Fate;\n\nbold men ravish, dishevel her ...\n\ntill both are cut down\n\nby mere ticks of the Leveler.\n\nPublished by The Lyric, The Aurorean, Tucumcari Literary Review, Romantics Quarterly and in a YouTube video by Asma Masooma\n\nRegret\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19-20\n\nRegret,\n\na bitter\n\nache to bear . . .\n\nonce starlight\n\nlanguished\n\nin your hair . . .\n\na shining there\n\nas brief\n\nas rare.\n\nRegret,\n\na pain\n\nI chose to bear . . .\n\nunleash\n\nthe torrent\n\nof your hair . . .\n\nand show me\n\nonce again—\n\nhow rare.\n\nPublished by The Chained Muse\n\nObservance\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nHere the hills are old, and rolling\n\ncarefully in their old age;\n\non the horizon youthful mountains\n\nbathe themselves in windblown fountains...\n\nBy dying leaves and falling raindrops,\n\nI have traced time's starts and stops,\n\nand I have known the years to pass\n\nalmost unnoticed, whispering through treetops...\n\nFor here the valleys fill with sunlight\n\nto the brim, then empty again,\n\nand it seems that only I notice\n\nhow the years flood out, and in...\n\nI wrote this early poem as a teenager, around age 17, in a McDonald's break room. It was the first poem that made me feel like a \"real\" poet. \"Observance\" was originally titled \"Reckoning\" and it was was one of my earliest poems to be published. \"Observance/Reckoning\" has been published by Nebo, Romantics Quarterly, The Chained Muse, Piedmont Literary Review, Tucumcari Literary Review, Borderless Journal (Singapore) and in the Borderless Journal anthology Monalisa No Longer Smiles and the anthology There Is Something in the Autumn.\n\nInfinity\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nHave you tasted the bitterness of tears of despair?\n\nHave you watched the sun sink through such pale, balmless air\n\nthat your soul sought its shell like a crab on a beach,\n\nthen scuttled inside to be safe, out of reach?\n\nMight I lift you tonight from earth's wreckage and damage\n\non these waves gently rising to pay the moon homage?\n\nOr better, perhaps, let me say that I, too,\n\nhave dreamed of infinity... windswept and blue.\n\nThis is the second poem that made me feel like a \"real\" poet. \"Infinity\" has been published by Setu (India), Borderless Journal (Singapore), New Lyre, The Chained Muse, Penny Dreadful, Songs of Innocence, Artvilla and Lone Stars.\n\nSmoke\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nThe hazy, smoke-filled skies of summer I remember well;\n\nfarewell was on my mind, and the thoughts that I can't tell\n\nrang bells within (the din was in) my mind, and I can't say\n\nif what we had was good or bad, or where it is today...\n\nThe endless days of summer's haze I still recall today;\n\nshe spoke and smoky skies stood still as summer slipped away...\n\nI wrote this early poem around age 14 after seeing the ad for the movie \"Summer of '42\" starring a young Jacqueline Bisset. \"Smoke\" appeared in my high school journal, the Lantern, and my college journal, Homespun. It has since been published by The Eclectic Muse (Canada), Poezii (in a Romanian translation by Petru Dimofte), Potcake Chapbooks (UK), Love Poems and Poets, Better Than Starbucks and Fullosia Press.\n\nIn the Whispering Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky\n\nas the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our husks into some savage ocean\n\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze:\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the heights of awareness from which we were seized.\n\nPublished by Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly, Poetry Life & Times, The Chained Muse and New Lyre\n\nMoon Lake\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nStarlit recorder of summer nights,\n\nwhat magic spell bewitches you?\n\nThey say that all lovers love first in the dark . . .\n\nIs it true?\n\nIs it true?\n\nIs it true?\n\nUncanny seer of all that appears\n\nand all that has appeared . . .\n\nwhat sights have you seen,\n\nwhat dreams have you dreamed,\n\nwhat rhetoric have you heard?\n\nIs love an oration or is it a word?\n\nHave you heard?\n\nHave you heard?\n\nHave you heard?\n\n\"Moon Lake\" was published by Romantics Quarterly, then set to music by David Hamilton and performed by the Australian choir Choralation. This early poem dates to around age 14 and was part of a longer poem, \"Jessamyn's Song.\"\n\nListen\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nListen to me now and heed my voice;\n\nI am a madman, alone, screaming in the wilderness,\n\nbut listen now.\n\nListen to me now, and if I say\n\nthat black is black, and white is white, and in between lies gray,\n\nI have no choice.\n\nDoes a madman choose his words? They come to him,\n\nthe moon’s illuminations, intimations of the wind,\n\nand he must speak.\n\nBut listen to me now, and if you hear\n\nthe tolling of the judgment bell, and if its tone is clear,\n\nthen do not tarry,\n\nbut listen, or cut off your ears, for I Am weary.\n\nPublished by Penny Dreadful, Formal Verse, The HyperTexts, the Anthologise Committee and Nonsuch High School for Girls (Surrey, England)\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant...\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n—feverish, wet—\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union...\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nSomething\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nfor the children of the Holocaust and the Nakba\n\nSomething inescapable is lost—\n\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\n\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\n\nimmeasurable and void.\n\nSomething uncapturable is gone—\n\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\n\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\n\nand remembrance.\n\nSomething unforgettable is past—\n\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\n\nwhich denial has swept into a corner... where it lies\n\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\n\nOriginally published in the anthology There is Something in the Autumn, then turned into a YouTube video by Lillian Y. Wong and published by Poezii in a Romanian translation by Petru Dimofte, \"Something\" is the first poem I wrote that didn't rhyme.\n\nElegy for a little girl, lost\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\n... qui laetificat juventutem meam...\n\nShe was the joy of my youth,\n\nand now she is gone\n\n.... requiescat in pace...\n\nMay she rest in peace\n\n.... amen...\n\nAmen.\n\nThis was my first translation, after I found the Latin prayer while sneak-reading one of my sister's historical romance novels.\n\nThe Toast\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nFor longings warmed by tepid suns\n\n(brief lusts that animated clay),\n\nfor passions wilted at the bud\n\nand skies grown desolate and grey,\n\nfor stars that fell from tinseled heights\n\nand mountains bleak and scarred and lone,\n\nfor seas reflecting distant suns\n\nand weeds that thrive where seeds were sown,\n\nfor waltzes ending in a hush,\n\nfor rhymes that fade as pages close,\n\nfor flames’ exhausted, drifting ash\n\nand petals falling from the rose ...\n\nI raise my cup before I drink,\n\nsaluting ghosts of loves long dead,\n\nand silently propose a toast—\n\nto joys set free, and those I fled.\n\nOriginally published by Contemporary Rhyme\n\nWinter\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nThe rose of love’s bright promise\n\nlies torn by her own thorn;\n\nher scent was sweet\n\nbut at her feet\n\nthe pallid aphids mourn.\n\nThe lilac of devotion\n\nhas felt the winter ****\n\nand shed her dress;\n\ncompanionless,\n\nshe shivers—****, forlorn.\n\nPublished by Songs of Innocence, The Aurorean and Contemporary Rhyme. \"Winter\" was inspired and influenced by William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose.\"\n\nShakespeare’s Sonnet 130 Refuted\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;\n\nCoral is far more red than her lips' red ...\n\n— Shakespeare, Sonnet 130\n\nSeas that sparkle in the sun\n\nwithout its light would have no beauty;\n\nbut the light within your eyes\n\nis theirs alone; it owes no duty.\n\nWhose winsome flame, not half so bright,\n\nis meant for me, and brings delight.\n\nCoral formed beneath the sea,\n\nthough scarlet-tendriled, cannot warm me;\n\nwhile your lips, not half so red,\n\njust touching mine, at once inflame me.\n\nWhose scorching flames mild lips arouse\n\nfathomless oceans fail to douse.\n\nBright roses’ brief affairs, declared\n\nwhen winter comes, will wither quickly.\n\nYour cheeks, though paler when compared\n\nwith them?—more lasting, never prickly.\n\nWhose tender cheeks, so enchantingly warm,\n\nfar vaster treasures, harbor no thorns.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly. I composed this poem in my head as a college freshman, as I walked back to my dorm from an English class where I had read Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 130.” This was my first attempt at a sonnet, but I dispensed with the rules, as has always been my wont.\n\nAm I\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14-15\n\nAm I inconsequential;\n\ndo I matter not at all?\n\nAm I just a snowflake,\n\nto sparkle, then to fall?\n\nAm I only chaff?\n\nOf what use am I?\n\nAm I just a feeble flame,\n\nto flicker, then to die?\n\nAm I inadvertent?\n\nFor what reason am I here?\n\nAm I just a ripple\n\nin a pool that once was clear?\n\nAm I insignificant?\n\nWill time pass me by?\n\nAm I just a flower,\n\nto live one day, then die?\n\nAm I unimportant?\n\nDo I matter either way?\n\nOr am I just an echo—\n\nsoon to fade away?\n\nThis is one of my very earliest poems; if I remember correctly, it was written the same day as “Time,” which appeared in my high school sophomore poetry assignment booklet. If not, it was a companion piece written around the same time. The refrain “Am I” is an inversion of the biblical “I Am” supposedly given to Moses as the name of God. I was around 14 or 15 when I wrote the two poems.\n\nTime\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14-15\n\nTime,\n\nwhere have you gone?\n\nWhat turned out so short,\n\nhad seemed like so long.\n\nTime,\n\nwhere have you flown?\n\nWhat seemed like mere days\n\nwere years come and gone.\n\nTime,\n\nsee what you've done:\n\nfor now I am old,\n\nwhen once I was young.\n\nTime,\n\ndo you even know why\n\nyour days, minutes, seconds\n\npreternaturally fly?\n\n\"Time\" is a companion piece to \"Am I.\" It appeared in my high school project notebook \"Poems\" along with \"Playmates,\" so I was probably around 14 or 15 when I wrote it. This seems like a pretty well-crafted poem for a teenage poet just getting started. \"Time\" and \"Am I\" were written on the same day, or within a short period of time, if I remember correctly. They were among the earliest of what I call my \"I Am\" and \"Am I\" poems.\n\nRighteous\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16-18\n\nCome to me tonight\n\nin the twilight, O, and the full moon rising,\n\nspectral and ancient, will mutter a prayer.\n\nGather your hair\n\nand pin it up, knowing\n\nI will release it a moment anon.\n\nWe are not one,\n\nnor is there a scripture\n\nto sanctify nights you might spend in my arms,\n\nbut the swarms\n\nof bright stars revolving above us\n\nrevel tonight, the most ardent of lovers.\n\nPublished by Writer’s Gazette, Tucumcari Literary Review and The Chained Muse\n\nR.I.P.\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nWhen I am lain to rest\n\nand my soul is no longer intact,\n\nbut dissolving, like a sunset\n\ndiminishing to the west, ...\n\nand when at last\n\nbefore His throne my past\n\nis put to test\n\nand the demons and the Beast\n\nawait to feast\n\non any morsel downward cast,\n\nwhile the vapors of impermanence\n\ncling, smelling of damask ...\n\nthen let me go, and do not weep\n\nif I am left to sleep,\n\nto sleep and never dream, or dream, perhaps,\n\nonly a little longer and more deep.\n\nPublished by Romantics Quarterly and The Chained Muse. This is an early poem from my “Romantic Period” that was written in my late teens.\n\nHave I been too long at the fair?\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 15\n\nHave I been too long at the fair?\n\nThe summer has faded,\n\nthe leaves have turned brown,\n\nthe Ferris wheel teeters,\n\nnot up, yet not down...\n\nHave I been too long at the fair?\n\nThis is one of my earliest poems, written around age 15.\n\nBound,\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nNow it is winter—the coldest night.\n\nAnd as the light of the streetlamp casts strange shadows to the ground,\n\nI have lost what I once found\n\nin your arms.\n\nNow it is winter—the coldest night.\n\nAnd as the light of distant Venus fails to penetrate dark panes,\n\nI have remade all my chains\n\nand am bound.\n\nPublished as “Why Did I Go?” in the Lantern in 1976. I have made slight changes here and there, but the poem is essentially the same as what I wrote around age 14.\n\nBible Libel\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 11-13\n\nIf God\n\nis good\n\nhalf the Bible\n\nis libel.\n\nI read the Bible from cover to cover at age eleven, ten chapters per day, at the suggestion of my devout Christian parents. I wrote this poem to express my conclusion about the bizarre behavior of the biblical god Yahweh/Jehovah . This was my first poem, as far as I can remember, although I considered it more of an observation at the time.\n\nDavenport Tomorrow\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nDavenport tomorrow ...\n\nall the trees stand stark-naked in the sun.\n\nNow it is always summer\n\nand the bees buzz in cesspools,\n\nadapted to a new life.\n\nThere are no flowers,\n\nbut the weeds, being hardier,\n\nhave survived.\n\nThe small town has become\n\na city of millions;\n\nthere is no longer a sea,\n\nonly a huge sewer,\n\nbut the children don't mind.\n\nThey still study\n\nrocks and stars,\n\nbut biology is a forgotten science ...\n\nafter all, what is life?\n\nDavenport tomorrow ...\n\nall the children murmur through vein-streaked gills\n\nwhispered wonders of long-ago.\n\nPublished by Borderless Journal\n\nEarthbound\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nTashunka Witko, better known as Crazy Horse, had a vision of a red-tailed hawk at Sylvan Lake, South Dakota. In his vision he saw himself riding a spirit horse, flying through a storm, as the hawk flew above him, shrieking. When he awoke, a red-tailed hawk was perched near his horse.\n\nEarthbound,\n\nand yet I now fly\n\nthrough these clouds that are aimlessly drifting ...\n\nso high\n\nthat no sound\n\nechoing by\n\nbelow where the mountains are lifting\n\nthe sky\n\ncan be heard.\n\nLike a bird,\n\nbut not meek,\n\nlike a hawk from a distance regarding its prey,\n\nI will shriek,\n\nnot a word,\n\nbut a screech,\n\nand my terrible clamor will turn them to clay—\n\nthe sheep,\n\nthe earthbound.\n\nPublished by Boston Poetry Magazine, Native American Indian Pride and Native American Poems, Prayers and Stories\n\nHuntress\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nafter Baudelaire\n\nLynx-eyed, cat-like and cruel, you creep\n\nacross a crevice dropping deep\n\ninto a dark and doomed domain.\n\nYour claws are sheathed. You smile, insane.\n\nRain falls upon your path, and pain\n\npours down. Your paws are pierced. You pause\n\nand heed the oft-lamented laws\n\nwhich bid you not begin again\n\ntill night returns. You wail like wind,\n\nthe sighing of a soul for sin,\n\nand give up hunting for a heart.\n\nTill sunset falls again, depart,\n\nthough hate and hunger urge you—On!\n\nHeed, hearts, your hope—the break of dawn.\n\nPublished by The HyperTexts and Sonnetto Poesia (Canada)\n\nBurn, Ovid\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14-43\n\n“Burn Ovid”—Austin Clarke\n\nSunday School,\n\nFaith Free Will Baptist, 1973:\n\nI sat imagining watery folds\n\nof pale silk encircling her waist.\n\nExplicit *** was the day’s “hot” topic\n\n(how breathlessly I imagined hers)\n\nas she taught us the perils of lust\n\nfraught with inhibition.\n\nI found her unaccountably beautiful,\n\nrolling implausible nouns off the edge of her tongue:\n\nadultery, fornication, *******, ******.\n\nActs made suddenly plausible by the faint blush\n\nof her unrouged cheeks,\n\nby her pale lips\n\naccented only by a slight quiver,\n\na trepidation.\n\nWhat did those lustrous folds foretell\n\nof our uncommon desire?\n\nWhy did she cross and uncross her legs\n\nlovely and long in their taupe sheaths?\n\nWhy did her ******* rise pointedly,\n\nas if indicating a direction?\n\n“Come unto me,\n\n(unto me),”\n\ntogether, we sang,\n\ncheek to breast,\n\nlips on lips,\n\ndevout, afire,\n\nmy hands\n\nup her skirt,\n\nher pants at her knees:\n\nall night long,\n\nall night long,\n\nin the heavenly choir.\n\n“*** 101” and “Burn, Ovid” were written about my experiences during ninth grade at Faith Christian Academy, circa age 14-15 in 1972-1973. However, these poems were not completed until 2001 and are in a more mature voice and style than most of my other early poems.\n\n*** 101\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14-43\n\nThat day the late spring heat\n\nsteamed through the windows of a Crayola-yellow schoolbus\n\ncrawling its way up the backwards slopes\n\nof Nowheresville, North Carolina ...\n\nWhere we sat exhausted\n\nfrom the day’s skulldrudgery\n\nand the unexpected waves of muggy,\n\nsummer-like humidity ...\n\nGiggly first graders sat two abreast\n\nbehind senior high students\n\nsprouting their first sparse beards,\n\ntheir implausible bosoms, their stranger affections ...\n\nThe most unlikely coupling—\n\nLambert, 18, the only college prospect\n\non the varsity basketball team,\n\nthe proverbial talldarkhandsome\n\nswashbuckling cocksman, grinning ...\n\nBeside him, Wanda, 13,\n\nbespectacled, in her primproper attire\n\nand pigtails, staring up at him,\n\nfawneyed, disbelieving ...\n\nAnd as the bus filled with the improbable musk of her,\n\nas she twitched impaled on his finger\n\nlike a dead frog jarred to life by electrodes,\n\nI knew ...\n\nthat love is a forlorn enterprise,\n\nthat I would never understand it.\n\n“*** 101” and “Burn, Ovid” were written about my experiences during ninth grade at Faith Christian Academy, circa age 14-15 in 1972-1973. However, these poems were not completed until 2001 and are in a more mature voice and style than most of my other early poems.\n\nBecause You Came to Me\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nfor Beth\n\nBecause you came to me with sweet compassion\n\nand kissed my furrowed brow and smoothed my hair,\n\nI do not love you after any fashion,\n\nbut wildly, in despair.\n\nBecause you came to me in my black torment\n\nand kissed me fiercely, blazing like the sun\n\nupon parched desert dunes, till in dawn’s foment\n\nthey melt ... I am undone.\n\nBecause I am undone, you have remade me\n\nas suns bring life, as brilliant rains endow\n\nthe earth below with leaves, where you now shade me\n\nand bower me, somehow.\n\nI wrote the first version of this poem around age 18, then revised it 30 years later and dedicated the new version to my wife Beth.\n\nAmbition\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nMen speak of their “Ambition”\n\nand I smile to hear them say\n\nthat within them burns such fire,\n\nsuch a longing to be great ...\n\nFor I laugh at their “Ambition”\n\nas their wistfulness amasses;\n\nI seek Her tongue’s indulgence\n\nand Her parted legs’ crevasses.\n\nI was very ambitious about my poetry, even as a teenager! I wrote this one around age 18 or 19.\n\nAn Illusion\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nThe sky was as hushed as the breath of a bee\n\nand the world was bathed in shades of palest gold\n\nwhen I awoke.\n\nShe came to me with the sound of falling leaves\n\nand the scent of new-mown grass;\n\nI held out my arms to her and she passed\n\ninto oblivion...\n\nThis is one of my early poems, written around age 16 and published in my high school literary journal.\n\nDescribing You\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nHow can I describe you?\n\nThe fragrance of morning rain\n\nmingled with dew\n\nreminds me of you;\n\nthe warmth of sunlight\n\nstealing through a windowpane\n\nbrings you back to me again.\n\nThis is an early poem of mine, written around age 16.\n\nAnalogy\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nOur embrace is like a forest\n\nlying blanketed in snow;\n\nyou, the lily, are enchanted\n\nby each shiver trembling through;\n\nI, the snowfall, cling in earnest\n\nas I press so close to you.\n\nYou dream that you now are sheltered;\n\nI dream that I may break through.\n\nI believe I wrote this poem around age 18 or 19.\n\nOf You\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nThere is little to write of in my life,\n\nand little to write off, as so many do . . .\n\nso I will write of you.\n\nYou are the sunshine after the rain,\n\nthe rainbow in between;\n\nyou are the joy that follows fierce pain;\n\nyou are the best that I've seen\n\nin my life.\n\nYou are the peace that follows long strife;\n\nyou are tranquility.\n\nYou are an oasis in a dry land\n\nand\n\nyou are the one for me!\n\nYou are my love; you are my life; you are my all in all.\n\nYour hand is the hand that holds me aloft . . .\n\nwithout you I would fall.\n\nI have tried to remember when I wrote this poem, but that memory remains elusive. It was definitely written by 1976 because the poem was published in the Lantern then. But many of those poems were written earlier and this one feels “younger” to me, so I will guess a composition date in 1974, around age 16.\n\n49th Street Serenade\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nIt's four o'clock in the mornin'\n\nand we're alone, all alone in the city . . .\n\nyour sneakers 're torn\n\nand your jeans 're so short\n\nthat your ankles show, but you're pretty.\n\nI wish I had five dollars;\n\nI'd pay your bus fare home,\n\nbut how far canya go\n\nthrough the sleet 'n' the snow\n\nfor a fistful of change?\n\n'Bout the end of Childe’s Lane.\n\nRight now my old man is sleepin'\n\nand he don't know the hell where I am.\n\nWhy he still goes to bed\n\nwhen he's already dead,\n\nI don't understand,\n\nbut I don't give a ****.\n\nBein' sixteen sure is borin'\n\nthough I guess for a girl it's all right . . .\n\nif you'd let your hair grow\n\nand get some nice clothes,\n\nI think you'd look outta sight.\n\nAnd I wish I had ten dollars;\n\nI'd ask you if you would . . .\n\nbut wishin's no good\n\nand you'd think I'm a hood,\n\nso I guess I'll be sayin' good night.\n\nThis is one of my earliest poems; I actually started out writing songs when some long-haired friends of mine started a band around 1974. But I was too introverted and shy to show them to anyone. This one was too **** for my high school journal.\n\nHaving Touched You\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nWhat I have lost\n\nis not less\n\nthan what I have gained.\n\nAnd for each moment passed\n\nlike the sun to the west,\n\nanother remained\n\nsuspended in memory\n\nlike a flower\n\nin crystal\n\nso that eternity\n\nis but an hour\n\nand fall\n\nis no longer a season\n\nbut a state\n\nof mind.\n\nI have no reason\n\nto wait;\n\nthe wind\n\ndoes not pause\n\nfor remembrance\n\nor regret\n\nbecause\n\nthere is only fate and chance.\n\nAnd so then, forget . . .\n\nForget that we were very happy\n\nfor a day.\n\nThat day was my lifetime.\n\nBefore that day I was empty\n\nand the sky was grey.\n\nYou were the sunshine,\n\nthe sunshine that gave me life.\n\nI took root\n\nand I grew.\n\nNow the touch of death is like a terrible knife,\n\nand yet I can bear it,\n\nhaving touched you.\n\nOdd, the things that inspire us! I wrote this poem after watching The Boy in the Bubble: a made-for-TV movie, circa 1976, starring John Travolta. So I would have been around 18 at the time.\n\nHymn to Apollo\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nsomething of sunshine attracted my i\n\nas it lazed on the afternoon sky,\n\ngolden, splashed on the easel of god;\n\nwhat, i thought,\n\ncould this airy stuff be,\n\nto, phantomlike, flit\n\nthrough tall trees\n\non fall days, such as these?\n\nand the breeze\n\nwhispered a dirge\n\nto the vanishing light;\n\nenchoired with the evening, it sang;\n\nits voice enchantedly rang\n\nchanting \"Night! \"...\n\ntill all the bright light\n\nretired,\n\nexpired.\n\nThis poem appeared in my high school literary journal, the Lantern.\n\nas Time walked by\n\nby michael r. burch, age 16\n\nyesterday i dreamed of us again,\n\nwhen\n\nthe air, like honey,\n\ntrickled through cushioning grasses,\n\nsoftly flowing, pouring itself upon the masses\n\nof dreaming flowers...\n\nand the hours\n\nwere tentative, coy and shy\n\nwhile the sky\n\nswirled all its colors together,\n\ngiving pleasure to the appreciative eye\n\nas Time walked by.\n\nthen your smile\n\ncould fill the darkest night\n\nwith brilliant light\n\nor thrill the dullest day\n\nwith ecstasy\n\nso long as Time led leisurely our way;\n\nas It did,\n\nIt did.\n\nbut soon the summer hid\n\nher sunny smile...\n\nthe honeyed breaths of wind\n\nbecame cold,\n\nbiting to the bone\n\nas Time sped on,\n\nfled from us\n\nto be gone\n\nforevermore.\n\nthis morning i awakened to the thought\n\nthat you were near\n\nwith honey hair and happy smile\n\nlying sweetly by my side,\n\nbut then i remembered—you were gone,\n\nthat you toppled long ago\n\nlike an orchid felled by snow\n\nas the thing called \"us\" sank slowly down to die\n\nand Time roared by.\n\nThis poem appeared in my high school journal and was probably written around age 16.\n\nPlaymates\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 13-14\n\nWHEN you were my playmate and I was yours,\n\nwe spent endless hours with simple toys,\n\nand the sorrows and cares of our indentured days\n\nwere uncomprehended... far, far away...\n\nfor the temptations and trials we had yet to face\n\nwere lost in the shadows of an unventured maze.\n\nThen simple pleasures were easy to find\n\nand if they cost us a little, we didn't mind;\n\nfor even a penny in a pocket back then\n\nwas one penny too many, a penny to spend.\n\nThen feelings were feelings and love was just love,\n\nnot a strange, complex mystery to be understood;\n\nwhile \"sin\" and \"damnation\" meant little to us,\n\nsince forbidden batter was our only lust!\n\nThen we never worried about what we had,\n\nand we were both sure-what was good, what was bad.\n\nAnd we sometimes quarreled, but we didn't hate;\n\nwe seldom gave thought to injustice, or fate.\n\nThen we never thought about the next day,\n\nfor tomorrow seemed hidden—adventures away.\n\nThough sometimes we dreamed of adventures past,\n\nand wondered, at times, why things didn't last.\n\nStill, we never worried about getting by,\n\nand we didn't know that we were to die...\n\nwhen we spent endless hours with simple toys,\n\nand I was your playmate, and we were boys.\n\nThis is, I believe, my second \"real\" poem. I believe I was around 13 or 14 when I wrote it.\n\nhey pete\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nfor Pete Rose\n\nhey pete,\n\nit's baseball season\n\nand the sun ascends the sky,\n\nencouraging a schoolboy's dreams\n\nof winter whizzing by;\n\ngo out, go out and catch it,\n\nput it in a jar,\n\nset it on a shelf\n\nand then you'll be a Superstar.\n\nFloating\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nMemories flood the sand's unfolding scroll;\n\nthey pour in with the long, cursive tides of night.\n\nMemories of revenant blue eyes and wild lips\n\nmoist and frantic against my own.\n\nMemories of ghostly white limbs...\n\nof soft sighs\n\nheard once again in the surf's strangled moans.\n\nWe meet in the scarred, fissured caves of old dreams,\n\ngreen waves of algae billowing about you,\n\nbecoming your hair.\n\nSuspended there,\n\nwhere pale sunset discolors the sea,\n\nI see all that you are\n\nand all that you have become to me.\n\nYour love is a sea,\n\nand I am its trawler—\n\nharbored in dreams,\n\nI ride out night's storms.\n\nUnanchored, I drift through the hours before morning,\n\ndreaming the solace of your warm *******,\n\npondering your riddles, savoring the feel\n\nof the explosions of your hot, saline breath.\n\nAnd I rise sometimes\n\nfrom the tropical darkness\n\nto gaze once again out over the sea...\n\nYou watch in the moonlight\n\nthat brushes the water;\n\nbright waves throw back your reflection at me.\n\nMare Clausum\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nThese are the narrows of my soul—\n\ndark waters pierced by eerie, haunting screams.\n\nAnd these uncharted islands bleakly home\n\nwild nightmares and deep, strange, forbidding dreams.\n\nPlease don't think to find pearls' pale, unearthly glow\n\nwithin its shoals, nor corals in its reefs.\n\nFor, though you seek to salvage Love, I know\n\nthat vessel lists, and night brings no relief.\n\nPause here, and look, and know that all is lost;\n\nthen turn, and go; let salt consume, and rust.\n\nThis sea is not for sailors, but the ******\n\nwho lingered long past morning, till they learned\n\nwhy it is named:\n\nMare Clausum.\n\nMare Clausum is Latin for \"Closed Sea.\" I believe this poem was written around age 19.\n\nNevermore!\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nNevermore! O, nevermore!\n\nshall the haunts of the sea\n\n—the swollen tide pools\n\nand the dark, deserted shore—\n\nmark her passing again.\n\nAnd the salivating sea\n\nshall never kiss her lips\n\nnor caress her ******* and hips,\n\nas she dreamt it did before,\n\nonce, lost within the uproar.\n\nThe waves will never **** her,\n\nnor take her at their leisure;\n\nthe sea gulls shall not claim her,\n\nnor could she give them pleasure ...\n\nShe sleeps, forevermore!\n\nShe sleeps forevermore,\n\na ****** save to me\n\nand her other lover,\n\nwho lurks now, safely covered\n\nby the restless, surging sea.\n\nAnd, yes, they sleep together,\n\nbut never in that way ...\n\nFor the sea has stripped and shorn\n\nthe one I once adored,\n\nand washed her flesh away.\n\nHe does not stroke her honey hair,\n\nfor she is bald, bald to the bone!\n\nAnd how it fills my heart with glee\n\nto hear them sometimes cursing me\n\nout of the depths of the demon sea ...\n\ntheir skeletal love—impossibility!\n\nPublished by Romantics Quarterly and Penny Dreadful\n\nShock\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nIt was early in the morning of the forming of my soul,\n\nin the dawning of desire, with passion at first bloom,\n\nwith lightning splitting heaven to thunder's blasting roll\n\nand a sense of welling fire and, perhaps, impending doom—\n\nthat I cried out through the tumult of the raging storm on high\n\nfor shelter from the chaos of the restless, driving rain...\n\nand the voice I heard replying from a rift of bleeding sky\n\nwas mine, I'm sure, and, furthermore, was certainly insane.\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant...\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n—feverish, wet—\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union...\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nIn the Whispering Night\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nfor George King\n\nIn the whispering night, when the stars bend low\n\ntill the hills ignite to a shining flame,\n\nwhen a shower of meteors streaks the sky\n\nwhile the lilies sigh in their beds, for shame,\n\nwe must steal our souls, as they once were stolen,\n\nand gather our vigor, and all our intent.\n\nWe must heave our bodies to some famished ocean\n\nand laugh as they shatter, and never repent.\n\nWe must dance in the darkness as stars dance before us,\n\nsoar, Soar! through the night on a butterfly's breeze...\n\nblown high, upward-yearning, twin spirits returning\n\nto the heights of awareness from which we were seized.\n\nalien\n\nby michael r. burch, age 19\n\nthere are mornings in england\n\nwhen, riddled with light,\n\nthe Blueberries gleam at us—\n\nplump, sweet and fragrant.\n\nbut i am so small ...\n\nwhat do i know\n\nof the ways of the Daffodils?\n\n“beware of the Nettles!”\n\nwe go laughing and singing,\n\nbut somehow, i, ...\n\ni know i am lost. i do not belong\n\nto this Earth or its Songs.\n\nand yet i am singing ...\n\nthe sun—so mild;\n\nmy cheeks are like roses;\n\nmy skin—so fair.\n\ni spent a long time there\n\nbefore i realized: They have no faces,\n\nno bodies, no voices.\n\ni was always alone.\n\nand yet i keep singing:\n\nthe words will come\n\nif only i hear.\n\nI believe I wrote this poem around age 19, then revised it nearly a half-century later. One of my earliest memories is picking blueberries amid the brambles surrounding the tiny English hamlet, Mattersey, where I and my mother lived with her parents while my American father was stationed in Thule, Greenland, where dependents were not allowed. Was that because of the weather or the nukes? In any case, England is free of dangerous animals, but one must be wary of the copious thorns and nettles.\n\nBe that Rock\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nfor my grandfather George Edwin Hurt Sr.\n\nWhen I was a child\n\nI never considered man’s impermanence,\n\nfor you were a mountain of adamant stone:\n\na man steadfast, immense,\n\nand your words rang.\n\nAnd when you were gone,\n\nI still heard your voice, which never betrayed,\n\n\"Be strong and of a good courage,\n\nneither be afraid ...\"\n\nas the angels sang.\n\nAnd, O!, I believed\n\nfor your words were my truth, and I tried to be brave\n\nthough the years slipped away\n\nwith so little to save\n\nof that talk.\n\nNow I'm a man—\n\na man ... and yet Grandpa ... I'm still the same child\n\nwho sat at your feet\n\nand learned as you smiled.\n\nBe that rock.\n\nI don't remember when I wrote this poem, but I will guess around age 18 in 1976. The verse quoted is from an old, well-worn King James Bible my grandfather gave me after his only visit to the United States, as he prepared to return to England with my grandmother. I was around eight at the time and didn't know if I would ever see my grandparents again, so I was heartbroken – destitute, really.\n\nDesdemona\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 22\n\nThough you possessed the moon and stars,\n\nyou are bound to fate and wed to chance.\n\nYour lips deny they crave a kiss;\n\nyour feet deny they ache to dance.\n\nYour heart imagines wild romance.\n\nThough you cupped fire in your hands\n\nand molded incandescent forms,\n\nyou are barren now, and—spent of flame—\n\nthe ashes that remain are borne\n\ntoward the sun upon a storm.\n\nYou, who demanded more, have less,\n\nyour heart within its cells of sighs\n\nheld fast by chains of misery,\n\nconfined till death for peddling lies—\n\nimprisonment your sense denies.\n\nYou, who collected hearts like leaves\n\nand pressed each once within your book,\n\nforgot. None—winsome, bright or rare—\n\nnot one was worth a second look.\n\nMy heart, as others, you forsook.\n\nBut I, though I loved you from afar\n\nthrough silent dawns, and gathered rue\n\nfrom gardens where your footsteps left\n\ncold paths among the asters, knew—\n\neach moonless night the nettles grew\n\nand strangled hope, where love dies too.\n\nPublished by Penny Dreadful, Carnelian, Romantics Quarterly, Grassroots Poetry and Poetry Life & Times\n\nGone\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nTonight, it is dark\n\nand the stars do not shine.\n\nA man who is gone\n\nwas a good friend of mine.\n\nWe were friends.\n\nAnd the sky was the strangest shade of orange on gold\n\nwhen I awoke to find him gone ...\n\nThis is one of my very earliest poems, one that was lost when I destroyed all the poems I had written in a fit of frustration and despair. The opening lines and \"the strangest shade of orange on gold\" are all of the original poem that I have been able to remember. I believe I wrote the original poem around age 14.\n\nInce St. Child\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nWhen she was a child\n\nin a dark forest of fear,\n\nimagination cast its strange light\n\ninto secret places,\n\nscattering traces\n\nof illumination so bright,\n\nyears later, they might suddenly reappear,\n\ntheir light undefiled.\n\nWhen she was young,\n\nthe shafted light of her dreams\n\nshone on her uplifted face\n\nas she prayed;\n\nthough she strayed\n\ninto a night fallen like mildewed lace\n\nshrouding the forest of screams,\n\nher faith led her home.\n\nNow she is old\n\nand the light that was flame\n\nis a slow-dying ember . . .\n\nWhat she felt then\n\nshe would explain;\n\nshe would if she could only remember\n\nthat forest of shame,\n\nfaith beaten like gold.\n\nPublished by Piedmont Literary Review, Songs of Innocence, Romantics Quarterly and Poetry Life & Times.\n\nThis is an unusual poem that I wrote in my late teens, and it took me some time to figure out who the elderly woman was. She was a victim of childhood ******, hence the title I eventually chose.\n\nThe Beautiful People\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nThey are the beautiful people,\n\nand their shadows dance through the valleys of the moon\n\nto the listless strains of an ancient tune.\n\nOh, no ... please don't touch them,\n\nfor their smiles might fade.\n\nDon’t go ... don’t approach them\n\nas they promenade,\n\nfor they waltz through a vacuum\n\nand dream they're not made\n\nof the dust and the dankness\n\nto which men degrade.\n\nThey are the beautiful people,\n\nand their spirits sighed in their mothers’ wombs\n\nas the distant echoings of unearthly tunes.\n\nWinds do not blow there\n\nand storms do not rise,\n\nand each hair has its place\n\nand each gown has its price.\n\nAnd they whirl through the darkness\n\nuntouched by our cares\n\nas we watch them and long for\n\na \"life\" such as theirs.\n\nBurn\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nfor Trump\n\nSunbathe,\n\nozone baby,\n\ntill your parched skin cracks\n\nin the white-hot flash\n\nof radiation.\n\nIncantation\n\nfrom your pale parched lips\n\nshall not avail;\n\nyou made this hell.\n\nNow burn.\n\nThis was one of my early poems, written around age 19. I dedicated the poem to Trump after he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change accords.\n\nas Time walked by\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nyesterday i dreamed of u(s) again,\n\nwhen\n\nthe air, like honey,\n\ntrickled through cushioning grasses,\n\nsoftly flowing, pouring itself upon the masses\n\nof dreaming flowers . . .\n\nthen the sly impish Hours\n\nwere tentative, coy and shy\n\nwhile the sky\n\nswirled all its colors together,\n\ngiving pleasure to the appreciative eye\n\nas Time walked by.\n\nsunbright, ur smile\n\ncould fill the darkest night\n\nwith brilliant light\n\nor thrill the dullest day\n\nwith ecstasy\n\nso long as Time did not impede our way;\n\nuntil It did,\n\nas It did.\n\nfor soon the summer hid\n\nher sunny smile . . .\n\nthe honeyed breaths of wind\n\nbecame cold,\n\nbiting to the bone\n\nas Time sped on,\n\nfled from u(s)\n\nto be gone\n\nForevermore.\n\nthis morning i awakened to the thought\n\nthat u were near\n\nwith honey hair and happy smile\n\nlying sweetly by my side,\n\nbut then i remembered—u were gone,\n\nthat u’d been toppled long ago\n\nlike an orchid felled by snow\n\nas the bloom called “us” sank slowly down to die\n\nand Time roared by.\n\nThis poem was written around age 16 and appeared in my high school journal the Lantern in 1976.\n\nDust (I)\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nGod, keep them safe until\n\nI join them, as I will.\n\nGod, guard their tender dust\n\nuntil I meet them, as I must.\n\nThis is one of my earliest poems, written circa 1972 at age 14, around the same time as “Jessamyn’s Song” but probably a bit earlier. “Dust” was at one time the closing stanza of “All My Children.”\n\nDust (II)\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 15\n\nWe are dust\n\nand to dust we must\n\nreturn ...\n\nbut why, then,\n\nlife’s pointless sojourn?\n\nI’m not sure when I wrote my second “Dust” poem but I will keep the poems together due to the shared title and theme.\n\nDust (III)\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nFlame within flame,\n\nwe burned and burned relentlessly\n\ntill there was nothing left to be consumed.\n\nOnly ash remained, the smoke plumed\n\nlike a spirit leaving its corpse, and we\n\nwere left with only a name\n\never common between us.\n\nWe had thought to love “eternally,”\n\nbut the wick sputtered, the candle swooned,\n\nthe flame subsided, the smoke ballooned,\n\nand our communal thought was: flee, flee, flee\n\nthe choking dust.\n\nThis is one of my early poems in the “Dust” series, but unfortunately I have no recollection of writing it, nor any notes about its composition. I will guess that I wrote this one in my late teens.\n\nLove Unfolded Like a Flower\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nLove unfolded\n\nlike a flower;\n\nPale petals pinked and blushed to see the sky.\n\nI came to know you\n\nand to trust you\n\nin moments lost to springtime slipping by.\n\nThen love burst outward,\n\nleaping skyward,\n\nand untamed blossoms danced against the wind.\n\nAll I wanted\n\nwas to hold you;\n\nthough passion tempted once, we never sinned.\n\nNow love's gay petals\n\nfade and wither,\n\nand winter beckons, whispering a lie.\n\nWe were friends,\n\nbut friendships end . . .\n\nyes, friendships end and even roses die.\n\nThis is a love poem I wrote in my late teens for a girl I had a serious crush on. The poem was originally titled \"Christy.\"\n\nUnfoldings\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nfor Vicki\n\nTime unfolds ...\n\nYour lips were roses.\n\n... petals open, shyly clustering ...\n\nI had dreams\n\nof other seasons.\n\n... ten thousand colors quiver, blossoming.\n\nNight and day ...\n\nDreams burned within me.\n\n... flowers part themselves, and then they close ...\n\nYou were lovely;\n\nI was lonely.\n\n... a ****** yields herself, but no one knows.\n\nNow time goes on ...\n\nI have not seen you.\n\n... within ringed whorls, secrets are exchanged ...\n\nA fire rages;\n\nno one sees it.\n\n... a blossom spreads its flutes to catch the rain.\n\nSeasons flow ...\n\nA dream is dying.\n\n... within parched clusters, life is taking form ...\n\nYou were honest;\n\nI was angry.\n\n... petals fling themselves before the storm.\n\nTime is slowing ...\n\nI am older.\n\n... blossoms wither, closing one last time ...\n\nI'd love to see you\n\nand to touch you.\n\n... a flower crumbles, crinkling, worn and dry.\n\nTime contracts ...\n\nI cannot touch you.\n\n... a solitary flower cries for warmth ...\n\nLife goes on as\n\ndreams lose meaning.\n\n... the seeds are scattered, lost within a storm.\n\nI wrote this poem for a college girlfriend, circa age 18-19.\n\nEach Color a Scar\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 21\n\nWhat she left here,\n\nupon my cheek,\n\nis a tear.\n\nShe did not speak,\n\nbut her intention\n\nwas clear,\n\nand I was meek,\n\nfar too meek, and, I fear,\n\ntoo sincere.\n\nWhat she can never take\n\nfrom my heart\n\nis its ache;\n\nfor now we, apart,\n\nare like leaves\n\nwithout weight,\n\nscattered afar\n\nby love, or by hate,\n\neach color a scar.\n\nThe Tender Weight of Her Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 21\n\nThe tender weight of her sighs\n\nlies heavily upon my heart;\n\napart from her, full of doubt,\n\nwithout her presence to revolve around,\n\nfound wanting direction or course,\n\ncursed with the thought of her grief,\n\nbelieving true love is a myth,\n\nwith hope as elusive as tears,\n\nhers and mine, unable to lie,\n\nI sigh ...\n\nI believe “The Tender Weight of Her Sighs” and “Each Color a Scar” are companion poems, probably written around the same time at age 21. This poem has an unusual rhyme scheme, with the last word of each line rhyming with the first word of the next line. The final line is a “closing couplet” in which both words rhyme with the last word of the preceding line. I believe I invented the ***** form, which I will dub the “End-First Curtal Sonnet.”\n\nImpotent\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 22\n\nTonight my pen\n\nis barren\n\nof passion, spent of poetry.\n\nI hear your name\n\nupon the rain\n\nand yet it cannot comfort me.\n\nI feel the pain\n\nof dreams that wane,\n\nof poems that falter, losing force.\n\nI write again\n\nwords without end,\n\nbut I cannot control their course . . .\n\nTonight my pen\n\nis sullen\n\nand wants no more of poetry.\n\nI hear your voice\n\nas if a choice,\n\nbut how can I respond, or flee?\n\nI feel a flame\n\nI cannot name\n\nthat sends me searching for a word,\n\nbut there is none\n\nnot over-done,\n\nunless it's one I never heard.\n\nI believe this poem was written in my late teens or early twenties.\n\nCameo\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 21\n\nBreathe upon me the breath of life;\n\ngaze upon me with sardonyx eyes.\n\nHere, where times flies\n\nin the absence of light,\n\nall ecstasies are intimations of night.\n\nHold me tonight in the spell I have cast;\n\npromise what cannot be given.\n\nShow me the stairway to heaven.\n\nJacob's-ladder grows all around us;\n\nJacob's ladder was fashioned of onyx.\n\nSo breathe upon me the breath of life;\n\ngaze upon me with sardonic eyes . . .\n\nand, if in the morning I am not wise,\n\nat least then I’ll know if this dream we call life\n\nwas worth the surmise.\n\nMy notes say that I copied and filed this poem in 1979, around age 21. Since I don’t have an earlier recollection of this poem, I will stick with that date. This one does feel a bit more mature than some of my teenage poems, so the date seems about right.\n\nThe Last Enchantment\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nOh, Lancelot, my truest friend,\n\nhow time has thinned your ragged mane\n\nand pinched your features; still you seem\n\nthough, much, much changed—somehow unchanged.\n\nYour sword hand is, as ever, ready,\n\nalthough the time for swords has passed.\n\nYour eyes are fierce, and yet so steady\n\nmeeting mine ... you must not ask.\n\nThe time is not, nor ever shall be,\n\nfor Merlyn’s words were only words;\n\nand now his last enchantment wanes,\n\nand we must put aside our swords ...\n\nOriginally published by Trinacria\n\nLay Down Your Arms\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 21\n\nLay down your arms; come, sleep in the sand.\n\nThe battle is over and night is at hand.\n\nOur voyage has ended; there's nowhere to go ...\n\nthe earth is a cinder still faintly aglow.\n\nLay down your pamphlets; let's bicker no more.\n\nInstead, let us sleep here on this ravaged shore.\n\nThe sea is still boiling; the air is wan, thin ...\n\nLay down your pamphlets; now no one will “win.”\n\nLay down your hymnals; abandon all song.\n\nIf God was to save us, He waited too long.\n\nA new world emerges, but this world is through . . .\n\nso lay down your hymnals, or write something new.\n\nI wrote “Lay Down Your Arms” around age 21 and it became my first published poem, possibly. Can an acceptance be a rejection? I never received a copy of the first journal that accepted one of my poems, The Romantist, so I don’t know if my first “published poem” was actually published! In any case, poems that I wrote from (circa) ages 11 to 16 were eventually published, so I now consider those my “earliest” publications.\n\n/Y/\n\nThis is a poem about a discussion between a young poet and an older poet – the very poetic Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I wrote this poem as a teenager under the spell of Dr. King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which for me is also a compelling poem. In the poem he is the upper-case Poet and I am the lower-case poet.\n\nPoet to poet\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nI have a dream\n\n...pebbles in a sparkling sand...\n\nof wondrous things.\n\nI see children\n\n...variations of the same man...\n\nplaying together.\n\nBlack and yellow, red and white,\n\n... stone and flesh, a host of colors...\n\ntogether at last.\n\nI see a time\n\n...each small child another's cousin...\n\nwhen freedom shall ring.\n\nI hear a song\n\n...sweeter than the sea sings...\n\nof many voices.\n\nI hear a jubilation\n\n... respect and love are the gifts we must bring...\n\nshaking the land.\n\nI have a message,\n\n...sea shells echo, the melody rings...\n\nthe message of God.\n\nI have a dream\n\n...all pebbles are merely smooth fragments of stone...\n\nof many things.\n\nI live in hope\n\n...all children are merely small fragments of One...\n\nthat this dream shall come true.\n\nI have a dream!\n\n... but when you're gone, won't the dream have to end?...\n\nOh, no, not as long as you dream my dream too!\n\nHere, hold out your hand, let's make it come true.\n\n... i can feel it begin...\n\nLovers and dreamers are poets too.\n\n...poets are lovers and dreamers too...\n\nPublished by Borderless Journal (Singapore) and Love Poems and Poets\n\nFairest Diana\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 22\n\nFairest Diana, princess of dreams,\n\nborn to be loved and yet distant and lone,\n\nwhy did you linger—so solemn, so lovely—\n\nan orchid ablaze in a crevice of stone?\n\nWas not your heart meant for tenderest passions?\n\nSurely your lips—for wild kisses, not vows!\n\nWhy then did you languish, though lustrous, becoming\n\na pearl of enchantment cast before sows?\n\nFairest Diana, fragile as lilac,\n\nas willful as rainfall, as true as the rose;\n\nhow did a stanza of silver-bright verse\n\ncome to be bound in a book of dull prose?\n\nPublished by Tucumcari Literary Journal and Night Roses\n\nI believe this poem was written in the late 1970s or very early 1980s, around the time it became apparent that the lovely Diana Spencer was going to marry into the British royal family.\n\nFlight\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nEagle, raven, blackbird, crow . . .\n\nWhat you are I do not know.\n\nWhere you go I do not care.\n\nI’m unconcerned whose meal you bear.\n\nBut as you mount the sun-splashed sky,\n\nI only wish that I could fly.\n\nI only wish that I could fly.\n\nRobin, hawk or whippoorwill . . .\n\nShould men care if you hunger still?\n\nI do not wish to see your home.\n\nI do not wonder where you roam.\n\nBut as you scale the sky's bright stairs,\n\nI only wish that I were there.\n\nI only wish that I were there.\n\nSparrow, lark or chickadee . . .\n\nYour markings I disdain to see.\n\nWhere you fly concerns me not.\n\nI scarcely give your flight a thought.\n\nBut as you wheel and arc and dive,\n\nI, too, would feel so much alive.\n\nI, too, would feel so much alive.\n\nThis poem was influenced by William Cullen Bryant’s “To a Waterfowl.”\n\nFlying\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16-17\n\ni shall rise\n\nand try the ****** wings of thought\n\nten thousand times\n\nbefore i fly ...\n\nand then i'll sleep\n\nand waste ten thousand nights\n\nbefore i dream;\n\nbut when at last ...\n\ni soar the distant heights of undreamt skies\n\nwhere never hawks nor eagles dared to go,\n\nas i laugh among the meteors flashing by\n\nsomewhere beyond the bluest earth-bound seas ...\n\nif i'm not told\n\ni’m just a man,\n\nthen i shall know\n\njust what I AM.\n\nThis is a poem written around age 16-17. According to my notes I may have revised the poem later, around 1978, but if so the changes were minor and the poem remains very close to the original.\n\nSanctuary at Dawn\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nI have walked these thirteen miles\n\njust to stand outside your door.\n\nThe rain has dogged my footsteps\n\nfor thirteen miles, for thirty years,\n\nthrough the monsoon seasons ...\n\nand now my tears\n\nhave all been washed away.\n\nThrough thirteen miles of rain I slogged,\n\nI stumbled and I climbed\n\nrainslickened slopes\n\nthat led me home\n\nto the hope that I might find\n\na life I lived before.\n\nThe door is wet; my cheeks are wet,\n\nbut not with rain or tears ...\n\nas I knock I sweat\n\nand the raining seems\n\nthe rhythm of the years.\n\nNow you stand outlined in the doorway\n\n—a man as large as I left—\n\nand with bated breath\n\nI take a step\n\ninto the accusing light.\n\nYour eyes are grayer\n\nthan I remembered;\n\nyour hair is grayer, too.\n\nAs the red rust runs\n\ndown the dripping drains,\n\nour voices exclaim—\n\n\"My father!\"\n\n\"My son!\"\n\n“Sanctuary at Dawn” appeared in my poetry contest manuscript, so it was written either in high school or during my first two years of college: 1976 is an educated guess. In my teens, thirty was a generic age for adulthood.\n\nShadows\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nAlone again as evening falls,\n\nI join gaunt shadows and we crawl\n\nup and down my room's dark walls.\n\nUp and down and up and down,\n\nagainst starlight—strange, mirthless clowns—\n\nwe merge, emerge, submerge . . . then drown.\n\nWe drown in shadows starker still,\n\nshadows of the somber hills,\n\nshadows of sad selves we spill,\n\ntumbling, to the ground below.\n\nThere, caked in grimy, clinging snow,\n\nwe flutter feebly, moaning low\n\nfor days dreamed once an age ago\n\nwhen we weren't shadows, but were men . . .\n\nwhen we were men, or almost so.\n\nPublished by Homespun and Mind in Motion\n\nThis poem was written either in high school or my first two years of college because it appeared in the 1979-1980 issue of my college literary journal, Homespun.\n\nSappho’s Lullaby\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nfor Jeremy\n\nHushed yet melodic, the hills and the valleys\n\nsleep unaware of the nightingale's call\n\nas the pale calla lilies lie\n\nlistening,\n\nglistening ...\n\nthis is their night, the first night of fall.\n\nSon, tonight, a woman awaits you;\n\nshe is more vibrant, more lovely than spring.\n\nShe'll meet you in moonlight,\n\nsoft and warm,\n\nall alone ...\n\nthen you'll know why the nightingale sings.\n\nJust yesterday the stars were afire;\n\nthen how desire flashed through my veins!\n\nBut now I am older;\n\nnight has come,\n\nI’m alone ...\n\nfor you I will sing as the nightingale sings.\n\nThe calla lily symbolizes beauty, purity, innocence, faithfulness and true devotion. According to Greek mythology, when the Milky Way was formed by the goddess Hera’s breast milk, the drops that fell to earth became calla lilies. After my son Jeremy was born, I dedicated this poem to him.\n\nTell me what i am\n\nby michael r. burch, age 15\n\nTell me what i am,\n\nfor i have often wondered why i live.\n\nDo u know?—\n\nplease tell me so;\n\ndrive away this darkness from within.\n\nFor my heart is black with sin\n\nand i have often wondered why i am.\n\nAnd my thoughts are lacking light\n\nthough i have often sought what was right.\n\nNow it is night;\n\nplease drive away the darkness from without,\n\nfor i doubt that i will see\n\nthe coming of the day\n\nwithout ur help.\n\nThis is one of my early “I am/am I” poems. It was published in my high school journal, the Lantern. I believe I wrote the original version around age 15 or 16.\n\nSay You Love Me\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nJoy and anguish surge within my soul;\n\ncontesting there, they cannot be controlled;\n\nnow grinding yearnings grip me like a vise.\n\nStars are burning;\n\nit's almost morning.\n\nDreams of dreams of dreams that I have dreamed\n\ndance before me, forming formless scenes;\n\nand now, at last, the feeling grows\n\nas stars, declining,\n\nbow to morning.\n\nAnd you are music in my undreamt dreams,\n\nrising from some far-off lyric spring;\n\noh, somewhere in the night I hear you sing.\n\nStars on fire\n\nform a choir.\n\nNow dawn's fierce brightness burns within your eyes;\n\nyou laugh at me as dancing starlets die.\n\nYou touch me so and still I don't know why . . .\n\nBut say you love me.\n\nSay you love me.\n\nThis poem is dated 1983 in my notes, but it could have been written earlier and revised then. This one feels earlier to me, so I will guess it was written around age 18 during my late Romantic period. The original poem did not have “forming formless scenes” or “undreamt dreams.” I chose those revisions, not to be confusing, but in an attempt to capture the moment when, awakening from dreams, we briefly inhabit both worlds simultaneously. I came up with “starlets” because, as the sun eclipses ethereal starlight in our eyes, the reality of a lover in bed eclipses all vague, ethereal fantasies of dream lovers.\n\nStewark Island (Ambiguity)\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17-18\n\n“Take your child, your only child, whom you love...”\n\nSeas are like tears—\n\nthey are never far away.\n\nI have fled them now these eighteen years,\n\nbut I am nearer them today\n\nthan I ever have been.\n\nOh, I never could bear\n\nthe warm, salty water\n\nor the cool comfort here\n\nin the shade of an altar\n\nsweeter than sin ...\n\nSweeter than sin,\n\nyet cleansing, like love;\n\nstill its feel to doomed skin\n\neither too little or too much\n\nof whatever it is.\n\nSeas and tears\n\nare like life—\n\nridiculous,\n\nambiguous.\n\n“Sea Dreams” is one of my longer and more ambitious early poems, along with the full version of “Jessamyn’s Song.” To the best of my recollection, I wrote “Sea Dreams” around age 18 in high school my senior year, then worked on in college. It appeared in my poetry contest notebook and thus was substantially complete by 1978.\n\nSea Dreams\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nI.\n\nIn timeless days\n\nI've crossed the waves\n\nof seaways seldom seen ...\n\nBy the last low light of evening\n\nthe breakers that careen\n\nthen dive back to the deep\n\nhave rocked my ship to sleep,\n\nand so I've known the peace\n\nof a soul at last at ease\n\nthere where Time's waters run\n\nin concert with the sun.\n\nWith restless waves\n\nI've watched the days’\n\nslow movements, as they hum\n\ntheir antediluvian songs.\n\nSometimes I've sung along,\n\nmy voice as soft and low\n\nas the sea's, while evening slowed\n\nto waver at the dim\n\nmysterious moonlit rim\n\nof dreams no man has known.\n\nIn thoughtless flight,\n\nI've scaled the heights\n\nand soared a scudding breeze\n\nover endless arcing seas\n\nof waves ten miles high.\n\nI've sheared the sable skies\n\non wings as soft as sighs\n\nand stormed the sun-pricked pitch\n\nof sunset’s scarlet-stitched,\n\nebullient dark demise.\n\nI've climbed the sun-cleft clouds\n\nten thousand leagues or more\n\nabove the windswept shores\n\nof seas no vessel’s sailed\n\n— great seas as grand as hell's,\n\nshores littered with the shells\n\nof men's \"immortal\" souls —\n\nand I've warred with dark sea-holes\n\nwhose open mouths implored\n\ntheir depths to be explored.\n\nAnd I've grown and grown and grown\n\ntill I thought myself the king\n\nof every silver thing . . .\n\nBut sometimes late at night\n\nwhen the sorrowing wavelets sing\n\nsad songs of other times,\n\nI’ll taste the windborne rime\n\nof a well-remembered day\n\non the whipping ocean spray,\n\nthen I’ll bow my head to pray . . .\n\nII.\n\nIt's been a long, hard day;\n\nsometimes I think I work too hard.\n\nTonight I'd like to take a walk\n\ndown by the sea —\n\ndown by those salty waves\n\nbrined with the scent of Infinity,\n\ndown by that rocky shore,\n\ndown by those cliffs I’d so often climb\n\nwhen the wind was **** with a taste of lime\n\nand every dream was a sailor's dream.\n\nThen small waves broke light,\n\nall frothy and white,\n\nover the reefs in the ramblings of night,\n\nand the pounding sea\n\n—a mariner’s dream—\n\nwas bound to stir a boy's delight\n\nto such a pitch\n\nthat he couldn't desist,\n\nbut was bound to splash through the surf in the light\n\nof ten thousand stars, all shining so bright!\n\nChrist, those nights were fine,\n\nlike a well-aged wine,\n\nyet more scalding than fire\n\nwith the marrow’s desire.\n\nThen desire was a fire\n\nburning wildly within my bones,\n\nfiercer by far than the frantic foam . . .\n\nand every wish was a moan.\n\nOh, for those days to come again!\n\nOh, for a sea and sailing men!\n\nOh, for a little time!\n\nIt's almost nine\n\nand I must be back home by ten,\n\nand then . . . what then?\n\nI have less than an hour to stroll this beach,\n\nless than an hour old dreams to reach . . .\n\nAnd then, what then?\n\nTonight I'd like to play old games—\n\ngames that I used to play\n\nwith the somber, sinking waves.\n\nWhen their wraithlike fists would reach for me,\n\nI'd dance between them gleefully,\n\nmocking their witless craze\n\n—their eager, unchecked craze—\n\nto batter me to death\n\nwith spray as light as breath.\n\nOh, tonight I'd like to sing old songs—\n\nsongs of the haunting moon\n\ndrawing the tides away,\n\nsongs of those sultry days\n\nwhen the sun beat down\n\ntill it cracked the ground\n\nand the sea gulls screamed\n\nin their agony\n\nto touch the cooling clouds.\n\nThe distant cooling clouds.\n\nThen the sun shone bright\n\nwith a different light\n\nover different lands,\n\nand I was always a pirate in flight.\n\nOh, tonight I'd like to dream old dreams,\n\nif only for a while,\n\nand walk perhaps a mile\n\nalong this windswept shore,\n\na mile, perhaps, or more,\n\nremembering those days,\n\nsafe in the soothing spray\n\nof the thousand sparkling streams\n\nthat rush into this sea.\n\nI like to slumber in the caves\n\nof a sailor's dark sea-dreams . . .\n\noh yes, I'd love to dream,\n\nto dream\n\nand dream\n\nand dream.\n\n“Sea Dreams” is one of my longer and more ambitious early poems, along with the full version of “Jessamyn’s Song.” For years I thought I had written “Sea Dreams” around age 19 or 20. But then I remembered a conversation I had with a friend about the poem in my freshman dorm, so the poem must have been started by age 18 or earlier. Dating my early poems has been a bit tricky, because I keep having little flashbacks that help me date them more accurately, but often I can only say, “I know this poem was written by about such-and-such a date, because ...”\n\n*\n\n“Son” is a companion poem to “Sea Dreams” that was written around the same time and discussed in the same freshman dorm conversation. Ron, the other student, asked me how on earth I came up with a poem about being a father who abandoned his son to live on an island! I think the meter is pretty good for the age at which it was written.\n\nSon\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nAn island is bathed in blues and greens\n\nas a weary sun settles to rest,\n\nand the memories singing\n\nthrough the back of my mind\n\nlull me to sleep as the tide flows in.\n\nHere where the hours pass almost unnoticed,\n\nmy heart and my home will be till I die,\n\nbut where you are is where my thoughts go\n\nwhen the tide is high.\n\n[etc., see handwritten version, the father laments abandoning his son]\n\nSo there where the skylarks sing to the sun\n\nas the rain sprinkles lightly around,\n\nunderstand if you can\n\nthe mind of a man\n\nwhose conscience unconsciously drowned.\n\nThoughts of the Everglades in Ontario\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nWe burned wildfire of September in a distant grass,\n\nwatching the many variations of light devour the blades.\n\nAll night long I tended the smoldering campfire\n\nremembering those sweat-drenched nights we spent in the ’glades\n\nlistening as gators sang love songs to one another,\n\ncurious serenades,\n\ntheir huge tails lashing the shallow swampland water.\n\nThat night, camped out distantly beyond the closest farm,\n\nI did not hold you, as I so often have, to keep you warm,\n\nbut rather to feel the restless movements of our unborn daughter.\n\nNow she’s three and the Everglades are in her eyes—\n\ndark and swampy, all muddled green and gray,\n\nand they seem to knowingly say,\n\n“It’s time to be on our way.”\n\nI wrote this poem as a college sophomore, age 20, in 1978.\n\nWhen last my love left me\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nThe sun was a smoldering ember\n\nwhen last my love left me;\n\nthe sunset cast curious shadows\n\nover green arcs of the sea;\n\nshe spoke sad words, departing,\n\nand teardrops drenched the trees.\n\nThis poem was published by my college literary journal, Homespun, issue 1976-1977. I believe I wrote the original version in 1974, around age 16.\n\nWar\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nlysander lies in lauded greece\n\nand sleeps and dreams, a stone for a pillow,\n\nunseeing as sunset devours limp willows,\n\nbut War glares on.\n\nand joab's sightless gaze is turned\n\nbeyond the jordan's ravaged shore;\n\nhis war-ax lies to be hurled no more,\n\nbut War hacks on.\n\nand roland sleeps in poppied fields\n\nwith flowers flowing at his feet;\n\ntheir fragrance lulls his soul to sleep,\n\nbut War raves on.\n\nand patton sighs an unheard sigh\n\nfor sorties past and those to come;\n\nhe does not heed the battle drum,\n\nbut War rolls on.\n\nfor now new heroes grab up guns\n\nand rush to fight their fathers' wars,\n\nas warriors' children must, of course,\n\nwhile War laughs on.\n\nI believe I wrote the first version of this poem around age 17. I was never fully happy with the poem, although I liked some of the lines and revised it 46 years later, on 4-27-2021.\n\nStryx: An Astronomer’s Report\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nYesterday\n\n(or was is an eon ago?)\n\na sun spit out its last remnants of light\n\nover a planet long barren of life,\n\nand died.\n\nIt was not a solitary occasion,\n\nby any stretch of the imagination,\n\nthis decoronation\n\nof a planet conceived out of desolation.\n\nFor her to die as she was born\n\n—amidst the glory of galactic upheaval—\n\nis not strange,\n\nbut fitting.\n\nFitting in that,\n\nshorn of all her preposterous spawn\n\nthat had littered her surface like horrendous hair,\n\nshe died her death bare\n\nand alone.\n\nOnce she was home to all living,\n\nbut she died home to the dead\n\nwho bereaved her of life.\n\nUnfit for life she died that night\n\nas her seas shone fatal, dark and blue.\n\nUnfit for life she met her end\n\nas mountains fell and lava spewed.\n\nUnfit she died, agleam with death\n\nwhose radiance she wore.\n\nUnfit she died as raging waves\n\nobliterated every shore.\n\nUnfit! Unfit! Unfit! Unfit!\n\nContaminated with the rays\n\nthat smoldered in her radiant swamps\n\nand seared her lifeless bays.\n\nUnfit! Unfit! Unfit! Unfit!\n\na ****** world no more,\n\nbut a planet ***** and left to face\n\nher death as she was born—\n\nalone, so all alone.\n\nYesterday,\n\na planet green and lovely was no more.\n\nYesterday,\n\nthe whitecaps crashed against her shores\n\nand then they were no more.\n\nYesterday,\n\na soft green light\n\nno longer brushed the moon's dark heights . . .\n\nThere was no moon,\n\nthere was no earth;\n\nthere were only the ******* she had given birth\n\nwatching from their next ***** world.\n\nI wrote this poem around age 18 and it was published in the 1976-1977 issue of my college literary journal, Homespun.\n\nWith my daughter, by a waterfall\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nBy a fountain that slowly shed\n\nits rainbows of water, I led\n\nmy youngest daughter.\n\nAnd the rhythm of the waves\n\nthat casually lazed\n\nmade her sleepy as I rocked her.\n\nBy that fountain I finally felt\n\nfulfillment of which I had dreamt\n\nfeeling May’s warm breezes pelt\n\npetals upon me.\n\nAnd I held her close in the crook of my arm\n\nas she slept, breathing harmony.\n\nBy a river that brazenly rolled,\n\nmy daughter and I strolled\n\ntoward the setting sun,\n\nand the cadence of the cold,\n\nchattering waters that flowed\n\nreminded us both of an ancient song,\n\nso we sang it together as we walked along\n\n—unsure of the words, but sure of our love—\n\nas a waterfall sighed and the sun died above.\n\nThis poem was published by my college literary journal, Homespun, in 1977. I believe I wrote it the year before, around age 18.\n\nYou didn't have time\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17\n\nYou didn't have time to love me,\n\nalways hurrying here and hurrying there;\n\nyou didn't have time to love me,\n\nand you didn't have time to care.\n\nYou were playing a reel like a fiddle half-strung:\n\ntoo busy for love, \"too old\" to be young . . .\n\nWell, you didn't have time, and now you have none.\n\nYou didn't have time, and now you have none.\n\nYou didn't have time to take time\n\nand you didn't have time to try.\n\nEvery time I asked you why, you said,\n\n\"Because, my love; that's why.\" And then\n\nyou didn't have time at all, my love.\n\nYou didn't have time at all.\n\nYou were wheeling and diving in search of a sun\n\nthat had blinded your eyes and left you undone.\n\nWell, you didn't have time, and now you have none.\n\nYou didn't have time, and now you have none.\n\nThis is a song-poem that I wrote during my early songwriter phase, around age 17.\n\nSo little time\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nThere is so little time left to summer,\n\nto run through the fields or to swim in the ponds . . .\n\nto be young.\n\nThere is so little time left till autumn shall come.\n\nThere is so little time left for me to be free . . .\n\nso little time, just so, so little time.\n\nIf I were handsome and brawny and brave,\n\na love I would make and the time I would save.\n\nIf I were happy — not hamstrung, but free —\n\nsurely there would be one for me . . .\n\nPerhaps there'd be one.\n\nThere is so little left of the sunshine\n\nalthough there’s much left of the rain . . .\n\nthere is so little left in my life not of strife and of pain.\n\nI seem to remember writing this poem around age 14, in 1972. It was published in my high school journal, the Lantern, in 1976. The inversion in L8 makes me think this was a very early poem. That’s something I weaned myself of pretty quickly. Also, I was extremely depressed from age 14 to 15 because my family moved twice and I had trouble making friends because I was so shy and introverted.\n\n​\n\nPremonition\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nNow the evening has come to a close and the party is over ...\n\nwe stand in the doorway and watch as they go—\n\neach stranger, each acquaintance, each casual lover.\n\nThey walk to their cars and they laugh as they go,\n\nthough we know their forced laughter’s the wine ...\n\nthen they pause at the road where the dark asphalt flows\n\nendlessly on toward Zion ...\n\nand they kiss one another as though they were friends,\n\nand they promise to meet again “soon” ...\n\nbut the rivers of Jordan roll on without end,\n\nand the mockingbird calls to the moon ...\n\nand the katydids climb up the cropped hanging vines,\n\nand the crickets chirp on out of tune ...\n\nand their shadows, defined by the cryptic starlight,\n\nseem spirits torn loose from their tombs.\n\nAnd we know their brief lives are just eddies in time,\n\nthat their hearts are unreadable runes\n\nto be wiped clean, like slate, by the dark hand of Fate\n\nwhen their corpses lie ravaged and ruined ...\n\nYou take my clenched fist and you give it a kiss\n\nas though it were something you loved,\n\nand the tears fill your eyes, brimming with the soft light\n\nof the stars winking sagely above ...\n\nThen you whisper, \"It's time that we went back inside;\n\nif you'd like, we can sit and just talk for a while.\"\n\nAnd the hope in your eyes burns too deep, so I lie\n\nand I say, \"Yes, I would,\" to your small, troubled smile.\n\nI vividly remember writing this poem after an office party the year I co-oped with AT&T (at that time the largest company in the world, with a lot of office parties). This was after my sophomore year in college, making me around 19 years old. The poem is “true” except that I was not the host because the party was at the house of one of the managers. Nor was I dating anyone seriously at the time. I was still in “pool shark” mode, playing money games all night and into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nReflections on the Loss of Vision\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nThe sparrow that cries from the shelter of an ancient oak tree and the squirrels\n\nthat dash in delight through the treetops as the first snow glistens and swirls,\n\nremind me so much of my childhood and how the world seemed to me then,\n\nthat it seems if I tried\n\nand just closed my eyes,\n\nI could once again be nine or ten.\n\nThe rabbits that hide in the bushes where the snowflakes collect as they fall,\n\nhunch there, I know, in the fast-piling snow, yet now I can't see them at all.\n\nFor time slowly weakened my vision; while the patterns seem almost as clear,\n\nsome things that I saw\n\nwhen I was a boy,\n\nare lost to me now in my “advancing” years.\n\nThe chipmunk who seeks out his burrow and the geese now preparing to leave\n\nare there as they were, and yet they are not; and if it seems childish to grieve,\n\nstill, who would condemn a blind man for bemoaning the vision he lost?\n\nWell, in a small way,\n\nthrough the passage of days,\n\nI have learned some of his loss.\n\nAs a keen-eyed young lad I endeavored to see things most adults could not—\n\nthe camouflaged nests of the hoot owls, the woodpecker’s favorite haunts.\n\nBut now I no longer can find them, nor understand how I once could,\n\nand it seems such a waste\n\nof those far-sighted days,\n\nto end up near blind in this wood.\n\nEvery Man Has a Dream\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 24\n\nlines composed at Elliston Square\n\nEvery man has a dream that he cannot quite touch ...\n\na dream of contentment, of soft, starlit rain,\n\nof a breeze in the evening that, rising again,\n\nreminds him of something that cannot have been,\n\nand he calls this dream love.\n\nAnd each man has a dream that he fears to let live,\n\nfor he knows: to succumb is to throw away all.\n\nSo he curses, denies it and locks it within\n\nthe cells of his heart and he calls it a sin,\n\nthis madness, this love.\n\nBut each man in his living falls prey to his dreams,\n\nand he struggles, but so he ensures that he falls,\n\nand he finds in the end that he cannot deny\n\nthe joy that he feels or the tears that he cries\n\nin the darkness of night for this light he calls love.\n\nCanticle: an Aubade\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nMisty morning sunlight hails the dawning of new day;\n\ndreams drift into drowsiness before they fade away.\n\nDew drops on the green grass echo splendors of the sun;\n\nthe silence lauds a songstress and the skillful song she's sung.\n\nAmong the weeping willows the mist clings to the leaves;\n\nand, laughing in the early light among the lemon trees,\n\nthere goes a brace of bees!\n\nDancing in the depthless blue like small, bright bits of steel,\n\nthe butterflies flock to the west and wander through dawn's fields.\n\nAbove the thoughtless traffic of the world wending their way,\n\na flock of mallard geese in v's dash onward as they race.\n\nAnd dozing in the daylight lies a new-born collie pup,\n\ndrinking in bright sunlight through small eyes still tightly shut.\n\nAnd high above the meadows, blazing through the warming air,\n\na shaft of brilliant sunshine has started something there . . .\n\nit looks like summer.\n\nI distinctly remember writing this poem in Ms. Davenport’s class at Maplewood High School. I had read a canticle somewhere, liked the name and concept, and decided I needed to write one myself. I believe this was in 1974 at age 16, but I could be off by a year. This is another early poem that makes me think I had a good natural ear for meter and rhyme. It’s not a great poem, but the music seems pretty good for a beginner.\n\nChildhood's End\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 22\n\nHow well I remember\n\nthose fiery Septembers:\n\ndry leaves, dying embers of summers aflame,\n\nlay trampled before me\n\nand fluttered, imploring\n\nthe bright, dancing rain to descend once again.\n\nNow often I’ve thought on\n\nthe meaning of autumn,\n\nhow the rainbows’ enchantments defeated dark clouds\n\nwhile robins repeated\n\nancient songs sagely heeded\n\nso wisely when winters before they’d flown south ...\n\nAnd still, in remembrance,\n\nI’ve conjured a semblance\n\nof childhood and how the world seemed to me then;\n\nbut early this morning,\n\nwhen, rising and yawning,\n\nI found a gray hair ... it was all beyond my ken.\n\nI believe I wrote this poem in my early twenties, probably around 1980. This is another early poem with an usual form.\n\nRed Dawn\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 14\n\nThe sun, like a spotlight,\n\nis spinning round the trees\n\na web of light.\n\nAnd with her amber radiance\n\nshe is\n\ndriving off the night.\n\nOh, how like a fire\n\nshe is\n\nburning off the black.\n\nAnd in her flaming wake\n\nshe has left a track\n\nof puffy smoke.\n\nI believe this is one of my very earliest poems, written around age 14, due to the fact that the original poem had three somewhat archaic apostrophes: ’round, ’way and ’luminance. I weaned myself of such things pretty quickly. According to my notes, I revised the poem in 1975. It was published in my high school journal, the Lantern, the following year.\n\nThese Hallowed Halls\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nI.\n\nA final stereo fades into silence\n\nand now there is seldom a murmur\n\nto trouble the slumber\n\nof these ancient halls.\n\nI stand by a window where others have watched\n\nthe passage of time, alone,\n\nnot untouched,\n\nand I am as they were—\n\nunsure,\n\nand the days\n\nstretch out ahead,\n\na bewildering maze.\n\nII.\n\nAh, faithless lover—\n\nthat I had never touched your breast,\n\nnor felt the stirrings of my heart,\n\nwhich until that moment had peacefully slept.\n\nFor now I have known the exhilaration\n\nof a heart that has leapt from the pinnacle of love,\n\nand the result of every infatuation—\n\nthe long freefall to earth, as the moon glides above.\n\nIII.\n\nA solitary clock chimes the hour\n\nfrom far above the campus,\n\nbut my peers,\n\nreturning from their dances,\n\nheed it not.\n\nAnd so it is\n\nthat we seldom gauge Time's speed\n\nbecause He moves so unobtrusively\n\nabout His task.\n\nStill, when at last\n\nwe reckon His mark upon our lives,\n\nwe may well be surprised\n\nat His thoroughness.\n\nIV.\n\nUngentle maiden—\n\nwhen Time has etched His little lines\n\nso carelessly across your brow,\n\nperhaps I will love you less than now.\n\nAnd when cruel Time has stolen\n\nyour youth, as He certainly shall in course,\n\nperhaps you will wish you had taken me\n\nalong with my broken heart,\n\neven as He will take you with yours.\n\nV.\n\nA measureless rhythm rules the night—\n\nfew have heard it,\n\nbut I have shared it,\n\nand its secret is mine.\n\nTo put it into words\n\nis as to extract the sweetness from honey\n\nand must be done as gently\n\nas a butterfly cleans its wings.\n\nBut when it is captured, it is gone again;\n\nits usefulness is only\n\nthat it lulls to sleep.\n\nVI.\n\nSo sleep, my love, to the cadence of night,\n\nto the moans of the moonlit hills\n\nthat groan as I do, yet somehow sleep\n\nthrough the nightjar's cryptic trills.\n\nBut I will not sleep this night, nor any...\n\nhow can I, when my dreams\n\nare always of your perfect face\n\nringed in whorls of fretted lace,\n\nand a tear upon your pillowcase?\n\nVII.\n\nIf I had been born when knights roamed the earth\n\nand mad kings ruled foreign lands,\n\nI might have turned to the ministry,\n\nto the solitude of a monastery.\n\nBut there are no monks or hermits today—\n\ntheirs is a lost occupation\n\ncarried on, if at all,\n\nmerely for sake of tradition.\n\nFor today man abhors solitude—\n\nhe craves companions, song and drink,\n\nseldom seeking a quiet moment,\n\nto sit alone by himself, to think.\n\nVIII.\n\nAnd so I cannot shut myself\n\noff from the rest of the world,\n\nto spend my days in philosophy\n\nand my nights in tears of self-sympathy.\n\nNo, I must continue as best I can,\n\nand learn to keep my thoughts away\n\nfrom those glorious, uproarious moments of youth,\n\ncenturies past though lost but a day.\n\nIX.\n\nYes, I must discipline myself\n\nand adjust to these lackluster days\n\nwhen men display no chivalry\n\nand romance is the \"old-fashioned\" way.\n\nX.\n\nA single stereo flares into song\n\nand the first faint light of morning\n\nhas pierced the sky's black awning\n\nonce again.\n\nXI.\n\nThis is a sacred place,\n\nfor those who leave,\n\nleave better than they came.\n\nBut those who stay, while they are here,\n\nadd, with their sleepless nights and tears,\n\nquaint sprigs of ivy to the walls\n\nof these hallowed halls.\n\nI wrote this poem in my freshman dorm at age 18.\n\nPilgrim Mountain\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nI have come to Pilgrim Mountain\n\nto eat icicles and to bathe in the snow.\n\nDo not ask me why I have done this,\n\nfor I do not know . . .\n\nbut I had a vision of the end of time\n\nand I feared for my soul.\n\nOn Pilgrim Mountain the rivers shriek\n\nas they rush toward the valleys, and the rocks\n\ncreak and groan in their misery,\n\nfor they comprehend they’re prey to\n\nnight and day,\n\nand ten thousand other fallacies.\n\nSunlight shatters the stone,\n\nbut midnight mends it again\n\nwith darkness and a cooling flow.\n\nThis is no place for men,\n\nand I know this, but I know\n\nthat that which has been must somehow be again.\n\nNow here on Pilgrim Mountain\n\nI shall gouge my eyes with stone\n\nand tear out all my hair,\n\nand though I die alone,\n\nI shall not care . . .\n\nfor the night will still roll on\n\nabove my weary bones\n\nand these sun-split, shattered stones\n\nof late become their home\n\nhere, on Pilgrim Mountain.\n\nI believe this poem was originally written around 1974 at age 16 or thereabouts. According to my notes, it was modified in 1978, then again in 1983. However, the poem remains very close to the original. I seem to remember writing this poem in Mr. Purcell’s history trailer.\n\nthere is peace where i am going...\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 15\n\nthere is peace where i am going,\n\nfor i hasten to a land\n\nthat has never known the motion\n\nof one windborne grain of sand;\n\nthat has never felt a tidal wave\n\nnor seen a thunderstorm;\n\na land whose endless seasons\n\nin their sameness are one.\n\nthere i will lay my burdens down\n\nand feel their weight no more,\n\nand sleep beneath the unstirred sands\n\nof a soundless ocean's shore,\n\nwhere Time lies motionless in pools\n\nof lost experience\n\nand those who sleep, sleep unaware\n\nof the future, past and present\n\n(and where Love itself lies dormant,\n\nunmoved by a silver crescent) .\n\nand when i lie asleep there,\n\nwith Death's footprints at my feet,\n\nnot a thing shall touch me,\n\nsave bland sand, lain like a sheet\n\nto wrap me for my rest there\n\nand to bind me, lest i dream,\n\nmere clay again,\n\nof strange domains\n\nwhere cruel birth drew such harrowing screams.\n\nyes, there is peace where i am going,\n\nfor i am bound to be\n\nsafe here, within the dull embrace\n\nof this dim, unchanging sea...\n\nbefore too long; i sense it now,\n\nand wait, expectantly,\n\nto feel the listless touch\n\nof Immortality.\n\nThis is one of my early poems, written around age 15 after watching a documentary about Woodstock.\n\nabsinthe sea\n\nby michael r. burch, circa age 18-19\n\ni hold in my hand a goblet of absinthe\n\nthe bitter green liqueur\n\nreflects the dying sunset over the sea\n\nand the darkling liquid froths\n\nup over the rim of my cup\n\nto splash into the free,\n\nchurning waters of the sea\n\ni do not drink\n\ni do not drink the liqueur,\n\nfor I sail on an absinthe sea\n\nthat stretches out unendingly\n\ninto the gathering night\n\nits waters are no less green\n\nand no less bitter,\n\nnor does the sun strike them with a kinder light\n\nthey both harbor night,\n\nand neither shall shelter me\n\nneither shall shelter me\n\nfrom the anger of the wind\n\nor the cruelty of the sun\n\nfor I sail in the goblet of some Great God\n\nwho gazes out over a greater sea,\n\nand when my life is done,\n\nperhaps it will be because\n\nHe lifted His goblet and sipped my sea.\n\nI seem to remember writing this poem in college just because I liked the sound of the word “absinthe.” I had no idea, really, what it was or what it looked or tasted like, beyond something I had read in passing somewhere.\n\nOde to the Sun\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nDay is done . . .\n\non, swift sun.\n\nFollow still your silent course.\n\nFollow your unyielding course.\n\nOn, swift sun.\n\nLeave no trace of where you've been;\n\ngive no hint of what you've seen.\n\nBut, ever as you onward flee,\n\ntouch me, O sun,\n\ntouch me.\n\nNow day is done . . .\n\non, swift sun.\n\nGo touch my love about her face\n\nand warm her now for my embrace;\n\nfor though she sleeps so far away,\n\nwhere she is not, I shall not stay.\n\nGo tell her now I, too, shall come.\n\nGo on, swift sun,\n\ngo on.\n\nPublished by Tucumcari Literary Review\n\nI seem to remember writing this poem toward the end of my senior year in high school, around age 18.\n\nIt's Halloween!\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 20\n\nIf evening falls\n\non graveyard walls\n\nfar softer than a sigh;\n\nif shadows fly\n\nmoon-sickled skies,\n\nwhile children toss their heads\n\nuneasy in their beds,\n\nbeware the witch's eye!\n\nIf goblins loom\n\nwithin the gloom\n\ntill playful pups grow terse;\n\nif birds give up their verse\n\nto comfort chicks they nurse,\n\nwhile children dream weird dreams\n\nof ugly, wiggly things,\n\nbeware the serpent's curse!\n\nIf spirits scream\n\nin haunted dreams\n\nwhile ancient sibyls rise\n\nto plague nightmarish skies\n\none night without disguise,\n\nas children toss about\n\nuneasy, full of doubt,\n\nbeware the Devil's lies . . .\n\nit's Halloween!\n\nI believe I wrote this poem around age 20.\n\nLaughter from Another Room\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 19\n\nLaughter from another room\n\nmocks the anguish that I feel;\n\nas I sit alone and brood,\n\nonly you and I are real.\n\nOnly you and I are real.\n\nOnly you and I exist.\n\nOnly burns that blister heal.\n\nOnly dreams denied persist.\n\nOnly dreams denied persist.\n\nOnly hope that lingers dies.\n\nOnly love that lessens lives.\n\nOnly lovers ever cry.\n\nOnly lovers ever cry.\n\nOnly sinners ever pray.\n\nOnly saints are crucified.\n\nThe crucified are always saints.\n\nThe crucified are always saints.\n\nThe maddest men control the world.\n\nThe dumb man knows what he would say;\n\nthe poet never finds the words.\n\nThe poet never finds the words.\n\nThe minstrel never hits the notes.\n\nThe minister would love to curse.\n\nThe warrior longs to spare his foe.\n\nThe warrior longs to spare his foe.\n\nThe scholar never learns the truth.\n\nThe actors never see the show.\n\nThe hangman longs to feel the noose.\n\nThe hangman longs to feel the noose.\n\nThe artist longs to feel the flame.\n\nThe proudest men are not aloof;\n\nthe guiltiest are not to blame.\n\nThe guiltiest are not to blame.\n\nThe merriest are prone to brood.\n\nIf we go outside, it rains.\n\nIf we stay inside, it floods.\n\nIf we stay inside, it floods.\n\nIf we dare to love, we fear.\n\nBlind men never see the sun;\n\nother men observe through tears.\n\nOther men observe through tears\n\nthe passage of these days of doom;\n\nnow I listen and I hear\n\nlaughter from another room.\n\nLaughter from another room\n\nmocks the anguish that I feel.\n\nAs I sit alone and brood,\n\nonly you and I are real.\n\nI believe I wrote the first version of this poem as a college freshman or sophomore, around age 18 or 19. It remains largely the same as the original poem.\n\nThe Insurrection of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 22\n\nShe was my Shilo, my Gethsemane;\n\nshe nestled my head to her immaculate breast\n\nas she breathed into my insensate lips\n\nthe soft benedictions of her ecstatic sighs . . .\n\nBut those veiled allegations of her disconsolate tears!\n\nYears I abided the agile assaults of her flesh . . .\n\nShe loved me the most when I was most sorely pressed;\n\nshe undressed with delight for her ministrations\n\nwhen all I needed was a moment’s rest . . .\n\nShe anointed my lips with strange dews at her perilous breast;\n\nthe insurrection of sighs left me fallen, distressed, at her elegant heel.\n\nI felt the hard iron, the cold steel, in her words and I knew:\n\nthe terrible arrow showed through my conscripted flesh.\n\nThe sun in retreat left her Victor, then all was Night.\n\nLate ap-peals of surrender went sinking and dying—unheard.\n\nAccording to my notes, I wrote this poem at age 22 in 1980, must have forgotten about it, then revised it on January 31, 1999. But I wasn’t happy with the first stanza and revised the poem again on September 22, 2023, a mere 43 years after I wrote the original version! The \"ap-peals\" wordplay was a 2023 revision. The only \"ap\" I had in high school was Pong.\n\nSea Dreams\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nI.\n\nIn timeless days\n\nI've crossed the waves\n\nof seaways seldom seen.\n\nBy the last low light of evening\n\nthe breakers that careen\n\nthen dive back to the deep\n\nhave rocked my ship to sleep,\n\nand so I've known the peace\n\nof a soul at last at ease\n\nthere where Time's waters run\n\nin concert with the sun.\n\nWith restless waves\n\nI've watched the days'\n\nslow movements, as they hum\n\ntheir antediluvian songs.\n\nSometimes I've sung along,\n\nmy voice as soft and low\n\nas the sea's, while evening slowed\n\nto waver at the dim\n\nmysterious moonlit rim\n\nof dreams no man has known.\n\nIn thoughtless flight,\n\nI've scaled the heights\n\nand soared a scudding breeze\n\nover endless arcing seas\n\nof waves ten miles high.\n\nI've sheared the sable skies\n\non wings as soft as sighs\n\nand stormed the sun-pricked pitch\n\nof sunset's scarlet-stitched,\n\nebullient dark demise.\n\nI've climbed the sun-cleft clouds\n\nten thousand leagues or more\n\nabove the windswept shores\n\nof seas no man has sailed\n\n— great seas as grand as hell's,\n\nshores littered with the shells\n\nof men's \"immortal\" souls —\n\nand I've warred with dark sea-holes\n\nwhose open mouths implored\n\ntheir depths to be explored.\n\nAnd I've grown and grown and grown\n\ntill I thought myself the king\n\nof every silver thing...\n\nBut sometimes late at night\n\nwhen the sorrowing wavelets sing\n\nsad songs of other times,\n\nI taste the windborne rime\n\nof a well-remembered day\n\non the whipping ocean spray,\n\nand I bow my head to pray...\n\nII.\n\nIt's been a long, hard day;\n\nsometimes I think I work too hard.\n\nTonight I'd like to take a walk\n\ndown by the sea —\n\ndown by those salty waves\n\nbrined with the scent of Infinity,\n\ndown by that rocky shore,\n\ndown by those cliffs that I used to climb\n\nwhen the wind was **** with a taste of lime\n\nand every dream was a sailor's dream.\n\nThen small waves broke light,\n\nall frothy and white,\n\nover the reefs in the ramblings of night,\n\nand the pounding sea\n\n—a mariner's dream—\n\nwas bound to stir a boy's delight\n\nto such a pitch\n\nthat he couldn't desist,\n\nbut was bound to splash through the surf in the light\n\nof ten thousand stars, all shining so bright.\n\nChrist, those nights were fine,\n\nlike a well-aged wine,\n\nyet more scalding than fire\n\nwith the marrow's desire.\n\nThen desire was a fire\n\nburning wildly within my bones,\n\nfiercer by far than the frantic foam...\n\nand every wish was a moan.\n\nOh, for those days to come again!\n\nOh, for a sea and sailing men!\n\nOh, for a little time!\n\nIt's almost nine\n\nand I must be back home by ten,\n\nand then... what then?\n\nI have less than an hour to stroll this beach,\n\nless than an hour old dreams to reach...\n\nAnd then, what then?\n\nTonight I'd like to play old games—\n\ngames that I used to play\n\nwith the somber, sinking waves.\n\nWhen their wraithlike fists would reach for me,\n\nI'd dance between them gleefully,\n\nmocking their witless craze\n\n—their eager, unchecked craze—\n\nto batter me to death\n\nwith spray as light as breath.\n\nOh, tonight I'd like to sing old songs—\n\nsongs of the haunting moon\n\ndrawing the tides away,\n\nsongs of those sultry days\n\nwhen the sun beat down\n\ntill it cracked the ground\n\nand the sea gulls screamed\n\nin their agony\n\nto touch the cooling clouds.\n\nThe distant cooling clouds.\n\nThen the sun shone bright\n\nwith a different light\n\nover different lands,\n\nand I was always a pirate in flight.\n\nOh, tonight I'd like to dream old dreams,\n\nif only for a while,\n\nand walk perhaps a mile\n\nalong this windswept shore,\n\na mile, perhaps, or more,\n\nremembering those days,\n\nsafe in the soothing spray\n\nof the thousand sparkling streams\n\nthat rush into this sea.\n\nI like to slumber in the caves\n\nof a sailor's dark sea-dreams...\n\noh yes, I'd love to dream,\n\nto dream\n\nand dream\n\nand dream.\n\nAs the Flame Flowers\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nAs the flame flowers, a flower, aflame,\n\narches leaves skyward, aching for rain,\n\nbut all it encounters are anguish and pain\n\nas the flame sputters sparks that ignite at its stem.\n\nYet how this frail flower aflame at the stem\n\nreaches through night, through the staggering pain,\n\nfor a sliver of silver that sparkles like rain,\n\nas it flutters in fear of the flowering flame.\n\nMesmerized by a wavering crescent-shaped gem\n\nthat glistens like water though drier than sand,\n\nthe flower extends itself, trembles, and then\n\ndies as scorched leaves burst aflame in the wind.\n\nAshes\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18-19\n\nA fire is dying;\n\nashes remain . . .\n\nashes and anguish,\n\nashes and pain.\n\nA fire is fading\n\nthough once it burned bright . . .\n\nashes once embers\n\nare ashes tonight.\n\nA midnight shade of blue\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nYou thought you saw a shadow moving somewhere in the night—\n\na lost and lonely stranger searching for a little light—\n\nso you told me to approach him, ask him if he'd like a room . . .\n\nhow sweet of you to think of someone wandering in the gloom,\n\nbut he was only\n\na midnight shade of blue.\n\nI thought I saw an answer shining somewhere in the night—\n\na spark of truth irradiating wisdom sweet and bright—\n\nbut when I sought to seize it, to bring it home to you . . .\n\nit fluttered through my fingers like a wispy curlicue,\n\nfor it was only\n\na midnight shade of blue.\n\nWe thought that we had found true love together in the night—\n\na love as fine and elegant as wine by candlelight—\n\nbut when we woke this morning, we knew it wasn't true . . .\n\nthe \"love\" we'd shared was less than love; I guess we owe it to\n\nemotion,\n\nand a midnight shade of blue.\n\nI seem to remember writing this one during my early songwriting phase. That would be around 1974, give or take. While I don’t claim it’s a great poem, I think I did show a pretty good touch with meter in my youth.\n\nGentry\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nThe men shined their shoes\n\nand the ladies chose their clothes;\n\nthe rifle stocks were varnished\n\ntill they were untarnished\n\nby a speck of dust.\n\nThe men trimmed their beards;\n\nthe ladies rouged their lips;\n\nthe horses were groomed\n\nuntil the time loomed\n\nfor them to ride.\n\nThe men mounted their horses,\n\nthe ladies did the same;\n\nthen in search of game they went,\n\na pleasant time they spent,\n\nand killed the fox.\n\nThis poem was published in my college literary journal, Homespun, and was probably written around age 18 in high school.\n\nBeckoning\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 17-18\n\nYesterday\n\nthe wind whispered my name\n\nwhile the blazing locks\n\nof her rampant mane\n\nlay heavy on mine.\n\nAnd yesterday\n\nI saw the way\n\nthe wind caressed tall pines\n\nin forests laced by glinting streams\n\nand thick with tangled vines.\n\nAnd though she reached\n\nfor me in her sleep,\n\nthe touch I felt was Time's.\n\nI wrote this poem around age 17 or 18.\n\nDamp Days\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 16\n\nThese are damp days,\n\nand the earth is slick and vile\n\nwith the smell of month-old mud.\n\nAnd yet it seldom rains;\n\na never-ending drizzle\n\ndrenches spring's bright buds\n\ntill they droop as though in death.\n\nNow Time\n\ndrags out His endless hours\n\nas though to bore to tears\n\nHis fretting, edgy servants\n\nthrough the sheer length of His days\n\nand slow passage of His years.\n\nDamp days are His domain.\n\nIrritation\n\ngrinds the ravaged nerves\n\nand grips tight the gorging brain\n\nwhich fills itself, through sense,\n\nwith vast morasses of clumped clay\n\nwhile the temples throb in pain\n\nat the thought of more damp days.\n\nI believe I wrote the first version of this poem sometime between 1974 and 1976, then revised it around 1978.\n\nEaster, in Jerusalem\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 15-16\n\nThe streets are hushed from fervent song,\n\nfor strange lights fill the sky tonight.\n\nA slow mist creeps\n\nup and down the streets\n\nand a star has vanished that once burned bright.\n\nOh Bethlehem, Bethlehem,\n\nwho tends your flocks tonight?\n\n\"Feed my sheep,\"\n\n\"Feed my sheep,\"\n\na Shepherd calls\n\nthrough the markets and the cattle stalls,\n\nbut a fiery sentinel has passed from sight.\n\nGolgotha shudders uneasily,\n\nthen wearily settles to sleep again,\n\nand I wonder how they dream\n\nwho beat him till he screamed,\n\n\"Father, forgive them!\"\n\nAh Nazareth, Nazareth,\n\nnow sunken deep into dark sleep,\n\ndo you heed His plea\n\nas demons flee,\n\n\"Feed my sheep,\"\n\n\"Feed my sheep . . .\"\n\nThe temple trembles violently,\n\na veil lies ripped in two,\n\nand a good man lies\n\non a mountainside\n\nwhose heart was shattered too.\n\nGalilee, oh Galilee,\n\ndo your waters pulse and froth?\n\n\"Feed my sheep,\"\n\n\"Feed my sheep,\"\n\nthe waters creep\n\nto form a starlit cross.\n\nAccording to my notes, I wrote this poem around age 15-16.\n\nAn Obscenity Trial\n\nby Michael R. Burch, age 18\n\nThe defendant was a poet held in many iron restraints\n\nagainst whom several critics cited numerous complaints.\n\nThey accused him of trying to reach the \"common crowd,\"\n\nand they said his poems incited recitals far too loud.\n\nThe prosecutor alleged himself most artful (and best-dressed);\n\nit seems he’d never lost a case, nor really once been pressed.\n\nHe was known far and wide for intensely hating clarity;\n\ntwelve dilettantes at once declared the defendant another fatality.\n\nThe judge was an intellectual well-known for his great mind,\n\nthough not for being merciful, honest, sane or kind.\n\nClerics loved the \"Hanging Judge\" and the critics were his kin.\n\nBystanders said, \"They'll crucify him!\" The public was not let in.\n\nThe prosecutor began his case by spitting in the poet's face,\n\nknowing the trial would be a farce.\n\n\"It is obscene,\" he screamed, \"to expose the naked heart!\"\n\nThe recorder (bewildered Society), well aware of his notoriety,\n\ngreeted this statement with applause.\n\n\"This man is no poet. Just look—his Hallmark shows it.\n\nWhy, see, he utilizes rhyme, symmetry and grammar! He speaks without a stammer!\n\nHis sense of rhythm is too fine!\n\nHe does not use recondite words or conjure ancient Latin verbs.\n\nThis man is an impostor!\n\nI ask that his sentence be . . . the almost perceptible indignity\n\nof removal from the Post-Modernistic roster!\"\n\nThe jury left, in tears of joy, literally sequestered.\n\nThe defendant sighed in mild despair, \"Might I not answer to my peers?\"\n\nBut how His Honor giggled then,\n\nseeing no "
