The main purpose of this series is to provide an indepth, scholarly overview of each topic, along with explorations of critical themes. The idea for this book was conceived on a plane ride between Norfolk and San Diego that I (GE) shared with my oldest daughter, Katherine, in March 2005. We were talking and joking about a variety of things when she observed that someone really should do a book on HBO. I immediately fell in love with her suggestion, and I have never looked back. Kate has also contributed to this project as a research assistant and in digitizing a number of the images that appear. Needless to say, we’ve enjoyed innumerable hours together watching and discussing HBO programming, along with my wife, Nan, and younger daughter, Mary Ellen. Jeff Jones, too, has been involved as my partner on this project from almost the beginning. Together, we designed the format and organizational scheme and recruited the various contributors, co-editing the chapters as they came in. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the other authors who contributed their work to this collection. Each one added an indispensable dimension from his or her own special perspective. Jeff and I learned a great deal from all of our colleagues on this project, and we fully enjoyed working with each and every one of them. Most of all, though, I’d like to thank Jeff for making the collaborative process of completing this book a pleasure from start to ﬁnish. Neither this book nor this series would ever have seen the light of day\n\nvii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nwithout the unﬂagging encouragement and enthusiasm of Leila Salisbury. She ﬁrst sparked my interest in developing the series by sending me a copy of The Essential Agrarian Reader, a 2003 publication from the University Press of Kentucky, and suggesting that the kind of approach taken in this collection might work with a wide assortment of media and culture subjects. I agreed immediately and let that initial prompt percolate in the back of my mind for a while until everything took shape with this HBO project. This is the third book that I’ve done with Leila, and as always, working with her has been a delightful and rewarding experience. I also want to thank her assistant Will McKay, production manager Richard Farkas, publicity manager Mack McCormick, and the rest of their always helpful colleagues at the University Press of Kentucky who helped Jeff and me see this book from proposal to publication. Thanks too to Dean Chandra de Silva of the College of Arts and Letters at Old Dominion University for his generous support in funding the index, and to Dr. Marty Norden for creating a superb one. Finally, I express my deepest thanks and appreciation to my family and friends for their continuing love and support. G.E. I (JJ) wish to thank Horace Newcomb, to whom I dedicate this book, for insisting that once I had a bona ﬁde job after leaving graduate school, it was my duty as a television studies scholar to subscribe to HBO. The narratives I found there (ﬁction and nonﬁction) have led me to believe that television is not just America’s “most popular art,” but also one of America’s most important and provocative art forms at this moment in time. I also wish to thank my wife, Shana, for the thought-provoking and enjoyable discussions that always accompany our watching HBO together. Although she declared war on the network for canceling Deadwood, the network redeemed itself in our household by offering The Wire as a substitute. Producers and writers David Simon and Ed Burns deserve thanks for bringing the tragedy that is Baltimore to the attention of the American public. Having lived in Baltimore, I am embarrassed and ashamed that our nation ﬁnds such poverty, injustice, and the breakdown of civil society acceptable, especially four decades after the publication of Michael Harrington’s The Other America. But I appreciate daring writers\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nand programming executives who are willing to produce what amounts to real-life stories and make them both compelling and heartbreaking. I also wish to thank the newest addition to my family—Andrew Campbell Jones—for reminding me of the unbridled joy life can be and of the human need for uproarious bouts of belly laughter. Finally, I am indebted to my friend and mentor Gary Edgerton for including me in this project, for his continual support, guidance, and patience, and for his winning spirit and always pleasant disposition. Working hard is so much more enjoyable when people like Gary are along for the ride. J.J.\n\nix\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA Brief History of HBO Gary R. Edgerton\n\nThe founding of Home Box Ofﬁce Inc. (HBO) was a harbinger of something new and innovative that was happening to television as an industry and a technology during the early to mid-1970s. Cable entrepreneur Charles Dolan ﬁrst conceived of the network in 1971 as the Green Channel. He was the owner of Sterling Communications, a growing cable concern in the New York metropolitan area that was largely subsidized by Time Inc. Dolan began work on the Green Channel with seed money from Time, hiring the thirty-three-year-old Wall Street lawyer Gerald Levin as part of his start-up team. Dolan and his associates renamed their channel Home Box Ofﬁce, reﬂecting their theaterlike conception of a subscription television (STV) service that would primarily offer ﬁrst-run movies and sporting events to its paying customers. HBO was based on an entirely different economic model than the one followed by the three major broadcast networks (CBS, NBC, and ABC), their afﬁliates, and the country’s independent stations, which all sold speciﬁc audiences (most recently targeting young urban professional viewers above all others) to sponsors. Unlike this advertiser-supported system, HBO’s subscriber format focused all of the channel’s attention on pleasing and retaining its viewing audience. HBO and the other fortyﬁve aspiring local and regional pay cable channels then trying to survive in America’s media marketplace were shifting the center of gravity in this sector of the television industry away from advertisers and more toward serving the needs and desires of their monthly customers.1 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), ABC (as the onetime perennial third network), local television stations, and especially movie theater owners long resisted STV. Much of this opposition sub-\n\n1\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\nsided once the FCC “adopted a ‘hands off’ approach” with its “1968 Fourth Report and Order that opened the door to the creation of permanent subscription TV services.”2 The biggest concern of these recently created STV companies was simply providing programming that was attractive enough for viewers to sign up, pay a monthly fee, and stay connected to the service on a long-term basis. For its part, HBO debuted on November 8, 1972, telecasting Sometimes a Great Notion (1971), starring Paul Newman, and a National Hockey League game to a mere 365 cable-subscriber households in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Three months and $1 million in losses later, Time Inc. ﬁred Dolan and instated Gerald Levin as the new president of HBO. Levin kept HBO aﬂoat for two more years before betting the network’s future on signing a sixyear, $7.5 million contract that allowed the channel access to RCA’s newly launched communication satellite, Satcom 1, during the fall of 1975. On October 1, 1975, HBO inaugurated its satellite-cable service with the much-ballyhooed “Thrilla in Manila” heavyweight boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. This brutal fourteenround bout, won by Ali, was a hugely popular success for all concerned, especially the struggling three-year-old pay-TV company that carried the ﬁght live from overseas. In one fell swoop, HBO became a national network, ushering in television’s cable era (1976–94) with its ﬁrst full year of regularly scheduled satellite-delivered programming. Like America itself, television has always existed in a state of transformation, being continually reshaped and occasionally reinvented by a wide assortment of technological, commercial, and social factors. TV in the United States grew from a local to a regional medium during the 1940s and 1950s, ﬁnally becoming the centerpiece of national culture at the start of the 1960s. The three-network oligopoly that ruled the television industry in the United States during the network era (1948– 75) was slowly withering away by the 1980s, as were the annual $100 million-plus proﬁt margins that the top-down mass-market structure regularly provided for CBS, NBC, and ABC. These broadcast networks had achieved a kind of parity following ABC’s rise to number one in the ratings during the mid- to late 1970s. Together, they survived the profound technological and economic conversion that remodeled TV into a multi-network niche-market industry after 1976. Along with this structural changeover, however, the three major networks started to lose 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nHBO inaugurated its satellite-cable service on October 1, 1975, with the much-ballyhooed “Thrilla in Manila” heavyweight boxing match between Muhammad Ali (right) and Joe Frazier (left).\n\n“their near total dominance of the television market,” as well as much of “their swagger, their corporate identities and perhaps also their hallowed traditions.”3 An estimated 70.5 million households, or 96.4 percent of the nation, owned TV sets in 1976; by 1994, these ﬁgures had grown to 94.2 million, or 98.3 percent of all residences (ﬁve percentage points higher than the number of American homes that had telephones).4 More signiﬁcantly, the typical TV household in the United States received on average only 7.2 channels in 1970; this climbed slightly to 10.2 in 1980, before rising dramatically to 27.2 in 1990. 5 An increasing number of viewing options was an essential part of television’s second age during the cable era, as the three-network bottleneck was broken beyond repair with the rise of cable and satellite TV. Although the ﬁrst TV satellite, Telstar 1, was launched in July 1962, American television never fully realized its international promise until satellites and cable once again reinvented the medium after 1975. In the case of HBO, subscriptions grew rapidly from 15,000 to 287,199 in 3\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\n1976 alone. By the end of 1977, HBO had 600,000 customers, enabling this pay-TV network to turn a proﬁt for the ﬁrst time. “HBO quickly became an incredible cash cow,” reports George Mair in Inside HBO, “eventually outstripping” in proﬁtability “the all-important magazine division” at Time Inc. 6 As a result, other basic and premium cable networks followed HBO’s example of choosing satellite over terrestrial microwave delivery. Ted Turner took WTBS national via Satcom 1 in December 1976, while the Chicago-based Tribune Company similarly converted WGN into a superstation in October 1978. Another movie channel, Showtime, was created by Viacom in July 1976 and began satellite transmission in 1978. Niche channels of all sorts emerged during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including CBN (the Christian Broadcasting Network) and the USA Network (a broad-based entertainment channel) in 1977; ESPN (Entertainment and Sports Programming Network), Nickelodeon (children’s programming), and C-SPAN (CableSatellite Public Affairs Network) in 1979; CNN (Cable News Network), BET (Black Entertainment Television), and TLC (The Learning Channel) in 1980; MTV (Music Television) and FNN (Financial News Network) in 1981; and CNN Headline News and The Weather Channel in 1982. “In stimulating the creation of a wide variety of new satellite networks,” HBO became, according to Les Brown, “the engine that was pulling cable.”7 The network’s own subscriber base skyrocketed to 13 million by 1983; cable adoption throughout the United States spread from 15.3 percent of all TV households in 1976 to 21.7 percent in 1980 to 39.3 percent in 1983. 8 The addition of satellites was transforming the cable business beyond recognition. As early as 1948, community antenna television (CATV), or cable TV, was merely the means by which television signals were brought into hard-to-reach rural and mountainous regions. By the mid-1960s, the number of CATV systems had grown to more than 750 in nearly 40 states, so the FCC started regulating cable, for the most part to ensure that all local stations were being carried in their respective markets and were not being duplicated by any imported signals. In 1972, the FCC also lifted its restrictions on allowing CATV service into the nation’s major metropolitan areas. Cable was no longer just the last resort for bringing television into the most out-of-the-way places in the country; instead, it had evolved into a fee-based TV alter4\n\nIntroduction\n\nGerald Levin’s plan for HBO to combine cable with satellite delivery was the ﬁnal innovation needed to usher in the cable era. As a result, Channels magazine dubbed Levin “the man who started the revolution” in 1976.\n\nnative that offered urban, suburban, and rural viewers many more channels than ever before with much better reception. Gerald Levin’s plan for HBO to combine cable with satellite delivery was the ﬁnal innovation needed to usher in the cable era. A second television age was ofﬁcially under way by 1976, when Channels magazine dubbed Levin “the man who started the revolution.”9 In turn, the rise of cable and satellite TV left CBS, NBC, and ABC in a kind of freefall; they shared just 67 percent of the available prime-time audience by the end of the 1980s (down from a high of 93.6 percent in 1975), with no end in sight to their spiraling downward.10 During the early 1990s, the ascent of cable television and the descent of the traditional broadcast networks was an unmistakable and irreversible foregone conclusion. Cable’s penetration in the United States rose from 42.8 percent in 1985 to 63.4 percent in 1994.11 At the beginning of the 1990s, basic cable attracted 20 percent of all prime-time viewers, and premium channels such as HBO added another 6 percent.12 Both these ﬁgures would double again over the next decade. The whole TV viewing experience was changing for most Americans. The timeshifting capability of the videocassette recorder (VCR) was a welcome 5\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\naddition for most television viewers in the 1980s. Only 1.1 percent of TV households in the United States had VCRs in 1980; this number climbed to 20.8 percent in 1985 and reached 79 percent by 1994.13 Along with the VCR came remote control keypads. These small handheld devices were ﬁrst introduced in the mid-1950s, but they did not become commonplace in American homes until the widespread adoption of cable and VCRs during the 1980s. “There’s no doubt that the remote control switch revolutionized the way we watched TV in the ’80s,” announced TV Guide in January 1990. By 1991, 37 percent of domestic viewers admitted that they preferred channel surﬁng (or quickly ﬂipping through the 33.2 channels they now received on average) to turning on their television sets to watch just one speciﬁc program.14 Consumers at home were slowly becoming more proactive in their TV viewing behavior; their adoption of these new television accessories aided in the industry’s wholesale transition from broadcasting to narrowcasting (targeting a narrower, more deﬁned audience), as consumers searched out what they wanted to watch as never before. Likewise, the cable sector of the television industry was already taking steps to supplement its licensing of older off-network programs and Hollywood movies with original productions tailor-made to the individual speciﬁcations of each channel’s target audience. HBO led the way in this regard by producing its ﬁrst original series, Not Necessarily the News, and its ﬁrst made-for-pay-TV movie, The Terry Fox Story, in 1983, followed by its ﬁrst miniseries, All the Rivers Run, in 1984. The cable sector “eclipsed broadcasting’s assets and revenue values by the late 1980s.” In its “short history,” cable television had already “redeﬁned television,” argues Sharon Strover. “It spawned a huge variety of ‘narrowcast’ programming services.”15 A niche-market model supplanted the old way of doing business throughout the American economy beginning in the mid-1970s. For television in particular, made-to-order series by a new generation of creative writer–producers replaced the twodecade-long dominance of Hollywood’s cookie-cutter mode of teleﬁlm production. The best and most-inﬂuential new programs on both the broadcast networks (such as NBC’s Hill Street Blues [1981–87]) and cable (such as Showtime’s It’s Garry Shandling’s Show [1986–90], which later was revamped as The Larry Sanders Show [1992–98] on HBO) deﬁed easy classiﬁcation while attracting a preponderance of young 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nurban professional viewers. The broader economic beneﬁts of consumer segmentation also rendered the increasingly outdated mass-market model of the network era obsolete. In turn, branding became the standard way in which networks and production companies differentiated their programming from the competition. The executive team that directed HBO in the late 1970s—Gerald Levin, Frank Biondi, and Michael Fuchs—realized even then that restricting their activities to being merely the wholesaler or intermediary between the movie studios and the nation’s growing cable companies was a dead-end arrangement for HBO. Levin decided in tandem with Biondi and Fuchs that HBO needed to situate itself squarely in the content-development, not the transmission, business. They understood that average American viewers didn’t care whether they saw their movies in theaters, broadcast over the air, by cable, or, beginning in the late 1970s, on videotape. Consumers just wanted convenient entertainment at affordable prices. Being both between and a part of the television, motion picture, and home video industries, HBO was perfectly positioned to diversify into original TV and movie production, home video, and international distribution, even as these once-separate entertainment sectors were beginning to converge into one globally expanding entertainment industry by the mid-1980s. Long before the term became fashionable, HBO was a brand that became indistinguishable from the notion of subscription television during the 1970s. More speciﬁcally, HBO’s original image or utility brand was linked primarily to its function of providing Hollywood motion pictures to cable viewers in the comfort of their own homes, despite the fact that it also produced and telecast occasional stand-up comedy, sports, and music specials. The major problem with basing a company’s brand loyalty on the most prominent product that it provided was that there invariably appeared competitors who were willing and able to supply the public with the same service as the original seller. Viacom’s Showtime was created soon after HBO in 1976 and began satellite transmission in 1978; Warner Amex launched The Movie Channel in 1979; Time/HBO countered by creating Cinemax in 1980; and Times-Mirror began Spotlight in 1981. That same year, moreover, the Justice Department prevented Twentieth Century-Fox, Universal, Paramount, Columbia, and Getty Oil from producing their own pay movie channel, Premiere, on the 7\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\nground that it was monopolistic. HBO asserted its dominance as the channel that viewers most associated with movies; but by the 1990s, it also greatly expanded its output of original series, miniseries, made-forpay-TV movies, documentaries, stand-up comedy, and sports in order to compete. When former HBO chairman and CEO Chris Albrecht was ﬁrst promoted to programming chief in 1995, he called his executive staff together for a two-day meeting with the blessing of his boss, Jeffrey Bewkes, and asked them, “Do we really believe that we are who we say we are? This distinctive, high-quality, edgy, worth-paying-for service?” Albrecht remembered that the silence in the room was deafening. The executive team at HBO, headed by Bewkes, then began the slow and deliberate process of building “an outstanding one-of-a-kind programming service,” because being an “occasional use” cable channel was “no longer sustainable” in the survival-of-the-ﬁttest world that was then materializing with the emergence of digital television and the widespread adoption of the Internet.16 The pivotal innovation that shifted consumer interest beyond cable TV into the wondrous new world of cyberspace was the introduction of the ﬁrst commercially available graphical browser, Netscape Navigator 1.0, on December 15, 1994, which made web travel relatively easy for the vast majority of Americans outside of the exclusive domain of computer scientists and other high-tech specialists. HBO transformed the creative landscape of television during the ﬁrst decade (1995–2004) of TV’s current digital era. It pursued the unusual and atypical strategy for television of investing more money in program development (from $2 million to $4 million per prime-time hour), limiting output (thirteen episodes per series each year instead of the usual twenty-two to twentysix), and producing only the highest-quality series, miniseries, madefor-pay-TV movies, documentaries, and specials that it could. Along with a handful of other channels, such as MTV, ESPN, CNN, and Fox News, HBO established as strong an identity brand as there was on television. This spilled over into its overseas expansion (beginning with Latin America, Europe, and Asia), its DVD sales, its theatrical releases, its syndication of its own series on other channels (starting with The Larry Sanders Show on Bravo in 2002 and Sex and the City on TBS in 2004), and its production of original programs for other networks (such as Everybody Loves Raymond for CBS between 1996 and 2005). In 8\n\nIntroduction\n\n1997, Time Warner’s then-chairman Gerald Levin remembered, “Twentyﬁve years ago, HBO invented a new form of television.” Reﬂecting on the current state of the entertainment industry, he added, “HBO, the brand, is so powerful and HBO, the concept, is so dynamic that it’s entering the digital future with the creative edge qualitatively superior to our competition.”17 In this way, HBO is also an idea or identity brand. Ever since 1996, the network has been marketed with the tag line, “It’s Not TV, It’s HBO.” What this branding slogan implies is that the series and specials produced by and presented on HBO are a qualitative cut above your usual run-of-the-mill television programming. By the late 1990s, HBO had emerged as the TV equivalent of a designer label. When Michael Fuchs assumed the top job at the network in 1985, his dual emphases were to increase the amount of HBO’s original programming and to establish a growing presence for the network overseas. To his credit, he succeeded on both counts. Levin, Biondi, and Fuchs hired Sheila Nevins in 1979 to develop the network’s documentary unit. She gradually built up the division and began executive producing a series of brash and gritty reality-based programs throughout the mid- to late 1980s, including the network’s ﬁrst Oscar winner (Down and Out in America) in 1986 and ﬁrst Emmy winner (Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam) in 1987, under the auspices of HBO’s ongoing signature nonﬁction series, America Undercover, which debuted in 1983. Michael Fuchs also enjoyed a good working relationship with his talented ﬁnance vice president and manager, Jeffrey Bewkes, and together they brought Chris Albrecht to HBO in 1985. Albrecht immediately proved his value to the network by producing the ﬁrst Comic Relief special the next year. Fuchs supported a signiﬁcant increase in made-for-pay-TV movie productions under the banner of HBO Films, as well as Robert Altman and Garry Trudeau’s campaign mockumentary Tanner ’88 (1988), a miniseries that won wide acclaim and another Emmy for the network. Michael Fuchs additionally invested heavily in more original comedy programs, including a wide array of cutting-edge stand-up specials through HBO Downtown Productions and a handful of 30-minute series such as the one-of-a-kind talk show parody The Larry Sanders Show, which debuted in 1992 and lasted six years, eventually winning a prestigious Peabody Award. Of note, Fuchs made a concerted effort to 9\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\nenhance HBO’s brand awareness by launching the company’s ﬁrst-ever national image advertising campaign, “Simply the Best,” in 1989. This initiative started the lengthy and expensive process of changing the overall impression of HBO from that of a ﬁrst-run movie service to that of a premium network that produces and presents the most innovative original programming on television along with its usual lineup of feature ﬁlms. As media technologies converged in the 1980s and 1990s, HBO expanded its repertoire to take full advantage of this transformation. HBO was the ﬁrst pay cable channel to scramble its signal to combat piracy, in 1986; to offer its service on direct broadcast satellite, in 1994; and to adopt digital compression transmission, enabling it to “multiplex” (split its signal into two or more channels, thus expanding its service), in 1994. In 1998, HBO developed multiplexing further by creating the megabrand HBO the Works, a collection of channels that includes HBO2, HBO Signature, HBO Family, HBO Comedy and HBO Zone (added in 1999), and HBO Latino (added in 2000); and the network introduced the video-on-demand service HBO on Demand in 2001. With HBO’s array of technological and programming innovations growing, Jeffrey Bewkes enlisted his executive vice president for marketing, Eric Kessler, to create an identity brand to complement the network’s renewed focus. HBO thus set out to intensify its connection with its subscriber base like never before. Bewkes allocated “$25 million a year just to advertise the HBO brand,” and Kessler and his team kicked off a new ad campaign on October 20, 1996, which was the beginning of “one of TV’s all-time great tag lines—It’s Not TV, It’s HBO.”18 Five years later, HBO had become the hottest destination on television. From 1996 to 2001, it increased its original programming from 25 to 40 percent of its entire schedule.19 In that way, the branding line “It’s Not TV, It’s HBO” marked a transitional moment in the industry, when cable and satellite channels rather than the traditional broadcast networks became the ﬁrst place to look for breakout programming. HBO had already established Sunday night as its own must-see-TV evening of viewing with such innovative original series as Sex and the City in 1998 and The Sopranos in 1999. Those two series were simply the tip of an iceberg that in hindsight included such dramatic series as Oz (1997–2003), Six Feet Under (2001–5), The Wire (2002–), and Deadwood (2004–); 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nmade-for-pay-TV movies such as And the Band Played On (1993), Gia (1998), and Lackawanna Blues (2005); miniseries such as From the Earth to the Moon (1998), Band of Brothers (2001), and Angels in America (2003); comedies such as Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000–) and Real Time with Bill Maher (2003–); sports shows such as Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel (1995–) and On the Record with Bob Costas (2001–); six Oscar-winning documentaries between 1999 and 2004 alone; and theatrical releases such as Spellbound (2002), American Splendor (2003), and Maria Full of Grace (2004), which eventually were telecast on HBO after their initial runs in movie theaters. HBO epitomized “appointment TV” (programming that viewers build into their daily schedules) for its 28.2 million subscriber households in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006 (a ﬁgure that marked a slow but steady 2.6 percent increase in two years). 20 During the ﬁrst decade of TV’s digital era, American audiences were watching more television than ever before. According to Nielsen Media Research, the typical TV household in the United States had its set turned on for 7 hours and 15 minutes a day in 1995; for 7 hours and 26 minutes a day in 2000; and for a whopping 8 hours and 11 minutes a day by 2005. 21 Moreover, the average number of available channels shot up from 43.0 in 1997 to 96.4 in 2005. Of these, individual viewers spent the vast majority of their time watching just 10.3 networks of choice in 1997, increasing this total to 16.3 in 2005.22 HBO was one of those networks of choice for more than 26 percent of the 110.2 million TV households in the United States. HBO subscribers were also more than just viewers; they were paying customers who shelled out approximately $15 a month to obtain the service. No longer were they settling for the least objectionable programming they could ﬁnd: they were looking for something different, challenging, and more original on HBO, particularly since they were paying a monthly fee just to tune in. Most importantly, HBO posted nearly $1.1 billion in proﬁts during both 2004 and 2005 for its parent conglomerate, Time Warner—up from its previous record-setting marks of $725 million in 2002 and $960 million in 2003. 23 These were the highest annual yields earned by any network in the history of television. In addition, HBO’s dramatic inﬂuence became evident on other cable and broadcast networks with the debuts of such series as FX’s The Shield in 2002, Nip/Tuck in 2003, and Rescue Me in 2004—all nur11\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\ntured by then–network chief and former HBO executive Peter Liguori— as well as Fox’s 24 in 2001 and Arrested Development in 2003. HBO was occasionally attracting audiences comparable to the broadcast networks, even though its subscriber base was only slightly more than onequarter of all the TV households in the United States. For instance, the most-popular programs on television in 2001–2 were NBC’s Friends, averaging 24.5 million viewers each week; CBS’s CSI, with 23.7 million; and NBC’s ER, with 22.1 million. For its part, The Sopranos attracted 14 million people per episode that season, which gave it an audience size equivalent to a top-10-to-15 show in the broadcast universe, not just the cable and satellite sector. 24 HBO was redeﬁning what was possible in terms of both quality innovations on the small screen and how much money could be made by pursuing alternative business models for TV. Unlike HBO, the traditional broadcast networks were still captives to their old economic formula of relying on “a single revenue stream based entirely on advertising.”25 After 1995, breakout programming was far more likely to originate in the cable and satellite sector of the industry. The ﬁght among so many TV services not only to survive but to distinguish themselves in such an increasingly competitive environment had resulted in an unprecedented proliferation of original programming, with HBO setting the standard as the most innovative and lucrative bright spot inside the Time Warner conglomerate. At the time, “HBO’s achievements had a dramatic impact on the entire media culture; creatively it put its rivals to shame,” proclaimed Peter Bart, editor of Variety, in 2002. This pay-television channel owed its success “to a potent mix: stable management; savvy blanket promotion of its shows; and a business model that relies on subscriptions rather than advertising.”26 Overall, “the traditional business model of television production [was] being rewritten,” and the network that initially set this whole transitional process into motion with its distinctive breakthrough programming during the mid- to late 1990s was HBO. 27 For the ﬁrst time in television history, the quality alternative was not CBS (as it was in the early 1970s), NBC (in the early to mid-1980s), ABC (in the late 1980s), or even PBS. “HBO is perhaps the greatest single producer of quality television drama and comedy in the English-speaking world,” admitted British TV critic David Herman in 2004. “American television is on a roll,” he continued, “[and] most of these programs, 12\n\nIntroduction\n\nespecially the most recent ones [The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, The Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood], have been made by one company, Home Box Ofﬁce.”28 Freed from direct ratings pressure, HBO invested its considerable cache of subscription dollars into hiring the best available talent, reaching deeply into the creative community. Its talent pool included writer-producers such as Tom Fontana (St. Elsewhere [NBC, 1982–88], Homicide: Life on the Street [NBC, 1993–99], and Oz), Darren Star (Beverly Hills 90210 [Fox, 1990–2000], Melrose Place [Fox, 1992–99], and Sex and the City), David Chase (Northern Exposure [CBS, 1990–95], I’ll Fly Away [NBC, 1991–3], and The Sopranos), Alan Ball (Cybill [CBS, 1995–98], American Beauty [1999], and Six Feet Under), and David Milch (Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue [ABC, 1993–2005], and Deadwood), to name just a few. HBO’s ability to attract the entertainment industry’s top creative people was unmatched by any other broadcast, cable, or pay-television network. For example, Seinfeld’s creator, Larry David, the producer and star of Curb Your Enthusiasm, “brought the project to HBO.” All told, “the network’s tendency to permit creative freedom made it a magnet for experienced producers, directors and writers looking for an outlet for projects to which they [were] deeply committed.”29 By the mid-2000s, HBO engendered a certain backlash from its competitors and some television critics for not being able to produce more breakout hits fast enough, but the aftereffects of the network’s shows were clearly evident in the programming and branding strategies of not only FX and Fox, but also Showtime (with Weeds [2005–], to mention just one), the USA Network (with Monk [2002–]), TNT (with The Closer [2005–]), and even ABC. When Marc Cherry created ABC’s Desperate Housewives (2004–), for instance, “he decided to ‘write an HBO show’— something like the ones [he] himself loved, maybe ‘a Sex and the City meets Six Feet Under.’”30 Desperate Housewives at its best was the kind of custom-tailored program that deﬁed easy categorization. Audiences at ﬁrst weren’t sure whether it was a darkly dramatic sitcom or a hip, ironic soap opera. From a business point of view, Desperate Housewives was more edgy and idiosyncratic than the standard-grade product that usually succeeded in the advertiser-supported environment of the broadcast sector. The series became an immediate buzz-worthy hit for 13\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\nABC during the fall of 2004, which both elevated the proﬁle of the network and prepared the general public for the program’s eventual release across a variety of subsequent platforms, including syndication, DVD, and the fast-growing on-demand window. “The mass digital conversion of the past ten years” placed consumers “at the very heart” of an increasingly personalized TV business environment. 31 According to a 2005 tracking study conducted by the Cable and Telecommunications Association for Marketing, “more than threequarters (77%)” still tuned into programs at “their scheduled date and time.”32 A growing segment (23 percent) of the national audience, however, was already time-shifting and place-shifting, watching programs when and where they wanted to, “liberated from the constraints of the old analog world.”33 The key to thinking about television in the digital era is to reenvision it in terms of screens (of all shapes and sizes) rather than merely households, which no longer offer a complete and accurate picture of TV penetration. At HBO, thirty minutes of originally scripted prime-time programming currently costs between $1 million and $2 million. HBO’s parent, Time Warner, therefore looks “to spread the cost of programming across as wide a footprint as possible.”34 “Repurposing”—referring to the process by which TV content is adapted across as many platforms as possible (including traditional TV sets, DVD players, the Internet, MP3Video players, stand-alone and portable digital video recorders [DVRs], and even mobile phones)—has emerged as the watchword of the television industry during the 2000s. The United States is on the threshold of being converted into an “on-demand nation,” where one-on-one distribution of TV programming via cable or the Internet provides yet another alternative to the advertiser-supported model. The new digital era of “on-demand entertainment” is signaling the beginning of “the end of TV” as most people knew it before 1995. 35 As the one-time sacrosanct business model of television splinters into multiple options beyond advertiser-supported programming—including subscription services (ranging from 24-hour networks such as HBO to on-the-go broadband content providers such as HBO Mobile and HBO Family Mobile), product placement, domestic and international syndication, DVD sales, and program downloads—breakout signature shows are the most essential ingredient enabling this newly emerging multidi14\n\nIntroduction\n\nmensional personal-usage market structure to ﬂourish. 36 Viewers are not going to pay to download mediocre, run-of-the-mill programs. Hit series such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under, however, help to brand networks such as HBO, generate word of mouth, and ultimately create multiple revenue streams. Broadcast, cable, satellite, and now online networks in the digital era are content providers ﬁrst and foremost, launching programs and thus priming the public to watch them in their initial runs. Afterwards, consumers pay directly for these shows as they migrate to other distribution windows within and outside the conglomerate. In fact, consolidation without content innovation has proved to be a limited business strategy in the digital era. A case in point is the 1999 Viacom-CBS marriage that ended in a kind of divorce on January 3, 2006, despite the fact that Sumner Redstone remains the executive chairman of both conglomerates. The promise of synergy between Viacom and CBS, with its supposed “cradle-to-grave one-stop shopping for advertisers,” was never fully realized. 37 Instead, a new Viacom was created to shelter the younger, higher-growth subsidiaries (such as the MTV network division including MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Spike TV, and VH1) and the movie studios (Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks), while the CBS Corporation maintained control over the older, slower-growing properties such as CBS-TV, UPN (now 50 percent of The CW), the Showtime Networks, CBS Radio, Simon & Schuster, and CBS Outdoor Advertising. 38 In a similar vein, the 1989 merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communication that created Time Warner, and the 2001 alliance between Time Warner and AOL, also experienced early growing pains, although both unions eventually held together (with Time Warner even dropping the “AOL” from its corporate title in early 2003, when the value of this Internet service provider plummeted $35 billion after the dot-com bubble burst during 2001–2). 39 The long-range hope for the AOL–Time Warner merger was to create “the Wal-Mart of the information age, a one-stop-shopping company,” including the highly proﬁtable boutique network HBO.40 CBS has adopted similar aspirations for Showtime since 2004. “As Showtime continues to add high-quality programs” (such as The L Word [2004–], Huff [2004–], Weeds, Sleeper Cell [2005–], and Brotherhood [2006–]), reasoned CBS president and CEO Leslie Moonves, “there is no reason it won’t become for CBS what HBO is for 15\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\n“We showed what was possible to do on television,” asserts former HBO chairman and CEO Chris Albrecht. “It’s good for everybody when the bar gets raised.”\n\nTime Warner.” 41 Showtime, FX, Fox, the USA Network, TNT, ABC, and other TV networks have subsequently upped the ante for HBO. “We showed what was possible to do on television,” asserted Chris Albrecht. “I think what that did was to bring more people into the category and to spend more money on original scripted programming. It’s good for everybody when the bar gets raised.”42 After more than three and a half decades, HBO has grown from being mainly a domestic movie channel to being an international cable and satellite network with a presence in more than seventy countries, as well as a full-service content provider known for its own distinctive brand of programming.43 HBO’s widespread inﬂuence on its fellow broadcast and cable networks is widely acknowledged. In a “now famous letter” written in the summer of 2001, for example, “NBC chairman Robert Wright challenged his colleagues to consider what they might learn from HBO’s extraordinary success.”44 In response, NBC produced Kingpin, a tepid clone of The Sopranos set within an international drug cartel à la Trafﬁc (2000), which lasted for just six episodes as a midseason replacement in February 2003. At about the\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nsame time, the real Sopranos was busy “recoup[ing] the entire production costs” of its ﬁrst three seasons “from DVD sales alone.” So too was Sex and the City. 45 By 2004, HBO had earned another $350 million from the domestic sale of Sex and the City during its ﬁrst syndication cycle to TBS and local broadcast stations.46 In early 2006, HBO collected an additional “$190 million or a record $2.5 million an episode for The Sopranos” from A&E.47 Next up was an exclusive arrangement with Bravo for Six Feet Under, which prompted FX to test the waters by leasing The Shield to Spike TV. HBO was again leading other cable and satellite channels into an area of the television business once dominated exclusively by the major broadcast networks along with a few select ﬁrst-run syndicators. From an industrial perspective, therefore, HBO is like a cat living out its nine lives, nimbly landing on its feet time and again in an atmosphere of unparalleled change. HBO still features ﬁrst-run Hollywood movies and sporting events. Moreover, it originates some of its own programming; ﬁnances, coproduces, and telecasts many other independently created series and one-time shows; and syndicates most of this work worldwide as well as distributing much of it on DVD, while making its entire catalogue available day and night to its on-demand subscribers. In addition, HBO has distinguished itself over four widely different programming areas—drama, comedy, sports, and documentary. It has signiﬁcantly altered the ongoing relationship between programming executives and creative staff, with executives such as Carolyn Strause (of HBO Entertainment), Colin Callender (of HBO Films), and Sheila Nevins carefully nurturing and supporting creative personnel to a degree that is unusual in the industry. Most importantly, HBO has been a change agent for nearly four decades, by jump-starting the cable era with its satellite service and by pioneering an alternative economic model for the television business. Similarly, it has been on the forefront of technological innovation since the mid-1970s, beginning with satellite distribution and eventually adding a wide assortment of digital TV advances, including multiplexing in the mid-1990s and on-demand reception in the early 2000s. Finally, the network suddenly emerged as television’s gold standard for its breakout series and specials during the late 1990s and early 2000s, generating an HBO aftereffect that remains\n\n17\n\nGary R. Edgerton\n\nreadily apparent in the signature programming choices on many other cable and broadcast networks. Above all, HBO has parlayed its position among, between, and inside the various mass media to develop into the prototypical entertainment corporation of the twenty-ﬁrst century.\n\nNotes 1.

Is it the fact that they are signed by Duchamp (recognized ﬁrst and foremost as an artist) and not by a wine merchant or a plumber? —Pierre Bourdieu The work of art is an object which exists as such only by virtue of the (collective) belief which knows and acknowledges it as a work of art. —Pierre Bourdieu The Sopranos sustains its hyper-realism with an eye and ear so perfectly attuned to geographic details and cultural and social nuances that it just may be the greatest work of American popular culture of the last quarter century. —Stephen Holden, The New York Times\n\nIt’s Not TV When did it become permissible to view a drama series produced for American television and think of it as a work of art? We’re used to thinking of television programs as seductive attractions designed to coax viewers into the grasp of advertisers. With the rise of academic television and cultural studies, we’ve learned that television programs can be interpreted as cultural symptoms, expressions of profound, if often obscure, social meanings. We’ve seen television programs serve as the fetish object of worshipful fans, the illicit thrill of guilty-pleasure seekers, and the target of irony-wielding wiseacres. We have even watched television and felt the glow of nostalgia for lazy childhood afternoons sprawled before the TV set. There are many ways to ﬁnd 23\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nIn 1999, the New York Times hailed The Sopranos as possibly “the greatest work of American popular culture of the last quarter century.” (Left to right) Joe Pantoliano as Ralph Cifaretto, Steve Van Zandt as Silvio Dante, James Gandolﬁni as Tony Soprano, and Tony Sirico as Paulie “Walnuts” Gaultiere.\n\nvalue in a television program, and still more to feel indifferent or appalled, but at some point in the past decade, cultural critics, including those in the employ of the venerable New York Times, have grown comfortable with the notion that a television series may be judged, ﬁrst and foremost, as a work of art.1 In some respects, we have HBO to thank for this turn of events. Since the premiere of The Sopranos in 1999, HBO has invited viewers to approach American television series with a peculiar sensibility—a mode of experience that sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has labeled an “aesthetic disposition.”2 In the case of HBO dramas, the aesthetic disposition brings to television the cultivated expectation that watching certain television series requires and rewards the temperament, knowledge, and protocols normally considered appropriate for encounters with museumworthy works of art. HBO signals this shift in expectations with the 24\n\nDrama Overview\n\nslogan, “It’s Not TV, It’s HBO.” As one business reporter has noted, “this single statement contains a critique of the entire system of American commercial television.”3 Against the profane ﬂow of everyday television, in which the run-of-the-mill runs with the metronomic precision of commercial necessity, HBO stands alone. Safely quarantined from the distractions and interruptions of commercial television, the viewers of HBO dramas are permitted to detach themselves from typical modes of television viewing, to approach the state of disinterested contemplation idealized in Kantian aesthetics, a disposition instantly adopted by patrons in a museum gallery or a symphony concert hall, but one seldom achieved in the family room. For those who have acquired the cultural competence needed to adopt an aesthetic disposition, it is possible to look differently upon a television series: to perceive the artistic vision of an individual creator where once one may have seen stories with no discernible author; to reﬂect on the meaning of form even as one feels drawn into the pleasure of a gradually unfolding narrative; to recognize the threads of cultural and historical references woven into the fabric of a story; to appreciate the subtle subversion of genre conventions and audience expectations; and, most importantly, to celebrate the transcendence of the artwork over everyday experience and more mundane forms of popular culture. Television series have provoked many responses over the years, but only recently have they invited cultural consecration as works of art. In the past, critics have claimed artistic merit on behalf of individual television series that appeared to transcend the constraints of the medium or to make a dramatic leap forward in the development of a particular genre. At irregular intervals since at least the 1970s, one critic or another has asserted that television drama series demonstrate the narrative complexity and subtle delineation of character normally associated with the novel (in fact, this has become a tiresome critical cliché). But among intellectuals there hasn’t been a consensus that television series ought to be treated as legitimate works of art, or that it would be appropriate—except as camp—to adopt an aesthetic disposition toward commercial television. Critic Gilbert Seldes brought a fully developed aesthetic sensibility to the criticism of popular broadcast series beginning as early as the radio era, but fellow intellectuals saw bread and circuses where Seldes 25\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nsaw an emergent art form; he was largely without peer and, ultimately, without followers.4 With the television landscape engraved as a vast wasteland on maps of American culture by the early 1960s, the ability to conceive of a television series as a work of art was beyond the realm of permissible thought until the 1970s, when the press began to notice iconoclastic new producers, such as Norman Lear and Larry Gelbart, and a generation of lapsed literary scholars somehow avoided the more characteristic move into ﬁlm criticism and began to apply their critical acumen to television. Horace Newcomb published the groundbreaking TV: The Most Popular Art in 1974, and a small but steady stream of enthusiasts—professional scholars and critics in the popular press—followed in the 1980s, making artistic claims for Hill Street Blues (NBC, 1981–87), St. Elsewhere (NBC, 1982–88), Miami Vice (NBC, 1984–89), thirtysomething (ABC, 1987–91), Cagney & Lacey (CBS, 1982–88), or Magnum, P.I. (CBS, 1980–88), or any number of individual dramas. 5 Still, one should not overestimate their cultural inﬂuence; commercial television, when not an object of derision, was at best a guilty pleasure for intellectuals. Even the short-lived phenomenon of Twin Peaks, which attracted otherwise TV-phobic intellectuals to the television set when it debuted in 1990, failed to elevate the status of the medium in the eyes of any but those already converted. For much of the medium’s history, television was simply not an “artworld,” in the sense that Pierre Bourdieu has used the term to describe a “restricted” ﬁeld of cultural production in which independent participants share a set of collective beliefs and practices necessary for recognizing certain objects as works of art. Bourdieu begins his discussion of the artworld with a paradox familiar to the philosophy of art: “the question of what enables one to distinguish between works of art and simple, ordinary things.” The answer, he asserts, will be found not in the characteristics of the artifact, but in the social ﬁeld that creates and sustains a belief in the exalted value of the artwork. “The art object,” he explains, “is an artifact whose foundation can only be found in an artworld, that is, in a social universe that confers upon it the status of a candidate for aesthetic appreciation.”6 Of course, it is not possible to believe that certain artifacts are legitimate works of art unless one also believes that others are illegitimate and should be excluded from consideration. In identifying this differ26\n\nDrama Overview\n\nence—by selecting legitimate candidates for aesthetic appreciation and ignoring or dismissing the illegitimate—artists and intellectuals mark the boundaries between “high” and “low” culture and participate in ongoing “struggles for the monopoly of artistic legitimacy” within a society.7 Bourdieu claims that cultural institutions, such as museums, galleries, and awards, supported by networks of critics, scholars, and other independent cultural intermediaries, provide the validation that transﬁgures artifacts, converting them into works of art. The routine practices of the artworld serve as acts of cultural consecration that create and sustain a belief in the distinctive value of art. 8 For much of its history, television has lacked these institutions, this network of critics and independent cultural intermediaries who have sufﬁcient cultural authority and independence from the television industry to claim convincingly that commercial television series are candidates for aesthetic appreciation. Television awards, for instance, tend not to bestow cultural prestige that is recognized beyond the industry. The Emmy Awards have never transcended their origins as a selfcongratulatory exercise in industry public relations. The Peabody Awards, although independent of the broadcasting industry, are largely unknown outside the business and tend to be noticed only when someone in the industry appropriates their reputation to burnish the public image of a program or a network in a short-lived public relations campaign. Museums devoted to radio and television may resemble art museums, but they have not fostered an aesthetic disposition toward television. As Bourdieu writes, “[art] museums could bear the inscription: Entry for art lovers only. But there is clearly no need for such a sign, it all goes without saying. . . . The artistic ﬁeld, by its very functioning, creates the aesthetic disposition without which it could not function.”9 Unlike art museums, which serve as quasi-sacred sites of reverence and contemplation for works of art, museums devoted to radio and television are more like P. T. Barnum’s dime museum in the nineteenth century. Filled with strange and wondrous artifacts from the lost continent of history, they amaze and amuse, but rarely leave a patron with a particular reverence for the art of television. At best, the public perceives the television programs on display as historical documents rather than artworks. In this setting, programs offer a glimpse into the strange popular tastes of earlier generations or bear witness to past events. For a variety of reasons, 27\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\ncultural institutions that exist to recognize and promote artistic achievement in television have not produced the collective belief required to transform an ordinary television program into a work of art. The aesthetic disposition toward American television—the collective belief that television series deserve to be perceived as legitimate works of art—is a phenomenon that has come into focus gradually over the past decade, almost in spite of the established institutions that one might expect to be responsible for promoting television as an art form. Instead, several technological, industrial, and social changes have combined to alter the experience of a television series, making possible contemplative modes of viewing and fanatical attention to detail that contribute to the growing belief that television series are worthy of aesthetic appreciation. As evidence, one might point to the technological enhancement of the viewing experience offered by high-deﬁnition TV sets and digital sound, the emergence of do-it-yourself archives made possible by the digital video recorder and the sale of DVD box sets, and new means of social communication permitted by the Internet and wireless technologies, which lead to new formations of knowledge and pleasure centered on television series. Consider the heightened awareness of television’s creative process now that viewers have grown accustomed to authorial commentary on DVDs and the various podcasts and video weblogs that studios have made available on the Internet. Viewers of the television series Battlestar Galactica (2003–) don’t even have to wait for the DVD to hear authorial commentary; they now have the ability to download podcasts with commentary by writers and producers to accompany each new episode aired by the Sci Fi Channel. Of course, it isn’t as though these changes have transformed the entire medium of television, giving every program a claim to artistic legitimacy. The rise of the HBO drama as an object of critical esteem coincides almost perfectly with the emergence on American television of its guilty-pleasure antithesis, the reality-based series. Survivor (CBS, 2000–), after all, debuted little more than a year after The Sopranos, and its success in the ratings, along with that of American Idol (Fox, 2002–) and other unscripted series, has made reality formats the decade’s major program innovation. While HBO viewers were measuring The Sopranos for a pedestal in the pantheon of modern culture, millions of Americans (including more than a few Sopranos fans) 28\n\nDrama Overview\n\nwatched contentedly while contestants on NBC’s Fear Factor (2001–6) munched insect larvae in a competition whose stakes and outcome have been lost to the passage of time. Such are the dialectics of television in the new century. The ability to think of one television series as a work of art exists alongside a belief that others are nothing more than noisy diversions clattering along the conveyor belt of commercial culture. Since the rise of cable TV, American television has become organized around such extreme disparities in emerging hierarchies of taste. HBO hasn’t caused these changes in the landscape of American television, but it has responded by cultivating an aura of aesthetic distinction and by positioning itself at the top of these hierarchies. Such decisions make sense given the business model of a subscription cable network, which must continually prove its value to subscribers.\n\nAn Aristocracy of Culture Popular wisdom would have us believe that there is no accounting for taste. In fact, HBO’s strategies for acquiring and securing the loyalty of viewers reveal a precise accounting: it is known in the cable television business as “churn,” and it is measured by the number of subscribers who disconnect from a premium service like HBO as they calculate whether its program offerings warrant the cost of each month’s subscription payment. As current HBO chairman and CEO Chris Albrecht has said, “the products that the broadcast networks sell are the ones that appear on the commercials in between the shows. The product that we sell is HBO the network. You can’t buy a piece of it. You have to buy it all.”10 HBO does not report the rate of churn among its customers, but industry analysts estimate that each year 50–60 percent of HBO subscribers cancel their subscriptions with the cable operators or satellite systems that provide access to the network.11 Some move from homes or apartments and later re-subscribe; others simply decide that the service is not worth the cost of subscription—particularly those who take advantage of promotional deals that invite consumers to subscribe initially at a discount rate. The cost of holding onto subscribers is a daunting expense in the HBO business model, trailing only the cost of programming. In the late 1990s, analysts estimated that HBO spent more than $200 million a year (10 percent of its annual revenue) in 29\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nmarketing and promotions aimed largely at winning back ﬁckle former subscribers—and these costs have only grown in the current decade, as the competition for viewers has intensiﬁed.12 Broadcasters have always designed their programming services with an eye toward earning and rewarding viewer loyalty (the better to deliver predictable audiences to advertisers), but the direct subscription model leaves premium cable networks like HBO particularly vulnerable to the least manageable element in the economy of cultural production: the mercurial tastes of audiences. The promiscuity of the viewer in the multichannel, multiscreen video universe poses a challenge for any program service that must prove itself worthy of a subscription payment each and every month. In order to ensure HBO’s continuing economic value for subscribers, the network must establish a unique cultural value among television networks. This process has occurred in two stages that essentially trace the history of HBO’s evolving programming strategies. The ﬁrst stage, which lasted until the mid-1990s, involved creating a consistent and identiﬁable HBO brand, a luxury brand in a populist medium. In this stage, HBO programming began with feature ﬁlms and special events, before branching out to made-for-TV movies. Once the HBO brand had been established, the second stage involved building a deeper and more durable relationship between subscribers and the brand. In this stage, HBO turned increasingly to the production of original series that had the potential to engender loyalty among viewers by insinuating the network into their weekly viewing habits. This pattern in the history of the HBO brand—the shift from the brand as a corporate trademark to the brand as an integral experience in the lives of consumers—follows the larger patterns in the marketing of consumer goods. For HBO, as for Nike or Starbucks or any of the leaders in the marketing innovations of recent decades (including such proﬁtable cable networks as MTV, Nickelodeon, and ESPN), the object is to build an ongoing relationship with particular groups of consumers, so that the brand conveys meanings that circulate through the culture independently of the company’s products and serve as a key resource in the consumer’s repertoire for creating a social identity.13 HBO has changed its programming strategies and redeﬁned its brand in response to changing conditions that have affected all media compa30\n\nDrama Overview\n\nnies. As a cable network, however, HBO is positioned to pursue innovations in a way that the broadcast networks are not. The broadcast networks are obligated by government regulations and by contractual relations with afﬁliate stations and advertisers to deliver an extensive program service that accumulates groups of viewers from across a range of social and demographic categories. Faced with changes in society or in media technologies, broadcasters typically ﬁght a rearguard battle to protect their existing business model, which uses programming to deliver large numbers of consumers to advertisers. HBO has never used this model. HBO’s parent company, initially Time Inc. and currently Time Warner, operates one of the largest distribution companies in the cable TV industry. As a result of these origins in the cable business, HBO’s remarkably durable team of executives (in particular, successive CEOs Jeff Bewkes and Chris Albrecht) have tended to look for new opportunities in the social and technological changes that broadcasters face with apprehension. First, HBO distinguished itself from commercial television by identifying itself as a source of commercial-free, uncut feature ﬁlms and special events. This programming strategy gave the network a clear brand identity, which survived until the widespread adoption of the VCR in the mid-1980s, when HBO lost its claim to being the preeminent choice for watching feature ﬁlms at home. Michael Fuchs, who was HBO’s CEO at the time, has said, “if there had been a debate at HBO about how much we had to spend on original programming, that debate ended with the VCR.”14 The next major step in the evolution of the HBO brand involved the decision to produce original programming, beginning with feature ﬁlms. Fuchs carved out a niche for HBO as a source for the sorts of topical ﬁlms about social and political issues that had nearly disappeared from movie screens and commercial television. After establishing its ﬁlm unit, HBO branched out again with occasional long-form dramas and miniseries that would never have appeared in theaters or on any network except HBO—including And the Band Played On (1993), an adaptation of Randy Shilts’s panoramic narrative of the early years of the AIDS epidemic, and The Corner (2000), an adaptation of a book by David Simon and Ed Burns that tells the stories of people whose lives are otherwise ignored in the media, those who live in one devastatingly poor African American neighborhood in Baltimore. 31\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nDuring this period, HBO earned awards and critical praise, building its reputation for quality. But these original productions did very little to redeﬁne the relationship between HBO and its subscribers, who thought of HBO as a luxury brand, a network to watch occasionally. In 1995, Jeff Bewkes succeeded Michael Fuchs as president and CEO of HBO and introduced a different conception of branding, one more in line with changes taking place throughout the marketing world. Bewkes’s goal was to create a more intense relationship between HBO subscribers and the HBO brand by producing original series. He increased the budget for original programming from $50 million per year to more than $300 million and promoted Chris Albrecht to the position of president of original programming.15 After years in which HBO’s brand identity represented a distinct alternative to the commercial networks, Bewkes and Albrecht made a major concession to the commercial model when they chose to add episodic series available weekly. Beginning with radio, the commercial networks recognized that the key to cultivating loyalty among viewers depended upon a ﬁxed, reliable schedule: the goal was to integrate network programming into the temporal rhythms of modern social life, particularly those of a “typical” American family. This meant scheduling programs in accordance with the rhythms of the modern workweek and, on an even more intimate level, with the temporal ﬂow of everyday life in a family—hence the development of weekly and daily series that favored familiarity over novelty. HBO, on the other hand, began its existence as a monthly service; the subscription fee was due when each month’s cable bill arrived in the mail, carrying with it a brochure laying out HBO’s schedule for the month ahead and highlighting the new movies to be introduced. The monthly program schedule serves the administrative schedule of corporate billing cycles, but as a means of organizing time it coincides with few other social activities. With its movies scattered throughout the month, HBO’s schedule bore no meaningful relationship to the experience of time in the lives of most Americans. Chris Albrecht, who eventually succeeded Jeff Bewkes as president and CEO, has explained the decision to develop ongoing series in terms that recognize how different scheduling practices affect a network’s relationship with viewers:\n\n32\n\nDrama Overview Under Michael Fuchs we looked at ourselves as a monthly subscription service. We didn’t really believe that we could compete on a weekly basis in the series area, which is the programming currency of the broadcast networks. We knew that we had to become more valuable, so we made a conscious effort to explore the series area. Then we said, “Look, we need to anchor these things because it’s too hard to ﬁnd them.” So we transformed ourselves into a regular-use network, a habitual-use network, rather than an occasional-use network . . . that was a huge transformation but one that was necessary.16\n\nAlbrecht also has described this decision as a response to the changing media landscape of the mid-1990s, in which cable systems began to offer more channels, and potential viewers also explored the temptations of video games and the Internet. “With so many choices,” he explained, HBO could not “afford to be an occasional-use medium. We need people on a regular basis. . . . Series bring stability and regularity to HBO’s schedule.”17 Having witnessed Albrecht’s thoughtful discussion of HBO’s programming strategies, it comes as a surprise to read the many interviews in which he then claims not to know who actually subscribes to HBO or whether the original series have been successful in attracting and retaining subscribers. When asked to characterize the HBO audience, Albrecht pleads ignorance: “We have a very broad subscriber base that is slightly more upscale than a broadcast network audience. But without knowing exactly who our subscribers are—and we don’t, because we’re not exactly provided that information by the cable companies—it’s very hard for us to actually make a statement one way or another.”18 In discussing the apparent success of HBO’s breakthrough series, Sex and the City (1998–2004) and The Sopranos, Albrecht claims to be unable to link the programming with an obvious increase in the number of subscribers: “Did people get HBO just to watch The Sopranos? The answer is probably not, but we’ll never know.”19 In another interview he seems entirely to discount the shift in programming. “HBO grew at the same rate before those shows were on the air as it did after those shows were on the air,” he has said. 20 In this age of intense market research, when media executives run focus groups on any decision more important than today’s lunch order,\n\n33\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nit’s difﬁcult to believe that HBO—the most proﬁtable company in the Time Warner empire—would risk its billion dollar annual proﬁts without knowing everything it is possible for contemporary market researchers to know about current and potential subscribers. One may suspect a bit of self-mythologizing in Albrecht’s denial: like showmen of an earlier era, he often seems to suggest, HBO executives make decisions based on innate taste and gut instincts, not on market research, nor on ratings. 21 It is also possible that after many bruising contract negotiations with performers and producers, Albrecht may not want to sacriﬁce bargaining leverage by giving any individual series too much of the credit for HBO’s undeniable ﬁnancial success. Even if an observer can only make inferences about HBO’s audience based upon its program choices and public relations campaigns, it isn’t difﬁcult to conceive of HBO as an exclusive cultural domain, appealing to a restricted taste culture and to viewers of privileged economic circumstances. For all its faults, commercial broadcasting is a truly populist medium; for the price of a television set and the willingness to tolerate commercials, programs are available to anyone within range of the signal. Premium cable networks offer a form of television for the age of the gated community, in which a homeowner’s association and restrictive covenants provide an exclusive experience but also enforce particular standards of taste. By producing original programming, HBO has transformed itself from a movie channel that simply exhibited Hollywood features into a cultural phenomenon, one designed almost perfectly to solicit the attention and affections of an educated upper-middle class. In a series of clever promotional spots, HBO has depicted its drama series as “watercooler” TV—the sort of programs that people feel compelled to discuss with coworkers the following day. It is a knowing, ironic image of television as a collective cultural phenomenon, a joke for those who understand how much television has changed in the age of audience segmentation—when every taste is a minority taste. The Sopranos and Six Feet Under (2001–5) certainly have been the topic of conversation around the watercoolers of suburban ofﬁce parks, downtown law ﬁrms, and university English departments, but it’s fair to wonder about the mufﬂer shop and the lumberyard. Of one fact we can be certain: even at the height of its cultural impact and critical acclaim, HBO has never surpassed 29 million subscribers in 34\n\nDrama Overview\n\na country with nearly 110 million TV households. 22 This in spite of the fact that the HBO service is nearly universally distributed on cable and direct broadcast satellite systems—in other words, available to anyone who already pays a monthly subscription fee for a program service. Think about it in slightly different terms: While HBO has racked up every award in sight, and while Tony Soprano’s family and the women of Sex and the City have appeared on magazine covers across the land, more than two-thirds of the TV households in the United States have resisted the temptation to subscribe. Once HBO executives chose to compete directly with the commercial networks by introducing original series, they had erased one of the key points of distinction that separated HBO from its commercial competitors. The answer was to translate the reputation for quality earned by its award-winning movies into the realm of series television, while making this distinction salient for the upper-middle-class viewers who were its most likely subscribers. HBO has earned its reputation for quality in part by lavishing more money on the production of its drama series than any of the broadcast networks can possibly afford, given their business models. These extraordinary investments are meaningless, however, unless viewers recognize and value the signs of quality in HBO series. With this in mind, HBO also spends more on marketing and promotions than any other network. The budget for each episode of Deadwood (2004–) has been roughly $4.5 million, twice the average of even the most expensive network series. The ﬁrst season of the period drama Rome (2005–7) cost even more—nearly $100 million for ten episodes. The annual budget for marketing and promotions is also generally twice what the broadcast networks spend.23 At the same time that HBO has created the programs, its public relations department has promoted a television culture in which it is possible to think of a television series as a work of art. This is a crucial step in the creation of HBO’s distinctive cultural value. The publicists at HBO deserve every Time Warner stock option that plumps their investment portfolios (with apologies for the disappointing performance of shares since the disastrous AOL merger). The HBO publicity machine, led by Eric Kessler, has created the impression that HBO’s original programming—in spite of its relatively small audience—has played a disproportionately major role in American culture 35\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nThe heart of the lavish HBO-BBC coproduction Rome is the on-again offagain relationship between the friendly, slower-witted Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson, left) and the stoic, honorable Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd, right).\n\nover the past decade. “We treat the launch of every single piece of programming like an event,” Kessler has explained. “We believe in investing in the marketing to generate the awareness. We know we need to be part of the popular culture.”24 To achieve this impact, they cite an Everest of Emmy Awards and the occasional Peabody, the adoration of critics, steady audience growth, staggering proﬁts, and the unmistakable inﬂuence of HBO series on the programming decisions of their oftbewildered competitors in basic cable and the broadcast networks. More importantly, HBO promotes the creators of the drama series and encourages reporters to ﬂesh out their biographies so that the public learns to identify the artistic vision of a single creator behind each series, no matter the scale and complexity of the production or the number of people involved in bringing it to the screen. David Chase has been a writer and producer in the television business for decades, but it is only with The Sopranos that we have grown accustomed to reading state-\n\n36\n\nDrama Overview\n\nments such as this from a writer on the series who is quoted in a cover article in Vanity Fair: “Every shot, every word, of The Sopranos is David in some way or another.”25 For all that anyone outside the television industry knows, David Chase might not have existed before he arrived at HBO. Although his name has appeared in television credits countless times since the 1970s, he toiled in lucrative anonymity. Now he is acclaimed as an artist capable of placing his signature on every shot of a television series. Pierre Bourdieu is certainly not alone in making the claim that the “charismatic ideology” of authorship—the belief in the artistic vision of a sole creator—“is the ultimate basis of belief in the value of a work of art.”26 In its avid promotion of those who have created its drama series, HBO has enhanced the value of its brand while also contributing to a more widespread discourse of authorship in television. In doing so, the network has played a part in making it possible to believe that a television series can be thought of as a work of art. In Bourdieu’s account of cultural production, the value of an artwork is created through a process of “social alchemy,” a term that accurately describes the miraculous elevation of David Chase to the status of creative genius following decades of anonymous labor in the television industry. Bourdieu describes a production of collective belief that one may behold in the marketing of any cultural good, but it is particularly evident in the case of HBO, which distinguishes its brand by cultivating an aura of artistic achievement: “It is both true and untrue to say that the commercial value of a work of art is incommensurate with its cost of production. It is true if one only takes account of the manufacture of the material object; it is not true if one is referring to the production of the work of art as a sacred, consecrated object, the product of a vast operation of social alchemy jointly conducted, with equal conviction and very unequal proﬁts, by all the agents involved in the ﬁeld of production.”27 In this passage, Bourdieu shifts attention from the artist to the independent cultural intermediaries who may not proﬁt directly from the work of art, but who are nevertheless eager to participate in its consecration: “the producers of the meaning and value of the work— critics, publishers, gallery directors and the whole set of agents whose combined efforts produce consumers capable of knowing and recognizing the work of art as such.”28\n\n37\n\nChristopher Anderson\n\nIn the case of HBO drama, one sees an ideal example of this process of social alchemy at work. The public relations juggernaut at HBO has masterfully pulled the strings of a credulous press to stoke the ﬁres for each successive series, but this isn’t a case of brainwashing. Each of the agents involved in producing the value of the work has an independent interest in contributing to an artworld that allows for the belief that certain television series are candidates for aesthetic appreciation. Newspapers and magazines are eager to upgrade coverage of pop culture, and television in particular, in their desperation to engage a dwindling audience of young readers. Of course, HBO beneﬁts from the corporate synergies provided by its sibling publications at Time Warner, including the weekly magazines Time and Entertainment Weekly, but it isn’t just corporate logrolling that accounts for the attention lavished on HBO dramas. Pursuing the same demographic group as those who subscribe to premium cable, the New York Times alone has devoted so many column inches to The Sopranos that it sometimes reads like a virtual house organ for HBO.29 In the echo chamber of cultural production, HBO then feeds the press coverage of its programs back through the public relations machinery, so that people begin to speak about the positive press coverage. “We also did something that changed the way a lot of people looked at an aspect of television, which is what the TV critics say,” Albrecht has explained. “We took the praise and used that as a way to draw attention to the shows, to show the pedigree of the shows, to help deﬁne the shows—and later on, when people started to talk about the network, to help deﬁne the network.”30 As with HBO’s promotion of authorship, its active promotion of TV criticism has helped to elevate the status of television criticism in general. By drawing attention to the aesthetic claims of TV critics, HBO has contributed a measure of legitimacy and cultural authority to those who would speak about television series as works of art. Coincidentally, this helps to make critics more effective agents in the production of cultural value. As the present volume attests, academic critics have ﬁled into line, playing a small part in the most solemn rite of contemporary television culture—the cultural consecration of HBO. Our interests are a bit more obscure than those of writers in the popular press, but, collectively, we contribute to the value of the HBO brand by producing consumers capable of recognizing the HBO series as a work of art. 38\n\nDrama Overview\n\nNotes The epigraphs to this section are drawn from Pierre Bourdieu, The Field of Cultural Production (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 258, 35; and Stephen Holden, “Sympathetic Brutes in a Pop Master-piece,” New York Times, June 6, 1999, sec. 2, 23. 1. Through the entire history of American television, there has been an oddly dialectical relationship between modern art and commercial television. In part, this has involved questions about the aesthetic status of commercial television, particularly in negotiating the boundaries of taste along the line that divides high and low culture. For insight into the history of this relationship, see Lynn Spigel, “High Culture in Low Places: Television and Modern Art, 1950– 1970,” in her book Welcome to the Dreamhouse: Popular Media and Postwar Suburbs (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2001), 265–309. See also Lynn Spigel, TV By Design: Modern Art and the Rise of Network Television (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, forthcoming). For the purposes of this essay, I am speaking speciﬁcally about the aesthetic status of the ﬁctional television series, and not of individual programs or commercials, nor of television conceived as a more general cultural phenomenon. 2.

Or to put it another way, HBO Films is a rebuff to Walter Benjamin’s argument that ﬁlm technology can offer no more than a cheap imitation of the singular and unique presence of the work of art.1 By exhibiting a restless fascination with the meaning of “originality,” HBO has strategically distanced its ﬁlms from the formulaic excesses of made-for-TV movies and Hollywood’s obsession with box ofﬁce receipts. The result is that HBO has redeﬁned originality in ﬁlmmaking: rather than signaling the original quality of discrete objects, HBO takes originality as a freestanding quality in and of itself. And although part of this redeﬁnition is merely the effect of HBO’s promotional branding, there is clearly more at play in the company’s success story than creative marketing tactics. HBO began making feature ﬁlms in 1983 when it presented The Terry Fox Story, the ﬁrst made-for-pay-TV movie. The ﬁlm was based on the “true” experiences of the legendary Canadian whose bout with bone cancer at the age of seventeen left him with one leg, and whose determination to run coast-to-coast across Canada to raise money for medical research led to the annual international charity run in his name. In choosing to lead with a biopic, HBO Pictures anticipated the central role this subgenre would come to occupy in its evolution. But at the same time, director Ralph L. Thomas demonstrated certain iconoclastic tendencies that placed the picture at odds with the typical pieties of made-for-TV biographical ﬁlms. The Terry Fox Story did not embrace its subject with calculated reverence; it was widely noted (not least of all 42\n\nFilms\n\nby members of the Fox family) for its portrayal of Fox as an ambiguous hero with a difﬁcult personality and ﬁery temper. Yet the ﬁlm remains to this day a revealing register of HBO’s early ambitions and emerging sense of itself as a maverick ﬁlmmaking force. Even from the beginning, HBO sought to break with the conventions of made-for-TV biopics that had been established as early as 1971 with the immensely popular sentimental melodrama Brian’s Song. This sense was conﬁrmed in 1986 when HBO began making ﬁlms under a second banner, HBO Showcase, the explicit goal of which was to push the “boundaries of contemporary drama.”2 This venture earned HBO its ﬁrst prime-time Emmy Awards for Age Old Friends (1989), starring Hume Cronyn and Vincent Gardenia as elderly nursing home residents who help each other maintain humor and dignity in the face of their declining physical and mental capacities. Ten years later, HBO Showcase expanded and was ren"
