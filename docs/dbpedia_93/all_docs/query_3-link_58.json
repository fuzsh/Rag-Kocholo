This series made J.J. Abrams a household name. It's character driven like Battlestar and tells a big story that spans the entire series like Babylon 5. Very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\nMy take on other shows you listed:\\n\\n**Fringe** - Very similar to the X-Files. Done by J.J. Abrams of lost and Star Trek fame. If you liked the X-Files you'll probably like Fringe.\\n\\n**Eureka** - A must watch for me. It's more like spending an hour with old friends. Very comfortable cast that works well together. A town of geniuses live and invent here. You can probably guess the results.\\n\\n**B5 Crusade** - Not unless you really need a B5 fix. The crew look for a cure to the plague that was released on Earth at the and of B5.\\n\\n**Warehouse 13** - Not great but enjoyable. Each week two agents have to find and neutralize artifacts with amazing powers. Their base of operations is a seemingly endless warehouse with thousands of these artifacts. \\n\\n**Stargate Atlantis** - Follows the original Stargate series format. Doesn't do it as well, the cast isn't as good and the stories seem weaker, but watchable if you're in to Stargate.\\n\\n**Dark Angel** - Mediocre stories that don't really take off until the last half of the second season. Right before it got canceled. \\n\\n**Reaper** - Only saw two episodes. More comedy than scifi. Reminds me of Chuck in a way.\\n\\n**Sliders** - Quite good for the first two years. Fell off a cliff when the SyFy channel took over.\\n\\n**Stargate Universe** - So far I'm underwhelmed. The stories and most of the characters are weak. But it does have a ton of potential and the actors are quite good. They just need decent scripts to work with.\\n\\nOther shows you might enjoy:\\n\\n**Jeremiah** - Done by the same guy who created Babylon 5. And just as enjoyable. Tell what happens to the survivors after a plague wipes out most of the adults.\\n\\n**Heroes** - Several separate but interwoven stories being told here. Quality varies from season to season. One is the best for most people. Two is probably the weakest. I liked the first half of three for the complexity but most people hated it for that reason. \\n\\n**Andromeda** - The first two seasons are done by the lead writer from Deep Space 9. Well told and very engrossing. Seasons 3-5 are Hercules in space. Literally. The stories wander and never do entirely make sense. Seasons 3-5 are from the same people that made Mutant X and Earth Final Conflict. \\n\\n**John Doe** - One of my favorites. A man wakes up with no memory of who he is but knows every fact of everything else. Not personal details but encyclopedic stuff like the volume of water in crystal lake. He has no idea how he got this way. And neither do we since it got canceled too early. \\n\\n**Supernatural** - A lot like Buffy but more adult. Basically two guys go around killing paranormal baddies. There's a deeper story covering the whole series but I don't want to give too much away.\\n\\n**Carnivale** - I cannot recommend this series enough. It's a crime it was canceled. Tells the story of a generational conflict between light and darkness. \\n\\n**The Outer Limits** - Anthology series. Gets panned for not being original but I quite enjoyed it. \\n\\n**The Masters of Horror** - Not scifi but decent if you're into horror. Another anthology series. \\n\\n**Charlie Jade** - Way overlooked. Canadian series made by a South African production company. Unique premise, engaging characters and realistic. Humans from another dimension are trying to set up a permanent wormhole to ours so they can steal water and dump toxic waste.

The camel had been domesticated millennia before Christ's birth, but Persian VIPs didn't need to ride those nasty, vicious, stinky, ungainly animals; the Persians' pride was their horses (this is before the Jihad and before anyone called them *Arabian* horses.) And [the trip from Persepolis to Bethlehem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi) is just over 1,000 miles as the crow flies, at least a three-month journey on foot; our three (why 3?) Parsi priests aren't going to travel that distance alone, or across a trackless waste; they'd hire a caravan, and travel the established trade routes of the Silk Road, through the Hellenized, settled routes leading through Mesopotamia and Syria, to the cities of Roman Judaea.\\n\\nJews have never been shy about practicing and discussing their distinctive faith, and it was during the Babylonian/Persian captivity that the fierce, exclusive monotheism of later Judaism emerged as the defining characteristic of Jewish religion(s). And a significant Jewish population never left Babylon when Nehemiah, Ezra and the rest returned to Jerusalem. After the Persians conquered Babylon, Judaism began absorbing ideas from the mindset of the [Parsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsi_people), and I'd be surprised if Jewish rabbis didn't interact with Parsi priests and philosophers as they did with Hellenic and Asian ones elsewhere. If nothing else, both Kosher and Aryan purity laws are both quite strict, so during and long after the 70-year exile in Babylon, food merchants, house builders, and animal vendors would all be learning how to sell to the Jewish demographic. And the Jews' monotheism, in contrast to the Parsis' dualism would make for interesting debates.\\n\\nAnd Messianic expectation was growing in the centuries nearer the time of Christ -- especially among Jewish communities like Qumran, with strong Persian religious influence. Meanwhile the Parsis were developing their own belief in a coming savior, [Saoshyant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saoshyant), who would be born of a virgin. If the Magi learned -- through divination, astrology, divine revelation, whatever -- that the Savior was about to be born in the far west, they might well have assumed the Jews in Judaea -- who also expected a Savior -- would know where He'd been born.\\n\\nSo picture a significant caravan with guards, carters, merchants and fellow-travelers accompanying a delegation of Parsi priests along the west end of the Silk Road, finally arriving in (Caesarea?) at the court of the Edomite King Herod, whom the Romans had made King of the Jews.\\n\\nHere's a good survey about the [Biblical Magi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi).\", \"score\": 5 } ]\n\nIs there really grandeur in this view of life? I could use some help, fellow atheist redditors!\n\nThis is my first /r/atheist post, but I've long been a fan of the community. Keep up the interesting articles/videos/everything! Basically, I just wanted to ask everyone here for their own, personal response to what I've been thinking about recently. I'm constantly reading about how liberated people feel after discovering/living with atheism and anti-theism. I commonly hear how happy they are with their lives now that they can enjoy it for what it is: a brief glimpse into this incredible universe of ours, and a chance to understand it. Another common theme is that they don't fear death, or at least they don't view it with the dread that many others do. Atheists seem apt to being totally happy with the rational, humanistic view of life. Here is where my quandary comes in. I've been an atheist my entire life (possibly slightly less so when I was a young child). I was lucky enough to grow up in a family household that never even considered the idea of pushing a religion on me, not even slightly nudging me towards one. For this, I am incredibly thankful; it is a gift that all too many children don't receive when growing up. I've recently been thinking a lot about how I feel with regards to my life, my death, and many other profound things of that nature, and the truth is this: *I'm not sure I enjoy the atheist life*. Maybe I just need to put things in a different perspective to see the greatness of it, but I sometimes find myself wishing that I could be gullible enough to believe that my pastor/rabbi/whatever has it all worked out. I don't have the ability to do that, because I know it's all rubbish, but I have issues too! I'm incredibly, terribly scared of death, and if I think about it too long, I get sick and have to make myself think about something else. Could you fellow atheists elaborate on how you deal with these kind of thoughts? I am told by Richard Dawkins (although he admittedly took it from someone else) that \"there is grandeur in this view of life\". I think I just need some help finding it for myself. Thanks for any comments! **UPDATE:** I'm enjoying all the thoughts and comments, everyone! I'd love to hear more, if others feel like chiming in about their experiences, but I just wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate all the advice.

I'm posting it purely as food for thought. As you might expect, Chomsky isn't sympathetic. Questions are in plain text, Chomsky's answers in bold. ----- Hello Mr. Chomsky. I’m assuming you know who Ron Paul is. And I’m also assuming you have a general idea about his positions. Here my summary of Mr. Paul’s positions: - He values property rights, and contracts between people (defended by law enforcement and courts). **Under all circumstances? Suppose someone facing starvation accepts a contract with General Electric that requires him to work 12 hours a day locked into a factory with no health-safety regulations, no security, no benefits, etc. And the person accepts it because the alternative is that his children will starve. Fortunately, that form of savagery was overcome by democratic politics long ago. Should all of those victories for poor and working people be dismantled, as we enter into a period of private tyranny (with contracts defended by law enforcement)? Not my cup of tea.** - He wants to take away the unfair advantage corporations have (via the dismantling of big government) **“Dismantling of big government” sounds like a nice phrase. What does it mean? Does it mean that corporations go out of existence, because there will no longer be any guarantee of limited liability? Does it mean that all health, safety, workers rights, etc., go out the window because they were instituted by public pressures implemented through government, the only component of the governing system that is at least to some extent accountable to the public (corporations are unaccountable, apart from generally weak regulatory apparatus)? Does it mean that the economy should collapse, because basic R&amp;D is typically publicly funded — like what we’re now using, computers and the internet? Should we eliminate roads, schools, public transportation, environmental regulation,….? Does it mean that we should be ruled by private tyrannies with no accountability to the general public, while all democratic forms are tossed out the window? Quite a few questions arise.** - He defends workers right to organize (so long as owners have the right to argue against it). **Rights that are enforced by state police power, as you’ve already mentioned.** **There are huge differences between workers and owners. Owners can fire and intimidate workers, not conversely. just for starters. Putting them on a par is effectively supporting the rule of owners over workers, with the support of state power — itself largely under owner control, given concentration of resources.** - He proposes staying out of the foreign affairs of other nations (unless his home is directly attacked, and must respond to defend it). **He is proposing a form of ultranationalism, in which we are concerned solely with our preserving our own wealth and extraordinary advantages, getting out of the UN, rejecting any international prosecution of US criminals (for aggressive war, for example), etc. Apart from being next to meaningless, the idea is morally unacceptable, in my view.** I really can’t find differences between your positions and his. **There’s a lot more. Take Social Security. If he means what he says literally, then widows, orphans, the disabled who didn’t themselves pay into Social Security should not benefit (or of course those awful illegal aliens). His claims about SS being “broken” are just false. He also wants to dismantle it, by undermining the social bonds on which it is based — the real meaning of offering younger workers other options, instead of having them pay for those who are retired, on the basis of a communal decision based on the principle that we should have concern for others in need. He wants people to be able to run around freely with assault rifles, on the basis of a distorted reading of the Second Amendment (and while we’re at it, why not abolish the whole raft of constitutional provisions and amendments, since they were all enacted in ways he opposes?).** So I have these questions: 1) Can you please tell me the differences between your schools of “Libertarianism”? **There are a few similarities here and there, but his form of libertarianism would be a nightmare, in my opinion — on the dubious assumption that it could even survive for more than a brief period without imploding.** 2) Can you please tell me what role “private property” and “ownership” have in your school of “Libertarianism”? **That would have to be worked out by free communities, and of course it is impossible to respond to what I would prefer in abstraction from circumstances, which make a great deal of difference, obviously.** 3) Would you support Ron Paul, if he was the Republican presidential candidate…and Hilary Clinton was his Democratic opponent? **No.**\n\n10\n\n[ { \"body\": \"A pretty good reply to Chomsky's comments can be found [here.](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig8/preston5.html)\", \"score\": 6 }, { \"body\": \"&gt;Under all circumstances?

What school of thought have I become a part of? **The idea:** There is no objective right and wrong, only what a person subjectively comes to think of as wrong. For each person, their notion of wrong originates when they experience a failure that they experience as breaking their connection to others. Feeling badly about losing the connection, the person decides they don't want it to happen again, and to that end pick some shortcoming to blame for the failure, and henceforth consider wrong the presence of that shortcoming in themselves and others. Thus the fear of loss of connection to others becomes the foundation for making aspects of human behavior unacceptable and \"wrong\" and later serves to justify the logic of whatever ethical system they make up or choose to believe. Extrapolating backwards: All aspects of humanity are present in every person, and whenever a person thinks they dislike another human, it is actually the reinforcing of their decision to never accept some aspect of themselves (in order to prevent the loss of connection to others).\n\n10\n\n[ { \"body\": \"Right and wrong are based on objectives.

I know it's a long-shot, but any advice or theories would be greatly appreciated. And I'm more than happy to answer any questions. About 5 days ago, I started having difficulty breathing, which has continued up until the present. I frequently have to take deep breaths, often resorting to yawning to get enough air. I feel like I can't quite get enough oxygen. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. I feel a dull pain in my chest and diaphragm area when I take a deep breath. When in a seated position or when my head is elevated (ex. propped up on a couple pillows), it is much more difficult to breathe. When lying flat or standing up, it's not as bad. Any physical activity (a walk to the store, for example) worsens my condition. As far as I can tell, the only other symptom is general sleepiness. I've been napping a lot over the past few days. Does anyone have any thoughts on what could be wrong with me? If it helps, I'm a large guy - 6'1, 280 lbs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: So I went to the ER last night. They monitored my heart, took some blood, did some x-rays - nothing. The doc couldn't find any physical cause for my breathing troubles. My blood pressure is fairly high, but that's an ongoing issue, and I'm unsure if it has any connection to my respiratory problem (the doctor didn't seem to think there was any correlation). Today, the problem is still there, but it's not as bad. I'm thinking that those of you who suggested some sort of physical trauma to my body has caused this. Maybe a bruising of my ribs or diaphragm?

Especially now, with so many different genres and so many different people having more specified tastes, how (if it wasn't for the drugs) so many people would get together and who would those performers be to enjoy the music in harmony if one was to be held now? I know 32 acts might be a lot, but even a few bands would do?

This isn't a \"romantic relationship\" post, but dealing more with people I come in contact with on a regular basis. I have a few friends who have extremely low self-esteem. They will call themselves ugly and fat and untalented and tear themselves down. As their good friend, it really hurt me to see them do this to themselves. I know them all separately, but it's similar situation with them all. They are rather good-looking in my opinion (and extremely talented in the case of one of my friends), but for some reason lack confidence in themselves. There are times when I'll have to console them, and no matter how many times I assure them that they're pretty and handsome and talented enough, they just won't hear it. No matter how many times I say it. It's come to the point that I just don't know what to say anymore. They come to me crying about how horrible they feel about themselves and it honestly breaks my heart. I really wish I knew how to handle the situation to make it better for them. So here I am asking for your advice, Reddit. What can I do to help my friends gain confidence in themselves? I know there's nothing I can do to make it all better for them and that most of it has to do with them sorting things out on their own, but is there anything I can do to be a good friend when they're down in the dumps about themselves?\n\n5\n\n[ { \"body\": \"People with low self-esteem will seek validation from others. When they seek it from you, you can reassure them countless times of their worth, and this might make them feel better in the short-term, but it will rarely change them. Until they can learn how to reach the cognitive steps towards validating themselves, their behavior will generally remain the same.\\n\\nThat said, you can help them by exposing the irrationality in their reasoning or by giving them constructive advice. Once you get out of the pattern of reassuring them, they might get out of the pattern of seeking validation. For example:\\n\\nThey say: \\\"I'm so stupid.\\\"\\n\\nReassuring answer: \\\"No, you're smart!\\\"\\n\\nBetter answer: \\\"Why would you say that? Didn't you get an A- on your last exam?\\\"\\n\\nThey say: \\\"Yeah, but my friend got an A+!\\\"\\n\\nReassuring answer: \\\"I'm sure you're just as smart as he is.\\\"\\n\\nBetter answer: \\\"You guys should study together for the next exam.\\\"\", \"score\": 18 } ]\n\nCirclejerk's take on the phenomenon sweeping reddit, the Karma Party.

[Pic Included]\n\nhttp://imgur.com/UODCp For those who find the drawing a little confusing; Here's the best I can do in words. The object A falls into the event horizion and sees the universe speeding up towards infinity. However, before infinite time has passed a black hole has to evaporate and the universe must have seen the object evaporate (in some form) before it hit the event horizon. But, I'm told you can see an object cross the event horizon. How is this resolved in physical theory? From my limited understanding, this should mean a black hole is a dense thin walled sphere and the matter can only escape through hawking radiation. Edit: How is the fact that the object from the outside doesn't look like it crosses the event horizon but evaporates at some point reconciled? Edit2: Check out chkno's response, as it resolved my problem exactly.
