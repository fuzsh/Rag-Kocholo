He seemed a bit stung that Brubaker killed the character and how he did it in the intro piece for Thunderbolts: From the Vault. But all the while wearing a smile and trying not to outright say he hated it.\n\nAFFebruary 24, 2016 1:36 PM\n\nSilver Surfer annual #5\n\nNow we're entering the period where Nebula goes from being one of the most interesting and readable female villains into being a crazed bald cyborg.\n\nAnd they chose the latter for the movie.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 24, 2016 1:23 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nCount me as another reader who enjoyed Fabian Nicieza's writing on Nomad, New Warriors, the Adventures of Captain America miniseries, Thunderbolts, and X-Force beginning in the second year once Rob Liefeld was gone. Nicieza was, in my opinion, one of the best writers at Marvel in the 1990s\n\nThe only book where I really did not like Nicieza's work was X-Men, and I really do believe that is down to Bob Harras' very heavy editing and his numerous edicts, things that in those pre-Facebook, pre-social media days most of us readers were unaware of.\n\nGiven a much freer hand, Nicieza did good work. His two year run on Nomad is among my all time favorite writing of his. If you've ever read an interview with Nicieza or met him in person, when he speaks of his work on the character of Jack Monroe, it's pretty obvious that it was something of a labor of love on his part. Nicieza clearly put a lot into this series.\n\nMark BlackFebruary 24, 2016 12:15 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nI like Nicieza's stuff on Nomad and New Warriors and he wasn't terrible when he was on the x-books. While he isn't brilliant, his stuff is solid and he did do a good job of finding voices for characters that heretofore were a little one-note - i.e. Nova, Nomad, Speedball, even Marvel Boy. None of these characters became top-tier characters necessarily, but I would definitely say that Nicieza brought them (and Firestar) to the forefront (with varying results - most of them good.\n\nBUFebruary 24, 2016 11:25 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nI suspect that around the offices he was considered very good for how fast he must have been, considering how much he wrote, and reliable. -He appears to have been a go-to guy when writers abruptly left, too.\n\nAFFebruary 24, 2016 11:11 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nAre you baffled by the concept that you're not the only reader? Plenty of people (myself included) like Nicieza.\n\nAnd two ongoing X-Books, New Warriors, Nomad and occasional fill-ins or spin-off miniseries are the bulk of the company's output?\n\nBobFebruary 24, 2016 10:59 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nFabian Nicieza, writes a million books, and none of them well.\n\nIt still baffles me how such a lackluster creator ended up in control of the bulk of the company's output for the better part of the decade.\n\nBUFebruary 24, 2016 10:47 AM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nI go all the way back to the Longshot miniseries, and Mojo's finest moment was on the cartoon (\"I'm making money just thinking about it!\") It was the only time I ever found him funny -I never found him even faintly scary- and you could just tell they had an indecent amount of fun making that episode...\n\nLuke BlanchardFebruary 24, 2016 9:37 AM\n\nFantastic Four #28\n\nIn the panel from the climactic fight the android is much larger than it should be. Ben seems not tall enough to reach its waist.\n\nAustin GortonFebruary 24, 2016 9:03 AM\n\nX-Factor annual #7\n\nAs Michael says, the most frustrating part about this issue is that it's the (abrupt) end to this whole Arize/Mojoworld rebellion plot. The X-FORCE annual jumps ahead in time, and while it kinda fills in what happens after that, we never actually see it or get much in the way of direct information, which is just...bizarre. And unsatisfying.\n\nI'm not sure what's worse - this story, which doesn't have any crossover amongst its characters, to its detriment, or \"Kings of the Pain\" the previous year, which added new characters every chapter until, by the end, there was like forty different characters hanging around with nothing to do.\n\nAtaru320February 24, 2016 8:47 AM\n\nFantastic Four #15\n\nI think the opening splash page of the Thinker here really defines him, more or less emulating the statue without any real idea regarding who he will eventually become later. Though I do think Stan goes a little crazy calling Andy \"neither animal, vegetable or mineral\"...but that's just flourishments.\n\nLuis DantasFebruary 24, 2016 8:44 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nIn hindsight it feels just odd. They seemed maniac, desperate, and relying a whole lot more on marketing over contents than any sane person would advise.\n\nfnord12February 24, 2016 8:31 AM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nBen, you're right. I've added that credit. Thanks. I guess that means he's responsible for that panel that i think is very old school Kirby-esque.\n\nfnord12February 24, 2016 8:29 AM\n\nX-Force annual #1\n\nInterestingly, though, Arize and Spiral aren't actually in the \"flashback\". It's only said that he \"sought to combine\" the X-Men and Longshot. so maybe the implication is that they are behind the scenes, having somehow arranged for Longshot and the X-Men to come together again? I've added a scan.\n\nfnord12February 24, 2016 8:13 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nThanks AF.\n\nWhat's interesting is that so far i haven't noticed any indication in the actual issues that they are meant to be part of a line or seen any mention of the \"Big Guns\" brand (i.e. not on the covers, or in the bullpen pages or lettercols). And as Cullen notes, the inclusion of Death's Head II is especially odd. The mini-series, at least, actually included a number of promotional pages advertising the UK sub-universe as opposed to the Big Guns. I do see that DHII wasn't included on the poster, so maybe they weren't too committed to him being a part of it (although Terror wasn't included either).\n\n(I think the depiction of the Punisher is a nod to the bulky JRJR version.)\n\n@Morgan, the question is more why Nomad as opposed to any number of other characters, like ones that have had books in the past (e.g. Ka-Zar) or popular characters that had never been tried out in solo books (e.g. Storm). But to your point, there were just a ton of new books being added at this time, and if FabNic was advocating for it, and if the mini-series did reasonably well, then i guess Marvel was willing to go with it. And as Cecil notes, the book did have its appeal.\n\nCecil DisharoonFebruary 24, 2016 6:22 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nMy wife found this quite memorable, as she has always adored babies. Sensitive tough guy/ eye candy plus baby seems clearly to be an appeal to female readers, or indeed anyone who might enjoy such things. She read every Nomad issue we had! The disposal of Baby May and, at the time, MJ, put an end to her ongoing readership of superhero comics. At least we still had Promethea and the Vertigo line.\n\nAFFebruary 24, 2016 4:03 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nAlso was there a Punisher arc in 1992 where he piled on the pounds like that cover suggests?\n\nAFFebruary 24, 2016 4:01 AM\n\nNomad #1\n\nMarvel Quarterly Report 1992 (on the flipside of the poster)\n\nhttp://images.tcj.com/2012/10/marvelqtr1-650x969.jpg\n\nTuomasFebruary 24, 2016 1:58 AM\n\nX-Factor annual #7\n\nI haven't read these issues, but couldn't Nicieza simply have intended him to be the son of Longshot and Rita?\n\nD09February 24, 2016 1:46 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nAbout Maddie, she looks a lot like Jean, she lives in the Arctic like the Summers family, and she has a job flying planes like Corsair did. One coincidence is more than enough, three gives you the impression that something's rotten in Denmark.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 23, 2016 11:32 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nIt's been a long time since I've looked at this annual, but I recall that Jim Lee was credited as providing \"layouts\" for the entire book. They were probably very loose breakdowns, since there doesn't seem to be much of his style on display, other than some of the poses and the positioning of characters in certain action sequences.\n\nMichaelFebruary 23, 2016 11:31 PM\n\nX-Force annual #1\n\nThe scene can't be a reference to \"our\" reality's version of X-Men 10-11, since Arize and Spiral weren't present for the fight.\n\nCecil DisharoonFebruary 23, 2016 10:01 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nThe depiction of the X-Men's arrival in Afghanistan could only be Adam Hughes, a guy who loves a good facial expression (and a knack for pretty, well-drawn women), as seen in Justice League.\n\nWolvie and Psylocke's attack sequence screams \"TEX\"!\n\nI think it's credible to say P. Craig Russell's art appears first.\n\nfnord12February 23, 2016 9:19 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nAF, what are the scans from? Marvel Age?\n\nMorgan WickFebruary 23, 2016 9:16 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nWasn't this in Marvel's \"flood the market\" stage, too?\n\nfnord12February 23, 2016 9:14 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nFixed it. Thanks. (I do prefer that you raise this sort of thing in the forum, but i recognize the ambiguity.)\n\nMorgan WickFebruary 23, 2016 9:02 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nSome of the scans seem to appear an image later than the text would indicate, namely from \"Gambit is an X-Man 'more by default than desire'\" (which, for example, seems to refer to the image that follows \"here come the rest of the X-Men\", which in turn makes more sense referring to the image after that) through Cyclops preventing the team from going to the Mojoverse. Yeah, yeah, I should probably post this on the forum, but this happens sometimes and it's never quite clear how intentional it is; I only bring it up here because it's fairly blatant and extended.\n\ncullenFebruary 23, 2016 8:46 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nWeird they included Death's Head II in that promo, considering the completely one-sided way the UK titles interacted with the US Marvel-verse. I don't think any were ever included in line-wide, let alone company-wide, crossovers.\n\nMichaelFebruary 23, 2016 8:45 PM\n\nX-Factor annual #7\n\nThe non-resolution of the story was just frustrating. Spiral and Arize return to Mojoworld but we never find out what happened to them. They're not even mentioned in X-Men 10-11. And most annoyingly, the dialogue implies that \"our\" Rita has not been turned into Spiral yet by Arize but that Spiral and Arize are going to rescue her. So what happened to \"our\" Rita?\n\nFabian Nicieza claimed that he didn't want Shatterstar to be the son of Longshot and Dazzler but the dialogue in this issue implies that he's the son of a human and a native of Longshot's dimension.\n\nAFFebruary 23, 2016 8:36 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nMore on Big Guns:\n\nhttp://40.media.tumblr.com/ffbb9d48d458cd9d5312728a3bf6a933/tumblr_n8elrwIXGY1r3esopo3_1280.jpg\n\nhttp://40.media.tumblr.com/97fccdda251f72a41fb0483ca4d1d062/tumblr_n8elrwIXGY1r3esopo4_1280.jpg\n\nAFFebruary 23, 2016 8:33 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nClose, Joe, it was Big Guns: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5d/d4/6b/5dd46bfa69ffe9261e1855cc26ffdbec.jpg\n\nMichaelFebruary 23, 2016 8:20 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nJeff, this wasn't the \"official\" beginning of Fabian's run- this story was done before the Image crew left. (And Fabian didn't script either X-Man title at this point- that was Lobdell. He did do the Muir Island Saga though.)\n\nFabian's next X-Men story after this is is X-Men 12-13. According to Fabian, that was only a fill-in and he just agreed to do the X-Cutioner's Song X-Men issues for the crossover,so he didn't \"really\" become the writer until issue 17, which is why we don't see his voice until then.\n\nPiotr WFebruary 23, 2016 7:07 PM\n\nX-Factor annual #7\n\nMan, I do love Spiral. She's such a tragic - while crazy - character...\n\nPiotr WFebruary 23, 2016 7:06 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nHey, some cool art in some of the scans!\n\nBTW. It's interesting that you say you only like Mojo as a satirical character. I prefer him as a horror character - some of his stories are quite dark and creepy...\n\ndavid banesFebruary 23, 2016 4:52 PM\n\nFantastic Four #15\n\nI think I like the Mad Thinker looking more normalish here before growing his hair out to look a little 'madder.' That's actually what I really liked about him looking so normal and boring: all his powers really of his mind.\n\nI could see someone using him like DC's Suicide Squad, like the animated version where the Clock King was the planner/mission control.\n\nKind of looks like an evil and smarter Ben Grimm now that I think about it.\n\nJeffFebruary 23, 2016 4:45 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\nInteresting that Fabian's run as writer on this title officially begins in an annual (after scripting a few issues in both X-Men titles here and there the last few months). Not just an annual -- but a pretty disposable one at that. Also, of note, Fabian's first two \"real\" X-Men stories are crossovers -- this and \"X-Cutioner's Song.\"\n\nSad thing is, we really don't see his X-Men \"voice\" until issue 17 because of the crossovers. As a kid I preferred what Lobdell and David were doing on \"Uncanny\" and \"X-Factor\" at this time ... but re-reading it, during the issues Fabian is uninterrupted by crossovers, there is some decent stuff.\n\nNot here though. This story is garbage. But wait for it.\n\nJoeFebruary 23, 2016 4:03 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nI remember this was launched as part of the Heavy Hitters line, which I believe included Silver Sable's book and Punisher War Zone (and likely some more).\n\nWhatever happened to S. Clarke Hawbaker? I really liked his art, but he only did 3.5 issues of Nomad and not much else to my knowledge.\n\ngfsdf gfbdFebruary 23, 2016 3:47 PM\n\nX-Men annual #1\n\n\"He's a 'spineless' television executive\"\n\n...\n\noooooooooooooh. Thanks Fnord\n\nclydeFebruary 23, 2016 3:36 PM\n\nFantastic Four #28\n\n\"Reed continues to claim that the Thinker's Awesome Android was actually created by him, but that's really stretching it.\" Well, if anyone were to \"stretch\" the truth, it would be Mr. Fantastic. ;)\n\nfnord12February 23, 2016 2:24 PM\n\nWerewolf By Night #3-5\n\nThat scan is from issue #5, with Ploog inking himself.\n\nMax_SpiderFebruary 23, 2016 2:23 PM\n\nNFL Superpro #8\n\n\" I'm sure Jarvis was not instructed to wave the guy through if he ever did show up for that workout.\"\n\nJarvis never lets ANYONE in! I can't count the number of times I've seen Jarvis turn someone away from Avengers Mansion or hang up the phone on some poor guy asking for help. It doesn't matter if you're a superhero or not, Spider-Man's fallen victim to this before. I'm pretty sure I remember him slamming the door on Gravity in the Sanctum Sanctorum once of all places.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Jarvis has tried to stop the Avengers getting in their own base before.\n\nRobertFebruary 23, 2016 2:21 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nMark, that's where they're headed in the next few years where the different \"families\" of books all have their own thing going on. Not coincidentally it's also right around the time Marvel completely goes to shit. I don't think Nomad (title, not character) survives to see it though.\n\nJeffFebruary 23, 2016 2:19 PM\n\nWerewolf By Night #3-5\n\nI will say the art and layout of that Judson page (\"here doggie doggie\") is pretty cool. Is tha Ploog inking himself or is that Chiaramonte?\n\nAtaru320February 23, 2016 1:31 PM\n\nX-Force annual #1\n\nIts weird that there's a back-up about Artie, Leech and Whiz Kid in this book of all places. I doubt Liefeld's fans would have wanted to see some quirkier characters from before their time sad to say.\n\nMark BlackFebruary 23, 2016 1:29 PM\n\nNomad #1\n\nfnord, you make a good point about how Nomad ended up with his own regular series. I wonder if this didn't come as a suggestion from marketing (maybe Michael or Mark Drummond might have more insight) with the idea that groups of titles or families of titles are a lot easier to sell, market, and have crossovers than individual series.\n\nIt's shortly after this time that Midnight Sons was introduced, the X family of books was doing quite well, the Avengers had their niche, Spider-man as well, and then possibly this was a way to give street level heroes like Moon Knight, Punisher, and Daredevil their own family or bloc of titles. The Dead Man's Hand crossover will take place in a few issues time and that crossover, while not including Moon Knight, deals with a lot of Moon Knight concepts like the Secret Empire.\n\nMarvel seemed to be driven by marketing at this time and while I'm not any sort of strategist, it does seem like it's easier to sell blocs of titles that tie in to each other rather than individual isolated adventures.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 23, 2016 1:25 PM\n\nNFL Superpro #8\n\nIssue #8 was the second issue of NLF Superpro that I got. I also bought a copy of issue #1 because, um, well, sometimes I don't have the best judgment when it comes to comic books. What can I say? It was the 1990s.\n\nAnyway, even though the first issue was a dud, I got this one when it came out because at the time I was a huge fan of Captain America, so I wanted this for Cap and Crossbones. This was actually Crossbones' first ever appearance outside of the pages of Cap's title. Yeah, I know, not exactly an auspicious way to branch out into the wider Marvel universe.\n\nStill, it was entertaining enough, since Crossbones basically spends the entire story beating up and mocking Superpro.\n\nHerb Trimpe actually drew a pretty sinister version of Crossbones. Some of his other art for this issue, though, was really odd. That spokesman at the anti-drug press conference has a ridiculously long & narrow head. And I can unfortunately never un-see the sight of Cap sucking poison out of Superpro's leg.\n\nYea, that's the great thing about comics, the total break from reality.\n\nJC, I'm sure that if this series had somehow managed to continue longer, eventually there would have been a story revolving around the NFL's earnest efforts to combat instances of domestic violence and sexual assault among their players, and soon after that another story about the League's passionate mission to significantly reduce brain injuries on the field.\n\nJeffFebruary 23, 2016 9:51 AM\n\nMarvel Spotlight #2\n\nIt's sheer coincidence that I read this entry yesterday... because today there is an interview with the scripter of this issue, Gerry Conway, talking about how this was one of his favorite books and he is revisiting the Darkhold in the new, ongoing \"Carnage\" series he's writing. I had to come back this morning and share that -- http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/conway-explains-supernatural-carnage-twist-becoming-more-than-a-serial-killer\n\nAtaru320February 23, 2016 8:24 AM\n\nUncanny X-Men #3\n\nYeah, it was Loeb but somehow whenever I think of the Ultimate Universe I tend to only think of Bendis these days. Sorry.\n\nCecilFebruary 22, 2016 11:51 PM\n\nUncanny X-Men #3\n\nCannibal Blob was written Loeb; I just double checked it---from Ultimatum.\n\nI don't see much difference between Sue Storm and Jeanie's faces in these stories- very geometrically regular, standard ideas of \"beauty.\" I think red hair just tickles a certain spot for the bashful MU fans of that generation. My girl and I just split a bottle of red dye, so count me in, too.\n\nMichaelFebruary 22, 2016 11:19 PM\n\nUncanny X-Men #3\n\nAtaru, are you referring to his canibalism? I thought that was Loeb's idea.\n\nMichaelFebruary 22, 2016 8:36 PM\n\nNFL Superpro #8\n\nWhat is Crossbones supposed to be doing in those last two panels? It looks like he's telekinetically throwing debris at Phil?\n\nRobert February 22, 2016 6:14 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\n@david banes, that was John Byrne's unpublished ending for his \"The Last Galactus Story \" in Epic Illustrated.\n\ndavid banesFebruary 22, 2016 5:50 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\nMy own head-cannon is what I heard another writer suggest somewhere in the comments: Galactus' body will eventually explode and create the next universe.\n\nTCPFebruary 22, 2016 3:36 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\nI look at the big \"G\" symbol as more of a symbol of infinity, reflecting the cycle of life, death, and renewal. That would fit well with Galactus' cosmic nature and his role in the universe at large.\n\nAtaru320February 22, 2016 1:02 PM\n\nUncanny X-Men #3\n\nI like how simple and effective a design the Blob here in his first appearance: he's just a big guy who happens to be immoveable. And considering how Xavier's troop acted like jerks, its no wonder he fell into villainy. (and later growing a cylinder head and zillions of teeth thanks to Liefeld...and later still his infamous incident in the Ultimate line courtesy of Bendis) Its sad where you can be treated like a hero despite looking like a monster, but not when you just look like some overweight guy in this period.\n\nJeffFebruary 22, 2016 12:14 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nThis was the second X-Men comic I bought in real time after a few years of buying only \"X-Men Classic\" (for the record, \"Uncanny\" 287 and 288 were the first and third ones I bought) and I always thought that 288 footnote was bungled as well, fnord.\n\nWe're now into the period of X-Men I have pretty much memorized, from here until the launch of \"X-Treme X-Men,\" so I look forward to weighing in on these :D\n\nOne thing about at least the X-Men's chronology at this point we're now in a stretch of several years where \"Uncanny\" is released the first week of the month and \"X-Men\" is released the third. A lot of people take this to mean the chronology weaves in-and-out of both books every other issue, but that's not really the case. Despite the three (editorially mandated) crossovers we're about to encounter, the two books do have long stretches of 6-8 issues at a time of existing independently from each other, even when sharing and trading characters. The two really don't officially become an \"every other issue\" deal until Alan Davis' run ... after which Claremont separates them again.\n\nclydeFebruary 22, 2016 11:17 AM\n\nNFL Superpro #8\n\n\"I think it's kind of funny that the selling point of this issue, at least by the cover, is a team-up with Captain America\"\n\nJust to play Devil's Advocate, all it says on the cover is \"Guest Starring\". That only implies an appearance by Cap, not any kind of real Team-Up. Although, the poison sucking is certainly a meaningful interaction for Superpro.\n\nJCFebruary 22, 2016 10:24 AM\n\nNFL Superpro #8\n\nNFL anti-drug campaign\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nYea, that's the great thing about comics, the total break from reality.\n\nMichaelFebruary 22, 2016 7:52 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\n@ChrisW- Maybe I didn't explain what happened clearly enough. Harras wanted the wedding to happen and used the wedding in the Animated Series to get DeFalco to agree:\n\nhttp://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2014/05/23/comic-book-legends-revealed-472/2/\n\nfnord12February 22, 2016 7:40 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #3\n\nI agree this issue (and therefore ASM #7) needed to be moved after TOS #48. Thanks Bill (do you want to be Uncanny Bill or Spectacular Bill?).\n\nAndrewFebruary 22, 2016 7:06 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nThis thread has gone pretty far afield, but my two cents is I always felt that Scott with the girl who looked like his dead girlfriend was creepy, Alfred-Hitcock-type territory. It was never going to end well. And, Chris, I highly recommend both Morrison's New X-Men and Whedon's Astonishing X-Men. In context, Scott's relationship with Emma makes a lot of sense; a repressed guy like him needs a girl who's a little crazy to balance him out.\n\nChrisWFebruary 22, 2016 3:44 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nRobert, I'm less concerned about editorial interference in the marriages than the fact that none of them worked for more than a few years. These are three of the most classic couples in comics. Reed and Sue are the only ones in their league, and they were engaged from the start and married by their creators. [I do have a fondness for Ralph and Sue Dibny, but they are DC characters and I understand their marriage... didn't end well.]\n\nYou probably know more than I do about all of these characters currently. Scott got his happy ending with Madelyne, and marrying Jean is (dare I say it?) just a failed attempt at cloning the process. It's not the editorial fiat I'm complaining about (specifically) and certainly not in Scott and Jean's case. Getting them married, yes, as Michael said above, the company and the cartoon people are to blame for that. Fine. And I have no problem with Scott and Jean being together finally after all their trials and tribulations, and Scott's first wife can be easily forgotten.\n\nBut becoming a bumbling idiot because Betsy looks at him? Going on to cheat on Jean with Emma Frost [which I know only by reputation, I've never read the actual comics]? This is not the Cyclops that we've known for so long. It's like he's been replaced by an alien energy space form.\n\nPeter/MJ and Clark/Lois are fine as far as they go, I was just using them as examples in my shock about learning that Scott and Jean married because the cartoon show wanted it. All three couples, it's not a bad idea. If they were real people, I'd wish them well, and *tsk tsk* when it doesn't work out. Such is life.\n\nRobert, based on your comment, I'm pretty sure you know much more than I do how all of those marriages worked issue-to-issue. I'm not disagreeing with you about any of that. In fact, I don't think I'm disagreeing with you in general.\n\nBut Scott Summers is mentally (if not physically) cheating on his wife with one of the X-Men's greatest enemies, who wears an S&M outfit. That's not a happy marriage. Scott and Jean could spend the next fifty years together, that will still be a problem they haven't dealt with.\n\nI'm not complaining about how the marriages began or ended. Fictional characters owned by vast corporations, they'll marry whoever they're told to marry. But three of the greatest couples in comics get married because of those vast corporation, with no regard for what it does to them as characters? That offends me. Britney Spears had a better reason to get married. She was drunk in Vegas. End of story.\n\n[There actually is a good self-published comic where a Superman rip-off married a Wonder Woman rip-off after a drunken weekend in Vegas, and the story is about their respective supporting casts (and the Justice League rip-off) dealing with it. And Terry Moore had his main characters in \"Strangers In Paradise\" doing exactly the same thing. Maybe it was just in the air at the time.]\n\nRobertFebruary 22, 2016 2:38 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nOh wait, none of the above marriages had any lasting quality. Never mind.\n\nChrisW, I think I understand how you meant that but I do want to respond because it struck a nerve (mainly due to my irritation with how at least a couple of those marriages were ended). I always find these discussions are tricky to get into because all it takes is one side pointing out what one or two shitty writers did as \"evidence\" that something isn't working, but here I go nonetheless. I think the Peter/MJ marriage worked up until the point that the Spider titles in general stopped working and then it became a convenient scapegoat for many. The Clark/Lois marriage sure-as-hell worked until the company higher-ups decided to muck with them for reasons that had jack to do with quality or fans clamoring for it to end. Both of these relationships began and ended due to sales gimmicks and publicity stunts. But I would argue that both were natural progessions of their romances and, in the Clark & Lois case, they were long overdue for some progression on a formula that had grown stale decades before. As for Jean/Scott, they're the couple I'm least interested in of the three but there was history to back up the idea and, correct me if I'm wrong, they are the only one to not have their marriage dissolved by editorial bullshit. I am assuming on that because my knowledge of post-Heroes Reborn Marvel is spotty. There are other entries here I know that go into more detail on the Peter/MJ debate and this is probably not the place for the DC debate, so I'll leave it at me chiming in with my two cents unless you ask a question or something that requires additional comment.\n\nChrisWFebruary 22, 2016 2:05 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nReally? There is something wrong when comic book characters get married because other mediums demand it. Stan Lee wanted Peter and MJ to marry for the newspaper strip. The producers of \"Lois and Clark\" wanted Superman to get married, a couple of years after Superman died. And now Scott and Jean get married to match up with the cartoon series?\n\n#*@&$^(!!!! Britney f*cking Spears had a better reason to get married than that. She was getting plastered with some guy in Las Vegas, that's all the excuse they need. Producers of similar work in a different medium wanted a marriage and the comic book characters just jump through the hoops? Yeah, that'll be a happy marriage\n\nOh wait, none of the above marriages had any lasting quality. Never mind.\n\nBillFebruary 21, 2016 10:30 PM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #3\n\nAnd the above post from Bill is not from me, the original Bill :)\n\nBillFebruary 21, 2016 10:07 PM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #3\n\nShould this go after Tales Of Suspense #48, as Iron Man is shown above in his newer armor?\n\nRobertFebruary 21, 2016 6:36 PM\n\nTales To Astonish #78-81\n\nPuppet Master is still in his Uncle Fester form here, I see.

I had checked and saw 256 was released with a Late Dec date and the others were back to normal but the first one is probably why I thought it was still on biweekly. Plus the issues after that didn't even feature Betsy so yeah there was enough time to get some fan reaction before they were done.\n\nMichaelFebruary 20, 2016 1:43 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nIt was back to regular monthly then- according to dcindexes Uncanny X-Men 256 came out on 10/3 and issue 258 came out on 12/5. According to Gruenwald back then finished books were SUPPOSED to be sent to the printers 8 weeks in advance but could still be done in as little as 3 weeks. Considering Lee had a reputation for lateness, I wouldn't be surprised if it was 3 weeks.\n\nRobertFebruary 20, 2016 1:25 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nOh to have an edit button. Anyway, my grammatical gymnastics aside, what I'm saying is that by the time the first Asian Psylocke issue would have hit stands they should have been finished with that arc and onto the next, right? Unless they were really cutting it close with deadlines then. And, like I said, she was introduced during a period they were biweekly. So was the time a book was finished to the time it hit stands really less than a month then?\n\nRobertFebruary 20, 2016 1:20 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nDoesn't that mean the first Asian Psylocke issue would have hit stands before they were even finished with the arc during a period UXM was biweekly? Doesn't seem right to me that they would have been finishing the books that close to shipping dates. I guess anything is possible given how notorious the Image guys were for cutting it close on deadlines or flat-out not being able to meet them. I'm sure her staying a hot Asian ninja chick was because it struck a chord with horny teenage boys, but it seems to me Claremont might be misremembering the timeline on when they started getting fan response and a decision was made to keep her that way.\n\nMichaelFebruary 20, 2016 12:51 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\n@Ben-According to Claremont, it was his idea and was originally supposed to be short-term temporary, like a 3-issue arc, but the fans liked it so much it became permanent:\n\nhttp://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2015/08/14/comic-book-legends-revealed-536/\n\nJeffFebruary 20, 2016 10:25 AM\n\nTales To Astonish #38 (Ant-Man)\n\nStan keeps using that term \"Bowery flophouse\" in these '60s Marvel stories... that term to me reeks of old-fashioned-ness (my mind goes to the movie Bowery Boys) but I guess that part of the city is where the bums all headed back in the '60s?\n\nLen Wein used that later on too in his \"Bowery Derelict\" storyline in ASM that re-introduced Doc Ock.\n\nMichaelFebruary 20, 2016 9:30 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\n@fnord- Harras claimed that the original trigger for Scott and Jean getting married was a story in the animated series in 1993- he had been asking for years to get them married and DeFalco kept saying no.\n\nVincent ValentiFebruary 20, 2016 12:12 AM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nFunny that both Bishop and Belladonna independently reveal Gambit's last name to be LeBeau in this issue.\n\nJonathanFebruary 19, 2016 9:47 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nI must be misremembering, I only read the Kwannon storyline once but I'd remembered the explanation being that the Kwannon side of Betsy had been tampering with Scott's mind.\n\nTo be honest that's the only explanation that makes sense to me. Scott completely loses the power of speech in both this issue and the last, and it does go past a comedy \"tongue tied by hot girl\" to him seeming brain damaged. It just felt like a re-run of Moondragon making Angel and Iceman lust after her in the Defenders.\n\nAs I'm sure others have pointed out, I always thought it was dumb that Scott suddenly found her attractive when she came out the water last issue in a swimsuit, since it doesn't really reveal any more of her than the ninja swimsuit she wears the whole time.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 19, 2016 3:33 PM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nOne of my favorite What If issues from the 1990s was \"What if the Fantastic Four fought Doctor Doom before they got their powers?\" It had an interesting twist ending. Reed Richards fixes the flaws in Doom's calculations and is able to rescue Doom's mother from Mephisto's netherworld. However, even with his mother back in his life, Doom *still* goes bad, because his monumental ego cannot deal with the fact that Richards solved a problem that thwarted him.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 19, 2016 3:13 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nZzzzzzzz... every single time the Thieves' Guild and Assassins' Guild have been mentioned over they years, starting from their very first appearance in this issue, I just get so totally bored to tears. The minute they pop up in a story, I mentally tune out, and the dialogue just becomes like one of Charlie Brown's teachers going \"Wah wah wah.\" That literally just happened when I tried to read the excerpt from the Gambit entry from Wikipedia that clyde posted here. It's why every single time Gambit has gotten a solo series I have avoided it like the plague, because sooner or later those damn Guilds show up.\n\n*Sigh!* I wish that the X-Men titles had stuck with Claremont's backstory for Gambit as a creation of Mister Sinister. It would have been much more preferable than this nonsense.\n\nBy the way, I am very much convinced that Jim Lee talked Claremont into turning Psylocke into a half-naked big-breasted ninja babe so that he'd have yet another sexy character to draw in fetishistic cheesecake poses. This issue just seems to confirm it.\n\nJCFebruary 19, 2016 11:26 AM\n\nX-Factor #78\n\nWTF is Val Cooper wearing?\n\nfnord12February 19, 2016 9:16 AM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nI thought Scott/Betsy thing, to the degree that there was any thought behind it, was a clumsy effort at putting Scott in a situation where he was tempted by another woman before ultimately deciding that Jean was his one true love, leading to their engagement in UX #308. Jean and Scott's marriage was a topic at the end of Simonson's X-Factor run but then it was said in the lettercol that it had been delayed, so this seemed like a bad way of inserting some drama into their relationship while stretching things out.\n\nclydeFebruary 19, 2016 8:36 AM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nFrom the Wiki entry on Gambit - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambit_(comics)\n\n\"Remy Etienne LeBeau[13] was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was kidnapped from the hospital where he was born, then raised by the LeBeau Clan Thieves' Guild, and given to the Antiquary as a tribute.\n\nThey referred to the child as \"Le Diable Blanc\" (\"the White Devil\") and believed he was prophesied to unite the warring Thieves' and Assassins' Guilds. Soon after, Remy was placed in the care of Fagan's Mob, a gang of street thieves who raised the child and taught him the ways of thievery. After living as an orphan on the streets, a 10-year-old Remy attempted to pick the pocket of Jean-Luc LeBeau, then patriarch of the Thieves' Guild. Jean-Luc took the boy off the streets and adopted him into his own family.\"\n\nMichaelFebruary 19, 2016 8:19 AM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nThe X-Traitor storyline is basically forgotten about for a couple of years after this issue. Portacio has said that they didn't have a particular character in mind as the X-Traitor but they did consider the idea that it was Bishop in a self-fulfilling prophecy:\n\nhttp://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/12/31/comic-book-legends-revealed-293/2/\n\nThe reason why it was forgotten about for so long was that the only candidates on the current team that would fit her \"should never have trusted...we knew so little about\" line were Rogue, Gambit and Bishop, and they were too popular to be revealed as a villain and gotten rid of. I'm surprised that no one thought of using Gateway- the X-Men knew almost nothing about him, we'd already seen him withhold from the X-Men that Maddie had been turned into the Goblin Queen and with that in mind, it would make sense for Jean in particular to be kicking herself for not investigating further.\n\nBTW, am I the only person that thought the way they revealed Gambit was adopted in this issue was kind of odd? Belladonna says something to the effect that while nobody would be dumb enough to take blame for the actual birth, Gambit was raised by the Thieves' Guild. I wasn't sure if she was just joking or Remy really was adopted.\n\nChrisWFebruary 19, 2016 3:54 AM\n\nDazzler: The Movie (Marvel Graphic Novel #12)\n\nI'm not pretending I can draw or letter a comic, but I have finally figured out how to put my Dazzler comic online.

She also dressed skimpy in the Savage Land where she didn't have any humans or mutants to run into. We're talking about a character with over 100 appearances in a single title, never mind cross-overs [\"Secret Wars,\" etc.] in the onslaught of exploitative pin-up poses. Compared to Storm, Betsy, Ali, Mary Jane, Sue Richards, etc, Rogue was remarkably consistent for a long time. And then threw it all away to go on a picnic with Gambit.\n\nMichaelFebruary 18, 2016 11:28 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nRogue was also dressed skimpy in X-Men 240, when she was flirting with Longshot.\n\nHaywerthFebruary 18, 2016 11:11 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nThanks, Michael! :-)\n\nErik RobbinsFebruary 18, 2016 10:05 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nI believe Jubilee does eventually join the New Warriors, but it is a very different Jubilee and a very different New Warriors (thanks to M-Day and Stamford)\n\nChrisWFebruary 18, 2016 9:51 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nJust compare her skin color with Gambit's. By all rights, her skin should be pasty white in comparison. Heck, she's the same color as everybody but Storm and Bishop (and Betsy, but it's hardly noticeable.)\n\nChrisWFebruary 18, 2016 9:44 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nThe baseball game, right? I'm not saying it's 100% consistent (and I did say I'd probably forgotten a few examples) but wasn't she playing outfield? Especially with Peter up to bat, not really a big chance that someone's going to slide into her. [Can't think of a better way to put that.] I'd like to think she'd have changed clothes when it was her turn at bat.\n\nI think it's totally believable that she would take every chance to let her skin feel the sun and the wind that she's so often denied (didn't Carol describe her as a hothouse flower, made for sultry nights and warm temperatures?) but for her own sanity, I think she'd work to minimize the dangers. Or the other X-Men would do it for her. What if Pick-a-villain shows up all of a sudden and throws Whoever right at Rogue, and Whoever is wearing equally skimpy clothing? Bam, two X-Men potentially neutralized just as Pick-a-villain is embarking on an evil scheme.\n\nRogue could have been the same pin-up with jeans and a frilly long-sleeved shirt. This is idiotic.\n\nMichaelFebruary 18, 2016 9:37 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\n@Haywerth- they eventually explained that Betsy was attracted to Scott but would have never acted on it if not for Kwannon's personality influencing her to take what she wanted. That doesn't explain Scott's attraction, though.\n\nThe script refers to Ghost Rider as a demon that knows firsthand the horrors of eternal damnation- apparently nobody told Lobdell it was supposed to be ambiguous whether Ghost Rider was a demon.\n\nMichaelFebruary 18, 2016 9:11 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nRe:Rogue wearing next to nothing- she also dressed skimpily in Uncanny X-Men 201.\n\nGambit's and Belladonna's story is a total ripoff of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nFnord, do you think this story is where Rogue starts to decline as a strong character? She continues her relationship with a man that \"forgot\" to mention he had a wife. Also, Gambit's constant threatening to touch Rogue can be seen as worse than \"normal\" sexual harassment, considering that she'll absorb his personality against his will if physical contact occurs, something Rogue wouldn't have put up with a year ago.\n\nChrisWFebruary 18, 2016 7:29 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nHe tried with Lee and Maddie, I guess he knows what he wants. \"Boobs, personality, common interests may be enough for some men, but I need a telepath to really be attracted.\" Doesn't explain why he never put the moves on Rachel. It's not like they're related or anything.\n\nNotice that Betsy never really says or does anything to indicate what he would be attracted to, and never has at any time they've been on-screen together. She's showing off her assets to the reader, not to Scott. Going back to their first meeting in \"Inferno,\" they've never had any interaction to indicate that her mere presence turns him into a tongue-tied teenager.\n\nPurely speculation, but I would guess that this was editorially-driven. Bob Harras decided they were selling these books to tongue-tied teenagers, and mandated Lee and Lobdell to do a storyline just like that. Betsy's the obvious choice for the female lead, Scott's the most-likely candidate for the male lead. Founding X-Man, the leader, and Harras had probably internalized Claremont's points that the guy ditched his wife and baby, he's a complete dick. So why not turn him into a babbling idiot by the mere presence of large Asian boobs?\n\nWhich led to Scott becoming the character that he is today, which I know almost-entirely by reputation. Lee and Kirby's creation deserved better than that.\n\nBobFebruary 18, 2016 6:57 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nSo Rogue, whose touch knocks people out, goes out wearing next to nothing and then just casually hangs off Gambit without a thought?\n\nThe cheesecake has rendered plots that make sense completely inapplicable here.\n\nAnd has Lee ever seen an actual woman? The bizarre anatomy isnt attractive. The women are just gross elongated sex dolls.\n\nAnd speaking of unrecognizable - Gambit has become a completely different character since Claremont bailed and lost anything unique he had in order to become a generic alpha male.\n\nBillFebruary 18, 2016 6:56 PM\n\nX-Men #9\n\nI never understood the Cyclops/Psylocke thing. Can Cyclops be attracted to a non-telepath? I always thought this attraction out of nowhere thing made him look weak willed; like he's too easily manipulated by any female telepath.\n\nChrisWFebruary 18, 2016 6:54 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nBill, you do know Ororo has her powers back, right? ;)\n\nChrisWFebruary 18, 2016 6:53 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nRogue is awfully willing to throw her bare skin right next to Gambit's bare skin. I get that her clothes are always being blown off in battle (which didn't happen nearly as often to Storm, Betsy, Ali, etc, talk about fetish fuel) but it's never made the slightest amount of sense why she would willfully show off so much skin for any reason whatsoever.\n\nRogue almost always wore her costume, which has gloves, full sleeves and leggings. I'm probably forgetting a couple, but I can only think of few times she actually wore normal clothes. Two of those times Carol was in charge (the shopping trip and then the Siege/Master Mold/Nimrod issues) where Carol had the sense to bundle up and put on gloves. In #210, Rogue played dress-up and stayed fairly-well covered, and in \"FF vs. X-men\" she treated herself to a shopping trip in Latveria, again staying fully covered (until Doom's robots blew her clothes off anyway.)\n\nShe did wear a string bikini in #185, but she was actively hiding from everyone and didn't think there'd be much danger of accidental touching. The following issue, she was in civvies without gloves, but she intended to steal Val Cooper's mind and find out what had happened to Storm.\n\nRogue has one of the most original superpowers in comics history, and it's to Claremont's credit that it was so traumatic for her, a teenage girl who can't touch anybody. Kurt's practically the only person in the mansion she can relate to as far as not being able to turn her power off - I'm talking the main Claremont run, not including Beast or Archangel - and at least Kurt hides behind a flamboyant attitude, and has a girlfriend he can share a hot tub with.\n\nI'm aware that I'm in the minority for liking the third \"X-Men\" movie, but one of the things I liked was how they used Rogue through the whole trilogy as an example of a mutant who very believably wanted to be cured.\n\nAs fetish fuel, Betsy's bad enough, but to add the complete negation of Rogue's personality and history just to become a pin-up, me no like. At the time, I was in puberty so a Jim Lee pin-up was a good-enough excuse. Heck, they probably kept me buying the series because I was rapidly getting tired of these unrecognizable characters and ridiculous storylines. Now, not impressed.\n\nThat Betsy/Scott thing for instance. Even in puberty I thought that was incredibly stupid. Jean had every right to dump his ass right then and there, and Xavier would have every right to remove him as leader of the X-Men for such bumbling behavior. The X-Men should not be led by someone who can be defeated by a group of evil, flirtatious strippers.\n\nBillFebruary 18, 2016 6:47 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nWait...isn't Mardi Gras normally in February or March?

Between GR, Deathlok, & Punisher, there were so many characters guest-starring in other comics, that it kind of ruined the \"coolness\" of it. At least this comic was the start of a crossover with GR.\n\nAFFebruary 18, 2016 1:48 PM\n\nX-Men #8\n\nPsylocke as a creation is pretty much nothing but fetish fuel.\n\nI have a hard time seeing this and accepting it is the same character that Alan Moore wrote in Captain Britain. But hey that's what Chris Claremont does to characters.\n\nHonestly, had Jim Lee left the X-Men series at the same time as Claremont, I definitely could've seen Psylocke being shunted off into retirement (or at the least having the body swap thing undone). But Jim Lee cemented the character and this became her status quo; stuck as a exploitative cheesecake (slightly racist) pin-up forever.\n\nAFFebruary 18, 2016 12:46 PM\n\nWarlock and the Infinity Watch #3-4\n\nOops, ready Superhuman Class as tons.\n\nBut never-the-less, there's a post-Gauntlet entry for you.\n\nAFFebruary 18, 2016 12:45 PM\n\nWarlock and the Infinity Watch #3-4\n\nThey upped that to 50 tons closer to this series:\n\nhttp://phantombunburyist.freedomforceforever.com/cripp12/15/tf_warlockback.jpg\n\nMortificatorFebruary 18, 2016 12:13 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\nI like how we see much of the text of Jameson's editorial in Marvels, and J.J. uses the big \"G\" as evidence that Reed fabricated the whole thing.\n\nMortificatorFebruary 18, 2016 11:34 AM\n\nWarlock and the Infinity Watch #3-4\n\nOn Warlock's strength, the Deluxe handbook says it's normally 4 tons, which feels right to me. It adds that he can temporarily increase it to 40 tons, which would explain how he's been able to put up at least a little fight against Thor before being pulverized.\n\nBut this was written pre-Infinity Gauntlet, so it could have changed when he came back to life.\n\nEnchloreFebruary 18, 2016 11:26 AM\n\nNFL Superpro #7\n\nConsidering how a lot of Brazilians go to soccer matches dressed as superheroes, now I want to see if anyone went as Superpro once...\n\nfnord12February 18, 2016 7:19 AM\n\nNFL Superpro #7\n\nAdded Repulsor!

Like I say, future evil versions were in the air.\n\nChrisWFebruary 17, 2016 6:22 PM\n\nNew Mutants #98-100\n\nBen, I think 'evil future version' was probably one of the few places where Liefeld really did have a clue where he was going. Such time travel things were already part of the X-titles (Rachel and Nimrod) and Portacio/Lee had already sent Nate Summers into the future. They also brought Bishop back in time. Bob Harras was also part of that 'Days of Future Present\" series of annuals which suggested Cable might grow up to be Ahab.\n\n\"Terminator 2\" was only a few months from release - I understand James Cameron wrote the first \"Terminator\" after reading \"Days of Futures Past,\" so how's that for a time loop? - and the evil future concept would have been in the air anyway. Don't hurt yourself trying to overthink how this would actually work. We're talking about Liefeld/Lee/Portacio comics that are trying to be in line with Chris Claremont comics. I could never do what fnord is doing.\n\nkvetoFebruary 17, 2016 4:58 PM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man annual #5\n\nmilkrolik, take it up with Omar who wrote the page.\n\nsorry, I really don't care anymore. It was an offhand comment from a year ago and it's FICTION. I'm not looking to prosecute spidey or anything.\n\nmikrolikFebruary 17, 2016 4:36 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\nOne thing I find fascinating about Galactus' first appearance is the letter \"G\" on his chest. In subsequent appearances this is dropped, because it was decided it was nonsensical for an alien to have a \"G\" on his costume.\n\nBut oddly enough, when a John Byrne story established that different alien races see Galactus differently and in their own image, the \"G\" might have then made more sense!\n\nRobertFebruary 17, 2016 4:25 PM\n\nJourney Into Mystery #120-125 / Thor #126-127\n\nThe design for the \"Demon\" bears a passing similarity to Kirby's later creation Kalibak. These are just phenomenal issues that are lots of fun to read. Kirby is clearly having a field day creatively and even Stan's scripting seems improved over where it was even a year before. Of course cutting back on the melodrama with Jane and focusing more on Asgard has a lot to do with that.\n\nfnord12February 17, 2016 3:34 PM\n\nNew Avengers: Illuminati #3\n\nThanks Thanos6. I did mention a similar possibility in the Considerations as an alternate. You note some problems with that idea, though, and i think ultimately it doesn't matter much because no matter what we're saying that what was revealed here wasn't true and that the characters have to have been mind-wiped before and/or after this encounter, and basically the whole thing is a wash. So i might as well leave it where i've got it. But it is telling that even the Marvel handbook basically had to hand-wave the story.\n\ncullenFebruary 17, 2016 2:18 PM\n\nNew Mutants #98-100\n\nDeadpool's neverending array of ephemera and gag props makes him probably the one case where the pouch trope was legit justified, even if it was well after-the-fact.\n\nBen HermanFebruary 17, 2016 1:53 PM\n\nNew Mutants #98-100\n\nBy the way, Fnord, regarding those innumerable pouches that Liefeld gives his characters, many years later in the Death of Wolverine: Deadpool & Captain America special, we DO get to see some of the stuff that Deadpool keeps in his...\n\n-house key\n\n-troll doll (non-exploding variety)\n\n-photo of his daughter Ellie\n\n-Mookie Wilson baseball trading card\n\n-grenade\n\nBen HermanFebruary 17, 2016 1:45 PM\n\nNew Mutants #98-100\n\nOver the years I have heard a couple of possible explanations for what Liefeld might have intended with the last page reveal of Stryfe unmasked in New Mutants #100.\n\nPossibility #1 - Liefeld wanted to end the issue on a shocking cliffhanger. When h decided to unmask Stryfe to show he looked exactly like Cable, he didn't actually have an explanation for why they were identical. He just decided to do something that he thought was cool, and decided that he'd come up with some sort of explanation later. I can certainly believe that, since during the year that Liefeld, Lee and Portacio were running the X-Men books, that's what they did quite a bit, toss out cool stuff without any thought as to where it was all supposed to end up.\n\nPossibility #2 - Liefeld decided to make Stryfe an future version of Cable who at some point goes bad and travels back in time to become his own arch enemy. I can *also* believe this. A couple of years later at Image, in the Prophet series, Liefeld introduced a mysterious villain named Crypt who was eventually unmasked and revealed to be (Shock! Horror!) a future version of Prophet who had turned evil and traveled back in time to become his own arch enemy. So obviously Liefeld had a fondness for this particular plot.\n\nIt may even be that both possibilities are correct. Liefeld unmasked Stryfe to look like Cable purely for a dramatic scene, and then subsequently came up with the \"evil future version\" to explain it.\n\nMind you, I'm glad that Marvel decided not to go with that. The whole concept never seems to make sense to me. If you are going back in time to fight your younger self, how could you possibly lose, since you already know what you previously did before? Unless you are not able to alter time, in which case why even bother going back to fight yourself in the first place, since you're inevitably going to lose?\n\nBesides, Stryfe unmasked doesn't look any older than Cable. But, then again, who can really tell from Liefeld's art?\n\nBesides, the whole \"fighting your evil future self\" was already done years before with Adam Warlock and the Magnus. A variation also appeared in Avengers, with Rama Tut and Immortus being semi-reformed future incarnations of Kang the Conqueror.\n\nOf course, the way Marvel eventually went with Stryfe, namely \"evil clone,\" is even more clichÃ©d. But I guess they were stuck with coming up with some sort of explanation with what Liefeld had left behind.\n\nAFFebruary 17, 2016 1:44 PM\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy annual #1\n\nI don't know that Korvac was being butchered just to spite Shooter. The character was created by Gerber and Starlin and most of the Korvac Saga was only plotted by Shooter whereas Star Brand and Beyonder were basically wholly his and largely seen as meant to be inserts of himself. And Star Brand and Beyonder were both trashed pretty quickly upon Shooter's departure whereas this was a fair bit after. I WANT to think DeFalco and co. would be above just running down a list of different Shooter \"characters\" to screw over, especially to still be doing it years after...\n\nPlus most of the names attached to Korvac Quest (other than DeFalco on Thor) are not the usual culprits for the anti-Shooter agendas. Did Marz and Valentino even do any Marvel work under Shooter's reign?\n\nI think it's just a consistent desire to recreate the success of Korvac Saga. Korvac is one character who should NEVER have been used again but every idiot thinks they are the ONE writer who can finally do it. Korvac is also brought back in the next Guardians annual and that time it has even WORSE Herb Trimpe art than the Thor annual from this story.\n\nThe retcon that Korvac revenge killed Carina is absolutely dreadful though and the story that spins out of that is fittingly poor (although the Silver Surfer issue is the closest to something quality, mostly due to Ron Lim's art).\n\nAtaru320February 17, 2016 12:45 PM\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy annual #1\n\nI think the continued meddling of Korvac is just a sad element of what happens to a good story when its popular and notable, like the Phoenix Saga with the X-Books. Korvac as a character was complete: a weird concept who by the right circumstances becomes a \"God\" and tries to use his powers to make a better universe only to fail. This is really just picking it apart both at the expense of Korvac as well as Shooter who made him what he became in the classic story. Its like there is this eternal grudge just because Shooter did what he did to make Marvel as successful creatively and financial as it was in the 80s that no one wants to let go of...and Korvac's the whipping boy among other things.\n\nAFFebruary 17, 2016 11:42 AM\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy annual #1\n\nIt's a shame this is the issue that fnord will read because the Korvac Quest storyline sucks. And the 3 issues during Infinity War with bad Liefeld-inspired Herb Trimpe art that bring the team to 616 briefly (and then 1 or 2 issues after by the next writer).\n\nValentino's Guardians of the Galaxy is surprisingly a treat. Consistently good and readable (bar any time Korvac is a plot point). I really enjoyed the trades of the run and this is after slogging through their 70s appearances and failing to ever really feel any interest for the characters or stories (and even Roger Stern for 3 issues was underwhelming).\n\nHe probably spends a bit too much time doing \"What happens to Popular Mainstream Marvel Hero XXXX over a 1000 years later?\", but Valentino really adds voices and characters to these formerly flat and bland characters. Although most of his villains are unfortunately named or the exact sort of cardboard characters the Guardians used to be, he definitely brings the stars to life.\n\nI've only read the one issue of the next run wrapping up the Infinity War story that's in the trades, so I have no idea if the follow-up writer keeps the book alive. It's cancelled 30 issues later which might be an indication but at the same time it's hardly like Guardians of the Galaxy could sustain a longer book back then. And at the rate Marvel continue to relaunch their titles, they apparently can't now either.\n\nBUFebruary 17, 2016 10:21 AM\n\nTales To Astonish #70-76 (Sub-Mariner)\n\n...It's hard to put a finger on, but there was something DC, in a bad way, about those early Ant Man/Giant Man features...\n\nAFFebruary 17, 2016 8:30 AM\n\nWonder Man #5-6\n\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/9/97/Avengers_Two_Wonder_Man_%26_Beast_Vol_1_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070614205526\n\nSadly wasn't that great.\n\nErik BeckFebruary 17, 2016 7:16 AM\n\nWonder Man #5-6\n\nI think part of the problem with Simon is that he was such a great character on the Avengers when he hung out with Hank. There's been a lot of character development since then, but almost all to the detriment of Simon's personality. This issue, with Hank back, just highlights that. A series with Simon and Hank would be fantastic...\n\n... if, someone else drew it. The opening Liefeld Pose #1 would have actually looked better if drawn by Liefeld and that's saying something.\n\nJSfanFebruary 17, 2016 6:06 AM\n\nNFL Superpro #7\n\nEveryone knows it isn't a real football game in Brazil until a riot breaks out.\n\nDavid Banes, that's true.

It says Beyonder was looking into his future a little bit.\n\nI don't think that makes sense, because at that point he was still in his \"look exactly like Steve Rogers phase,\" but in this story he's clearly in his iconic dark-haired look.\n\nAlso, it says Beyonder pulled the whole \"mutant Inhuman\" idea from Black Bolt's mind and went along with it, just to get the Illuminati out of his hair (whatever color it was). Again, this causes problems for me, because at this point in his growth it seems like he barely even comprehended the concept of lying and falsehoods.\n\nMichaelFebruary 16, 2016 8:58 PM\n\nWarlock and the Infinity Watch #3-4\n\nRegarding the effects of the Infinity Gauntlet being reversed, we saw that beings that were outside the universe proper were sometimes unaffected by Nebula's reversal (e.g. the Chain Gang and the Marvel Boy doppleganger). Although sometimes they were, like the Asgardians. So it's possible that Counter Earth was unaffected by the reversal because it was outside the universe.\n\nAFFebruary 16, 2016 8:21 PM\n\nWarlock and the Infinity Watch #3-4\n\nIf you think this art isn't good, wait til we get to the Tom Grindberg issues...\n\nRobertFebruary 16, 2016 8:07 PM\n\nNFL Superpro #7\n\n\"How does Razor Fist go to the bathroom?\",\n\nVery carefully.

Yes, obviously the TPB is to tie in with Marvel's shows on Netflix, and not this website, but still, that was some nice synchronicity.\n\nThe Cage TPB also collects the eight page Marvel Comics Presents story that led into it. However it does *not* contain the \"Black Punisher\" storyline. Yes, I know, it's a shocking and unconscionable omission :P\n\nRobertFebruary 16, 2016 1:42 PM\n\nTales To Astonish #70-76 (Sub-Mariner)\n\n@Steven - I agree they're way better than the Giant-Man stories, which were possibly the worst superhero comics Marvel was putting out at the time (rivaled only by Daredevil IMO).

The ideas that seemed to have the most gravitas were usually pretty ho-hum. I did love What if the X-Men had lost Inferno. The Ron Lim art was pretty great and the random superheroes and beings that survived and allied together (Baron Mordo, Steve Rogers as the Captain) were somewhat interesting. A fun little series when done right.\n\nAFFebruary 16, 2016 10:17 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nWhat If had this weird trend were the good ideas were usually done badly (What If Spider-Man Married Black Cat?, What If Spider-Man Kept his Black Suit) and the uninteresting ideas were usually the good issues (What If The Avengers Were Pawns of Korvac, What If Atlantis Attacks).\n\nMark BlackFebruary 16, 2016 9:41 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nThe issue (#34) preceding this was the humour issue, is that correct? I lost interest in What If around this point due to the dearth of quality art and the lack of clear storytelling. The points of divergence seemed to be less clear and the stories seemed more like alternate universe/alternate histories rather than divergences. I definitely checked in with the series after this (What if Storm remained a thief and What if the Punisher became Captain America), but this and the Phoenix storyline before it were where I stopped making it a must-buy. I think by the end of 1992, I was only reading Hulk, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the two X-Men titles regularly. What is nuts is that I had a full run of the first ten issues of Stormwatch so my tastes weren't that discerning.\n\nTuomasFebruary 16, 2016 8:40 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nAlso, creating flashy-looking splash pages is not story-telling, it's poster art. Based on the examples seen here and in the Wolverine solo series entry, Pacella isn't very good at the panel-to-panel transitions that are the meat and potatoes of comic book storytelling. The movements in his action sequences are hard to follow, he doesn't care about image-counterimage positioning (for example, on the page where Sinister and Wolverine are talking, Sinister's face should be looking left, not right, to create the effect of the two facing each other), that sideways panel is a sheer nuisance to the reader that breaks rhythm of the page, and so on...\n\nfnord12February 16, 2016 8:32 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nRegarding character appearances:\n\nUnless i missed it (and nearly all of the TVA scenes have been included as scans), no one is named Mr. Mobius. I don't know if he is also Mr. Deputy Secretary or something like that. But since we know that the TVA employees can take vacations, i don't want to assume that he's here.\n\nTagging time-travelers like Kang is always problematic since it's not guaranteed that they're appearing chronologically from their perspective. But this is definitely a case where we are in Kang's \"past\" from the perspective of the character that i usually tag. The MCP is more suited to this sort of thing since they list the appearances from the perspective of each character. If i were to tag Kang here it would look like he reverted to his Nathanial Richards form after his appearance in Fantastic Four #325, and that would be weird.\n\nAs for the Space Phantoms, i did wonder about tagging the Space Phantom, but a narration panel says \"the Space Phantom's people\" which i took to mean that the actual Space Phantom wasn't there.\n\nAll three are tricky, and i can definitely see the argument for listing Mr. Mobius and Space Phantom. At least it wouldn't cause any harm to their character chronologies. But i'd prefer to not do it unless i saw confirmation that they were actually appearing.\n\nTuomasFebruary 16, 2016 8:28 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nOf course there can be exaggeration in cartooning, but if it goes beyond a certain limit, it doesn't feel like the artist did it for artistic effect anymore, it looks like he was simply too lazy or incompetent to care about how certain body parts work. Superhero comics aren't Looney Tunes cartoons, they still require a certain amount of realism, otherwise the results just look silly. Or do you honestly think Colossus' shrunken head or Wolverine's teeny tiny feet look cool on that splash page?\n\nBrimstoneFebruary 16, 2016 6:21 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nOk well if I'm putting on my big boy serious comic nerd hat, let me respond to that with a sincere kinda wondering why and where all comic fans demanded completely realistic art complete with perfect anatomy? this is a comic book, bruh. it's cartooning. they can take some liberties with how muscles look, aint ANY of it realistic LOL! the point is, the set up of the page, the dynamic STORYTELLIG that Pacella is a master of, the way the characters are leaping out at the reader- that is what I am talking about. I don't think any comic artists do perfect anatomy and wouldn't that be kinda flat and bland? I thought comics were supposed to be over the top\n\nTuomasFebruary 16, 2016 6:16 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nThe splash page looks ridiculous! Look at the tiny pointed feet on Wolverine and Colossus! And both of their heads appear to be shrunken, because they're not in proportion to their bodies. And Iceman's ice bridge seems to originate from Colossus back, because it doesn't continue on his left side like it should. And Rogue's waist is smaller than her breasts, and so on...\n\nStill, that splash is better than the second one by Pacella that Fnord posted, where Colossus' head is even more ridiculously tiny, Wolverine's legs are missing below his thighs, Colossus foot is conveniently obscured by brown mist so Pacella doesn't have to draw it, etc. I'm not the biggest fan of Kirby's art, but he would never have drawn splash pages as lazy and amateurish as these.\n\nBrimstoneFebruary 16, 2016 5:21 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nDude, that Mark Pacella art is FAN-TASTIC. Day-umm, I need to get some What If?s!!!! That splash page is totally a direct descendent of the Kirby approach the way the X-Men are leaping out of the page... dude, not trying to fan flames but only a snob or something could deny that? This storyline looks epic I didn't know Roy Thomas had it in him because those West Coast Avengers look kinda hit and miss.. I had no idea Wolverine was ever Lord of the Vampires and probably would never had known so I am very glad you posted this fnord!!!!\n\nAFFebruary 16, 2016 3:57 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nAlso possibly Space Phantom?\n\nAFFebruary 16, 2016 3:08 AM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nNot sure how you'd even want to tackle it but wouldn't the Nathaniel Richards appearance count as a Kang/Rama-Tut appearance?\n\naccordion321February 16, 2016 12:28 AM\n\nMarvel Spotlight #6-11\n\nMotorcyle stuntmen and Satanic paranoia -- two great 70s fads.\n\nkvetoFebruary 15, 2016 11:18 PM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man annual #5\n\nmilkrolik: Ty vole. http://www.spiderfan.org/faq/killed.html\n\nThanos6February 15, 2016 10:29 PM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nThe one thing that always makes my brain hurt about this story: You'd think the one thing the TVA wouldn't be able to know the future of is themselves.\n\nThanos6February 15, 2016 10:25 PM\n\nWhat If? #35-39\n\nfnord, was Mr. Mobius one of the TVA staffers in this story?

The missiles came from a car; Spider-man led the second missile back to the car to stop it. It was self defense- he didn't know if anyone was in the car (and the driver was completely unharmed).\n\nI don't think Spidey knew the Finisher would die, but he had to stop the missiles. Also \"leading a heat-seeking missile into him\", while you neglect to mention that he was the one who fired the missile at Spidey.\n\nStill, this issue was published a few years before Spidey's \"no killing mantra\" was fully formed (it didn't start until after ASM 122), and you can argue he's responsible for the Finisher's death; but it was completely justified self-defense, not deliberate murder.\n\nTCPFebruary 15, 2016 11:55 AM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man #2\n\nWhile it is noted here that The Vulture was eventually given super-strength, \"guy with wings\" seems to be one of Ditko's go-to villain gimmicks. There was that weird bird villain for the Speedball story in Marvel Comics Presents #14, and a winged-inventor similar to The Vulture would appear in Ditko's graphic novel \"The Mocker.\" It's a nice, simple concept for a villain, though it works a lot better in a world not populated with so many super-powered beings.\n\nErik BeckFebruary 15, 2016 8:30 AM\n\nCage #1\n\nThe release of the trade is almost certainly because of his presence in Jessica Jones and his upcoming series.\n\nAnd I have to say, I never much cared for Luke Cage when I was a kid. But the way they write him in Jessica Jones, I am much more interested in him now.\n\nfnord12February 15, 2016 8:02 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #13\n\nThanks, Omar. I agree. I've added a scan and added the Melter as a Character Appearing.\n\nfnord12February 15, 2016 7:57 AM\n\nWhat's Missing\n\nThe Giant-Size Dracula #5 back-up seems to be about a man in an insane asylum named Keith Starr that is imagining that he's fighting demons, so it doesn't seem to be in continuity unless he turns out to be related to Trish Starr or something.\n\nThe Dr. Droom story in Giant-Size Man-Thing #3 is a reprint from Amazing Adventures #6. I don't have that but it falls into the \"i don't list every missing pre-FF #1 story\" category.\n\nFor the Giant-Size Chillers stories, i'll wait and see if anything references them. Which is unlikely at this point but there are still other Marvel horror comics like Vampire Tales that i haven't covered.\n\nThanks for pointing them out. It was worth looking into even if they seem to have turned out to be mostly non-canon.\n\nJeffFebruary 15, 2016 12:43 AM\n\nX-Force #5\n\nBoom Boom looks like 40 in that scan but the character is supposed to be barely what, 15/16?\n\nAndrewFebruary 14, 2016 8:29 PM\n\nFantastic Four #22\n\nAnother reason for the high significance rating: this issue is the first time Stan announced a contest with \"no prize.\"\n\nRobertFebruary 14, 2016 7:58 PM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man '96\n\nI'm not a big fan of Allred on stuff like this but that's because I prefer more traditional comic book artists on superhero books and not cartoonists. I did enjoy his work on Madman and iZOMBIE so I'm certainly not saying he has no talent. It's just a matter of preference.\n\nRobertFebruary 14, 2016 3:54 PM\n\nFantastic Four #37-38\n\n#37 features another of Kirby's space photo backgrounds but with a note from Stan pretty much apologizing for the fuzzy picture quality. While I know many don't like these little notes and feel like they were 'shots' from Stan directed at Jack, I think in this case it was justified. I may have mentioned it on here before but I don't care much for Kirby's choices to use the photo backgrounds. Putting aside the debate about the artistic merits of it (whether it's creative experimentation or just laziness), the technology wasn't there yet for it to be effective. So you get fuzzy black & white photos that look unattractive and out of place in a color comic.\n\nRickFebruary 14, 2016 3:02 PM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man annual #1\n\nYes Omar, that's right.\n\nThis is where they meet for the first time. Electro and Sandman bring Betty and Aunt May to Ock. When they come in Ock says \"Ah, Miss Brant! Come in! I've been expecting you! And who is that charming lady with you?\n\nOmar KarinduFebruary 14, 2016 2:00 PM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man annual #1\n\nIsn't this pretty much where the whole \"Ock-May romance/friendship\" idea gets rolling?\n\nOmar KarinduFebruary 14, 2016 1:54 PM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #13\n\nThe other figure dragging away the Black Knight at the end looks like the Melter; the weird shape of his original helmet is just barely visible, and he has a cape as the Melter did.\n\nMark DrummondFebruary 14, 2016 11:34 AM\n\nWhat's Missing\n\nGiant-Size Dracula #5 has a backup story that I believe is referred to an MU story, but I can't remember which one or in what time period the story takes place in.\n\nGiant-Size Man-Thing #3 apparently reprints a Dr. Droom story that's been altered to say Dr. Druid.\n\nThe 1975 Giant-Size Chillers series has several new stories in all 3 issues, which is weird because it had been some years since Marvel was doing horror anthology stories(they may have been leftover from cancelled b&w horror mags). It's possible that some stories may have been placed in the MU at some point.\n\nMark DrummondFebruary 14, 2016 11:16 AM\n\nGiant-Size Super-Heroes #1\n\nMarvel actually did run a house ad showing this as Giant-Size Super-Stars #2.\n\nErik BeckFebruary 14, 2016 8:49 AM\n\nCode of Honor #4\n\nIf we're talking about photos, that last panel of Iron Man looks like a painted over photo of Mego Iron Man from TTT.\n\nRobertFebruary 14, 2016 7:38 AM\n\nFantastic Four #35\n\nIt's probably just a coloring error but when Diablo first appears in this issue his costume is red with the arms and legs bare. He looks even sillier than he does in the scans above.\n\nRobertFebruary 14, 2016 6:17 AM\n\nFantastic Four #34\n\nThere is something about Gideon's look and personality that makes me feel like he was modeled after a real-life person. I half-expected to come on and find a comment from Mark Drummond saying who he was based on, but no such luck. He kind of reminds me of G. Gordon Liddy, but he still had a head of hair and no mustache at this point so it's certainly not him.\n\nOn another note, there is nothing about this issue that is particularly remarkable but it really struck me while reading it how far Kirby's artwork on this title had come in just two years (and still so much more great stuff to come). In particular I was impressed with his backgrounds here. Whereas in a lot of the early FF issues he often would leave the backgrounds blank, here there's only a handful of panels where that's the case.\n\nBrian CareyFebruary 14, 2016 5:43 AM\n\nNick Fury Agent of SHIELD #37-41\n\nCelebrity Brimstone, I'm trying to give you the benefit of a doubt today but, Nick Fury is a VERY important and historical character in the Marvel Universe and certainly predates the Sam Jackson incarnation you're so impressed with. Look up Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos, which is a war book done Marvel style and Steranko's influential and historic run in the late 60s'. Then you will make us all proud on the Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nErik RobbinsFebruary 13, 2016 11:35 PM\n\nFantastic Four #357-360\n\nThat's funny, Erik. I've been meaning to write a similar piece.

It's worth noting that during Hammerhead's later appearances in Gerry Conway's gang war storyline, he only manages to go one-on-one with Peter when Peter is weakened by being injected by a virus.\n\nJonathanFebruary 13, 2016 5:25 PM\n\nFantastic Four #233\n\nIf that was what Byrne was implying, I'm all in favour of it. I always disliked Hammerhead, I could never see the point in a villain whose only power was a very hard top of the skull.\n\nIn their first fight, Hammerhead tricks Spider-Man into punching the top of his skull, hurting Spider-Man's hand, but as far as I'm concerned the next panel should have been Peter punching him in the gut, and the character should never have had to appear again. (Though I do enjoy this story and his Power Man & Iron Fist appearance.)\n\nNot sure if the exo-suit ever appeared again, but it makes sense to me that Byrne might feel the same as Stern that Spider-Man shouldn't have too much trouble with most villains with normal human strength.\n\nOmar KarinduFebruary 13, 2016 4:20 PM\n\nFantastic Four #233\n\nDuring their fight scene, Johnny muses that Hammerhead shouldn't be able to trade shots with superhumans, and considers him a \"punk who got lucky\" and made it to the top in the Maggia. And we never do find out just when Hammerhead started using that disguised exosuit.\n\nIs Byrne implying that Hammerhead shouldn't have been able to hang with the likes of Spider-Man and Doc Ock in hand-to-hand combat?\n\nkvetoFebruary 13, 2016 2:56 PM\n\nTales Of Suspense #63 (Iron Man)\n\nUgh, modern comics reference. Where's my wooden stake?\n\nMichaelFebruary 13, 2016 2:50 PM\n\nTales Of Suspense #63 (Iron Man)\n\nThat's not too likely as the Phantom was killed off in Iron Age Omega while the Ghost was given a different origin in Thunderbolts.\n\nMark DrummondFebruary 13, 2016 2:19 PM\n\nMarvel Two-In-One #8\n\nWyatt Wingfoot's tribe, the Keewazi, is called the Konohoti here.\n\nAt one point, the Miracle Man's power doesn't work on Ghost Rider, and Ghost Rider assumes that the power of the \"Friend\" may be responsible. This is never explained elsewhere, and it isn't mentioned in GR's own book.\n\nfnord12February 13, 2016 11:46 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #14\n\nI don't know!

Lyja would have just been stuck as Alicia forever.\n\nAnd, on a related tangent to fnord's intro to this: That was the joy of all the Earth-2 stories at DC from the early 60's to the mid 80's. It allowed those characters to grow older and deal with aging and a new generation while simultaneously allowing the main DC characters to stay younger and in less of a state of change.\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 8:13 AM\n\nPunisher Summer Special #2\n\nHe did have a nice long run with Geoff Johns on Teen Titans, which was a particularly fun, colorful, and energetic book.\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 8:05 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #8\n\nOh well sure, though I doubt many if anyone reading UTOS hadn't alrdy familiarized themselves with that tidbit.\n\nkvetoFebruary 13, 2016 8:01 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #8\n\nThats kinda my point. There were no clues in the original stories. All the \"clues\"are in the UTOS. The UTOS were all written with the knowledge that anyone reading them already knew Norman was the GG, and didn't try to hide the fact.\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 7:52 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #8\n\neveryone would just say \"We knew that.\"\n\nIs that strictly true? Assuming you weren't alrdy spoiled, I can't recall anything in those original stories that strictly pointed to it being Norman. Certainly Ditko never intended it to be so, so I can't imagine there were hidden clues or anything of the like.\n\nAFFebruary 13, 2016 7:45 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #8\n\nThis and the other Headsman issue were the only Untold Tales of Spider-Man issues I found myself able to tolerate. Mostly because I bloody loved Thunderbolts: Siege and thought Headsman's story was beautifully tragic.\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 7:33 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #10\n\nI bet that wasn't the only thing getting spilled on Commanda...\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 7:31 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #14\n\nHow does Sally Avril appear here if she died the last issue?\n\nkvetoFebruary 13, 2016 7:19 AM\n\nUntold Tales of Spider-Man #8\n\nYou know UTOS just feels like a missed opportunity. They sometimes get an idea of the right art but screw it up with modern style villains like the Headsman and Scorcher which just pull you out of the nostalgia.\n\nIt would be interesting if somebody new read the comics in order with the UTOS issues. When they'd get to the big green goblin reveal in ASM #39, everyone would just say \"We knew that.\"\n\n(Kinda what kids growing up with Star Wars prequels must say when Vader reveals himself as Luke's father in \"Ãmpire\".)\n\nkvetoFebruary 13, 2016 7:04 AM\n\nTales Of Suspense #63 (Iron Man)\n\nYou know, Tony Stark's romantic situation should have been another of the great marvel conundrums. Kind of a mirror image of the Spider-man situation. Whereas Spidey had to maintain a puny Parker persona to hide his identity (and not get the girls. Remember, Liz Allen was in love with Spider-man).\n\nTony, on the other hand, had a great tragic situation. He had to prject the image of a playboy as was expected of him by society, but in reality he couldn't love any girls due to his heart condition. This made Tony Stark about as sympathetic a character as he'd ever be.\n\nLater, when he became the actual playboy due to his heart operation, he became very unlikable.\n\nI think it is the Marvel Appendix that put forth the Phantom as a possible candidate to be the Ghost later. Similar m.o.s and unmasked looks. I'd be fine with that.\n\nBRIMSTONEFebruary 13, 2016 6:40 AM\n\nPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #74-76\n\nDoc Ock's henchmen, reattaching his arms complete in surgical gear just made me think \"it's a good thing henchman goons are such good surgeons!!!\" lol\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 6:38 AM\n\nPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #74-76\n\nAnd so ends the Deb Whitman saga, not with a bang but with the usual Mantlo bleh. It's a shame too, I always thought of Deb as maybe THE girlfriend. She's cute but nerdy, smart enuff to figure out Pete's secret but indecisive enuff to trust her judgement. She's essentially a female Peter Parker which Stern has admitted to.\n\nI think she had a lot of longterm potential as she's smart and daring enuff that she would've been able to call Peter out on his shit if they had progressed into a LTR and she's pretty but not glamour model level that takes away from Peter's everyman status.\n\nPete's last longterm relationship in Slott's ASM is Carlie Cooper who's almost purrfectly cloned from the Deb Whitman mold, right down to her putting together his secret.\n\nJonathanFebruary 13, 2016 6:30 AM\n\nDaredevil #5\n\n@Robert - Agree that the early run of Daredevil is pretty awful in general. I was amazed how poor it was when I first picked up a Daredevil \"Essentials\" volume. I will say however that I do think it has the slight edge over Giant Man, because there's the very occasional good story here. I don't think any of Giant Man & Wasp stories are as good as Daredevil 7 (which I have a lot of love for) with Daredevil fighting a losing battle against Namor, definitely an influence on later things like Daredevil's losing battle against the Hulk in Frank Miller's run. I also think the Ani-Men story in 10 & 11 (which Wally Wood wrote some of) stands out a little. And I have some ironic affection for the Mike Murdock plotline, in a so-bad-it's- good way. But yeah, Daredevil for the most part has an awful set of villains for the first few years, and easily some of the worst/blandest stories Stan was involved in during the 60s.\n\nAFFebruary 13, 2016 6:12 AM\n\nAmazing Spider-Man #20\n\nhttp://www.supermegamonkey.net/chronocomic/entries/daredevil_82-83.shtml\n\nJCFebruary 13, 2016 1:15 AM\n\nPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #100\n\nThe old Spider-Man handbook to the TSR Marvel RPG had the symbiote listed as weaker to sonics than it is to fire fwiw.\n\nMichaelFebruary 12, 2016 11:55 PM\n\nFantastic Four #48-50\n\nA recurring theme of this site seems to be \"scenes cut from fnord's reprints\". :)\n\nMichaelFebruary 12, 2016 11:53 PM\n\nSpider-Man/Fantastic Four #2\n\nThis issue came out a few months AFTER Fall of the Hulks Alpha.

Amazingly Stilt-Man has longevity mostly due to its visual and the utter ridiculousness...plus you could perhaps see his tech being used better by others. Considering most of the other turkeys Matt was getting stuck with even at this point (The Matador...nuff said), its lucky Stilt-Man was crazy enough to actually work...even if just in the \"Paste-Pot Pete\" sort of way.\n\nAbeLincoln1865February 12, 2016 6:08 PM\n\nPeter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #55\n\nOr maybe it shows just how dumb Civil War was.\n\nRobertFebruary 12, 2016 5:45 PM\n\nTales To Astonish #65 (Giant-Man/Wasp)\n\nThat costume is all kinds of terrible. I'm not sure who designed it (Powell or Heck, I would assume) but it looks more DC than Marvel to me. Also, yet another Christian Dior reference from Lee. I had no idea Stan was so fashion-conscious.
