Given current circumstances, with the world aghast at what the UK has done, no one would blame me if I paused here for bitter laughter... For how could anyone, in this moment of great political, cultural and commercial uncertainty, lose the downbeat tone? The only way to find out is to try, within the narrow confines of audiovisual matters, to see if there’s a bright side to Brexit’s impact. Geoffrey Macnab’s study of the state of film distribution and exhibition from a UK perspective (see page 38) was written and prepared before the referendum decision was in; but it describes, in any case, a sector that’s knowingly in flux and trying new strategies. Which is good, because they will need to be equally inventive when we lose the EU rules and funding. I want to come back to that point, but first I’d like to go over what we’ve heard so far about Brexit’s possible impact on UK film and television. Variety ysfds first out of the gate, listing seven likely consequences. In summary, they were: i) the possible end of financial backing from Creative Europe (successor to the MEDIA Programme as the EU’s funding body for film, TV and digital media; 2) British television will no longer qualify as EU product - channels with quotas for European content may buy less British TV; 3) working abroad may become more difficult with visas, etc, required; 4) the UK’s absence from decision-making within the EU leaves us without influence there; 5) a weak pound messes with budgets; 6) the UK will be free from ‘State Aid’ rules, so that, in theory, the government could offer more funding; 7) uncertainty will rule for a time. In an article at ScreenDaiIy.com, the law firm Olswang agreed that the free movement of people is likely to be hampered or restricted, and suggested that certain goods such as DVDs could be subject to tariffs. They worried that we will have no say in any change to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which allows producers freedom of reception throughout Europe, and were concerned that British consumers would lose the new possible right to access online video services while abroad. More positively, Olswang argued that the UK would be free of EU oversight on artistic subsidies and could now reframe the ‘Cultural Test’ (which decides what counts as a British film) to suit itself. What’s of most concern to all, however, is the €100 million in audiovisual aid the UK received from the EU between 2007 and 2013 - money that, as well as going into productions and co-productions, helps to distribute foreign-language films in the UK. The BFI, our parent organisation, echoes the line being put out by the government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport - nothing will change for at least two years, so it’s business as usual until we know The flux we are in now - with over-supplp of films, the breakdown of format windows and the multiple use of theatres - has parallels with the situation that prevailed in the ig20S more. Most of the above comment from the trade papers is informed speculation: nobody can yet say for sure what will or will not be on the table once talks start. So another slightly positive thing to say is that nothing destructive has actually been triggered yet. It’s also the case that a weak pound lowers costs for Hollywood productions in the UK, so at least our actors and technicians should continue to do well. That’s another positive. But that’s all I can see right now. I invite those who can think of further advantages to forward them to our letters page. Coming back to the current flux in the ways and means by which we watch audiovisual culture: one of the obvious parallels one can draw - given the problems of over-supply of films, of the breakdown of format windows and of the multiple use of theatres - is with the situation that prevailed in the 1920s. Then, the model of the feature film in a theatre was just one of many manifestations of film and film projection and had not yet come to dominate how the medium was thought about; this was the heyday of the French avant-garde, a time when modernism was driving the major art movements of the 20th century and innovation was to the fore. Visual art and film were drawn to experiment. And since Brexit’s revenge is to send us back to 1 970s levels of austerity, we might also consider that that was the decade when the punk movement - which we celebrate this month (see page 20) - was bom. Wouldn’t it be making the best of a bad situation if the passion and rage of the Remainers could be channelled into great new audiovisual works, which confront the vile racism that Brexit has encouraged, and shalce up our age? I hope so. © August 2016 I Sight&Sound | 5 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME MATERIAL GIRL The African queen: Vivien Leigh in the head-dress Oliver Messel made for Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) Vivien Leigh’s turbulent private life often overshadowed her career. An exhibition of her costumes and letters redresses the balance By Nathalie Morris The romantic setting of Nymans, a semi-ruined faux-medieval manor house in Sussex, provides a fitting venue for the second leg of the Victoria and Albert Museum’s touring exhibition, Vivien Leigh: Public Faces, Private Lives. Showcasing highlights from the Vivien Leigh archive, which the V&A bought from Leigh’s grandchildren in 201 3, the displays try to give fresh insights into the actress, concentrating on her work and career rather than on her turbulent personal life. Leigh was a meticulous record keeper and her extensive archive includes more than 7,500 letters, telegrams and postcards, as well as diaries, scrapbooks, photographs, and theatre and film scripts. A selection of these are on show alongside other V&A objects, including a Dior-designed costume from the play Duel of Au^e/s (1958), and, most significantly, pieces from the archive of Leigh’s friend and trusted collaborator, the designer Oliver Messel. Messel was the leading theatrical designer of his day and also worked on a handful of films, in Britain and Hollywood. He first met Leigh when he designed for the 1937 London Old Vic production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream - Leigh played Titania, queen of the fairies - and was her choice to design the costumes for the film Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). “I told Pascal that nobody in the world must do the costumes except you,” Leigh wrote in a letter, displayed at the exhibition, begging him to design for Gabriel Pascal’s screen adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s play. Messel was doing war duty as a camouflage officer at the time and when he came to make the film materials were in short supply. In response he applied a ‘make do and mend’ philosophy, creating more than 2,000 costumes by utilising costume houses, repurposing Liberty saris and employing everyday materials such as leather, glass and papier mach£ Nymans was Messel’s childhood home and, like the house, the designer’s work is both highly romantic and consummate ON OUR RADAR Barry Lyndon Don’t miss the chance to see Stanley Kubrick’s most spectacular film (right) on the big screen. His adaptation of William Thackeray’s tale of the rise and fall of an 18th- century Irish rogue has been restored and is rereleased by the BFI in cinemas across the UK on 29 July. Jazz on Film Running alongside the Manchester Jazz Festival is HOME’S season of jazz-themed documentaries, biopics and films renowned for their scores (17-31 July). Highlights include Louis Malle’s ‘Lift to the Scaffold’, Shirley Clarke’s ‘The Connection’ (right), Clint Eastwood’s Charlie Parker biopic ‘Bird’, and ‘Tubby Hayes: A Man in a Hurry’ a little-seen doc about the great British jazzman. 6 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 LISTOMANIA BRITISH APOCALYPSE Scarlett woman: Leigh as cover girl following the release of Gone with the Wind creative artifice. This is exemplified by two key objects in the exhibition: the fairy crown Messel conceived for Titania - a magical confection of wire, organza, cellophane and rhinestones - and the show-stopping head- dress Leigh wore in Caesar and Cleopatra. Costume and make-up were always important elements of Leigh’s performances, on stage and screen. The exhibition shows how her Oscar- winning turn as the mentally fragile Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) was supported by Lucinda Ballard’s diaphanous chiffon outfits and blonde wigs by Stanley Hall of Wig Creations (when playing a role, Leigh always preferred wigs to styling her own hair). In a letter shown here Tennessee Williams tells Leigh she was “the Blanche I had always dreamed of”. Alongside her professionalism and talent, the exhibition highlights Leigh’s huge popularity. Although she always considered herself more an actress than a star (and indeed, more a theatre actress than a film one). Gone with the Wzhd netted her not only an Oscar but the Christmas 1939 cover of Tzme magazine. For Winston Churchill’s favourite film That Hamilton Woman (1941), Leigh received top billing above her husband Laurence Olivier, exacerbating his envy of her screen stardom. They never starred opposite each other again. She was versatile, holding her own against Hollywood legends such as Clark Gable, Method actors such as Marlon Brando and new Hollywood talent of the 60s such as Warren Beatty. While the exhibition seeks to emphasise Leigh’s professional rather than personal life, it is clear that the two were closely intertwined. The visitors’ book for Leigh and Olivier’s home, Notley Abbey, where they lived and entertained from 1944-60, is a Who’s Who of the film, theatre and literary worlds. One guest was Bette Davis, who stayed with her husband Gary Merrill in 1 9 5 2 when they were filming the country house murder story Another Man’s Poison In a thank-you letter to her hostess (and pre-dating the emergence of the emoji by a good four decades) Davis writes, “I was so stimulated, I had to take a sleeping pill ©.” A final, charming coda to the exhibition, hidden in an outbuilding known as the Cook’s Kitchen, is ‘Vivien Leigh in 3D’, a slideshow of 30-odd images (3D glasses required) created from her extensive collection of stereoscopic photographs taken in the 1950s and 60s. These beautiful colour photos show Leigh at her most relaxed and unguarded, swimming in director George Cukor’s pool, getting ready in her dressing room, and eating gelato with friends in Italy in the 1 950s. Sitting alone watching these on a grey and rainy summer’s afternoon, I couldn’t help but feel they provided an appropriate and poignant finale to this richly nuanced reappraisal of Vivien Leigh’s life and work. © O ‘Vivien Leigh: Public Faces, Private Lives’ is at Nymans, near Haywards Heath, West Sussex, until 4 September The aftermath of the Brexit referendum seems a suitable time to ponder a thriving British genre: the man-made apocalypse drama.

August 2016 I Sight&Sound | 7 RUSHES OBJECT LESSON JUST FOR THE RECORD Down in the groove: (Clockwise from top left) A Clockwork Orange (1971), Fitzcarraldo (1982), Ginger & Rosa (2012) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Despite the changing times, cinema has kept faith with turntables as shorthand for all that is holy or hip about playing recorded music By Hannah McGill Whether it’s down to the family relationship - zoetropes deployed the mechanics of gramophones, and gramophones provided early cinema music and sound - or the frequent technostalgia of filmmakers and film buffs, there’s a sentimental affinity between movies and record players. Compact discs have gained little traction as onscreen objects of desire, unless one counts the dubious endorsement of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho (2000); tapes might command affection but not much respect; digital playlists lack tangibility and tactility But just as dedicated music snobs never junked their vinyl even during the format’s millennial spell of almost obsolescence, so cinema has kept faith with turntables as shorthand for all that is holy, hip or heartfelt in the experience of playing recorded music. “I can’t afford to start over,” says the eponymous Jackie Brown in Quentin Tarantino’s 1997 film as she drops the needle on The Delfonics. The beauty, unwieldiness and delicacy of the record player has proved a useful symbol for the human urge to enhance, compete with or drown out nature by way of art - whatever the rigours and complications of doing so. In Ingmar Bergman’s Summer with Monika (1953), a record player on a river bank not only supplies musical accompaniment to a spot of heavy petting, but epitomises the couple’s determination to structure a world that perfectly enables their sensual and sensory pleasure. In the recent Embrace of the Serpent, the intention of transporting a gramophone deep into the Amazonian jungle is less carnal but no less deeply felt: it supplies the American explorer Evan (Brionne Davis) with a connection to the life, country and The record player has proved a useful symbol for the human urge to enhance, compete with or drown out nature by way of art ancestors he has left behind, and the film with an aspect of its meditation on the meaning of civilisation. The music he plays to his Amazonian guide Karamakate is Haydn’s The Creation, and creation by nature, God and man are all evoked. If the film charges Western civilisation with ruinous expansion, destructive greed and the unthinking imposition of values, it also acknowledges that the same urges to build and influence produce great art. To Karamakate, meanwhile, the music is akin to a dream: no more willed, and no less meaningful. “You must follow it,” he tells Evan. This gramophone also pays implicit tribute to an ancestor of its own: the one used in Fitzcarraldo (1982), a film which Embrace of the pays homage to and offers challenges to throughout. The titular explorer/exploiter/dreamer/madman of Werner Herzog’s film attempts, via his dreams of building an opera house, to impose a narrative of culture and beauty on the colonial project. The impracticality of the project and the fervour that drives it are both prefigured in the scene in which he plays Caruso to a party of potential investors on his gramophone, and clings jealously to it when an associate tries to take it away. Later he will use the machine to blast more Caruso into the jungle, in an effort 8 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 THF PIVF KFY ALI SCREEN APPEARANCES to connect with the indigenous people - and enlist their labour in following his dreams. The use of classical music or opera played on record as shorthand for all that is most perfect in human achievement - creativity at its most impassioned and ambitious, but also its most refined - recurs in Equilibrium (2002), when Beethoven supplies a route to emotions suppressed by a totalitarian regime; and in The Shawshank Redemption (1994), in which the music of Mozart permits a yard full of prisoners to “feel free” when Tim Robbins’s Andy plays it through the prison’s loudspeakers. In Starman (1977), recorded sound has a still more profound function: the alien’s source of information about and contact with the human race is the phonograph record left on board the Voyager 2 space probe. Records symbolise edifying culture rejected by teenage rebels when they’re smashed to bits in Blackboard Jungle but the record player also symbolises the other side of the generation gap, a symbol of heady teenage rejection of adult conformity. For a period, it might have seemed as if A Clockwork Orange (1971) erred in imagining that the cool young hoodlums of the near future would play their “fuzzy warbles” on vinyl, rather than some higher-tech format. But then came the re-emergence of vinyl records as symbols of personal and musical authenticity. The Perks of Being a Wallflower (201^), set in 1991, asserts the self-conscious connoisseurship of its teenage characters by having Sam (Emma Watson) tell her companions, “Things sound so much better on vinyl” - and the film’s marketeers backed her up by releasing its soundtrack in LP form. Almost Famous (2000), Ginger & Rosa (2012) and Whip It(2oif) also link the intensity of adolescent self-discovery with the specific intimacy and satisfaction of connecting needle to groove. In Crazy, Stupid, Love (201 r), it’s specifically sexual: the fact that Jacob (Ryan Gosling) puts on a vinyl record during his date with Hannah (Emma Stone) is one of many indications that this practised seducer knows exactly how to apply delicate treatment to sensitive objects. In The Virgin Suicides (iggf), records stand in for sex when the shy boys use their phone contact with the incarcerated Lisbon girls solely to play songs to them. That’s exactly the sort of calculated, attention-seeking move that would earn the scathing contempt of Enid and Rebecca in Ghost World (2001), a film in which authenticity means constantly staying a step ahead of the “extroverted, obnoxious, pseudo-bohemian losers” who attempt to co-opt aspects of your genuine weirdness into their mainstream world. Enid’s yearning for the truly unorthodox leads her to Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who collects early 20th century blues music on 78 rpm (193 5 is the cut-off point for his interest). Enid herself also sources what seems like a genuine emotional response, distinct from the fakery she diagnoses in almost everyone around her, via the rediscovery of a record from her own childhood. A technology once used to epitomise teenage cool has become a source of refuge from its tyrannies; a system for seduction a solace for one who wants no part of sex at all. © Muhammad Ali’s magnetic presence lives on in his screen outings, showing him floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee By Christina Newiand Few athletes are equipped to play themselves on screen better than movie stars, irrespective of the scale of their achievements. But Muhammad Ali, the great heavyweight champion of the world, was one of those rare few -beautifully formed, with the footwork of a dancer and the linguistic agility of a poet. He was a dream of a prizefighter, and the hope of countless black Americans. No one could outshine him - to paraphrase his famous opponent George Foreman, movie stars, CEOs, and presidents all turned to face him when he entered a room. In memory of one of the bravest Americans of the 20th century, here are five of Muhammad Ali’s best screen appearances -big and small. 2 The Greatest (1977) This Ali biopic, starring the man himself, is a smoothed-over ode to the fighter, cheerfully ignoring the realities of his turbulent romantic life and the finer points of his radical political views. Still, it’s a fine pop culture relic, featuring real footage from Ali’s most famous bouts. The fighter dominated the screen, opposite Ernest Borgnine and Robert Duvall, proving that no one plays him better than himself. 4 When We Were Kings (1996) Leon Cast’s documentary follows the training and media frenzy in the lead-up to the legendary ‘Rumble in the Jungle’ bout in 1974. Ali skips rope and talks trash about his rival George Foreman, belying the challenge of the fight ahead. With easy charm and humour, Ali overwhelmingly wins the support of the people in Zaire. The sheer force of his personality is nearly as electrifying as his rope-a-dope routine. 1 Assorted TV interviews If there was one thing Ali was as good at as boxing, it was talking. That made him a chat show regular, be it with Johnny Carson, Michael Parkinson (above) or Terry Wogan. He argued racial politics with Parkinson, punched a speed bag with Clint Eastwood and recited his famous rhymes on Ed Sullivan. It’s hard to choose a favourite moment, but thanks to YouTube, you probably don’t have to. 3 Muhammad and Larry (1980) For ESPN’s masterful go for go series, Bradley Kaplan and Albert Maysles followed Ali’s fourth world title attempt, against Larry Holmes in 1980. The champ was already suffering early signs of Parkinson’s - and Holmes hated to hit him; he’d grown up admiring Ali. It’s a painful look at the pride and greed behind the scenes of a fight that shouldn’t have happened - and a humbling portrait of a hero being dragged down to earth. 5 I Am Ali (2014) Documentarian Claire Lewins uses rare recorded audio tracks of Ali’s conversations and musings, offering a peek behind the bravado. The film gives a glimpse of the living legend as a husband, father and friend. Featuring intimate interviews with fellow boxers Mike Tyson and George Foreman, and various family members, the film reconstructs his life from a more personal point of view. August 2016 I Sight&Sound | 9 RUSHES INTERVIEW TROUBLE AT HOME An affair to remember: Greta Gerwig and Ethan Hawke in Rebecca Miller’s Maggie’s Plan Rebecca Miller pairs Greta Gerwig with Ethan Hawke in Maggie’s Plan, a light romantic comedy with echoes of classic screwball By Abbey Bender Maggie’s Plan is a brisk romantic comedy centred around the amusingly interlocked love lives of a trio of New Yorkers: young professional Maggie (Greta Gerwig), John (Ethan Hawke), a scholar of ‘ficto-critical anthropology’, and Georgette (Julianne Moore), his haughty wife. Maggie begins the film single and determined to become a mother with the help of a sperm donor, but things quickly get complicated when she and John begin an affair, and ultimately end up married with a daughter. It’s not long, however, before Maggie realises she has made a mistake and concocts a scheme to try to get John and Georgette back together. Rebecca Miller’s fifth film makes fine use of New York settings and Gerwig’s naturally quirky demeanour, and has a lighter tone than her previous work as a director: the disturbing fantasy Angela (i 995); Personal Velocity (2002), a portrait of three troubled young women; The Ballad of Jack and Rose (200^), about a hippie father bringing up his daughter on a remote island; and The Private Lives ofPippa Lee {200(f), a dark comic satire about a fiftysomething woman re-evaluating her life. I sat down with the writer- director to discuss motherhood, nightgowns and the joys of The Philadelphia Story (i 940). Abbey Bender: Were the three leads written with the actors in mind? Maggie is a bit of a transitional role for Greta Gerwig. Rebecca Miller: I didn’t initially write it with any particular actors in mind. I rapidly figured out that Julianne Moore was the perfect person and since I was friends with her I was able to get into her mailbox. Then I started to tailor the character to her. With Greta, the lines didn’t change; it was more about the way she moved, the tone of her. She really developed an idiosyncratic character. I also did some rewriting for Ethan Hawke. I’ve been lucky that I’ve had a lot of time with almost all the lead actors in my movies. AB: I have to ask how the subject of ‘ficto- critical anthropology’ came about. I hadn’t heard of it and, when i googled the phrase, most of what came up was related to your film. RM: That’s funny. My friend Barbara Browning is in the performance studies department of New York University. Some of her work intersects with their work. She read a draft of the screenplay, which didn’t make any specific mention of it and said, “This really reminds me of ficto-critical anthropology,” and I didn’t know what it was. AB: You’ve written the screenplays for all your films. Would you ever consider directing someone else’s script? RM: I never say never in that regard. Maggie’s Plan has been a step, since it was in part an adaptation of somebody else’s book [a not yet published novel by Karen Rinaldi]. It’s hard for me to divorce directing from writing. Part of the reason I haven’t directed somebody else’s screenplay yet is I’m curious about character and I write in a way that’s labour-intensive in terms of defining character. Part of the reason I know how to direct my characters is because I know them so well. I don’t really know how I would work backwards with someone else’s world. I’ve never done it and it’s been a long time now. AB: As I was watching Maggie’s Plan, I was struck by the depiction of motherhood, particularly the scene of Maggie and her daughter in the bathtub. It seemed like a scene that could’ve come from your own experience as a mother. RM: With that scene, I wanted it to be more naked even than a love scene, to show how intimate that mother-child relationship can be. I was thinking of Mary Cassatt’s paintings of children, and very interested in that maternal dynamic. When she’s in the bathtub with her daughter, Maggie is at rest. She doesn’t want to do anything else. She’s completely there. That’s a feeling that I wanted to communicate. And I love bubbles. It took about an hour and a half to get the scene. Greta was so sweet with the girl, very natural. AB: There’s cosiness throughout the film. Before the Jump into motherhood, in the seduction scene with Maggie and John, she’s wearing this long nightgown with lots of buttons. RM: That was totally Greta’s idea. She said, “I I wanted to find a way of shooting things that could be playful but still feel real. It’s real, but not exactly realism Rebecca Miller on set have to have a huge nightgown.” It’s a challenge to find new ways of seductiveness. We’ve sort of done it all now. The costume designer, Malgosia Turzanska, exchanged the buttons so we had these very sexy little round pearl buttons that would open easily. The quality’s very different from flat buttons. The details were important. AB: And Maggie dresses in an old- fashioned, conservative style, while Georgette is like a chic art gallery owner. RM: I wanted Maggie to be a weird combination: she’s a futurist in the way she looks at life, very forward thinking. But she’s also old-fashioned in a lot of ways. She’s an old-fashioned futurist. AB: A lot of reviews have described this film as screwball. What were some of the influences there? There’s also a slight Jane Austen quality with the headstrong young woman trying to set people up. RM: The Philadelphia Story is one of my favourites. I like that blend of something that has a strong structure but is also very human. I wasn’t consciously thinking about Austen, but it’s there: the girl who gets her comeuppance. Her strength is her weakness. A Midsummer Night’s Dream was an influence. I also looked at Eric Rohmer movies. People talk a lot, but they’re very seductive. A lot of long takes, two-shots. I looked at Manhattan and [Agnes Varda’s 1962 film] Cleo from g to 7.1 wanted to find a way of shooting things that could be playful but still feel real. It’s real, but not exactly realism. In the end there’s a sleight of hand, where you aren’t hearing the gears creak every time something happens. AB: How do you see this film fitting in with your other work? There are some similarities with Personal Velocity. RM: Yes, they’re all women at a critical point in their lives. Each movie has a different type of structure. Personal Velocity and The Private Lives ofPippa lee are both looping in time. My other films are more linear. Maggie’s Plan has a certain kind of magic that I hadn’t tried before. It’s more of a fantasy, and seems more broadly appealing than other films I’ve done. © © Maggie’s Plan is released in UK cinemas on 8 July and was reviewed in S&S last month 10 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 OUT NOWON DVD&BLU-RAY amazon.co.uk’ CURZON Mustan^Film.co.uk #Mustan^Film Free Super Saver and Unlimited One-Day Delivery with Amazon Prime are available on eligible orders.

Von Trier cited him as one of the inspirations for the Dogme 95 movement, but a doctrinaire approach to filmmaking couldn’t be further from Muller’s method. He believed above all in respecting what he called “the geography of light”, feeling his way until he found the frame the film needed. He worked wherever possible with available light - the twilight scenes in Wenders’s Kings of the Road (1976) are breathtaking - and took the same approach to interiors. If a room lit by a fluorescent strip turned everything green - as it notably does in his most beautiful film. The American Friend (1977)- Muller insisted on leaving it like that, battling with the labs not to have the colour adjusted. Because he worked so much in Germany and had an umlaut in his name, many assumed Muller was German. But he was in fact Dutch, born in the former Netherlands colony of Curasao in 1940 - his father was in the oil business - and training in the 1960s at the then new Amsterdam Eilm Academy. Eittingly it is the EYE Eilmmuseum in Amsterdam that is currently mounting a magnificent exhibition of his work. Curated by Jaap Guldemond, it assembles the usual showcase objects (scripts, notes, polaroids), then wraps them in a series of glorious screen triptychs - three visually linked scenes from each major film - which demonstrate his approach and those of the directors with whom he collaborated. © ‘Master of Light: Robby Miiller’ runs at the EYE Filmmuseum Amsterdam until 4 September. All quotes, direct or otherwise, in the captions are taken from interviews by Claire Pijman and shown in the exhibition 1. Polaroid photo, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 1985 Muller loved to take Polaroids - when scouting locations, or just whenever something caught his eye, which was often. In 2008, on one of many visits to Muller’s home, director Steve McQueen first saw the wooden boxes containing the prints, about 2,000 of them, and a selection are shown in the exhibition. Wenders incorporated this fascination into Alice in the Cities (1974), at the beginning of which Philip Winter (Rudiger Vogler) is discovered sitting under the boardwalk taking Polaroids of the empty beach. “Why do they never look like what you see?” he asks. That question is answered by Muller’s career, which aimed to ensure the frames of the movie didlook like what you saw. Or, more precisely, what he saw. 2. Kings of the Road Kings of the Road (1976) was the fifth feature Muller shot for Wenders, with a four-month schedule following the border with East Germany. It is the quintessential Wenders road movie, a genre he claims to have invented with Muller while shooting The Goalkeeper’s Fear of the 12 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 5. Penalty (1972), in which a single line in the script became a 12-minute sequence involving a road, a bus, a roadside cafe and a jukebox. Inspired by the Depression era work of American photographer Walker Evans, the film is shot in black and white and has a kind of ethereal, milky glow Reacting to what you find en route is rule one of the road movie. Here Robert (Hanns Zischler) responds to a roadside Christ. The shot also demonstrates the difference between the film’s protagonists - the travelling projection equipment mechanic Robert and hitchhiker Bruno. Bruno, like Muller, stands back and looks; Robert can’t help engaging. 3. Paris, Texas Paris, 7^x^5(1984) brought Wenders and Muller back together after a seven-year break. The film Von Trier cited him as one of the inspirations for Dogme 95 , but a doctrinaire approach couldn’t be further from Muller’s method is a seamless collaboration between Wenders, Muller and composer Ry Cooder. For all his disdain for “camera acrobatics”, the opening helicopter shot (which this frame follows) is the triumphant culmination of a series of similar shots, notably the final one in Alice in the Cities. Here the frame is not just perfectly composed, with the red cap standing out against the vastness of the desert: the cap also humanises Travis (Harry Dean Stanton), who comes from the desert but is not of the desert. It also prepares us for the softer, borderline sentimental, family- reunion focus of the second half of the film. 4. Breaking the Waves Breaking the Waves (1996) and Dancer in the Dark(2ooo) seem, perhaps inevitably with Lars von Trier, to have been created with a certain amount of tension. Dancer usqs a main camera and - allegedly - 100 of the small digital cameras which had just come on the market. On Breaking the Waves, by contrast, the camera is fluid, restless and documentary-like. “Less nice” and “a little more hippy” were among von Trier’s comments. One story sums up the DP’s ‘magic’ touch. In a scene in which Stellan Skarsgard is carried downstairs, Muller wanted to put a blue light in the window. “No blue light,” said von Trier. “You won’t see it,” promised Muller. The blue light was placed; you don’t see it; but the shot has that indefinable feel of something just right - a shot which makes sure we see the frame as Muller does. 5. Dead Man Dead Man (1995) was Muller’s third film with Jarmusch (the final one was 1999’s Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, after which Muller felt uncomfortable with the bigger crews Jarmusch was beginning to use). On Mystery Train (1989), Muller splashed colour around liberally. But Dead Man, like Down by Law (1986), was shot in black and white for a very practical reason: in colour, the dense greenery made it hard to pick out the human characters. There are nonetheless a wide range of greys in every frame. Visually stunning, the film is also (with the possible exception of the ending) very simply shot. “Like Miles Davis,” says Jarmusch, “Robbie doesn’t overplay things.” © August 2016 I Sight&Sound 1 13 ?u«TV j4ccu£emy< Charlie Kaufman imoginxituuv Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkowch <™eA[)APTAnoN ★★★★★ ENIGMAnC, HIGHLY aNEMAHC...

RUSHES ART IMITATING LIFE '4 1 1 'A At the ‘86’ festival in Slavutych, a city built to house evacuees from the Chernobyl disaster, I felt the on- and offscreen worlds start to blur By Mark Cousins In 1 984, in A Nightmare on Elm Street, a killer in the dreams of teenagers passes through the membrane from nightmare into real world In 1985, in Woody Allen’s The Purple Rose of Cairo, movie star Jeff Daniels walks off screen and into the life of an unemployed waitress. In 1986, Chernobyl Unit 4 exploded. The first two address a common fantasy in which a fictive world invades, or enhances, the real world from which it is viewed, but what has a nuclear disaster at the same time got to do with either? Maybe nothing, but I have a hunch that I’d like to use this column to think through. It’s to do with the relationship between a film and the place where it’s seen. Like many kids in the 1940s and 50s, my uncle and his schoolmates would come out of a Hollywood western in the cinema and play cowboys and Indians all the way home. The film events organiser Secret Cinema understands this dam-burst effect the movie world has on the viewer’s world by reverse engineering real experiences from movies like Back to the Future (1985) and 28 Daps Later(2002). The fact that films are not live makes us want them to be. I recently went to ‘86’, a festival of film and urbanism in the Ukrainian city of Slavutych, which was built in a hurry after the Chernobyl disaster to house workers from the plant and other survivors from the area. On the trip we entered the 30km and lokm exclusion zones, stood within 50 metres of Unit 4, which has still to be encased in its completing sarcophagus, and walked around Pripyat, the dormitory city abandoned on the day of the explosion. Each of these three places was among the most atmospheric I’ve ever been to, but what was most striking was the relationship between them and the films shown in Slavutych’s single storey Soviet futurist cinema. The opening film. The Babushkas of Chernobyl, precisely depicted the exclusion zones as both Tarkovsky-like abandoned places with ionising Geiger counts and homesteads. Dachas. Grannies who had lived in the area long before the explosion, in some cases burrowed under fences in order to return to live in their homes, raise chickens and grow vegetables. The Babushkas ofChemobplwas about a place we’d just been, a toxic garden of Eden and a homeland for some of the citizens who were watching it. Its hereness was remarkable. Then there was Atomopolis: Assembling Utopia, an archive film compiled from footage of six Ukrainian nuclear cities like Pripyat. Watching it in Slavutych, the last Atomograd, was again like Secret Cinema because Slavutych, the last and fastest Soviet city ever built, has many of the same ecological, ideological and planning ambitions. In humanitarian gestures, the Baltic Soviet republics each built a district of the city, thus ensuring that it wasn’t uniformly, Sovietly faceless. But pre- Chernobyl utopian ideas are visible everywhere in its planning. There’s a Palace of Children’s Creativity, a School of Arts and a Sports Zone. Shift your thoughts from such optimism to the recent war in Ukraine, or further back to the 1932-33 famine which, in just a few months, killed somewhere between 2.5 and 7.5 million The Babushkas of Chernobyl’ was about a place we’d just been, a toxic garden and a homeland for some of the citizens watching it people. And then shift onwards to another optimism, the spirit of the young people who run the ‘86’ festival, many of whom were issued with a “child affected by Chernobyl” certificate, the ‘Ch’ generation. Their catalogue says, “The pioneers of ashes - this is what the first micro- organisms colonising the places of fires are called... The pioneers of radioactive ashes... are building a new world on Empire ruins.” Those words clicked for me. That’s what we were in and that’s what we were seeing on screen. Empire ruins. In a country such as Ukraine, in which the political pendulum has oscillated wildly, a very young town of architectural successes and failures is showing films which fair- mindedly assess successes and failures in politics, architecture and movies. I didn’t quite understand until I got there why they were so keen on my film I Am Belfast, but then I realised that its robust sadness and hope harmonised with their ideas. A film called Tsvetaeva and Mayakovsky summed all this up. It’s about the two Kiev - or Kyiv to give it its correct name - streets of the title, each named after a poet. We see footage of them being built, again towards the end of the Soviet Union, and brilliant observational imagery of them now, as if they are peep-holes or rock pools. Interweaved there are clips of the 1918 film The Lady and the Hooligan, which stars Mayakovsky himself. This old footage is a cattle prod of cheer in the film, from the time before it all went wrong. Seeing Mayakovsky in the 1910s, and then streets named after him in the 1980s was like seeing Jeff Daniels walk down from the screen in The Purple Rose of Cairo. Woody Allen’s movie was a fantasy that touched on the Depression; the ‘86’ festival in Slavutych, run by Nadia Parfan and Illia Gladshtein, achieved an even greater interpenetration of on and offscreen worlds, moving because of the way it engages with tragedy, yet is focused and original. It’s one of the best examples of live, expanded cinema that I’ve seen. © August 2016 I Sight&Sound 1 15 The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE THE HARD STOP Living on a prayer: George Amponsah’s documentary follows two friends of Mark Duggan, the man whose death at the hands of police sparked the 2011 riots For George Amponsah’s film, the path to the screen led from a shooting in Tottenham via Robert Redford’s ranch in Utah By Charles Gant George Amponsah was making a film about the state of London, refracted through the lives of a couple of young grime artists, when he realised he might be pointing his camera in the wrong direction. It was shortly after the riots of August 2011, and they were walking through some of the most damaged parts of their own south-east London neighbourhood. Amponsah remarked that it was a shame about the damage to homes and property: “They agreed with me, and then they said, ‘Business and property can be replaced, but what about the life of the young man that was killed? That can never be replaced.’” He was surprised that these aspirational young men - “Two lovely boys; I think they wanted to be the next Tinie Tempah kind of thing” - would identify with Mark Duggan, branded a thug and a gang member in the media after being shot dead by police in Tottenham. That was the spark for Amponsah to take his film, which he had envisaged as an observational long-form documentary, in a different direction. Months later, at a party in north London, Amponsah found himself talking to a Tottenham community leader. “I said that I’d love to make a film about the people who were there at the inception of those riots... people who it could be argued had a genuine reason for rioting.” She offered to introduce him to two childhood friends of Duggan. The path to The Hard Stop had begun. He met Marcus Knox-Hooke and Kurtis Henville in June 201 2 in the canteen of Hammersmith Hospital in west London, where Hooke was working while on remand. They were wary: to them, the media were the enemy. Moreover, “When I turned up, I was on a push bike, with my rucksack. I am sure there was a degree of bemusement. ‘Who the hell’s this guy? I thought we were meeting some top film director.’” A 2001 graduate of the documentary directing course at the National Film and Television School, Amponsah went on to make several long-form TV documentaries for strands such as the BBC’s Storyville, supplementing his income with factual shows including Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men. He asked Knox-Hooke to talk him through the day their friend was killed: “He told the story with great lucidity, but as he spoke he started crying.” The filmmaker was struck by his subject’s willingness to show vulnerability, and curious about the man whose death sparked the riots: “How could he be considered such a threat by the police and yet so beloved by his community?” He filmed the pair for five months, investigating their lives and listening to their testimony. In November 2012, when Knox- Hooke was sent to prison for his role in the riots, he continued with Henville, plus members of Duggan’s family - who by now had come to accept and trust him. He was still filming when Knox-Hooke was released from prison in December 2013, and when the verdict of the Duggan inquest - that he had been lawfully killed- was announced in January 2014. Meanwhile, the film was finding its shape: “The initial inclination to do something more current affairs, more panoramic in scope, that might have an inclination to interview a range of people, that slowly started to get bled out,” Amponsah says. “What started to come into focus was the strong suit that we felt we had, which was our access to these two chaps, who grew up with Mark Duggan, and in some way represent him in terms of their personalities and characteristics. I thought, if you can tell something about someone from the company they keep, I guess this investigation is into what kind of character he was, based on what kind of characters are they. Character is revealed through action. Over a period of three years. As soon as we started the film with our characters, and the look on Marcus’s face, and the anger and the sadness, it worked 16 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 THE NUMBERS POLISH FILMS let’s see not only what they say let’s see what they do, and find out what they are about.”” A year into the process, Amponsah and producer partner Dionne Walker successfully applied to both the Sundance Doc Fund and Bertha Foundation for development finance. “It was like the cavalry coming over the hill when Sundance got involved,” says Amponsah, who credits Walker for encouraging him down that path, persuasively arguing that America would be interested in the story. Even more importantly, the film was accepted into the Sundance Edit Lab at Robert Redford’s estate in Utah. “For me, it was a life-changing experience,” says Amponsah, who attended with editor Michael Aaglund (For Those in Peril). “And it was a game-changer in terms of the direction we were taking the film.” Lab participants were encouraged to bring the 1 5 minutes of their film that needed the most work. In the case of The Hard Stop- at this point titled Down bp Law - that was the opening segment. “We couldn’t understand why we couldn’t get it right,” Amponsah says. “To establish the story we felt we needed to start with news archive, explaining the series of events. And then we wanted to say this is a human story about these two chaps who grew up with Mark Duggan on the Broadwater Farm estate, and they loved him, and this is their life, and this is what they go through. Somehow, it just never worked.” At the Sundance lab, Amponsah met two of his documentary heroes: director Ross McElwee (Sherman’s March 1985) and regular Herzog editor Joe Bini. “And what they said was. What kind of film are you making? If you want to make a film about people, about humanity, then start with the human emotions. You can start the context with archive later on.’ And as soon as we started the film with our characters, and the look on Marcus’s face, and the anger and the sadness, it worked.” Bini is rewarded with an executive producer credit. The month before the lab, Amponsah and Walker successfully pitched to the BFI Film Fund at the Sheffield Doc/Fest, securing vital finance; they won BFI completion funding a year later. Editor James Devlin, who had also worked on Amponsah’s The Fighting Spirit (looj), came on board to give the film a restructure and polish, bringing in some of the film’s most cinematic imagery at the start Knox-Hooke and Henville were granted input on the final edit - their concerns were less about their own depiction than about the camera catching people in the background who would not want to be seen. The film appears far from sanitised, revealing two young men who can be quick to anger. Amponsah says, “The degree of trust these chaps have given, and their willingness to show themselves, warts and all, and not try to polish up their act and convey something that wasn’t the case, propelled me to keep working. Their point was. We’re telling the truth about ourselves, and we’re also telling the truth when we say that Mark was not that guy, waving a gun around and being a threat to society, in such a manner as to deserve to be shot and killed by the police. It just doesn’t add up. It’s not right.’” O The Hard Stop is released in UK cinemas on 15 July and is reviewed on page 80 By Charles Gant Opinions differ on which film deserves the honours for biggest-grossing foreign-language title in the UK and Ireland so far this year - leaving aside Bollywood, that is. Most would agree that the Berlin-set Victoria, which has the look and feel of a foreign-language title despite the majority of dialogue being in English, has bragging rights, with £503,000. Purists rejecting Victoria’s claim would award the honours to Son of Saui, which had reached £496,000 at press time. But what about a film that has been invisible to most fans of foreign-language cinema: Polish action title Pitbuii: Nowe Porzadki? This sequel to 2005 Polish hit Pitbuii has earned an astonishing £500,000 in the UK and Ireland, playing exclusively - or almost exclusively - to the Polish audience here. The UK release of the film came about more or less by accident. Phoenix Productions, a Chicago-based company presenting cultural events to the city’s large local Polish American population, decided to move into film distribution in the US, identifying the much anticipated Pitbuii sequel as its first title. It was only when Poles living in the UK started leaving messages on the distributor’s Facebook page, asking about a chance to see it, that Phoenix sought a UK licence on the title, moving quickly to get it into cinemas in mid-April. Explains Phoenix’s Joanna Michalec, “It wasn’t Just 10 or 50 people, it was many, many people who actually did want to see it. We Just thought we would give it a try.’’ The company released it in 32 Odeon cinemas, expanding to 62 in week two as audiences in areas not originally covered by the release clamoured to see it. Phoenix followed up with romantic comedy Planet Single in May - a smash hit in Poland that topped the box office there over Valentine’s Day weekend. This isn’t the first time a distributor has popped up to serve the UK’s Polish population - a couple of companies had success with the likes of Polish Roulette and You Are God POLISH FILMS AT THE UK BOX OFFICE Film Year Gross Ida 2014 £514,319 Pitbull: Nowe Porzadki 2016 £500,306 You Are God 2012 £277,690 Polish Roulette 2012 £239,812 In Darkness 2012 £233,513 Bogowie 2014 £224,610 Planet Single 2016 £194,989* Battle of Warsaw 2011 £185,199 Katyn 2009 £161,831 Walesa: Man of Hope 2013 £140,442 ^gross at press time Pitbull: Nowe Porzadki back in 2012. But Phoenix is clearly in it for the long haul. In the first place, Michalec is relocating from Chicago to Dublin (her partner is Irish) this summer, so she can be closer to the action in the UK and Ireland, where box office for Phoenix’s releases has exceeded the US. And second, it is in the process of finalising deals and release dates on five more films, with the first set for early September. Phoenix has no current plans to take on the likes of Curzon Artificial Eye, which distributed both Ida (2013) and Katyn (2007), in the Polish-language arthouse space. “Our business model is to stay mainstream and respond to the requests and needs that people actually articulate to us,” explains Michalec, who adds that it is too early to say what impact Britain leaving the EU will have on their business. The goal for Phoenix is to release a steady stream of films in the UK and Ireland, with the latter so far delivering a healthy 15 per cent of the combined territory’s box-office gross. “Of course we won’t do it blindly, we’ll have to see what titles there are,” says Michalec. “But if there are suitable titles, then our aim is to release a film every two months.” @ August 2016 I Sight&Sound 1 17 Festivals SHEFFIELD DOC/FEST AND OPEN CITY DOCS FEST THE WORLD AT WAR The humanity on display in the superb Cameraperson offered an antidote to the atrocities, racism and violence seen in other recent docs By Nick Bradshaw “Reconciliation takes time,” notes Padraig O’Malley, after a screening of James Demo’s fascinating portrait of him. The Peacemaker, at Sheffield Doc/Fest O’Malley is a gnarled one-man specialist in conflict resolution who has brought together warring parties in conflict zones from Northern Ireland to South Africa. Tracking him more than five years, the film is framed around the insights and paradoxes gleaned from O’Malley’s own identity as a recovering alcoholic who now tries to bury his demons in work. Footage from 1975 shows him bringing together Belfast enemies in his Boston bar (“By the end, if you had a Valium and split it with someone, they’d be your friend for life”); more recent footage shows gatherings of O’Malley’s roving Forum for Cities in Transition - modelled on the logic of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and based on his understanding that political strife tends to produce addictive behaviours of its own. (One Jerusalem representative likens the Forum to “a support group of Horror Conflicts Anonymous”.) Recovery has to be talked out, different histories deconstructed to find points of shared recognition, O’Malley tells the audience at Sheffield. It’s an inter-generational process, too. Ten days before Britain’s referendum on Europe, he bemoans the narrow vision of the campaigns: no one is looking at Brexit two or three generations ahead. The curtain fell on the referendum the following week, in the middle of London’s Open City Docs Fest, which had presciently opened with Tadhg O’Sullivan’s The Great Wall This visual essay - founded on a reading of Kafka’s short parable The Great Wall of China’ - collates Europe’s many citadels of privilege and exclusion, from Spain’s fortified Moroccan enclaves to Germany and the City of London, to build what O’Sullivan called a “broad brushstrokes” portrait of the continent, as if summarised 200 years hence, as a place run by white men. The film’s momentum and orchestration of words, image and sound were variable, but at its best it was potent and searing. O’Sullivan said that the oppressive architecture of division and occupation in the West Bank had been his inspiration, before he decided to look for the same thing closer to home. Back in Sheffield I’d caught Shimon Dotan’s The Settlers, an account of how, given an inch by an irresolutely liberal establishment, a small band of zealous Jewish colonisers drove a festering wedge into Judea and Samaria. Though the film won a Grand Jury Special Mention, I did not care much for its school history-lesson format; but alongside excellent access to key talking heads, it does pack some chilling shots of Greater Israel’s science-fictional now, from the cool alien architecture of sequestered settlements to the gleaming highways that pipe commuters over dusty valleys from a forgotten century. More artistically ambitious were two re visitations of horror that led with their soundtracks. I was on the Open City jury that gave its main prize to Ongjen Slavonic’s Depth Two: beginning with the dredging from the Danube of a truck full of corpses, the film disinters an atrocity from the Kosovo war of 1998-99 and brings it home to the outskirts of Belgrade. A relay of voices relates the experience of a massacre from both sides, but rather than seeing the speakers we comb the incriminated landscape, a palimpsest of beauty and secret horror. There’s not a human body in sight for 80 minutes, and the revelation in the end credits that the testimonies we’ve heard were all taken from Yugoslav war- crimes tribunal depositions adds to the film’s eerie sense of remembrance from an afterlife. Tatiana Huezo’s less minimalist Tempestad revives the spirit of Kafka in a Mexico that seems to have long lost touch with democratic rectitude. Its two voiceovers, recorded for the film, relate tales of abduction from the inside - a woman ‘disappeared’ by an unaccountable narco-military- prison complex - and out (the lost daughter of a travelling-circus clown). One is in the past tense, one unresolved; we hang out with the clown and her companions, but the main tale is illustrated with plangent, pregnant snapshots of street life Ongjen Slavonic’s ‘Depth Two’ begins with a truck full of corpses before a relay of voices relates the massacre from both sides and an overnight coach journey, images that sinuously slip from literalism to figuration as we wend through an indecipherable country. As a job of imaginative empathy, Tempestad made a deeply moving double bill with Cameraperson, Kirsten Johnson’s Doc/Fest Grand Jury winner. A DP who has shot films from Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit gii (2004) to Laura Poitras’s Citizenfour (201 4), Johnson was surely the filmmaker of the festival this year - as well as the film, she appeared alongside producers Lucy Baxter and Rachel Wexler, and Sophie Mayer at a panel discussion entitled ‘Female Trailblazers: New Ways of Working in Media’, contributing a blistering call to inclusivity: “Look at yourself, your bearing, your friends, your demands, your choices.” Cameraperson starts off like an out-takes scrapbook from Johnson’s travels in war zones and beyond (she’s shot from Bosnia to Yemen and Afghanistan), then adds layer on layer: self-portrait, as we meet her children and late mother; self-reflexive essay, as we consider the rights and wrongs of making and sharing images, and their interplay with our lives and memories; humanist enquiry, as we look, roam and wonder, not least when Johnson revisits old subjects in Foca, Bosnia. Hard to encapsulate, easy to watch and endlessly meaningful, humble, respectful and dignifying, it was just the sort of cinematic embrace that we need right now. © © Reports on more Sheffield Doc/Fest films and its Alternate Realities programme are online at bfi.oig;.uk/sightandsound.

But I proved thatTm no sissy. ” The Ramones: ‘53rd & 3rd’ (from Ramones, released 23 April 1976) Forty years since its American release. Taxi Drivernow seems to mark a pivotal moment in American and indeed Western culture: a warning of the final foreclosure on 70s hedonism and an uncanny prediction of the alien- ated loner - the dark side of the cowboy/vigilante figure - who has since become a terrorist archetype. Previous films had dealt with the vigilante trope - most notably the Dirty Harry series (197 1-) and Michael Winner’s Death Wish (1974) - but these avengers operated from within society, within the structures of marriage or police work. They had something to lose, even if it was just a badge. In contrast, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is complete- ly alienated, if not damned: “Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, ever3rwhere. There’s no escape. 1 am God’s lonely man.” His diatribes against the decadence of New York - scripted, with perfect economy, by Paul Schrader - have become justly famous, but then the alternative on offer is just as bleak: as Wizard (Peter Boyle), the nearest thing he has to a confidant, tells him, “1 envy you your youth. Go on, get laid, get drunk. Do anything. You got no choice, anyway. 1 mean, we’re all fucked.” Living alone in a squalid apartment, Bickle is desperate for connection. But he can only see women as Madonnas or whores. In the film’s most excruciating scene, he takes the fragrant Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to the cinema, but it’s a sex education/soft porn film. She is, quite rightly, re- volted, but he doesn’t get it, at all. After treating the Ma- donna like a whore, he tries to rescue an actual prostitute - Iris (Jodie Foster) - with devastating results. Even here his fantasies fail: the icy cool Dirty Harry figure quick- drawing in the mirror is replaced by a messy, drawn-out gun battle in a tenement hall - a squalid bloodbath.

All the buttons are being pressed: mayhem, murder, sex as the ultimate expression of consumerism. The whole thing has got out of control. Bickle presents him- self as a Yukio Mishima-type figure bent on purification - not only of society but of the self - but he is a reflec- tion of that degraded environment: popping pills, eating junk food, transcending the rhythms of nature in his night-time wanderings. He is all out of kilter, and even his grand finale is botched: he ends up killing, not the presidential candidate Charles Palantine - a plot line that reflects the script’s origin in the story of Arthur Bremer, the would-be assassin of George Wallace - but three no- mark gangsters, hustlers, pimps. Taxi Driver is all of a piece: it’s pretty much perfect, even down to the circular dream ending. What’s interest- ing now is just how the film’s overlay of nihilism (“We’re all fucked”) rings all kinds of different bells: in his bru- tally cropped hair and square shades, Bickle prophesies punk. The fact that he writes down his thoughts - like Bremer and the killers who would follow - gives the film a strong rationale, if not ideology: Bickle’s eventual ram- page is not a random spasm but a course of action that is thought through, that is understandable given the film’s logic, and that was being reflected elsewhere in New York at the time. Between the film’s preparation, script editing, produc- tion and eventual release in 1975-76, the Ramones were busy recording: at first two sets of demos in 1975, then - in February 1976, almost exactly on the film’s US pre- miere - the 14 tracks that appeared on their first album, Ramones. On the monochrome album cover, the group was pictured - by photographer Roberta Bayley - in a graffiti-strewn Bowery back alley looking like delin- quents and hustlers: inside, the record was saturated in a New York sensibility given an explicit location on the key track ‘53rd & 3rd’ - a murder fantasy prompted by sexual shame and guilt. Between them, the Ramones recordings and the Taxi Drz'yer production process encompassed the follow- ing events: the fall of Saigon in April 1975 and thus the ending of the Vietnam War (it’s no accident that Bickle and the protagonist of ‘53rd & 3rd’ are Viet vets); two separate assassination attempts on President Ford in September 1975, by Charles Manson acolyte Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore; and the speech by Ford refusing to allow federal assistance to spare the city of New York from bankruptcy, paraphrased in the immor- tal DazVpATeius headline ‘Ford to City: Drop Dead’. Like several other inner cities that would incubate the new aesthetic - Cleveland, London, Paris - New York was a forgotten town in those days. In late 1975, the future film director Mary Harron was living on 14th Street in Manhattan: “1 remember standing at windows, looking out over the Lower East Side, and feeling that the whole city was infested, and crumbling, but wonderful. There was nihilism in the atmosphere. Longing to die. This sounds pretentious, but part of the feeling of living in New York at that time was this longing for oblivion, that you were about to disintegrate, go the way of the city. Yet that was something almost mystically wonderful.” In late 1975, she interviewed the Ramones for the first issue of P1ZZ7/: magazine: “1 had no idea whether it was good or bad, whether 1 liked it or not, except that it was completely extraordinary. I’d never seen anything like it. 1 couldn’t believe people were doing this. The dumb brat- tiness: ‘Beat on the brat with a baseball bat’ - this at a time when it was, what? King Crimson. It was comic, and yet you’re in a real place, you want to do something real, so you’re in a situation where they could be real, they could be genuinely delinquent. It had an edge to it. And they looked dumb-smart, smart-dumb.” Like Taxi Driver, Ramones had no truck with hippie ‘Ramones’ had no truck with hippie pieties. The record’s lyrics mashed up extremist acronyms with horror references, totalitarian imagery and deep disgust YOU LOOKIN’ AT ME? The Mohawk and shades sported by Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (above right) were a clear precursor of the punk aesthetic, fuelled by the same nihilism that energised the Ramones (above) 22 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 pieties: that era was over. The record’s lyrics mashed up extremist acronyms - the CIA, the SLA (the Symbionese Liberation Army) - with horror references (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), totalitarian imagery (“I’m a shock trooper in a stupor”) and a deep sense of disgust (“Don’t it make you feel sick?”). Both displayed a right-wing po- lemic against liberals and the flotsam of commercialised hippie culture: against hang loose and let it all hang out, coke, suede and waterbeds. That had led to a kind of deca- dence, not just sexual and social, but - almost even worse - that of artistic self-indulgence. Both Taxi Driver doad Ramones were wound up tight: stripped, hostile, confrontational, deliberately shock- ing. Even so, the film made enough of the compromises - in particular the ending that suggested redemption even though it was, to the careful viewer, completely unresolved - that allowed it to become successful: it was number one at the US box office for three weeks in Febru- ary 1 9 7 6, and for two more in late March and early April. In contrast, the Ramones’s debut stalled at number in on the Billboard chart and did not go gold until 2014, yet its impact on British punk was incalculable after their visit in summer 1976: after Ramones, the acceleration. Taxi Driver was released in the UK in September 1976, several months into the British punk scene, already kickstarted by the Sex Pistols - another stripped, con- frontational aesthetic that mirrored hard times. Both New York artefacts now seem extraordinarily prescient: if Ramones changed the sound of rock music, then Taxi Dn'yerpresaged the arrival of the taxi-driving serial killer - David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam, who committed his first murder in July 1976. In May 1977, he sent a letter to the New York Post that read like a Travis Bickle out-take: “Hello from the gutters of N.Y.C. which are filled with dog manure, vomit, stale wine, urine and blood.” Both rehearsed the right-wing politics that would overtake the West by the end of 1980. As Harron says about New York punk, “People needed to say something that negative, there was something liberating about that negativity. It was so hard and cold, and glitter was the end of something, and this was a search-and-destroy aesthetic.” The Ramones themselves included a mixture of political positions - singer Joey Ramone was left wing, guitarist Johnny Ramone a rabid Republican - but their insistence on telling uncomfortable truths led them to an extreme position that was quickly softened in their attempts for mainstream acceptance. If Ramones accelerated the pace of first wave punk, then Taxi Driver gawe it the look that spread through- out the UK and the US from 1979 on. Bickle’s descent is marked by his hair: first, a moderately short 70s cut, then a brutally cropped effort and finally - as he goes out to kill - a full-blown Mohawk/Mohican. The links to the US military and Native Americans were deliberate: this was a ceremonial war cut, meant to mark the warrior and the outcast. Seen in 1976 before its more general take-up, against the flares and deco patterns of the crowd at the Palantine rally, Bickle’s Mohawk looked profoundly weird and separate, if not actually deranged. Lacking even the Ramones’ cartoony black humour. Taxi Driver is even more brutal. It still casts a dark spell. Bickle now appears as the first mainstream cultural ap- pearance of a line that has continued through the Okla- homa bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber, any number of school shooters and beyond. He is a reminder - from almost an adult lifetime ago - that extreme alien- ation can turn outward into a cosmic rage: “Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum... the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is someone who stood up. Here is - you’re dead.” © O ’Punk on Film’, a retrospective of punk cinema curated by Don Letts, will screen at the BFI Southbank, London, throughout August Travis Bickle is completely alienated, if not damned.

It was split-screen footage of her and the band that somebody had shot at the time - somebody said Robert Mapplethorpe was involved with it. It was really affecting. And David Bowie in ’74, ’7 5, on the Station to Station tour, he showed Luis Buhuel’s Un chien andalou [1928]. I’d never seen a surrealist film, 1 mean what kid in the USA, living in a rural area would have access to French surrealist cinema? 1 remember that being completely mind-blowing. But what you started hearing about in New York, in ’78, ’79, was films being made starring people from the community of bands. The first 1 recall was Amos Poe - he had a film called The Foreigner 1 remember seeing a little card-sized ad in the Village Voice. Amos Poe’s The Foreigner, featuring Deborah Harry’. Most film ads would have quotes from magazines saying, “This is brilliant” or “This is a work of art”, his had a quote saying, “Depressing, dot dot dot.” 1 thought, you have to go see this film. 1 couldn’t understand why the music in Amos’s The Blank Generation [1976] was not synchronised to the images, so that film was a little hard to process. But Amos had shot a lot of those bands really early on, around 1 97 5, so he captured a lot of the interior of CBGBs at that time - that wonderful over-blown shot of Richard Hell just staring into the white-hot light of the camera. If you talk to Amos he was just trying to do Godard movies in downtown New York - sometimes it would work, sometime it would be this interminable experience. 1 remember seeing Letters to Dad [19 7 9], by Beth B and Scott B, where they had people like Lydia Lunch and Arto Lindsay, musicians from DNA, Teenage Jesus, the Contortions, reading these letters people had written to Jim Jones, the cult leader. Just face on into the camera lens, reading in a very downtown New York, disaffected, too-cool-for-school way. The premiere of that was at Beth and Scott B’s loft, where 1 also remember seeing Black Box [1979], where Lydia Lunch plays a dominatrix, and thinking, “1 don’t know if these are punk films, but they are punks in these films!” PRE-RAMONE SPECIAL FRIDAY JUNE 17 7,8:15,9:30 a film Poe & Ivan krai talking heads, ramones, heartbreakers, miamis wame count/, tuff darts, blondie, sh . Bands apart: Amos Poe’s The Blank Generation (1976) and The Foreigner (1978) Amos Poe was great at using the Lower East Side for his romantic backdrops. And James Nares when he makes Rome ’78 [1978] - he sees downtown Manhattan as this kingdom of decrepitude and equates it with Rome during Caesar’s era. You see the actors looking askance at placards of dialogue - it’s just so obvious, they’re pretending not to read, but they’re reading. But it’s purposeful, in its amusement, in its attitude that we don’t have time to rehearse. “We don’t have money. Time is money.” It was recognising that and just enjoying that reality for what it was. They were so off-the-cuff, their expediency and energy that came from poverty, and it really did encapsulate the time period. When Bette Gordon’s film Variety [1983] played, that was acclaimed by serious film critics. Jim Hoberman and the Village Voice film critics at the time had to deal with No Wave cinema because it was really happening and really self-promotional, with flyers all round New York. These critics were excited by the fact there were these rogue filmmakers in their backyard. Vivienne Dick and Bette Bette Gordon’s Variety (1983) Gordon certainly, maybe Beth and Scott B, Eric Mitchell, James Nares, must have taken some inspiration from European cinema, art cinema from the Warhol period, Jonas Mekas’s anthology. They must have seen themselves as part of that lineage. I’m not sure if Nick Zedd [author of the 1985 Cinema of Transgression Manifesto] did though, that’s why 1 think he was the first pure New York City punk filmmaker. He really did just come out of being a disaffected alien. He saw some of this work and liked the economics of it, which were nil, but he didn’t really like the storylines, the narratives to him were just banal. He wanted to make something explosive, that had more to do with the Dead Boys than the Contortions. He was completely disregarded by that film community because he didn’t have the same sort of intellectual perversity that they had, he was a bit more thuggish possibly, but he was also his own brilliant person. 1 remember his first films, like Geek Maggot Bingo [1983], being completely terrible. There were always politics between the art world and a lot of the players of No Wave. A lot of people, be it James Chance, Lydia Lunch, Eric Mitchell, coming into this scene, they weren’t really academics. They were intellectual, but they weren’t coming out of university, and they certainly weren’t art school. There was always a bit of a situation between what was considered the schooled, elite, Soho crowd and the rowdier, more street. East Village vibe - there was a bit of a discrepancy, a bit of a war. The Cinema of Transgression films would be shown wherever Nick could get someone to show them. The basement of the Pyramid Club was where you’d see a lot of Richard Kern’s new stuff. 1 remember Nick Zedd 24 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 THURSTON MOORE’S TOP 10 PUNK ROCK FILMS having some film thing at SBC; he had his friend rip open the screen and come running out naked into the audience screaming, and it was both stupid and brilliant at the same time. It was really funny. There was always humour in No Wave. Lydia Lunch, as volatile as she can be in her language, she’s basically a comedian. Her great hero is [stand-up comic] Phyllis Diller, she’s told me this personally. She’ll be extremely serious, but there’s always this underlying acceptance of the absurdity of the situation, seeing the humour in it. That was a strain that went all through No Wave as music, but also as film, it always had this sense of the ridiculous. And that’s part of the lineage of Warhol and the Theatre of the Absurd. Richard Foreman’s plays were really important to a lot of people at the time. There were slasher films and torture films being presented on the sleaze film circuit on 42nd St at the time, and that was like the new pornography: body-count slasher films. They reflected the psychology of the time, where killing and death overtake sleazy sex. For people like Kern and Zedd, those films on the sleaze circuit had as much intrinsic punk value as No Wave cinema. They were also very cheap, and had a certain absurdity that they found really appealing, so they wanted to make art films that reflected that interest. One of the great films is Goodb];e 4.2nd St [1986], where Kem takes his camera and moves along 42nd St, which was trying to go through a change, trying to get rid of these cinemas and turn it into Disneyland. So being aware of this he took his camera and would stop in Nick Zedd had his friend rip open the screen and run naked into the audience, screaming. It was both stupid and brilliant front of one of these scummy cinemas and imagine what was going on on screen. He would stage something like his friend’s head exploding, some savage thing, and 1 thought what a fucking brilliant concept that was. You would go up there with Richard Kem and Casandra Stark and see The Evil Dead [1981] with two other movies, and the majority of the audience would be street people smoking reefer and talking, like they were in some living room somewhere, drinking beer and wine and responding to the film. “Better look out motherfucker! Oh shit!” Some slasher thing would happen. “Oh my god, that’s so fucked, 1 won’t sleep tonight!” That was part of the environment at the time, and it was a little dangerous and weird, but you knew you were there to experience that. That’s all gone now, it’s over. © Thurston Moore was talking to Sam Davies 1 Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains (Lou Adler, 1982) Ex-record label honcho Lou Adler’s gritty take on working class girl punks, led by a young Diane Lane (right), enchanting the world and blowing rival band The Looters (played by former Sex Pistols turned Professionals Steve Jones and Paul Cook, and The Clash’s Paul Simonon) off the stage. 2 Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer (Mike Lerner, Maxim Pozdorovkin, 2013) A great doc on one of the most fascinating punk protest groups in history, where the members bring their noise activism to the fascist altar and get burned with no apologies. 3 Lovedolls Superstar (David Markey,1986) David Markey’s masterpiece, a sequel to the already crazed Desperate Teenage LovedoUs(ig84) but with far more punk mania.

Malcolm McLaren had famously been inspired by the example of the Teddy boys, and no doubt also by a famous 1956 screening of Blackboard Jungle in Elephant and Castle in London, at which the Teddy boys, their energies fired up by the film and its music, tore up the cinema’s seats. McLaren saw that cinema audiences were at once captive and yet potentially explosive if sufficiently primed, and he drew on this powerful live/non-live spectacle situation when planning his own early 70s art school, situationist-like film about people shopping on Oxford Street - a project that ultimately went unfinished. McLaren was a prankster, and despite the ‘year zero’ attitude of the new scene, he also looked back and understood the powerful relationship between music and film, evoking the rock musicals of, among others. The Beatles in his ongoing plans. McLaren always aimed for maximum impact, but he also understood that his grand scheme needed to be captured in a film for it to endure in the long term - not so much in reality but in our minds. Which is, or was, a paradox. The UK punk story is so wrapped up in the mythology of ’76-’/ 7 that its history is both fixed and occluded. Punk US-style is loose and less wedded to a primal moment, but in the UK we got post-punk almost immediately. That made things difficult for McLaren when chasing his Sex Pistols movie dream - events simply outpaced him. Courting potential directors for his film, he spoke first to exploitation favourites Russ Meyer and Pete Walker, and ultimately to Julien Temple - after the Pistols had split up. It was Temple of course who eventually did steer McLaren’s vision of a Sex Pistols movie to the screen in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980). By way of contrast, on the ground in ’76-77, many UK filmmakers seemed intuitively to understand the situation and documented bands, events, friends, fellow punks - and Rastas - whenever they could, sucking up and preserving each moment before it disappeared. Don Letts, then the house DJ at punk venue The Roxy, is most famous for working on super 8 and filming gigs and backstage events, ultimately bringing the footage together in The Punk Rock Movie (1978), but filmmaker Captain Zip also worked in the medium and filmed the daily scene on King’s Road: punks parade up and down the street across several of Zip’s compilation films, shot as vivid home- movie footage in an attempt to capture and make more real this strange phenomenon of which he was active participant. The films can be viewed on BFl Player, and are fascinating for the way they show the 26 I Sight&Sound | August 2016 authentic truth of the early punk look, before the codified fashions and styles took hold. Ever the showman, McLaren also attempted to agitate the latent energy between film and music at an event that has gone down in punk lore. Pushing novelty and raw experience to the fore, he orchestrated a cinema event/music gig crossover at the Screen on the Green cinema in Angel, Islington, in August 1 976. On the bill was Kenneth Anger’s Magick Lantern Circle, before The Clash, the Buzzcocks and then the Sex Pistols took to the stage. It was like something from the UFO Club in the 1960s, which had incubated the likes of Pink Floyd and Soft Machine, but it also further yoked punk - as it was then - to the gay underground, while prefacing the power of image and style that was so integral to punk through the inclusion of Anger’s leather- boys-esque Scorpio Rising (1964), a film about outsiders, bikers, leather and pin-ups. The Screen on the Green event certainly had an impact on young punk and filmmaker-to-be John Maybury, who had been to several early Pistols gigs, notably one in Notre Dame Hall off Leicester Square. Maybury, himself gay, said, “It made me completely enamoured of that kind of moving image, which was non-narrative, abstract, erotic, often highly erotic, dynamic and powerful.” Like Don Letts and Captain Zip, Maybury worked on super 8, moving from frontal Warhol-esque performance films to increasingly elaborate, multi-projection psychodramas. The films are brilliant, and feature notable punk faces - among the earliest. Glamour Is an Asset (igj 8 ) features Jordan, McLaren’s iconic shop assistant at the Sex boutique on King’s Road; then for the essayistic, existential gender-fuck Court of Miracles (i 982) - a film that truly stretches and pushes what super 8 can do - Maybury cast Siouxsie Sioux. Maybury was immersed in the scene and close friends with fellow super 8 champion Derek Jarman, providing sets and costumes for Jarman’s punk feature Jubilee (1978), a movie shot with rough visceral imagination, on the ground, as the chaos unfolded. Vivienne Westwood, another punk architect, was unimpressed with the film, making a T-shirt stating: “1 ain’t insecure enough, nor enough of a voyeur to get off watching a gay boy jerk off through the titillation of his masochistic tremblings.” But though she also attacked it as boring, she subsequently withdrew her criticism and praised both Jarman and Jubilee later in life. With the arrival of fellow travellers Richard Heslop, Holly Warburton, Cerith Wyn Evans and others, something of a scene was created around super 8 as the 80s arrived. And yet with all the hang-ups around the British narrative, can we call this punk? The Anger is an energy: a flyer for the August 1976 all-nighter at Islington’s Screen on the Green moment paralleled similar developments in New York with Richard Kem, Nick Zedd, Lydia Lunch and Beth and Scott B, and also in Berlin, where the likes of Christoph Doering worked alongside German band Einstiirzende Neubauten. Other groupings start to emerge: the ‘Cinema of Transgression’, ‘industrial’. But super 8 itself suited punk. It was direct, immediate and the colours - projected from reversal originals - were punchy. It was also easy to use; cartridges slotted into the camera with ease and no traditional c"
