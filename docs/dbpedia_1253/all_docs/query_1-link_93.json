For reference, the term you're looking for is actually \"transcoding\" and not \"converting\" but regardless, MediaCoder will take just about any source format and transcode it into virtually anything else. And best of all, it's 100% free.\n\nIf you need more of a description than that, let me know. Otherwise, I can't think of a single better program if you're looking to change the format of your audio/video files.\n\n3,582\n\nPosts\n\n17\n\nYears\n\nAge 116\n\nBurbank, CA\n\nSeen Feb 17, 2014\n\nDec 12, 2008\n\n#3\n\nI usually use Visualhub for my video encoding needs, for audio I usually use Audacity. though I rarely ever convert audio since everything I have is usually on a cd or comes in MP3 already.\n\nAyano Katagiri\n\n♥ 陳意涵 - 痞子英雄\n\n8,399\n\nPosts\n\n18\n\nYears\n\nAge 32\n\nNew Zealand\n\nSeen Jul 9, 2010\n\nDec 12, 2008\n\n#4\n\nI rarely convert my media, unless I want to put it on my phone. But I use Xilisoft to convert my files when need be.\n\ndragpyre\n\nThe Brother's Fight For Hell\n\n348\n\nPosts\n\n16\n\nYears\n\nFind me in the Hoenn\n\nSeen Aug 29, 2012\n\nDec 13, 2008\n\n#5\n\nwell for audio conversion i either use koyote soft's free audio converter or samsung phone tools\n\nfor video i use free flv converter although i rarely have to convert video unless i am downloading off youtube, because my computer has a huge codec pack anyway."
