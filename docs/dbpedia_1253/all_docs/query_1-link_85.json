It is worth noting that this is still something of an experimental program and it hasn't even reached version 1.0 in its Windows incarnation, but that doesn't mean it should be overlooked.\n\nAvailable for Mac, Windows and Linux, Handbrake is a great choice for anyone who works on multiple platforms, but is also great for anyone who is dedicated to Windows.\n\nA slight word of warning: the other programs featured in this roundup have very approachable interfaces, but the same cannot really be said of HandBrake. The program is powerful, but utilitarian.\n\nThere are a lot of features that allow for precise control of video conversion, including cropping, advanced filtering and frame rate adjustment, as well as presets for those who just want quick results. Handbrake may take a while to get used to, but the output is worth it.\n\nRead our full review: HandBrake.\n\nDVDVideoSoft is known for its superb free media software that performs exactly as advertised, and Free Video Converter is no exception. Among the best free video converters with an interface that’s clean and uncluttered, it can convert batches of videos with ease.\n\nFree Video Converter has a small set of output options (MP4, AVI, MPEG and MP3 are available, plus an option optimized for iOS devices), but that might be plenty if you're not used to working with video files, and the likes of Handbrake or MediaCoder look excessively complicated.\n\nThere's a choice of quality settings, and you can merge several clips into a single file while they're converted.\n\nIt's a shame that videos converted with Free Video Converter are watermarked. The mark isn't terribly intrusive, but it prevents this otherwise excellent software ranking higher in this list.\n\nRead our full review: Free Video Converter."
