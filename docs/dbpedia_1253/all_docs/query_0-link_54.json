(Audio / Video transcoder)\n\nIn the past, I have been able to create ringtones and edit audio clips with without much of a learning curve. (took me 5 minutes)\n\nI think they have an audio only version of the software.\n\nYou have no choice here. Audacity. It sucks to be honest, but there is no other opensource audio editor I know of.\n\nBut perhaps if you specify what you need this software for, we might suggest something better suited.\n\nThanks Folks,\n\nI am using it to trim and edit some audio from my Church’s services.\n\nwe record them on to DVD, I rip them to MP3 and then edit them to reburn onto a single music/playable CD for our congregation.\n\nIm going to look at the suggestions here.\n\nThanks again."
