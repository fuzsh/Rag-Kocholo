        "text": "For some of our publishers and partners there exists very valid reasons to use their own external media transcoding workflow which excludes the use of the BC3 Server-Side Transcoding functionality.\n\nThose that need to really turn the screw on control of end quality and size you'll need to really dig deep in the more (very) advanced levers available in the encoding process: things like the Profile, Level and Predictor Frames are just some of the things you need to tweak to really squeeze the most from your encoding.\n\nFor 99% of us this is just too much specialised detail to get our heads around. Luckily the Internet is here to save us as a gateway to the real experts out there.\n\nHere's something to try:\n\nDownload Mediacoder, an open sourced GUI tool that allows you to transcode your videos to H.264 (ready for Brightcove upload) free of charge (they have a command line tool for a cost if you like it enough).\n\nSet up Mediacoder following these instructions (baseline taken from the great blog by Fabio Sonatti):\n\n/*********************************************/\n\nStart of Settings\n\nGo to\n\nFile menu --> Revert All Settings\n\nAudio Tab\n\nSelect what makes the most sense for you - remember that audio takes up space and the majority of your audio will be consumed and LIMITED by the quality of PC like speakers so don't feel you need to up much here.\n\nVideo Tab\n\nMode: Bitrate-based\n\nBitrate: 500 kbps (start with this and vary it to see how things improve)\n\nFormat: H.264\n\nContainer: MP4\n\nSource: (Auto-Select)\n\nEncoder: (Auto-Select)\n\nx264 Tab\n\nProfile: High\n\nPredictor Frames: 6\n\nMotion Est. Mode: Normal\n\nMotion Est. Range: 16\n\nLevel: 5.1\n\nB-Frames: 5\n\nSubpel Refinement: 7\n\nClick \"Advanced\" button.\n\nMediaCoder Preferences Window\n\nVideo Encoders\n\n|-----x264\n\nBitstream profile = Baseline (highlight and select \"Baseline\" in the drop down box below)\n\nLevel of bitstream = 51 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nFrames used as predictors in B and P frames = 6 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nMaximum B frames between I and P frames = 5 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nB-frames decision = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nB-frames used as for predicting = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nUse CABAC = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nDirect macroblocks prediction = Auto (highlight and click \"Auto\" in the drop down box below)\n\nUse weighted prediction for B-frames = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nAdaptive spatial transform size = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nFullpixel motion estimation algorithm = Hexagonal (highlight and click \"Hexagonal\" in the drop down box below)\n\nSubpel refinement quality = 7 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nMixed reference frame = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nRate-distortion optimization of B-frames macroblock type = true (click \"Yes\" radio button below)\n\nRefine motion vectors use in bidirectional macroblocks = false (click \"No\" radio button below)\n\nRate-distortion optimal quantization = Enable during all mode decisions (highlight and click \"Enable during all mode decisions\" in the box below)\n\nPerforms early skip detection in P-frames = false (click \"No\" radio button below)\n\nThreads (0 for auto) = 6 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nThe only settings left under MediaCoder Preferences window is Alpha and Beta deblocking.\n\nPlease read: How To Use Mpeg4 AVC Deblocking Effectively (Small FAQ)\n\nDeciding what values to use is a personal choice. In this example, I will be using more detailed look and occasional block setting of -2:-1.\n\nAlpha parameter of deblocking filter = -2 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nBeta parameter of deblocking filter = -1 (enter value in the box below and click apply button)\n\nClick \"X\" button in the upper right hand corner of MediaCoder Preferences window.\n\nMuxer Tab\n\n\"Enable\" radio button\n\nMultiplexer: MP4Box\n\nEnd of Settings\n\n/*********************************************/\n\nNow run your videos through and see the output. REMEMBER - the better your source file the better ANY transcode output will be.\n\nMy test follows - I used a 1080p hi-res WMV file as an input\n\nStandard Encode at 500K (uses Dynamic Delivery so you might get a higher rendition):\n\nCustom Encode using Mediacoder and above settings at 500Kbps\n\nYou should see much less blockiness at quality degredation during fast moving, complex scenes (look at the waves in transition)\n\nAnd the best bit? This file is ready for upload for immediate play back by any Brightcove player as well as it's ready for playback (thanks to the Baseline setting) on the iPhone - with a size that fits!\n\nNot too bad."
