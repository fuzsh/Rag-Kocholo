        "text": "In the world of media file types, there are numerous video, audio and graphical formats to choose from. The problem is that most software media players and media devices are not able to play all these formats and in this situation you will need to install a conversion software, which can produce just the right file format for a certain player. There are numerous converters on the market which pretend to offer support for a wide range of media formats, but few of them are as complex and fully-featured as MediaCoder.\n\nThis Windows utility allows you to convert almost any video, audio or image file from a format to another, using various quality settings. After the installation is complete and the program is launched, the user will be presented with a very complex interface, in which he will first need to import the desired media file. MediaCoder also allows importing several files at the same time and even opening complete media folders.\n\nWhen clicking on an imported media file, the program will display complete information regarding it, like the audio and video quality, resolution, format and so on. By browsing through the tabs displayed in the lower part of the interface, the user will be able to customize the quality of the final video file. There are numerous settings and options to choose from.\n\nBesides converting various media files from a format to another, MediaCoder can also capture the sound or video feed from various capturing devices, like web cameras or TV tuners, and convert them to media file formats in real-time."
