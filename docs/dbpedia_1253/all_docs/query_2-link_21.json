When I encounter such phone issues I just drop the software, be it freeware. Maybe I'm wrong to do so, but no time to spare for testing.\n\n\"3\" score is plain neutral. I was bound for a \"2\".

Tried many of the earlier betas. Just too buggy, and has too many options. For those who need a simple and fast transcoder, use Format Factory. Works great on Win7x64. Has none of these hassles.

And it works very well. However, the user interface is a complete disaster. The most baffling thing is the inclusion of certain XUL-based user interface elements which are slow and painful to use, and worst of all, completely unnecessary. I also don't need a Firefox page to pop up every time you want to tell me something, thank you. There also doesn't seem to be any way to disable automatic updates permanently. All of this brings down the rating to 2 stars.\n\ntrents reviewed v0.7.5.4742 on Nov 25, 2010\n\nHi,\n\nThis is great and all things that been shared with us here is more helpful to everyone here..\n\nThanks for the post...\\\n\nrhylos reviewed v0.7.5.4742 on Oct 8, 2010\n\nThe worst software ever. This group seems to be more concerned with web based ad-ware than actual working software. Their CUDA imp is a joke and out of the box the SW would only transcode around 5 mins worth. Waist of time. They have many builds and on one of them installed in english but the gui defaulted to something asian!\n\nJuhandra reviewed v0.7.5.4742 on Oct 8, 2010\n\nThe biggest crap of all crap.\n\nGo to http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=78\n\nfor some good media enconders/recoders.\n\ntranglos reviewed v0.7.5.4740 on Sep 17, 2010\n\nI am a complete novice when it comes to home video processing, and MediaCoder was recommended to me by someone who knows the ins and outs but uses only free/OS software. So I suppose there is a capable engine inside the horror that's called MediaCoder - maybe there is, but I never got to experience it.\n\nI don't care what it is supposedly capable of doing and how well it does that, because the application is unusable. Whoever came up with the idea of configuring each run via a browser must really despise users. I mean, this has been deliberately designed to annoy and frustrate.\n\nAnd once you put yourself through the idiotic inconvenience, it crashes. What a waste of time.\n\njouune reviewed v0.7.5.4740 on Sep 16, 2010\n\njust installed mediacoder\n\ncan't start it as redirected to:\n\nhttp://www.mediacoderhq....?p=19820&build=4740\n\nwhich isn't stable\n\nwaiting for google analytics ????\n\nwhat has this to do with mediacoder!!\n\nDudeBoyz reviewed v0.7.5.4710 on Aug 10, 2010\n\nCertainly not efficient, and now that it is closed source, it's not even worth considering, especially since it really isn't all that good at what it professes to do. Better alternatives elsewhere.\n\nnugro reviewed v0.7.3.4685 on Jun 29, 2010\n\nCrash like there's no tomorrow, It's good when it work, otherwise use Megui or other simpler conversion tool if you don't feel like learning.\n\nMike89 reviewed v0.7.3.4682 on Jun 24, 2010\n\nNot matter how good or bad this program is, it is still plagued by accusations of illegal licensing issues since it went closed source a few years ago. The author has made some attempts to correct these issues but some still remain and the author is steadfast in violating them. He used to talk about these issues in blogs and forums but has quit doing so after repeated attempt by the community to get him to correct the non-complaint licensing issues. This program is not well regarded in the open source community at all. Since this is a Chinese made program, it can remain non-compliant and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Probably why it's remained the way it is.\n\nDrTeeth reviewed v0.7.3.4682 on Jun 22, 2010\n\nBrilliant software. Most failures are down to the user...and I include myself in that remark.\n\nDrT\n\nboaz reviewed v0.7.3.4660 on May 25, 2010\n\nCan convert many formats of audio & video. It works ok. Too bad it's been in beta version so long, v.07.x.x.x.\n\nRMerlin reviewed v0.7.3.4620 on Apr 13, 2010\n\nHas the potential of being a very good GUI for advanced media transcoding... if it was less unstable. Every time I try a new version, I seem to run into new ways to make it crash, generate error messages, and so on. Could use more testing by the developer.\n\nDJHasis reviewed v0.7.3.4605 on Feb 23, 2010\n\nGood videoconverter, can convert many types of videos or sounds, includes lots of codecs so the user doesn't need them seperatly.\n\nSadly the gui good be a bit more userfriendly for people who don't know much technical information.\n\nThe homesite-address needs to be corrected, it has been www.mediacoderhq.com from last december.\n\nron_marz reviewed v0.7.3.4605 on Feb 23, 2010\n\nThe hater squad is still monitoring this page and flooding it with low scores whenever a new version is posted, I see.\n\nFor advanced users who know what they're doing -- or others willing to take a few minutes to understand the interface -- this is a five-star collection of media encoding tools.\n\nwatkino reviewed v0.7.2.4580 on Feb 3, 2010\n\nHow could anyone in their right mind score this software higher than a \"1 Star.\" I've attempted to use this title for years as a professional digital media technologist who writes reviews for video production tech sites. I just installed the most recent 64 bit version and, as predicted, the program can scarcely complete the most basic conversion tasks without generating numerous errors. Maybe users who perform only rudimentary file conversions don't encounter how truly buggy the program is. Attempting any out of the ordinary file conversion process with this program is not recommended. My suggestion: use Super Media Encoder or Any Video Converter. Both programs provide amazing quality encodes and handle any task you throw at them.\n\nVideoTek reviewed v0.7.2.4580 on Jan 2, 2010\n\nthis tool is awesome. After using autogk, super,vidomi , I prefer mediaCoder, much simpler and powerful. Jcookes, you have to enhance your Video codec knowledge before jumping in to any video tool. My piece of advise is be precise when criticizing anything. All in all I love the MediaCoder.

Recommendations are OPT-IN (you won't end up with software you don't want simply by clicking 'Next' or 'Install').\n\nRegarding privacy, we DO NOT collect ANY personally identifiable information (aka PII, see http://en.wikipedia.org/...dentifiable_information). We DO NOT store IP addresses either. We are updating our EULA and privacy policy to more accurately explain this.\n\nOpenCandy does not get \"installed\" on your computer. Our plug-in ONLY runs during installation or (optionally) un-install of the publisher's installer that integrated it. In addition to enabling publishers to make recommendations, it also allows us to provide developers with ANONYMOUS AGGREGATE statistics like how many times their software is installed (along with ANONYMOUS stats like COUNTRY, Operating System, Service Pack level, and Language) and (optionally) un-installed. We believe this information can help developers notice, for instance, if an update to their program is resulting in a statistically higher rate of un-install. With that information they will be able to reach out to their community and say “Hey, the recent release of our software is resulting in 30% more un-installs. If anyone has any ideas why, please leave a comment and let us know what you think is causing this.\" If you want to delete the OpenCandy plug-in (which is located within the program directory of the software that included it), you may (obviously) delete it at any time OR it will be removed automatically if you un-install the publisher's software.\n\nIf you would like more information about what we do or how we do it, please feel free to contact us via http://www.opencandy.com/contact/\n\nBTW, in order to be fair since I'm responding to a comment, I rated MediaCoder a three (3).

So I checked out the FAQ to see why and this is what it says:\n\nCan MediaCoder function without Firefox?\n\nMediaCoder does not rely on Firefox to perform transcoding (that doesn't make any sense). However some extended user interfaces (developed with XUL) depend on Firefox (more accurate, its Gecko engine). If you don't need those UI, you don't have to install Firefox. Neither do you need to be online to use MediaCoder.\n\n/FAQ\n\nSo I guess I don't use those features that rely on it.

My browser is already Firefox, so I never get whatever \"Firefox not found\"-type errors might come up.

Theres no reason to see all the audio-option tabs on the right side once you've selected from the LEFT side what audio format you'll be using. The UI should reflect that.\n\nFor instance once you select \"h.264\" as your encoder of choice, ONLY options for h.264 should be available on the right side.

Perhaps this is due to it being in beta phase.\n\nProspero424 reviewed v0.6.0.3900 on Oct 5, 2007\n\nWell, the word isn't really in major dictionaries, so it's a silly argument to begin with. But I'd say that \"transcode\", in this context, means to convert any given piece of media from one binary format to another. Some say you should simply use \"convert\", but that's an even more general term than \"transcode\".\n\n\"Re-coding\" could cause some to infer that an identical process is being repeated, which might cause confusion.\n\nWikipedia defines \"transcoding\" as: \"...the direct digital-to-digital conversion from one (usually lossy) codec to another.\"\n\nSometimes the goal is to convert in order to achieve platform compatibility. Sometimes the goal is to compress the same media to a smaller format. The term \"transcode\" accurately encompasses both of these. I think it's perfectly valid, and so do the guys who make GX Transcoder, obviously. Ahead, the makers of Nero, also use the term to describe the function performed by their \"Nero Vision\" component. I'm sure there are plenty of other mainstream examples.\n\nAnyway, it's good to see the developers keeping the various packages and components up to date. That's actually one of the biggest problems with many programs like this.\n\nThe interface is slick, the options are plentiful, and it has the option to pause during the transcoding process, which many alternatives lack. My only complaint is the relative lack of feedback during processing; I'll occasionally have a process fail and not know why.\n\nOtherwise, it's good stuff, but I've simply found myself using AutoMKV for video most of the time instead.\n\nHelgeFossmo reviewed v0.6.0.3875 on Sep 20, 2007\n\nI think the word \"transcoding\" is used with little tought here.\n\nWhen you \"transcode\" something, that usually means you are converting from one input format to one output format on the fly. This may be the task of a streaming video server (ffserver, darwin, helix etc).\n\nI would rather use the word \"re-encoding\" or \"recoding\" to describe what this software does.\n\ndrumcat reviewed v0.6.0.3858 on Aug 27, 2007\n\nIf you're going to be converting audio, Foobar2000 is the way to go.

I've used WMV, MKV, AVI, .TS, MPEG, etc. and it hasn't balked at anything I've thrown at it.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit simpler for video transcoding/compression, try out AutoGK or, even better, AutoMKV.\n\nh2so4 reviewed v0.6.0.3792 on Jul 4, 2007\n\nThis is a fantastic application; superior in usability than GXTranscoder (e.g. it actually does the job).\n\nIn my situation I wanted to transcode MP3s to AAC files for my mobile phone. The memory card on my phone nearly had its small 2GB capacity taken up by MP3s, and I wanted more space but not to lose the files. I also didn't want the hassle of having to remove the files from the m2 memory stick first. Choosing the files was simplicity itself, just choosing the drive and directory where the MP3s are stored and choosing folder recursion finds all the files. Picking the format to transcode to also was simple. In the configurations is an option to delete the original file after its transcoded, so this I enabled and then I started the operation. I was prompted for confirmation that I was aware the original would be deleted, which of course was perfect. I now have 1.5GB of space free for more music.\n\nyokozuna reviewed v0.6.0.3780 on Jun 26, 2007\n\n@shicaca\n\nMaybe you should try something simpler in use.

Great for Windows Media Center recorded TV like Turner Classic Movies etc.. I tried Super. Stick with it if you like it.\n\nphotonboy reviewed v0.6.0.3780 on Jun 23, 2007\n\nIgnore my previous review.\n\nI was mainly using this to transcode MKV and OGM to AVI (for Divx DVD player). It was working fairly well.\n\nNow:\n\n1) I can't get the same files to work.\n\n2) When it seems to work it'll create a file with a few glitches that quits about 1/3rd the way through.\n\nAfter trying many different files, I gave up. I tried many different videos encoded by many different people and even used many combos of audio (I'm just copying the divx or xvid video). I used MP3 as VBR and audio, and other audio. I even tried recoding the MKV with another program. The video played great still before encoding, but encoding was a mess.\n\n*I just want to encode MKV and OGM as BATCH like I've done in the past with this program but it needs a lot of work.\n\n**Is it using codecs from my computer? Could that be the problem? Is it using my new ffdshow when it previously used Divx? (I wish the Divx Community would provide MKV and OGM support for transcoding.)\n\nAnother point:\n\nThis program gives a \"summary\" which is incorrect often. For example, if I choose \"copy\" for Video and the original video is Xvid it shows whatever video is currently selected (even though it should not be encoding any video). So to get it to show Xvid (what I'm just copying, not encoding) I need to uncheck \"copy\", select \"Xvid\" then check \"copy\" again. Now my choices are greyed-out but the Summary is correct.\n\nAlso, this program lets you choose any audio/video combination even though it's not really possible to get certain combos to work.\n\nI'm going back to Riverpast Video Cleaner Pro and see if it'll work better.\n\nalphatrigon reviewed v0.6.0.3690 on May 14, 2007\n\nfigure I'd leave a review since I use this fairly regularly.

(I'd like to see an automatic PREVIEW of the video without having to start. Say 2 minutes.)\n\nI can't find anything (free or purchased) that compares. Riverpast Video Cleaner Pro can't do what this can and had constant problems.\n\nI use this primarily to convert MKV (usually divx/xvid + vorbis + subtitles) to AVI format for my standalone player.\n\nWhat's with the low marks?\n\nThere's a small learning curve, but I figured it out and converted my first file in under ten minutes and now I think the Interface is very good. Dumbing down the Interface would actually make it LESS useful for people that take the time to learn how to use it.\n\nAWESOME PROGRAM.\n\n*Note:\n\n1) when convertint containers like MKV to AVI if the video is compatible (Xvid or Divx) with your standalone Divx DVD player then use \"copy\" so you don't convert the video\n\n2) when converting audio, not all outputs work. For example, CBR worked for me when VBR caused audio problems.\n\n3) If you have problems with audio conversion sometimes converting to PCM (copy video only) then convert from PCM to your new audio format (copy video only). Though once I started using \"Lame MP3, CBR\" I had no problems for my purposes.\n\n4) BATCH MODE works awesome. Simply highlight and open all the media you want converted.\n\n5) If you have MKV files, you may find MKVtoolnix very useful especially if the audio track is not the first track.\n\nSIMPLY THE BEST.\n\nfatray reviewed v0.6.0-pre5a on Mar 11, 2007\n\nTried to convert a WMV for my cell phone's 3GPP, also tried an MP4 to 3GPP. \"Multiplexer failed to work\" error message ever time I tried.\n\nberserkchaos reviewed v0.6.0-pre4 on Mar 4, 2007\n\nexellent piece of software.\n\nzapatero reviewed v0.6.0-pre4 on Feb 28, 2007\n\nI tried it - couldn't find out how to set the output format.

Not user-friendly in my book.\n\nAnother thing is the menus containing the different format the user can choose from. I would certainly filter the options based on the choice the user make, instead of making everything available and simply make a popup error saying: something doesn't fit right, and it's probably your fault, which it basicly states.\n\nYou also have to choose the source format, like PCM for the audio in my case - I would think that a program that can transcode or convert would know what the source is to be able to do it's job, please pre-select the autodected format so the user doesn't have to. And when choosing to encode into e.g. mpeg2, give the user a choice between mpeg encoders, not ac3, flac, divx, xvid and what not.\n\nI still keep an eye out for the program because it does have potential, I bet making mp3's from your wave files can be done safely enough, though I haven't tried.\n\nbrusco reviewed v0.5.1-pre7 on Sep 14, 2006\n\n@y0himba\n\nI checked his forum and saw nothing about google adsense or adware or anything like that.

I compared it with MediaCoder 0.39 and I see a lot of improvements, e.g. when you try to make a video with x.264 + Ogg Vorbis in AVI or MKV containers (I prefer MKV or OGM rather than obsolete AVI) The old version accepted it but the result movie was without sound, what was frustrating if you had to wait 3 hours for the encoded movie. The newer version simply does not allow for the combination.\n\nHowever, this combination is possible: I use freeware FairUse 2.5 Light Edition http://www.fairusewizard.com (H.264, Ogg Vorbis, both OGM and MKV are supported) to make such movies. I know that mp3 is a widely used standard, nonetheless, the quality of mp3 is at best so-so (@ reasonable bitrate, I mean below 192 kbps). Ogg Vorbis (especially Ogg Vorbis!) or AAC codecs are much better.\n\nAnyway, the program is stable and does what it says. I also see that the author works a lot to make it better. 4.5/5\n\nPS The program could run a bit faster. It is around 20% slower than Xmpeg with apropriate codecs. I do not know much about video codec optimisations, but in case of Ogg Vorbis Lancer http://homepage3.nifty.com/blacksword optimised codecs are worth consideration (in fact they are AoTuV codecs with SSE/SSE2/SSE3 support).

Although, I wish that they would post the changelog here on Betanews.\n\ny0himba reviewed v0.5.0 pre8 on Jul 6, 2006\n\nStanley (the author) has taken my suggestions. There is now an option to not display the Google Adsense ads that were displayed in the setup. If you choose this option, it instead loads a Paypal donate button. I still think if the option to diaply ads is there, that this should not be on Sourceforge, and should be listed as Adware, but this is certainly a step in the right way. Chekc this forum thread:\n\nhttp://mediacoder.source...viewtopic.php?p=988#988\n\npyridox reviewed v0.5.0 pre8 on Jul 6, 2006\n\nToo bad it's adware now. They should be removed from the \"Sourceforge\" site, which is primarily for open source programs. You know I wouldn't have minded an option for Yahoo Tool Bar or similar, like Crap Cleaner is doing, I could have dealt with that.\n\nJEdwardP reviewed v0.5.0 pre8 on Jul 6, 2006\n\nIt's not the adware principle I object to, it's the sneaky, license-violating implementation that is now manifested here.\n\nUPDATE: Due to the author's responsiveness to the adware issue, and his willingness to accept suggestions, I'm raising my rating from 1 to 3.\n\nThis project does have impressive potential, which can be reached if the author continues on the straight and narrow path.\n\nVelocition reviewed v0.5.0 pre7 on Jul 5, 2006\n\nLicense: Adware\n\nThis is not acceptable.\n\ny0himba reviewed v0.5.0 pre7 on Jul 4, 2006\n\nMediacoder now displays advertisments in it's config interface, meaning it is no longer free. It also loads data from off site, connecting in direct contrary to the pop up notice that appears when first running Mediacoder, and the GPL, and public domain licenses. It uses a hidden IFRAME to load it's adverts in the bottom right of the config interface. It loads:\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net/ads/pref.htm\n\nand the code for this is in installdirectory/htdocs/prefs/index.htm and also value.htm\n\nsome guy reviewed v0.5.0 pre6 on Jul 1, 2006\n\nnice more towards the advanced user.

Good work!\n\najua reviewed v0.3.9 (06/07/06) on Jun 17, 2006\n\nIt has lots and lots of bug on every release. apart from that it is nice software. but for serious video encoding i recommend StaxRip wich is also free and offers much better control over encoding. its easy to use and so far i havent experienced any bugs.\n\nlama_songchen reviewed v0.3.9 (06/07/06) on Jun 10, 2006\n\nThis must be the buggiest piece of software I have ever seen. What a nightmare!\n\ndigitalking reviewed v0.3.9 (06/07/06) on Jun 8, 2006\n\nThis rocks!!!!!!!!!\n\nKramy reviewed v0.3.9 (06/07/06) on Jun 7, 2006\n\nI like how this works even on severely gutted systems. It doesn't seem to depend on much(anything?). Heck, it'd probably even work with MicroWinX(windows with most system files removed).\n\nWhy was OS Support changed to XP? It works fine on Windows 2000 as well.\n\nmjm01010101 reviewed v0.3.9 (06/07/06) on Jun 7, 2006\n\nCrashed when I navigated the menu system.\n\nInterface doesn't work on WIndows systems with large system fonts (120 dpi)\n\nLooks promising so I'll stick with this one, but it's not ready.\n\nmatt2971 reviewed v0.3.9 (05/29/06) on May 31, 2006\n\nWow, I can't believe I've not run into this gem before!\n\nI'm a VirtualDub and VirtualDubMod user, and will continue to use them to edit video, but this thing is fantastic for converting and also joining video files.\n\nPlaying with video files from many sources is probably one of the most complicated and frustrating things your average savvy PC user will ever do - the amount of formats and settings and restrictions out there is beyond ridiculous - but this makes it as easy as possible - at least compared to all the other software I've tried.\n\nI'm not sure where this \"only converts to three different codecs\" comes from - I see a choice of XVID, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4 (DIVX4/5), DIVX3, WMV7, WMV8, and a whole load of others. Plust the ability to convert and join Quicktime and Realplayer files is... well unique unless I'm missing something?\n\nGreat work!\n\npyridox reviewed v0.3.9 (05/29/06) on May 30, 2006\n\nNice audio/video transcoder. I have been using it for a while now, for both audio & video files.\n\n\"ModderXManiac\" we know you like VirtualDub, and it is a nice program as well. However, virtual dub's main forte' is capturing & editing. MediaCoder is simply a transcoder (convertor) for Audio & Video files.\n\nKramy reviewed v0.3.8 (05/01/06) on May 1, 2006\n\nModderXManiac: I gutted too much out of my system for VirtualDub to work. (Oops!)\n\nI love programs that always function properly without depending on windows components. I haven't gotten a chance to test this latest version yet, but the chances of it being any worse than older versions quality-wise is very slim.\n\nModderXManiac reviewed v0.3.8 (05/01/06) on May 1, 2006\n\nI like how it has more codec support than VirtualDub on the reading side, but on the conversion side it only converts to 3 different codecs, whereas V-Dub has almost 20.\n\nAlso, the conversion is slower, more cudos to V-Dub. Last, I like how V-Dub previews each frame, give more details, and all out more functions.\n\nThe only thing slightly better in MediaCoder is the interface, which I could give a hoot less about.\n\nCrypton reviewed v0.3.7 (04/16/06) on Apr 23, 2006\n\nGreat program, link seems to not be working for me, if anyone else has the same issue.\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net/dlfull.htm\n\nthe artist reviewed v0.3.7 (04/16/06) on Apr 19, 2006\n\ncan it convert from MOV to any other?\n\njacjan reviewed v0.3.7 (04/16/06) on Apr 17, 2006\n\nWorks for the most part, but it doesn`t support the only format I actually want, dvr-ms.\n\nAdd support for this, and I`m a happy camper :)\n\nDeKoquonut reviewed v0.3.7 (04/16/06) on Apr 16, 2006\n\nLove this program so much I made a donation - and I don't usualy pay for the stuff you are supposed to pay for!

Unlike every other encoder I've tried, this one just came natural! It's very intuitive to anyone that can usually open up a program and figure out how to run it.\n\nI'm amazed at its speed! It encoded a 560x320 mp2 1.5h video in just under 70 minutes(3 passes), and my computer isn't even that new! There are not many blocks either, so the quality is *ok* - suprising with 800kbit video.\n\n(Works on Win2k)\n\nckjnigel reviewed v0.3.6 on Feb 24, 2006\n\nI've been using this for two months and what I like best is how very intuitive it is. It is VERY fast. Author Stanley Huang hangs out in forums at hydrogenaudio.org as \"optimus\" and he responds to questions, suggestions and bug reports."
