        "text": "MediaCoder iPhone Edition is a file converter for Windows. I would say this is the mother of all iPhone converters, both by its looks and the way it works. The application's GUI is the most striking of all the features this application has to offer. It is divided into 3 parts. The Main Window, the Device Window and the Statistics Window. The main window houses all the conversion options. There, you will be able to add files into the interface and select how you want to convert them. MediaCoder supports all most popular video formats for input. And it can convert video to both H.264 and MP4. At the bottom of the application, you will see the Device Window. It is actually a picture of the iPhone with a vdeo window built-in. You can preview the videos you convert there. At the right of the GUI, there is the statistics window. As it sounds, there is nothing you can do there. Its sole purpose is to inform you of how things are going. The application features a top-notch conversion engine, which will convert your files really fast. If I had an iPhone, this is what I would be using."
