        "text": "Can I rotate videos with MediaCoder?\n\nYes you can! If your display does not support the Native Portrait feature (see supported features and media types article here for further information), you must rotate your content before using it in a Playlist or on your Player.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nWhen working through your encoding settings, if you wish to rotate the video, then just apply the settings above in accordance with the other settings you have made.\n\nWhat are the recommended encoding settings for each Player?\n\nSamsung Tizen and Smart Signage Platform (Full HD)\n\nThere are no specific encoding settings for Samsung devices. However, please note that Tizen models will not support videos with Frames per Second (FPS) over 30. If your videos are using even 30.01 frames per second, then this video will fail to play. We recommend always keeping your frames per second below 30 and using a rounded number with no decimal places. This is recommended as a good encoding practice directly from Samsung.\n\nSamsung Tizen (4K)\n\nThis is the official support table for 4K video on Tizen from Samsung:\n\nWe have seen playback issues with certain content files for 4K playback with Samsung Tizen, so our encoding recommendation is as follows:\n\nVideo Bitrate: 8000kbps (8mbps)\n\nRate Mode: Average Bitrate\n\nVideo format: H.264\n\nResolution: 3840x2160 or 2160x3840\n\nAudio format: LC-AAC with Target Quality: 25\n\nPicture: Frame Rate: 24 (24.000)\n\nPicture: Color Space: I420\n\nPlease Note\n\nIf you are displaying multiple videos on your Signagelive Player, we highly recommend you ensure that the encoding of all videos matches across all videos. This will ensure that video transitions are seamless. Mixing and matching resolutions and frame rates is not advised.\n\nLG webOS\n\nWhen publishing content to the LG webOS Media Players, LG recommends that all of your video encoding is exactly the same across all video files for best performance.\n\nBrightsign\n\nPlease check the official recommended settings for Brightsign players on the Brightsign Support page.\n\nIAdea 4K Players [XMP-7300]\n\nIf you are encoding for an IAdea 4K Player then we have found the following encoding settings to work best when deploying full screen landscape content, if you are encoding for a portrait or different resolution screen, you can amend the resolution accordingly:\n\nIAdea Players [MBR1100, XMP-6200/6250/6400, XDS-1060/1062/1068/1078 signboard]\n\nIf you are encoding for any of those IAdea models listed above, then we have found the following encoding settings to work best when deploying full screen landscape content, if you are encoding for a portrait or different resolution screen, you can amend the resolution accordingly:\n\nRate Mode: Average Bitrate\n\nVideo format: H.264\n\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\n\nAudio format: AAC\n\nAudio Bitrate: 192k"
