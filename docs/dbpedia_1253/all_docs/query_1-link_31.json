        "text": "MediaCoder Audio Edition is an audio file converter. It is a free application that allows you to convert all your audio files into any format you want. Most popular formats are supported, and chances are that your desired format is among the supported ones. The main difference between MediaCoder and other file converters is that the former includes all the codecs that you need and is not dependent on system codecs. Thus, it is more reliable because it can be tested more thoroughly. Also, the application should behave the same way on most computers.\n\nMediaCoder Audio Edition can convert files individually or in batches. You can view a file's properties on the main screen and change settings for individual files or your whole queue. The graphical user interface is simple, but there are a lot of modifiable parameters for you to play with; although a beginner can easily convert a file from format A to format B quite easily as well.\n\nThere are two versions of MediaCoder AE: x86 and x64. If you run an x64 operating system, the x64 version of MediaCoder will take full advantage of that, which will result in performance boosts.\n\nThe version 0.7x adds a new toolbar with new buttons and icons, features improved AviSynth support, more translatable text, a new layout in the Video and Audio tabs, a remux option, and an MP4Creator, among many more changes."
