        "text": "Steven Hughes via Techronical attempts to answer a question that most Zuners encounter at one point or another; how to get high-quality videos in a compact filesize and that don't take a long time to convert. Based on a tip from Long Zheng, Hughes recommends the free (donationware) program MediaCoder, which allows users to import custom encoder presets to help smooth the process and achieve consistent results.\n\nThough Zheng's settings file is MediaCoder-specific, his suggested bitrate, framerate, and resolution should be universal for your favorite encoder.\n\nHe recommends:\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat: Windows Media\n\nCodec: Windows Media Video 9\n\nMode: Bitrate-based\n\nBitrate: 768 Kbps\n\nResolution: 320Ã—240\n\nFrame rate: 25 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nEncoder: Windows Media Audio\n\nCodec: Windows Media Audio 9.2\n\nResample: 44100 Hz\n\nMode: CBR\n\nBitrate: 192 Kbps"
