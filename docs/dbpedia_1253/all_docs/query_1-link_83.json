        "text": "In the world of multimedia computing, there are various types of media coding standards; some are proprietary while many of them are open source. Depending on the purpose of media content, it may be required to convert from one standard file to the other. This procedure is referred to as transcoding. This program was designed to transcode multimedia content with an emphasis on quality output.\n\nThe application is highly configurable thereby allowing the user to transcode media content and deliver a target output with precision. It may not be the most user-friendly transcoding application, but the quality of the output makes up for the hassles involved in the transcoding process.\n\nIt supports conversion for most audio and video file format, also is capable of ripping DVD / VCD/CD and can also capture directly from a video camera. You can add various video filter enhancements on video content.\n\nThis application does more than just transcoding; it can fix corrupted files and repair partial downloads. If you work with media content, you should try out this app.\n\nMediaCoder is licensed as freeware for PC or laptop with Windows 32 bit and 64 bit operating system. It is in video converters category and is available to all software users as a free download."
