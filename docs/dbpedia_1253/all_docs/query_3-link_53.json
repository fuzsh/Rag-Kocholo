MTS/AVCHD, QuickTime and OGM are supported for input only.\n\nAnd on the audio side, the program can work with all the audio files you’d expect, and many you wouldn’t: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, LC-AAC, HE-AAC 1/2, AC-3, MPEG Audio L2, MusePack, Speex, AMR, WMA, ADPCM, mp3Pro (input only), FLAC, WavPack, Monkey’s Audio, OptimFrog, ALAC, TTA and PCM.\n\nThe program is absolutely packed with options to help you configure every step of the conversion process, and that can make it a little tricky to use, at least at first – expect to spend a while learning your way around. Once you’ve mastered the basics it’s quite straightforward, though, and strong multi-threading support ensures your files will be converted with the maximum possible speed.\n\nWhat’s new in\n\nBack to Top ↑\n\nSign up for the Technology Minute\n\nThe latest from TechCentral.ie direct to your inbox daily\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nSupport our advertisers\n\nListen to Tech Radio\n\nMost Popular\n\nApple updates EU App Store policy after Commission investigation\n\nEurope flexes muscles with Digital Markets Act\n\nSD Worx invests €3m in payroll services for SMEs\n\nReporting standards creates opportunities for payroll and HR services provider\n\nRobot cabs on Chinese roads alarm cab drivers\n\nBaidu-owned Apollo Go not expected to turn a profit for five years\n\nGoogle monopoly slapdown may have come too late\n\nThe US antitrust judgement against Google is unlikely to see the company split, but it comes at a time both of competitors eyeing an opportunity to...\n\nCrash!\n\nGoogle goes through a crisis of identity and the rest of the week's news\n\nTechCentral.ie\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.
