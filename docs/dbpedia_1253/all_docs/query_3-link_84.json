At the moment I'm using the LAME encoder via Audacity, but couldn't figure out how to increase the bitrate.\n\nI imported a wav file into Mediacoder, chose LAME, and converted. It says the file is converted from 47megs to 8.6megs (this would be OK for upload to Soundclick). When I played the mp3 though, it was just hiss, no music.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThe Mediacoder is a lot easier front end, and gives the option to select 128, 256, 320 transfer rate etc. Couple of things I'm not sure of though:\n\n1. Does this mean that I have to download the LAME encoder again, or does Mediacoder come with LAME installed already?\n\n2. There was a choice to download 32 or 64 bit Mediacoder - I'm using XP and downloaded the 32 bit. Is that correct?\n\nThanks\n\nStoojo Music\n\nDell 2400, XP 1 Gig RAM, Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz, M-Audio 2496, PSR310, LP Custom, Fender Strat, Yam Acoustic, Peavey amps, Zodiac BXP bass\n\n5 Replies\n\nCJaysMusic\n\nMax Output Level: 0 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 30423\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Miami - Fort Lauderdale - Davie\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Mediacoder set up/use (permalink)\n\nThere was a choice to download 32 or 64 bit Mediacoder - I'm using XP and downloaded the 32 bit.

Aside from that, i never heard of that encoder. I use Lame and it works great\n\nwww.audio-mastering-mixing.com - A Professional Worldwide Audio Mixing & Mastering Studio, Providing Online And Attended Sessions.

I use LAME at the moment too but can't figure out how to change the conversion from 128 bit to higher, for better conversion.\n\nDo you know how to do it?\n\nThanks\n\nPS - how do I find out if I'm 32 or 64 bit?\n\npost edited by rob.pulman -\n\nStoojo Music\n\nDell 2400, XP 1 Gig RAM, Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz, M-Audio 2496, PSR310, LP Custom, Fender Strat, Yam Acoustic, Peavey amps, Zodiac BXP bass\n\nrob.pulman\n\nMax Output Level: -68 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 1146\n\nJoined:\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Mediacoder set up/use (permalink)\n\nThanks to all - I found I can alter the LAME preferences through an Audacity interface, easy.\n\nCheers\n\nStoojo Music\n\nDell 2400, XP 1 Gig RAM, Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz, M-Audio 2496, PSR310, LP Custom, Fender Strat, Yam Acoustic, Peavey amps, Zodiac BXP bass\n\nohhey\n\nMax Output Level: 0 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 11676\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Fort Worth Texas USA\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRE: Mediacoder set up/use (permalink)\n\nWas the wav file 44.1 at 16bit before you started the conversion ?"
