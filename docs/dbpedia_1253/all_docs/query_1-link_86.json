I have a CS4 license so I don't know if it is free or not, but it is definitely my preference over anything else I've used (or tried to use).\n\nI had exactly the same issue on my iMAC and found a free converter - search for \"Kigo\" - I use it pretty much every day and haven't had any issues with it. Not sure if it works on PC though."
