        "text": "Scientists have just confirmed that May 2024 was the hottest May in history, marking twelve straight months of the hottest months ever.\n\nOur planet is trying to tell us something, but we don't seem to be listening.\n\nTo mark this week’s World Environment Day, on Wednesday I gave a special address on the state of the climate crisis at the American Museum of Natural History. It’s an iconic location that tells the story of our natural world and the vast forces that have shaped life on Earth over billions of years.\n\nMuch like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, humans are having an outsized impact on our planet.\n\nIn the case of climate, we are not the dinosaurs. We are the meteor.\n\nAnd we are not only in danger, we are the danger.\n\nBut we are also the solution. Here are some of the ideas I shared about this moment of truth the world is facing.\n\nAlmost ten years since the Paris Agreement was adopted, the target of limiting long-term global warming to 1.5° Celsius is hanging by a thread.\n\nWhy all the fuss about 1.5°? Because every fraction of a degree of global heating counts.\n\nThe difference between 1.5°C and 2°C could be the difference between extinction and survival for some small island countries and coastal communities.\n\nIt could be the difference between minimizing climate chaos or crossing dangerous tipping points.\n\n1.5°C is not a target. It is not a goal. It is a physical limit.\n\nNew data from leading climate scientists show the remaining carbon budget to limit long-term warming to 1.5°C is now around 200 billion tonnes. That is the maximum amount of carbon dioxide the earth’s atmosphere can take if we are to have a fighting chance of staying within the limit. But at current rates, our entire carbon budget will be busted before 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Meteorological Organisation has just reported that there is an 80% chance that the global annual average temperature will exceed the 1.5°C limit in at least one of the next five years.\n\nAnd there’s a 50-50 chance that the average temperature for the entire next five-year period will be 1.5°C higher than pre-industrial times.\n\nBut the 1.5°C limit is still just about possible – it’s a limit for the long-term – measured over decades, not months or years. Stepping over the threshold for a short time does not mean the long-term goal is shot.\n\nIt means we need to fight harder.\n\nThe battle for 1.5°C will be won or lost in this decade. It all depends on the decisions leaders take – or fail to take – especially in the next eighteen months.\n\nWe have what we need to save ourselves.\n\nOur forests, our wetlands, and our oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nWe also have the technologies we need to slash emissions. Renewables already make up 30% of the world’s electricity supply. Wind and solar are now growing faster than any electricity source in history.\n\nEconomic logic makes the end of the fossil fuel age inevitable.\n\nThe only questions are: Will that end come in time? And will the transition be just?\n\nWe must ensure the answer to both questions is: yes.\n\nTo do so, we must take urgent climate action, particularly over the next eighteen months:\n\nFirst, we need huge cuts in emissions.\n\nThe G20 countries produce 80 %of global emissions – they have the responsibility, and the capacity, to lead emissions cuts.\n\nAdvanced G20 economies should go furthest, fastest. They must also show climate solidarity by providing technological and financial support to emerging G20 economies and other developing countries.\n\nNext year, governments must submit updated national climate action plans, which will determine emissions for the coming years.\n\nThese plans must be aligned with the 1.5°C limit, including absolute emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2035. They must cover all sectors, all greenhouse gases, and the whole economy.\n\nSecond, we must ramp up protection from the climate chaos of today and tomorrow.\n\nWe cannot accept a future where the rich are protected in air-conditioned bubbles, while the rest of humanity is lashed by lethal weather in unliveable lands.\n\nEvery person on Earth must be protected by an early warning system by 2027.\n\nAnd all developed countries must honour their commitment to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year by 2025.\n\nThird, finance: If money makes the world go round, today’s unequal financial flows are sending us spinning towards disaster.\n\nThe global financial system must be part of the climate solution. We need a massive expansion of affordable public and private finance to fuel ambitious new climate plans and deliver clean, affordable energy for all.\n\nI urge the G7 and G20 Summits to commit to using their influence within Multilateral Development Banks to make them better, bigger, and bolder, and able to leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost.\n\nClimate finance is not a favour. It is fundamental to a liveable future for all.\n\nFourth, confront those in the fossil fuel industry who have shown relentless zeal for obstructing progress.\n\nI call on leaders in the fossil fuel industry to understand that if they are not in the fast lane to clean energy transformation, they are driving their business into a dead end – and taking us all with them. Their massive profits give them the chance to lead the energy transition. They shouldn’t miss it.\n\nI also urge financial institutions to stop bankrolling fossil fuel destruction and start investing in a global renewables revolution. They must present public, credible and detailed plans to transition funding from fossil fuels to clean energy with clear targets for 2025 and 2030.\n\nI call on advertising and PR companies to stop acting as enablers to planetary destruction – Mad Men fuelling the madness.\n\nThey must stop taking on new fossil fuel clients, from today, and set out plans to drop your existing ones.\n\nAnd I urge every country to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies, and every news media and tech company to stop taking fossil fuel advertising.\n\nWe have a choice - create tipping points for climate progress, or careen to tipping points for climate disaster.\n\nThe United Nations is all-in. We are working to build trust, find solutions, and inspire the cooperation our world so desperately needs.\n\nNow is the time to mobilise, now is the time to act, now is the time to deliver."
