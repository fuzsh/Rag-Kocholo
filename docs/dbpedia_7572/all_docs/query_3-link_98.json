        "text": "Climate change is expected to result in significant changes in Carpathian region due to more frequent extreme events. Studying the spatio-temporal changes of climate extremes can be implemented through the analysis of observations reliable in time and in space. Numerous climate indices are used in several projects on climate change as prevailing indicators of changes in extremes. The homogenized (MASH (Szentimrey)) and gridded (MISH (Szentimrey and Bihari)) datasets created in the frame of the CARPATCLIM are used in this study for investigations. The temporal resolution of the gridded database is daily for period 1961-2010, the spatial resolution is 0.1°. Many basic meteorological variables were homogenized and interpolated on this grid for the 50 years long time frame from 1961 to 2010 (Szalai et al., 2011). The harmonized database achieved in the project provides relevant outcomes for studying extremes. Several temperature and precipitation indices are calculated in this study for...\n\nIn order to cover a millennium-long period in climatological studies, several types of information must be taken into consideration. Beyond the regular meteorological observations, historical documentary data may serve as a basic source for the past centuries. For the Carpathian basin, Réthly collected historical documents containing meteorology-related information. In order to facilitate the analysis of this documentary collection, a special code system using hierarchical subclasses has been defined and applied to approximately 15 000 collected climatological items. The spatial and temporal distributions of temperature- and precipitation-related climate events and extremes have been evaluated using settlement and subregional scales. Also, the geographical distribution of extreme climatological events has been mapped. Annual and seasonal time series have been analysed for the Carpathian basin and compared with other reconstructed temperature and precipitation index time series from other geographical locations outside the Carpathian basin.\n\nThe Hungarian Meteorological Service has been conducting climate model simulations in order to assess the effects of climate change in the Carpathian Basin and provide data for impact research and stakeholders. Two regional climate models are used: ALADIN-Climate 5.2 (hereafter ALADIN5.2) and REMO2015. They were tested for the past when the lateral boundary conditions were taken from two sources. ERA-Interim reanalysis was used in the evaluation experiment, while the CNRM-CM5 and the MPI-ESM-LR global climate models (GCM) provided the forcings in the control experiments. The model outputs were compared with the CarpatClim-HU observational dataset for the 1981–2000 period. Future projections were carried out with the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and the results were analyzed for 2021–2050 and 2071–2100. The evaluation of the results focused mainly on climate indices calculated from temperature and precipitation. The validation results showed that REMO2015 assessed the mean temperatur...\n\nThe results in the issue of local signs of global climate change at Keszthely (Hungary) are summarized and presented in this paper. The meteorological measurements at Keszthely have long history, a more than 140-year-long dataset of monthly amount of precipitation, provided by the University of Pannonia, is available for statistical analysis. The long-time series of precipitation amounts of Keszthely (Hungary) meteorological station was analyzed from the beginning of the observation (1871) until 2014, from the point of view of climate change. Simple climate-statistical analysis has been made in purpose to discover local climate alternations. Linear and exponential trends were fitted, and it was concluded that linear trends in every case had lower relative standard error than exponential trends, so linear changes were interpreted. Despite the fact that significant declining tendency was expected, the annual data does not show any modification in the tendency or variability, but other..."
