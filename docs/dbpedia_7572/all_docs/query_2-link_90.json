        "text": "The Upper Town is filled with attractions - it’s a true magnet for tourists and locals alike. It’s not a large area, yet it’s easy to miss some streets and squares. This article is here to point you to a charming square that is too often left out of tourist routes, and we really don’t want you to miss it: Jezuitski trg - the Jesuit Square. It is surrounded by history and curiosities, and we're about to swing by and share some of them.\n\nGraphic design is an ever-evolving discipline that blends artistry with functionality, shaping how we perceive and interact with visual information. In Zagreb, graphic design has developed a distinctive identity, deeply intertwined with the city’s historical and cultural narrative.\n\nIt is time to talk about the weather. We are in the first month of summer, and summers in Zagreb can get very warm. Why don't we hide in the deep shade of the Zrinjevac park? When we do, it’s good to know that Zrinjevac is the best place to discuss the weather.\n\nIt’s time for Zagreb to celebrate! The day of the city is fast approaching, and this year, it will be full of engaging participative events.\n\nOn March 2024, Zagreb's cultural scene was enriched by an artistic project that had already sparked wide public interest even before its official opening. Located at 44 A Radićeva Street, the \"Oto Reisinger House of Cartoons\" has officially opened its doors."
