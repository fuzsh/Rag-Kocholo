        "text": "Croatia, famous for its picturesque beaches and as a filming location for the hit series Games of Thrones, offers a wealth of opportunities for digital nomads. According to Nomad List, 11% of Zagreb’s visiting nomads return, putting it within the range of cities with high visitor return rates like Istanbul, Bangkok, and others.\n\nLet’s dig in to discover more about this Croatian capital.\n\nThe Visa application\n\nBeginning January 1st, 2023, Croatia was enlisted as a Schengen member state to become the latest European country to join the area. This means it is issuing Schengen Visas while fully utilizing the Schengen Information System.\n\nWho requires a Schengen Visa to enter Croatia?\n\nBased on the common rules governing visa issuance in the Schengen Zone, you need a visa to enter Croatia if you are a national of a third-world country that hasn’t struck a visa liberalization agreement with the European Union. If your country has reached a visa free agreement with the Schengen states, you may still have to apply for a visa if your application has been rejected before.\n\nVisa options for digital nomads\n\nThe Croatia Tourist Visa: It is ideal for individuals looking to vacation in Croatia. You may also use it for digital nomad purposes because of the loose nature of freelance work.\n\nThe Croatia Visitor Visa: This one is designed for foreigners who wish to visit family members or friends in Croatia. It may be a limited option but ideal for digital nomads who qualify for it.\n\nThe Digital Nomad Visa: After much deliberation, the government finally introduced it in early 2021 to address the concerns of remote workers interested in entering Croatia.\n\nThese three visa categories fall under short-term Croatian Schengen visas.\n\nRequirements for a short-term Croatian Schengen Visa\n\nWhen applying for a short-term visa to Croatia, these documents must be submitted to the Croatian embassy/consulate:\n\nA fully completed and signed Croatia visa application form\n\nYour passport should have at least two blank pages to accommodate the Croatian visa sticker. Check to ensure it is valid for at least three months beyond the date you leave Croatia. It must be under ten years old.\n\nTwo recent photographs (taken within the last three months) that meet Croatia visa photo requirements\n\nProof of accommodation (hotel reservation for the entire stay)\n\nProof of adequate financial means for the duration of stay in Croatia (€95 per day for hotel accommodation, €45 for other types)\n\nProof of civil status (marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.)\n\nSchengen Travel Insurance with a minimum coverage of €30,000 for medical emergencies and repatriation in case of death.\n\nA cover letter detailing the purpose of the trip and additional information\n\nRound-trip flight itinerary with entry and exit dates from Croatia.\n\nLanguage Preference form to specify your preferred language for application processing. You can choose the German, French, or Dutch languages. If you prefer to complete your application in English, select the “no preference option.”\n\nThe Digital Nomad Visa\n\nCroatia introduced its digital nomad visa in January 2021, a year before joining the Schengen area. In Croatia, the terms digital nomad visa and temporary stay permit may be used interchangeably. However, it would be more accurate to call it a “digital nomad residence permit” owing to the length of time it allows you to stay in the country. Croatian visas typically cover short-stays, but the digital nomad document is valid for up to 12 months.\n\nTo apply for it, you must fulfill the following requirements;\n\nYou must not be a national of an EU or EEA country\n\nShow that your monthly income is around € 2300.\n\nWork remotely, meaning your company must be outside of Croatia.\n\nHave a valid passport (it must be valid for three months after the expiry of your digital nomad visa)\n\nValid health insurance\n\nHave a certificate of good conduct (by your country’s police department)\n\nProof of secured accommodation in Croatia is required. Submit a confirmed booking or a rental agreement.\n\nHow do you apply for a Croatian Digital Nomad Visa?\n\nYou may apply for a Croatian Digital Nomad visa in two ways,\n\nFill out and submit application forms at a Croatian embassy or consulate’s office\n\nApply online In this case, go to the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs website and fill in the relevant form\n\nYour application must be made in either English or Croatian languages.\n\nThe Digital Nomad Visa application process\n\nThere are two approaches to it.\n\nDirect application (Embassy or Consulate)\n\nDownload the application form 1a from your nearest Croatian Embassy website\n\nHave all the required documents together\n\nMake an appointment with the embassy or consulate and ensure to submit completed forms and documents in good time. You can find all the Croatian embassies listed here.\n\nYou should receive a phone call or an envelope once your application has been approved.\n\nThe online application\n\nMany applicants go with the online option because it is more convenient. If this is your preference, observe the following steps;\n\nGo to the website and fill out this form.\n\nAfter submitting, your application will be forwarded to the relevant authorities (The Croatian police administration) for authentication and approval. Please note that they may request additional documents.\n\nOnce the authorities approve your application, you will receive an e-mail to that effect.\n\nUpon entering Croatia, ensure to register your temporary residence within three days.\n\nThe digital nomad visa fees\n\nIf applying through a diplomatic mission or consular post, here are the estimated costs (as of Jan 2023)\n\nTemporary stay – €55.74\n\nThe long-term visa D – €93.00 (Tendering your application through the VFS visa center will attract additional charges)\n\nThe biometric residence card – €41.14\n\nThe following amounts apply if you apply through the police administration.\n\nTemporary stay- €46.45\n\nBiometric residence permits admin fees – €9.29\n\nBiometric residence card – €31.85\n\nIf you wish issuance of the biometric residence card to be accelerated, you will have to pay €59.73\n\nCost of living and cost of living arbitrage\n\nAccording to the Numbeo survey, a single person’s monthly costs are estimated at $1258, including rent. However, Nomad List puts a digital nomad’s estimated monthly cost at $2684. The discrepancy can largely be explained by the lifestyle choices of the survey participants, among other factors.\n\nIf you are a New York City digital nomad keen on cost arbitrage, you would have to spend about €2925 ($3180) in Zagreb to maintain a lifestyle that costs you $9100 in New York City. This estimate assumes you rent in both cities.\n\nZagreb generally offers a significantly lower cost of living compared to New York. According to recent Numbeo data, consumer prices in Zagreb are 47.5% lower than in New York, and the cost of living, including rent, is 65.1% lower.\n\nOne major contributing factor to the lower cost of living in Zagreb is the price of rent, which is 84% lower than in New York. This makes Zagreb an attractive destination for people keen on saving.\n\nSomething else contributing to the lower cost of living in Zagreb is the price of groceries, which is 56.1% lower than in New York. This, combined with the lower prices at restaurants (52.8% lower), makes it possible for a digital nomad to enjoy a high quality of life without spending off their limits.\n\nThe Table below compares commodity prices between the two cities.\n\nItemsNew York, NYZagrebDifferenceMeal (inexpensive restaurant)$25.00 (€23.33)$10.67 (€9.95) -57.3%McMeal at McDonalds$10.55 (€9.85)$7.12 (€6.64) -32.5%Domestic beer (0.5 liter draught)$8.00 (€7.47)$2.84 (€2.65) -64.5%Milk (1 liter)$1.24 (€1.16)$1.24 (€1.16) 0Fresh white bread (500g)$4.24 (€3.96)$1.18 (€1.11) -72.1%Beef round (1kg)$21.05 (€19.64)$12.60 (€11.76) -40.1%Tomato (1kg)$6.15 (€5.74)$2.42 (€2.26) -60.6%Fitness club (monthly fee for one adult)$98.26 (€91.69)$45.33 (€42.30) -53.9%1 pair of jeans (e.g., Levis 501)$64.29 (€60.00)$87.61 (€81.76) +36.3%1 pair of Nike running shoes (mid-range)$95.46 (€89.07)$89.73 (€83.73) -6.0%\n\nAccommodation for digital nomads\n\nDigital nomads entering Zagreb have several options for accommodation. Like other major cities, you can find accommodation in hotels, hostels, apartments, and co-living spaces.\n\nHotel accommodation: According to Nomad List, the median price for a hotel stay is $52 per night, with a monthly rate of $1,119. If you’re looking for a rental option, a 1-bedroom studio in the city center can be found for $1,037 per month. You can find a hotel that befits your budget by visiting real estate platforms, including booking.com, expedia.com, and hotels.com.\n\nHostels: Although hostels are associated more with students’ life, they are a good option for digital nomads, especially those on a mission to spend less and save more. These facilities offer cheaper accommodation with shared rooms, common areas for socializing, and other basic amenities. Some popular hostels for digital nomads in Zagreb include;\n\nHI Hostel Zagreb (about $37 per night)\n\nHostel Swanky Mint (about $42 per night)\n\nChillout Hostel (about $50 per night).\n\nYou can find more options on platforms like Hostelworld.\n\nApartments: Renting an apartment is a good option for those needing more privacy and space. Owing to the time allocated to digital nomads to stay in Croatia (12 months), many will prefer settling in apartments. If this is your preference, you may check out Airbnb and Booking.com, as they offer a wide range of apartments in Zagreb. These range from budget-friendly to luxury apartments. Some apartments that may interest you include;\n\nApartment Lana\n\nZagreb City Vibe Apartments & Rooms\n\nApartment Horvat\n\nCo-living spaces: Co-living spaces in Zagreb, as is the case in other cities, offer an affordable and convenient alternative to traditional rental apartments. They are especially popular among students, young professionals, and travelers. Many digital nomads also prefer these facilities. You can discover these spaces by joining lively digital nomad communities like Cocohub, Zagreb.\n\nThe city has numerous co-living spaces offering varied rates based on room type, length of stay, and demand. Moreover, some co-living spaces may offer additional services, such as cleaning, laundry, and meals, which can impact the overall cost. It’s always best to directly check with the co-living space for the most up-to-date pricing information. Nonetheless, expect to spend an average of $100 per month for a living space.\n\nNeighborhoods that are popular with digital nomads\n\nFor any Foreigner, the security of a neighborhood is a high priority, especially when choosing where to rent an apartment. Zagreb is a relatively safe city where you can walk around without fear of the attacks witnessed in some cities.\n\nFor private mansions, consider areas on the hills of Medvednica mountain like Mlinovi, Pantovčak, or Tuškanac.\n\nIf you fancy modern apartments, you may look in newly built areas near Jarun, but if pre-socialist era bourgeois apartments comprise your taste, consider the town center areas of Donji Grad, Gornji Grad, or Medvešćak.\n\nDonji Grad is in the lower part of Zagreb. It is a historic neighborhood, home to many of the city’s famous landmarks, such as the Zagreb Cathedral and St. Mark’s Church, and a wide range of restaurants, cafes, and shops.\n\nOn the other hand, Gornji Grad comprises the upper town. This is the city’s medieval district and is known for its well-preserved architecture, delightful cobblestone streets, and stunning views over the city.\n\nThe city also has lively, well-arranged mid-class neighborhoods around the Novi Zagreb parts like Siget, Sopot, Utrina, Travno, or Sloboština. Novi Zagreb is a trendy neighborhood located on the city’s western side and is known for its green spaces and easy access to public transportation. Most of the buildings here were built during the early socialist era.\n\nAnother good Zagreb neighborhood is the area along Ilica street. Ilica Street, at almost 6 km in length, is a highly-trafficked shopping street in Zagreb that appeals to all shopping enthusiasts. Whether you’re looking for a terrace to grab a drink or a place to dine out, this bustling street has it all. From high-end to budget-friendly shops, Ilica has many options for shoppers.\n\nRegardless of where you choose to live, Zagreb is a great place for digital nomads, with its affordable cost of living, good public transportation, and growing co-working scene.\n\nUtilities\n\nThe basic utilities for an 85-square-meter apartment in Zagreb cost approximately 199.06 euros per month. This price range varies between 137 to 293 euros. A minute of prepaid mobile tariff within the local area costs approximately 0.12 euros, ranging between 0.03 to 0.16 euros.\n\nFor internet services with a speed of 60 Mbps or higher, unlimited data, and cable/ADSL connection, the cost is estimated to be 24.06 euros per month. It ranges between 20-33 euros.\n\nCo-working Spaces\n\nBeing a major digital nomad attraction, Zagreb has introduced many co-working spaces to meet this demand. The price of a hot desk can vary based on the location, amenities, and type of co-working space. However, according to Nomad List, a co-working hot desk can cost about $290 per month.\n\nHere are some specific co-working spaces that may be near you.\n\nHUB 385 – HUB 385 is a modern co-working space covering over 2,500 square meters.

However, like many countries in transition, it has faced challenges in these areas.\n\nPolitically, Croatia is a parliamentary democracy with a multi-party system and a president serving as the head of state. While the country has had a peaceful transfer of power and regular elections, issues like integrity remain a subject of public concern.\n\nEconomically, the country has made significant strides in recent years. Since joining the European Union (EU), on January 1st, 2023, there are clear signs that the tourism industry will grow by leaps and bounds and impact other sectors positively. However, it still faces challenges, including high public debt and a need for structural reforms to improve competitiveness.\n\nCroatia’s political stability and absence of violence/terrorism measures score of 0.70787 in 2021, as reported by the World Bank, highlights a relatively stable and secure political environment in the country.\n\nThe score of 0.70787 indicates that the likelihood of political instability or politically-motivated violence, including terrorism, is relatively low in the country. This is positive news for digital nomads and businesses in Croatia, as a stable and secure environment is crucial for growth and development.\n\nLanguage and language barriers\n\nCroatian is the main language in Zagreb. However, many people also speak English, as it is widely taught in schools and commonly used as a second language in the business and tourism industries. English is also widely used as a common language between speakers of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds in Zagreb.\n\nCroatia ranks 11th globally and 10th in Europe in terms of English proficiency, according to EF’s English Proficiency Index (EPI). The country’s EPI score of 612 is higher than the global average of 502. Overall, Croatia’s English proficiency is rated as “Very High. “The prevalence of English points to a low language barrier for expats and nomads doing business in the city. Besides Croatian and English, some people speak German and other minority languages, including Italian, Hungarian, Czech, and Serbian.\n\nHealthcare in Zagreb\n\nCroatia has a rich history of medical research and innovation, having developed drugs such as Azithromycin in the 1980s and, more recently, a new incision-less Gamma Knife for radiation therapy at the University Hospital Center Zagreb. The country has also made advances in dentistry, setting the standard for new technologies and devices.\n\nZagreb city offers various health care options for its residents and visitors. The city has several public and private hospitals that provide various medical services, including general practitioners, specialists, and emergency care.\n\nSome of the most well-known public hospitals in Zagreb include\n\nMerkur Clinical Hospital\n\nAddress: Zajčeva ul. 19, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPhone: +385 1 2431 390\n\nKlinički bolnički centar Zagreb\n\nAddress: Kišpatićeva ul. 12, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPhone: +385 1 2388 888\n\nSisters of Charity Hospital, Zagreb\n\nAddress: Vinogradska cesta 29, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nThese hospitals provide various medical services, including diagnostic services, surgical procedures, and rehabilitation.\n\nHealthcare for foreigners\n\nAs an expatriate living and working in the country, it is mandatory to enroll in the national health insurance program known as HZZO. This insurance is required for all citizens and long-term residents in Croatia. Obtaining a supplementary international health insurance policy from a reputable provider is also advisable. These include;\n\nDodatno zdravstveno osiguranje\n\nDopunsko zdravstveno osiguranje\n\nObvezno zdravstveno osiguranje\n\nYou can use international insurance companies, such as Now Health International.\n\nCroatian healthcare is exceptional and affordable. The low cost of living and government support allows physicians to provide a high standard of care, making the country a popular destination for medical tourists seeking affordable, high-quality procedures. In fact, reports indicate that the cost of renowned medical care in Croatia is 70% less compared to other leading countries. Many famous individuals, such as Russian Chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov and several athletes, have sought medical treatment in Croatia.\n\nState of healthcare based on a recent survey\n\nLegit survey firm Numbeo.com did research (February 2023) involving 224 participants to establish the Croatian city’s state of healthcare.\n\nLet’s do a brief analysis of the published results.\n\nThe healthcare in Zagreb, Croatia, is rated as having a high level of skill and competency among medical staff. With a score of 70.14, patients can expect a high standard of medical care and attention from knowledgeable and capable professionals.\n\nIn terms of speed of completion of examinations and reports Zagreb is moderate as it scored slightly below 50%. While not the quickest, the medical staff in Zagreb are thorough and precise, ensuring that patients receive a high level of care. Diagnosis and treatment equipment emerged with an impressive score of 65.88%. This indicates that the medical institutions in Zagreb are equipped with modern and advanced equipment to provide accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.\n\nAccuracy and completeness in filling out reports are also excellent, scoring 65.50% in this survey. Therefore, Patients can feel confident that their medical records are properly documented and maintained. The staff in Zagreb medical institutions are rated as friendly and courteous, settling for an encouraging 62.44%. This creates a welcoming and positive patient environment, making one’s medical experience more pleasant.\n\nHowever, satisfaction with responsiveness (waitings) in medical institutions is rated low, scoring a meager 34.12%. This suggests that patients may have to wait longer before being seen by a doctor or receiving medical treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, satisfaction with the cost is rated high, at 74.89%. In short, patients are pleased with the affordability of healthcare in Zagreb, making it accessible to a wider range of people. Finally, the convenience of location for patients registered a high score of 76.79%. In other words, medical institutions in Zagreb are located conveniently, making it easy for patients to access the medical care they need.\n\nOverall, the healthcare in Zagreb is rated highly in most areas. However, the low satisfaction with responsiveness (waitings) is a wake-up call for the city’s health division to do better.\n\nVaccinations\n\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends taking several vaccines before landing in Zagreb.\n\nFlu (influenza)\n\nPolio\n\nMeasles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR)\n\nChickenpox (Varicella)\n\nDiphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis\n\nShingles\n\nOthers include COVID-19, Hepatitis A & B, Measles, Rabies, and Tick-borne Encephalitis.\n\nThe electronic standards\n\nCroatia’s standard voltage is 220 volts AC (alternating current) at 50 Hz. This is the same voltage standard used in many countries globally. Some electrical devices, particularly those designed for use in North America, may differ from the 220V standard used in Croatia. Therefore, these devices may need a voltage converter or transformer to work properly.\n\nPayment services and infrastructure\n\nZagreb has a well-developed payment services infrastructure. This infrastructure provides various options for individuals and businesses to make and receive payments.\n\nFor individuals, the most common forms of payment include cash, debit and credit cards, and online payment services. Major debit and credit cards, such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, are widely accepted in Zagreb, making it easy for tourists and visitors to withdraw cash and make purchases from ATMs.\n\nA survey by Statista shows that the number of card transactions in Croatia experienced a substantial increase from 2013 to 2020, totaling over 410 million by the end of 2020. The lowest recorded number of card transactions was in 2013, with over 202.5 million. Despite this, cash payments remain crucial in Croatia, making up 73% of all payments in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, many local and international online payment services, such as PayPal and Klik, are popular and widely used in the city.\n\nMobile payments have become increasingly popular in Zagreb, Croatia, as more people adopt digital solutions for their financial transactions. With the growth of smartphones and other mobile devices, Zagreb residents can now pay for goods and services with just a few taps on their screens.\n\nA 2020 survey by Master index revealed that an overwhelming majority of Croatian citizens, 90%, now use contactless cards for making payments for goods and services. Additionally, 70% of respondents reported paying through mobile phones, and 85% expressed satisfaction with digital payment services.\n\nIn addition to these services, many retail stores in Zagreb now accept mobile payments through services like Google Pay and Apple Pay.
