They warned me that they are a little alive and temperamental disciples, but I can say about them only praise. They answered very polite on the questions, and they fascinated me with their knowledge of meteorology. They answered the question correctly: \"What are the climate and the weather?\" Unlike adults who often mix these terms. In the animated film \"The fire is no joke,\" they liked the most that children together reforested after the fire. But they were surprised with the rise in global temperature on Earth from year to year which increases the risk of forest fires. How lecture of forest fires impressed them? Their art works in collage are best expression, and selected pictures are in the gallery.\n\nRead more...\n\nVienna, April 12, 2018.\n\nFire is no joke presented on Phenological Symposium\n\nWithin the framework of the COST 725 Establishing a European Phenological Data Platform for Climatological Applications, (2005-2009) and EUMETNET/ZAMG PEP 725 Pan European phenological database (2010-today) the European phenological Database was established with the headquarters of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) in Vienna.

The last extreme cold year was in Croatia in 1940. This causes a faster and more frequent change of extreme weather conditions - very hot and dry periods contribute to reducing the yield of agricultural crops and the occurrence of large wildfires. On the other hand, extreme cold or frost causes large losses in orchards and vineyards and abundant rain of catastrophic floods. These are all the consequences of climate change and global warming, which is so much to talk about. But the public is still unconvincing about all the warnings that scientists give, even though they feel consequences caused by climate change.\n\nRead more...\n\nZagreb, December 8–11, 2017 and February 22, 2018\n\nThe Tenth and Eleven Annual Assembly of HAgMD\n\nThe Croatian Agrometeorological Society held the Tenth Annual Meeting by e-mail from 8 to 11 December 2017.

On May 26, 2017, in the kindergarten Mokošica in the same settlement in Dubrovnik, the lecture was held by Ivan Čavlina Tomašević, a member of HAgMD. An animated film \"Fire is no joke\" was presented to fifty children of preschool age. The children were delighted with dormouse Matko and the firefighters.

We sought the help of the artist's external associates. We tried to link scientific and artistic thoughts, and normally, we often reproached and sought common points in different things. Linking science, where everything needs to be exact and with evidence, and art, that has unlimited freedom, looks like an impossible mission. But in the end we succeeded. Animated film is the backbone of the Little School \"Fire is no joke\", as well as children's comic with the same name. Those two are durable, educational material that we share with children. Their best promotion was at this year's biggest book event in Zagreb, INTERLIBER.\n\nRead more...\n\nČučerje, October 13, 2017\n\nThe enthusiasm in Čučerje with animated film \"Fire is no joke\"\n\nThe idea of organization of the Little School \"Fire is no joke\" for students of the Čučerje Elementary School in Zagreb came up on Hvar beach during the summer heat, when terrible fires harboured Dalmatia. Maintenance of two Little Schools for II and VIII classes in Čučerje came from a random conversation about the animated film \"Fire is no joke\" with a professor of fine arts education, who is a class teacher in VIII class in that school.\n\nRead more...\n\nHvar, February 27, 2017 and August 1, 2017\n\nWhy did not you tell me this before?\n\nIn agreement with the teacher, Ivana Visković, an hour of meteorology was organized in her class of the 2nd grade Elementary school of Hvar.

Perhaps nothing important happened in agrometeorology on this date, but it was convenient for us to keep the Little School \"Fire is no joke\" in different parts of Croatia. However, we later found out that on May 29, 1953, man first won the highest peak in the world. There are some symbols as well. Our Society is slightly developing and climbing, and will reach the top one day.\n\nRead more...\n\nBabino Polje, May 12, 2017.\n\nLittle School \"Fire is no joke\" held on the island of Mljet\n\nWithin the framework of the Little School \"Fire is no joke\", the homonymous animated short film was shown to the 50 pupils from the first to the fourth grade of the Babino Polje Primary School on the island of Mljet and to the children of kindergarten on May 12, 2017.
