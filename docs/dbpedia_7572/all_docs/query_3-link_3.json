        "text": "The system will provide complete, reliable and timely information on the situation in the atmosphere and at sea throughout Croatia’s territory and territorial waters. Improvements will also be made in the monitoring of trace elements which could pose environmental threats.\n\nIn addition, systems for processing, controlling, storing and ensuring the availability of data will be enhanced. The meteorological calibration laboratory will receive upgraded equipment for the calibration of observation sensors.\n\nA need for more data\n\nPrior to the implementation phase of METMONIC, analysis was carried out using Croatia’s existing meteorological observation network and its supporting technical, information and organisational systems. The analysis confirmed that there was an urgent need to increase the availability of data on climatic variables and conditions, particularly given the sensitivity of Croatia’s economy and natural environment to climate change. Such analyses are required by various economic sectors and will support the implementation of public policy.\n\nMoreover, the need for the project was highlighted in a number of national-level documents. They include the 2017-2019 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Energy, Croatia’s Sixth National Communication and First Biennial Report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Law on National Spatial Data Infrastructure.\n\nSafeguarding lives\n\nContinuous monitoring of weather, climate and climate change using the new instruments will make it possible to provide earlier warnings of extreme or hazardous weather and natural disasters, to improve emergency response. It will support the development of climate change adaptation systems, exchange of information at international level, and sustainable development.\n\nAll current and archived meteorological data will be made publicly available on the website of the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service. The data will be of use to research institutions, non-governmental organisations and other users, especially people involved in research related to climate change and its impact on society."
