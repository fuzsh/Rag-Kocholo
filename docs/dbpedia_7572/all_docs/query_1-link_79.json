        "text": "Who we are?\n\nThe British International School of Zagreb (BISZ) started operating on September 02, 2013. It has now completed eleven full educational years as an International School. BISZ is the sister school to Kreativan razvoj Primary School, a private educational institution that has been operating for twenty four years. It is the oldest and one of the leading primary schools in Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nOver the past 29 years Kreativan razvoj Primary School has had foreign students from over 50 countries attend our school (USA, GB, Canada, Australia, Germany, Austria, Italy, Hungary, China, Russia, Syria,Lebanon, Turkey, Poland, Malaysia) to name a few. We have shown remarkable results in learning foreign languages, especially English, and suggestions made by the parents of these students in opening an International School were one of the key reasons for the establishment of the British International School of Zagreb.\n\nIn the British International School of Zagreb, students work in small classes and we try to provide them with optimal conditions for the development of creativity and the discovery of their talents. The Primary Section follows the English National Curriculum alongside the inquiry based International Primary Curriculum (IPC). This is one of the fastest growing learning frameworks in the world that is used by over 80 countries and 1500 national and international schools.\n\nBISZ is proud of becoming the first Cambridge International School in Croatia which offers a Cambridge Secondary (IGCSE) and Cambridge Advanced (International AS and A Level) qualification. Successful completion of these programmes enables students to enrol into any University in the world (including all eight Universities from Ivy League to top European, Commonwealth, and Asian Universities etc).\n\nThe school day begins at 9.00 and ends at 16.35 from Monday to Thursday; we conclude the day at 15.00 on Fridays. Lessons last for 45 minutes and the school timetable includes a combination of compulsory and elective subjects. All extra-curricular activities including study time and sports activities (basketball, table tennis, soccer, yoga, gymnastics and swimming) are scheduled in the afternoons. The day is divided by three meals which are served in our very own kitchen and school dining hall. Students arrive to school using public or organised transport.\n\nThe school and its surrounding area are under 24-hour electronic surveillance and a security guard is on site. This safety aspect is of crucial importance to parents who choose to enrol their children in our school. School uniforms are compulsory from Kindergarten and in this way we protect our children from the pitfalls of consumer society.\n\nBISZ is a place where all students can build on their learning experiences in order to prepare them for the next phase of their lives. The feel around the school is purely international with over 50 nationalities being heard throughout the hallways, on the playgrounds or in our new boarding school, yet all bound by the language of English and the British model of education. The need to develop each student's potential is at the very essence of our ethos. By gaining a formal British Education in Zagreb, the doors to a better future in the heart of the EU is a great stepping stone to success. No matter where our students come from, a global atmosphere is well established at BISZ whether it be your home or host country."
