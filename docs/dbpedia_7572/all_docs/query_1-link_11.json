        "text": "The Copernicus services on Atmosphere Monitoring (CAMS) and Climate Change (C3S), in collaboration with the Croatian Ministry of the Environment and the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological service organise a two-days workshop in Zagreb, Croatia to learn more about the products and uses of data and information from these two Copernicus services. The meeting is to start on Tuesday 13th November at 10:00 a.m. and end on Wednesday 14th November at 15:00 p.m.\n\nCopernicus is an EU funded earth observation programme designed to provide data and information freely and openly through six services to tackle environmental challenges and stimulate innovation and economic growth. Copernicus is the European Unionâ€™s flagship Earth observation programme. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides continuous data and information on air quality, atmospheric composition, and climate change. The Copernicus Climate Change (C3S) delivers operational data and access to several climate indicators and climate indices on a range of topics and sectoral areas. C3S and CAMS are both implemented by ECMWF on behalf of the European Commission.\n\nWorkshop outline\n\nThe Copernicus User Workshop is addressed to Croatian governmental officers and experts interested to understand better the capabilities the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\n\nThe User Workshop will bring a unique opportunity to be acquainted with the Copernicus available products and data, to meet in person members of the CAMS and C3S teams and to interact with existing users of the services and learn from their experiences.\n\nThe Copernicus workshop in Croatia will help to identify the needs of the local administration and reflect how the Croatian private sector and the environmental community can benefit from Copernicus services for public and private applications focusing on Green Growth and Smart City development. Topics include weather and climate modelling, air pollution, hazard forecasting, sectoral benefits, impact-based predictions and adaptation strategies at the local level, and the effective communication of air quality and climate science to the general public as well as the media.\n\nDuring the workshop\n\nCAMS and C3S teams will describe the services, the delivery options and the user feedback mechanisms;\n\nCAMS and C3S users will share their experiences of using Copernicus products and services;\n\nparticipants will have the opportunity to tell the CAMS and C3S teams what they might need from Copernicus, thereby shaping the future development of the services.\n\nImportant information\n\nPlease register your participation by 15th October 2018.\n\nHotel Dubrovnik have reserved rooms for Copernicus Users Workshop participants. For those who intended to stay in Hotel Dubrovnik reservation form can be found here.\n\nRegistration for the Copernicus User Workshop is free; refreshments will be provided. CAMS and C3S will provide coffee and lunch during the day, while participants are expected to cover their own cost for travel and accommodation. We are very thankful to the Meteorological and Hydrological Service of Croatia for hosting the meeting at Hotel Dubrovnik.\n\nWho is using CAMS and C3S?\n\nCAMS and C3S data is already being used by government officials, policy-makers and local planners, scientists and academics, as well as business and industry.\n\nExisting CAMS and C3S users include\n\ngovernment bodies using forecasts and data for policy development,\n\nlocal air quality forecast providers using CAMS forecasts to determine expected air quality at the edge of their local forecast domain,\n\nacademic institutions using CAMS and C3S data for research,\n\ncommercial organizations generating revenue streams by adapting the free CAMS and C3S products."
