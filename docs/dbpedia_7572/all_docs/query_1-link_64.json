        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAman Sehrawat, the only male wrestler from India to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics, secured a decisive 12-0 victory in the 57kg freestyle category against North Macedonia's Vladimir Egorov. Despite a challenging personal history, including the loss of both parents at a young age, Aman has risen to prominence through resilience and hard work. With notable achievements such as medals at the Asian Games and Wrestling Championships, Aman now advances to the quarterfinals, symbolizing hope and perseverance.\n\nAman Sehrawat, a 21-year-old wrestler from Birohar, Haryana, has made a significant mark on international wrestling by advancing to the Paris 2024 Olympics semifinals in the men's 57kg freestyle category. Sehrawat, who earned his Olympic spot by defeating his idol Ravi Dahiya, showcased exceptional skill by winning his first two matches by technical superiority.\n\nDominating Performance Against European Rival\n\nIn his Olympic debut, Sehrawat faced Macedonian wrestler Vladimir Egorov in the round of 16. He dominated the contest, winning by technical superiority with a score of 10-0 on August 8. Following this, he encountered former world champion Zelimkhan Abakarov in the quarterfinals and again prevailed by technical superiority, this time with a score of 12-0.\n\nSehrawat's back-to-back commanding performances have placed him just one victory away from securing at least a silver medal. However, his semifinal opponent, Rei Higuchi of Japan, presents a formidable challenge. Higuchi, the top seed, won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and has also achieved a silver in the world championships, along with a gold medal in the 61kg category.\n\nWho is Aman Sehrawat: The Journey of a Young Wrestling Prodigy\n\nBorn on July 16, 2003, Sehrawat came to prominence after securing a bronze medal in the 57 kg category at the 2022 Asian Games. In April 2023, he clinched a gold medal at the Asian Wrestling Championships held in Astana, Kazakhstan. His career, though young, is already decorated with numerous accolades, including gold medals at the 2024 Zagreb and 2022 Almaty Grand Prix, and the 2022 Pontevedra U23 World Championships.\n\nAman's journey to the Paris Olympics is one of resilience and determination. Born in Jhajjar, Haryana, Aman faced immense personal challenges early in life. At just 10 years old, he lost his mother to depression, followed by the death of his father a year later. \"After losing my parents, I thought my world had ended,\" Aman has said in previous interviews, highlighting the emotional toll these events took on him.\n\nFollowing these tragedies, Aman and his younger sister, Puja Sehrawat, were taken in by their uncle, Sudhir Sehrawat, and a maternal aunt. His grandfather, Mangeram Sehrawat, played a critical role in his upbringing, helping him overcome severe depression. \"My grandfather was my anchor. He encouraged me to pursue wrestling and kept me going when I wanted to give up,\" Aman has shared.\n\nRising Through the Wrestling Ranks\n\nDespite the early hardships, Aman found solace in wrestling, a sport he began training in under the guidance of coach Lalit Kumar. His dedication to the sport soon bore fruit when he won his first National Championship title in 2021. Since then, Aman’s career has been on an upward trajectory. In 2022, he secured a bronze medal in the 57kg category at the Asian Games, followed by a gold medal at the 2023 Asian Wrestling Championships held in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nAman’s success continued into 2024, where he clinched the gold medal at the Zagreb Open wrestling tournament, defeating China's Zou Wanhao with a perfect score of 10-0. Reflecting on his journey, Aman has often emphasized the importance of hard work and perseverance. \"Wrestling is not just a sport for me; it’s a way to honor my family's legacy,\" he once remarked.\n\nOnward to the semi-finals\n\nAman Sehrawat qualified for the semi-finals with another stunning display in the men's 57kg quarter-finals on Thursday at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAman stormed into the semi-finals to have a chance of competing for the medal with a technical superiority 12-0 win over Albania's Zelimkhan Abakanov.\n\nAman will compete with Japan's Rei Higuchi later on Thursday to fight for a chance to play for India's first gold medal at the Paris Olympics.\n\nHe got his first point in the bout due to passivity from the Albanian wrestler. He went on to complete a takedown to take a 3-0 lead in the first period.\n\nIn the second period, he outplayed Abakanov with his remarkable skillset to storm into the final four.\n\nWhen is Aman Sehrawat Semi-final match?\n\nAman's crucial semifinal match against Higuchi is scheduled for 9.45 pm IST.\n\nHis journey at the Olympics has been a source of inspiration, reflecting not just his physical strength but also his mental fortitude.\n\nAs the only male wrestler from India to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics, Aman Sehrawat carries the hopes of a nation and continues to prove that perseverance in the face of adversity can lead to greatness.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nBank stocks are underperforming.
