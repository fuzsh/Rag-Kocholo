        "text": "3.3. Comparative Study\n\nPrevious scientific studies published before 2010, indicate that AFs mainly contaminate agricultural products in tropical and subtropical regions (Africa, Australia, South and Southeast Asia), in which the local weather goes in favour of Aspergillus species colonisation and aflatoxin synthesis, while in Europe AFs occur less frequently [34,35,36,37]. However, in recent years, mainly due to the climate changes, AFs have more and more frequently contaminated various agricultural products in Europe [16,17,18,19,20,21,38,39,40]. Research shows that the interaction of climate changes, such as an increased carbon dioxide concentration, temperature rise, and extreme changes in length of dry and rainy periods, have a significant impact on fungal growth and the occurrence of AFs [41,42]. Therefore, with the aim of introducing a comparative insight into the implication of climate changes on the occurrence of AFs in maize from Serbia and Croatia, the results from available studies are investigated.\n\nIn the previous decade, Serbia and Croatia, as almost every European country located in central and southeast Europe, also faced climate changes followed by repeated weather extremes. In some years, climate changes mirrored in a warming trend characterised with an accelerated temperature increase, the absence of precipitation for several months, and droughts (2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2021), while in other (2010, 2014 and 2019) abundant rainfalls that caused overflows and flooding were seen. In the previous decade, a warming trend that brings increased air temperatures was registered almost every year. It is well known that frequent heat disturbances may affect human health, agricultural production, food, water supplies, and many other areas vital for economic and social well-being. Drastic agricultural consequences, and economic losses incurred due to, the prolonged droughts and record summer temperatures, were already documented in both Serbia and Croatia. During the last decade, climate changes registered in both countries already manifested their influence through significant challenges to, and difficulties in, agriculture, food production, and food safety. In the agricultural sector, climate changes followed by increasing temperatures and reduced water availability have the greatest impact on, and the greatest consequences for, crop production. In light of the substantial climate change, the production, yields, quality, and safety of maize in Serbia and Croatia, are vastly challenged. At the same time, weather extremes are directly responsible for the decrease in maize yields and its increased contamination with certain mycotoxins, such as AFs [16,17,18,19,20,21,43,44,45,46,47]. The results of the studies conducted in the last decade indicate that AFs frequently occur in certain parts of Europe. In all of these studies, the authors highlighted climate changes, warming trend and prolonged droughts as the main reasons behind the increased AFs prevalence and contamination frequency. Among agricultural products of Serbia and Croatia, the greatest influence of climate change on the prevalence of AFs was noticed in maize [16,17,18,19,20,21,22].\n\nrepresents an overview of the occurrence of AFs and AFB1 in maize collected in Serbia and Croatia in 2009–2021, respectively. The occurrence data are shown as a percentage of contaminated samples in which the determined content was greater than LOQs of the applied methods. In , data on the following Serbian maize-growing seasons were summarized: 2009–2011 [16]; 2012–2015, [17]; and 2016–2017 [19]. As for Croatia, the 2009–2013 maize-growing seasons are embraced [20,21]. Data earlier unpublished and data obtained in this study are included as well.\n\nAs can be seen from , AFs were not detected in Serbia neither AFB1 in Croatia in four (2009–2011, 2014) out of thirteen years under this review. In Serbia in three years (2016, 2018, and 2020), and in Croatia in two years (2016 and 2018), presence of investigated aflatoxins was registered in less than or around 10% of maize samples. Contrary to this, considerably higher levels of aflatoxin contamination of 72%, 24%, 37%, 31%, and 84% were detected in maize samples from Serbia harvested in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2021, respectively. Based on the obtained results, it can be assumed that Serbia becomes susceptible to AFs presence-evoked problems, since AFs were detected in Serbian maize in nine out of thirteen years embraced by this review, in five out of these nine years even in high prevalence rates ranging from 24% to 84%. These substantial deviations from AFs occurrence patterns, seen in maize samples collected in different years, can be explained by the fact that in the thirteen year review period Serbia had experienced climate changes. As for Croatia, it can be concluded that the percentage of positive samples uncovered in the referent period was lower than in Serbia, but the occurrence of AFB1 in the last thirteen years was still significant, with the maximum of 40% of positives in 2021 and 38% of positives in 2012. While the occurrence of AFB1 evidenced in 2012 was slightly lower compared to 2021 and even more so to other years under this review, it is important to emphasise that in 2012 this mycotoxin was present in maize in extreme content [21], never recorded in Croatia either before or later.\n\nThe analysis of Palmer Drought Severity Index descriptive of the summer months of the years, in which the prevalence of AFs in maize was higher, is shown in for Serbia and in for Croatia.\n\nFrom and , it can be noted that a higher prevalence of AFs in Serbia was detected in years characterised with more pronounced droughts. In June, July, and August 2012, extreme droughts were registered, downsized to moderate in September. Daily temperatures during these summer months were very often close to 40 °C; at some locations, the temperature deviated from the average by even 6 °C. Heat waves and a considerably lower level of precipitation in comparison with 1981–2010, mirrored in a low moisture reserve. The amount of precipitation increased in late July, but unfortunately more than half of the maize crops were already damaged. Lević et al. [48] reported that extremely stressful agrometeorological conditions recorded in the summer of 2012 went in favour of A. flavus, so that its representation rose to 95%. Furthermore, drought enhances the appearance of various pests, so that all these factors combined greatly influenced aflatoxin synthesis. As can be seen from the , in other years in which maize samples were also contaminated with AFs (2013, 2015, 2017, and 2021), extreme droughts were not recorded (2013 and 2015), or rarely appeared in certain months (2017 and 2021). In 2013, the weather was mainly described as normal, while in 2015 and 2017 dominated moderate and severe drought episodes. Based on these facts, it can be argued that differences in aflatoxin contamination levels are attributable to differences in drought occurrence frequencies. In these five years, the detected AFs content varied in the following descending order: 2012 > 2021 > 2017 > 2015 > 2013. In years with no drought periods (2009, 2010, 2011, 2014), AFs were not detected, or detected in less than 5% (2016) [16,17,18,19].\n\nUnfortunately, in each year in which AFs were detected in maize, AFM1 contaminated Serbian milk and dairy products. Dietary exposure to AFM1 in Serbia, coming as a result of milk consumption, was elaborated within the frame of several studies. Due to the high contamination frequency and high AFM1 concentrations in milk, certain age groups, especially children, were at high contamination and health risk. Due to the variability of AFB1 content in maize and consequently of AFM1 in milk across the sampling years, inter-annual exposure level differences were huge as well [16,17,18,19,49,50,51].\n\nDespite of the high aflatoxin contamination frequency, documented in five out of the last thirteen years, in Serbia these toxins received the greatest public attention in 2012 and 2013. At the time, the public was informed about AFs contamination of maize and milk through different media. Public concern grew rapidly due to a lot of easily accessible contradictory information offered by the media. In early 2013, Serbia faced the “aflatoxins crisis” followed by the protest of agricultural workers, the replacement of the Minister of Agriculture, several amendments to the Regulation governing the maximum level of AFM1 and AFB1, confusion among consumers, and decrease in purchase of milk and dairy products. The “aflatoxins crisis” was ultimately responsible for a significant economic loss (of about hundred million dollars). The results obtained in this study, as well as the results of our previous study, indicate that ten years after the “aflatoxins crisis” Serbia still faces aflatoxin-related problems [16,17,18,19,51,52,53].\n\nIn recent years, the presence of AFs and human exposure to these toxins raise a great concern in Serbia, since milk and maize are among the main foodstuffs, especially for children. Unfortunately, climate change predictions for this part of Europe indicate that warming trend favourable to Aspergillus species and aflatoxin synthesis will be continued in the future. Therefore, the agricultural sector in Serbia is facing a great challenge of rapidly growing food and feed contamination, which requires reinforced control strategies based on continuous monitoring, increasing investments, multidisciplinary approach, and education of all food chain participants, so as to minimize the presence of AFs in maize and consequently in the entire food and feed chain [52,53,54,55,56].\n\nAs for Croatia, previously registered weather changes characterized with heating trend, also manifested themselves in aflatoxin maize contamination. The Palmer Drought Severity Index ( ) values show that, in comparison with other years of the last decade, the weather in 2012 was extremely dry during all four months important for maize cultivation, resulting in the highest level of AFB1 maize contamination ever recorded in Croatia [21]. According to the PDSI, the weather in the same period of the year 2013 was normal, that in 2015 moderately to slightly wet, whereas in 2017 the weather in June and July was normal and slightly dry in August.\n\nGiven that elevated aflatoxin content are usually associated with humidity and temperature as the factors critical for fungi formation and thus AFs production [20,56], the results obtained by this study can be attributed to these factors, as well. High levels of AFB1 maize contamination seen in Croatia during 2012 and 2013 were mainly associated with weather, given that the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service recorded the summer of 2012 as extremely warm and dry. Droughts and high temperatures seen during maize growth and harvest encourage the growth of Aspergillus species, with AFB1 production in the optimal temperature range of 25 to 42 °C [5]. Exactly the same weather, recorded in 2012 in the Republic of Croatia, caused the contamination of maize and cattle feed mixtures with AFB1 and, consequently, AFM1 contamination of milk coming from dairy cattle farms [20,21,57]. Bilandžić et al. [58] reported that extreme droughts witnessed in 2016 to 2022 contributed to the development of toxigenic fungi and the increased frequency of AFM1 milk contamination in Croatia.\n\nBesides the influence on fungal growth and aflatoxin synthesis, recent climate changes are also recognized as the main factors responsible for the reduction of maize yields in both Serbia and Croatia. In Serbia, in years 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2021 in which AFs were detected frequently, the maize yield dropped below the ten-year average of around 6.2 Mt/ha. The historical maize yield minimum (of 3 Mt/ha) was registered in the year 2012, i.e., in the same year in which the highest occurrence of AFs was observed, while in years in which the weather was not dry maize yields very often exceeded 8 Mt/ha. The reduction of maize yields directly downsizes the amount of the exported maize. On average, Serbia exports 2.1 Mt of maize annually, varying from 0.6 Mt in 2012 to 3.1 Mt in 2019 and 2020 [59]. The influence of weather changes on maize yields was also noticed in Croatia in recent years. Maize yields varied from 4.3 Mt/ha in the year 2012 to 9.0 Mt/ha in 2019 [60]. It can be assumed that in both Serbia and Croatia recent global warming and more frequent droughts cause significant damage to maize production. A decrease in maize yields should be considered as an issue of the outmost significance, since in these two countries maize represents one of the most important agricultural items. About 40% of the total planted crop area in Serbia is populated by maize, mostly used for feed production (80%), while the remaining amount is intended for human consumption and food industry. With the ten-year average of 2.1 million tons intended for export, Serbia is ranked among the leading maize exporters both on the European and the global scale. However, in Serbia maize is largely grown on rainfed fields, since only 5–9% of the maize-growing land is irrigated. Maize is also one of the major field crops grown on arable lands of Croatia. Unfortunately, as in Serbia, Croatian maize is also mainly grown on an unirrigated land. Some authors claim that in Croatia weather characteristics, especially rainfall and temperature regimes represent the factor most responsible for maize yield oscillations over years. It is well known that maize needs a large amount of water due to its large vegetative mass, high yields, and long growing season; therefore, attention should be focused on irrigation improvements, especially in view of recent heat waves and droughts emerging during maize-growing seasons. Recent global warming and more frequent droughts have already caused a considerably damage to maize production in Serbia and Croatia [43,59,60]."
