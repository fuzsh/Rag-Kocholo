        "text": "Organizational setup\n\nTo better understand the effects of the Zagreb earthquake and challenges faced in the immediate post-earthquake period, it is necessary to clarify existing enablers and barriers that have particular impacts on the resilience of the urbanized communities in Croatia. The main competences at the state level include overall legislation and execution, and security and defense. The municipalities assume responsibilities of local importance such as organization of settlement and housing, spatial and urban planning, utility services, primary health protection, protection and improvement of natural environment, fire safety and civil protection (Driver 2014). In this respect, the Zagreb Emergency Management Office EMO considers the earthquake preparedness on top of their priority list (EMO 2016).\n\nNumerous activities related to post-earthquake emergency response and recovery situations, organization and education of intervention units, formation of urban search and rescue teams, field exercises, etc., contribute to increased resilience in case of natural disasters. The Croatian Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction within the Directorate of Civil Protection of the Ministry of Interior can be highlighted as a positive example (DRRP url). Its main objective is to foster continued cooperation between political, operational and scientific stakeholders to enable transfer and harmonization of knowledge, propose informed solutions, and adopt and ensure implementation of guidelines aiming at overall disaster risk reduction. Within this comprehensive system, the Zagreb Faculty of Civil Engineering was assigned as the lead scientific institution for activities related to seismic risk assessment. Experts from the faculty participated in training and civil protection exercises within various European projects (e.g., Matilda project url, Cascade’19 exercise url, etc.). As part of the Croatian technical-tactical support team, a few experts also participated in inspections of buildings safety following the 2019 Albania earthquake (Atalić et al. 2020a). The acquired expertise and knowledge proved essential during the March 2020 post-earthquake damage reconnaissance phase in Zagreb.\n\nThe public safety framework in Croatia is relatively well set, yet its capacity to cope in an emergency or disaster of higher proportions revealed insufficient. The Zagreb 2020 earthquake has helped identify certain gaps and needs for improvement in the response capacity and in the communication and synchronization between the state and municipal command chains. In the scope of their natural hazards risk assessment study, Atalić and Hak (2014) evaluated the impacts from a series of potential disasters in Croatia with the objective to prepare a common ground for comparison of respective risk management policies. The impacts from seismic scenarios exceeded by far potential losses from other disasters. The potentially disastrous consequences of strong earthquakes, beyond the criteria adopted by the European Commission, were further emphasized by Atalić et al. (2018). All these analyses recognized that Croatia lags behind countries with similar seismic settings, e.g., Italy, and that it should strengthen the organization of the emergency system. The authors recommended that the focus should be on activities that can be achieved relatively rapidly and without significant investments, e.g., implementation of operational policies and practices such as training exercises, development of methods for long-term and near-real time prediction of potential impacts and techniques for post-earthquake damage inspections. The ultimate goal would be to help reduce seismic risk by identification and application of feasible retrofit strategies for older buildings and strengthening of bridges, utility systems and other essential infrastructure components. The ongoing energy renovation and upgrading program for existing buildings has been identified as a potential path to follow (Stepinac et al. 2020). The need of a centralized comprehensive building and infrastructure database with linkages to the existing scattered databases and information was also pointed out as a major enabler to a more efficient emergency planning system. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics was invited to play important role in planning and acquisition of this strategic information.\n\nEmergency response\n\nThe March 2020 Zagreb earthquake occurred at the time of a sluggish economic growth in Croatia and amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The schools were officially closed since March 16th and social distancing measures were already put in place by the Croatian Civil Protection Headquarters. To contain the spread of the virus, people were urged via public media to avoid public gatherings and stay apart from each other. On March 19, three days before the earthquake, all public, religious and sport events were banned. The operation of services such as restaurants, shops and sport and recreation centers was suspended, with the exception of grocery stores and pharmacies. A temporary ban on border crossings was also introduced. The day before the earthquake, to avoid contacts, presence was limited in the streets and other outdoor public places where larger number of people gather or pass through at the same time, e.g., squares, bus stations, waterfronts, parks, etc., making situation even more unbearable and adding to the stress of the pandemic. A number of employees were advised to take annual leave and left Zagreb. It was estimated later that these measures, although unpopular at first sight, proved beneficial at saving lives.\n\nZagreb was much deserted on that early Sunday morning, a fortunate circumstance given the aftermath of the earthquake. Immediately after the mains hock, the Civil protection services were activated for emergency action. The members of the Zagreb EMO, the Directorate of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior and of the Zagreb Faculty of Civil Engineering convened establishing the Crisis headquarters for operational management at the EMO (Fig. ). Fire and communal services together with units of the Croatian army were called upon to maintain order and start clearing the city center and surrounding streets. Fortunately, the earthquake did not cause any major collapse of buildings or transportation facilities that would fully occupy the emergency services. The focus was therefore put on the assessment of damage and safety of affected buildings and infrastructure. Since there was no previously established inspection plan at city level, the technical experts self-organized using their experience and previous collaborations and under the guidance of experts from the Faculty of Civil Engineering.\n\nAs the scale of the destruction was unknown in the first hours all engineers who had undergone exercises and training for post-earthquake inspection of buildings were called upon by private calls. One of the first actions was to send them to lead the inspection of hospital buildings in the historic downtown, already identified as critical for post-earthquake recovery (Šavor Novak et al. 2019).\n\nIn parallel, at the EMO headquarters was initiated the fine adjustment of the initial safety and usability assessment methodology. Promptly, a general call was sent for mobilization of all engineers with expertise in the (1991–1995) post-war reconstruction or with knowledge related to traditional masonry structures. The Croatian Chamber of Civil Engineers was instrumental in providing the necessary support. On the first day alone, over 150 engineers voluntary responded to the call and started the inspection and assessment of building damage. The protective equipment (helmets, vests, etc.) required for safety during entry into damaged buildings together with masks, disposable gloves and disinfectants for Covid-19 were distributed to all first responders in the field. Programming of a mobile application (Collector for ArcGIS) for acquisition of field observations was initiated at the end of the first day; it was then tested the next day and put into operation a day later. The form was created according to the Italian (Baggio et al. 2007) and Greek (Anagnostopoulos et al. 2004) experience taking into account local building features and observed characteristic damage to gable walls, roofs and chimneys. All data was stored in a GIS based database for efficient information flow in both directions. For example, experts in the field could also retrieve data on the sick and self-isolated people due to Covid 19, important regarding the safety and limiting the epidemics spread.\n\nIn the first week, the number of volunteers rose to over 500 including volunteers-climbers for work at heights (e.g., roofs, chimneys). The emergency calls were monitored to ensure timely response and inspection in the order of arrival of requests. Requests for inspection were received also by e-mails and via the web page promptly established by the City for that purpose. Being rapidly overwhelmed, the frontline workers had to be reorganized, thereby responding on emergency basis and depending on the importance of the observed damage; it was already known that the hardest hit areas were the historic downtown and the epicentral neighborhoods of Markuševec and Čučerje. The damage assessment teams consisted of at least two structural engineers and/or architects with the number increasing with the size and occupancy of the building. Creating teams of experienced engineers, especially those who had undergone education and exercises, with younger fellows contributed to knowledge transfer and an increased inspection rate.\n\nPost-earthquake inspection\n\nThe work on post-earthquake damage inspection and assessment was coordinated by the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning in cooperation with numerous partners from the government and the industry. The inspection of residential buildings was conducted visually and was more detailed in case of older masonry buildings and buildings that suffered apparent structural damage. Decisions on the short-term usability were made in discussion between the team members based on the current damage state and considering potential behavior of the structure in case a stronger shaking should have occurred during the still ongoing aftershock sequence. Decisions on usability of critical infrastructure (e.g., bridges) and of essential facilities (e.g., hospitals, schools) were made in agreement with the headquarters and people responsible for the institution. In both cases, the engineering experience and intuition were decisive for the evaluation of the safety and accessibility.\n\nThe first objective of the inspection was to identify and implement urgent measures to reduce to a maximum any potential risk of debris falling on neighboring buildings, sidewalks or driveways and other threats to human lives (e.g., collapsed chimneys, damaged façades and architectural finishing). The municipal representatives immediately warned people to beware of this potential threat and not to walk close to buildings. It was then important to restrain access to damaged buildings, to temporarily take care of people in need and to obtain as soon as possible a preliminary insight into the extent of the damage. Data collected in the field was practically immediately available to the fire and communal services, which then took appropriate measures of clearing and removal of debris. In addition, access to the database and insight to the buildings damage and usability reports was allowed to all relevant City services, e.g., firefighters, communal service, city offices, etc., and governmental departments depending on the level of authority. This allowed smooth exchange of information and transparency through daily briefings via public media.\n\nThe training given to a number of construction experts with focus on the typical damages observed in the field, proved to be crucial for the quality of inspections. First organized in-person at the EMO headquarters, given the pandemic circumstances, the training was later offered via internet together with accompanying handbook and webinars (CCEE url). The Croatian Centre for Earthquake Engineering CCEE website was intended to provide the necessary information to inspection teams in the field, to allow for a live monitoring of the status of inspected applications and was also used to prepare and educate citizens on the methods of building inspections. In addition, three WhatsApp communication groups proved effective for sharing essential information between field teams, including further training of younger engineers.\n\nThe site inspections encountered a number of unexpected difficulties. Some of the challenges faced by the field teams and crisis headquarters were frequent double-requests for inspection on the same address (Fig. ), reaction of residents that were not familiar with the methods of inspections, residents that choose to stay home even when the building was red-tagged, conflicting and confusing information reported by the media, etc. Given the shortage of protective equipment on the market, it had to be procured in different ways, e.g., through numerous donations. Occasional shortages of protective equipment left frontline workers ill equipped rising concerns among the population. Due to closed borders and a ban on movement outside the place of residence, many engineers and specialists from other parts of Croatia and neighboring countries were unable to come to Zagreb to provide assistance. In addition, with the exception of external damage observations to roof structures and chimneys, modern reconnaissance technologies (drones, satellite images, etc.) could not be applied to the full extent, since most of the damage occurred inside the buildings (Stepinac et al. 2020).\n\nThe successful development and implementation of a feasible action plan for post-earthquake inspections was a challenge from the engineering point of view. Such plan did not exist before the earthquake and timely communication between the relevant institutions was particularly challenging in the first days of the post-earthquake activities. This also required a numerous adaptations of the GIS database to be able to respond to various needs (e.g., addition of necessary attributes, allowing access of different institutions to different attributes, etc.). The permanent communication between government and municipal representatives with citizens also revealed to be important for fine adjustments of the inspection activities.\n\nPerformance of residential buildings\n\nThe old masonry housing units in the historic city centre were by far the most affected building type by the earthquake. Damage was most often caused by the lack of seismic conception, uneven stiffness distribution of vertical elements, flexible wooden floor systems which could not provide diaphragmatic behavior at the floor level, poor quality of the material (especially mortar), spandrels with low-quality of construction which affects the poor connection between the walls, and in particular the poor connection between mutually orthogonal load-bearing walls and contacts with the floor structure. In addition, frequent unprofessional reconstructions also affected their seismic performance. The most common observable external damage was the collapse of chimneys, gable attic walls and other cantilever parts at the top, and damage to the wooden roofs. In some cases, there was a significant separation of the gable wall along the height of the building and partial collapse of the façade wall. What could not be observed from the street view were damages to load-bearing and partition walls, and cracks at the contacts occurring mainly inside the buildings. Rarely, during the lateral movement, the wooden joists were completely pulled out from their sockets in the bearing walls and the floor structures collapsed.\n\nDamage and collapse of chimneys: Much of the damage to roofs and attics were caused by the partial or complete collapse of chimneys (Fig. ). Made of solid brick and mortar, they are not resistant to seismic forces. Chimneys are often free-standing starting from the attic floor, sometimes more than 5 m high, and only in rare cases they are fixed to the roof structure. Damage occurred mainly at the junction with the roof or with the attic floor structure (Crnogorac et al 2020). These types of chimneys make part of the Zagreb cultural heritage that was intentionally preserved, although it could easily be supposed, as it was the case, that their damage would frequently cause damage to roof structures and other building components and threaten occupants and people in the streets.\n\nDamage and collapse of attic gable walls: In addition to chimneys, the most common damage was the partial or complete collapse of the gable attic walls (Fig. ). They are built as ordinary, mainly 15 cm thick masonry walls and usually not adequately supported with out-of-plane fixation to the roof structure. In certain cases, unsupported walls orthogonal to the attic gable walls were damaged, such as the longitudinal walls of the front and rear façades (Crnogorac et al. 2020). Additional weakness comes from the fact that the attic walls are not properly fixed to the floor structure; the wooden joists, spaced approximately 80 cm apart, are embedded in the longitudinal bearing walls without any structural connection to the attic walls.\n\nSeparation of gable walls: In severe cases, in addition to the local collapse of parts of the attic gable walls, a separation of gable walls developed along the entire height of the building or across a few storeys (Fig. ). The reason was again the poor connection with the orthogonal bearing walls and with the floor structure resting on them. Therefore, the gable walls are not built to support much of the vertical load, which contributes to their poor resistance to lateral forces and the resulting differential out-of-plane movement. As a consequence, characteristic vertical cracks appeared in the orthogonal wall and horizontal cracks in the ceilings, mostly at the junction between the floor structure with and the gable wall. Increased separation can lead to overturning and collapse of the gable wall and may pose a danger to the whole structure and to the neighboring buildings as was often the case with tags N1 (unusable due to external risks).\n\nRoof damage: The most common cause of damage to the roof structure was incurred from collapse of chimneys, gable walls and other poorly supported elements above the roof surface. These represent mainly local types of damage (Fig. ). The roof structures are usually of poor framing and diaphragm resistance and, due to lack of maintenance and wear with time, they provide unsatisfactory support to chimneys and attic gable walls. In certain cases, the entire roof structure sustained a permanent lateral displacement requiring a complete reconstruction.\n\nDamage to bearing walls: Masonry load-bearing walls were most vulnerable to in-plane shear and out-of-plane bending culminating in an abrupt collapse at ultimate deformation. The deterioration of the structural material (brick and mortar) due to the long service life of these buildings (over 100 years), often poor maintenance and lack of façade finishing on some external walls, further endangers the stability of these structural elements. Typical diagonal cracks were commonly observed due to exceedance of the in-plane load-bearing capacity (shear strength) of the masonry walls. These were mostly stair-stepped joint shear failures (Fig. ) due to the poor quality of the mortar, which has lost its mechanical properties. As this situation was widespread in damaged buildings in the city center, costs for repair and strengthening of the brick walls account for considerable part of the economic loss.\n\nNon-bearing partition walls are mainly 15 cm or even only 7 cm thick. They are supported by wooden joists and are often not uniformly distributed in the vertical direction, what was expected after many adaptations and reconstructions. In case of stronger seismic loading, their contribution to the rigidity of the building is not substantial. As well, due to the low resistance but significant initial stiffness, they are unable to mirror the dynamic deformation of the entire structure and crack regularly. On the other hand, the partition walls constrain out-of-plane displacements of the orthogonal load-bearing walls to some amount, which is of importance to especially long walls. Significant number of damaged partition walls was observed in the direction perpendicular to the bearing walls; a few examples are presented in Fig. .\n\nCracks in the ceilings (floor structure): Cracks parallel to the direction of the wooden joists are most often due to the displacement caused by bending between the joists. Such cracks are within the plaster zone and represent seldom a structural problem as there are rarely tensile forces perpendicular to the joists. Due to the weight of the plaster, this type of damage may pose a threat to the occupants. Other cracks appear at the contact of the wall and the ceiling structure due to the relative displacements between these two elements. Basically, if there is no separation and tilting of the wall, it is again only a matter of cracking of the plaster itself as its tensile strength was exceeded locally (Fig. ).\n\nDamage to lintel and vault sections: Another common form of observed damage was cracking of the lintel and vault sections (Fig. ). In masonry buildings, openings are often bridged with horizontal wooden, brick or arched lintels. Diagonal cracks in the lintels were sometimes seen in the newer reinforced concrete buildings as well. When the cracks are relatively narrow and of limited extent, they do not necessarily mean any structural failure. However, larger cracks in some cases with material falling off indicate heavy damage to masonry lintels. This type of damage is dangerous and need to be secured against collapsing. Diagonal cracks in the lintel section are due to the exceedance of the shear strength. On the other hand, approximately vertical cracks in vaults are caused by stability disturbance and triggered by exceedance of the tensile strength.\n\nDamage to stairways: Stairways were often damaged in the masonry buildings, where relatively rigid core of thick masonry is found around the staircase (Fig. ). The older cantilever type of staircase has been mostly replaced and stairs are now often supported by steel girders anchored in the landing zone. This type of damage refers mainly to structural damage in surrounding bearing/landing walls or is due to differential movement between adjacent floors and separation of structural elements. In order to render stairs usable, it was necessary first to clear and prevent additional debris falling in the stairwell.\n\nDamage to buildings in blocks: As mentioned earlier, the buildings in the historic downtown are built in relatively regular blocks of 5 or more buildings of varying dimensions, 100 × 50 m in average (Fig. ). The sidewalls of these buildings are adjacent to each other and, although there are no common gable walls, they often lean against without any partition. Due to frequent protrusions for drains and/or used water piping, windows, or due to various interventions over time, the gable walls of adjacent buildings are often wedged or joined together. It can therefore be assumed that buildings that are not located at the corner of the block behave more or less as interconnected. The width of the building determines the spanning direction of the floor joists. In general, the floor slabs are supported by the longitudinal walls parallel to the street. This is the stronger load-bearing direction for lateral seismic forces, whereas in the perpendicular weaker direction the stairwell, separation and/or gable walls are unsuited to support significant loads.\n\nThe concept of ‘block of buildings’ appeared to be less vulnerable to earthquake loading contributing to fewer damage observations during inspections (Fig. ). The structural characteristics at the contact with the neighboring buildings, however, remain uncertain and there is a complex interaction in the dynamic response. This further complicated the identification of the cause of damage. Buildings at the corners are generally built with load-bearing walls in both directions, a system which provided relatively high seismic resistance. Problems were noticed in buildings that exceed the height of the rest of the buildings, a common construction practice in Zagreb. There, the damage was concentrated to the prominent \"free\" floors. Buildings without a neighbor on one side were also susceptible to earthquake damage. Such was the case when the building row was interrupted due to demolition of dilapidated buildings thereby freeing-up space for car parking and access. Damage to these buildings was mainly observed on the free side walls, and occasionally in certain walls within the floor plan and walls facing the neighbor.\n\nDamage to buildings in the epicentral area: two of the Zagreb neighborhoods are located in the epicentral area, Markuševac and Čučerje. The residential buildings in these areas were built mainly after WW2, most of them with a single residential occupancy. The structural type is mostly brick masonry, reinforced concrete frame with infill brick walls, or a hybrid system without any construction standard. The light roofing material is generally placed or loosely tied at the top edge of the walls. The floor slabs are mainly of prefabricated composite elements resting on the bearing walls, rarely of wooden joists and, in the last decades, of reinforced concrete slabs. The foundation consists of a continuous poured concrete footing and foundation wall or of stone masonry in case of older houses. The brick infill or bearing walls have significant in-plane stiffness, which contributes to the overall stiffness and to reduced deflection to lateral loads. As a result, diagonal cracks were typically observed in all damaged buildings. Damage was most frequent in buildings not properly designed, which have undergone interventions in the structural system (reconstruction, adaptation, enlargement) and/or which were built illegally without the required building permit and safety inspections. Illegal construction is a problem that plagues communities across Croatia. More than 100,000 applications for legalization were recently submitted in the Zagreb region alone. In Fig. are shown several examples of typical damage to those buildings."
