        "text": "That is without a doubt the first thing you need to do. You need to choose a skill which will allow you to make money online. The goal here is not to learn as many things as possible, but to focus on one or two things and be good at them. Specialization is the key word!\n\nIf the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that life is unpredictable. No matter where you live or travel, always leave enough money in your account to return home or for unexpected expenses so that you can quickly leave your current place of residence if necessary.\n\nWhether it is recreation, walking, having a drink with new friends or going on a weekend trip to a nearby destination – you have to have time for yourself! In fact, try to be completely offline for a few hours every day, it will allow you to relax and clear your mind. You must recharge your batteries often!\n\nDon’t rely on just one source of income. On the contrary, try to make money from three to four sources each month. It is not unusual for a digital nomad to have two or three jobs at the same time, for example copywriting and product or service sales. This way you can definitely increase your monthly budget which will allow you to have the things you value most – freedom and working on your own conditions. In Zagreb, you can have a great life with not too large monthly income by digital nomad standards.\n\nCredit card payments offer numerous benefits to digital nomads. For example, opportunities to participate in various internal card clubs to collect points. Don’t forget to do a thorough research on the advantages that using a particular card can offer you – sometimes it means access to a special lounge area at the airport, a free car rental or other similar service that can come in handy on your trip.\n\nEvery digital nomad who comes to Zagreb and Croatia should learn a few words of the Croatian language, and try to participate in activities that are typical of Zagreb and the environment in which they work. The European Football Championship is a great opportunity to put on a red and white checkerboard T-shirt and support the Croatian national football team over a beer surrounded by locals.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget, look for a place to live that isn’t expensive. As for accommodation, it's usually smaller apartments or hostels that were left without guests during the pandemic. Many Croatian hotel companies have programs for digital nomads, which are extremely affordable.\n\nMost digital nomads “fail” already at this stage because their expenses are out of control. That is why it is important to set daily budgets. Set a realistic daily budget, which means the amount of money you are “allowed” to spend per day, both for basic expenses and for entertainment and travel.\n\nThe life of a digital nomad is not for everyone, but anyone can do it if they set their mind on it. Lack of courage is what keeps people from living their dreams. The moment you really decide to step out of your comfort zone and try something completely new is the moment you start to learn and grow.\n\nThat is without a doubt the first thing you need to do. You need to choose a skill which will allow you to make money online. The goal here is not to learn as many things as possible, but to focus on one or two things and be good at them. Specialization is the key word!\n\nIf the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that life is unpredictable. No matter where you live or travel, always leave enough money in your account to return home or for unexpected expenses so that you can quickly leave your current place of residence if necessary."
