        "text": "Regional Climate Outlook Forums, active in several parts of the world, routinely provide real-time regional climate outlook products.\n\nhttp://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/clips/outlooks/climate_forecasts.html\n\nThe Forum process promoted the recognition in many parts of the world that climate predictions could be of substantial benefit in adapting to and mitigating climate variations. One important aspect of the Forums is the facility to bring together experts in various fields, local meteorologists and end users of forecasts in an environment that encourages interaction and learning.\n\nThe objective of the Action Plan of the WMO Regional Association VI Strategic Plan (2008-2011),\n\nhttp://www.wmo.ch/pages/about/documents/sp_ra_vi.pdf\n\nunder Expected Result 8, is to \"Coordinate a proactive participation of RA VI Members in relevant meetings (e.g. on climate change, disaster risk reduction and hazard early warnings) as part of an outreach programme (e.g. Regional Climate Outlook Forum - RCOF) that will help partner organizations to use weather, water and climate data and services more effectively\". The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that Europe has so far not been involved in the RCOF process and that there are a number of countries which would potentially benefit from such a forum. After a disaster with drought, forest fires and heath waves in SE Europe last summer, it is the right time to start with RCOF in Europe this spring, in order to get a consensus among experts and end users regarding the outlook for the next summer season.\n\nThe first session of the Southeast European Climate Outlook Forum (SEECOF-1)\n\nat the kind invitation of the Government of Croatia, will be held in Zagreb from 11 to 12 June 2008. The main objective of the Forum is to bring together hydro-meteorological experts and the \"user community\" to discuss experiences, capabilities and needs for climate trends analysis, climate prediction (seasonal to annual) and climate projections (over the coming decades) provided by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) to the various social and economic sectors. The Forum will be conducted in English and no interpretation will be available.\n\nIn view of the structure of the Forum and also with a view to ensuring its successful outcome, in addition to participants representing the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, active users of meteorological products and services from key economic sectors are expected to participate in the Workshop.
