        "text": "What's it famous for?\n\nIt is the administrative, economic, diplomatic and cultural capital of the country, with a population of almost one million. This “city of million hearts” as locals call it, has always been attracting visitors’ attention. Zagreb is also the city of science and culture. Many excellent scientists and artists who have enriched Croatian and world heritage, work here.\n\nThe city has approximately fifty museums and galleries, as well as private art collections and about twenty theatres and musical venues. Not only is Zagreb renowned for its Gothic churches, Baroque palaces, Art Deco buildings, beautiful city parks, but is also famous for the fascinating atmosphere in the historic Upper Town and the numerous downtown outdoor cafes where the true pulse of the city becomes captivating.\n\nOther main attractions include one of Europe’s most lively outdoor markets, Dolac, with its cheerful red parasols – it is here that the scents and the colourful diversity of fresh picked fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products make you remember those almost forgotten tastes of your childhood…\n\nFrom spring to autumn many events and exhibitions take place outdoors. They are a real treat for the visitors and they largely contribute to Zagreb’s special atmosphere. Its numerous downtown open air cafés give Zagreb the image of the biggest European café. Thanks to its many influences, the city has a special charm and that unique hospitable feel generated by its proverbial open-hearted inhabitants.\n\nIn addition, Zagreb and its surroundings with its exceptionally preserved nature lure numerous visitors to explore the mysteries of the region: the castles, romantic legends, vineyards, spas, local gastronomic delicacies and traditionally hospitable hosts.\n\nZagreb has a thousand faces and each one is – professional yet relaxed, modern, with a dash of a thousand years of longevity, cultural and economic, urban and adventurous … in short, Zagreb is the city that simply has to be discovered and rediscovered over and over again.\n\nTypical souvenirs are leather goods and crystal and glass ware, ceramics, pottery, hand made articles of wood, embroidered clothing, works of art (especially paintings and sculptures by naïve artists) gingerbread products, plum brandy, wines, cheeses and cured meat products.\n\nTwo typical business souvenirs are: The Penkala pencil and “kravata“ tie. From time immemorial, the tie has been a part of the Croatian national costume, which was preserved by the Croats to the more recent times, who moved to central Europe in the 16th century. It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century. Under the leadership of the French „God of Sun\" Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons. The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir. The word «kravata» (tie) originates from the word «Kroate»...\n\nzagreb-touristinfo.hr\n\n1. Architecture\n\nBoth the Lower Town and Upper Town in Zagreb offer visitors an insight into the past. The 19th century style of architecture is prominent across the capital. From the bright yellow Croatian National Theatre building situated in the heart of the city to the white walls and colourful roofs, visitors will get a glimpse into the past of the historic city.\n\n2. Parks and Gardens\n\nLike London, Zagreb is a garden city, with many parks and Botanical Garden open for public recreation. The U-shaped system of city squares with parks in Zagreb Lower Town was designed by horticulturalist Lenuzzi and is often called the Zagreb horseshoe. Monuments, galleries and museums can be found nestled within the greenery and flowers. Maksimir is the biggest park in Zagreb and was the first public promenade in south east Europe and features zoological gardens, three lakes, and pavilions, gazebos and sculptures. The park also includes a mock Swiss chalet and belvedere with a café, and is an ideal place to visit during the week when it is less busy.\n\n3. Coffee Culture\n\nZagreb’s streets are lined with both traditional style coffeehouses and cafés to the modern. Locals can often be found sitting in a café from morning to dusk enjoying a coffee or two with friends.\n\n4. The Mirogoj Cemetery\n\nNot your average cemetery, Mirogoj serves not only as a burial place but also as a beautiful park and something of an open-air art gallery of nature, and is one of the most exquisite cemeteries in Europe.

Thanks to them, Zagreb and Medvednica host the world famous VIP Snow Queen Trophy Ski Cup!\n\nOn the banks of river Sava\n\nA great value to modern Zagreb is certainly Jarun, the so called “Zagreb’s sea”, a large recreational and sports center, situated on the left bank of the river Sava in the immediate proximity of the metropolis.\n\nThe 2 lakes and 5 islets are interconnected by bridgesand pebble beachesand accommodate swimmers. Jarun also consists of kilometres of winding paths, cycling trails, green meadows, shady groves and the impressive 2,250 metres long regatta lane upon which numerous international and world championships are organized.\n\nThroughout the year Jarun attracts many citizens and their guests, but the liveliest season is summer when due to the pleasant weather a stage is set up at the Lake – hosting many theatre performances, open-air concerts, featuring famous DJs, fashion shows, firework shows and other events.\n\nGolf & Country Club is also lacated along the Sava river and is a popolar meeting place for golfers and their colleagues or partners.\n\nThe green necklace\n\nAdditionally, some 40 minutes away by road, Zagreb's picturesque hilly surroundings abides in green hills dotted with churches, tales and legends, wine trails as well as many impressive medieval castles. The past has been preserved in the ethno-village of Kumrovec, the birth place of former Yugoslav president Tito, where one can make their own gingerbread hearts, prepare some typical dishes of the region, learn a local dance or simply get to know how locals lived in the past.\n\nAdditionally, only 2 hours driving time from Zagreb, a unique experience awaits you – the Plitvice Lakes National Park– where 16 lakes linked by more than 90 waterfalls, a natural marvel under the protection of UNESCO, invites you to take a stroll under the slopes or enjoy a boat ride across a lake.\n\nIf you prefer a visit to the coast, you can either reach Opatija in 2hours time by road or fly down south (50 min) to the Pearl of Adriatic – Dubrovnik."
