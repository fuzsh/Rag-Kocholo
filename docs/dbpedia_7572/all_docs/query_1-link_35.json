        "text": "You need a valid U.S. passport to enter Croatia. EU regulations require that U.S. passport holders have no less than three months’ validity when they depart Croatia. U.S. passport holders with less than three months may be denied entry. The U.S. Embassy strongly suggests that you have at least six months of validity to avoid problems when you travel.\n\nCroatia is a member of the Schengen area. Land border controls between Croatia, Slovenia, and Hungary and the sea border with Italy ceased in 2023. The land borders with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro continue to have police and customs checks in place, as these countries are outside of the Schengen area. Airport controls for flights between Croatia and other countries within the Schengen area ceased in 2023. Visit the Embassy of Croatia website for the most current visa information.\n\nU.S. passport holders do not need a visa if they are traveling to Croatia for tourism or business for less than 90 days within a 180-day period.\n\nFor entry, residence, and work requirements in Croatia, please visit the Croatian Ministry of Interior’s website. The U.S. Embassy is not able to intervene in the issuance of a Croatian residence permit.\n\nYou must register at a local police station within three days of arrival in Croatia. If you are staying at a hotel, hostel, or vacation rental, you will be registered by the property owner.\n\nForeign documents submitted for residence in Croatia must be translated into Croatian and have an apostille stamp. The U.S. Embassy cannot authenticate documents. For information on applying for apostille and authentication services, please see the Department of State’s Office of Authentications website.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to, or foreign residents of, Croatia.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nMilitary/Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Travelers: While active-duty U.S. military personnel may enter Croatia under the SOFA with proper Department of Defense (DOD) identification and travel orders, all SOFA family members, civilian employees, and contractors must have valid passports. Active-duty military personnel should obtain a tourist passport before leaving the United States to accommodate off-duty travel. DOD travelers should consult with their unit for clearance before leaving the United States\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking soft targets and are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, rudimentary IEDs and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nLand Mines: Armed conflict ended in all parts of Croatia in 1995; however, de-mining of areas along former confrontation lines continues. Known mined areas are well marked with Croatian-language warning signs using the international symbol for mines: a skull and crossbones inside a red, upside-down triangle. Drivers in former conflict areas should stay on paved roads to reduce the risk of encountering unmarked mines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nFor more information about mine-affected areas in Croatia, please visit the Croatian Mine Action Center's website\n\nCrime: Violent crime is rare but isolated attacks targeting specific persons or property can occur and may be racially motivated or prompted by lingering ethnic tensions from Croatia's war for independence.\n\nSafeguard your belongings, especially when using public transport. Report incidents of theft to the local police. File a police report if your passport is stolen.\n\nDon’t display outward signs of wealth. It may make you a target for thieves.\n\nAvoid \"gentlemen's clubs.\" In the past, such establishments have presented foreign customers with inflated bills and threatened those who refuse to pay.\n\nU.S. business entities are encouraged to read the most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Annual Crime and Safety Report for Croatia.\n\nDemonstrations: While civil disorder is rare, U.S. citizens should monitor local media coverage, review their personal security practices, and be always aware of their surroundings. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent with little or no notice. Security messages about demonstrations can be found here on the U.S. Embassy in Croatia’s website. Some soccer matches result in violent clashes of fans from rival teams. These clashes often cause disruptions in traffic in the affected area. High profile matches are often accompanied by heavy police presence.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may contact the U.S. Embassy at +385 (1) 661-2200 and check the information on local resources for victims of sexual assault on the U.S. Embassy in Croatia’s website.

You can find additional local resources for victims of domestic violence on the U.S. Embassy’s website.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry in Croatia is regulated and rules generally enforced regarding safety inspections. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to reach a patient and provide assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported.\n\nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nRecreational Drugs: Some recreational drugs may be illegal in Croatia. The Government of Croatia maintains a List of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Plants Which Can Be Used for Preparation of Narcotic Drugs, which lists illegal substances.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nReal estate: U.S. citizens should exercise due diligence when considering purchasing real estate in Croatia. Consult with an attorney before undertaking a real estate purchase and be careful to fully understand the implications of all parts of a real estate contract. Working with a translator can help ensure your rights are protected. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist U.S. citizens with legal disputes. Be prepared to take your case to the local courts. Please review the U.S. Embassy’s website for additional information on buying real estate in Croatia.\n\nTravelers checks, or personal checks are no longer accepted in Croatia. ATMs are common, and credit cards are generally accepted. Facilities are available for wiring or transferring money.\n\nRecreational Boating: The Croatian government requires all recreational captains chartering Croatian-flagged vessels to have a certificate of competence.\n\nCroatia recognizes certain certificates issued by the U.S. Sailing Association and licenses issued by the national authorities of other countries.\n\nDetails on classes of licenses recognized by country can be found on the Ministry of the Sea, Transport, and Infrastructure’s webpage.\n\nTourists in Croatia can be certified by passing a test at harbormasters' offices in Pula, Rijeka, Senj, Zadar, Sibenik, Split, Ploce, Dubrovnik, or at the Ministry in Zagreb.\n\nTravelers arriving by private marine craft should refer to the Ministry’s website for information on nautical regulations.\n\nClimbing and Hiking: If you intend to hike or climb in the mountains, seek local guides’ expert advice. For emergencies, call 112. Rock climbers in Paklenica National Park should consult a local guide or contact Paklenica National Park prior to their visit.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions regarding same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Croatia. Although LGBTQI+ individuals are afforded full rights in Croatia, same-sex couples may face legal challenges in the areas of adoption and next-of-kin determinations. In 2014, Croatia enacted the Law on Life Partnership of Same Sex Couples allowing for formal registration of same sex unions. The LGBTQI+ community is protected by anti-discrimination laws, and there are no legal or governmental impediments to the organization of LGBTQI+ events. However, there have been incidents against LGBTQI+ groups, notably during annual pride events, both in Zagreb and Split. Individual cases of attacks on members of the LGBTQI+ community have also been reported.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section six of our Human Rights Report for further information.\n\nTravelers With Disabilities or Who May Require Accessibility. Accessibility and accommodation in Croatia are different from those in the United States. Croatian law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. It also mandates access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities; however, there is a marked difference in new construction compared to old construction, where access can still be limited. Croatia’s geography is hilly and often steep, particularly along the coast, and it presents challenges to some persons with disabilities. Access to public transportation may not always be available. Outside urban areas, accessibility worsens significantly.\n\nMany cities in Croatia are making access improvement for travelers with disabilities.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nAdequate medical care is readily available in Croatia, but facilities may not be comparable to U.S. standards. Travelers to Croatia may obtain a list of English-speaking physicians on the U.S. Embassy’s website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. You may need a prescription to get some medications that you can purchase over the counter in the United States.\n\nFor emergency services in Croatia, dial 194 or 112.\n\nAmbulance services are:\n\nnot widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.\n\nnot equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.\n\nHealth facilities in general:\n\nAdequate health facilities are available in major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.\n\nPublic medical clinics may lack advanced resources and specialized medical supplies.\n\nCredit card payment is not always available. Some hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.\n\nPrivate hospitals may require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.\n\nTravelers should make efforts to obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care.\n\nMedical staff may speak little or no English.\n\nPublic hospitals are minimally staffed overnight in non-emergency wards.\n\nPatients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.\n\nPsychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.\n\nThere are shortages of medical staff (nurses, doctors) throughout the country that may delay exams, imaging, surgeries, etc. at public healthcare centers. Occasionally shortages of special medications may occur.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Croatia accept cash or credit card payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nPrescription medication: If traveling with prescription medication, please check with the government of Croatia and its Customs Administration to make sure the medication is legal in Croatia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Visit the U.S. Embassy’s website for information on bringing medical drugs for personal use when traveling to Croatia. Note that Croatian law prohibits the importation of drugs via postal mail.\n\nExercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIf you will be in Croatia for more than three months, especially if you anticipate hiking, camping, or other outdoor activities in forested areas, you may wish to get a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine. According to the CDC, the TBE vaccine is now available in the United States, but is carried only in larger travel clinics.\n\nIf you are in Croatia, it is available from local doctors. Use insect repellent and inspect your body for ticks after spending time outdoors.\n\nDiseases\n\nInfluenza is prevalent during the winter season.\n\nHIV/AIDS: There is a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Croatia. HIV/AIDS treatment and medication are available in Croatia.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Croatia.\n\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\n\nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on medical tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Croatia.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.\n\nYour legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Croatia.\n\nAlthough Croatia has several elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Croatia, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and that professionals are accredited and qualified.\n\nAdventure Travel\n\nVisit Adventure Travel and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information.\n\nAir Quality: Cities in Croatia have air pollution levels slightly higher than those in major U.S. cities, with higher levels measured in winter. Visit the European Environment Agency’s website for information on air quality in Croatia.\n\nWater Quality\n\nCroatia has an abundance of fresh water and the public drinking water systems cover around 87% of the population. Water quality is tested daily throughout the country. Tests are performed according to internationally accepted standards. Water in Croatia is of high quality with potable tap water being available in most places. Some rural areas rely on private wells that may not be subject to quality testing standards. Some older buildings in major cities may have led-laced piping leading to increased levels of lead in the drinking water. You can learn more by visiting the Croatian Institute of Public Health website.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"
