        "text": "Domino is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation based in Zagreb, Croatia, that has as its mission the questioning of the traditional and the transformation of oppressive norms in transitional societies through culture, media, public policies, education and collaboration with local and international organisations. The vision of Domino is that in the society there is a continuous recognition of norms that disables the freedom of art and, more specifically, queer expression; which in its nature is subversive yet peaceful. This expression is mostly visible trough the independent art scene and warrants the broadening of the borders and the critical questioning of existing social norma. We feel that it is necessary to make a social environment that enables the independent culture to manifest itself through different forms and stakeholders. The organisation realizes its mission through four major programs: culture and arts, media, education and politics. Within ACT, we want to continue our long-standing engagement with identity politics, broaden our support for independent artists improving the working conditions for their creations and continue our efforts to decentralise artistic programs in seven Croatian regions while strenghtening culturally marginalised landscapes. At the same time, we wish to further develop and continue offering quality capacity building programs for students and cultural professionals alike, while sharing and exchanging know-how, experiences, practices and concerns within the ACT network."
