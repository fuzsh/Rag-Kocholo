It is shown that he was involved in teaching and professional work in meteorology throughout his professional career, and in meteorological research until his early forties – i.e. before switching to seismological research and arriving at the famous discovery of discontinuity between the Earth’s crust and its mantle. Mohorovièiæ taught meteorology at the Nautical School in Bakar (1882–1891) and later at the University of Zagreb (since 1894). As for the professional engagement in meteorology, his major achievements were foundation of meteorological station in Bakar (1887), start of meteorological forecasting in Croatia (1893), and establishment of the network of Croatian meteorological stations (1901). Mohorovièiæ’s meteorological research included, but was not limited to, the climatological investigation of clouds and their movements in the Bakar area, the study of tornado that struck Novska, and an early study of the Zagreb climate conditions. As demonstrated in a recent publication, Mohorovièiæ also made pioneering contribution to the investigation of atmospheric rotors, by describing in some detail a vortex with horizontal axis he had observed from Bakar (1889); this discovery influenced later research of similar phenomena in England and Germany, but was forgotten by the international scientific community some fifty years later.\n\nKeywords: Andrija Mohorovièiæ, teaching of meteorology, Croatian meteorological network, atmospheric rotors.\n\n[PDF]\n\n2. Be¹liæ, I., K. ©ega, M. Èaèkoviæ, Z. Bencetiæ Klaiæ and V. Vuèetiæ (2007): Influence of weather types on concentrations of metallic components in airborne PM10 in Zagreb, Croatia. Geofizika, 24, 93-107.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nThis study investigates the influence of weather types found over the continental part of Croatia on daily PM10 concentrations and concentrations of metallic compounds in PM10 (namely manganese, lead and cadmium) in air during 2000–2002 period. Pollutant concentrations were measured at the northern, residential part of Zagreb, far from major pollution sources. Weather types were determined from synoptic charts. In the employed categorization six different patterns were recognized: radiation weather type, high pressure ridge, precipitation weather type, southeastern advection, northeastern advection and wind weather type. The most frequently, elevated concentrations were related to radiation weather type and southeastern advection, while the lowest concentrations were recorded during the wind weather type. Obtained results generally suggest a major role of the local pollution sources, and particularly of the Zagreb industrial zone, in suspended particles/metallic compounds pollution. Since cadmium exhibits somewhat different behavior, the role of the long-range transport in cadmium pollution needs to be further investigated. Synoptic conditions favorable for elevated concentrations occurred in about 37% of investigated days. Typically, these conditions are characterized by 1) the weak winds and turbulence, and consequently, inefficient pollutant concentration dilution (the nighttime and wintertime radiative conditions); or 2) southeastern airflow (southeastern advection and daytime radiative conditions), which transports pollutants from industrial zone of Zagreb towards the measuring site. Due to the latter, particulate pollutants emitted in the industrial zone pass rather frequently above the eastern part of Zagreb.\n\nKeywords: PM10, lead, manganese, cadmium, local sources, long-range transport\n\n[PDF]\n\n3. Cvita¹, T., N. Kezele, L. Klasinc and G. ©orgo (2007): Ozone measurements at the mountain station Zavi¾an (Croatia) for 1997–2000. Geofizika, 24, 109-116.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nAnalysis of ozone concentrations measured at Zavi¾an, Croatia's highest altitude meteorological station (1594 m a.s.l.), during the spring and summer months of 1997–2000 shows that the actual new Croatian Air Quality standards are severely exceeded. Implication of this and similar findings from other elevated sites call for additional consideration of ozone behaviour at high altitudes in defining ozone standards.\n\nKeywords: ozone, air quality standards, tropospheric ozone\n\n[PDF]\n\n4. Kovaè, E. and T. Cvita¹ (2007): Boundary layer ozone in Osijek, eastern Croatia. Geofizika, 24, 117-122.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nResults of the first ozone monitoring in ambient air in eastern Slavonia are reported for the growth season in 2002 (April through September). The monitoring site at the northern boundary of the city was chosen to distinguish two types of air masses: one from the rural and marshy region to the north and the other urban and suburban from the south. The measured hourly average ozone volume fractions varied between 0 and 80 ppb, the average being 35 ppb. The low value indicated that the air is well mixed. No significant differences were found between air masses from the north and from the south. Thus, no significant photochemical pollution problems are expected for the city Osijek.\n\nKeywords: air quality, ozone, tropospheric ozone\n\n[PDF]\n\n5. Rumenjak D. and S. ©tambuk: Fuzzy modelling in air protection. Geofizika, 24, 123-135.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nIt is presented how classical modelling in environmental protection, particularly air quality modelling from area pollution sources, could be replaced by fuzzy modelling. The results of such modelling are fuzzy sets that could be used in hybrid models for approximate reasoning and decision making support. The futures work on environmental standards representation and construction the linguistic variables for the purpose is also explained.\n\nKeywords: Fuzzy sets, membership function, linguistic variables, air quality modelling, eulerian box model, environmental impact assessment, environmental standards\n\n[PDF]\n\n6.

Geofizika, 24, 137-143.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nThe international project Environmental Modelling and Evaluation Programme for Croatia (EMEP4HR) is presented. It is a joint project of Norwegian and Croatian meteorological services, University of Zagreb and Energy Research and Environmental Protection Institute (EKONERG) that started in 2006, and is due to last until 2010. The main purpose of this project is to develop and test an operative framework for environmental control of air pollution problems in Croatia. The project will allow for a stable long-term development of Croatia’s scientific capacity to support the design of environmental protection strategies. Among objectives of EMEP4HR project is an implementation of a new scheme for vertical diffusion calculation. The new approach in calculating vertical diffusion coefficient K(z) is a linear-exponential function with convenient analytic properties. It is a generalized form of O’Brien’s third-order polynomial K(z) that is presently being used in the EMEP model. Initial results of the EMEP4HR show the feasibility of this project. This project will allow Croatian experts to produce their own assessments of air quality at national and at urban level.\n\nKeywords: international project, Eulerian chemical model, vertical diffusion, environmental protection\n\n[PDF]\n\nVaria\n\n7.
