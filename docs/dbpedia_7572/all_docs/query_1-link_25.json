        "text": "Results and discussion\n\nshows that all PM fractions measured at our outdoor (O) and indoor (I) site exhibited similar patterns over the entire study period. Indoor PM1 mass concentrations were generally lower than the outdoor (9.9 μg/m3 in average, ). However, the two measuring sites were approximately 400 m apart and the indoor sampling height was 30 cm higher.\n\nA comparison of hourly outdoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with concurrent outdoor Network values ( , middle panel) shows very similar patterns at the two locations for both fractions. This suggests that both sites are mainly affected by more distant (background) pollution sources, i.e., there were no major local pollution sources near any of the two sites. The levels of both fractions were generally higher at the outdoor site than at the Network site ( and ). Similarly, annual mean PM10 levels at the Network site, which varied between 12 and 17 μg/m3 between 2011 and 2014 (9), were also lower than the four-month mean of measurements recorded at our outdoor site (28.8 μg/m3, , hourly data). The average difference for both fractions was 14 μg/m3 ( ), while daily variations ranged from 5 to 25 and from 0 to 25 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively ( , bottom). The greatest differences occurred on days with low wind speeds (8 August and 9 October), which points to the influence of local sources on these days. These differences are not surprising, as the two measuring sites are 7 km apart and exposed to different local sources of PM (the main local sources being local transport and resuspension), and our outdoor site is at 125 m lower altitude than the Network site and is located at the sidewall of an almost completely enclosed topographic basin ( , right panel). Such basins generally favour build-ups of hydrostatically stable pools of cold air at night (25) and inhibit atmospheric mixing, which results in elevated night-time pollutant concentrations (26, 27). In addition, the sampling height at the Network site is 2.3 m higher than at the outdoor site. As higher concentrations are expected closer to the ground, Network concentrations should generally be lower than those observed at the outdoor site, at least over night (27). Finally, mass concentrations at the two sites were measured by different equipment.\n\nshows the effects of ventilation and precipitation on pollution levels. Namely, periods with stronger winds and/or precipitation coincide with the periods of lower PM levels at both sites for both PM2.5 and PM10 fractions (compare top and middle panel).\n\nshows dependence of hourly mean indoor and outdoor concentrations on meteorological variables. As the results for all three outdoor fractions are very similar, here we show only the outdoor PM1.\n\nPrevious studies of urban residential environment showed a clear increase in PM1 with relative humidity both indoors (11) and outdoors (28). Here, however, this correlation was less prominent with outdoor PM1. Indoor PM1 showed an inverted U-shape similar to the one found for outdoor PM2.5 in some urban areas (29).\n\nBoth indoor and outdoor PM1 concentrations increased with air temperature ( ). This points to the influence of solar radiation on particle formation (higher air temperatures are the result of higher solar radiation). However, while indoor PM1 levels increased with temperature over the entire range of measured temperatures, outdoor PM followed this pattern only at temperatures above 10 °C. At lower temperatures (at 5 and 10 °C cut-off points), the range between the median and the 75th percentile is quite high, which implies high mean concentrations (higher than median values). Such a U-shaped dependence of outdoor PM levels (as they all had a nearly identical pattern as outdoor PM1, data for PM2.5 and PM10 are not shown in ) on air temperature confirms previous reports of a negative and a positive relationship between PM2.5 and low and high temperature, respectively (30), and explains why ultrafine (PM1) particle levels should be higher in the summer than winter (31). We believe that higher average concentrations at low temperatures observed here are related to local heating sources from nearby (≈1 km distant) settlements, hotels, and premises of the National Park. On the other hand, higher PM levels at higher temperatures can be attributed to faster production of secondary aerosols due to higher solar radiation (30), enhanced dust resuspension due to generally drier soil during warm season (32), and elevated summertime biogenic emissions of both primary aerosol and secondary aerosol organic precursors (33). Fair and warm weather also attracts more visitors, which entails higher traffic emissions and higher resuspension from roads and walking trails. In addition, a recent study (34) showed that deposition velocities of PM2.5 and PM10 at air temperatures ranging from 20 to 29 °C decreased with increase in temperature, which means that higher PM levels are also related to less efficient deposition at higher temperatures.\n\nAverage outdoor PM2.5 level at 1.7 m AGL (22.9 μg/m3, ) was below the annual limit of 25 μg/m3 set by the EU and Croatian legislation (35). However, it is likely that the average concentration over the entire year might be higher than this limit for two reasons: a) contribution of local and regional emissions due to wintertime heating and b) enhanced static stability of the atmospheric boundary layer in the winter, which results in higher near-ground pollutant concentrations (36). On the other hand, average PM10 concentrations (28.8 μg/m3, , hourly data) were noticeably lower than daily (50 μg/m3) and annual (40 μg/m3) limits (35), yet they still exceeded the daily limit of 50 μg/m3 on 10 days or 231 hours. At the same time, daily mean PM10 levels measured at the Network site kept below this limit for the entire study period.\n\nWith respect to the global air quality guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 (37), our hourly PM2.5 concentrations at the outdoor site averaged to annual values were below the 2nd interim target of 25 μg/m3, whereas the Network site concentrations were below the 4th interim target of 10 μg/m3. Averaged to annual, PM10 concentrations were below the 3rd interim target level of 30 μg/m3 at our outdoor site and the 4th target level of 20 μg/m3 at the Network site.\n\nThe effects of wind speed and precipitation on outdoor PM2.5 and PM10 ( ) are also visible for ultrafine particles ( ). Similar to other studies (38, 39), outdoor PM1 levels dropped with higher wind speed, but indoor medians remained similar over the entire span of wind speeds measured at the outdoor site. However, due to smaller instrument memory the indoor PM data series ( ) does not cover October, when the winds were the strongest\n\n( , top). On the other hand, both outdoor and indoor PM1 levels decreased with precipitation. A similar wet scavenging effect was reported by a number of other studies (11, 38, 40), although precipitation can also increase PM2.5 concentrations if it is weak or comes with fog (40).\n\nBoth indoor and outdoor daily PM1 levels rose with the number of visitors to PLNP ( ) on days when it was above 8,000, most likely owing to denser traffic of trackless trains [involving higher exhaust of diesel engines and non-exhaust emissions (brake, tyre, and road surface wear and tear and particle resuspension from road surfaces (41)] and particle resuspension caused by pedestrians.\n\nDaily indoor and outdoor PM1 variations exhibited different patterns ( ). Indoor levels were the highest during working hours, from 7 to 16 h local standard time (LST), and rather uniform. In the late afternoon and evening they would gradually drop and bottom out between midnight and 6 h LST. As there are no major pollution sources at the National Park premises, this pattern points to particle resuspension due to employee movement (42). In contrast to indoor variation, outdoor levels reached their minimum between 5 and 9 h LST, while they remained uniformly higher between 11 and 24 h LST. Such a long interval of higher PM1 levels is likely owed to tourist activities in the daytime and the forming of a shallow, hydrostatically stable boundary layer that prevents pollutant dispersion and keeps them concentrated in the night time (26).\n\nWeekly variations in PM1 levels ( ) also point to differences between the indoor and outdoor patterns. Indoor levels peaked on Friday (the office is closed on weekend), which points to increased resuspension, probably consistent with the end-of-the week employee activities. Outdoor concentrations peaked on Friday and Saturday (which also coincided with the number of visitors). Both were the lowest on Sunday.\n\nshows bivariate polar plots for measured PM fractions and for fraction ratios. The lowest outdoor levels over the entire study period (marked as “Overall” in ) coincided with winds from the south-eastern quadrant with speeds above 1 m/s. However, higher levels show no such association with any specific wind direction as long as their speed was below 1 m/s. This suggests that outdoor concentrations were dominated by background emissions rather than prominent local sources or transport of particles from some specific, more distant emission source. A look at each study month separately reveals the influence of specific wind directions, such as winds from the eastern and north-western quadrants for August and October, respectively.\n\nAt the indoor site the highest PM1 levels were associated with easterly and westerly winds, and the lowest with northerlies and south-south-easterlies.\n\nJudging by the outdoor PM2.5/PM10 and PM1/PM2.5 ratios for the entire study period ( ), winds from the two northern quadrants showed the highest and winds from the south-eastern quadrant the lowest contribution of PM2.5 to PM10 and PM1 to PM2.5. Contribution of PM1 to PM2.5 was also somewhat higher with the winds from the north-western than from the north-eastern quadrant, which may be owed to the trackless train PM1 emissions from the nearby station V ( ) to the north-west of the outdoor site, as PM1 levels are known to decrease more rapidly with distance from the source than the levels of larger particles (43), and it is very unlikely that PM1 originated from more distant sources.\n\nApart from the wind, PM ratios were also affected by other meteorological parameters and the number of visitors ( ). Higher relative humidity was associated with a drop in PM2.5/PM10 and PM1/PM2.5 ratios and the most prominent drop in the indoor/ outdoor PM1 ratio.\n\nWhile the outdoor PM1 contribution to PM2.5 decreased with increase in temperature for the entire range of measured temperatures, outdoor PM2.5 to PM10 contribution increased with temperature only for temperatures above 15 °C. On the other hand, the indoor/outdoor PM1 ratio exhibited a prominent increase with temperature for the entire range of measured outdoor temperatures, which might be owed to more intense particle growth (that is, PM1 loss) outdoors under the influence of direct solar radiation on sunny days. In contrast, indoor particles are mainly exposed to diffuse radiation, even on sunny days, and the growth of indoor particles (that is, a loss of PM1) is less intense. As a result, indoor/outdoor ratio increases.\n\nAn increase in wind speed coincided with a decrease in both PM2.5/PM10 and PM1/PM2.5 outdoor ratios.\n\nDependences of the PM2.5/PM10 ratio on precipitation are unclear, while the outdoor PM1/PM2.5 ratio increased with an precipitation intensity above 8 mm/h. The latter supports earlier findings that PM2.5 particles are washed out of the atmosphere more efficiently than PM1 particles (46).\n\nFinally, all PM ratios increased with the number of visitors. This increase was the most prominent for the indoor/outdoor ratio of PM1 fraction.\n\nand show power spectral densities of time series. shows only the results for indoor and outdoor PM1, as outdoor PM2.5 and PM10 PSDs were very similar to the outdoor PM1 PSD. Both indoor and outdoor PSDs were computed from hourly means and point to daily periodicity. Namely, each distinct peak corresponds to 0.042 h (frequency) over 24 hours. Daily periodicity was also reported for the same time series for weather variables in a study of Kozjak Lake (22), which suggests that our daily PM periodicity was the result of two periodic forcings: daily weather and human activity. Furthermore, we did not detect weekly periodicity for coarse particles (PM2.5–10) (44) (not shown here).\n\nIn order to detect possible smaller-scale periodicities we also calculated PSDs from 6-minute (indoor) and 3-minute means (outdoor) ( ). The indoor spectrum exhibited a distinct energy peak at the frequency of 0.0699/min, that is, every 13.35 min ( top), the outdoor spectra did not reveal any clear-cut periodicity. This indoor peak at 13.35 min probably coincides with an employee regularly counting bark beetles collected in the National Park in the same office in which PM1 measurements were taken. This is done by filling a beaker with the beetles, banging it gently on a table surface several times to align them in strata, and filling the next beaker. We believe that banging resuspended the particles resting on the table surface and/or the beakers. The time needed to fill up one beaker roughly corresponds to the frequency observed on the spectrum."
