        "text": "Nurturing a degrowth community while the world burns? Reflections from the 2023 Zagreb Degrowth Conference\n\nReposted from Steady State Manchester\n\nLast month [September], Steady State Manchester collective member Dr James Scott Vandeventer attended the 2023 Degrowth Conference in Zagreb, Croatia. This blog is a reflection on his experience.\n\nWith Steady State Manchester’s support, I was able to attend the 2023 Degrowth Conference in Zagreb. As I arrived a 35°C heatwave had just broken, bringing cooler weather and sun interspersed with torrential downpours of rain. The weather variations served as an unsettling reminder of the state of climate destabilisation – perhaps an appropriate start to conference, which brought together academics, activists, policymakers and practitioners to face the challenge and necessity of moving beyond economic growth as we face the climate emergency and socioecological crises.\n\nThis degrowth conference, like others I have attended, provided a refreshing change from the usual pattern of academic conferences. By bringing together not only academics but also activists and practitioners with a shared understanding of the need for a post-growth society, Zagreb created a space for dialogue about the diverse ways to understand and advocate for system change. Yet, as with other degrowth events, I found a nagging feeling returning: perhaps this common ground for discussion, so important for nurturing a community, also needs challenging and reflexivity?\n\nMy sense of a tension between shared understanding and critical confrontation persisted throughout the conference. The many parallel sessions that took place – so many that I could only attend a small portion – included activist-oriented conversations, arts-based events, presentations (academic paper and book presentations, project overviews), and more. Many were based on recognition that the destructive effects of growth require change, with the areas where transformation is needed ranging from the money system to our subjectivities (and everything in between). Yet, does this premise – the problematic of growth-based capitalism – overlook the need to grapple with many mundane practices, complexities, and contradictions that exist in everyday life?\n\nConsider as well how the two keynotes on the first day approached the question of degrowth. On the one hand, Kohei Saito (whose books explore Marx and degrowth, one of which we have reviewed here) sought to articulate an ecological critique contained in Marx’s later work, showing how ‘degrowth communism’ is a logical development therein. In a similar conceptual move, Roland Nkwain Ngam channeled a decolonial perspective to argue that the lived experiences and philosophies of the Global South are a complementary way for confronting growth and its exploitative underpinnings. Both seemed to adopt a priori the understanding, shared by many at the conference, that degrowth equates to an equitable lowering of material throughput. This adheres to the most popular academic definitions of degrowth (such as here). But, it also seems to overlook that growth’s problematisation does not translate unproblematically to different contexts.\n\nAs I’ve written with Javier Lloveras (here), degrowth has the potential to take on different meanings as it is translated between different communities of scholarship and practice. What, then, the boundaries of degrowth are, and how it spreads into these different communities, becomes an open question and point for debate. If, instead, there is a shared assumption that unites a group – as is, to an extent, the case amongst those attending degrowth conferences – degrowth becomes by definition an exclusive category.\n\nAt Steady State Manchester, we recognise this tension. Our work is both informed by the latest evidence of ecological breakdown and oriented towards informing city-regional policy and practice. We are at once engaging in a conversation about transformative change and challenging the boundaries of the terms of debate (most recently about HS2). However, such a tension is often jettisoned – including in the spaces of degrowth conferences – in favour of a more definitive and stable view of degrowth.\n\nNavigating the space between understanding and reflexive critique was also visible in the two sessions I organised at the Zagreb conference. The first session, which was called ‘Advancing research on degrowth and post-growth organization’, sought to develop academic understandings of organisation in a degrowth context. A colleague shared her work on rethinking human needs in degrowth debates, and I presented on an empirical project examining how infrastructural organisations help navigate competing logics to support more just forms of housing (based on the Sufficiency in Housing project). Both papers aimed to challenge core elements of degrowth: the ways in which needs – often seen as essentialized – are in fact social reproduced on the one hand, and how multiple logics of housing (economising, ecology, legal, sharing, etc.) are negotiated in practice on the other. Yet, in the post-presentation discussions the audience mostly questioned the foundations of our arguments or sought clarifications. There was little to say about the substantive challenge that both papers issued to what degrowth means for organisation. The most interesting comment I received was after the session, when a lawyer explained how their legal practice also requires dealing with the tensions inherent to enacting different organisational forms in the prevailing legal paradigm.\n\nThe second session, titled ‘Bringing degrowth into management education’, was a launch event for the MEND (Management Educators Navigating Degrowth) network, of which I am a part. MEND explores how educators are working with degrowth ideas in the context of management education, pedagogies, and business schools, where the demands for instrumental and growth-oriented teaching are arguably at their most severe. Our session at the Zagreb conference (which I wrote about with the session co-organisers here) was, to our surprise, predominantly attended by people working in management, consultancy, and organisations – rather than management academics. The result was a fascinating conversation about how these practitioners think about and engage with degrowth (or don’t) in their daily work. But this meant that consideration of pedagogical approaches, a core premise of MEND (as outlined, for example, in our manifesto), was largely absent. Perhaps this speaks to the audience of a degrowth conference, which one might expect to eschew the world of business (schools). Yet, we have observed in MEND that managerially-oriented teaching is increasingly an expectation across more disciplines (from geography to engineering and physics), driven by the expectation that education will explain what socioecological sustainability means for students’ future careers. Could the premise of MEND – that bringing degrowth into management schools is an important avenue, even opportunity, for spurring critical conversations – challenge the shared understanding of the degrowth community that businesses and managers are to blame for the crises we face, and therefore management educators should be eschewed?\n\nAs is perhaps clear by now, these questions and doubts percolated in my mind throughout the Zagreb conference. As degrowth scholars, activists, and others will soon journey in their hundreds to the next conference in Pontevedra, I hope they will recognize that a shared understanding is necessary, but not enough, to realise the changes we envision. Resisting the urge to remain separate from other communities, degrowth conferences might yet serve as a space for renewal of what degrowth means for, and how it can transform, more ‘traditional’ ideas and practices outside the carefully demarcated space found in degrowth conferences. Looking ahead to Pontevedra, the conference tracks already seem to be aiming to inject degrowth ideas into other, perhaps more established, conversations – a welcome sign."
