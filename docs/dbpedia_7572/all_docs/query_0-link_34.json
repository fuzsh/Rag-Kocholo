        "text": "A large infrastructure project called, \"Trg pravde\", is taking form in Zagreb. The aim of the project it to gather all judicial bodies in one place. The first part of the project, funded by the World Bank, was to renovate an old historical building from the 18th century together with a new building to facilitate the land registry department, part of the Ministry of Justice. From having documents and books scattered around in several different premises it was decided to centralise everything in one place. Our dealer Primat Logistika got the honor to install the archives for this project."
