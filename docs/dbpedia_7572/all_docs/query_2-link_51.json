        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in Croatia\n\nTerrorist attacks in Croatia cannot be ruled out.\n\nAttacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.\n\nCrime\n\nCrime levels are low and violent crime is rare.\n\nProtecting yourself and your belongings\n\nTourists have been overcharged at certain ‘gentlemen’s clubs’, sometimes by thousands of euros, and threatened with violence if they refuse to pay.\n\nPickpockets operate in tourist areas. Avoid carrying large sums of cash, do not leave valuables unattended and use hotel safes if possible.\n\nAttacks and sexual assaults in taxis\n\nThere have been reports of sexual assaults in taxis in Croatia. To reduce risk and help prevent potential assaults:\n\ntake a photo of the inside, where the number of the taxi is visible, and send it to a friend or someone else\n\nshare your ride status on the taxi app\n\nmake a call while in the taxi telling someone which taxi it is and where you are going\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nPersonal ID\n\nAlways carry your passport or, if you’re a resident, your Croatian ID card. Keep a copy of your passport’s photo page in a safe place.\n\nAntisocial behaviour\n\nIn some Croatian town centres, including tourist destinations like Split and Dubrovnik, you can get on-the-spot fines for behaviour seen as inappropriate, including:\n\ndrinking alcohol or using drugs in public spaces\n\nsleeping in public spaces\n\nurinating or vomiting in public spaces\n\nwalking through towns shirtless or in swimwear\n\nwearing clothing that promotes drug use\n\nclimbing on monuments\n\nYou can also be fined up to 4,000 euros for public order disturbances, including:\n\nfighting\n\nverbal abuse such as shouting or arguing\n\ndrunken behaviour\n\nbelittling or insulting police officers or other public officials\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nDrug offences are punished with fines and prison sentences.\n\nUnexploded mines\n\nIf you travel outside the tourist resorts, beware of unexploded mines in previously war-affected areas, including:\n\nEastern Slavonia\n\nBrod-Posavina County\n\nKarlovac County\n\nareas around Zadar County\n\nmore remote areas of the Plitvice Lakes National Park\n\nFor more information about mine-affected areas, visit the Civil Protection website (in Croatian) or contact the Civil Protection offices.\n\nIf you’re travelling in these areas, do not walk on uncultivated land or step off the marked paths. If in doubt, get local advice.\n\nOutdoor activities and adventure tourism\n\nHiking and mountaineering\n\nIf you’re hiking in the mountains, get expert advice from local guides, however tame the mountain might seem. Weather in the Croatian mountains can change quickly, even in summer. Temperatures can get very low overnight.\n\nThere is a risk of getting lost in the mountains when out hiking alone and using unmarked paths. Read the Croatian Mountain Rescue tips on mountaineering, follow their Twitter at Hrvatska GSS and see their maps. If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112 for help from the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIf you’re planning to drive in Croatia, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in RAC’s Croatia guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of, such as:\n\nhaving your headlights on and dipped when driving a car from 1 November until 31 March, even during daytime\n\ndriving with dipped headlights year-round on scooters and motorcycles\n\nusing winter tyres between 15 November and 15 April\n\ncarrying a fluorescent vest in the car, not in the boot – you must wear the vest while attending to a breakdown\n\nYou can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Croatia for up to one year. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.\n\nThe Croatian Automobile Association lists current traffic hazards.\n\nDrink-driving is a serious offence in Croatia. If you’re found with more than 0.05% of alcohol in your blood (in England it’s 0.08%) you will get a fine, and you may lose your licence and get a prison sentence. The alcohol limit is zero for drivers under the age of 24.\n\nSea travel\n\nDo not drink alcohol if you’re in charge of a yacht or boat. There are heavy penalties for being caught drunk in charge of a boat and a zero-tolerance approach.\n\nYou must sail by the most direct route to a port of entry when entering Croatian territorial waters.\n\nAuthorities can arrest you for entering a non-designated entry port without telling them. If you cannot use the correct entry port, contact the local harbour master or the police before entering Croatia.\n\nIf you are in Croatia, including on a boat, your presence in Croatia must be registered with the police. If you’re travelling with a tour operator, they should do this for you. Otherwise, you must fill in and print form obrazac 16a (PDF) and hand it in at a police station.\n\nAll captains must have an International Certificate of Competence.\n\nExtreme weather and natural disasters\n\nFind out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.\n\nWildfires\n\nWildfires are common during Croatia’s hot and dry summers. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. If you see a fire, call the emergency services on 112. If you’re affected, follow the advice of local authorities.\n\nFrom 1 June to 31 October it is illegal to set outdoor fires and barbecues except in designated areas. Intentionally causing a fire is illegal in Croatia and you could be fined 2,000 to 20,000 euros, or even given a prison sentence.\n\nYou could also be fined for unintentionally causing a fire. Properly extinguish cigarette ends and do not leave any rubbish behind, particularly empty bottles, as these are known to start fires. Fines in these cases have ranged from 260 to 1,200 euros.\n\nEarthquakes\n\nEarthquakes in Croatia can be strong and cause deaths and damage to infrastructure. In recent years, there have been earthquakes in Zagreb and in Petrinja, near Sisak in central Croatia. Both caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure and loss of life. Heavily damaged buildings, which are not always signposted, may be unstable.\n\nSmall tremors also happen several times a month throughout the year. Most pass without consequence. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.\n\nFloods"
