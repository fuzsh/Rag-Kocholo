        "text": "1. Data Description\n\nCentral and Southern Europe holds a large documentary-based historical climatological datasets information about the flood and drought and index-based local-regional temperature and precipitation reconstructions [1]. Carpathian Basin, is situated in the southeastern Central Europe and is one of the world's largest enclosed Basins with special meteorological, hydrological and air pollution situations [2], [3], [4]. Carpathian basin is centred around Hungary which lies entirely in the basin and also encompasses the territories of Slovakia, southwest Ukraine, western Romania, northern Serbia, northeast Croatia, northeast Slovenia and eastern part of Austria. Characteristic phenomenon in the central part of Carpathian Basin (located in Hungary) during the winter half year are the mist (500-1000 hours/year), fog (150-300 hours/year) and the cold air pool with high air pollution [5]. There are affects that contribute to pollutant enrichment in a similar way in other basin areas, for example the Uintah Basin in Utah [6].\n\nIn the Carpathian Basin, we already know weather records from the 11th century coming from contemporary diplomas and archive sources. Using the index-based historical climate data (more than 15,000 digitalized information) a climate reconstruction was processed between 1650 and 1900 by Bartholy et al. [7]. The first recorded instrumental measurement in the Carpathian Basin was carried out in 1718 in Sopron (western part of Hungary near the Austrian border). However, the longest continuous measurement data series comes from Buda (Budapest from 1873), where the measurements began in 1777. This station was a member of the Societas Meteorologica Palatina between 1781 and 1792, which was the first international meteorological network [8]. Historical weather observation data exists also in case of Temesvár/Timişoara covering the period of 1780 to 1803 describing several weather extremes such as severe winter and unusually large number of foggy days in the summer of 1784 [9]. Historical meteorological information was extracted for the last two decades of 19th century from Romania, and Austro-Hungarian Monarchy using archives of three newspapers published during that time in the region as a part of a data recovery and climate reconstruction project [10]\n\nOur study aims at extracting and digitalizing the historical data on fog occurrence from the end of 19th century till the beginning of the First World War for Hungary and surrounding countries in the Carpathian Basin. The daily weather observation dataset with respect to fog occurrence recorded in the yearbooks of Royal Hungarian Central Institute of Meteorology and Earth Magnetism (RHCIMEM) from 1886 to 1919 is presented in this study. The data for fog occurrence from all the stations which are described in the yearbooks of RHCIMEM has been digitalized in MS excel files. Every station described in the yearbooks of the RHCIMEM and presented in this study fall in the Carpathian Basin except Fiume/ Rijeka which is located on southwestern Croatian coastline. However, we have included it in this study because along with all the other stations, Fiume/ Rijeka was under the control of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and had a synoptic station after RHCIMEM was established. (a) shows the map of Europe and (b) shows Carpathian Basin and surrounding areas along with the locations of the meteorological stations for which data is available in the yearbooks of the institute. The stations located in Hungary and its neighbouring four Carpathian Basin countries namely Croatia, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, are presented with different colours. The time period of available historical fog climate data for each station is also depicted.\n\npresents a picture taken from the yearbook of 1912, showing the daily meteorological data recorded in the month of January for Budapest and Dobogókő. The yearbooks (1886 to 1919) contain datasets on quantitative variables like temperature (°Celsius), pressure (mmHg), vapour pressure (mmHg), relative humidity (%), cloudiness (tenth), wind direction (cardinal and intercardinal directions), wind speed (Beaufort number) and precipitation (mm). Qualitative information about the weather situations occurring at the stations for example: weather condition near to the surface like haze, fog, dew etc. and the sky overhead situation (cloudiness) is described using pictorial and abstract symbols. is reproduced in the and including the quantitative and qualitative meteorological variables with all the letters, numbers and symbols. Column names are given in English, Hungarian and German languages. The explanations of weather symbols used in the and are described in . The definition of fog has remained unchanged since the first international conference of International Meteorological Organisation (IMO) in Vienna in 1873, namely in case of the foggy situations the maximum visibility is less than 1 km [12]. and are presented to show the way in which the meteorological data was registered in the yearbooks.\n\nThe dataset consists of daily weather observations for 24 stations recorded 3 times a day at 07:00, 14:00 and 21:00 local time. In this study only the data of fog occurrence has been transformed into MS excel files for each year and station (digitization of the complete synoptic database has also begun). Every MS excel file has been named after the year for which it contains the data. In the MS excel files, the data has been organized stationwise. Occurrence of a fog event has been denoted as ‘1’ while ‘0’ has been used to denote non-occurrence of foggy event. The total number of foggy events occurring at 3 time periods (07:00, 14:00, 21:00) have been summed up across all days in order to get the total number of foggy events occurring during a particular month for every station. No weather station is found to have the data recorded for the whole period of 34 years except Budapest, where the data exists from 1886 – 1919. shows the stations with time periods of data availability. Budapest, Pécs and Nagyszeben/Sibiu related data series exceed 30 years. Majority of the stations have data recorded for more than 15 years. Only 7 stations, mostly in Slovakia (expect Ógyalla/Hurbanovo and Árvaváralja/ Oravský) were found to have data available for 3 – 5 years. Most parallel fog measurements were performed in the period of 1900 – 1915."
