        "text": "This was another successful year in which kids from kindergarten Zapruđe (Zagreb, Croatia) took the\n\nlead role in observing the sky, clouds, and atmosphere changes before, during, and after the “Look Up-Cloud Hunters” competition that took place internationally in April. Children were the age of 6 and were able to understand even more what was going on and why we, or better said “they” were doing this since this was our 2nd year onboarding this competition and conducting easy observations, measurements, and exploration of the cloudy sky. This April we had the luck of having a cloudy sky almost every day so that the children had the opportunity to actually, see the changes and differences in clouds we talked about in theory before conducting the observations on the field. Later on, we discussed the visual differences between the sky in photos during the competition week, and the difference between the clouds; we were trying to learn their names (some were hard so the main point was to just recognize them and what they “mean” or “do” so that we could somewhat “read the sky”), and we were also telling our own stories about the clouds (exp. “The argument of the two clouds” – kids also made simple dolls made out of sticks and cotton and were performing simple doll-theatre shows for each other). Following were also art activities such as “my cloud” (painting of the clouds we saw), and “This cloud reminds me of…” (Comparing clouds to actual people, animals, and things). The final touch was when we decided to try to make a cloud. It sounded insane, unimaginable to children, and that it happened… - We showed kids why it’s important to study, to examine, to question things, to ask questions and even more questions, and even more, and more, and more… We made a cloud in the bottle and this was a big success because afterwards children started to take initiative and were trying to do some more exploration of the sky and clouds.\n\nWill we continue? – Oh yes…Just you try to stop us!\n\nArticle by Izidor Radmanović\n\nZapruđe Kindergarten, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nRead more on:https://wakelet.com/wake/ugeP-gbBiOh6R26qSxave\n\n\"Look Up - Cloud Hunters\" preschool experience:\n\nThe educational group with early learning of the English language \"Little Stars\" participated in the competition \"Look Up - Cloud Hunters\" again this year. Children aged four to seven participated in cloud observation activities, recording observations and observing changes by hand using a tracking card and using the Globe Observer mobile app. The measurements were taken every day between 11 a.m. and 12 o'clock or around 3 p.m., in the period from 18.04. until April 27, 2023. The children also photographed interesting and unusual clouds. Girl (5, 9 years old): \"I'm going to take a photo of this one because it looks like a house.\" The children adopted the concepts of time in that part of the world, and the recorded data was sent to NASA's server, realizing the time and cooperating with the wider community. In addition to following changes in the sky, the children followed and observed changes in nature. Like monitoring the growth of beans from seed, the decay of pumpkins and the movement of earthworms and caterpillars in the kindergarten yard. They took care of the environment by maintaining flower beds and yards, recycling, and learning about the possibilities of renewable energy sources on the occasion of Earth Day. Windmills and \"heavenly\" vehicles (aeroplanes, parachutes, hot air balloons) were constructed from pedagogically unshaped materials. Experiments on the circulation and evaporation of water in nature were carried out. Through the whole set of environmental care activities and observation of changes in nature with an emphasis on cloud research, the children had the opportunity to integrate and connect all the components of the STEM approach.\n\nArticle by Marijana Karapetrić\n\nMaksimir Kindergarten, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nStudents from the 2nd Primary School of Nea Erythraia in Athens, Greece, took part in the \"Look Up - Cloud Hunters 2023\" campaign as part of the class STEM project \"Do Look Up! A Journey from Earth to Space.\" an interdisciplinary project that aimed to inspire 11-year-old students, particularly girls, to become interested in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) by combining STEM and Space education. As a result, the \"Look Up - Cloud Hunters 2023\" campaign was ideal for introducing them to citizen science. assisting them in understanding the importance of clouds on both the local climate system and regional weather, inspiring them to learn more about Earth Observation Satellites, and finally demonstrating how mobile devices, particularly their sensors, can be used to conduct scientific experiments. Some activities involved the entire class during ICT and informatics sessions, while others took place in the afternoon zone with fewer students. The pupils worked in groups, using the computer lab's mobile devices. The teacher has already used the same account to install The NASA Globe Observer Citizen Science smartphone application on multiple mobile devices. Students worked in groups under the supervision and help of their teachers. They carried out various sky observations in the schoolyard using the Clouds Protocol of the NASA Globe Observer app and attempted to complete and upload all of the observations requested by the app. They were amazed and thrilled to be a part of this citizen science program and contribute to giving scientists a more complete image of the clouds in the atmosphere by combining their ground observations with the data collected by satellites. The excitement of conducting scientific outdoor observations using mobile devices encouraged students, both boys and girls, to self-react and take the initiative to navigate through the application, understand exactly what data the application was requesting, carefully observe the sky and clouds, and finally, after several attempts and experiments, register their observations on the application. Because the students' mobile devices lacked a magnetometer sensor, they had to rely on prior knowledge to figure out how to orient themselves to find the four cardinal points (North, South, East, and West) by using sunrise and sunset for approximate directions, in order to complete their observations. After that, observations were made using mobile devices equipped with magnetometer sensors, which helped the students understand how crucial various sensors are for carrying out particular experiments. The students were captivated by the following activity, in which they were requested to check when and which satellites will pass over the school so that they could compare their ground observations with those of the satellites from above. While the NASA satellites METEOSAT-10 and VIIRS NOAA20 were passing over their school, they went outside once more to take their ground measurements. After a few days, they received emails including both their own and the satellites' data, which caused enormous excitement. They were perplexed to see that the satellite observations were quite different from their ground observations. The teams had a lot of debate about this and were motivated to thoroughly study the application instructions again. More recordings will be made in May so that their data can be compared again with those of the satellites. Participating in this activity encouraged students, particularly girls, to study science and technology topics in a playful and innovative manner, while also providing them with the opportunity to participate in real-world research projects. This established the groundwork for additional investigation into the importance of clouds in planetary change, the value of citizen scientific programs, and the role of Earth observation satellites in monitoring Earth, and motivated them to join in future similar investigations. Finally, the students used critical thinking, computational thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills throughout the project, worked in groups, and enhanced their communication, teamwork, and interdisciplinary learning skills.\n\nMore about the whole project \"Do Look Up! A Journey from Earth to Space\": https://wakelet.com/wake/UXIzE87uedL3fPWcG_UpF\n\nArticle by Lascaris Georgia\n\n2nd Primary School of Nea Erythraia, Athens, Greece\n\nThis year fourth graders from primary school \"Braća Seljan\" Karlovac, Croatia, participated in an international competition \"Look Up- Cloud Hunters 2023\" for the first time. The competition was the peak of observation and learning about the clouds for almost whole schoolyear.\n\nFirst, students were learning about main types of clouds, exploring how clouds are formed and where in the sky specific type is located. After that, students were making their own cloud charts. They were put in groups of five. They were given cotton, chalk, carton and water colour tubes and amazing cloud charts were made. We put them on our classroom's wall and used them weekly to help us observing real clouds.\n\nSTEM activities are a big part of our classroom activities and scientific observation of atmoshere and clouds, as well. Although they are only ten, they understood how big their role was and they were all very motivated. In our schoolyard using the Cloud Protocol of NASA globe Observer App protocols we did various sky observations. For this competition students got detailed instructions. Observations were made using their mobile devices. Some amazing photos of clouds were made and children liked the idea of having fun and doing something so important. Children were thrilled to be involved in this competititon and they took it pretty seriously.\n\nWe are looking forward to participate in next year's challenge so much!\n\nArticle by Vladimira Fumić\n\nBraća Seljan Primary school , Karlovac"
