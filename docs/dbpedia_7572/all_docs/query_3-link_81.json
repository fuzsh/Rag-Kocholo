The table below lists which datasets can be freely used for research and/or consultancy. For example, users wishing to use the records provided by CV, UZ and CMEMS for consultancy purposes, must contact these organisations to obtain permission first (or in the case of CMEMS the organisations that provided the data to them). In summary, the data are accessible, but are covered by several different licences, some of which are non-commercial, by-attribution, or a combination of conditions. Access to the data does not currently require authentication, so restricted data are open to all, and we ask users to comply with the license conditions."
