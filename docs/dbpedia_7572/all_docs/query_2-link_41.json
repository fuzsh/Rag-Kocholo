Local authorities are recipients but also re-distributors of heavy rain / flood early warning information.\n\nAs municipality, here you get to know, how to improve your interpretation, assessment and dissemination capabilities for early warning information.\n\nAs private person, you find here useful advice on how to receive warnings and to act in time and in an appropriate manner. You can also find an overview on existing early warning systems in Central Europe and browse our stories on implementation activities.\n\nWhat is EARLY WARNING and how can it contribute to risk reduction?\n\nEarly warning information are standardised messages (signs, words, sound or images) that announce an imminent danger, e.g. from natural hazards. Heavy rain early warning information is dealing with the eponymous natural hazard “heavy rain”. Information is provided by higher authorities, regional or national institutions.\n\nBut early warning information itself does not keep hazards from turning into disasters. It needs entire EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS for enabling individuals at-risk, communities and organisations to prepare and act appropriately – in advance and during impending hazard events.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nPrivate persons\n\nWithin an early warning system, the core role of the local administration or competent authority is to:\n\nBuilt-up sufficient response capabilities for the area,\n\nStrengthen the capacity of individuals’ at-risk and other local key actors to receive, analyse and act-on incoming warnings,\n\nEnhance/complement existing early warning systems by local data,\n\nImprove existing early warning systems by feedback to system developers.\n\nIn most countries of Central Europe, municipal personnel are a key actor for heavy rain early warning systems. They are the living link between incoming early warning information and local action (e.g. when mobilising emergency response). It is their task to know how to access and interpret warning information and how to organise dissemination and adequate action in advance.\n\nPrivate persons are recipients and end users of early warning information. They need to:\n\nBe aware of the natural hazard heavy rain and know their individual risk which is dependent not only from the rainfall but also from local conditions and from their and their families' vulnerability.\n\nRely on and use the early warning information provided by competent authorities.\n\nBuilt-up capacities to receive, to analyse and to act-on early warning information.\n\nHow can I access early-warning information?\n\nIn Central Europe, early warning information are available from different sources. Institutions on different levels – from continental down to regional or community level – run early warning systems. Most early warning systems are accessible online via webpages or special applications for mobile devices. Early warning systems might be accessible also for citizens and private persons, but not all operators provide public access to warnings.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nPrivate persons\n\nMake sure that you benefit from existing functional early warning systems. Find open access options below in our country-specific early warning systems overview.\n\nDependent on local risk and on available early warning information it might be helpful to additionally invest in local monitoring and observation. However, local monitoring alone cannot replace early warning information provided by competent authorities. It only provides supplementary information.\n\nPrepare in advance: by installing apps designed for collecting official warning notifications and weather alerts or by signing up to mass notification systems you can turn your smartphone into an early warning system with individual setting for crisis type, area and so on. Some of these applications also provide recommendations for action or allow exchange and coordination with others. Find some options for Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic below in the early warning app overview.\n\nFurthermore, it is beneficial to bookmark useful web pages for weather forecasts, flood warnings, local river levels. Find open access options below in the country-specific early warning systems overview.\n\nHow should I interpret early warning information?\n\nDealing with heavy rain means dealing with uncertainties. This is because of heavy rainfall events are very difficult to predict, the forecast lead time is very limited, and there is a high chance of forecast errors in spatial occurrence and/or timing of the event. Nevertheless, they are beneficial as they give an indication – also for appropriate emergency response measures.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nPrivate persons\n\nResponsible persons in municipalities need to understand the early warning information they receive, in order to effectively interpret them and set the appropriate measures. Early warning experts could offer exchange with or training of municipality key persons if needed; good municipality substitute planning helps to have a competent early warning person on duty at all times. Qualification sources are e.g.:\n\nInformation as well as trainings provided by operators of early warning systems on interpretation and assessment of early warning information;\n\nInformation provided by more independent sources, like tutorials or free online trainings, e.g. from the EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) consortia.\n\nWhen disseminating early warning information further to recipients, communicate the uncertainty level in a standardised and understandable manner.\n\nMake sure that you know what to do when you receive a warning!\n\nMake yourself familiar with information provided by web pages and apps. Predictability is limited. This is explained somewhere and is to be considered. Furthermore, warnings are often connected to guidance for action.\n\nYou can also contact your municipality to learn more about local emergency alerts, to get information material or to book even a seminar on how to better prepare for flood events and other natural disasters.\n\nHow can I prepare dissemination of early warning information to the key stakeholders and ensure adequate action?\n\nThe translation of early warning information into adequate action requires skills, experiences and also a feeling for strengths and weaknesses of the early warning system that you rely on.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nPrivate persons\n\nTake the following precautionary measures in non-event phases:\n\nMake sure that responsibilities are clear. Who interprets warnings, disseminates them to further recipients and triggers the alarm if necessary? A confirmation of receipt might be required.\n\nClarify the legal framework before starting disseminating early warning information to recipients.\n\nEstablish multiple communication channels and ensure consistency of warning language among them.\n\nEnsure your warnings are clear and easy to understand.\n\nEducate recipients/community on how warnings will be disseminated, how to interpret them and how recipients need to respond to warnings. Communicate priorities and boundaries of emergency operations in your area clearly.\n\nCarry out system wide tests and organise exercises within the community at least once each year.\n\nIn non-event phases, work out and disseminate further recommendations for action to citizens. Make sure that they focus on private property protection and on flood protective behaviour of the public. With respect to heavy rain, always stress two key facts:\n\nHeavy rainfall can happen everywhere and is expected to increase in frequency and intensity.\n\nThe predictability of convective heavy rain events is very limited and forecasts are uncertain.\n\nThe following information are mainly taken and adopted from the official flood information service of the British Government. Please also search for information from national, regional or local authorities in your language and based on flood / heavy rain risk management in your area.\n\nDo not wait until it rains to start preparations; you won’t have time then!\n\nFind out if you’re at risk.\n\nSign up for warnings.\n\nKnow how to turn off gas, electricity and water in your home.\n\nAsk your municipality about flood protection advice and design your personal emergency plan.\n\nGet permits before you build; PREVENT DAMAGES at your house and property by appropriate private protection measures.\n\nProtect your property by advance measures: Visit our CATALOGUE OF 100 RISK REDUCTION MEASURES for further information.\n\nAlways report blocked ditches, swales and channels to your municipality.\n\nCheck your insurance: Make sure you have an insurance to protect your home or business. If you have a buildings and contents insurance, check if flood damage is included. A natural hazard insurance against damage caused by heavy rain covers all contents of the flat or house.\n\nConnect to local flood groups on social media and contact your community for volunteering options: Your area may have community flood wardens. These are volunteers who e.g. monitor a specific local area and inform its residents when flooding is likely or you can volunteer in a fire or water brigade.\n\nEarly warning systems overview\n\nEarly warning systems are based on robust and reliable communication infrastructure hardware, operate 24 hours a day and use multiple communication channels. Some early warning systems consider multi-hazard-scenarios. Heavy rain and pluvial flood early warning systems deal either with meteorological or with hydrological data or with a combination of both types.

(input data, method) [Source of the following text: Hungarian Meteorological Service (2019): “Public weather warning system of the Hungarian Meteorological Service” (pdf, 186 KB)] Outlooks and warnings are issued for following weather phenomena: thunderstorm, torrential rain, wind gust, freezing rain, blowing snow. Very short-range warnings (alerts) on these phenomena are not issued! In general, the area, on which outlooks and warnings are issued, varies in size but the smallest area, for which the forecasts apply, is usually equivalent to half of an average county in Hungary. Where to get information and how to interpret them? (communication products/channels, guidance how to interpret the information/graphics etc.) The severe weather information is provided in two steps.\n\nIn the first step, an outlook information is issued in both text and map form, which is valid for today and tomorrow, in which we can find the description of the likeliest spatial and temporal evolution of severe weather phenomena.\n\nIn the second step, when the severe weather meteorologist recognizes (upon measurements, observations, numerical weather prediction models) that the weather conditions are favourable for occurrence of severe phenomena, already indicated in the outlook, warning (alert) is issued in map form, usually half an hour to three hours before the event. It depends on the type of the severe weather or on the weather situation, whether the warning can be issued a few hours before the event will start to form, or only at the beginning of its evolution.\n\nThree warning levels are distinguished for both outlooks and warnings. If no severe phenomena are expected, which would meet the criteria, the area on the map appears in green colour. Lead Time Warnings are usually issued with lead-time of 0.5-3 hours. Update Cycle Dependent on the weather situation, the warning, once issued, can remain valid for 3 to 6, or even up to 12 hours. In most of the cases, after such time, the warnings are either updated or cancelled. Because warning is a forecast product, it can be modified, updated anytime, upon most recent data and information.\n\nPoland\n\nName\n\nISOK – The IT system of the Country’s Protection Against Extreme Hazards (Informatyczny System Osłony Kraju przed nadzwyczajnymi zagrożeniami: ISOK)\n\nURL\n\nhttps://imgw.isok.gov.pl/imap_imgw/\n\nType\n\nWarning system against meteorological hazards and weather extremes\n\nOperator and spatial scope\n\nA consortium of Polish institutions, including the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management – National Research Institute (IMGW-PIB)\n\nHow does it work?\n\n(input data, method)\n\nISOK is a comprehensive, advanced tool for analysing and warning against dangerous meteorological and hydrological phenomena. The Map Portal of ISOK is one of the main components of the system that publishes a range of information on hazards caused by meteorological and hydrological conditions. The Map Portal includes among others: Warnings issued by IMGW-PIB, Maps of Meteorological Hazards, Flood Risk Maps, Flood Hazard Maps. The Meteorological Hazard Maps provide two type of maps: (i) climatological maps – spatial variability of the occurrence of extreme weather phenomena that have occurred in recent decades and (ii) operational/prognostic maps – present the areas where these phenomena are currently forecasted. The operational (prognostic) hazard maps provide early information to the public about the possibility of occurrence a dangerous meteorological phenomenon.\n\nThe Operational Meteorological Hazard maps are generated automatically in the system and provide forecasts for the nearest 12, 24, and 48 h with spatial resolution of the model of about 7.7 km (currently).\n\nWarnings issued by IMGW-PIB provide important severe weather information, according to the criteria for different alert levels (moderate, high, very high).\n\nMeteorological warning is a special type of weather forecast focused only on a phenomenon, its intensity and impact that causes dangerous situation. Issuing a warning means that the probability of the phenomenon occurring is very high and its intensity will threaten the safety or life of the people and causes property damages. The issue of a meteorological warning is crucial information for crisis management services. When they receive such a meteorological warning, they take additional measures to protect health and human life and property.\n\nWhere to get information and how to interpret them?\n\n(communication products/channels, guidance how to interpret the information/graphics etc.)\n\nISOK is an important element supporting crisis management in Poland and information platform for institutions responsible for protection of flood risk areas.\n\nWarnings and Meteorological Hazards Maps are available for everyone without the need to log in. A user who registers in the Mobile Application of the ISOK system receives warnings about hazards and other dangers related to natural phenomena. A registered user receives warnings as text messages (SMS) or e-mails only for a specific interest area chosen by the user.\n\nLead Time\n\nNext 12, 24, and 48 hours (Operational Meteorological Hazard Maps).

In the frame of RAINMAN, comprehensive analysis and mapping of pluvial flood risks and pluvial flood hazards for the City of Zagreb and for the City of Umag has been done. This analysis enabled definition of critical rain thresholds and consequently warning levels proposal. Internal testing of proposed thresholds against ALADIN and ECMWF forecasts is still under way as during the project there were no significant pluvial episodes to validate it. If the system proves to be beneficial, further activities on its administrative setup are foreseen to put it to operational use and available to broader audience as well as to cover other parts of Croatia with it.\" (Alan Cibilić, Croatian Waters, Croatia)\n\nDevelopment of a mobile warning app in Hungary\n\n\"Applications for mobile devices are nice tools and can make the defense works more smooth.

The City of Graz uses a traffic light system for triggering predefined operational measures and for informing the population of Graz about the current hazard situation. Recommendations were developed for improving this system by consideration of all available data to receive more precise heavy rain warnings. In addition to the precipitation, other parameters influence the runoff in an area, such as preceding soil moisture, vegetation cover, snow melting, snowfall, degree of sealing.\" (Cornelia Jöbstl, Office of the Styrian Government, Austria)"
