        "text": "The Institute encompasses virtually all aspects concerned with sea exploration: physical, chemical, geological, biological and fisheries. In its seventy years of existence, the scientists at the Institute have published over 1800 scientific and professional papers in both domestic and foreign publications. International co-operation has been developed in a variety of ways.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the scientists at the Institute have participated in the work of the International Commission for the Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean (CIESMM). The Institute works with various organisations of the United Nations. These include:\n\nThe General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM)\n\nThe Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)\n\nThe World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO)\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n\nand The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP).\n\nBilateral and multilateral co-operation on various projects also exists with the following countries: Italy, Greece, Poland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Norway, EU and the USA. Some international projects Institute ahd involved are: MEDALPEX, POEM, MEDAR-MEDATLAS, SEASEARCH, ADRIAMED, PELMON, DEMON, SIPAM, MEDUSA, EACE, MAMA, ITHACA, MEDITS, ESEAS, SEADATANET, ADRICOSM, DOLCEVITA etc. The Institute has also prepared a large number of applicative studies and analyses for various organisations, firms, municipalities, and for the Government of Croatia. These are primarily studies of the environmental implications of various activities, monitoring of seawater quality and fish stock assessment for commercial purposes. The Institute has published the scientific journal Acta Adriatica since 1932. It publishes original scientific papers on the oceanography of the Adriatic and Mediterranean. Each paper was previously issued as a separate publication; but since 1979, has appeared as two issues within a single annual volume. 593 papers have been published in 42 volumes to date. The Institute releases a number of other editions as well: Monographs, Fauna and Flora of the Adriatic Sea (4 volumes to date), Notes (86 published to date), Report of the Biological Fisheries Expedition m/b Hvar (17 papers in 6 volumes),Special editions (7 books to date),Studies and surveys (various technological reports, ca 1000 reports to date).\n\nThe Institute is also co-organizer, together with the University of Split, for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Fishery Technology and Marine Ecology. The scientific staff of the Institute gives lectures at the post-graduate level of Oceanography at the University of Zagreb. Occasionally, short seminars are held for university students. The staff of the Institute takes lectures at the Faculty of Technology, the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Split."
