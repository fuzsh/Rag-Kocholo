It’s clear today that distributed architectures are the new standard—whether businesses have planned for it or not.\n\nAt AppWorld 2024, we announced the F5 AI Data Fabric, a new data platform to deliver on the promise of AI. This innovation is a big step toward putting AI to work to deliver better app and API protection, more quickly, and with a ridiculously easy experience for users.\n\nAll day every day, APIs power the apps we use to purchase our coffee, badge into the door at the office, grab a rideshare, check the weather, and finally sit down at the end of a long day to stream a beloved TV show. Nearly every organization that we interact with daily relies on APIs to drive their digital business."
