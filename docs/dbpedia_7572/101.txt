The future WMO office for projects will be opened in the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service (DHMZ) in Zagreb.

The Croatian government will set aside HRK 340,000 from the state budget for that purpose.

The office will coordinate projects for southeast Europe worth billions of kuna, said Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) parliamentarian Marko PaviÄ‡ today.

Domagoj Prica of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) commended the performance of the national DHMZ weather service.

The office of this specialised United Nations agency for weather and climate as well as for operational hydrology will help promote Croatia as a centre of excellence in this sector.

The WMO is an intergovernmental organization with a membership of 193 Member States and Territories. It originated from the International Meteorological Organization, the roots of which were planted at the 1873 Vienna International Meteorological Congress.
