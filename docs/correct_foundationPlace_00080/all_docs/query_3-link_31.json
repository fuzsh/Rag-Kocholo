        "text": "Overview\n\nWhere creative risk-takers become inspired future-makers\n\nWe prepare students for the unknown\n\nDesign at CCA begins with a quest, and the designer’s role is to find the best path forward, whether they’re asked to imagine the future of music or replacing plastics with sustainable alternatives. This spirit of inquiry is at the heart of our discipline. As students learn to embrace new methods of thinking and making through hands-on investigations and real-world challenges, they continually add to their design toolkits. They develop, fine-tune, or reinvent a deep set of craft skills, along with the ability to conceptualize solutions that make the world more ethical, sustainable, and enjoyable. With an ever-shifting and exciting landscape before them, our graduates emerge from CCA as interdisciplinary makers ready to take on a range of roles that require visionary thinking and a passion for pushing and expanding the boundaries of design.\n\nStudy design in the inspiring Bay Area\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is home to innovative technology companies, leading animation and film studios, renowned cultural institutions, world-class museums, and groundbreaking design and architecture firms. Whether exploring San Francisco’s museums and galleries or working collaboratively with partners such as Google, Oracle, and Institute for the Future in sponsored studios, you’ll find inspiration in the boundless creativity and technological leadership that characterize the Bay Area’s unique culture and opportunities. And CCA has its own built-in network of creative practitioners, with a community of faculty and alumni eager to share ideas and offer feedback.\n\nAn ethos of change-making theory and practice\n\nCCA’s Design division is a sanctuary for creative risk-taking, where wonder and imagination are amplified through rigor and craft. We equip makers, thinkers, and doers with the wherewithal to envision alternative futures, and the creative capacity to deliver inspired, generative solutions.\n\nCCA advances contemporary practice and the self-realization of the designer as a dynamic agent of cultural, social, and ecological change, while providing strategic access to specialized resources and deep professional networks.\n\nWe do so through formal preparation in the art of design, in systems thinking, problematization, storytelling, experimentation, and business strategy, all nurtured by the boundlessness, technological leadership and non-conformity particularly characteristic of Bay Area culture.\n\nDonate to the Diversity in Design Scholarship Challenge at CCA\n\nHelp support a new generation of diverse design practitioners and leaders; and expand design education to underrepresented groups.\n\nMake a gift\n\nCommunity\n\nUnite ideas and craft\n\nMeet the Dean of Design\n\nDean Helen Maria Nugent studied environmental art and design at the Glasgow School of Art. With a portfolio of design-driven public art projects, and encouragement from undergraduate faculty, Nugent decided to pursue a graduate degree in design. Afterward, her path led her to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she taught and founded the renowned Found Objects program. Nugent’s experience co-developing curricula that integrate multiple disciplines has shaped what it means to study design today at CCA.\n\nIn addition to her scholarly and academic endeavors, Nugent is the co-founder of HAELO Design with Ron Kirkpatrick. HAELO is an independent, research-oriented studio that pursues speculative and commercial design projects with a focus on furniture, objects, services, and exhibition design. The studio’s commercial and speculative design work has been presented at the 2nd Istanbul Design Biennial, The Chicago Cultural Center, the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, NeoCon, and Devening Projects + Editions.\n\nThe best design school for designer/makers\n\nDean Helen Maria Nugent explains how we prepare students with visual literacy and craftmaking skills—ones that go beyond prototyping—to make informed decisions about materiality, technology, and future-focused solutions.\n\nRead our interview with Dean Nugent\n\nFaculty are creative practitioners and design leaders\n\nOur dedicated faculty create a vibrant studio culture that unites ideas and craft. The hands-on, digital, and hybrid tools we use in our studios impact the ways we investigate and create solutions. Faculty foster collaborative experiences that help students expand their analytical skills and their ability to practice artistry in design. Ethical, elegant, sustainable, and profound design solutions inspire our daily research, prototyping, and speculative work with students.\n\nFaculty expertise intersects broad fields of practice, including game design, publishing, global branding, enterprise applications, fashion illustration, photography, mixed media sculpture, user experience design, consumer electronics, and motion graphics, among many others. Some faculty work for top companies like Apple, IDEO, Facebook, and Google, while others run their own design studios or consultancies. What they all have in common is their commitment to providing an exceptional design education at one of the most exciting art and design schools in the United States.\n\nEvents that span disciplines with experts from around the globe\n\nAs a center for thought leadership in new and emerging design practices, CCA is a magnet for today’s most compelling voices in global design. Through our year-round lecture series, you’ll have opportunities to learn from the design world’s leading practice-oriented business leaders, graphic novelists, interdisciplinary artists, architects, filmmakers, and other designers who approach their work from a wide spectrum of perspectives. We also regularly curate and present exhibitions that foster collaboration among CCA programs. An exhibition could, for example, incorporate interactive media, digital fabrication, kinetics, and generative art. Our goal is to explore how different methods of inquiry and modes of making can drive real cultural, social, and practical change.\n\nExplore upcoming events\n\nWatch and learn with us\n\nEach semester, the Design Division hosts a powerful slate of thinkers and practitioners who expand our idea of what design is and what design can do. The Spring 2024 Design Lecture Series reflects CCA Design’s commitment to being a sanctuary for emerging voices and diverse practices.\n\nTypecraft: Handcrafted display typefaces from rich South Asian crafts\n\nDesign is Not Just for Pretty Things\n\nBuilding a Thoughtful Life: Lessons from Slow Fashion\n\nScott Shigeoka: Curiosity Is Your Superpower\n\nDesigners in Dialogue: Pioneers on AI and IXD\n\nChronicle Books: the Joy, Irreverence, and Craft of Publishing\n\nAll Together: The Origin Story of 1% for the Planet and Patagonia\n\nDecolonizing Design\n\nCCA recognizes the structures of oppression and colonization that permeate our educational systems, cultural organizations, and creative industries, and acknowledges the responsibility of higher education to confront racial and social inequities through our curriculum and programs. To this end, all undergraduates complete both seminar and studio requirements in Critical Ethnic Studies, one of the earliest programs of its kind when it was founded at CCA in 1970, and today the only such dedicated program in a U.S. art and design school. The Decolonial School is a collaboration among CCA’s divisions of Design, Fine Arts, and Humanities and Sciences. This interdisciplinary cohort of CCA faculty is committed to building a new curricular model for art and design education that foregrounds Indigenous practices and acknowledges decolonization as a continuous process. As Assistant Professor and Decolonial School member Juan Carlos Rodriguez Rivera writes, design through a decolonial frame involves envisioning “new possible futures that are non-oppressive and non-hierarchical.”\n\nExplore Design\n\n@ccadesigndivision\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nWomen of Interaction Design Part ll: Mabel Addis ✨\n\nShe designed the first narrative, simulation game based on the ancient Mesopotamian civilization, Sumeria, in 1964 with IBM and Bruse Moncrieff called “The Sumerian Game”. 📜\n\nCheck out Erin Malone’s story about Mabel Addis by clicking on the link in our bio. @erin_8pawpress @ccaixd @cacollegeofarts\n\n#thsims4 #simcity #sumerians #gamedesign #femaledesigner\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\n“I am the devoured and the devourer.” 🔥\n\nCheck out these epic sweaters by 2024 graphic design grad Sam Beutelschies. @ccagd @cacollegeofarts\n\nAwesome work, Sam!

At the end of a three-year curriculum, graduates earn both degrees and the high-level design capabilities to maximize their impact across a variety of design roles.\n\nPartnerships & Research\n\nExperimentation in action\n\nIt’s no accident that the same region that sparked the creative counterculture of the 1970s and propelled the technology boom of the 2000s continues to ignite cultural and technological innovation today. The San Francisco Bay Area has long been a sanctuary for boundless ideas, technological leadership, and nonconformity, making it the ideal environment for students, faculty, and industry professionals to mix it up in forward-leaning partnerships. Through a robust network of professional and community partnerships, CCA students collaborate with creative industries in the Bay Area and beyond to tackle real-world problems with right-now solutions.\n\nFeatured partnership: Studio Forward\n\nSponsored by Google\n\nBreak down the walls between disciplines, and space opens up for radical collaboration and transformation. Our work becomes both sharper and more expansive.\n\nThis premise informs Studio Forward, a partnership between CCA and Google. Studio Forward deploys the power of design to rethink the future of digital belonging. Exploring identity and inclusion and reimagining collective experience in the digital landscape. Together, students, faculty, and industry experts enlist new approaches to design education and envision digital futures that are inclusive, desirable, and connected. A cohort of students will go on to intensive summer internships, where they will advance the work of the studio and ready it for public presentation.\n\nFeatured Partnership: Designing the Future of Music\n\nWith LAD Design and the Imperial College London\n\nThe Designing the Future of Music is an ongoing collaboration of CCA's Design Futures Lab with the Imperial College London’s Global Innovation Design program in London and Grammy-award-winning designer, art director, and alum Lawrence Azerrad (BFA Graphic Design 1995) of LAD Design in Los Angeles. Through international workshops and conversations with industry thought leaders in music, production, and design, the student teams consider the future trajectories of music authorship, ownership, and collaborative experience. Their imaginative proposals demonstrate how interdisciplinary collaboration, global partnership, and creative research lead to ideas that can transform our world for the better.\n\nFeatured partnership: Designing for Trust\n\nSponsored by Oracle\n\nGreat products don’t just function well, they connect in meaningful ways to the human experience. When CCA and Oracle set out to develop a mutually beneficial partnership, they focused on the idea of common human truths—in this case, trust. In the Designing for Trust course, CCA senior interaction design students partnered with Oracle Design to think holistically about automation, smart machines, and the human implications of both from a customer-experience standpoint. As they focused on what it means to be a trustworthy designer, students brought the wonder, rigor, and optimism baked into CCA’s Interaction Design program to the halls of Oracle, where they were immersed in the real-world context of design in a leading global company.\n\nPartner with a top-ranking college\n\nPlease get in touch to learn more about past and ongoing projects and how we can partner on the next big thing.\n\nTake the next step\n\nFeatured partnership: Industrial designers reimagine mobility with Ford\n\nSponsored by Ford\n\nCCA students and faculty collaborate with Ford Motor Company to envision the future of transportation.
