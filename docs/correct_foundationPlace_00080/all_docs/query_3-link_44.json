        "text": "If you don't have access to ArcGIS Pro or an ArcGIS organizational account, see options for software access.\n\nThe project contains a map with point data in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data was collected via the Gowalla social media platform, which was active between 2007 and 2012. Gowalla allowed users to check in at locations they visited. Each point represents a location where a Gowalla user checked in.\n\nBased on the map, answer the following questions:\n\nDo certain places contain more check-ins than others?\n\nHow might you define an area to be popular using these check-ins?\n\nThe data is densely clustered. How much insight can you gain just from looking at the map?\n\nNext, you'll investigate the data's attributes.\n\nThe tools runs and a hexagon grid is added to the map. (Its default symbology is random and may differ from the example image.)\n\nNext, you'll count the number of check-ins within each hexagon bin. You're not interested in areas where no check-ins were made or where no data was collected, so first you'll select the bins that intersect at least one check-in.\n\nWhen running a geoprocessing tool on a layer that has an active selection, such as your hexagon grid, the tool only uses the selected features for analysis. Features that aren't selected won't be used in the analysis.\n\nThe report file appears on a new browser tab.\n\nThe report includes the Moran's Index, the z-score, and the p-value. For determining statistical significance, the z-score is the most important of these values.\n\nThe z-score indicates the number of standard deviations a value is from the average value. Positive z-scores are values above the average, while negative z-scores are values below the average. In this case, the value being measured is the amount of spatial autocorrelation that exists between features in your dataset.\n\nYour data's z-score is over 7, meaning that your data has significantly more spatial autocorrelation when compared to a hypothetical collection of randomly distributed data. The report also contains a chart that plots the z-score on the far right end of a bell curve. The chart indicates that there is statistical significance to the distribution of your data, and that it is clustered (meaning similar values in the data are closer together).\n\nThis tool provides three methods for spatial clustering, with each method requiring a different definition of what is considered dense and not dense. You'll run the tool three times, one for each method, and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nFirst, you'll use the defined distance method, also known as DBSCAN, which is the simplest density-based clustering method. In this method, density is defined by having a specified number of points within a specified distance. At every point, it checks whether the point satisfies the minimum number of features within a set search distance. If a point satisfies this criterion, it is marked as a clustered point. To run the tool, you must define the minimum number of features. You can also define the search distance, but if you do not set a search distance, the tool uses an optimized value.\n\nThe minimum number of features per cluster depends on your data and the problem you want to solve. You want to identify popular places in the Bay Area. You don't know an exact number of check-ins that makes a place popular, but you can define a number based on your business' circumstances. For instance, assume you want to open a night club in the Bay Area and plan to charge fees that will require at least 500 customers per day to make a profit. In this example, you can define the minimum number of features per cluster to be 500. You can set the search distance to about 0.1 miles, roughly the size of a city block.\n\nOn the map, the colored points represent dense clusters of check-in points. The gray points represent noise, or any location that did not fit your definition of dense.\n\nThe legend provides insight on the symbology:\n\nDensity-based clustering can find hundreds of clusters in a dataset. Rather than symbolize each cluster with a different color, eight distinct colors are used. The results are displayed so that clusters with similar colors are not close together, making the distinctions between clusters clearer on the map. The colors do not correspond to any attribute in the data.\n\nOn the map, clusters are primarily located in San Francisco and the South Bay, with a few clusters located in other places. You'll change the basemap and zoom in to learn more.\n\nThe map extent returns to show the entire Bay Area.\n\nOverall, there are only a few clusters outside of San Francisco. One of the limitations of the DBSCAN method of clustering is that it uses a fixed distance for determining density. (When you ran the tool, you set this distance to 0.1 miles.) The distance chosen can significantly influence results. While a smaller distance may be appropriate for areas such as downtown San Francisco, where stores and other points of interest are close together, it may not be appropriate for suburban or rural areas where stores are more spread out.\n\nYour study area encompasses cities, suburbs, and rural areas, so using a single fixed distance may not provide the best results. Next, you'll perform density-based clustering using the self-adjusting method, also called HDBSCAN.\n\nHDBSCAN detects clusters at multiple search distances, similar to if DBSCAN were run multiple times. At each search distance, it detects different clusters in different locations. Then, DBSCAN attempts to merge these clusters to create larger clusters that all have a similar point density. The resulting clusters are not defined by a single search distance.\n\nCompared to the DBSCAN method, the HDBSCAN method detects more clusters. Clusters appear all over the Bay Area, including in rural areas, and some of these clusters are large enough to cover entire cities, such as the clusters in Santa Rosa or Vallejo. While these results indicate more popular locations in the Bay Area, the results may not be enough to pinpoint the best place to open a new business.\n\nNext, you'll use the third spatial clustering method, multi-scale (also called OPTICS).\n\nThe OPTICS method records the distance between the first feature in a dataset (Order ID 0) and its nearest neighbor. This distance is called the reachability distance. Then, the method records the reachability distance between the nearest neighbor and its nearest neighbor. This process repeats continually until the entire dataset has been covered. No nearest neighbor is repeated; if one feature's nearest neighbor was also the nearest neighbor of a previous feature, the next nearest neighbor is used instead.\n\nThen, the OPTICS method charts all of the reachability distances and looks for peaks and valleys in the chart. A valley, or a group of features with relatively low reachability distances, is a cluster of points that are close together. Once all of the points in a cluster are charted, the next point, which is not part of the cluster, will have a relatively high reachability distance, corresponding to a peak in the chart.\n\nThe following diagram shows an example reachability chart and the corresponding clusters of points:\n\nIn this example, all of the blue points are close together, so there is a low reachability distance between them. (The red lines represent the reachability distance from point to point.) On the chart, these points correspond to the blue valley. Then, there is a relatively large distance between the last blue point and its next unique nearest neighbor, corresponding to a sharp increase in reachability distance on the chart.\n\nIn the green valley, there is a peak that is relatively small compared to the two larger peaks on either side of the valley. Depending on the OPTICS algorithm's cluster sensitivity, this small peak may divide the valley in two or it may still be considered part of the valley.\n\nThe data clock updates.\n\nThe data clock contains significantly more rings, but only seven wedges in each ring, one for each day of the week. Based on this data clock, the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have the highest number of check-ins. This pattern makes sense, as most people don't have to work on the weekends and thus have more leisure time to visit places.\n\nDepending on the type of business you plan to start, you may also be interested in the times of day that check-ins occurred. Visualizing a year's worth of hourly data would be difficult, so you'll create a feature class that only contains a subset of the data and create a chart for it.\n\nThe chart appears.\n\nThe colors assigned to each bin are assigned randomly and yours may differ from the example images. Regardless of color, the numbers are the same and the data tells the same story.\n\nIn the Average Time Series per Cluster chart shown above, the blue hexagons are locations that historically have few check-ins. (They all have had at least one check-in, or they wouldn't be included at all.) The green hexagons are locations with more check-ins however, although the check-in counts are high, the number of check-ins fluctuates significantly from month to month. On the map, only one green hexagon was identified (in downtown San Francisco). These fluctuations may be due to seasonal variations in tourism. The red cluster contains downtown locations that may be frequented by locals, resulting in relatively consistent popularity throughout the year.\n\nYou identified clusters of locations with similar numbers of check-ins over time. You can also identify clusters of areas with similar temporal trends. For instance, say that two areas encounter similar increases and decreases in check-ins over time due to seasonal changes in tourism. However, one of these areas has a significantly higher total number of check-ins than the other. When clustering based on value, these areas are not clustered together. But when clustering based on profile, they are.\n\nClustering locations by profile is useful for businesses that intend to target a specific seasonal crowd. Profile clustering can be accomplished by one of two methods. You'll use the Fourier Family-based time series clustering method. The Fourier method identifies areas with different changes to popularity throughout the year.\n\nHot spots are located in downtown San Francisco, as well as several smaller cities south of the bay, such as Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Most of the hot spots in downtown San Francisco are persistent hot spots, meaning they have been hot spots consistently across time. The other areas are mostly either new hot spots, meaning they were hot spots only at the end of the time series, or sporadic hot spots, meaning they have been hot spots some times but not others.\n\nNote that areas that were characterized with high and medium count clusters by time series clustering show up as consecutive hot spots. This implies the vicinity of these areas is higher than the average number of check-ins for the Bay Area for most of the time steps. In other words, these areas were more popular than the rest of the Bay Area for most of the time steps in the space time cube. Unlike San Francisco, these areas appear to be increasing in popularity over time.\n\nYou can also visualize the results in 3D."
