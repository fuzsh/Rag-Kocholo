That experience featured Grant’s development of effective and efficient frameworks for establishing clear expectations, hiring the most capable team members, and facilitating exceptional communication and execution throughout the planning and building process. Grant then translated his experience, creativity, rigor, and service to the broader market by starting Peak Projects in 2014. Under his leadership, Peak has steadily grown, reflecting an expanding portfolio, while building a reputation as both an innovator in the industry and trusted advisor to exceptional projects globally.\n\nA Michigan native, Grant earned his undergraduate degree at Brown University, where he pole vaulted on its NCAA Division I Track & Field team.
