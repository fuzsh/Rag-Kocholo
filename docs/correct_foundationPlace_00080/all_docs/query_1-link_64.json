The capital will support expansion of the companyâs platform and offerings through product innovation and strategic acquisitions. In conjunction with the investment, Earned announced the acquisition of Thomas Doll, a leading provider of financial services to medical professionals and practices. Today, Earned serves more than 3,000 clients, with over $2 billion in assets under management.\n\nEarnedâs mission is to redefine financial services for healthcare professionals through creating the first tech-enabled, integrated personal financial management platform offering wealth, tax, career advisory, insurance, and other services designed for the complex needs of doctors. Using a medical professionalâs career journey as a lens, Earned combines deep prognostic technology with a comprehensive set of financial services provided by fiduciary advisors who deeply understand the unique challenges doctors face. With an exclusive focus on medical professionals, Earned advisors are well equipped to guide decisions ranging from medical school loan repayment schedules and private practice buy-ins to medical group malpractice insurance coverage and optimal tax strategies during a practice sale. Earnedâs evidence-based approach can proactively and continuously help optimize financial decision-making across nearly every aspect of their clientsâ financial lives.\n\nâFrom the beginning, weâve been firmly focused on building the premier go-to destination for doctors who are seeking to optimize their financial well-being, delivering tailored solutions and services that allow them to focus on what they do best,â said John Clendening, Founder and CEO of Earned. âTodayâs announcement represents a critical step on our journey to further transform financial outcomes for these heroes of our society. With the addition of Thomas Doll, we broaden our capabilities and expand into serving medical practices, a key lever of income and wealth for many of our clients. With the support of Summit and Silversmith, and the benefit of their deep experience in the healthcare and financial services sectors, we are positioned to accelerate our M&A strategy, drive growth, further invest in our technology and team and solidify Earnedâs industry leadership position.â\n\nâDoctors face distinct â and often complex â financial circumstances and opportunities throughout their careers, from residency through retirement. The Earned platform is purpose-built to provide holistic solutions to help optimize for the needs of healthcare professionals,â said Darren Black, a Managing Director at Summit Partners who has joined Earnedâs Board of Directors. âWe are excited by the scalability of the Earned platform and the teamâs comprehensive, evidenced-based approach. John and his team bring an impressive combination of client-centricity, expertise, and execution, and we look forward to supporting Earned in their growth and expansion nationwide.â Â\n\nâMedical professionals have long been underserved by todayâs highly fragmented wealth management industry.

We look forward to working with John and his team as they continue to both build and acquire leading financial solutions to serve our healthcare industry.â\n\nThe Thomas Doll acquisition will help accelerate the combined companyâs growth and expand the breadth of financial services offerings. Thomas Doll clients will benefit from Earnedâs comprehensive wealth management approach, trusted fiduciary advisors, and proprietary tech platform.\n\nâThomas Doll checks all our boxes in terms of the kinds of firms we are seeking to acquire: a strong focus on healthcare professionals, terrific client service, a desire to accelerate growth, and complete alignment on vision and mission. Iâm excited to welcome Thomas Dollâs clients, employees, and leadership to the Earned family,â said Clendening. âI have great respect for the organization that Thomas Doll has built over the past sixty years, and I am confident that our shared values and complementary services will help unlock a new chapter of growth together.â\n\nâTogether, we share a commitment to serving the needs of healthcare professionals and a belief that a broad range of tailored services will help us improve their overall financial health,â said Barry Oliver, a Senior Advisor with Thomas Doll. âI am personally thrilled about this partnership, and I am confident that our future together is bright.â\n\nThomas Doll has re-branded to Thomas Doll, An Earned Wealth Company.

This follows Allegoâs leader status in The Forrester Waveâ¢: Sales Content Solutions, Q4 2022. According to the Sales Readiness report, âAllego delivers with its platform and delights with its service. Allego began in 2013 with its initial sales video coaching application, and has grown from there to make smart, measured investments into the platform. Along with continuous sales readiness innovation, it recently added a strong entry into the sales content solutions market as well. The success of Allegoâs strategy is rooted in its deep understanding of the changing buyer landscapeâ¦â\n\nâAt Allego, our drive is to provide the most innovative and comprehensive sales readiness and enablement solution in the market,â said Yuchun Lee, CEO and co-founder of Allego. âReceiving the highest possible score from Forrester in the innovation and adoption criteria, and now being recognized as a leader across both Sales Readiness, Q4 2023 and Sales Content Solutions, Q4 2022 evaluations, only solidifies for us our position as one of the most forward-thinking Revenue Enablement providers in the market.â\n\nThe content and readiness spaces are now converging into comprehensive revenue enablement platforms. In todayâs dynamic sales environment, arming sales teams with the right skills, knowledge, and content is paramount. Sales and enablement teams face many challenges: from limited time to coach effectively, to struggles with consistent messaging, to driving knowledge retention and behavior change.\n\nTraditional approaches to these problems fall short. The old training paradigm consisting mainly of formal courses and quizzes often leads to information overload that doesnât get retained, and whatâs worse, the learning content is quickly rendered obsolete.\n\nAllego stands at the forefront of the shift towards modern revenue enablement. With Allegoâs GO Platform and EnablementAI, organizations can streamline sales learning and content, drawing from both internal peer-to-peer and external seller-to-buyer interactions. This enables coaches and sellers to collaborate efficiently and sell as a team, ensuring that valuable selling time remains uninterrupted. Sellers can quickly tap into peer knowledge, while managers can pinpoint role-specific skill gaps, providing real-time guidance and mobile reinforcements that sync with sellersâ work rhythm.\n\nThe Forrester Sales Readiness report evaluated 11 companies based on 31 criteria across three categories: current offering, strategy, and market presence. Allego received the highest score possible across 19 of the criteria including: adoption, innovation, end-user experience, coaching recommendations, mobile support, and customer success.\n\nâAllegoâs modern enablement platform has given our team the flexibility to train sales teams when and where it works for them, through an interface that is extremely intuitive to navigate. Allegoâs customer success team has been a critical partner that continues to be by our side every single day. And with Allegoâs periodic product enhancements, including use of AI, we know we have the best platform to meet our needs now and in the futureâ said Guillermo Gonzalez, Director, US Sales Training, Meetings & Events at Abbott.\n\nThis recognition by Forrester comes on the heels of Allegoâs inclusion as a key vendor in the 2023 Gartner Market Guide for Revenue Enablement Platforms and a notable vendor in Forresterâs Sales Readiness Solutions Landscape, Q2 2023.\n\nTo learn more about Allegoâs inclusion in The Forrester Waveâ¢: Sales Readiness Solutions, Q4 2023 or to download a copy of the report, visit Allego.com.\n\nAbout Allego\n\nAllego is the leading provider of modern revenue enablement software.
