This new project is a central place for students, faculty, and staff to come together and pray the daily prayers in jama’ah, as the Holy Prophet ﷺ urged us to. This blessed place is a sanctuary from the world, from which the call to prayer crosses the campus. We’re delighted to share this milestone with you and need your support to finish this project.\n\nAs inheritors of a great tradition, we’re committed to educating tomorrow’s leaders and contributing to the commonweal today, through public scholarship and education. Your gift of knowledge helps our students—unburdened by debt and empowered by the study of the Islamic and the Euro-American intellectual traditions—begin to transform the world, God-willing."
