        "text": "Our History\n\nAIDS/LifeCycle is a 7 day, 545-mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, co-produced by and benefiting San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center. We make sure that pedaling those miles is all you have to focus on – our teams take care of the rest. Throughout the year, we’ll have opportunities and events to help you train, fundraise, and make it to the starting line with water in your bottles, air in your tires, and everything else you need to be ready for the Ride. The event raises awareness about the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic and funds services such as HIV testing, prevention, care, and much more.\n\nThe Ride began in 1994 and was called the “California AIDS Ride.” In 2002, it was rebranded as AIDS/LifeCycle. Since 1994, participants have raised more than $300 million for the HIV and AIDS-related services of the Los Angeles LGBT Center and San Francisco AIDS Foundation.\n\nDespite remarkable progress that has been made since the disease was first discovered in 1981, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is far from over. In the seven days it takes AIDS/LifeCycle to reach Los Angeles, more than 650 people in the United States will become infected with HIV."
