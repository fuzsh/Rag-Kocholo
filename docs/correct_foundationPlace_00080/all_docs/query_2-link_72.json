        "text": "Why Honest Conversations about Your Company’s Capabilities Are the Key to a Winning Strategy\n\nIs Silence Killing Your Strategy? In his thirty years of working in corporations, Harvard Business School professor Michael Beer has witnessed firsthand how organizational silence derails strategic objectives. When employees can't speak truth to power, senior leaders don't hear what they need to hear about their company's fitness to compete, and employees lose trust in those leaders and become less committed to change. In Fit to Compete, Beer presents an antidote to silence--principles and a time-tested innovative process for holding honest conversations with everyone in your organization. Used by over eight hundred organizations across the globe, the strategic fitness process has helped leaders in a diverse range of industries--including medical technology, information technology, banking, restaurant chains, and pharmaceuticals--hear the raw but necessary truth about the sources of misalignment between their strategies and their organizations. In addition to step-by-step instructions, Beer offers detailed and illustrative case studies of companies that have conducted honest conversations to great effect. He also shows how to apply the process more broadly to a variety of strategic challenges and at multiple levels throughout the organization. Practical, enlightening, and comprehensive, Fit to Compete is the book you should turn to if you want create winning strategies that your entire company will rally behind.\n\nHow Great Leaders Create Economic and Social Value.\n\nMeeting the new standard for leadership. Higher Ambition is required reading for every leader who refuses to compromise between people and performance. Choosing one or the other may have worked in the past, but it won't work now. As global competition stiffens and businesses face increased public scrutiny and renewed government regulation, leaders must win on all fronts-with their people, their customers, their communities, and their shareholders. In short, they must deliver superior economic and social value. Brimming with powerful stories and thoughtful advice from CEOs themselves, Higher Ambition equips leaders with the practical insights they need to meet this new and higher standard.\n\nby Michael Beer, August 2009\n\nHow to create the high-performance, high-commitment organization.\n\nIntegrating knowledge from strategic management, performance management, and organization design, strategic human resource expert and Harvard Business School Professor Michael Beer outlines what the high-commitment, high-performance organization looks like and provides practitioners with the transformation process to help them get there. Starting with leaders who have the right values, Beer shows how to weave together a complete system that includes top-to-bottom communication, organization design, HR policies, and leadership transformation process, and outlines what practitioners must do in HR, structure, systems, goals, culture, and strategy to create high-performance organizations.\n\nIn a hyper-competitive business environment in which investors expect profits and a return on their investment, senior executives are faced with a dilemma, how to meet investor expectations without destroying intangible assets such employee commitment and team-work. In short, how to avoid destroying the culture that underlies the company’s long-run success. In this book Beer and Nohria introduce a framework for how senior leaders can integrate these dual requirements. E strategies for managing profit expectations must be integrated with O strategies for developing an effective organization to which people are committed. They provide ways of thinking about the objectives of corporate transformation, the processes for transformation, the use of consultants among other considerations they discuss. A series of chapter leading scholars and practitioners elaborate on this framework.\n\nThe Critical Path to Corporate Renewal is a practical and effective agenda for revitalizing the corporation. Through an in depth analysis of six companies that have undergone fundamental changes, the authors describe what works and what doesn't in corporate renewal. It describes the many common errors companies make in getting started. The human sources of competitive advantage - coordination, commitment, and competence - cannot be enhanced through programs. Successful corporate renewal occurs only when plants, divisions, and departments involve employees. That must be done through a carefully designed series of steps - the critical path - led by unit general managers. Companies that have followed this strategy have flatter and less hierarchical organizations, employees who take initiative to reduce costs and improve quality, and enhanced teamwork at all levels.\n\nThe time has come for American managers to rethink the traditional relationship between management and workers. The personnel practices of the past are an obstacle today, blocking the higher productivity and quality levels your firm will need to succeed in the competitive environment of the 1980s and beyond.\n\nWhile U.S. corporations have become increasingly sophisticated at managing their financial and capital resources, one critical resource has been seriously underutilized in the American firm. This book introduces a new way of thinking about, and managing, your firm's greatest untapped potential: the human resources that can make or break any firm's best-laid plans.\n\nManaging Human Assets is not a book about \"personnel management\"; traditional personnel practice has involved a disjointed set of functions and techniques that have not optimized motivation, commitment, competence, and receptivity to change, the social capital of the firm.\n\nInstead, here is a pioneering guide for all general managers, operations managers, and personnel executives that treats the management of human resources as a key part of the firm's long-term competitive strategy. It demonstrates how this new way of thinking is being implemented at several major corporations, with relatively low financial investment and high productivity pay-off. With Managing Human Assets, you can realize the vast potential for productivity that lies in one of the American firm's last underutilized resources -- the motivated American worker.\n\nby Michael Beer and Russell Eisenstat\n\nReceived the 2007 Michael C.
