Premises. Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the space outlined on the attached Exhibit A (the \"Premises\"). The Premises are located on the floor(s) specified in Paragraph 2 below of the building (the \"Building\") presently known as Hills Plaza Phase I, located at 345 Spear Street, San Francisco, California. The Building is part of a combined office, retail and residential condominium project (the \"Project\") located on the entire block of Spear Street between Harrison Street and Folsom Street, in San Francisco, California. The Building, the parcel(s) of land (the \"Land\") on which the Building is located and any other improvements on the Land, the common areas of the Project and the underground garage for the Project are referred to herein as the \"Real Property.\" Tenant's lease of the Premises shall include the right to use, in common with others and subject to the other provisions of this Lease, the public lobbies, entrances, stairs, elevators and other public portions of the Building. All of the windows and outside walls of the Premises and any space in the Premises used for shafts, stacks, pipes, conduits, ducts, electrical equipment or other utilities or Building facilities are reserved solely to Landlord and Landlord shall have rights of access through the Premises for the purpose of operating, maintaining and repairing the same. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, during the term of this Lease Tenant shall have the non-exclusive license, in common with use by Landlord and other tenants of the Building, to use the vertical shafts and horizontal raceways and ducts within the Premises for purposes of installation therein of telephone, data and electrical wires and cables which are part of the Initial Alterations (as defined in Paragraph 4.a.) or Alterations (as defined in Paragraph 9) approved by Landlord pursuant to this Lease, provided that such license is more particularly set forth in an amendment to this Lease executed by Landlord and Tenant. 2. Certain Basic Lease Terms. As used herein, the following terms shall have the meaning specified below: a. Floors on which the Premises are located: Sixth (6th) floor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon Tenant's notice to Landlord given no later than five (5) days prior to the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date (as defined in Paragraph 2.c. below), Tenant may redesignate the portions of the Premises which comprise Parcel A and Parcel B, respectively, provided that such redesignated Parcel A shall in any event contain 45,467 rentable square feet, and such redesignated Parcel B shall in any event contain 18,000 rentable square feet. In the event of such redesignation, the parties shall promptly enter into an amendment to this Lease showing the so redesignated Parcels. b. Lease term: The term of this Lease shall commence on the date (the \"Commencement Date\") Landlord delivers the Premises to Tenant in the condition required by the first sentence of Paragraph 4.a below. The term of this Lease shall end on the date (the \"Expiration Date\") which is the last day of the one hundred twentieth (120th) full calendar month following the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date.

Lease Year 1 shall commence on the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date and end on the last day of the twelfth (12th) full calendar month thereafter, and each subsequent Lease Year shall be the twelve (12) full calendar month period commencing on the day after the expiration of the prior Lease Year. The \"Parcel A Rent Commencement Date\" shall be the date that is the earlier of (i) the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days following the First Rights Contingency Satisfaction Date, or (ii) the date Tenant commences occupancy of Parcel A or any portion thereof for the conduct of business.

Term; Delivery of Possession of Premises. a. The term of this Lease shall commence as provided in Paragraph 2.b., and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof or at law, shall expire on the Expiration Date (defined in Paragraph 2.b.). Upon either party's request after the Commencement Date has occurred hereunder, the parties shall execute a written confirmation of the Commencement Date and the Expiration Date. b. Landlord shall act diligently and in good faith to deliver the Premises to Tenant on the Scheduled Commencement Date; provided, however that Landlord shall have no obligation to deliver the Premises to Tenant prior to Landlord's receipt of the Letter of Credit required of Tenant pursuant to Paragraph 6 below. If Landlord, for any reason whatsoever, cannot deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Scheduled Commencement Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, nor shall the same amend Tenant's obligations under this Lease; provided, however, that in the event that Landlord does not deliver the Premises to Tenant on or prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after the Scheduled Commencement Date, as such date shall be extended for delays caused by Force Majeure or Tenant's failure to deliver the Letter of Credit (such date, as so extended, the \"Trigger Date\"), then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord given, if at all, within ten (10) days after the Trigger Date. For purposes of this Lease, \"Force Majeure\" shall mean strikes, lock-outs, labor disputes, shortages of material or labor, fire, earthquake, flood or other casualty, acts of God, or any other cause (other than financial inability) beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, except that for purposes of this Paragraph 3.b. a holdover of the Premises by any tenant or other occupant shall not be considered Force Majeure. 4. Premises As-Is. a. Premises As-Is. Landlord shall deliver the Premises to Tenant, and Tenant shall accept the Premises from Landlord, broom clean, but otherwise in their \"as is\" state and condition as of the delivery date. Except as provided below in this Paragraph 4, Landlord shall have no obligation to make or pay for any improvements or renovations in or to the Premises or the Building or to otherwise prepare the Premises or the Building for Tenant's occupancy. The parties acknowledge that Tenant intends to make certain alterations and improvements (the \"Initial Alterations\") to the Premises after the delivery thereof to prepare the same for Tenant's initial occupancy. The construction of the Initial Alterations shall be governed by Paragraph 9 hereof. The general contractor selected by Tenant in accordance with Paragraph 9 hereof to construct the Initial Alterations is referred to hereinafter as \"Contractor.\" Landlord agrees that Tenant shall have the right to utilize any furniture, equipment or improvements existing in the Premises as of the 2 <PAGE> Commencement Date, and if Tenant shall remove the same from the Premises in connection with the construction of the Initial Alterations or subsequently approved Alterations, any salvage value or proceeds attributable thereto shall belong solely to Tenant. b. Landlord's Allowance. Landlord shall contribute toward the cost of the design, construction and installation of the Initial Alterations (including, without limitation, Contractor's fee and, if Tenant does not select Turner-Shorenstein, L.P. (\"TSLP\") as Contractor, the Alteration Operations Fee provided for in Paragraph 9) an amount not to exceed Two Million Six Hundred Sixty-Five Thousand Six Hundred Fourteen Dollars ($2,665,614.00) (which equals $42.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises) (\"Landlord's Allowance\"); provided, however that not more than Two Hundred Fifty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty-Eight Dollars ($253,868.00) (which equals $4.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises) of Landlord's Allowance may be applied to Tenant's reasonable space planning, architectural and engineering costs for the design of the Initial Alterations. No portion of Landlord's Allowance may be applied to the cost of personal property, equipment, trade fixtures, moving expenses, furniture (including work stations and modular office furniture, regardless of the method of attachment to walls and/or floors), signage or, except as provided below, free rent. In the event that after completion of the Initial Alterations and payment of the total cost thereof (including the Alteration Operations Fee due pursuant to Paragraph 9.a. below in connection therewith), the entire amount of Landlord's Allowance has not been utilized, the remaining portion of Landlord's Allowance, but not to exceed Six Hundred Thirty-Four Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Dollars ($634,670.00) (which equals $10.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises), may be applied against the Monthly Rent first due from Tenant pursuant to this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord's Allowance is to be applied to the Initial Alterations (and the associated costs described above) covering the entire Premises (i.e. all of Parcel A and Parcel B). If Tenant does not improve the entire Premises, then, without limitation of any other rights or remedies of Landlord hereunder, Landlord's Contribution shall be adjusted on a prorata per rentable square foot basis to reflect the number of rentable square feet actually being improved. For purposes of the preceding sentence, space shall be conclusively deemed \"improved\" if it has finished ceilings, floors and walls, with Building systems furnished thereto (e.g. lighting, HVAC, sprinklers and other fire and life safety equipment), that reflects a continuity of design concept to the balance of the Premises, and is in a condition which would allow for legal occupancy of the space for general office purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph 4.b., Landlord's Allowance shall be available for disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof only for the first twelve (12) months after the Commencement Date. Accordingly, if any portion of Landlord's Allowance is not utilized prior to the date that is twelve (12) months from the Commencement Date, such unused portion shall be forfeited by Tenant. Landlord shall disburse Landlord's Allowance directly to Contractor, or subcontractors, or Tenant's design consultants as provided in clause (i) above, or to Tenant, as Landlord shall determine, in monthly installments. Each disbursement shall be conditioned upon Landlord's receipt of invoices to be furnished by Tenant covering work actually performed, construction in place and materials delivered to the site (as may be applicable). To the extent permitted by law, Landlord may withhold the amount of any and all retention percentages provided for in original contracts or subcontracts until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the applicable lien period or (ii) Landlord's receipt of a waiver of lien rights from the general contractor, subcontractors or suppliers whose invoices are applicable to the respective disbursement for, and/or on account of, the work or materials covered by such invoice. In the event the cost of the Initial Alterations exceeds Landlord's Allowance set forth above, Tenant shall pay all such excess costs (the \"Excess Cost\"), after the full amount of Landlord's Allowance has been disbursed hereunder (other than the retentions described above), directly to Contractor or the subcontractors or suppliers involved and shall furnish to Landlord copies of receipted invoices therefor and such waivers of lien rights as Landlord may reasonably require. If the Alteration Operations Fee is applicable, then, at the time Landlord makes any disbursement of Landlord's Allowance, Landlord shall retain from Landlord's Allowance, as a partial payment of the Alteration Operations Fee, a proportionate amount of the Alteration Operations Fee based upon Landlord's reasonable estimation of the amount required to be withheld from each disbursement in order to ensure that the entire Alteration Operations Fee is retained over the course of construction on a prorata basis. At such time as Landlord's Allowance has been entirely disbursed, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days of written demand, pay to Landlord the remainder, if any, of the Alteration Operations Fee not yet paid to Landlord. In addition to Landlord's Allowance, Landlord shall pay for the entire cost of the Landlord's Work described in Paragraph 4.c. below. c. Landlord's Work. Regardless of whether Tenant selects TSLP or another general contractor as Contractor, Landlord shall cause TSLP to perform the following work (\"Landlord's Work\") at Landlord's cost: i. Perform all work necessary within the finished walls of the existing core area restrooms on the sixth (6th) floor of the Building to cause such restrooms to comply with The Americans With Disabilities Act, to the extent such work is required to cause such restrooms to comply, as of Landlord's Work 3 <PAGE> Completion Date (as defined below), with the provisions of the ADA that are applicable to such restrooms as of such date. ii. Demolish existing stairs connecting the fifth (5th) and sixth (6th) floors of the Building (including rails and perimeter railing). Furnish and install new steel beams and/or reinforce existing beams around stair opening. Furnish and install new metal decking at opening. Pour lightweight concrete on top of metal decking to finished floor. Fireproof deck and beams as required. iii. Perform all work necessary (if any) to cause the common areas of the Building that are reasonably anticipated to be in Tenant's path of travel to the Premises to comply with the ADA, to the extent such work is required to cause such common areas to comply, as of Landlord's Work Completion Date, with the provisions of the ADA that are applicable to such common areas as of such date. In no event shall Landlord's Work include any work required by reason of or triggered by (x) the Initial Alterations or any other Alterations of Tenant (except as required pursuant to Paragraph 8.b. below), (y) Tenant's particular use of the Premises (as opposed to Tenant's use of the Premises for their permitted purposes in a normal and customary manner), or (z) Tenant's particular employees or employment practices or the canine access rights granted to Tenant pursuant to Paragraph 55 below. Landlord's Work may be performed during the period of construction of the Initial Alterations, and shall in any event be substantially completed on or prior to the date (\"Landlord's Work Completion Date\") that is the later of February 15, 2002 or the Rent Commencement Date, subject to extension for delays caused by Force Majeure or by Tenant (including Tenant's construction of the Initial Alterations). If Tenant does not select TSLP as Contractor, Landlord and Tenant shall cause their respective contractors to cooperate with each other in the coordination of the construction of Landlord's Work and the Initial Alterations. Landlord's Work shall be \"substantially completed\" for purposes of the foregoing so long as any remaining portions of Landlord's Work are so-called \"punch list\" items which do not preclude issuance of a certificate of occupancy (or other permit for legal occupancy) for the Premises which would have otherwise been issued. Landlord shall promptly complete such punch list items. 5. Monthly Rent. a. Beginning on the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date, and thereafter on or before the first day of each calendar month during the term hereof, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as monthly rent for Parcel A, the Monthly Rent specified in Paragraph 2 above. Beginning on the Parcel B Rent Commencement Date, and thereafter on or before the first day of each calendar month during the term hereof, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as monthly rent for Parcel B, the Monthly Rent specified in Paragraph 2 above. If the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date or the Parcel B Rent Commencement Date is a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the term of this Lease terminates on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the Monthly Rent payable for such partial month shall be appropriately prorated on the basis of a thirty (30)-day month. Monthly Rent and the Additional Rent specified in Paragraph 7 shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, in advance, without deduction, offset, prior notice or demand (except as expressly set forth in this Lease), in immediately available funds of lawful money of the United States of America, or by good check as described below, at the office of Shorenstein Company, L.P., at 555 California Street, 49th floor, San Francisco, California 94104, or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing. Payments made by check must be drawn either on a California financial institution or on a financial institution that is a member of the federal reserve system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall pay to Landlord within one (1) Business Day after the First Rights Contingency Satisfaction Date, the Monthly Rent due for Parcel A for the first full calendar month after the Parcel A Rent Commencement Date, and such payment shall be applied against the Monthly Rent first due under this Lease. b. All amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease, or otherwise payable in connection with Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, in addition to the Monthly Rent hereunder and Additional Rent under Paragraph 7, shall constitute rent owed by Tenant to Landlord hereunder. c. Any rent not paid by Tenant to Landlord within five (5) days after the date due shall bear interest from the date due to the date of payment by Tenant at an annual rate of interest (the \"Interest Rate\") equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum annual interest rate allowed by law on such due date for business loans (not primarily for personal, family or household purposes) not exempt from the usury law, or (ii) a rate equal to the sum of four (4) percentage points over the six-month United States Treasury bill rate (the \"Treasury Rate\") in effect from time to time during such delinquency (or if there is no such publicly announced rate, the rate quoted by the San Francisco Main Office of Bank of America, N.A., or any successor bank thereto, in pricing ninety (90)-day commercial loans to substantial commercial borrowers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of non-payment of rent when due and five (5) days after delivery of such notice to cure such non-payment once in each calendar year before assessing interest in such calendar year pursuant to this Paragraph 5.c. Failure by Tenant to pay rent when due, including any interest accrued under this subparagraph, after the expiration of any applicable notice and cure 4 <PAGE> period provided in Paragraph 25.a. below, shall constitute an Event of Default (as defined in Paragraph 25 below) giving rise to all the remedies afforded Landlord under this Lease and at law for nonpayment of rent. d. No security or guaranty which may now or hereafter be furnished to Landlord for the payment of rent due hereunder or for the performance by Tenant of the other terms of this Lease shall in any way be a bar or defense to any of Landlord's remedies under this Lease or at law. 6. Letter of Credit. a. As security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant's obligations hereunder, Tenant shall cause to be delivered to Landlord within one (1) Business Day after the First Rights Contingency Satisfaction Date, an original irrevocable standby letter of credit (the \"Letter of Credit\") in the amount of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000.00), naming Landlord as beneficiary, which Landlord may draw upon to cure any Event of Default under this Lease (or any default under this Lease where there exist circumstances under which Landlord is enjoined or otherwise prevented by operation of law from giving to Tenant a written notice which would be necessary for such failure of performance to constitute an Event of Default under this Lease), or to compensate Landlord for any damage Landlord incurs as a result of Tenant's failure to perform any of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that neither the Letter of Credit nor any proceeds therefrom shall be deemed an advance rent deposit or an advance payment of any other kind, or a measure or limitation of Landlord's damages or constitute a bar or defense to any of the Landlord's other remedies under this Lease or at law upon Tenant's default. The Letter of Credit shall be issued by a major national commercial bank reasonably acceptable to Landlord, with a service and claim point for the Letter of Credit in San Francisco, California, have an expiration date not earlier than sixty (60) days after the Expiration Date (or, in the alternative, have a term of not less than one (1) year and be automatically renewable for an additional one (1) year period unless notice of non-renewal is given by the issuer to Landlord not later than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration thereof) and shall provide that Landlord may make partial and multiple draws thereunder, up to the face amount thereof. The Letter of Credit shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (as modified to the extent required to comply with any changes after the date hereof to laws applicable thereto), and shall otherwise be in form and content satisfactory to Landlord. If the Letter of Credit has an expiration date earlier than sixtieth (60th) day after the Expiration Date, then throughout the term hereof (including any renewal or extension of the term) Tenant shall provide evidence of renewal of the Letter of Credit to Landlord at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date the Letter of Credit expires. If Landlord draws on the Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms hereof, Tenant shall immediately replenish the Letter of Credit or provide Landlord with an additional letter of credit conforming to the requirement of this paragraph so that the amount available to Landlord from the Letter(s) of Credit provided hereunder is the amount specified above. Tenant's failure to deliver any replacement, additional or extension of the Letter of Credit, or evidence of renewal of the Letter of Credit, within the time specified under this Lease shall entitle Landlord to draw upon the Letter of Credit then in effect. If Landlord liquidates the Letter of Credit as provided in the preceding sentence, Landlord shall hold the funds received from the Letter of Credit as security for Tenant's performance under this Lease, and Landlord shall be deemed to hold a perfected, first priority security interest in such funds (and Tenant does hereby appoint Landlord its attorney-in-fact for purposes of filing such financing statements or other instruments as Landlord shall deem advisable to further evidence and/or perfect such security interest). Landlord shall not be required to segregate such security deposit from its other funds and no interest shall accrue or be payable to Tenant with respect thereto. No holder of a Superior Interest (as defined in Paragraph 21 below), nor any purchaser at any judicial or private foreclosure sale of the Real Property or any portion thereof, shall be responsible to Tenant for such security deposit unless and only to the extent such holder or purchaser shall have actually received the same. If Landlord transfers such security deposit to the grantee or transferee of Landlord's interest in the Real Property, Landlord shall be released from any further responsibility or liability for such security. If Tenant is not in default at the expiration or termination of this Lease, Landlord shall return to Tenant the Letter of Credit or the balance of the security deposit then held by Landlord, as applicable, within sixty (60) days thereafter; provided, however, that in no event shall any such return be construed as an admission by Landlord that Tenant has performed all of its covenants and obligations hereunder. b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on the commencement of Lease Year 6, and on the commencement of each Lease Year thereafter (each such anniversary, a \"Reduction Date\"), so long as no Event of Default (as defined in Paragraph 25 below) by Tenant under this Lease has occurred and is continuing as of such Reduction Date, and so long as no breach or default by Tenant under this Lease which, with notice or the passage of time or both could ripen into an Event of Default (an \"Unmatured Default\"), shall be continuing as of the Reduction Date, the amount required under the Letter of Credit shall be reduced by Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00). Accordingly, if all Reductions are made as so scheduled, during Lease Year 10 the Letter of Credit will be reduced to zero and will not be required. If Tenant is entitled to such reduction, Tenant may replace or amend the then existing Letter of Credit to reflect such reduced amount on or after the applicable Reduction Date. If Landlord disallows any such reduction by reason of an Unmatured Default, and if Tenant cures the Unmatured Default prior to the same becoming an Event of Default, the date that is five (5) days after the date such Unmatured Default is cured shall become the new Reduction Date for purposes of making the reduction which was previously disallowed. 7. Additional Rent: Increases in Operating Expenses and Tax Expenses. 5 <PAGE> a. Operating Expenses. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, at the times hereinafter set forth, Tenant's Share, as specified in Paragraph 2.e. above, of any increase in the Operating Expenses (as defined below) incurred by Landlord in each calendar year subsequent to the Base Year specified in Paragraph 2.f. above, over the Operating Expenses incurred by Landlord during the Base Year. The amounts payable under this Paragraph 7.a. and Paragraph 7.b. below are termed \"Additional Rent\" herein. The term \"Operating Expenses\" shall mean the total costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with the management, operation, maintenance, repair and ownership of the Real Property, including, without limitation, the following costs: (1) salaries, wages, bonuses and other compensation (including hospitalization, medical, surgical, retirement plan, pension plan, union dues, life insurance, including group life insurance, welfare and other fringe benefits, and vacation, holidays and other paid absence benefits) relating to employees of Landlord or its agents engaged in the operation, repair, or maintenance of the Real Property; (2) payroll, social security, workers' compensation, unemployment and similar taxes with respect to such employees of Landlord or its agents, and the cost of providing disability or other benefits imposed by law or otherwise, with respect to such employees; (3) the cost of uniforms (including the cleaning, replacement and pressing thereof) provided to such employees; (4) premiums and other charges incurred by Landlord with respect to fire, other casualty, rent and liability insurance, any other insurance as is deemed necessary or advisable in the reasonable judgment of Landlord, or any insurance required by the holder of any Superior Interest (as defined in Paragraph 21 below), and, after the Base Year, costs of repairing an insured casualty to the extent of the deductible amount under the applicable insurance policy; provided that, if Landlord does not carry earthquake insurance during the Base Year, but obtains earthquake insurance subsequent to the Base Year, then the initial annual premium for the earthquake insurance shall not be included in Operating Expenses, and Operating Expenses in any given year subsequent to the first calendar year in which Landlord obtains earthquake insurance shall include only the increases in the annual premium over the annual premium paid for the earthquake insurance for the first calendar year after the Base Year in which Landlord carries the same; (5) water charges and sewer rents or fees; (6) license, permit and inspection fees; (7) sales, use and excise taxes on goods and services purchased by Landlord in connection with the operation, maintenance or repair of the Real Property and Building systems and equipment; (8) telephone, telegraph, postage, stationery supplies and other expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance, or repair of the Real Property; (9) management fees and expenses; (10) costs of repairs to and maintenance of the Real Property, including building systems and appurtenances thereto and normal repair and replacement of worn-out equipment, facilities and installations, but excluding the replacement of major building systems (except to the extent provided in (16) and (17) below); (11) fees and expenses for janitorial, window cleaning, guard, extermination, water treatment, rubbish removal, plumbing and other services and inspection or service contracts for elevator, electrical, mechanical and other building equipment and systems or as may otherwise be necessary or proper for the operation, repair or maintenance of the Real Property; (12) costs of supplies, tools, materials, and equipment used in connection with the operation, maintenance or repair of the Real Property; (13) accounting, legal and other professional fees and expenses; (14) fees and expenses for painting the exterior or the public or common areas of the Building and the cost of maintaining the sidewalks, landscaping and other common areas of the Real Property; (15) costs and expenses for electricity, chilled water, air conditioning, water for heating, gas, fuel, steam, heat, lights, power and other energy related utilities required in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair of the Real Property; (16) the cost of any capital improvements made by Landlord to the Real Property or capital assets acquired by Landlord after the Base Year in order to comply with any local, state or federal law, ordinance, rule, regulation, code or order of any governmental entity or insurance requirement (collectively, \"Legal Requirement\") with which the Real Property was not required to comply during the Base Year, or to comply with any amendment or other change to the enactment or interpretation of any Legal Requirement from its enactment or interpretation during the Base Year; (17) the cost of any capital improvements made by Landlord to the Building or capital assets acquired by Landlord after the Base Year for the protection of the health and safety of the occupants of the Real Property or that are designed to reduce other Operating Expenses; (18) the cost of furniture, draperies, carpeting, landscaping and other customary and ordinary items of personal property (excluding paintings, sculptures and other works of art) provided by Landlord for use in common areas of the Building or in the Building office (to the extent that such Building office is dedicated to the operation and management of the Real Property); (19) any expenses and costs resulting from substitution of work, labor, material or services in lieu of any of the above itemizations, or for any additional work, labor, services or material resulting from compliance with any Legal Requirement applicable to the Real Property or any parts thereof (excluding costs of capital improvements made in order to comply with Legal Requirements with which the Real Property was required to comply during the Base Year); (20) Building office rent or rental value, to the extent that such Building office is dedicated to the operation and management of the Real Property; and (21) the Building's prorata share of the Project costs under the Master Declaration (as described in Paragraph 21 below). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as to the common areas of the Project and the garage of the Project, Operating Expenses shall include only the Building's prorata share (as reasonably determined by Landlord in its good faith business judgment) of the above described costs and expenses for such common areas and garage of the Project. Further, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that certain of the building systems serving the Building also serve the other office building in the Project and that certain of the improvements, alterations or repairs made by Landlord to the Building or the Land that are properly included in Operating Expenses pursuant to the above may be a part of improvements, alterations or repairs that also benefit the other office building in the Project. In light of the foregoing, Landlord shall determine, in its reasonable and good faith business judgment, the proper allocation 6 <PAGE> of any such item of Operating Expenses between the Building and any other building that benefits from the Operating Expense so that Tenant shall be responsible only for Operating Expenses to the extent they are attributable or allocable to the Building and the Land. Landlord and Tenant also acknowledge that certain of the items of Operating Expenses referenced above are applicable only to the office space within the Building and certain of such items are applicable to both the office space and the retail space in the Building. Landlord shall properly allocate the cost of such items to the office space and to the retail space in accordance with standard accounting principles. With respect to the costs of items included in Operating Expenses under (16) and (17), such costs shall be amortized over a reasonable period, as determined by Landlord, together with interest on the unamortized balance at a rate per annum equal to three (3) percentage points over the Treasury Rate charged at the time such item is constructed or acquired, or at such higher rate as may have been paid by Landlord on funds borrowed for the purpose of constructing or acquiring such item, but in either case not more than the maximum rate permitted by law at the time such item is constructed or acquired. Operating Expenses shall not include the following: (i) depreciation on the Building or equipment or systems therein; (ii) debt service; (iii) rental under any ground or underlying lease; (iv) interest (except as expressly provided in this Paragraph 7.a.); (v) Tax Expenses (as defined in Paragraph 7.b. below); (vi) attorneys' and other professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with lease negotiations with prospective or existing Building tenants or the enforcement of leases affecting the Real Property; (vii) the cost (including any amortization thereof) of any improvements or alterations which would be properly classified as capital expenditures according to generally accepted property management practices (except to the extent expressly included in Operating Expenses pursuant to this Paragraph 7.a.); (viii) the cost of decorating, improving for tenant occupancy, painting or redecorating portions of the Building to be demised to tenants; (ix) wages, salaries, benefits or other similar compensation paid to executive employees of Landlord or Landlord's agents above the rank of Building manager; (x) advertising and promotional expenditures, and costs of signage identifying any tenant of the Building (other than Building directory or floor directory signage); (xi) real estate broker's or other leasing commissions; (xii) penalties or other costs incurred due to a violation by Landlord, as determined by written admission, stipulation, final judgment or arbitration award, of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease or any other lease relating to the Building except to the extent such costs reflect costs that would have been incurred by Landlord absent such violation; (xiii) subject to the provisions of item (4) above, repairs and other work occasioned by fire, windstorm or other casualty, to the extent Landlord is reimbursed by insurance proceeds, and other work paid from insurance or condemnation proceeds; (xiv) costs, penalties or fines arising from Landlord's violation of any applicable governmental rule or authority except to the extent such costs reflect costs that would have been incurred by Landlord absent such violation; (xv) overhead and profit increments (including as part of management fees) paid to subsidiaries or affiliates of Landlord for management or other services on or to the Building or for supplies or other materials to the extent that the cost of the services, supplies or materials materially exceed the amounts normally payable for similar goods and services under similar circumstances (taking into account the market factors in effect on the date any relevant contracts were negotiated) in comparable buildings in the San Francisco financial district; (xvi) charitable and political contributions; (xviii) rentals and other related expenses incurred in leasing air conditioning systems, elevators or other equipment ordinarily considered to be of a capital nature (except equipment that is not affixed to the Building and is used in providing janitorial services, and except to the extent such costs would otherwise be includable pursuant to items (16) and (17) as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph); (xix) costs directly and solely attributable to the garage in the Building, including, without limitation, payroll for clerks, attendants, book-keeping, parking, insurance premiums, parking management fees, parking tickets, janitorial services, striping and painting of surfaces (provided, however, that the cost of providing utilities to the garage shall be included in Operating Expenses); (xx) any expense for which Landlord is actually directly reimbursed by a tenant or other party (other than through a provision similar to the first paragraph of this Paragraph 7.a.), including, without limitation, payments for Excess Services; (xxii) the cost of services made available at no additional charge to any tenant in the Building but not to Tenant; or (xxiii) the cost of any Hazardous Materials (as defined in Paragraph 8.c. below) abatement or removal activities where such activities are not necessitated by the Handling (as defined in Paragraph 8.c. below) of Hazardous Materials by Tenant or any other Tenant Party, provided, however, Operating Expenses may include the costs attributable to those actions taken by Landlord in connection with the ordinary operation and maintenance of the Building, including costs incurred in removing limited amounts of Hazardous Materials from the Building when such removal is directly related to such ordinary maintenance and operation. b. Tax Expenses. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent under this Lease, at the times hereinafter set forth, Tenant's Share, as specified in Paragraph 2.e. above, of any increase in Tax Expenses (as defined below) incurred by Landlord in each calendar year, over Tax Expenses incurred by Landlord during the Base Tax Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any reassessment, reduction or recalculation of any item included in Tax Expenses during the term results in a reduction of Tax Expenses, then for purposes of calculating Tenant's Share of increases in Tax Expenses from and after the calendar year in which such adjustment occurs, Tax Expenses for the Base Tax Year shall be adjusted to reflect such reduction. The term \"Tax Expenses\" shall mean all taxes, assessments (whether general or special), excises, transit charges, housing fund assessments or other housing charges, improvement districts, levies or fees, ordinary or extraordinary, unforeseen as well as foreseen, of any kind, which are assessed, levied, charged, 7 <PAGE> confirmed or imposed on the Real Property, on Landlord with respect to the Real Property, on the act of entering into leases of space in the Real Property, on the use or occupancy of the Real Property or any part thereof, with respect to services or utilities consumed in the use, occupancy or operation of the Real Property, on any improvements, fixtures and equipment and other personal property of Landlord located in the Real Property and used in connection with the operation of the Real Property, or on or measured by the rent payable under this Lease or in connection with the business of renting space in the Real Property, including, without limitation, any gross income tax or excise tax levied with respect to the receipt of such rent, by the United States of America, the State of California, the City and County of San Francisco, any political subdivision, public corporation, district or other political or public entity or public authority, and shall also include any other tax, fee or other excise, however described, which may be levied or assessed in lieu of, as a substitute (in whole or in part) for, or as an addition to, any other Tax Expense. Tax Expenses shall include reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements incurred in connection with proceedings to contest, determine or reduce Tax Expenses. If it shall not be lawful for Tenant to reimburse Landlord for any increase in Tax Expenses as defined herein, the Monthly Rent payable to Landlord prior to the imposition of such increases in Tax Expenses shall be increased to net Landlord the same net Monthly Rent after imposition of such increases in Tax Expenses as would have been received by Landlord prior to the imposition of such increases in Tax Expenses. Tax Expenses shall not include income, franchise, transfer, inheritance or capital stock taxes, unless, due to a change in the method of taxation, any of such taxes is levied or assessed against Landlord in lieu of, as a substitute (in whole or in part) for, or as an addition to, any other charge which would otherwise constitute a Tax Expense; nor shall Tax Expenses include interest, fines or other penalties imposed by reason of Landlord's failure to pay Tax Expenses prior to delinquency, unless such failure occurs during any calendar year in which Tenant has failed to timely pay any Monthly Rent, Additional Rent or other amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that certain other buildings exist or encroach upon the Land, that Tenant shall have no liability as to any item of Tax Expense attributable or allocable to, or assessed against, buildings other than the Building and that Landlord's good faith determination of the proper allocation of any item of Tax Expense allocable to buildings other than the Building shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. c. Adjustment for Occupancy Factor. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event the Building is not fully occupied during the Base Year or any calendar year during the term after the Base Year, an adjustment shall be made by Landlord in computing Operating Expenses for the Base Year and such calendar year so that those Operating Expenses which vary based on levels of occupancy shall be computed for such year as though the Building had been fully occupied during such year. In addition, if any particular work or service includable in Operating Expenses is not furnished to a tenant who has undertaken to perform such work or service itself, Operating Expenses shall be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the additional Operating Expenses which would have been incurred if Landlord had furnished such work or service to such tenant. The parties agree that statements in this Lease to the effect that Landlord is to perform certain of its obligations hereunder at its own or sole cost and expense shall not be interpreted as excluding any cost from Operating Expenses or Tax Expenses if such cost is an Operating Expense or Tax Expense pursuant to the terms of this Lease. d. Intention Regarding Expense Pass-Through. It is the intention of Landlord and Tenant that the Monthly Rent paid to Landlord throughout the term of this Lease shall be absolutely net of all increases, respectively, in Tax Expenses and Operating Expenses over, respectively, Tax Expenses for the Base Tax Year and Operating Expenses for the Base Year, and the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 7 are intended to so provide. e. Notice and Payment. On or before the first day of each calendar year during the term hereof subsequent to the Base Year, or as soon as practicable thereafter, Landlord shall give to Tenant notice of Landlord's estimate of the Additional Rent, if any, payable by Tenant pursuant to Paragraphs 7.a. and 7.b. for such calendar year subsequent to the Base Year. On or before the first day of each month during each such subsequent calendar year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12th) of the estimated Additional Rent; provided, however, that if Landlord's notice is not given prior to the first day of any calendar year Tenant shall continue to pay Additional Rent on the basis of the prior year's estimate until the month after Landlord's notice is given. If at any time it appears to Landlord that the Additional Rent payable under Paragraphs 7.a. and/or 7.b. will vary from Landlord's estimate by more than five percent (5%), Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant, revise its estimate for such year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such year shall be based upon the revised estimate. On the first monthly payment date after any new estimate is delivered to Tenant, Tenant shall also pay any accrued cost increases, based on such new estimate. f. Annual Accounting. Landlord shall maintain true, correct and complete records of the Operating Expenses and Tax Expenses in accordance with sound accounting practices. Within ninety (90) days after the close of each calendar year subsequent to the Base Year, or as soon after such ninety (90) day period as practicable, but in any event within one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of each such calendar year, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement of the Additional Rent payable under Paragraphs 7.a. and 7.b. for such year. The statement shall be based on the results of an audit of the operations of the Building prepared for the applicable year by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm selected 8 <PAGE> by Landlord. Upon Tenant's request made no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of Landlord's annual statement, Landlord shall promptly deliver to Tenant a copy of the auditor's statement on which Landlord's annual statement is based, and such other information regarding the annual statement as may be reasonably requested by Tenant to ascertain Landlord's compliance with this Paragraph 7. At Landlord's option, Landlord may deliver such auditor's statement to Tenant together with Landlord's annual statement, or otherwise deliver such auditor's statement to Tenant prior to Tenant's request therefor. Landlord's annual statement shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant (except for revisions to take into account any subsequent reassessment affecting the calculation of Tax Expenses included in such statement, which revisions shall be made if at all, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of the calendar year in which Landlord receives the revised tax bill) unless, within sixty (60) days after Tenant's receipt thereof or Tenant's receipt of any such revisions due to a reassessment or Tenant's receipt of any correction thereof by Landlord pursuant to the following provisions, as applicable), Tenant shall contest or Landlord shall correct any item therein by giving written notice to the other, specifying each item contested or corrected, respectively, and the reason therefor. If the annual statement shows that Tenant's payments of Additional Rent for such calendar year pursuant to Paragraph 7.e. hereof exceeded Tenant's obligations for the calendar year, Landlord shall at its option either (1) credit the excess to the next succeeding installments of rent or (2) pay the excess to Tenant within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement. If the annual statement shows that Tenant's payments of Additional Rent for such calendar year pursuant to Paragraph 7.e. hereof were less than Tenant's obligation for the calendar year, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement. g. Proration for Partial Lease Year. If this Lease terminates on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the Additional Rent payable by Tenant pursuant to this Paragraph 7 applicable to the calendar year in which this Lease terminates shall be prorated on the basis that the number of days from the commencement of such calendar year to and including such termination date bears to three hundred sixty-five (365). 8. Use of Premises; Compliance with Law. a. Use of Premises. The Premises shall be used solely for general office purposes for the business of Tenant as described in Paragraph 2.g. above (which includes a server room) or for any other general office use consistent with the operation of the Building as a first-class high-rise office building in the San Francisco financial district, and for no other use or purpose. Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that the Building is zoned and otherwise entitled so as to permit the Premises to be used for general office purposes, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not relieve Tenant from responsibility for obtaining a building permit and other applicable permits in connection with Tenant's construction of the Initial Alterations or any subsequent Alterations. Tenant shall not do or suffer or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises or the Real Property, nor bring or keep anything therein, which would in any way subject Landlord, Landlord's agents or the holder of any Superior Interest (as defined in Paragraph 21) to any liability, increase the premium rate of or affect any fire, casualty, liability, rent or other insurance relating to the Real Property or any of the contents of the Building, or cause a cancellation of, or give rise to any defense by the insurer to any claim under, or conflict with, any policies for such insurance. If any act or omission of Tenant results in any such increase in premium rates, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand the amount of such increase. Tenant shall not do or suffer or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises or the Real Property which will in any way unreasonably obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Building or injure or annoy them, or use or suffer or permit the Premises to be used for any immoral or unlawful purpose, nor shall Tenant cause, maintain, suffer or permit any nuisance in, on or about the Premises or the Real Property. Without limiting the foregoing, no loudspeakers or other similar device which can be heard outside the Premises shall, without the prior written approval of Landlord, be used in or about the Premises. Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed any waste in, to or about the Premises. Tenant agrees not to employ any person, entity or contractor for any work in the Premises (including moving Tenant's equipment and furnishings in, out or around the Premises) whose presence is likely to give rise to a labor or other disturbance in the Building and, if necessary to prevent such a disturbance in a particular situation, Landlord may require Tenant to employ union labor for the work. Landlord will advise Tenant, upon request, as to whether a given person, entity or contractor, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, is likely to cause a labor or other disturbance. b. Compliance with Law. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises which will in any way conflict with any Legal Requirement (as defined in Paragraph 7.a.(16) above) now in force or which may hereafter be enacted. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly comply with all such present and future Legal Requirements relating to the condition, use or occupancy of the Premises, and shall perform all work to the Premises or other portions of the Real Property required to effect such compliance (or, as to work to the Base Building (as defined below) or outside of the Premises, Landlord, at Landlord's election, may perform such work at Tenant's cost). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, (I) Tenant shall not be required to perform any changes to the Base Building unless such changes are related to or affected or triggered by (i) Tenant's Alterations (as defined in Paragraph 9 below), other than 9 <PAGE> the Initial Alterations (which are addressed in clause (II) below), (ii) Tenant's particular use of the Premises (as opposed to Tenant's use of the Premises for general office purposes in a normal and customary manner), or (iii) Tenant's particular employees or employment practices, and (II) Tenant shall not be required to perform any changes to portions of the Building systems located outside of the Premises, or to other components of the Base Building located outside of the Premises, by reason of the Initial Alterations unless such changes are related to or affected or triggered by (i) Tenant's failure to design and construct the Initial Alterations in compliance with applicable building codes and other Legal Requirements, or (ii) inclusion in the Initial Alterations of improvements which are not normal and customary general office improvements (such as, without limitation, library, file, computer or meeting rooms, classroom facilities or kitchens or cafeterias or other areas requiring floor reinforcement or enhanced systems requirements). Upon Tenant's request with its submission to Landlord of the plans and specifications for the Initial Alterations, Landlord will advise Tenant if any of the Initial Alterations are within the preceding clause (ii). The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in an action against Tenant, whether or not Landlord is a party thereto, that Tenant has violated any Legal Requirement shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant. Tenant shall immediately furnish Landlord with any notices received from any insurance company or governmental agency or inspection bureau regarding any unsafe or unlawful conditions within the Premises or the violation of any Legal Requirement. In no event shall Tenant's compliance obligations hereunder include any work required of Landlord as Landlord's Work pursuant to Paragraph 4.c. above. \"Base Building\" means the structural portions of the Building (including exterior walls, roof, foundation, floor slabs and core of the Building), all Building systems, including, without limitation, elevator, plumbing, heating, electrical, security, life safety and power, except (i) those special or supplemental systems (including air-conditioning systems), and equipment used in connection therewith , and non-Building standard lighting and electrical wiring installed specifically for Tenant or any other tenants and (ii) the portion of any Building system within the Premises or any other specific tenant space, the maintenance, repair or compliance of which is the responsibility of Tenant or such other tenant, respectively. c. Hazardous Materials. Tenant shall not cause or permit the storage, use, generation, release, handling or disposal (collectively, \"Handling\") of any Hazardous Materials (as defined below), in, on, or about the Premises or the Real Property by Tenant or any agents, employees, contractors, licensees, subtenants, customers, guests or invitees of Tenant (collectively with Tenant, \"Tenant Parties\"), except that Tenant shall be permitted to use normal quantities of office supplies or products (such as copier fluids or cleaning supplies) customarily used in the conduct of general business office activities (\"Common Office Chemicals\"), provided that the Handling of such Common Office Chemicals shall comply at all times with all Legal Requirements, including Hazardous Materials Laws (as defined below). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, however, in no event shall Tenant permit any usage of Common Office Chemicals in a manner that may cause the Premises or the Real Property to be contaminated by any Hazardous Materials or in violation of any Hazardous Materials Laws. After obtaining knowledge thereof, Tenant shall immediately advise Landlord in writing of (a) any and all enforcement, cleanup, remedial, removal, or other governmental or regulatory actions instituted, completed, or threatened pursuant to any Hazardous Materials Laws relating to any Hazardous Materials affecting the Premises; and (b) all claims made or threatened by any third party against Tenant, Landlord, the Premises or the Real Property relating to damage, contribution, cost recovery, compensation, loss, or injury resulting from any Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises. Without Landlord's prior written consent, Tenant shall not take any remedial action or enter into any agreements or settlements in response to the presence of any Hazardous Materials in, on, or about the Premises. Tenant shall be solely responsible for and shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord and all other Indemnitees (as defined in Paragraph 14.b. below), harmless from and against all Claims (as defined in Paragraph 14.b. below), arising out of or in connection with, or otherwise relating to (i) any Handling of Hazardous Materials by any Tenant Party or Tenant's breach of its obligations hereunder, or (ii) any removal, cleanup, or restoration work and materials necessary to return the Real Property or any other property of whatever nature located on the Real Property to their condition existing prior to the Handling of Hazardous Materials in, on or about the Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party. Tenant's obligations under this paragraph shall survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, \"Hazardous Materials\" means any explosive, radioactive materials, hazardous wastes, or hazardous substances, including without limitation asbestos containing materials, PCB's, CFC's, or substances defined as \"hazardous substances\" in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601-9657; the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975, 49 U.S.C. Section 1801-1812; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901- 6987; or any other Legal Requirement regulating, relating to, or imposing liability or standards of conduct concerning any such materials or substances now or at any time hereafter in effect (collectively, \"Hazardous Materials Laws\"). d. Applicability of Paragraph. The provisions of this Paragraph 8 are for the benefit of Landlord, the holder of any Superior Interest (as defined in Paragraph 21 below), and the other Indemnitees only and are not nor shall they be construed to be for the benefit of any tenant or occupant of the Building. 9. Alterations and Restoration. 10 <PAGE> a. Tenant shall not make or permit to be made any alterations, modifications, additions, decorations or improvements to the Premises, or any other work whatsoever that would directly or indirectly involve the penetration or removal (whether permanent or temporary) of, or require access through, in, under, or above any floor, wall or ceiling, or surface or covering thereof in the Premises (collectively, \"Alterations\"), except as expressly provided in this Paragraph 9. If Tenant desires any Alteration, except for Cosmetic Alterations as described in the next paragraph, Tenant must obtain Landlord's prior written approval of such Alteration, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided, however, that Landlord shall have at least ten (10) Business Days from Landlord's receipt of Final Plans (as defined below) for any Alterations in which to grant or reasonably withhold its approval of such Alterations. \"Final Plans\" means working plans and specifications (the \"Working Drawings\") for all of the work and improvements which Tenant desires to be included within the Alterations (including any related Alterations), and which show work and improvements that comply with all applicable Legal Requirements and the Building Construction Standards (as defined below), and shall be in sufficient detail as to enable the general contractor for the work to obtain all necessary governmental permits for construction of all of the Alterations (including any related Alterations) and to secure complete bids from qualified contractors to perform the work for all of the Alterations (including any related Alterations). In the case of the Initial Alterations, the aforesaid ten (10) Business Day period shall commence on the later of the date of this Lease or Landlord's receipt of the Final Plans for the Initial Alterations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may submit the Final Plans for the Initial Alterations in logical stages or trade groupings, in which case the aforesaid ten (10) Business Day period shall apply to the plans and specifications for each such stage or grouping after submission thereof; provided, however, that Landlord reserves the right to modify its approval, conditions or requirements with respect to the plans and specifications for any such prior stage or grouping to the extent made necessary by the requirements of the plans and specifications for any subsequently submitted stage or grouping. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Paragraph 9, Tenant shall have the right, without Landlord's consent, to make any Alteration to the Premises that meets all of the following criteria (a \"Cosmetic Alteration\"): (a) the Alteration is decorative in nature (such as paint, carpet or other wall or floor finishes, movable partitions or other such work), (b) Tenant provides Landlord with ten (10) days' advance written notice of the commencement of such Alteration, (c) such Alteration does not affect the Building's electrical, mechanical, life safety, plumbing, security, or HVAC systems or any other portion of the Base Building or any part of the Building other than the Premises, (d) the work will not decrease the value of the Premises, does not require a building permit or other governmental permit, uses only new materials comparable in quality to those being replaced and is performed in a workman-like manner and in accordance with all Legal Requirements, and (e) the cost of such Alteration, when aggregated with the cost of all other Cosmetic Alterations performed during the previous twelve (12) month period, does not exceed Sixty-Five Thousand Dollars ($65,000.00) in the aggregate as to all of the Premises. At the time Tenant notifies Landlord of any Cosmetic Alteration, Tenant shall give Landlord a copy of Tenant's plans for the work. If the Cosmetic Alteration is of such a nature that formal plans will not be prepared for the work, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a reasonably specific description of the work. All Alterations shall be made at Tenant's sole cost and expense, including the expense of complying with all present and future Legal Requirements, and the expense of any other work required to be performed in other areas within or outside the Premises by reason of the Alterations; provided, however, that as to the Initial Alterations Tenant's duty to perform compliance work outside of the Premises shall be subject to clause (II) of Paragraph 8.b. Alterations shall be made, at Tenant's election, by Landlord's contractor or by a contractor reasonably approved by Landlord. If Tenant, in its sole discretion, hires Landlord's contractor to perform the Alterations (including, without limitation, the Initial Alterations), Landlord's contractor shall be entitled to receive a fee for such work of fifteen percent (15%) of the first $100,000 of the construction costs of such work, and the fee for any construction costs over such amount shall be as negotiated by Tenant and Landlord's contractor. If Landlord's contractor does not perform the Alterations pursuant to the above, Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand prior to or during the course of such construction an amount (the \"Alteration Operations Fee\") equal to five percent (5%) of the total cost of the Alterations (and for purposes of calculating the Alteration Operations Fee, such cost shall include architectural and engineering fees, but shall not include permit fees) as compensation to Landlord for electrical energy consumed in connection with the work, freight elevator operation, additional cleaning expenses, additional security services, review of plans and specifications, and for other miscellaneous costs incurred by Landlord as result of the work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Alteration Operations Fee shall not be due with respect to Cosmetic Alterations, and in lieu thereof Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within thirty (30) days after Landlord's demand for the actual and reasonable fees paid by Landlord to third party architects, engineers or other consultants retained by Landlord to review the Cosmetic Alterations and confirm that they qualify as such, and (ii) the Alteration Operations Fee with respect to the Initial Alterations shall be an amount equal to Sixty-Three Thousand Four Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($63,467.00). All such work shall be performed diligently and in a first-class workmanlike manner and in accordance with plans and specifications reasonably approved by Landlord, and shall comply with all Legal Requirements and Landlord's reasonable construction procedures and requirements for the Building, as in effect from time to time (including Landlord's reasonable requirements relating to insurance and contractor qualifications) (the \"Building Construction Standards\"). In no event shall Tenant employ any person, entity 11 <PAGE> or contractor to perform work in the Premises whose presence may give rise to a labor or other disturbance in the Building. Default by Tenant in the payment of any sums agreed to be paid by Tenant for or in connection with an Alteration (regardless of whether such agreement is pursuant to this Paragraph 9 or separate instrument) shall entitle Landlord to all the same remedies as for non-payment of rent hereunder, subject to the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period under Paragraph 25.a. below. Any Alterations, including, without limitation, moveable partitions that are affixed to the Premises (but excluding moveable, free standing partitions) and all carpeting, shall at once become part of the Building and the property of Landlord. Tenant shall give Landlord not less than five (5) days prior written notice of the date the construction of the Alteration is to commence. Landlord may post and record an appropriate notice of nonresponsibility with respect to any Alteration and Tenant shall maintain any such notices posted by Landlord in or on the Premises. b. Upon Tenant's written request expressly referring to this Paragraph 9.b., Landlord shall advise Tenant at the time of Landlord's approval of any Alteration requested by Tenant or, if pursuant to Paragraph 9.a. Landlord's approval is not required, within five (5) Business Days after such written request by Tenant, whether Landlord will require the removal of the Alteration and restoration of the Premises to its previous condition at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Those Alterations so required by Landlord to be removed from the Premises at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease shall be so removed by Tenant and the Premises shall be restored by Tenant to their condition prior to the making of the Alterations, ordinary wear and tear excepted. If Tenant fails to request such determination by Landlord as set forth above, then at Landlord's sole election exercised at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease any or all such Alterations shall be removed and the Premises so restored. If Tenant requests such determination by Landlord as set forth above, and Landlord fails to timely respond thereto, Landlord shall be deemed to have exercised its right to require that Tenant remove such Alterations at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and restore the Premises as set forth above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be obligated to remove from the Premises any of the Initial Alterations which are normal and customary general office improvements. The removal of the Alterations and the restoration of the Premises shall be performed by a general contractor selected by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord, in which event Tenant shall pay the general contractor's fees and costs in connection with such work. Any separate work letter or other agreement which is hereafter entered into between Landlord and Tenant pertaining to Alterations shall be deemed to automatically incorporate the terms of this Lease without the necessity for further reference thereto. 10. Repair. a. By taking possession of the Premises, Tenant agrees that the Premises are in good condition and repair, but the foregoing shall not relieve Landlord from its obligation to perform Landlord's Work as required by Paragraph 4.c. above, or from its repair obligations pursuant to Paragraphs 10.b. and 26 below. Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall keep the Premises and every part thereof (including the interior walls and ceilings of the Premises, those portions of the Building systems located within and exclusively serving the Premises, and improvements and Alterations) in good condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Tenant waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of Landlord as provided by any Legal Requirement now or hereafter in effect. It is specifically understood and agreed that, except as specifically set forth in this Lease, Landlord has no obligation and has made no promises to alter, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Premises or any part thereof, and that no representations respecting the condition of the Premises or the Building have been made by Landlord to Tenant. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1932(1), 1941 and 1942 and of any similar Legal Requirement now or hereafter in effect. b. Landlord shall repair and maintain in good condition and repair the Base Building (other than the portions of Building systems that are Tenant's responsibility to maintain and repair pursuant to Paragraph 10.a. above) and common areas of the Real Property; provided, however, that to the extent repairs which Landlord is required to make pursuant to this Paragraph 10.b. are necessitated by the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees or contractors, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of such repair within thirty (30) days after Landlord's demand to the extent Landlord is not reimbursed therefor by insurance (assuming for such purpose that Landlord carries the insurance it is required to carry pursuant to Paragraph 15.d. below). Landlord shall in no event be obligated to repair any ordinary wear and tear to the Premises. Landlord shall repair and maintain the Real Property in accordance with the foregoing provisions to the standards of other first-class high-rise office buildings in the San Francisco financial district. 11. Abandonment. Tenant shall not abandon (within the meaning of California Civil Code Section 1951.2) the Premises or any part thereof at any time during the term hereof. Tenant understands that if Tenant so abandons the Premises, the risk of fire, other casualty and vandalism to the Premises and the Building will be increased. Accordingly, such action by Tenant shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, or if Tenant abandons or surrenders all or any part of the Premises or is dispossessed of the Premises by process of law, or otherwise, any movable furniture, equipment, trade fixtures, or other personal property belonging to Tenant and left on the Premises shall at the option of Landlord be deemed to be abandoned and, whether or not the property is deemed 12 <PAGE> abandoned, Landlord shall have the right to remove such property from the Premises and charge Tenant for the removal and any restoration of the Premises as provided in Paragraph 9. Landlord may charge Tenant for the storage of Tenant's property left on the Premises at such rates as Landlord may from time to time reasonably determine, or, Landlord may, at its option, store Tenant's property in a public warehouse at Tenant's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the provisions of this Paragraph 11 nor any other provision of this Lease shall impose upon Landlord any obligation to care for or preserve any of Tenant's property left upon the Premises, and Tenant hereby waives and releases Landlord from any claim or liability in connection with the removal of such property from the Premises and the storage thereof and specifically waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 with respect to such release. Landlord's action or inaction with regard to the provisions of this Paragraph 11 shall not be construed as a waiver of Landlord's right to require Tenant to remove its property, restore any damage to the Premises and the Building caused by such removal, and make any restoration required pursuant to Paragraph 9 above. 12. Liens. Tenant shall not permit any mechanic's, materialman's or other liens arising out of work performed at the Premises by or on behalf of Tenant to be filed against the fee of the Real Property nor against Tenant's interest in the Premises. Landlord shall have the right to post and keep posted on the Premises any notices which it deems necessary for protection from such liens. If any such liens are filed, Landlord may, upon twenty (20) days' written notice to Tenant, without waiving its rights based on such breach by Tenant and without releasing Tenant from any obligations hereunder, pay and satisfy the same and in such event the sums so paid by Landlord shall be due and payable by Tenant immediately without notice or demand, with interest from the date paid by Landlord through the date Tenant pays Landlord, at the Interest Rate. Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord and the other Indemnitees (as defined in Paragraph 14.b. below) harmless from and against any Claims (as defined in Paragraph 14.b. below) for mechanics', materialmen's or other liens in connection with any Alterations, repairs or any work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by or for Tenant, other than Claims due to Landlord's failure to disburse Landlord's Allowance in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph 4.b. above. 13. Assignment and Subletting. a. Landlord's Consent. Landlord's and Tenant's agreement with regard to Tenant's right to transfer all or part of its interest in the Premises is as expressly set forth in this Paragraph 13. Tenant agrees that, except upon Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall not (subject to Landlord's rights under Paragraph 13.d. below) be unreasonably withheld, neither this Lease nor all or any part of the leasehold interest created hereby shall, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, be assigned, mortgaged, pledged, encumbered or otherwise transferred by Tenant or Tenant's legal representatives or successors in interest (collectively an \"assignment\") and neither the Premises nor any part thereof shall be sublet or be used or occupied for any purpose by anyone other than Tenant (collectively, a \"sublease\"). Except where Landlord's consent is expressly not required hereunder, any assignment or subletting without Landlord's prior written consent shall, at Landlord's option, be void and shall constitute an Event of Default entitling Landlord to exercise all remedies available to Landlord under this Lease and at law. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that, among other circumstances for which Landlord may reasonably withhold its consent to an assignment or sublease, it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent where: (i) the assignment or subletting would increase the operating costs for the Building or the burden on the Building services, or generate additional foot traffic, elevator usage or security concerns in the Building, or create an increased probability of the comfort and/or safety of Landlord and other tenants in the Building being compromised or reduced, (ii) the space will be used for a school or training facility, an entertainment, sports or recreation facility, retail sales to the public (unless Tenant's permitted use is retail sales), a personnel or employment agency (other than executive offices of the same not having substantial dealings with the public), an office or facility of any governmental or quasi-governmental agency or authority having any on-premises dealings with the general public, a place of public assembly (including without limitation a meeting center, theater or public forum), any use by or affiliation with a foreign government (including without limitation an embassy or consulate or similar office), or a facility for the provision of social, welfare or clinical health services or sleeping accommodations (whether temporary, daytime or overnight); (iii) the proposed assignee or subtenant is a current tenant of the Building, or is a prospective tenant of the Building with whom Landlord has entered into a letter of intent (or similar document) or exchanged an offer and counteroffer, and in either such case, Landlord has or will have, in the applicable delivery period, available space in the Building that is comparable to the Premises or the portion thereof subject to such subletting, as applicable, or that otherwise meets such tenant's or prospective tenant's needs (including delivery schedule); (iv) Landlord reasonably disapproves of the proposed assignee or subtenant's reputation or creditworthiness; (v) Landlord reasonably determines that the character of the business that would be conducted by the proposed assignee or subtenant at the Premises, or the manner of conducting such business, would be inconsistent with the character of the Building as a first-class office building; (vi) the assignment or subletting may conflict with any exclusive uses granted to other tenants of the Real Property, or with the terms of any easement, covenant, condition or restriction, or other agreement affecting the Real Property; (vii) the assignment or subletting would involve a change in use from that expressly permitted under this Lease; or (viii) Landlord reasonably determines that there is a material risk that the proposed assignee may be unable to perform all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease or the proposed 13 <PAGE> subtenant may be unable to perform all of its obligations under the proposed sublease. Landlord's foregoing rights and options shall continue throughout the entire term of this Lease. For purposes of this Paragraph 13, the following events shall be deemed an assignment or sublease, as appropriate: (i) the issuance of equity interests (whether stock, partnership interests or otherwise) in Tenant or any subtenant or assignee, or any entity controlling any of them, to any person or group of related persons, in a single transaction or a series of related or unrelated transactions, such that, following such issuance, such person or group shall have Control (as defined below) of Tenant or any subtenant or assignee; (ii) a transfer of Control of Tenant or any subtenant or assignee, or any entity controlling any of them, in a single transaction or a series of related or unrelated transactions (including, without limitation, by consolidation, merger, acquisition or reorganization), except that the transfer of outstanding capital stock or other listed equity interests by persons or parties other than \"insiders\" within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through the \"over-the-counter\" market or any recognized national or international securities exchange, shall not be included in determining whether Control has been transferred; (iii) a reduction of Tenant's assets to the point that this Lease is substantially Tenant's only asset; or (iv) a change or conversion in the form of entity of Tenant, any subtenant or assignee, or any entity controlling any of them, which has the effect of limiting the liability of any of the partners, members or other owners of such entity. \"Control\" shall mean direct or indirect ownership of 50% or more of all of the voting stock of a corporation or 50% or more of the legal or equitable interest in any other business entity, or the power to direct the operations of any entity (by equity ownership, contract or otherwise). If this Lease is assigned, whether or not in violation of the terms of this Lease, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee. If the Premises or any part thereof is sublet, Landlord may, upon an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder, collect rent from the subtenant. In either event, Landlord may apply the amount collected from the assignee or subtenant to Tenant's monetary obligations hereunder. The consent by Landlord to an assignment or subletting hereunder shall not relieve Tenant or any assignee or subtenant from obtaining Landlord's express prior written consent to any other or further assignment or subletting. Neither an assignment or subletting nor the collection of rent by Landlord from any person other than Tenant, nor the application of any such rent as provided in this Paragraph 13.a. shall be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Paragraph 13.a. or release Tenant from its obligation to comply with the provisions of this Lease and Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable for all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease. b. Processing Expenses. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Landlord's cost of processing each proposed assignment or subletting for which Landlord's consent is required hereunder, an amount equal to the sum of (i) Landlord's reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees, plus (ii) the sum of $750.00 for the cost of Landlord's administrative, accounting and clerical time (collectively, \"Processing Costs\"), and the amount of all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred by Landlord arising from the assignee or sublessee moving into the subject space (including, without limitation, costs of freight elevator operation for moving of furnishings and trade fixtures, security service, janitorial and cleaning service, and rubbish removal service). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Landlord shall not be required to process any request for Landlord's consent to an assignment or subletting until Tenant has paid to Landlord the amount of Landlord's estimate of the Processing Costs and all other direct and indirect costs and expenses of Landlord and its agents arising from the assignee or subtenant taking occupancy. c. Consideration to Landlord. In the event of any assignment or sublease, except with respect to an assignment or sublease pursuant to Paragraph 13.g., Landlord shall be entitled to receive, as additional rent hereunder, fifty percent (50%) of any consideration (including, without limitation, payment for leasehold improvements and any \"Leasehold Profit\" as defined below) paid by the assignee or subtenant for the assignment or sublease and, in the case of a sublease, fifty percent (50%) of the excess of the amount of rent paid for the sublet space by the subtenant over the amount of Monthly Rent under Paragraph 5 above and Additional Rent under Paragraph 7 above attributable to the sublet space for the corresponding month; except that Tenant may recapture, on an amortized basis over the term of the sublease or assignment, together with interest on the unamortized balance at a rate per annum equal to three (3) percentage points over the Treasury Rate charged as of the commencement date of such assignment or sublease (i) any brokerage commissions paid by Tenant in connection with the subletting or assignment (not to exceed commissions typically paid in the market at the time of such subletting or assignment), (ii) reasonable legal fees paid by Tenant in connection with such assignment or subletting (provided that such legal fees shall not exceed One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) for an assignment of the Lease and shall not exceed Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) for any single sublease) and (iii) any improvement allowance or construction costs incurred by Tenant in connection with the assignment or sublease (collectively the \"Assignment or Subletting Costs\"), provided that, as a condition to Tenant recapturing the Assignment or Subletting Costs, Tenant shall provide to Landlord, within ninety (90) days of Landlord's execution of Landlord's consent to the assignment or subletting, a detailed accounting of the Assignment or Subletting Costs theretofore incurred by Tenant and supporting documents, such as receipts and construction invoices, and within one-hundred eighty (180) days of Landlord's execution of Landlord's consent to the assignment or subletting, a detailed accounting of all Assignment or Subletting Costs to be taken into account hereunder and supporting documents, such as receipts and construction invoices. To effect the foregoing, Tenant shall deduct from the 14 <PAGE> monthly amounts received by Tenant from the subtenant or assignee as rent or Fconsideration (i) the Monthly Rent and Additional Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord for the subject space and (ii) the incremental amount, on an amortized basis, of the Assignment or Subletting Costs, and fifty percent (50%) of the then remaining sum shall be paid promptly to Landlord. \"Leasehold Profit\" shall be the value allocated to the leasehold between the parties to the assignment or sublease, but in no event less than the excess of the present value of the fair market rent of the Premises for the remaining term of this Lease after such assignment or sublease, over the present value of the Monthly Rent payable hereunder for such remaining term, as reasonably determined by Landlord. Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall assign to Landlord all amounts to be paid to Tenant by any such subtenant or assignee and that belong to Landlord, and shall direct such subtenant or assignee to pay the same directly to Landlord. If there is more than one sublease under this Lease, the amounts (if any) to be paid by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be separately calculated for each sublease and amounts due Landlord with regard to any one sublease may not be offset against rental and other consideration pertaining to or due under any other sublease. d. Procedures. If Tenant desires to assign this Lease or any interest therein or sublet all or part of the Premises, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice thereof and the terms proposed (the \"Sublease Notice\"), which Sublease Notice, in the case of a proposed sublease, shall designate the space proposed to be sublet. Landlord shall have the prior right and option (to be exercised by written notice to Tenant given within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's notice) (i) to sublet from Tenant the portion of the Premises proposed by Tenant to be sublet, for the term for which such portion is proposed to be sublet, but at the lesser of the proposed sublease rent or the same rent (including Additional Rent as provided for in Paragraph 7 above) as Tenant is required to pay to Landlord under this Lease for the same space, computed on a pro rata square footage basis, and during the term of such sublease Tenant shall be released of its obligations under this Lease with regard to the subject space, provided, however, that if the portion of the Premises proposed by Tenant to be sublet consists of space on more than one floor of the Building, Landlord may exercise (or not exercise) its sublet option under this clause (i) separately as to the proposed sublet space on each such floor, (ii) in the case of any proposed assignment of this Lease or any proposed sublet of all or any portion of the Premises the term of which is greater than five (5) years or expires during the last fifteen (15) months of the term of this Lease, to terminate this Lease in its entirety (in the case of any proposed assignment) or as it pertains to the portion of the Premises so proposed by Tenant to be sublet (in the case of any such proposed sublet), provided, however, that if the portion of the Premises proposed by Tenant to be sublet consists of space on more than one floor of the Building, Landlord may exercise (or not exercise) its termination option under this clause (ii) separately as to the proposed sublet space on each such floor, or (iii) to approve Tenant's proposal to assign or sublet conditional upon Landlord's subsequent written approval of the specific assignment or sublease obtained by Tenant and the specific assignee or subtenant named therein. If Landlord exercises its option in (i) above, then Landlord may, at Landlord's sole cost, construct improvements in the subject space and, so long as the improvements are suitable for general office purposes, Landlord shall have no obligation to restore the subject space to its original condition following the termination of the sublease. If Landlord exercises its option described in (iii) above, then Tenant shall have six (6) months thereafter to submit to Landlord, for Landlord's written approval, Tenant's proposed assignment or sublease agreement (in which the proposed assignee or subtenant shall be named, and which agreement shall otherwise meet the requirements of Paragraph 13.e. below), together with a current financial statement of such proposed assignee or subtenant and any other information reasonably requested by Landlord. If Tenant fails to submit the specific assignment or sublease and other required information within such time, or if the terms of the specific assignment or sublease submitted by Tenant vary from the terms set forth in the Sublease Notice approved by Landlord pursuant to (iii) above, then Tenant shall be required to submit a new Sublease Notice for Landlord's evaluation pursuant to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If Landlord fails to exercise any such option to sublet or to terminate, this shall not be construed as or constitute a waiver of any of the provisions of Paragraphs 13.a., b., c. or d. herein. If Landlord exercises any option to sublet or to terminate, any costs of demising the portion of the Premises affected by such subleasing or termination shall be borne by Tenant. In addition, Landlord shall have no liability for any real estate brokerage commission(s) or with respect to any of the costs and expenses that Tenant may have incurred in connection with its proposed assignment or subletting, and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord and all other Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims (as defined in Paragraph 14.b. below), including, without limitation, claims for commissions arising from such proposed assignment or subletting. Landlord's foregoing rights and options shall continue throughout the entire term of this Lease. e. Documentation. No permitted assignment or subletting by Tenant shall be effective until there has been delivered to Landlord a fully executed counterpart of the assignment or sublease which expressly provides that (i) the assignee or subtenant may not further assign or sublet the assigned or sublet space without Landlord's prior written consent (which, in the case of a further assignment proposed by an assignee, shall not be unreasonably withheld, subject to Landlord's rights under the provisions of this Paragraph 13), subject, however, to an assignee's right to further assign this Lease without Landlord's consent pursuant to Paragraph 13.g. below, (ii) the assignee or subtenant will comply with all of the provisions of this Lease applicable to the Premises (or, in the case of a sublease, applicable to the portion of the Premises covered by such sublease), and Landlord may enforce the Lease provisions directly against such assignee or subtenant (except that, in the case of a sublease, the subtenant's liability for rent shall not exceed the rent set forth in the sublease), (iii) in the case of an assignment, the assignee assumes all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease arising on or after the date of the assignment, and (iv) in the case of a sublease, the subtenant 15 <PAGE"
