That is one of the more common responses to a data engineer when putting a data pipeline in production. It is easy to dig down into the code and try to optimize it. My experience as a data engineer shows me that it is often easier and more efficient, both in time spent and outcome, to focus on a more holistic view of the pipeline. In this talk, we will look at a structured process to optimize our batch pipelines. We will introduce steps that make our process data-driven instead of a gut feeling. With examples from real-world cases where delivery time was reduced in order by magnitude, we will look at actions where taken. The intended audience is a beginner to intermediate data engineers. After the talk, you will have a better understanding of how to optimize your pipeline and be able to explain the steps taken for a stakeholder. You will know: * what metrics to look at * how to visualize the metrics * how to detect bottlenecks and other time thieves from the metrics * what actions to take.\n\nLecture Notes Unit4 Chapter13 users , roles and privileges\n\nLecture Notes Unit4 Chapter13 users , roles and privilegesMurugan146644\n\nDescription: Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) concepts, tailored for final year B.Sc. Computer Science students affiliated with Alagappa University. This document covers fundamental principles and advanced topics in RDBMS, offering a structured approach to understanding databases in the context of modern computing. PDF content is prepared from the text book Learn Oracle 8I by JOSE A RAMALHO. Key Topics Covered: Main Topic : USERS, Roles and Privileges In Oracle databases, users are individuals or applications that interact with the database. Each user is assigned specific roles, which are collections of privileges that define their access levels and capabilities. Privileges are permissions granted to users or roles, allowing actions like creating tables, executing procedures, or querying data. Properly managing users, roles, and privileges is essential for maintaining security and ensuring that users have appropriate access to database resources, thus supporting effective data management and integrity within the Oracle environment. Sub-Topic : Definition of User, User Creation Commands, Grant Command, Deleting a user, Privileges, System privileges and object privileges, Grant Object Privileges, Viewing a users, Revoke Object Privileges, Creation of Role, Granting privileges and roles to role, View the roles of a user , Deleting a role Target Audience: Final year B.Sc. Computer Science students at Alagappa University seeking a solid foundation in RDBMS principles for academic and practical applications.
