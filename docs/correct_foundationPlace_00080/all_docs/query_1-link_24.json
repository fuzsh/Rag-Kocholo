Our fourth generation Adjunct Trustees will review the remaining applications and make their own recommendation by the end of 2020.\n\nThank you to all the organizations that took the time to participate in our grant making process.\n\nAs always, our Grant Committee had a tough job. This year they selected nine organizations in California, Oregon, Texas and Washington. You can learn more about these organizations and their projects below!\n\nOregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) (Portland, OR)\n\nWhen OMSI’s Chemistry Lab opened in the mid-1990s, it was an incredibly innovative space. Funded by the National Science Foundation, it was the very first wet chemistry lab to be open to the public in the United States. The lab was outfitted with the original furnishings (including counters) that were installed for the grand opening of the space, more than 25 years ago.Today, the Chemistry lab engages 200,000+ visitors annually with a wide variety of hands-on experiments and activities. Through self-directed and facilitated programs, the lab and gives visitors opportunities to safely mix, measure, and pour chemicals. It is included with OMSI’s general admission. OMSI also offers reserved labs for visiting school groups. Families and school groups with children as young as five years old, enjoy the demonstrations and experiments that the lab has to offer. With the help of the PFF grant, the goal of this project is to upgrade the original counter-tops in OMSI’s Chemistry Lab, replacing them with a new, phenolic resin product to transform the space into a cleaner, safer, and more functional lab facility. This project will benefit an estimated 1.25 million learners over the course of the next five years alone.\n\nCascade Bicycle Club (Seattle, WA)\n\nLet’s Go! is a free, three-week safety unit that provides physical education teachers with the curriculum, skills, and equipment needed to implement a bicycle and pedestrian safety course for their students. The program gives students skills and knowledge to prevent the most common bicycle and pedestrian errors; this includes learning the anatomy of intersections, using situational awareness, fitting a helmet, basic bike handling skills, right of way concepts and more. The PFF grant will provide a new bicycle fleet of 33 bicycles for Middle School aged children. The project will reach 120 middle school students, ages 11-14, in four Seattle Public Schools.\n\nCompass Family Services(San Francisco, CA)\n\nCompass Clara House has more than 20 years of experience in housing families experiencing homelessness while partnering with them to achieve their educational and career goals in order to transition from homelessness to stability and economic independence. Thirteen families at a time live in private, furnished apartments for 18-24 months in a healthy and safe environment that emphasizes a respectful peer community where families can heal and make positive changes. While at Clara House, parents work to find and secure permanent housing; increase their skills to establish a career path; learn independent living and decision-making skills; and learn coping mechanisms and skills for dealing with issues related to addiction, relationships, self-care, and parenting. A grant from the Papé Family Foundation will go towards the following building improvement projects that will help to maintain the safety and health of residents and program staff.\n\nGenesis Community Health, Inc. (Garden City, ID)\n\nThe Genesis’ Dental Clinic is the only free clinic in Southern Idaho’s Treasure Valley where adults experiencing poverty can get relief from tooth pain at no cost to them. These individuals often do not have access to dental care, and as a result, are often faced with oral health issues that become exacerbated. Genesis’ preventative dental services keep adults out of the ER and ultimately lower healthcare costs for everyone. Genesis is expanding dental services by 25% to keep up with the dental demand. The PFF grant will provide updated equipment for the expansion of the dental program.\n\nKids FIRST(Eugene, OR)\n\nOver the past 25 years, Kids FIRST has continually assessed what can be done to improve and advance the fundamental intervention services provided to child victims of abuse from across Lane County. We serve over 600 children and their families each year for concerns of child sexual abuse, physical abuse, and witness to violence. 2/3 of the children we serve are under the age of 12. Limitation of space has long hindered our ability to expand services. From this need, the Kids FIRST Capital Project was born; a quest to secure a long-term home to better serve children and families. With the support of the PFF grant, this new center will allow our services to transition from 3,090 square feet to over 9,000 square feet and will allow greater opportunities for Kids FIRST. The Kids FIRST Capital Project is sustainable, as it will house our abuse intervention services for many years to come. Unlike our former leased space, we are the owners of our new building, which means we have the ability to customize the space to appropriately to fit the needs of our clients.\n\nMcCall Public Library Foundation(McCall, ID)\n\nThe McCall Public Library moved to its current location and facilities in 1973, and since that time McCall’s population has nearly doubled. At its current 4,000 square feet the McCall Public Library’s facilities are at a breaking point and hinder access to resources, knowledge, and meeting space for community residents. PFF’s grant to The Next Chapter Library Expansion Project will support the expansion of the library facility to 15,000 square feet in order to meet the current needs of our community and to allow for future growth. An expansion will drastically improve the ability of the McCall Public Library to serve as the leading resource for knowledge and central hub for social programs, community gatherings, and educational services in the rural mountain town of McCall, Idaho. The expansion of McCall Public Library’s facilities is vital to maintaining our community’s number one public resource. It will increase access to innovative programming such as STEM workshops in a new Makers’ Space and forward-thinking, solution-based social programs in the Citizens’ Hall. It will improve patron experiences with the addition of comfortable reading areas, a dedicated Children’s Library, private study rooms and upgraded lighting, heating and tech systems. It will allow for the resource collection to grow and host traveling exhibits. The library expansion will meet the needs of our growing population and will result in energy efficiency cost savings. It will allow the library to meet 21st century technological demands of its patrons and contribute greatly to the overall sustainability and procurement of knowledge in McCall and the surrounding area.\n\nMetta, INC (Dallas, TX)\n\nMetta, Inc.’s mission is to bring a mindfulness connection into homes and communities throughout the United States by offering training, scholarships and other financial assistance to those whose income or other barriers, such as disabilities, have prevented them from having access to such programs. Our primary goal is to help children and adults overcome stress caused by disability, poverty, violence, hunger and so many other challenges. Metta will be the first organization of its kind in the U.S. to offer a school-based curriculum that can positively shift the paradigm. Metta, Inc. in partnership with Present Moment Labs is breaking new ground by bringing mindfulness to children with special needs, as well as their teachers and parents. This innovative new program is slated to launch in 2020 in Grand Prairie Independent School District. Specifically, the PFF grant will help to cover the cost to purchase 200 decks of flashcards and deliver mindfulness certification for 20 educators.\n\nTeam Reed(Seattle, WA)\n\nTeam Read believes that all kids deserve to be great readers, and that teens should have access to meaningful paid jobs, and neither of those things should be limited to the school year. Summer is an important time for students to prepare for the school year ahead and fill proficiency gaps, preventing the “summer slide” that can cause students to lose a month or more of the knowledge they gained during the previous school year, with reading comprehension, vocabulary growth, and reading ability the skills that suffer most. Reading at grade level is critical, impacting student success in all subjects, including math, which itself is critical to success in higher-order STEAM subjects. The Papé Family Foundation grant will support 2020’s Summer STEAM: Reading Tutoring + STEAM Enrichment program. Grant funds will be used to purchase tutoring site supplies such as books, printed materials including curriculum workbooks, t-shirts for readers and coaches, and to fund Free Friday hands-on programs with community partners like Pacific Science Center, The Reptile Man, and more.\n\nTexas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children (Dallas, TX)\n\nScottish Rite Hospital opened its doors to the children of Texas in 1921 when one of Dallas’ first orthopedic surgeons, W. B. Carrell, M.D., was approached by a group of Texas Masons to provide superior medical care to children suffering from polio. With the introduction of the Salk and Sabin vaccines in the mid-1950s, which virtually eradicated polio in the Western Hemisphere, the hospital broadened its focus to include other orthopedic conditions. Thanks to the generosity of supporters throughout the country, Scottish Rite for Children has emerged as one of the nation’s leading medical centers for the treatment of pediatric orthopedic conditions, including scoliosis, clubfoot, hand differences, hip disorders, limb length discrepancies and sports injuries. Each year, our staff provides extensive treatment and therapy to more than 25,000 children, regardless of any family’s ability to pay.\n\nOne of the crucial responsibilities of our nursing staff is to provide patients with supportive care, including monitoring body temperature, respiratory status, blood oxygenation levels and blood pressure both before surgery and during the post-operative, recovery period. A portable vital signs monitor allows for seamless observation of oxygen saturation, temperature, respiration rate, heart rate, and blood pressure for a patient from pre-operative evaluation through the duration of the inpatient stay. This equipment is critical to the health of each patient. The Pape Family Foundation grant to purchase two vital signs monitors and accompanying work stations for the hospital’s Inpatient Nursing Unit ."
