        "text": "Skydance Media's Merger With Paramount to Form New Paramount\n\nA Latham M&A team represents Skydance Media in its merger with Paramount, valuing New Paramount at approximately US$28 billion and Skydance at US$4.75 billion, and an Investor Group, comprising the Ellison Family and RedBird Capital Partners, in an over US$8 billion investment in Paramount Global and the acquisition of National Amusements, Inc. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n\nWinning Dismissal for X Corp. in Illinois BIPA Class Action\n\nLatham litigators secured a critical win for X Corp. (formerly known as Twitter) in a putative class action in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that X violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) in its use of PhotoDNA software to identify and remove images of child exploitation from the X platform. A federal court decision affirmed that data must be capable of identifying an individual to qualify as a \"biometric identifier\" under BIPA, resulting in a significant win for X Corp. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to plausibly allege that PhotoDNA collects biometric identifiers, such as facial geometry scans, and agreed with X's position that data must be identifiable to qualify under BIPA. This ruling is favorable for other companies facing similar BIPA claims.\n\nHistoric US Supreme Court Decision Overturning Chevron Deference\n\nThe US Supreme Court sided with Latham client Relentless Inc. in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce, overruling the Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to Executive Branch agencies on ambiguous statutes. Latham partner Roman Martinez argued for Relentless, a small New England fishing company challenging a rule mandating private companies to fund at-sea government observers. The Court held that under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must independently determine if an agency has acted within its statutory authority, rejecting Chevron's deference principle. This landmark decision recalibrates the balance of power between agencies and courts, with significant implications for federal agencies.\n\nST Telemedia Global Data Centres S$1.75 Billion Investment From KKR-Led Consortium\n\nA Latham team advised ST Telemedia Global Data Centres, one of the world’s fastest-growing data center providers, on its S$1.75 billion (approximately US$1.3 billion) investment from global investment firm KKR (through its Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors II Fund), and Singtel, Asia’s leading communications technology group. The transaction marks the largest digital infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia to date in 2024.\n\nSecured Dismissal for Advocate Aurora Health in GIPA Class Action\n\nA Cook County Circuit Judge issued a decision granting Latham’s combined motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment and dismissed a proposed Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) class action lawsuit, with prejudice. This decision is the first involuntary dismissal of a GIPA claim against a hospital corporation in Illinois.\n\nFirst Public Data Center Securitization in EMEA\n\nA Latham cross-practice team advised Barclays and SMBC on a £600 million data center securitization for Vantage Data Centers, the first public securitization of data centers in EMEA. The groundbreaking deal marks Vantage’s tenth data center securitization globally and ninth green debt issuance. Vantage Data Centers is a leading global provider of hyperscale data center campuses.\n\nGroundbreaking Defense Win for Cendyn in Antitrust Class Action\n\nA cross-office antitrust litigation team has achieved a precedent-setting victory for Cendyn Group, LLC, defeating “hub and spoke” conspiracy allegations tied to algorithmic pricing recommendations, with wide impact in a hot area of law at the intersection of antitrust and AI. The court’s May 2024 decision marks the first complete defense dismissal in the recent wave of algorithmic pricing antitrust cases.\n\nViking’s Upsized US$1.54 Billion IPO\n\nViking Holdings, one of the world’s leading travel companies, priced an upsized US$1.54 billion initial public offering. A multidisciplinary team represented the underwriters in the offering, which is the largest US IPO at pricing in 2024 to date.\n\nEndeavor’s US$25 Billion Take-Private Acquisition By Silver Lake\n\nA Latham M&A and tax team represents Endeavor in its US$25 billion take-private acquisition by Silver Lake, a global leader in technology investing. The transaction is the largest private equity sponsor take-private in 10 years and largest ever in the media and entertainment sector.\n\nAdvising on €4.2 Billion Sale of Dorna Sports to Liberty Media\n\nA cross-practice Latham team advised Bridgepoint and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) on the sale of Dorna Sports S.L. to Liberty Media in a transaction that values the company at €4.2 billion. Dorna is the international sports management, media, and marketing company that holds the global rights to organize the MotoGP and WSBK Championships, which together represent the two preeminent motorcycle racing series in the world.\n\nRepresenting SRS Distribution in US$18.25 Billion Acquisition by The Home Depot\n\nA Latham private equity team has advised SRS Distribution (SRS), a Leonard Green & Partners and Berkshire Partners portfolio company, on its US$18.25 billion acquisition by The Home Depot. Since its founding in 2008, SRS has become a leading distributor in the United States in the residential roofing, landscape, and pool supply markets, with more than 760 branches across 47 states. The Home Depot is the world’s largest home improvement retailer.\n\nReddit, Inc.’s US$748 Million IPO\n\nA multidisciplinary Latham team with extensive technology experience has advised social media icon Reddit, Inc., a community of communities, on its high-profile US$748 million initial public offering, one of the largest IPOs of 2024 to date. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 21, 2024, under the ticker symbol RDDT.\n\nAdvising on £1.6 Billion Debt Financing for Petrol Forecourts Acquisition\n\nLatham’s London and European office teams advised a group of 14 arranging banks on a £1.6 billion debt financing for Motor Fuel Group’s (MFG) acquisition of petrol forecourts from Morrisons. The acquisition will position MFG as one of the largest and most significant ultra-rapid EV charge point operators in the UK, with over 1,300 sites serving and powering millions of customers a week.\n\nAthens International Airport’s Landmark IPO\n\nA cross-border Latham team advised Athens International Airport S.A. — the operator of the largest airport in Greece with more than 28 million passengers in 2023 — on the listing of its shares on the regulated market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX). The landmark transaction represents the first major listing in Europe in 2024 and the biggest initial public offering in Greece in over 15 years.\n\nJackson Hole Mountain Resort Acquisition\n\nA multidisciplinary Latham team represented the buyer group on all aspects of its acquisition of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR), an iconic mountain destination in Teton Village, Wyoming. The buyers, which include JHMR Board Members Eric Macy, Mike Corbat, their families and a small, select group of co-investors, take over for the Kemmerer family after 31 years of ownership.\n\nTom Brady’s Big Win\n\nA cross-border Latham team advised NFL icon Tom Brady in an agreement to form Team Brady, leading to the team’s win at the inaugural UIM E1 World Championship race in Jeddah — the all-new electric raceboat competition. On February 3, 2024, the final day of the race concluded with a convincing win by Team Brady, after two days of tense competition in front of thousands of fans on the Red Sea. Brady’s team ownership was announced in July 2023.\n\nTJC’s US$6.85 Billion Fund Formation\n\nA Latham Investment Funds team represented TJC LP (TJC), a middle-market private equity firm, on the formation of its Resolute Fund VI (the Fund), totaling US$6.85 billion.
