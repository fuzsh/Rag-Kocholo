        "text": "Golden Gate Ferry Timeline\n\n1967: Concern over increasing traffic congestion on the Golden Gate Bridge triggered the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to ask the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District (GGBHD) Board of Directors to explore the idea for ferry service between San Francisco and Marin County.\n\nJuly 1969: Arthur D. Little, Inc., prepared a report, Feasibility Study of San Francisco-Marin Ferry System, funded by Marin County Transit District and the City and County of San Francisco, indicating that a ferry system was feasible and should be implemented and operated by the GGBHD.\n\nNovember 10, 1969: Assembly Bill 584 authorized the GGBHD to develop a transportation facility plan to implement a mass transportation program in the U.S. Highway 101/Golden Gate Corridor and the agency’s name was changed to Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (District).\n\nJanuary 12, 1970: The District contracted Philip F. Spaulding and Associates, Seattle, WA, to design a commuter ferry system between Marin and San Francisco.

Mendocino was taken out of service and sent back to the original builder to make necessary repairs at no cost to the District. It had been determined that the aluminum used for the hull was constructed using a process that did not meet stringent marine engineering and U.S. Coast Guard regulations.\n\nMarch 26, 2004: The original Golden Gate Sausalito Ferry vessel, the M.V.

The improvements also included new perimeter signage, new in-roadway lighting systems at two crosswalks, installation of new benches at two viewing areas, and installation of traffic slowing speed bumps at four locations. Construction was completed in May 2009.\n\nOctober 10, 2008: The Board of Directors authorized the elimination of the Golden Gate Ferry “Frequent Ferry Rider” discount ticket books, effective December 31, 2008, and approved the transition to the Clipper smartcard fare payment as the sole means for receiving frequent rider discounts aboard Golden Gate Ferry.\n\nOctober 22, 2008: Golden Gate Ferry hosted an interagency rescue drill in coordination with United States Coast Guard Sector San Francisco which took place off the shore of Paradise Cay near Corte Madera, CA. The drill was designed to test the Bay Area Vessel Mutual Assistance Plan including agency emergency evacuation capabilities and mass rescue operations, as well as the ferry system transportation infrastructure. The exercise allowed participants the opportunity to test interagency coordination, communications, and planning effectiveness, and strengthen agency partnerships that are invaluable in maintaining a highly effective safety and security posture within the San Francisco Bay Area. Over 150 California Maritime Academy students played the role of passengers as emergency responders simulated response efforts. Exercise participants also included Marin County Sherriff’s Department, National Park Service, and marine units from Alameda, Contra Costa, and Marin counties.

All advertising involving religion or politics, as well as advertising that depicts anything violent, illegal, obscene, or defamatory, is excluded.\n\nOctober 26, 2012: The District Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a capital project to purchase and install two new Tier 2 marine generators on the Golden Gate Ferry Spaulding vessel M.S. Sonoma. The generators were purchased in February 2013 and installed by Admiralty Diesel Services, Inc., Mare Island, CA in early June 2013.\n\nOctober 31, 2012: Bay Area baseball fans welcomed home the World Champion San Francisco Giants team with a special parade and celebration held in San Francisco.

The work included replacement of load-bearing roller assemblies, bushings, and slides; refurbishment of heavy-scored roller tracks; rebuilding and overhaul of hydraulic components; removal, repair, and reapplication of all coatings and other associated refurbishment of the gangways; and replacement of the foam flotation and other associated rehabilitation and repairs on the terminal’s four floating fender structures.

The exercise was designed to test the tactical response to a security-related event occurring in multiple jurisdictions on the San Francisco Bay and concurrently on two ferry vessels. The tested scenario included a mass casualty incident resulting in fire and smoke, as well as passenger injuries. Both law enforcement and mutual aid boarding was also tested. The Regional Incident Command System protocols for vessel related incidents, along with fire and emergency resource response capability for an on-water mass causality incident, were also tested.\n\nJune 15, 2013: Resurfacing of the Larkspur Ferry Terminal parking lot was completed. This work, which began in March 2013, included drainage improvements and the numbering of individual parking spaces.\n\nJune 27, 2013: A contract was awarded to Marine Group Boat Works, LLC in San Diego, CA, for the refurbishment of the M.S. San Francisco. The refurbishment involved all vessel components with the exception of the original hull and two generators that were replaced as part of an earlier emissions reduction project. The work was funded entirely with grant funds from the Federal Transit Administration and the State of California under the Public Transportation Modernization, Improvement and Service Enhance Account program. This was the second vessel to undergo a complete refurbishment (the M.S. Marin was refurbished several years earlier). The vessel returned to service the following month.\n\nAugust-October 2013: America's Cup fans from the North Bay rode Golden Gate Ferry and Golden Gate Transit buses to San Francisco to watch the United States bring home the America's Cup. The two waterfront venues—the America's Cup Village at Marina Green and the America's Cup Park at Piers 27 and 29—were the perfect settings to experience this oldest international sporting event.\n\nAugust 2013: A re-imagined See Something? Say Something! public awareness campaign was rolled out. Posters were created for each of the District's operating divisions as an ongoing enhancement to existing safety and security measures. See Something? Say Something! is a simple reminder to customers to report suspicious or atypical persons or things encountered while traveling on a bus or ferry or across the Bridge. The posters—displayed throughout District facilities, at bus stops and transit terminals, and in various Bridge locations—encourage customers to join District employees as the \"eyes and ears\" of their transportation environment to aid in maintaining a safe environment for everyone. The campaign won a First Place APTA (Amercian Public Transportation Association) AdWheel Award!\n\nLabor Day Weekend 2013: During the Labor Day 2013 weekend closure of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Ferry added morning, afternoon, and late night service to provide extra capacity for East Bay residents traveling to and from San Francisco. In addition, the Golden Gate Bridge saw a 25% increase in traffic during the four-day closure.\n\nSeptember 2013: A free ferry shuttle to the Larkspur Ferry Terminal—dubbed \"The Wave\" in beautifully branded buses—was introduced as a 9-month demonstration project to help alleviate a parking shortage at the terminal. Residents of the Ross Valley communities of Fairfax, San Anselmo, Ross, Kentfield, and Greenbrae could leave their cars at home and enjoy a complimentary, hassle-free ride directly to the terminal. The service was made permanent in June 2014, based on strong ridership.\n\nSeptember 2013: A high-speed commute trip was added to the Larkspur Ferry weekday schedule at 7:30 a.m. as a 9-month demonstration project. The trip was made permanent in early 2014, based on strong ridership.\n\nOctober 2013-January 2015: Golden Gate Larkspur Ferry and the Marin Country Mart teamed up to invite San Francisco residents and visitors to discover first-class shopping, dining, and events located just steps away from the Larkspur Terminal at the Marin Country Mart. Riders were treated to a one-way ride, compliments of Marin Country Mart, and invited to Friday Night Jazz, the weekly Saturday morning farmers market, and the Sunday afternoon food truck and music event. The promotion increased off-peak, reverse-commute, and weekend ferry ridership.\n\nOctober 2013: Golden Gate Ferry provided two vessels to San Francisco Bay Ferry during the Fall 2013 BART strike and operated between Oakland and San Francisco during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods.\n\nWinter 2013/2014: The M.S.
