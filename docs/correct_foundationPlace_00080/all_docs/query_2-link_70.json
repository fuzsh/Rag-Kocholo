In procurement, an RFP also refers to a solicitation issued by a client for professional services such as architecture, engineering, and construction management, among others. Respondents usually provide their approach or strategy for delivering the work outlined in the solicitation.\n\nRFQ – Request for Qualifications – Similar to an RFP in procurement, this is a solicitation issued by a client for qualifications related to professional services. Respondents usually provide resumes and examples of similar or relevant projects to demonstrate their qualifications for delivering the work outlined in the solicitation.\n\nSF/SY – Square Feet, Square Yard – These are common units of measurement for area. Concrete slabs and walls are usually quantified, measured, and paid for by square feet or square yards.\n\nSPI – Schedule Performance Index – In earned value analysis, the SPI is a comparison of the actual progress or earned value to the planned progress or planned value. It is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV). If the SPI is equal to one, the project is on time. If the SPI is less than one, the project is behind schedule. If the CPI is greater than one, the project is ahead of schedule.\n\nSSHO – Site Safety and Health Officer – This term refers to a qualified professional that oversees on-site safety and health.

The term is analogous to “ditto.”\n\nVOC – Volatile Organic Compound – This is an organic chemical with a high vapor pressure at room temperature. VOCs are usually responsible for the odor of scents, perfumes, and pollutants. Some VOCs are harmful to humans and the environment. In the context of indoor air quality, these compounds may not be acutely toxic but can have long-term impacts on health.\n\nWBS– Work Breakdown Structure – In project management, this is a hierarchical decomposition of a project’s scope used by PMs to ensure project goals are achieved and the required deliverables are identified and created.\n\nWWF – Welded Wire Fabric – Sometimes called welded wire mesh, this is a grid of uniformly placed wires that provides flexural strength in concrete slabs, similar to rebar.\n\nSimplifying Construction Management for Field Teams\n\nGetting comfortable with the right abbreviations in construction is the first step in improving your projects.
