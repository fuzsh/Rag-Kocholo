She is a mother of two teenagers preparing for college next year. As the Industrial Design chair at California College of the Arts, Shu is deeply committed to creating education in the circular economy and fostering conscious design entrepreneurs for the future.\n\nOur alumni are at the forefront of innovation and sought after by high-tech and sustainability-driven companies eager to embrace their creative vision and ethical design ethos.\n\nWith a BFA in Industrial Design, you’ll shape the future of industries across health and wellness, entertainment, sports, transportation, lifestyle, consumer electronics, technology, food, supply chain, and services, as well as pioneer new business models. You might start your own design studio, freelance for industry giants, or showcase your work as a studio artist. You’ll have the power to disrupt industries, ignite change, and leave your mark on the world.\n\nOur design students are deeply passionate about crafting beautiful products and meaningful objects that enhance people’s lives while prioritizing environmental sustainability and revolutionizing manufacturing practices to be regenerative and conserve precious resources.\n\nIndustrial Design students may immerse themselves in design research to deeply explore discoveries, or they may gravitate toward manufacturing and product development, collaborating closely with engineers to influence supply chain impact. Industrial design can also encompass marketing and product strategy or lead to roles in education, where future design leaders are nurtured."
