        "text": "The Pioneer of Agentless Cloud Security\n\nThe single platform for all your cloud security needs that provides 100% coverage\n\nThe Challenge\n\nCloud environments and cloud native applications are the cornerstone of every company’s quest to scale their business and deliver value to their customers. Yet, existing cloud security solutions create challenges in scalability, ease-of-use, and risk prioritization–that’s why DevOps and security teams embrace the Orca CNAPP Platform that offers a revolutionary way to overcome these challenges.\n\nTraditional agent-first approaches lead to overhead and friction for DevOps and security teams, while leaving visibility gaps for workloads where agents aren’t deployed.\n\nAlert fatigue from solutions that produce long lists of alerts without context or effective risk prioritization burns teams out and results in missed critical alerts.\n\nSeparate point solutions for each layer of the tech stack and application development stage provide poor overall visibility, create more overhead and require manual correlation.\n\n2023 Gartner® Market Guide for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP)\n\nThe Orca Approach to Cloud Security\n\nDesigned for organizations operating in the cloud who need complete, centralized visibility of their entire cloud estate and want to waste less time sorting through alerts and instead focus on remediating the actual risks that matter most, Orca Security is the leading agentless CNAPP that allows security teams to work smarter, not harder.\n\nThe agentless cloud security pioneer\n\nThe Orca Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) is built on Orca’s patented SideScanning technology that scans your entire cloud estate to eliminate the gaps in coverage, organizational friction, performance hits, and high operational costs of agent-based solutions.\n\nEasy onboarding for instant ROI\n\nOnboard your cloud accounts to the Orca Platform in minutes. Orca automatically detects and monitors new cloud assets as you add them, without requiring any manual updates, increasing operational efficiency and scalability.\n\nAchieve 100% coverage\n\nOrca provides full-stack visibility and coverage for all your cloud assets across VMs, containers, storage buckets, databases, and serverless applications, so you can understand all of your cloud risks.\n\nPrioritize and understand your greatest risks\n\nOrca’s context-aware engine prioritizes the 1% of alerts that truly matter and surfaces the attack paths with the greatest impact to your business – providing you with a detailed understanding of your cloud risks and how to tackle them.\n\nA single platform with a Unified Data Model\n\nAs a purpose-built CNAPP Platform, Orca addresses all of your cloud security needs including CSPM, CWPP, CIEM, DSPM, Vulnerability Management, API Security, Compliance, and more – in a single, centralized platform, allowing you to easily query, investigate, and understand all your cloud risks and their context.\n\nQuickly trace and remediate risks from Cloud to Dev\n\nRemediating cloud risks is a huge challenge for security teams, especially in a world where DevOps is the norm. Orca not only alerts on an issue, but if applicable, also shows the code origin, even down to the line of code that caused the risk, enabling developers to remediate issues at lightning speed.\n\nUnderstand and prioritize all your cloud security risks\n\nOrca’s patented SideScanning™ technology is a radical new approach that addresses the shortcomings of traditional agent-based cloud security solutions.\n\nOrca collects data directly from your cloud configuration and the workload’s runtime block storage out-of-band.\n\nWithin minutes, Orca finds and prioritizes your most critical cloud risks, including vulnerabilities, malware, misconfigurations, lateral movement risks, IAM risks, sensitive data at risk, and suspicious activities.\n\nAs a purpose-built CNAPP, Orca combines workload-deep intelligence with cloud configuration metadata in a truly unified data model.\n\nWith Orca you can easily query your entire environment to investigate risks and remediate issues.\n\nStrategic remediation with attack path analysis\n\nWith multi-cloud Attack Path Analysis, Orca helps security teams work smarter and utilize their resources in the most effective way. Instead of trying to fix all risks, which is simply impossible, Orca shows teams which cloud security risks:\n\nEndanger their most critical business assets\n\nAre part of the most attack paths with the highest severity\n\nAffect the most cloud assets\n\nAre exposed by the most cloud assets\n\nArmed with this intelligence, security teams will instantly know where their time is spent best, relieving alert overload and burnout, as well as dramatically improving security outcomes.\n\nOrca Has You Covered\n\nlocation\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nindustry\n\nMobile Advertising\n\ncloud environment\n\nAWS, GCP\n\n“Orca adds value practically from the first day of use.
