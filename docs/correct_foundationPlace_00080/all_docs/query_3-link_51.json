        "text": "About PATH\n\npath story\n\nIt all started with a letter written by Claire and Rev. Charles Orr, calling for the community to address the ever-increasing issue of homelessness. In response, on the night of December 8, 1983, 60 people gathered together to figure out how to help people who were experiencing homelessness in their neighborhoods. That night, PATH was born.\n\nThe group started by distributing food and clothing to people living on the streets. As homelessness continued to grow nationwide, research revealed that Housing First—a best practice model that first connects people to permanent housing and then focuses on stabilization through voluntary supportive services, proved more effective. Now, over forty years later, we provide services in more than 150 cities across the state, in five regions, over 70 locations, and have completed or have in the pipeline more than 2,700 units of permanent supportive housing.\n\nPATH’s mission is to end homelessness for individuals, families, and communities. PATH does this by providing supportive services and building affordable and supportive housing across the state. PATH provides supportive services, including street outreach, interim housing, housing placement, employment assistance, mental health care, Veteran services, and substance use treatment linkages to 26,000 individuals each year. Since 2013, we have connected more than 17,000 people to permanent homes.\n\nour mission, vision, and values\n\nOur mission is to end homelessness for individuals, families, and communities. PATH envisions a world where every person has a home. Our values include creative collaborations, strategic leadership, empowerment for all, and passionate commitment.\n\nExecutive Summary of Organizational Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Assessment Plan 2022\n\nORGANIZATIONAL reports\n\nForm 990 and earlier financial statements are available upon request.\n\nCARF International Accreditation\n\nPATH currently holds a Three-Year Accreditation from CARF International in the following programs: Rapid Rehousing and Homeless Prevention under the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program.\n\nWhat is CARF?\n\nCARF International is an independent, nonprofit accreditor of health and human services providers in the areas of Aging Services, Behavioral Health, Child and Youth Services, Durable Medical Equipment, Employment and Community Services, Medical Rehabilitation, Opioid Treatment Programs, and Vision Rehabilitation Services. CARF assists providers in improving the quality of their services by applying sets of quality standards during a consultative on-site survey.\n\nWhat are the benefits of being CARF accredited?\n\nThe benefits of conformance to the CARF standards can be realized by both the organization and its persons served.\n\nFor the organization, CARF accreditation is a catalyst for continuous quality improvement. CARF surveyors apply a consultative, rather than inspective, approach. They bring with them not only their own wisdom, but also the experience of similar organizations to promote quality within the industry.\n\nFor the consumer, choosing a CARF-accredited program or service can provide confidence that an organization is consumer focused and has met international standards for service delivery.\n\nFor more information about CARF International, the standards, or the survey process, visit www.carf.org.\n\nPATH LEADERS\n\nJennifer Hark Dietz\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nJennifer Hark Dietz, LCSW\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nA 15-year advocate in homelessness, Veterans, and mental health services, Jennifer leads PATH’s strategic direction, business management, and person-centered efforts across California.
