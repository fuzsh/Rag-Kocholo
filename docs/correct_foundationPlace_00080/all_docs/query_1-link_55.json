        "text": "Assemblywoman, District 27\n\nAssemblywoman Esmeralda Soria was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 27th Assembly District which includes communities in Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties. Assemblywoman Soria serves as Chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee. She is also a member of the Banking and Finance, Business and Professions, Governmental Organization, and the Jobs, Economic Development, and the Economy committees.\n\nAssemblywoman Soria was born and raised in Lindsay, California. As a daughter of immigrant farmworkers who came to this country to pursue the American dream, Assemblywoman Soria knows firsthand about hard work, sacrifice, and service. Growing up in California’s Central Valley, she would join her family in the agricultural fields to work. She would continue to do so while completing her higher education at UC Berkeley and UC Davis Law School.\n\nBefore being elected Assemblywoman, she served her community as an educator, community advocate, and Fresno City Councilmember for eight years. Guided by her passion to give back to her community, then-Councilwoman Soria led efforts that increased public safety and economic development, created thousands of good-paying jobs, helped secure millions to build affordable and workforce housing, tackled homelessness, and secured funding for new parks. Then-Councilwoman Soria would also serve as the first Latina Council President for the fifth largest city in the state.\n\nIn her first year serving in the Legislature, Assemblywoman Soria hit the ground running delivering budget and policy wins for the constituents of Assembly District 27. She successfully secured over $442 million in community investments, and landed 6 bills on the Governor’s desk which were all signed into law. Her signed legislation supports hospitals, removes roadblocks to access higher education, and supports our veterans.\n\nWhen Madera Community Hospital closed a couple weeks after her swearing-in, Assemblywoman Soria immediately made this her top priority and has been working around the clock to ensure the hospital reopens its doors to the community. She wrote AB 112, which created the Distressed Hospital Loan Program to provide immediate assistance to not only Madera Community Hospital but to other hospitals across the state struggling financially to stay open and provide vital healthcare services. The bill was signed by Governor Newsom and Madera Community Hospital was awarded $52 million in state support to assist in the process of reopening and restoring community access to vital healthcare services.\n\nAssemblywoman Soria is committed to fighting and delivering real results for the residents of the Central Valley. In and around the Capitol, Esmeralda Soria is known for being relentless in making sure the Central Valley gets its fair share of resources."
