        "text": "The Central Artery/Tunnel Project was the largest, most challenging highway project in the history of the United States. It reduced traffic and improved mobility in one of America's oldest, most congested major cities. It built a framework for continued growth in Massachusetts and New England. Additionally, it improved the local environment.\n\nThe project replaced Boston's deteriorating six-lane elevated Central Artery (I-93). It did so with an underground highway that is state of the art and two new bridges over the Charles River. It also extended I-90 to Boston's Logan International Airport, and Route 1A. This project created more than 300 acres of open land while reconnecting downtown Boston to the waterfront.\n\nWhen planning for the CA/T Project began in 1982, experts could not have predicted the challenges that lay ahead from design to construction. Congress approved federal funding and the project's basic scope in April 1987.\n\nConstruction began in September 1991 on a bypass road through South Boston. This took truck traffic off neighborhood streets. A third tunnel to cross Boston Harbor was also begun. The first major milestone was the opening of the tunnel. Named for baseball legend Ted Williams, majority completion occurred January 13, 2006. Three major milestone openings took place in 2003.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts had a world-class traffic problem called the Central Artery. The Central Artery was an elevated highway running through the center of downtown. When it opened in 1959, the Central Artery carried about 75,000 vehicles a day. In the early 1990s it carried upwards of 200,000 making it one of the most congested highways in the United States.\n\nTraffic crawled for more than 10 hours each day. The accident rate on the Central Artery was four times the national average. The two tunnels between downtown Boston and East Boston/Logan Airport had the same issue. Without major improvements, Boston expected a traffic jam for up to 16 hours a day by 2010.\n\nThe annual cost to motorists from this congestion was an estimated $500 million. Costs included a high accident rate, wasted fuel from traffic, and late deliveries.\n\nAnd traffic wasn't the only problem the old Central Artery caused in Boston. The elevated highway displaced 20,000 residents. It also cut off the North End and Waterfront neighborhoods from downtown. This limited these areas' ability to take part in the city's economic life.\n\nPutting this underground was one of the more challenging infrastructure projects ever in the United States. The project spanned 7.8 miles of highway, 161 lanes miles in all, about half in tunnels. In total, the CA/T placed 3.8 million cubic yards of concrete. This is equal to 2,350 acres, one foot thick. It also excavated more than 16 million cubic yards of soil. The larger of the two Charles River bridges is a ten-lane cable-stayed hybrid bridge named the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge. It is the widest ever built and the first to use an asymmetrical design.\n\nThe project also included four major highway interchanges. These connect the new roadways with the existing regional highway system. At Logan Airport, a new interchange moves traffic from I-90 and Route 1A, as well as onto the airport road system. In South Boston, another takes traffic between I-90 and the waterfront and convention center area. At the northern limit, a new interchange connects I-93 to the Tobin Bridge, Storrow Drive, and the new underground highway.\n\nAt the southern end of the underground highway, the interchange between I-90 and I-93 was completely rebuilt. On six levels, these connect with the underground Central Artery and the Turnpike extension through South Boston. The interchange carries a total of 28 routes. These include High Occupancy Vehicle lanes, and channel traffic to and from Logan Airport to the east. A fifth interchange, at Massachusetts Avenue on I-93, has been rebuilt by the project.\n\nThe Central Artery/Tunnel Project was public works on a scale comparable to some of the great projects of the last century. Projects like the Panama Canal, the English Channel Tunnel (the \"Chunnel\") and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Each of these projects presented unique challenges. The Panama Canal confronted earth-slides, malaria, yellow fever, and Central American jungles. The Chunnel was dug from either end, 31 miles apart, meeting at a precise point under the channel floor. The Alaska Pipeline contended with vast distances, freezing temperatures, and major environmental concerns.\n\nThe Central Artery Project had a unique challenge: to construct this project in the middle of Boston without crippling the city. Work of the CA/T Project's scope was never before attempted in the heart of an urban area. Unlike any other major highway project, the CA/T worked to maintain traffic capacity and access to residents and businesses. Keeping the city open for business throughout construction was a priority. When the interstates were first built, projects gave very little thought to the communities in the path of the new roads. Disruption and dislocation were the rule of the day.\n\nFailure to maintain the state of Boston's economy during the project would damage our competitive position for years. With that in mind, project planners worked with many organizations, groups, and leaders to create consensus on how to build the project. The process of keeping the city open and making certain that everyone sees fair treatment is mitigation. Mitigation efforts were responsible for more than a fourth of the project's budget."
