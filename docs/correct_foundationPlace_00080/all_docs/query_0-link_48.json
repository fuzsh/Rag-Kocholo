        "text": "The Dallas Opera Announces the 2017 Reunion for\n\nThe Linda and Mitch Hart Institute for Women Conductors\n\n~~~~\n\nInstitute Fellows to Meet at San Francisco Opera\n\nNext Week for Annual Reunion, April 12-13, 2017\n\n~~~~\n\nSeminars and Master Classes, Including Work with Members of the Distinguished\n\nAdler Fellowship Program at San Francisco Opera\n\n~~~~\n\nAdditional Support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\n\nAnd the Richard and Enika Schulze Foundation\n\nDALLAS, APRIL 4, 2017 – In connection with its twenty-year commitment to address a long-standing gender imbalance at podiums throughout the opera world, The Dallas Opera is delighted to announce that this year’s annual reunion of the Fellows of the Linda and Mitch Hart Institute for Women Conductors at The Dallas Opera will take place at the famed War Memorial in San Francisco, California, in partnership with the San Francisco Opera.\n\nWomen conductors who participated in the first two residencies are eligible to attend this year’s reunion, April 12 and 13th. The intensive two-day workshop will feature career enhancement seminars from San Francisco Opera General Director Matthew Shilvock, Dallas Opera General Director and CEO Keith Cerny, and Sheri Greenawald, Artistic Director of the Merola Opera Program and Director of the San Francisco Opera Center.\n\n“In thinking about how the conductors could get the most out of our annual reunions,” explained Keith Cerny, the Kern Wildenthal General Director and CEO of The Dallas Opera, “it occurred to me that moving it from one music capital to another would allow the Hart Institute Fellows to meet and work with artistic staff and administrators from the most influential organizations in our field.\n\n“San Francisco Opera is an internationally-recognized leader in the world of opera,” Cerny adds, “so we were especially pleased to receive an enthusiastic response to our overtures. I’m certain the Hart Fellows will greatly benefit from this experience.”\n\nIn addition to high-level discussions and focused seminars with opera leaders, the conductors will engage in hands-on master classes with The Dallas Opera’s Martha R. and Preston A. Peak Principal Guest Conductor (and co-founder and artistic director of San Francisco’s Opera Parallèle) Nicole Paiement, as well as San Francisco Opera Chorus Master Ian Robertson.\n\nThese master classes will also benefit from the participation of some of the finest young opera singers at work in the field today: Adler Fellows selected from the renowned Merola Opera Program at San Francisco Opera.\n\nSan Francisco Opera General Director Matthew Shilvock said, “We’re delighted to welcome Dallas Opera and the Hart Institute for Women Conductors to San Francisco Opera for a collaborative venture with the Adler Fellows of the San Francisco Opera Center. The Institute is charting a dynamic and critical path forward, enriching the whole field by nurturing a talented group of conductors. We are honored to be a part of this year’s program.”\n\nThe following conductors will be traveling to San Francisco next week, to take part in the 2017 Hart Institute Reunion:\n\nElizabeth Askren (U.S.)\n\nNatalie Murray Beale (U.K.)\n\nMihaela Cesa-Goje (Romania)\n\nAlexandra Cravero (France)\n\nJessica Gethin (Australia)\n\nStephanie Rhodes (U.S.)\n\nAnna Skryleva (Russia/Germany)\n\nChaowen Ting (U.S./Taiwan)\n\nLidiya Yankovskaya (U.S./Russia)\n\nZoe Zeniodi (Greece)\n\nThe Linda and Mitch Hart Institute for Women Conductors will meet again for its third residency on November 6, 2017 through November 18, 2017 in Dallas, Texas. This year’s institute will include two public concerts (on November 11th and November 18th) in addition to intensive one-on-one’s, master classes, career advancement curriculum, and opportunities to conduct the highly regarded Dallas Opera Orchestra.\n\nThe institute, conceived by Dallas Opera General Director and CEO Keith Cerny, was created with initial support from the Richard and Enika Schulze Foundation.\n\nSince that time, it has garnered additional generous support from Linda and Mitch Hart and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nMr. Cerny noted: “The Dallas Opera has demonstrated, in multiple ways, its unshakable commitment to reshaping the opera field through the use of innovative public outreach, and by exploring new technologies, commissioning new works to expand the operatic repertoire, and programming with passion and imagination.\n\n“This much-needed program, generously supported by benefactors here in Dallas and elsewhere,” Mr. Cerny adds, “will enable more women conductors to add their talents and insights to our collective understanding of this phenomenal art form.”\n\n~~~~\n\nThe tremendous success of the first two institute sessions has been recognized by music lovers, opera VIPs and the national media, earning a feature in Opera News magazine (published by the Metropolitan Opera Guild), as well as a segment on PBS NewsHour seen across the U.S.\n\nThe Dallas Opera is providing the Institute Fellows attending this reunion with a travel stipend and in-town housing. Most meals will be provided, as well.\n\nThere is also the potential for one or more participants to be invited back to Dallas to serve as Assistant Conductors or Guest Conductors on future Dallas Opera productions.\n\n~~~~\n\nMarc A. Scorca, President and CEO of OPERA America, remarked: “The Dallas Opera continues to expand its influence and stature among American opera companies, as shown by this exciting new initiative. The company is to be applauded for taking a significant step to remedy the existing gender imbalance on the podium. This effort complements OPERA America’s support of the work of female opera composers and promises to enrich the art form by encouraging more gifted artists to express themselves through opera.”\n\n~~~~\n\nABOUT SAN FRANCISCO OPERA CENTER\n\nSan Francisco Opera Center was created in 1982 to oversee the Company’s artist training programs established by former general director Kurt Herbert Adler. Today, the San Francisco Opera Center encourages young artists with major operatic potential to develop and flourish through intensive training, study and performance.
