Woody Allen has unveiled Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg as the lead roles for his upcoming untitled picture, which is set to begin filming in Los Angeles and New York next month. The cast of the film also include Jeannie Berlin, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott and Bruce Willis; and co-stars Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider. The new Allen picture will be produced by long-time collaborators Letty Aronson, Steve Tenenbaum and Edward Walson.

The setting of this movie comes as a surprise, following Allen’s pledge not to film in New York City anymore due to expenses, backed up by his last few movies which have been set in Rhode Island, France and San Francisco, including films such as Irrational Man, Magic in the Moonlight and Blue Jasmine. In addition to this, Allen hasn’t shot a film in Los Angeles since his 1977 hit film Annie Hall. No further information, including a potential release date, has been released regarding the new Allen picture.
