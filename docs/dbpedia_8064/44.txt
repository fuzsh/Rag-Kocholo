Los Angeles - Kristen Stewart is to appear alongside an all-star cast in Woody Allen's untitled 2016 movie.

The 25-year-old actress, who's best known for her performances in the Twilight franchise, is to star alongside some of Hollywood's biggest names, such as Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively and Bruce Willis, in the eagerly-awaited project from the acclaimed director.

The movie will mark Allen's return to New York City, where he was born and where he's shot most of his movies.

What's more, the movie will see Allen reunite with Eisenberg, having previously collaborated on the 2012 comedy To Rome With Love.

News of the movie's cast comes shortly after Woody's former lover and Annie Hall co-star Diane Keaton described the award-winning director as a "miracle".

She said: "He's really astonishing. He's one of the most astonishing people in showbusiness, ever. He's had more power over his movies than anyone for a longer amount of time than anyone. He's a miracle."

Diane said Woody is much more resilient than most people realise.
