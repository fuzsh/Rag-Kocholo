Kristen Stewart walks alongside co-star Jesse Eisenberg while filming new scenes for the untitled Woody Allen movie on Wednesday afternoon (August 26) in Malibu, Calif.

The 25-year-old and 31-year-old actors were seen walking along the sand on a romantic outing, dressed in their 1950s era ensembles before they headed back to dry land where Kristen lit up by the sight of her dog.

While heading back to base camp, Woody slipped on the beach rocks and fell. But it looks like heâ€™s alright.
