        "text": "Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg join the cast of Woody Allen’s “Irrational Man.”\n\nKristen Stewart will be reunited with “Adventureland” star Jesse Eisenberg in Woody Allen’s next film, “Irrational Man.” According to IndieWire, “Die Hard” star Bruce Willis will be joining the cast as well.\n\n“Adventureland” duo Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, who recently teamed up again on the forthcoming “American Ultra,” are once again joining forces for Allen’s next flick. Also aboard is Bruce Willis.\n\nWhile there is currently not much to know about this Woody Allen film, we do know that “Irrational Man” is building quite the cast list. Alongside the mentioned members above, the film also stars Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone.\n\nWithin the past five years, many of Woody Allen’s films have been extremely hit or miss. Both “Midnight in Paris” and “Blue Jasmine” were highly regarded Oscar nominated films yet films like “Magic in the Moonlight” and “To Rome With Love” were poorly reviewed by a majority of critics. Interesting enough, both Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg were cast members in those latter two films which bombed and are now getting a second chance in “Irrational Man.”\n\nKristen Stewart will make her Woody Allen debut in this film which says a lot about the direction in which she is driving her career. With films like “Irrational Man,” Camp X-Ray, and a role in “Still Alice,” Stewart is making a strong attempt to distance herself from her Twilight years. Attaching herself to these types of films is a very smart move for her if she wants to be taken seriously. We’ve seen other actors make this kind of move in the past and in the end it paid out with either an Oscar nomination or win. But for now we can only speculate as to whether “Irrational Man” will be the prestigious gem Stewart is looking for or a Woody Allen flop that continues to halt the diversification of her career.\n\nWhat do you think of Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg reuniting in “Irrational Man?”\n\nRyan\n\nRyan has been fascinated with film and pop culture since childhood. Throughout college he \"played it safe\" taking the more lucrative route of being a computer programmer while squeezing in film related courses where he could...but even during his post college career, he could never escape his true passion. After following one of his favorite blogs for a long time, he approached the site's Editor about writing and they reluctantly gave him a shot. He later became their Senior Writer which led to a variety of other projects, radio show appearances, features, and high profile celebrity interviews. Despite his success with blogging, he still wanted more so in order to expand his creative addiction, he merged his IT skills and blogging know-how to create FilmFad.com which has continued to grow into a creative Mecca of pop-culture fun and integrity.
