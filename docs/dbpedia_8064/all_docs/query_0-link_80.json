        "text": "Kristen Stewart has opened up about her reluctance to work with director Woody Allen.\n\nKristen is starring in Allen's latest film, Cafe Society, which will debut at Cannes Film Festival this week.\n\nThe brunette actress said she hesitated about working with the award-winning director and discussed it with co-star Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nShe told Variety: \"I was like, 'What do you think? We don’t know any of these people involved. I can personalize situations, which would be very wrong.'\n\n\"At the end of the day, Jesse and I talked about this. If we were persecuted for the amount of s*** that’s been said about us that’s not true, our lives would be over.\"\n\nAllen's adopted daughter Dylan claimed he sexually abused her when she was seven - claims he always denied.\n\nThe case was dropped in 1993 after a seven-month probe, but allegations were repeated in 2014 in an open letter published by the New York Times blog, in which Emma Stone and Scarlett Johansson were criticised for supporting his work.\n\nAllen vehemently denied the claims calling them \"untrue and disgraceful\" in his own response in the same paper.\n\nKristen added: \"The experience of making the movie was so outside of that, it was fruitful for the two of us to go on with it.\"\n\nIn Cafe Society Jesse plays a young 1930s New Yorker who moves to Hollywood to find work, while Kristen is a secretary torn between two men.\n\nOn casting Kristen, Allen said: \"She’s very young, very beautiful and talented. And if she just keeps her hand on the wheel and makes good decisions, she’s home free. She should have an incredible career.\""
