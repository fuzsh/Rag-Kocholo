        "text": "Woody Allen has apparently gotten over his regrets about signing up with Amazon for his first TV series, as he's now sold his latest feature film to the digital service.\n\nThe company has acquired North American theatrical and streaming rights to Allen's new, as-yet-untitled romantic comedy starring Kristen Stewart, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg and Blake Lively. Principal photography concluded last summer in New York.\n\nWoody Allen signs with Amazon to create his first-ever TV series\n\nAccording to the deal, Amazon will release the film in theaters briefly this summer before making it available to stream for Amazon Prime subscribers, mimicking the successful roll-out they engineered last year for Spike Lee's \"Chi-Raq.\"\n\nMiley Cyrus to star in Woody Allen's Amazon series\n\n\"Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection, and genuine goodwill,\" Allen said in a press release. \"The lawsuits come later.\""
