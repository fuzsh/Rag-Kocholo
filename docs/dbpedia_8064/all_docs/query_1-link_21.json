        "text": "Woody Allen is casting Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg and Bruce Willis in his next movie, which is expected to shoot this summer, an individual familiar with the project has told TheWrap.\n\nThe film doesn’t have a title yet, but it will be produced by Allen’s usual collaborators, Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson.\n\nPlot details remain as mysterious as a Manhattan murder, though it will be the third feature starring Eisenberg and Stewart, who previously worked together on “Adventureland” and Nima Nourizadeh’s upcoming “American Ultra.”\n\nEisenberg, who makes a great stand-in for Allen, previously worked with the director on “To Rome With Love.”\n\nAllen’s next movie, “Irrational Man,” stars Joaquin Phoenix as a professor who strikes up a relationship with a student, played by Emma Stone.\n\nThe director’s go-to distributor Sony Pictures Classics will release the film on July 24.\n\nDeadline broke the news."
