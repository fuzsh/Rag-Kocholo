        "text": "Los Angeles, June 22 (IANS) Actress Kate Winslet is reportedly in final talks to star in filmmaker Woody Allen’s latest movie. Allen is writing, directing and producing the untitled film, and like all his recent films, plot details are being heavily guarded, reports variety.com.\n\nLetty Aronson and Edward Walson will serve as producers. Though Winslet’s career has spanned more than two decades, the actress has never worked with the auteur prior to this pic. She is coming off her Oscar-nominated role in “Steve Jobs” and was also recently seen in Open Road’s crime drama “Triple Nine”. She just wrapped production on New Line’s “Collateral Beauty” opposite Will Smith and recently boarded the Fox drama “The Mountain Between Us”, co-starring Idris Elba. Meanwhile, Allen’s latest film “Cafe Society”, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, bowed at the recently held Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe Morung Express\n\nThe Morung Express is a people-oriented alternative newspaper based in Nagaland that was conceived from the Naga people’s historical realities and is guided by their voices and experiences. It emerged from the well-recognized concept that the core of a free press is based on “qualitative and investigative” journalism. Ensuring this is essential for contributing to an informed Naga public that makes sound decisions on issues that affect all spheres of life."
