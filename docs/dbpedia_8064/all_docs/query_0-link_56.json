        "text": "Big gig! Kristen Stewart has booked a role in Woody Allen's next movie, Deadline reports.\n\nThe Twilight actress, 24, will star in the currently untitled project alongside Bruce Willis and Jesse Eisenberg, a source close to the project confirms to Us Weekly. There has been no official word on the upcoming flick, which is still in its earliest stages of production.\n\nThe star-studded movie is just the latest installment in Allen's busy schedule. The filmmaker, 79, made a deal with Amazon earlier this year for a TV series, and will release his new movie Irrational Man, which stars Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix, this July.\n\nStewart will continue her recent turn to more serious roles with the Allen project, a path she has been on since the wrap of the Twilight series and the 2012 release of the scandal-filled Snow White and the Huntsman. In the years since, she has gravitated toward indies and dramas with the Oscar-winning Still Alice and won France's Cesar Award for her part in the celebrated Clouds of Sils Maria.\n\nAfter his Oscar-nominated turn in The Social Network, Eisenberg, 31, diversified with roles in 2013's Now You See Me, the upcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and a part in a 2012 Allen film, To Rome With Love. He previously appeared with Stewart in 2009's Adventureland.\n\nWillis, 59, finds the project amidst ongoing film roles, including parts in the recently released Vice and the upcoming features Rock the Kasbah, Wake, and Extraction."
