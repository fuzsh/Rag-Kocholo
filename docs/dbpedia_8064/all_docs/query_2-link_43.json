        "text": "Topline\n\nWoody Allen—who has been accused by his adopted daughter Dylan of sexually assaulting her when she was a child, which he denies—said Tuesday he plans to make at least one more film, though several A-list actors have said they regret working with him, in an interview on Instagram with Alec Baldwin.\n\nKey Facts\n\nTangent\n\nBaldwin has appeared in several of Allen’s films: Alice (1990), which also starred Mia Farrow, To Rome With Love (2012) and Blue Jasmine (2013). Baldwin has been one of Allen’s few Hollywood defenders. When announcing the interview, Baldwin wrote he “COULD NOT CARE LESS about anyone else’s speculation,” and “if you believe that a trial should be conducted by way of an HBO documentary, that’s your issue,” referring to the network’s 2021 feature about the abuse claims against Allen.\n\nKey Background\n\nAllen and Mia Farrow began dating in 1979, and in 1985 the actress adopted Dylan. Dylan Farrow alleged that in 1992 when she was 7-years-old, Allen took her to a crawl space in the family’s Connecticut home and assaulted her. After a babysitter discovered Allen in a suspicious position with Dylan, Dylan told her mom about what happened. Allen was the subject of an investigation from Connecticut State Police and in 1994, a state attorney said while there was “probable cause” to prosecute the director, he declined to do so in order to save Dylan from having to experience a trial. Allen has maintained that the allegations are false. Much of the couple’s custody battle over children Dylan, Moses and Ronan Farrow—who is now a prominent investigative journalist—focused on the claims of abuse. It was questioned as to whether Mia coached Dylan to make the claims against Allen. In 1992, Mia Farrow discovered nude photos of her adopted 21-year-old daughter Soon-Yi Previn, and Allen later announced the two were in a relationship. Previn and Allen married in 1997. In 2013 and 2014, Dylan Farrow recounted her story to Vanity Fair and the New York Times and has continued to be vocal about it. Amid the #MeToo movement—which Ronan Farrow’s investigative work helped spur—Allen experienced major fallout and increased scrutiny over the abuse allegations.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWoody Allen, Mia Farrow, Soon-Yi Previn, Dylan Farrow: A Timeline (New York Times)\n\nEvery actor who has publicly expressed regret for working with Woody Allen, so far (Vox)"
