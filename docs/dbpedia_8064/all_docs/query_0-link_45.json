        "text": "Kristen Stewart is the type of star that just transcends generations.\n\nA point that the Twilight sensation proved when she was spotted going old school on the set of Woody Allen's new movie in Beverly Hills on Friday.\n\nThe brunette beauty, who was the 10th highest-paid actress in 2014, transformed into a 50s fittie as she filmed scenes alongside Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nDetails of the project are still be kept underwraps - including the name - but looking at Kristen's outfit it appears that the flick is set in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe 25-year-old was spotted wearing a retro wardrobe consisting of a pink blouse tied-up around her stomach and a white skirt.\n\nShe teamed the threads with a pair of beige sandals, while white socks were pulled up well above her ankles.\n\nMeanwhile co-star Jesse wore a similarly vintage outfit as got kitted up in a classic brown suit\n\nKristen appeared to be getting along swimmingly with the male lead as they received instructions from director Woody.\n\nTheir chemistry should come as no surprise since the pair have worked together in the past, most recently on American Ultra which hit cinemas on Friday.\n\nKristen is slowly moving away from her role as Bella Swan on Twilight as her movie career goes from strength to strength.\n\nThe film star went some length to changing the public's perception of her when she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last week.\n\nKristen really let her hair down for the interview as she laughed and played games with the host."
