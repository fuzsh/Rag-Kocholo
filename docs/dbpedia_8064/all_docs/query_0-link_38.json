        "text": "Woody Allen's newest project may be in its very early stages, but it already has a star-studded cast attached.\n\nThe director's camp confirms to E! News that his upcoming film will star Kristen Stewart, Bruce Willis and Jesse Eisenberg. This will be the first Allen film for K.Stew and Willis, and the second for her Adventureland co-star, Eisenberg, who starred in his 2012 comedy To Rome with Love.\n\nUnfortunately, that's all the information we get for now, because that's how it is with Woody Allen movies.\n\nNo plot details for the untitled movie have been released as of yet, but Deadline, who first reported on the casting, says Allen's flick will be produced by his usual collaborators Letty Arsonson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson.\n\nStewart's casting news comes on the heels of winning Best Supporting Actress at the 40th CÃ©sar Film Awards for her role in the psychological drama Clouds of Sils Maria, becoming the first American actress to win France's equivalent of an Oscar. Her nomination alone made her the first American woman to be in the running for the honor in 30 years.\n\nPerhaps that incredible feat, or just the mere fact that a Woody Allen movie was offered to her, has changed Kristen's mind about taking a break from Hollywood.\n\nDuring a stop on Live! With Kelly and Michael recently, the former Twilight star explained that she's been enjoying taking a step away from the spotlight to relax and focus on other hobbies.\n\nK.Stew admitted that after working \"for a solid two years\" she just wants to keep a low profile. \"I need to breathe,\" she shared, before hesitating about divulging exactly what she would be doing on her time off.\n\nLooks like those activities, whatever they may be, will need to be put on hold just a tiny bit longer."
