        "text": "It's Vicky Cristina Barcelona\n\nThe latest Untitled Woody Allen Spanish Project is untitled no longer - his next film will be called Vicky Cristina Barcelona. No prizes at all for guessing where it's set.\n\nDescribed as a \"love letter to Barcelona\" (poor New York is probably crying its eyes out at Allen's defection), the film stars the not-unattractive combo of Scarlett Johansson, Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem. And that's all we know - you weren't seriously expecting plot details on a Woody Allen film before release, were you?)\n\nWe're thinking neurotic rom-com, but who knows? It could be a tragic crime thriller. As long as it's better than Scoop, we'll be happy. So what's your guess? Given the cast and the city it's set in, can you figure out the plot?\n\nJust so you know, whilst we may receive a commission or other compensation from the links on this website, we never allow this to influence product selections - read why you should trust us"
