        "text": "She's way too moody to be Princess Diana. Also, Kristen Stewart has a blank stare in comparison to Diana, and doesn't seem warm enough to be \"the people's princess\".\n\nNaomi Watts wasn't much good either.\n\nI think the best actress to play her was Catherine Oxenberg. But that was a young Diana when she was just 20 and becoming princess.\n\nShe actually played Diana twice.\n\nHaving grown up while Diana was princess of Wales and having been 18 when she was killed , I'm biased in terms of whether Stewart is the right choice.\n\nI suspect the film isn't so much going to be aimed at Gen X guys like me who remember Diana clearly, but aimed more at younger generations who know more about Harry and Meg more than about Charles and Dia.\n\nI guess it really depends on what type of Diana she's playing in the script. What is the Diana Spencer characterization they're going for? Are they highlighting one facet of Diana over others?\n\nPutting those questions aside, I will say that Diana , for all of her troubles and personal struggles, did exude warmth and a charisma in public.\n\nKristen Stewart really hasn't exuded either in other roles I've seen her in, and if anything, has seemed cold, distant, and aloof .\n\nBut then again, alot of this film maybe more of the Diana struggling with her inner demons so alot of it may play more on Stewart's strengths as an actress.\n\nI'm not gonna dismiss the idea of her casting but I can understand why folks are taken aback.\n\nI don't know how many actresses have really nailed Diana who have played her before. Some of them sometimes looked too old, even when they weren't that old themselves. Others look like they have a bad wig on. I know Serena Scott Thomas played her before, but she also didn't get it quite right.\n\nNaomi Watts had the hair completely wrong and somehow managed to look more like a young Theresa May than Princess Di.\n\nI think part of why Catherine Oxenberg worked was a) because she had an innocent face and very British accent and captured that charm and b) because it was actually filmed at the time of when the Princess Di haircut was really popular everywhere and hairdressers were doing that style. Now, hairdressers have to go from photographs and aren't used to doing it. The ones now look overly permed.\n\nPrincess Di overly permed her hair anyway later on, whereas her early haircut from the start of her time as princess was more straight and not so dated in the 80s."
