        "text": "Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg will star in Woody Allen's next movie, set to shoot in Rome.\n\nThe as-yet-untitled film already has Alec Baldwin and Penelope Cruz on the cast list. As is typical for Allen's recent output, there's no word on a plot yet.\n\nWhile there's no doubt that the director's recent movies haven't been hitting the highs of his glory days, this cast alone is enough to pique our interest and have us crossing our fingers, quietly chanting \"Please be a return to form, please be a return to formâ€¦\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine any young actor better equipped to play Woody's neurotic screen cypher than Eisenberg, and Page's offbeat sense of humour should bring a burst of freshness to the proceedings.\n\nBaldwin has been enjoying a comedic career revival recently, stoked in no small part by his role on 30 Rock , and Cruz won an Oscar for her crackling turn in Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona .\n\nThe film is set to shoot this summer, in keeping with Allen's regular-as-clockwork production process and recent fondness for European locations."
