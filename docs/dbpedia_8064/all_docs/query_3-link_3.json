        "text": "Woody Allen never stops working. For the latest case in point, consider the news from Variety that Kate Winslet is set to star in his next film despite the fact that “Café Society” has yet to be released. Somewhat remarkably for the prolific, ensemble-friendly writer/director, Allen has never worked with Winslet before.\n\nREAD MORE: Cannes Review: Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg Freshen a Familiar Woody Allen Formula in ‘Cafe Society’\n\nOther than the fact that it’s slated to begin production this fall, few other concrete details are available as of yet: The film has no title, premise, release date or other casting news. Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her performance in “Steve Jobs” and more recently appeared in John Hillcoat’s crime thriller “Triple 9.”\n\nREAD MORE: Woody Allen, Mel Gibson & More Maligned Auteurs: How to Justify Watching Their Films (Or Not)\n\nAs per custom, Allen will write, direct and produce the untitled film. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart star in “Café Society,” the 1930s period piece that opened the Cannes Film Festival last month and garnered lukewarm reviews. Amazon Studios is releasing that film on July 14.."
