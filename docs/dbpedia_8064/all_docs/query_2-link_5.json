        "text": "General audiences still have to wait until July 15 to see Woody Allen‘s new movie “Café Society,” but, per usual, the director isn’t wasting anytime in getting together his next movie. Joining previously announced cast members Kate Winslet and Jim Belushi are Justin Timberlake and Juno Temple, which makes the movie’s ensemble primarily newbies to Allen’s filmography. The new film begins shooting this fall in New York and is rumored to be a 1950s-set period drama.\n\nREAD MORE: Woody Allen, Mel Gibson & More Maligned Auteurs: How to Justify Watching Their Films (Or Not)\n\nThe film will take Timberlake back to the past following his role in the Coen Brothers’ “Inside Llewyn Davis.” He voices the lead character opposite Anna Kendrick in DreamWorks Animation’s “Trolls,” which hits theaters November 4. Temple, meanwhile, earned some of the best reviews of her career for her turn in HBO’s rock n’ roll drama “Vinyl.” The show was renewed for a second season, but HBO recently cancelled it after months of struggling ratings and poor reviews for the show overall.\n\nIn addition to “Café Society,” which stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, Allen is also working on a television series for Amazon. The show, starring the likes of Miley Cyrus and Elaine May, is currently in post-production. No release date has been set."
