        "text": "My review of it from back in October when I saw it. Basically, we align, but I thought a bit more of it than you did, but not that much more.\n\nLast night we watched Woody Allen's \"Cafe Society.\" The period details are outstanding as the movie abounds in eye candy for Fedora Lounge member that is stunning and keeps coming at you from houses, cars, clothes, appliances and on and on. The movie looks more 1930s than the actual 1930s as the set designers created a visually perfect world versus reality's imperfect one.\n\nThe movie itself seems like Woody Allen has consciously and quietly decided to parody himself as the picture feels like someone trying to make a Woody Allen film: the male lead is a young, insecure Jewish man who talks out loud to himself about his eight billion insecurities while pursuing a beautiful Christian woman. All the characters - the successful talent agent, the up-from-the-street mobster, the overbearing Jewish mother - feel like intentional parodies, archetypes you've seen in countless Allen movies that don't even take themselves 100% seriously.\n\nBut here's the thing - it basically works. You know you are watching a Woody Allen film that isn't taking itself too seriously, but you wind up caring, lightheartedly, about the characters and their challenges and you end up rooting for this one or that. Also slightly surprisingly, the usually brooding Kristen Stewart plays against type and is charming and unsure of herself in a refreshing and attractive way - the first time I \"got\" her as an actress. She and the underused-in-this-move Blake Lively bring more realism than the other actors who Allen wrote in the mode of the aforementioned parody.\n\nIf you go into this picture with modest expectations - you want to see a decent \"Woody Allen\" movie with absolutely beautiful 1930s period details - you'll enjoy it. If you are looking for something fresh or revolutionary from Allen, you won't.\n\nI will see it when it hits cable, and be disappointed.\n\nHe's reached the point where he only makes a good, or near-good, film every third time out. For every worthwhile Midnight In Paris or Blue Jasmine, you have to sit through a couple of Irrational Mans, Magic in the Moonlights, or To Rome With Loves. I wish he'd stop making a film every year already, and just concentrate on making that better one every second or third year.\n\nBut I've been following his career closely since the early seventies, and I can't look away.\n\nWe had this for three days in September, and I loved it, for exactly the reasons Fading mentions -- it refused at any point in the proceedings to take itself seriously. I've had it up to the neck with Films out to make profound ARRRRRRRRRTistic statements -- give me something that's just out to have fun for an hour and a half. I enjoy Allen's use of stereotypes because it comes across to me as his way of saying LOOSEN UP ALREADY IT'S JUST A DAMN MOVIE. AND WOULD IT KILL YOU TO GO GET SOME POPCORN ALREADY? I'm so sick of ARRRRRRRRRRT in general I'm going to run down in the street the next artist I see, so the more pictures like this that come out the better.\n\nOur audience, by the way, agrees. Did a rush business the whole three days, and people were sore we couldn't hold it over.\n\nWe had this for three days in September, and I loved it, for exactly the reasons Fading mentions -- it refused at any point in the proceedings to take itself seriously.
