        "text": "American actress (born 1990)\n\nKristen Jaymes Stewart (born April 9, 1990) is an American actress. She has received various accolades, including a British Academy Film Award and a César Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Stewart first gained notice at age 12 for her role as the daughter of Jodie Foster's character in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room (2002). After appearing in such films as Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005) and Into the Wild (2007), she achieved global stardom for starring as Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga film series (2008–2012). It ranks among the highest-grossing film franchises and earned Stewart the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2010.\n\nAfter starring in the fantasy film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Stewart preferred independent productions to big-budget films for a few years. These included the dramas Camp X-Ray (2014), Still Alice (2014), and Equals (2016). She was acclaimed for her performance in Olivier Assayas' drama film Clouds of Sils Maria (2014), which won her the César Award for Best Supporting Actress. She reunited with Assayas in the supernatural thriller Personal Shopper (2016) and made her directorial debut with the short film Come Swim (2017).\n\nStewart returned to mainstream Hollywood with leading roles in the action film Charlie's Angels (2019) and the romantic comedy Happiest Season (2020). Her portrayal of Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larraín's biographical drama Spencer (2021) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nEarly life\n\nStewart was born in Los Angeles, California on April 9, 1990.[1] Her father, John Stewart, is a stage manager and television producer, while her Australian-born mother,[2][3] Jules Mann-Stewart, is a script supervisor and filmmaker.[1][4] Jules, an Australian native raised in Maroochydore, Queensland, had studied at the University of Sydney before moving to Hollywood at the age of 16.[5] Jules was adopted by a Jewish couple in California, Norma and Ben Urman, in 1953; a DNA test showed that one of Kristen's biological maternal grandparents was Ashkenazi Jewish.[6][better source needed][dubious – discuss] Stewart has an older brother, Cameron B. Stewart, and two adopted brothers, Dana and Taylor.[7] In 2012, her mother filed for divorce after 27 years of marriage.[4] Stewart grew up in the San Fernando Valley.[1] She attended local schools until the seventh grade, and as she became more involved in acting, she continued her education by distance until graduating from high school.[8][9] Since she was raised in a family who work in the entertainment industry as non-actors, Stewart thought she would become a screenwriter or a director, but never considered being an actor, saying: \"I never wanted to be the center of attention—I wasn't that 'I want to be famous, I want to be an actor' kid. I never sought out acting, but I always practiced my autograph because I love pens. I'd write my name on everything.\"[10]\n\nCareer\n\nStewart began acting at age eight, after an agent saw her perform in her elementary school's Christmas play.[11] After auditioning for a year, she got her first role with a small, nonspeaking part in the Disney Channel television film The Thirteenth Year.[12] Her next film was The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, where she played the \"ring toss girl\".[12] She also appeared in the independent film The Safety of Objects (2001), as the tomboy daughter of a troubled single mother (Patricia Clarkson). Stewart also played the tomboy, diabetic daughter of a divorced mother (Jodie Foster) in the thriller film Panic Room (2002), directed by David Fincher. She was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her performance.[13] Following the success of Panic Room, Stewart was cast in another thriller, Cold Creek Manor (2003), playing the daughter of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone's characters and receiving a Young Artist Award nomination for her performance.[13] At this point in her career, she began homeschooling due to her irregular schedule.[citation needed]\n\nAt age fourteen, Stewart's first starring role was in the children's action-comedy Catch That Kid (2004), opposite Max Thieriot and Corbin Bleu. That year, Stewart also played the role of Lila in the thriller, Undertow (2004). Stewart starred in the Lifetime/Showtime television film Speak (2004), based on the novel by the same name by Laurie Halse Anderson. Stewart, aged thirteen at the time of filming, played Melinda Sordino, a high school freshman who nearly stops speaking after being raped. Her performance was widely praised, with The New York Times stating \"Ms. Stewart creates a convincing character full of pain and turmoil.\"[14] Stewart appeared in the fantasy-adventure film Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), playing the role of Lisa Budwing, the irresponsible older sister of two little boys. During their playing a board game, they turn their house into a spacecraft hurtling uncontrollably in outer space. The film was praised by critics, but Stewart's performance did not draw much media attention. Her character is immobilized during most of the film.[15] The following year, she played the character Maya in Fierce People (2006), directed by Griffin Dunne. After that film, she received the lead role of Jess Solomon in the supernatural thriller film The Messengers.\n\nStewart appeared as teenager Lucy Hardwicke in In the Land of Women (2007), a romantic drama starring Meg Ryan and Adam Brody. That same year, Stewart had a small role in the Sean Penn-directed adaptation Into the Wild, portraying Tracy—a teenage singer who has a crush on young adventurer Christopher McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch). While Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considered her work a \"sturdy, sensitive performance\", and the Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips noted that she did \"vividly well with a sketch of a role\", Variety critic Dennis Harvey said, \"It's unclear whether Stewart means to be playing hippie-chick Tracy as vapid, or whether it just comes off that way.\"[16][17][18] The film received Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. After Into the Wild, Stewart had a cameo appearance in Jumper and also appeared in What Just Happened, which was released in October 2008.[19] She co-starred in The Cake Eaters, an independent film that has been screened only at film festivals. The film received positive reviews.[20] Critic Bill Goodykoontz from The Arizona Republic said that Stewart \"really shines.... She excels at both aspects of the performance, giving Georgia a strength that defies any sort of pity one might feel for her, without letting us forget her vulnerability\".[21]\n\nOn November 16, 2007, Summit Entertainment announced that Stewart would play main character Bella Swan in the romantic fantasy film Twilight, based on Stephenie Meyer's novel of the same name.[22] Stewart was on the set of Adventureland when director Catherine Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen test, which \"captivated\" the director.[23] She starred alongside Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward Cullen, her vampire boyfriend. Stewart described her approach to the role as \"capturing ... that first awakening, that ownership of your body and desire\".[24] Twilight was released in the U.S. in November 2008.[25] On Stewart's performance, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly describing her as \"the ideal casting choice\" and praising her for conveying \"Bella's detachment, as well as her need to bust through it\", while Claudia Puig of USA Today criticized her acting for being \"wooden\" and lacking variety in her \"blank\" facial expressions.[26][27]\n\nShe received praise for her role in Adventureland (2009), a comedy-drama film written and directed by Greg Mottola, and co-starring Jesse Eisenberg. Critic James Berardinelli said, \"Stewart is more than merely appealing in this role – she makes Em a fully realized woman, and some of the most intricate development results from what the camera observes in Stewart's eyes.\"[28] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said Stewart was \"beautiful, enigmatic and very experienced\".[29] and MSN Movies' James Rocchi stated, \"Stewart's vulnerable, spooky power is used to nice effect.\"[30] Stewart reprised the role of Bella in a sequel to Twilight, titled New Moon. Jordan Mintzer from Variety called Stewart \"the heart and soul of the film\" and praised her for giving \"both weight and depth to dialogue...she makes Bella's psychological wounds seem like the real deal.\"[31] On the other hand, Manohla Dargis from The New York Times said Stewart's \"lonely-girl blues soon grow wearisome,\"[32] and Bill Goodykoontz from The Arizona Republic stated \"Stewart is a huge disappointment... She sucks the energy right out of the film\".[33] She reprised this role in a third film, Eclipse, which was released in June 2010.[34] Critics were warmer toward the film compared to its predecessors.[35]\n\nStewart starred in The Yellow Handkerchief, which debuted at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was released in theaters in 2010. She also starred alongside James Gandolfini in Welcome to the Rileys, which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. That same year, Stewart portrayed rock star Joan Jett in The Runaways, a biographical film of the titular band from writer-director Floria Sigismondi.[36] Stewart met with Jett to prepare for the role and prerecorded songs in a studio for the film.[37] Praising Stewart's performance, the Metro Times' Bill Holdship wrote, \"It turns out that Stewart is actually really good at capturing Jett's icy, tough-but-cool girl swagger, adding the needed touches of vulnerability that transform it into a pretty terrific performance... Stewart is a genuine rock star here.\"[38] Also, A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted a \"watchful and unassuming\" Stewart \"gives the movie its spine and soul.\"[39] At the 63rd British Academy Film Awards in February 2010, Stewart won the BAFTA Rising Star Award.[40]\n\nStewart topped Forbes' list of \"Hollywood's Best Actors for the Buck\" in 2011.[41] She was listed as the 13th highest-earning entertainment industry figure in Vanity Fair's \"Hollywood's Top 40\" list in the same year, with an estimated earning of $28.5 million for her film roles during the year.[42] Forbes also ranked her as the world's highest-paid actress in 2012, with total earnings of $34.5 million.[43] The fourth installment in the Twilight film series, Breaking Dawn – Part 1, was released on November 18, 2011. The Village Voice's Dan Konis said Stewart \"beautifully underplays\" the role,[44] while Emma Dibdin of Total Film described the relationship between Stewart and Pattinson's characters as \"like a sad, destructive charade\" despite the actors' chemistry.[45]\n\nOn December 6, 2011, Stewart was named number one on Forbes magazine's list of \"Hollywood's Best Actors for the Buck\".[41] On January 13, 2012, she became the face of a new unnamed Balenciaga perfume; in June, its name was promoted as \"Florabotanica\".[46] Stewart starred as Snow White in the film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012).[47] Stewart appears as Mary Lou in On the Road, the film adaptation of Jack Kerouac's novel of the same name.[48] She concluded the role of Bella Swan in Breaking Dawn – Part 2, released in November 2012. The film attracted a mixed critical response but found success during its box office run, grossing $830 million worldwide and becoming the 81st highest-grossing film.[49][50] The Twilight film series, dubbed The Twilight Saga, generated $3.32 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing film franchises.[51][52] According to Forbes, Stewart was the world's highest-paid actress in 2012, with total earnings of $34.5 million. She earned $12.5 million each for the last two installments in the Twilight series, including royalties.[43]\n\nOn December 11, 2013, Chanel announced Stewart as their \"new face\" for a Western-inspired fashion collection. The campaign was shot by Karl Lagerfeld and released online in May 2014.[53] In 2014, Balenciaga released a new fragrance, Rosabotanica, with Stewart remaining the face of the brand.[54] She was ranked No. 3 on Forbes' highest-paid actress in 2013, with a total earning of $22 million, #10 in 2014 with $12 million, and #9 in 2015 with $12 million. Camp X-Ray, her first film of 2014, premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 17.[55] While it generated mixed reviews from critics, Stewart's performance as a young soldier stationed at Guantanamo Bay detention camp received praise.[56] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"her best screen work to date [playing the role of] an inexperienced military guard\",[57] while Xan Brooks of The Guardian said, \"It's a role that reminds us what a fine performer she was in the likes of Into the Wild and Adventureland.\".[58] In 2014, she appeared in the music video for Jenny Lewis' \"Just One of The Guys\", and in The New York Times short movie 9 Kisses.\n\nStewart next starred alongside Juliette Binoche and Chloë Grace Moretz in Olivier Assayas' Clouds of Sils Maria. The film premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[59][60] Her performance in the film was critically acclaimed.[61][62] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that \"Stewart's habitual low-keyed style, which can border on the monotone, functions as effectively underplayed contrast.\"[63] Peter Debruge of Variety praised Stewart's \"spontaneous, agitated energy that makes her the most compellingly watchable American actress of her generation.\"[64] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described her portrayal as \"sharp and subtle, knowable and then suddenly distant\" and highlighted the \"brilliant lightness of touch\" in her approach to the film's twist.[65] For the performance, Stewart won the César Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first American actress to receive a nomination in thirty years. She is the second American winner after Adrien Brody, who won the César Award for Best Actor in 2003.[66][67] That same year, Stewart appeared alongside Julianne Moore in Still Alice, a drama film that premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Critics commended her performance in the film.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called her \"wonderfully vibrant and contentious\" and said: \"Even when Still Alice sometimes slips into sentiment, Moore and Stewart are funny, fierce and glorious.[68]\n\nStewart appeared in Tim Blake Nelson's Anesthesia, an indie drama about a group of New Yorkers, which was released on January 8, 2016, by IFC Films.[69] She co-starred with Jesse Eisenberg again in American Ultra (2015).[70] That same year, she starred in Once and Forever, which was directed by Karl Lagerfeld.

The pair eventually broke up in May 2013.[134]\n\nIn mid-2013, Stewart started dating visual effects producer Alicia Cargile.[135] She briefly dated French singer Soko in the spring of 2016, before she resumed dating Cargile in mid 2016.[136] From late 2016, she was in a relationship with New Zealand model Stella Maxwell until their breakup in late 2018.[137] Stewart has been in a relationship with screenwriter Dylan Meyer since August 2019, and stated in November 2021 that she and Meyer were engaged.[138]\n\nCharity work\n\nIn 2012, Stewart signed and donated the dress she wore to the premiere of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 to a CharityBuzz auction benefiting the Robin Hood Foundation's Sandy Relief Fund, which provides long-term support to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.[139] In 2016, she participated in building a school in Nicaragua through the nonprofit buildOn, with the goal being to give children the opportunity to become educated in a safe space and to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy.[140] The following year, she raised $500,000 for Hurricane Sandy relief by meeting with an unnamed \"Middle Eastern prince\" for 15 minutes.[141]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2000 The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas Ring Toss Girl Uncredited 2001 The Safety of Objects Sam Jennings 2002 Panic Room Sarah Altman 2003 Cold Creek Manor Kristen Tilson 2004 Catch That Kid Maddy Phillips Undertow Lila 2005 Fierce People Maya Zathura: A Space Adventure Lisa Budwing 2007 The Messengers Jessica \"Jess\" Solomon In the Land of Women Lucy Hardwicke The Cake Eaters Georgia Kaminski Into the Wild Tracy Tatro Cutlass Young Robin Short film 2008 Jumper Sophie What Just Happened Zoe The Yellow Handkerchief Martine Twilight Bella Swan 2009 Adventureland Emily \"Em\" Lewin The Twilight Saga: New Moon Bella Swan 2010 The Runaways Joan Jett The Twilight Saga: Eclipse Bella Swan Welcome to the Rileys Allison/Mallory (alias) 2011 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 Bella Swan 2012 Snow White and the Huntsman Snow White On the Road Marylou The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 Bella Swan K-11 Ray's Secretary Voice role 2014 Camp X-Ray Cole Clouds of Sils Maria Valentine Still Alice Lydia Howland 9 Kisses Short film 2015 American Ultra Phoebe Larson Anesthesia Sophie Once and Forever Coco Chanel Short film[142] Equals Nia 2016 Certain Women Elizabeth Travis Café Society Vonnie Personal Shopper Maureen Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk Kathryn 2018 Lizzie Bridget Sullivan JT LeRoy Savannah Knoop 2019 Seberg Jean Seberg Love, Antosha Herself Documentary[143] Charlie's Angels Sabina Wilson 2020 Underwater Norah Price Happiest Season Abby Holland 2021 Spencer Diana, Princess of Wales 2022 Crimes of the Future Timlin 2024 Love Lies Bleeding Lou Love Me me.life.form/Deja Sacramento † TBA Post-production[144]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1999 Girl in Fountain Line TV movie, uncredited 2004 Speak Melinda Sordino TV movie 2008 The Sarah Silverman Program Announcer Episode: \"I Thought My Dad Was Dead, But It Turns Out He's Not\", uncredited 2017, 2019 Saturday Night Live Herself (host) 2 episodes 2022 Irma Vep Lianna Episode: \"The Terrible Wedding\" 2023 Living for the Dead Herself (narrator) Also creator and executive producer\n\nMusic videos\n\nYear Title Artist 2011 \"I Was Broken\" Marcus Foster 2014 \"Just One of the Guys\" Jenny Lewis 2016 \"Ride 'Em On Down\" The Rolling Stones 2018 \"If You Really Love Nothing\" Interpol 2023 \"You Only Love Me\" Rita Ora\n\nAs director\n\nYear Title Notes 2014 \"Take Me To The South\" Music video by Sage + the Saints 2017 Come Swim Short film, part of the anthology series ShatterBox Anthology \"Down Side of Me\" Music video by Chvrches 2020 Crickets Short film, part of the anthology series Homemade 2023 The Film Short film/music video by Boygenius\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nStewart has received a César Award, Milano Film Festival Award, Young Artist Award, and the BAFTA Rising Star Award.
