The film also features actress Parker Posey.\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\n*\n\nAllen is also in pre-production for a yet-untitled forthcoming 2016 film that will star Jesse Eisenberg, Bruce Willis and Kristen Stewart.\n\nNo plot details were available for the project (as is customary for Allen), who returned to Hollywood after his Broadway musical Bullets Over Broadway experienced only a brief run in 2014."
