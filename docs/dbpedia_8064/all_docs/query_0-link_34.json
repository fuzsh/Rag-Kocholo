        "text": "Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg are being tipped to star in Woody Allen's next movie.\n\nThe duo will be directed alongside Bruce Willis in the Academy Award-winning filmmaker's 2016 film project if final negotiations are completed.\n\nThe project will be produced by Allen's younger sister Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson, reports Deadline.\n\nNo storyline details have been announced for the untitled movie yet.\n\nEisenberg previously worked with Allen on the director's 2012 romantic comedy To Rome with Love. Eisenberg and Stewart also worked together on the critically-acclaimed 2009 comedy Adventureland.\n\nStewart recently became the first American actress to win a French Cesar Award for her performance in Clouds of Sils Maria.\n\nAllen's forthcoming Irrational Man is scheduled to premiere late in the year. Joaquin Phoenix has the lead role in the movie as a university professor who begins a torrid love affair with a student (Emma Stone)."
