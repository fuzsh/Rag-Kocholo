        "text": "Every year since the beginning of time (or at least the early '70s), Woody Allen has made a movie — often a quirky rom-com, always admirably star-studded — and this year will be no different. Today, he announced the cast of his next film, and it's as shiny and A-list as we'd hope.\n\nFellow former teen queens Kristen Stewart and Blake Lively will be teaming up for the untitled flick that also stars Jesse Eisenberg, Parker Posey, and Anna Camp. At the moment, there are very few details available, which is how things historically go with Woody. We do know that they'll begin filming in both New York City and Los Angeles this month, which means that the movie will hopefully hit theaters by summer.\n\nSince Kristen has pretty much exclusively done broody dramas since her Twilight days, and Blake's biggest roles have been based on frothy but fun YA fiction (both Gossip Girl and Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants), this movie — whatever it ends up being about — will undoubtedly be worth watching, even if a Bella Swan/Serena van der Woodsen showdown isn't in our future.\n\nAlso, Check Out: Kristen Stewart Is Starring in a Ghost Story About the Glamorous World of Fashion\n\nStyle\n\nBlake Lively Wore Britney Spears's Versace Dress from 2002\n\nAnd a Barbie pink corset dress for the after-party.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nBlake Lively & Gigi Hadid Took Method Dressing to the Next Level\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine, but make it fashion.\n\nCulture\n\nBenny Blanco Narrated Selena Gomez's GRWM Video & It's Chaotic\n\n\"I don't even know why you need makeup you look so good.\"\n\nCelebrity Style\n\n8 Rising French Designers You Need to Know\n\nAre you happy to be in Paris? Oui!"
