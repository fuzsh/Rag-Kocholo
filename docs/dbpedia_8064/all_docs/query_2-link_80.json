        "text": "Woody Allen has set his cast for his next movie, which will feature Justin Timberlake and Juno Temple in supporting roles.\n\nKate Winslet already boarded the project last month, and Jim Belushi also recently signed on to star.\n\nThe film will mark the first collaboration between singer-actor Timberlake, best known on the film side for his turns in The Social Network and Inside Llewyn Davis, and director Allen. The move is similar to Allen casting music star Miley Cyrus to topline his first-ever television project — an untitled six-episode series he wrote and directed for Amazon (Allen and Elaine May also star).\n\nJustin Timberlake to Receive Teen Choice Decade Award\n\nThe new film is produced by his long-time collaborator Letty Aronson, Erika Aronson and Edward Walson. It begins shooting in the fall in New York. As usual, the project is shrouded in secrecy, and plot details and the film’s title are being kept under wraps.\n\nThough the official cast announcement made no mention of a distributor, sources say Amazon already is committed (Amazon is releasing Allen’s latest, Cafe Society, with Lionsgate). That film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and will open theatrically in the U.S. on July 15 via Lionsgate and Amazon, before moving to Amazon’s Prime streaming service.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nMiley Cyrus Dons Long, Blond Wig on the Set of Woody Allen’s Amazon Series: See the Pics\n\nAllen is known for attracting high-end talent to his ensemble films despite their relatively small budgets. Cafe Society stars Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively and Steve Carell. He is currently in post-production on the Amazon series.\n\nTemple, whose recent credits include Black Mass, had a breakout performance on the HBO series Vinyl. However, that series was recently canceled, with the network scrapping plans for a second season. She is repped by UTA, Troika and attorney James Feldman.\n\nTimblerlake introduced his next film, Trolls, at Cannes (he is the voice star alongside Anna Kendrick). He is handled by WME, LBI Entertainment and attorny P.J. Shapiro."
