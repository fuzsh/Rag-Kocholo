        "text": "Actor Bruce Willis has reportedly quit filmmaker Woody Allen's upcoming film to focus on his Broadway debut after having already shot for it, spurring rumours that he has been fired.\n\nThe 60-year-old Die Hard star was one of the first actors to sign on for Allen's as-yet-untitled movie, but he has since pulled out of the project, reported Deadline.\n\nProduction on the film began this month, but Willis reportedly decided to bow out as he is also preparing for his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Stephen King's acclaimed novel Misery, which opens this autumn. This is odd because these clashing dates are usually worked out before production begins. And since neither schedule has been altered, Willis' departure looks very suspicious.\n\nAllen is planning to recast Willis' role in time to keep production on schedule. The director isn't new to recasting roles after beginning production. He has replaced Diane Keaton and Michael Keaton in previous instances.\n\nHis upcoming film has a star-studded cast, which includes Blake Lively, Kristen Stewart, Parker Posey and Jesse Eisenberg, among others."
