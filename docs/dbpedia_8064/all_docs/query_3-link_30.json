Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick, and Paul Schneider are co-starring in the project.\n\nBoth Stoll and Posey have worked with Allen in the past, with Stoll portraying Ernest Hemingway in the 2011 film “Midnight in Paris” and Posey appearing in Allen’s recently released “Irrational Man.”\n\nThe film is being produced by longtime Allen collaborators Letty Aronson, Steve Tenenbaum and Edward Walson. Ronald L. Chez (“Magic in the Moonlight”), Adam B. Stern (“Blue Jasmine”) and Allan Teh are executive producing."
