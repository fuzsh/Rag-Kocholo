        "text": "Colin Firth is to join Emma Stone in Woody Allen's latest film, an untitled comedy set in the south of France, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nStone's potential involvement was revealed by Deadline last week, when the Easy A actor was said to be in talks. She and Firth are now officially on board the new film, which will mark Allen's return to the fertile French soil where he shot 2011 acclaimed time-travel fantasy Midnight in Paris. It will be the veteran director's eighth movie in his ongoing late-era European cruise, which began with London-set Match Point in 2005 and has also seen him travel to Italy and Spain for films such as 2008's Vicky Cristina Barcelona and last year's To Rome with Love. Few further details are known about the new French project, other than that it will shoot this summer.\n\nAllen is currently readying his most recent film, Blue Jasmine, for a July 2013 release in the US. It stars Cate Blanchett in \"the story of the final stages of an acute crisis and a life of a fashionable New York housewife\", according to the official synopsis.\n\nFirth was recently revealed to be in talks to play a supporting role in Matthew Vaughn's James Bond-style comic book movie The Secret Service. He is also due to appear in literary biopic Genius for Michael Grandage and second world war drama The Railway Man for director Jonathan Teplitzky.\n\nStone is currently working on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and the Alejandro González Iñárritu comedy Birdman. She is also due to join Guillermo del Toro's haunted house flick Crimson Peak and will star in an as yet untitled romantic comedy directed by Cameron Crowe."
