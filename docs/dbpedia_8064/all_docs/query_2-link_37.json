        "text": "ROME — Filmmaker Woody Allen has cast “The Social Network” star Jesse Eisenberg and Penelope Cruz in his new, as-yet-untitled movie, which is set to be filmed this summer in Rome, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Monday.\n\nThe film is also set to feature Ellen Page, of “Inception” and “Juno,” and current “30 Rock” star Alec Baldwin. Allen will also act in the film, in addition to writing and directing it.\n\nCruz won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Allen’s 2008 film “Vicky Christina Barcelona.”\n\nAllen refused to discuss the plot of the film in a March interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica. “I’m superstitious,” he said. “I’m still at the screenplay stage. It would be absurd to say more.”\n\nAllen’s most recent film, “Midnight in Paris,” will open the 64th edition of the Cannes Film Festival on May 11. It features a cameo performance from France’s First Lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who was reported to have needed more than 30 retakes for her short scene. Allen dismissed the claim as untrue."
