        "text": "Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix are set to star in Woody Allen‘s next pic.\n\nThe film is currently untitled, but Allen is expected to write, produce and direct as he has with so many of his other projects.\n\nPlot details are unknown, but sources say the film would likely shoot this July. The film is also without a distributor, but Sony Pictures Classics is a front-runner, as it has distributed this last handful of Allen films.\n\nThe cast is slowly starting to come together and expect it to be another grand ensemble. While this will be the first time Allen will have worked with Phoenix, he has been known to become attached to certain stars like Scarlett Johansson and Dianne Wiest. He looks to be doing the same here with Stone, whom he worked with on the upcoming “Magic in the Moonlight.”\n\nStone is coming off a big weekend at the box office, where her film “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” grossed $91.6 million at the domestic box-office. She is repped by WME and Anonymous Content.\n\nAllen’s last film, “Blue Jasmine,” landed Cate Blanchett a lead actress Oscar and Sally Hawkins a supporting actress nomination."
