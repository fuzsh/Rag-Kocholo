        "text": "New York, Aug 4 (EFE). — Bruce Willis, Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg will be part of the cast for Woody Allen’s next film, an as yet untitled project that will begin filming this month in New York and Los Angeles, the moviemaker announced on Tuesday.\n\nAlso appearing in the film will be Parker Posey, who was in Allen’s “Irrational Man,” Blake Lively, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll and Ken Stott, according to a brief announcement.\n\nThe film will reunite Stewart and Eisenberg, who in 2009 starred together in “Adventureland” and who later this month will appear in the action comedy “American Ultra.”\n\nStewart, 25, has an extensive filmography, but she is bestknown for her role in the popular saga “Twilight.”\n\nThis year, she was honored in France with the Cesar Award for best supporting actress for her role in “Clouds of Sils Maria,” in which she appears along with Juliette Binoche.\n\nEisenberg was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network” and he had already worked with Allen in “To Rome With Love.”\n\nFor the film and television veteran Willis, meanwhile, this will be his debut with the New York director, who so far has provided no further details about the project."
