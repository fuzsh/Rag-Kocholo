        "text": "When looking ahead to future releases, there is always one name you will find releasing a project: Woody Allen. The writer/director (and sometimes actor) is famous for releasing a movie a year stemming from the depths of his mind. Though his appearances in his films are sporadic, Allen is always writing and always behind the camera. Despite being 80, the film icon continues to push along, telling stories in his signature Woody Allen fashion — comedy.\n\nHis movies, however, do not always impress. Blue Jasmine, his feature from 2013, was the last movie the broke over 60% on Rotten Tomatoes. Before that, Midnight in Paris (2011), Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) and Match Point (2005) are the only others to break the 60% mark since 2000. There is no exact math or science in predicting a hit movie, but Woody Allen was due for one in 2016.\n\nThankfully, he delivered.\n\nCafè Society, as noted, was written and directed by Woody Allen. The film stars Jeannie Berlin, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively and Kristen Stewart — among many others. (Another trait of Allen films is the cast is filled with great acting talent). The story takes place, mostly, in Hollywood around the 1930s. Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg) moves to the bustling new city to begin anew from his home in New York City. His uncle Phil (Carell) is an agent and — begrudgingly— gets Bobby work and acquainted with Hollywood society. While in Hollywood, Bobby meets Veronica (Stewart) and instantly falls in love. Yet, she is in love with someone else. The story is a common love story, mixed in fun, well-written surprises, beautiful direction and incredible acting.\n\nWhat works the most is the story. The premise is a simple story where clichés are waiting to happen. Sitting there, I expected to see a similar story arc that plague most rom-com films. Café Society is different. There are twists and turns that had my shocked, yet enjoying every second. At multiple times throughout the film, I was yelling — OK, talking — to the screen. “What the hell?”; “NO!”; “Please…please…please!” were only a few of the phrases I could not keep inside my head. The film’s story and characters would not allow me. I cared about these characters. I was drawn into this world, feeling the emotional highs and lows of the story arc.\n\nNot only was this film filled with emotion that the viewer actually felt, Allen includes his trademark comedic vibe with Eisenberg’s character. Written as if Allen should be playing him circa the 1970s, the humor still works today. A scene where Eisenberg, on the advice of his brother, gets a “lady of the evening” is incredibly Woody Allen: from the bumbling conversation to Eisenberg making jokes at his expanse. No matter how many times this comedic trope gets light in a Woody Allen film, chuckles and laughs came from myself and the audience.\n\nA story is successful, in large part, because of the success of its characters. Among the labels one could place on this film, Cafè Society is a coming-of-age story in a time that is romanticized by many: the early days of Hollywood. That is a film “genre” I have always enjoyed, no matter how bad or good the film is rated. Writing strong, interesting characters is something Allen has mastered throughout his career. In this film, Eisenberg and Stewart are incredible. Both not known for their acting chops, the duo create incredible on-screen chemistry. They bring to life their fictional identities, as do the rest of the cast. The film is full of life and emotion, something not usually said about an Eisenberg or Stewart performance. But, they knock is out of the park in Cafè Society.\n\nApart from the strong writing and characters that pull you into this film, Cafè Society is shot beautifully. The costumes are lovely. The settings are incredibly. The sense of time and place is on point. I loved looking around at each set piece and taking in the furniture and decoration. The sense of style is appealing to the eye and creates a deeper appreciation for this world. This is the first film Allen shot on digital, which creates a crispness to the picture.\n\nTo add to the “vibe” of the time period, the soundtrack and music used in this film further brings you into this world. Assorted swing and jazz music — which makes sense for latter in the film — puts a grin on your face. I also enjoyed the sense of history the film had, name dropping the biggest of stars in the early Hollywood days. My favorite cultural inclusion into this world included a snippet of The Woman in Red starring Barbara Stanwyck. Seeing these characters get excited over seeing film stars that I love helps connect the bond the viewer has with Bobby Dorfman and Veronica.\n\nI understand: this is an incredibly glowing review. But, with Café Society, Woody Allen creates a magical viewing experience that can easily be coupled with Midnight in Paris. For me, this film is the best of 2016. I know that others will not see it like that, but I had the best time connecting and watching this story unravel. I liked the way it ended and how the characters grew from when we first met them.\n\nI can not put it more simply: Go see Café Society.\n\nWant more from CineNation?"
