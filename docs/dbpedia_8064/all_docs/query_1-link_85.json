        "text": "In a book published in 1921, Charlie Chaplin told the critic Louis Delluc that his comedy was based on “some simple truths about the character of mankind” and added that “when all is said and done, the foundation of all success is only a knowledge of human nature, whether one is a businessman, an innkeeper, a publisher, or an actor.” That’s more or less the subject of Woody Allen’s new film, “Café Society,” a sort of cinematic bildungsroman about the efforts of a callow young man to make his way in the world and the lessons he learns on the road to success.\n\nBobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg), a young Jewish man from the Bronx, flees his parents’ cramped apartment and his father’s modest jewelry-repair shop and heads for Hollywood, in the hope that his uncle—his mother’s brother, Phil Stern (Steve Carell), a big-time agent to the stars—can help him find a job and change his life. With his fidgety and analytical diction and his puckish self-observation, Eisenberg (who’s also a contributor to The New Yorker) seems like a ready-made stand-in for Allen himself. But Bobby Dorfman is different from Allen in several important ways.\n\nThe story is set in the mid-nineteen-thirties, so, unlike Allen himself (who was born in 1935), Bobby gets the benefit of a prewar Bildung. What’s more, Bobby is no Barton Fink, no New York intellectual seeking a life of the mind in Hollywood, like Rick Blaine going to Casablanca for the waters. Bobby has no specific talent or artistic vocation; he merely wants to live, and feels that, under his parents’ roof, in his father’s workshop, and in his narrow neighborhood purview, he’s hardly living. He heads West without stars in his eyes but with a cushioned vision of adventure, because he knows that, when he gets there, he’ll be able to look up Uncle Phil.\n\nPhil hires Bobby as a gofer; meanwhile, Bobby becomes acquainted with Phil’s Nebraska-born and college-educated assistant, Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), who is tasked with showing the newcomer the town, and their friendship blossoms into love. Bobby proposes to marry Vonnie and bring her back East, but he fails in his effort and returns alone, heartbroken, to New York, where his brother, Ben (Corey Stoll), a gangster masking brutal dealings with a legitimate business, hires him to help run a night club, a venture in which Bobby thrives.\n\nLike most of Allen’s later films, “Café Society” is sketch-like, seemingly scratched onto an icy surface that allows a clear view of the big philosophical fish swimming in the deep waters below. For that matter, the surface of this new film is particularly thin, less translucent than transparent, with very little of interest to the nearer vision, which may be why Allen took the unusual step of hiring a cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, who could be counted on to lend the surfaces a distinctive and eye-catching finish. The movie offers little else up front, which is all the more surprising—even a little disappointing—because its foreground, New York and Hollywood in the mid-thirties, is of such particular and abiding fascination, even for Allen himself.\n\nUnlike Allen’s “Midnight in Paris,” which is filled with onscreen embodiments of literary luminaries such as Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway, “Café Society” keeps its screen stars offscreen; it shies away from the specifics of New York cultural life at the height of the New Deal, avoids impersonations of stars, and offers no glimpses of work on soundstages or intrigue in commissaries. (The closest the movie comes to celebrities is the façades of some mansions and a bit of namedropping—notably, Ginger Rogers as well as Howard Hawks, the seminal director of screwball comedy.) For that matter, when Bobby becomes, briefly, a script reader, the movie offers no specific details about his work or his ideas. Allen seconds Chaplin’s wink at the universal underpinning of success and filters his own specific artistic aptitude and passion out of the story in order to look at achievement itself from the figure of an Everymensch and to consider what, outside the specifics of art, he himself had to learn in order to stand on his own two feet in the big city.\n\nA more aptly descriptive title for the movie would be, “The Price of Seichel,” or, “From Nebbish to Macher Without Subtitles.” Allen, who has never shied away from a joke about being Jewish, scatters Yiddish throughout the film, mainly in the voices of Bobby’s parents, the sharp-minded and strident Rose (Jeannie Berlin) and the sweatily vehement Marty (Ken Stott). The movie is filled with Jewish riffs and Jewish jokes, as well as several splendid doctrinal disputations about Allen’s main eternal obsession, death, and a twist on the Christian conversion from “Hannah and Her Sisters” that looks comically at a terrifying turn of events.\n\nBut Allen also gives a hint of his design in Marty’s complaint that Phil, Rose’s brother, is “not a Jewish man.” Marty’s not too specific—he doesn’t say that Phil isn’t observant or doesn’t keep kosher; he doesn’t even suggest that Phil has married outside the faith. (It’s never made clear.) Perhaps only in a narrow family circle in a tightly knit Jewish neighborhood in the Bronx could Hollywood seem insufficiently Jewish. But when Phil finally welcomes Bobby into his office, after unseemly weeks of delay, the older man doesn’t even know his name. The Dorfman family, with its sentimental mutual attachments and fierce allegiances, embodies Judaism as a centripetal force of sentiment and tradition that, like a black hole, pulls energy inward and keeps the young man from engaging open-mindedly with the wider world. Allen’s Judaism isn’t intellectual and it isn’t historical; it’s personal, rooted in the specific milieu of his upbringing, the American urban cluster of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, and he imbues Bobby with its peculiar contradictions.\n\nBobby leaves home not for the wild but for his uncle’s sheltering but dutiful embrace; he also leaves his family while rushing to start a family of his own. He claims to have fallen in love with Vonnie at first sight; she deflects his ardent declarations with the confession that she’s already in a relationship. (She doesn’t say with whom, but Bobby ultimately finds out—she’s seeing her boss, Uncle Phil.) But when Vonnie’s ready to reciprocate his affections, Bobby makes his plans clear to her, proposing marriage and planning for them to move back to New York, specifically, to Greenwich Village, where he’s got no specific plans but plenty of confidence that he’ll find something useful to do. Bobby’s a young man in a hurry, but his hurry is less to wander the world in quest of experience than to find a woman from outside his circle (of course, a shiksa from the American heartland) to settle down with, in a part of New York that’s just far enough from home.\n\nThe very mention of Greenwich Village in the nineteen-thirties, in a movie called “Café Society,” sparks a hope that the plot doesn’t fulfill. Suddenly I expected that the lovelorn and disheartened Bobby would return home and not merely manage a night club but manage the Café Society, a real-life venue of historic import. The actual Café Society was founded in 1938, in a Greenwich Village basement, by Barney Josephson, who had the express intention of making it New York’s first fully integrated night club—both its staff and its clientele. It was a jazz club that had an explicit political orientation and an advanced musical orientation (thanks to the counsel of the record producer and jazz impresario John Hammond). Café Society is where Billie Holiday introduced the song “Strange Fruit,” in 1939. I figured that Allen, with his enthusiasm for jazz, would find this association irresistible, and would make much of the musical importance of the venue. What’s more, I figured that a glance and a sketch, through Allen’s eyes, of the real Café Society would have happily extended his purview into matters that he has generally neglected—politics and, in particular, the politics of race.\n\nNo such luck. Allen does both less and more with Bobby’s night-club adventures, not exploring subjects new to him but looking with a cold lucidity at familiar but elusive ones. Jazz does crop up in the movie—the Count Basie band’s “Taxi War Dance” is used, weirdly, as a leitmotif for scenes of gangland violence—as does race, awkwardly but (in a pre-Café Society way) accurately, with Bobby romancing an elegant divorcée by taking her to hear a group of black musicians in a small and inelegant club where all the other patrons are black. As for the night club that Ben owns and Bobby manages, it’s called Les Tropiques, and it’s no jazz club, no cultural attraction, but, rather, a place of power, something like the Stork Club, where (as the song goes) the underworld can meet the élite.\n\nPoliticians, business leaders, crime bosses, and the city’s power brokers and power wielders gather and mingle at Les Tropiques, and Bobby mingles with them, moving among them suavely and with the appearance of effortlessness. These qualities don’t come naturally to him but, rather, he picked them up along the way, along with the one big unhealed scar on his soul, left by the love of his life who got away. Bobby’s heartbreak is only a part of the lesson that he learned, quickly but definitively; the other part, and the starker one, is that he lost her to someone who’s not merely older but richer, worldlier, and more powerful. Bobby learns that the ways of the heart and the ways of the world are two different things, and that dividing himself—separating the public persona and the private soul, the field of action from the realm of emotion—is the first step to success. The anti-romanticism of “Café Society,” the lesson of heartbreak and crushed dreams of love, arises from its romanticism of youthful illusions. The dialectic of success is being vulnerable enough and imaginative enough to believe in the love that will get crushed—to be open to learning the painful lessons that await around the corner, to not be so circumspect in youth as to anticipate and avoid them.\n\nAllen doesn’t at all seem interested in the hows and the whys of the story—how Bobby learns what he needs to learn, what in particular he learns in Hollywood, how his ambitions form, why he wants to leave New York, why he later wants to return to New York—but fills the movie only with the whats. He leaves his actors lots of leeway in a story and physical setting that allows for little freedom, and Stewart, with her blend of even-toned frankness and elusive opacity, is aptly cast in the role of an educated person of sensibility and imagination who’s out of her element in Hollywood and, for that matter, seemingly anywhere. Even more aptly cast, and offering a more detailed and composed performance, is Blake Lively, as Veronica, the elegant divorcée and City Hall official whom Bobby meets in New York. Lively captures, as do few actors today, the iridescent veneers of social behavior from a more formal era, a time when public behavior and private emotion were even more sharply cloistered.\n\nParker Posey, working with Allen again after her energetic turn in “Irrational Man,” plays a small but important role as an accomplished businessperson, in which the filmmaker seems to invest a disproportionately touching rush of emotion: the role of a true friend whose personal connection is strengthened by a convergence of professional interests. It’s the consolation for what comes instead of love and what survives love. Despite the movie's winks and nods at the prewar movies that Allen has paid homage to throughout his career, this separation of work and romance distinguishes the world of “Café Society\" from the classic-Hollywood world of Howard Hawks and other directors of fast-talking, street-smart romantic comedies, where such professional convergences are the very basis of love. It also distinguishes Bobby, a man of no specific talent or vocation who merely gets a job and rides it as far as he can, from Allen, whose lifelong artistic calling is itself a kind of love."
