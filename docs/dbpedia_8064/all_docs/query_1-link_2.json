        "text": "When we first learned that Kristen Stewart and Blake Lively had joined Woody Allen’s upcoming comedy Café Society, we were immediately curious to see how the starlets would fit into the filmmaker's ensemble tableau. And since the Oscar winner is famous for keeping details about his projects under wraps, we were kept in the dark until the film's first trailer hit the Internet on Thursday, suggesting how both actresses fit into the costume film.\n\nCafé Society centers on Eisenberg as the traditional Allen avatar—a neurotic creative who, this time around, heads to Hollywood to make it in the entertainment industry. Under the wing of his uncle (Steve Carell), Eisenberg's characters makes inroads into the titular society that defined the 30s—and with Carell's screen assistant Bonnie, played by Stewart. It doesn't take long for Eisenberg to fall under Bonnie's bewitching spell—alas, she has a boyfriend. (A character consoles him in the most Woody Allen-esque manner possible, saying, “Unrequited love kills more people in one year than tuberculosis.”)\n\nLively and Anna Camp co-star as characters who may or may not succeed in distracting Eisenberg from his crush. The cast is rounded out by Corey Stoll, Kelly Rohrbach, Parker Posey, Judy Davis, and Paul Schneider.\n\nTake a look at the trailer above. Café Society opens this year's Cannes Film Festival before arriving in theaters on August 12.\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nKristen Stewart and Woody Allen to Jump-Start This Year's Cannes Film Festival\n\nThe actress stars in Café Society, which will open this year's Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIt's Miley!\n\nWoody Allen’s Newest Ingenue Is...Miley Cyrus?\n\nThe director has picked Miley Cyrus as his latest leading lady.\n\nMovies\n\nIt Ends With Us: The 5 Biggest Changes From Book to Movie\n\nThe big-screen version of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel ages up the characters and scraps a whole Ellen DeGeneres subplot.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan Biopic Could Shape This Year’s Oscar Race\n\nWith A Complete Unknown, the Oscar nominee could be back in the race for the first time since his breakout in Call Me by Your Name. But that’s only the beginning of the awards potential for this movie.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season."
