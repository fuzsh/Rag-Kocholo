        "text": "But the same day that news broke, photos surfaced of Willis on the set of Allen's movie in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nNow some have questioned whether Willis' exit really was due to a scheduling conflict. Actor availability is often worked out before cameras start rolling, and The Wrap's Jeff Sneider tweeted that Willis was actually fired.\n\nThis is not the first time Allen has let an actor go during production. Allen has been known to recast in the middle of shooting. As The Playlist points out:\n\nChristopher Walken and Sam Shepard both were filmed playing the role of Peter in 'September' before ultimately being replaced by Sam Waterston. Michael Keaton was replaced by Jeff Daniels after ten days of shooting 'The Purple Rose Of Cairo.' Juliette Lewis replaced Emily Lloyd in 'Husbands and Wives' after some footage was shot.\n\nAnd there have been stories for years about how difficult Willis is to work with. Director Kevin Smith was so fed up with Willis' behavior he went public, dedicating a chapter in his memoir, \"Tough Sh-t,\" about how awful it was to work with Willis on the film \"Cop Out.\"\n\n\"He turned out to be the unhappiest, most bitter, and meanest emo-bitch I've ever met at any job I've held down,\" Smith wrote. \"And mind you, I've worked at Domino's Pizza.\"\n\nWillis was also cut from \"The Expendables 3\" after a contract dispute. This led the franchise's star, Sylvester Stallone, to tweet this:\n\nRegardless of why Willis left, Allen is recasting and production on the movie will not be delayed, according to Deadline.\n\nWillis' reps told Business Insider that the Deadline story is accurate and have no further comment."
