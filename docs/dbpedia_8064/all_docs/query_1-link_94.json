        "text": "From the first glance at this trailer, a lot feels the same in Woody Allen's world for his latest, Café Society. You've got Jesse Eisenberg as the Allen substitute and Kristen Stewart providing a romantic sparring partner. But there is a subtle change: Allen's switched to digital filmmaking for the new comedy drama, which has just put its first trailer out into the world.\n\nThe new film finds Woody back on period comedy duty in 1930s America for the story of young Bobby (Eisenberg), who has dreams of working in Hollywood. He relocates to Los Angeles and meets up with his uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a power player in the industry. Once he arrives, he encounters and falls for Bonnie (Stewart) while also being drawn in by the cafe society of the time and the stylish whirlwind that is 1930s' Hollywood. But this being an Allen film, it won't be quite that simple.\n\nCafé Society will premiere out of competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival and will be released in the States via Amazon in August. There's no word on a UK date yet."
