        "text": "Woody Allen, despite everything, still knows how to assemble a cast that makes us stand up and pay attention. And even with an Amazon TV series on the horizon, he’s still sticking to his regular schedule of making a film every year. The cast for his latest effort, still untitled and now filming in New York and Los Angeles, will bring two much-beloved-in-the-V.F.-office faces to the Allen universe: scowling sweetheart Kristen Stewart and lifestyle guru Blake Lively.\n\nThose two are listed in the main cast lineup—alongside Jeannie Berlin, Jesse Eisenberg, Parker Posey, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, and Bruce Willis—while Anna Camp and Paul Schneider are included in the list of “co-stars.” That’s the only clue we get to the size of each actor’s respective role in the film, which, if Allen tradition dictates, will premiere sometime next spring or summer. But look at what Allen has done for up-and-coming actresses in the past! Either Lively or Stewart could be his new Emma Stone, or Scarlett Johansson, or hell, Dianne Wiest. We may be looking back years from now, after Blake Lively accepts her Oscar and name-checks Cate Blanchett, as the moment we all learned that underestimating The Age of Adaline was a fatal mistake. Or we’ll lump this in with Stewart’s Cesar Award win and present this casting announcement as part of “the Kristen Stewart epoch.”\n\nOr, this movie could turn out like Magic in the Moonlight or Irrational Man and vanish from our memories the moment it comes out. With Allen, you really never know.\n\nMovies\n\nIt Ends With Us: The 5 Biggest Changes From Book to Movie\n\nThe big-screen version of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel ages up the characters and scraps a whole Ellen DeGeneres subplot.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on HBO and Max to Watch Right Now\n\nStop aimlessly scrolling: We’ve got all the recommendations you need.\n\nHollywood\n\nKamala Harris Impersonators Didn’t Just Fall Out of a Coconut Tree\n\nA handful of comedians already have the VP’s cadence and laughter just right—and could see their cachet grow as the presidential race heats up.\n\nBusiness\n\nInside California’s Freedom-Loving, Bible-Thumping Hub of Hard Tech\n\nMany cities have aspired to be the next Silicon Valley. But here in El Segundo—home to an upstart, male-dominated defense tech enclave—the founders are defining themselves in opposition to it. “This is not ‘San Francisco lite,’” says one, “or ‘San Francisco plus a little bit of hardware.’”\n\nHollywood\n\nHarvey Weinstein to Face New Sexual Assault Trial in November\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan might bring new accusations against the previously convicted former movie mogul.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan Biopic Could Shape This Year’s Oscar Race\n\nWith A Complete Unknown, the Oscar nominee could be back in the race for the first time since his breakout in Call Me by Your Name.
