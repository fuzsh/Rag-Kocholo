        "text": "It has been confirmed that Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg will reunite for a third time to film Woody Allen’s latest film.\n\nAllen revealed on Tuesday (4th August) that Stewart and Eisenberg will take the lead roles in his as yet untitled film. They are joining an already huge line-up of stars already committed to the film, including Bruce Willis, Blake Lively and Corey Stoll. Anna Camp, Ken Stott and Paul Schneider are also set to appear in the movie.\n\nStewart, Eisenberg and Willis were first rumoured to be attached to the project back in March, but no formal announcement confirming there participation was made until now. Details of the film’s plot are still being kept tightly under wraps, but filming is set to begin this month in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nThe duo have previously co-starred together in 2009’s Adventureland and this month’s upcoming stoner comedy, American Ultra."
