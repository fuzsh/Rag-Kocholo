        "text": "On set today, gone tomorrow — that seems to be what has happened with Bruce Willis and the new Woody Allen film currently in production, co-starring Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Anna Camp, Paul Schneider, and more. However, what actually happened is up for debate.\n\nAccording to Deadline, it was simply scheduling, as the actor is due to appear on Broadway in an adaptation of Stephen King‘s \"Misery.\" However, something doesn’t quite make sense with that story. Presumably, Willis would’ve known beforehand about his obligations elsewhere, and moreover, he was photographed on set yesterday shooting scenes from Allen’s pictures. So what gives?\n\nWell, according to Jeff Sneider of The Wrap, he tweeted that Willis was actually fired from the movie, though the exact reason for his departure wasn’t disclosed. But perhaps the real reason is somewhere in the middle?\n\nThough it hasn’t happened in a long time, Allen has been known to swap out actors mid-production if they are not working out. Christopher Walken and Sam Shepard both were filmed playing the role of Peter in \"September\" before ultimately being replaced by Sam Waterston. Michael Keaton was replaced by Jeff Daniels after ten days of shooting \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo.\" Juliette Lewis replaced Emily Lloyd in \"Husbands and Wives\" after some footage was shot. Anyway, you get the idea. So perhaps something similar was playing out here.\n\nWe’ll see if any more details surface today but it seems there’s more at play here than just the PR message that seems to have been massaged through the trades. All that said, Allen is expected to find a replacement for Willis without interrupting the production schedule."
