        "text": "Kristen Stewart is to appear alongside an all-star cast in Woody Allen's untitled 2016 movie.\n\nKristen Stewart\n\nStewart, who's best known for her performances in the 'Twilight' franchise, is to star alongside some of Hollywood's biggest names, such as Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively and Bruce Willis, in the eagerly-awaited project from the acclaimed director.\n\nThe movie will mark Allen's return to New York City, where he was born and where he's shot most of his movies.\n\nWhat's more, the movie will see Allen reunite with Eisenberg, having previously collaborated on the 2012 comedy 'To Rome With Love'.\n\nNews of the movie's cast comes shortly after Woody's former lover and 'Annie Hall' co-star Diane Keaton described the award-winning director as a \"miracle\".\n\nShe said: \"He's really astonishing. He's one of the most astonishing people in showbusiness, ever. He's had more power over his movies than anyone for a longer amount of time than anyone. He's a miracle.\"\n\nDiane said Woody is much more resilient than most people realise.\n\nShe explained: \"I used to say to him that he was the cockroach you couldn't kill! This guy is stronger than you think. Most people look at him and think, 'Oh, he's Woody Allen, he's shy.' He's a rock!\""
