        "text": "America's sweetheart Emma Stone is in talks to star in Woody Allen's next movie, TheWrap has confirmed.\n\nLike most of Allen's films, plot details are being kept under wraps, though agency insiders tell TheWrap that the Oscar-winning director is looking to cast a British actor as the male lead.\n\nAllen's longtime producers Letty Aronson and Stephen Tenenbaum will return to produce the untitled film, which is gearing up for a summer shoot.\n\nHalf the fun of watching a Woody Allen movie is taking in the sights and sounds of the city he has chosen to shoot in. Allen has bounced around from London (\"Match Point\") to Barcelona (\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\") to Paris (\"Midnight in Paris\") to Rome (\"To Rome With Love\") and most recently, to San Francisco, where much of his upcoming movie \"Blue Jasmine\" takes place.\n\nThere are conflicting reports as to where Allen will shoot his next film, with Deadline claiming the south of France and Variety reporting it'll be set in Spain.\n\nShould a deal close, Allen would be the latest A-list filmmaker to fall for Stone's charms. The actress has a full slate on her plate, as she's set to star opposite Bradley Cooper in Cameron Crowe's revamped \"Deep Tiki,\" as well as Guillermo del Toro's haunted house movie \"Crimson Peak,\" though the latter project isn't expected to start production until early next year.\n\nShe's currently filming Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ensemble comedy \"Birdman\" with Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, and she'll reprise the role of Gwen Stacy in \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\"\n\nStone, who can currently be heard voice a lead role in \"The Croods,\" is repped by WME and Anonymous Content.\n\nStone's casting was first reported by Deadline."
