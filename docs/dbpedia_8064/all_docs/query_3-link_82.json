        "text": "Colin Firth, who won an Academy Award for The King's Speech, and Emma Stone, who won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Liplock (for Crazy, Stupid, Love, of course!) have signed on as the leads in Woody Allen's thus-far-untitled 47th film, to be shot this summer in the south of France. Although details are few about the Woodman's latest, it does mark his return to the Continent after shooting his last pic, Blue Jasmine, in San Francisco.. That one, with Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins, opens in late July.\n\nAfter ditching New York City in the mid-aughts to shoot Match Point in London, Allen has made six other films in Europe: Scoop, Cassandra's Dream and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger in the U.K., Vicky Cristina Barcelona in Spain, Midnight in Paris in France and To Rome with Love in Italy."
