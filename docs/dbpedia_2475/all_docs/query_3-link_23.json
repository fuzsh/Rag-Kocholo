        "text": "Sixty years ago this year, the Salinas Valley hosted Hollywood, which was making a film of John Steinbeck's novel, \"East of Eden.\"\n\nScenes were selected. A few extras were chosen. Spectators lined up to watch the action.\n\nCreated in 1954 and premiering in 1955, \"East of Eden\" was based in part on Steinbeck's 1952 novel.\n\n\"From what I recall of the filming of 'East of Eden,' Salinas went bananas over it,\" said Nick Cominos, 94, who drove out one day to watch the filming. \"Spectators were kept quite away, but the movie was the buzz around town,\" he recalled.\n\nThe Cominos family owned the Hotel Cominos in Salinas, a place were some of the cast and crew stayed.\n\n\"East of Eden\" is a biblical reference and the film is a retelling of the Cain and Abel story. Cal seems on an eternal quest to win his father's love. Instead, he makes a series of tragic missteps. Unintentionally, those missteps generate friction and disappointment where Cal intended a father's love to be.\n\nThe character of Cal is played by James Dean. Though Dean couldn't know it at the time, he was bound for early stardom and for an early death. Actor Raymond Massey was next to appear. Massey played Dean's father in the film. The old actor felt a genuine dislike for the young actor, a dislike he nurtured, using its dark energy to fire his own emotions and enhance his performance as the father.\n\nBurl Ives, playing the sheriff, tucked four cigars in his vest pocket. The fifth, he lit. He blew out the smoke and launched into conversation with director Elia Kazan and actress Jo Van Fleet about the day ahead. \"East of Eden\" also starred Julie Harris, Richard Davalos, and Lois Smith (fans of True Blood would come to know Smith as Sookie's grandmother).\n\nThe Californian has had a series of photos of the filming of \"East of Eden\" — photos which had been misplaced and forgotten. Rediscovering them prompted the paper to see if it could find people who had watched the classic movie being filmed on area sites, such as Spreckels or near King City. We invited those who knew anything about the making of the film to call us and we would write this story. So many responded, we ran out of space.\n\nLydia Guerrero, for example, was a teenager at Spreckels School. She got a small part as \"the Mexican girl.\" In his book, \"James Dean, Behind the Scenes,\" edited by Leith Adams and Keith Burns, Guerrero is photographed \"beside the railroad tracks outside Salinas,\" in a field of fragrant flowers. Also pictured in the same frame is Dean himself in overalls and director Kazan.\n\n\"East of Eden\" filmed scenes in the Salinas Valley, including in an ice house as well as locations around the Spreckels Sugar Factory. The film's progress report for June 7, 1954, posts \"R.R. Tracks\" and \"Lettuce Loading\" and then \"Salinas Valley.\"\n\nA bulky camera rig, a creature bristling with with boom microphones and reflectors, rolled into view. A boxcar, \"Salinas Valley Lettuce\" stamped on its side, stood on a sidetrack. In another frame, Dean, in his trademark brooding mood, slumped in a wooden and canvas director's chair.\n\nAl Oliveira was another local who developed ties to the film. Oliveira today grows grapes for a major vineyard. Sixty years ago, though, he was a farmer cultivating a bean field eight miles north of King City. The \"East of Eden\" scouts were in search of a bean field. They liked what they saw in Oliveira's field. They paid him $500 for two days.\n\n\"In those days, $500 was good money,\" he said.\n\nPlus, Oliveira, now 86, got to mingle with the stars on the set including Dean and Ives.\n\n\"We got to watch the whole procedure,\" he said. \"I really did enjoy it. I'd read 'East of Eden.' I was kind of into Steinbeck. He was a homeboy.\"\n\nOther scenes were filmed in Mendocino and at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios. Other locals were extras employed in scenes of lettuce packing and other situations. Children, too, might figure in the proceedings. Melvin Crisp, 71, was a boy growing up in Spreckels — his dad was a pipe fitter for the sugar company for 34 years — when the cast and crew of \"East of Eden\" came to town.\n\n\"At one time, I had everyone's autographs in a book,\" Crisp recalled. \"Then my mother and dad moved, and it disappeared.\"\n\nCrisp did get to see the production efforts, including the crew removing huge oak trees and putting them in stands so they could haul them about as part of the background. Crisp was inadvertently left out of being a part of the acting, though. In Crisp's family, the tradition was that his parents would take him on vacation starting the last day of school.\n\n\"They'd load me up, and off we'd go,\" he recalled.\n\nThat summer they visited Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. He was gone two weeks and when he got back home, he'd apparently lost his chance at stardom, though at least three of his young friends appeared on the screen.\n\nThe set was friendly, he recalled. On occasion, it would be open to people wanting to wander about, which they did.\n\nTim Riley was a 10-year-old living in Spreckels when \"East of Eden\" landed in town. Riley was curious about the production since his father and John Steinbeck had been close friends.\n\n\"What I remember is a lot of excitement about it, a lot of clambering by people to get bit parts,\" Riley recalled. \"It was the biggest thing that had ever hit Spreckels.\"\n\nMost of the action centered near the town's train station, roughly where Spreckels Boulevard and the entrance to the T&A Café meet today. Riley and his buddies maneuvered close enough so they could see the unvarnished features of the famous actors.\n\n\"It all added up to a happy excitement and hubbub, yet we did need 'crowd control,'\" Riley said. \"Crowd control\" meant a few polite people in uniform. They might ask people to get rid of the gum they were chewing. Always, there was a civil \"Please\" attached. \"It was a different time,\" Riley said.\n\nNick Cominos was far from star struck by what he saw on one of the \"East of Eden\" sets. His family's hotel hosted many celebrities. They'd stop to dine or to stay over on their drive from San Francisco to Hollywood or vice versa. Those luminaries included Charlie Chaplin, John Payne of \"Miracle on Thirty-Fourth Street,\" and James Cagney.\n\n\"It was service like the Fairmont Hotel or the Palace,\" Cominos recalled. \"Everything was silver tray stuff.\"\n\nThe family even invited members of the cast in their home for dinner, recalled Cominos' sister, Sophie Britton.\n\n\"They wanted Greek food,\" Britton recalled. \"A couple of them drank quite a lot. It was fun. It was exciting.\"\n\nWhich brings up another link to \"East of Eden.\" Steinbeck, in person. He used to stop into the Hotel Cominos to eat. The author as a figure tucked in a rumpled suit, a half-smoked cigarette, as always, pinched between his tobacco-stained fingers. Always, too, Steinbeck would flip a quarter to Nick, then a young boy.\n\nOn one day early in the shooting, The Salinas Californian sent a photographer to get images for a story. The photographer shot a studio make-up man touching up the face of actor Dick Davalos, who plays Aaron.\n\n\"The young man is one of the friendliest on the set,\" the Californian reporter wrote. \"He grins like an overgrown kid. He acts like one and becomes serious only when he is John Steinbeck's Aaron.\"\n\nShooting began in May 1954 and wrapped on Aug. 9.\n\nAuthors often dislike how Hollywood treats their work. Steinbeck, though, decided that he liked he film.\n\n\"East of Eden\" garnered awards — the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role to Jo Van Fleet, for one. The Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture went to Elia Kazan, who won the Cannes Film Festival, Best Dramatic Film.\n\n\"It's a real good picture,\" Steinbeck wrote in a letter quoted in Jackson J. Benson's biography, \"John Steinbeck, Writer.\" \"I didn't have anything to do with it. Maybe that's why. It might be one of the best films I ever saw.\"\n\nIn all, James Dean made three films as the lead, the others being \"Rebel Without A Cause\" and \"Giant.\" \"East of Eden\" was the only one he saw in its entirety. The three, though, were enough to give him near-instant celebrity. He was killed in San Luis Obispo County in a car accident Sept. 30, 1955 en route to a car rally in Salinas. Dean was 24.\n\nTulare County connection\n\nThe late Donald Gene Turnupseed, a Tulare native, was the other driver in the car crash that killed actor James Dean in 1955.\n\nTurnupseed was a 23-year-old Cal Poly electrical engineering freshman living in Morro Bay at the time of the crash.\n\nTurnupseed was born in Porterville and moved to Tulare, where he was raised. He later served six years in the U.S. Navy.\n\nTurnupseed helped build the electrical contracting firm his parents began into a successful business known across the San Joaquin Valley with offices in Tulare, Bakersfield and Fresno. For most of his life he avoided talking about the crash. He died in July 1995 at age 63 from lung cancer."
