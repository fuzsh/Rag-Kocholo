Her other films included \"The Rose Tattoo,\" \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\" \"This Angry Age\" and \"The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.\"\n\nOver the years, Van Fleet played mother to many: She was Anthony Perkins' mother in \"Look Homeward, Angel\" on Broadway, Paul Newman's mother in \"Cool Hand Luke,\" and Cinderella's wicked stepmother in the 1965 television revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella.\"\n\nDuring her first year in Hollywood, the actress played the mother of Susan Hayward, then 37, in the film \"I'll Cry Tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter her success in \"East of Eden,\" Van Fleet told a Los Angeles Times interviewer that she worried about being typecast in tragic roles.\n\nShe began her stage career at Washington's National Theater in 1944 in \"U Harry\" and quickly established herself as a powerful character actress.\n\nVan Fleet first appeared on Broadway in 1946 in \"The Winter's Tale,\" before moving on to successes with \"The Trip to Bountiful\" in 1953, \"Look Homeward, Angel\" in 1957 and \"The Glass Menagerie\" in 1959 and again in 1965.\n\nShe appeared most recently in Robin Williams' \"Seize the Day,\" in 1986, which was rebroadcast in 1987 on PBS."
