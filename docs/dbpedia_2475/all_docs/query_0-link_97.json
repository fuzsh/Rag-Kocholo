        "text": "About the International Tap Dance Hall of Fame\n\nThe International Tap Dance Hall of Fame is the only tap dance hall of fame exclusively focused on tap dancers. It features founding and innovative 20th and 21st century professional tap dancers.With a collection of photographs, biographies, and videos, the Hall of Fame is becoming a colorful and diverse retrospective of America's seminal tap dance personalities.\n\nThe ATDF created the first International Tap Dance Hall of Fame in July of 2002, and its purpose is:\n\n- To honor the contributions of legendary tap dance artists by preserving their legacy for future generations to enjoy.\n\n- To increase public awareness of the diversity inherent in the form.\n\n- To provide an educational experience available to local, national, and international professionals, students, and the general population.\n\nBiographies\n\n2002 - Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson (c.1878 -1949), who claimed he could run backward faster than most men could go forward, was the most famous of all African American tap dancers in the twentieth century. Dancing upright and swinging, his light and exacting footwork brought tap “up on its toes” from an earlier flat-footed shuffling style, and developed the art of tap dancing to a delicate perfection. Born Luther Robinson in Richmond, Virginia, his parents, Maria and Maxwell Robinson, died in 1885. Young Bill was reared by his grandmother, Bedilia Robinson, who had been a slave. In Richmond, he got the nickname \"Bojangles\" from \"jangler,\" meaning contentious, and invented the phrase \"Everything's Copasetic,\" meaning tip-top. He got his first professional job in 1892, performing as a member of the pickaninny chorus for Mayme Remington with The South Before the War. When Robinson arrived in New York in 1900, he challenged the In Old Kentucky star tap dancer Harry Swinton to a Buck-dancing contest and won. From 1902-1914, he teamed with George W. Cooper. Bound by the \"two-colored\" rule in vaudeville, which restricted blacks to performing in pairs, they performed together on the Keith and Orpheum circuits, but did not wear blackface makeup that performers customarily used.\n\nRobinson was a staunch professional, but he was also a gambler who possessed a quick temper and carried a gold-plated revolver. An assault charge in 1915 split the act. After the split, Robinson launched his solo career, becoming one of the few African-Americans to headline at New York's prestigious Palace Theatre. Robinson's Stair Dance, introduced in 1918, was distinguished by its showmanship and sound, each step emitting a different pitch and rhythm.\n\nOnstage, his open face, twinkling eyes and infectious smile were irresistible, as was his tapping, which was delicate and clear. Buck or Time Steps were inserted with skating steps or crossover steps on the balls of the feet that looked like a jig, all while he chatted and joked with the audience. Robinson danced in split clog shoes, ordinary shoes with a wooden half-sole and raised wooden heel. The wooden sole was attached from the toe to the ball of the foot and left loose, which allowed for greater flexibility and tonality. In 1922, he married Fannie Clay who became his business manager, secretary, and partner in efforts to fight the barriers of racial prejudice. A founding member of the Negro Actors Guild of America, Robinson was also named \"Mayor of Harlem\" in 1933. Hailed as \"The Dark Cloud of Joy\" on the Orpheum Circuit, he performed in vaudeville from 1914-1927 without a single season's layoff. Broadway fame came with the all-black revue, Blackbirds of 1928, in which he sang and danced \"Doin' the New Low Down.\" Success was instantaneous. He was hailed as the greatest of all dancers by at least seven New York newspapers. Brown Buddies (1930), Blackbirds of 1933, All in Fun (1940) and Memphis Bound (1945) followed. The Hot Mikado (1939) marked Robinson's sixty-first birthday, which he celebrated by dancing down Broadway, one block for each year. Robinson turned to Hollywood films in the thirties, a venue hitherto restricted to blacks. His first film, Dixiana (1930) had a predominantly white cast; Harlem is Heaven (1933) was the first all-black film ever made. Other films include Hooray For Love (1935), In Old Kentucky (1935), The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935), One Mile From Heaven (1937), By An Old Southern River (1941), and Let's Shuffle (1941). Stormy Weather (1943) featured Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway and Katherine Dunham and her dance troupe. Robinson and Shirley Temple teamed up in The Little Colonel (1935), The Littlest Rebel (1935), Just Around the Corner (1938) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938), in which he taught the child superstar to tap dance. Claiming to have taught tap dance to Eleanor Powell, Florence Mills, and Fred Astaire, Robinson profoundly influenced the younger tap dancers at the Hoofers Club in Harlem, where he also could be found gambling and shooting pool. Throughout his lifetime, he was a member of many clubs and civic organizations and an honorary member of police departments in cities across the United States. His participation in benefits is legendary and it is estimated that he gave away well over one million dollars in loans and charities. \"To his own people, Robinson became a modern John Henry, who instead of driving steel, laid down iron taps,\" wrote Marshall Stearns. When Robinson died in 1949, newspapers claimed that almost one hundred thousand people turned out to witness the passing of the funeral procession. The founding of the Copasetics Club insured that his excellence would not be forgotten. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2002 - Eleanor Powell (1912-1982), who had the long legs of a thoroughbred dancer and speed and agility of an acrobat, is considered the ”Queen of Tap Dancing” on the silver screen. Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the shy eleven year old was sent to dancing school to learn acrobatics and ballet (but no tap dancing!) in an effort to make her more sociable. At the age of twelve, while visiting relatives in Atlantic City, she was spotted by Gus Edwards, a famous producer of children’s shows, which led to her stage debut in the Vaudeville Kiddie Review. After performing in the New York nightclub of the bandleader Ben Bernie, she made her Broadway debut in The Optimists in 1928; the show’s short run sent the young dancer to audition for more work on Broadway stage. Because she was asked if she could tap at every audition she went to, she enrolled in the dancing school of Jack Donohue, who taught her to tap dance by hanging sand bags onto a belt that weighed her down and riveted her to the floor, thus forcing her to tap close to the floor. She later became Donohue’s dance assistant.\n\nIn January 1929, Powell became a star on Broadway in Follow Thru, tapping to the acclaimed “Button Up Your Overcoat.” She also performed at Carnegie Hall with Paul Whiteman’s Orchestra and in 1932 Florenz Ziegfeld production of Hot-Cha! In 1935, she took Hollywood by storm, first dancing in George White’s 1935 Scandals and subsequently in Broadway Melody of 1936 (1935), Born to Dance (1936), Rosalie (1937), Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937), Honolulu (1939), Ship Ahoy (1942), Thousands Cheer (1943), Sensations of 1945 (1944), and Duchess of Idaho (1950). In Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940), she danced with Fred Astaire in the “Begin the Beguine” finale, matching the great dancer in height, grace, and footwork. In Lady Be Good (1941), she danced the “Fascinating Rhythm” number in top hat and short tails, choreography for the chorus Busby Berkeley; the number that opened on an extended close up of her tapping feet ended with her being tossed head over heel over and over again down a corridor of men.\n\nIn 1943, after twenty years of performing, she married the actor Glenn Ford and retired from the stage, devoting herself to charitable organizations and religious work, including a brief Sunday morning television series for children. In 1950, she was persuaded to appear in a musical number with Esther Williams and Van Johnson entitled “Dutchess of Idaho.” After her divorce from Ford in 1959, she continued a short but highly regarded night club career. An extended engagement at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas represented a remarkable comeback for a woman in her late forties as a dancer. She continued to dance in top nightclubs across the country. In 1981, she received an award in her name and her honor, the Ellie Award, from the National Film Ceremony, for her outstanding contribution to the film musical. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2002 - John Bubbles (1902-1986) revolutionized tap dancing by dropping heels on the offbeat, accenting rhythms with the toes, extending rhythmic patterns beyond the usual eight bars of music, and loading the bar with a complex slew of beats. No wonder why he is heralded as the Father of Rhythm Tap. There is no dancer today who has not been influenced by his inventions. Born John Sublett in Louisville and raised in Indianapolis, at the age of ten he teamed up with the six-year-old Ford Lee \"Buck\" Washington (1903-1955) in an act in which Buck stood and played piano and Bubbles sang. After winning a series of amateur-night shows around town, “Buck and Bubbles\" began playing engagements in Louisville, Detroit and New York City. Around the age of eighteen, Bubbles’ voice started changing and he switched his focus to dancing. Smarting at the embarrassment of being laughed out of the Hoofer's Club for being a novice tap dancer, Bubbles retreated to the privacy of the shed, determined to develop his technique. He returned to the Club with his new style of rhythm tapping that was laced with double Over-the-Tops and triple Back Slides, blowing everyone away.\n\nBy 1922, Buck and Bubbles reached the pinnacle in vaudeville by playing at New York's Palace Theatre. Bypassing the black T.O.B.A. circuit, their singing-dancing-comedy act headlined the vaudeville circuit from coast to coast. Buck's stop-time piano, played in a cool and laid back manner, contrasted with Bubbles' witty explosion of taps in counterpoint. They played the London Palladium, the Cotton Club, the Apollo, were the first blacks to perform at Radio City Music Hall, and continued to break the color barriers theatres across the country.\n\nTheir motion pictures include Varsity Show (1937), Atlantic City (1944), Cabin in the Sky (1943), and A Song is Born (1948). On his own, Bubbles appeared in Broadway Frolics of 1922, Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1930, and The Ziegfield Follies of 1931, and secured his place in Broadway history by originating the role of Sportin' Life in George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935). The role of Mingo in that production was played by Buck. He also appeared with Judy Garland at the Palace and Bob Hope in Vietnam, and recorded Harlem Comes to London, Selections from Porgy and Bess, and Bubbles, John W. That Is.\n\nBefore Bubbles, dancers tapped up on their toes, capitalized on flash steps and danced to neat two-to-a-bar phrases. Bubbles loaded his bar, dropped his heels and hit unusual accents and syncopations, opening the door of modern jazz percussion. \"I wanted to make it more complicated so I put more taps in and changed the rhythm,\" said Bubbles about his style, which prepared for the new sound of bebop in the 1950s and anticipated the prolonged melodic lines of \"Cool\" jazz in the 1950s. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2002 \"Baby Laurence\" Jackson (1921-1974) has been hailed as a jazz dancer of the rarest of rhythmic phenomena whose fluid beats, melodic phrasings, and instrumentalized conceptions moved him in the category of jazz musician. Born Laurence Donald Jackson in Baltimore, Maryland, he was a boy soprano at age twelve singing with McKinney's Cotton Pickers when the bandleader Don Redman came to town. He heard Jackson and asked his mother if he could take the boy on the road. She agreed, provided that her son was supplied with a tutor. While touring on the Loew's circuit, Jackson's first visit to New York was marked by a visit to the Hoofers Club in Harlem, where he saw the tap dancing of Honi Coles, Raymond Winfield, Roland Holder and Harold Mablin. Several years later, he returned to New York to perform with his brother in a vocal group they formed called \"The Four Buds\". While working in the Harlem nightclub owned by Dickie Wells, the retired dancer from the group of Wells, Mordecai and Taylor encouraged his dancing and nicknamed him Baby. He continued to frequent the Hoofers Club, absorbing ideas and picking up steps from Eddie Rector, Pete Nugent, Toots Davis, Jack Wiggins and Teddy Hale, who became his chief dancing rival. \"I saw a fellow dance and his feet never touched the floor,\" remembers tap dancer Bunny Briggs when he first saw Laurence dance in the thirties, when he was participating in after-hours jam sessions in Harlem and playing such theatres as the Apollo.\n\nHe also performed with group called the \"The Six Merry Scotchmen\" (in some billings, the \"Harlem Highlanders\"), who dressed in kilts, danced, and sang Jimmie Lunceford arrangements in five-part harmony. Around 1940, Baby focused on tap dancing and became a soloist. Through the forties, he danced with the big bands of Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Woody Herman, and in the fifties, he danced in small Harlem jazz clubs. It was under the influence of jazz saxophonist Charlie \"Bird\" Parker and other bebop musicians that he expanded tap technique into jazz dancing. Listening to the jazz pianist Art Tatum, Baby duplicated in his feet what Tatum played with his fingers. Listening to Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Bud Powell as well as the jazz drummer Max Roach, Baby developed a way of improvising solo lines and variations as much like a horn man as a percussionist. \"He was more a drummer than a dancer,\" writes Whitney Balliett in New York Notes (1976), \"he did little with the top half of his torso. But his legs and feet were speed and thunder and surprise... a succession of explosions, machine-gun rattles and jarring thumps.\"\n\nLike musicians in a jazz combo, Laurence was also a fluent improviser who took solos, traded breaks and built upon motifs that were suggested by previous horn men. He was a master of dynamics who would start a thirty-two-bar chorus with light heel-and-toe figures, then drop in heavy off-beat accents and sprays of rapid toe beats that gave way to double-time bursts of rhythm. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2002 - Steve Condos (1918-1990) was acclaimed for lightning-speed and a phenomenal precision style tap dancing that perfectly suited the tempos and rhythms of swing and bebop. As the only Greek-American to be a member of the Copasetics, the famous tap fraternity named in honor of Bill Robinson, Condos' routines were melodies in themselves that led audiences through an explosive journey of steel-tipped percussion.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he spent his childhood years in South Philadelphia where he absorbed sounds of the streets and alleys behind his father's restaurant that was located across the street from the Standard Theatre, the largest black vaudeville house in town. As a child, his father sent him with sandwiches for the comics and dancers who worked there, and sometimes the dancers would bring him onstage. By the time his family moved to New York City, he was a veteran street dancer steeped in the tradition of speed, rhythm, and precision that he had gotten in South Philly. As the youngest of three brothers, Steve's dancing style was conceived by his elder brother Frank, who he paired with at age fourteen and perfected with his middle brother Nick in an act billed as the Condos Brothers. During the thirties and forties, they spent most of their time in vaudeville, and then began to work with top swing bands. While brother Nick was expert at flash work (he is credited with inventing the five-tap wing), Steve concentrated on rhythm and surpassed nearly all his contemporaries with his phenomenal precision style of rhythm dance. As a lover of jazz, especially the music of Louis Armstrong but also Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker, Condos insisted that his tap routines be melodious as well as rhythmic.\n\nDancing with big bands of Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, the routines that the Condos Brothers danced together were set but they insisted on improvising their solos so that every show was different and every show was a challenge. As the favorite dance team of Hollywood producer Daryl Zanuck, the Condos Brothers (Nick and Steve) became one of the most sought-after dance teams for films in the thirties and forties and always insisted on dubbing their own taps in such films as Wake Up and Live (1937), Happy Landing (1938), In the Navy (1941), Pin-Up Girl (1944), The Time, the Place and the Girl (1946), She’s Back on Broadway (1953). They were also a sensation abroad, holding the longest record at London’s famous Palladium with the Crazy Gang by playing for an entire year.\n\nAs a soloist, Steve danced with Woody Herman’s big band, as well as with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Buddy Rich at the Apollo Theatre. His Broadway appearances include Heaven on Earth, Say Darling, and in 1972, Sugar, where he created the role of Spats Palazzo, the tap dancing gangster; in that show, Gower Champion gave him the unheard of liberty of improvising his steps nightly in his solo spot. Featured in the movie, Tap! (1988), starring Gregory Hines, Steve also appeared with Hines and Sammy Davis, Jr. on the Tonight Show, competing in a coast-to-coast tap challenge dance. In 1989, he performed in an historic performance at Carnegie Hall with Hines, Arthur Duncan, Savion Glover, Jimmy Slyde, Brenda Bufalino, Lynn Dally and members of Jazz Tap Ensemble. A stellar performer, Steve was also a superb teacher, and had the unique ability to break down and teach what he had improvised. Unknown Writer & Tony Waag\n\n2002 - Fred Astaire (1899-1987) was the American tap dancer extraordinaire; Frederick Austerlitz was born May 10, 1899 in Omaha, Nebraska. Astaire and his older sister, Adele, were brought to New York as children to receive dance training and perform on vaudeville stages.\n\nThey studied with Claude Alvienne and Ned Wayburn, but could not perform in New York because of the Gerry Society restrictions on child performers. They toured on the Keith-Orpheum circuit, then returned to New York as finished specialty dancers to enter Over the Top (1917). They worked together on Broadway in The Passing Show of 1918, For Goodness Sake (1922), the Gershwins’ Lady, Be Good (1925) and Funny Face (1927), Smiles (1930), and The Band Wagon (1931) and many others. The pair was extremely popular in New York, but their London reputations were even greater. Adele retired following the close of The Band Wagon, and Fred performed with Claire Luce in the 1932 film The Gay Divorcee.\n\nFor much of his film career, his search for a perfect partner was a frequent publicity theme. The partnership with Ginger Rogers is film and dance history, of course. The work with the great tap dancer Eleanor Powell, is legendary among tap professionals. A stunning choreographer himself, Astaire was also able to perform brilliantly in dances staged by many others. He danced the choreography of Dave Gould, who wont he first dance director Oscar for “the Carioca,” Harry Losse, a concert dancer with Denishawn lineage, Bobby Connolly, Charles Walters, and ballet choreographers Eugene Loring and Michael Kidd.\n\nAstaire’s dance numbers can be divided roughly into four categories – exhibition ballroom romances, tap competitions, solos, and solos with props. The most frequently performed was the first type, danced with each of his female partners; the dances were based on conventional exhibition ballroom styles, in turn based on social dance work. They involved a single format, with the meeting, duet work, breaks apart and pulls together, and a final symmetrical or tandem series of movements. Among Astaire’s examples in this style are the famous love duets with Ginger Rogers, such as “Cheek to Cheek” and “Night and Day,” which are exquisitely beautiful from their openings, in which one touch from Astaire spins her into his arms, to the finales in which they simply sit. Tap challenge numbers were danced with Rogers, as well as with his other partners. With Rogers and Powell especially, these numbers, based on minstrel formats, presented an alternating series of tap flurries, each dancer trying to best the other. In the “Let Yourself Go” number from Follow the Fleet, the Astaire-Rogers competition is set in a dance hall with “real” inter-couple competitions. The solos occasionally had a “schtik,” such as the “fireworks dance” in Holiday Inn, but more frequently were danced alone before a camera.\n\nThe solos with props are among his greatest accomplishments. He could not only dance with anyone, but with anything – the coat tree in Royal Wedding, the wall in that underrated film, or the drum set in Easter Parade. It would be difficult to overestimate Astaire’s influence. He represents tap, theater, and ballroom dance too much of the world, and perfection in performance to everyone. Unknown Writer & Tony Waag\n\n2002 - The Nicholas Brothers Fayard (1914-2006) and Harold (1921-2000) created an exuberant style of American theatrical dance melding jazz rhythm with tap, acrobatics, ballet and black vernacular dance. Their rhythmic brilliance, musicality, eloquent footwork and full-bodied expressiveness are unsurpassed, and their dancing represents the most sophisticated refinement of jazz as a percussive dance form.\n\nFrom a young age, at the Standard Theatre in Philadelphia where his parents conducted a pit band orchestra, Fayard was introduced to the best tap acts in black vaudeville. He then proceeded to teach young Harold basic tap steps. The \"Nicholas Kids\" made their professional debut in Philadelphia in 1930-31, and in New York, at the Lafayette Theatre one year later as the \"Nicholas Brothers.” In 1932 they opened at the uptown Cotton Club, which became their home base for next few years. Dancing with the orchestras of Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington, the brothers evolved a classy and swinging musical performance in which comic quips and eccentric dance combined with precision-timed moves and virtuosic rhythm tapping.\n\nAlternating between the stage and screen throughout their career, they made their first film, the Vitaphone short, Pie, Pie, Blackbird, with Eubie Blake in 1932 and their first Hollywood movie, Kid Millions, for Samuel Goldwyn in 1934. On Broadway, in Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 and Babes in Arms (1937), they worked with choreographer George Balanchine, and during the same period performed at the newly-opened downtown Cotton Club and starred in the London West End production of Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1936, in which they worked with Buddy Bradley.\n\nAt the Apollo, Harlem Opera House, Palace and Paramount theatres in the thirties and forties, the brothers danced with the big bands of Jimmy Lunceford, Chick Webb, Count Basie and Glen Miller. Collaboration with Hollywood dance director Nick Castle on seven musical films for 20th Century-Fox embellished the brothers' modern style of jazz dancing. They tapped on suitcases in The Great American Broadcast (1941), jumped off walls into back flips and splits in Orchestra Wives (1942) and jumped over each other down a flight of stairs, landing into a split on each step, in Stormy Weather (1943). These dazzling feats were always delivered with a smooth effortlessness. In Down Argentine Way (1940), they moved in perfect synchrony: arms and wrists circling, they slipped and slid along the floor, dipping into splits and whipping into one-legged wings.\n\nBy the late forties, their high-speed and rhythm-driven style was fast and fluent enough to endure the radical musical shift in jazz to Bebop. The Brothers headlined \"The Hepsations of 1945\" on a southern tour with Dizzy Gillespie's big band, and worked with bop composer/arranger Tad Dameron, but they were irresistibly drawn to the steady and danceable rhythms of Swing and continued to work in that musical tradition.\n\nWorking as solo artists in the late 1950s and early 60s, Harold in Europe and Fayard in America, the brothers were reunited for three Hollywood Palace television specials in 1964 and continued to perform as a team. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2002 - Jeni LeGon (1916 - ) is one of the first African American women in tap dance to develop a career as a soloist. Not a high-heeled dancer in pretty skirts, she was a low-heeled dancer performing toe-stand in pants, and her rigorous combination of flash, acrobatics, and rhythm dancing proved you didn’t have to be a man to dance like a hoofer. Born in 1916 and raised near the south side of Chicago, her musical talents were developed on the street in neighborhood bands and musical groups. At the age of thirteen, buoyed by her brother who got a job touring as a singer and exhibition ballroom dancer, she landed her first job in musical theatre, dancing as a soubrette in pants, not pretty skirts. By the age of sixteen, she was dancing in a chorus line backed by Count Basie Orchestra, and soon after touring as a chorus line dancer with Whitman Sisters, the highest paid act on the TOBA circuit. This all black, woman-managed company was successful in booking themselves continually in leading southern houses, and had the reputation for giving hundreds of dancers their first performing break. The Whitman Sisters’ chorus line, LeGon remembers, “they had all the colors that our race is known for. All the pretty shading from the darkest, to the palest of the pale. Each one of us was a distinct-looking kid. It was a rainbow of beautiful girls.” It was while working in Los Angeles, where she was stopping the show for her flips, double spins, knee drips, toe stands, that LeGon got a part in the 1935 MGM musical, Hooray for Love, as dance partner to Bill Robinson, who she says was a patient teacher and a perfectionist.\n\nIt was while working on that movie that she met Fats Waller, whom she continued to work for much of her career. In 1936, LeGon performed in the London production of C.B. Cochran’s At Home Abroad. She was hailed as one of the brightest spirits, the new Florence Mills, and the “sepia Cinderella girl who set London agog with her clever dancing.” In New York, she was one of the few women ever to be invited back to the Hoofer’s Club. LeGon played leading roles in a number of black films, where she claims, “sometimes I even got to be myself,” not a maid or any number of stereotypical roles. She toured widely with US Army shows, and she did club and theater performances nationally and internationally.\n\nIn a 1999 documentary by Grant Greshuck, LeGon’s extraordinary devotion to passing on tap dancing is as much a feature of the film as her stardom. Living in a Great Big Way, named for one of her famous numbers with Bill Robinson, is narrated by Fayard Nicholas, who reveres LeGon as a star performer and a gifted teacher who could “do it all.” LeGon says that sees teaching as a natural extension of her performing – “I’ve had a dance school all my life.” One envies those students for whom she clearly and still labors for the love of the form. Constance Valis Hill & Tony Waag\n\n2003 - Charles “Honi” Coles (2 April 1911-12 November 1992), tap dancer, raconteur, and veteran performer of the stage, vaudeville, television, and the concert world, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of George and Isabel Coles. He learned to tap dance on the streets of Philadelphia, where dancers challenged each other in time step \"cutting\" contests, and made his New York City debut at the Lafayette Theatre in 1931 as one of the Three Millers, a group that performed over-the-tops, barrel turns, and wings on six-foot-high pedestals. After discovering that his partners had hired another dancer to replace him, Coles retreated to Philadelphia, determined to perfect his technique. He returned to New York City in 1934, confident and skilled in his ability to cram several steps into a bar of music. Performing at the Harlem Opera House and Apollo Theatre, he was reputed to have the fastest feet in show business. And at the Hoofer's Club, where only the most serious tap dancers gathered to compete, he was hailed as one of the most graceful dancers ever seen. From 1936 to 1939 Coles performed with the Lucky Seven Trio, who tapped on large cubes that looked like dice; the group went through ten costume changes in the course of their act. Touring with the big swing bands of Count Basie and Duke Ellington, the 6’2” Coles polished his style, melding high-speed tapping with an elegant yet close-to-the-floor style where the legs and feet did the work. In 1940, as a soloist with Cab Calloway's orchestra, Coles met Charles \"Cholly\" Atkins, a jazz tap dancer who would later choreograph for the best rhythm-and-blues singing groups of the 1960s. Atkins was an expert wing dancer, while Coles's specialty was precision. They combined their talents after the War by forming the class act of Coles & Atkins. Wearing handsomely tailored suits, the duo opened with a fast-paced song-and-tap number, then moved into a precision swing dance and soft-shoe, finishing with a tap challenge in which each showcased his specialty. Their classic soft-shoe, danced to \"Taking a Chance on Love\" and played at an extremely slow tempo, was a nonchalant tossing off of smooth slides and gliding turns in crystal-cut precision. Coles performed speedy, swinging and rhythmically complex combinations in his solos, which anticipated the prolonged cadences of bebop that extended the duration of steps past the usual eight-bar phrase. In 1944 Coles married Marion Evelyn Edwards, a dancer in the Number One chorus at the Apollo Theatre; they had two children. Through the 1940s, Coles & Atkins appeared with the big bands of Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Charlie Barnet, Billy Eckstine, and Count Basie. In 1949, at the Ziegfeld Theatre in the Broadway musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, they stopped the show with the Jule Styne number, \"Mamie is Mimi,\" to which choreographer Agnes De Mille had added a ballet dancer. By the time the show closed in 1952 the big-band era was drawing to a close and a new style of ballet Broadway dance that integrated choreography into the musical plot became the popular form over tap dance. Though Coles in 1954-1955 opened the Dance Craft studio on fifty-second Street in New York City with tap dancer Pete Nugent, there was a steady decrease in the interest of tap dance in the 1950s. \"No work, no money. Tap had dropped dead,\" Coles remembered of that decade. Coles and Atkins broke up in 1960; and for the next sixteen years, Coles worked as production stage manager for the Apollo Theatre with duties that included introducing other acts. He served as president of the Negro Actors Guild and continued his association with the Copasetics, a tapping fraternity named in honor of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, which he had helped to found in 1949. At the Newport Jazz Festival in 1962 Coles was in the forefront of the tap revival that brought veteran members of the Copasetics back to the stage. In the early 1970s, he joined Brenda Bufalino in their duet concert of the Morton Gould Tap Concerto and toured the United States and England in their collaboration concert of Singin’ Swingin’ and Wingin’ where each contributed original musical compositions, monologs, and choreography. He joined the touring company of Bubblin' Brown Sugar performing the role of John Sage in 1976, and regained his stride as a soloist, performing at Carnegie Hall and Town Hall. After receiving a standing ovation for his performance in the Joffrey Ballet production of Agnes De Mille's \"Conversations on the Dance\", in 1978, Coles firmly placed tap dance in the world of concert dance. In 1983 at age seventy-two, he received the Tony Award, Fred Astaire Award, and Drama Desk Award for best featured actor and dancer in a musical for the Broadway hit, My One and Only, starring Tommy Tune. Jack Kroll in Newsweek called Coles \"Brilliant!\" in that musical, adding that his feet had \"the delicacy and power of a master pianist's hands.” Coles was a tap dancer of extraordinary elegance whose personal style and technical precision epitomized the class-act dancer. \"Honi makes butterflies look clumsy. He was my Fred Astaire,\" the singer Lena Horne said of Coles. The historian Sally Sommer wrote that Coles was \"a supreme illusionist he appeared to float and do nothing at all while his feet chattered complex rhythms below.\" He was also a master teacher who preached, \"If you can walk, you can tap.\" As an untiring advocate of tap dance, Coles often claimed that tap dance was the only dance art form that America could claim as its own. He was awarded the Dance Magazine Award in 1985, the Capezio Award for lifetime achievement in dance in 1988, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Coles last appeared as master of ceremonies at the Colorado Tap Festival with former partner Atkins, performing up to the end of a long and rhythmically brilliant career. He died in New York City. Coles has appeared in the films The Cotton Club and Dirty Dancing and the documentaries Great Feats of Feet, Charles “Honi” Coles - The Class Act of Tap, and Milt and Honi. Television shows include \"The Tap Dance Kid,\" \"Mr. Griffin and Me,\" \"Conversations in Dance,\" \"Charleston,\" \"Archives of a Master\" and Dance in America's \"Tap Dance in America\" for PBS. Coles & Atkins' classic Soft Shoe can be seen in the 1963 Camera Three television program, \"Over the Top with Bebop,\" narrated by jazz historian Marshall Stearns. The most descriptive material on Coles & Atkins includes Marshall and Jean Stearns' Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance (New York: Macmillan, 1968); and Jaqui Malone, \"Let the Punishment Fit the Crime: The Vocal Choreography of Cholly Atkins\" in Steppin' On The Blues (University of Illinois Press, 1996). Constance Valis Hill\n\n2003 - Chuck Green (6 November 1919-7 March 1997), jazz tap dancer, was born Charles Green in Fitzgerald, Georgia. As a young boy, he stuck bottle caps to the bottom of his bare feet and danced on the sidewalk for coins. At the age of six, he won third place in an amateur dance contest in which Noble Sissle was the bandleader, and soon thereafter toured the South as a child tap dancer. At the age of nine, he was spotted by a talent agent and taken to New York to study tap dance. Nat Nazzaro, known as the “monster agent” by those who knew of his practice of signing vulnerable young performers to ironclad contracts, signed Green to his own contract when he was twelve years old. A few years later, Green formed the team of Shorty and Slim with childhood friend James Walker, a talented comic dancer. They studied the great comedians of the day, picking up lines of patter from such shows on the black vaudeville circuit as Pigmeat Crack Shot and Hunter Pete and Repeate. “Their act was hilarious. Chuck was a natural-- so cute,” tap dancer Leonard Reed remembered, adding that Walker at the time was tall and skinny and Green was small as a chair. They did what was called “dumb talk comedy,” a rapid rhythmic banter that was interspersed between the songs and dances. As Walker played a broken-down vibraphone that looked as if it were falling apart, Green sang, “Some people was born to be doctors . . . some people were born to be kings . . . I fortunately was born to swing.” Then they tap danced, with Green making graceful turns and Walker excelling in leg-o-mania. Nazarro at the time also managed Buck and Bubbles (Ford Lee “Buck” Washington and John Sublett Bubbles). He suggested that Green and Walker study the singing-dancing-comedy team that had bypassed the black vaudeville Theatre Owners Booking Association (TOB.A) circuit to become headliners on the white vaudeville circuit; by 1922 they had played New York’s prestigious Palace Theatre. Changing the name of their act to Chuck and Chuckles, Green and Walker were groomed as a “juvenile act” to Buck and Bubbles. Bubbles soon took Green under his wing, calling him “the son I never had,” and offered to teach him what he knew, though it came in the form of a challenge. “Bubbles would do a step just once,” Green explained, “and then say, ‘you got one chance.’ He was a creator. They called him the ‘father of rhythm.’” Bubbles’ style of rhythm tapping--in which he loaded the bar (put many extra beats into a bar of music) and dropped his heels, hitting unusual accents and syncopations-- was revolutionary. He prepared for the new sound of bebop in the 1940s, and anticipated the prolonged melodic lines of Cool jazz in the 1950s. “If you dropped your heels, you could get a more floating quality, like a leaf coming off top of a tree,” said Green, who became a protege of Bubbles. “It changed the quality of the sound, gave it tonation.” Through the 1930s and early 1940s, Chuck and Chuckles toured Europe, Australia, and the United States, performing in such venues as Radio City Music Hall, the Paramount, Apollo, and Capital theatres. Jobs were plentiful and their manager had the team doubling up on performances. They averaged five stage shows a day, played nightclubs until early morning, and toured nonstop with big bands across the country and abroad. By 1944, the strain and wear of performing had taken its toll. The team of Chuck and Chuckles broke up, and Green was committed to a mental institution. When he was released some fifteen years later, he was changed-- extremely introverted and seemingly in a world of his own. His friends thought it a miracle he could still dance. By experimenting with the new harmonies, rhythmic patterns, and melodic approaches of the bop musicians, Green created his own bop-influenced style of rhythm tapping that was ad-libbed, up-tempo, and ultra cool. In the sixties, Green began again to perform on stage and television. He appeared with the Copasetics (a tap fraternity dedicated to the memory of Bill “Bojangles” Robinson) on the popular educational channel W.N.E. T. in a show hosted by Dick Cavett. On 6 July 1963 he performed at the Newport Jazz Festival as a member of the “Old Time Hoofers” with Honi Coles, Charles “Cookie” Cook, Ernest Brown, Pete Nugent, Cholly Atkins, and Baby Laurence. The show was introduced by jazz historian Marshall Stearns and marked the resurgence of tap dance in popular culture. At the New York’s Village Vanguard in 1964, the legendary tap dancer Groundhog faced Green in a tap challenge. “I’ve been waiting to battle Chuck Green for twenty years,” Groundhog told Stearns. “Dancing is like gang war and tonight I’m up against one of the best.” Groundhog’s rapid and syncopated staccato tapping was foiled by Green’s relaxed and fluid style of jazz tapping and almost dreamlike grace. In 1969 Green appeared with members of Harlem’s Hoofer’s Club for a series of “Tap Happenings” that were produced in New York City by Letitia Jay. Through seventies and eighties, Green continued to perform with the Copasetics. Host Honi Coles introduced him as, “Chuck Green, the greatest tap dancer in the world.” When asked why Green was bestowed that special title, Coles answered, “His slow dance is genius. Most dancers would fall on their face. His timing is like a musician’s.” In the late eighties, Green toured Europe with The Original Hoofers, appeared as a guest soloist at the Kennedy Center Honors, and was awarded an honorary professorship at Washington University. In New York in 1987, he began teaching a weekly two-hour tap class to a dedicated cross-section of New York’s top professional jazz dancers. With great clarity and precision, he led his students into the complexity of his material with warmth and ease, allowing the dancer to hear and feel the weight of the rhythm and movement. In the late eighties and early nineties, Green was twice honored with a New York Dance and Performance Award (the Bessies) for his innovative achievements and technical skill in dance, and for his work in Black and Blue (1989) on Broadway. Tall and big-footed, Green was a surprisingly light, graceful, and melodious rhythm dancer who was known for his specialty “strut” when he came on stage and for his tick-tock tap sounds. Whether dancing to such favorite tunes as “A Train” or “Caravan,” Green’s smooth and graceful rhythm tapping was uncluttered, even, and beautifully phrased. He has been called the “Poet of Tap.” In the “Green, Chaney, Buster, Slyde” number from the 1996 Broadway musical, Bring in ‘Da Noise, Bring in ‘Da Funk, Savion Glover celebrates Green as a master teacher who “was educatin’ people, not entertainin.’” “Chuck’s dancin’,” rapped Glover as he danced before a multi-paneled mirror, “was like, kind of slow. Every tap was clean, you know what I’m sayin’. You hear every tap. He was, just like, on the slow type, smooth type.” Chuck Green died in Oakland, California. The fluency of Green’s tap dancing is captured in George Niremberg’s documentary film, No Maps On My Taps (1980) with “Sandman” Sims and Bunny Briggs. His free-association poetry of speech is beautifully rendered in the film, About Tap (1987). His gentleness of spirit is immortalized in Masters of Tap (1983), a documentary film that also includes Honi Coles and Will Gaines. The sheer musicality of Green’s solo dancing is seen in the film Dance Black America (1984). Constance Valis Hill\n\n2004 - Gregory Hines (14 February 1946 - 9 August 2003), jazz tap dancer, singer, actor, musicians, and creator of improvised tap choreography, was born in New York City, the son of Maurice Hines Sr. and Alma Hines. He began dancing at the age of not-quite-three, turned professional at age five, and for fifteen years performed with his older brother Maurice as The Hines Kids, making nightclub appearances across the country. While Broadway teacher and choreographer Henry LeTang created the team's first tap dance routines, the brothers' absorption of technique came from watching and working with the great black tap masters whenever and wherever they performed at the same theaters. They practically grew up backstage at the Apollo Theatre, where they were witness to the performances and the advice of such tap dance legends as Charles \"Honi\" Coles, Howard \"Sandman\" Sims, the Nicholas Brothers, and Teddy Hale (Gregory's personal source of inspiration). Gregory and Maurice then grew into the Hines Brothers. When Gregory was eighteen, he and Maurice were joined by their father, Maurice Sr., on drums, becoming Hines, Hines and Dad. They toured internationally and appeared frequently on The Tonight Show, but the younger Hines was restless to get away from the non-stop years on the road, so he left the group in his early twenties and \"retired\" (so he said) to Venice, California. For a time he left dancing behind, exploring alternatives that included his forming a jazz-rock band called Severence. He released an album of original songs in 1973. When Hines moved back to New York City in the late 1970s, he immediately landed a role in The Last Minstrel Show. The show closed in Philadelphia, but launched him back into the performing arts, and just a month later came Eubie (1978) a certified Broadway hit, which earned him the first of four Tony nominations. Comin' Uptown (1980), though not a success, led to another nomination and Sophisticated Ladies (1981) to a third. In 1992, Hines received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his riveting portrayal of the jazz man Jelly Roll Morton in George C. Wolfe's production of Jelly's Last Jam, sharing a Tony nomination for choreography for that show with Hope Clark and Ted Levy. Hines made his initial transition from dancer/singer to film actor in Mel Brooks' hilarious The History of the World, Part I (1981), playing the role of a Roman Slave, that in one scene sees him sand-dancing in the desert. He followed that in quick succession with Wolfen, an allegorical mystery directed by Michael Wadleigh that is now a cult hit; in it, Hines played the role of a coroner. In 1984, he starred in Francis Ford Coppola's film, The Cotton Club (1984). Vincent Canby in The New York Times wrote about Hines' rare screen presence in the film: \"He doesn't sneak up on you. He's so laid back, so self assured and so graceful, whether acting as an ambitious hoofer or tap dancing, alone or in tandem with his brother, Maurice, that he forces YOU to sneak up on HIM. The vitality and comic intelligence that have made him a New York favorite in Eubie and Sophisticated Ladies translate easily to the screen.\" The film was a seamless blend of dance into the framework of the narrative. The fierce virtuosity of Hines' dancing is seen in the White Nights (1985), in which he played an American defector to the Soviet Union opposite Mikhail Baryshnikov, playing Russian defector to the United States. \"I haven't had a terribly traumatic experience as a black person in this world, but I've had experiences,\" Hines told Michael J. Bandler about the film. \"My nature is to let them go--I wasn't going to be burdened with a negative attitude. So for White Nights I had to dig, but the pain was there.\" In 1988, Hines starred in a film that combined his penchant for both dance and drama, Tap. With full-scale production numbers filmed on location in New York City and Hollywood, and with an original soundtrack created especially for the look and style of the film, Tap became the first dance musical to merge tap dancing with contemporary rock and funk musical styles. It also featured a host of tap legends, including Sandman Sims, Bunny Briggs, Steve Condos, Harold Nicholas and Hines' co-star and show business mentor, Sammy Davis, Jr. Hines' extensive and varied film resume includes teaming with Billy Crystal in director Peter Hyam's hit comedy, Running Scared, and the next year with Willem Dafoe, in Southeast Asia, in the military thriller Off Limits. He starred in William Friedkin's dark comedy, Deal of the Century, with Sigourney Weaver and Chevy Chase; Penny Marshall's military comedy, Renaissance Man, co-starring Danny DeVito; The Preacher's Wife with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston, once again with director Penny Marshall; Waiting to Exhale, with Angela Bassett and Whitney Houston for director Forest Whittaker, and Good Luck, with co-star Vincent D'Onofrio. He also appeared in the offbeat ensemble comedy, Mad Dog Time, with Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Gabriel Byrne, and Richard Dreyfuss. In 1994, Hines expanded his talents to include the role of film director. His directorial debut was the independent feature, Bleedings Hearts, shot on location in New York. A contemporary romantic drama, it explored the precarious relationship between a thirty-year-old, white, male radical and a black, female high school student. Hines work in television is equally diverse. In 1989, he created and hosted Gregory Hines Tap Dance in America, a PBS television special that featured veteran tap dancers, established tap dance companies, and next generation of tap dancers. The film was nominated for an Emmy award, as was his performance on Motown Returns to the Apollo. On the USA Network, Hines starred with Annette O'Toole in the critically acclaimed original film, White Lies, based on the novel Louisiana Black by Samuel Charters. He also starred on TNT with Christopher Lloyd in Lewis Teague's T-Bone and Weazel; with Sinbad, James Coburn and Burt Reynolds in the comedy western, The Cherokee Kid; with Judd Hirsch and F. Murray Abraham in Showtime's urban drama, The Color of Justice; on CBS-TV with Jean Smart in the thriller, A Stranger in Town; on the USA Network in the psychological thriller, Dead Air, and in Subway Series, the anthology-style film series for HBO directed by Ted Demme. Hines made his television series debut in 1998, playing Ben Stevenson, a loving single father hesitantly re-entering the dating world on CBS-TV series, The Gregory Hines Show. As Ben Doucette, he made up part of the gifted ensemble that won NBC an Emmy Award for Best Comedy Series in 2000 for Will and Grace. He also earned an Emmy Nomination as Outstanding Lead in a Miniseries or Movie for his portrayal on Showtime of the legendary and groundbreaking dancer/film star Bill Robinson in Bojangles, and also starred in the ABC/Touchstone mid season television series, Lost At Home. For three years, Hines was the voice of \"Big Bill\" on Bill Cosby's animated series for Nickelodeon, Little Bill. He voiced and sang one of the key characters (alongside Eartha Kitt, Patti LaBelle and Vanessa Williams) in the Fox TV/Coca Cola animated musical special, Santa Baby. He made his television directorial debut with The Red Sneakers, for Showtime, and also appeared in the film, which centers on a 17 year-old high school student--more mathematician than athlete--who becomes a basketball sensation through the gift of a magical pair of sneakers. Throughout an amazingly varied career, Hines continued to be a tireless advocate for tap in America. In 1988, he lobbied successfully for the creation of National Tap Dance Day, now celebrated in 40 cities in the United States and in eight other nations. He was on the Board of Directors of Manhattan Tap, the Jazz Tap Ensemble, and the American Tap Foundation (formerly the American Tap Dance Orchestra). He was a generous artist and teacher, conscious of his role as a model for such tap dance artists as Savion Glover, Dianne Walker, Ted Levy, and Jane Goldberg, creating such tap choreographies as Groove (1998) for the Jazz Tap Ensemble, and Boom for the 1997 Gala for President and Mrs. Bill Clinton, filmed for (ABC) at the Ford Theater in Washington D.C. Like a jazz musician who ornaments a melody with improvisational riffs, Hines improvised within the frame of the dance. His \"improvography\" demanded the percussive phrasing of a composer, the rhythms of a drummer, and the lines of a dancer. While being the inheritor of the tradition of black rhythm tap, he was also a proponent of the new. \"He purposely obliterated the tempos,\" wrote tap historian Sally Sommer, \"throwing down a cascade of taps like pebbles tossed across the floor. In that moment, he aligned tap with the latest free-form experiments in jazz and new music and postmodern dance.\" The New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff described Hines' performance in 1995: \"Visual elegance, as always, yields to aural power. The complexity of sound grows in intensity and range.” In addition to his work on the dance and theatre stage, in film and on television, Hines' wide-ranging career also included making a 1987 album called Gregory Hines, and writing introductions for books Brotherhood in Rhythm: The Jazz Tap Dancing of the Nicholas Brothers by Constance Valis Hill, and Savion! My Life in Tap, a biography by Mr. Glover for children. Everything Hines did was influenced by his dancing, as he told Stephen Holden in a 1988 interview with The New York Times: \"Everything I do,\" he said, including \"my singing, my acting, my lovemaking, my being a parent.\" He died in Los Angeles at the age of fifty-seven. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2004 - Donald David Dixon Ronald O’Connor (1925-2003), the comedic song-and-dance man who inherited and perpetuated a classic tradition of vaudeville tap dancing, was born in Chicago, Illinois into an Irish theatrical family. His father, John Edward “Chuck” O’Connor, was an acrobat with Ringling-Barnum and Bailey Circus; and his mother, Effie, was a circus bareback rider and dancer. When they graduated from circus into vaudeville, all their children (seven were born, three died in infancy) were initiated into “The O’Connor Family,” billed as “The Royal Family of Vaudeville.” O’Connor made his first stage appearance at three days old, lying onstage across a piano bench beside his mother who, not yet ready to return to heavy dancing, played the piano. At thirteen months old, he began making $25 a week dancing the Black Bottom and faking acrobatic tricks. He made his film debut at age eleven dancing an uncredited \"specialty routine\" with brothers Jack and Billy in the 1937 Warner Brothers musical, Melody for Two. Like most child performers who grew up in show business, he learned to dance by watching the hundreds of musical acts on stage and screen, making tap comedy dance and acrobatic tricks his specialty. He received no formal training in tap dance until he went to work for Universal Pictures and took tap dance classes with the studio’s choreographer Louis DaPron who, after a few weeks of classes exasperatedly pronounced him “un-teachable.” Unabashed, O’Connor developed his own style of tap dancing drawn from experience in vaudeville. He also developed as an actor, played a number of juvenile and super- polite boy roles such as Bing Crosby’s kid brother in Sing, You Sinners (1938), Huckleberry Finn in Tom Sawyer, Detective (1938), and Beau (Gary Cooper) at age twelve in the dashing Foreign Legion action adventure film, Beau Geste (1939). O’Connor is also seen briefly dancing a vaudeville-styled tap routine as one of the three Dancing Dolans in the 1939 Warner Brother’s musical On Your Toes, choreographed by George Balanchine. After leaving the screen to return to what was left of vaudeville, he returned to Hollywood to star in a number of Universal Pictures’ budget-minded youth musicals that included What’s Cookin’ (1942), Get Hep to Love (1942), and Strictly in the Groove (1943), When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1942), It Comes Up Love (1943), Mr. Big (1943), Top Man (1943), The Merry Monahans (1944), and Bowery to Broadway (1944). He was often cast as a brash and energetic young man during World War II, and paired with the equally energetic actress and tap dancer, Peggy Ryan. O’Connor’s postwar musicals include Are You With It? (1948), Feudin’, Fussin’ and A-Fightin’ (1948), and Yes, Sir, That’s My Baby (1949); and these led to Francis (1949), a potboiler about an Army private who finds he is the only person who can carry on a conversation with an otherwise taciturn mule; the film proved to be a big hit with the kids and led to five sequels. In the 1950s, O’Connor reestablished himself as a comedic actor and tap dancer. As Cosmo Brown, the sidekick chum of Gene Kelly in the classic musical (which spoofed the dawn of talking pictures), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), O’Connor’s gravity-defying, largely improvised rendition of “Make ‘Em Laugh” is considered one of the funniest in the history of the movies. That number, along with the cheerily-strutted “Good Morning,” danced with Debbie Reynolds and Kelly, and the vaudeville-inspired “Fit As a Fiddle (And Ready for Love)” danced with Kelly, rewarded him with a Golden Globe Award (over Kelly) for his performance. After the success of Singin’ in the Rain, MGM fashioned a starring vehicle for O’Connor in I Love Melvin (1953), in which he danced on roller skates. In the Twentieth Century-Fox film, Call Me Madam (1953), O’Connor dances a lyrical duet (one of his all time favorites) with Vera Ellen; and in There’s No Business Like Show Business (1954), there is the infamous scene in which he kisses co-star Marilyn Monroe. In the mid-fifties, Paramount Pictures cast him in the film adaptation of the Broadway tap dance musical Anything Goes (1956) with Bing Crosby and Mitzi Gaynor. With the decline of the studio system by the end of the decade, O’Connor launched himself into the television industry. He became one of the rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour and starred in three different incarnations of The Donald O’Connor Show for NBC in 1951 and 1954-55, for which he was nominated for an Emmy (1952) and received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Personality (1953). One of O’Connor’s most memorable moments tap dancing on television is The Bell Telephone Hour’s “Song and Dance Man.” Broadcast on NBC-TV (January 16, 1966), this mini-musical history of tap dance in America opened with O’Connor as host dancing an Irish jig, Scottish reel, Spanish zapateada, and German spatlasse, followed by a softshoe dance and some sand dancing. And culminated with a challenge dance with O’Connor and the Nicholas Brothers (Fayard and Harold) trading and one-upping on tap steps. In some of the best dance television camera work to date, O’Connor joined the brothers in “Cute,” a medium tempo swing tune by Neal Hefti in which he tapped out feather-light shuffles and heel-clicks. The vaudeville-inspired routine finished with the three dancers sitting on pedestals to fake Russian-styled kazotsky kicks, twirling through sets of barrel turns, and performing in-the-trenches, and double and triple turns; in the typical decelerated ending, they strode upstage, turned around, and sat back down on their pedestals with folded arms. In 1971, after suffering a heart attack, O’Connor devoted considerably energy to composing music for the concert hall. He also performed a number of cameo roles on film, among them as the vaudevillian and dance instructor in the film Ragtime (1981 and the dreamy-eyed toy manufacturer in Robin Williams’ film, Toys (1992). In 1993, O’Connor released his own exercise-oriented video, Let’s Tap. In 1998, O’Connor signed on for The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies, headlining a revue featuring 54-year-old-plus performers, and signing and dancing his way through eight performances a week. Through the end of his career, he lived, true to his word: “I was born and raised to entertain other people. I’ve heard laughter and applause and known a lot of sorrow. Everything about me is based on show business. I think is will bring me happiness. I hope so.” O’Connor will be remembered as “The Last Song and Dance Man.” The title, once proposed for an autobiographical stage play he was preparing, is apropos for a man who so knew how to create magic and delight as an entertainer. “I’m an illusionist—a trickster who quick chances before your eyes,” he admitted in 1992. “I capture your attention without giving you time to think about it. I move fast, I keep changing my hats. And the more pleased an audience is, the more energy I give back to the audience.” He died in Calabasas, California on September 27, 2003. Constance Valis Hill & Tony Waag\n\n2004 - Ann Miller (1923-2004) The raven-haired, long-legged dancer whose athleticism and machine-gun taps won her stardom during the golden age of movie musicals, was born Johnnie Lucille Collier in Chireno, Texas on April 12, 1923. Her father, John Alfred Collier, who named her, was a well-known criminal lawyer who defended such infamous gangsters as Baby Face Nelson, Bonnie Parker, and Clyde Barrow; her mother, Clara Birdwell, was a Cherokee. When the Colliers moved to Houston, her mother saw to it that she studied piano and violin, but mostly tap dancing, partly to build up legs that had been affected by rickets, a condition caused by a vitamin D deficiency that can lead to softening of the bones and deformity. When her parents divorced at the age of nine, she moved to California with her mother, calling herself Annie and soon after adopting the stage name, Ann Miller. There she developed a dance routine she performed at meetings of local civic organizations, earning five dollars a night plus tips, and was able to support her mother. After watching Broadway Melody of 1936 (1935), starring the brilliant tap dancer Eleanor Powell, Miller turned her attention to sharpening her tap dance skills on the suggestion of her mother, who told her that if she practiced a bit more, she could be a dancer of the same quality. A few years later, she was spotted by the talent scout Benny Rubin, who had been escorting Lucille Ball. They arranged a movie audition, which led to her first film, a non-speaking part in New Faces of 1937 for RKO. With her vibrant personality, great legs and dazzling style of tap dancing, RKO awarded Miller a seven-year contract at the age of thirteen (she claimed to be eighteen), and would later insure her legs for $1,000,000. She was such a remarkable young talent that at age fourteen she played Ginger Rogers’ dancing partner in the film Stage Door (1937), which also featured Katherine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Lucille Ball and Eve Arden. A year later, she was borrowed by Columbia Pictures to appear with James Stewart and Jean Arthur as Essie Carmichael, the fudge-making, ballet-dancing daughter in Frank Capra’s You Can’t Take It With You, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1938. Back at R.K.O., she played the role of Hilda in the Marx Brothers’ film Room Service (1938), and in 1939 made her smashing Broadway debut in George White’s Scandals, which she played for two years. In the late forties and fifties, Miller was signed by MGM to star in its most memorable musical films. In Easter Parade (1948), she danced most gracefully with Fred Astaire (she was considerably taller than he and had to wear ballet slippers) as she tried to woo him away from Judy Garland; but it was her singing and tap dancing solo, “Chasing the Blues Away,” that she claims as one of the best song and tap dances on musical film. In On the Town (1949), she was paired with Jules Munshin, the sidekick of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, all three sailors desperately looking for girls on their 24-hour leave in New York. In Kiss Me Kate (MGM 1953) she portrayed Lois Lane, the nightclub hoofer who becomes Bianca in Cole Porter’s version of William Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew; belting out the “I’m A Maiden” number in the film, she struts and sashays around the male chorus (which includes Bob Fosse) with flirtatious brazen, interspersing a machine-gun rattle of taps to punctuate the lyrics. Other MGM musical films of note included Texas Carnival (1951), Lovely to Look At (1952), a remake of Jerome Kern’s Roberta, Small Town Girl (1953), Deep in My Heart (1954), Hit the Deck (1955), and the role of Gloria Dell in The Opposite Sex (1956). By the late 1950s, Miller moved from movies to nightclubs and also appeared frequently on such television programs as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Hollywood Palace, and Laugh-In. In 1969, she scored a Broadway triumph when she took on the title role in Mame, renewed energy to the role originated by Angela Lansbury. Miller continued to work even while jobs were scarce. In the early 1970s on television, she was seen dancing atop an eight-foot soup can in the Busby Berkeley-inspired TV ads for Heinz’s Great American Soups, which were choreographed by Danny Daniels. She also went on the road with touring companies of Can-Can, Panama Hattie, Hello Dolly! and Blithe Spirit. Miller’s greatest Broadway triumph came in 1979 when she wowed audiences with her tap dancing while starring with Mickey Rooney in Sugar Babies, a musical salute to vaudeville. The show ran for nearly three years on Broadway and several years on tour and abroad, and earned her a Tony Award nomination, the George M. Cohen Award for Best Female Entertainer (1980), the Sarah Siddons Award for Best Performer of the Year (1984), and a Laurence Olivier Award nomination in (1989). In 1992, Miller was honored with a Life Time Achievement Award by the University of Southern California; in 1993, the Gypsy Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Dance Society of America; and in 1994 the Flo-Bert Award from the New York Committee to Celebrate Tap Dance. Her tap shoes, which she called Moe and Joe, are exhibited in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She has also written two books, Miller’s Highlife, an autobiography, and Tapping Into the Force, about her psychic abilities. Her performance in David Lynch’s Mullholland Drive in 2001 marked nearly seventy years in the movies. She died on January 22, 2004 in Los Angeles, California. In her heyday, Miller was America’s leading female tap dance star, inheriting the mantle from Eleanor Powell. She preferred a vigorous approach to dancing that was athletic and speedy, and claimed to be able to dance at 500 taps per minute, which no one disputed. While she will be remembered in the popular imagination as a raven-haired, long legged tap dancer with the lacquered raven hair and Nefertiti eye makeup, the tap world will forever celebrate her dazzling and gutsy style of tap dancing that was as brassy and good-hearted as the showgirl roles she played in her films. Melding glamour and razzmatazz with speedy precision, Miller came as close to hoofing in high-heels as any female dancer in the history of the movie musical. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2005 - Sammy Davis, Jr. (8 December 1925-16 May 1990), singer, dancer, actor, and musician (who played vibraphone trumpet, and drums), was born on December 8, 1925 to the Puerto-Rican-born tap dancer Elvera \"Baby\" Sanchez, and Sammy Davis, Sr., an African-American vaudevillian who was the lead dancer in Will Mastin's Holiday in Dixieland. As an infant, he was raised by his paternal grandmother, Rosa B. (\"Mama\") Davis, in an apartment on 140th Street and Eighth Avenue in New York City. When he was three years-old his parents separated and his father, not wanting to lose custody of his son, took him on tour. As a child, \"little Sammy\" learned to dance from his father and his adopted \"Uncle\" Will, who led the dance troupe his father worked for. In 1929 at the age of four, Davis joined the act, which was re-named the Will Mastin Trio, and toured the vaudeville circuit, accompanying his elders with flash tap dance routines. Called \"Poppa\" by his father and \"Mose Gastin\" by Uncle Will, he traveled and performed with the Mastin troupe, taking time off to make his motion picture debut in Rufus Jones for President (1933), a black short subject two-reeler filmed at Brooklyn's Warner studios, in which he played a little boy who falls asleep in the lap of his mother (Ethel Waters) and dreams of being elected President of the United States. Small and slightly-built, he was dubbed \"Silent Sam, the Dancing Midget\" and became phenomenally popular with audiences. He was reportedly tutored by his idol Bill Robinson, from whom he took tap dance lessons. In short time, the act was renamed Will Mastin's Gang, Featuring Little Sammy; and still later, The Will Mastin Trio, Featuring Sammy Davis Jr.\" In 1942 at the age of eighteen Davis was drafted into the Army where he encountered, he says for the first time, blatant racial prejudice, which he countered with his fists. \"Overnight the world looked different,\" he later wrote. \"It wasn't one color anymore. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a swinging door for eighteen years, a door which they had always secretly held open.\" He was subsequently transferred to Special Services where he performed in army camps across the country, \"gorging\" himself on \"the joy of being liked,\" as he wrote in his 1965 autobiography, Yes I Can. He writes that he combed every audience for \"haters,\" and when he spotted one he would give his performance an extra burst of strength and energy because he \"had to get those guys,\" to neutralize them and make them acknowledge him. \"My talent was the weapon, the power, the way for me to fight,\" he wrote. \"It was the one way I might hope to affect a man's thinking.\" In 1946, upon being discharged from the Army, he rejoined the Will Mastin Trio and perfected his performance by doing flash-styled tap dancing and impressions of popular screen stars and singers, playing trumpet and drums, and singing to the accompaniment of Sammy, Sr. and Uncle Will's soft-shoe and tap as background. He also recorded some songs for Capitol Records and one of them, a rendition of \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" was chosen the 1946 Record of the year by Metronome magazine, which also named him the year's \"Most Outstanding New Personality.\" The addition of comedy and tap dancing brought new life to the group, so by the beginning of the next decade they were headlining venues including New York's Capitol club and Ciro's in Hollywood. It was in this period that Davis met Frank Sinatra, who was then with Tommy Dorsey's band, and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson; the popular \"Mr. Bojangles\" tune, written by Jerry Jeff Walker and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, later became a standard song in Davis' act. By 1952, at the invitation of Frank Sinatra, the group played the newly-integrated Copacabana in New York. In 1954, Davis signed a recording contract with Decca Records, topping the charts with his debut LP Starring Sammy Davis, Jr., and another LP, Just for Lovers. After recovering from the loss of an eye in a car accident, he continued to score a series of hit singles including \"Something's Gotta Give,\" \"Love Me or Leave Me,\" and \"That Old Black Magic,\" and \"Too Close for Comfort.\" After a succession of successful club appearances, Davis he made his Broadway debut in 1956, with Sam Sr. and Will, in Mr. Wonderful, a musical comedy that was created just for him. He made his solo debut on television on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and did some serious acting in episodes of the \"General Electric Theatre\" and \"The Dick Powell Show.\" In 1965 on the \"Patty Duke Show\" he played himself in \"Will the Real Sammy Davis Please Stand Up?\" Meanwhile, his recordings were making records--\"Hey There,\" \"Birth of the Blues,\" The Lady Is a Tramp,\" \"Candy Man,\" \"Gonna Build a Mountain,\" and \"Who Can I Turn To?\" In 1958 he played the role of a jive-talking sailor in the film Anna Lucasta; and in 1959 played the mischievous Sportin' Life in the screen version of Porgy and Bess. In the 1960s, Davis became an official member of the so-called Rat Pack, a loose confederation of actors, comedians, and singers that included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford. They appeared together in several movies, including Robin and the Seven Hoods and the original Ocean's Eleven. After achieving success by refusing to work at venues that upheld racial segregation, his demands expanded and eventually led to the integration of Miami Beach nightclubs and Las Vegas casinos. But he continued to press buttons. In 1960, when he married the Swedish-born actress May Britt, interracial marriages were forbidden by law in 31 US states out of 50 (it was not until 1967 that those laws were abolished by the US Supreme Court). The couple had one daughter and adopted two sons. In 1966, he was given the role of a television series host in The Sammy Davis, Jr. Show. After divorcing in 1968, Davis began dating Altovise Gore, a young and talented dancer in one of his shows; they were wed in 1970 by the Reverend Jesse Jackson and remained married until Davis' death. While he remained a multi-talented performer, Davis was revered as a proponent and popularizer of tap dance, performing in his own shows, such as Sammy and Company (1975) and Sammy Davis, Jr. the Golden Years (1980). In 1988, he co-starred with Gregory Hines as the patriarchal master of tap dance in the movie Tap! Hines, who worshipped Davis, paid homage to him, in the television special Sammy Davis Jr. 60th Anniversary Show (1990), in a tap solo after which he called onto the stage to dance and trade steps, and in the end, bent down and kissed Davis's feet. Davis died soon after in Beverly Hills, California from complications due to throat cancer, a result of his many years of smoking. Davis will be remembered throughout his career as one of the world's greatest entertainers, as a remarkably popular and versatile performer equally adept at acting, singing, dancing and impersonations -- in short, a variety artist in the classic tradition. He is among the very first African-American performers to find favor with audiences on both sides of the color barrier, and remains a perennial icon of cool, which could also be said of his tap dancing -- quick-fired with crystal clarity and rhythmically swinging flourishes of flash. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2005 - Peg Leg Bates (October 11, 1907-December 8, 1998) was born Clayton Bates in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, the son of Rufus Bates, a laborer, and Emma Steward Bates, a sharecropper and housecleaner. He began dancing when he was five. At twelve, while working in a cotton-seed gin mill, he caught and mangled his left leg in a conveyor belt. The leg was amputated on his kitchen table at his home. Though he was left with only one leg and a wooden peg leg his uncle carved for him, Bates resolved to continue dancing. \"It somehow grew in my mind that I wanted to be as good a dancer as any two-legged dancer,\" he called. \"It hurt me that the boys pitied me. I was pretty popular before, and I still wanted to be popular. I told them not to feel sorry for me.\" He meant it. He began imitating the latest rhythm steps he saw dancers of metal-tap shoe dancers, adding his own novelty and acrobatic steps into the taps. He worked his way from minstrel shows and carnivals to the vaudeville circuits. Relearning how to dance with his wooden peg leg, Bates worked his way upward from minstrel shows and carnivals to the vaudeville circuits. At fifteen, after having become the undisputed king of one-legged dancers, able to execute acrobatic, graceful soft shoe, and powerful rhythm-tapping all with one leg and a peg, he established a professional career as a tap dancer. In 1930, after dancing in the Paris version of Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1929, Bates returned to New York to perform as a featured tap dancer at such famous Harlem nightclubs as the Cotton Club, Connie's Inn, and the Club Zanzibar. On Broadway in the 1930s, he reinvented such popular tap steps as the Shim Sham Shimmy, Susie-Q, and Truckin' by enhancing them with the rhythmic combination of his deep-toned left-leg peg and the high-pitched metallic right-foot tap. As one of the black tap dancers able to cross the color barrier, Bates joined performers on the white vaudeville circuit of Keith & Lowe and performed on the same bill as Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Fred Astaire, and Gene Kelly. In 1949 Bates sang and danced the role of the swashbuckling pirate, Long John Silver in the musical review Blackouts. \"Don't give up the ship, although you seem to lose the fight; life means do the best with all you got, give it all your might,\" he sang in the Ken Murray musical that played for three years at the Hollywood and Vine Theatre in Hollywood, California. Wearing a white suit and looking as debonair as Astaire, Bates made his first television appearance in 1948 on This Is Show Business (a show hosted by Clifford Fatiman and Arlene Francis), performing high-speed paddle-and-roll tapping and balancing on his rubber-tipped peg as if it were a ballet pointe shoe. On the Ed Sullivan Show in 1955, Bates strutted his stuff as he competed in a tap challenge dance, countering Hal LeRoy's wiggly steps with airy wing-steps. \"You're not making it easy,\" Bates chided, as he tossed off heel clicks and soared into a flash finish with Trenches (his body leaning forward on the diagonal and the legs kicking high to the back). Bates made over twenty appearances on the Ed Sullivan Television Show, last appearing in a tap challenge dance with \"Little Buck\" on August 22, 1965. While television gave him greater notoriety than ever before, Bates continued to pursue a variety of performance venues. In1951 he invested his earnings and with his wife, Alice, purchased a large turkey farm in New York's Catskill Mountains and converted it into a resort. The date of his marriage to Alice is not known; it lasted until her death in 1987. They had one child.) The Peg Leg Country Club, in Kerhonkson, New York flourished as the largest black-owned-and-operated resort in the country, catering to black clientele and featuring hundreds of jazz musicians and tap dancers. \"During the prejudice years, country clubs were not integrated,\" said Bates, \"and I started thinking how blacks might like to have a country resort just like any other race of people.\" After selling the property in 1989, Bates continued to perform and teach. He appeared before youth groups, senior citizens, and handicapped groups, spreading his philosophy of being involved no matter what life's adversities and encouraging youngsters to be drug-free and to pursue an education. \"Life means, do the best you can with what you've got, with all your mind and heart. You can do anything in this world if you want to do it bad enough,\" he often said. Bates' tap dancing was melodically and rhythmically enhanced by the combination of his deep-toned peg, made of leather and rubber-tipped, and the higher-pitched metallic tap shoe. He was also accomplished in acrobatics, flash (executing spectacularly difficult steps involving virtuosic aerial maneuvers) and novelty dancing. He consistently proved himself beyond his peg-legged specialty, surpassing other two-legged dancers to become one of the finest rhythm dancers in the history of tap dancing. In 1992, Bates was Master of Ceremonies at the National Tap Dance Day Celebration in Albany, New York, where he received a Distinguished Leadership in the Arts Award. In 1991, Bates was honored with the Flo-Bert Award by the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day. He died in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, just a mile and a half from the place where he lost his leg. Constance Valis Hill\n\n2006 - Bunny Briggs (February 26, 1922- ) Dubbed by Duke Ellington as \"the most superleviathonic, rhythmaturgically-syncopated tapsthamaticianisamist,” Bunny Briggs says he was born dancing: “When I finally faced the world my legs were kickin’. They let me loose, and I just started dancin’. Just started right out dancin’. And been dancing ever since.” He was born on Lenox Avenue and 138th Street in Harlem, New York. At the age of three his mother took him to the Lincoln Theatre to see his aunt Gladys, who was a chorus girl. After seeing the dapper Bill Robinson perform at the Lincoln he rushed home to say, “Mamma, I want to be a tap dancer,” and proceeded to show her the steps from the routine that Robinson performed. Absorbing tap dance on the streets of his neighborhood, he was soon organized into Porkchops, Navy, Rice, and Beans, a kiddie dance group that performed in ballrooms around the city to such tunes as “Bugle Call Blues.” In the early 1930s, after being discovered by pianist and orchestra leader Luckey Roberts, he joined Roberts’ Society Entertainers and by the age of eight began performing in the homes and mansions of some of America’s wealthiest people, performing for New York's Four Hundred: the Astors, Wanamakers and Vanderbilts. When he was twenty in the early forties he began touring with the big swing bands of Earl Hines, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Charley Barnet and Count Basie, able migrate from band to band because he was musically versatile and could improvise. With the influence and help of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, Briggs adapted his style to bebop. He also created his own style of paddle-and-roll tapping that combined pantomime. “I was always an improvisation dancer,” he told Rusty Frank. “ I never danced to the same tune more than two or three times. My style is carefree. It’s carefree and hard, but I try to make it look easy.” Writes Brenda Bufalino about Briggs, “There was never any problem keeping Bunny on stage. He kept dancing his riff- walks and quick turns, flipping his head, and whipping his hair. He stopped short to give the audience a chance to applaud in the middle of his solo, and finally, when he brought the whole house to its feet, he would walk over to the microphone and tell them how much he loved them.” After appearing at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1960 with the Duke Ellington band, Briggs became known as \"Duke's dancer\" was the chosen soloist in Ellington’s Concert of Sacred Dance, in “David Danced Before the Lord,” which premiered at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco (September 16, 1965); he was also the soloist for the East Coast premiere of Concert of Sacred Music at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (December 26, 1966) in New York. Briggs also took part, along with along with Baby Laurence, Honi Coles, Pete Nugent, and Cholly Atkins, in the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival in a landmark concert which marked the ascendancy of tap dance in popularity. Jazz critic Whitney Balliett described Briggs in that concert as an “airborne dancer whose steps and motions are an exquisite balance of comic exaggeration and almost fussy precision. In the paddle-and-roll, he began with a long sequence of abrupt, irregular heel beats, punctuated by silences and quick, stiff head-and-arm motions, broke into a barrage of military-type flam strokes, and settled into soft, dizzying heel-and-toe beats (his torso and head now motionless) that carried him smoothly all over the seemingly ice-coated stage.” On television in the 1950s Briggs appeared on Cavalcade of Bands; in 1960s he performed on the Ed Sullivan Show; and in the 1970s Johnny Carson shows, as well as such TV specials as Apollo Uptown and Monk's Time. During the 1970s and 1980s he danced aboard tour ships; and toured Europe in the 1980s with The Hoofers (which included Jimmy Slyde, Lon Chaney, Sandman Sims, Chuck Green) In 1989 he was one of he featured dancers in PBS/Great Performance’s Tap Dance in America, and was one of three hoofers (Briggs, Howard “Sandman” Sims and Chuck Green) whose biographies are documented in the film No Maps On My Taps (1979). He also appeared with such tap veterans as Sammy Davis, Jr., Harold Nicholas, Arthur Duncan, Jimmy Slyde, and Sandman Sims, presented in the 1989 film, Tap, starring Gregory Hines. In the last half of the 1980s, Briggs performed in Europe with Sweet Saturday Night, and on Broadway in My One and Only (1983) and Black and Blue (1989), also appearing in the 1992 television documentary about Black and Blue, directed by Robert Altman. “Some people ask me about my sound,” Briggs explained to Rusty Frank. “And I’ve been blessed in so many ways, because I danced in the streets, I danced in hallways, I danced in hot-dog stands, and I danced for society. When I would work for the society people, they would have a good time, but soft. . . they’d have a beautiful time.” One of Briggs’ most significant moments of accomplishment was in a small nightclub in Staten Island called the Moulin Rouge, when he asked couples in the audience to put their arms around each other as he tap-danced. Dimming the lights in the club, he said to the audience, “This is the first and last time I’ll ask for this. I don’t want no applause. Just stay like that.” He danced two choruses of a soft-shoe to “I’ll Be Loving You, Always,” and when he finished he just walked off the stage, leaving the lights low as the men continued kissin’ and hugging their partners. “And that to me was the greatest compliment I’ve ever had. It was just beautiful.” In 2002, Briggs received an honorary doctorate of Performing Arts in American Dance by the Oklahoma City University (2002). Constance Valis Hill\n\n2007 - Eddie Brown (July 27, 1915 - Dec 28, 1992) Superlative rhythm tap dancer known for clarity of taps, complexity of phrasing, and rippling musicality, was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He learned to dance at an early age from his uncle who was a flash dancer. “Everything I did was up tempo, home again and down, and I could do twelve choruses,” he recalled. At the age of sixteen he was discovered by Bill Robinson at a tap dance contest held in his hometown; with 37 contestants, when he was called to the stage and asked him what music he wanted, Brown requested Robinson’s signature tune, “Doin’ the New Lowdown,” and proceeded to duplicate the steps that he had heard Robinson perform on record and in performance. Upon winning first prize in the contest, Robinson spoke to Brown’s parents and asked to take the boy to New York, but Brown’s mother refused. Two weeks later, Brown and two friends hopped a freight train and within two weeks made their way to New York where he supported himself by dancing in bars where people threw money on the floor. Because he was a minor, he could not be hired where liquor was sold; but when the management saw that people liked them, and would start buying beer, they let them stay. At age eighteen, Brown joined the Bill Robinson Revue at New York’s Apollo Theatre; and remained with the show from 1933 to 1939 because he was able to withstand the strict demands of Robinson who was a perfectionist. Performing his hometown style of up-tempo flash dancing at Small’s Paradise, Brown saw that young hoofers at the time were dancing to slower swing tempos which allowed them to insert more beats into the bar. When he approached these dancers for work he was turned down, because they felt Brown did not understand what they were doing. “So I woodshedded for three weeks,” he recounted, “and found out that rhythm dancing was flash dancing cut in half.” He returned to Small’s and delivered two choruses of rhythm tapping to asking the musicians for slower tempo, and performing two tasty choruses of rhythm tap to slow swing tempo. “By me being a flash dancer, I found out that I could do the same steps, and it worked out beautifully. I went on from there creating, creating, creating.” When a show he was touring with arrived in San Francisco, Brown says he was no longer doing flash. “Everything was rhythm, down to earth rhythm.” Falling in love with San Francisco, Brown decided to stay. He formed the trio of Brown, Gibson and Reed (Carl “Busboy” Gibson and Jerry Reed); the group later split off into Brown and Reed, as the Mad Cats of Rhythm. He also pursued work as a soloist, preferring to experiment on his own as a rhythm tap improviser. He teamed up with drummer Dave Tough in an act in which they would play off and answer each other in a drums-and-tap dialogue. Through the 1940s he appeared with Billie Holiday and Joe Turner at the Savoy in Art Tatum’s show, and with Dizzy Gillespie, Cal Tjader, George Shearing and the Jimmie Lunceford band as he pursued a career as a soloist. In the 1970s, Brown was a featured artist in Jon Hendrick’s San Francisco production of Evolution of the Blues, which ran for five years at the Broadway Theatre. In the early 80s Babs Rifkin and Camden Richman were instrumental in bringing Brown out of “retirement” and getting him to tap again in San Francisco; and in 1982 helped his move from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Through the 1980s, Brown appeared in many tap festivals that began to be organized in San Francisco, Boston, Denver, Boulder, Houston, and New York. “Eddie Brown always opened our shows,” Brenda Bufalino recalls of the Colorado Tap Festivals. Dressed in his white tuxedo and white broad-brimmed hat, she says that Brown set the tone for the whole show quickly and emphatically: “He swung his short, four-chorus dances at a medium tempo, developing his rhythms by accenting and doubling up his heels. He set his tempos with crisp, syncopated time steps to which he returned after executing breaks with a flourish of very hip and complex patterns.” In 1987 Brown performed at the San Francisco Tap Festival with Steve Condos, Jane Goldberg, Nicholas Brothers, and Lynn Dally; and in 1989 at the Outrageous Rhythms Festival performance in Houston, Texas with Bufalino, Condos, Honi Coles, Gregory Hines and Savion Glover. From 1983-1992 Brown was a soloist and company member of Rhapsody In Taps (RIT), directed by Linda Sohl-Ellison, who says that more than a guest artist, Brown rehearsed with the company and was featured in company repertoire as well as performing in every annual Rhapsody in Taps’ Los Angeles season at the Japan America Theatre, UCLS’s Royce Hall, and Wadsworth Theatre. He especially loved working with drummer Tootie Heath, and the two of them had a great rapport on stage. Brown also taught for RIT’s National Tap Dance Day’s events and was the honored Tap Master for the company’s first National Tap Day Outdoor Potluck Picnic at Occidental College, an event that became an annual Los Angeles event due to public demand. Brown choreographed several works for the company, as well as solos for Sohl Ellison. He also taught a popular and successful Saturday tap class at the Embassy Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, and many private lessons to Los Angeles tap dancers and others who sought him out, such as Pam Thompson and Heather Cornell. He also frequently appeared as a Guest Artist with Lynn Dally’s Los Angeles-based Jazz Tap Ensemble, and for them he choreographed Doxy, to the tune Sonny Rollins, which became a signature work of the company, as well as the well-known Eddie Brown B.S. Chorus. “Eddie Brown was one of America’s great tap treasures and we promoted Eddie’s visibility in every way possible way,” says Sohl-Ellison. Brown likens his tap dancing to “scientific rhythm” because, he says, “You heard all this music/rhythm but couldn't see where it was coming from.” His style is rhythmically intricate with steps that are close to the floor with equally intricate and sophisticated jazz phrasings. “One of the distinctive qualities is the way he accents steps within a phrase, where he places the strong punctuation,” says Linda Sohl Ellison. And when Brown was asked how to go about achieving that, he answered, “Make every tap count; don’t miss any.” Constance Valis Hill\n\n2007 - Leon Collins (February 7, 1922 - April 16, 1985), tap virtuoso who inspired a new blend of jazz and classical music, placing an innovative focus on melody rather than rhythm alone, and who believed that “Dancing is the poetry of the body as music is the poetry of the soul,” was born Leandre Kollins in Chicago, Illinois (2 February 1922), his father of West Indian descent. He learned to tap dance on the street corners and in pool halls, where young dancers gathered to copy and challenge each other, wanted to be a prizefighter, and played guitar with The Three Dukes, but in short time became a popular dancer in clubs around town. By the age of seventeen he left Chicago for Detroit, where he married up-and-coming blues singer Tina Dixon. The pair moved to New York City where Dixon, who was signed to perform with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra, opened the door for Collins’ big break when she recommended her husband perform with the orchestra after the opening act called in sick one night. Billed as “Gangs of Dancing,” Collins was offered a five-year contract with the Lunceford band and in the late 1930s also worked with the Count Basie orchestra in Chicago and New York, and with the bands of Erskine Hawkins, Earl “Father” Hines, Glen Gray and Tito Puente. Collins’ dancing in these early years included the usual steps that all hoofers had to know, such as wings, nerve taps, over-the-tops, and shuffle-flaps, as well as the requisite acrobatic splits and flips. But his style also embodied a clean, clear tapping with an emphasis on melodic line, which set him apart from other dancers. Where most hoofers would dance successive eight-bar rhythmic patterns broken up by moments of virtuosic flourishes or breaks, Collins did away with repetitive eight-bar/break patterns. His tapping instead flowed along with the melody, behaving more like a trumpet or a saxophone than a snare drum or tom-tom. “He wasn’t dancing like the other guys,” said his wife Tina. “He was different, dancing tap-for-tap, note-for-note.” This preference followed the style of Baby Laurence Jackson, who Collins always accorded much respect, and of the dancer Teddy Hale, a friend with whom Collins always traded steps. These dancers were all intimately involved with the new developments taking place in jazz during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Their fast and free-form improvising was well-suited to the bebop that was being created by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who Collins jammed informally with on numerous occasions, expressing in his feet what they played on their horns, and developing a melodic style of tapping that grew from his own musicality. “Tap is music,” said Collins. “We use our feet to get the same sound as an instrument.” He, along with Laurence and Hale, were among the pioneers of the high speed, packed tempos of bebop-style tap dancing. Dancing to such jazz standards as Dizzy Gillespie’s “Night in Tunesia,” Collins also interpreted Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Flight of the Bumblebee” and Bach’s “Prelude and Fugue in C Minor,” dancing with disarming ease and shimmering speed. Dressed immaculately in a white or black tuxedo and bow tie, his sounds were soft and delicate at first, gracefully embellishing the pianist’s rendition of Bach’s “Prelude.” But little by little, his movements grew more intense, his feet splashing the stage floor like summer rain pelting a roof, feet moving nimbly while the upper body remained still, as if allowing the feet to shoot the breeze with the piano. The cruelest irony of Collins’ career is that while he was developing jazz tap along the rhythmic and harmonic styles of the new bebop, opportunities for tap dancers were drying up across the country. While the emergence of bebop and the simultaneous decline of swing are cited as one reason for tap’s demise in the late forties and fifties, traditional dancers who were not inspired by bop’s intricate rhythms and unpredictable harmonic changes were duly reluctant to make innovations on their own style and move it forward with the new music. At any rate, as big bands died out, rock and roll became popular music, television became the country’s premier entertainment medium, and ballrooms no longer were the social meeting places, tap dancers had found less and less work. Collins managed as best he could during this cultural and musical transition. He formed partnerships with other dancers to increase his performing opportunities; he learned to play the guitar, and attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston. By the early 1960s, he was forced to give up dance entirely and for the next fourteen years, he worked as a polisher and reupholsterer of used cars. Gradually drifting away from show business circles entirely, he became an avid golfer and played cards with a small social group, the Salt and Pepper Club. In the mid-seventies, as the tap revival gained its impetus, Collins’ dance career began to defrost. In 1976, his performance with a number of other formerly retired dancers in a tap revival show at Boston’s New England Life Hall led to a new and unexpected line of work -- teaching for the revered tap instructor, Stanley Brown. For Collins, one night of teaching a week turned quickly into three or four, and when Brown died in 1978, Collins took over his studio, where his patience and kind, supportive demeanor became legendary. He was soon teaching for the Radcliffe Dance Program and the Harvard Summer Dance Center; and his own school, renamed the Leon Collins Dance Studio, in Brookline, MA, became home to dozens of students, young and old, who wanted to learn the art. Among them were such important tap artists as Dianne Walker, Pamela Raff, and C.B. Hetherington (later Clara Brosnaham Wirth) who became his protégés, and after his death, continued to manage his school. Collins’ studio also became a catalyst for his powers of invention. By the end of his career he had created nearly a dozen routines, extended a cappella dances that covered virtually the entire range of his own tap vocabulary. These routines, with names like Routine 1, “The Waltz,” and “Tapapella” are still taught at the studio by Pamela Raff; and further preserved in written form by pianist Joan Hill using a system of tap notation she devised. In his performances with Hill, Collins created a new blend of classical music and jazz that is unique in the history of tap dance. The “Bach Prelude and Fugue in C minor,” for example, comprised of jazz rhythms married to Baroque harmonies and counterpoint. Collin’s signature work was Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Flight of the Bumblebee” which segued into Cole Porter’s “Begin the Beguine.” Collins’s not only taught his students well but also launched their careers on the stage. As whenever he was asked to perform, he insisted they perform with him. Says Dianne Walker: “Leon gave me my foundation. He talked about being on time, he talked about money, he talked about clothes and about expression. He taught me everything that I know.” The air is free, and so is my tap,” said Collins, who approached his compositions with a clear and understandable phrasing of crisp straight eighth notes accented and syncopated by clapping sections, quick turns, and sharp angular movements, dutifully executing on the left and right sides to giving his performance a certain predictability and satisfying comprehensibility. “All I’m really trying to do is put a smile on your face.” Constance Valis Hill\n\n2008 - Mable Lee, the sassy chanteuse and jazz dancer with the million-dollar legs who was regaled in the 1940s as “Queen of the Soundies,” was born in Atlanta, Georgia (August 2, 1921) to Rosella Moore and Alton Lee. She was a child prodigy who began performing at the age of four; and all through elementary, middle, and high school, was known for her singing and dancing talents. By the age of nine, she was performing with a big band in popular clubs around town; at the age twelve, she was performing in the first black-owned nightclub in Georgia, The Top Hat. She arrived in New York City with her mother on August 18, 1940 and auditioned at the Apollo Theatre -- singing, dancing with a chair in her mouth, doing flips and splits-- but because she did not have an agent, she could not be booked as a soloist. On the advice that she seek work as a chorus liner, she went to a mass “call” for an audition and was chosen out of 300 girls to dance in the chorus at Harlem’s West End Theatre (on 125th Street). The chorus at the West End was so good (they were choreographed by Charlie Davis and Leonard Reed) that Frank Schiffman would not let any of those women work at his Apollo Theatre. It was only after the show closed (in August of 1940) that dance director Leonard Harper brought her to the Apollo, where she joined the “Number One” chorus. She worked six shows a day, and sometimes around the clock, when having to rehearse with a new band. “I got my training and start in the chorus,” said Mable about her training in the “School of Doing” at the Apollo.
