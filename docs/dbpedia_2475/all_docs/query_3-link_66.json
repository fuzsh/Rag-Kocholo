        "text": "1872 Birthday of singer and actor Anna Held, future wife of Florenz Ziegfeld, and the classic sexy French flirt of her era. She plays that role in a series of musical vehicles including La Poupee, The French Maid, Mam'selle Napoleon, The Parisian Model, and Miss Innocence.\n\n1901 Birthday of groundbreaking set designer Jo Mielziner, who wins five Tony Awards. His designs include sets for the original productions of Death of a Salesman, Guys and Dolls, A Streetcar Named Desire, South Pacific, The King and I, Gypsy, 1776, and dozens more.\n\n1915 Patricia Morison is born in New York. In 1948, she stars with Alfred Drake in the original production of Kiss Me, Kate. Her father is actor-playwright William Morrison.\n\n1931 Producer Charles Cochran's Cochran's 1931 Revue has a book and music conceived by Noël Coward. Bobby Clark, Melville Cooper, and Ada May star.\n\n1953 Jo Van Fleet and Martin Balsam are two of the inhabitants of Camino Real. Tennessee Williams' drama runs just seven weeks at the National Theatre in New York.\n\n1962 Ray Bolger stars in the musical All American, with a score by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams, and libretto by Mel Brooks. It runs 80 performances and introduces the song \"Once Upon a Time.\"\n\n1998 Proving everything old can be very new again, Cabaret transforms the Henry Miller's Theatre into the Kit Kat Klub. Directed by Sam Mendes and co-directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall, the revival opens tonight with Natasha Richardson, Ron Rifkin, Mary Louise Wilson, and Alan Cumming. It wins four Tony Awards including Best Revival of a Musical. The production later moves uptown to Studio 54. Several big-name stars play the role of Sally Bowles, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mary McCormack, and Susan Egan. It runs 2,377 performances, making it one of the few Broadway revivals to run longer than the original.\n\n2000 A new staging of Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten, starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne, opens at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theatre. The revival and its stars each earn Tony nominations, and Roy Dotrice wins for Featured Actor in a Play.\n\n2002 British actor Henry Goodman takes over one of the most coveted roles on Broadway: Max Bialystock in the musical The Producers. But he lasts only about a month, to be later replaced by understudy Brad Oscar.\n\n2003 Opening night for the R-rated puppet musical Avenue Q by Robert Lopez, Jeff Marx, and Jeff Whitty at Off-Broadway's Vineyard Theatre. It moves to Broadway a few months later and wins the 2004 Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\n2008 Paul Scofield, whose sonorous voice, commanding presence, and mournfully dignified mien made him one of the leading players of the London and international stage during the latter half of the 20th century, dies at age 86. He is perhaps best known for creating the role of Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's history play A Man for All Seasons.\n\n2009 A revival of the Arthur Laurents-Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim musical West Side Story opens on Broadway at the Palace Theatre. Directed by librettist Laurents, the staging weaves Spanish into the book and songs, with \"I Feel Pretty\" and \"A Boy Like That\" delivered entirely in Spanish. The translations are written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\n2015 Elisabeth Moss stars in the first Broadway revival of Wendy Wasserstein's The Heidi Chronicles, opening at the Music Box Theatre. The production runs only 53 performances.\n\nMore of Today's Birthdays: Moms Mabley (1894-1975). Hugh Wheeler (1912-1987). Patricia Morison (1915-2018). Phyllis Newman (1933-2019). Renée Taylor (b. 1933). Glenn Close (b. 1947). Robert Schenkkan (b. 1953). Maria Friedman (b. 1960). Neil LaBute (b. 1963). Amanda Kloots (b. 1982)."
