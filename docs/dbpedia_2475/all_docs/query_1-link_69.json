        "text": "Did Jo Van Fleet deserve her Supporting Actress Oscar win for her brief screen time in East of Eden? I always found the scene where Cal visits her and asks her to borrow money phenomenal. I also found the scene where Cal brings Aron to see that their mother really isn’t dead great, dark and kinda scary.\n\nJo was amazing, but my ex never understood why her performance was viewed as strong. I see it but he never did, and he said she was barely in the movie! I said that says a lot that she stood out so much with so little screen time\n\nThe nominees were…\n\nActress in a Supporting Role\n\nJo Van Fleet. East of Eden.\n\nBetsy Blair. Marty.\n\nPeggy Lee. Pete Kelly's Blues.\n\nMarisa Pavan. The Rose Tattoo.\n\nNatalie Wood. Rebel without a Cause.\n\n[italic]I guess it’s time to cut + paste this story of mine from the “Craziest Thing That Ever Happened to You at Work” thread: [/italic]\n\nThis was my most vivid incident from my restaurant days -\n\nIn the 1990s I worked in a place around the corner from Jo Van Fleet, the Academy Award winning actress. She was quite old, not working, and an alcoholic. She would come into the restaurant after already having had drinks at her house. Or at least this day she did.\n\nShe entered a busy Sunday brunch in a fur coat and was seated. Shorty after, a new hostess came up to me and said, “What do I do? Jo is wearing a black bra.” I was confused. “Is she wearing a white shirt, or something? And the bra’s… showing through?”\n\n“No. Jo is ONLY wearing a black bra.”\n\nI looked into the smoking section (because of course Jo smoked) and saw her in her black bra, pantyhose and shoes. Her fur coat was thrown back over the back of the chair. She must have started drinking that morning while getting dressed, then just thrown on her coat while half in the bag and headed out.\n\nI said, “Put the coat up over her shoulders and say you’re afraid she’s going to get cold.”\n\nWhen this was done, Jo looked down at herself and said, “Oh. Oh.” Then she shuffled out.\n\nPoor dear.\n\nDean was hammy. Method acting was still new in 1955 and they found his style unique and out of this world at the time. Dennis Hopper always spoke about how mesmerized he was by Dean as an actor, an actor like no other he had ever seen. Everyone would watch him in amazement while filming.\n\nIn modern day it all comes off very over the top and hammy though. But at the time they found it appealing vs the normal more subtle way of acting.\n\nHe was good. Just always “eating the scenery”, even in quieter moments."
