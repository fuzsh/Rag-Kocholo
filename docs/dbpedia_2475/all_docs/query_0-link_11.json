Her subsequent film work was very sporadic, and included such films as \"The Rose Tattoo\", \"I'll Cry Tomorrow\" (both 1955), \"The King and Four Queens\" (1956), and \"Gunfight at the O.K.

Toklas\" (1968).\n\nVan Fleet was married to William Bales from 1946 until his death in 1990, and was the mother of Michael Bales, who survived her. She died in Queens, New York of undisclosed causes at the age of 81.\n\nShe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to Motion Pictures, at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nExternal links\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*"
