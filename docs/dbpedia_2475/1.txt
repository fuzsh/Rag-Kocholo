Jo Van Fleet (December 30, 1914 &ndash; June 10, 1996) was an Academy Award- and Tony Award- winning American theatre and film actress.

Van Fleet established herself as a notable dramatic actress on Broadway over several years, winning a Tony Award in 1954 for her skill in a difficult role, playing an unsympathetic, even abusive character, in Horton Foote's "The Trip to Bountiful" with Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint.

Her first film role was playing the mother of the James Dean character in "East of Eden" (1955). This debut performance earned Van Fleet an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her subsequent film work was very sporadic, and included such films as "The Rose Tattoo", "I'll Cry Tomorrow" (both 1955), "The King and Four Queens" (1956), and "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" (1957).

In 1958, she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in "Look Homeward, Angel" on Broadway.

Other films are "Wild River" (1960), "Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella" (1965), "Cool Hand Luke" (1967), and "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" (1968).

Van Fleet was married to William Bales from 1946 until his death in 1990, and was the mother of Michael Bales, who survived her. She died in Queens, New York of undisclosed causes at the age of 81.

She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to Motion Pictures, at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.
