It's the last season for lobster rolls at Duryea's in Montauk.

Duryea's Lobster Deck, a local landmark some would say is almost as well known as the lighthouse, has been sold.

Perry B. Duryea III said Thursday he would continue to manage the business through 2014, "as it has been functioning for the last 50-odd years."

He added that a "high-end seafood restaurant" is expected to succeed the Lobster Deck and market on the Tuthill Road site. The changeover could take "two or three years," he said.

The property had been on the market since 2011, with an asking price of $5.9 million. Duryea, whose family has owned the business for three generations, said that wasn't the selling price. He declined to give the price or the name of the investor.

Suffolk County records show the property was sold to Sunrise Tuthill I LLC in February. An attorney for Sunrise Tuthill I also declined to reveal the sale price or elaborate on plans for the property.

But Duryea said, "We would not have sold it to anyone unless he had the proper plans" for the site.

The property is about 9 acres, including 6 acres of underwater rights and 650 feet of shoreline on the bay, according to a real estate listing on The Corcoran Group's website.

Duryea's Lobster Deck, a casual outdoor restaurant, is known for its lobster salad rolls and steamed lobsters, as well as its setting. Perry B. Duryea & Son has been a wholesale seafood distributor for more than 70 years.

Perry B. Duryea Jr., who died in 2004, was speaker of the New York State Assembly and the 1978 Republican gubernatorial nominee.
