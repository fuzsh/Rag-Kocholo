Here are the men and women whose fantasies, foibles, and otherwise-ﬂeeting fame ﬁnd permanency in the pavements, parks and place-names of the borough that almost wasn’t part of New York. This book will fascinate even the most provincial of non-Brooklynites. You don’t have to live there to love this one.” — Andrew Alpern, coauthor of New York’s Architectural Holdouts\n\n“This wonderfully informative compendium of street and place names connects the past to today by recalling the diverse cast of characters who gave their names to Brooklyn. Jump into your walking shoes, bring along this marvelous book, and get ready to explore Brooklyn’s streets!” — Judith Stonehill, coauthor of Brooklyn: A Journey through the City of Dreams\n\n“In 1935 Thomas Wolfe published a short story in The New Yorker entitled ‘Only the Dead Know Brooklyn,’ which began with a man declaring ‘Dere’s no guy livin’ dat knows Brooklyn t’roo an’ t’roo, because it’d take a guy a lifetime just to ﬁnd his way aroun’ duh f—— town.’ This is a sentiment that still applies even to this day when the Brooklynese accent that Wolfe sought to convey is as rare as a charlotte russe. But compared to rectilinear Manhattan, Brooklyn still remains a challenging hodge podge, a quagmire, a macedoine. Leonard Benardo and Jennifer Weiss have wisely stopped short of trying to demystify the place ‘t’roo and t’roo.’ Instead they set themselves the relatively more modest but attainable goal of tracking down the origins of the borough’s street names and in this they have done just ﬁne, laudably ﬁlling many gaps in knowledge.” — Michael T.

John Manbeck, Eric Wakin, Justin Burke, and Andrew Alpern oﬀered invaluable insights and prevented us from costly errors. Neighborhood historians Victoria Hofmo, Lee Rosenzweig, Ira Kluger, and Brian Merlis enlightened us with their local expertise. Ron Schweiger and Judith Stonehill provided necessary and well-timed encouragement. We oﬀer special thanks to David Elligers for his extraordinarily generous contributions and rigorous critique of the myths of New Utrecht. Thanks to Amy Peck from the Prospect Park Alliance for her time and editorial input. And for anyone curious about New York City’s palimpsest, we ﬁnd Kevin Walsh’s unparalleled on-line resource Forgotten NY to be required reading. We cannot overstate our thanks to the incredible group at the Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn Collection, that assisted us with the bulk of our research: Judith Walsh, Joy Holland, Elizabeth Harvey, Susan Aprill, and June Koﬃ. Working with such a dedicated, passionate, and knowledgeable team, we quickly made the Brooklyn Collection our second home. We were also fortunate that the Brooklyn Historical Society reopened its library in time for us to avail ourselves of its rich holdings. We are grateful to the individuals who helped in gathering photographs to illustrate our book, Erik Huber, John Hyslop, and Judith Todman at the Queens Public Library, Long Island Division, and Carey Stumm at the archives of the New York Transit Museum. We also oﬀer our appreciation to Michael Vachon, who provided us with John Vachon’s photographs of John Lindsay, and to Tom Ginocchio for his historic photos of the Brooklyn Bridge. Writing this book also gave us the opportunity to become acquainted with some highly talented photographers whose work we feature and whose friendship we now enjoy—in particular, Lucille Fornasieri Gold and Anders Goldfarb, as well as our cartographer and Old Stone House aﬁcionado Peter Joseph. Thanks also to Peter Fabry for taking the time to discuss his father’s Brooklyn murals. | xi\n\nA very special thanks to our editor, Ilene Kalish of NYU Press, for her direction and encouragement, to Salwa Jabado for her care and assistance and, not least, to Despina Papazoglou Gimbel and Charles Hames, for their meticulous attention to the book’s layout and design. To our families who oﬀered unstinting support, and friends, who took an active interest and served as a sounding board while we slogged away, we say thank you. Last, we would like to acknowledge Henry Moscow, whose book on Manhattan was the chief inspiration for our own.\n\nxii | ack n ow l e d g me n ts\n\nBrooklyn by Name\n\nGreenpoint\n\nW illiamsburg Fulton Ferry Landing DUMBO Vinegar Hill Brooklyn B.Q.E.

Coney Island, Prospect Park, Fulton Street, and Ebbets Field are widely recognized and need little formal introduction. As totems of the borough’s culture and history, they continue to stir the popular imagination. The streets and places of Brooklyn are the real arteries of the thriving metropolis, and the sources of their names reveal the borough’s and the nation’s rich and textured past. Yet outside of the easily discernible, the origin of many of Kings County’s street and place-names remains obscure and their derivations known only by the few. As Brooklyn historian Ralph Foster Weld dryly observed over a half century ago, “These names are repeated glibly in many accents—unconscious tribute which the heedless present pays to Brooklyn’s past.” Understanding the history of names—the ﬁeld of toponomy—opens a unique window onto the past and oﬀers an avenue to celebrate those left to posterity. It is also a means of painting, in Terrence Ranger’s evocative phrasing, a more usable historical canvas. Brooklyn’s street and placenames run the gamut, representing signers of the Declaration of Independence, baseball greats, philosophers, poets, diplomats, saints — not to mention the Revolutionary War generals whom Alfred Kazin makes reference to in his classic Brooklyn childhood memoir. A tour d’horizon of Brooklyn names is, at once, an amble through the borough’s history.\n\nMapping the Names Brooklyn, whose earliest inhabitants comprised diﬀerent groups of Native Americans, is geographically situated in Western Long Island. But unlike other parts of Long Island, which display a veritable bounty of Indian names from Massapequa to Ronkonkoma, Brooklyn has only a handful. Canarsie and Gowanus exist, to be sure, but Kings County’s European settlers ultimately adopted far fewer Native American names than other parts of the metropolitan area. | 1\n\nStreet names designating Dutch landowners are among the earliest acknowledged in Brooklyn. Remembered here are Brooklyn’s noteworthy ﬁrst families—the Lotts, Remsens, and Bergens—some with multiple namings scattered across the borough (being six towns originally, Brooklyn is rife with repetition). All told, landowners and developers are represented in the greatest number. The British takeover inevitably led to linguistic corruption as, for example, Boswijck turned into “Bushwick” and V’Lacke Bos became “Flatbush.” Anglicization also introduced names of English and royalist heritage—for example, Stirling, York, and not least, Kings County. In addition, Dutch families were forced to take on surnames, rather than continue the custom of using one’s place of origin or patronymic. (Pieter Claeson [son of Claes], to take one example, adopted the name Wyckoﬀ to satisfy the new sovereigns.) Similar to the aftermath of other successful revolutions, following the Revolutionary War some streets were stripped of names associated with the ancien régime (though others, say for Tory sympathizer Joris Rapelye, sneaked through). In their stead were streets dedicated to the heroes of the conﬂict, from generals to infantrymen. International partisans who helped the revolution succeed were also honored with streets, including Lafayette (French), De Kalb (German), and Kosciuszko (Polish). Street and place-names of this period additionally reﬂect the slaveholding culture once manifest throughout Kings County. The “peculiar institution” had ignominious roots in Brooklyn and continued until its ﬁnal abolition in 1827. At least seventy street names can be conclusively attributed to the area’s slaveholders. The nineteenth century brought a new bevy of names associated with the War of 1812 and the Union Army in the Civil War, not to mention the ﬁrst of several historical appeals to the founding fathers. Many signers of the Declaration of Independence were recognized with streets in Williamsburg, and accomplished military leaders—naval commanders being a particular favorite—criss-crossed the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant. At the nineteenth century’s end, place-names sought not only to honor a virtuous national past but also to reﬂect a sensibility that resonated with an increasing number of Brooklyn’s elite. With the British no longer a mortal enemy and Victorian aesthetics of signiﬁcant bourgeois appeal, English names were reintroduced as Brooklyn experienced a distinct wave of Anglophilia. Neighborhoods like Prospect Park South, Ditmas Park, Fort Greene, Manhattan Beach, and Kensington were the beneﬁciaries of assorted Anglo-rich street names like Cumberland, Argyle, Albemarle, Cambridge, and Oxford. What H. L. Mencken once mocked as Anglomania was a growth industry and included the precious substitution of “courts,” “places,” and “drives” for “streets.” 2 | int ro duc t ion\n\nBrooklyn was no stranger to the idiosyncrasies of American nationalism, witnessed by the several Prussian-sounding streets renamed during and following World War I. As the country swapped “frankfurter” for “hot dog” and “sauerkraut” for “liberty cabbage,” so too did Red Hook’s Vienna Avenue become Lorraine Street and Bushwick’s Dresden Street become Highland Place. The post–World War II era has seen few changes in Brooklyn’s names, apart from those lost to the wrecking ball—whether from the construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway or the Belt Parkway. What has emerged instead is the secondary naming of streets for veterans, public servants, and other community leaders. Additionally, scores of streets have received subsidiary namings for those killed on September 11, 2001. These naming decisions are made by the New York City Council, as they once were by the Board of Aldermen.\n\nA Very Short Sketch of the History of Brooklyn The ﬁrst recorded people to settle in Brooklyn were the Canarsee, an Algonquin-speaking tribe of the Delaware (Leni Lenape) Indians. With the arrival of the Dutch West India Company in 1625, ensuing violence, trade, appropriation of land, and war ultimately led to the Canarsee’s ﬂight and disappearance. Over several decades, the Dutch West India Company oﬀered charters to those ready to establish a permanent presence. The ﬁrst went to settling Breukelen (Brooklyn) in 1646, predating by a decade New Amsterdam itself; then Nieuw Amersfoort (Flatlands) in 1647; Midwout (Flatbush) in 1652; Nieuw Utrecht (New Utrecht) in 1657; and ﬁnally, with Peter Stuyvesant’s active participation, Boswijck (Bushwick) in 1661. Gravesend was the only one of the six original towns that was settled not by the Dutch but by the English—notably, by Lady Deborah Moody, who received a patent in 1645. For over two hundred years, Brooklyn was just one (albeit the largest) of the area’s six towns. The Dutch period was followed, beginning in 1664, with an English presence that lasted until the end of the War of Independence. Kings County— for King Charles II of England—was formally established in 1683 to be one of New York’s ten counties, and its central institutions were located in Flatbush, the county’s geographic center. Despite the range of settlements, the overall population of Kings County by the time of the American Revolution was still a modest 3,500. The war itself traces its origins to Brooklyn, as the very ﬁrst battles in New York took place around today’s Prospect Park and Gowanus areas. Like New York, all of Kings County was occupied during the war years, and the some 11,500 revolutionary captives who perished in squalid prisint ro duc t ion | 3\n\noner ships at Wallabout Bay are the starkest historical reminder of the war’s brutality. Slavery is undoubtedly the greatest blight on Brooklyn’s colonial and early American history. Arriving ﬁrst with the Dutch, by 1800 it is estimated that of the ﬁve thousand persons living in Kings County, nearly one-third were slaves, a number proportionally greater than anywhere else north of the Mason-Dixon line. Indeed, various pockets of Brooklyn remained ambivalent on the issue. The city’s ﬂagship publication, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, in fact removed its brilliant young editor, Walt Whitman, principally because of his quasi-abolitionist views. It has been written that the nineteenth century in Brooklyn truly began with the Nassau ferry’s maiden steam voyage across the East River. Several centuries of rowboat and other engineless travel were thrown to the wind in 1814 with Robert Fulton’s creation, which proved to have profound economic consequences for the city. At a rate often surpassing New York City itself, Brooklyn was rapidly developing into a thriving metropolis via its waterfront, industrial diversity, and inﬂux of newcomers, and capped by the construction of the fabled Brooklyn Bridge. With its annexation of Williamsburg and Bushwick in 1855, Brooklyn became overnight the third most populous city in the United States. Over the next four decades Brooklyn progressively swallowed all its neighboring towns and villages so that by the century’s end, it became coterminous with Kings County. Yet Brooklyn’s empire building was shortlived: by the narrowest of margins, Brooklynites voted 64,744 to 64,467 in favor of consolidation with New York, and in 1898 Brooklyn the city became Brooklyn the borough. In popular memory at least, the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century is bound up with two central reference points: Coney Island as pleasure palace, working-class entertainment, and surreal fantasy; and the Brooklyn Dodgers, a signiﬁer for the aspirations and dashed hopes of Brooklyn’s own. The Dodgers’ heartrending departure for Los Angeles in 1957 signaled a transitional moment in Brooklyn’s history. Alongside the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the attendant ﬂight to the suburbs, the borough soon became engulfed in controversial issues of the day relating to race, immigration, education, and housing. With substantial demographic transformation, Brooklyn’s population took on a changed proﬁle and cast, and by the century’s end it had become one of America’s truly polyethnic places.\n\nOutline of the Book and Caveats to the Reader Our book is not an exhaustive study. As Thomas Wolfe famously put it, “It would take a lifetime to know Brooklyn. And even then, you wouldn’t know 4 | int ro duc t ion\n\nit all.” Brooklyn has over eighteen hundred streets, numbered and named (besting Manhattan severalfold), and hundreds of additional place-names including myriad bridges, parks, schools, and places of worship. We take Wolfe to heart and select herein a representative cross-section of the historically signiﬁcant and culturally curious. In the course of our research some name origins fell out of reach—even to neighborhood historians—and will hopefully be dredged up by future excavators. Others were self-explanatory—say, Parkside Avenue or President Street. Still others, like the numbered streets, didn’t merit elucidation. Additionally, we have avoided by and large secondary street namings, focusing instead, with a handful of exceptions, on the street’s primary name. In the end we have chosen roughly six hundred names that we hope will absorb and edify the reader. Nonetheless, we expect that our project will encourage others to ﬁll in the blanks. We faced a quandary in determining in which chapter to place a street that runs through multiple neighborhoods. Case in point: Bedford Avenue traverses Greenpoint in the north, through Bedford-Stuyvesant, all the way to Sheepshead Bay. Where possible, we have tried to select the area with which the street is most distinctly associated. Nonetheless, the index will be of use in identifying the street in question. Lastly, we have made every eﬀort to hunt down the birth and death dates of individuals mentioned in the entries; in those cases where we were unsuccessful we hope that the details of the entry will provide a suﬃcient timeline.\n\nBeginning with Brooklyn One can ﬁnd a wealth of permutations of Brooklyn’s Dutch-era name— Breukelen, Breuckelen, Breukelein, Bruijkleen, Broucklyn, Brucklyn — on maps, historical records, and land deeds, though the received wisdom today has pretty much settled on Breukelen. Most scholars also agree that the name originates with the town in Utrecht, the Netherlands, from which the ﬁrst Dutch settlers likely arrived. Following the English conquest, the name was anglicized to Brookland and, at some later point in the eighteenth century, corrupted to its present form. A common misconception that should be put to rest is that Brooklyn is Dutch for “broken land.” The Dutch term gebroken landt (broken land) is actually the translation of the Algonquin name for Long Island and should not be confused with the origin of Brooklyn. Before Brooklyn’s 1898 incorporation into New York, debate ensued about the new borough’s name; though never really in doubt, there were voices who sought to change it to New York East. Few would be displeased that this never saw the light of day.\n\nint ro duc t ion | 5\n\n1 | Northern Brooklyn Bushwick, Greenpoint, Williamsburg A map of Northern Brooklyn appears on the following pages.\n\nWilliamsburg Stoop Scene, 1970s\n\n6 |\n\nMap of the City of Williamsburgh with part of Greenpoint, 1852\n\nGreenpoint waterfront, 1992\n\n| 7\n\nS\n\nettled by the Canarsee Indians, Northern Brooklyn was originally known as Cripplebush for the cripplebush or scrub-oak trees that were predominant in the area. Sold to the Dutch West India Company in 1638, the largely swamp-ﬁlled region would come to be the preserve of this chapter’s three principal neighborhoods: Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Williamsburg. In 1661, three years prior to New Amsterdam’s fall, Governor General Peter Stuyvesant named and helped patent the new town of Boswijck. Dutch for “town in the woods,” or as some have argued “heavy woods,” it became one of Kings County’s six original towns. Arriving at the tail end of the Dutch period, the name had only a brief existence, being anglicized to Bushwick soon after the British takeover. Topographical considerations were also relevant in the naming of Bushwick’s neighbor, Greenpoint. Originally referring to a point of land covered by grass and jutting beyond the shoreline, Greenpoint is said to have been bestowed its name by seventeenth-century sailors who traveled past. The designation was eventually extended to the entire area—today’s Greenpoint neighborhood. Though Greenpoint is reputedly the birthplace of the patois “Brooklynese”—a version of the Kings (County) English—no names have been changed to reﬂect that cultural reality. Similarly bounded by the East River, Williamsburg was the brainchild of Richard Woodhull, a ferry operator who purchased thirteen acres of Charles Titus’s farm in 1802. Woodhull commissioned his friend Col. Jonathan Williams (1750–1815)—U.S. engineer, ﬁrst superintendent of West Point, and grandnephew to Revolutionary giant Benjamin Franklin—to survey the land. Woodhull honored his comrade by naming Williamsburg after him. Until 1855 the neighborhood had a decisive “h” at the end: Williamsburgh, that is. Yet consolidation into the city of Brooklyn (after a brief period of independence, 1852–55, as a chartered city) stripped the ﬁnal “h” away. The lost “h” today can be found only on the Williamsburgh Savings norther n bro oklyn | 11\n\nBank. (For consistency, Williamsburg is written sans “h” in the entries here unless part of a formal name.) Having absorbed Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Bushwick in 1855, Brooklyn’s size doubled overnight. In its changed conﬁguration, northern Brooklyn for a time took on a diﬀerent regional name and became known as Brooklyn’s Eastern District, in contrast to traditional Brooklyn to its west. The last nomenclatural holdout from that period, Bushwick’s Eastern District High-School, succumbed only a few years ago. Upon incorporation with Brooklyn in 1855, Greenpoint and Bushwick were forced to change some street names to avoid confusion. For example, Henry Street in Greenpoint was changed to North Henry to diﬀerentiate it from South Brooklyn’s Henry Street. Greenpoint also developed an acrostic naming system with alphabetical and numbered streets, later changed to named ones. Finally, many streets in Williamsburg were renamed to honor signers of the Declaration of Independence. Ainslie Street James Ainslie was for many years a local judge and school district trustee in Williamsburg. In 1847 Ainslie was counted as one of forty-four persons in the town with a net worth in excess of $10,000. Anthony Street Possibly named for Susan B(rownell) Anthony (1820–1906), who dedicated her life to the struggle for women’s suﬀrage and other progressive causes. With Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, Anthony founded the National Woman’s Suﬀrage Association in 1868. Anthony spoke publicly in Brooklyn quite often. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported her aﬃrming that “a woman is a person, a person is a citizen and a citizen has a right to vote.” Arion Place Formerly Wall Street, it was renamed after Arion Hall, a nineteenth-century Bushwick concert venue. The associated Arion Society was a choral group and musical society begun by immigrant Germans. In Greek mythology, Arion refers to a seventh-century BC poet and lyre player. Ash Street Once A Street, the red and white coal ash common to the industrial locale is the probable source for the renaming. Astral Apartments (184 Franklin Street between India and Java streets) Named for Charles Pratt’s Astral Oil Works, these apartments were built in 1885 – 86 to house Pratt’s kerosene reﬁnery workers. American Architect wrote that Pratt intended these apartments, known for their model tenement design, for “the widow who has lived in aﬄuence but has been reduced in circumstances,” “the Astral Apartments, 2005 shop-girl,” “the clerk, or tradesman,” and “the great body of ﬁrst-class mechanics who have 12 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nfamilies.” Some of the largesse Pratt accrued in the oil business went to ﬁnancing his eponymous institute in Clinton Hill (see chapter 4). Banker Street Edward Banker of the ship-chandler ﬁrm Schermerhorn, Banker & Company had extensive Greenpoint landholdings in the middle nineteenth century. (Ship chandlers handled some of the accoutrement of sailing ships, like ropes and canvas.) His son, James Hopson Banker, was a vice president of the Bank of New York and close friend of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, with whom he helped establish the New York Central, Harlem, and Lake Shore railroads. Bartlett Street Dr. Josiah Bartlett (1729–1795) was New Hampshire’s ﬁrst governor, the state’s ﬁrst chief justice, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His political achievements came after a successful medical career in which he discovered that Peruvian bark could be used to treat throat distemper. With a homemade remedy, Bartlett also self-diagnosed and cured his own life-threatening feverous condition. Appointed a militia unit commander in 1765, he was soon stripped of his duties because of his strong opposition to royal policy. Bayard Street Named for Nicholas Bayard (ca. 1644–1707), large landowner, New York mayor, and nephew of Peter Stuyvesant. In the overweening class politics of the day, Bayard’s implacable hostility toward the Leislerians in the late 1680s led to his imprisonment, trial for treason, and near hanging. (Populist Jacob Leisler had a brief following in New York in opposition to the wealthy merchants and landowners before he was beheaded.) The incoming colonial governor, Lord Cornbury, overturned the sentence. The street was formerly named Sandford Street, but it was renamed after New York’s own Bayard Street. Bedford Avenue Named for the neighborhood of Bedford Corners (see chapter 4 introduction), Bedford Avenue carries the distinction of being Brooklyn’s longest street, extending from Greenpoint to Sheepshead Bay. Berry Street Dr. Bedford Avenue and North 9th Street, 1987 Abraham J. Berry norther n bro oklyn | 13\n\n(1799–1865) was Williamsburg’s ﬁrst mayor after incorporation as an independent city in 1852. Trained as a physician, Berry was a hero to many for his herculean eﬀorts during the 1832 cholera epidemic. Three decades later, he was surgeon of the 38th New York infantry during the Civil War. Despite being mayor of a newly independent Williamsburg, Berry was a proponent of consolidation with Brooklyn. Bleecker Street Jan Jansen Bleecker (1641–1732), progenitor of a family of early Dutch settlers residing principally in Albany and New York, came to New Amsterdam at the age of seventeen. Scion Anthony Bleecker, for whom Manhattan’s Bleecker Street is named, was a wealthy landowner and shipping merchant, not to mention friend to George Washington and Washington Irving. Bleecker translates from the Dutch as “bleacher of cloth.” Bnos Yakov of Pupa (274 Keap Street) Originally Temple Beth Elohim, this site marks one of the ﬁrst Jewish congregations in Brooklyn (from 1851). The currentoccupantsof theRuskinianGothicplaceof worshiparethePupaHasidim, the second-largest ultraorthodox group inWilliamsburg after the Satmar.The name translates as “Daughters of Jacob from the town of Pupa, Hungary” (“Papa”in Hungarian).Pupa was once a center for training Orthodox rabbis. Bogart Street A native of South Holland, Teunis Ghysbertse Bogaerdt (1625– 1699) came to settle in Brooklyn’s Wallabout area. In 1654 he married Sarah Rapelye, widow of Hans Hansen Bergen and the ﬁrst European woman born in New Amsterdam. Bogaerdt was one of the trustees and overseers of Brooklyn in the late 1670s. The name was later corrupted to Bogart, and descendents include the prominent American actor Humphrey. Borinquen Plaza The Taino, Puerto Rico’s indigenous people, call their country Borinquen, which translates as “the land of the great lords.” Brooklyn’s Boricua College, the name referring to one who is Puerto Rican, serves the community with campuses in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Brewers Row (North 11th Street between Berry Street and Wythe Avenue) This patch of North 11th Street was named Brewers Row in 2000 to remember the once thriving hops industry in Northern Brooklyn. At the turn of the twentieth century there were nearly ﬁfty breweries in Williamsburg and Bushwick, and Brooklyn produced more beer than Detroit and Milwaukee combined. German immigrants making use of Long Island pure water were the main actors here. The post-prohibition turn toward national-brand brewing spelled the end of such happier (hoppier?) times. Bridgewater Street Proximity to the former Meeker Avenue (Penny) Bridge that spanned Newtown Creek from Greenpoint to Maspeth resulted in the naming. Broadway Named for the better-known Broadway across the river, it had been called Division Avenue, which for a time separated Williamsburg from Bushwick. 14 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nBushwick/Hylan Houses (372 Bushwick Avenue) This Williamsburg public housing complex is named for John F. Hylan (1868–1936), two-term New York City mayor from 1918 to 1926. A poor farm boy who “parlayed $1.50 into a comfortable fortune,” Hylan became a lawyer and judge and got tapped by the Tammany machine to run for mayor. He was closely identiﬁed with the ﬁve-cent subway fare and described it as the “cornerstone of the ediﬁce which we call New York City.” Tammany turned against him (as did Governor Alfred E. Smith), and he lost his second bid for reelection. Staten Island’s north-south spine, Hylan Boulevard, is also named in his honor. Calhoun Street Likely named for John C. Calhoun (1782–1850), vice president under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson and charismatic Democratic senator from South Carolina. His endorsement of states’ rights and the “peculiar institution” of slavery won him allies in the South but kept him from a wider constituency, speciﬁcally those alienated by his reactionary sectional loyalty. Arguing that Andrew Jackson’s tariﬀ policy beneﬁted the industrial North at the expense of the South, he resigned the vice presidency, the only person ever to do so. Calyer Street The Calyers were one of the ﬁve principal families in early Greenpoint, and Jacobus Calyer (1700–1766) was its patriarch. The present street occupies the spot where the sixty-ﬁve-acre Calyer family farm stood from 1766 to 1848. The street was formerly P Street (within Greenpoint’s A to Q line), with Calyer Street interrupting the neighborhood’s alphabetical patterning. Clay Street Many attribute the name’s origin to Humphrey Clay, an associate of Captain Kidd’s, who in 1667 received a land grant on both ends of Meeker Avenue and began a ferry line near the former Penny Bridge. A few, though, have conjectured that it may be named after Henry Clay, the Kentucky senator, secretary of state, and three-time failed presidential nominee who died in 1852, the year the street was opened. Clymer Street Reared by his uncle after being orphaned at an early age, George Clymer of Philadelphia (1739–1813) represented Pennsylvania at the Continental Congress and signed the Declaration of Independence. After the Revolutionary War, Clymer spent time in the Pennsylvania legislature, where he supported penal code reform and opposed capital punishment. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives he advocated for closer ties with France and for a liberal naturalization policy. Cooper Park (Sharon and Olive streets and Maspeth and Morgan avenues) Located in East Williamsburg and named for the noted philanthropist and industrialist Peter Cooper (1791–1883). In 1838 Cooper set up a glue factory on Maspeth Avenue in Brooklyn after relocating from Manhattan’s Kip’s Bay. He eventually sold the factory to family members in 1865; thirty years later they turned over the grounds to the city of Brooklyn for $55,000, and within norther n bro oklyn | 15\n\na year the site became Cooper Park. Peter Cooper was also an inventor responsible for the Tom Thumb (the ﬁrst) steam locomotive and for patenting the manufacture of gelatin. (The patent was sold ﬁfty years later and used to produce Jell-O.) In Manhattan, Cooper established Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, one of the country’s Statue of Peter Cooper ﬁrst free higher-educational institutions. in front of Cooper Union, 1901 Decatur Street At the tender age of twenty, Steven Decatur (1779–1820) had already become an acting navy lieutenant, later distinguishing himself in the War of 1812. He famously declared, “Our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations may she always be in the right; but our country right or wrong.” In 1818, U.S. Capitol architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe ﬁnished Decatur’s Washington, D.C., home—one of the city’s oldest (it’s a museum today). Decatur had little time to enjoy it, dying two years after its completion, the result of a duel. Division Avenue This avenue deﬁned the boundary between the cities of Brooklyn and Williamsburg. Driggs Avenue Named for Edmund Driggs (d. 1891) the last village president of Williamsburg before its incorporation as a city. Driggs was also a First Ward alderman, president of the Williamsburg City Fire Insurance Company, and a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Chicago that nominated Stephen Douglas. Dunham Place Laid in 1850 and named for David Dunham (ca. 1790–1823), a New York merchant who helped initiate an early steam ferry from Brooklyn to New York, which earned him the nickname “Father of Williamsburg.” Dunham was an indefatigable advocate for steam navigation and a pioneer of steamship travel, venturing to Havana, New Orleans, and several southern states. He died a tragic death when he fell overboard in the Hudson River and drowned near West Point while returning —by steamship, of course—from Albany. Eberhard Faber Pencil Buildings (37 and 61 Greenpoint Avenue; 59 Kent Street) Coming to America in 1848, Eberhard Faber (1822– 1879) established a German import business that included pencils. Thirteen years later, on the site of the present United Nations building, he started his own factory with the ﬁrst mass-produced eraser-tipped pencils. Destroyed by ﬁre in 1872, the ﬁrm moved to Eberhard Faber, 1922 16 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nGreenpoint, where it became the world’s largest pencil company. It removed to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1956. Eckford Street A member of the nineteenth century’s foremost shipbuilding families, Eckford Webb (1825–1893) was a founder, in 1850, of the Greenpoint shipyard Webb & Bell at West and Green streets. Webb & Bell was responsible for the extraordinary wood caissons that have kept the Brooklyn Bridge from sinking into the East River. When completed, the caissons were hauled four miles downstream from the Webb & Bell shipyard. Webb Avenue in the Bronx honors the shipbuilder’s naval architect father. Ellery Street An active member of the Rhode Island Sons of Liberty, William Ellery (1727–1820) was a delegate at the 1776 Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He later reminisced: “I was determined to see how they all looked as they signed what might be their death warrant.” Upon retirement he received an appointment from George Washington to serve as the U.S. Customs Collector for the District of Newport. During these years he became outspoken in his desire to abolish slavery from the country. Evergreen Avenue This avenue serves as the main road leading to Bushwick’s Cemetery of the Evergreens, hence the name. Flushing Avenue This road once led to the town of Flushing, and its name is an anglicization of Vlissingen (the name of a Dutch city). The town was historically central to the early struggles, led by John Bowne, over freedom of conscience. Franklin Street Perhaps the most prominent American of his time, Benjamin Franklin’s (1706–1790) achievements are legion, whether as diplomat, inventor, journalist, or statesman. Of the ﬁfty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence, he was the oldest at the age of seventy. A true autodidact with little formal schooling, he practiced what he posited, namely, that “the doors to wisdom are never shut.” Williamsburg is named for his surveyor grandnephew, Jonathan Williams. Gerry Street Elbridge Gerry (1744–1814) was a member of the Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and governor of Massachusetts. Gerry’s concern that individual and states’ rights were being insuﬃciently protected in the early debates over the Constitution led to their inclusion in the Bill of Rights. During his second gubernatorial term, Gerry’s party redistricted the state in the hope of winning the next election. Rearranged in a salamander-like shape, the redistricting gave birth to the term “gerrymandering” (from “Gerry” and “salamander”), which deﬁned the partisan practice of boundary manipulation. Gerry later succeeded George Clinton as James Madison’s vice president. Graham Avenue John and James Lorimer Graham were land-jobbers in Williamsburg during the ﬁrst part of the nineteenth century. Jobbers, norther n bro oklyn | 17\n\nwhose reputations were less than savory, sought to purchase land not for cultivation or settlement but for the sole purpose of turning a proﬁt. Grand Ferry Park (between Grand Street, West River Street, and the East River) Named for the Grand Street Ferry, the East River crossing that made its way from Williamsburg to Manhattan. The ferry continued service until 1918, by which time the Williamsburg Bridge had already been servicing pedestrians and vehicles for ﬁfteen years.\n\nGrand Street, 1989\n\nGrattan Street Named in 1888 for Henry Grattan (1746–1820), a Protestant member of the Irish Parliament who valiantly fought for Ireland’s independence and the civil and political rights of Catholics. Grattan’s support for decolonization was broad: when British troops left Ireland to ﬁght in the American Revolution, Grattan’s sympathies extended to the colonists. Though the last two decades of the eighteenth century in Ireland were considered “Grattan’s Parliament,” he was unable to forestall the inevitable: the 1800 Act of Union that merged the kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain. Greenpoint Avenue One of two exceptions to the alphabetical patterning of streets in the neighborhood, Greenpoint Avenue was originally L Street. It 18 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nbecame Lincoln Street, then Greenpoint Avenue, then later National Avenue, and ﬁnally back to Greenpoint Avenue. Guernsey Street Thought to be named for Dr. Egbert Guernsey (1823–1903), an early and important practitioner of homeopathic medicine and author of the Gentleman’s Handbook of Homeopathy. Guernsey’s adoption of homeopathic methods led to rebuke from various establishment groups, but his enormous success in the new science was transformative. In addition to his presidency at New York’s Metropolitan Hospital (on Blackwell Island, today Roosevelt Island), Guernsey was a founder of the Williamsburgh Daily Times (later Brooklyn Daily Times) and of the well-regarded monthly medical journal the New York Medical Times. He was a large man, often weighing in excess of four hundred pounds.\n\nGuernsey Street, taken from the corner of Norman Avenue, ca. 1992 norther n bro oklyn | 19\n\nHarrison Avenue Born into a political family, Virginian Benjamin Harrison (1726–1791) held a variety of oﬃces and was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was also no stranger to black humor: when discussion raged about the dangers of being hanged for signing the Declaration, the rotund Harrison reportedly counseled the slight Elbridge Gerry, “I shall have all the advantage over you. It will be all over in a minute for me, but you will be kicking in the air half an hour after I am gone.” Harrison’s son, William Henry Harrison, went on to become U.S. president. Hart Street New Jersey farmer John Hart (ca. 1713–1779) was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, Hessian mercenaries destroyed Hart’s 380acre farm, and the resultant trauma was central to his wife’s illness and eventual death. Once he learned that the British sought to capture him, Hart spent a year hiding out in forests and caves. Hausman Street Possibly named for Charles Housman (various spellings exist), whose wife, Ariantje, was the daughter of Dirck “the Norman” Volckertsen (see Norman Avenue entry in this chapter). Havemeyer Street Brothers Frederick C. Havemeyer (1774–1841) and William Havemeyer (1770–1851) were major industrialists who made their money in sugar processing. Arriving from Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century, they soon built a sugar reﬁnery on Vandam Street in Manhattan. William’s son, William F. (1804–1874), took over the family business in the 1830s but ventured into politics and became a three-term New York mayor. Cousin Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. (1807–1891) stayed in the sugar trade and in 1857 established the longstanding South 3rd Street factory on the Williamsburg waterfront. His son, Henry Havemeyer (1847 – 1907), named the company Domino’s Sugar in the early 1900s and worked to corner the market. His Sugar Reﬁneries Company, or “Sugar Trust,” functioned like Standard Oil William Frederick Havemeyer, mid-nineteenth century — monopolistically (and like Standard Oil did battle with the government over market control). An era ended in 2004 when Domino’s Sugar terminated its reﬁning operations and the East River plant (and classic signage) bearing its name. The company is now a part of the British concern Tate & Lyle. Hewes Street Originally from New Jersey, Declaration of Independence signer Joseph Hewes (1730–1779) moved to North Carolina, made a fortune in the shipping trade, and was elected to be a representative at the Continental 20 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nCongress. Though Quaker, he promoted the ﬁght against Great Britain and ultimately broke with the Society of Friends because of their opposition to the war. Heyward Street Thomas Heyward Jr. of South Carolina (1746–1809) signed the Declaration of Independence at the age of thirty but resigned from the Continental Congress to be a judge in his home state. When the British captured Charleston in 1780, Heyward was imprisoned with fellow South Carolina signers Edward Rutledge and Arthur Middleton for one year in St. Augustine, Florida. The British expropriated his slaves and sold them to sugar planters in Jamaica. Himrod Street J. S. (John Sutphen) Himrod (1812–1882) was the ﬁrst minister of the South Bushwick Reformed Church on Bushwick Avenue and (what became) Himrod Street, serving there from 1854 to 1859. Hooper Street Originally from Boston, Declaration of Independence signer William Hooper (1742–1790) moved to North Carolina after law school and participated in the colonial legislature and Continental Congress. His sharp words against the king led to his disbarment. Humboldt Street Named for Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), a hugely inﬂuential naturalist, explorer, and anthropologist whose work in the ﬁelds of contemporary meteorology and geography led Darwin to describe him as “the greatest scientiﬁc traveler who ever lived.” In 1804, following an enormously successful ﬁve-year expedition around South America (later recounted in no less than thirty volumes), he came to the United States, befriended Thomas Jeﬀerson, and lectured for several months around the country. Humboldt was gay and left all his personal belongings to his partner, his servant Siefert. His sister later torched all his love letters. He is remembered in the United States via a river, a reservoir, a Alexander von Humboldt, salt marsh, and a university, as well as lakes, mid-nineteenth century mountains, parks, counties, and towns. India Street Similar to India House, the private Manhattan clubhouse named to reﬂect the upsurge in trade to the East, India Street, opened in 1852, sought its own Orientalist connotation. Ingraham Street Likely named for Duncan Nathaniel Ingraham (1802–1891), a naval oﬃcer and large slaveholder best known for defending and freeing Martin Koszta, the Hungarian American kidnapped in Turkey in 1853. He became a midshipman at the advanced age of ten and joined the Confederate Navy ﬁve decades later, commanding Charleston Station from 1862 to 1865. norther n bro oklyn | 21\n\nIrving Avenue Born in New York the youngest of eleven children and named after George Washington, Washington Irving (1783–1859) was the author of the short stories “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle” and the comic 1809 novel The History of New York. The novel features Dietrich Knickerbocker, whose name is the eponym for the term referring to a descendent of early Dutch settlers. Fittingly, Knickerbocker Avenue (see entry in this chapter) runs parallel to this street. Java Street Formerly J Street, it was likely renamed to oﬀer exotic illustration of the waterfront cargo—coﬀee and spices—unloaded here. Johnson Avenue Of Dutch stock, General Jeremiah Johnson (1766–1852) was a longstanding politician in Brooklyn, ﬁrst as a trustee and county supervisor and later as the city’s third mayor from 1837 to 1838. A vocal champion of Brooklyn’s independent metropolitan status, Johnson inﬂamed New York politicians advocating consolidation. “Between New York and Brooklyn there is nothing in common, either in object, interest or feeling,” he once said, “unless it be the waters that ﬂow between them. And even those waters, however frequently passed, must forever continue to form an insurmountable obstacle to their union.” Johnson was a brigadier general in the War of 1812, commanding troops stationed at Fort Greene, and was also an early historian of Brooklyn. Keap Street This street’s origin is an oddity. It is named for Thomas McKean of Pennsylvania (1734–1817), the ﬁnal signer of the Declaration of Independence, but his scrawled signature on the document led to the street name’s Williamsburg bastardization. Kent Avenue/Kent Street Prominent jurist James Kent (1763–1847) was the ﬁrst professor of law at Columbia College. Appointed in 1793 on the recommendation of John Jay, he taught for only three years but returned following his retirement from the New York Court of Chancery. Kent’s Commentaries on American Law (4 vols., 1826–30), the product of his celebrated Columbia lectures, mark the onset of modern legal scholarship. Kingsland Street Ambrose Cornelius Kingsland (1804–1878), Whig mayor of New York for one term (1851–53), was also a widely known Greenpoint resident and developer, not to mention sperm whale oil merchant. With Samuel J. Tilden (see chapter 5), Kingsland purchased a large swathe of Greenpoint’s surveyed land. Despite a corruption-riddled mayoralty, Kingsland performed one major public service: the appropriation of funds for what would become Central Park. Knickerbocker Avenue Received its name from the Washington Irving character Dietrich Knickerbocker (see Irving Avenue entry in this chapter). Kossuth Place Revered as the “father of Hungarian democracy,” Lajos Kossuth (pronounced “Kosh-shoot”) (1802–1894) was a hero of the 1848 revolution and governor of Hungary during its struggle for independence. Despite 22 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nAustrian and Russian suppression, Hungary later received partial autonomy within a newly renamed Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1851–52 Kossuth toured the United States, where he became the ﬁrst formally invited foreign dignitary since Lafayette to speak before the House of Representatives. Lee Avenue This avenue honors two fraternal Virginia signers of the Declaration of Independence: Richard Henry Lee (1732 – 1794) and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734 – 1797). Though a slaveholder himself, the ﬁrst piece of legislation Richard Henry Lee introduced Lajos Kossuth, 1849 in the Virginia House of Burgesses recommended levying an extraordinary tax on anyone importing slaves “to put an end to that iniquitous and disgraceful traﬃc within the colony of Virginia.” Six years later, the brothers denounced the Stamp Act and threatened colonists who honored it in one of the ﬁrst signiﬁcant acts of sedition against the king. Lee Avenue is today Williamsburg’s central Hasidic commercial artery. Leonard Street Possibly named for John Leonard, a commissioner assigned with laying out streets in Bushwick after the town’s partial 1835 annexation to Williamsburg. Lindsay Triangle (Throop Avenue, Broadway, Lorimer and Middleton streets) Named for two-term New York mayor John V(liet) Lindsay (1921–2000), a liberal Republican from the East Side’s silk stocking district. Lindsay’s administration embodied the free-wheeling, countercultural, civil rights–focused politics of the 1960s and strove to humanize New York through progressive policies designed to support minorities and the poor. The absence in New York of the kind of riots that engulfed cities like Newark or Detroit at the end of the decade can partially be attributed to Lindsay’s concerted attention to inner-city dynamics. Ultimately, bureaucracy, mismanagement, and a John Lindsay, 1966 misunderstanding of the outer boroughs damaged his tenure in ofﬁce, and a quixotic 1972 presidential campaign on the Democrat ticket went nowhere. Lindsay was a tragic ﬁgure in New York politics, one who sought to bring government to the people but ended up mired in some of its worst inefﬁciencies. norther n bro oklyn | 23\n\nLorimer Street Lorimer comes from the maiden name of the mother of John and James Lorimer Graham (see Graham Avenue entry in this chapter). Lynch Street Thomas Lynch Jr. (1749–1779) of South Carolina was a signer of the Declaration of Independence but had to resign from the Continental Congress in 1776 because of illness. In an eﬀort to restore therapeutically his failing health, he and his wife left for the West Indies in 1779, but their vessel was lost at sea. Manhattan Avenue William Tooker’s classic 1901 essay “The Origin of the Name Manhattan” translates the Delaware Indian name as “island of hills.” The street had been called Ewen Avenue in the Williamsburg section (for the surveyor Daniel Ewen) and Orchard Street and Union Avenue in Greenpoint. By 1897, though, it was Manhattan Avenue throughout. Maujer Street Named for Daniel Maujer (ca. 1809–1882), a lawyer and alderman of the Fifteenth Ward. Maujer was born in Guernsey in the Channel Islands, came to the United States at the age of eighteen, and moved to Williamsburg in 1840. He was a long-term member of the Brooklyn Board of Education, including a period as its president. In 1859 Maujer was also one of the commissioners appointed to create a Brooklyn equivalent to New York’s Central Park. Prospect Park was the result of the commissioners’ negotiations. McCarren Park Born in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, and named for the Revolutionary patriot Patrick Henry, state senator Patrick Henry McCarren\n\nMcCarren Park, ca. 1997 24 | norther n bro oklyn\n\n(1847–1909) was one of Brooklyn’s most powerful Democratic Party leaders. Best known for spearheading the legislative ﬁght for the construction of Brooklyn’s second East River crossing, the Williamsburg Bridge, McCarren was no stranger to corruption and became an ally to monopolies like Standard Oil and the Sugar Trust. An ongoing nemesis of Tammany Hall and Tammany leader Charles Murphy, he drew the machine’s ire by opposing William Randolph Hearst’s 1908 gubernatorial run. Outside of Henry Ward Beecher’s, McCarren’s funeral was the most signiﬁcant (of its time) in Brooklyn. McGuinness Boulevard Greenpoint Democratic leader Peter J. McGuinness (1888–1948) was often called the “First Citizen of Greenpoint” and was a tireless advocate of what he saw as the beauties of the neighborhood. McGuinness called the industrial area, apparently without irony, the “Garden Spot of the Universe.” He began his political career as an alderman, during which time he proposed a city ordinance to ban women from smoking in public (it failed). He later took on the reins of party boss and testiﬁed in the celebrated Seabury investigation, which led to Mayor Jimmy Walker’s resignation in 1932. “Greenpoint has not only given and given to the nation, but she has given good,” McGuinness once observed, “and when history is wrote and re-wrote, Greenpoint is going to have its share of credit.” McKibbin Street John S. McKibbin purchased part of Jacob Boerum’s farm and opened this street in 1853 with his partner, Thomas Nicholls. The street and surrounding area were home to a large number of German settlers, leading to its informal designation: “Dutchtown” (Deutschtown). Meeker Avenue Attorney Samuel M. Meeker (1820–1891), Williamsburg’s corporation counsel, drafted the charter for the newly independent city in 1851. He also helped establish the Williamsburgh Savings Bank that year and later became its president. Menahan Street Named for Patrick J. Menahan, whose corset manufacturing business existed here in the early 1880s, when the street was still called Ralph Street. Meserole Avenue/Meserole Street The Meseroles were one of Greenpoint’s original ﬁve families. Having arrived from France in 1663, Jan Meserole (d. 1695) acquired land from his father-in-law, Pieter Praa (one of Greenpoint’s ﬁrst European settlers), land that his sons Jacob and Abraham later settled. Abraham Meserole was the one who suggested the street be named after the family. Middleton Street Arthur Middleton (1742–1787) came from a wealthy slaveholding planter family and was one of four South Carolina signers of the Declaration of Independence. Educated in England, he was nonetheless a ﬁerce critic of British rule. With fellow signers Edward Rutledge and Thomas Heyward Jr. (see respective entries), he was imprisoned in St. norther n bro oklyn | 25\n\nAugustine, Florida, after the British took Charleston in 1780. Today, his family’s estate, Middleton Place in South Carolina, a National Historic Landmark, is an authentically preserved nineteenth-century plantation (minus the slave labor) with the oldest landscaped gardens in the country. Monitor Street One of Greenpoint’s major historical claims is that John Ericsson’s 1862 ironclad USS Monitor was produced at the local Continental Iron Works. Participating in the Battle of Hampton Roads, the ﬁrst naval ﬁght between ironclad warships (previously ships were made largely of wood), the Monitor fought the Confederate’s ship Virginia to a draw. From then on, naval warfare changed profoundly. The Monitor eventually sank oﬀ the North Carolina coast in December 1862 and was located only in 1973. Monsignor McGolrick Park Originally Winthrop Park, it was renamed in 1941 for Monsignor Edward J. McGolrick (1857–1938), pastor of St. Cecilia’s Church on Herbert Street. Appointed in November 1888 by John Loughlin, Brooklyn’s ﬁrst bishop, McGolrick presided over a dramatic increase in the wealth and resources of the church. Moore Street Thomas C. Moore was a local Williamsburg manufacturer of netting and wire sieves. Morgan Avenue Likely named for the Morgan brothers, surveyors who were active in the mid- to late nineteenth century throughout Northern Brooklyn. Moultrie Street William Moultrie of South Carolina (1730–1805) had a highly respected military career as a colonel and general in the Continental Army. He defended Charleston against the British in 1776 but was later taken prisoner when it fell in 1780. He was released two years later in a prisoner exchange with the British general John Burgoyne. After the war, Moultrie served several terms as governor and was responsible for moving the state capital from Charleston to Columbia. Noble Street Named for James Noble, a trustee of the village of Williamsburg prior to its independence and later consolidation. Norman Avenue The ﬁrst European to settle in Greenpoint, in 1645, Dirck Volckertsen was nicknamed “the Norman,” a none-too-subtle reference to his Scandinavian origins. A ship carpenter, he received a patent from the Dutch for a large section of today’s Greenpoint and built a house on the corner of Calyer and Franklin streets. He sold much of the land to Jacob Hay in 1653, though he remained in Bushwick. Bushwick Creek was once known as Norman’s Creek. Penn Street A lawyer and one of three North Carolina signers of the Declaration of Independence, John Penn (1741–1788) served on his state’s Board of War with the responsibility of ensuring suﬃcient supplies to the militia. Peter Luger Steak House (178 Broadway) The steakhouse has been a ﬁxture in Williamsburg since 1887, when it opened as Charles Luger’s Café, Billiards, and Bowling Alley. Originally located at Driggs Avenue and South 8th 26 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nStreet, it moved to 178 Broadway in 1904. Peter Luger (1866–1941) was a German-born restaurateur who also owned an establishment on Sunrise Highway in Valley Stream, New York. His nephew, Carl Luger, was the Brooklyn chef for forty years. Powers Street William P. Powers worked as a clerk in the oﬃces of the Graham brothers (see entry in this chapter). Powers became a landowner in name only: in order for the Grahams to facilitate a speciﬁc land transaction, Powers was made a nominal proprietor of 939 lots. Provost Street Another of the original Greenpoint families, Huguenot David Provost (sometimes spelled Provoost) arrived in New Amsterdam in 1634 and became Brooklyn’s ﬁrst constable. His son was mayor of New York from 1699 to 1700. Richardson Street A Williamsburg founding father, Lemuel Richardson was on the board of directors of the ﬁrst Bank of Williamsburg and owned a ropewalk (a place where rope is made) in the area. Roberto Clemente Plaza (64 Division Avenue) Pittsburgh Pirates right ﬁelder Roberto Clemente (1934–1972) played eighteen seasons, winning the National League’s batting championship four times and being chosen League MVP in 1966 and World Series MVP in 1971. On New Year’s Eve 1972 he ﬂew to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua with medical and food supplies, enraged that previous shipments never made it there. He died when his plane crashed oﬀ the coast of his native Puerto Rico. Clemente is the ﬁrst Latino inducted into baseball’s Hall of Fame. Rodney Street America’s second-smallest state has one of its favorite sons, Caesar Rodney (1728–1784), honored in central Williamsburg. A Delaware native, Rodney was a member of the Stamp Act Congress, a delegate to the Continental Congress, a brigadier general of the Delaware militia, and fourth president of the state of Delaware (during the period of the Articles of Confederation, states had presidents). When he was Speaker of the Delaware Assembly, Rodney tried unsuccessfully to pass a law blocking the further importation of slaves. Roebling Street After studying philosophy with no less an authority than Hegel, Prussian design engineer John Augustus Roebling (1806–1869) came to the United States seeking ways to marry the material and the spiritual. Spanning the ﬁelds of metaphysics and engineering, bridge building at the time was an enterprise that spoke directly to considerations of aesthetics, reason, and science. Drawing out the Hegelian motif in Roebling’s thinking, Alan Trachtenberg observed, “Brooklyn Bridge was in its creator’s mind a principle of order. Representing nature’s laws and man’s history, the bridge subdued, in mind if not in fact, the implied chaos of millions of people making their separate ways across the river. It would give their passage a form, and link them in consciousness to their national destinies as Amerinorther n bro oklyn | 27\n\ncans.” The suspension bridge, which Roebling revolutionized, was for him the product of such thinking. After designing and surveying the site for the bridge, Roebling suﬀered a fatal accident, and his son, Washington Roebling (1837–1926), took over the project and added various important design improvements. Washington oversaw the bridge’s construction until stricken with “the bends,” a disease catalyzed by working in the massive caissons. An invalid, he still directed the work on the bridge from his 110 Columbia Heights window, though it was a third Roebling, Washington’s wife, Emily (1843–1903), who, teaching herself civil engineering, carried forth the on-site supervision through opening day in 1883. Ross Street A lawyer, Tory, and Crown Prosecutor, Pennsylvanian George Ross (1730–1779) was not an obvious choice to become a Continental Congress delegate and, ultimately, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Flag designer Betsy Ross was the wife of his nephew. Rush Street Benjamin Rush (1745–1813), a chemist and signer of the Declaration of Independence, was one of the country’s most acclaimed physicians and a man of some paradox: in the forefront of the care for the mentally ill, he also taught the disavowed practice of bloodletting. Politically there was little ambiguity to his positions. Rush stood at the center of the day’s progressive politics, adamantly opposing slavery and capital punishment and supporting free public schooling and better quality education for women. Rutledge Street Attorney Edward Rutledge (1749–1800) was the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence. After the Revolution, Rutledge served as a representative in the U.S. Congress and then as governor of South Carolina until his death. St. Barbara’s Catholic Church (138 Bleecker Street) Built in 1910, St. Barbara’s is one of Brooklyn’s tallest buildings. The church was named for the daughter of local brewer Leonard Eppig, a major contributor to the church. St. Stanislaus Kostka’s School (12 Newel Street) St. Stanislaus Kostka (1550–1568) was born to a Polish noble family and beatiﬁed by Pope Paul V in 1605. Scholes Street James Scholes in 1831 purchased the land where the street lies from the heirs of Jeremiah Remsen. Seigel Street Named for Franz Sigel (1824–1902) (an “e” was added to the street name), a Franz Sigel, ca. 1861 28 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nrefugee from the 1848 revolutions in Europe who became a journalist, superintendent of St. Louis’s public school system, and later brigadier and major general in the Civil War. Though he eventually lost his military command, he was famous for recruiting German Americans to abolitionism and the union struggle. Stanwix Street English general John Stanwix (ca. 1690–1765) fought in the Seven Years War and helped build what was later named Fort Stanwix, now a national monument in Rome, New York. Stephen A. Rudd Playground (Bushwick Avenue, Aberdeen Street, and Granite Street) After receiving a law degree at the age of forty and then working as Police Department secretary during the mayoralty of his friend John Hylan, Stephen A. Rudd (1874–1936) served fourteen years as a Brooklyn Democratic alderman and then as U.S. congressman representing the areas of Bushwick and East New York. Stockholm Street Named for two landholding brothers, Andrew and Abraham Stockholm, who provided six lots of land on Bushwick Avenue for the building of the Second Dutch Reformed Church of South Bushwick in the early 1850s. The church’s ﬁrst pastor was John S. Himrod (see entry in this chapter). Suydam Street An important Dutch family and one of Brooklyn’s oldest, the Suydams owned a farm that comprised a large section of Bushwick. For several centuries before it was razed in 1899 the family’s Bushwick homestead stood on Evergreen Avenue and Madison Street. The Suydam’s original ancestor is probably Hendrick Rycken, whose children were said to adopt the name Suydam for “South of the Dam” (suyt-dam in Dutch). They also had property in what was then the town of Bedford, and there is a Suydam Place today in Crown Heights. Taylor Street Irish-born George Taylor (1716–1781) was a Pennsylvania signer of the Declaration of Independence, a member of the Committee of Correspondence, and a businessman with a proﬁtable iron concern. Though a wealthy slaveowner, he became heavily indebted later in life. Ten Eyck Street Originally of Moers, Lowlands Germany, Coenraedt Ten Eyck (1617–1686) immigrated in 1651 to New Amsterdam. Coenties Slip in Manhattan, where he lived, comes from a contraction of his own name and that of his second wife, Antje. He had many descendents, including William Ten Eyck, a deacon at the Second Dutch Reformed Church of South Bushwick. Thornton Street New Hampshire signer of the Declaration of Independence, physician Matthew Thornton (1714–1803) was a leading citizen and landholder in Londonderry responsible for writing the ﬁrst state constitution. Union Avenue Unlike Union Street (see chapter 3), the name of this Northern Brooklyn street has as its referent the Civil War. Van Dam Street From a prominent New York family during the colonial penorther n bro oklyn | 29\n\nriod, Rip Van Dam (ca. 1660–1749) was brieﬂy acting colonial governor (1731–32) before William Cosby. Once Cosby took the reins, Van Dam would anger his successor by vocally defending newspaper editor John Peter Zenger, whom Cosby claimed had slandered him. Rip Van Dam was also the owner of the building on Nassau Street in Manhattan where the New Theatre put on the ﬁrst professional play in North America, George Farquhar’s comedy “The Recruiting Oﬃcer.” Manhattan’s Van Dam Street is named for Rip Van Dam’s grandson Anthony, a city alderman and Tory who ﬂed to London after the Revolutionary War. Varick Avenue/Varick Street Richard Varick (1753–1831) served under General Philip Schuyler during the Revolutionary War’s Battle of Saratoga before moving to West Point and becoming aide-de-camp to Benedict Arnold. Implicated in Arnold’s treason by association, Varick was arrested but eventually cleared. He later became private secretary to George Washington and mayor of New York from 1791 to 1801. Varick Street in Manhattan also bears his name. Wallabout Street The name comes from a corruption of the Dutch Waal Bocht, meaning “Walloon Bay” or “Bay of Foreigners.” This small Williamsburg street is the only remaining identifying marker of the once thriving early waterfront area. The name was variously employed throughout Brooklyn’s history: initially a village bordering the water, then the name of the bay, and later that of a well-known neighborhood wholesale produce exchange market. During the American Revolution, Wallabout Bay was the site of the nightmarish prison ships that took the lives of some 11,500 Americans (see Prison Ship Martyrs’ Monument, chapter 4). Walton Street Originally from Virginia, George Walton (1741–1804) moved to Georgia and became a delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Battle of Savannah in 1778, he was captured and later freed through a prisoner exchange. Following the war, Walton served as Georgia’s chief justice, governor, and senator. Waterbury Street Born in Groton Falls, Connecticut, Noah Waterbury (d. 1862) became a shoemaker in Brooklyn after moving there at the age of ﬁfteen. He later owned a distillery (on South 2nd Street and then on South 9th Street) and became active in real estate. In 1827, Waterbury was appointed the ﬁrst president of the village of Williamsburg and later the ﬁrst president of the Williamsburgh City Bank at its founding in 1852. Weirﬁeld Street This street is named for local resident Thomas Weirﬁeld, a surveyor active in public aﬀairs. Whipple Street William Whipple (1730–1785) was a seaman, merchant, New Hampshire delegate to the Continental Congress, and signer of the Declaration of Independence. As a sea captain he was responsible for transporting slaves from the coast of Africa to Portsmouth, and as brigadier general he 30 | norther n bro oklyn\n\nsuccessfully led the New Hampshire militia against General Burgoyne at Saratoga and Stillwater. Prince Whipple, one of William Whipple’s slaves, fought in the Revolutionary War and is the only African American in Emanuel Leutze’s classic 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware. Williamsburg Bridge Opened in 1903 and slightly longer than the Brooklyn Bridge, it was called for a time the “New Eastern District Bridge” and the “New East River Bridge.” Wilson Avenue Named for the twenty-eighth president, the street was called Hamburg Avenue until 1918, when anti-German sentiment resulting from World War I led to its renaming. Wilson Street A leading constitutional lawyer raised in Scotland, James Wilson (1742–1798) was key to breaking Pennsylvania’s deadlock at the Second Continental Congress and to getting state approval of the Declaration of Independence. After the war, he was appointed to Philadelphia’s Constitutional Convention and in 1789 became a justice of the Supreme Court. Despite his judicial prominence, Wilson was drawn to gambling and proﬁteering and in the 1790s became involved in an ill-founded scheme to recruit European immigrants to the West. To avoid debtors’ prison, he was forced, while remaining associate justice of the Supreme Court, to leave Philadelphia (then the nation’s capital) for Burlington, Vermont. Withers Street Originally from Virginia, Reuben Withers was the proprietor of the Houston Street Ferry. He was involved in China-related trade as part of the ﬁrm Withers & Heard and was president of the Bank of the State of New York. Withers married the daughter of David Dunham (see entry in this chapter). Woodhull Hospital (760 Broadway) Two years after commencing a ferry in 1800 from North 2nd Street to Grand Street, Richard Woodhull began mapping out the farming community then called Cripplebush (see chapter introduction.) Wythe Avenue/Wythe Place Eminent Virginian lawyer and teacher George Wythe (1726–1806) lived in Williamsburg (Virginia) and was a tutor of Thomas Jeﬀerson. Wythe was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and upon the war’s conclusion became a professor of law at the College of William and Mary. Wythe was still active at the age of eighty-one, when he was poisoned with arsenic-laced coﬀee by, most suspect, his grandnephew.\n\nnorther n bro oklyn | 31\n\n2 | Downtown Brooklyn Brooklyn Heights, Downtown–City Center, DUMBO, Fulton Ferry, Vinegar Hill A map of Downtown Brooklyn appears on the following pages.\n\nDown Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass (DUMBO), 1995 32 |\n\nFulton Ferry Landing, late 1980s\n\nDowntown Brooklyn, 1942\n\n| 33\n\nLITTLE ST\n\nSON HUD\n\nT LL S SHA MAR N ST JO H\n\nAV\n\nT NS S EVA H AR\n\nST TH MOU PLY\n\nRI S\n\nWA TE RS T\n\nL\n\nQ UE\n\nEN\n\nT CT S SPE PRO\n\nDS S SAN\n\nN ST\n\nH ST\n\nST\n\nAT\n\nBU\n\nSH\n\nAV\n\nEX\n\nT\n\nL AL P\n\nR H ED CAT McLaughlin Park ST ARY TILL\n\nMAN P LZ E\n\nW PLZ MAN CAD\n\nHENRY ST\n\nHICKS ST\n\nWILLOW ST\n\nHEIGHTS COLUMBIA\n\nCadman Plaza Park\n\nFL\n\nHP T EC\n\nCLARK ST\n\nT\n\nDGE\n\nREN CE S T\n\nLO WIL\n\nPEA RL ST\n\nCOURT ST\n\nDOWNT CITY CE\n\nGAL\n\nMONTAGUE TER\n\nBor oug h Hall\n\nRED HOO K LA\n\nE ST MONTAGU REMSEN ST\n\nGRACE CT\n\nLAW\n\nT\n\nColumbus Park\n\nNT ST\n\nALLEY GRACE CT\n\nMY R\n\nB RI\n\nJAY S\n\nH PL\n\nST MS ADA\n\nPIERREPONT PL\n\nPIERREPO\n\nT EC\n\nMONROE PL\n\ne\n\nLOVE LA\n\nL\n\nMetr otech Commo n\n\nKor ean Wa r Veteran s Plaza\n\nCOLLEGE PL\n\nPr om en ad\n\nBROOKLYN HEIGHTS\n\nS ST\n\nD ST FIEL DUF\n\nDGE BRI ZA CT PLA\n\nD ST COR CON ST PEL CHA\n\nCA D\n\nY ST CRANBERR\n\nST\n\nT\n\nT GE S BRID\n\nT H IG\n\nPL\n\nMIDDAGH ST\n\nPINEAPPLE\n\nYS\n\nTrinity Park ST SAU N AS\n\nT\n\nRL S\n\nEVERITT ST\n\nOSS\n\nCR RED\n\nORANGE ST\n\nNAV\n\nD SAN\n\nPOPLAR ST\n\nSquibb Park\n\nT\n\nK ST YOR WAY SS E R P S EX\n\nPE A\n\nVINE ST\n\nEY\n\nD ST\n\nE ST\n\nLY N-\n\nNT S\n\nK YOR\n\nVINEGAR HILL\n\nT\n\nOK BRO\n\nJAY S\n\nEP\n\nT MS S ADA\n\nDOUGHTY ST\n\nT RL S PEA\n\nST\n\nUL TO\n\nAG\n\nY LLE\n\nH\n\nFURMAN ST\n\nELIZABET PL\n\nFULTON BROOKLYN BRID GE FERRY OLD F\n\nET A\n\nTON I NG\n\nK ST\n\nARD HOW LEY AL T ST N FR O\n\nFLE\n\nT ER S WAT\n\nD OC\n\nST\n\nOR\n\nDUMBO H WAS\n\nDO\n\nCK\n\nFulton Ferr y Landing & Park\n\nT\n\nST\n\nW\n\nM OU\n\nN MAI\n\nNE\n\nPL Y\n\nCH\n\nFRO\n\nDG BRI\n\nS ST\n\nEmpi re – Fulton Ferry Park\n\nAN\n\nH ST\n\nALL\n\nGOL\n\nADA M\n\nN ST JOH\n\nMA NH AT TA NB RI DG E\n\nON\n\nT ER S WAT\n\nHUNTS LA ST EMON JORAL\n\nST LIVINGSTON\n\nSCHERMER\n\nBOERU M PL\n\nCLINTON ST\n\nSIDNEY PL\n\nGARDEN PL\n\nHICKS ST\n\nHORN ST\n\nSTATE ST\n\nS\n\nBO\n\nC\n\nPL COLUMBIA NS U EE N-Q KLY BROO FURMAN ST\n\nWILLOW PL\n\nHENRY ST\n\nAITKEN PL\n\nLITTLE ST\n\nSON HUD\n\nT LL S SHA MAR N ST JO H\n\nAV\n\nEVA\n\nT NS S H AR\n\nST TH MOU PLY\n\nRI S ON\n\nT ER S WAT\n\nALL EY\n\nGOL D ST\n\nFRO\n\nNT S\n\nT\n\nNAV\n\nE ST\n\nDG BRI\n\nBr ooklyn Navy Yard Industria l Park\n\nST\n\nK AV\n\nPAR\n\nAT\n\nBU\n\nSH\n\nAV\n\nT\n\nL AL P\n\nST.\n\nAV\n\nRD\n\nWA\n\nTLE\n\nF\n\nT\n\nLAN\n\nSS\n\nASH\n\nM YR\n\nED\n\nD ST\n\nT\n\nG OL\n\nZE\n\nR H ED CAT McLaughlin Park ST ARY TILL\n\nS NCE PRI\n\nEX\n\nPL RN BU AU\n\nT YS NAV\n\nFL\n\nY SWA RES EXP S N E QUE YNOKL BRO\n\nD ST\n\nD ST FIEL DUF\n\nDGE BRI ZA CT PLA\n\nD ST COR CON ST PEL CHA\n\nST\n\nT\n\nST\n\nCO R\n\nT GE S BRID\n\nRL S H H IG\n\nPL\n\nCO N\n\nAV\n\nPE A\n\nTrinity Park ST SAU N AS\n\nN TO RL CA\n\nCommodor e John Barr y Park\n\nT DS AN\n\nT DS OR XF NO AV ND TLA OR NP\n\nS ST\n\nT CT S SPE\n\nS ST\n\nG AV SHIN FLU\n\nL TP OT LLI NE\n\nD SAN\n\nNAVY YARD\n\nL ER MB CU\n\nVINEGAR HILL\n\nT\n\nHI ELP AD\n\nK YOR\n\nYS\n\nDP L\n\nL\n\nAV\n\nT\n\nST\n\nV\n\nLB A\n\nA DE K\n\nFE\n\nA SH D LAN PL L\n\nP LL\n\nV\n\nV\n\nWE\n\nNA\n\nLB A\n\nCK\n\nDS O\n\nST\n\nA DE K\n\nRO\n\nHU\n\nRL\n\nFULTON ST\n\nSTATE ST\n\nATLANTIC AV\n\nHANOVER PL\n\nBOND ST\n\nELM PL\n\nGALLATIN PL\n\nSCHERMERHORN ST\n\nBOERU M PL\n\nCLINTON ST\n\nHORN ST\n\nY ST\n\nST.\n\nCE S\n\nE TT AYE LAF\n\nLIVINGSTON ST\n\nSCHERMER\n\nG HB\n\nL\n\nQ EE S\n\nST\n\nAT BU SH\n\nY ST GHB LOU WIL\n\nST LIVINGSTON\n\nEN PL\n\nLO U\n\nET P\n\nAL B FL\n\nDOWNTOWNCITY CENTER\n\nRED HOO K LA\n\nW IL\n\nFL E\n\nST FAIR\n\nFLEET ST\n\nE\n\nST\n\nREN\n\nPEA\n\nCOURT ST\n\nBor oug h Hall\n\nDGE\n\nLAW\n\nT\n\nColumbus Park\n\nTL E\n\nB RI\n\nJAY S\n\nH PL\n\nST MS ADA\n\nT EC\n\nMY R\n\nN AD\n\nD FIEL DUF\n\nMetr otech Commo n\n\nKor ean Wa r Veteran s Plaza\n\nME PR O\n\nALBEE SQ\n\nHP T EC\n\nGROVE PL FL A\n\nTB U\n\nS\n\nH\n\nS\n\nBO\n\nC\n\nA\n\nMunsee Delaware speaking group, the Marechkawieck were the earliest known inhabitants in the neighborhoods covered in this chapter, an area that conforms to the town of Breukelen’s original boundaries. With their ﬂight, a function of war and subjugation, Dutch settlements were built along the waterfront and became known as the Wallabout. From a corruption of the Dutch Waal Bocht, meaning “Bay of Foreigners” or “Walloon Bay” (Walloons being inhabitants of an area in Belgium), the name likely derives from a Walloon, Joris Rapelye, one of Brooklyn’s earliest European immigrants who secured his land through a Dutch West India Company patent. John Jackson and his brothers in 1781 purchased the property from Rapelye’s descendents, and they in turn were bought out two decades later by the U.S. Navy, who established the New York Naval Shipyard, the oﬃcial name of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In the early nineteenth century, immigration redeﬁned the area’s demographics. Vinegar Hill, east of the Manhattan Bridge anchorage, oﬀers a case in point. A public-relations gambit by John Jackson to recruit new residents from the inﬂux of Irish newcomers, the name is drawn from the 1798 Battle of Vinegar Hill in Wexford County, Ireland, in which Irish rebels were defeated in a clash with the English. By the middle of the century nearly half of Vinegar Hill’s residents were Irish, many of them dockworkers at the Navy Yard, and the neighborhood was informally called “Irish Town.” In the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge stands today’s Fulton Ferry section, immortalized in Walt Whitman’s classic 1856 poem “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.” Once simply “The Ferry” (Het Veer in Dutch), it was the departure site of Cornelius Dircksen’s 1642 ferry, the ﬁrst to traverse the river. This medium of transport, even in the pre-steam age, led to the development of the area and its key role in Brooklyn proper. Robert Fulton’s radical nineteenth-century innovation accelerated those trends exponentially. d ow ntow n bro oklyn | 37\n\nTurning inland, Brooklyn Heights, whose name refers to the bluﬀs over the waterfront on which this neighborhood was built, is considered New York City’s ﬁrst suburban community. Originally called Clover Hill, underscoring the bucolic nature of this longtime rural area, the Heights was developed in the early nineteenth century in large part through the eﬀorts of Hezekiah Pierrepont, who sought to create an exclusive suburban oasis. The area had been dominated by a small group of landowning families—including the Middaghs, Remsens, and Hickses—evidenced by the streets that bear their names. Immediately to the north, DUMBO, named literally for its location “Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass,” spans the industrial neighborhood between Main and Bridge streets. The acronym is attributed to artists who conceived the name in the 1970s. The site of a thriving manufacturing area, DUMBO has in the past been home to Antoine Zerega’s macaroni factory, thought to be the ﬁrst pasta factory in America; the Arbuckle Company, whose claim to fame was packed coﬀee in bags; and Robert Gair’s ﬁrm, which produced folding paper boxes. Adams Street Originally Congress Street, it was renamed by Port Collector Joshua Sands (see entry in this chapter) after second U.S. president John Adams (1735–1826), who nominated Sands to his post. Before the nation’s capital moved to Philadelphia, Adams served as Washington’s vice president in New York. Aitken Place Native Brooklynite Monsignor Ambrose S. Aitken (ca. 1889–1959) was a pastor in several Brooklyn and Long Island churches prior to his eighteen-year aﬃliation with St. Charles Borromeo Roman Catholic Church (on Sidney Place). The street was named in 1960. Anchorage Place Anchorage Place may relate to the once prominent shipping trade along the East River or to the anchoring cables of the Manhattan Bridge, which was under construction when the street was named. Bridge Street Intended as the site for an East River crossing, it instead ended up smack between two others: the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. Brooklyn Borough Hall (209 Joralemon Street) Built on land sold for $53,000 by the Pierreponts and Remsens, Borough Hall was originally called City Hall at its completion in 1848. The name was downgraded when Brooklyn lost its independent metropolitan status a half century later. In the annals of lost Brooklyn names stands Alois Fabry Jr., commissioned in 1937 by the Federal Arts Project of the Works Project Administration (WPA) to paint two monumental nine-hundred-square-foot murals of Brooklyn’s history for Borough Hall’s central rotunda. One panel illustrated Brooklyn’s past 38 | d ow ntow n bro oklyn\n\nBrooklyn Borough Hall: Brooklyn—Past and Present, 1938\n\nBrooklyn—Past and Present mural study\n\n| 39\n\nBrooklyn—Past and Present mural study\n\n(1609–1898), spotlighting the usual suspects (Beecher, Whitman) and events (the Battle of Brooklyn, building of the Brooklyn Bridge); the other panel illustrated the postconsolidation period including Floyd Bennett Field and the subway’s extension to Brooklyn, elements that reﬂect Brooklyn’s modernization. After the completion of the murals in 1938/9, Fabry was the target of conservative backlash from politicians and the press and faced rebuke for his alleged “progressive” style and “subversive” content; a ﬁgure in the murals that bears some resemblance to Lenin may have played an additional role in the critics’ aversion. Armed with Mayor LaGuardia’s endorsement, Brooklyn Borough President John Cashmore cast the ﬁnal blow and forced the murals’ removal in 1946. Sixty years later, their whereabouts remain unknown. Eerily reminiscent of the destruction of Diego Rivera’s Rockefeller Center mural in 1934, the plight of Fabry’s WPA murals is a forgotten stain on the history of Kings County.\n\n40 | d ow ntow n bro oklyn\n\nBrooklyn Bridge Formally established in 1869 by the New York Bridge Company (composed of New York and Brooklyn board members), the bridge was referred to by several names before its completion, including the “East River Bridge,” the “Great East River Bridge,” and the “Great Suspension Bridge.” Already in 1873 the New York Tribune had dubbed it the “Brooklyn Bridge,” though this was far from standard. Even on opening day, May 24, 1883, with President Chester Arthur in attendance and over Brooklyn Bridge 150,000 persons ready to make the crossing, the bridge was dedicated as “The New York and Brooklyn Bridge” (though the New York Times report of the event used “Brooklyn Bridge,” asserting that it was “decidedly Brooklyn’s celebration”). Not long thereafter, probably due to the boon for Brooklyn that the bridge brought, the swing toward the name Brooklyn Bridge began in full. A Board of Aldermen resolution on January 26, 1915, made it oﬃcial. Brooklyn Heights Esplanade/Promenade An esplanade is a raised walkway often designed for recreational purposes and usually near a body of water. While the formal name of this raised walkway covering Orange to Remsen streets and cantilevered over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) is the “Esplanade,” it is commonly known as the “Promenade.” Brooklyn Heights Esplanade/Promenade, 1970s Dating from 1951 d ow ntow n bro oklyn | 41\n\nit is the city’s second esplanade/promenade; the ﬁrst was completed in Manhattan’s Carl Schurz Park thirteen years earlier. Brooklyn Historical Society (128 Pierrepont Street) Established by Henry Pierrepont (1808–1888) as the Long Island Historical Society in 1863, the institution’s name was changed in 1985 to reﬂect more accurately its majority holdings. Cadman Plaza Born and raised in England, Reverend Dr. Samuel Parkes Cadman (1864–1936) was one of the country’s leading ministers and the head of Brooklyn’s Central Congregational Church on Hancock Street near Franklin Avenue for thirty-ﬁve years. Progressive in orientation, Cadman was famous for his strongly held views, whether attacking the ROTC for “encouraging belief in violence as the ﬁnal resort in international diﬀerences,” fulminating against loyalty oaths for teachers—“impertinent interference with academic freedom,” or disputing the existence of a ﬁre-and-brimstone hell. Cadman’s popularity reached across the country with his noted radio sermons, and he is credited with coining the term “Cathedral of Commerce” to describe the Woolworth Building at its 1913 opening. Cathedral Place Named for nearby St. James Roman Catholic Church, the seat of the bishop of Brooklyn. Founded by the Irish-born Peter Turner (1787– 1863), when built in 1822 it was Long Island’s ﬁrst Roman Catholic church. Chapel Street Named for the chapel associated with St. James Roman Catholic Church (see Cathedral Place entry above). Clark Street The street was planned by the Hicks brothers in 1806 and named for Captain William Clark, who set up a ropewalk (a place for manufacturing rope) that traversed Henry and Furman streets. Clinton Street (see Clinton Avenue, chapter 4) College Place This street is named for the short-lived Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies, whose nearby four-story (conspicuous for its time) Hicks Street building had its cornerstone laid in 1829 by General Lafayette. At the building’s dedication, St. Ann’s Church’s Reverend Charles McIlvaine emphasized that young women “should be trained to think and be enabled to take the position of intellectual beings wherever they may go.” Until its demise a mere thirteen years later, father and son principals Isaac Van Doren and Jacob L. Van Doren sought to provide equal education to women and “aﬀord young ladies the same advantages in acquiring an education that are enjoyed by the other sex in our colleges.” Columbia Heights The Heights refer to the estate of Hezekiah Beers Pierrepont, whose property scenically overlooked the water in the early nineteenth century. His mansion, “Four Chimneys,” carried a view (after 1814) of Fulton’s landmark steam ferry, for which Pierrepont was an important investor. Concord Street Most likely named for the historically signiﬁcant town of Con42 | d ow ntow n bro oklyn\n\ncord, Massachusetts, an early battle site of the Revolutionary War and an inspirational venue for the literary masterpieces of Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Walt Whitman’s grade school stood on Concord and Adams streets. Court Street With Brooklyn chartered as a city in 1834, plans for a new city hall were set in motion. Astride the new hotel de ville, a court building was to be built on a street renamed for the courthouse. According to plan, in 1835 George Street changed to Court Street, but it took until 1848 for Gamaliel King’s Greek Revival City Hall to reach completion. As for the courthouse, it was ﬁnished only in 1865 and bypassed Court Street entirely, ending up instead on Joralemon Street (it was torn down in 1952).\n\nCourt Street, 1928\n\nCranberry Street (together with Orange and Pineapple streets) Conventional wisdom today lays the idiosyncratic fruit namings with the Hicks brothers. Local legend is more intriguing: Lady Middagh, in her consternation over solipsistic landowners naming streets for themselves, took the street signs down and replaced them with these. While the city elders were displeased with Middagh’s bold act, she convinced the Board of Aldermen to accept the new names. In this telling, it is likely that she also named Willow and Poplar streets. d ow ntow n bro oklyn | 43\n\nDoughty Street The street is named for a member of one of Brooklyn’s earliest families, Charles Doughty (1759–1844), a lawyer and trustee during the 1816 incorporation of Brooklyn village and later village president. In Brooklyn’s ﬁrst ever act of manumission on record (1797), Doughty freed his twentyeight-year-old slave Caesar Foster. “Having been largely instrumental in procuring the passage of the emancipation act, by which . . . slavery was abolished in New York state,” the Brooklyn Daily Eagle recalled decades later, African Americans “used to assemble on the anniversary of emancipation day and proceed to Mr. Doughty’s house, carrying turkeys, chickens, ducks and geese in great quantities . . . large enough to give his whole family dyspepsia for a month.” Doughty’s life took an unexpected turn when he jettisoned his Quaker past for Swedenborgian theology, named for Emmanuel Swedenborg (1688 – 1772), who believed that the second coming was already here. Doughty’s conversion destroyed his thriving law practice. Never one to duck from controversy, he crossed the river to New York City and spent a number of years as pastor of a Swedenborgian congregation on Pearl Street, where the New York County Courthouse now stands. Dufﬁeld Street Dr. John Duﬃeld of Pennsylvania was a surgeon during the Revolutionary War and later one of Brooklyn’s ﬁrst physicians. Elizabeth Place Dating from the 1820s the street is possibly named for Elizabeth Cornell; the prominent Cornell family built “Four Chimneys,” later the large home of Hezekiah Pierrepont (see Columbia Heights entry in this chapter). George Washington brieﬂy used the premises as his headquarters during the Battle of Brooklyn. Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park (New Dock Street at Water Street) Named for the postbellum warehouse complex (Empire Stores) that once stocked food items including coﬀee beans, grains, and sugar. The warehouse is still standing on Water Street (See Fulton Ferry mention in the introduction.) Evans Street Captain Samuel Evans (d. 1824) worked as Captain Commandant at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard. With John Little (see entry in this chapter) he established a ferry that ran from the Navy Yard area to New York. Everit Street Quaker Thomas Everit and his descendents are the source for this Brooklyn street. The Everits were longstanding butchers who once ran a slaughterhouse on the corner of Fulton and Columbia streets. One can ﬁnd an additional “t” at the name’s end in older maps, but the current spelling is the correct one. Fleet Place In the mid-seventeenth century, British navy captain Thomas Fleet transported his family on his own boat from England to Huntington, Long Island. Descendent Samuel Fleet (1786–1864), for whom the street is named, was the town’s postmaster, local librarian, and principal of Huntington Academy, and published Long Island’s ﬁrst magazine, the Long Island Jour44 | d ow ntow n bro oklyn\n\nnal of Philosophy and Cabinet of Variety. A slaveholder, Fleet moved to Brooklyn and became wealthy through farming and property ownership. Fox Square (Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue) Built by William Fox of Twentieth Century Fox in 1929, the former four-thousand-seat Fox Theater in the 1950s and 1960s became home to popular rock concerts emceed by Murray “the K” Kaufman. It was demolished in 1970. Front Street Like Front Streets elsewhere, the street is named descriptively to highlight the fact that it once graced (or “fronted”) the waterfront. Landﬁll changed all that. Fulton Street Through his steam engine, inventor and engineer Robert Fulton (1765–1815) helped change the landscape of nineteenth-century Brooklyn. Seven years after Fulton’s steam-powered Clermont sailed from New York to Albany, and 172 years after the ﬁrst rowboat ferry of Cornelius Dircksen crossed the waters of the East River, Fulton’s 1814 Nassau steam ferry made the traverse from Brooklyn to New York. Old Fulton Street, part of the original Fulton Street, still stands by the river. Laid out in 1704, Fulton Street followed the road of the old Kings Highway. By the mid-nineteenth century it became the epicenter of Brooklyn’s commercial downtown. Fulton himself is buried at Trinity Church, just several blocks from Manhattan’s own Fulton Street.\n\nFulton Street, August 12, 1915 d ow ntow n bro oklyn | 45\n\nFurman Street One of Kings County’s earliest judges, William Furman (1765– 1832) was a state legislator, an early Brooklyn village trustee, an overseer of the poor, and a close compatriot of DeWitt Clinton’s. His better-known son, Gabriel Furman (1800–1854), became a municipal court judge, a state senator, and a failed Whig candidate for lieutenant governor. Gabriel was also a chronicler of Brooklyn history and in 1824 published Notes, Geographical and Historical, Relating to the Town of Brooklyn. Garden Place This street refers to the site of Philip Livingston’s country home garden. It represented one of two walks behind Livingston’s (later Joralemon’s) mansion. Grace Court/Grace Court Alley Richard Upjohn’s 1847 Gothic Revival Grace Church on Hicks Street and Grace Court is the source of the street name. Upjohn had recently completed Trinity Church in Manhattan and was to embark on another (Episcopal) Grace Church, this time in Newark, New Jersey. A number of Brooklyn’s leading families including the Pierreponts, Middaghs, and Packers, helped in the church’s establishment. Harry Chapin Playground (Columbia Heights and Middagh Street) Brooklyn Heights–raised musician and political activist Harry Chapin (1942–1981) is best remembered for his FM rock staple “Cats in the Cradle” and the narrative-driven compositions “Taxi” and “Sequel.” He was known to perform as many as 250 concerts per year, half of them for charity. He died in an accident on the Long Island Expressway. Henry Street Dr. Thomas W. Henry, a well-known physician and president of the Medical Society of the County of Kings in the 1830s, lived at Sands and Jay streets and was said to be the family doctor to the Middaghs. Hicks Street In honor of their family, the street was named by the brothers John Middagh and Jacob Middagh Hicks. Their grandfather John Hicks emigrated from England in 1642, and their father, Jacob Hicks, a lumber dealer appropriately known as “Wood” Hicks, married into the Middagh clan. For many years the Hicks brothers operated the sole ferry between Brooklyn and New York. At the end of the Revolutionary War the Hicks family’s land grew to cover a good portion of today’s Brooklyn Heights. High Street Purely descriptive, the street was so named because it was situated on a spot more elevated than adjacent Sands Street. Hunts Lane Probably named for John Hunt, who purchased land from the Pierreponts in 1842. Jay Street The ﬁrst chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Jay (1745–1829) was a delegate to both the First and Second ContiJohn Jay 46 | d ow ntow n bro oklyn\n\nnental Congresses. Though skeptical at ﬁrst about independence from Britain, he became a key diplomatic ﬁgure during the Revolutionary period. After the war he penned ﬁve of the Federalist Papers, essays that sought to gain popular support for the proposed constitution. Washington nominated Jay to his Supreme Court position, where he remained from 1789 to 1795, helping establish the court’s initial rules and procedures. Jay also drafted New York’s constitution and became a two-term governor of New York after stepping down from the Court. John Street Likely named for landowner John Jackson, as the street extended through his land. Joralemon Street A harness and saddle maker originally from New Jersey and later Flatbush, Teunis (the Dutch form of Anthony) Joralemon (1760–1840) came to Brooklyn Heights in 1803 and acquired part of the old Livingston estate. A prominent landowner, Joralemon became an elder at the Reformed Church, which boasted a veritable who’s who of Brooklyn names including Abraham Remsen, Leﬀert Leﬀerts, Peter Bergen, and Theodorus Polhemus. Joralemon became famous for bitterly opposing the opening of streets through his property, though he occasionally lost to the village commissioner: in 1834 Clinton Street, for example, was cut through Joralemon’s land despite his antipathy to the street’s namesake and his “big ditch” (DeWitt Clinton was responsible for the Erie Canal). Two of Joralemon’s daughters married Brooklyn mayors, Samuel Smith (see chapter 3) and Thomas G. Talmadge. Junior’s Restaurant (386 Flatbush Avenue Extension/DeKalb Avenue) Established in 1950 and one of Brooklyn’s hallowed eating establishments, the restaurant was named for founder Harry Rosen’s (1904–1996) sons, Marvin and Walter. Fulton Street on the north side of the restaurant is now secondarily named for the cheesecake impresario. Lawrence Street Named for Captain Charles K. Lawrence, who married Susan Duﬃeld, daughter of Revolutionary War army surgeon John Duﬃeld (see entry in this chapter). Little Street Tavern owner John Little was responsible, with Captain Samuel Evans (see entry in this chapter), for establishing a ferry from the base of Little Street in Brooklyn to Walnut Street in New York. Livingston Street Born in Albany, Philip Livingston (1716–1778) was one of New York’s four signers (and the only Brooklyn signer) of the Declaration of Independence. It was at Livingston’s forty-acre estate in Brooklyn Heights that George Washington and his oﬃcers made the decision to retreat from Long Island. After Livingston ﬂed with his family to Kingston, New York, where the state capital was brieﬂy located before moving to Poughkeepsie, British and Hessian forces occupied the estate, transforming it into a brewery and hospital. Teunis Joralemon (see entry in this chapter) d ow ntow n bro oklyn | 47\n\nlater acquired part of Livingston’s estate. Livingston’s brother William and cousin Robert R. were also delegates to the Continental Congress and Revolutionary leaders. Love Lane Dating from before the Revolutionary War, this lane divided the DeBevoise and Pierrepont estates. Two older, unmarried members of the DeBevoise family, John and Robert, adopted young Sarah, the daughter of their housekeeper. She later charmed a wealth of gentlemen callers. According to local folklore, Love Lane comes from the so-called love-lines—initials of Sarah DeBevoise and her suitors—scrawled across the fence near their home. Main Street The street was slated to become the main commercial thoroughfare of the new Olympia village, an early waterfront settlement eventually subsumed into greater Brooklyn. McLaughlin Park (Tillary and Jay streets) Democratic Party political boss and nineteenth-century power broker Hugh McLaughlin (1823–1904) ran Kings County as if it were his personal ﬁefdom. Not unlike his New York doppelganger Boss Tweed, with whom he shared a striking physical resemblance, McLaughlin distributed patronage like candy and proﬁted from insider information and sweetheart real estate deals. Starting out as a lieutenant in Henry C. Murphy’s Democratic Party organization, he rose two decades later to the helm of the Kings County machine, until Pat McCarren (see chapter 1) wrested control in 1903. It was during McLaughlin’s tenure that close associate William Kingsley and mentor Murphy chartered the New York Bridge Company, which built the Brooklyn Bridge. Middagh Street Named for the Middagh family, one of Brooklyn Heights’ oldest. It is said to have been named either by the Hicks brothers for their maternal ancestors or by the Middaghs themselves—likely by John Middagh, son of Aert, for whom the street was once named. Monroe Place Laid out in the 1830s, Monroe Place has the distinction of being Brooklyn Heights’ widest block and the highest point in the area. Named for U.S. president James Monroe (1758–1831), who moved to New York City in 1830 and spent the last year of his life on Prince Street in Manhattan. Montague Street Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689 – 1762), as her name was originally James Monroe spelled, was an English writer, early feminist, and member of the Pi"
