        "text": "College of Journalism and Mass Communications named scholarship donors and the students they support were recognized at a scholarship recognition brunch in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln City Campus Union on Oct. 8, 2022.\n\n“Scholarship donations have a direct and immediate impact on students,” said Shari Veil, dean of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. “As a land grant institution, UNL’s College of Journalism and Mass Communications is dedicated to providing an accessible education for all. Our donors are vital to fulfilling that mission.”\n\nDuring the brunch, scholarship recipients were recognized and provided with a certificate noting their achievements. Donors were also recognized and had the opportunity to meet the recipients of their scholarships.\n\nGreg Anderson, CEO of Bailey Lauerman, spoke about the importance of investing in the future through scholarships. Nebraska advertising agency Bailey Lauerman has established three funds to support students in the college.\n\nThe Bailey Lauerman Fund for Student Opportunity provides support for junior and senior advertising and public relations students who have demonstrated their commitment to diversity and inclusion through work with campus organizations or non-profits. Recipients receive a $5,000 scholarship and an offer to join their summer internship program.\n\nThe Bailey Lauerman Design Diversity Challenge provides students the opportunity to compete by creating designs that celebrate diversity in Nebraska. The designs are judged by professional designers from the agency. The winner receives a $1,000 scholarship and their design is displayed as a mural in Andersen Hall for one year.\n\nThe Bailey Lauerman Fund for Competitive Advantage provides support for travel and related expenses for the college’s American Advertising Federation National Student Advertising Competition team.\n\n“Diversity in our industries is vital to our success in the future,” said Greg Andersen, CEO of Bailey Lauerman. “We are investing in that future by ensuring that diverse students have the opportunity to succeed in college.”\n\nSenior advertising and public relations major Dulce Garcia also spoke. Garcia is the current recipient of the Bailey Lauerman Fund for Student Opportunity. She is also a recipient of the college’s Student Emergency Scholarship, which provides support for students facing unforeseen circumstances that could keep them from completing their degree. The Student Emergency Scholarship was initially funded by friend of the college Phil Perry, but anyone can contribute to the fund to support students in need.\n\nGarcia shared her experiences and how she has taken advantage of the opportunities scholarship support has provided to her. She listed many accomplishments during her time at UNL, including earning a 4.0 GPA, co-founding the Combs Honors Scholars, serving as vice president of Define America, joining the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska, interning for the E.N. Thompson Forum and Bailey Lauerman, serving on the OASIS Student Advisory Board and more.\n\n“I list all my accomplishments not to boast but to show that the investment the CoJMC, alumni and donors made in my future was worthwhile.” Garcia said.\n\nThe ceremony also recognized donors who have established new funds this year. These funds will provide support for students enrolled in the college in the future. The new funds in 2022-2023 are:\n\nThe 2022-2023 College of Journalism and Mass Communications Scholarship recipients are:"
