BAILEY'S PATENT [ D N \\} AMONG the many excellent qualities possessed by this material for ceil- ings, partitions, roofs and floors, in ad- dition to being absolutely fire-proof, it presents a fiat surface on bottom and on top after being placed in position, there- by giving a fiat ceiling, substantial and ready for plastering, and a true and firm foundation for the floor. They are free from shrinkage, thereby avoiding the unsightly cracks invariably seen in ceil- ings of buildings. The further advantages of these par- titions are lightness, weighing about two and one-half pounds per foot, including the hollow rods ; they are vermin-proof; do not transmit heat or sound, and can be set up very rapidly. These ceilings can be extended and suspended any distance below the beams. They are hung by means of iron hooks and eye-bolts.

SPRING STEEL CALVANI IT CANNOT BE KINKED Sizes, 1-H to 4'J inches In diameter. J\\Iore hose is destroyed by the sudden concussions through kinking, when a full velocity of water is rushing through it, than by actual wear.

VERY IMPORTANT. This Hose and Armor can be cut at every wind of the wire, without loosening or uncoiling. The Sphincter Grip of the wire being self-holding through its entire length. This very essential feature is one of the principal points secured by one of our patents. Purchasers are cautioned against a hose wound with a soft puttydike wire fastened (appar- ently) at the end with a llimsy device to prevent loosening, unwinding or shuffling off, and repre- sented as the Sphincter Grip Hose.

The rights secured to us render each individual or user responsible for such unlawful use, with all the conse- quences thereof.

Oentlemen : — It affords me pleasure to state tbat since 1874. we have used, on the East River Bridge and its approaches, over 70,000 barrels of your Cement, with uniformly satisfactory re- sults. At one time a series of - tests were made, by our Mr. A. V. Abbott, of your Cement ex- tending over a period of ten months.. Each result given was obtained by breaking fine bri- quets and taking the average. One set of samples were placed j in water and the other set re--, mained in the air. (See tests A. V. Abbott, C. E.) I Very truly yours, C. C. Martin, P. A. Engineer, East River Bridge. Eiifrineer'ii Office, Monongahcla Bridge. Pittsburgh, Jan. 27th, 1882. Sirs :— The New York and Rosendale Cement gave entire satisfaction at the Monongahela Bridge. It has been used for concrete in foundations under water, and in the concrete filling of the large piers,' with entire success. Especially commend-, able is its reliable even quality, which, we found, distinguishes it favorably in that respect from other cements used in the same work. ,,. G.
