At least one of them goes so far as ranging from mop'handle manufacturers to the giant to grant the organization set up to control the insteel industry. Enforcement groups have lately dustry power to prevent additions to productive The Securities Act T T Volume 138 Financial Chronicle equipment. Let us not deceive ourselves in these matters. In one degree or another, and to one extent or another, a great many industries in this country were actively engaged in co-operative effort of this general sort long before the National Industrial Recovery Act was ever thought of, and indeed long before the so-called New Era with its allegedly endless prosperity finally and decisively came to an end in 1929. The Federal Trade Commission itself had for years prior to the inauguration of the present regime in Washington been actively pushing forward the program of codes of ethics, and fair trade practice conferences as they were then called. The Department of Justice in conjunction with the Department of Commerce had worked out a system under President Coolidge for conferring in advance with business executives wishing to undertake cooperative procedures likely to run afoul of the antitrust laws, and during the later days of President Coolidge's second term of office, a technique had developed by which a good many transactions designed to do a substantial part of what the NRA codes are now undertaking to do gained assurances from the law enforcing authorities that they were not likely to be interfered with. Certain elements in Congress, however, became deeply dissatisfied with the practices thus described, and the Department of Justice under President Hoover, by no means satisfied that the procedure was in accord with law, undertook a much more rigorous enforcement program. Earlier Efforts Collapse Partly due to the greater activity of the Department of Justice, but partly also as a result of the natural forces of competition in times of depression and failing markets, many if not most of these arrangements broke down in actual practice. Not only did demoralized conditions develop on a wide scale, but a number of old abuses, such as the sweatshops, re-appeared in re-invigorated form. It was at this stage and with this historical background that the idea of the present-day codes sprang into existence. It was because of the popular support of any movement designed to eliminate social abuses that had come to such vigorous life in our midst, and the support within industry itself of the idea of combinations for the purpose of joint control of prices and production that the program was able to move forward with such vigor. At some stage during its existence, of course, there was grafted upon it the thought that the mechanism thus brought into being could be used to advance wages as a means of promoting prosperity, and (at times at least) that it could likewise be employed to raise prices—a consummation at one time considered the keystone of the arch of recovery. But at no time has the public, or, so far as can be inferred, public officials for that matter, ever paused in the mad rush of events to give serious and dispassionate thought to the implications of all this. The time is now most opportune for such consideration. Fuadamental Questions Several questions come at once to mind. The first is: Are we not in a good many industries running a serious danger of creating for ourselves another prohibition enforcement problem? It is a commonplace in Germany, with its long experience with cartels, that industries composed of many small enterprises widely scattered over large geographical 2627 areas, or devoting themselves to the production or sale of non-standardized products, are not well adapted to effective self-discipline. Indeed, in that country it has never been possible to build effective cartels in such industries or trades. Yet we have gone blithely ahead with an undertaking not only to organize them, but to make the Government an active party to their enforcement. There is real danger that the law in many instances will presently become a mockery. On the other hand, there is plenty of historical evidence to support belief that industries dominated by a relatively few large producers of relatively highly standardized products can be effective, at least for considerable periods of time, in jointly controlling production and prices. They doubtless can be the more effective in doing so when they have the Government as an:actually'supporting agency. What in these arrangements is termed \"fair competition\" of course used to be viewed as \"restraint of trade\" and as such was condemned by law. Has it now become wise to nurture monopoly? It is all very well for reformers to talk glibly about the wastes of competition. There are plenty of them. Let the theoricians assert that in modern industry with its enormous overhead, profit, or the lack of it, does not act with the usually assumed effectiveness as an automatic regulator of production. There is substantial truth in such statements. But after all, not even half the story is thus told. Along with all its shortcomings, the older system possessed certain qualities of ruggedness, and carried incentives, not to say compulsions, to efficiency, which appear plainly to be lacking in any of the substitutes we have now devised. Moreover we are plainly unprepared to protect the consumer from oppression. There is no reason to suppose that we should in the long run fare better for the adoption of contracts that probably cannot be enforced and may result only in friction and injustice, or for the formulation of agreements that largely eliminate the competition which has been the hand-maiden of our successful industrial development of the past. On the contrary all history plainly teaches that there is much hazard in both. Another Aspect But there is another aspect of this situation that deserves very careful thought. These code authorities are usually dominated by the larger, more powerful and aggressive elements in the trades to which they relate. Not infrequently only a portion of a given trade or industry is primarily responsible for the formulation of the code—and largely for the personnel of the managing organization under it. A majority of this section is effective in these decisions. The net result is that an industry may in extraordinary degree come under almost complete control of a group really representing a relatively small section of it. In any event, it is usually true that the larger enterprises and interests dominate both the code making and the code administration. That almost limitless opportunity is thus afforded for discrimination is evident. In existing circumstances, it would be an almost super-human task for Governmental authorities effectively to guard against evils of this sort, no matter how consciencious or how capable. No enlightened business man is likely to complain of the introduction of any new system or plan by 2628 Financial Chronicle which the old order can be improved. But we of course ought to be certain that such changes really are likely to improve the situation. Under existing arrangements it would appear that minorities and the less well represented groups in business, and the consumer, are destined to suffer severely if great care is not exercised in preventing it, while the whole structure of society may be weakened by a further courting of disregard for laws which in the nature of the case cannot be effectively enforced. These, no doubt, are rather strong words, but the situation seems to require them. We have now reached the stage where all these matters ought to have the attention they deserve. We shall probably not escape the necessity of thinking seriously about them during the coming half-year. The Federal Reserve Bank Statement IPLE indication again is afforded in the current combined condition statement of the 12 Federal Reserve banks that the Treasury is determined to push relentlessly the expansion of credit resources in the country, regardless of its effect, actual and potential. Utilization of the so-called gold profit which resulted from devaluation of the dollar was pushed on a large scale in the week covered by the statement, apparently in order to offset Treasury requirements for the redemption in cash on April 16 of the portion of called Fourth Liberty 4/ 1 4% bonds 4% that was not converted into new long-term 31/ bonds. The Treasury deposited or sold to the Federal Reserve banks $90,142,000 of the new gold certificates which now represent the interest of the Reserve System in the monetary gold of the country. But the net gain in gold stocks was only $14,000,000, and utilization of the \"free gold\" thus indicated naturally resulted in a further rapid increase of the reserves of member banks with the system. The deposits of member banks on reserve account advanced $109,152,000 in the week, and the excess reserves now have reached the alarming and altogether unprecedented figure of $1,600,000,000. There could hardly be a more open and direct stimulation to the reckless use of credit than is applied by the Treasury in its present policy. In these circumstances it is only necessary to call attention to the announcement on Thursday by the American Acceptance Council of a new and extraordinarily low level of yield rates on prime bankers' acceptances. The rates for instruments maturing up to 90 days are only 14% bid and 3/16% asked, while longer datings show returns that also are not likely to pay much more than the costs of bookkeeping and other incidentals. In Chicago a movement was reported yesterday for reducing interest payments on thrift accounts in banks. The Treasury itself is one of the chief beneficiaries of the policy of extreme credit ease, as it is enabled thereby to borrow against the emissions of short-dated discount bills at rates that are purely nominal. The increase in gold certificates brought the total of such holdings by the Federal Reserve banks up to $4,476,979,000 April 18 from the former level of $4,386,837,000 April 11. The member banks, as a matter of course, are continuing their reductions of borrowing, the discounts falling on April 18 to $40,473,000 from $43,251,000 on April 11. Federal Reserve bank holdings of bankers' acceptances again declined, the aggregate being only $13,499,000 in the current statement, against $17,059,000 a week A April 21 1934 earlier. Holdings of United States Government securities were down slightly to $2,430,264,000 from $2,431,979,000, but the decrease of $1,715,000 appears to represent only incidental shifting of the various types of obligations, occasioned by the Treasury's conversion operations. Bonds were down to $406,277,000 April 18 from the total of $431,225,000 on April 11, which suggests sales of Fourth Liberty 4/ 1 4% called bonds in the open market before the redemption date of April 15. Certifkates and bills also receded somewhat, but Treasury note holdings increased to $1,207,603,000 this week from $1,179,906,000 last week, and this increase offset almost entirely the declines in holdings of other types of Federal Government obligations. Member bank reserve balances moved up to $3,669,177,000 on April 18 against $3,560,025,000 on April 11. There was also some increase in Treasury deposits and other deposits, so that the total deposits advanced to $3,900,897,000 from $3,737,748,000. Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation increased $4,000,000 to $3,029,647,000 from $3,025,812,000, but the net circulation of Federal Reserve bank notes provided an offset, as these notes dropped to $83,102,000 from $88,336,000. Payment was made by the Federal Reserve banks of the second and final instalment of the subscription to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stock, and this item of $69,649,000 was carried to reserves. The increase in deposit liabilities exceeded the acquisition of new gold certificates, and as note liabilities were not greatly changed the ratio of total reserves to deposit and Federal Reserve note liabilities combined declined slightly to 68.3% on April 18 from 68.7% on April 11. Annual Report of Southern Railway Co. HE annual report of the Southern Railway Co. for the calendar year 1933 must be considered as favorable in spite of the fact that the company failed to earn its fixed charges in the amount of$734.799.96. The prolonged business depression which played a part in greatly reducing revenues reached its nadir in March of last year, when trade and industry were at a virtual standstill owing to the suspension of banking by order of the President. Some improvement in business was evidenced during part of the year, with the result that the freight revenue of the Southern Railway Co. for the calendar year increased by $4,160,711 over 1932. The extent of the decline in business is reflected in the total operating revenue of $76,148,103, which represents a decrease of $67,035,845, or 47%, compared with 1929. Nevertheless, this great railway system's gross revenue, which had been steadily shrinking since 1929, is able to show an upward turn, the 1933 figures having increased over 1932 to the extent of $3,161,561, or 4.33%. This betterment in the gross earnings has been due, as stated above, to improvement in general business conditions, as passenger revenue for 1933 declined 12.03% under 1932. On Dec. 1 1933 the company put into effect reduced passenger fares for an experimental period of six months. Although the effect of the reduction in the fares is not shown in the 1933 report, the company early this month, in asking permission of the Inter-State Commerce Commission to extend the reduced rates to Dec.31 1934, stated that the results obtained from its reduced passenger fares represent the \"first ray of sunshine on the railroad passenger T Volume 138 Financial Chronicle horizon\" in a long period. Curtailment of operating expenses was continued throughout the year in line with traffic volume and service requirements. Total operating expenses were $53,705,409, a decrease of $7,159,630, or 11.8%, this decrease being principally in maintenance of equipment of $3,196,435, maintenance of way and structure of $2,178,237,and transportation expenses of$1,143,632. For the third successive year (this also being the third time in the company's entire history) there was an income deficit, amounting to $734,800 for 1933, as compared with deficits of $11,218,507 for 1932 and of $5,922,842 for 1931. Although the company reported, as stated above, that it failed to earn its fixed charges by $734,800, the fact remains, however, that the improvement over 1932 is of huge proportions, as the company in that year failed to earn fixed charges by $11,218,507. That a railroad system so strongly located as the Southern Railway System and 60 superbly administered should have sustained such enormous loss in the brief space of three years bears testimony to the depth of the business depression under which the country has been laboring and of its widespread character. No one can prophesy what the outcome for the current calendar year will be, but at least some favorable features are already noticeable. Passenger revenues for the months of January and February 1934 show increases of 10.75% and 18.55% over the corresponding months of 1933, while freight revenues also show increases for both months. The New York Stock Market LTHOUGH quiet conditions prevailed this week on the New York stock market, the trend of prices was generally 'higher on demand for almost all leading groups of shares. There was much to contend with in the way of sharp recessions in grain prices and threats of unfavorable legislation in Washington, and at times the market proved quite irregular. But such movements usually gave way quickly to a resumption of the advance, which appears to have been based largely on reports of business improvement and the expectation of new gains in trade. At the start of the week, the stock market was unsettled along with other markets, and losses in the more volatile shares exceeded two points in some instances. A firm tendency was established Tuesday, and the movement was extended Wednesday, until profit-taking developed late that day. Net gains were general on Wednesday, however, despite the late liquidation. Nervousness was occasioned. Thursday by developments in the grain markets, but stocks had a good undertone and changes at the end were small. In yesterday's dealings the upward movement was resumed, with some issues in vigorous demand. The turnover exceeded 1,500,000 shares only on Wednesday and yesterday, other sessions being exceedingly dull. Performances in stocks were considered quite cheerful, in view of the severe declines which developed at times in grains and cotton. Opposition by President Roosevelt to inflationary silver legislation produced the unsettlement in commodities, and silver naturally was affected by the incident. In Monday's trading all grains receded to permissible limits, and the downward tendency was continued Tuesday. After an uncertain session Wednesday, in which cotton managed to make a little A 2629 progress, declines again developed on Thursday. The tendency was somewhat better yesterday. Foreign exchange dealings reflected some uncertainty, with the dollar weak at times in relation to sterling and the gold currencies. The unsettlement in the foreign exchanges was attributable to Congressional consideration of measures for paying all sums lost to depositors in closed banks. In the bond market the tone was good at almost all times,and activity was pronounced in all sessions. United States Government securities were the outstanding exception to the general upward trend, these issues receding slightly, because of the large volume of undigested obligations resulting from the successful conversion offering of last week. High grade bonds were well maintained, and good advances were registered in a long list of speculative bonds. A favorable earnings report of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for the first quarter of this year, aided the markets for stocks and bonds. Significant of the industrial trend was an advance in steel operations to 50.3% of capacity for the week beginning April 16, the report of the American Iron and Steel Institute for last week showing a rate of 47.4%. Production of electric power in the entire country for the week ended April 14 was 1,642,187,000 kilowatt hours, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the figure for the preceding week (April 7) having been 1,616,945,000 kilowatt hours. Carloadings of revenue freight likewise reflected a favorable trend, the American Railway Association reporting loadings for the week ended April 14 of 578,837 cars, as compared with 557,887 cars, or an increase of 3.8% over the preceding week. Dividend declarations the present week were again few in number and were mostly of a favorable nature. Among the more prominent ones may be mentioned the Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., which on April 13 increased the dividend on its no par common stock from 25c. a share to 50c. a share, payable May 15; however, on Feb. 15 last a quarterly dividend of 25c. a share and an extra dividend of like amount was paid on this issue. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co. on April 16 resumed the dividend on its no par common stock by the declaration of 25c. a share, being payable June 1. This is the first distribution to be made on the above issue since March 1 1932, when 12/ 1 2c. a share was paid. As indicating the course of the commodity markets, the May option for wheat in Chicago closed yesterday at 753 / 4c. as against 851/ 4c. the close on Friday of last week. May corn at Chicago closed 4c. as against 47%c. the close on yesterday at 441/ Friday of last week. May oats at Chicago closed yesterday at 2734c. as against 30%c. the close on Friday of last week. The spot price for cotton here in New York closed yesterday at 11.80c. as against 12.05c. the close on Friday of last week. The spot price for rubber yesterday was 12.37c. as against 12.08c. on Friday of last week. Domestic copper was quoted yesterday at 8/ 1 2c., the same as on Friday of last week. Silver displayed a weaker tone, due in part to the President's opposition to inflationary silver legislation, and prices closed lower for the week. In London the price yesterday was 197 /8 pence per ounce as against 20 3/16 pence per ounce on Friday of last week, and the New York quotation yesterday was 45.70c. as against 44.60c. on Friday of last week. In the matter of the foreign exchanges, 2630 Financial Chronicle cable transfers on London .yesterday closed at $5.173 / 4 as against $5.153 / 8 the close on Friday of last week, while cable transfers on Paris closed yesterday at 6.6634c. as against 6.60c. the close on Friday of last week. On the New York Stock Exchange 222 stocks reached new high figures for the year, while seven stocks touched new low levels.

European\" Stock'Markets DRICES were irregular and dealings quiet in most sessions of the current week on stock exchanges in the leading European financial centers. There was a flurry on the London Stock Exchange after the budget speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain, as the income tax reduction announced by the Chancellor created a very favorable impression. But the higher prices established in the early trading of Wednesday occasioned profit-taking In the London market, and the desultory tone soon was resumed. The Paris Bourse was generally firm with rentes in keen demand at times, but on the Berlin Boerse the dominant tendency was downward. In London and Paris satisfaction was taken in the increased gold reserves of the respective central banks,but the German position shows no considerable improvement. The whole question of international currency matters remains unsettled, and concern regarding future developments is ever present to some degree on the European markets. Trade indices, on the other hand, remain favorable in a number of important countries. The foreign trade returns of Great Britain for March, published by the Board of Trade, reflected an unusually large increase in British exports for that month. Imports also advanced. German foreign trade statistics for March showed that the Reich again is exporting more than is imported, but the export surplus of 3,000,000 marks Volume 138 Financial Chronicle achieved for the month compares rather poorly with the favorable balance of 64,000,000 marks in the same month of last year. The London Stock Exchange was dull in the opening session of the week, as the impending budget presentation acted as a brake on dealings. As usual on such occasions, there was no tendency to increase commitments. British funds were slightly lower, while home rail stocks improved. Most of the leading industrial stocks were soft, and international securities also drifted lower. Formal dealings Tuesday were much of the same nature, but British funds tended to improve a bit. British industrial issues and international securities again sought lower levels. The budget speech was made late Tuesday, and a \"street\" market developed thereafter in which many issues were bid up substantially. Trading on the Stock Exchange was active on Wednesday morning, with British funds materially improved. Motor stocks were the feature of the industrial section, owing to the decline of the registration tax, but most other issues also showed gains. Home rail stocks were improved at first, but unfavorable traffic returns occasioned recessions in later dealings. International securities improved on good overnight reports from New York. The tone Thursday was generally cheerful, although British funds weakened after a firm start. Home industrial stocks showed gains, and renewed interest was taken in some of the African gold mining stocks. The international section continued to improve. The tone yesterday was uncertain and recessions appeared in all 'groups. British funds dipped slightly, while other issues showed larger declines. On the French Bourse a sharp rally marked the initial dealings Monday, with attention centered on rentes. This was due to the week-end announcement by the French Government of new reductions in salaries of civil employees and curtailed payments to war veterans. French railroad securities also improved sharply, while other securities were mildly better. The tone on Tuesday was again satisfactory, but profit-taking developed and prevented prices from rising to any great degree. Some issues of rentes again closed with net gains, while French bank and industrial stocks held their gains of the previous day. The upswing in rentes was resumed on Wednesday, but some of the speculative stocks suffered as holders liquidated with the intention of buying the Government issues. Bank and railroad issues were well maintained, but such securities as Suez Canal shares receded sharply. The advance broadened in Thursday's session on the Bourse, indicating a speedy return of financial confidence owing to the budgetary action by the Doumergue regime. Rentes remained in greatest demand, but French equities also were bought liberally and sizable gains in quotations were recorded. International stocks listed on the Bourse tended to recede. Rentes again advanced in yesterday's dealings, and small gains also were recorded in other issues. The Berlin Boerse started the week with a dull session, in which declines predominated. Shares of leading industrial units were off a point or two, while bonds also displayed a weak tone. Trading was listless on Tuesday, and the tendency was again toward lower levels. The Reichsbank statement showed a further loss of gold and foreign exchange reserves, and reduction of the note coverage to 6.8% was not comforting. Recessions in quotations for leading stocks 2631 were very small, however, and a few issues managed to reflect small gains. A sharper decline developed on the Boerse in Wednesday's dealings, with some stocks showing losses up to 5 points. Issues of the heavy industrial concerns were hard hit, and bonds also were weak. Nervousness regarding the impending debt conference was said to be one of the chief factors in the recession. A rally finally developed on the German exchange on Thursday, but it was not of a pronounced order. Small advances were recorded in most of the heavy industrial stock, while electrical issues and specialties were in great demand. The gains did not extend to bonds,these securities remaining listless. Stocks again tended to advance in a quiet session on the Boerse yesterday, but gains were small. Disarmament Problem UROPEAN differences on armaments matters E again reached an acute stage this week, and all informed observers now concede readily that the aim of actual reduction of armaments must be given up as a hopelessly lost cause. A Government \"White Paper\" was published in London Wednesday, which contained notes received in preceding days from the French and German Governments, as well as the views of Premier Mussolini of Italy, as expressed to Captain Anthony Eden, Lord Privy Seal in the British Cabinet. These documents furnish conclusive proof, if further proof were needed, that the current conversations on armaments among the great Powers of Europe are nothing more than moves in the old diplomatic game of affiances and counteralliances. The whole discussion is based not upon disarmament, but upon rearmament for Germany and security-guarantees (alliances) for France. The pious utterances about disarmament sound rather hollow in view of the actual course and intent of these exchanges, but the diplomatic moves have at least the redeeming feature of being carried on in the open, whereas before the World War such arrangements usually were secret. The sessions of the General Disarmament Conference next month can hardly be expected to accomplish very much in view of the current situation. That Conference has been a wearying and completely fruitless affair throughout the 27 months that it has been in progress. Unquestionably the most important document disclosed at London on Wednesday was a French reply to the British query as to the nature of the guarantees desired by France, and the further query as to whether the British draft disarmament convention would be acceptable as a basis of discussion if such guarantees were forthcoming. Neither question was answered directly by the French Government's note, which was received in London early Wednesday. Pointing to the recent German budget, which showed increases of 352,000,000 marks for the various military services, the French note holds that Germany is rearming in clear defiance of the Versailles Treaty. Such figures prove, it is asserted, that the German Government, \"whether of set purpose or not, has made impossible negotiations, the basis of which it has by its own act destroyed.\" The old insistence upon security is reiterated by France—\"security which, moreover, she does not separate from that of other interested Powers.\" The French view that the discussions should be continued at Geneva was detailed in such fashion as to leave no doubt that France considers the private exchanges between the 2632 Financial Chronicle Powers at an end. Another bid for British support is contained in the concluding statement that \"the French Government does not doubt that it will retain at the forthcoming session the co-operation of the British Government in the task of consolidating peace by guarantees which general security demands.\" A German statement in the White Paper leaves no doubt of the desire of the Berlin Government for an extensive measure of rearmament. A willingness was expressed by.the Nazi Government to accept the British arms memorandum of Jan. 29 as the basis for discussion, \"subject to a certain important modification.\" The modification consists of a demand for earlier rearmament in the air than would be permitted under the British plan. A system of adjustments should be instituted after five years, so that at the end of ten years Germany would attain full air equality with other Powers, the German'statement contended. The Nazi Storm Troops and other special forms of semi-military organizations could be placed on a non-military basis, it was admitted, but only reciprocally. But German return to the League of Nations can only be dealt with after disarmament matters, and above all, the question of equality of rights, are settled. The White Paper also republished a statement by the Reich on the German budget for military requirements, which was first made available on Monday. This was in answer to the British inquiry as to the precise purpose of the increases in expenditures. The increased allocation of funds to the army was due to the anticipated conversion of the Reichswehr (the regular army)into a shortservice army, it was explained. Larger naval expenditures were required for renovation of old units, while increased air expenditures should be considered not as an armaments matter, but as preparation for the development of commercial aviation. The summary of the Italian Government's views, prepared by Captain Anthony Eden, is little more than a restatement of many previous declarations by Premier Mussolini. Under present conditions the Italian Government is very doubtful of the possibility of inducing the armed Powers to disann. Accordingly, it was again suggested that Germany be given the right to partial rearmament, while other Powers are limited to their present forces. A force of 300,000 men for the Reich, reformation of the League of Nations and other changes are included in the Italian plan. After publication of these documents, there was some anxiety in London. An Associated Press report on Thursday states that Europe is on the verge of an unrestrained armaments race. Official circles in the British capital were divided in their opinions of the course of events. In some quarters it was maintained that the Italian plan now offers the only hope for some form of limitation, while others appeared to believe that British sentiment will favor alignment with France and a system of guarantees that would amount to a renewal of the defensive alliance. French circles admit candidly, Paris reports indicate, that their aim is an alliance with Great Britain. \"The Cabinet, united in its flat decision to stand pat against Germany's rearmament demands, decided the next move for limitation of arms must .come either from that nation or from England,\" an Associated Press dispatch from Paris said. Early in the week it was reported at Geneva that the European countries which remained neutral April 21 1934 in the World War now are tending to view with some favor the French thesis of security by guarantees. German Transfer Conference ISCUSSIONS are to begin April 27, at the Reichsbank, in Berlin, on the problem of transferring sums abroad to meet interest payments in foreign currencies on the external long- and mediumterm debts of German municipalities, corporations and banks. Official invitations to creditors' representatives in the United States, England, Holland, Switzerland and Swedan were issued by Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, last Saturday. The conference promises to be long and difficult, and it is quite possible that disagreement among the representatives of the various creditor countries will again result, as it did on previous occasions, in the announcement of transfer terms by Dr. Schacht that he considers suitable in view of all the conditions and the expressed opinions. A preliminary conference of creditors' representatives was held in Basle, Switzerland, early this month, with the aim of achieving a common front at the Berlin meeting, but it is no secret that the aim was not realized. The German situation, moreover, has become steadily more precarious, with gold and foreign exchange holdings of the Reichsbank furnishing only a slim backing for note liabilities. In this situation it is already quite clear that there is little hope of more than a further temporary arrangement to meet the exigency, although the prospective conference was originally planned for the purpose of placing German external debt service on a \"contractual basis.\" The many differences revealed in the Basle discussion have occasioned the suggestion for appointment of a neutral chairman at the forthcoming Berlin meeting, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" remarks. Leon Fraser, President of the Bank for International Settlements, has been suggested for this office, it is added. The German viewpoint at the conference is already well known, as Dr. Schacht has taken occasion to emphasize the difficulties of his country. He declared at Basle that a complete transfer moratorium seems unavoidable under the circumstances. \"In announcing the date of the new conference, Reichsbank authorities took the opportunity to reiterate their viewpoint on the transfer question, as submitted by Dr. Schacht,\" a Berlin report to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said. It is thought in Reichsbank circles, the dispatch adds, that the Basle conversations have given international banking authorities a better understanding of the German position. In a Berlin report of Monday, to the United Press, it was suggested that Dr. Schacht may offer as an alternative to complete default a plan for stimulating German exports and using part of the increased foreign exchange thus made available to meet interest payments in other currencies. The remainder of the funds made available in this fashion, it is indicated, might be used for purchases of raw materials by Germany in other countries. The Ministry of Economics, in Berlin, announced on Wednesday a new series of foreign exchange regulations, applicable only to German nationals, and designed to increase the supply of foreign currencies at the Reichsbank. British Budget HANCELLOR of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain presented before the. British House of Commons Tuesday the budget of the National Gov- D C Volume 138 Financial Chronicle ernment for the fiscal year which began April 1. The statement by the Chancellor reflects the first move by any great Government, during the present depression, toward lowering the heavy tax burdens that are now universal, and in this respect it sets an admirable example. Tax levies were reduced in a number of important directions, and in addition Mr. Chamberlain was able to announce restoration in part of the salary cuts and all unemployment relief payment reductions effected in recent years. Measures adopted by the Chancellor were much in accordance with the expectations aroused by the substantial budgetary surplus of the British fiscal year ended March 31. As in former years, no provision was made for any payment on debt account to the United States Government, although large sums are due to be paid in June and December under the debt agreement. \"Neither last year nor the year before did I make any provision for the payment of the war debts to America, nor for the receipt of war debts or reparations by ourselves,\" the Chancellor explained. \"In the absence of any fresh development, I propose to follow precisely the same course this year.\" In view of this declaration, it is generally assumed that the British Government will again make small token payments this year in acknowledgment of the debts. Details of the British budget will be found in our department \"Current Events and Discussions.\" Governmental Retrenchments UMMARY action was taken in France and Italy this week toward balancing the national budgets of those countries, while Soviet Russia also found it advisable to curtail expenditures in some directions. The French Government promulgated a series of decrees, Monday, reducing soldiers' pensions and benefits by 1,200,000,000 francs a year, and effecting other reductions of 2,800,000,000 francs in the annual budget. Finance Minister GermainMartin issued the usual statement,in connection with these decrees, that they would \"assure a true balance of the budget and guarantee the stability of the franc.\" Some objections to pay cuts have been made by civil servants, but so far they have not been serious. The Italian Government announced measures, also effective Monday, which are expected to go far toward eliminating the deficit of 3,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,000 lire in the budget of that country. Salaries of State employees receiving more than 500 lire a month were reduced on a sliding scale of 20% for highest paid officials to 6% on salaries down to 500 lire monthly. Compensating in part are enforced reductions in house rents in Italy, while a number of measures for increasing revenues also were enacted. The Soviet Government has formulated a sweeping economy program calling for reductions of 753,000,000 rubles in administrative expenses, the money thus saved to be utilized in actual construction. S Haitian Financial Control r a conference in Washington, Tuesday, between President Roosevelt and President Stenio Vincent, considerable progress was made toward that final relinquishment of American control of Haitian finances which both Governments desire. This problem has been discussed on a number of occasions, and it was made plain after conferences last year that the United States Government would terminate its A 2633 control with alacrity if a way could be found to protect the holders of Haitian bonds sold in this country on the understanding that the control would continue. President Vincent went to Washington early last week to renew the talks on this matter, and after protracted conferences with State Department officials a meeting between the two Presidents was arranged. The prospects are, a dispatch to the New York Times said, that the fiscal control exercised by the State Department will be ended before the last United States marines are withdrawn next October. In a joint statement issued by the two Presidents after the meeting,it was indicated that Mr. Roosevelt intends to request authority from Congress to make a gift to Haiti of some of the Marine Corps material which the Haitian Government feels would be useful to it. \"We are both inclined to the belief,\" it was added, \"that the policy of the good neighbor w'lich the Government of the United States is endeavoring to apply in its relations with the other American republics will be signally manifested in the results which will be obtained from this exchange of views and from negotiations which are now taking place with a view to a practical application of the decisions reached in principle during our present conversations.\" The discussion, it was stated officially, related to \"the possibility of a commercial agreement which would increase the flow of goods between the two countries,\" while there was also discussed \"a new form of financial administration which is satisfactory to our two Governments and which should be equally satisfactory to the holders of the bonds of the 1922 loan.\" Washington dispatches indicated that the basis of the discussion regarding the bonds was the Leger plan, which provides for the exercise by the National Bank of Haiti of the supervisory functions now exercised by the American fiscal representative. The National Bank of Haiti is controlled by the National City Bank of New York, and it was reported in Washington that sale of the institution to the Haitian Government is under consideration. Japanese Policy HERE were some indications this week that Japanese policy on the Asiatic mainland will be devoted rather toward further encroachments on Chinese territory than to conquest of the Maritime Province of Siberia. Concentrations of Japanese troops in Manchuria and railway extensions in the Japanese puppet-State of Manchukuo gave the impression that the Tokio militarists were preparing for ventures against the Soviets, and the Moscow Government made no secret of its apprehensions. But the war between Japan and Russia so widely predicted for this Spring did not eventuate. Quite possibly the answer to the puzzle of Japanese intentions thus posed is to be found in an astonishing statement issued to the press by the Foreign Office in Tokio, Wednesday. Japan, it was indicated, would act \"positively,\" if necessary, in the application of her restated China policy of responsibility for peace in the Far East. The Foreign Office spokesman was reported in an Associated Press dispatch as saying that if foreign efforts to \"disturb peace in Asia\" were backed forcefully, then \"Japan herself may be compelled to resort to force.\" The Tokio Government will determine, it was added, whether foreign attempts to aid China imperilled peace and order in the Far East. Foreign nations were urged to realize \"that technical or T 2634 Financial Chronicle financial assistance to China must attain political significance.\" Specifically, the statement indicated, Japan will oppose such projects as the supplying of China with warplanes, building of airdromes and detailing military instructors or advisers to China, or contracting a loan to provide funds for political purposes. No official comments on the Japanese declaration were available in Washington or London, but it was indicated unofficially that the tendency is considered in a very grave light in both capitals. Chinese authorities in Geneva declared last week that Japan plans to extend its conquest of Northern China and consolidate Peiping and the surrounding area with the new country of Manchukuo.‘ Wheat Conference XPERTS from 15 countries concluded at Rome, Tuesday, their protracted discussions on the world wheat problem, and while the results are not conclusive, they do permit of some mild hopes for solution of the wheat surplus question in further conferences. The conferees drew up a series of recommendations to interested Governments and also adopted a number of reports on specific aspects of this matter. Foremost among the achievements is a recommendation to the Governments regarding export prices of wheat. \"This recommendation,\" an official announcement said last Saturday,\"is regarded as supplementary to the provisions of the London international wheat agreement, and not as lessening in any degree the necessity for full observance of both the letter and spirit of that agreement, with particular reference to the adjustment of production. In framing the recommendation, the Committee kept in mind the desirability of avoiding, as far as possible, interference with the machinery and practice of world trade in wheat.\" Although the text of the recommendation was not disclosed, it was made known that the 15 Governments are urged to act promptly and place the price system in force before May 4, when the wheat problem again will be considered in a further conference in London. Four men, with wide powers, would be designated under the proposed agreement to sit in London and control world movements of wheat. Quotas would be fixed by these men, and prices raised or lowered in the various countries, so far as exports are concerned, according to quota shipments. Sales above or below the quotas would govern the increase or reduction of prices. The experts in Rome also busied themselves with the drafting of a report setting forth in general terms desirability of denaturing low grades of wheat to render them unfit for human consumption, a dispatch to the Associated Press states. It was contended that the denaturing of such wheat would increase the prices of higher grades, since the poorer wheat now competes with the better product and lowers its price. A report also was prepared on a French proposal that wheat-exporting countries grant tariff concessions on other products to importing countries in exchange for guarantees that the importing States will curtail production. The final session of the conference on Tuesday was devoted largely to a consideration of various proposals for curtailment of production, submitted by an American delegate, Frederick E. Murphy,of Minneapolis. Reduction of wheat acreage is a fundamental requirement of any plan for regulating wheat prices and eliminating surpluses, Mr. Murphy contended. Three plans were submitted, providing respectively for reductions of 14%, 25% E April 21 1934 and 35% of the 1933 plantings in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and the Danubian countries. The experts praised this address, with the exception of the Australian delegate, who was frank enough to admit that his country would find it most difficult to curtail the wheat acreage. Washington reports have made it clear this week, moreover, that new difficulties will be encountered at further conferences on the wheat problem. The United States probably will request a considerable increase in its wheat export quota over the figures arranged at the London conference last year, it is indicated. This can hardly be regarded as a promising development when it is remembered that Russia refused to accept any limitation, while Argentina and Australia joined in the plan only with extreme reluctance.

A comparison of the various items for three years appears below: 2635 excess reserves of member banks approximately $1,600,000,000, acceptable bank paper was in keenest possible demand. The American Acceptance Council recognized the situation in the bankers' bill market by announcing, Thursday, a general reduction of yield rates on these instruments. The market for such obligations lacked uniformity previously, owing to the tendency of some dealers to quote lower rates than the official ones on best names and slightly higher rates on others. This tendency was still in existence after official rates were reduced, but was less pronounced. The new rates are: I/4% bid and 3/16% asked for bills due up to 90 days; / 40 / %% bid and 1 0 asked for bills due from 91 to 120 days, and / / 8% asked for bills 1 270 bid and 3 due from 121 to 180 days. Rates now established are record low figures. Two series of Treasury discount bills were awarded Monday. One series of $75,000,000, due in 91 days, went at an average discount of 0.08%, while $50,000,000 bills due in 182 days went at an average of 0.19%. Call loans on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged at 1%, both renewals and new loans being arranged at that rate. In the unofficial street market funds were reported available every day at 3 / 4%. Time loans held at their former range of 3 / 4@1% for all maturities. Brokers' loans against stock and bond collateral declined $9,000,000 in the week to Wednesday night, according to the report of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The loan total of this compilation is now $993,000,000. New York Money Rates EALING in detail with call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day,1% remained the ruling quotation all through the week for both new loans and renewals. The market for time money has been at a standstill this week, as no transactions have been reported. Rates are nominal at 3 / 4@l% for two to five months, and 1@11/ 4% for six months. The market for commercial paper has been unusually active this week, and as there has been a plentiful supply of paper on hand dealers have been exceedingly busy. Rates are 1% for extra choice names running from four to six months and 11/ 4% for names less known.

The factors affecting exchange this week resulted chiefly from operations abroad and seem to have had their origin in an improved sentiment with respect to the French franc. The range for sterling this week has been between $5.13 and $5.175A for bankers' sight bills, compared with a 4 last week. range of between $5.153/ and $5.177 The range for cable transfers has been between $5.13% and $5.17%, compared with a range of between $5.1534 and $5.18 a week ago. The following tables give the mean London check rate on Paris from day to day, the London open market gold price, and the price paid for gold by the United States: S MEAN LONDON CHECK RATE ON PARIS. 78.082 I Wednesday, Apr. 18 Saturday, Apr. 14 78.158 Thursday, Apr. 19 Monday, Apr. 16 78.17 Friday, Apr. 20 Tuesday, Apr. 17 77.80 77.84 77.75 LONDON OPEN MARKET GOLD PRICE. 134s. 113id. 1 Wednesday,Apr. 18__135s. 4d.

As the British position improves a better tone becomes manifest in most of the other foreign exchanges. This is particularly true of the gold bloc currencies, with the exception, perhaps, of the German mark, which is governed by a complicated set of special circumstances unfavorable to mark exchange. For several weeks,apparently, Germany had to ship gold to both London and Paris in order to support mark credits. The dollar continues firm in terms of sterling and all other European currencies, though for the day to day quotations, as judged by the old April 21 1934 parity, the pound is the firmer. The dollar, on new parity basis, is firm rather than the pound. For instance, on a percentage of the new parity,the dollarsterling rate and price for gold in London indicate a value for the dollar in London ranging this week between 100.57% and 100.86%. This means, of course, that the dollar has been gradually approaching the new parity set upon devaluation of the unit. Since the middle of March this valuation in London has hardly varied. It will be recalled that early in January, London set a value upon the dollar ranging from 3% to 4% above that placed upon it by Washington. The United States gold buying price continues unchanged at $35 per fine ounce. This figure continues to attract gold to the United States from London and other points, but the profit on importing gold is not now so attractive with the result that the inflow is gradually diminishing. The dollar equivalent varies with the fluctuation in dollar-sterling exchange and has ranged this week between 134s. 83/ 2d. and 135s. 4d. The dollar rate in London at the hour of fixing the gold price (11 a. m. Greenwich time) has ranged from $34.73 to $34.77, while the New York rate on London based on the pound at the close in New York has ranged between $34.76 and $34.99. This last figure only one cent under the official United States gold price was reached yesterday, in an active market, as European interests dumped dollars and bought francs and sterling. An improvement in the economic position of both Great Britain and France together with newlyaroused fears of further inflation here are ascribed as reasons for the sudden upturn of sterling and francs, or, for what amounts to the same thing, the fall of the dollar. The speech on the budget delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, on Tuesday, April 17, had a decidedly encouraging effect on the underlying tone of sterling. Reports relating to Chancellor Chamberlain's speech will be found in our news columns, but it might be noted in passing that one or two features of the budget speech are especially favorable to the future course of sterling. Reductions have been made, even if slight, in the income tax, and the budget is expected to show a surplus of £796,000,with receipts at £706,520,000 and expenditures at £705,724,000. Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the £375,000,000 exchange equalization fund still shows a profit. However,in accordance with practice, he did not reveal the extent of the profit, merely disclosing that the original capital was intact. The speech revealed that the Government started a new financial year on April 1 with a surplus in revenues of £31,148,000. At the outset of his speech the Chancellor said, with reference to recovery: \"We have now finished the story of 'Bleak House' and have settled down to the first chapter of 'Great Expectations.'\" Gold has been coming to the London open market in more normal amounts during the past several weeks, as the premium has declined from the high peaks prevalent so short a time ago as early February, when the open market price touched 140s. However, it may be safely assumed that gold will continue to come from all parts of the world so long as the open market price in shillings and pence is above the Bank of England's purchasing price. The bank's statutory price for buying is 85s. an ounce. It is Volume 138 Financial Chronicle prohibited from sel ing gold by the Gold Standard Departure Act and may take only gold transferred to it or offered to it at 85s. an ounce. When the bank buys gold it does so as the agent of private buyers or of the Equalization Fund,in which case the difference in price over its statutory figure is debited to the fund's account. On Saturday last, £160,000 bar gold was available in the open market and was taken for unknown destinations. On Monday,£286,000 was'similarly taken. On Tuesday, £315,000, and on Wednesday, £530,000 went to unknown destinations. On Thursday, £57,000, and on Friday, £432,000 was similarly taken. The Bank of England statement for the week ended April 18 shows a decrease in gold holdings of £85,132, the total standing at £192,076,257, which compares with £184,834,947 a year ago and with the minimum of £150,000,000 recommended by the Cunliffe committee. At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week ended April 18, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $6,056,000, of which $3,297,000 came from Canada,$2,653,000 from England,$68,000 from India, and $38,000 from Guatemala. There were no gold exports. The Reserve Bank reported an increase of $38,000 in gold earmarked for foreign account. In tabular form the gold movement at the Port of New York for the week ended April 18, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was as follows: GOLD MOVEMENT AT NEW YORK, APRIL 12-APRIL 18, INCL. Imports. Exports. $3,297,000 from Canada 2,853,000 from England 88,000 from India None. 38,000 from Guatemala $8,058,000 total Net Change in Gold Earmarked for Foreign Account. Increase: $38,000. During the week approximately $941,000 of gold was received from China at San Francisco. The above figures are for the week ended Wednesday evening. On Thursday there were no imports or exports, but gold held earmarked for foreign account decreased $350,000. On Friday $1,681,300 of gold was received from Canada. There were no exports or change in gold held under earmark for foreign account. On Friday $591,000 of gold was received at San Francisco from China. Canadian exchange continues firm and at a slight premium in terms of New York. On Saturday last Montreal funds ranged at a premium of from Y 8 to 3-16%.

Closing quotations on Friday were $5.17 for demand and $5.173 % for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at $5.17; 60-day bills at $5.163/2; 90-day bills at $5.16; documents for payment (60 days) at $5.16, and seven-day grain bills at $5.17/. Cotton and grain for payment closed at $5.17. Continentaland Other Foreign Exchanges XCHANGE on the Continental countries is generally firm and shows more favorable action than in the last few weeks, though in terms of new dollar parity these units are still ruling fractionally under New York. The Italian lira and the German mark are exceptions. 'The lira has been under slight pressure abroad for the past few weeks owing to considerable transfers of funds from Rome in connection with the Italian Government's conversion operations. The mark has undergone a setback owing to additional restrictions on exchange promulgated by the Reichsbank. French francs are exceptionally strong and in Friday's trading went as high as 6.663 4, above new dollar parity of 6.63. The rise of the franc makes the exchange, for the time being, the market leader. At the high on Friday, the dollar dropped to a discount against francs for the first time since dollar devaluation. Were the franc to continue up to 6.69 gold could, theoretically, move from New York to Paris. However, it is doubtful that the Treasury would give license for gold exports, except at some higher and arbitrarily fixed gold pOint. It is believed that French and other European operators who had been favoring sterling since February, have been selling sterling and dollars during the past week and buying francs for investment in rentes, which have been rising steadily since Premier Doumergue promulgated his economy decrees. Railway and other shares on the Paris Bourse are also finding support as confidence increases in the new government. The franc was also helped by withdrawal of European commitments from United States commodity markets. The fear of further inflation here has also played a part. The steady improvement in the position of the Bank of France is also doubtless a factor in the turn of sentiment in Europe toward the franc. The French bank has been parting with little gold during the past few weeks and this loss has been greatly offset by imports of gold from Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Germany, and other centers. A few days ago M. Moreau, former governor of the Bank of France, apparently expressed the general opinion of the European bankers when he ascribed to the abandonment of the gold standard by the United States, not only the delay in stabilizing the pound which, in their opinion, would otherwise already have been stabilized, but also the general disorder resulting on the exchange markets. The Bank of France statement for the week ended April 13 shows an increase in gold holdings of 171,250,735 francs, which follows upon an increase during the week ended April 6 of 193,661,012 francs. This makes the sixth successive increase in the bank's gold holdings, totaling in all approximately 1,049,997,382 francs. Total holdings now stand as of April 13 at 74,978,196,828 francs which compares with 81,079,982,799 francs a year ago and with 28,935,000,000 francs when the franc was stabilized in June 1928. The bank's ratio stands E Financial Chronicle 2638 April 21 1934 at the high figure of 77.53%, compared with 77.39% at 8.59 for bankers' sight bills and at 8.60 for cable on April 6, with 77.57% a year ago, and with legal transfers, against 8.523/ and 8.533/2.

The decree also limited the amount of cash which may be taken or sent out of the country to 50 marks monthly a person. The new instrument is the eighth affecting foreign exchange and becomes operative on May 1. In another decree the Government assumed virtual control of securities and credits held by German citizens abroad. Claims against foreigners when in marks must be reported to the Reichsbank. These drastic decrees are the result of the precarious foreign exchange position of the Reichsbank, which has reduced its official note coverage to 6.8% as of April 14. Fears are expressed that the Reichsbank rate of coverage may be forced still lower and that its function as a central bank may be seriously impaired. However, new German foreign trade returns for March indicate the possibility that the Reichsbank position may soon show improvement. The German authorities claim that for the first two months of the year exports were not providing foreign exchange enough to meet the needs of imports. This has all along been the chief argument for reduction of transfers to meet foreign debt service. In January the import surplus was in excess by 22,000,000 marks and in February by 35,000,000. It is believed probable that Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, will urge a complete moratorium on the entire German debt service. Italian lire are on the whole steady although under pressure as a result of transfers abroad in connection with the recent conversion offer. Some gold has been shipped to Paris in support of the lire. The Italian situation on the whole is exceptionally sound. By the terms of the recent conversion of the old 5s consolidated bonds into new 33/2% redeemable loan 1978, the Italian Treasury will pay in a lump sum, April 23,a bonus amounting to the difference between the old and the new interest rates for the next three years, that is 432%. The bonus will entail the very substantial outlay of 2,750,000,000 lire, which the Italian Treasury will be able to meet from its own resources. The London check rate on Paris closed on Friday at 77.70, against 78.09 on Friday of last week. In New York sight. bills on the French center finished on Friday at 6.663/2, against 6.593 on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 6.66%, against 6.60, and commercial sight bills at 6.65, against 6.58. Antwerp belgas finished at 23.61 for bankers' sight bills and at 23.62 for cable transfers, against 23.39 and 23.40. Final quotations for Berlin marks were 39.72 for bankers' sight bills and 39.73 for cable transfers, in comparison with 39.53 and 39.54. Italian lire closed -4-- XCHANGE on the countries neutral during the war shows no appreciable change from last week. Swiss francs and Holland guilders have fluctuated in a wider range, tending toward firmness. The gold coverage of the Netherlands Bank rose last week from 76.8% to 78.5% and that of gold and silver combined from 79.2% to 81%. Legal gold requirement is 40%. The statement of condition of the Swiss National Bank for the week ended April 14 showed gold reserves of 1,679,000,000 Swiss francs. Switzerland has been sending gold to France for several weeks past. Its total gold cover is now 92.32%. Legal requirement is 40% against outstanding notes. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished on Friday at 68.34, against 67.69 on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 68.35,against 67.70,and commercial sight bills at 68.33, against 67.68. Swiss francs closed at 32.69 for checks and at 32.70 for cable transfers, against 32.38 and 32.39. Copenhagen checks finished at 23.14 and cable transfers at 23.15, against 23.02 and 23.03. Checks on Sweden closed at 26.69 and cable transfers at 26.70, against 26.58 and 26.59; while checks on Norway finished at 26.01 and cable transfers at 26.02, against 25.91 and 25.92. Spanish pesetas closed at 13.81 for bankers' sight bills and at 13.82 for cable transfers, against 13.673/ and 13.683/ 2. E XCHANGE on the South American countries presents no new features of interest. The currencies and foreign trade relations of all these countries continue under regulations of control boards and the currencies are only nominally quoted. The control boards, either because of the force of treaties or from practice, favor London in the allotment of exchange remittances. The \"free\" market for the South American units, such as it is, quotes them at a heavy discount. For instance the Argentine paper peso is officially quoted 343-343 %, but the unofficial rate this week had a range of from 25.10 to 25.40. Argentine paper pesos closed on Friday nominally at 344 for bankers' sight bills, against 34 on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 34%, against 3432. Brazilian milreis are nominally quoted 8.60 for bankers' sight bills and 8.75 for cable transfers, against 8.60 and 8.75. Chilean exchange is nominally quoted 103, against 1034. Peru is nominal at 22.40, against 223/2. E XCHANGE on the Far Eastern countries has been fairly steady for several weeks. The Chinese units are influenced largely by the course of world silver prices, while the Japanese yen is strongly inclined to be governed by the course of sterling exchange. The Indian rupee, of course, moves in strict harmony with sterling to which it is legally attached at the rate of is. 6d. per rupee. Closing quotations for yen checks yesterday were 30.52, against 30.43 on Friday of last week.
