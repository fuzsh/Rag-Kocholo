        "text": "The Prohibition Party elected over 60 candidates in local elections across dozens of different communities in New York state between 1886 and 1888. Most of these were elected in the western and central counties. This corresponds with the relative strength of the party in these areas in statewide and presidential elections in the 1880s.\n\nMaps showing the relative strength of the Prohibition Party in New York counties have been compiled and published by Jonathan Makeley in the New York Prohibitionist.\n\nA 60-page article on these candidates, written by Makeley, can be found here.\n\nIn the case of fusion candidates, the vote numbers and percentages are those received on the Prohibition Party line, only: D – Democratic, R – Republican, S – Socialist, C --Communist\n\nThe New York party lost automatic ballot access again this year and never again was able to run a full slate of candidates in New York."
